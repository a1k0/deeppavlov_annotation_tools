We at Polyguard view cathodic
shielding by disbonded coating as a
huge problem in pipelines. We also
believe that the shielding problem has
been largely ignored worldwide.
The evidence has grown for 25 years now. Visit
www.polyguardproducts.com/nonshieldingcoating.htm to
view some of this evidence, and to see our non-shielding coating
Polyguard RD-6. The RD-6 coating system has been used by major
operators since 1988, and to our knowledge, there has never been a
case of serious corrosion found under RD-6.
Note that newly issued DOT regulation Title 49 CFR §192.112 “Additional design
requirements for steel pipe using alternative maximum allowable operating pressure”
requires that “The pipe must be protected against external corrosion by a
non-shielding coating.”
As operators discover shielding on their lines, many are converting to RD-6. This has made
us one of the fastest growing companies in the world for pipeline coatings.

Western Gas buys Anadarko gathering system

Ghana blocks Kosmos-ExxonMobil deal

Western Gas Partners LP acquired a natural gas gathering system and other midstream assets in southwest Wyoming from
Anadarko Petroleum Corp. for $254.4 million.
Don Sinclair, Western Gas Partners president and chief executive officer, said the assets have significant potential by serving
Moxa, Pinedale, and Jonah fields. The acquisition closed on Jan.
29 with an effective date of Jan. 1.
Western Gas purchased Anadarko’s 100% ownership interest
in the Granger gathering system and the Granger plants, which
involve two cryogenic trains with combined capacity of 200
MMcfd, two refrigeration trains with capacity of 145 MMcfd, an
NGL fractionation facility with capacity of 9,500 b/d, and associated equipment.
The average throughput on these systems for fourth quarter
2009 was 240 MMcfd. Anadarko’s throughput represented nearly
half of this amount.
Anadarko’s throughput recently was converted into 10-year,
fee-based arrangements. To mitigate the remaining gas price risk
associated with the acquisition, Western Gas and Anadarko agreed
to fixed-price commodity swaps through yearend 2014.

Ghana’s Minister of Energy Joe Oteng-Adjei denied his country would take by force Kosmos Energy LLC’s interest in Jubilee
oil field, but the company will not be allowed to sell its stake to
ExxonMobil Corp.
Speaking in Port of Spain at an energy conference, Oteng-Adjei
said Ghana National Petroleum Corp. (GNPC) is interested in purchasing Kosmos’ stake in Jubilee field and has the government’s
full backing. Kosmos planned to sell its interest to ExxonMobil in a
deal valued at $4 billion. Oteng-Adjei told the conference, “What
we are saying is that this is an opportunity for us as a country to
benefit. What we are saying is that Kosmos as an investor has a
fair value to the assets they have invested in, but Kosmos cannot
decide on who enters into the country to participate and join with
us in the development of our country.”
He said Ghana has its own development policies and priorities.
Oteng-Adjei tried to calm fears of oil and gas producers at the
conference, telling them investors are safe in Ghana and his country has no interest in taking away assets of Kosmos or any other
investor. He said, “We allow every investor to get a fair value of return on their assets and investments that they put into the country.
We want to work with them to ensure that whoever they bring
into the country is mutually acceptable. But they have no right to
impose on us anybody, any entity that does not share our development policies.”
Tullow Oil PLC operates Jubilee field, which was discovered in
2007 in deep water off Ghana. It estimates Jubilee is a continuous
stratigraphic trap with combined hydrocarbon columns in excess
of 600 m, with 600 million-1.8 billion bbl of recoverable hydrocarbons.
Oteng-Adjei said Ghana does not have production-sharing
contracts, and the carried participation by its state oil company is
10%. He said the only real return to the government was in taxes
and royalties. This is one reason Ghana wants GNPC to obtain
Kosmos’ stake, he said. Oteng-Adjei said other Jubilee field partners have the financial and technical competence to compete the
project even if Kosmos is not part of the consortium.
Tullow holds a 34.7% stake in Jubilee, while Anadarko Petroleum Corp. and Kosmos each hold 23.49%. Sabre Oil & Gas Ltd.
holds 2.81%, and EO Group has 1.75%. ✦

Thailand hikes E&P spending
Thailand’s exploration and production spending is projected
by the Department of Mineral Fuels (DMF) to increase 18% this
year to 169.75 billion baht ($5.14 billion).
E&P spending amounted to 144.23 billion baht in 2009.
Of the projected 2010 budget, 130.23 billion baht would be for
capital expenditures, 36.76 billion baht for operating expenses,
and 2.76 billion baht for exploration. Most will go to concession
areas in the production stage under existing participants, especially PTT Exploration & Production Plc (PTTEP) and Chevron Inc.,
which are the country’s largest gas producers.
PTTEP and Chevron will continue to be top spenders this year
at 83.04 billion baht and 67.03 billion baht, respectively. Other
concessionaires are expected to spend 19.68 billion baht.
According to DMF, 78% of total expenditures in 2010 will be
for development and production, 13% for exploration, and 9% for
operation and management costs.

reservoir.” It also found oil in a deeper reservoir.
The well tested gas at an equipment-restricted rate of 57
MMcfd, and indications were that future deliverability could exceed 90 MMcfd. Front-end engineering design for the Liwan 3-1
deepwater project is complete. Husky will develop Liwan 3-1 and
Liuhua 34-2 in tandem. Gas production is to start around 2013.
Liuhua 29-1 field will be appraised this year and will use Liwan
field facilities.
The West Hercules semisubmersible is preparing to spud the
first delineation well at Liuhua 34-2 (OGJ Online, Dec. 9, 2009).
CNOOC Ltd. has the right to participate in any field development project for up to 51% working interest.

Colombia Middle Mag find may have two pays
An apparent discovery in Colombia’s Middle Magdalena basin
may have oil pay zones in the Upper Cretaceous Umir and Paleocene Lisama formations, said PetroLatina Energy PLC.
The Zoe-1 well, on the Midas block 12 km east of Santa Lucia
heavy oil field, went to a total depth of 10,924 ft. Logs show the
well to be 60 ft true vertical depth subsea structurally higher at the
Lisama level to the San Alberto well Texaco drilled on the same
structure in 1985.
Log analysis at Zoe-1 indicated 47 ft of net oil pay in Lisama at
8,632-8,701 ft. A section at 8,701-30 ft also has reservoir quality
rock and good oil shows, but it is not yet clear whether it is oilbearing. The Zoe-1 well also appears to contain producible oil in
Umir, where it found two thin sands. The Umir sands were found
somewhat overpressured with porosities up to 27% and permeability of 100 md.
Umir tested at a stable 42 b/d of 23° gravity oil at 1,500 psi
flowing tubinghead pressure on an 8⁄64-in. choke. Water cut is 5%
and dropping. Umir tests will continue until the end of February,
when a service rig will move in to test the Lisama.
PetroLatina is operator of the Midas block with 70% interest.
The rig has moved to drill the Santa Lucia-4 development well
between two existing wells that produce 19° gravity oil from Eocene La Paz.
Santa Lucia field has several undrilled development locations
and potential extension locations and a nearby undrilled prospect.
PetroLatina will drill at least one development well and one exploration well on this block in the current drilling campaign.
PetroLatina operates Santa Lucia field with 20% interest. Petrosantander Inc., Houston, has 20%, and Colombia’s state Ecopetrol SA has 60%.

the group will spend as much as $14.85 million to buy electrical
submersible pumps, subsea trees, and engineering support.
They also commissioned a team to plan the development and
submit an environmental statement and field development plan to
authorities for approval. The team also will complete negotiation
of contracts for a floating production, storage, and offtake vessel,
subsea facilities, and drilling services.
Ithaca had considered tying Athena wells back to the Claymore
platform but found the FPSO option faster (OGJ Online, July 21,
2008). The company estimates initial gross production from the
field of 22,000 b/d.
Ithaca has drilled and suspended three Athena wells, which
will be reentered and completed. It plans to drill two more wells,
one a producer and the other for water injection, in the fourth
quarter this year and first quarter of 2011.
Production will flow through a subsea manifold to the standalone FPSO via a 2-km, 8-in. flowline. Shuttle tankers will carry
oil from the FPSO. Ithaca expects all offshore installation work to
be complete by the end of the second quarter of 2011.
It said Sproule International Ltd. at the end of 2009 estimated
Athena proved and probable reserves at 24.4 million bbl.
Other interests are Dyas UK Ltd. 74.5%, EWE AG 20%, and Zeus
Petroleum 10%.

Kurdistan well hits pressure below Shiranish

Well control measures are being implemented at the Kurdamir-1 indicated discovery in the northern part of the 2,120 sq
km Kalar Bawanoor Block 44 in the southern part of Iraq’s Kurdistan region.
WesternZagros Resources Ltd., Calgary, block operator with
40% interest, has drilled an 81⁄2-in. hole to 4,077 m and has penetrated the Aaliji seal and the Cretaceous Shiranish reservoir target and drilled into the Gulneri seal, where it encountered a high
pressure zone. Numerous oil and gas shows encountered while
drilling through the Aaliji and Shiranish formations are to be
logged and tested through 7-in. casing.
The well flowed at combined, equipment-limited rates of 27.5
MMcfd of gas and 1,172 b/d of 61° gravity condensate from Oligocene Pilaspi-Jaddala carbonates drillstem tested at 2,195-2,235 m
and 2,280-2,352 m in late 2009. Independent geochemical evaluation indicates the condensate is from an oil-prone source and is
likely to be associated with an oil column deeper in the Kurdamir
structure. A follow-up flank well is under consideration.
The Aaliji seal was thicker than prognosed and the Shiranish
and Gulneri seal were deeper than prognosed. A revised depth

vestment decisions on pipeline gas will be made in March 2011
and on LNG before the end of 2011.
That schedule will allow for the start of pipeline gas production in 2016 and of LNG in 2017, each 3 years later than initially
planned (OGJ, May 18, 2009, p. 23).
The field, discovered in 1988, holds an estimated 135 tcf of
recoverable gas. It lies in 1,100 ft of water near the edge of winter
sea ice. The Shtokman partners have decided to treat offshore production facilities, the pipeline to shore, and onshore gas treatment
as a stage in the first phase of the development project separate
from LNG work.
The first phase targets production of 2.4 bcfd of gas from 20
producing wells drilled from three subsea templates. It includes
installation of a floating production unit, construction of two dual-phase pipelines to shore, construction of a liquefaction plant at
Teriberka, and a link to the North Stream pipeline serving Europe.

Papa Terra FPSO topsides contract let
Brazilian company QUIP selected AMEC PLC to perform basic
engineering services for the topsides of the P-63 floating production, storage, and offloading for the Papa Terra heavy 14-17° gravity oil field in the Campos basin off Brazil, operated by Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (Petrobras).
Papa Terra is 68 miles off Rio de Janeiro in 3,940 ft of water.
AMEC said the P-63 FPSO will have 16 topsides modules with
a total weight of more than 14,000 tonnes. The modules include
three oil processing modules, one gas compression module, three
electrical power generation modules, two water treating and injection modules, one electrical building module, three utilities
modules, one flare system module, and two manifold modules. In
addition, the topsides will have a pipe rack more than 200 m long
with a material handling trolley.
The FPSO topsides facilities will be designed to process about
140,000 bo/d, 35 MMscfd of gas, and 325,000 b/d of produced
water, as well as to inject about 340,000 b/d of seawater.
AMEC’s Houston office will manage the engineering for the
P-63 FPSO topsides while fabrication and integration work will
take place at QUIP’s facility in Rio Grande, Brazil.
Previously the Papa Terra Joint Venture let contracts for construction and installation of the P-61 tension-leg wellhead platform (TLWP) for the field (OGJ Online, Feb. 2, 2010).
Operator Petrobras holds a 62.5% interest in Papa Terra and
Chevron Overseas of Brazil Ltd. holds 37.5%.

Italy Adriatic field’s reserves elevated
Consulting engineers doubled estimates of proved and probable oil reserves at Ombrina Mare field in the Adriatic off central
Italy, where Mediterranean Oil & Gas PLC hopes to start production in late 2012.
The consultants estimated 12 million bbl of proved reserves
and 28 million bbl of probable reserves, the total being double
the firm’s June 2008 estimate. The firm didn’t revise the previous
estimate of 6.5 bcf of proved and probable gas reserves. The field
area covers 100 sq km.
The revision resulted from seismic reinterpretation, production test analysis, and other detailed technical studies.
10

A development plan the company hopes Italian authorities will
approve by the end of 2010 calls for the field to produce 5,0007,500 b/d of 17-19° gravity oil and 3.5 MMcfd of gas. The oil is in
a Miocene and Cretaceous carbonate platform reservoir, and the
gas is in 16 intervals in Middle-Upper Pliocene sands.
Mediterranean Oil & Gas is conducting reprocessing and inversion on 3D seismic data shot over the field and plans to reassess its
contingent oil resource estimate.
Development entails a platform with five wells, including one
already drilled and two dual oil and gas completions, a 10,000 b/d
floating production, storage, and offloading vessel with 50,000
tonnes of storage, and a 12-km submarine pipeline.

Cenovus seeks nod for Narrows Lake project
Cenovus FCCL Ltd. submitted an application to obtain Alberta
environmental approval for its proposed $2.2 billion Narrows
Lake oil sands project about 10 km east of Conklin, Alta.
Cenovus plans to use either steam-assisted gravity drainage
(SAGD) or solvent aided SAGD (SAP) to produce the bitumen
from the Narrow Lake’s oil sands. Cenovus FCCL is a subsidiary
of Cenovus Energy Inc, a company spun off from Encana Corp. in
November 2009.
A project summary says construction could start in January
2013 with bitumen production starting in January 2017. The company expects the project to have a 130,000 b/d capacity and be
constructed in two or three phases, with the first phase having a
40,000 b/d production capacity. Expected project life is 40 years.
The company notes that the infrastructure requirements for
the project include a central processing facility, well pads, roads,
electrical power line, salt caverns for butane storage, wells for
water source and disposal, storage tanks for diluted bitumen and
diluent, as well as pipelines for fuel gas supply, diluted bitumen
sales, diluent supply, fresh water supply, brackish water supply,
and water disposal. Cenovus adds that it is studying the option of
pipelines or rail for solvent transport.

Intervention boosts Beatrice field oil flow
Ithaca Energy (UK) Ltd. has increased production from the
northern platform of Beatrice oil field in the UK North Sea by
1,500 b/d with well interventions.
The Ensco 80 jack up has moved off the field, which is in the
Inner Moray Firth area, after refurbishing and restarting three
wells tied into the Beatrice Bravo platform. Ithaca, operator of Beatrice field under a lease from Talisman Energy Inc., had expected
the production boost to be about 500 b/d.
The company attributed about 1,000 b/d of the incremental
production to the B11 well, in which intervention included perforation across a previously untapped section of the Middle Jurassic
Beatrice reservoir to access an undrained part of the field.
Ithaca expects production from all Beatrice complex facilities,
which also include the Alpha platform and unmanned Jacky wellhead platform north of the Bravo facility, to average 10,200 b/d
this year.
Ithaca and Dyas UK Ltd. each hold equal interest in Beatrice
field. Jacky interests are Ithaca 47.5%, Dyas 42.5%, and North Sea
Energy (UK) Ltd. 10%. ✦

Total mulls over methane terminal at Dunkirk
Total SA is mulling construction of a methane terminal at
Dunkirk as well as diversification of its overall refining business,
Industry Minister Christian Estrosi told the National Assembly.
Total told Estrosi of the potential methane terminal without
addressing rumors and press reports that the company has decided
to shut down the Dunkirk refinery. Total refuses to comment prior
to a meeting with workers scheduled Feb. 1.
Estrosi was questioned by National Assembly deputies worried
that a shutdown would put 350 jobs at risk at the refinery and 400
within subcontracting companies in a time of high unemployment in France. ✦

Petrobras inaugurates new gas pipelines
Brazil’s state-run Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) has launched
the 38-in., 179-km Cabiunas-Reduc III (Gasduc III) gas pipeline,
which is capable of carrying 40 million cu m/day.
Petrobras said Gasduc III enhances regional transportation capacity to 40 million cu m/day from 16 million cu m/day. The line
can transport gas produced in the Campos and Espírito Santo basins, as well as gas imported from Bolivia and from the Guanabara
Bay LNG Regasification Terminal.
Gasduc III also will be able to receive gas coming from the Santos Basin, once the Caraguatatuba-Taubate gas pipeline has been
completed later this year. Gasduc III interconnects Brazil’s main
natural gas processing pole, the Cabiúnas Terminal, to natural gas
Hub 2, in Duque de Caxias.
Last month, Petrobras inaugurated the 93-km Paulinia gas
pipeline, which will transport 5 million cu m/day. It originates
in the city of Paulinia.
In addition to the Paulinia-Jacutinga gas pipeline, Petrobras
said that the transportation network that supplies the state of
Minas Gerais will be further reinforced in May when the 267-km
Gasbel II line is scheduled to begin operating.
With the Paulinia-Jacutinga and Gasbel II gas pipelines, Petrobras said it is boosting its natural gas transportation capacity to
Minas Gerais fourfold, rising to 13.2 million cu m/day from 3.2
million cu m/day.

Woodside selects Kimberly hub for Browse LNG
Woodside Petroleum Ltd. and its partners in the Browse LNG
project selected James Price Point as the site for the proposed LNG
plant, which will process gas from Browse basin fields.
Woodside plans to start front-end engineering and design
work in 2011 leading to a final investment decision in mid-2012.
The proposed $30 billion (Aus.) LNG plant is in the Kimberley
region of Western Australia.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

The site decision comes after the Australian government imposed a time limit last year regarding renewal of retention leases
on the Browse gas fields—Torosa, Brecknock, and Calliance (OGJ
Online, Dec. 4, 2009).

Talks start on Galsi link to Corsica
Negotiations have begun to link Corsica to the 940-km Galsi pipeline planned between Algeria and Italy, French President
Nicolas Sarkozy said on a visit to Corsica, a French island off the
Mediterranean coast (OGJ, June 8, 2009, Newsletter).
The link from Sardinia to Corsica would require an investment
of €425 million, Sarkozy said. The island currently relies on ships
for energy deliveries from the continent and fuels its two power
stations with heavy fuel oil.
Corsica’s natural gas needs are estimated at 300 million cu m/
year. The Galsi line, one of two trans-Mediterranean pipelines
planned by the Medgaz consortium, is to have capacity of 8 billion cu m/year.

GDF Suez to buy gas fields in Bonaparte Gulf
GDF Suez signed a final agreement to buy 60% of the Petrel,
Tern, and Frigate natural gas fields in the Bonaparte Gulf from
Santos Ltd. for $200 million.
This heralds the beginning of the proposed Bonaparte LNG
project to be run by a GDF Suez subsidiary out of Perth.
The company will begin with a new drilling campaign before
yearend to confirm reservoir potential.
Bonaparte LNG project involves floating LNG development of
the three fields capable of producing 2 million tonnes/year of
LNG. At this stage the contingent resource is estimated at 220 million boe.
First phase of the feasibility and pre-design engineering work
will take about 3 years and lead to a final investment decision by
2014. ✦

various means of attaining gas self-sufficiency, including asphaltene burning
and bitumen gasification.
Perhaps Alaskan gas won’t all get
absorbed in Alberta’s oil sands.

China, Asia
EIA’s International Energy Outlook
2009 predicts China will meet more
than one third of its gas consumption
in 2030 via imports. It sees China’s
consumption growing from roughly 2
tcf in 2006 to 7 tcf by 2030, meaning
imports by then will total roughly 2.5
tcf.
Over the same period, EIA forecasts production in Australia and New
Zealand to increase 2.8 tcf, much of
which is already designated for export,
but consumption in non-OECD Asia as
a whole to rise to 24.5 tcf from 9.4 tcf.
The agency sees non-OECD regional
production growing 8.8 tcf between
2006 and 2030, but 2.2 tcf of this
growth will occur in China.
Perhaps Alaskan gas is destined for
export as LNG.
These numbers aren’t predictive.
One need only look at the recent relationship between supply-demand and
prices in the crude market to know
it takes more than fundamentals to
guide a market. Many other factors, be
they political, cultural, economic, and
environmental, will come to bear in
determining the ultimate disposition of
ANS gas. But keeping these projections
in mind might at least help frame the
discussion. ✦

An opportunity unfolds
An opportunity is unfolding to restore discernment in energy politics as reality advances on
two sources of confusion. One is the supposition
that free people want governments to make their
economic choices. The other is the preeminence
of action on global warming.
That Americans want governments to stay
out of their affairs has become evident in the
fight over health care reform. The desire became
manifest on Jan. 19 when Democratic Massachusetts elected a Republican to fill a vacant Senate
position. President Barack Obama has been unable
to acknowledge this disavowal of his priority initiative and, by association, aggressive liberalism.
Continuing to insist that Americans simply don’t
understand his program, he now seems altogether
disconnected.

Intellectually adrift
Presidential drift comforts no one. Obama
must change direction. Too many of the ideas he
has tried to force into policy rely on governmental solutions to individual problems. From that
state-centered orientation flow a host of energy
splurges, some of them potentially disastrous.
In collaboration with liberal Democrats leading
Congress, Obama has fused energy to environmental and employment issues and exploited consequent distortions to assert control over markets.
The policy levers include extravagant subsidization of noncommercial energy, increased taxation
of oil and gas, and consumption mandates, all
based on fanciful notions about energy independence, green jobs, and global warming. Until
recently, in fact, the unbridled urge to act against
warming all but immunized proposals for energy
mistakes against questions about cost, scale, and
workability.
But global warming’s grip on politics has
developed a twitch. The Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change, eminent clearinghouse for climate science, is losing credibility. Problems began
with disclosure of e-mails showing that scientists responsible for crucial data had manipulated
results and marginalized opponents to promote
aggressive regulation. More recently, claims in an
influential IPCC report of 2007 about melting glaciers and vanishing rainforests have been refuted.
Worse than that for IPCC unassailability, the
errors escaped peer review and, in at least one
20

case, apparently traveled straight from an activist publication into IPCC proclamations about the
state of science. Worse yet, after IPCC Chairman
Rajendra Pachauri dismissed the mistakes about
glaciers as unimportant, the Sunday Times of
London reported that a research group he heads in
New Delhi received funding to study the nonexistent problem.
None of this means the world lacks reason
to worry about a build-up in the atmosphere of
greenhouse gases. Global average temperature
may yet turn upward again for reasons that probably include, to some still-uncertain extent, human
activity. What serial scandals at IPCC mean is that
the push for quick action at any cost flowed from
science corrupted by politics. The science must be
discounted. And the political agenda it propelled
must be challenged. To reorient energy economies
because of fear over global warming now would
represent historic folly. Human activity has contributed at least as much to unwarranted fear as it
has to warming.
One priority for the oil and gas industry,
therefore, must be to disentangle climate change
from energy policy. It won’t be easy. Many energy
interests are vested in drop-everything climate
remedies. But reckless response, such as adoption
of the cap-and-trade nonsense struggling in the
US Congress, without a balanced assessment of
global warming science would be irresponsible.
The industry should say so.

Energy choice
The other priority must be to move markets
back to the center of energy choice. That means
pushing government away from energy the way
Americans are pushing it away from health care.
Lawmakers and regulators do not know best how
much or what kind of energy people should use.
Their decisions reflect political deal-making, not
economics or physics. Political energy decisions
too frequently prove wrong—such as the 2007
mandate to use more biofuel than the market can
absorb and more biofuel from exotic feedstock
than producers can supply.
Inappropriate meddling by government in the
economy and preeminence of global warming in
energy politics are under siege. They deserve the
attack. The oil and gas industry would profit from
their defeat. Its customers would, too. ✦

A close analysis of energy markets
and refining capacities in Iran strongly
suggests sanctions against gasoline sales to the country—such
COMMENT
as have been proposed by bills
passed by the US House last
Dec. 15 and by the Senate on Jan. 28—
would not be effective. In fact, imposition of the sanctions would turn into a
blessing for the Islamic Republic.
Important
statistics must be
considered when
weighing the
merits of sanctions. Iran is the
fourth largest oilproducing country
in the world and, after Saudi Arabia,
the second largest in the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries. In
Sara Vakhshouri-Bellenoit
Jamia Millia Islamia University
addition, Iran’s natural gas reserves
New Delhi
have been estimated at 948 tcf or more,
second in the world after Russia.

oil markets.
Iran also has
strong influence in the Strait of Hormuz: About 17 million bo/d passes
through it.

Sanctions would help Iran
solve its gasoline problems

Iran’s oil policies
After 1979, the year of the Islamic
Revolution, all policies regarding crude
oil production and marketing were
greatly changed. Previously, international oil companies were responsible
for almost 90% of Iran’s crude oil
exports under long-term agreements.
After the revolution, National Iranian
Oil Co. (NIOC) quickly found itself
in charge of both petroleum sales and
exports and came to prefer short-term
contracts and a wider, more diverse
22

customer base.
The Islamic Republic immediately
announced it would reduce production from a pre-1979 level of over 5.5
million b/d to 3.5-4 million b/d in
order to save resources for the future.
Also, because of the sharp reduction
of supply in the market, each barrel of
oil generated more revenue than ever
before. In fact, by September 1980,
Iranian oil production dropped (largely
due to the Iran-Iraq war) to less than
700,000 b/d.
At the same time, the US imposed
the first of numerous economic sanctions in response to the hostage crisis of
1979-81. Although the US stopped buying oil from Iran, the exporter quickly
found new costumers. During the
1990s, US concerns about Iran’s nuclear
program led to an additional round of
sanctions. The Iran and Libya Sanctions
Act (ILSA) of 1996 supplemented these
measures with restrictions on foreign
companies, targeting new foreign oil
field investments in Iran. Still, other
industrialized countries continued to
trade extensively and invest in Iran’s
petroleum industry.
The absence of an American business
presence in Iran has, ironically, created a noncompetitive market for other
countries. Total was the first European
company to ignore US sanctions. The
company argued that European companies were not subject to US legislation
and signed a deal to develop offshore
Siri oil field. Other companies followed
suit: Eni of Italy and major Chinese,
Indian, Russian, and Malaysian companies undertook large investments in
Iran’s petroleum industry.
In general, while sanctions aimed
to put Iran under pressure to renounce
the use of terrorism or the acquisition
of nuclear weapons, they also had an
unintended business effect: American
companies could not compete in the
Iranian market and were losing ground
to non-US competitors.
Nevertheless, the ILSA sanctions did
persuade some foreign companies to
postpone and cancel bidding on new
contracts.

Argentina protests new Falklands exploration program
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Argentina’s government lodged a
protest with UK’s government over
plans by UK firms to begin oil exploration off the north coast of the long24

disputed Falkland Islands.
Argentina’s Foreign Minister Jorge
Taiana said his country “firmly rejects”
UK plans for exploration in the Argentine continental shelf area. “We will
do everything necessary to defend and
preserve our rights,” Taiana said.

He reiterated what he called Argentina’s “sovereignty over the Falklands,
South Georgia, and South Sandwich
Islands and adjoining maritime spaces,
which are an integral part of its national territory.”
Last year, the Argentine foreign

ministry presented the UN with 40
volumes of documentation staking the
country’s claim to 1.7 million sq km of
seabed, including the UK overseas territories of the Falklands, South Georgia,
and South Sandwich Islands, and a large
chunk of Antarctica (OGJ, May 4, 2009,
p. 50).
A few weeks later, a consortium led
by Repsol YPF SA announced plans for
oil and gas exploration in international
waters off the Falkland Islands beginning in early 2010 (OGJ Online, June 9,
2009).
However, in his message to the
Falkland Islanders in December 2009,
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown
insisted there was no doubt about British sovereignty over the Falklands, and
he promised full support to developing
the islands’ oil industry.
One of the UK companies exploring for oil and gas in the area, Desire
Petroleum PLC, has contracted a rig, the
Ocean Guardian, to begin drilling. The
rig, owned by Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc., is expected to arrive in midFebruary to begin drilling prospects in
the North Falkland basin.
Under terms of the contract between Desire Petroleum and Diamond
Offshore Drilling, four wells must be
completed during a minimum 80-day
campaign.
However, Desire Petroleum has
secured options to drill a further six
wells for itself or its partners, with mobilization and demobilization fees for
the rig estimated at $16 million.
Industry sources said three other oil
companies would likely lease the same
rig for exploration. The firms were
identified as Rockhopper Exploration
PLC, Borders & Southern Petroleum
PLC, and Falkland Oil & Gas Ltd. in association with BHP Billiton Ltd.
British diplomats have little expectation of any direct military action by Argentina, but they are alert to a possible
alternative: Argentina using civilian
vessels to disrupt the passage of the rig.
The diplomatic flap coincided with
recent reports that Argentina’s oil and

around the globe. The ones usually
mentioned are Hormuz and Malacca—two key spots on the eastward
oil supply route.
But now, it seems, the al-Qaeda

stuff over the Bab al-Mandab, the
southern entrance to the Red Sea.
Indeed, al-Qaeda is pondering the
seizing of the Bab al-Mandab.
That’s the word from Londonbased Al-Quds al-Arabi newspaper,
which last week filed a report on an
audiotape attributed to Sa’id al-Shihri, the deputy leader of al-Qaeda in
the Arabian Peninsula.
Al-Quds reported that al-Shihri’s

known Islamic web sites, “contained

fundamentalist organization.”

blocking southern oil transits such as
China’s transport from Port Sudan—
a lifeline for that country’s rapidly
increasing appetite for energy.
Al-Quds acknowledges that alQaeda’s control of the Bab al-Mandab
“might not be easy, especially as
it does not possess heavy weapons
and modern boats that can be used
for this purpose.” The paper said,
“But this does not mean it does not
possess the logistical capabilities that

a widening of the war on terror.

According to the country’s energy

down 4.3% from last year, while gas

than the present $70[/bbl],” he said,
adding that the rise in development
costs followed a surge in drilling costs
to $750 million from $273 million, and
in construction costs to $2.83 billion
from $838 million.
The cost to develop Senoro block in
Central Sulawesi increased to $603 million from $245.5 million in the original
plan approved in 2007. Luthfi said drilling costs at Senoro rose to $133 million

from $8.5 million, while construction
costs surged to $470 million from the
initial estimate of $163 million.
According to Luthfi, the increase in
the costs for the BP-led Tangguh gas
field and its LNG project is still being
calculated. Under the original plan of
development, the project would require
$7.21 billion, including $1.03 billion
for drilling, $4.16 billion for facilities,
and $2.03 billion for other items.
In December, Priyo Widodo, BPMi-

gas treasury chief, said Indonesia failed
to meet its oil and gas investment target
in 2009 as the global economic slowdown brought down the prices of fossil
energy, adding that contractors had
cut spending with shrinking energy
demand.
Widodo said investment in 2009 fell
10% to $10.87 billion or only 72% of
the targeted $15.11 billion. At the time,
Widodo said most contractors stopped
drilling while they waited for the
economy to recover. ✦

who added, “We can’t produce LNG
without a buyer.”
Analyst IHS Global Insight said the
Kogas cancellation “is a very significant
blow to the Tangguh project, which the
Indonesians have been viewing as key
to defending their global LNG market
share from an even steeper decline than
that already experienced.”
However, the analyst noted that in
protracted negotiations with Kogas, the
Indonesians appeared to price themselves out of the market.
Indonesia’s pressure on Kogas to
renegotiate a higher price “strained relations,” and “in a climate where Kogas
is looking to slash its import commitments to the South Korean market,
Tangguh was high on the company’s
list of suppliers to face the drop,” the
source said.
Prior to the cancellation by Kogas,
Tangguh had five long term supply
contracts: CNOOC for 2.6 million typ
for 25 years; Posco for 550,000 tpy for
20 years; K-Power for 600,000 tpy for
20 years; Sempra for 3.7 million tpy for
20 years; and Tohoku Electric Power for
125,000 tpy over 15 years, starting in
2010.

guh, while China National Offshore Oil

Senate bill would
extend chemical
security rules
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Four members of the US Senate’s
Homeland Security and Governmental
Affairs Committee introduced bipartisan legislation to extend by 5 years
existing federal regulations on chemical
plant security.
Refiners and petrochemical plant
operators have expressed concern that
proposals for new chemical plant security requirements ignore a program that
has not been fully implemented while
attempting to indirectly impose new
environmental regulations.
Sens. Susan M. Collins (R-Me.), Mary
L. Landrieu (D-La.), Mark L. Pryor
(D-Ark.), and George V. Voinovich
(R-Ohio) said their bill, S. 2996, would
give the US Department of Homeland
Security sufficient time to fully implement standards that it developed in
2007.
Collins, the bill’s primary sponsor
and the committee’s ranking minority
member, praised DHS for its work in
developing a comprehensive chemical
security program.
“This industry is vital to our
country’s economy and important to
advancements and innovations, but it
can also be a dangerous threat in the
event of a terrorist attack,” she said.
“That is why it is critical that we enable
[DHS] to continue this important work.

Representatives would unwisely bring

Eurasian energy
‘engagement’

E

nergy became a more visible part
of US foreign policy when Richard L. Morningstar was appointed
special envoy for Eurasian energy
last April at the US Department of
State. He recently looked back at his
first few months on the job, outlined
emerging trends, and suggested possible responses.
“The key to achieving our strategy
is engagement,” he said in a Jan. 28
address to the Council on Foreign
Relations. “We play a supporting, not
leading, role in Europe’s energy security and the development of Caspian
oil and gas. We need to continue to
engage with the private sector, with
the [European Union] and with individual European states, with Russia,
and with Central Asia.
“Our job is to listen, identify
common interests and priorities,
and play a facilitating role where we
can,” Morningstar said. “By doing
these things, it is clear we further US
interests in raising global oil and gas
production, in having secure energy
supplies to our allies in Europe, and
in supporting sovereignty and independence in Central Asia.”
He outlined three main Eurasian
strategy components. First, he said,
the US encourages development of
new oil and gas resources while
promoting efficiency and conservation as well as alternative technologies. The US also supports Europe’s
quest for energy security, and wants
to help Caucasus and Central Asian
producer countries find new routes
to oil and gas markets.

Global security
“When we are talking about new
natural gas production in Azerbai30

jan or Turkmenistan, it is unlikely
that one molecule of that gas will
reach the US, but it is still important
because it would add to international
gas supply, increasing global energy
security. New supply in one place
naturally frees up supply in another,”
Morningstar observed.
Initiatives to further these goals
include support of a southern corridor to bring Caspian basin gas to
Europe. Morningstar warned that
the concept won’t work if countries
can’t reach “commercially sensible,
mutually advantageous” transportation terms.
The US supports the idea of supplies from Iraq (as long as they’re
sanctioned by the central government) and Turkmenistan in the
pipeline, but sees no place there for
Iranian gas at this time, he said.

Other supplies
Europe’s efforts to bolster its
energy security also have strong US
backing, according to Morningstar.
He noted that the region has other
gas supply options, including additional imports from North Africa as
well as LNG from Qatar, Nigeria, and
elsewhere.
He noted that to further this
effort, the US-EU Energy Council
was launched in November with US
Energy Secretary Steven Chu and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as the
country’s top representatives.
Russia is another important partner
as a key energy producer and critical
regional player, he continued. “We
must engage with Russia and work on
areas where we can agree. We want
to do so in a way that upholds our
principles,” Morningstar said. ✦

this progress to a screeching halt.”
In her floor statement introducing
the bill, Collins said DHS’s Chemical Facilities Anti-Terrorism Standards
(CFATS) establish 18 risk-based performance standards covering items such as
securing the perimeter and critical targets, controlling access, deterring theft
of potentially dangerous chemicals, and
preventing internal sabotage.
“CFATS, however, does not dictate
specific security measures,” she continued. “Instead, the law allows chemical
facilities the flexibility to choose the
security measures or programs that the
owner or operator of the facilities decides would best address the particular
facility and its security risks, so long as
these security measures satisfy the department’s 18 performance standards.”

Phased implementation
She said since 2007 DHS has hired
and trained more than 100 chemical
facility field inspectors and headquarters employees and hopes to employ
260 more by the end of fiscal 2010.
DHS also has received more than $200
million to date to support CFATS, she
indicated.
Collins explained that to determine
which facilities posed the highest risks,
DHS first required chemical plants
possessing certain threshold quantities of specified chemicals to complete
an online security assessment called
“top-screen.” Based on this assessment
and any other available information,
DHS then determined whether a facility
presented a high security risk level and
preliminarily divided such plants into
four tiers of escalating risk.
While all covered facilities must
satisfy DHS’s performance standards,
security measures sufficient to meet
them are more robust in higher tiers,
Collins said. For plants that qualified as
“preliminarily high risk,” DHS required
preparation and submission of security
vulnerability assessments that enabled
the department to more accurately
identify each plant’s risk and assign
final risk tier rankings. Based on those
rankings, facilities must develop site

security plans and submit to inspections or audits to ensure compliance,
the senator said.
DHS employees involved in CFATS
have processed a tremendous amount
of information in relatively short time,
she noted. “According to the department, since establishing CFATS, it has
reviewed almost 38,000 Top-Screen
submissions and notified more than
7,000 facilities of their high-risk designations and preliminary tiers,” she said.
As of December, however, CFATS
covered only 6,000 facilities, according to Collins. “Some facilities closed;
others made material modifications
that altered their risk profile,” she said.
“Of those remaining, the department
has assigned final tiers to almost 3,000,
including all of the facilities in Tiers 1
and 2, and is now reviewing their site
security plans.”

‘Swap horses’
DHS has received generally positive
reviews as it has implemented CFATS
in partnership with the private sector,
and the program has been praised as
a model for security-based regulation,
she continued. “Notwithstanding the
department’s success in the program
and the considerable costs that facili-

ties have incurred in complying with
it, some now want to ‘swap horses in
midstream’ by radically overhauling
the law,” said Collins, adding that a bill
the House passed in November would
dramatically alter CFATS’s nature and
stop its progress dead in its tracks.
She and the bill’s three co-sponsors
were particularly critical of the House
measure’s provision requiring the use
of inherently safer technology (IST)
in CFATS Tier 1 and 2 plants. “IST is
an approach to process engineering
involving the use of less dangerous
chemicals, less energetic reaction conditions, or reduced chemical inventories,” Collins said. “It is not, however,
a security measure. And because there
is no precise methodology by which
to measure whether one technology
is safer than another, an IST mandate
may actually increase or unacceptably
transfer the risk to other points in the
chemical process or elsewhere on the
supply chain.”
Forcing chemical plants to implement IST could wreak economic havoc
on some facilities and affect availability of several commonly used end
products, she warned. A mandatory
IST program could encourage chemi-

cal companies to move their operations
overseas, she added.
“To be clear, some owners and operators of chemical facilities will want to
use IST. But the decision to implement
[it] should be that of the owner or operator, not a Washington bureaucrat,”
Collins said. “In fact, the evidence is
quite compelling that many chemical facilities, based on an assessment
of many complex factors, have already
taken steps to avoid the use, storage,
and handling of extremely dangerous
chemicals in favor of safer alternative
processes. [DHS’s] own data indicate
that nearly 1,000 facilities voluntarily
adopted safer alternative processes.”
The House bill also includes provisions directing the US Homeland
Security Secretary to establish new
risk-based performance standards and
allowing third-party lawsuits against
DHS over CFATS’s implementation, she
said. S. 2996, in contrast, would not
only continue work already under way
but also establish a voluntary chemical
security training program for federal,
state, and local governments; chemical
industry employees; and government
and non-government responders, and a
voluntary program to test these capabilities, Collins said. ✦

by 10% by 2020. The California Air
Resources Board adopted a regulation
implementing such a standard on Apr.
23, 2009, but it did not officially become effective until the state’s administrative law office approved it in January.
Proponents have said the LCFS will
diversify transportation fuels in the
state, boost the market for alternativefueled vehicles, and reduce GHG
emissions there by 16 million tonnes
by 2020. “The drive to force the market
toward greater use of alternative fuels
will be a boon to the state’s economy
and public health,” CARB Chairwoman
Mary D. Nichols said in April. “It
reduces air pollution, creates new jobs,
and continues California’s leadership
against global warming.”
CNAES Executive Director Thomas
Corcoran noted on Feb. 2 that the
standard discourages reliance on fuels
derived from Canadian oil sands and
other nonconventional sources. “This is
a slap in the face to our Canadian allies

and others who are working hard to
help us attain North American energy
security,” Corcoran said.
ATA Vice-Pres. Rich Moskowitz
added that the LCFS also would ban
imports to California over fuels derived from oil shale in the US West or
domestic coal supplies, which could
be converted into transportation fuels.
“Discouraging these fuels will simply
increase costs while failing to prevent
their export to and consumption by
other nations,” he said.
CEA Vice-Pres. Michael Whatley, a
former chief counsel for the US Senate
Clean Air and Climate Change Subcommittee, said, “Perhaps it wasn’t the
state’s intent, but as written, the California LCFS is an example of parochial
protectionism run amok. This isn’t the
type of protectionism that will benefit
California consumers. It’s the type that
will ensure sources of essential energy
are harder to find in the future and
much more expensive to purchase.” ✦

Obama issues memorandum
creating CCS interagency task force
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
US President Barack Obama issued
a presidential memorandum creating
an interagency task force to develop
a comprehensive carbon capture and
storage strategy.
Obama took the action on Feb. 3
as he also announced a series of steps
involving biofuels, including the US
Environmental Protection Agency’s finalizing a second, expanded renewable
fuels standard. While the CCS initiative
will have a bigger direct impact on coal
producers and users, it potentially will
affect oil and gas producers, several of
whom already use carbon dioxide for
enhanced oil recovery.
The memorandum reflected the
president and administration’s strong
32

commitment to developing a CCS strategy as part of its drive to build a clean
energy economy, US Energy Secretary
Steven Chu said on Feb. 3. “We can,
and should, lead the world in this technology and the jobs it can create,” he
maintained.
US Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency officials
will chair the task force, which will
develop within 6 months a plan to
overcome barriers to widespread CCS
deployment within 10 years, the White
House said. It added that the group’s
goals also will include bringing 5-10
commercial demonstration projects on
line by 2016.
The memorandum also directs the
task force to address incentives for CCS
adoption and any financial, economic,
technological, legal, institutional, or

other barriers. It directs the group to
consider the best ways to coordinate
existing federal authorities and programs, and to identify areas where
additional federal authority may be
needed.
The task force periodically will
report to the president through Council
on Environmental Equality Chairwoman Nancy Sutley, the White House said.
DOE’s Fossil Energy Office already
has created seven carbon sequestration
partnerships which collectively represent regions encompassing 97% of the
nation’s coal-fired CO2 emissions, 97%
of its industrial CO2 emissions, 96% of
its total land mass, and essentially all of
the US geologic sites with carbon storage potential, according to information

EPA lowers cellulosic
ethanol standard for 2010
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
The US Environmental Protection
Agency published guidance for the second phase of the renewable fuels standard (RFS2) Feb. 3, directing refiners to
ensure that the gasoline pool contains
8.25% ethanol.
The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) required sales
of 12.95 billion gal of renewable fuel in
2010. EISA created a second, expanded
version of the RFS, known as RFS2.
The RFS2 rules from EPA originally
were scheduled for release Jan. 1, 2009,
but EPA delayed the release until this
year.
For the first time, EPA announced
volume standards for specific categories
of renewable fuels. The 2010 cellulosic
ethanol standard is 6.5 million gal,
down from the 100 million gal that
Congress established in 2007.
The RFS2 biomass-based diesel standard is 1.15 billion gal. The biomassbased diesel standard combines the

proposed 2009 and 2010 standards, EPA
noted. That combination was called
retroactive by oil industry groups.
The total advanced biofuel sales
level, excluding biomass-based diesel
and cellulosic biofuel, must be 950 million gal, and the rest will be corn-based
ethanol. EPA defines advanced biofuel
as fuel derived from feedstocks other
than corn starch.
EPA finalized a rule implementing
EISA’s long-term RFS2 mandate for biofuels production to reach 36 million gal
by 2022 from 11.1 billion gal in 2009.
Of the 36 billion gal, the mandate calls
for 21 billion gal to come from advanced biofuels.
In addition, EPA set the first mandatory greenhouse gas reduction thresholds for various categories of fuels.

few key provisions evade sound science
and may even be unlawful.
“We are concerned, for example,
that politics may have trumped science with regard to the revisions to
the greenhouse gas emissions from the
production of soy-based biodiesel. We
also believe that combining biomassbased diesel volumes from 2009 with
2010 and making portions of the final
rule retroactive to Jan. 1, 2010, is unfair
and likely unlawful.”

Cellulosic ethanol shortfall
Benjamin Salisbury, an analyst with
FBR Capital Markets, said recent moves
by the government to boost biofuels
are incrementally favorable to cornbased ethanol.
“Although EPA believes that com-

mercial-scale [cellulosic] ethanol capacity will come online in time for 2011,
this decision could set an important
precedent for corn ethanol in the event
of a future advanced biofuel shortfall,”
Salisbury said.
Raymond James & Associates Inc.
analysts said corn ethanol blending remains essentially the same under RFS2,
but that the EPA has outlined a specific
annual volume for biodiesel for the first
time.
“In 2010, 1.15 billion gal of biodiesel must be blended,” an RJA research
note said. “However, with roughly 2.5
billion gal of US biodiesel production
capacity already in place, even this target will not do much to boost capacity
utilization, which means biodiesel is set

to remain a tough business.”
The US Energy Information Administration reported biodiesel production at 414 million gal for the first 10
months of 2009.
Meanwhile, President Barack Obama
on Feb. 3 announced a series of steps
his administration is taking to boost
biofuels production. In May 2009,
Obama established the Biofuels Interagency Working Group, cochaired by
the secretaries of energy and agriculture along with the EPA Administrator
Lisa Jackson.
The group released its first report
Feb. 4, outlining a strategy to advance
the development and commercialization of what it calls a sustainable
biofuels industry to meet or exceed US
biofuels targets. ✦

The volume of technically recoverable heavy oil in Venezuela’s Orinoco
oil belt is 513 billion bbl, making it one
of the world’s largest accumulations
of recoverable oil, the US Geological
Survey said Jan. 22.
The range of recoverable oil is estimated at 380-652 billion bbl, the USGS
said. Technically recoverable associateddissolved gas is estimated at a mean of
135 tcf and a range
of 53-262 tcf.

juxtaposition of different facies and by
shale barriers that reduce recovery efficiency,” USGS said.
The reservoirs are 150-1,400 m deep
with heavy oil of 4-16° gravity. Viscosities range from 2,000 to 8,000 cp.
The oil in place estimate relied
mainly on published geologic and engineering data for reservoirs (net oil-saturated sandstone thickness and extent),
petrophysical properties (porosity,
water saturation, and formation volume
factors), recovery factors determined by
pilot projects, and estimates of volumes
of oil in place.
Petroleos de Venezuela SA estimated
1.18 trillion bbl of oil in place in 1987
and revised that in 2006 to a median
of 1.3 trillion bbl, a maximum of 1.4
trillion bbl, and a minimum of 900
billion bbl.

Recovery factor was estimated at a
minimum of 15% for cold production
using horizontal wells. Recovery factor
was put at a median of 45% to a maximum 70% using horizontal drilling and
thermal recovery methods.
The USGS assessment is the first to
identify how much is technically recoverable; that is, producible using currently available technology and industry practices, said Brenda Pierce, USGS
Energy Resources Program coordinator.
USGS noted that worldwide oil
consumption was 85.4 million b/d in
2008. The three largest consuming
countries were the US at 19.5 million
b/d, China at 7.9 million b/d, and Japan
at 4.8 million b/d.
“Knowing the potential for extractable resources from this tremendous
oil accumulation, and others like it,
is critical to our understanding of the
global petroleum potential and informing policy and decision makers,” Pierce
said.
The Orinoco is the largest accumulation ever assessed by the USGS. ✦

Midland basin Strawn porosity object of proprietary tests
A proprietary geophysical technology rooted in astrophysics is being tested
in the prediction of economic levels
of porosity in Pennsylvanian Strawn
carbonates in West Texas.
The patented QuantumRD software
advanced by ViaLogy PLC, London, analyzes 3D and multicomponent seismic
data, well logs, and geologic records to
predict porosity.
The technique, new to the oil patch,
was applied to a 10 sq mile acreage
block in Andrews County. ViaLogy said
the software predicted a continuous
zone of 6%+ porosity, and a well has
been drilled to total depth of 11,241 ft.
“Initial well log analysis shows
potential for multiple zones that could
be highgraded, highlighted by a net
interval of over 50 ft of significant porosity in the Strawn formation alone,”
ViaLogy said. Well tests are needed to
confirm productivity.
Private Midland, Tex., independent
Fasken Oil & Ranch Ltd. drilled the well
on its sprawling ranch based on ViaLogy’s recommendation. The firm has
opened part of its property to researchers for tests of geophysical innovations
in the Midland basin, where much
undeveloped acreage remains.
Strawn targets are typically found
below 9,000 ft and are uneconomic at
3% porosity or less, ViaLogy said. Of
18 Strawn wells drilled in the prospect
area the past 50 years, three produced.
Of the other 15, seven found no Strawn
porosity and were completed in the
shallower Wolfcamp, and eight were
dry.
Porosity variations in Strawn stratigraphy generate a weak signal on seismic
and are difficult to amplify using conventional geophysical processing, said
Dr. Bob Hardage of the University of
Texas Bureau of Economic Geology.
Geophysicists like to remove noise
from seismic data, but the QuantumRD routine is to introduce noise to
enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in

processed seismic data. ViaLogy said
that allows the technique to extract
more information and “identify subsurface characteristics more effectively

than other techniques.”
The technique is untested on formations such as Wolfberry, Devonian, and
Ellenburger. ✦

New York Herkimer sand gas play to expand
Norse Energy Corp. ASA, Oslo, has
identified 300 locations on seismic that
could be prospective for gas in fractured Silurian Herkimer sandstone in
central New York state.
The total play could ultimately recover 500 bcf of gas, the company said.
Norse Energy expects to drill 30
horizontal Herkimer wells in 2010 to
double its yearend 2009 production
to 24 MMcfd by the end of the year.
Several wells await connection in early
2010 to a gathering system in Chenango County near Norwich (OGJ Online,
Oct. 13, 2008).
Norse Energy, which has been

drilling in New York since 1996, holds
180,000 acres leases of which 130,000
it judges to have potential in Ordovician Utica shale and Devonian Marcellus shale. The leases are in Broome,
Chenango, Madison, and Otsego counties.
The New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation is formulating regulations that would govern
horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing in shale formations (OGJ Online,
Jan. 25, 2010). Horizontal shale drilling
isn’t permitted, and frac jobs in vertical
wells are limited to 80,000 gal in the
state. ✦

thus numerically estimating the depth
origin of spectral anomalies. The result
is a subsurface image that suggests the

Shell Egypt NV completed a low
frequency seismic survey in the Egypt’s
Northeast Abu Gharadig basin.
The survey objective was to introduce LF technology in the Western Desert, said Spectraseis, Zurich,
Switzerland. The project is the largest
LF seismic synchronous survey, with
110 data points recorded in 4 days. The
survey data are being processed. Initial
results are expected in early February
2010.
The project took place with logistical
support from Ardiseis, a regional joint
venture between CGGVeritas and TAQA
in the Middle East region, and covered
60 sq km in 1 week using 17 crew.
The survey used the numerical

pipeline types (natural

Operators plan to complete installation of 11,575 miles in 2010 alone
(Table 1), with natural gas construction’s share of the plans (more than
5,900 miles) shrinking to less than
50%, based on reports from the world’s
pipeline operating companies and data
collected by Oil & Gas Journal.
Looking forward, to 2010 and beyond, for the second consecutive year
less mileage is planned in all pipeline
categories than had been the case the
year prior, as an uncertain economic
recovery and regulatory environment
constrain infrastructure development
plans.
The increasing globalization of
natural gas markets despite current softness in
demand drove long-term
natural gas pipeline plans
(2010 and beyond), with
continued strength seen
in planned capacity additions in the Asia-Pacific
and expanded mileage
plans in both the Middle
East and Africa.

Plans for construction of product pipelines

segments, supported by petrochemical
pipeline construction in the Middle East
and new clean products pipelines in the
US.
As 2010 began, operators had announced plans to build nearly 67,000
miles of crude oil, product, and natural

gas pipelines beginning this year and
extending into the next decade (Fig. 1),
a more than 14% decrease from data
reported last year (OGJ, Feb. 9, 2009,
p. 54) in this report and the second
consecutive year during which plans
contracted. The vast majority (nearly
79%) of these plans is for natural gas
pipelines, an increase from the previous
year as expansions in that segment’s
future proportion of plans outweighed the near-term contraction.

The US Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission issued its final environmental impact statement on Jan.
8, 2009, for El Paso Corp.’s proposed
$3 billion Ruby Pipeline connecting
Rockies reserves to western US markets, saying any adverse environmental
impacts could be effectively mitigated.
The pipeline includes 670 miles of
42-in. OD pipe beginning at the Opal
hub in Wyoming and terminating at a
Malin, Ore., interconnect near California’s northern border. Ruby will have
an initial capacity of 1.5 bcfd.
Pipeline rights-of-way will cross
four states: Wyoming, Utah, Nevada,
and Oregon. El Paso has proposed four
compressor stations totaling 160,500
hp: one near Opal hub in southwestern
Wyoming; one south of Curlew junction, Utah; one at the project midpoint,
north of Elko, Nev.; and one in northwestern Nevada.
Pending full permitting, construction could begin in 2010, with an estimated in-service date of March 2011.

TransCanada plans to expand
Keystone’s capacity to 590,000 b/d
and extend the line to Cushing, Okla.,
starting in late 2010. The project has secured firm long-term contracts totaling
495,000 b/d for an average of 18 years.
TransCanada announced plans in
July 2008 for the Keystone Gulf Coast
Expansion Project (Keystone XL), providing additional capacity of 500,000
b/d from western Canada to the US
Gulf Coast by 2012. The expansion
would boost the system’s total capacity to 1.1-million b/d at a total capital
cost of about $12.2 billion. Keystone XL
has secured additional firm, long-term
contracts for 380,000 b/d for an average
of 17 years from shippers.
Keystone XL includes 1,980 miles
of 36-in. OD line starting in Hardisty, Alta., and extending to a delivery
point near existing terminals in Port
Arthur, Tex. XL will also include 41
pump stations—33 in the US and 8 in
Canada—at roughly 50-mile intervals.
Each station will use two to three 6,500
hp electric pumps, providing a total of
up to 19,500 hp/station. Each station
could be expanded to 32,500 hp as part
of boosting the combined Keystone
system’s throughput to 1.5 million b/d.

Four environmental and Native
American groups, however, sued US
Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton and
other federal officials on Sept. 3, 2009,
to protest US Department of State approval of the pipeline.
Altex Energy is pursuing a completely newbuild 36-in. pipeline running directly from northern Alberta
to the US Gulf Coast. The line’s initial
capacity would be 425,000 b/d, but the
company says expansion to 1 million
b/d is possible as demand warrants.
The pipeline project has been delayed
by a lack of oil sands supply growth,
according to Altex, which is working
with Canadian National Railway on a
short-term option to instead use rail
for transport of undiluted (or underdiluted) bitumen.
Enbridge has renewed plans to
build the Northern Gateway Pipeline
to transport 525,000 b/d of oil sands
crude from near Edmonton to a tanker
terminal in British Columbia for shipment to China, other parts of Asia, and
California. A line running parallel to
the crude line would ship 193,000 b/d
of condensate from the coast to Alberta.
Enbridge expects to build Northern
Gateway in 2012-14, pending regulatory approval of filings made in 2009.
Commissioning and start-up would
occur 2014-15. Enbridge would also
operate the Kitimat terminal. The
terminal would have 2 mooring berths,
14 storage tanks for petroleum and condensate, and be called on by roughly
225 ships/year.

in announcing the decision.
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP is
continuing the development of its $400
million CALNEV pipeline expansion.
Expansion of the 550-mile pipeline involves construction of a 16-in. pipeline
from Colton, Calif., to Las Vegas, Nev.,
and will increase the system’s capacity
to 200,000 bpd, transporting products
for the military at Nellis Air Force Base.
A further capacity increase to more
than 300,000 bpd is possible with the
addition of pump stations.
The new pipeline will parallel existing utility corridors between Colton
and Las Vegas. Following its comple-

tion, the existing 14-in. line will be
transferred to commercial jet fuel
service for McCarran International Airport and any future airports planned in
Las Vegas, with the 8-in. pipeline that
currently serves the airport purged and
held for future service.
Start-up of the line is scheduled for
late 2012.
Holly Corp. and Sinclair Transportation Co. plan to jointly build a products
pipeline extending from Wood Cross,
Utah, refineries to terminals north of
Las Vegas. The UNEV Pipeline project
includes construction of associated terminal facilities in Cedar City, Utah, and

Brazil’s 862-mile Southeast-Northeast Interconnection Gas Pipeline
(GASENE) will connect the existing
southeastern gas system to the northeastern gas system, creating a common
gas market and allowing gas imports at
Bahia. GASENE connects Cabiunas terminal in Rio de Janeiro to Catu, Bahia.
It will create a common gas market in
Brazil and allow gas import from Bahia.
Construction on the final 605-mile
stretch of the pipeline, between Cacimbas and Catu started in May 2008. The
28-in. OD pipe, using one compressor
station, is scheduled to enter service in
2010. Sinopec is building the pipeline,
financed by China Development Bank.
The 1,252 km, 48-in. OD Gasoducto
del Noreste will deliver 3.2 bcfd of
Bolivian gas to Argentina as early as
2015 (Fig. 3). The Bolivian government,
Argentine-state Enersa, and Gazprom
are developing the $2.67 billion project.
Argentina approved a 70-km extension
to the line’s original 1,182-km length in
January 2010. Engineering and construction bids on the project were to
have been submitted to Enersa by Dec.
30, 2009.
Camisea II is a gas export project
featuring a 253-mile, 34-in. natural gas
pipeline connecting Camisea Block 56
to a liquefaction plant being built on
the coast 106 miles south of Lima. Peru
LNG (Hunt Oil Co., 50%; SK Energy Co.
Ltd., 30%; Repsol YPF, 20%) expects the
project to enter service in 2010.

Pipeline Transportation System to kilometer post 211 at Huayahura, where it
will enter the new pipeline. The pipeline will be designed to transport 677
MMcfd at a pressure of 147 barg (2,160
psig). About 300 km of the pipeline
will cross the Andes at altitudes up to
more than 5,000 m above mean sea
level. The pipeline will receive highpressure natural gas from the Malvinas
Gas Separation Plant, according to the
IFC review. The pressure differential
between Malvinas and the LNG plant
will allow natural gas to reach the
delivery point.

Asia-Pacific
PetroChina expects to bring its second West-East Pipeline (WEPP II) into
service in late 2010 or early 2011. The
pipeline is part of the larger Asian Gas
Pipeline, running from Turkmenistan
to eastern China. The Chinese trunkline
section covers 3,400 miles, connecting
Xinjiang province to Guangzhou and
Shanghai and is expected to be completed in 2010. The development also
calls for 1,240 miles of branch lines.
WEPP II will carry 30 billion cu m/
year from Central Asia to consuming
centers in China.
The Chinese section of WEPP II will
use 1.1 million tonnes of X80 42-in.
OD UO pipe and 3.2 million tonnes of
X80 18-in. OD spiral pipe. PetroChina
let contracts to both GE Oil & Gas and
Rolls Royce to supply compression
for the western Chinese section of the
pipeline, running from the KazakhstanChina border to Zhongwei.
Turkmenistan completed construction of its 117-mile section in October
2009. The line, which starts at the
Turkmen gas fields near the Amu Darya
river before entering Uzbekistan at Olot
and continuing through southern Kazakhstan to China, was commissioned
in December 2009. In addition to gas
from Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan,
the line will be supplied by gas from
Kazakhstan’s Karachaganak, Tengiz,
and Kashagan fields. China National
Petroleum Corp. has signed a 30-year
46

Special Report

agreement for supply of 30 billion cu
m/year of gas through the line.
The first stage of the 4,700-km EastSiberia Pacific Ocean oil pipeline, including construction of a 2,400-km oil
pipeline from Taishet to Skovorodino
near the Chinese border and of a rail oil
terminal at Kozmino on Perevoznaya
Bay at a combined cost of $14.1 billion,
was inaugurated in December 2009.
The second stage involves construction
of a pipeline link between Skovorodino
and Kozmino and will replace the rail
line in 2012.
The first phase of the line can carry
up to 30 million tonnes/year of oil,
about half of it earmarked for China
via a 67-km spur from Skovorodino to
the Chinese border and the other half
shipped to Kozmino. The full ESPO
line will eventually carry 80 million
tonnes/year.
The branch pipeline would supply the oil hub of Daqing in northern
China.
The 50 million tonnes/year shipped
along the Skovorodino-Kozmino route
would largely be exported to Japan, but
hinge entirely on the combination of
continued development of the Siberia’s
other fields and Russia’s continued
desire to export to Japan.
Myanmar awarded China National
Petroleum Corp. exclusive rights to
construct and operate the proposed
Myanmar-to-China crude oil pipeline.
This line and a companion natural gas
pipeline would transport hydrocarbons
from the Bay of Bengal across Myanmar
to southwestern China. Plans call for
the 771-km crude pipeline between
Maday Island in western Myanmar and
Ruili in China’s southwestern Yunnan
province to initially carry 12 million
tonnes/year.
CNPC began building a large oil
import port at Kyaukpyu, Myanmar, in
October 2009 to serve as the pipeline’s
input point. The port will be able to
receive vessels up to 300,000 dwt and
will have storage capacity of 600,000 cu
m. The line will eventually carry more
than 230,000 b/d to China.
The natural gas pipeline is scheduled

to begin carrying 12 billion cu m/year
to southwestern China in 2012. The
crude line will transport oil carried by
tanker from the Middle East, while the
gas line will carry material from Myanmar’s offshore A-1 and A-3 blocks.
Total estimated project costs amount
to $1.5 billion for the oil pipeline and
$1.04 billion for the gas pipeline.
The new pipelines will give China
better access to Myanmar’s resources
and will speed deliveries and improve
China’s energy security by bypassing
the congested Malacca Strait, through
which most of China’s imported crude
oil currently travels.

Europe
Work started in early December
2005 on the Russian onshore section of
the Nord Stream pipeline in Babayevo.
This 56-in. segment will stretch 917
km to the Baltic Sea coast near Vyborg,
linking existing gas pipelines from
Siberia to the project. Seven compressor stations will provide the necessary
pressure. The pipeline will cross the
Baltic, making landfall near Greifswald,
Germany. This section will be 1,220
km in length with a 48-in. OD.
The full system is scheduled to start
operations in fourth-quarter 2011 at
a capacity of 27.5 billion cu m/year.
The project includes building a second,
parallel pipeline, doubling capacity to
about 55 billion cu m/year. This second
pipeline is planned to come on stream
in 2012.
A joint venture consisting of Gazprom (51%), Wintershall AG (20%),
E.ON Ruhrgas AG (20%), and NV
Nederlandse Gasunie (9%) is building
the pipeline. Gazprom has said GDF
Suez SA will receive a 9% share in the
project from Wintershall and E.ON.
Suez expects to complete the deal early
in 2010. For the two-leg option, the
total cost for the offshore project will
amount to more than €7 billion, with
Gazprom investing an additional €1.3
billion in the onshore section.

in December 2007. Gas from this field
will be shipped through Nord Stream
once it is completed.
Finland approved the pipeline in July
2009, but said more information on potential environmental damage must be
supplied. The German government approved the line in December 2009. All
other countries through which waters
Nord Stream will pass have approved
the project.
Gazprom and Eni SPA agreed in
December 2007 to build the 560mile South Stream gas pipeline under
the Black Sea and through Bulgaria.
Bulgaria and Russia reached agreement

in January 2008. On completion, the
$10 billion line could distribute gas to
northern and southern Europe, with an
estimated capacity of 30 billion cu m/
year. Participants plan to deliver first
gas through South Stream by 2013.
Electricite de France (EDF) signed a
memorandum of understanding with
OAO Gazprom in December 2009 for
“at least 10%” of the consortium in
charge of building South Stream. EDF’s
involvement in South Stream is seen
a blow to the Nabucco gas line, due
on stream in 2014—a year after South
Stream. However, the French government also backs Nabucco for diversifi-

cation of gas supply routes to Europe.
Austria’s OMV AG continues to
advance the 56-in. Nabucco pipeline,
which will bring some combination
of Central Asian, Caspian, and Middle
Eastern gas to the Baumgarten hub in
Austria near the Slovakian border at
a rate of 31 billion cu m/year, before
moving it on to Western Europe.
Feasibility studies have led to a
two-stage construction plan. The first
phase, starting in 2011, calls for 2,000
km of pipe between Ankara, Turkey,
and Baumgarten, allowing 8 billion cu
m/year of gas from the existing Turkish pipeline network to be transported
through the line by 2014. Second-stage
construction would begin in 2012 and
build eastward from Ankara to the
Iranian and Georgian borders, bringing total pipeline length to 3,300 km.
Turkey wants Iranian gas for Nabucco.
The US supports construction of
Nabucco, citing the need to move gas
into Europe though economically viable
and secure routes.
The European Union, as represented
by the governments of Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Austria, signed an
intergovernmental agreement in July
2009 authorizing the Nabucco natural gas pipeline project with Turkey.
The project, which is expected to cost
around $11 billion, will eventually
have a capacity of 31 billion cu m/year.
Nabucco has six shareholders: Turkey’s
Botas, Bulgaria’s Bulgargaz, Romani’s
Transgaz, Hingary’s MOL, Austria’s
OMV, and Germany’s RWE.

IGAT IX, slated for 2014 completion
and also termed the Europe Gas Export
Line, will move South Pars 9-10 gas
1,863 km from Asalouyeh to the Turkish border. Construction on the stretch
from Asalouyeh to Bidbolyand was
completed as of June 2008.
Iran has expressed interest in finding an international partner on a buildown-operate basis for the balance of
IGAT IX, which could link with either
the proposed Trans-Adriatic pipeline
or the proposed Nabucco pipeline for
exports further west.
Iran is also building a 2,163-km
ethylene pipeline from Asalouyeh in
southern Iran to the country’s northwestern provinces. The pipeline will
transport ethylene to meet the feed
requirements of new petrochemical
complexes in Gachsaran, Khoramabad,
Kermanshah, Sanandaj, and Mahabad.
Construction of the pipeline began
in 2003 and is targeted for completion
in 2010. The West Ethylene Pipeline
was initially to transport 1.5 million tonnes for 1,500 km to feed five
planned petrochemical complexes. The
Iranian Parliament, however, instructed
the Petroleum Ministry to build five
more complexes in the cities of Andimeshk, Dehdasht, Hamedan, Kermanshah, and Miyandoab as a means to
boost production in the less-developed
parts of the country. The pipeline’s
length, therefore, was extended to
2,163 km and capacity increased to 2.8
million tonnes.
An eleventh plant was added to the
plan in June 2008. Olefin plants in
Asalouyeh and the Bandar Imam special economic petrochemical zone in
Mahshahr City will supply the ethylene;
one set for completion in 2010 and the
other in 2013.
Bakhtar Petrochemical Co., which is
constructing the pipeline, is a private

From the Subscribers Only area of

DOE’s unspent
dollars can’t
stimulate much
A Feb. 4 congressional question to
US Energy Sec. Steven Chu shows why
state-sponsored energy works poorly as
economic stimulus.
Chu testified to the Senate Committee
and Energy and Natural Resources about
the administration’s proposal to raise
Department of Energy spending to $28.4
billion in fiscal 2011 from $26.4 billion enacted for fiscal 2010. Of the proposed total,

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

$11.2 billion would be for the National
Nuclear Security Administration, up $1.3
billion from 2010.
Why, wondered Sen. Lisa Murkowski
(R-Alas.), should Congress approve a
budget hike for DOE when the agency has
disbursed only a small part of the stimulus
money channeled to it last year?
The America Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated DOE $36.7 billion in
seven broad categories: energy efficiency
and renewable energy, clean-up of Cold
War nuclear sites, loan guarantees for renewable energy, “smartgrid” and efficient
electrical transmission, carbon capture
and storage, scientific research, and the
energy part of an advanced research
program.
So far, DOE has spent $2.1 billion.
“We’re not dilly-dallying,” Chu said,
according to a report in the Wall Street
Journal. “Many of these organizations
[state and local governments] aren’t used
to dealing with that magnitude of money.”
As an explanation, this makes perfect
sense. What doesn’t make sense is the
thrust of so much public money into a
system unable to handle it efficiently.
The dilemma is fatal: The government
wants to inject money into the economy
promptly to spur activity and, it believes,
employment. Because the dispensing
agency works carefully—Americans must
hope—to prevent looting of the program,
however, the stimulus is meager and slow.
Part of the problem is staffing. So DOE
wants more money for more people to
push more papers. Meanwhile, Congress
is considering a jobs bill with more energy
spending.
Especially relative to the bureaucratic
and subsidy costs, these exertions will
yield precious little usable energy. Because of the economic drain, employment
gains will be illusory.
Congress has a more effective use for
the $34.6 billion of 2009 stimulus money
DOE hasn’t spent. It should give it back to
taxpayers, who earned it in the first place.

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

PIIGS trample energy prices
Energy prices flopped with crude down 5% for its biggest 1-day loss in 6
months Feb. 4, then tumbled below $70/bbl to a 7-week low before “bottom pickers” bid prices back above $71/bbl Feb. 5 on the New York market, amid growing
global concern that the weak economies of Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, and
Spain (PIIGS) may undermine Europe’s recovery from the recession.
That’s because of the high percentage of public debt to gross national product in those countries. Reuters published estimates of 77.4% for Portugal, 64.5%
Ireland, 115% Italy, 113.4% Greece, and 53.4% Spain. Greece is seen as the weakest
link in the eurozone, and there is fear it will default on its public debt. As a result,
sovereign debt is no longer viewed as a riskless asset in financial markets. Many
observers expect rating agencies to downgrade the credit ratings of PIIGS countries this year. As a result, investors were pulling money out of higher risk energy
and equity commodities for the safe haven of the strengthening US dollar, with the
euro at its lowest level since late May. “The dollar index had been under pressure
for most of the second half of 2009, but continued concerns about the stability
of the eurozone are making the dollar regain its value as king of currencies,” said
Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland. “The dollar index is now at the
highest level since July of last year, and on the euro correlation model, West Texas
Intermediate remains overbought by about $10/bbl, given that the dollar index
continued to rise as WTI was falling.”
In New Orleans, analysts at Pritchard Capital Partners LLC said, “The overall
market price action in conjunction with a stronger US dollar and weaker commodities suggest that the long-term outcome of the current economic crisis is one
of low growth and minimal inflation. The 200-day moving average for the front
month crude contract is approximately at $70.50/bbl, and this level should provide
reasonable support for crude. Crude has traded above its 200-day moving average
since May of last year.”
Adam Sieminski, chief energy economist, Deutsche Bank, Washington, DC,
said oil prices have remained relatively resilient in an environment of rising risk
aversion. However, he warned, “This will not be able to persist . . . since a period
of stronger oil prices is unlikely to be sustainable until global oil demand, including
gasoline demand in the US, gets on more solid footing. US oil demand in January
was still running at 2% below year-ago levels.”
Call home
After months of silence, Nigerian President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua announced
in early February he will surrender his office to Vice-President Goodluck Jonathan
after he first reports by letter to the National Assembly about his extended visit to
Saudi Arabia.
Yar’Adua dropped out of public sight Nov. 23 when he left Nigeria for medical
treatment at the King Fahd Hospital in Jeddah. Silence on his condition and prognosis prompted rumors he was in a coma, brain-damaged, or dead. This caused
a political crisis in Africa’s most populous nation and biggest oil producer since
Yar’Adua did not hand over authority to his vice-president before leaving.
Meanwhile, a government amnesty program for rebels in the oil-producing
Niger Delta stalled amid lack of progress on promised reforms that would allocate more federal revenues to that area. That prompted an announcement by the
militant Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta that it was ending a
3-month cease-fire. However, Jakob at Petromatrix said, “It is difficult to assess
what is the current status of the MEND following last year’s amnesty.”
Yar’Adua’s colleagues in the Peoples’ Democratic Party earlier issued an ultimatum for him to contact government officials. They extended the deadline to Feb.
15, pending his promised letter. Meanwhile, PDP senators said they will not accept
executive communications from Jonathan as vice-president.
Shortly before Yar’Adua announced he would step down, analysts at the Centre
for Global Energy Studies, London, said, “The situation in Nigeria is becoming
more precarious, and the fragile peace between the militant groups operating in
the Niger Delta and the federal government looks to be rapidly unraveling.” As a
result, they said, “The possibility of disrupted supplies from Nigeria is perhaps
already being priced into the March oil futures contract.” On the other hand, Jakob
said, “The vice-president is from the Delta, and a little unrest in the region would
be the perfect excuse to accelerate the transition of power to Goodluck Jonathan
who would then become the first Nigerian president from the Delta region.”

COVER
Moved to Alaminos Canyon in the Gulf of Mexico, this Noble
semisubmersible drilling rig now operates in ultradeep water at
the future home of the Shell-operated Perdido Regional Development spar. First production of oil and gas from Perdido is expected
around the turn of the decade. In its midyear forecast, OGJ looks at
the 2008 US market for oil, gas, and other energy sources, as well
as worldwide oil supply and demand. Photo from Shell.

Interest

Oil & Gas UK outlines UKCS production challenges
Operators on the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) spent £4.9 billion on developing new reserves in 2007 compared with £5.5 billion spent a year ago, according to an economic report produced
by trade association Oil & Gas UK.
The decline in spending is worrisome because rising exploration and production costs mean that capital is only one-third as
efficient as 5 years ago, which threatens bringing on new oil and
gas production.
OGUK said the industry required significant investment over
and above the £21 billion planned by companies to produce 9.8
billion boe over the next 5 years. The association believes that as
much as 25 billion bbl could be recovered.
OGUK Chief Executive Malcolm Webb said, “Whilst realizing
this goal will require massive further investment from the industry,
at $100/bbl, it is worth $1.5 trillion to the British economy and
this is a prize which the country should not contemplate losing.”
The trade association has called on the government to offer tax
incentives to attract investment in the mature province that produced 2.8 million boe/d in 2007. Indigenous production dropped
by 4% in 2007 and is forecast to fall to 2.6-2.7 million in 2008 as
several large projects reach full production. On current trends, production decline is expected to average 5% over the next 5 years.
Last year, the UK met 75% of its gas needs through domestic
production and was self-sufficient in oil.

Carbon trading scheme advocated for Australia
Australia should introduce a carbon trading scheme as soon
as possible, according to a draft report on climate change policy
handed to the Australian government.
The commissioned report, written by economist Ross Garnaut,
signals the start of efforts by the new Labor government in Canberra to cut carbon emissions. It recommends a broad emissions
trading scheme across industries.
Although the 600-page report stopped short of placing any
hard prices on carbon omissions (and thus not quantifying the
true economic impact), it did advocate that transport fuels should
be included in such a scheme. It also declared that energy costs will
rise and coal-powered electricity generation would not be given

Exploration

&

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

any compensation for having to pay a carbon tax.
However, Garnaut said it would be in Australia’s best interest
to learn as soon as possible whether there can be a low-emissions
future for coal, and to support rapid deployment of commercially
promising technologies. He suggested that $3 billion (Aus.)/year
be spent on developing low emissions technology and that Australia should strive to become a market leader in this work.
Garnaut said he supports the phase out of mandatory emissions
targets once a trading scheme is put in place. The report is one of
a number of inputs likely to shape the federal government’s policy
decisions in response to climate change.

Brazil to update oil law in wake of discoveries
Brazil’s ministry of mines and energy has created a new working group that will aim to update the country’s existing oil law,
according to a senior government official.
“This group is studying the legislation of several countries, especially those which have a monopoly, and we are going to make
a proposal to change the current law,” said Mines and Energy Minister Edison Lobao.
The minister said every country changes the rules whenever
new discoveries are made and that “Brazil can’t be different.” However, he acknowledged that there are interests intent on maintaining “the status quo.”
Lobao, who said the changes are in the interests of the Brazilian
people, was apparently referring to criticism of the proposed changes voiced by Petrobras Chief Executive Jose Sergio Gabrielli.
Noting that 60% of Petrobras’s capital is private, while only 40%
is held by the government, Lobao said Gabrielli represents a private
company and, as such, is fighting for Petrobras’s interests.
Lobao also gave assurances that the recently proposed creation
of a new company to manage subsalt oil reserves will not result in
a breach of existing contracts.
“This is an initial idea but, in my view, all contracts will have to
be maintained,” he said. “What we seek is a new formula.”
It was reported recently that Lobao plans to propose to President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva the creation of a new state-run firm
that would manage oil discoveries made in recent months in the
subsalt layer of the Santos basin (OGJ Online, June 30, 2008). ✦

Husky presses work in basins off South China
Husky Energy Inc., Calgary, has signed on for its eighth block
off South China and plans to begin delineating its Liwan 3-1 deepwater gas discovery later this year.
Husky signed a contract with China National Offshore Oil
Corp. for the 1,777 sq km Block 63/05 in the Qiongdongnan

basin 100 km southeast of Hainan Island. The block is a similar
distance southwest of Block 29/26, where Husky Energy plans to
start delineation drilling in the third quarter of 2008 at its Liwan
3-1 discovery.
Liwan 3-1, in 1,300 m of water in the southwestern Pearl River
Mouth basin, is the deepest water well drilled off China (OGJ, Mar.

That’s how many estimated oil wells were completed
in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2008, up 12
percent from last year’s first quarter and the highest
estimated first quarter oil activity since 1986. But you
already knew that because you subscribe to API’s
2008 Quarterly Well Completion Report. So you
included that in your E&P report to Mr. Big, right?

26, 2007, p. 39). The South China Sea discovery well cut 56 m of
net gas pay averaging 20% porosity in two zones on a structure
with 60 sq km of closure.
The Liwan discovery well was drilled on 2D seismic, and Husky
has now shot 925 sq km of 3D seismic across Block 29/26 and
adjacent 29/06.
Husky also shot 750 sq km of 3D seismic on Block 35/18 in the
Yinggehai basin west of Hainan Island and expects to drill exploration wells in 2009-10 on Yinggehai blocks 35/18 and 50/14 and
Liwan blocks 29/06 and 29/26.

Seismic starts in central BC’s Nechako basin
Industry-led, nonprofit Geoscience BC has launched a 350 linekm 2D seismic survey southwest of Prince George in British Columbia’s nonproducing Nechako basin.
The Vibroseis survey on existing forest roads is the first seismic
shot in the basin since the early 1980s.
The survey area is largely contained in the Nazko First Nation’s Traditional Territory, and seismic contractor CGGVeritas
is providing training and employment opportunities to Nazko
citizens.
The area west of Quesnel is also in the heart of the mountain
pine beetle affected area of interior British Columbia, said British
Columbia Energy Minister Richard Neufeld.
“Successful oil and gas development in the Nechako basin has
the potential to help offset the economic impacts of the mountain
pine beetle infestation,” Neufeld said.
The Northern Development Initiative Trust Pine Beetle Recovery
Account is providing $500,000 of the $2.5 million cost of the
survey.

Drilling

&

After Canadian Hunter Exploration Ltd. shot 1,300 line-km of
2D seismic in the basin 25 years ago, five wells were drilled but hydrocarbon exploration ceased shortly after. The basin’s oil and gas
potential is still not well understood, said ‘Lyn Anglin, president
and chief executive officer of Geoscience BC.

OGDC ﬁnds gas with Dhodak well in Pakistan
Pakistan Oil & Gas Development Corp. (OGDC) reported a natural gas discovery in its Dhodak Deep No. 1 exploration well drilled
in Dera Ghazi Khan district in Punjab province under the Dhodak
drilling and production license.
The well, which was spudded June 30, was drilled to a target
depth of 4,150 m.
Based on open-hole logs and drilling data, the selective interval
of 85 m in Chiltan limestone formation was tested. After stimulation, it produced 5.5 MMcfd of gas through a 1⁄2-in. choke. Wellhead pressure was recorded as 1,500 psi, while water production
was recorded as 60 b/d.

Sterling Energy spuds Iris Marin well off Gabon
Sterling Energy PLC spudded its Iris Charlie Marin-1 exploration well (ICM-1) in the Iris Marin production-sharing contract
area off Gabon.
Hercules Offshore’s Hercules 156 jack up rig began drilling July
5 in 25 m of water 12 km southwest of the Gamba field and is
expected to reach its target depth later this month. The prospect
is estimated to hold reserves of 20-40 million bbl in the Gamba
sandstone formation.
Sterling has 32% interest in the licence following a recent farmout to Addax Petroleum. About 18% of Sterling’s costs in the well
are being paid by Addax Petroleum. ✦

Production

Neptune starts oil, gas production in gulf
BHP Billiton Ltd. and its partners in the Neptune oil and gas
development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico reported the start of
production. Neptune, which lies 120 miles off Louisiana, is being
developed using a tension-leg platform installed on Green Canyon
Block 613 in 4,250 ft of water.
The TLP facility’s design capacity is 50,000 b/d of oil and 50
MMcfd of gas. The facility had recently undergone remediation to
strengthen components inside the hull’s pontoons, Neptune partner Marathon Oil Corp. said.
Neptune field comprises five blocks: Atwater Valley blocks 573,
574, 575, 617, and 618. Water depths range 4,200-6,500 ft. Crude
oil from Neptune is transported via the Caesar pipeline, while natural gas is exported via the Cleopatra pipeline.
SBM Atlantia Inc. installed the TLP’s 5,900-ton hull last year
(OGJ, Aug. 6, 2007, Newsletter).
Field development includes six initial subsea wells tied back to
the TLP. Further development wells are expected to be drilled after
interpretation of new seismic data, which will be obtained in this
year’s second half.
Neptune partners are operator BHP Billiton Ltd. 35%, Marathon

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

30%, Woodside Energy (USA) Inc. 20%, and Repsol-YPF SA unit
Maxus (US) Exploration Co. 15%.

Bualuang oil ﬁeld off Thailand set to produce
Soco International PLC, a partner in Bualuang field in the Gulf
of Thailand, said oil production from the field would commence
this month. Salamander Energy PLC operates the field, which was
first discovered in 1993 on Block B8/38.
Thai Energy Ministry officials indicated that output from the
field of as much as 10,000 b/d could be expected.
The field’s proved oil reserves were recently upgraded to 11
million bbl from 7.2 million bbl, with probable and possible reserves lifted to 20 million bbl (OGJ, June 6, 2008, Newsletter).
Rubicon Vantage, the floating production, storage, and offloading vessel, was being hooked up to the wells.
Six development wells were drilled in the field, encountering
27° oil, a better-quality reservoir than forecast.
Salamander holds a 60% interest in Block B8/38, and Soco has
a 40% stake.

Energy plans to increase substantially the amount of carbon dioxide available in the Permian basin for use in enhanced oil recovery
projects.
The CO2 will come from Oxy’s planned gas processing plant to
be built in Pecos County, Tex.
Oxy expects the additional CO2 will allow its projects in the
area to increase production by at least 50,000 bo/d in the next 5
years.
Oxy Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ray R. Irani said the
project will provide at least 3.5 tcf of CO2 for Oxy’s long-term use
in EOR projects and develop about 500 million bbl of oil reserves
from currently owned assets at an attractive cost.
Oxy will own and operate the new facilities and will invest
about $1.1 billion in their development.
The planned gas processing plant has an expected 450 MMcfd
of CO2 takeaway capacity, and Oxy expects to receive another 50
MMcfd of CO2 from existing SandRidge gas processing plants. The
project also includes construction of a 160-mile pipeline from the
plant, through McCamey, Tex., to the industry’s CO2 hub in Denver
City, Tex.
The plant will process SandRidge’s locally produced, high CO2content natural gas.
Oxy says it is the largest producer in the Permian basin with
about a 16% net share of total regional production. It produces
about 200,000 boe/d and at yearend 2007, its Permian basin
properties contained proved reserves of about 1.2 billion boe.
Subject to approvals, Oxy expects the new gas plant and pipeline in 2011 to start operations and commence CO2 deliveries to its
existing CO2 EOR operations.
In 2007, the Permian basin received about 1.371 bcfd of CO2
for use in EOR projects (OGJ, Apr. 21, 2008, p. 45).

StatoilHydro improves Gullfaks oil recovery factor
StatoilHydro produced an extra 60 million bbl of oil from Gullfaks field in the Norwegian North Sea as it has improved the recovery factor to more than 60%.
Reidar Helland, head of petroleum technology at StatoilHydro,
said during a presentation at the World Petroleum Congress that 4D
seismic surveys are a key mechanism to locating hidden barrels of
oil that equate to more than a year’s production from the field.
However, StatoilHydro wants to improve the rate of recovery at
Gullfaks to 70% and sustain production to 2030, which Helland

IRS issues regs to encourage reﬁnery expansions
The US Internal Revenue Service has issued temporary regulations and a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) to encourage
expansion of existing US refineries and construction of new plants
as mandated by the 2005 Energy Policy Act (EPACT).
The temporary regulations amend Section 179C of the federal
income tax code, which was added when EPACT became law. They
define “qualified refinery property” and are designed to assist refiners in determining costs that may be expensed under the provision, the US Department of Treasury division said on July 8.
An installation located within the US that processes liquid fuel

described as a “challenging ambition.”
The company has drilled 17 wells on Gullfaks based on 4D
seismic data—wells that would not have been drilled without this
technology. “Oil has been struck in all of the wells. In other words,
an excellent accuracy. This experience clearly shows the importance
of employing new technology,” Helland said.

Shell continues operations in Ogoniland
Shell Petroleum Development Co. (SPDC) has not been ordered
to leave its operations in Ogoniland in Rivers State, although Nigerian President Umaru Yar’Adua said another operator would replace Shell by yearend.
Yar’Adua said in June that trust between the Ogoni people and
Shell has badly deteriorated and a new operator would be assigned.
But Mutiu Sunmonu, managing director of the Shell subsidiary,
told reporters in Port Harcourt the company still holds a 30% stake
in its oil wells in the area.
Sumonu said company officials learned of the president’s remarks via the media. “We are yet to get any letter or official directive on the matter as [of] today. The federal government has not
formally notified us. There has not been a formal letter. We have
heard and discussed it. What the president said is headline statement, [of] which details are not available,” he said.
The government set December as the new deadline to end gasflaring in the Niger Delta, and Sunmonu said the company would
have to spend $5 billion to meet this target. SPDC missed previous
gas flaring deadlines because its joint venture partner, Nigeria National Petroleum Corp., failed to contribute its share of funding to
set up gas gathering infrastructure. So far SPDC has spent $3 billion
in “commissioning facilities to gather and process gas.”
Sunmonu said the security problem in the Delta would determine whether the firm could meet the government’s new deadline.
SPDC agreed to loan the federal government $1.3 billion to advance its stalled projects in the Niger Delta. Both parties signed
only a head agreement, Sumonu said. The final agreement is still
being negotiated. Total SA and ExxonMobil Corp. agreed to loan the
government $6.1 billion to cover the funding gap.
Sumonu denied that SPDC laid off more than 2,000 employees
due to soaring exploration and production costs and reduced output because of repeated attacks on its operations in the Niger Delta.
He said a review of Shell operations is still under way. ✦

Tr a n s p o r t a t i o n
Alaska looks toward intrastate gas line
Alaska has formed a public-private partnership to build an intrastate gas pipeline to serve south-central and interior Alaska.
The system would begin service in 2013 with a capacity of 460
MMcfd of gas—about twice current demand. The supply would
mainly come from undiscovered supplies in Cook Inlet, interior
basins along the pipeline, and the North Slope foothills, officials
said.
Construction would start at Cook Inlet and progress north along
the Richardson Highway for about 400 miles, reaching Fairbanks
and interior Alaska by 2013.
If sufficient supplies fail to materialize from the Cook Inlet and
Copper River basins and exploration along the pipeline, a second
phase would involve a leg to bring gas from the North Slope foothills.
If the second phase were not needed, the line could be connected to the pipeline planned to move North Slope gas to Canada and the Lower 48, officials said, when it is completed in
2018-20.
Forming the partnership were the Alaska Natural Gas Development Authority, Enstar Natural Gas Co., and the state, said Gov. Sarah Palin. She said specifics would be worked out this fall in time to
be added to appropriations legislation in January 2009. Construction would start in 2011.

ExxonMobil to position Adriatic LNG terminal
ExxonMobil Corp. plans in August to move the gravity-based
Adriatic LNG regasification terminal to the Adriatic Sea off Italy.
Construction of the 6-million-tonne/year terminal is nearing
completion, said Rex Tillerson, ExxonMobil chief executive.
It will be the world’s first offshore gravity-based regasification
terminal, with capacity to supply 10% of Europe’s LNG needs.
The company has developed Q-Max technology with Qatar Petroleum that increases the LNG ship cargo capacity by 80%.
Tillerson said a global LNG market will supply increasing energy demand but he stressed that energy efficiency was crucial also
because it extends the life of resources, reduces greenhouse-gas
emissions and energy prices, and strengthens energy security.
ExxonMobil has invested more than $1.5 billion on energy efficiency since 2004, has budgeted $500 million on additional initiatives over the next few years, and will work with vehicle manu10

facturers to develop transportation technologies that can improve
fuel economy and reduce emissions.

Fos oil terminal gets nod from port board
The Marseille Port Board approved construction of a seventh
mooring berth for refined oil products at the Fos petroleum terminal.
The investment will amount to €22 million, in addition to the
€32.7 million investment voted last November to build a sixth
mooring berth alongside the quay. This will increase the receiving
capacity of the Fos oil terminal to 21.5 million tons in 2011 from
6 million tons in 2006.
The latest expansion is dictated by the need to adapt the Fos
terminal to the increasing storage capacity of the Fos Oil Depots
(DPF) and creation of a new oil depot by OMM (Oiltanking-Mediaco), a joint venture of France’s Mediaco and Germany’s Oiltanking and subsidiary of Germany’s Marquard and Bahls, the world’s
second leading terminal storage group.
The seventh mooring berth will accommodate 45,000-ton vessels 200 m long and will provide a 12 m water draught. It will be
operational mid-2011.

Canadian oil pipeline capacity remains tight
Canadian oil pipeline systems need additional capacity soon to
accommodate growing supply and provide greater market flexibility, according to Canada’s National Energy Board.
“Capacity constraints on oil pipelines in Canada were evident in
2007,” said NEB Vice-Chair Sheila Leggett. “While there was some
spare capacity, periods of apportionment meant that some pipelines were at times not able to fully meet shipper demand.”
The high capacity utilization is driven by growing oil sands production and continued strong demand in the US. Although some
capacity will be added in 2008, tight conditions will likely exist for
the remainder of the year, officials said in their annual report on
the 45,000 km of oil, natural gas, and product pipelines regulated
by the NEB.
Most NEB-regulated gas pipelines have some excess capacity,
even during the peak winter season. Throughput for most gas pipelines declined in 2007 due to declining conventional gas supplies
from the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin, growing demand
within western Canada, and competition from other supply basins,
particularly in the western US. ✦

Two Minute Warning!
Polyguard announces
RD6 - OS coating
for offshore girth welds.
warning to our competitORS:
• Your girth weld coating takes 4 + minutes to install.
• RD6 - OS takes about 2 minutes.
• Effective immediately, your system may be obsolete.

ANNOUNCEMENT TO USERS OF
OFFSHORE GIRTH WELD COATINGS:
YOUR COATING QUALITY JUST WENT UP — FOR TWO REASONS
1. In offshore pipeline construction, the rule of thumb for a ‘quick lay’ of pipe is four minutes. That’s about the
time of a welding cycle. When the welding cycle is finished, the superintendent wants to pull the next joint.
If girth weld coating installation isn’t complete, it slows the whole job down. There is a lot of pressure to hurry,
and that can affect coating quality.
2. RD6 has demonstrated, in twenty years of use on Big Oil pipelines, that it is a non-shielding coating.
CP current could reach the pipe surface if the coating were ever to disbond from the pipe surface.

YOUR PROJECT COST JUST WENT DOWN — FOR FIVE REASONS
The five reasons are — five less installation steps. RD6 - OS requires no torch. This means no preheating the
steel, no heating the underlap, no heating the overlap, no heating the closure, no heating circumferentially around
the pipe, no heating until recovery is complete. Far less application steps… far less possibility for human error.
The truth is, the RD6 - OS coating will be finished before a torched coating is past the first step of steel preheating.

Challenge us to prove our two minute claim.
Call Chic Hughes at (713) 829-3709 for a demonstration.

On Nov. 29, 1997, OPEC agreed to
increase its production targets for the
first time in 4 years, which led to an
actual production rise of 500,000 b/d.
The combination of weaker demand and
greater supply eventually led to a huge
inventory build and falling prices.

Slow to react
But it wasn’t until late in the year
that prices declined even moderately,
and market reports from that period
suggest that observers were unconvinced that prices would decline significantly, Lynch says.
The oil market could face a similar
scenario in 2008, he says, if demand in
the second half of this year is weak, as
looks likely, and if supplies move higher
as a result of an increase in output from
Saudi Arabia, a ceasefire in Nigeria, and
recovery in Iraqi production.
The scenario would be especially
likely if demand weakness occurs in
areas where the data is reported late,
such as non-OECD Asia, because then
inventories could build strongly before
markets react, suppressing prices longer
than otherwise, Lynch adds.
With the combination of Saudi and
Iraqi oil surging, the possibility of a restoration of Nigerian production, as well
as rising OECD production, a significant
and growing surplus could occur.
Two factors will determine the extent
of the inventory build, Lynch says—
whether the oil goes to the US, where
it would be reported earlier, and how
quickly lower demand in non-OECD
regions becomes apparent. “And ultimately, how quickly the Saudis respond
by cutting production will influence
how far (and how fast) prices drop,”
Lynch says. ✦

Higher fuel costs loom
While recent increases in US gasoline and diesel
fuel prices result mainly from a global surge in the
price of crude oil, room must be reserved in any explanation for regulatory changes that have lifted the
costs of fuel manufacture and distribution. At present,
crude prices mask the effects of these changes. The
costs, however, are firmly in place. They set floors
below which the prices of oil products can’t stay for
long. And more of them are in prospect.
During the next few years, regulations will
evolve on at least three fronts in ways that will
keep upward pressure on the costs of vehicle fuels.
The ethanol mandate will grow. The requirement
for ultralow-sulfur diesel will expand, including
into off-highway markets. And new federal standards for ozone pollution will move some number
of regions toward, if not into, noncompliance.

Interacting effects
These developments interact. Ethanol, for example, aggravates ozone pollution in some areas.
Requirements for the gasoline additive, set in the
Energy Policy Act of 2005 and greatly increased in
last year’s Energy Independence and Security Act,
are increasing in annual steps. The mandate this
year is 9 billion gal, mostly from corn. Eventually
it will reach 36 billion gal, 15 billion gal of which
can come from corn.
The natural market for ethanol is reformulated
gasoline, where the material has value as an oxygen
and octane booster. Reformulated product, required
in areas with chronic ozone pollution, accounts for
about one third of US gasoline supply.
According to the Energy Policy Research Foundation Inc., Washington, DC, ethanol had saturated
the reformulated gasoline market by the end of
last year. To meet escalating mandates, it will have
to be blended into growing amounts of conventional gasoline. The result will be increased tailpipe
and evaporative emissions of ozone precursors—
another push toward noncompliance with airquality standards. An increase in the number
of such nonattainment areas would expand the
requirement for reformulated gasoline and further
raise the costs of making gasoline.
Growth of the ethanol mandate also portends
increased demand for diesel, the cost of mak-

ing which jumped in response to requirements
for sharply reduced sulfur content. Little ethanol
moves via pipeline because of the substance’s
affinity for water and potential to cause stress corrosion cracking of steel. Most ethanol transport,
therefore, occurs in trucks and rail cars.
While ethanol requirements, and therefore
diesel-fueled transportation, expand, so will application of the ultralow-sulfur mandate. In 2010,
refiners will lose their regulatory ability to produce as much as 20% of their highway diesel at
an elevated sulfur concentration. In the same year,
the ultralow-sulfur requirement will take in nonhighway uses other than locomotives and marine
engines. In 2012, those diesel users will enter the
ultralow-sulfur realm. And in 2014, exemptions
for small refiners will expire.
In terms of affected volumes, none of these
steps will be nearly as large as the one taken in
2006 when the ultralow-sulfur requirement for
highway diesel began taking effect. Each one nevertheless represents substitution of one grade of
fuel with another notably more costly to make.

Other changes
Other changes with potential to raise fuel costs
loom. The second phase of the Mobile Source Air
Toxic program administered by the Environmental
Protection Agency, for example, will begin taking
effect in mid-2011. The program, which provides
for the banking and trading of compliance credits,
mainly affects benzene. It applies a content cap for
reformulated gasoline but not for conventional
fuel—a distinction with possible cost implications
if requirements for the reformulated product grows.
And, despite federal efforts to suppress the proliferation of fuel specifications applied at state and
local levels, the boutique fuel problem remains
in place. Refiners still must deal with the reduced
flexibility that comes from having to produce fuel
to multiple sets of specifications.
With some exceptions, these and other regulations have improved the environmental performance of US vehicle fuels. They have, however,
raised the costs of making, and ultimately the retail
prices of, diesel and gasoline. More fuel changes are
just a few years away. So are higher costs. ✦

While US energy demand this year
will be limited by weak economic
growth and improved fuel-use efficiency, China, Latin America, and the
Middle East will sustain worldwide oil
demand growth despite high global
prices and keep pressure on supply.
The extent to which producers can
respond to the need for more oil in the
short run is inadequate to relieve prices.
US oil demand will contract this year, and demand for
natural gas and coal will get a
lift from increased power consumption. Hydroelectric power
and other renewable sources of
energy will also be in higher
demand in the US, although
they still represent a small share of the
energy market.

Energy demand takes
diverse paths in 2008

Demand in the OECD will contract
500,000 b/d from last year, as North
American consumption shrinks on economic weakness and demand in Europe
and Asia/Pacific holds steady.
China, with demand rising to 8 million b/d from 7.5 million b/d last year,
will lead demand growth outside the
OECD. Meanwhile, IEA expects demand
to rise 300,000 b/d in both Latin
America and the Middle East.
Declining OECD oil output will be
offset this year by a small increase in
non-OECD oil production outside the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, processing gain, and biofuels
production. This will leave total nonOPEC supply at an average 50 million
b/d for 2008.
OGJ forecasts that following first-

Midyear Forecast

Production of crude, condensate,
and liquids in the US will climb faintly,
but with demand waning, imports will
decline. US gas production will also
increase this year.

Worldwide outlook
Worldwide oil demand will increase
800,000 b/d this year, according to
estimates by the International Energy
Agency, and all of the growth will take
place in countries outside the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development.

quarter 2008 OPEC supply of 32.3
million b/d, oil output by the organization averaged 32.2 million b/d in the
second quarter and will rise to average
32.4 million b/d in the second half of
the year.
Although Saudi Arabia pledged last
month to increase output, any gain
will be negated by production declines
in Nigeria brought about by militant
attacks on production facilities and the
possibility of production cuts in other
OPEC countries.

ral gas liquids, worldwide oil supply
will average 87.4 million b/d this year,
resulting in a stockbuild of 600,000
b/d.

Oil prices
“As oil prices rose to $50, $70, and
$90/bbl, analysts often pointed out that
these prices hadn’t yet breached the alltime high in real, or inflation-adjusted,
terms,” said Stephen Brown, director of
energy economics and microeconomic
policy at the Federal Reserve Bank of
Dallas. “That barrier finally fell in early
March, when prices topped the real
1980 peak.”
Escalating worldwide oil demand,
propelled by climbing consumption
in developing countries, strengthened
competition for crude supplies. Limited spare crude production capacity
combined with supply disruptions and
declining output in some key exporting
countries to strain the amount of available crude.
In addition, a weakening US dollar
drew investment funds to oil and other
commodities as a hedge against inflation. Geopolitical tensions, including
the possibility of conflict between Israel
and Iran, continued to add upward
pressure to oil prices through the first
half of 2008.
In March, the closing price of the
front-month futures price of crude
on the New York Mercantile Exchange
surpassed $110/bbl. The futures
price closed at another record high of
$145.29/bbl on July 3. This compares
to a closing price of $71.41/bbl a year
earlier.
In June some countries, including
India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka,
and Taiwan, relaxed subsidies on fuels,
which had shielded their consumers from the pain of high prices and
blunted incentives to conserve. Easing
subsidies might suppress demand this
year but will have little, if any, impact
on world prices.
Also in June the world’s largest crude
supplier, Saudi Arabia, announced plans
to increase production. This news had
little impact on prices, though, as the

Source: International Energy Agency; OGJ estimates for OPEC 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quarter 2008 crude supply

incremental supply not only reduced
spare production capacity but also put a
greater volume of heavy, less-desirable
crude on the market.
OGJ forecasts that the 2008 US wellhead price of crude will average $110/
bbl, up from an average of $66.52/bbl
last year. Similarly, US refiner acquisition costs of domestic and imported
crude will climb to an average $108/
bbl from $67.93/bbl last year.

Product prices
Average retail gasoline and heating
oil prices in 2008 will reach record
levels for the 6th year in a row. Strong
worldwide demand propelled diesel

prices in the first quarter of this year
$1/gal higher than in the first quarter
of 2007 in the US.
Excluding taxes, the US refiner
price of highway diesel fuel climbed
to average $3.255/gal this March from
$2.055/gal a year earlier, according
to the latest figures available from US
Energy Information Administration.
Pump prices for motor gasoline have
followed crude prices upward as high
costs have depressed refining margins,
and refinery utilization rates held below
90% through the first half of this year.
Inventories of motor gasoline finished
the first half near the midpoint of the
5-year range.

OGJ forecasts that the pump price
for all types of gasoline in the US will
average $3.67/gal this year, including
taxes of 43.6¢/gal. Retail prices were
$2.849/gal on average last year, according to EIA.
The price of residential heating oil
excluding taxes will average $3.60/gal
this year, up from $2.59/gal last year,
OGJ forecasts. The price in the first 4
months of 2008 was 39% higher than
during the same 2007 period, EIA estimates show.

Natural gas prices
The average wellhead price of US
natural gas will surge to $10/Mcf from
$6.39/Mcf last year. The US is more
dependent on domestic supplies this
year as imports of LNG and pipeline gas
from Canada and Mexico are limited.
Strong electric power demand and
the potential for an active Atlantic hurricane season will keep a floor under
gas prices through the third quarter of
2008.
EIA preliminary estimates show that
for the first 5 moths of this year, the
wellhead gas price averaged $8.32/
Mcf.
At the end of trading on July 3,
2008, the price of gas for August delivery was $13.577/MMbtu, the highest
recent closing price since a late-2005
rally, when gas settled as high as
$15.378/MMbtu on Dec. 13, 2005.

US economy
OGJ forecasts that US gross domestic
product will grow 1% this year. The final report from the Bureau of Economic
Analysis revealed that first-quarter 2008
GDP grew 1% from the preceding
quarter.

Practical solutions to slow global warming
Whilst the world discusses the climate change and its consequences,
Linde has been developing concepts to significantly reduce energy
consumption and greenhouse gas emission in existing ethylene plants.
One of Linde’s innovative solutions is to replace the furnace section of a
cracker during a turnaround and thus install state-of-the-art technology in
an existing plant without any production loss.
This new Linde furnace technology reduces greenhouse gas emissions
while increasing yields and substantially improving reliability and economic efficiency.
Other innovative concepts customized to individual plant requirements are
available from Linde, the leading ethylene technology contractor.

SPECIAL

Federal Open Market Committee at its
latest meeting decided to keep its target
for the federal funds rate, which banks
charge each other for overnight loans,
at 2%.
The Fed said overall economic activity continues to expand, partly reflecting some firming in household spending. But labor markets have softened,
and financial markets remain under
stress. Also, tight credit, the housing
contraction, and the rise in energy
prices are likely to weigh on economic
growth over the next few quarters, the
Fed stated.
Last year’s GDP growth was 2.2%,
down from 2.9% a year earlier, slowed
by a meltdown in the housing and
credit markets. GDP growth in 2005
was 3.1%.
US energy use will grow slower than
the economy. Total energy demand in
the US this year will grow just 0.4%,
and energy efficiency will improve
to 8,735 btu/dollar of GDP from last
year’s rate of 8,784 btu/dollar.

Energy by source
US energy demand this year will
total 102.052 quadrillion btu (quads).
Although total demand is nearly unchanged from last year, there is a shift
in use among the sources.
Petroleum demand will decline, but
consumption of gas, coal, and renewable energy sources will climb. Demand
for nuclear energy will retreat from last
year’s record high.
Oil will still command the largest
share of the US energy mix, accounting for 38.2% of the market. Total use
will be 38.942 quads, a decline of 2.2%
from last year. Demand for all major
petroleum products will slump this year
as a result of high prices.

With demand at 24.47 quads,
natural gas will account for 24% of
the energy mix this year. In 2007, US
demand for gas totaled 23.64 quads.
Rising demand for gas in electric power
generation and by industrial users will
drive this year’s climb in gas use.
Coal demand will also increase,
though by only 1% to 23 quads, and
represent 22.5% of this year’s energy
consumption. Preliminary estimates
show that demand for coal by industrial
customers and electric power producers
grew sharply in the first half of 2008
from a year ago.
Nuclear energy’s share of electricity net generation has been nearly flat
for the past few years and will remain
so this year. OGJ forecasts that total
demand for nuclear energy will be 8.4
quads this year vs. 8.415 quads last
year, and nuclear’s share of the energy
market will be 8.2%.
All forms of renewable energy used
in the US this year, including hydroelectric power, will meet 7.1% of total
energy demand, up from 6.9% last year.
In the first quarter of this year, EIA estimates that hydroelectric power generation was down year-on-year from 2007
by almost 9%.
The renewable energy category also
includes solar, wind, geothermal, and
biomass. The use of biofuels and wind

Demand for LPG, including propylene, will decline 5% this year across
industrial, residential, commercial, and
transportation users, averaging 1.977
million b/d.
Demand for all other petroleum
products will average 2.71 million
b/d this year, down about 1.5%. These
products include asphalt and road oil,
petroleum coke, lubricants, pentanes
plus, petrochemical feedstocks, waxes,
and others.

US oil production
As it has each year since 2002, oil
production in Alaska will decline this
year. Last year Alaskan crude output
averaged 719,000 b/d, and EIA’s estimates for the first 5 months of 2008
show average production of 705,000
b/d, a nearly 7% reduction from the
corresponding 2007 period.
Oil production from the Lower 48
is getting a small boost from higher
output in Colorado, Louisiana, and
Texas.

condensate production this year will
average 5.12 million b/d, up from
5.103 million b/d last year. Production
of NGL and LRG will climb almost 4%
to average 1.85 million b/d.

Imports, exports
Because of declining demand for oil

in the US, imports will fall off last year’s
levels. Imports of oil products will
decline 5%, averaging 3.25 million b/d,
and crude imports will contract 3.1% to
9.7 million b/d.
US net imports will drop to 56.3%
of domestic demand for 2008, down
from 58.1% last year.

At end of June. 2Excludes Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
Source: US Energy Information Administration, 2006-2007. 2008, OGJ estimate

The source of the most US gross
imports of crude and products last year
was Canada, followed by Mexico, then
Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and Nigeria.
The US will export 1.55 million b/d
34

of crude and products this year, OGJ
forecasts, with most of this being oil
products. In 2007, the US exported an
average 23,000 b/d of crude and 1.37
million b/d of products.

Oil inventories
Crude and product stocks in the US
will be able to build by only a small
margin this year after closing 2007 at
uncomfortably low levels.
OGJ expects commercial oil stocks to
build less than 2%, putting inventories
of crude at 290 million bbl and product
stocks at 690 million bbl at yearend
2008.
Industry stocks of crude at the
midyear point stood at 300 million bbl,
down from 354 million after the first
half of 2007. Crude in the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve (SPR) totaled 706
million bbl, up 2% from the end of the
first half of 2007.
The Department of Energy will defer
about 2.1 million bbl of royalty-inkind exchange crude oil that had been
scheduled for delivery to the SPR this
summer in accordance with the Energy
Policy Act of 2005, which directs the
SPR to fill to its 1 billion bbl capacity.
The crude will be deferred until
March-May 2009, after the heating
season. Deliveries of about 2.8 million
bbl were not deferred and will continue
through this month, as shipment of
these barrels was under way and could
not be practicably deferred, DOE announced.
At the close of the first half of 2008,
distillate stocks were down almost 3
million bbl from a year earlier to 120.7
million bbl, as inventories of heating oil
were below their 5-year range, and diesel stocks were higher than their 5-year
range. Meanwhile, total gasoline stocks
were up more than 6 million bbl from
mid-2007 to 210.9 million bbl.

17.65 million b/d, OGJ forecasts.
A combination of factors is holding utilization relatively low this year,
including heavy maintenance during
the first half and weak refining margins in the face of high input costs and
weakening demand for gasoline.
Last year, US refinery utilization
averaged 88.5%, and in 2006, refineries ran at 89.7% of capacity on average,
down from 90.6% in 2005.
Following a stretch of healthy
margins, refining margins took a turn
downward after peaking in the second
quarter of 2007. Cash refining margins were down sharply for the first 5
months of 2008 compared with the
same 2007 period.
Especially hard hit were margins on
the US East Coast, where cash refining
margins averaged 73% lower than a
year earlier, according to Muse, Stancil,
& Co. Meanwhile, the average East
Coast cash margin for January 2008
was 82¢/bbl vs. a $10.04/bbl margin for refiners on the West Coast that
month.

For the first 5 months of this year,
the West Coast cash refining margin
averaged $14.99/bbl, down 46% from
a year earlier. And Gulf Coast margins
averaged $9.46/bbl, down 37% from
the first 5 months of last year.

Drilling on upswing in US as Canada pulls from slump
Alan Petzet
Chief Editor-Exploration
Oil and gas drilling is on the upswing in the US in 2008, and drilling
in Canada is coming back after slumping in 2007.
OGJ looks for the drilling of 7%
more wells in the US this year than last
and a slight gain in Canada.
The pace of drilling in the rest
of the world is up about 7% from
January through May 2008, according to international active rig
statistics.
Year over year gains for January through May were posted in
all geographic regions: Western
Hemisphere excluding the US
and Canada, Asia-Pacific, Africa,
Middle East, and Europe.
Here are highlights of OGJ’s
36

midyear drilling forecast for 2008:
• Operators will drill 50,475 wells
in the US, up from an estimated 47,057
wells drilled in 2007.
• All operators will drill 5,246 exploratory wells of all types, up from an
estimated 3,833 last year.
• The Baker Hughes Inc. count of
active US rotary rigs will average 1,840
rigs/week this year, up from 1,768 in
SPECIAL

Midyear Forecast

2007 and 1,649 in 2006.
• Operators will drill 18,605 wells
in western Canada, up from an estimated 18,391 wells in 2007.

World activity
The rest of the world excluding the
US and Canada had 1,058 rigs at work
at the beginning of June 2008.
That compared with 931 rigs working in all of Texas and 1,886 rigs
running in the US at the same
time.
Not a single country outside
the US and Canada averaged
even 100 rigs working in January through May 2008, according
to Baker Hughes. The closest was
Mexico with 99 active rigs. Indonesia averaged 83, Argentina 82,
Venezuela 81, and Saudi Arabia 78.
Algeria was the busiest country

in Africa, with 27 rigs running, and in
Europe the UK had 20, Romania 20,
and Norway 18.
A midyear survey by Lehman Bros.
indicated that a 20% increase in world
exploration and production spending
can be expected in 2008 (OGJ, June 16,
2008, Newsletter). This includes outlays
for project costs other than drilling.
The results implied a 15% spending hike in the US, 11% in Canada, and
22% in all other countries this year
even after companies overspent their
2007 budgets by $8.5 billion worldwide.

US plays
Shale and other unconventional gas
plays were claiming large shares of the
drilling in Texas and numerous other
states.
East Texas Dists. 5 and 6, with the
Jurassic Bossier and Cotton Valley and
other gas plays, led the state by averaging more than 300 rigs/week in the
first half of 2008 even before the Jurassic Haynesville shale play has a chance
to strengthen.
The Texas Railroad Commission
issued 355 permits for the drilling of
deep Bossier wells to 33 operators in
2007, compared with 291 permits in
2006.
Texas Panhandle counties averaged
75 rigs/week, up from 57 rigs in January through May 2007.
Oklahoma averaged about 200 rigs/
week through May compared with 180
a year earlier.
Colorado drilling averaged about
15% higher in the first half of 2008,
and the state had more than 100 rigs at
work in its far-flung basins. One operator, Williams Cos., Tulsa, was running
26 rigs in the Piceance basin at the end
of June.
With the Bakken shale oil play moving eastward, Montana’s rig count fell
to 11 rigs/week from 20 rigs/week in
2007 while North Dakota’s averaged
57 rigs/week versus 33. North Dakota
added 147 wells producing from the
Bakken in 2007, compared with 7 to
15 wells each for the state’s other oil

Petrobras revising projects for new business plan
Eric Watkins
Senior Correspondent
The chief executive officer of Brazil’s
Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras), revisiting proposed changes in the country’s
oil law, said the state firm will present a
new business plan later this year.
Sergio Gabrielli, speaking at the
4-day World Petroleum Congress in
Madrid, said the company is revising
25 projects to be included in the new
plan, which also would include developments in Brazil’s promising presalt
offshore area.
Gabrielli’s statement appears to differ
from an earlier decision by the government to withdraw 41 promising oil
blocks in the presalt area from a coming
exploration and production block auction.
According to reports, the blocks
were withdrawn while ministers consider changes in the country’s oil legislation that would guarantee a higher
percentage for the government from
crude oil production.
Under the current system, oil companies purchase a concession from the
Brazilian government to explore for oil
within the area of a defined block, often

in partnership with Petrobras.
As a reward for the risk being assumed, the state hands control of any
oil discovered to the operating companies and is paid royalties instead of oil.
According to analyst BMI, however,
“It would appear that many in the
Brazilian government now support the
implementation of production-sharing
agreements, under which hydrocarbon reserves remain state property and
international oil companies are given a
share of output.”
Gabrielli recently defended the
proposed revision of Brazil’s oil legislation, saying that the existing regulations
made investment so risk-free that it
was like purchasing a “winning lottery
ticket” especially since, in his view, the
exploratory risk is very low in the presalt area where blocks to be auctioned
off share geological conditions similar
to those where the previous discoveries
were made.
Echoing earlier statements by Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva,
who last year said that those blocks in
the presalt play that have already been
auctioned off won’t have their contract
terms changed, Gabrielli said Petrobras
was carefully considering the impact of

reform and that any rule changes would
apply only to new concessions, not
existing contracts.
That view was welcomed by ExxonMobil Corp. Chief Executive Officer
Rex Tillerson, who stressed the need for
regulatory stability in Brazil, given the
expected high cost to develop promising new oil fields in the country.
“Brazil’s government said it will honor
existing contracts,” said Tillerson at the
Madrid conference. “I’m pleased to hear
they will keep existing agreements.”
ExxonMobil has a 40% operating
stake in Brazil’s BM-S-22 block, which
is adjacent to the BM-S-9 block where
Petrobras has discovered oil in the Carioca and Guara wells. The BM-S-22 also
is near the Tupi find, where Petrobras
last year said it estimates reserves to be
as much as 8 billion boe.
“We’re still in the early stages of this
new play,” said Tillerson, underlining
the risks posed by his company’s investment. “Technologically, it’s going to be
one of the most difficult in the world,
and one of the most expensive.”
ExxonMobil, operator, holds a 40%
stake in the BM-S-22 block, Hess Corp.
holds 40%, and Petrobras holds the
remaining 20%. ✦

liquid energy converted from coal and
gas. Solar and wind energy sources are
emerging: biofuels, hydrogen, and so
on. Also China subsidizes oil prices.
Without the subsidies, consumption
will decrease.
At the same time, Yamani suggested
that under extreme conditions the price
could range even higher. “If the US or
Israeli forces attack Iran. If and only
if they attacked, the oil price would
go up to $200 immediately. The Strait
of Hormuz [would] be shut down by

Iran. I do not see the US attacking Iran,
based on logical thinking. But you never
know.”
The former minister noted that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries accounted for 70% of world
oil production in the 1970s but that
it now produces 40%. He said, “OPEC
reduced production and let prices rise,
placing a priority on profit. On the other hand, OPEC lost market share. OPEC
does not particularly take into account a
stable supply of oil in the world market

and stable oil prices. Those countries
are satisfied with high revenues. This attitude of OPEC has not changed.”
In defense of his own policies as the
Saudi oil minister, Yamani said he was
the only one at OPEC meetings “who
insisted on maintaining market share
and supplying enough oil to the world
market with lower prices. It was 1985
that Saudi Arabia stopped playing a
role as the swing producer, and OPEC
itself can no longer control the price of
oil.” ✦

Court overturns Texaco’s $100 million tax refund
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
A federal appeals court reversed a US
district court’s decision granting Texaco
Inc. a more than $100 million tax refund, the US Department of Justice said
on June 17.
It said that the US Department of
Energy originally cited Texaco for
selling petroleum products at a price
higher than government-mandated
ceilings during 1973-81. The company
settled the allegation and agreed to pay
$1.25 billion plus interest. It deducted
the settlement amount as ordinary and
necessary business expenses and sought
an additional $100 million refund under US Internal Revenue Code Section
1341, DOJ said.
Section 1341 is designed to provide
a taxpayer relief from having paid taxes
on income that the taxpayer is later
required to restore to a third party. It
does not apply to “any deduction allow-

able with respect to an item which was
included in gross income by reason of
the sale,” according to DOJ.
In its appeal of a finding by the
federal district court for California’s
Northern District, DOJ’s tax division
asked whether this exception to the
relief provision applies to all deductions
attributable to the sale of inventory or
only to sales returns, allowances, or
similar items. Texaco had argued that
the second condition applied and the
federal district court in Northern California had agreed.
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
sided with DOJ. It held that the exception’s plain meaning precluded Texaco’s
refund claim, noting that the federal
circuit court of appeals recently reached
the same conclusion in Pennzoil-Quaker State Co. vs. United States.
The Ninth Circuit Court also determined that, even if there was some
ambiguity in the statutory exception

(as Texaco argued), the court “would
be hard pressed not to defer to the
agency’s interpretation of the statute”
because the Internal Revenue Service’s
interpretation was reasonable.
Finally, said DOJ, the court noted that
although its interpretation of Section
1341 denied relief to certain taxpayers,
it was up to Congress, not the courts,
to revise the statute to “promote a more
equitable consequence.”
“The court’s decision is important
because it reaffirms the judiciary’s
respect for the language enacted by
Congress, and the deference owed to
the agency entrusted with enforcing
that statutory scheme,” said Nathan
J. Hochman, assistant US attorney
general in charge of DOJ’s tax division who argued the case in the Ninth
Circuit.
It was not immediately clear if
Chevron Corp., which acquired Texaco
in 2000, plans to appeal the latest decision. ✦

Last year, reports said Saudi capacity
increases during 2007-08 would come
from the three fields, pushing the total
to 11.4 million b/d by yearend 2008
from 10.8 million b/d currently (OGJ
Online, Apr. 20, 2007).
Looking farther ahead, Al Nasser said
his country’s output will increase by
an additional 900,000 b/d in fourthquarter 2009 when Aramco will bring
on stream its large-scale Manifa heavy
oil field, where construction is now
55% complete.
The field developments are part of
Saudi Arabia’s plan to raise its daily production capacity, including output from
the partitioned neutral zone shared
with Kuwait, to 12.5 million b/d of
crude oil by yearend 2009, from 11.3
million b/d now.

How to reduce prices
Al Nasser’s comments followed a 1-day
summit in Jeddah of the world’s top oil
producing and consuming nations, which
discussed ways to reduce crude oil prices
from the current $140/bbl.
Saudi Arabia’s oil minister Ali Al
Naimi told the Jeddah meeting that
his country plans to invest some $129
billion in oil exploration and production projects over the next 5 years and
to expand pumping capacity to as high
as 15 million b/d in the longer run, if
necessary.
Last month, Saudi officials acknowledged that the Khursaniyah oil field expansion project, which it had planned
to bring on stream last December, was
still not producing oil, but that much of
its 500,000 b/d capacity is ready.
According to Khalid al Falih, Aramco’s executive vice-president of operations, the delayed start-up was due to
problems in the construction of a gas
processing plant in the field. While the
Saudi national firm could bring on most
of Khursaniyah’s capacity if needed, according to Falih, he said the gas would
have to be flared—something Aramco
wanted to avoid.
“The gas plant is a major delay. It’s
really a disappointment,” Falih said. “All
of it will be ready in a few months.” ✦

EIA’s shortterm outlook

T

he US Energy Information Administration on July 8 increased
its predicted decline in domestic
petroleum consumption for 2008 by
100,000 b/d to 400,000 b/d in its
latest short-term energy outlook. It
cited prospects for a weaker domestic
economy and record high crude oil
and product prices extending into
2009, when it expects demand to remain “almost flat at the 2008 level.”
West Texas Intermediate crude,
which averaged $72/bbl in 2007, is
projected to average $127/bbl this
year and $133/bbl in 2009.
Worldwide, oil markets remain
tight as consumption continues to
grow despite 7 years of rising prices,
and production isn’t rising as quickly
as expected.
“Preliminary data indicate that
world oil consumption during the
first half of 2008 rose by roughly
520,000 b/d compared with year
earlier levels,” it said. The increase reflects a 170,000 b/d year-to-year gain
in the first 3 months, followed by an
870,000 b/d increase in the second
quarter, the monthly report indicated.

More than offset
“A 760,000 b/d decline in consumption in [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development]
countries during the first half of 2008,
mainly concentrated in the US, was
more than offset by a 1.3 million b/d
increase in non-OECD nations, led by
China and the Middle East,” it said.
EIA expects worldwide oil demand
to climb by almost 1.2 million b/d
during 2008’s second half in response to higher prices, less economic growth and growing pressure on
China, India, and other countries to

ease price subsidies. Global consumption could rise by 1.4 million b/d
in 2009 if Latin America and other
regions’ economic growth continues.
Demand would grow less if US financial strains spread.
Supplies are not growing as
quickly as originally anticipated,
especially outside the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
In early 2008, EIA predicted that
non-OPEC supplies would grow by
860,000 b/d this year and more
than 1.5 million b/d in 2009. It now
expects increases of 230,000 b/d in
2008 and 830,000 b/d next year,
primarily because of less production
from Russia and the North Sea and
lowered expectations for Brazil.

OPEC falls short
Production growth within OPEC
also has been less than expected, rising only 100,000 b/d from the first
quarter to an average 32.3 million b/d
in the second quarter. Nonetheless,
“higher production in Iraq and Angola
more than offset lower production in
Nigeria caused by security problems
and worker strikes,” EIA said.
If Saudi Arabia increases production
to 9.7 million b/d in July, as it promised, OPEC crude production could
average 32.7 million b/d during the
third quarter. That would leave available surplus capacity at 1.2 million
b/d, all held by the Saudis, it added.
Any industry operating at nearly
99% of capacity will remain vulnerable to surprises boosting consumption or disrupting production. EIA
observed. “Such surprises would
place additional upward pressure
on prices and contribute to oil price
volatility.” ✦

• ATP Oil & Gas Corp. acquired a
55% working interest in the Gulf of
Mexico’s Green Canyon Blocks 299 and
300, collectively known as Clipper.
• InterOil, the Canadian company
working in Papua New Guinea, sold its
retention leases in the western sector of
the country to concentrate on its potentially high yielding Elk-Antelope field in
eastern Papua New Guinea.
• ExxonMobil Corp. reported June

Plains-Chesapeake
Chesapeake said it plans to continue
acquiring leasehold in the Haynesville
shale, and Plains will have the right to

20% participation in any additional
leasehold.
The core area of the play spans 3.5
million acres in Texas and Louisiana,
Chesapeake told analysts in a conference
call.
Acreage on the Texas side may be
harder to lease, Chesapeake said. It did
not disclose the core area’s location
but expects core and noncore areas to
develop.
Chesapeake said average estimated
ultimate reserves in the core area are
estimated to average 4.5-8.5 bcf of gas
equivalent for each well.
A well in the play now costs $6.5
million. As with other shale plays, these
results are likely to improve over time.
The companies currently plan to
develop the Haynesville shale using
80-acre spacing, which could support
the drilling of as many as 6,875 horizontal wells on the leasehold.
Chesapeake is running five operated
rigs in the Haynesville shale play and
anticipates operating at least 12 rigs
by yearend 2008, at least 30 rigs by
yearend 2009, and as many as 60 rigs
by yearend 2010. Under this plan, the
companies anticipate drilling at least
600 wells in 3 years.

Quicksilver Resources
Quicksilver is acquiring production,
leaseholds, royalties, and midstream
assets in Tarrant and Denton counties of
Texas.
The properties have net production of 45 MMcfd of gas. Quicksilver
estimates that these properties hold 350
bcf of proved gas reserves, of which
40% are proved developed. Quicksilver
is paying $1 billion in cash and $307
million in common stock. The acquisitions are scheduled to close in August.
Upon closing, Quicksilver estimates
that its total average 2008 production
volume will increase to 275 MMcfd of

proposed by LNG Ltd. (LNGL), Perth.
LNGL and Arrow already have a
cooperation agreement for Arrow to
supply CSM feedstock from its Surat
basin fields to LNGL’s Gladstone project.
The two companies have discussions
in progress to increase capacity of the
first proposed LNG train to 1.5 million
tonnes/year from 1.3 million. A potential second train in Gladstone to be
added as further gas reserves are proved
would have a similar capacity.
In a rider to the Shell-Arrow agreement, Shell also will pay another $132
million (Aus.) to buy a 10% share in
Arrow International, which holds all of
Arrow’s overseas assets.
In addition, Shell will have a 5-year
option to back into any Arrow International project for 50% of Arrow’s
interest by paying 50% of past costs, although this excludes three CSM licenses
in India.
Shell will transfer senior management personnel into the projects,
establish a research and development
program, and reserve the right to offtake LNG produced from CSM feedstock
sourced from the Arrow-Shell permits.
Under the deal, Arrow will remain
operator of the upstream assets.
News of the Shell move comes on
the heels of the recent announced
agreement between Santos and Malaysia’s Petronas in which Petronas will
take a 40% interest in Santos’ proposed
Gladstone CSM-LNG project for $2 billion (OGJ, May 19, 2008, p. 32).

BG launched its bid of $15.50

Origin said it rejected the original
proposal after careful consideration
of all relevant information including
the fact that there appeared to be an
increasing appreciation of the value of
coal seam methane (CSM) assets.
Subsequent to this rejection the
company maintains it has seen a continued strong interest in the coal seam

A victory
for Colombia

C

olombia’s oil and gas industry
doubtlessly got a shot in the
arm last week when the Colombian
military completed a daring raid to
release some 15 hostages held by rebels of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC).
FARC rebels have flexed their
muscles a lot lately. Indeed, Colombia’s 780-km Cano Limon-Covenas
oil pipeline was shut down late last
month after FARC guerrillas dynamited it and stopped the transport of
some 100,000 b/d of oil.
But one wonders if such an attack was a sign of strength or one of
weakness—like the death throes of
a wild beast. Just a few months ago,
Colombian authorities struck hard
at FARC when they conducted a surprise raid into neighboring Ecuador.

ter as Colombia last week announced
an auction of exploration rights to
more than 100 blocks, according to a
senior official of the country’s hydrocarbons regulator, Agencia Nacional de
Hidrocarburos (ANH).
ANH director Armando Zamora
said the government will auction 100
small areas, some of which had been
returned to the government, and interested companies will have until the
end of August to apply for authorization to bid during the auction.

Encouraging to investors

The auction—also referred to as the
Second Ordinary Round 2008—will
offer mostly heavy oil blocks located
in the Upper Magdalena basin, the

early 2007 (OGJ, Mar. 30, 2008, Newsletter).
Both companies will study the
valorisation of the natural gas reserves
recently discovered by Eni off Brazil,
particularly in the Santos oil basin.
Brazil has proven oil reserves of
11.5 billion bbl and proven natural gas
reserves of 320 billion cu m. Hydrocarbon production, currently 2 million
b/d and about 12 billion cu m/year
of natural gas, will continue to grow
due to encouraging exploration results,
particularly offshore.
Eni has four offshore exploration
blocks in Brazil along with a 30-year
concession granted in 1999 to distribute natural gas in the northwest area of
São Paulo state. Over the years, Saipem
and Snamprogetti have jointly contributed to the building of numerous facilities in the oil sector, such as the refineries in Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre, and
São José dos Campos and some floating
production systems.

Gazprom
Under a memorandum of understanding signed in 2006, both parties
are committed to jointly developing
oil and gas projects in Algeria, Russia,
and third countries, including probable
swaps of assets and operations, with
exchanges of LNG and pipeline gas, for
efficiency.
“Possibilities for cooperation in the
area of joint acquisition of energy assets
in the territory of third countries, engineering and construction of facilities of
pipeline infrastructure were considered
as well,” Gazprom said.
This is the first time that Gazprom
has established a representative in
Africa. Deputy Chairman of the Management Committee of OAO Gazprom
Alexander Medvedev added that cooperation would cover all parts of the oil
and gas chain across Africa, including
exploration and production, processing, sales, environmental protection,
and energy efficiency. He said the office
would help Gazprom raise its profile in
becoming a global energy company. ✦

the field is redeveloped, previously
economic reserves will be left in the
ground.
Property owners of destroyed assets are faced with a decision: Should
the asset be abandoned along with its
future cash flow or should the asset be
redeveloped? Mature assets are unlikely
to meet the economic thresholds to
support redevelopment, and in the majority of cases, these structures will be
abandoned by owners.
In Part 2 of this four-part series, we
develop a model framework to forecast
the production and revenue streams
associated with the collection of destroyed assets. The general framework
of analysis is outlined along with the
assumptions employed in modeling.

its oil, gas, and BOE vectors, denoted
as: qo(s) = (q1o, q2o, ...), qg(s) = (q1g,

Economic limit and estimation techniques
When marginal costs exceed marginal revenues and the net cash ﬂow
for a structure is negative, the operator
is unlikely to continue production. Operations may be shut down temporarily
or permanently, depending upon the
producing status of the lease, whether
oil or gas is being produced, etc.

duce at marginal levels at a loss simply
to delay the cost of abandonment. The
decision criteria an operator employs
for a speciﬁc asset are ultimately
unobservable to analysts outside the
company, but this does not negate the
use of the economic limit as a proxy for
these criteria.

Economic limit

Estimation techniques

The economic limit is deﬁned as the
time when the direct operating cost
of the structure is equal to the income
under production.1
The economic limit criterion is
reasonable given proﬁt-maximizing
decision makers. In practice, an operator may shut-in wells before the
economic limit is reached if the return
on the investment does not satisfy a
given threshold or the operator decides
for strategic reasons to exit the region.
An operator may also produce for a
period of time after the economic limit
is reached if it intends to perform additional drilling on the property, can
postpone maintenance and workover
requirements, or believes prices will
increase to return the operations to
proﬁtability.
Because many structures in the Gulf
of Mexico are operated in aggregate
units (clusters) either on a ﬁeld or lease
basis, the cash ﬂow position of an
individual structure is often reviewed in
terms of its incremental impact to the
overhead position of the production
unit. An operator may continue to pro-

The economic limit of a structure can
be estimated based on its operating
cost or by using historical data to assess the revenue position of structures
at the time they stopped producing.
Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages. With expert
opinion, estimates can be performed
quickly and updated relatively easily.
The main advantage of historic data is
that we are measuring actual outcomes
that incorporate a broad set of random
events. Ultimately, the two approaches
are roughly similar in their level of
uncertainty.

the production drop as a fractional
power of the production rate and is
usually applied during the later stages
of the life cycle of a well. Harmonic
decline is often used to model gravity
drainage or water drive mechanisms.
For some fields, the production rate
may not be adequately modeled using
any of these function types.

Expert opinion
The EIA provides oil and gas lease
equipment and operating costs on an
annual basis for domestic oil and gas
production operations.2 EIA personnel
track equipment, labor, and maintenance cost, and categorize operating
costs on a location and production
basis. For the gulf, operating costs are
estimated for 12 and 18-well slot platforms with dual completions assumed
to be 50, 100, and 125 miles from shore

Structure classiﬁcation
For each structure, we fit each fluid
stream (oil, gas) to each of the three
model forms (exponential, harmonic,
hyperbolic) using regression techniques
and select the best-fit curve using the
maximum R2-value. The input to the
procedure is the structure’s historic production of oil and gas, and the output
is the model parameters for the best-fit

(corresponding to water depths of 100,
300, and 600 ft, respectively). Maximum crude oil production is assumed
to total 11,000 b/d and maximum
associated gas production is assumed
to be 40 MMcfd. Meals, maintenance,
helicopter and boat transportation,
communication, insurance, and administration are included in expenses;
water disposal costs are not included.
Table 1 provides operating cost estimates for offshore wells displayed by
platform size and water depth. On a
per-well basis, operating costs range
from $621,000/well to $802,000/well.

Historical data
In the threshold level approach, the
revenue of structures at the time of
their abandonment is quantiﬁed relative to a set of attributes. Structures
are grouped according to type (caisson, well protector, ﬁxed platform),
primary production (oil, gas), and site
characteristics (water depth). Inﬂationadjusted averages are computed across
each categorization based on structure
removals in the gulf over the past two
decades.3 We associate the economic
limit of a producing structure with its
category average (Table 2).
Caissons and well protectors
generally support three wells or less,
while ﬁxed platforms support several
wells throughout their lifetime. Near
abandonment, most structures will be
producing from a small set of wells.
When normalized on a per well basis,
there is general agreement between
the expert opinion values in Table 1 and
the historic data presented in Table 2.

decline curve for each hydrocarbon
stream. If the model fit for qti(s) has an
R2-value that exceeds 0.75, the model is
considered an acceptable fit and a reasonable predictor of future production.
We refer to structures that satisfy this
criterion as “normal” producers.
A small number of structures have
production profiles that do not yield
an acceptable bestfit curve. If R2 <0.75

for the oil or gas stream, the model fit
is deemed unacceptable and simplified
techniques are applied to generate the
forecast curve. In this case, we repeat
the curve fitting procedure from the
second-half of the production profile.
In other words, if a structure is T
years old at the time of observation,
then we model the second-half of the
production history, using data beginning in year T/2. If the reduced time
horizon model does not satisfy R2
>0.75, then we assume an exponential
model based on the structure’s historic
decline rate. Structure profiles with
initial R2 <0.75 are referred to as “chaotic” producers.
Structures that are early in their life
cycle present a special problem, since
production has probably not peaked
and remains largely unknown. Forecasting lost production from early producers, say within 7 years of first production, are subject to a large amount of
uncertainty.
For this subset of producers, we
make a conservative estimate that
production has peaked over the time
horizon observed and declines following the exponential model according to
a specified decline rate that is held fixed
across time. Structures that are within 7
years of first production are classified as
“young” producers.
“Idle” structures refer to structures
that were not producing at the time of
their destruction. Idle structures are
unlikely to restart production or to be
redeveloped at a later time. We consider
any structure inactive prior to 2003
incapable of future production. Nearly
a quarter of the hurricane-destroyed
structures was idle in 2003.
“Uneconomic” structures are producing structures with revenue streams
in 2006 that have already fallen below
their estimated economic threshold.
When the revenue stream generated
by production falls below a structure’s
economic threshold, the operator will
stop producing.
About 20% of the active structure set
was uneconomic in 2006.

*Structures are classiﬁed as oil or gas producers according to their cumulative GOR measured in cubic feet per barrel.
Structures with GOR ≤5,000 are primarily oil producers; structures with GOR >5,000 are primarily gas producers. Idle
structures were not producing in 2003 and are assumed not to produce in the future. Uneconomic structures have
revenue streams that fall below their economic threshold in 2006. Normal structures were ﬁt by decline curves with
R2 ≥0.75. Young structures have less than 7 years production and are forecast using exponential decline curves and assumed decline rates. Chaotic structures have initial best-ﬁt decline curves with R2 <0.75 and are forecast from the later
half of their life cycle or through exponential decline curves and historic decline rates.

cial is determined by comparing the
revenue in year t, rt(s), to the economic
limit of the structure, τa(s), yielding
Ta(s) as shown in Equation 5.
The value of the revenue threshold
τa(s) is derived from empirical relations
using historical data and is correlated
with structure characteristics such as
development type (caisson, well protector, fixed platform), primary production (oil, gas), and site characteristics
(water depth).
The values of the economic limit
represent category averages based on
statistical analysis of over 1,500 structures removed in the Gulf of Mexico
over the past two decades.3 Ta(s) determines the time—for a given production
forecast, price deck, and revenue threshold—that a structure will no longer be
commercial (economic). At t = Ta(s), a
rational operator will stop producing,
which will terminate the cash flow vector: r(s) = (r1, r2, ..., rT (s)).

Cumulative production and

The cumulative production Q(s) and

with each structure is computed from
2006 (t = 1) through the time of abandonment (t = Ta(s)) as shown by Equations 6 and 7. In the valuation estimate,
D denotes an industry-wide discount
rate employed for each structure.
The choice of D has a significant
impact on the value of lost production
and the redevelopment decisions of
operators. Each company uses its own
rate to guide decisions, which may be

money plus the cost of dividends, the
return from the least profitable investment, etc. For our purposes, since we

Analysis of whole core from the

Meanwhile, using its own rig the

ft of net reservoir but only 1.5 ft of net

No rates were measured, but the volumes of oil and gas recovered strongly
suggest that the earlier calculation of
net hydrocarbons is too conservative,
the company said. The well continued

BP is developing a
minor sand reservoir in
the Prudhoe Bay field
after appraising the potential by recompleting
existing wells, building

models, and running VIP
simulations. BP began production of the
southern lobe of the Putuligayuk (PUT)
River in late 2006.
This article includes a brief background of the Putuligayuk (PUT)
River reservoir, including geological
description and production history. It’s
followed with an analysis of the flow
simulation work undertaken to design
the pattern flood at PUT River.
The concluding article (OGJ, July
28, 2008) will describe a top-down
reservoir modeling process (TDRM)
used to assess the impact of reservoir
uncertainty on ultimate oil recovery.1 It
also presents the field implementation
of the pattern flood, along with field
observations.

sands when the major fields are mature
offers an incentive because production
facilities usually are readily available
and underutilized. However, it’s difficult
to develop minor sands economically.
The uncertainty in reservoir parameters
must be fully evaluated before implementing any development plan—before
any cost is incurred—since even a slight
error in uncertainty assessment can
make the field development
program uneconomic.
The PUT River sand is a
minor reservoir with four
identified lobes in the Prudhoe Bay field.
The southern lobe,
with an estimated OOIP of
12.6-19.2 MMstb, is the most suitable
sand for development. Only a few wells
can be economically justified, however,
as few as one to two new wells or as
many as five recompletions of existing
wells. The proposed location of the new
wells is critical.
In addition to location and siting,
well performance will also depend on

oil sample from the well 2-23A.3 We
used a constant initial water saturation
of 35% in the model, and set the initial
pressure to 4,163 psia.
Fig. 8 displays the field average pressure and cumulative oil production
match. Fig. 9 presents a comparison
of oil production rates for the well
02-23A. Figs. 8 and 9 show that the
simulation results match favorably with
field data. Some of the variation in
matching 02-23A oil rate is caused by
metering error.
We also conducted a forecast run on
primary oil recovery in two existing producers, 02-23A, and 02-27. The oil production rate and cumulative oil recovery
data indicate that ultimate oil recovery is
marginal under primary mode.
A more prudent approach to PUT
River reservoir development will be to
implement secondary pressure maintenance through a balanced waterflood.
The target average reservoir pressure
should be above the bubblepoint pressure to limit the release of solution gas
from the oil in the reservoir. ✦

to neutralize the alkalinity.
As a result, the process produces
effluent water with a pH that can be
directly discharged without any adjustment.
By contrast, most ion exchange
systems (if not all) currently deployed
in the CBM field use strong acid cation
(SAC) resins, which have lower operating capacities and require 100-200%
stoichiometric excess of acid to regenerate. (See reactions box.)
While capacities of SAC resins are
enhanced in the alkalinity neutralization
function, they still do not match the
high capacities or near stoichiometric
acid requirements of WAC resins. WAC
resins, however, have characteristics that
make the system design very special.
The benefits of WACs include high
capacity, virtually 100% acid utilization
resulting in no acid wasted, effluent pH
within discharge limits.
A negative is that WACs expand
80-90% upon exhaustion.
With high bicarbonate-level associated sodium, the most efficient means
to remove sodium is with a weak acid
cation resin, regenerated with sulfuric
acid. The existing technologies minimize waste with what may be called
dynamic system design. Either the resin
or the resin bed is moved to optimize
rinsing cycles. Such systems would
need to be redesigned to cope with
large variations in the resin volume or
density, thus they currently use strong
acid cation resins.
This single design limitation forces
the forfeiting of 50% or more of
maximum possible capacity from a
volume of resin. Additionally, strong
acid resins require stoichiometric excess
of 100-200% acid for regeneration,
producing an acidic waste, requiring
neutralization.

The primary advantage of the
process is evident during the regeneration procedure. The processe uses three
storage tanks to break the regeneration

During the first cycle, the process

No chlorides
The recently installed plant has a
30,000-b/d capacity and can operate
24 hr with remote web-based controls.
The use of sulfuric acid further helps
meet upcoming stringent chloride limits in the Powder River basin.
Hydrochloric acid use for ion exchange regeneration by other systems
may produce leakage of chlorides that
may not meet discharge standards.

Minimal environmental impact
The fixed-bed dynamic flow ion
exchange system was designed for
long-term large-scale implementation. Average electrical conductivity in
the Powder River is 1,900 μsec/cm.
Discharging large volumes of water into
the river can affect the overall salinity
of the river. There are concerns from
wildlife conservation specialists that
certain organisms have evolved to exist
in this level of sodium and salinity. If
the produced CBM water is purified
beyond the levels of sodium in the river,
it is postulated such wildlife would be
affected adversely.
As shown in Table 2, sodium bicarbonate dominates the water analysis;
hence, a sodium-removal approach
on the entire stream would desalinate

therefore, to design the plant with an
automated, proportionally controlled
blending valve. The process aims to
discharge water with sodium levels
close to existing levels in the river. This
approach has two benefits:
• It reduces the total water volume

treated, thereby improving treatment
economics.
• Within the next year, when more
than 120,000 b/d will be discharged
into the river, the overall sodium level
in the river will not be disturbed.

(slow) components to be collected in
a second stream. In natural gas treating, CO2, hydrogen, helium, H2S, and
water vapor are highly permeable gases,
sometimes characterized as “fast” gas
molecules that permeate to a greater extent across the membrane to the lower
pressure side than do the “slower” gases
(i.e., hydrocarbons).
The permeate gas will have a higher
concentration of the fast gases and a
lower concentration of the slow gases,
relative to the feed. The gas that remains
on the higher pressure side, also called
the residual gas, will be depleted in the
fast gas components relative to the feed
gas.
The driving force for permeation
is the difference in partial pressure of
a given component between the feed
(high pressure) side and the permeate
(low pressure) side of the membrane.
The greater the partial-pressure difference, the greater the driving force.6
A simple mathematical representation (accompanying equation box) can

illustrate gas transport across a membrane.6 The permeability coefficient, K,
is a function of both the solubility and
the diffusivity of the gas in the polymer
matrix. Several mathematical models are
available that derive the permeability
coefficients.7 8
Membranes have two performance
characteristics that determine methane
product recovery and purity: permeation rate and selectivity.
Permeation rate or flux is the rate at
which a gaseous component can diffuse
through the membrane medium to the
low-pressure side. The rate of perme-

EQUATION
ν = KA (P1–P2)

ation for each component is determined
by the following:
• The characteristics of the component.
• The characteristics of the membrane.
• The partial pressure differential
of the gaseous component across the
membrane.
Since the permeation rate for CO2 is
greater than for methane, increased flux
through the membrane will increase the
methane product purity, but decrease
the methane recovery in the residual
gas stream. Selectivity refers to the ratio
of the permeation rates of a fast gas
(CO2) and a slow gas (methane or other
hydrocarbon). The selectivity of CO2 to
methane determines the efficiency of the
separation and the methane recovery.

with the changes in feed conditions and
the natural membrane aging:
• Membrane area of first and second
membrane stage.
• Temperature of first and second
membrane stage feed gas.
• Pressure of first and second membrane stage feed gas.
• Pressure of first and second membrane stage permeate gas.
• Replacement of those membranes
that have reached the ends of lives, in
first or second membrane stage.
Table 2 illustrates the qualitative
impact of the operating parameters on
the overall two-stage membrane system.
The impact, in absolute terms, of each
of these parameters will vary. In combinations of different parameters, therefore, each of them will weigh more or
less on the overall performance. Note
that other factors, such as permeate
compressor capacity limitations, need
to be taken into account as well.
Table 2 shows that the following
parameter adjustments always have a
positive effect, both on sales-gas CO2
content (decreased) and on hydrocarbon recovery (increase): feed pressure
increase, permeate pressure decrease, as
well as membrane replacement.
The following describes the impact
of the operating parameters, independently.

First, second-stage area
With an increase in the first-membrane stage area, the unit can handle
a constant feed flow rate and produce
sales gas with a lower CO2 concentration or can handle a higher feed flow
rate producing sales gas with the same
CO2 concentration.
In the former case, the throughput
feed gas to the second membrane stage
will increase. If the permeate compressor capacity is not limited, a higher
flow richer in CO2 will be recycled
back to the first membrane stage. The
second-stage permeate gas flow rate
will slightly increase. (Hydrocarbon
losses increase as a lower sales-gas CO2
spec is reached.)
An increase in second-membrane-

stage area will result in a second-stage
residue with a lower CO2 concentration
and thus also a lower CO2 concentration
in the first membrane-stage feed gas and
in the sales gas. A higher membrane area
will allow not only a higher CO2 permeation flow but also a higher methane
permeation flow and thus an absolute
increase in vented hydrocarbons.

First, second-stage feed temp.
The permeability of gases generally
increases with increasing temperature.
The permeability for carbon dioxide,
however, increases at a lower rate than
methane and other hydrocarbons with
an increasing temperature. This means
that selectivity for carbon dioxide over
methane decreases as the operating
temperature increases. Consequently,
methane-product recovery (hydrocarbon recovery) will decrease, while
purity (sales-gas CO2 content) will
increase as the operating temperature
increases, all other operating conditions
being constant.

First, second-stage
feed pressure
The increased pressure creates a
greater driving force across the membrane and results in a net increase in
permeation through the membrane.6
The membrane area requirement
therefore drops or, for a fixed mem-

brane area, a lower CO2 concentration
in the sales gas/recycle stream will be
reached.

First, second-stage
permeate pressure
A decrease in permeate pressure
increases the driving force across the
membrane and results in a net increase
in permeation through the membrane.
The membrane area requirement therefore drops or, for a fixed membrane
area, a lower CO2 concentration in the
sales gas will be reached. On the other
hand, a lower amount of hydrocarbons
will permeate, which translates in a
higher hydrocarbon recovery.
A decrease of the second-membranestage permeate pressure will result in
a decrease in amount of hydrocarbon
permeating through the second membrane stage and thus in a better overall
hydrocarbon recovery.

First, second-stage
replacement
An aging membrane element can
show declining selectivity. This means
that more methane permeates at a fixed
CO2 permeation. Consequently, more
hydrocarbons are lost, and the load on
the permeate compressor (in the case of
a first-membrane-stage decline) increases. Therefore, a membrane at its end of
life will need to be replaced.

Membrane systems are built modularly and systems can thus be easily and
partially isolated. After replacement of
a high number of membrane elements,
a step change in plant performance
becomes apparent:
• An increased selectivity of the firststage membranes translates in a lower
permeate compressor load.
• An increased CO2 permeation rate
permits reduction in the first-stage
membrane area or an increase in the
first-stage permeate pressure.
• An increased selectivity of the
second membrane stage translates into
a lower hydrocarbon content in the
vented second-stage permeate gas and
thus a higher hydrocarbon recovery. It
also leads to a lower CO2 concentration
in the recycle stream; this also results in
a lower CO2 content in the sales gas.
In conclusion, a (partial) membrane
replacement effort is completed only
after the operating parameters of the
membrane system are fine tuned in
order to reach the correct sales-gas
specification, while maximizing the
hydrocarbon recovery.

Adjustment to operational
changes
The following parameters have been
tested at Salam gas plant in order to
cope with the changing feed conditions (CO2 content and flow increase)
as well as with the normal aging of the
membranes:
• In August 2006, the secondmembrane-stage area was increased by
20%. This resulted in a decrease of the
CO2 content in the sales gas. In the first
membrane stage, an increase of membrane area has not been envisioned.
• To determine the optimum
second-membrane-stage operating temperature, operators gradually increased
the feed temperature of the second
membrane stage with continual monitoring of CO2 content in the secondstage permeate gas and in the sales gas.
As expected, it was found that with
an increase in the feed temperature of
the second membrane stage, the CO2
concentration in the second stage resi74

due gas decreased and with it the CO2
concentration in the feed gas to the first
membrane stage. But also observed was
that the amount of hydrocarbons lost
through the second membrane stage
permeate increased.
Increasing feed-gas temperature in
the first membrane stage hasn’t been
implemented at Salam gas plant due to
permeate compressor capacity limitation and the objective to maximize
hydrocarbon recovery.
• In 2007-08, membrane elements
have been replaced in both the first
and second stages. Replacement of the
membrane elements in the second stage
did result in a significant decrease of
the CO2 content in the sales gas to 3.8%
mol from 4.7% mol. First stage membrane replacement is still under evaluation.
• The deeper CO2 cut (to 3.8% from
8.5% compared with design of 3%
from 6.34%) has resulted in a higher
load on the permeate compressor.
Excess first-stage permeate (exceeding
the compressor capacity) is flared and
results in additional hydrocarbon losses.
• In terms of permeate pressure,
design plant operating conditions are
based on the lowest possible permeate pressure. A temporary increase of
80% of the permeate pressure has been
tested on the second stage, resulting in
a significant increase in hydrocarbon
losses.
• Feed pressure increase has not
been tested at Salam gas plant.

304.9 bcf of working-gas capacity and
17.5 bcfd of withdrawal capacity (Table

16%.
Part 1 of this article (OGJ, July 7,
2008, p. 74) examined the basis shifts
already under way and expected as a
result of ongoing pipeline construction
in the Texas Gulf Coast. This concluding
article reviews each announced storage facility, examines the possibility of
overbuild, and summarizes the most
likely storage development scenario for
the Southeast US-Gulf Coast.
Fig. 1 shows the timing of new
storage deliverability additions (new
withdrawal capacity). Completion of an
initial group of projects should occur
during 2008. Construction of most
of these facilities has been under way

in storage development costs, various
permitting problems, and a reduction
of natural gas’ forward summer-winter
differential will likely result in delay of
some projects into 2009.
The less likely to be completed
group of facilities shown in Fig. 1,
currently scheduled for completion in
2009-10, will be subject to a continuation of the factors delaying some of the
2008 projects. These later projects also
must overcome two key factors increasing the risk of storage development in
the region:
• The development and promotion
of many of them was based on service
as a sink for surplus LNG expected to
arrive at new and existing terminals
in vast quantities during the summer
season, when the global supply-demand
balance would push surplus cargoes
to the US. Recent developments in the
LNG market suggest this LNG supplypush scenario is unlikely to develop in
the near term, resulting in a decrease in
LNG imports over the next 1-2 years.
Absent the driver of LNG storage injections, the economics of storage development in 2009-10 may suffer.
• Financial investors and storage
developers are backing many of the
storage projects, rather than traditional
storage players such as LDCs or utilities.
These new market participants evaluate
storage projects through rate-of-return,
rather than as support for an underlying
business. As any development problems
and economic issues become recognized in the market, these financial
players will likely cut their losses.
The market for facilities in the development stage may also quickly become
glutted, resulting in reduced storage
values and a deterioration of the environment for new storage construction.

withdrawal capacity scheduled to enter

in Louisiana stands at 3.2 bcfd,2 the
new storage facilities therefore boosting
Louisiana’s salt dome storage deliverability by almost 160%.
Other potential withdrawal capacity is also under development in the
region. The two new Louisiana LNG import terminals—Cheniere Energy’s Sabine Pass terminal and Sempra Energy’s
Cameron terminal—have regasification
and sendout capacity of 3.6 bcfd. To the
extent LNG inventories are held in storage to move into the market to capture
maximum prices, LNG volumes will
behave like other natural gas storage.
Including the two new Louisiana
LNG import terminals into the total
withdrawal capacity for the state pushes
the increase in incremental deliverability to 6.8 bcfd, almost double total
existing deliverability out of all salt
dome and depleted reservoir facilities in
the state.
Various industry participants have
argued whether this huge investment in
storage represents overbuilding. Those
rejecting the view that storage is being
overbuilt base their arguments on two
premises: many of these announced facilities will be delayed or cancelled, and
the sporadic nature of LNG deliveries
necessitates increased Southeast US-Gulf
Coast storage. These points, however, do
not preclude the risk of overbuilding.

These additions combined imply new incremental deliverability of

from four new terminals in Texas and
Louisiana. Even with a large number
of cancellations, therefore, additions to
regional deliverability will be large.

deliveries in the Southeast US-Gulf
Coast region during high withdrawal
periods. Constraints on outbound
capacity from the region could restrict
total deliverability from storage and
pipeline sources, particularly for storage
facilities competing with LNG terminal
sendout on the Gulf Coast and storage
facilities in Southeast Texas remaining somewhat constrained by pipeline
capacity across the Sabine River into
Louisiana.
Increased deliverability from the new
salt-dome storage facilities will also
increase the market’s ability to capture
price peaks, effectively capping peak
shaving trading opportunities critical to
extrinsic storage economics (described
later in this article). When prices start to
spike, the crowd of new storage players
will tend to sell into the increase, limiting it and dampening price volatility. A
more viable source for extrinsic storage
economics of Gulf Coast salt dome
facilities will likely become trough
trolling.3 The opposite of peak shaving, trough trolling uses multicycle
storage to inject gas during periods of
depressed prices and withdraw it after
supply and demand return to a more
normal balance.

Intrinsic, extrinsic
Twenty-six of the 31 new storage projects are high-deliverability,
multiturn, salt-dome facilities being
developed primarily to capture extrinsic
storage economics; the trading value
associated with short term price fluctuations. Many of these facilities have
moved forward as a necessary means of
absorbing sporadic LNG imports and
were designed to trough troll when
LNG oversupply would distress gulf
pricing, and peak shave when winter
weather, hurricanes, or similar events
resulted in price spikes.
The likelihood of any of these scenarios occurring has been diminished
by the combined impact of a “deliverability overbuild” and a lower probability of large increases in LNG imports. A

more likely scenario over the next few
years combines:
• A substantial increase in pipeline
capacity into the Southeast US-Gulf
Coast region.
• A steady increase in production
filling that capacity.
• Continued constraints on deliverability out of the region.
• Modest LNG imports.
Lower volatility, steadily increasing
supplies, and periodic constraints on
outbound capacity—factors more favorable to storage developed to optimize
intrinsic storage economics (the difference between seasonal market prices)—
would characterize this scenario. Such
storage usually consists of larger, lowercost, depleted reservoir facilities.
Intrinsic economics as measured by

seasonal differences in the forward
curve for natural
gas have shifted
during the past
few months.
Fig. 2 shows the
difference between the NYMEX
quarterly strip for
third quarter and
first quarter from
Nov. 1, 2007, to
the present, showing three seasonal

spreads:
• Third-quarter 2008 vs. first-quarter
2009 (blue).
• Third-quarter 2009 vs. first-quarter
2010 (pink).
• Third-quarter 2010 vs. third-quarter 2011 (green).
Near the end of 2007, the third-quarter 2008 vs. first-quarter 2009 spread
dropped to $0.80/MMbtu from $1.10/
MMbtu, a 27% decrease in the implied
intrinsic value of storage for the period.
At about the same time, the seasonal
spread for third-quarter 2009 vs. firstquarter 2010 declined to $0.60/MMbtu
from $0.90/MMbtu before recovering to
near $0.80/MMbtu the week of Apr. 21,
2008. Third-quarter 2010 vs. first-quarter 2011 spread mirrored the previous
years, before separating by about $0.10/
MMbtu over the past
few months.

New hydrogen sulﬁde analyzer
The new Model 903 hydrogen sulfide
tape analyzer is designed to measure as
many as four streams of H2S and total
sulfur in gaseous streams.
It has a 20 sec response time.
New capabilities include:
• 0-2,000 ppm range without dilution.
• Linearity and repeatability of ±1% of
full scale.
• 5-15 week tape life.
• Overrange and multirange measurement.
Operators can measure the extent to
which H2S exceeds preset alarm levels as
well as use the quick response H2S analyzer
in new, higher ppm applications.
In addition, the analyzer can read
samples from different ranges. This
multi-range capability replaces the need
for separate analysers calibrated each for
separate streams. Other features include
built-in modbus communications/RTU
capabilities, a greater number of outputs

SUBSURFACE MAPS

DE -MYSTIFIED

The key to effectively using subsurface maps is
to know what you are investigating and what
map types are most appropriate. Doing this
will allow you to visualize various geologic
and hydrologic features in any dimension
from a one-dimensional cross section to a 4-D
production map.
Jonathan C. Evenick’s Introduction to Well
Logs and Subsurface Maps is a must-have for
professionals like geologists, geophysicists,
and environmental consultants. It introduces
different types of geophysical logs and
subsurface maps that can be generated from
basic well data, and subsurface problems
that can be solved using geophysical logs and
subsurface maps.

WHAT YOU’LL FIND
• Introduction to basic well logs and
subsurface maps.

NOW
AVAILABLE!
Introduction to Well Logs
& Subsurface Maps

• Applied projects that allow users to
critique computer-generated maps
and data.
• Hands-on exercises showing how each
map type is generated and what
applications they have.

Deﬁning “energy” with technical precision is difﬁcult, of course. Deﬁning the
word politically is impossible.
Technically, energy relates to the ability to perform work and transfer heat.
Engineers and physicists discuss it in terms

such as ergs, joules, and degrees.
In politics, “energy” means whatever
anyone needs it to mean. This ﬂexibility
frees political discussion of worry about
the physical world’s thermodynamic constraints. The basic political terms applicable
to energy include dollars, euros, and yuan.
Despite these contrasts, parallel laws do
seem to be at work.
The physics of energy, for example, concerns itself with shifts between varying degrees of energy usefulness. It employs tools
such as engines, turbines, and batteries.
The politics of energy concentrates on
shifts, too: of money. Its tools are taxes,
mandates, and subsidies.
Like energy, politics has useful and useless states. Also like energy, politics seems
drawn by some natural law in the direction
of uselessness.
Observation makes clear that as rhetorical heat rises in a political system addressing energy, disorder overwhelms discussion, degrading the consequent ideas.
Evidence of this political version of
entropy abounds. It includes proposals to
outlaw “price-gouging,” to rein in the supposed excesses of “speculators,” and to tax
hydrocarbons in order to fund energy of
lesser utility.
Energy politics has its peculiarities.
In physics and engineering, attention to
energy is constant.
In politics, attention to energy—rhetorical heat—varies as a function of the price of
vehicle fuel. And since the quality of political ideas for energy varies as an inverse
function of rhetorical heat, it follows that
the risk of policy error rises with prices of
gasoline and diesel fuel.
Price levels exist, however, below which
political attention and therefore rhetorical
heat seem to vanish.
Such a political state, of zero attention to
energy, might seem like the good old days.
But political inattention of the past helps
explain energy prices of the present, suggesting that politics, like energy, changes
only in form, never in quantity.

Chinese demand pushes oil prices higher
Increased energy consumption in China and other developing countries is outstripping demand destruction in the US and Europe and is pushing oil prices still
higher, analysts said.
Total energy consumption around the globe was up 2.4% in 2007, slightly lower
than the 2.7% increase in 2006 but still above average. “With China accounting for
more than half the total world increase, it is hard to see much slowdown, even with
more recent declines in Eurozone and US consumption,” said David Wyss, Standard
& Poor’s chief economist.
Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight Inc., Waltham, Me., expects
crude prices to hit $160/bbl by December and remain high for 6 months before
falling as global demand eases. “First and foremost, the growth in both real gross
domestic product and energy demand in emerging markets is likely to remain strong
for some time,” he said. “While some countries are beginning to tighten monetary
policy and some are cutting fuel subsidies, these moves have been modest and
are unlikely to have any signiﬁcant impact until late 2009 or 2010. In the meantime,
strong energy demand growth in emerging markets will outstrip additions to nonOPEC supply and will offset the declines in demand that have already occurred in the
US and Europe,” said Behravesh.
Global Insight raised its estimated peak price for West Texas Intermediate to $160/
bbl from $124/bbl previously. It expects the price to drop to $130/bbl by the end of
2009 (compared with $111/bbl in the prior forecast) and to $105/bbl by the end of
2010 (unchanged). But conﬂict between Israel and Iran and more supply disruptions
in Nigeria could push prices higher, Behravesh said.
Fortunately, energy is a smaller part of the US and world economies than it once
was, said S&P’s Wyss. “Even this year, we expect the average US household to
spend 6.7% of its income on energy, which is about the same as in 1971.” In 1980
and 1981, energy was 7.9% of income, reﬂecting a greater efﬁciency in energy use
relative to gross domestic product, he said. Even so, per-capita use of energy has
increased. “In the US, higher per-capita GDP has increased energy use per person by
2% (1971 to 2005). Worldwide energy use per head has risen 15.7% (1971-2004). “The
average American used 4.7 times as much energy as the average for the world in
2005 and nearly twice the average of Western Europe and Japan,” Wyss said.
Sword rattling
If attacked, Iranian forces would impose controls on shipping in the Persian Gulf
and the Strait of Hormuz, said the head of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. However,
at a gulf naval security meeting in Abu Dhabi, Vice-Admiral Kevin Cosgiff of the US
Navy’s Fifth Fleet, said, “Iran will not attempt to close the Strait of Hormuz and we
will not allow them to close the Strait of Hormuz. I can’t say it anymore clearly than
that.”
Despite widespread speculation about possible Israeli plans to bomb Iran’s
nuclear plants, analysts at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co. Inc., Arlington, Va., remain skeptical. “We would be cautious before interpreting the July 5 Israeli Air Force
drills over the eastern Mediterranean Sea as a practice run for a bombing campaign
against Iran,” FBR analysts said. “We concede the exercises superﬁcially resemble
Israel’s practice runs with its [then] newly acquired F-16s prior to the successful 1981
bombing of the Iraqi Osirak reactor at al-Tuweitha.”
However, they said, the latest drills may have been only a sword-rattling warning
to Iran as well as a political maneuver for Israeli voters. “With Prime Minister Ehud
Olmert’s Kadima party primaries scheduled on Sept. 25 and general elections possible in November once the Israeli parliament returns from summer recess, it should
not stretch US investors’ credulity to imagine that incumbents want to look tough on
security,” the analysts said.
Iran may be using today’s “robust communication infrastructure” to ”scare up”
the price of crude while also permitting the US and Iran to engage in “megaphone
diplomacy” via public statements reported in the media, despite the halt of ofﬁcial
relations 3 decades ago, analysts said. Any price premium for the escalated risk of
a disruption of crude exports from Iran may already be imbedded in current prices,
they said.
Meanwhile, Russia is revising its combat training programs for military units that
might be deployed in the Arctic in case of a potential conﬂict. It began preparing for
an Arctic war after the US, Canada, Norway, and Denmark contested its claim last
year to a large area of the Arctic shelf thought to hold vast mineral resources.

Q:

Historically, there has been a
very strong relationship between
public sector electricity demand and the
growth of the GDP. They are obviously
very closely intertwined. Do you see the
GDP fueling the demand for energy
resources or the improved energy resources
vital to improving the GDP of the
Republic?
A: Yes, I think the two are related and
connected to each other. If we want to
increase our GDP, the energy demand is
going to be greater and so the production
has to increase. At the moment, the total
demand is between 600 to 700 mw. We
are looking at producing about 1000 mw
from next year. This is acceptable in the
meantime, but in about five years from
now, we might need 1500 mw. Therefore,
we have to make sure that we increase
our production.
The production today is still not
sufficient even for domestic and industrial
consumption. If we want to increase our
industrial capacity, we have to increase
the production of energy. We are looking
at building dams in Lom Pangar, Nachtigal
and Memve’ele. These are going to take a
few years to start functioning, so we are
trying to put up a gas plant at Kribi to
generate electricity. But the problem that
we face is that most of the electricity that
is produced in Kribi is required by the
aluminum industry that is in Edea. Almost
half of what is to be produced is going to
be consumed by this industrial unit. So,
our energy demands will still not be
completely met but we still hope that it
will help us reduce the shortage that we
are experiencing now. By 2010, Memve’ele
is supposed to be ready and by 2011-12,
Nachtigal and Lom Pangar should be

operational. Through these operations,
we may cover our total needs but this is
dependent on how much and how fast the
economy grows and what the demands of
the industrial sector are.
Q: Obviously the oil reserves in the
country and the untapped oil reserves have
the potential of fueling the country’s future
demand and there are also several wells
identified in and around the Bakassi
peninsula. What is the strategy and licensing
plans for the area?
A: We have just come out of a
boundary dispute with Nigeria. We are
happy that this issue has been finally
resolved. We are now going to start
exploration in the Bakassi area. There
are stories about discoveries that have
been made in Bakassi but there is no
conclusive proof yet. SNH is signing
contracts with some companies to carry
out offshore and onshore explorations in
the area and only after we receive the
reports from these companies will we be
able to ascertain whether there is oil in
Bakassi or not. I read a confidential report
about five years ago which said that most
of the countries around the Gulf of
Guinea will increase their production but
Cameroon’s production would be zero by
2015. Contrary to that, we are now
hopeful that instead of being a net
importer of oil, we will probably see some
increase in our production. So, there is
going to be a lot of exploration in the
area but we cannot say for sure that
discoveries will be made.
Q: Do you see any other challenges to
the stability of the region? The border
dispute with Nigeria has thankfully been
resolved and we are very happy about

that. Are there any other challenges to the
stability of the region?

A: The Port of Limbe is a very important
project for us because the port of Douala
is very expensive now. It is always silted
and we have to dredge it all the time.
Transportation is done with vessels which
have certain capacities and some of those

This is partly how the border problem
originated in the north. In the south,
Calabar is one of the ports of Nigeria but it
is always silted. For vessels to get into
Calabar, they have to enter, using the
eastern part of the estuary, thereby, using
the Cameroonian side.
Q: Coming back to the oil and gas
sector, what do you think foreign firms
can bring to Cameroon’s oil and gas sector
and what can Cameroon give to foreign
firms in return?

H.E. Mr. Inoni, Prime Minister of Cameroon

cannot get into Douala very easily. Getting
smaller vessels into Douala is very
expensive. We need a deep sea port in
Limbe or Kribi. Some years ago, there
were studies done by an American
company that placed Limbe in a good
position as compared to the Ports of Togo
and others in the region.

company from Miami, Florida. It is not in
conjunction with SNH but with the
shipyard, CNIC. Eventually, there may be
a railway link between Douala and Limbe.
Let’s me also mention that the studies for
the building of the port of Kribi are
completed and we are looking for funding.
Q: In relation to the energy sector, what
do you see as the primary objectives for
your government now and in the future?
A: One of the primary objectives is that
we want to diversify our resources. That is
why we are trying to develop the bio-fuel
project. Hydro electricity, for us, is cheap
but the investment is heavy. We are also
going to use natural gas. We also want to
improve the transportation network; that
is, the transportation of energy from the
source to the consumer. AES Sonel is
working on the equipment that is 20-30
years old and needs updating. So, we have
to modernize the equipments and
improve on it. We also want to transport
energy, thereby reducing cost and making
it available to the ordinary Cameroonian.
We are working on a project with the
Rural Electrification Agency. With regard
to solar energy, we have proposals from
certain companies. So, our priority is to
diversify as much as possible.

Interview with the Prime Minister of Cameroon

A: Yes, there are quite a lot of challenges.
Let me give you an example of the north.
There are no real boundaries in the north.
It is very difficult to control the border up
there. The terrain is such that even without
building roads people can drive through
the border. Take for example the Lake
Chad, 50-60 years ago, which covered a
surface area of 30,000 square kilometers.
Today, it is less than 3000 square kilometers.
It is drying up and moving from west to
east. Nigerians who lived on the western
bank of the lake and whose occupation is
fishing followed the water as the lake was
drying up. They, thereby, ended up in
Cameroon without knowing.

Cameroon’s Petroleum Resources

Cameroon’s Petroleum Resources:
Gas prospects, offshore opportunities,
location are key assets

A

s oil and gas demand continues
to grow, two things will follow.
Discovered reserves will become more valuable
and incentives to explore for additional
supplies will become increasingly attractive.
Though Cameroon’s proved oil and gas
reserves, estimated at the beginning of 2008 at
200 million bbl by Oil & Gas Journal, are
modest on a worldwide scale, the country’s
potential—especially for the discovery of
natural gas—is significant. And Cameroon’s
strategic plans are designed to exploit that

potential to benefit its citizens, and local and
international investors.
Compared with the previous year, oil
reserves declined due to production and the
absence of significant discoveries, while gas
reserves increased. The Journal estimates 2007
production at 84,000 b/d, down about 4%
from the year before, but a significant increase
from 2004.
According to the US Energy Information
Administration (EIA), Cameroon’s 2007
petroleum consumption was about 24,500 b/d,

leaving more than 60,000 b/d for export.
Exports have increased from a low of about
43,000 b/d in 2004, according to EIA.
Because current oil production is modest
and existing fields are declining, much of
Cameroon’s petroleum story is about potential,
especially the potential of prospective natural
gas deposits. And much of the country’s
petroleum promise lies offshore.
To convert potential to reality, plans are
being developed to expand oil and gas
exploration and production activity, upgrade
refining capacity and increase electricity
generation capacity, all to fuel the country’s
economic growth.
Significant natural gas prospects can help
expand the country’s power generation
capacity, which stood at about 0.9 gigawatts
in 2007, up from 0.6 gigawatts in 1995. And
upgrading and expanding Cameroon’s single
refinery can reduce dependence on imported
light oil and meet growing product demand.
The refinery’s capacity was about 42,000 b/d
in 2007.

The oil challenge
Currently, Cameroon’s oil production comes
from fields in the later years of life and few
new significant discoveries have been made in
recent years.
In the case of Shell subsidiary Pecten
Cameroon Ltd., which began development of
oil fields in the Rio Del Rey basin, the decline
in oil reserves is normal for production that is
25 years old, said Mr. Ruud Schrama, until
recently President and General Manager.
Pecten Cameroon.
The Mokoko-Abana has been producing
for 25 years, as has the Rio del Rey, operated
by Total Cameroun. The opportunity to apply
breakthrough technology in such fields is
limited, said Mr. Schrama. “As production
declines, of course, we evaluate the possible
application of the latest advances in
technology. However, the scale is fairly

limited here. It’s not a place where we can
experiment a lot.”
“What we require is not ‘rocket science’ but
sufficient ‘barrel chasing.’ We do that by getting
people on the ground that are competent,” he
said. In doing so, Pecten has been able to
slowly pick up production in its operating
areas. “By tweaking every valve, we have been
able to increase production by about 10%.”
Despite some discoveries, Mr. Schrama sees
no real evidence that a ‘game change’ is in store
for Cameroon’s oil production. “When you
move from the southwest to the northeast of the
country, the reservoirs that contain oil become
lighter and gassier.” Farther north, more gas
fields have been discovered than in the south.
“We are in a declining oil basin and we try
to guard it properly,” he said. “We try to ‘find’
the ever-smaller volumes which are still out
there by re-interpreting the reservoir models.”
However, in the long term—say out to
2020—it is possible that Cameroon would
want to continue to produce oil from these
fields, even after they have become subeconomic, because they enjoy strategic
advantages, according to Mr. Schrama.
Since existing reserves are declining, it is
important to find ways to develop smaller
volumes. “Oil still has many years to go,” he
said, “if we can manage the ever-smaller
margins in a smart fashion.”

There is still some oil exploration activity,
and there may be opportunities at greater
depths.
The business environment has also
changed. 1998 was a bad year for oil prices,
slowing industry activity. “Everyone was
looking at new prospects rather than the
production of more barrels,” said Mr. Schrama.
With today’s improved business environment,
Pecten has been increasing investment levels,
making use of the latest available proven
technologies.
“Since 2006, we have drilled three wells after
a drilling holiday of a couple of years. We are
planning to drill additional wells next year.”
It is a challenge to make the business work
in an environment where the oil fields are small
and somewhat scattered, but still contain
serious volumes.
“Being nimble here is the key to success,”
said Mr. Schrama.

Bakassi prospects
With the resolution last year of a boundary
dispute with Nigeria, exploration in the
Bakassi peninsular area can begin, said Prime
Minister Ephraim Inoni in a recent interview.
He expects significant exploration activity in
the area.
“There have been hints of discoveries in
the area, but no conclusive proof,” said Prime

Minister Inoni. “Cameroon state oil company
Société Nationale des Hydrocarbures (SNH) is
signing contracts with companies to carry out
offshore and onshore explorations in the area.
Only after we receive the reports from these
companies will we be able to ascertain whether
there is oil in Bakassi or not.”
Mr. Schrama discounts earlier speculation
about oil in Bakassi, because the trend indicates
a greater likelihood of gas in the area. “There is
no indication from the trends, map, geology
and the way development has progressed that
there is a big oil field there, unless there is
something at a different depth that has not been
tested in the last 10-15 years.”
Pecten does have a 25-year partnership
with Total in these areas, and drilled a number
of wells that it no longer operates. Volumes
that have been identified have not been
commercial with the exception of some
production that is sent to a neighboring block
or facility. The areas developed by Pecten and
operated by Total in the north have not been
very active because of the border dispute.
Strategies to reverse the oil production
decline should include encouraging interest in a
new round of exploration, said Mr. Ibrahim
Talba Malla, Director General, Caisse de
Stabilisation Prix des Hydrocarbures (CSPH).
Exploration should be accelerated in Bakassi,
he said, now that the border dispute is resolved.

Cameroon’s Petroleum Resources

Tullow seismic boats, Ngosso permit, Rio del Rey Basin.

Natural gas potential
Cameroon has recognized the potential of its
natural gas resource for several years and
recently has taken demonstrable steps through
SNH toward its development.
Perenco Cameroon S.A. operates Sanaga
Sud gas field, Cameroon’s largest. Development
has been accelerated in order to provide
natural gas to fuel a power plant in Kribi to be
operated by power company AES-SONEL.
Initially, the largest customer will be AluCam,
Cameroon’s aluminum smelting company.
“The Sanaga Sud field is not a field that a
single party can develop with an adjacent
scheme but requires gathering, collection and
redistribution,” said Mr. Schrama.
Cameroon’s ambition is to develop its gas
resources, fuel the power station, and have a
significant volume left to be converted into
liquefied natural gas (LNG). Potential gas
supply is larger than that needed for expected
power generation demand. Part of the excess
will be converted into LPG and the remainder
will go to an LNG facility in Equatorial Guinea.
“The challenge of this project is that it has
to lean on so many players and depend on so
many small fields to come on-stream. It is not
a trivial project,” said Mr. Schrama.

Offshore activity highlights
Much of the opportunity for new discoveries in
Cameroon lies offshore. And several companies
have recently completed work and announced
new plans.
Perenco’s exploration activities have been
focussed on the onshore Kombe-Nsepe license,
with partners Kosmos Energy LLC and SNH,
and on the deepwater Ebodje license, according
to company information. Two prospects will
be drilled on Kombe-Nsepe in 2009. A
deepwater well on the Ebodje license has
demonstrated the presence of all the elements
of a hydrocarbon system, according to the
company, and discussions are on-going to

enable additional exploration investment in
this play. Perenco is also evaluating a number of
gas opportunities that may add value to the
development of the Sanaga field.
Late last year, Noble Energy Inc. announced
a new discovery on its offshore PH-77 license,
between Cameroon and the international
boundary with Equatorial Guinea. The license
area contains a number of seismically identified
prospects, according to the company.
Located in 1,732 ft (528 m of water), the
well’s primary target in the Miocene was the
YoYo-1. A high quality Miocene reservoir
containing 95 ft (29 m) of net hydrocarbon pay
was encountered in the YoYo-1 interval, the
company said. Production tests yielded flow
rates of 330 b/d of condensate and 31 million
cu ft/day (MMcfd) of natural gas, with
production rates limited by test facilities. The
interval was encountered at a depth of 8,425 ft
(2,568 m). Additional appraisal work will be
necessary to verify the areal extent of the YoYo1 discovery, the company said.
In a secondary, deeper target in the
Paleocene, commercial hydrocarbons were
not found, according to Noble Energy.
Other participants in the PH-77 license
area are SNH, and Petronas Carigali Overseas
Sdn. Bhd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Malaysian national oil company, Petronas.
Addax Petroleum Inc. planned to complete
its first two exploration wells at the Ngosso
block offshore Cameroon in the first half of
2008. The first of these wells, spudded in
early March, targets the Odiong prospect.
The company has extended its contract for
the jack-up drilling rig Hercules 156, used
on the first well, to early 2009 to support its
accelerated exploration program.
Addax, with 60% interest, operates the
474 sq mile Ngosso license in the Rio del Rey
Basin; Tullow Oil Co. holds 40%. The shallow
water off northern Cameroon contains a
number of small oil discoveries, and offers
exploration opportunities, according to Addax.

The exploration well that had a gas kick
last year while Bowleven plc’s wholly-owned
subsidiary, EurOil Ltd., was drilling in Block
MLHP 7 of the shallow water Etinde permit
was abandoned after taking the kick. Primary
objective was the gas/condensate bearing
Isongo sands at a depth of about 10,000 ft
(3048 m).
The kick occurred about 540 ft (165 m)
above the highest expected target in the
uppermost section of the Isongo. For safety
reasons, and to develop a new well design
using higher-rated equipment, the well was
abandoned. In early February, Bowleven signed
a contract with Sedco Forex International
Inc. to re-drill the IF exploration well with
the jackup rig Trident IV. Operations were
scheduled to begin in late April or early May.

A strategic pipeline
Aside from its petroleum and human
resources, Cameroon benefits from the strategic
value of the Chad-Cameroon pipeline. The
pipeline is one of Cameroon’s successes in
uniting international investment through the
cooperation of two neighboring countries
within Central Africa.
Operated by Cameroon Oil Transportation
Co. (COTCO), the pipeline transports oil
from the Kome area and the fields located in
Chad to Kribi. The oil is stored offshore near
Kribi in a floating storage vessel where tankers
load for export.
“COTCO’s role is to ensure that the pipeline
works smoothly and reliably,” said Jacky
Lesage, General Manager, COTCO.
Design capacity of the line is 225,000 b/d.
In mid 2007, throughput was close to 140,000
b/d. At that time, Mr. Lesage expected throughput

pipeline from Chad,” said Mr. Lesage. “This is
part of the role of COTCO by law and is part
of the Convention agreement.”
Should a new customer request access to
the pipeline, it must be pursued through the
legal framework. “We can work with any
customer who asks us to transport oil through
the pipeline,” he said.
In early 2008, COTCO had no plans to
build a new pipeline, for example, to link the
existing line with Gabon or Nigeria. But if
another pipeline is built and linked with the
Chad-Cameroon pipeline under existing
agreements, of course, COTCO would accept
the new customer, said Mr. Lesage.

“We do not have the ability or willingness
to design, develop and implement another
pipeline,” said Lesage.
The Chad-Cameroon pipeline has also
been a benefit to Cameroon’s economy. In
2006, COTCO spent a substantial US$40
million locally. The company spends close to
$600 million locally in Cameroon each year,
according to Mr. Lesage.
Most of this pays contractors that work for
the pipeline. In addition, COTCO also pays a
transit fee to Cameroon, which in mid 2007
had reached about $80 million since the
beginning of the operation.
“But I call that our modest contribution, as
part of the oil industry within Cameroon,”
said Mr. Lesage.
COTCO has a number of international
partners that are concession operators. In Chad,
there are three: ExxonMobil Corp., Chevron
Corp. and Petronas. The other partners are the
Republics of Chad and Cameroon.
“I also consider the World Bank and other
lenders to be partners,” said Mr. Lesage. The
World Bank was a key driver of the project;
nothing would have happened if the World
Bank had not approved the project, he said.
“In total, there are 18 lenders. These
‘partners’ are very important, even if they are
not shareholders.”

Cameroon’s Petroleum Resources

to increase by the end of the year to 170,000180,000 b/d as a result of some new fields
being brought into production in Chad.
Along with petroleum products, the
pipeline also carries a fiber optic system for
high speed communication.
“When we laid the pipeline, we felt the
need for the fiber optics to be installed and
decided to include 12 fibers for the exclusive
use of the Cameroon government,” said Mr.
Lesage. “Installing 1,000 km of fiber optic is a
significant achievement, and it will constitute
the back-bone of the fiber optic infrastructure
in Cameroon.” The project also brought other
infrastructure improvements, including roads
in the north of Cameroon and bridges. Three
of those bridges were turned over to the
Government last year. Significant work was
also done during the project to upgrade the
railway and locomotive sectors, according to
Mr. Lesage.
Some work also had been done on the
Kribi air strip during the construction of the
pipeline in 2004 and the airstrip located in
Belabo was refurbished.
Currently there are no expansion plans
for the pipeline, but COTCO is open to
opportunities to enhance its role in Central
Africa. “For the time being, COTCO’s sole
objective is to transport oil through the

lobal energy demand will bring new
opportunities for countries that have
significant oil and gas prospects, and a
strategy that is grounded in market realities.
In this environment, the Republic of
Cameroon has the potential to play an
important role in the world’s energy markets,
while it fuels the growth of its own economy
and advances the living standards of its citizens.
In his year end speech last December,
Cameroon President Paul Biya described the
country’s energy goal this way:
“Our most urgent challenge should be to
increase energy supply in order to meet the
increasing needs of the population and the
demand of enterprises.”
Today’s Republic of Cameroon enjoys a
stability that will facilitate the further
development of its petroleum industry.
According to the U.S. Energy Information
Agency, Cameroon’s economy has grown
steadily since the mid 1990’s and 2005, the
real GDP growth rate was 2.6%.
Experience in producing hydrocarbon
resources, tempting exploration prospects,
and a strategic location together provide a
promising future for oil and gas development
in Cameroon.

SNH has key role
Central to the country’s future is its national oil
and gas company, Société Nationale des
Hydrocarbures (SNH). The company engages
in partnerships with international oil companies,
assists the government in its financial relations
with private oil firms and is responsible for
selling the government’s share of oil output.
SNH also holds stakes in companies involved
in downstream activities and in non-oilrelated activities.
The company fully shares the priority
described by President Paul Biya, said Adolphe
Moudiki, SNH Executive General Manager.
One of its key roles will be to guide
Cameroon’s focus on natural gas. To that end,

Oil output was 83,604 b/d as of May 31st,
compared to 87,357 b/d at year end 2006.
Much of Cameroon’s crude is heavy; lighter
production is used domestically, while the
heavy crude is exported.

Foundation for growth

the SNH Board of Directors in June created a
Gas Directorate to implement the Master plan
for the development of gas resources.
A key project is the construction of a gas
plant at Kribi, of which SNH is a stakeholder.
In 2006, Perenco Cameroon S.A signed a 25year contract with SNH to develop the
offshore Sanaga Sud natural gas fields in the
Douala/Kribi-Campo basins to supply gas to
generate power at the Kribi plant.
Perenco’s conceptual studies for the
development of the Sanaga Sud fields have
been completed. Preliminary engineering will
be complete by the end of this year, and gas is
expected to be available for the plant in the
first quarter of 2009, said Mr. Moudiki.
The contribution of SNH to Cameroon’s
economy is significant. In the first quarter of
2007, the company’s income exceeded
projections by 13.4%, according to Mr.
Moudiki. For the period, SNH transferred
119,943 billion Francs CFA to the public
Treasury, not including taxes.
Crude oil production during the period
dropped slightly due to operating problems.

In a sense, the main thrust of the development
of Cameroon’s oil and gas resources has just
begun. Though all three of the country’s main
petroleum basins have been explored, new
partnerships with international companies
promise a much more intense search of large
prospective areas.
Elf Acquitaine conducted the first oil and
gas exploration in the country in the 1950s,
concentrating on the Douala Basin. When
other companies joined the search in the late
1960s, the focus shifted to the Rio del Rey
Basin where discoveries in the 1970s included
Asoma, Bavo, Betika, Ekoundou, Kole,
Kombo and Makoko.
Production from these discoveries began
in the mid 1970s and oil output reached a
peak of more than 150,000 b/d in the mid
1980s. As Rio del Rey production declined,
more exploration in the Douala Basin turned
up gas condensate discoveries including
Batanga, Benda, M’Via and N’Koudou.
Development of the Kribi-Campo area
began in the 1990s, and the Ebome field
went on stream in 1996. In the late 1990s,
Shell subsidiary Pecten Cameroon Ltd.
began development of oil fields in the Rio
Del Rey basin.
In addition to its own hydrocarbon
resources, the Chad to Cameroon oil pipeline
and the export terminus at Kribi will help
Cameroon become a significant regional oil
transportation hub.
In downstream activity, a 42,000-b/d
refinery at Limbe operated by the Société
Nationale de Raffinage (SONARA) will get
significant upgrades to increase capacity and
handle more of the country’s heavy crude.

High Quality Exploration Opportunities

To accelerate the search for new reserves, the
Cameroon government revised its petroleum
laws in both 1999 and 2002 to include financial
incentives and tax breaks for exploration.
West Africa offers multiple high-quality
exploration opportunities, according to
Kosmos Energy Cameroon HC. Reserve and
production growth rates in this prolific area
are high and finding and development costs in
the region are very competitive.

and covers 143 sq km.
In early 2006, Total was awarded the

Perenco
Perenco has operated in Cameroon since 1993,
together with ExxonMobil Corp. and SNH.
Perenco’s principal assets in the country are
the Moudi and Ebome Marine concessions,
and the Ebodje deepwater exploration permit.
The company’s production area covers 967 sq
km and it holds 5,182 sq km of exploration
acreage.
As part of an overall program to optimize
production, Perenco has upgraded the Moudi
field with water injection and sand control
systems. Renovations to the main production
platform are also planned to maintain total
gross production at 4,000 bopd.
At its Ebome Marine block, gross production
has been maintained at 10,000 bopd since the
discovery of KF field in 1997.
Perenco recently drilled a CM-1A well
within the Ebodje deepwater exploration

miles (117,100 acres) that contains a number
of existing small oil discoveries, including
Narendi, Odiong and Oongue, in addition to
numerous exploration opportunities.
During the first three years of the contract,
the minimum work commitment required the
acquisition of 200 sq km of 3D seismic and
the drilling of two wells. The agreement also
offers incentives for developing marginal fields
with oil reserves of less than 20 million bbl.
The 3D was completed in the first quarter of
2006 and the drilling is planned for late 2007.
According to Addax, Ngosso, which lies
adjacent to the shore, has similar operational
and subsurface geological conditions to the
OML123 block in Nigeria. Though the area
contains several discoveries, it has not seen
any exploration for 20 years.
Addax estimates the Ngosso concession
may contain as much as 47 million bbl of
recoverable oil reserves.

BowLeven
BowLeven plc’s wholly-owned subsidiary,
EurOil Ltd., is 100% owner of the Etinde
Permit area comprised of three shallow water
offshore blocks—MLHP 5, MLHP 6 and
MLHP 7.
In total, BowLeven has about 2,300 sq km
of exploration acreage located across the Rio
del Rey and Douala basins in the permit.
According to the company, the acreage has
very attractive exploration potential.
The company has operated in Cameroon
since 1999 and over the years has established
a strong relationship with the Cameroon

government. During 2007 the company
planned to:
• process and interpret 3D seismic data
on the Etinde permit;
• drill up to four exploration and
appraisal wells:
• continue to consider opportunities for
timing on a farm-out;
• monetize its existing resource base
together with any additional gas/condensate
discoveries;
• augment the existing asset base through
selective acquisitions, and;
• further evaluate selected identified
prospects, leads and plays.
Drilling began on Isongo E2, the first
appraisal well on the existing discovery in
Block MLHP7 of the Etinde permit. Objective
was to appraise the extent and volume of the
Isongo sand in the discovery well E1 and
explore deeper sands that were water wet in
E1. Target depth was 8,500 ft.
In July, BowLeven completed its
development well in Block MLHP 5 of the

permit. Well D1 was targeting a Miocene
turbidite channel prospect similar to that in a
nearby discovery. The well tested both gas
and condensate from inter-bedded high
quality sands, over a gross measured interval
of 75 ft and tested at a rate of 25 MMcfd of
gas and 1,400 b/d of condensate through a
1-in. choke.
In July 2007, BowLeven announced that
drilling had begun on the IF-1 exploration
well in Block MLHP 7 of the permit. Primary
objective of the well was to explore for
gas/condensate bearing Isongo sands in a
structure located up-dip from the adjoining IE
field. The well was to be drilled to a depth of
about 10,000 ft.
In August, however, the company announced
that the well had taken a significant gas kick at
6,355 ft (about 540 ft above the highest
expected target) in the uppermost section of
the Isongo formation. Pressures encountered
during this kick indicated that the well could
be in communication with the IE structure,
evaluated with well IE-2.
For safety reasons, and to develop a new
well design using higher-rated equipment, the
well was abandoned. It was intended to return
to the IF structure to re-drill this exploration
well as soon as practicable. The re-drill will
most likely be located down dip from the
structural crest (where IF-1 is located) on the
flanks of the structure, where more favorable
pressure conditions are likely to exist.
The likelihood that the IE and IF structures
are connected and have a common substantial
gas column is extremely encouraging, said
BowLeven.

seismic data, Kosmos Energy expects to drill
an exploratory well.
Kosmos is 100% owner and operates the
N’dian River Block. The PSC covers about
2,510 km2 (620,000 acres). Partner SNH was
to be carried through exploration and
appraisal phases and have an option to back
in to the project with an interest of up to 15%
upon approval of a development plan.
The block comprises a portion in the
transition zone east of the Bakassi peninsula,
and an onshore portion adjacent to the
crystalline basement farther to the east. There
have been several geophysical and drilling
activities on this block in the past. The latest of
three wells, Munge, drilled by Elf Serepca in
1997, had oil and gas shows. But the block
has had no significant exploration activity
since 2001.
Kosmos has a 35% working interest and
Perenco operates the Kombe-N’sepe Block, a
coastal strip of Douala Basin bordering Gulf of
Guinea (predominantly onshore), containing
about 3,026 sq km (748,000 acres). Perenco
has a 40% working interest and SNH, 25%.
Kombe-N’sepe is at the northern end of
the late Cretaceous turbidite play fairway that
extends from northern Gabon through
Equatorial Guinea into southern Cameroon.
More than two billion bbl of oil have been
discovered in the region.
Generally, explorers have not focused on
this late Cretaceous play where Kosmos
Energy recognizes several promising leads in
stratigraphic pinch-out and combination
structural traps located in well-developed
channel systems.
In late 2006, Kosmos Energy and its
partners acquired 2D seismic data to refine
understanding of the block’s prospects and
help define the location of the first
exploratory well.

Hardman Resources
In early 2006, Australia’s Hardman Resources
Ltd. reported that the Zoule-1 exploration
well in production sharing contract C Block 6
was being plugged and abandoned after
failing to encounter significant hydrocarbons.
The rig was then scheduled to move to the
Dore-1 well in PSC B, Block 4, about 20 km
east of the Tiof field and 30 km north of the
Chinguetti field in a water depth of about 390
m. The well was to be drilled to a proposed
total depth of 2,350 m to target Oligoceneaged submarine channel/turbidite sands as
well as encountering the up-dip extension of
the Tiof Miocene canyon system.
With the recognition of a number of
attractive prospects in the shallower, eastern part
of PSC A and B, a rig capable of drilling in
shallower water depths than the targets of the
2004 and 2005 programs was required,
according to the company. A rig rated for
water depths from 100 to 1,500 m was
contracted to conduct the PSC A and B 2006
and 2007 drilling campaigns.

n addition to expanding exploration,
increasing refining capacity and adding
power generating capacity, Cameroon’s
strategic and tactical plans also have strong
components aimed at improving transportation
and communication networks.
Expanding the social, health and
environmental protection programs that are
already underway will also be keys to the
country’s economic future.
All these efforts will be facilitated by an
increasingly stable business environment that
welcomes investment.
Energy, water and electricity are crucial to
economic development, said Sindeu Jean
Bernard, Minister of Energy and Water. “This
Ministry will play a key role in all these
aspects of the fight against poverty,” he said.
Minister Bernard is also interested in the
development of renewable energy technologies.
In addition to having less impact on the
environment, these technologies could be
especially important in remote areas where
localized production units could make energy
more easily available.

Cameroon Petroleum Depot Co. (SCDP) was
one of the first companies to be considered
for privatization, according to Mr. Ibrahim
Talba Malla, Chairman.

Foreign investment in this sector is not well

$14.5 million from the World Bank to ensure
the security of our airports, increase capacity
and train personnel is a major breakthrough.”
Part of the grant will go to building airport

and others have helped rehabilitate provincial airports, and COTCO
built airstrips along its pipeline to facilitate inspection and
maintenance.
Because it uses the Belabo airport on a daily basis, COTCO has
made a significant investment there, as well as at Kribi, according to
Jacky Lesage, General Manager, COTCO.
Since the country’s road network is not well developed,
rehabilitation of secondary and third grade airstrips throughout the
country would facilitate the movement of people and goods. “We
welcome the initiative of the oil companies and others who might want
to help us rehabilitate these runways,” said Mr. Lesage.
CCAA is drawing up plans for those who might be interested in
investing in the air transport infrastructure. “For now, we are looking for
partners to come and build the runway, airport building, control tower
and other facilities at Kribi airport,” said Mr. Juma. Based on the “Build,
Operate and Transfer” policy, an investor could operate the airport for
some time before giving it to Cameroon.
Since independence, Cameroon has been a member of the
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). “We do all we can to
ensure that we comply with the regulations set out by the ICAO,” said
Mr. Juma.
Cameroon has three international airports—Douala, Yaoundé and
Garoua. Its four secondary airports are Maroua, Ngaoundere, Bertoua
and Bamenda. In addition to the national airline company, Cameroon
Airlines, other small charter airlines and local airlines are entering
the market.
The port of Limbe is another very important project, said Prime
Minister Ephraim Inoni. Currently, the port of Douala is expensive to
operate because it must be continuously dredged. Using smaller vessels
adds to the expense.
“We need a deep sea port in Limbe or Kribi” said Prime Minister
Inoni. Limbe is in a volcanic area where silt is not a problem; it could
also serve as a hub for the central and western regions of Togo.

Through its “roll back malaria” program, aimed at reducing the
occurrence of the disease along the pipeline corridor, COTCO has
distributed 35,000 mosquito nets along the route. The company also has
educational programs on AIDS and an effort underway to fight cholera.
Since the start of the pipeline project, COTCO has provided funds
to individuals and communities as part of its responsibility for
environmental protection. By the middle of last year, individual
compensation totaled about $11 million and community compensation
amounted to $5 million. The company has refurbished about 100
classrooms along the pipeline route and continues to drill and upgrade
water wells along the corridor.

Enhancing quality of life
Part of Cameroon’s development strategy deals with improving health,
safety and environmental protection. COTCO is an example of how
energy industry companies can make social, economic and
environmental contributions to Cameroon. The company provides
work for about 1,200 people on a permanent basis.
“Safety is a top priority and we are very proud of our safety record,”
said Mr. Lesage. “We just completed four years without lost-time
incidents among both employees and contractors.”

Downstream Strategy:
Downstream Strategy

Refinery upgrade, expanded distribution

T

he responsibility for achieving
Cameroon’s over-arching goals for
its petroleum sector—fueling economic
growth and maintaining its energy
independence—will depend heavily on the
success of its strategy for processing and
distributing petroleum products.
Crude production volume, though modest,
is twice what the country currently consumes,
but the quality of Cameroon’s oil is another
matter. It is too heavy to be processed by the
country’s refinery as it is currently configured,
so lighter oil must be imported from Nigeria
and Equatorial Guinea to feed the refinery. At
the same time, most of Cameroon’s heavy oil
production is exported.
A key goal of the downstream strategy is
to upgrade the existing refinery to be able to
process heavier crude, reducing the need for
oil imports and making the country more
self sufficient. Being able to process a wider
variety of crude will also enhance the
country’s ability to become a regional refining
leader.
Feeding the refinery with Cameroon’s own
crude will also help contain costs—both for
the refiner and for consumers—as the
economy improves.
“Oil is a cure-all—first of all for the general
economy, then for the consumer, and finally
for the investor,” said Mr. Ibrahim Talba Malla,
Director General, Caisse de Stabilisation Prix
des Hydrocarbures (CSPH) and Chairman,
Cameroon Petroleum Depot Co. (SCDP).
For the general economy, the country’s
downstream strategy will help fight
inflation. As energy prices increase, higher
transportation and manufacturing costs also
raise the price of all goods. The role of
CSPH is to help control hydrocarbon prices
for the benefit of both the economy and
individuals.
“(Consumers) are earning money, and
they want to spend less money and consume
more hydrocarbons,” said Mr. Malla.

Unique organization

SCDP operates 12 storage depots.

A more modern refinery will also position
Cameroon as the refining leader of Central
Africa and make it possible to manufacture
products that meet the quality standards of
export markets beyond Africa.
But “downstream” is more than refining;
it also includes product storage, marketing
and distribution. And expanding and
improving that infrastructure is also a key
part of the downstream development plan.
It will involve more pipelines, greater
storage capacity—both by increasing
existing facilities and by building new ones

Among international operators, there are
some misconceptions about how Cameroon’s
downstream operations are organized. One
is that SCDP is a corporation that owns
petroleum products, but the company is
responsible only for operating storage
facilities and is not involved in distribution.
Cameroon has a unique organization of
its petroleum industry, particularly in the
downstream sector, said Dr. Nguini Effa,
General Director, SCDP. “Downstream” begins
with refining and ends with distribution to
service stations.”
The refinery and storage facilities are
distinct entities in the chain. These typically
are owned by semi-public corporations
where the state is the majority shareholder.
For example, the government owns more
than 60% of Société Nationale de Raffinage
(SONARA) and 51% of SCDP.
Refined products are marketed in
Cameroon by private companies, including
Total S.A., Exxon Mobil Corp., Shell Group
plc and Chevron Corp.

Storage, distribution needs

An important focus is on storage in new
areas after a domestic product shortage in
2007 highlighted the need for expanded
capacity. In Yaoundé and Bafousam, for
example, the needs of a
growing population with

and sends products to depots spread throughout Cameroon,
including those in Yaoundé, Ngaoundéré, Garoua and in Maroua.
A national commission sets the terms of the agreements between
SCDP and the marketers, according to Mr. Effa. That commission
includes representatives from the appropriate ministries, as well as
representatives from CSPH, SNH, SCDP and the marketers.
Because the distribution infrastructure needs significant investment,
SCDP was one of the first organizations to be put on the list for
privatization. Privatization is driven by the need for large investments
in the depot network that the state is no longer capable of providing
and will have to be made by foreign participants, said Mr. Effa.
Kribi terminal will be expanded in stages, said Minister of Energy
and Water Sindeu Jean Bernard. “It is a project that fits into the
industrial development plans of the country, and like any large
project, it is completed in stages as activity grows.”
More investment is also needed for a pipeline from Limbé to
Douala, said Mr. Effa. Currently, only one tanker of 15,000 cu m
comes from Limbé to Douala every three days and loading/unloading
takes one day.
“This is a high priority,” he said. “Now that demand is increasing,
we cannot meet that demand by shipping alone.”
Investment in the pipeline will lower the cost of transportation, as
well as reduce the impact of transportation on the environment.

facilities easier.

multiplied by at least two or three times.” Increasing refinery capacity
is one objective; another is to always look for renewable energy and
cleaner energy forms, said Minister Bernard.
The other part of this reform is to increase the plant’s capacity to
produce LPG for household consumption. Demand for residential
LPG in Cameroon has doubled or tripled compared with consumption
during the year the refinery went on line, in part because the government

Refining plans
The refinery at Limbé operated by SONARA is built around a
relatively simple processing scheme that limits its capability to handle
heavy crude like that produced in Cameroon. The 42,000 b/d plant’s
key units are an 11,000 b/d catalytic reformer, a 12,000 b/d naphtha
hydrotreater, and a 3,500 b/d distillate hydrotreater.
Built about 25 years ago, it was designed to produce the small
volumes needed at the time, about 1 million tons of refined products
annually. It also was designed to use only relatively light crude.
“Today, the economy of Cameroon has dramatically expanded
compared to its size when the refinery was built,” said Minister
Bernard. “Cameroon’s economy is at least 10 times larger than it was at
the end of the 1970s, and our need for refined products has

has been promoting the use of this type of
fuel for household use.
“We have plans to develop natural gas
fields and intend to produce additional LPG
through some of those projects,” said Minister
Bernard.
Being able to process Cameroon’s heavier
crude and reduce the need to import light
crude is a key objective of the upgrade. “It is
a good strategy for the state to take its share
of the heavier Cameroon crude for its
refinery and free up more of the lighter crude
for export,” said Mr. Ruud Schrama, until
recently President and General Manager,
Pecten Cameroon Ltd. “An added benefit is
that heavier crude reservoirs produce longer
than lighter crude fields.”
Pecten, like other foreign producers take
their crude outside the country for refining.
Charles Metouck, General Manager of
SONARA, has a unique view of the economic
environment in Cameroon and the positive
steps taken in recent years to improve the
environment for business.
“More and more, Cameroon is retaking a
place in the international business community,”
he said. “The efforts we are making today
will rebuild confidence in the economy of
Cameroon that will help re-launch it. Recently,
the government has put in place a number of
institutional, judicial and regulatory policies
that will help the economy advance.”
SONARA has a number of important
projects in both electricity production and in
petroleum. Its key role currently is to operate
the Cameroon refinery and serve as the
exclusive supplier of fuel for industry,
transportation and energy production.
“Our role is to insure energy independence
in these areas,” said Mr. Metouck. “That also
permits Cameroon to be one of the privileged
suppliers in the sub-region of Central Africa.”
Because SONARA produces about double
the country’s domestic requirement, it can
also help meet demand in surrounding areas,
as well as export internationally.
Because the refinery produces much more
than domestic needs, there are no plans to
build a new grass roots refinery in Cameroon.
Rather, reconfiguration of the existing plant
will make it more economically viable, said

“bottom of the barrel” is a key part of the
revamp study. That portion of the crude is

Environmental protection also drives refinery
operation and the design of any new units
that are part of upgrading and expansion.
From the beginning, everything was done
to protect the environment, said Dr. Yenwo.
“For example, every drop of water that falls
into the refinery goes into the water
treatment system, directed there by the
concrete surfaces of the refinery.”
The government samples the water that
goes into the sea regularly, providing
complete data on water discharge from the
refinery.
Because the refinery processes relatively
light, relatively “sweet” crude, there has been
no need for a sulfur treatment plant. “We
have very little sulfur and what we do have
is transformed into hydrogen sulfide (H2S)
gas and burned in our furnaces,” said Dr.
Yenwo.
The content of sulfur compounds in the
stack gas is insignificant and well within
national standards, he said. Cameroon is
guided by European air quality standards,
since it does not have a specific standard of
its own.
On the retail product side, Total has
found a way to deal with another
environmental challenge in Cameroon. A
major marketer in Africa, with activities in
more than 40 countries, the company
developed the Ecolube process for treating
used oil as part of its response to the
continent’s growing environmental concerns.
As part of the recovery and recycling
process, Total Cameroun provides the
necessary storage facilities at its own service
stations and to large oil consumers. It also
collects the used oil and transports it to
Douala, where it is blended with heavy fuel
oil at the recycling unit to make fuel that is
sold to local customers, mainly cement
plants. Almost 2,000 metric tons of oil was
processed this way in 2006, according to
Total. Because the oil to be treated exists in
small quantities throughout the region, a
facility was installed on the premises of
SCDP in Douala.
Ecolub is not a regeneration unit,
according to Total. Instead, it recycles used
oil by mixing it with heavy fuel oil.
Initially, Ecolub only processed used oil
generated by Total Cameroun, about 800
metric tons a year. Now it serves all lubricant

users with a fully-developed policy of product recovery and recycling.
Cameroon had the first Ecolube process, but it has now been
extended to Madagascar, Burkina Faso and Niger, and is expected to
be rolled out in other African countries.

Attracting investment
To meet increasing demand and more stringent standards in the
refining sector, as well as throughout the expanding energy sector,
initiatives and policies that attract foreign investors will be critical.
SONARA’s objective is to position itself as the refining leader of
Central Africa, said Dr. Yenwo. “To do that we need investment not
only to expand basic capacity, but also to ensure that the quality of our
refined products is such that they can be exported within Central
Africa and beyond.”
Investment is also required in technology that will allow the
refinery to process Cameroon crude, as well as imported crude. “This
will help build our leadership as a refining leader in the area.”
Execution of the plan depends on investment from outside the
country. The participation of the International Monetary Fund and
World Bank is expected, said Mr. Metouck, but those organizations
are still considering the project.
“We expect that the studies we have done for this project, will
make clear our interest in investing in a facility that will help us
become a leader in the regional energy sector.”
Though SONARA is run like a private corporation, the fact that
the state is the majority shareholder means the World Bank has an eye
on what the state does, as well as on what the corporation does, said
Mr. Metouck.
SONARA seeks financing like a private company, presenting an
economically viable project to the financial markets. Political will in
the region is important when borrowing is done in the financial
market rather than from the state, he said.
“We ask lenders to look at our project. If it is economically viable,
they will finance it,” said Dr. Yenwo.
As a shareholder, the state contributes ideas for consideration,
said Mr. Metouck. “But since it is not the state that is loaning us
money, we need not ask them for permission for a project. We
depend on the quality of the project, its products and our internal
financial situation.”
The state’s presence as a shareholder means that the World Bank
and the IMF are obliged to oversee the project so that state
involvement does not exceed guidelines.

Top priority
Above all, the goal of Cameroon’s downstream strategy is to be selfsufficient in refined products. Before the country’s refinery was built, a
refinery in Gabon supplied Cameroon’s market. When Gabon lost a
football match to Cameroon, it stopped supplying Cameroon with
refined products.
“A very small problem (such as that) could cost us our oil
independence,” said Dr. Yenwo. “We have our own crude. And with
the insecurity in the region, the best way to be independent is to
utilize that crude in the best way possible.”

Natural Gas Potential:

Natural gas will generate electricity,

W

ith significant proven natural gas
reserves and a looming demand
for clean energy to fuel its economic growth,
Cameroon has developed a strategy to
develop those reserves for power generation,
domestic use and export revenue.
The opportunities are large. Only small
gas volumes are now produced, and are used
primarily to enhance oil field performance
and generate in-field electricity.
The country’s natural gas resources are
large, but a more accurate assessment of
those reserves must await additional
exploration and appraisal. According to Oil
& Gas Journal, Cameroon has 3.9 trillion
cubic feet (tcf) of proven natural gas
reserves, the bulk of which is located in the
Rio del Rey, Douala and Kribi-Campo
basins. An estimate by Cameroon’s Société
Nationale des Hydrocarbures (SNH)
estimate is higher, at about 5.5 tcf.
In addition to using natural gas to expand
power generation capacity and LPG
production, several studies in recent years
focused on ways to monetize and add value
to the excess gas production, including gasto-liquid (GTL) and liquefied natural gas
(LNG) schemes. Syntroleum Corp. studied
the feasibility of a GTL plant at Sanaga in
2005, for example. And building an LNG
complex in Cameroon has been under
consideration for several years.
The challenge with both these options is
the relatively modest gas volumes available
for a plant—at least initially. Both LNG and
GTL operations need a guarantee of large
gas volumes over long periods to be
economically viable.
With this in mind, instead of its own facility,
Cameroon will cooperate with neighboring
Equatorial Guinea, where a large LNG plant
already in place can draw on gas supplies
from several countries in the region.
In Cameroon, the first significant use of
natural gas will be for a badly needed

increase in electricity generation capacity.
Gas available under a 25-year contract
signed by Perenco Cameroon S.A. with
SNH in 2006 to develop the offshore Sanaga

basins will be used to generate power at a

plant at Kribi. Both Perenco and SNH will
invest $50 million in the project. According
to the U.S. Energy Information Administration,
Sanaga Sud could contain 600 billion cu ft
(bcf) of gas.
Operator Perenco’s conceptual studies for
the development of the Sanaga Sud gas field
are complete and gas is expected to be
available in the first quarter of 2009.
Cameroon has also signed an initial
agreement with Equatorial Guinea to supply
natural gas to Equatorial Guinea’s LNG
complex. The agreement is based on studies
that concluded Cameroon had sufficient gas
reserves to supply 200 million cu ft/day
(MMcfd) to the plant for 20 years beginning
in 2010-2011. Those studies also helped
define the infrastructure required for
gathering, processing and transporting the
gas, including conditions for building a
pipeline between the two countries.
Cameroon’s gas development strategy
also calls for an increase in production of
LPG, widely used as domestic fuel in
Cameroon. There are two main plans for
LPG production, said Minister of Energy and
Water Sindeau Jean Bernard. One is a plant
in the Limbé region that would be a private
development. The other, in the southern
region around Kribi, would be related to the
gas delivered to Equatorial Guinea for
conversion to LNG.
To enable SNH to execute its ambitious
gas projects successfully, the Board of
Directors in mid 2007 created a Gas
Directorate within the corporation to
implement the master plan for Cameroon’s
natural gas development.
This was one of the resolutions of the
board of directors’ meeting held in June last
year under the chairmanship of Laurent Esso,
Minister of State, Secretary General of the
Republic and Chairman of the SNH board.
Corporate activities during the first part
of 2007 were reviewed at the meeting,

finance and risk management products, and
advisory services to build the private sector
in developing countries. KPDC is an affiliate
of AES SONEL, the privatized integrated
electric utility of Cameroon. KPDC’s majority
shareholders will be AES Corp. (AES) and
the Government of Cameroon. AES SONEL
will also be the off-taker of the power
produced by KPDC.
AES has over 44,000 mw of installed
capacity in 26 countries. AES SONEL was
privatized in 2001 when AES purchased
56% of its shares. The company, with an
installed capacity of 933 mw and a customer

base of 525,000, operates under a 20-year
concession agreement with the government
of Cameroon.
IFC notes in the proposal that the
Summary of Proposed Investment is
distributed to the public in advance of the
IFC Board of Directors’ consideration of the
proposed transaction in order to enhance
the transparency of IFC’s activities. The
document does not presume the outcome
of the Board decision,
which was expected to
be made at a meeting on
May 20.
The expected project
cost of about $335
million is to be financed
on a debt-to-equity ratio
of 75:25. IFC’s proposed investment is a
loan of up to $85 million (no more than 25%
of total project cost). Other participating
lenders are expected to include European
Investment Bank (EIB), the African
Development Bank (ADB), the Central
African States’ Development Bank (BDEAC),
France’s Investment and Promotions
Company for Economic Cooperation
(Proparco), Emerging Africa Infrastructure
Fund (EAIF) and Netherlands Development
Finance Co. (FMO).

The Sanaga Sud gas facility is not part of
the IFC funding, but it is expected to be the
main supplier of the Kribi plant.
The power plants will help meet
Cameroon’s growing demand for electricity,
and diversify its supply, which currently is
primarily from hydroelectric sources. It will
replace inefficient thermal power plants,
reducing carbon emissions, said IFC.

connected to the Southern Interconnected
Grid (SIG) at the existing Ngodi Bakoko
substation; the site is near the country’s
largest load center and port facilities.
The Kribi plant site is 9 km northeast of the
coastal city of Kribi, close to the Sanaga Sud
gas field. The new transmission line will run
between Kribi and the existing Mangombe
225,000/90,000 volt substation at Edéa in
the Littoral Province.
According to the IFC report, the project is
part of the least cost expansion plan for the
power sector developed during an economic
study commissioned by AES Some. Project
objectives include:
• provide emergency oil-based generation
through Dibamba to reduce power shortages
in 2008/2009;
• meet growing incremental demand for
electricity in the country;
• increase fuel diversity in a hydroelectricdominated electricity sector and improve
long term energy supply security during the
dry season or in years with low rainfall;
• support the development of Cameroon’s
gas resources; and
• generate tax and dividend revenues for
the government.

maintenance,” said Jean David Bilé, CEO,
AES SONEL. “Equipment was in an advanced
state of deterioration.”
To remedy the situation, the government
and AES Corp., agreed to a cooperation
strategy that took the form of a concession
agreement. After the first five years of the
concession, the two parties reviewed the
agreement, and amended it to include a
number of service quality obligations with
which AES must comply, said Mr. Bilé.
These obligations include an investment
plan amounting to about US$1.2 billion over
a period of five years. “It is an ambitious
program, but we have the backing of
international financial institutions and are
continuing to work in close collaboration
with the state,” said Mr. Bilé.
The program involves rehabilitation of
existing generation facilities, including the
company’s main dam at Edea, which is more

than 50 years old, and the Songloulou dam,
commissioned in 1981.
One of the major initial investments
increased thermal capacity by 47 mw. Then
in 2004, AES SONEL built an 85-mw heavy
fuel oil power plant in Limbé as an
emergency response to the energy shortage
the country was facing.
One reason for the development of
alternative sources, especially thermal, was to
address the vagaries of the weather which
result in irregular water flows that can range
from 6,000 cu m/second in the rainy season
to 15 cu m/second in the dry season.
Diversity of sources frees the country from
these weather hazards, and it helps optimize
the management of water resources.
The two thermal plants—Dibamba and
Kribi—will help diversify electricity supply
when they come on stream in 2008 and
2009, respectively.
In addition to these investments, AES
SONEL has invested more than US$250
million on distribution facilities, mainly to
reinforce and extend the system.
“There is, however, a lot left be done,”
said Mr. Bilé. Even though AES-SONEL is
the only operator in charge of generating,
transmitting and distributing electricity in
Cameroon, it is prepared to compete with
others in the sector, he said.
“We like competition and I think we are
ready to face it. There’s talk about the imminent
opening up of the sector to other operators,
and they will be welcome. All we need is
healthy competition. Competition is another
source of motivation. What we need is
clearly defined rules that are applied without
discrimination to other operators.”
Even though AES SONEL expects to be
the main operator for a long time to come,
there is room for other operators in power
generation. For example, the country’s
aluminium production factory, AluCam, has
plans to double its capacity. Though the
factory plans to invest in the construction of
a hydroelectric dam, a good part of the
energy it will need to meet its objective will
come from AES SONEL.
Current regulations allow new operators
to use AES SONEL’s transmission system
with the payment of a fee.

AES SONEL role
In collaboration with the state, AES SONEL
has drawn up an ambitious strategy aimed
at meeting Cameroon’s electricity demand
in both the short and long terms.
Implementation of that strategy, which
depends heavily on natural gas, is in its very
early stages.
“Before privatization, we had fallen far
behind in terms of investment and

There was some thought given to
building an LNG complex in Cameroon to
avoid being dependent on the Equatorial
Guinea facility, said Mr. Ruud Schrama, until
recently President and General Manager of
Pecten Cameroon.
“But there are some technical, water
depth, and commercial constraints,” he said.
“The volumes expected to be available for
LNG—about 200 or 300 MMcfd over a
period of 20-25 years—is not enough to
justify a stand-alone full-size LNG scheme.”
Investors would likely find that this
modest expected production rate would
pose too great a risk.
Cameroon’s business model is also
different from that of the Equatorial Guinea
LNG operation. In Equatorial Guinea, one
large integrated project delivers gas from a
field to the LNG complex. In Cameroon,
there are multiple individual parties, making
it necessary for any LNG plant to be a
business in itself, said Mr. Schrama.
Though in Europe in recent years, a
business model involving smaller fields
rather than one large field has emerged, he
said, to make the exploitation of smaller
discoveries attractive to operators and
investors requires an adequate infrastructure
that is available to all parties.

Natural Gas Potential

The company has several strategies to
attract other potential partners. Because AES
SONEL plays a key role throughout Central
Africa, it envisions an interconnection with
the networks of other countries, namely,
Chad, Gabon, the Central African Republic,
Congo and perhaps Nigeria.
“I think when this interconnection is
made, we will need to conclude partnerships
with the various companies in order to be
able to construct plants and export energy to
neighboring countries,” said Mr. Bilé.
“It will also offer Cameroon
the opportunity to have affordable

that problem, our revenue continues to grow

changes in tariffs or generating output.”
Currently there is rapid growth in the
number of residential customers as a result of
the company’s commitment to the government
to execute an average of 50,000 new
connections per year over the 20 years of the
concession. For 2007, the objective was to
make 48,000 new connections, according
to Mr. Bilé.

Achieving National Promise

Achieving National Promise:
Opportunity, stability, valuable human
“resource” will drive growth

W

ith a foundation of significant oil and
gas resources and a history of attracting
international partners, Cameroon’s future is
enhanced by the strategies it has created to
optimize the value of its petroleum assets.
Foreign firms are welcome in Cameroon,
said Prime Minister Ephraim Inoni recently,
and the country is attracting significant
investment. “People like to invest here because
our policy is liberal and opportunities exist.”
Industrial development and growing
energy demand will bring ambitious projects
that require assistance from those investors,
according to Sindeu Jean Bernard, Minister of
Energy and Water.
“We have seen new initiatives in the past
year that will improve our infrastructure; that
should help attract international companies,” said
Jacky Lesage, General Manager, Cameroon Oil
Transportation Co. (COTCO).

The human element
Nor should the human “resource” be overlooked.
After only four years of operation, Cameroon
citizens make up more than 80% of
COTCO's work force, according to Mr. Lesage.
At the end of 2007, more than 50% of
supervisory and management positions were
occupied by Cameroon nationals.
In the refining sector, SONARA has met
the challenge of national content, said Mr.
Charles Metouck, General Manager. “We
have substantial human resources, including
people educated in the US and in Europe, as
well as people that have been well educated
locally.”
Though AES SONEL’s main mission is to
supply electricity, its role also goes beyond that
sector, said Jean David Bilé, CEO. “We are
developing the skills of our staff both within
the country and abroad. In Cameroon, for
example, we introduced a training program
from the Darden Business School in the US to
improve the management and leadership
capabilities of 200 of our staff.”

COTCO has refurbished about 100 classrooms along the pipeline route.

Electricity’s role
Electricity demand, about 600-700 mw in
2007, was expected to reach about 1,000
mw this year, said Prime Minister Inoni. “In
five years, we might need 1,500 mw.”
In addition to the gas-powered generating
plant at Kribi, the government is considering
building hydroelectric dams at Lom Pangar,
Nachtigal and Memve’ele.
“Supplying the economy with energy
contributes to the development of the economy,”
said Mr. Bilé, “but we need to strike a balance.”
For example, if the electricity sector grows too
quickly, customers must bear the cost of
unused generating capacity. And in rural areas,
economic development does not always follow
the availability of electricity, he said.
AES SONEL’s emphasis is on increasing the
number of domestic customers and improving
the quality and dependability of service. The
company recently received financing for a 240
million mid-term investment program.

Other challenges
If there is a challenge common to many
segments of Cameroon’s economy, it is
infrastructure-highways, airports, pipelines and
petroleum storage. Infrastructure improvement
is critical to economic growth and is the focus
of a range of initiatives. Reducing the cost of
petroleum products in Cameroon is an important

goal, said Mr. Ibrahim Talba Malla, Director
General, Caisse de Stabilisation Prix des
Hydrocarbures (CSPH).
Reducing taxes and import duties would
help. For example, the rate of the fuel tax that
is transferred to the Road Fund can be
decreased and replaced with more funding
from the cost of distribution.
Even though the dispute with Nigeria has
been resolved, there are still challenges to the
stability of the region.
“There are no real boundaries in the north,”
said Prime Minister Inoni. The terrain is such
that even without roads, people can drive
through the border. And in the south, Calabar
port of Nigeria is always silted. For vessels to get
into Calabar, they have to use the eastern part of
the estuary, which is on the Cameroonian side.
In the long term, Cameroon’s relationship
with the US will be important for both parties,
said Niels Marquardt, until recently the US
Ambassador to Cameroon.
Areas to be emphasized include an effort
on the part of both governments to facilitate
the exchange of travelers. One way to do that is
to reciprocally eliminate visa fees. Another
important area is security and peacekeeping.
“Resolution of the Bakassi crisis with
Nigeria, I think, paves the way for Cameroon to
play a stronger role in regional peacekeeping,”
said Ambassador Marquardt.

Oil for tomorrow
THE

PROMISE. THE

PRACTICE.

Technologies developed for the oil sands and heavy oil resources of Alberta are vital to more than tomorrow’s oil supply. They represent
solutions to problems encountered throughout the oil industry.
Problems like managing costs, dealing with labor shortages, handling sulfur, controlling air emissions, producing oil under difficult conditions,
mitigating surface impacts, recycling produced water, capturing and sequestering carbon dioxide, and more.
While it finds solutions to those problems, the oil sands and heavy oil industry develops an unconventional resource that indeed represents
oil supply crucial to many tomorrows.
Progress in the oil sands and heavy oil producing regions of the world means progress in the entire oil industry...and in a world that needs oil.
The Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition is the premier forum for the people who make that progress possible.
Don’t miss this opportunity to present your product or service to a powerful, influential audience. Join PennWell Petroleum Events in this
third year conference and exhibition.
Submit your abstracts on line today for presentation at the Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition.
Abstracts due by October 17, 2008.

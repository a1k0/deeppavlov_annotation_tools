What is
reliability worth?
Overcoming
flow-convergence issues
with maximum
near-wellbore
conductivity.

Industry Challenge
• Improve sustained production
• Consistently create fractures in cased and cemented horizontal wellbores
• Optimize frac design
• Overcome flow-convergence issues, especially in near-wellbore region
Halliburton Solution
CobraMax® H fracturing service (with Hydra-JetSM service through coiled
tubing for perforating) uses a proppant pack as the final stage of each
fracture treatment. Major benefits include:
• Performing multiple-interval treatments individually
• Eliminating the need for packers or separate trips in the hole
• Providing diversion for successive treatments up the hole
Operator Benefit
Halliburton’s CobraMax H service achieved maximum conductivity in the
near-wellbore region. With this service, risk was lowered and completion
costs per BOE reduced (up to 50% lower when compared with
conventionally fractured horizontal wells).
To learn more about how Halliburton puts reliability in action,

Saudis, citing oil attack plans, arrest 172

Gas Supply Association Chairman Chris Conway Apr. 26.
“A combination of increasing activity along with higher per-unit
service and technology rates led US producers to spend about $156
billion last year alone in response to continuing tight supply,” said
Conway, who also is president of gas and power at ConocoPhillips.
“Compared to the $56 billion spent in 2003, that’s an increase
of almost 200%,” he added during a Canadian Embassy briefing
with the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.
While some costs are coming down from peaks reached following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Conway said, expenses remain
high as more unconventional supplies are tapped. International
competition for offshore rigs, deeper resource recovery levels, and
a growing onshore fleet also are contributing, he said.
US gas well completions, nevertheless, were a record 31,587
during 2006, according to an analysis performed for NGSA by ICF
International’s unit EEA Inc. The number of onshore rigs drilling
for gas doubled from 2003 to more than 1,400, it added.
Domestic gas reserves increased to 196 tcf at yearend 2005
from 158 tcf in 1999, the analysis said. Gas reserves in shale, tight
sands, and coalbed formations climbed to 19.9 tcf in 2005 from
18.4 tcf in 2004, it indicated.
Conway said the US gas reserve changes during 2004-05 show
Chinese oil workers released in Ethiopia
that most of the increase in the Lower 48 states came from shale
Seven Chinese workers kidnapped by members of the Ogaden and tight sands formations. “The Rockies and eastern Texas domiNational Liberation Front (ONLF), who attacked a Chinese oil nate recent tight-sand reserve additions,” he said. “The Barnett play
company operating in Ethiopia, have been released, the Chinese in northern Texas dominates shale-gas reserves.”
Foreign Ministry said (OGJ Online, Apr. 27, 2007).
Earlier, a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Baker Hughes to pay $44 million to settle charges
Baker Hughes Inc. and a subsidiary agreed to pay more than
Cross in Ethiopia said the men had been released on Apr. 29 but
declined to provide other details. He said the ICRC would transport $44 million in fines to settle federal charges that it and one of its
the men to a safe location before handing them over to Ethiopian employees violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, said the US
Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commisand Chinese authorities.
The Chinese ministry said survivors of the ONLF attack, along sion on Apr. 26.
The combined fines and penalties are the largest sanction so
with bodies of victims, were flown back to their hometown in
far in an FCPA case, the two federal agencies said. The charges
central China’s Henan Province.
The ONLF launched its attack on Apr. 24, killing 65 Ethiopian stemmed from allegations that Baker Hughes Services International
and nine Chinese workers at the Abule exploration site in Degeh Inc. (BHSI) and one of its employees paid more than $4 million in
Bur Zone in eastern Ethiopia and kidnapping the seven Chinese and bribes over 2 years to an intermediary that the company believed
would relay the payments to a Kazakhstan national oil company
two Ethiopian workers.
The ONLF, which said all of those held were in good health official. Separate SEC charges alleged additional FCPA violations by
and had been treated well, includes ethnic Somalis from Ethiopia’s Baker Hughes in Nigeria, Angola, Indonesia, Russia, Uzbekistan,
eastern Ogaden region who claim to be fighting for self-determi- and Kazakhstan.
BHSI pleaded guilty in federal district court in Houston to
nation.
violating the FCPA’s antibribery provisions, conspiracy to vioNGSA: US gas producers’ costs nearly triple
late the FCPA, and aiding and abetting falsification of its parent
US natural gas producers’ costs have nearly tripled since 2003 company’s records. It simultaneously entered into a deferred
because of growing finding and production costs, reported Natural prosecution agreement with DOJ and accepted responsibility
for its employees’ conduct.
Saudi Arabia’s ministry of interior Apr. 27 announced the arrest
of 172 Islamic militants it said were plotting to attack the country’s
oil installations.
Interior Ministry spokesman Brig. Mansour al-Turki said the
militants had reached an advanced stage of readiness. He said that,
apart from setting the exact time, the militants had the personnel,
money, arms, and all the necessary elements for terror attacks.
The ministry, in a statement read on state television, said police
seized weapons and more than 20 million riyals ($7 million) in
cash from seven armed cells.
“Some had begun training on the use of weapons, and some
were sent to other countries to study aviation in preparation to use
them to carry out terrorist operations inside the kingdom,” the
statement said.
“One of their main targets was to carry out suicide attacks
against public figures and oil installations and to target military
bases inside and outside [the country],” it said.
Regarding the latest arrests, al-Turki said, “It is obvious that the
deviant group is still trying to revive its criminal activities in the
kingdom.”

compliance program, DOJ said. In related charges, SEC said, Baker
Hughes agreed to pay $10 million in civil penalties and more than
$23 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.
SEC said it also charged Roy Fearnley, a former business development manager for Baker Hughes, with violating the FCPA and
aiding and abetting violations of the act. It said Fearnley has not
reached a settlement with the commission.
DOJ said BHSI submitted a bid in February 2000 on behalf of
Baker Hughes to perform project management, oil drilling, support, and other services as four international oil companies and
Kazakhoil developed Karachaganak oil field in Kazakhstan.
Soon after, Kazakhoil demanded that Baker Hughes pay a commission to an Isle of Man consulting firm, which supposedly was
the national oil company’s agent. Although the consulting firm performed no services for Baker Hughes, BHSI agreed in September
2000 to pay it an amount equal to about 2% of its revenue on the
Karachaganak project and 3% on future projects in Kazakhstan.
BHSI was awarded the contract the following month, DOJ said.
From May 2001 through November 2003 it paid $4.1 million in
commissions to the consulting firm’s account in a London bank
from a BHSI account in Houston, the federal agency said.

China’s crude exports fall as imports rise
China’s rising demand for oil is slashing the country’s oil exports and boosting imports, according to statistics released by the
General Administration of Customs.
The agency reported an 83.2% year-on-year decline in oil exports and an 8.8% rise in imports for March.
Cao Xiaoxi, chief engineer of Sinopec’s Economic and Development Research Institute, said the figures reflect a 5% tariff aimed at
discouraging export trade. “It’s a long-term, clear policy to rein in
crude and oil product exports,” Cao said.
The outlook for imports is unclear.
Niu Li, an economist with the State Information Center affiliated with China’s top economic planner, the National Development and Reform Commission, said there is no guarantee that oil
imports will rise this year. He said high global oil prices would
dampen local demand.
In March, China exported 218,988 tonnes of oil. In February
it exported no oil, while January exports stood at 300,000 tonnes.
During the next 2-3 months, Chinese demand gains against
year-earlier levels are projected at 6% for diesel, 6.5% for gasoline,
5.5% for kerosine, and 20% for naphtha. ✦

Chevron shuts down Nigeria production after attack
Chevron Corp. has shut down 15,000 b/d of oil production
in Nigeria after one Nigerian sailor was killed and six foreign oil
workers were kidnapped by members of the militant group Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), who attacked Chevron’s Oloibiri floating production, storage, and offloading vessel off southern Bayelsa State on May 1.
A Chevron spokesperson said the firm had shut down the production from Funiwa oil field to avoid any additional security or
safety incidents following the attack. The FPSO supports the Funiwa oil field.
MEND spokesman Jomo Gbomo said the hostages would be released on May 30, if oil companies and Bayelsa State government
officials made no attempt to secure their release or offered ransom
money.
Gbomo, who warned that such offers would be viewed as a
“slight” and would “worsen the situation of these hostages,” identified the men as Raffele Pascariello, Alfonso Frawza, Ignazio Gugliota, Mario Celetano, John Stapleton, and Juricha Ruis.
Gbomo said the attack on Chevron’s facilities should also be
interpreted as a warning to Royal Dutch Shell PLC, which has recently returned to fields in Bayelsa and Delta states earlier attacked
by MEND. MEND is fighting for more local control over the Niger
Delta’s oil wealth.

Sakhalin-1 partners drill record ERD Well

Air Act, the US Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency said May 1.
The Total SA subsidiary agreed to make $37 million of changes
designed to reduce the plant’s sulfur dioxide emissions by more
than 800 tons/year, nitrogen oxides by more than 180 tons/year,
and carbon monoxide by more than 120 tons/year, the federal

company ExxonMobil Corp.
The Z-11 well is the 17th ERD producing well to be completed
as part of the multiphase Sakhalin-1 project. It was drilled in 61
days, more than 15 days ahead of schedule, and below expected
cost with no safety or environmental incidents, ExxonMobil said.
The Sakhalin-1 project includes Chayvo field, which lies 5-7
miles offshore. The Z-11 well was drilled to the Chayvo reservoir
from the Yastreb rig—the world’s largest land-based drilling rig,
ExxonMobil said. Chayvo field reached its peak production rate of
250,000 b/d of oil in February after startup in October 2005.
Since the first Sakhalin-1 well was drilled in 2003, the time
required to drill these world-class wells has been reduced by more
than half, ExxonMobil said.
ENL holds 30% interest in the Sakhalin-1 project and serves as
operator. Other partners are Japan’s Sakhalin Oil & Gas Development Co. Ltd. 30%, Rosneft units RN-Astra 8.5% and Sakhalinmorneftegas-Shelf 11.5%, and India’s ONGC Videsh Ltd. 20%.

The settlement is the first for a US refinery to include fixed penalties for the flaring of hydrocarbon gases, according to EPA. Under
the agreement, penalties will apply to future flaring at the plant of
both acid gas and hydrocarbon gases that contain hydrogen sulfide
and sulfur dioxide.
Total also agreed to install a supplemental environmental project
in which it will install new infrared cameras to detect equipment
leaks, EPA said. Such leaks may contain emissions which contribute
to ground-level ozone and smog.

propylene oxide-styrene monomer (POSM) manufacturing facility
in Ningbo, China, across Hangzhou Bay from Shanghai.
The plant will produce 274,000 tonnes/year of propylene oxide and 602,000 tpy of styrene under an agreement that also will
allow SZRC to tap into Lyondell’s POSM technology.
Feedstock will come from an SZRC plant now under construction that will be capable of producing 1 million tpy of ethylene.
A Sinopec spokesman said the project is 75% owned by SZRC and
25% by Lyondell.
Lyondell said it will contribute POSM technology and overall
operating and technical experience in exchange for a share of the
propylene oxide (PO) profitability from the plant. It said the two
partners will jointly market all PO manufactured by the new facility, which is due for completion in 2009.
China’s National Development and Reform Commission wants
to more than double the country’s ethylene output capacity. It plans
a 4.38 million-tonne increase by upgrading existing plants and a
further 6.2 million-tonne increase through construction of new
facilities.
China produced 7.55 million tonnes of ethylene in 2005.

Heavy Industries Co. and Itochu Corp. for the construction of three
separation trains at the GP1/Z liquefied petroleum gas plant within
the Arzew industrial complex in western Algeria.
The project, due for completion by September 2010, includes
the three LPG trains having a separation capacity of 1 million
tonnes each and two temperature-controlled product stocking jigs,
each with a capacity of 70,000 cu m.
The plants will have a total capacity of 3 million tonnes/year
of commercial propane and butane and will be integrated into the
Arzew complex at Oran. They will be supplied by Sonatrah’s LPG
terminal in Béthioua.

Suncor starts maintenance at Sarnia reﬁnery

Suncor Energy Products Inc., Calgary, said it will begin planned

The work, which will start on the refinery’s alkylation and catalytic cracker units, is expected to be complete in June.
The refinery’s hydrocracker unit also is scheduled to be shut
down for about 8 weeks, beginning in August, to complete modifications designed to enable the refinery to process sour crude from
the company’s oil sands operation.

Shell plans LNG terminal at Fos-sur-Mer
Shell Energy Europe plans to build an LNG regasification terminal at Fos-sur-Mer on southeastern France’s Mediterranean coast.
Shell signed an agreement with Port of Marseille authorities for the
project, which will have an initial capacity of about 8 billion cu
m/year in the first stage. Costs have not yet been disclosed.
The terminal will not be operational before 2015, considering
the many authorizations needed, said Shell France spokeswoman
Mathilde Nithard.
The regasification terminal would have the same capacity as the
Fos Cavaou terminal that Gaz de France and Total ASA expect to
have on stream at yearend near the site of Shell’s planned terminal.
Both plants are larger than Gaz de France’s existing terminal at Fossur-Mer.
Surprisingly, the project was announced barely a month after a
CGT strike that blocked the Fos-sur-Mer hydrocarbon terminal for
more than 2 weeks in March, costing refineries in the area about
€25 million (OGJ, Apr. 9, 2007, Newsletter).
At the time, the strike seemed likely to discourage further area
investments, but Shell’s project timetable allows time for things to
change, Nithard pointed out.
Shell’s regasification terminal is the last in a list of such projects
recently announced for France’s coasts. ExxonMobil a year ago had
a similar project in view at Fos but has since abandoned it.

Official reports said the line will link Myanmar’s deepwater port
of Sittwe with Kunming, the capital of China’s southwestern Yunnan Province. Myanmar also will receive a Chinese government
loan of some $83 million to develop its oil resources.
Further reports said China also will invest 8 billion yuan ($1
billion) to build a 2,380-km natural gas pipeline linking Myanmar
with Kunming.

Jamaica to put out bids for ﬂoating LNG terminal

State-owned Petroleum Corp. of Jamaica has put out bids for
a floating LNG terminal and is also seeking “bridging volumes of
LNG” to facilitate its planned 2009 first receipt of LNG.
Jamaica has been trying to get LNG from Trinidad and Tobago
and even signed a memorandum of understanding with the Caribbean island, but earlier this year the twin-island nation told Jamaica it would not be able to meet the 2009 start-up date because
it does not have additional LNG available.
In the prequalification documents Jamaica said it appears that
neither Trinidad and Tobago nor Venezuela can provide LNG by the
start-up date.
The document reads, “It appears that LNG from either of these
two sources (Trinidad and Venezuela) will not be available in time
to meet the 2009 target for the first gas in Jamaica. Therefore the
government of Jamaica is now seeking bridging volumes of LNG
to facilitate the 2009 start up.”
China-Myanmar oil line funded; gas line planned
Jamaica will open bids on June 15 for the floating LNG termiChina’s National Development and Reform Commission has nal, which will now replace the $350 million regasification facility

A Gulf of Mexico evolution

Nina M. Rach
Drilling Editor
After granting several individual exceptions, the US Minerals Management
Service is establishing standard operating procedures for managed-pressure
drilling (MPD) in the Gulf of Mexico.
With a shift toward deeper drilling,
operators are examining all technologies to improve safety and control costs.
Drillers need precise control over
downhole pressures because of the
narrowed window between downhole
pore pressure and allowable hydrostatic
pressure in the fluid column. Excess hydrostatic pressures can cause formation
or “skin” damage, reduce productivity,
and waste drilling fluids.
Operators say MPD facilitates exploration and development because it
allows drilling not otherwise technically
possible. MPD uses an equivalent mud
weight that combines static mud weight,
equivalent circulating density, and
surface backpressure maintained at or
generally above openhole pore pressure.
MPD allows controlled returns to
surface. Proponents attest that the closed
mud returns system is inherently safer
than conventional systems that are open
to the atmosphere. Closed, pressurized
systems have become common on US
land rigs.
There are several variations of MPD:
• Constant bottomhole pressure
(BHP), in which the objective is to maintain a constant annular pressure profile, as
covered in the proposed MMS guidelines.
• Pressurized mudcap drilling, used
to prevent cross flow in fractured formations and lost-circulation zones.

• Dual-gradient MPD, in which a
lighter fluid is injected into the annulus
to change the hydrostatic head in part
of the wellbore.
• Health, safety, and environment, in
which the closed mud returns system
prevents accidental exposure to hazardous gases.
Both underbalanced drilling and
MPD are being implemented worldwide, as seen during 2 days of project
reviews at the recent International
Association of Drilling Contractors/Society of Petroleum Engineers Managed
Pressure Drilling and Underbalanced
Operations Conference in Galveston.

MMS notice
Fred Hefren of MMS gave an update on the proposed notice to lessees
pertaining to MPD and discussed how
permitting might be streamlined.
He said the MMS will continue to
review MPD projects and use what it
learns to establish policy, work with industry to develop standards and policies
required to permit MPD, and continue
to issue permits case by case until standards are approved.
Don Hannegan of Weatherford
Controlled Pressure Drilling & Testing
Services, SPE distinguished lecturer for
2006-07, told OGJ that the IADC MPD
subcommittee and the Offshore Operators Committee (OOC) contributed
materials to the MMS in an effort to
avoid development of overly prescriptive regulations.”.
Mike Conner, MMS section chief,
told OGJ on Apr. 30 that the draft of the
notice to lessees discussed in Galveston
is being reviewed in Washington, DC,
and that he expects it to be issued in 2-3
months. “Basically, what was presented
in the draft is what engineers will use for
guidelines” in applications for drilling
permits, he said. Permitting would not
change dramatically under the MMS ini-

tiative, although familiarity should speed
approvals. MPD guidelines will need to
be incorporated into drilling regulations.
MMS last issued revised drilling
regulations in March 2003.
Four operators have applied for
permits to use MPD in the gulf. Conner said only two have gone forward.
Unocal used the constant BHP variation
from a production platform south of
Galveston. Shell Exploration & Production used a dynamic annular pressure
control system to produce a constant
BHP while drilling the Mars A-14
sidetracks from a tension-leg platform.
Shell discussed the project in Galveston,
calling the system a “promising new
tool” for drilling narrow pore-pressure
and fracture-gradient windows.

Research projects
In 2004, the Drilling Engineers Association sponsored DEA 155, which
attracted funding from the MMS and is
also known as Technology Assessment
and Research Project 582, “A Probabilistic Approach to Risk Assessment of
Managed Pressure Drilling in Offshore
Drilling Applications.”
Principal Investigator Ken Malloy of
MOHR Engineering is leading this joint
industry project involving operators,
contractors, and regulatory bodies to
develop cohesive MPD practices.
On Mar. 27, 2007, MMS issued a
progress report for Project 582. Since
the Houston kickoff meeting in May
2006, MOHR has listed and described
MPD variations and has transferred
MPD data from Gulf of Mexico drilling
reports. MOHR is reviewing MPD drilling report data; writing risk-reliability
practices; creating a common data
exchange for consistency of various descriptions between operators; soliciting
additional data; and creating a database.
Industry has embraced MPD and
will benefit from MMS’s adoption of

Fuels and political favors
Political motivations for government action on
renewable energy have roared into full view in the
US. The sight isn’t pretty.
Protests have emerged in Washington, DC,
against a plan announced last month by ConocoPhillips and Tyson Foods Inc. to use animal fat in
the production of ultralow-sulfur diesel fuel. The
companies earlier secured a ruling by the Internal
Revenue Service that their process qualifies for a
$1/gal tax credit that the Energy Policy Act of 2005
(EPACT) created for diesel made via thermal depolymerization of waste oils and fats. They plan to
process about 1 billion lb/year of fat with hydrocarbon streams at ConocoPhillips refineries, eventually producing as much as 175 million gal/year of
what the oil company calls “renewable diesel.”

The protest
Protesting lawmakers want to overturn the tax
interpretation, which ConocoPhillips Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer James Mulva says is
essential to profitability of the venture with Tyson.
According to the Houston Chronicle, Rep. Lloyd
Doggett (D-Tex.) planned to introduce legislation correcting the “abuse.” The IRS interpretation
came after Rep. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), sponsor of the
thermal-depolymerization tax break, warned the
agency against broadening the provision’s scope.
Changing World Technologies, West Hempstead,
NY, uses thermal depolymerization and the tax
break to make biodiesel from animal and other
food wastes at a plant in Carthage, Mo., which is
in Blunt’s district.
The early-April IRS ruling angered the National
Biodiesel Board, a trade group in Jefferson, Mo. “If
Congress lets this stand,” said Joe Jobe, the group’s
chief executive, “our government will be handing
over US taxpayer money to some of the richest
companies in the world, and it will not provide
many of the benefits that the biodiesel tax incentive has given back to America.” EPACT added the
thermal-depolymerization credit while extending
the $1/gal biodiesel incentive enacted in 2004. In
a list of objections to the IRS ruling, the biodiesel group said, “The oil companies could put a
stranglehold on materials used to make biodiesel,
stunting the growth of the biodiesel industry.”
In a business with plenty of room to grow,

worry about “strangleholds” seems ingenuous.
Biodiesel capacity in place at the beginning of this
year amounted to 56,000 b/d, less than 2% of the
US diesel market. ConocoPhillips plans to make, at
most, 11,400 b/d of its renewable diesel. Where’s
the stranglehold? Or is this just a coddled industry
wanting to avoid competition?
A larger question lurks in the dust-up. What
does Congress really want from renewable energy?
The usual explanations—environmental benefits and displacement of foreign oil—are long past
tiresome, usually exaggerated, and often wrong.
To whatever extent they’re valid, Congress should
welcome energy from untraditional sources in
whatever amounts it comes, whatever its source.
For too many lawmakers, though, the real motive is much different from those advertised. The
real motive is to dispense political favors, such as
tax credits and market guarantees for suppliers
of uneconomic energy. With prices elevated for
gasoline and diesel fuel—thanks partly to laws and
regulations making both fuels much costlier than
ever to produce—voters dislike political favors to
oil companies. So when an oil company avails itself
of an incentive for an activity Congress supposedly
wants to encourage, it has committed “abuse.”
Contradictions of purpose like this emerge
whenever a government chooses fuels and decides
who profits from the incentives it must concoct
to bring costly energy to market. The inevitably
political choices corrupt energy policy. They also
cost too much.

Money machine
Another National Biodiesel Board objection to
expansion of the thermal polymerization incentive is that it will become “an unanticipated drain
on the US Treasury.” This is unvarnished hypocrisy. It should make lawmakers who saw fit to
turn energy policy into a magic money machine
cringe. Better yet, it should make them confine
the governmental role in energy to research and
let markets do the rest. Renewable energy should
develop efficiently and sustainably, which means
competitively.
Most of all, Congress should quit fleecing
Americans. Its manipulations are corroding the
economy and the credibility of energy policy. ✦

The oil and gas industry has entered
a new era characterized by diversity of
energy supply, market uncertainty, and
changing roles for oil companies, said
speakers at the Offshore Technology
Conference in Houston Apr. 30-May 3.
Among key elements of this new
era are alternative energy sources
subsidized by governments, increased
concern about global climate change,
soaring exploration and production
costs, supply and
demand uncertainties, and the need for
maintaining price
and market stability.
Those subjects
received attention in several general
sessions at the 2007 OTC, at which
registration was expected at presstime
last week to meet or surpass last year’s
24-year high of 59,236.
In other sessions, speakers addressed
technical advances and trends in the
Gulf of Mexico as well as regional
developments in Norway, Nigeria, Nova
Scotia, and Sri Lanka.

SPECIAL

Offshore Technology Update

Panel discussion
In a panel discussion, Sadek Broussena, former Algerian Minister of
Energy and current advisor at Société
Générale, said the “new market” equals
“uncertainty.”
Resulting from increases in oil pric20

es, increasingly stringent environmental
regulations, and geopolitics, uncertainty
about future demand and the supply
ultimately available from alternative
sources complicates decisions about
investments in oil production.
Broussena said the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries has an
interest in keeping the market stable
and tries to adjust members’ output to
meet market requirements. But it also
must develop spare capacity, which
Brousenna estimated at 2-2.5 million
b/d, primarily in Saudi Arabia.
Another panelist, Edgard Habib,
chief economist at Chevron Corp., said
a global oil-demand shift in the direction of Asia and an increase in nationalism worldwide are changing the
geography of energy. “We are living in a
very robust globalization,” he said, with
great flows of trade, information, and
money. “This environment is very good
for the energy industry because of the
balance of trade.”
Habib said, “Governments can alter
the fuel mix. We’ll have to wait and see
what happens with the climate change
issue.” The US was the first nation
to mandate reductions in the sulfur
content of gasoline and diesel. But it
will not accept the Kyoto Protocol on
Climate Change, he said, “because it
would shave 2% off US gross domestic
product, which would not be tolerated”
while China is growing at such a rapid
pace and using so much coal.
Cornelia Meyer, chairman and
vice-president, UK, the British Swiss
Chamber of Commerce, said OPEC has
emphasized that investment in infrastructure depends on demand security.
“One of the biggest threats to
security of demand is high oil price,”
said Meyer. “If it is too high, investors
will go to renewables and nuclear.”
Consistently high prices also stimulate
conservation. She said energy efficiency
can cut demand by 10% by 2030.
Keeping prices high enables investment in fossil fuel developments such
as tar sands and shale that otherwise
would be ignored as uneconomic,
countered Broussena. He said OPEC

cannot make or control prices because
other market forces affect price, but it
wants to “influence” prices. “OPEC’s
one objective is to stabilize the market,
and prices are very important to that
end,” he said.
Hasan Qabazard, director of the
OPEC Secretariat’s research division,
said the price band OPEC targeted during 1989-98 was too low. It caused a
surge in demand and a proliferation of
sports utility vehicles until 2003, when
spare production capacity decreased and
the price of oil rose. “It killed investment, basically. We are not defending
any price,” Qabazard said. Broussen added, “If prices will stay at this
level [$50-60/bbl], OPEC will be very
happy.”
Habib said, “Sixty-five dollar oil has
not affected the world economy in the
least.”
Faud Al-Zayer, head of the OPEC Secretariat’s statistics division, said balance
is the key to creating security of supply
and demand and to developing cooperation between national oil companies
and international oil companies.
Al-Zayer said the organization is
committed to ensuring adequate oil
supply and is investing heavily in new
capacity because spare capacity helps
stabilize the market.
Nimat Abu Al-Soof, OPEC Secretariat
upstream oil industry analyst, said
OPEC has more than 130 projects in
execution or planning stages, mostly
downstream. He said planned upstream
capacity expansion projects involve
investments of $200-370 billion by
2020. “OPEC spare capacity could build
to 6-9 million b/d before 2010,” while
requirements for OPEC crude likely will
drop or remain flat until 2009.
Habib said the boom in investment
will enable technology to unlock upstream and downstream production.
“The impression that we are running
out of oil” is erroneous, Al-Zayer said,
adding that OPEC has almost doubled
its conventional resources since 1960.
“We expect that to continue.”

A pessimistic view
A pessimistic view of offshore supply
came in a separate OTC session from
Matthew Simmons of Simmons & Co.
International.
Peak offshore oil production is a
reality, Simmons said, but the oil and
gas industry isn’t certain when it will
occur—or if it has already happened—or
what to do about it. The debate over peak
oil, he said, eventually will surpass global
warming as an issue of general concern.
Even the rate of oil production
decline is debatable because of “awful
energy data.” Most rates of decline are
based anecdotally on specific areas, he
said, adding that the global decline is
probably 10-20%/year.
Relying on oil sands and shales for
future oil supply is like “turning gold
into lead,” Simmons said, referring to
the energy needed to produce from
these unconventional sources.
If the industry is to stave off a rapid
offshore oil production decline, Simmons said, its offshore drilling fleet will
need to be replaced and refurbished. It
can mitigate the decline in offshore oil
production by drilling more rapidly, he
said. Unless the rig fleet expands, however, the production decline eventually
will accelerate.
The world’s 51 fourth-generation
offshore rigs now average 18.7 years in
age, while the 34 ultradeepwater rigs
average 9.8 years, Simmons said. “The
offshore fleet is getting long in the
tooth.”
And how long refurbishment can
last “is a mystery,” Simmons said. “Rust
never stops; it can only be slowed
down.”
The world’s drilling fleet currently
has 126 new rigs or upgrades pending,
some of which will start entering the
fleet by 2008. Overbook, meanwhile, is
stretched beyond 2011, he said.
While technological advances will
stretch out the oil production decline
curve, these “will be limited in scope,”
Simmons said.
In the mid to long-term, life after
the peak of offshore oil production will
be based on energy from the ocean but

not hydrocarbons, Simmons said.
Water covers 70% of the planet, but
scientists know only about 5% of the
ocean floor, which is “the last lowhanging energy fruit.”

Climate change
Although fossil fuels will continue to
be vital energy sources worldwide well
into the future, the oil and gas industry
can adapt its business to help ensure a
transition toward a low-carbon global
economy, UK Energy Minster Peter Truscott told an OTC luncheon.
The UK has introduced its own
climate-change legislation, and it
acknowledges the need for international cooperation toward reducing
greenhouse-gas emissions. Constraints
on carbon emissions will be mandated
sooner or later, and most businesses
would prefer the certainty of a regime,
Truscott said.
“In our view, government can never
supplant business in providing technology solutions,” he said, adding that
governments are in a position to work
toward an integrated policy on energy
security and climate change.
“In March, European leaders...
announced an ambitious, integrated
European climate and energy policy,
including an independent target to cut
greenhouse-gas emissions across Europe
by 20% by 2020 in relation to 1990’s;
also to introduce efficiency measures to
cut by 20% total European energy consumption predicted for 2020,” Truscott
said. “The objective that lay at the heart
of these decisions was to set Europe on
the fast-track to becoming the world’s
first competitive, energy-secure, lowcarbon economy.”
Climate change issues have been a
UK priority since 2005 when Prime
Minister Tony Blair deemed it an
international priority issue. Recently,
UK environmental officials outlined
legislation setting a series of targets for
reducing carbon dioxide emissions with
a 60% reduction in CO2 emissions by
2050. The UK government expects to
publish a white paper in May regarding
domestic energy policy.

Truscott advocates a public-private
partnership in which the UK government encourages the development of
carbon pricing and trading schemes
that ensure energy prices reflect all
production and consumption costs,
including environmental costs. The UK
government also encourages technology
development.
“We see government’s role as
stimulating investment in a broad range
of [research and development] activities,” Truscott said. “This will not only
include the use of carbon pricing but
also government funding aimed at accelerating the development and market penetration of new lower carbon
technologies and supportive regulatory
frameworks—for example by raising
building and product standards and
using public procurement to create
market pull for the most efficient technologies.”

China’s growth
China’s economic growth poses great
uncertainty for the global oil and gas
business because it will affect oil supply
and demand, said Fatih Birol, International Energy Agency chief economist.
The World Bank and International
Monetary Fund have continuously
underestimated China’s economic
growth, he said in a panel discussion on
energy challenges and future directions.
Assuming 6.7%/year GDP growth for
China over the next 15-30 years in a
reference case, IEA says Chinese oil demand might grow from 7 million b/d
at present to 11 million b/d.
Birol cautioned that China expects
its GDP growth to be higher, which
would mean greater oil requirements.
“China wants to move away from heavy
industry to light services, and this could
affect its oil demand,” he said.
Oil price elasticity of demand is
losing importance, according to Birol,
because member countries of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have become
richer and are less sensitive to energy
prices changes compared with developing countries. Energy consumption is

Delano said NPDC has witnessed
market growth in Middle East and the
Far East, when 30 years ago Nigeria
dealt primarily with the West. A key
challenge for NOCs is balancing domestic supply needs with the economic
compulsion to export oil, he said. “Customers are now driven by market issues
and security of supply.”
Only 15% of delegates said IOCs will
determine the future rules of doing business in energy, followed by 12% voting
for those with breakthrough technologies, and 3% asserting it would be owners of assets, rigs, and large vessels.
Two main trends are shaping the
ways NOCs do business, said Sell of
the US Department of Energy. “Their
governments see them as cash cows to
gain revenues to invest in other social
programs; they focus on control of the
reserves and prohibit others from coming in to develop them.”
For Jesús Reyes-Heroles, director
general of Petroleos Mexicanos, the
challenge facing NOCs is developing
the financial resources to meet investment needs. He said Mexico’s congress

“The oil demand is in the transportation sector,” Birol said. “Around 98% of
growth for oil came from the transport
sector, and we can’t switch to another
fuel more easily.”
Birol stressed that vehicle energy efficiency is important, saying, “This could
have more of an effect than turning to
biofuels.” He said it was important that
the government take the initiative to
help develop biofuels, which cannot be
left to market forces.
Another panelist, Clay Sell, US deputy secretary of energy, said research by

Gulf of Mexico
The importance to the Gulf of Mexico of deepwater operations received
attention in a US Minerals Management
Service report released at OTC.
Deepwater leases last year produced
70% of the oil and 40% of the natural
gas produced in the gulf, according to
the report, Deepwater Gulf of Mexico
2007: Interim Report of 2006 Highlights. It said oil and gas operators
announced 12 deepwater discoveries in
2006, with the deepest in 7,600 ft of
water.
More than half of the active oil and
gas leases in the gulf are in more than
1,000 ft of water, which MMS defines
as deep water.
“There’s solid evidence in both leasing and exploration activities to confirm
the oil and gas industry’s continued
interest and motivation to explore and
develop the deepwater frontier in the
Gulf of Mexico,” Lars Herbst, acting
GOM regional director, told reporters at
an OTC news conference.
In gulf Outer Continental Shelf
lease sales, the number of tracts in
1,500-4,999 ft of water receiving bids
increased by 32% from 2005 to 2006.
The number of tracts in 5,000-7,499
ft of water receiving bids increased by
29%.
“MMS granted 30 new technology approvals in 2006,” noted Herbst.
“This set a record for the number of approvals for first-time use of technology
in deep water.”
Examples of technology advancements that MMS approved for use on
federal leases during 2006 include:
• A high-integrity pressure-protection system (HIPPS). Although a HIPPS
has not been proposed for a specific
development, MMS did approve the
general concept in July 2006. The
system allows use of pipelines not rated
for the well’s full shut-in tubing pressure (SITP). The HIPPS employs valves,
logic controllers, and pressure transmitters to protect the unrated section
before the pipeline is overpressured or
ruptured (rather than relying simply
on steel strength). A section of pipe
24

upstream of the well and downstream
of the HIPPS valves—as well as a short
section of pipe upstream of the HIPPS
values—will be rated to the full SITP.
• The use of preset polyester moorings for deepwater drilling rigs. The use
of polyester mooring lines on production facilities still is considered a new
technology in the gulf even though it
is common practice to use this type of
mooring line on mobile offshore drilling units. One stipulation for allowing
the use of polyester moorings traditionally has been that the polyester moorings may not come in contact with the
seafloor. After studying the polyester
moorings, MMS granted approval for
preset moorings with the stipulation
that the lines be inspected and tested
every 6 months.
• Various forms of subsea boosting such as a subsea pump allowing
enhanced oil recovery. Shell Exploration
& Production Co. proposed a separation
and boosting system that will separate
production fluids at the seafloor and
direct them to the surface host via a
pump at the base of a production riser
for use at the Perdido development. BP
Exploration & Production Inc. received
approved to use electric subsea multiphase pumps at King field. The pumps
will boost operating system pressure,
lowering flowing tubing pressures at
each well. This increases flow rates,
which will extend the field’s life by
an estimated 2 years and will increase
ultimate recovery.
• A conceptual plan for a floating
production, storage, and offloading
vessel. Petrobras America Inc. submitted a conceptual deepwater operations
plan for installation of an FPSO with
two wells in Cascade field and one well
in Chinook field. Initial production
from these fields is expected in 2009.
A single point disconnectable turret
mooring system will ensure the FPSO
can leave in case of hurricanes. Another
new technology involved was the use of
free-standing hybrid risers.

Special Report

is forecast to rise to as much as 2.1 million b/d by 2016 from current levels of
1.35-1.4 million b/d, MMS said.
Total gulf oil production is expected
to exceed 1.7 million b/d from existing
shallow and deepwater commitments
by operators. If announced discoveries
and undiscovered resources realize their
full potential, production could reach
2.1 million b/d.
Natural gas production is forecast to
recover in the next 3 years to a possible
high of 8.3 bcfd from 8 bcfd today,
MMS said in its “Gulf of Mexico Oil and
Gas Production Forecast: 2007-16.”
Activity used for the forecast included 16 deepwater projects scheduled
to come on stream by Dec. 31. Independence Hub, expected to start gas
production during the second half of
2007, is forecast to be the biggest single
contributor to gas production.
Independence Hub involves a consortium of companies gathering gas
from seven deepwater fields. Anadarko
Petroleum Corp. is the operator.
Oil production in the gulf increased
steadily during 1991-2001, leveled off
through 2003, and declined in 200405, partly because of hurricanes.
Shallow-water production declined
steadily after 1997 but was offset by
increasing deepwater oil production
during most of that time.
Gas production has followed a similar trend, but increasing deepwater gas
production hasn’t prevented an overall
decline in total gulf gas production during 2006, MMS said.

Deepwater expandables

During OTC, Nexen Petroleum
USA Inc. said it installed 6,867 ft of
an openhole solid expandable tubular (SET) system in Aspen oil field on
Green Canyon Block 243 off Louisiana.
Enventure Global Technology provided the system, which was installed Mar.

world record water depth for a SET system. Aspen 1 is in 3,143 ft of water.

in the deepwater gulf in the future.
Nexen planned to drill through
depleted sands at its producing Aspen
project to 24,000 ft, but the first sidetrack to the original wellbore took an
influx at 20,000 ft.
To preserve production of 5,000
b/d, Nexen wanted to maximize hole
size for a second sidetrack and chose a
SET system to reach 24,000 ft with a 7in. flush-joint liner. Expandable tubulars
enabled Nexen to isolate depleted zones
and attain the hole size.
Enventure said the project involve

be concerned about deck elevation of

“60% had wave in the deck.”

A ﬁrst in Norway
Among other regional reports, Statoil
ASA issued a project update for the
world’s first full-scale subsea separation
system at Tordis field, off Norway.
Statoil’s Hans Kristiansen told OGJ
that Subsea 7 was to begin drilling the
injector well May 4 using the Bjorland
Dolphin rig. Drilling to 1,000 m will
take about 40 days, to get to the Miocene Utsira formation, Europe’s largest
saltwater and carbon dioxide storage
formation. This will reduce future water
discharge into the sea.
The subsea separation station was
built by Kongsberg FMC and is scheduled for installation in August. The
1,200-tonne module will be installed in
a single lift by the Saipem 7000 heavylift vessel. Commissioning is expected
to take about 6 weeks, with first production by Oct. 1.
Statoil expects to recover an additional 35 million bbl of oil from Tordis
using the new subsea separation system.
Tordis has been producing oil since
1994 through a tieback to Staoil’s
Gullfaks C platform. Water production
has increased to 70-80% over the last
few years and sand production to about
500 kg/day. In 2003, Statoil began to
plan a subsea separation, boosting, and
injection system in order to prolong
production 15-20 years. In 2005, Statoil
awarded a $100 million contract for
the separation, boosting, and injection
system to FMC Technologies Inc. (OGJ
Online, Nov. 10, 2005).
In 2006, CDS Engineering BV and
FMC Kongsberg were recognized with
an OTC Spotlight award for their Tordis
compact subsea separator with integrated solids handling (OGJ, May 8, 2006,
p. 25).
FMC’s Ann Christin Gjerdseth told
OGJ that Statoil installed a small pipeline inline manifold at Tordis in 2006
to reroute the Tordis well stream to
Gullfaks C via the new subsea separation station.
Gjerdseth said the design highlights
of the Tordis separator are the internal level detectors for sand, emulsion,
water, and oil and the gas bypass line,

which allows the size of the separator
to be greatly reduced. The integrated
sand management system includes a
gravity-based cyclonic device. The sand
slurry will be injected downstream of
the water-injection pump, which was
qualified with tungsten carbide impellers, for increased wear resistance.
One of the most significant aspects
of the engineering process was moving topside technology to the seafloor,
said Gjerdseth. This required a shift to
meld the differences between heavily
instrumented topside design with the
guiding principles of simple, easily replaceable component design for subsea
installations, where equipment interaction is limited. FMC worked toward an
acceptable level of process control and
instrumentation within the short delivery time and limited weather window
for installation.
While the current tank design is
workable to 1,500 m, the material limit
is only about 2,000 m. Ultradeep installations will require inline separation,
Gjerdseth said. Future innovations for
deepwater projects will include subsea
compression facilities and long-distance
power transmission.

Golfino started production last May
through the Capixaba floating production, storage, and offloading system.
“The Cidade de Vitória FPSO will go
into operation in the same field in the
second half of 2007. Each of these units
is capable of producing 100,000 b/d,”
Petrobras said.
Separately, Brazil plans to launch its
ninth bidding round in September or
October, Energy Minister Silas Rondeau
said. He explained that the bidding
round has been delayed because of
difficulties in allocating blocks but did
not give details on how many would be
offered or their locations.
Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da
Silva is expected soon to announce a
number of business initiatives to help
develop the country’s oil and gas industry, Rondeau added.

Nigerian investment

Nigeria expects to see $60 billion of
oil and gas investment across a variety
of operations through 2008 and more
after that, said Fisoye Delano, managing

Over 2 million b/d of additional production from offshore fields in 200611 is planned.
Susan Farrell, senior director of corporate advisory services at PFC Energy,
raised questions about future deepwater
production in Nigeria. “As new discovery sizes fall and companies develop
their portfolios faster than they find
new fields, there is a predictable peak to
the current investment and production
growth cycle,” she said.
Farrell said the geological potential
of Nigeria is high but noted that political risks limit onshore and shallow-water prospects.
“Nigeria has 500,000 b/d of oil shut
in, and we think it will stay offline until
the end of the year,” she said.
Delano assured delegates that the
government is working to engage rebellious Niger Delta communities and
share value from oil and gas developments in those areas.
The Niger Delta receives only 13%
of the wealth generated from oil and
gas in their region. Militants from the
Niger Delta are pressing for 50% of the
proceeds, while the government has
proposed 18%.

Neil DeSilva, director general, Petroleum Resources Development Secretariat.
DeSilva said Sri Lanka will offer three
parcels in the Mannar basin off the west
coast. The basin has been divided into
eight blocks. India and China’s state oil
companies have been promised one
block each.
DeSilva said Sri Lanka’s oil and gas
potential is supported by its shared
geology with countries that have commercial oil and gas production.

Nova Scotia

an offshore licensing round was Nova
Scotia. The province plans to launch the
round in November with flexible terms
aimed at attracting midsize companies
in particular, said Diana Lee Dalton,
chair of the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board.
Dalton said high costs have prevented midsize independent companies
from pursuing exploration, and the
petroleum industry has complained that
Nova Scotia has a burdensome regulatory regime. “We want to offer smaller
companies terms that mean they can get
out in 3 years if they don’t find something,” she said. Nova Scotia recently
implemented initiatives to streamline its
regulatory process.
Nova Scotia, a proven oil and gas
province, is relatively underexplored
with only 127 exploration wells drilled

on the Scotian Shelf. Producers have
a 7-month window in which to drill
wells in harsh conditions, which increases costs. Most exploration has been
in shallow water.
Dalton was unable to give details
of how many blocks would be offered
and in what basins, adding that geologists are carrying out a study to collect
geological information and analyse it
before offering comprehensive data
packages to potential bidders. “There
has been a downturn in exploration,
and we feel that we’ve got a lot of potential,” she said.
Alison Scott, deputy energy minister
for Nova Scotia, said the ministry would
offer attractive terms for companies
to develop their discoveries under its
newly revamped regulatory regime. She
told OGJ that potential explorers have
been reluctant to drill because they do
not know the geology. ✦

broad interest and appeal, and provide
significant benefits beyond existing
technologies.

Drilling technologies
Three awards went to drilling systems.
The closed-loop Impact Solutions
Secure Drilling System (SDS) analyzes
drilling data to detect kicks or losses
and automatically manage backpressure at the surface. SDS keeps circulating volumes as small as possible and
incorporates existing drilling and pressure control equipment with minimal
upgrades and equipment additions.
In its basic form, SDS lets the driller
see real-time changes in flow and pressures. It allows overbalanced, near-balanced, or underbalanced drilling, thus
enabling each section of the well to be
optimized based on downhole conditions.
Weatherford International’s OverDrive system enhances safety and efficiency of top-drive casing running and
drilling operations.
The primary component is the set
of TorkDrive heavy-duty and modular
tools used for making up and breaking
out casing, mounted directly to the rig’s
top drive. The TorkDrive tools combine
the functions of conventional power
tongs, bails, elevators, thread compensators, and fill-up circulation tools.
The OverDrive system can rotate
and push down casing while running
to help prevent differential sticking. It
offers high-speed string rotation with
the top drive when drilling or reamingwith-casing and lowers the number of
workers needed on the rig floor.
Halliburton’s HCB bulk cutting
storage tank, recognized for improved
wellsite safety and efficiency, simplifies
cuttings transfer and storage. The system
eliminates the need for cutting boxes,
which create safety risks and occupy
deck space. Halliburton says the HCB
tank system is easily installed and does
not need to be close to solids-control
equipment.
The HCB system can be coupled

30

with the air-operated SupaVac SV400
long-distance pumping and transfer
system, which can vacuum drill cuttings up to 165 ft and pump as much as
20 tons/hr of drill cuttings to a distance
of 490-650 ft. The HCB tank discharges
cuttings over long distances, up to 48
tons/hr horizontally and 30 tons/hr
vertically.

Perforating, fracturing

• RNX retrievable guide shoe.
• CatEXX hydraulic, top-down expansion system.
Vetco Gray said its fully automated
MR-6H SE marine drilling riser connection design combines field-proven
technology of the H-4 subsea wellhead
connector and the dog-style marine
riser (MR-).
To make the fully automated connection, hydraulic units on the spider engage a cam ring on the box that actuates
six dogs into the profile in the pin. The
pin is lowered into the box and guided
into place with an internal guide pin.
Then the spider does the rest, automatically making up the connection.
Fully automating the connection
takes people out of a potential hazard.
Vetco Gray says it takes less than 1 min
to make and break the MR-6H SE connection. A string of MR-6H SE can be
run in about half the time of a flanged
riser system.

The DYNAenergetic no-debris gun
(NDG) system uses an internal sliding
sleeve to close shot holes in the gun
after the shot, reducing fragments from
cases of the shaped charges.
DYNAenergetic says NDG testing
(made in accordance with the new API
RP 19b Section V standard) proved that
no debris can exit the gun during or
after the shot. The NDG can accommodate any standard shaped charge. Quality control shots with shaped charges
in a NDG setup have shown little or no
penetration loss.
The Baker Oil Tools Diamond FRAQ
is the first polymer-free high-performance fracturing fluid. The fluid is
the first viscoelastic (VES) fluid with
polymeric fracturing fluid performance
properties and formation and proppant
pack cleanup capability. The fluid uses
nanoparticle technology to associate
(pseudocrosslink) VES micelles, stabilize
VES micelle structures to 300° F., and
form a pseudo-filtercake composed of
highly viscous VES fluid (micelles) and
nanoparticles.
Internal breakers in Diamond FRAQ
work over a wide mix-water salinity
and temperature range to reduce viscosity and clean up VES fluid.

Aker Kvaerner’s SeaBooster is a subsea processing system for injecting seawater into a subsea completed injection
well. The system eliminates the need for
flowlines and a topsides water injection
pump. It can inject up to 151,000 b/d
with differential pressures up to 4,100
psi.
The system has a filtration module
for subsea solids removal prior to injection of water into the reservoir as well
as provisions for chemical injection to
prevent reservoir souring.
A Hayward Tyler freshwater and
glycol-filled electric motor drives the
SeaBooster.

Liners, risers

Milling, thread compounds

The Baker Oil Tools linEXX solid
expandable monobore liner extension
system optimizes casing configurations
for drilling deeper or isolating trouble
zones without reducing hole size. The
system consists of:
• RC9 series recess casing shoe.
• FORMlock expandable liner
hanger/packer.
• LinEXX solid expandable casing.

Aker Kvaerner’s PowerTrac Cone
Crusher scale mill assembly is run in
conjunction with the Aker Kvaerner’s
PowerTrac Advance (PTA) wireline
tractor. The PTA tractor wheel section can act as an anchoring device in
vertical sections and an anchoring and
forward thrust device in horizontal
wellbores.

four rotating cutting cones. Each cutting cone is free-rotating in its own
axis and is independent of the rotating speed of the main body. Each cone
also has a different cutting pattern that
crushes scale.
The ECF thread compounds developed by Jet-Lube comply with stringent
North Sea environmental guidelines for
offshore chemicals. The SEAL-GUARD
ECF for premium casing and tubing
connections and the NCS-30 ECF for
drillstring connections meet Norway’s
Yellow standards and the UK’s E classification.
Jet-Lube says these are the most
stringent thread compound requirements to date and required a total
reformulation of the pipe compounds
to meet both the performance and environmental requirements.
Both ECF compounds are nonmetallic and rated for 65-500º F. applications.

Computerized measurement
The FARO Technologies TrackArm
portable computerized measurement
device replaces hand tools and large,
expensive fixed-coordinate measuring
machines. The TrackArm combines two
technologies: the FAROArm and FARO
Laser Tracker to measure geometric features and directly import 3D measurements into digital form for CAD model
or part size verification.
The FAROArm uses optical encoders, advanced error coding, and

temperature compensation technology
to record 3D points on items ranging
from palm-sized to 12 ft. The FARO
Laser Tracker X uses laser targets and
Xtreme ADM technology to measure
items up to 230 ft.

Production platforms
Two technologies for production
platforms were recognized with Spotlight Awards.
The MODEC International MOSES
SSIP is a TLP with inherent stability that
allows quayside topsides integration
and commissioning to the hull structure and wet-towing of the integrated
platform. It eliminates the need for
temporary buoyancy or crane-assisted
installation.
The hull configuration has a central
base structure, four rectangular pontoon tendon support structures (TSS),
and four vertical columns. The TSS supports eight tendons via top connectors
on a porch arrangement. The tendons
connect to seabottom piles.
The SSIP TLP can support various
drilling or workover rigs and many
top-tension risers and flowline risers. It
accommodates both wet and dry trees.
Versabar’s deck-raising system used
32 synchronously controlled, 260-ton
hydraulic cylinders to lift the topsides
14 ft on two eight-leg platforms in the
Gulf of Mexico: Eugene Island 330C
and 330B.
Versabar says the lift pinned the
cylinders to lower padeyes welded to

the existing legs and upper padeyes
integral to the split extension sleeve.
It says the 40.5-in. diameter, 1.5-in.
wall extension sleeves captured the
legs during the final leg cuts and with
the rub rails limited lateral movement
during the raising to 0.25 in. The work
involved cutting the legs between two
bushings installed near the top of the
legs. Prior to the lift, the work required
welding the top of the extension sleeve
to the upper bushing. After rising, work
required welding the bottom of the
extension sleeve to the lower bushing.
Versabar says a 12-in. diameter,
1.75-in. wall pin inserted into the leg
provided a storm-safe condition at all
times except when removed to raise the
platforms.

LNG transfer
SBM’s LNG Toroidal Swivel allows
offshore LNG transfer through weathervaning turret-moored or single-pointmoored installations. SBM can configure the swivel to allow the passage of
multiple LNG streams up to 20 in. in
diameter and a 16-in. vapor return.
Composite material bearings and
thermal rods inside the toroid shield
the swivel seals from thermal deformations when cooled to the operating
–165° C. temperature and 10.5 bar
pressure.
SBM says the swivel has undergone
extensive tests that simulated 5 years of
continuous service and expects the process to receive ABS approval in 2007. ✦

belt operations, but has invited the
companies to stay as minority partners. They have until June 26 to negotiate the terms, including compensation and reduced stakes.
If Chavez persuades the foreign companies to stay, Venezuela will be on track
to develop the world’s largest known oil
reserves and possibly surpass Saudi Arabia as the nation with the most reserves,
say energy experts.
But if the multinationals decide to
leave, the Orinoco belt region could
end up starved of the investment and
know-how needed to transform the
Orinoco’s tar-like crude into marketable
oil. Chavez says government firms from
China, India, and elsewhere can step
in, but industry experts say they doubt
they are qualified to face technical challenges.

Petrobras in Venezuela
Some oil companies still need convincing that Venezuela will be a good
place to do business. Others believe

that Venezuela may still prove enticing
because three quarters of the world’s
proven reserves are already controlled
by state monopolies.
Brazil state-owned Petroleo Brasileiro
SA (Petrobras) says it is being pressured
to sign an exploration contract for the
giant Carabobo extra-heavy oil field in
the Orinoco belt without knowing how
much it will have to pay for the deal.
A company source told OGJ that it
had already allocated $1 billion to invest in this field. According to Petrobras,
to implement the accord, the Brazilian
company must pay a bonus whose value
has not been determined after a year of
negotiations.
Other sources say the Brazilian
company may abandon the project with
PDVSA to exploit Carabobo field. Under
the accord signed last January, PDVSA
will have a 60% stake in the Carabobo
project, and Petrobras a 40% stake. The
letter of intent also included the establishment of a joint capital company to

develop the Carabobo-1 field.
In exchange, Petrobras would have
a 60% stake in a planned 200,000 b/d
refinery to be built near Recife, capital
of Pernambuco state, in northeastern
Brazil. This refinery is slated to, in part,
refine oil from Carabobo. PDVSA would
have the other 40%. The refinery is
slated to be built by 2011.
Carabobo field has reserves of 5 billion bbl of oil, said PDVSA Pres. Rafael
Ramirez. The Venezuelan company and
foreign oil firms, among them Petrobras, are currently trying to make a
more precise estimate of the heavy oil
reserves in Carabobo and the Orinoco
basin. According to the Venezuelan government the Orinoco belt has estimated
reserves of 274 billion bbl.
Last January’s agreement also included the development of five oil fields in
Venezuela, with 40% percent participation by Petrobras and 60% by Venezuela
and the creation of a plant in Venezuela
for improving extra-heavy oil from the
Orinoco belt. ✦

Malaysian pipeline, reﬁnery complex in discussion stages
Eric Watkins
Senior Correspondent
A proposed refinery complex and
pipeline across northern Malaysia are
at the discussion stage, according to a
senior Malaysian official.
But reports suggest that the project,
which purportedly aims to safeguard
oil shipments against terrorism and
piracy in the Malacca Straits, may not
be needed. Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Abdul
Razak said the oil and gas pipeline
project between the country’s northern provinces of Kedah and Kelantan
remains at the proposal stage.
“There are proposals to have a
refinery and a pipeline that will take
it across. As far as I know, it is still at
a discussion stage. Nothing has been
finalized,” Najib said.

34

“It’s primarily for commercial
purposes because they think they can
transport the oil at a lower cost and
also avoid some of the risks relating to
heavy traffic at the Straits of Malacca,”
Najib said.
Apart from the 320-km pipeline,
plans call for a 200,000 b/d coastal
refinery to be constructed by a joint
venture of local firm SKS Development
Sdn. Bhd. and National Iranian Oil Co.
(NIOC).
On Apr. 11, regional government
officials said construction was due to
begin by August on a refinery and the
oil pipeline across northern Malaysia, offering companies the chance
to avoid the increasingly congested
Malacca Straits.
They said oil could be offloaded on
peninsular Malaysia’s west coast, piped
across the country’s northern regions,
and then reloaded onto tankers for

onward passage to Far Eastern markets,
Japan and China in particular.
The Malaysian officials said about
70% of the $14.5 billion cost would
be foreign investment, with a large
proportion coming from NIOC and
unnamed Saudi and Chinese investors.
Analysts reportedly believe the pipeline project is politically motivated, as
it would enable shippers and purchasers to avoid Singapore, a US ally,
if relations between the US and Iran
deteriorate further.

Piracy down
Adm. Timothy Keating, the top US
commander in the Pacific, said Apr. 16
that countries along the Malacca Strait
have vastly improved security in the
strategic shipping route over the last 5
years.

by Singapore’s Nanyang Technological
University said piracy and armed robbery attacks against ships in Southeast
Asia have been reduced greatly, and the
overall number of attacks in the region
is on a downward trend.
The number of incidents for the
first quarter is the lowest in the past 5
years. There were 12 armed robbery
and piracy incidents reported in the
first quarter, 10 of which were actual
attacks and two attempted raids.
The report said more than half of
the attacks during the period were
carried out against tankers, and most
took place within Indonesian waters,
including the vicinity of the Balongan
oil export terminal east of Jakarta.
“The Indonesian ports and anchorages remained the regional hotspots
for armed robbery and piracy activities,” the Nanyang report said. ✦

API: US drilling at
21-year high in 1Q
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
US oil and gas drilling reached a
21-year peak during 2007’s first 3
months and was nearly twice the level
of first-quarter drilling activity during
the 1990s, the American Petroleum
Institute said on Apr. 26.
An estimated 11,771 oil wells,
natural gas wells, and dry holes were
completed during the period, 1% more
than the total for 2006’s first quarter,
API said in its latest quarterly well
completion report.
It said gas remained the primary US
drilling target, with an estimated 7,085
completions, a first-quarter record. But
an oil drilling resurgence that began
in 2000 continued with an estimated
3,674 completions. That was second
only to 2006’s initial 3 months, when
estimated oil drilling was at 1988 levels, API said.

Trouble
in Nigeria

T

he ink was barely dry on a report
by the International Maritime
Bureau about pirate attacks on oil
ships and installations around the
globe when some bad guys decided
to put the findings in neon lights
with an attack on a Chevron Corp.
floating production, storage, and
offloading vessel off Nigeria.
The May 1 attack on Chevron’s
Oloibiri FPSO off Bayelsa state resulted in the death of one Nigerian sailor
and the kidnapping of six foreign oil
workers by members of Movement
for the Emancipation of the Niger
Delta (MEND).
This is not the first time for MEND
to make its appearance in these columns. Last year, it was reported that
the militant group had announced a
mobilization of its fighters to counter
a new military offensive by the Nigerian government (OGJ, Oct. 9, 2006,
p. 30).

MEND’s pledge
“In good time we will redeem
our pledge to the people of the Niger
Delta to halt altogether the rape of
our land by the Nigerian government and conniving oil companies,” MEND said. Their script hasn’t
changed much since then.
This time around, MEND—which
made no apology for the death of the
sailor—said its attack on Chevron’s
facilities should also be interpreted as
a warning to Royal Dutch Shell PLC,
which has recently returned to fields
in Bayelsa and Delta states after earlier
attacks by the militant group.
In a word, the fight will continue
between the rebels and the government over control of Nigeria’s oil
revenues—with hapless international

companies caught in the middle and
paying the price in human terms as
well as in oil dollars.
That’s pretty much in keeping
with the IMB report on piracy that
found the number of attacks in Nigeria has doubled when compared with
the first quarter of 2006.

Attacks increasing
“The six attacks reported for the
first quarter of 2007 included a
number of violent attacks against vessels and crew working in offshore oil
installations,” the report said.
“In these cases,” it said, “crew
members were both assaulted and abducted.” The report went on to note
that attacks on other vessels were also
reported in the Niger Delta region,
concluding that “an alarming total of
40 crew members were taken hostage
or kidnapped in Nigeria alone.”
It is not as though things can’t
change since the reported incidents
of piracy dropped significantly
in Southeast Asia, with Indonesia
recording nine incidents, down dramatically from 19 last year.
Especially impressive is the fact
that just two incidents were recorded
in the Malacca Straits, which according to the IMB, “now represents an
excellent example of how cooperation between authorities can tackle
and suppress piracy attacks.”
The improvement in Southeast
Asia followed considerable international pressure on the governments
of countries along the Malacca Straits.
If international pressure can contain
piracy in those infested waters, then
the same pressure needs to be applied
to Nigeria. ✦

Onshore ﬁelds bolstered 2006 US gas output
Alan Petzet
Chief Editor-Exploration
Land drilling bolstered US gas production in 2006, a warmer than normal
year characterized by lower imports
from Canada, reduced LNG imports
from fewer countries, and above average storage levels, said the US Energy
Information Administration.
All data are preliminary, EIA said,
but total marketed gas production
climbed 2% on the year to 19.34 tcf
in 2006 even though 2005-06 Gulf of
Mexico output fell due to hurricanes.
Gulf production, usually more than
20% of annual marketed US gas output,
dropped 21% in 2005 and 13% through
October 2006 to 15% of cumulative
marketed production.
Marketed production outside the
gulf as of October 2006 was 13.68 tcf,
more than 4% higher than the 2005 level. Many producing states recorded gas

Estimated exploratory completions,
accounting for just under 6% of the firstquarter’s total, fell 21% year-to-year as
developmental completions rose 3%.
The report did not surprise domestic
drilling observers. “It’s consistent with
the Baker Hughes rig count, which is at
its highest level since 1986,” said Mark
S. Urness of Calyon Securities in New
York. “The difference is that today, we
have a much larger percentage—roughly
86%—drilling for gas.”
Relatively higher prices are causing
more oil wells to be drilled, he said. “For
natural gas, some of the growth reflects
concern over relying heavily on Canadian
imports as their internal demand grows,”
Urness told OGJ. Large, publicly traded
drilling contractors are not drilling as
many US wells, but privately owned
firms, often with five or fewer rigs, have
increased their activity, he said.

“Much of the cleanup we’re doing
now is from wells drilled in the 1920s

are walking away from leases without

said.

Reclamation bonds
But Peggy Utesch, a Colorado landowner testifying on behalf of the Western Organization of Resource Councils
and Western Colorado Congress, said
higher reclamation bonds are needed.
In 2004, she said, BLM and the Wyoming government estimated it would
cost $4 million to reclaim 120 wellsites
that Emerald Restoration & Production abandoned 3 years earlier under
a $125,000 blanket bond. The state’s
conservation fund contributed $2.6
million, “but the balance will be paid
by taxpayers or the cleanup will not
happen,” she said.
Claire M. Moseley, executive director of Public Lands Advocacy in Denver,
said the bonds’ purpose is to make the
operator aware of its reclamation responsibility, not cover the entire cost which
can run into hundreds of thousands of
dollars in some cases. “The small operators would be the ones most affected by
increased bonding costs. They would be
the ones who wouldn’t drill wells as a
result,” she said.
Utesch responded: “There are two
ways to look at small producers and
what they do. I have seen instances
where they have chosen to walk away
from a $25,000 bond instead of paying
$100,000 for proper reclamation.” ✦

Confronting
split estates

C

ould 2007 be the year that US
Congress addresses the split estates question? The idea that another
entity—often the federal government—could hold subsurface rights
to an individual’s property is incomprehensible in most of the US. It’s a
part of life in the West, however, and
it can lead to conflicts.
It’s remarkable that it hasn’t done
so more often. Energy and mineral
lessees say it’s because they’ve learned
to operate with minimal disruptions
to surface activities. Some surface
land owners respond that they have
no choice but to cooperate, and that
they are tired of it.
The conflict quickly surfaced (for
lack of a better term) as two House
Natural Resources Committee subcommittees held a hearing on Apr.
26 about land use issues created by
onshore oil and gas resource development.
Rep. Mark Udall (D-Colo.), a
member of one of the subcommittees who introduced a bill addressing
split estates and other Western land
issues in February, asked Henri Bisson,
deputy director for operations at the
US Bureau of Land Management, how
much advance notice surface land
owners receive of subsurface leasing.
“The first place where leasing decisions are made is in development of
the land use plans. We have instructed
our field offices to advertise this extensively,” Bisson replied.

Negotiated agreements
“We have about 19,500 wells
currently on split estates. Of these,
the operators have moved about 20
to the bonding process. The others
have negotiated agreements with the
38

surface land holders,” Bisson said.
Rancher Steve Adami of Sheridan,
Wyo., said he is intimately acquainted
with 12 of those 20 wells. When he
learned that several of his neighbors
had reached agreements with producers, he asked them what they had
learned. Then he tried to obtain conditions when a producer told him that
he held subsurface leases on his land.
“When we asked for some
changes in the language ensuring
proper reclamation, restrictions on
water disposal, and $1.37/day more
money than was being offered...what
we received was nothing. The initial
offer was withdrawn and the operator ‘bonded on,’” Adami said at the
hearing.

Grazing value
Although they invited him to the
meetings, the operator and BLM then
made the development decisions,
Adami said. “The BLM’s response to
my protest that they allowed industry to post a $2,176 bond against a
reasonable reclamation estimate of $3
million or more was that they were
only required to collect a bond for
loss of grazing value.”
In most other instances, energy
producers and surface land owners
have good relationships, maintained
Claire M. Moseley of the Public Lands
Advocacy in Denver.
“BLM has done a good job of
soliciting feedback from land owners
and industry alike to determine how
best to address the split estate issue,”
Moseley said. When the federal agency held nine public meetings on the
issue, it found that very few actual
conflicts exist and the current process
is working well, she said. ✦

Interior proposes
21 OCS lease sales
in 5-year plan
NUS Interior Sec. Dirk Kempthorne announced a preliminary final 5-year Outer
Continental Shelf leasing plan on Apr. 30
that DOI says could produce 10 million
bbl of oil, 45 tcf of gas, and $170 billion
in revenues if fully implemented.
The plan was submitted to Congress.
If it does not act within 60 days, Kempthorne said, he is authorized to make it
final.
The plan proposes 21 lease sales in 8
of the 26 OCS planning areas in the Gulf
of Mexico, Alaska, and Virginia, which
Kempthorne said was added at the request of the state’s leaders.
The proposed lease sale off southeastern
Virginia in 2011 includes a 50-mile buffer
added at the state’s request. It also includes
an exclusion at the mouth of Chesapeake
Bay to prevent interference with military
activity and commercial shipping.
DOI emphasized that no federal oil
and gas leasing would occur off Virginia
unless a presidential withdrawal and
congressional moratorium are lifted.
US Minerals Management Service
said while there will be no leasing off
Virginia immediately, companies can
shoot seismic surveys while the area is
still under moratorium.
“The estimates are pretty solid in the
Gulf of Mexico because there’s been a
lot of activity there,” said MMS Director Johnny Burton. “They are much less
so because there’s been no leasing for
more than 20 years. That’s also the case
to some extent in Alaska. The data could
improve if drilling takes place.”
Kempthorne said the preliminary
5-year plan includes two other areas
previously not available, the North
Aleutian Basin planning area off Alaska
and the Sale 181 South area of the Gulf
of Mexico.
The proposed 5-year leasing program
runs from July 1, 2007, through June
30, 2012. ✦

Hazard type
A peril is an event that causes damage, while a hazard is an event that can
lead to, or intensify, a peril.
Some perils adhere to the magnitude-frequency rule, which specifies
that over a sufficient time small catastrophes will recur frequently and large
ones periodically. The frequency-severity rule specifies that the larger the
event, the more severe the damage and
losses.4 In some cases, the severity of a
disaster is independent of the magnitude of the disaster; i.e., a large magnitude event can cause little damage. All
perils are not necessarily insurable, but
they represent the main types of hazard
to which offshore facilities are exposed.

Anchor/jacking/trawl
Anchors are used to hold drilling
rigs, floating production units, and
various other vessels at station when
operations are in process or when heavy
weather advances.
Temporary units such as semisubmersibles are typically anchored to the
ocean floor through mooring lines,
which are designed for low-return
storms and may break away during hurricanes. Permanent units such as floating production systems are typically
designed for high category storms. Rigs
that lose station during severe weather
and drag their anchors may damage
pipelines.

be released in and around the platform,
creating significant potential for loss or
damage to the facility by fire, explosion, or cratering. Surface blowouts have
received the most attention over the
last half-century (Kuwait, Piper Alpha,
Ixtoc, Santa Barbara), but underground
blowouts are actually more common.
Blowouts occur primarily during
exploratory drilling, although there
is also risk of a blowout during production, since maintenance activities
require reentering wells for workover,
sidetracking, or deepening. The first exploration well in an area will be drilled
very carefully because the geologic
formations are untested and the risk of
overpressure may result in a blowout.
After a few wells are drilled, the stratigraphic layers where overpressures can
be expected are known, and drilling can
proceed faster and safer.

The potential for loss or damage will
depend upon the speed at which the
vessel is traveling, its size, and the nature of its cargo.
The impact between a vessel and a
platform may result in structural failure
and the failure of wellhead or pipeline risers. A collision between an LNG
carrier and a platform, or an oil tanker
and a LNG regasification facility, could
have devastating consequences if fire
or explosion result. Grounded ships
frequently spill the material they are
transporting.
In the Gulf of Mexico and North Sea,
several incidents in recent years have
occurred during severe weather where
drilling rigs and FPSOs have broken
adrift from their mooring in high density infrastructure regions, contributing
to the failure of pipelines.

Capsize/collapse

Corrosion refers to the deterioration of a solid body through interaction
with its environment.
Steel units in a saltwater environment are especially susceptible to corrosion and are normally evaluated in
terms of three zones: the splash zone,
the submerged zone, and the atmospheric zone.
The “splash zone” is that portion of
the structure which, due to the action
of tides, seas, and winds, is intermittently wetted by seawater. The “submerged zone” refers to that portion of
the structure that extends downward
from the splash zone, including surfaces below the mud line. The “atmospheric zone” extends upward from the
splash zone and is exposed, to varying
degrees, to salt spray, sun, dew, and
chemical spillage.
Each of the three zones of a platform
is exposed to a different corrosive environment, which varies with structure
and site-specific factors.

Rigs, platforms, and floating production systems may capsize during heavy
weather.
Failure of primary structural components such as main braces, jacket legs,
deck legs, and piles often lead units to
list or capsize.
Loadings caused by wave inundation of the deck are usually the primary cause of damage to the integrity
of a structure. Inundation of the deck
increases the horizontal load and
overturning moment, resulting in the

from coastal and onshore engineering
experience.
Structural engineers followed deterministic construction practices and dealt
with uncertainty not by quantifying it
but by incorporating explicit factors of
safety in design procedures.4-6 Safety
factors/design margins are intended to
account for a wide range of unknowns,
including construction loads and stresses, changes in loading assumptions, and
uncertainties in environmental loads.7
Probabilistic methods began to be
applied in the late 1960s, and in the
1970s hazard analysis was applied for
critical industrial installations such as
nuclear facilities, petrochemical plants,
and liquefied natural gas plants.8 Movement of offshore construction into
deeper waters of the Gulf of Mexico
and other frontier areas led to increasingly severe environmental loadings and
more complex design requirements. The
latest edition of the API Recommended
Practice 2A uses consequence-based
design.
In the US, operators design their
structures to satisfy API RP 2A guidelines and federal regulations. The Minerals Management Service (MMS), the
federal agency responsible for regulating the offshore industry, will generally accept the risk of losing a structure
where there is no threat to life or the
environment.
Owners may be willing to accept the
risk on less important structures (such
as caissons and well protectors), but
monetary considerations usually dictate
increased capacity for structures with a
high production rate, facilities that serve
as a transportation or processing hub,
and deepwater structures.
From an economic perspective, for a
given probability of an extreme weather
event, the investment required to avoid
damage must exceed some fraction of
the cost to repair the damage. A tradeoff exists that attempts to balance the
potential costs of damage and disruption due to a catastrophic weather event
against the benefits of a more robust
(but expensive) design.

L O P M E N T

Earthquakes and tsunamis
Earthquakes represent a peril to any
structure fixed to the seabed in proximity to a fault line or active tectonic
region.
Earthquakes impose severe dynamic
loadings, and since the timing of their
occurrence cannot be predicted (unlike hurricanes or severe storms, for
example), evacuation of personnel
is impractical. Safety considerations
thus require critical attention, since a
structure might collapse and lead to a
blowout, or shock forces may create
electrical disturbances in equipment
leading to fire or explosion.
The offshore regions of the world
most affected by earthquake are those
in the Pacific Basin, and include the
active offshore producing regions of
California, Chile, Malaysia, Indonesia,
and New Zealand.
Tsunamis (tidal waves) are caused
by the energy released as a result of
an undersea earthquake. The effect of
a tsunami depends on several factors.
In shallow water, depending on the
height of the swell, a tsunami could be
devastating if the platform is not built
sufficiently above the mean sea level.
In deep water, the effect of a tsunami
is expected to be less severe because
platforms are built higher to avoid wave
forces.
In all recorded incidents to date, the
impact of tsunamis on offshore infrastructure has been negligible.

Fire/lightning/explosion
Hydrocarbons are processed at high
temperature and pressure and create an
ever-present danger of fire and explosion.
The type of fire and heat flux will
depend on the fuel being released, its
state, and in the case of liquids, conditions such as pressure and velocity.
The size of the fire will depend on
the release rate and ventilation conditions, inventory, and surroundings, and
the degree to which a fire will spread
depends upon the effectiveness of the
safety apparatus.
Regulatory authorities have strict

fire prevention rules, and platforms are
equipped with leak detection systems,
sensors, fire-fighting equipment, and
emergency shutdown systems. Fire prevention is a top priority, and offshore
operators regularly practice fire and
evacuation exercises.
In harsh climate areas such as the
North Sea, topside facilities are usually
totally enclosed, which may allow gas
from a leak to accumulate in a confined
location leading to a vapor cloud explosion.

Heavy weather
The predominant patterns of ocean
winds are their circulation around the
permanent high-pressure areas that
cover the ocean, clockwise in the northern hemisphere, counterclockwise in
the southern hemisphere.
When energy flows become concentrated and are released, forces are
created that disrupt physical conditions,
geography, and weather. The violent
storms are known as tropical cyclones
in the Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea, and
off Australia; as hurricanes in the Atlantic and South Pacific; and as typhoons in
the western Pacific.9
In harsh environments such as the
North Sea, severe storms with high
winds and rough seas occur throughout
the year with wave heights reaching

Stuck drillstem
A well penetrates many different
types of rock formations until total
depth is achieved, and as the well continues deeper into the earth, the operating environment becomes more hostile
(temperatures and pressures increase,
rock formation becomes harder, etc.)
and drilling becomes more difficult.
A stuck drillstem occurs when the
drillstring is stuck in the hole, usually
by “doglegs” or an inappropriate mud
program, and cannot be removed. Stuck
pipe is one of several categories of drilling problems that include sloughing
shale, lost circulation, formation damage, and embrittlement.

Subsidence and landslide
Subsidence is a common phenomenon in the oil and gas fields of the
Louisiana coastal plain, but it has been
encountered on relatively few offshore
fields, with the most notable exception
being Ekofisk field in the North Sea.
As a hydrocarbon reservoir is depleted, the seabed may drop, creating a
gap between the sea level and the lower
portions of the structure. The structure
subsequently becomes more susceptible
to damage by extreme wave heights and
may develop foundation weakness.
An underwater landslide (mud slide)
refers to the downward movement of
seafloor material en masse. Mud slides can
result in damage to structures that are embedded in or in the path of the mudslide,
and pose a serious threat to pipelines,
flowlines, and structures where soils are
soft and sediment unstable.
Only a few continental margins
around the world possess the right
combination of high sedimentation
rates, unconsolidated soils, shelf configuration, and frequent storms/earthquakes for mud slides to be prevalent.

production year. Peak year estimates
have ranged from ~2004 to ~2040.1-7

Saudi Arabia increased its reserves estimate from

purely political.14 Between 1990 and present, the
country has produced ~50 billion bbl of oil.
Al-Husseini’s estimate of 130 billion bbl of oil is therefore considered more realistic. The 130 billion bbl of oil

• Hubbert’s bell curve requires essentially two assumptions.8 The first is
that production at all times is at a maximum rate. This condition requires that
there is sufficient demand for oil and
no political interference, amongst others. The second assumption is that the
estimate of ultimate recoverable reserves
is accurate.
Such events as the two oil crises in
the 1970s, the collapse of the Soviet
Union, and production capacity exceeding demand in the 1990s have shown
that the first assumption is invalid.

(RoW) that calculates the ultimate recoverable reserves of oil rather than the
model requiring this information.6 7

The new model for forecasting
worldwide conventional oil production
requires historic oil production data
(HPD(x)) and an estimate of ultimate
recoverable reserves.
The model generates an ideal bell
curve (IBC(x)) from Equation 1 (equation box) using data prior to anomalies
in production. The curve has the total
area equal to the ultimate recoverable
reserves. The model considers crude
plus NGL production.
In the equation, yp is the production
at the peak year, R is a slope constant, x
is the year, and xp is the peak year.
The xai-1 is the year the i-th anomaly
occurred. Production after the anomalies is then modeled with m smalldegree polynomials SPi(x) (degree 1
or 2, 1≤i≤m) fitted to the data until
the model reaches the last historically
known production point, HPD(xc). The
xc is the last year of historically known
production and let xam = xc.
The model then locates the unique
point IBC(xq) on the ideal bell curve,
where the amount of oil produced
according to the ideal bell curve is the

same as the amount of oil produced to
the year xc.
In the next step, the model fits a
high-degree polynomial to the most recent production data (P(x)) and solves
Equations 2-6.
In the equations, p(x) is an n-th
degree polynomial, where n is chosen.
There are n + 1 variables in the polynomial and the extra variables x1 and x2. In
essence, the polynomial p(x) assumes
that current trends will continue, until
reaching x1. At x1, the trend reaches the
ideal bell curve shifted by x1–x2 so that
the produced oil estimate from the ideal
bell curve equals the estimate from the
n-th degree polynomial.
Equation 7 defines the model M(x).
The model requires the availability of
a good estimate of ultimate recoverable
reserves and that current trends continue until production reaches the ideal
bell curve.
Two bell curves randomly generated and added together indicate the
accuracy of the model. The test requires

selecting a random year xc between the
2 peak years and truncating the data at
the random year. The model uses only
production data up to year xc (HPD(x))
and ultimate recoverable reserves as
inputs to estimate future production
FPD(x).
The model then calculates correlation factor r2 (Equation 3) for future
data points (FPD(x)).9 Fig. 1 indicates
the model’s accuracy.
In general, accuracy improves as the
percentage of the second bell curve
increases. A comparison of height
at the last known date to height of
the second-bell-curve peak gives the
second-bell-curve percentage. If the
second-bell-curve percentage is less
than 5%, the model’s error increases
significantly.
Fig. 2a shows the graph of the outlier
with an r2 value of –1.6. The outlier
occurs because the model failed to solve
Equations 2-6 for n = 2, 3, and 4 and
defaulted to the original ideal bell-curve

estimate, which models the data accurately to 1960 and fails thereafter.
Fig. 2b shows a similar data set in
which the model could solve Equations
2-6 for n = 4.
The model is incapable of accurately
modeling the data if historic production
data stops before 1% of the second-bellcurve production occurs.
Fig. 2c shows the curve with lowest
r2 value (r2 = 0.68) that excludes the
outlier (r2 = –1.6) and historic production data with <1% of the second-bellcurve production. As expected, the data
have the smallest percentage greater
than 1% from the second bell curve.
Fig. 2d depicts a graph of an accurate
model (r2 = 0.97). In the figure, 60%
of the second bell curve is contained in
the HPD(x).
The testing indicates that the model
is robust (average r2 = 0.96) and capable of accurately modeling future data
if historic production data from the
second bell curve is greater than 1%.
The average r2 calculation excludes data

before drilling commenced to review
shallow gas and system operating
procedures to ensure full understanding of specific roles and responsibilities,

ing commenced during fourth-quarter
2005, with a target completion of late
January 2006. Although the timing was
tight, AGR Subsea met the schedule, and
factory acceptance testing commenced
early February 2006 in Bergen.
A key aspect of the acceptance test
was to run the pump continuously for
a 48-hr endurance run while recording flow rates and motor performance
throughout. The motor was submerged
in water for the test to dissipate the heat
it generated. Power supply and data
acquisition were managed through the
control cabin. The pump and motor
had to meet a predetermined range of
parameters to confirm acceptance.
The complete program lasted 1
week. The equipment was then prepared for shipment to Busan, where
the drilling rig was to be released back
to Elvary Neftegaz having worked for
another operator during the winter of
2005-06.

After the start-up problems were
resolved, the system worked faultlessly
and the section drilled at an average
rate of 18 m/hr with a maximum of
40 m/hr and flow rates of 900-1,050
gpm. Because the section was sandier
than expected, it took longer to mud up
with native clays. The 171⁄2-in. section
was drilled to 1,000 m TVD, a total of
763 m in 41 hr.
Notwithstanding the 31⁄2 hr lost due
to the generator cutout and return hose
blockage, the section was drilled in a
half day less than originally planned, to
which must be added the 4 days saved
through elimination of drilling and
abandonment of the pilot hole. Credit
was given to the system for improved
hole cleaning and reduced waste at
surface. Improved hole condition contributed to the reduced casing running
time.
The ROV disconnected the suction
hose and power umbilical, and the suction module was recovered before the
133⁄8-in. casing was run. The running
tool was installed in the bottomhole
assembly while pulling out of hole and
the suction module was easily recovered. The ROV then connected the suction hose to the permanent guide base
manifold outlet so that mud returns
could be taken back to the rig while
running casing. It also enabled the casing to be washed down without mud
loss should this have been required.
The pump and return hose were
recovered after cementing the 133⁄8in. casing, while the BOP stack was
being run. By this time, the current
had strengthened to 2-3 knots, and the
return hose had wrapped itself around
the winch umbilical. This complication
did not seriously affect recovery nor
was any damage to the hose visible.

Savitskaya-1
Although the currents were stronger at this location, the operation went
smoothly. The crew ran the pump while
waiting for cement and landed on the
seabed without incident, although the
current ranged from 2 knots at surface
to 1.5 knots at the seabed.

After drilling and cleaning out the
30-in. conductor, the crew attempted to
engage the suction module. After several
failures, the rig had to be winched over
8 m before the suction module could
be placed over the 30-in. wellhead
housing. The current was sufficiently
strong to create difficulties for the ROV
when making up the suction hose and
umbilical jumper cable but this was
achieved while the rig crew made up
the drilling assembly.
The 171⁄2-in. hole section commenced without incident and progressed down to 479 m, where mud
returns were lost. ROV inspection of the
hose showed that it had been caught
around the pump frame and kinked.
Several attempts to release the hose
failed due to the strong currents. The
current at the time was 1.8 knots and
had changed direction by 180º in a
short period. After a wait of 71⁄2 hr for
slack water, the hose was cleared and
operations recommenced.
Drilling continued from 479 m
until reaching section TD at 967 m.
Performance in this section exceeded
expectations, and it was completed in
17 hr at an average ROP of 28 m/hr.
The total interval took 33 hr including
the time lost due to the kinked hose.
The improvement in hole condition and
penetration rate was attributed to use
of a 1.12-sp gr bentonite mud system.
Hole conditions at casing point were
sufficiently good to eliminate a wiper
trip before running the 133⁄8-in. casing.
This saved a further half day over past
performance.
The crew recovered the suction module without difficulty before running
casing. Although the current did not
abate, the ROV successfully disconnected the suction hose and jumper cable
from the suction module in just 45
min. The suction hose was transferred
to the permanent guide base to capture
mud returns. The pump and return hose
were recovered without problems during the running of the BOP and marine
riser.

Lessons learned, plan
Table 1 compares the performance
achieved in the 2006 wells with operations in 2004 and 2005. The overall
saving of about 9 days/well from the
average of the 2004-05 wells results
from:
• Eliminating a pilot hole and attendant abandonment problems.
• Avoiding running and recovering
the riser and hydraulic latch connector.
• Improved performance resulting
from drilling a single 171⁄2-in. section as
opposed to a 26-in. hole in two passes.
If a full sized 26-in. hole were
to be drilled in future, without any
improvement in drilling performance
and allowing 51⁄2 days to drill a 750-m
interval, the time savings with the riserless mud-recovery system would still be
7 days over the alternative method.
Nevertheless, there are some problems still to address and operational
performance can be further improved.
Wash-up sessions were conducted by
teleconference after each hole section
to ensure that lessons were captured
and would be employed in the 2007
drilling campaign. Most were procedural and, with only one exception,
called for no changes to the equipment.
The single modification was the idea
to incorporate a bend restrictor in the
flexible return hose to prevent the kinking that was encountered in the strong
currents. This component had been
manufactured but failed to reach the
rig in time to be retrofitted before the
pump was deployed in 2006.
There remain further trials to prove
that the system can handle the full
range of well-design options employed
off Sakhalin. The two wells drilled in
2006 had a slimmed-down design,
with the 20-in. surface casing replaced
by 133⁄8-in. casing. One of the wells
planned for 2007 has a conventional
design (20-in. casing), requiring the
system to handle the significantly larger
volumes of mud and cuttings generated
in 26-in. hole. The aim is to attempt the
section in a single pass with a 26-in. bit.
The second goal is the ability to
operate safely in the presence of shal-

low gas. The most significant safety
benefit of the system, during drilling in
shallow gas-prone areas, is the ability
to select a mud weight, build volume
to the required properties, and then to
exploit all the advantages of a closed
circulation system (control mud weight
and properties while maintaining the
well open to the sea). Keeping the well
open to the sea provides a true dualgradient subsea mudlift capability and
creates the overbalance conditions that
almost entirely eliminate the conditions
required for an influx.1
The precise drilling procedures for
these conditions have still to be worked
through, specifically regarding the size
of hole to be drilled. On one hand,
simulations show that the larger annulus provides a longer warning time
of an impending kick. On the other
hand, if it is required to perform an
accurate evaluation of the surface hole
with logging-while-drilling tools, then
a pilot hole must be drilled. The balance
between these two considerations still
has to be evaluated, and the risks associated with the alternative procedure
(simultaneous drilling and underreaming) assessed.
From a theoretical perspective, the
risk-reduction studies carried out by
Norway’s SINTEF indicated that there is
only minimal likelihood of gas entering
the system during a kick and that pump
power consumption is a much more
sensitive detection indicator than the
conventional pit-gain method.
In practice, pit-gain measurement
is unavailable during conventional
surface-hole drilling in which returns
are taken to seabed. Under these conditions, shallow gas kicks are normally
only detected when they reach the
wellhead and are observed by the ROV.
Therefore, the advanced warning provided by the pump power demand provides rig crews with valuable additional
response time.

with difficult operating conditions that
exist offshore Sakhalin was not taken
lightly. The results of the 2006 season
demonstrated that:
1. The riserless mud-recovery system
delivered its anticipated safety and environmental benefits while improving
operational efficiency by 9 days/well
without the use of a marine riser.
2. Novel systems can be imported
and their designs verified and permitted for use in the Russian Federation as
long as adequate time is allowed for the
process.
3. A thorough project risk assessment followed by detailed technical
risk-reduction studies guided systems
design and allowed development of
operational procedures.
4. A rigorous process of hazard and
operability reviews involving all participants in the operation enabled the
system to be installed, commissioned,
and operated on the rig in a troublefree manner.
5. Operational experience highlighted the benefits of running a quality
mud in the system and showed that
further refinement of procedures and
installation of a bend restrictor in the
return hose are required.

7. The RMR system offers the prospect of a significant reduction of risk
during drilling in shallow gas prone
areas, although the detailed procedures
must still be developed.

used only 290,000 b/d vs. 348,000

seasonal pattern in November and
December. Feedstock demand increased
to 324,000 b/d in November and
341,000 b/d in December.
Propane’s share of fresh feed averaged 18% in October and then increased to 19.8% in November and
20.4% in December. For fourth-quarter
2006, propane accounted for about
19% of fresh feed. During 2000-04,
propane’s share of fresh feed during the
fourth quarter averaged 16-17%.
Feedstock demand for propane
jumped to 402,000 b/d in January
2007 (consistent with typical seasonal
patterns) but declined to 328,000 b/d
in February. Based on a rebound in
ethylene plant operating rates, Petral estimates that feedstock demand averaged
350,000-360,000 b/d in March.
Propane’s share of fresh feed jumped
to 23.4% in January 2007 but declined
to 20.2% in February. Historically,
propane’s share of fresh feed during
the first quarter averaged 18-20% during 2002-04. The industry’s historical
proven minimum propane demand
was 190,000 b/d (December 1996),
or only 12% of fresh feed. In today’s
market, 12% of fresh feed would be
200,000-210,000 b/d.
Petral estimates that the ethylene industry, operating at minimum propane
consumption during a normally cold
winter, could have reduced feedstock
demand by 25 million bbl vs. actual
demand.
Table 1 summarizes trends in ethylene feedstock demand for propane.
Ethylene plants will operate at 9293% of capacity rates during second
and third-quarter 2007. Total feedstock
demand will average 1.73-1.75 million
b/d, and propane consumption in the
ethylene feedstock market will average
350,000-370,000 b/d.

Canada will face significant obstacles
in meeting demand during a truly cold
winter. Inventories in primary storage
will almost certainly be fully depleted
before the end of February in a winter
with average heating degree-days.
Our estimates of retail propane
sales are based on heating degree-days
from the US National Weather Service’s
Climate Prediction Center. We also estimated retail sales for winter 2006-07

annually by the American Petroleum
Institute.

Gas plants

EIA statistics show that gas plant
propane production averaged 504,000
b/d for fourth-quarter 2006. Propane
production was at its high in November 2006 and averaged 513,000 b/d.
Production in December 2006 averaged
only 499,000 b/d, or 20,000-30,000
b/d lower than typical full-recovery
volumes before 2005.

Hence the trend in net refinery propane

EIA also reported that net refinery propane production increased to

to full capacity after the 2005 hurricane
season. The increase in net refinery
propane production in January was
somewhat surprising in view of decline
in refinery operating rates.
Petral expects propane supply from
refineries to average 325,000-335,000
b/d in first-quarter 2007 and to
increase to 335,000-345,000 b/d in
second-quarter 2007. Fig. 3 illustrates
trends in total propane production (gas
plants and refineries).

Imports
Based on data from the US Census
Bureau’s Foreign Trade Division, propane imports from Canada increased in
fourth-quarter 2006, consistent with
the seasonal pattern. Imports from
Canada averaged only 162,000 b/d in
fourth-quarter 2006, however, or about
8,000 b/d lower than year earlier volumes and about 10,000 b/d below the
average for 2000-05.
Consistent with the seasonal increase in retail propane sales, propane imports
from Canada typically increase to peak seasonal volumes of 150,000-175,000 b/d
during the fourth quarter and
175,000-200,000 b/d during
the ﬁrst quarter. Additionally,
propane imports from outside
North America usually decline
sharply during the fourth
quarter. Imports from international sources typically remain
at seasonally minimum levels
during the ﬁrst quarter.

and marketers responded to the surge
in space heating demand during firstquarter 2007.

end of March 2003 from a seasonal
peak of 71 million bbl at the end of
September 2002.
This year, total heating degree-days
for the winter were again 5-8% below
average. The combination of strong
feedstock demand during November
through January, however, and very
strong retail demand during February
resulted in a cumulative withdrawal
of about 48.5-49.0 million bbl, based
on EIA’s weekly inventory reports.
Inventory in primary storage in the US
declined to a minimum of 23.0-23.5
million bbl.
At the beginning of the heating season, purity propane in primary inventory in Canada totaled 11.5 million bbl
at the end of August, or about 3 million
bbl more than year earlier volumes.
Based on statistics from the National
Energy Board, Canadian companies
withdrew 10 million bbl of propane
from primary storage during the winter
heating season and pulled inventories to
a seasonal low of 700,000-800,000 bbl
at the end of March.
Fig. 4 illustrates trends in propane
inventory.
In a truly cold winter, retail propane
demand will be 20-30 million bbl
higher than winter 2006-07. Unless
inventories are significantly higher than
72 million bbl, the market will pull inventories to record low levels. Furthermore, markets will require feedstock
demand for propane to fall to near
historically minimum levels to maintain
the supply-demand balance.

that inventories in PADD II declined
to 9.5-10 million bbl, or almost 1
million bbl below the 3-year average.
Inventories in PADD II continued their
decline, falling to a seasonal minimum
of 7.5-8.0 million bbl at the end of
March 2007, and were 1.0-1.5 million
bbl below average.
Propane inventory in primary storage in PADD III totaled 38.8 million bbl
at the end of October 2006. Inventory
in PADD III was about 4.7 million bbl
above the 3-year average. By the end
of January 2007, inventory in primary

storage in PADD II totaled 23.6 million
bbl and was 4.8 million bbl higher than
the 3-year average.
Withdrawals of inventory accelerated
during February, and inventories fell to
a seasonal low of 12.4-12.8 million bbl
at the end of March 2007. Inventories
were about 2.5 million bbl below the
3-year average. The inventory swing
during first-quarter 2007 (from surplus

crude oil prices and ethylene feedstockparity values are the dominant influences on propane prices. Winter 2006-07
was not exceptional until March 2007.
At the beginning of the heating
season, propane prices in Mont Belvieu
averaged 93.7¢/gal in October 2006, or
almost 20% lower than the July average
of 116.3¢/gal. Despite the sharp decline
in spot prices, propane’s ratio vs. West
Texas Intermediate increased to 66.9%
in October 2006 vs. 65.7% in July
2006. These comparisons indicate that
propane simply tracked the decline in
WTI prices during third-quarter 2006.
WTI prices stabilized in November
2006 and then staged a modest rally in
December. Again consistent with crude
oil pricing trends, spot propane prices
in Mont Belvieu increased to 96.4¢/gal
in December 2006 but were 65.3% of
WTI.
Spot propane prices in Mont Belvieu
dipped below 90¢/gal in January 2007
and averaged 89.3¢/gal. Propane’s ratio
vs. WTI was stronger in January, however, and averaged 69.2%.
During sustained cold weather, propane prices in Mont Belvieu increased
to 97.9¢/gal in February and an estimated 103.8¢/gal in March. Propane’s
ratio vs. WTI was steady in February
and averaged 69.4% but jumped to
71.9% in March.

gasoline kept pace. Propane’s premium
relative to average feedstock-parity
values was consistently 3-4¢/gal during
first-quarter 2007.

Spring, summer 2007 prices
If WTI prices average $58-62/
bbl during second-quarter 2007, as
forecast, spot propane prices in Mont
Belvieu will likely average 97¢/gal but
slide from 100¢/gal in April to 91-93¢/
gal in June.
During third-quarter 2007, WTI
prices will decline by $6-8/bbl and average $55-57/bbl. Based on the decline
in WTI prices and the bearish trend
in spot prices for light naphthas and
other feedstocks derived from crude oil,
propane prices will average 86-89¢/gal
during third-quarter 2007. ✦

disruption. Expanding
the number of suppliers
often increases risk exposure, which
can be most effectively moderated by
pulling supplies from widely varied
sources.
Part 1 of this article (OGJ, Apr. 16,
2007, p. 57) examined the risks faced
by the US as it expands sources of its
natural gas supplies, as well as efforts
made to address these risks.
This concluding part completes the
examination of the US situation before
turning toward Europe’s still-increasing
dependence on Russia as it primary gas
supplier.

world. It will require a long-term, high
profile military presence from the US in
the Arabian Gulf to maintain the integrity of these projects.
Any change in politics in Qatar from
its current pro-US position, or more
extreme stances from OPEC, could
potentially jeopardize or interrupt LNG
supplies. Future warfare in the Persian
Gulf between other nations could
cause the Straits of Hormuz, a major
petroleum shipping chokepoint and
exit to the gulf, to close temporarily.
Events such as vessel collisions or
terrorist attacks on LNG shipping in
the Straits of Hormuz could also have
short-term effects on LNG supplies,
causing price spikes for natural gas
customers.
Such scenarios are not difficult to

French company, Poweo, and Austria’s Verbund are planning a 412-Mw
combined cycle gas turbine at Le Havre
to be fueled by gas from a new LNG
terminal. GdF operated a 0.5 billion cu

1965 and 1989, and this may be the
site used. 4Gas, formerly PetroPlus of

Political ends
EU leaders met in October 2006
with Russian Pres. Vladimir Putin in
Helsinki to seek guarantees that Russia
would not interrupt gas supplies for
political reasons. The meetings insulted
the intelligence of most gas consumers in the EU, showing the naiveté of
EU politicians regarding global energy
markets and monopolistic suppliers.

Portable 3D seismic acquisition system
The new Geode DZ is a 24 bit, portable
3D distributed seismic acquisition system
that brings ease-of-use, economy, and GPS
synchronized continuous monitoring to
high resolution petroleum and research
surveys.
Featuring 20 khz, 24-bit bandwidth
(allows surveys in hard rock), and a
modern, intuitive, and easy-to-use software interface, the system uses rugged,
lightweight analog/digital and line tap
modules that are connected by ethernet to
a standard Windows computer. The overall
result is faster, lower cost high resolution
3D surveys, the company says.
The DZ’s intuitive graphical software
eases the transition to 3D surveys. User
friendly linked modules include wizardbased OMNI Tools for quickly planning,

modeling, and simulating all aspects of a
survey, and this firm’s seismic acquisition
suite of tools for efficient data collection,
extensive QC testing (including state-ofthe-art line and geophone testing), and
graphically monitoring and controlling the
features and operation of the DZ hardware.
The Geode DZ is backed by a 3 year
parts and labor warranty. The architecture
is backwards compatible with existing
Geode hardware which can be simply
incorporated into a new 3D system.
A variety of sources can be used,
including environment friendly weight
drops, vibrators, and pseudorandom
(Mini-Sosie) sources as well as explosives.

Ethanol thrives
on word tricks
of persuasion
While ethanol claims a burgeoning share
of the US fuel market, courtesy of taxpayers,
a once-common name for gasoline-alcohol
blends remains in relative disuse.
Remember gasohol?
It’s what everyone called 90:10 gasolineethanol blends when they cruised into the
motor fuel market aboard generous tax
breaks in the 1980s.
Ethanol makers disliked the noun,

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

though. Years ago, someone from a large
ethanol maker called this writer to complain about repeated reference to “gasohol” in an editorial. Fuel so named had
become difﬁcult to sell, he explained. Motorists associated the term with engine-performance problems that many of them had
experienced with gasoline-alcohol blends.
The gripe must have been part of a
larger and apparently successful campaign.
Despite ethanol’s new popularity as a fuel
additive, the word “gasohol” is colloquial
at best. Remember when labels ﬁrst appeared on gasoline pumps to let consumers know which of them dispensed fuel
containing ethanol? Ethanol makers, fearful
of a market preference for neat gasoline,
protested the disclosure. They called it a
sinister tactic of Big Oil.
Consumer attitudes about gasohol have
reversed, of course—thanks somewhat to
improvements in fuel chemistry but mostly
to management of public opinion.
Americans have heard for years that
ethanol in fuel offers supply and environmental advantages worthy of lavish public
support. They apparently believe ethanol
represents an energy panacea that costs
nothing, despite clear evidence to the
contrary. So what a triumph of persuasion
it was when Congress passed the ethanol
mandate in the Energy Policy Act of 2005!
What victory sparkled in President George
W. Bush’s call in January to quintuple the
mandate! Linguistic tricks persist. They’re
essential to the shaping of attitudes. In
Texas and Ohio, Kroger stores are marketing (as opposed to selling much) E85, the
85:15 ethanol-gasoline blend that requires
ﬂex-fuel engines. The grocery chain’s
gasoline pumps—the ones with trafﬁc, as
opposed to the E85 dispensers with giant
ears of corn painted on their sides—sport
this label: “Enriched by 10% ethanol.”
Enriched? It makes you wonder if, in the

Analysts see tight oil market
Most analysts now see the world market for crude and petroleum products continuing to tighten through the rest of this year, pushing prices higher.
“It is a self-evident fact that the current state of the commodity markets provides
a positive operating environment for the entire energy complex,” said Wayne
Andrews in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc. “Our 2007 forecast is $64.11/bbl for crude oil and $7.56/Mcf for natural gas. We have an even more
bullish long-term price deck—$70/bbl oil and $10/Mcf gas—with a 2% price inﬂator
after 2008.” He said, “We continue to believe in the long-term sustainability of historically robust oil and gas prices.” Analysts at Barclays Capital Research in London
see crude prices averaging $10/bbl higher during the second half of 2007 than in the
ﬁrst half.
On Apr. 27, the June contract for benchmark US crudes rebounded $1.40 to
$66.46/bbl, the highest closing in almost a month on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, after Saudi Arabian authorities arrested 172 Islamic militants accused of
plotting attacks on oil installations. The May contract for reformulated blendstock for
oxygenate blending (RBOB) escalated by 7.1¢, or 3.1%, to $2.36/gal, its highest level
since early August.
Société Générale Group analysts foresee “a supply-driven market for the next 2
months.” There recently has been “not a single day without news of a US reﬁnery experiencing unexpected problems,” they said. “The Europe-to-US gasoline arbitrage
has reopened but is not as proﬁtable as [recent New York market prices] would suggest. The market is convinced US gasoline stocks won’t build for the next 3 weeks,”
they said. “Crude supply does not appear as an issue as long as US reﬁnery runs
stay low. The market is expecting Nigeria production to increase with the ‘imminent’
return of Forcados” oil ﬁeld to production.
‘Explosive start’
This year started with many analysts anticipating relatively hard landings for the
US and Chinese economies. Others expected sharp acceleration of supply growth
among crude producers outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
“Indeed, price behavior at the very start of the year seemed initially to signal a
sharp discontinuity, with prices falling by more than $12/bbl over just the ﬁrst 12
trading days of the year,” said Barclays Capital analysts. “After that explosive start,
most crude and oil product prices have ﬁrst recovered their early losses and then
moved higher as a somewhat less exciting truth has been revealed. In short, the general trends in 2007 are very much a continuation of the patterns of 2005 and 2006.”
Demand has increased, while non-OPEC supply “is still struggling to ﬁnd second gear rather than racing on ahead,” Barclays Capital analysts reported. “The
existing logistical distortions within the supply chain are still there and have generally become worse, while some other market distortions have become signiﬁcant.
The exposure to potential shocks remains acute, and weather conditions alone are
continuing to create an enhanced level of price volatility. Furthermore, even under
conditions of extreme downwards pressure at the front of the curve in early January, we detected no signiﬁcant shift in a general market perception of stronger prices
going forward. Indeed, the lowest settlement for the back end of the [NYMEX]-traded
[benchmark US crudes] curve this year has been $59.67/bbl, after which, back-end
prices moved fairly remorselessly back into the upper $60s.”
So far this year, wholesale gasoline prices have been more volatile than crude
prices, with gasoline crack spreads moving through wide arcs and at several points
reaching levels above $25/bbl at the front of the curve as absolute futures market
RBOB gasoline prices pushed on beyond $90/bbl, said Barclays Capital analysts.
Moreover, benchmark US crude prices have dislocated away from both cash markets
in the main US regions and other crude oil futures indicators. At the extremes, the
US benchmark crude has traded at unprecedented levels of more than $5/bbl below
Brent at the front of the curve and is currently projected by Barclays Capital to average less than front-month Brent across the year as a whole for the ﬁrst time ever.
Because US crude is “pipeline-based,” it has always been affected by logistical
dislocations in the Midwest, particularly at its Cushing pricing point. “When those
dislocations bite, then [benchmark US crude] can dislocate away from indicators of
broader global market conditions,” said Barclays analysts.
“Tightness and lack of ﬂexibility have continued upstream, downstream, and midstream and the bottlenecks and lack of availabilities in the markets for skilled and experienced labor and key items of capital equipment have remained entrenched,” they said.

The Markets
The oil sands and heavy oil industries are dynamic markets for both the energy and
power business sectors.
Quickly advancing development of oil sands and heavy oil assets is creating a huge
demand for technology and services. Cogeneration of power is driving facilities and
infrastructure growth.
In Canada, where the oil sands industry is a global leader, capital investment may reach
$100 billion over the next 10 years. Production is forecast to triple and as many as
32,000 jobs may be created.
Power generation by oil sands producers, along with development of transmission
infrastructure, offers significant opportunities. As much as 20% of an oil sands project
revenue may ultimately come from cogeneration facilities, according to Canada’s
National Energy Board.
Oil sands cogeneration—at a facility cost of about $1 million per MW capacity—may
grow from 1,450 MW in 2004 to more than 3,800 MW by 2015.
Canada is by no means alone. In the U.S., China and Venezuela, investment in oil sands
and heavy oil assets is also increasing rapidly.
To prosper in these competitive industries, operators depend on innovation to achieve
a wide range of technical and economic objectives. Service and technology companies
must reach these users with the right information.
PennWell Conference’s and Exhibitions now provides a premium event for this
important industry.

Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference
& Exhibition Mission Statement:
The mission of the Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition
is to provide an annual forum that addresses the technical challenges to safely and
cost-effectively develop oil sands and heavy oil resources and that encourages the
development of young professionals within the industry. The conference is organized to
facilitate the open exchange of technology, ideas, best practices, and experiences that
impact oil sands and heavy oil projects and operations.

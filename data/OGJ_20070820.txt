US House panel considers gasoline tax increase

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

The US House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee
is considering raising the federal gasoline tax to fund repairs of
bridges and other infrastructure in the National Highway System.
The proposal is part of a larger response to the Aug. 1 rush-hour
collapse of the I-35W bridge in Minneapolis that killed at least five
people.
“Certainly, raising [the gasoline tax] is on the table. Historically,
it’s how we’ve funded bridge and highway projects,” a committee
spokesman told OGJ on Aug. 9. “It probably is how we’ll go this
time, but nothing, including the amount of an increase, has been
decided yet.”
As he announced the initiative on Aug. 8 in Minneapolis, HTI
Committee Chairman James L. Oberstar (D-Minn.) said the US Department of Transportation rates as “structurally deficient” about
73,784 US highway bridges. Oberstar said the bill would significantly increase bridge inspection requirements, provide dedicated
funding, distribute funds based on public safety and need, and establish a fund similar to the Highway Trust Fund, which would
finance repairs and replacement of structurally deficient highway
bridges.
Oberstar said he has scheduled a hearing of the full committee
to examine the highway bridge problem on Oct. 5, and that he
will work to get the bill through Congress. He and other committee members emphasized that congressional and administrative earmarks would be prohibited under the legislation and that
revenues deposited in its trust fund would not be available for any
other purpose.

tions in Europe constitute an “efficient” answer to current market
dysfunctions.
However eight other EU countries—Denmark, Belgium, Spain,
Finland, the Netherlands, Romania, the UK, and Sweden—sent
their own letter to the Commission June 22 backing unbundling.
To these eight should be added Portugal, which holds the current 6-month presidency of the EU and is an ardent defender of
unbundling.
The Commission is to present in September a series of measures
to bolster the liberalization of the electric power and gas markets.
The gas market since July 1 officially has been fully opened, but an
open market has not yet materialized.
Meanwhile the EU Commission is giving fresh momentum to
its antitrust offensive. It has opened two investigations; one concerning France’s electricity utility EdF and Belgium’s Electrabel,
which are suspected of signing long-term contracts with industrial
clients to safeguard their domestic markets, and the other with
Germany’s gas operator E.On AG and France’s Gaz de France, which
are suspected of a secret agreement under which each party would
avoid entering the domestic market of the other.
The Megal gas pipeline, a joint venture of the two companies,
seems to be at the crux of this suspected agreement. Megal carries
Russian gas between the German-Czech Republic and GermanAustrian borders on the one hand and the German-French border
on the other, the only one that carries Russian gas into France.
GDF has a 44% stake in the 1,077 km Megal pipeline, E.On
has 51%, and Austria’s OMV AG 5%. It was built in 1976. GDF has
about 60% of the Megal capacity.

EU countries disagree over unbundling issue

Nigeria’s president replaces NNPC head

Nine European Union countries, led by France, have sent a joint
letter to the European Commission disputing the need for integrated energy operators to give up ownership of their transmission
networks, unbundling gas and electricity transportation from energy production and supply. The letter was made public by France’s
Minister for Ecology and Sustainable Development Jean-Louis Borloo, who also oversees energy matters.
Saying the unbundling process has not been proven effective,
the nine countries—France, Germany, Austria, Bulgaria, Slovakia,
Cyprus, Greece, Luxembourg, and Latvia—insist it “should remain
optional and not compulsory.” Unbundling, they say, “brings no
automatic guarantee of low prices for consumers and of sufficient
investments.”
Indeed, in the Netherlands, Denmark, and the UK, where unbundling has been carried out, prices have soared and are the highest in Europe, note observers close to Borloo.
The nine countries agree that stronger and harmonized regula-

Nigeria President Umaru Yar’Adua has removed Funso Kupolokun, group managing director of Nigeria National Petroleum
Corp., from his post.
Yar’Adua has replaced him with the next most-senior executive,
Abubakar Yar’Adua—of no relation to the president—until further
notice.
The firing comes amid intense speculation in Nigerian media
that the president was unhappy with the performance of NNPC,
the allegations of corruption in awarding contracts and misappropriation of funds, and that Kupolokun was on his way out. However, the president did not give a reason for dropping him.
The president, who took office on May 29, is committed to revamping Nigeria’s energy sector (OGJ Online, Aug. 7, 2007).
Abubakar Yar’Adua was previously the company’s executive director overseeing refineries and petrochemicals since 2003. ✦

Total makes oil discovery off Congo

Centurion makes gas discovery in Egypt

Operator Total E&P Congo made an oil discovery with its Cassiopee Est Marine-1 well on Mer Très Profonde Sud block in ultradeep water off Congo (Brazzaville).
The well, which was drilled to a TD of 3,330 m, flowed 5,600
b/d of oil on test. The MTPS Block lies 170 km offshore in 2,000
m of water. Field development studies will be launched once the
reserves are assessed.
Total said the discovery aimed “at building an economically viable pole of development in this ultradeepwater permit.”
This is the fourth discovery since 2000 on the MTPS permit,
which covers more than 5,000 sq km.
Total has a 40% interest with partners Eni Congo and Esso Exploration & Production Congo (Mer Très Profonde Sud) Ltd., each
with 30%.

Centurion Petroleum Corp., the upstream division of Dana Gas
PJSC, made a gas-condensate discovery with its Dabayaa-1 well on
the West Manzala exploration concession in Egypt.
On test, the well flowed 16.5 MMcfd of gas and 330 b/d of
condensate through a 32⁄64-in. choke. Centurion drilled the well to
a TD of 3,001 m and encountered a hydrocarbon-bearing interval
that extended over a 10-sq-km area.
The well is 6 km from existing facilities. Centurion expects to
finalize the new field’s development plan so as to bring the well on
production, possibly by November.
Centurion has plans to drill a total 12 exploration wells in Egypt
before yearend.

Cabinda makes 11th oil ﬁnd off Angola
Chevron Corp. unit Cabinda Gulf Oil Co. Ltd. (Cabgoc) and its
partners reported an oil discovery on deepwater Block 14 off Angola.
The well, Malange-1, was drilled in December 2006 in 873 ft of
water to a TVD of 15,562 ft. The well found 212 net ft of oil in the
Cretaceous-age Pinda reservoir. The well was tested in March and
flowed 7,669 b/d of high-quality crude.
The discovery will be followed by further drilling in addition
to geologic and engineering studies to appraise the field and assess
its potential reserves.
Malange-1 is the first Pinda discovery on Block 14 and the 11th
exploration discovery made in Block 14 since 1997. Most recently,
Cabinda and its partners drilled its 10th exploration well on Block
14 in January (OGJ Online, Jan. 26, 2007).
Cabgoc serves as operator of the block’s contractor group with
31% interest. Partners are Sonangol 20%, Eni Angola Exploration
BV 20%, Total E&P Angola 20%, and Galp 9%.

Drilling

&

McMoRan Exploration Co., New Orleans, said its Flatrock deeper
pool discovery well in Tiger Shoal field has encountered Miocene
gas-condensate pay in three zones deeper than the five previously
indicated productive on South Marsh Island Block 212 in the Gulf
of Mexico off Louisiana.
Wireline logs indicated 30 net ft of hydrocarbon-bearing sands
in a 120-ft gross interval in one sand, and log-while-drilling tools
indicated 41 net ft in a 153-ft gross interval in two sands, all in the
Operc section. Drilling has reached 18,100 ft enroute to 19,000 ft
to evaluate more of the Operc.
The well previously cut 189 net ft of hydrocarbon-bearing sands
in a combined 364-ft gross interval above 16,500 ft in the Rob-L
section as indicated by wireline logs (OGJ Online, July 16, 2007).
McMoRan, operator with 25% interest, is permitting three offset locations to provide further options to develop the multiple
reservoirs. Plains Exploration & Production Co. holds 30%.
Tiger Shoal field produced more than 3 tcf of gas from less than
12,500 ft. ✦

Production

Newﬁeld hikes gas ﬂow in three Texas areas
Newfield Exploration Co., Houston, reported having boosted
gas production in the Val Verde basin, Texas Panhandle, and South
Texas areas in the quarter ended June 30.
Gas output in the Val Verde basin reached a new high rate of
more than 100 MMcfd gross. Development involves the Canyon,
Strawn, and Ellenberger formations. Newfield, which entered the
basin in 2001 by acquiring properties from EEX Corp., has an average 70% working interest in the basin.
Production from Stiles/Britt Ranch field in Wheeler County in
the Texas Panhandle reached a record 74 MMcfd gross, and five
operated rigs are running in the field. Newfield is operator with
95-100% working interest.
Production reached a new high of 82 MMcfd gross in a South
Texas joint venture with ExxonMobil Corp. in which Newfield
has 50% interest. Two rigs are running there, and Newfield has

Statoil installs Tordis subsea production system
Statoil ASA has installed the 1,250-tonne Tordis subsea production unit near Gullfaks field in the Norwegian North Sea, using the
Saipem S7000 heavy-lift crane vessel.
The system is said to be the world’s first subsea installation to
separate water and sand from oil wells and pump them directly
into the bedrock from the seabed, a process that needs no energyintensive detour to a surface platform.
The project will improve oil recovery on Tordis to 55% from
49%, essentially producing an additional 35 million bbl of oil
(OGJ Online, Aug. 3, 2007).
Marine operations in Tordis field will continue over the next
few months, Statoil said. The seabed separator will be tied back
now with pipelines and control cables to the Statoil-operated

Gullfaks C platform, and subsea separation will begin this autumn.
Although the unit was successfully installed as planned, a man
from Saipem fell overboard and died when the Tordis structure was
at a depth of 180 m. Statoil has launched an investigation.
Oil is transported from Tordis by pipeline to Gullfaks C, 11 km
to the southeast, for processing, storage, and export.

Operation contract let for Al Zaafarana FPSO
Gemsa Petroleum Co., on behalf of its partners, has let a contract valued at 200 million kroner to Aker Kvaerner for operation,
management, and maintenance of the Al Zaafarana floating production, storage, and offloading vessel, which it operates in the
Red Sea off Egypt.
The 5-year contract begins Sept. 1 and includes options to extend the primary term.
The 120-dwt FPSO processes about 30,000 b/d of crude oil
from Al Zaafarana field. It also stores the produced oil, which is
transported onshore via shuttle tankers. It can accommodate a crew
of 25.
The vessel previously had undergone repairs of the lower strakes
of two longitudinal bulkheads that had corroded (OGJ, Oct. 3,
2005, Newsletter).

Processing
PDVSA building reﬁnery in Nicaragua
Venezuela’s President Hugo Chavez and his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega recently launched construction of a 150,000
b/d refinery in Piedras Blancas, near Nicaragua’s Pacific coast and
about 90 km west of its capital, Managua.
Because the refinery will produce five times more product than
Nicaragua uses, Chavez said the arrangement will transform the
Central American nation into a net exporter after start-up in 4-5
years. Plans call for exports to other Central American countries, to
the western coast of North America, and possibly to Asia.
Chavez said that total investment in the project could reach $4
billion and that the entire amount will be financed by a newly
formed joint venture called Alba de Nicaragua SA (Albanisa). Albanisa is comprised of Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) subsidiary PDV Caribe 55% and the Nicaraguan state oil company
Petronic 45%.
The immediate investment aim of the Sandino-Bolivar refinery—named in memory of the national heroes of Nicaragua and
Venezuela, respectively—will be to increase storage capacity to
27,000 bbl from the current 14,000 bbl. Further plans call for the
eventual construction of a petrochemical complex.
Last year, PDVSA said it planned to build a pipeline through Nicaragua to transport oil from the Caribbean to the Pacific, bypassing the Panama Canal (OGJ Online, Dec. 19, 2006).

Peru heavy oil ﬁelds await development
Barrett Resources (Peru) LLC, based in Lima and registered in
Delaware, retained a financial advisor to review alternatives to facilitate development of three large heavy oil fields in northeastern
Peru.
The Peruvian government recently approved Barrett’s initial development plan for Paiche, Piranya, and Dorado fields on Block
67 in the Maranon basin. The analysis of strategic and financing
alternatives should be completed by yearend.
The company said development would require 400 km of 16in. pipeline and production could start in 2010, attaining 100,000
b/d thereafter.
The former Barrett Resources Corp., public Denver independent, discovered the three fields in 1998 and was unable to attract a partner with heavy oil development expertise before its
sale to Williams Cos., Tulsa, in August 2001 (OGJ Online, Jan.
17, 2006).
Three 7,000-ft discovery wells identified an estimated 90-313
million bbl of recoverable oil. Dorado cut 71 ft of pay with 1416° gravity oil. Pirana cut 84 ft of oil pay with 12-21° gravity oil.
Paiche cut 179 ft of total pay, including 122 ft of oil pay, with
12-13° gravity oil and low-btu gas. ✦

western shore of the gulf, will produce 120,000 tonnes/year of
propane and butane.
Egyptian General Petroleum Corp. (EGPC) will supply gas for
the plant under a long-term supply contract. Danagaz and its partners also have signed the land and sea berth agreements for products exports. Civil engineering and installation construction will be
performed by local contractors.
The plant will operate at highly efficient recovery rates, recovering 99% of the propane in the gas stream and 100% of the butane,
Dana Gas said. Due to the nature of the gas supply, the project will
produce 110,000 tonnes/year of exportable international specification propane, which will represent about 90% of the total gas
liquid product from the plant.
France, Spain, Italy, and Turkey are expected to buy propane
from the plant. “Potentially higher-margin Indian Ocean region
markets are a future possibility,” as well, Dana Gas said. The butane
produced, about 10,000 tonnes/year, will be sold on long-term
contracts to help meet Egypt’s domestic requirements.

Gassled to upgrade Karsto gas plant

The Gassled partnership plans to invest 6.5 billion kroner to

“This is an extensive operation that will take place in many areas of the plant and a number of systems simultaneously,” Barland
said. “Our main focus will be [health, safety, and the environment]

More than 30 fields are tied back to Karsto via pipeline, and

about 30% of Norway’s annual gas exports exit from the Karsto

Algonquin to begin Ramapo pipeline expansion
Algonquin Gas Transmission LLC soon will begin construction
associated with the Ramapo expansion project, which will enable
transportation of new volumes of natural gas to two major distribution companies serving the northeastern US.
The $200 million expansion involves replacing a 4.8-mile section of 26-in. pipeline with 42-in. pipe in Ramapo, NY; building
a compressor station in Oxford, Conn.; adding turbine compressor units at three existing stations in New York and New Jersey;
modifying piping and other facilities at an existing meter station in
Ramapo; and rebuilding a meter station in Brookfield, Conn.
The expanded pipeline, to be placed into service in November
2008, will deliver 319 MMcfd of gas to KeySpan Energy and Con
Edison of New York via the Millennium Pipeline, currently under
construction.
Interest in the pipeline is held 100% by Algonquin’s parent
company Spectra Energy.

FERC gives approval for Calhoun LNG project
Gulf Coast LNG Partners LP said the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has issued the final environmental impact statement for its proposed Calhoun LNG receiving terminal and associated pipeline at Port Lavaca-Point Comfort in Calhoun County, Tex.
FERC concluded in the FEIS that the construction of the Calhoun LNG project, with appropriate mitigating measures as recommended, would be an environmentally acceptable action.
The Calhoun project, slated for full operation in 2009-10, consists of an LNG terminal with two 160,000 cu m storage tanks and
1 bcfd of gas vaporization and liquid separation capacity. It also includes a 27-mile, 36-in. pipeline—Point Comfort Pipeline—which
will extend from the terminal and connect with nine major pipelines including five interstate and four intrastate pipeline systems
serving Texas and the Midwest, the Northeast, and the Southeast.
The Point Comfort Pipeline is designed to transport 1 bcfd.
Earlier this year, GCLP signed a memorandum of understanding
for Port Lavaca LNG Services LLC to become operator of the terminal (OGJ Online, Mar. 27, 2007).

Malaysian ﬁrm plans tank farms in China
Malaysian trading firm Ben Rautin Sdn. Bhd. plans to develop a
cluster of oil tank farms and a port in Lufeng, China, as part of a

comprised of industrial park, township, tank farms, and a port.
Ben Rautin is working with the Beijing Petroleum Design Institute to determine storage capacity requirements and construction
costs, Ismail said.
It also plans to build four storage tanks for petroleum products
at Huizhou port, between Lufeng and Shenzhen in southern China.
Construction starting dates were not given.
Meanwhile, Ben Rautin will discuss oil supplies and financing
for the two projects with investors from the Middle East, which are
due in Malaysia next month. Ismail did not name the investors or
their counties.
To cut transportation costs, Ismail said, Ben Rautin may use the
proposed $7 billion transpeninsular oil pipeline as part of the supply chain transporting crude from the Middle East to the China
industrial park.
Last month, Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi
said Malaysia will examine the cost and environmental impact of
a proposed multibillion dollar oil pipeline before approving the
project (OGJ Online, July 18, 2007).
Earlier, Ranhill Engineers & Constructors secured a contract for
the design, engineering, procurement, construction, and testing of
a 320-km west-east oil pipeline across Malaysia (OGJ Online, May
29, 2007).

Pertamina plans LNG plant at Senoro
Indonesia’s PT Pertamina will join Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Co.
Inc. in building a $1 billion LNG plant at Senoro in Central Sulawesi. An agreement will be signed by Indonesia and Japan when
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visits Indonesia Aug. 19-21,
said Pertamina Pres. Director Ari Sumarno.
Construction of the 2 million tonnes/year plant is scheduled to
begin this year and to come on stream by 2010.
Mitsubishi, which will become the sole buyer of the facility’s
LNG, is the project’s majority shareholder, with a 51% stake, while
Pertamina owns 29% and Medco, 20% (OGJ Online, Jan. 19,
2007).
Source gas will come from the Senoro Block, which has 1.53 tcf
of proved reserves and is jointly operated by Pertamina and Medco.
Additional supplies will come from Pertamina-operated Matindok
Block, which has 0.7 tcf of proved reserves.
The Senoro LNG plant is one of four energy deals to be signed
between Indonesia and Japan, according to Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro. The other three agreements
will take up the development of a gas pipeline and two coal-fired
power plants. ✦

Raising gasoline taxes
Tragic events give the US oil industry a chance
to claim principled ground in its relations with
customers. It must not miss the opportunity.
The collapse on Aug. 1 of a busy interstatehighway bridge in Minneapolis, the death toll
for which had reached nine at this writing, has
revived calls for increased taxation of gasoline. A
spokesman for the US House Transportation and
Infrastructure confirmed that a tax hike is under consideration. President George W. Bush has
expressed reluctance to support the idea (OGJ
Online, Aug. 10, 2007).

Standard argument
Bridge-maintenance needs thus join the standard argument for a deepened tax bite on gasoline: that it would discourage oil consumption
and thereby reduce emissions of air pollutants and
greenhouse gases, lower US dependence on foreign oil, preserve a depleting resource for future
generations, and keep money away from foreign
regimes that support terrorism. Each of those
claims has weaknesses. But the industry doesn’t
need to address them when gasoline taxes are at
issue. All the industry needs to do is oppose new
taxation for the simple reason that higher taxes
would hurt its customers. That’s all. That’s enough.
For oil consumers, these are not happy times.
Growing demand and limited supply have pushed
prices of gasoline and other oil products to uncomfortable levels. Inevitably, the government has
blundered to the rescue with ill-conceived, politically motivated responses that can only aggravate
the stress. Against prices elevated by market forces,
consumers need no protection because they hold
the ultimate defense: the option to consume less.
Against costs imposed by politicians claiming
to act on their behalf, consumers aren’t so lucky.
Here, they need an advocate. What better advocate
can there be for oil and gas consumers than the
industry that supplies oil and gas?
Within that industry, however, support always
can be found for a gasoline tax hike. The view usually rests on the supposed need to lower consumption. Coming from the oil industry, this position
can be made to seem self-sacrificial and therefore
especially righteous. Within the industry itself, it
can feel like the moral high ground.

Yet the assertion that lower gasoline use merits
taxation carries poisonous implications. One of
them is that some optimum rate of consumption exists, always below the current level, toward
which it is the business of government to steer
markets. But what is that optimum consumption
level? Politicians and oil companies have no way
of knowing and can only guess at the answer. A
variation of this implication is that any lower rate
of consumption is always better than the present
level. In that case, there is no logical limit to the
taxation rate.
Demand-based arguments for new federal taxes
moreover imply that gasoline use inherently contradicts national interests. The assertion is wrong;
when espoused by anyone in the oil industry it’s
hypocritical. The national benefits of gasoline use,
which relate to unrivaled cost and convenience,
far outweigh the disadvantages, mainly the environmental risks. The oil industry should focus its
politics on that balance and its strategies on the
environmental performance of its products and
operations.

Playing defense
Attacked in politics continuously and from
many directions, the oil industry always plays
defense. Its public message thus tends to ring
with negativity: Oil companies do not manipulate
prices; their work doesn’t spoil the environment;
they don’t have profit margins as wide as everyone thinks. This is no way to earn general political
support.
The better, positive approach is to advocate
strongly, noisily, and consistently on behalf of oil
industry customers—energy consumers—even
when they’re angry about the price of gasoline.
The way to do that consistently is to assert free
markets over government manipulation in all
matters related to energy. And the way to do it
immediately is to point out the roaring fallacy of
popular comparisons of oil price increases with
tax hikes. The markets that raise oil prices eventually cycle and lower the harm to consumers. The
governments that raise taxes seldom reverse course
and more often—as the House is considering
now—just return for more. ✦

N T E R E S T
After 10 years of indecision, China is
building a strategic petroleum reserve
(SPR) to protect against possible oil
supply cutoffs and is addressing the
companion issues of securing sufficient oil and improving the country’s
pipeline and refining infrastructure to
accommodate the reserves.
From 1993 until Hu Jintao’s accession to power in 2003, the “build” and
“don’t build” factions’
debate raged within
China over the merits of
an SPR. This debate likely
was prolonged by China’s
lack of a powerful central
energy ministry that
could control the various government bureaucracies, state oil
companies, and other stakeholders who
compete to shape China’s energy policy.
China’s Ministry of Energy (1988-93)
was dissolved after energy producers
incorporated in 1988 and refused to
work with the new ministry.
In 2004, however, Chinese companies began building four Phase 1 reserve sites. In 2006 China commenced
filling the first site at Zhenhai, which
reportedly was completed in June of
this year.
Chinese firms also are improving
the pipeline and refining infrastructure
essential for utilizing SPR oil during
a crisis. Fig. 1 provides a timeline of
China’s SPR plans.

Challenges
However, China also is facing important challenges in planning its SPR,
including:
• High construction, storage, and oil
acquisition costs.
• The need to formulate SPR management guidelines.
• Criticism for driving up world
oil prices. This has created a vicious
circle in which Chinese decision-makers found that opacity and transparency
both lead to condemnation, and they
ultimately chose opaque SPR oil acquisition practices.
Some Chinese analysts believe that
an SPR can be used to control oil price
swings. If China uses its SPR for price
management, however, it would create
conflict with the International Energy
Agency (IEA), which helps govern the
Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development countries’ stockpile use. At the December 2006 Five
Country energy ministers’ meeting in
Beijing, Chinese officials said the SPR
would not be used for price management. A June 17 report from Xinhua
Financial Network News, nevertheless,
notes that 30% of the SPR’s capacity
may be leased out to commercial firms.
If so, commercial and strategic storage space should be kept physically
separate, or else pressure could arise to
manipulate stockpile levels in response
to price concerns.

High costs and other factors may
drive China to adopt a more flexible
SPR management system than that used
by Japan and the US. China’s SPR is still
a work in progress and is characterized
more by a “crossing the river by feeling
the stones” approach than by a coherent
national policy. This analysis attempts
to arrange the “stones” by examining
the following aspects of China’s SPR
development:
• China’s current SPR construction
status.
• Possible operational models.
• Potential methods of SPR financing
and management.
• Sources of oil for China’s SPR.
• SPR connections to broader refining and pipeline systems.
• Key unresolved issues.

Current status
China’s SPR is being constructed
in three phases. In Phase 1, due to be
completed by yearend 2008, some 100
million bbl of crude oil will be stored
at Dalian and Huangdao, in Shandong,
and Zhenhai and Zhoushan in Zhejiang province, roughly 150 km from
Shanghai. Zhenhai has taken cargoes
from Russia and the Middle East, and
Zhoushan is injecting crude from the
Middle East and Africa—particularly
Angola, Iran, and Sudan—as well as
local production from Bohai Gulf and
Liaohe fields. The Huangdao reserve is
almost certain to begin filling by yearend unless oil prices spike. The Dalian
SPR site is set to be completed in 2008.
Fig. 2 provides details on the status and
capacities of the four Phase 1 SPR sites.
April 2007 data showed a disparity
of more than 600,000 b/d between
China’s crude oil imports and refinery
throughputs. While some of this gap
may be attributable to spotty data, it is
likely that a sizeable proportion of this
oil flowed into commercial and strategic stockpiles. China’s SPR fill rate is
price-sensitive, and the final authority
to purchase crude for the reserve lies
with the State Council.
Phases 2 and 3 will bring China’s
strategic crude holdings to 300 million

and 500 million bbl, respectively. Sites
are still being determined. The port
of Caofeidian on the Bohai Gulf 120
km northeast of Beijing apparently has
been selected as a Phase 2 reserve base.
Caofeidian will be able to accommodate
very large crude carriers (VLCCs) and
will be located near substantial refining
and petrochemical projects. It also lies
near the giant new Jidong Nanpu oil
field, which by 2010 could be producing 200,000 b/d.
China is considering a Phase 2 SPR
site in Northwestern Gansu province,
which could be fed with crude piped in
from Kazakhstan and Xinjiang. It would
lie near Lanzhou, which has a large
refining capacity. The cities of Nansha
and Bao’an in Guangdong province and
a site on Hainan Island are also on the
Phase 2 short list. China does not appear to have begun formal selection of
Phase 3 sites. Fig. 3 shows Phase 1 SPR
sites and projected Phase 2 sites.

Operational models
As Chinese analysts consider models
for China’s SPR, they primarily look to
the US, Japan, and South Korea.
• US model. The fully governmentfunded US SPR consists primarily of 62
solution-mined caverns in salt domes
along the Texas and Louisiana Gulf
Coast that can store up to 727 million
bbl of crude. DynMcDermott Corp.
manages these sites on behalf of the US
Department of Energy at a project management office in New Orleans.
US SPR management policies are
conservative. The president can order a
“full drawdown” of the SPR to offset a
severe oil supply disruption caused by
an interruption in imports, interruptions in domestic oil supplies, or an
“act of God,” such as floods, hurricanes,
or other disruptions. He also can order
a limited drawdown to cope with less
serious interruptions that would have
deleterious economic effects. Limited
drawdowns cannot exceed 30 million

China’s approach
China appears to be pursuing a stateprivate SPR system. National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC)
head Ma Kai says the commercial oil
stocks of China National Petroleum
Corp., Sinopec, and China National
Offshore Oil Co. Ltd. will all play a role
in China’s SPR. As of June 2007 these
stocks provide about 21 days of forward
coverage. According to some sources,
NDRC wants China’s SPR to be run like

new energy law?
• What drawdown standards will
China use? Will it abide by the IEA
guideline of using strategic stocks to
manage 7.5% of its greater supply disruptions, or will it develop an entirely
independent system?
• How closely will China coordinate
its SPR management policies with the
IEA? There currently are consultative
meetings, but no formal cooperation.
Now that China has made the decision to build an SPR and is taking steps
to implement it, it remains to be seen
how the program will evolve from this
point and how the SPR will affect world

Mulva: Industry must ‘act with
courage and forethought’ on energy
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent

existing fields and refineries have been
pushed to near-maximum capacity to
keep up with demand, which has cut
surplus capacity to a level below what
is needed to offset major disruptions.
Most of the world’s new oil and gas resources will come from countries with
political beliefs and economic situations different from those in the US, he
cautioned.
“So the available supplies of potential imports may not be as large as we
would like. And to buy these imports,
we will have to compete for them
price-wise in the world market,” he
said.

US energy policies should diversify
sources, lower carbon intensity, improve energy efficiency, and encourage investments in new technologies,
recommended ConocoPhillips Chief
Executive James J. Mulva in a July 19
luncheon address at the US Chamber of
Commerce.
“The energy cupboard is not bare,”
he said. “We have the resources to
bridge the gap until cleaner-burning
fuels and alternative sources can provide a meaningful share of our energy.
But in the meantime, we must act with
courage and forethought.”
Mulva urged

Costs rising
Costs to develop new oil and gas
supplies are climbing as prices for labor,
equipment, and materials increase and
energy prospects are more challenging,
Mulva said. Increased environmental
regulation, much of which is worthwhile, also adds to costs, he added.
“Meanwhile, US policies have actually undermined energy security by
restricting access to new areas while
doing nothing meaningful to promote
energy conservation. As a result, the US
now imports 60% of its oil. Natural gas
imports are also growing,” Mulva said.
Recent congressional actions punish
the energy industry instead of solving
problems, he maintained. “One proposal would cap gasoline prices during
emergencies. But in the past, we have
seen that temporarily higher prices help
attract supplies from elsewhere and
reduce demand. This restores the supply-demand balance, and prices then go
back down,” he said.
Mulva also criticized proposals to tax
domestic production or impose new
levies on major oil companies. Both
would reduce investments, he warned.
And a bill that would make foreign
oil producers subject to US antitrust law
is “an appeal to nationalism that is the
opposite of what we should be doing,
which is working together to encourage
production,” he added.
He also expressed concern that some
lawmakers won’t acknowledge that
oil, gas, and coal will be needed while
biofuel and other renewable alternatives
are being developed. “Unfortunately,
some of the proposed legislation, such
as further restricting drilling access
would make the current situation
worse.” Mulva said. “There also is too
much that it would not do, such as
clear the permitting roadblocks we face
in trying to build infrastructure or do
enough to reduce demand growth.”

Diversiﬁcation
Of his four broad recommendations,
he went into the greatest detail about
diversifying energy sources, which he
said must start by encouraging more

ignoring so much energy potential,” he
maintained.
Meanwhile, the process for obtaining
permits to build critical infrastructure
such as LNG terminals, additional refining capacity, and electric power lines
must be improved, he said. “Where
infrastructure is clearly needed to serve
the national interest, federal pre-eminence is needed over local or special
interests,” he said.
Mulva said the excitement over
biofuels’ potential is justified and that
corn-based ethanol, of which the oil industry already uses 6 billion gal/year, is
a good start. He said he supports the US
Senate’s proposal to mandate the use of
15 billion gal/year but maintained that
the market should determine where
certain concentrations are desirable,
such as E-85 in the Midwest for flexfuel vehicles.

MMS: Ultradeepwater
gulf drilling remains strong
A record number of drilling rigs
are currently working in the ultradeep
water in the Gulf of Mexico, according
to the US Minerals Management Service.
“For the first time, 15 rigs are drilling
for oil and gas in 5,000 ft of water or
greater in the gulf,” said MMS director
Randall Luthi.
And while drilling activity in deepwater remains strong, advances also
have been made in the area of production. In July Atwater Valley Producers
Group reported that natural gas production had begun from Independence
Hub, a semisubmersible platform
moored in 8,000 ft of water on Mississippi Canyon Block 920, 123 miles
southeast of Biloxi, Miss., MMS said
(OGJ Online, July 20, 2007).
When fully operational, Independence Hub platform, reportedly the
world’s deepest production platform
ever installed as well as the largest
offshore gas processing facility, will
produce gas from 15 subsea wells. Before Independence Hub’s start-up, MMS
noted, the production facility in the
deepest water was the Na Kika floating
production system in 6,340 ft of water,
operated by BP PLC.
Currently, 70% of the gulf’s oil
production comes from leases in water
greater than 1,000 ft while 40% of the
gulf’s gas production comes from leases
in those same water depths.
As of April, the gulf’s production
was estimated at 1.3 million b/d of oil
and 7.7 bcfd of gas.

Mulva said encouraging investment
in new technologies, his fourth recommendation, is necessary to maximize
recovery of conventional resources,
successfully operate more-complex
projects in harsher environments, and

improve environmental performance.
“Better technologies will also allow us
to develop new alternative and unconventional sources, and enable us to
lower our carbon intensity and improve
the efficiency of energy use across the
entire economy,” he said. ✦

ocky Mountain oil producers think they aren’t getting a
fair price. Royalty owners and state
governments agree. That’s why the
Interstate Oil & Gas Compact Commission is hosting a Rocky Mountain
Crude Oil Market Dynamics Summit
Sept. 4-5 in Denver.
“It’s been the case for some
time as we’ve increased production
throughout the Rockies. That has put
a strain on pipeline infrastructure,
which affects wellhead prices and, ultimately, mineral owners and states,”
explained North Dakota Gov. John
Hoeven, who chairs the IOGCC.
When a large Denver refinery shut
down in 2006, Rockies producers
got $25-30/bbl less than what was
paid for similar grades elsewhere in
the US.
Hoeven told me that IOGCC assembled a task force to examine the
problem after he and Govs. Dave
Freudenthal of Wyoming and Brian
Schweitzer of Montana discussed it.
Brian Jeffries, executive director of
the Wyoming Pipeline Authority, said,
“The situation has eased so that typically there’s a $5-7[/bbl] differential
to Cushing prices. Five years ago,
however, it was only $1 or $2. There
still are smaller producers, either because of small volumes or the quality
of the crude, who are experiencing
wider differentials.”

to replace overseas imports, we’re
going to see more problems in the
Rockies,” he said.
Royalty owners and state governments want better prices, too. “In
North Dakota alone, the state lost
around $19 million in tax revenues,
and the producers and royalty and
mineral owners lost over $203 million in revenue during 2006,” Ness
told me.
The conference will address how
to raise transportation capacity from
the Rockies, including the Williston basin, according to Hoeven. It’s
important to make sure crude moves
east as well as west, he added. “Certain refineries want specific mixes
of crude. They also have to deal with
bottlenecks getting their products to
market.”

Looking for commitments

Because expansion is capital-intensive, pipelines won’t build systems
on speculation, Jeffries said.
“They’re looking for commitments, either to volumes or flat fees,
over 10 years,” he said. “The issue
now is whether there are enough
credit-worthy producers who are
comfortable making that kind of
commitment.”
Ness said project opponents and
Congress aren’t helping matters. “We

New BLM director faces
Colorado leasing protests
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
The US Senate voted to confirm
James L. Caswell as US Bureau of Land
Management director on Aug. 3 after
Sen. Ken Salazar (D-Colo.) removed the
hold he had placed on the nomination
(OGJ, Aug. 6, 2007, Newsletter). But
Caswell and the US Department of Interior agency face other protests about
oil and gas leasing from Colorado state
and local government officials as well
as other members of its congressional
delegation.
Salazar said that he would allow the
nomination to proceed because US
Sec. of the Interior Dirk A. Kempthorne
agreed to give Colorado 120 days to
review and comment on BLM’s plan
to issue oil and gas leases on the Roan
Plateau near Grand Junction.
“What is just as important is what
[DOI] does after the 120-day period.
Sec. Kempthorne gave me his commitment that BLM would respond in good
faith to the comments and concerns
raised during the review period and address them,” Salazar said.
The Senate confirmed Caswell’s
nomination one day before the House
passed a broad energy bill that included
language banning surface occupancy
on the Roan Plateau if BLM issues
leases. Rep. John Salazar (D-Colo.), Sen.
Salazar’s brother, and Rep. Mark Udall
(D-Colo.) worked to insert the provision when HR 3221 was in the Rules
Committee. “While I was pleased to
learn that [DOI] finally decided to delay
leasing the top of the Roan Plateau, I
believe we must continue to strike a
balance,” said Rep. Salazar on Aug. 4.

“The language protecting the top of the
Roan in the energy bill does just that.”
He and Udall said it was a compromise, but oil and gas industry and other
groups said it effectively locks up about
9 tcf of onshore natural gas.
Two days later, Rep. Salazar asked
Colorado State BLM Director Sally
Wisely to defer offering nine parcels in

the San Luis Hills area of Conejos and
Costilla counties as part of a scheduled
Aug. 9 lease sale. Many local residents,
including surface landholders and grazing permit holders, did not learn of the
sale until a July 23 community meeting,
he explained.
The federal agency already had
decided to defer leasing the parcels

and one other unrelated tract, a Colorado BLM spokesman told OGJ. “It’s
an area that had seen very little oil and
gas activity in recent years. We felt that
we needed more time to educate the
people there about the process and its
safeguards,” he said, adding that 99
other parcels covering some 72,000
acres were offered. ✦

Nigeria’s president assumes energy minister role
Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
Umaru Yar’Adua, Nigeria’s new
president, has taken on the responsibilities of the energy ministry and has
appointed three junior ministers to support him in the role. Odein Ajumogobia
was named junior minister for petroleum, Fatimah Ibrahim for power, and
Odusina Emmanuel for gas.
Dividing the energy ministry into
smaller units and appointing a minister
for gas highlights the importance that
Yar’Adua has given to developing Nigeria’s gas resources, which the previous
administration stressed will become as
important as oil, if not more important. Nigeria has 187 tcf of proved gas
reserves, and Yar’Adua said he wants gas
to be allocated for domestic power generation (OGJ Online, June 18, 2007).
Analysts had mixed reactions to the
appointments. Rolake Akinola, West
Africa analyst at Control Risks, told
OGJ: “With the scale of reform required
in all three sectors, it probably makes
pragmatic sense to split the portfolio.
However, Yar’Adua is creating expectations about the government’s delivery
and will need to demonstrate that there
have been improvements early on.”
Jon Clark, director of oil and gas at
Ernst & Young, told OGJ: ‘Having different people responsible for different
aspects of the energy chain (such as
oil and power) is not uncommon. Oil
companies will need to make sure they
understand the new regime and have
appropriate relationships in place for

and development of power generation
their business needs.”
However Alex Gorbansky, managing for Nigeria’s citizens, which Yar’Adua
director of Frontier Strategy Group, said stressed in his election campaign.
Gorbansky added: “While most
the junior ministers were unlikely to
have real decision-making authority or investors welcome the recent announcement from Nigeria as a continuation
influence in the short-term and would
look to accumulate influence and rents of free market policies, our views are
less sanguine given continued violence
over time. “For companies, however,
this new administrative structure means in the Delta, the lack of diversification
that they will now
have to deal with
yet another branch
of Nigeria’s corrupt and unwieldy
bureaucracy and
effectively another

the fence with the
president and the
junior ministers.”

s oil diplomacy driving Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez over
the edge? If I compared myself with
Jesus, most people would think me a
candidate for a straitjacket.
That’s about the only kind of
jacket I’m beginning to think the
Venezuela president should be trying
on these days.
In a speech reminiscent of the Sermon on the Mount, Chavez recently
told fellow leaders in the Caribbean
that his country would supply them
with oil at preferential rates.
“Venezuela puts this oil wealth at
the disposition of our peoples of the
Caribbean,” Chavez said. “We’re going to share it like Christ....It will be
enough for everyone.”

But lest we go too far down the
garden path with Chavez and his
cohorts, let’s remember just who
is helping Venezuela with its own
refineries.

A yen for oil

In March, Japan Gasoline, a firm
that designs refineries and similar
plants, and Venezuela’s Inelectra announced plans to carry out “extended
basic engineering” work at Petroleos
de Venezuela SA’s Puerto La Cruz
refinery.
Construction work for retooling

of the economy and the shock that
could result from a significant drop in
oil price, and the growing influence of
China in the country.”
Petroleum pricing in Nigeria is a
major issue that caused a recent labor
strike because of the steep increase
in domestic prices, which is affecting consumers and Nigeria’s economy.
The government has found it difficult
to continue to subsidize fuel imports,
although it has promised a 1-year cap
on domestic fuel prices.
Akinola said the power sector, which
is inefficient and has stalled in advancing privatization, also faces challenges:
“The system is bureaucratic and there
are some assets belonging to the old
state power company NEPA that need
overhauling. Investors need to sink in
deep cash and in that sector you don’t
usually make any gains on money for
years to come. Yar’Adua needs to keep
on wooing investors, but they find it
difficult to value assets because of the
insecurity in the Delta, and the unions
have occasionally accused the government of underpricing the assets.”
This is not the first time Nigeria’s
president has taken control of the
energy portfolio, as his predecessor
Olesegun Obasanjo controlled it for the
8 years he was in power. Many Nigerians, however, felt that he delivered
little benefit. Obasanjo, who picked
Yar’Adua as his successor, is expected to
wield considerable influence in the new
administration.
According to Nigerian reports,
Yar’Adua is expected to declare a state
of emergency in the energy sector and
then bring in Nasiru el-Rufai, former
high-profile minister of the capital city,
Abuja, to oversee it. Nasiru-el-Rufai has
a track record of reforming Nigeria’s
slums and would be able to take on
those opposing change within Nigeria’s
power sector.
The unveiling of Yar’Adua’s new cabinet comes 2 months after he took the
reins of power from Obasanjo May 29.
The delay in picking a cabinet occurred
because the legitimacy of Yar’Adua’s
mandate has been questioned. ✦

The proposal, which has been on the

Secondly, he said, is Nigeria’s and

every major project

with development in the Niger Delta—
such as refineries and petrochemical
plants—to ensure that the region enjoys
the benefit of investments.
Some sales details have yet to be
worked out. No decision has been
made, for example, on how the gas
would be sold into Europe, whether
Nigeria would be selling to Sonatrach
to market or Nigeria directly accessing the European market. Khelil and
Chukwuku stressed that they are working in partnership, although Chukwuku
conceded that Sonatrach has more
experience than Nigeria in marketing
gas to Europe. Initially, he added, it
would make sense to allow Sonatrach to
take the lead. Khelil said, “It is whatever
is the most interesting solution and the
most profitable.” ✦

Despite recent production decline,
Europe is still the world’s largest offshore oil and gas producer.
Although oil prices have remained
high for nearly 3 years, and total reserves probably still exceed 100 billion
bbl, the mature parts of the region such
as the UK have become less attractive
for the oil majors. However, opportunities still abound for small E&P company
players.
Right down
the food chain,
home-grown
European
offshore
contractors are
winning business worldwide and so are the European
stock markets--London has hosted the
IPOs of a number of international oilfield service companies.
The following is an examination
of the state of plays and prospects and
highlights some challenges ahead.

Basins off NW Europe offer
opportunities in troubled seas

Offshore Europe

Hidden gems
Although generally referred to as
“the North Sea,” the offshore play is
more correctly the North Western Europe Continental Shelf (NWECS).
The area includes the waters of
several countries: Denmark, Germany,
Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, and
the UK. However, Norway and the UK
account for most of the action.
36

L O P M E N T
The Norwegian and Barents seas
cover a large area of the shelf and continental slope off Norway, while the UK
also has production from the Irish Sea
and the Atlantic shelf west of the Shetland Islands. Ireland has gas production
off its southeast coast and developments
happening off its environmentally
challenging western coast. This Atlantic
basin is underexplored but contains a
number of proven and emerging play
types with potential for field developments in 500 to 2,500 m of water.
One key fact now differentiates the
NWECS from other offshore producing
regions—offshore oil and gas production is growing across the world but
declining in Western Europe. This is
due to a lack of major new oil and gas
prospects in the North Sea, which is
presently responsible for the bulk of the
region’s production.
Offshore oil production in the
NWECS region as a whole peaked at 6.4
million b/d in 2000, but the natural
gas production peak of perhaps 232
billion cu m is unlikely to occur before
2010-12 (Figs. 1 and 2).
For Europe, a future of declining
natural gas production from its offshore
waters equates to increasing dependence on Russian and North African gas
and raises considerable issues regarding
security of future energy supply.
The fragility of the situation has been
demonstrated when, in order to force
former Soviet countries to pay more realistic prices, Russia’s Gazprom on Jan.
1, 2006, reduced gas supplies to the
Ukraine and on Jan. 1, 2007, doubled
the gas price to Belarus and Georgia.
Then, on Jan. 8, 2007, in another price
row Russia temporarily halted oil exports via Belarus.
The relevant giant gas pipelines are
the same ones that feed Western Europe,
and so does oil via Belarus. The result
was political panic in capitals from Berlin to London. With 16% of the world’s
natural gas reserves, Gazprom, in the
words of London’s Financial Times, is
now “a giant aware of its power.”
But off Europe, exploration and
development continues, and despite

UK oil production peaked in 1999 at
2.8 million b/d and has since declined
to below 1.5 million b/d. Annual gas
production peaked in 2001 at 108
bcm/year and by 2006 had declined to
84 bcm/year.
As natural gas is a primary fuel for
power generation, this has caused major
concerns--and the fact this long-forecast
situation seemed to have caught politicians by surprise is in itself remarkable.
However, the past two winters were
relatively mild, moderating gas demand.
Then on Oct. 1, 2006, the 1,200-km
Langeled subsea gas pipeline from
Norway to the UK was opened—quite
literally Norwegian gas saved Britain’s
bacon and now boils its tea.
Offshore UK still has considerable numbers of small prospects to be
drilled and small discoveries awaiting development, many suited to the
smaller oil and gas companies that now
dominate the offshore scene. According
to the industry group “Oil & Gas UK,”
since 1999 more than 30 new companies have entered the UK continental
shelf with a commitment to invest in
oil and gas assets. These companies now
account for 38% of the industry’s total
investment and 16% of production.
The emphasis is now firmly on
developing the many small fields, but
the current high costs of drilling and
development is causing projects to be
delayed. The negative impact of this
cocktail of large costs and small plays
was recently emphasized by Shell’s
decision to sell some North Sea assets
and scrap plans for a new £25 million
headquarters in Aberdeen.
According to the industry group
Oil & Gas UK, the average capital cost
for a North Sea project begun in 2005
was about $8/bbl, with opex at $7. In
2007, capex is $15, opex $10. So with

$70 oil on the face of it a high profit
situation exists. However, about 45% of
production is natural gas, whose price
has slumped since the new Norwegian
supplies came on line.
Historically, the UK has adapted its
tax regime to changing times, but it is
now in need of realignment to modern
realities. To keep the show on the road,
the new Prime Minister Gordon Brown
needs to offer better fiscal incentives to
E&P companies. Talks between the industry and the UK Treasury are ongoing.
Examples of current UK offshore
field development projects include:
The Laggan discovery in the UK’s
West of Shetland waters holds about 1
tcf of gas and lies in 640 m of water

with a subsea development the most
likely scheme. Total E&P UK PLC and
partners are assessing the viability of
building a new pipeline from Laggan
directly to the St. Fergus gas terminal in
Scotland.
The first of three planned appraisal
wells was successful at nearby Rosebank/Lochnagar and could aid the
development economics of the project
(OGJ Online, July 19, 2007). Small
fields such as Torridon, Laxford, and
Victory could also be linked to Laggan’s
infrastructure (Fig. 3).

is an important gas discovery in 700 m

2000. Torridon is possibly a floating
production candidate, but there is no
nearby infrastructure. Alternatively, it
could also be tied back to Laggan.
Rosebank/Lochnagar is a large
deepwater discovery currently being
appraised. The field could contain 450
million to 500 million bbl of oil, making it one of the largest discoveries off
Northwest Europe.
A major 2D-offset seismic shoot over
Rosebank/Lochnagar is also planned.
Chevron owns 40% of the equity in
the field along with fellow stakeholders Norway’s Statoil with 30%, Austria’s
OMV, with 20% and Denmark’s DONG
with 10%.

Block 22/2a, is being developed via

Chestnut was discovered in 1986 and

The situation
In 2005, Hydro had identified
its K-13 well as being at risk
for calcium carbonate scaling
in the upper tubing, particularly
around the downhole safety
valve. Scaling could lead to valve
failure, resulting in several
months’ shut-in while waiting
for a floating rig or intervention vessel
to perform an acid job. Under such circumstances, lost revenue could amount to
$22,000,000 per month, including associated
rig costs to perform the acid job.

Offshore Norway:

Scale squeeze for Hydro
sets world record for
volume of produced water
protected against scaling
The solution and results
After conferring with M-I SWACO* PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGIES*
specialists, Hydro personnel decided to treat the well before the
downhole safety valve failed. The beneficial effects of a typical
squeeze treatment last for approximately six months, meaning that
the Oseberg South well would need to be squeezed twice per year.
The M-I SWACO team faced considerable technical challenges, and
used the water-injection flowline to pump the squeeze package. As soon
as the line volume of water had been displaced into an injector well, and the
inhibitor front was at the end of the line, an ROV transferred the line from the
injector to the producer. Given the cost of performing a job of this complexity,
a relatively large volume of scale inhibitor was pumped into the near-wellbore
region to a depth of 33 to 49 ft (10 to 15 m).
To date, the M-I SWACO treatment has lasted more than 26 months and
has protected more than 13 million barrels of water — a new world record
with significant cost savings to the field.

Skarv field is thought to contain up
to 500 million boe. BP has submitted
a development plan for the field that
includes a floating production unit
with gas exported via an 80-km export

Idun field will be developed in conjunction with Skarv, and other surrounding
finds may also be tied back to the FPSO
in due course, including the overlying
Snadd (gas) and Grasel (condensate)
structures.
Statoil’s Gudrun structure is estimated to hold at least 150 million boe.
According to Statoil, Gudrun could be
developed either using a platform or as
a subsea solution, with output transported to a Norwegian or UK installation for further processing and export.

The field is on Block 025, about 40 km
north of Sleipner and 13 km east of the

The Tyrihans complex is made up
of Tyrihans North and Tyrihans South
fields in more than 250 m of water.
Tyrihans South, an oil field with a gas
cap, was proven in 1983. Tyrihans
North, a gas-condensate field with a
thin oil zone, was proven in 1984.
Stolt Offshore was awarded a contract worth more than $83 million to
lay two pipelines from the field to the
Kristin platform. FMC was awarded a
$216 million subsea contract which
includes the supply of 13 subsea trees
and five templates with manifolds, one
of which will be used for seawater
injection. Deliveries will take place in
2007 and 2008. Aker Kvaerner won a
contract to provide subsea pumps for
$32 million. Production is due to commence in 2009.

Technologies
The North Sea with its challenging
environment was once the leading edge
of offshore oil and gas and, encouraged
by governments and driven by need,
considerable funds were invested in
new technologies to enable its development. This resulted in some successful commercial products and services,
many of which are being applied
worldwide.
Subsea processing is an area which
in 2000 was seen as a niche sector of
the market, with a small number of experts and evangelists driving the use of
the technology forward. However, the
change since then has been dramatic.
Now, subsea processing is being
considered as an option by the majority
of the larger oil companies on many of
their new field development prospects
and as an option to retrofit to existing fields. Even some of the smaller oil
companies are now considering subsea
processing.

Special Report

The second edition of the DouglasWestwood/OTM study, “The Subsea
Processing Gamechanger Report 20062015,” surveyed more than 30 leading subsea experts from oil companies
around the world and forecast that if
operators’ performance expectations are
met then over the next decade expenditure on subsea processing could in
the ‘most likely’ scenario exceed $3.4
billion.
In the North Sea, the Norwegian
sector is seeing some major subsea processing projects moving forward such
as Tyrihans, Tordis, and Asgard, which
will involve the use of various technologies including raw seawater injection,
subsea separation, multiphase boosting,
and subsea wet gas compression.
Multiphase metering is an associated enabling technology that has been
successfully taken subsea by Western
European companies such as Roxar and
Framo. The application of such meters
on a “one-per-well” basis is likely to become increasingly common as operators
recognize the value in the detail and accuracy of data that these systems provide.
In another European success story,
the FPSO business has seen the development and adoption of cylindrical units
move ahead with the first Sevan Marine
SSP-300 platform installed at Piranema
field off Brazil and second heading for
Chestnut field in the UK North Sea.
Overall, the floating production sector
is in fine health, with a total of $38
billion forecast to be spent worldwide
in the next 5 years, according to the

BP is involved in two major gas
projects in Algeria, Africa’s secondlargest country by area, in partnership
with Sonatrach and Statoil ASA: In
Salah gas in the southern Sahara, and
In Amenas, in the Illizi basin of southeastern Algeria, near Libya. BP Algeria
is also exploring three areas awarded in
Algeria’s sixth international licensing
round, April 2005:
• Hassi Matmat in the Benoud
(Oued Mya) basin, adjacent to giant
Hassi R’Mel gas field (OGJ Online, June
23, 2006).
• South East Illizi and Bourarhat
South, in the Illizi basin, adjacent to the
In Amenas project (OGJ, Apr. 25, 2005,
p. 50).
In 2003, BP Algeria’s then-President and CEO David Nagel said BP was
working in Algeria because the country
has the resources (9.2 billion bbl oil
reserves, roughly equaling Norway
and twice as much as Angola); it’s well
positioned (second largest supplier of
gas to Europe and a leading exporter of
gas to the US); and it has a “world-class
oil and gas infrastructure” (extensive

pipeline system, distribution, gasification, LNG facilities).1
BP Algeria Drilling Manager Lina
M. Serpa told OGJ that Rig 211 will
start operating in the Bourarhet South
exploration blocks acquired by BP in
the 6th licensing round. “The wells to
be drilled will test important exploration concepts, which, if successful,
will impact follow-on activities in the
block and surrounding areas.
Our current priority is preparing to
safely execute the
first well” and to
optimize additional
drilling options.
BP’s Algerian management team also
includes Jens Pace, exploration director,
and Gerry Peerebom, head of country
based in Algiers.
KCA Deutag worked in Algeria from
1994-2001 for Anadarko, BHP, CEPSA,

(Fig. 4).
The substructure is a “swing-up”
type, measuring 35 ft to the top of rotary table and 30 ft to the underside of
the rotary beams. It has a setback load
of 600,000 lb.
Bentec designs and manufactures
drilling and workover rigs and mechanical and electrical rig components
at its headquarters in Bad Bentheim and
a nearby yard in Nordhorn, Germany.
Bentec builds about eight complete
rigs/year. In 2005-06, it built SCR units
and mud systems for four rigs sent to
Algeria by the European Drilling Rig Alliance (OGJ, Aug. 14, 2006, p. 39).
A second Nomad Class rig, T-212,
will be completed in September. ✦

which included 45 projects, Statoil says.
Bjørn Nysted, acting project manager, says the new module was required
because a revamp of the existing control
room to current requirements would
have been difficult and the old kitchen
was in poor condition.
The new module has a new, modern
kitchen, and consequently, Snorre A can
accommodate more people and avoid
expensive flotels that are not readily
available, according to Nysted.
With 48 new cabins in the new
module, Snorre A now has a total of
268 cabins to accommodate personnel.

and the relatively low coabsorption of
hydrocarbons.

Problems
Shell Canada’s Burnt Timber plant
was originally designed to process sour
gas with Sulfinol-D with two separate
treating units: Plant 1 was built in 1970
with a capacity of 65 MMscfd and Plant
2 was built in 1976 with a capacity of
71 MMscfd.
The Sulfinol-D removed essentially
all of the H2S and CO2 along with trace
sulfur compounds such as COS and
mercaptans. Acid gas from each treating
united is routed to a dedicated sulfurrecovery unit.
Plant 1 has a two-stage Claus followed by a Superclaus, while Plant 2
has a three-stage Claus unit.
The plant’s license requires a current
overall sulfur-recovery efficiency of
96.5%. The original feed to the plant
came from Burnt Timber and Panther
fields, had a low condensate-to-gas
ratio, and contained about 12% H2S and
7% CO2. The acid-gas stream going to
the sulfur-recovery units was more than
60% H2S and contained 1.3% to 2.5%
hydrocarbons on a methane-equivalent
basis. About half

difficult. The sulfur plant usually limited
overall plant throughput.
The second problem with the hydrocarbons was the production of CS2
in the reaction furnace. Levels of CS2 as
high as 1.25 % in the feed to the first
Claus stage were measured. Hydrolysis
rates of 90% of the CS2 in the first bed
were achievable with new catalyst, but
the remaining CS2 still had a significant
impact on the overall sulfur recovery.
The third problem with the hydrocarbon was that it was not all completely combusted in the reaction furnace.
The residence time of 0.5 sec with a
reaction furnace temperature of 1,100°
C. resulted in breakthrough of benzene
to the first converter bed. This benzene
cracks in the converter bed resulting in
soot deposition on the Claus catalyst.
Sooting of the bed reduced catalyst activity and resulted in increased pressure
drop, reducing recovery efficiency and
capacity.
Catalyst in the first bed of Sulfur
Plant 2 was being changed every 6 to 9
months resulting in excessive operating
costs and lost production.
The CO2 in the acid gas was less of
a problem than the hydrocarbons but
did exacerbate the previously outlined
problems. The inert CO2 increases the
pressure drop through the unit and
hence backs the blowers up on their operating curves. The CO2 in the acid-gas
feed results in production of COS in the
reaction furnace, reducing the overall
sulfur recovery. Finally, the CO2 reduces
the reaction furnace’s flame temperature, increasing the breakthrough of
benzene to the first reactor bed.
The two main fields connected to the
Burnt Timber facility have different gas
compositions and different production
profiles. The Burnt Timber field has H2S
and CO2 contents of 10.2% and 6.4%,
respectively. The Panther field on the
other hand has H2S and CO2 contents of
7.0% and 11.5%, respectively.
With the Burnt Timber field in decline and additional drilling in the Panther field, the forecast composition for
the plant inlet was that the H2S content
would decline while the CO2 content

The C-suite is a long way from B-school, which probably explains why so many
of your peers have forgotten their lessons. They’re content to find “savings” by
nickel-and-diming the vendors whose costs make up the smallest parts of their
manufacturing pie. But when you work with Kennametal, we’ll show you ways
to reduce your entire manufacturing cost by enough to actually pay for the cost
of tooling. In fact, we guarantee it. Find out more at kennametal.com.

The lean-rich exchangers consisted
of the original shell and tube exchangers supplemented with a plate and
frame exchanger installed during debottlenecking. The regenerator column
contained 22 Shell HiFi calming-section
trays in the stripping section, and seven
calming-section trays in the refluxcooling section. An internal refluxcooling system, in which reflux water
is pumped around and cooled was
provided.
Two reboilers operating on 350
kPa(g) steam provide the duty for
stripping. A booster pump downstream
of the lean-rich exchangers provides
enough pressure to flow the Sulfinol
through the lean-solvent cooler, solvent
filter, and to the fuel-gas absorber. The
charge pump supplies cooled Sulfinol to
the absorber.

could use a higher solvent/gas ratio

increase both CO2 and trace sulfur-removal rates.
The results of the study indicated
that conversion of Plant 2 was technically possible. The economics of the
project, based on increased capacity,
higher sales-gas heating value, and improved sulfur-plant performance were
favorable.

Original conﬁguration
The original plant configuration was
of a typical Sulfinol unit (Fig. 1).
The absorber column contained 29
conventional two-pass trays and operated at a pressure of 5,800 kPa(g). Lean
Sulfinol was supplied at 40° C. and the
main charge pumps were capable of
supplying 227 cu m/hr. Flash gases
from the rich Sulfinol flash drum were
treated in a flash-gas absorber.

The initial project study was based
on equipment capacities that had been
identified in a performance test conducted in 1999. There was a desire to
use as much existing equipment as possible while ensuring that it was in good
shape. In addition, Shell Canada wanted
to incorporate its experience with operation of two existing MDEA units to
ensure long trouble-free operation.
The company passed the process
design developed by Shell Global Solutions to Millenia Resource for detailed
design and construction.

Solvent pumps; absorber
Both booster pumps and charge
pumps had nearly the maximum impellers installed, and Shell Canada decided
to use the existing pumps without
modifications. Additional solvent flow
would not improve capacity because
other equipment limits would restrict
capacity first. The design was advanced
with the booster pump flow of 259 cu
m/hr and a charge pump flow of 227
cu m/hr.
The most complex part of the modifications was in the absorber tower. Its
design had to account for the change

in the H2S/CO2 ratio in the feed gas
over time. Slip of up to 4% CO2 in the
treated gas was desired while achieving
no more than 8 ppm (vol) of H2S.
Because the process design was to
use kinetic selectivity to obtain the desired slip, a weir height of 50 mm was
selected for design. Calculations indicated that 22 trays would be required to
obtain 2% CO2 in the treated gas for the
composition expected in 2020, while
14 trays would achieve less than 8 ppm
(vol) H2S for all gas compositions.
The uncertainty in gas composition
and the parameters required for calculations involving kinetic slip prompted a
decision to provide the absorber with
multiple liquid feeds. Although this
would require addition of nozzles on
the existing absorber, it would also
provide the flexibility to handle most of
the uncertainties.
Feed locations at tray Nos. 12, 14,
16, and 22 were selected. The tower
would be retrayed from the top down,

so that the new Tray 22 would be in the
same location as old Tray 29 and would
use the existing feed nozzle.
The space for the new feed nozzles
would be created by omitting the tray
that was in that position. The new Tray
1 would end up where the existing
Tray 5 was, providing more room in
the absorber sump. The normal liquid
level in the sump would be increased
to provide more residence time for gas
de-entrainment.
As previously pointed out, the existing absorber had conventional two-pass
trays installed for the Sulfinol service.
When swapping to MDEA it is generally
recognized that the system foam factor
will increase.
In addition, Shell tray design parameters for MDEA are more conservative
than parameters for Sulfinol systems.
When the hydraulic calculations were
made for the existing trays in MDEA
service, many of the design parameters

exceeded acceptable values. A switch to
Shell HiFi calming-section trays provided a tray design that would meet the
more stringent design conditions for
the MDEA solvent.
Shell Canada’s experience with the
MDEA units at Caroline prompted a
review of the materials of construction.
The expected maximum rich MDEA
loading of 0.80 mole/mole resulted in
the recommendation that the bottom
section of the absorber be strip lined
with stainless steel.
Materials engineers felt that strip lining from Tray 6 down would eliminate
any problems with corrosion associated
with rich loading of MDEA now and in
the future.

Flash drum, absorber
The existing flash drum had hydrogen blistering and was showing signs
of corrosion, particularly along the
gas-liquid interface. It was decided to
replace the existing flash drum with a

stainless steel vessel to provide 5 min of
liquid residence time.
An integral flash-gas absorber also
of stainless steel was added to the top
of the flash drum. It was only 457 mm
in diameter compared to the original
diameter of 610 mm. Given the new
smaller diameter, the column was
packed with 5 m of No. 2 Cascade mini
rings.
The reduction in size reflects the expected decrease in the amount of flash
gas. The MDEA solution was expected
to have about one third of the dissolved
hydrocarbons compared to Sulfinol,
and the additional residence time in the
sump of the absorber was expected to
reduce the entrained gas level.

strip lined with stainless steel.
The two existing regenerator reboilers have a design duty of 12,600 kw,
with the required new duty being
13,100 kw. Because performance testing indicated that the reboilers had operated at 13,000 kw previously, reboiler
duty was not considered a bottleneck
for the design case.
Total plant throughput might be

limited in the future by the ultimate
reboiler duty achievable. Metallurgy was
upgraded on the reboiler feeds, overheads, and liquid returns. The reboiler

a previous turnaround and the exiting
reboiler bundles were stainless steel.

Lean-rich exchangers
The new design duty for the leanrich exchangers of 6,675 kw was
provided by two 100% plate and frame
exchangers. The clean duty of each
exchanger was about 8,000 kw.
The exchangers were configured
for both series and parallel operation
to allow for cleaning one unit without
a drop in throughput and for tighter
temperature approach with the exchangers in series. The pressure profile
on the lean side was controlling, as sufficient head was required at the solvent
booster pump.

Regenerator; reboilers
The stripping section of the regenerator was previously fitted with 22
Shell HiFi calming-section trays, high
capacity trays with limited scope for debottlenecking. The column was re-rated
to account for the increased foaming
tendency of MDEA relative to Sulfinol.
Although some of the design parameters were higher than desirable for a
new design, they fell within acceptable
limits for retrofit applications. Shell
Canada felt that the regenerator flooding might become the new plant limit,
but that would depend on the capacity
limit of the regenerator reboilers. The
inlet feed nozzle and the rich-feed zone,
one tray above and one tray below the
inlet nozzle of the regenerator, were

before the MDEA conversion also help
to keep the solution clean. All these factors have resulted in a relatively troublefree amine system with few foaming
incidents.
The CO2 slip has also increased the
acid-gas quality to as high as 70% H2S
from 58%, depending upon inlet-gas
composition. The hydrocarbon content
has dropped from greater than 2.5% to
less than 1% on a methane-equivalent
basis. As a result the COS content in the
feed to the first Claus stage has dropped
from as high as 1.25% to about 0.23%.
The lower hydrocarbon content in
the acid gas has resulted in decreased
sooting of the first Claus bed leading to
longer bed life and increased CS2 and
COS hydrolysis. The total reduced sulfur
(TRS) emitted to atmosphere from the
incinerator stack has also decreased
dramatically.
The COS and CS2 concentrations in
the stack have dropped to 50 and 16
ppm (vol), respectively, from about
130 and 200 ppm (vol). The total TRS
concentration has dropped to 100 ppm
(vol) from 600 ppm (vol). These improvements have resulted in an increase
in sulfur recovery in Plant 2 to 96.9%
from 95%.
One concern in converting from Sulfinol to MDEA was the removal of trace
sulfur compounds. The design calculations indicated COS and mercaptan removals of 28% and 37%, respectively. A
test on Oct. 13, 2006, with feed to Tray
14 indicated actual COS and mercaptan
removals of 26% and 47%, respectively,
with H2S in the treated gas of 2.7 ppm
(vol).
Testing of Plant 1, operating on Sulfinol, showed removal of COS and mercaptans of 85% and 80%, respectively,
and 1.3 ppm (vol) of H2S in the treated
gas. The inlet gas at the time contained
112 mg/std. cu m of trace sulfur compounds compared to the design value
of 117 mg/std. cu m. Under these
conditions, the total sulfur content of
the combined sales-gas stream was 59
mg/std. cu m, easily meeting the specification of 115 mg/std. cu m.
Unfortunately, a subsequent test on
64

Oct. 25 showed COS and mercaptan removal rates of 8% and 15%, respectively, with an inlet gas trace sulfur content
of 199 mg/std. cu m. The total sulfur
content of the combined sales-gas
stream was measured at 141 mg/std. cu
m. This problem is being investigated
by technical staff.
It was determined that field activities related to sulfur-solvent washes of
production tubing resulted in the high
levels of trace sulfur compounds in the
inlet gas. Operational plans are being
put in place to limit the concentration
of mercaptans in the feed gas during
these field activities. ✦

and sabotage. Since its
installation in January 2007, the system
has operated without failure.
PGPB is the division
of the Mexican national
oil and gas company
that transports gases
and basic petrochemicals across the country. PGPB manages its
network of pipelines
from a control center in Mexico City
and has a large portion of the pipeline
integrated into its supervisory control
and data acquisition system.
PGPB, however, has never before
acquired information about the operational conditions of its pipelines transporting basic petrochemicals, propane,
ethane, and methane among its process-

ing centers, a network of roughly 600
km.
This article documents PGPB’s search
for sensor technology that would monitor and properly manage its pipeline
network (Fig. 1) and provide rapid
access to remote data such as gas pressures from sectioning and transport
valves across the network. PGPB wanted
operators in the control room, processing centers, and process final destinations to be able to provide operational
alarms and monitor the status and operating conditions of the pipeline as well
as monitor real-time pressure trends
with a high degree of confidence.
PGPB also wanted the system to
detect anomalies caused by sabotage or
theft, which have proven highly dangerous. Finally, the new technology was to
provide a balance system for transport
schedules (sent and received) as agreed
between the processing centers.
PEMEX evaluated both wired and
wireless solutions for this project, concluding that a wireless solution provided a better business case based on the

the network can also direct commands
to a particular remote station. This will
prove particularly useful in the second
phase of this project, planned for later
in 2007 and scheduled to cover control
of solenoid valves for security sectioning in case of leaks or anomalies that
have caused HSE incidents in the past.

Network management
Besides operating the pipeline network, the system provides diagnostic
information to facilitate operations and
guarantee data integrity. Each transmitted message from the wireless sensor
includes a battery voltage reflecting the
real voltage of the battery pack providing power to the wireless sensor.
This register will provide PGPB
operations the advantage of planning
maintenance trips to sites with low-battery levels, pursuing maintenance issues
proactively rather than waiting for the
sensor to stop reporting.
Diagnostic data allow PGPB close
monitoring and configuration of its
network—including sensor status at
the remote stations—without the need
to visit sites personally to make minor
changes. With more than 600 km of
pipeline to manage, frequent site visits
would be time consuming and cost
prohibitive for HSE purposes. ✦

March 3 – 5, 2008 / Moody Gardens Hotel & Convention Center, Galveston, Texas

SUBSEA TIEBACK
Forum & Exhibition

PennWell invites you back to the 8th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition.
SSTB has become the premier event for one of the fastest growing field
development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March 3 – 5, 2008 in
Galveston, TX at the Moody Gardens Hotel & Conference Center. Over 2,000
people and 150 exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference.You can’t
afford to miss it.
As our industry confronts new challenges, it has never been more important
to submerse yourself in them. This year’s theme is “Subsea is here, the game
is changing.” As our game changes, the sharing of knowledge and collective
experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety,
and economics of the subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by
industry leaders. As in the past, only by participating in this conference will you
be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will not be published and no
Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room
stays inside the conference room. We hope you will join us.

New energy bills
ﬁll many pages,
raise many costs
People facing overhaul of fundamental
energy systems should read the legislation
that proposes to change their lives.
Here’s what you do: Go to http://thomas.
loc.gov. In the “Search Bill Text” ﬁeld, type
“HR 3221,” select “Bill Number,” then hit
“Search.” When you ﬁnish reading HR 3221,
repeat the steps for HR 2776.
It shouldn’t take more than—well, much
depends on reading speed.

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

HR 3221 ﬁlls 496 pages. It takes a lot of
words—161,662 of them, to be exact—for
a government to overhaul the energy-use
patterns of the US economy. All those incandescent light bulbs to replace. All those
tax favors to help promoters of uneconomic energy get rich.
HR 2776 is shorter. Its 56 pages and
16,479 words would hike taxes on the industry that produces and processes oil and
gas to raise money for various kinds of support for energy forms that House members
like better—expensive forms with limited
scope for raising total supply.
The apparent strategy: Discourage investment in economic energy able to boost
supply meaningfully, and stimulate investment in uneconomic energy with much
lower supply potential.
Anyone who thinks that sounds less
than sensible should remember all the
wonderful conservation measures the
House proposes, such as replacing cheap
light bulbs with expensive ones.
There’s a lot of substitution of the cheap
with the costly going on here. But that’s
okay to anyone who accepts a central
motivation behind all this: the ﬁght against
global warming, about which HR 3221 has
much to propose, all very expensive.
With global warming, of course, costs
aren’t supposed to matter. Bills that profess
to bring the Age of Petroleum to a premature end can claim to be ﬁghting global
warming.
But would HR 3221 and HR 2776 end the
Age of Petroleum? No. They might nibble
at demand and raise the energy-market
shares of nonfossil fuels by a few percentage points. They wouldn’t end the dominance of oil, gas, and coal, though. Mostly,
they’d make everything more expensive
than it is now.
So what’s the point? Somewhere amid
178,141 of words that would raid American
bank accounts, there really should be one.

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

Data vital to energy markets
Fear that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would undersupply
peak market demand for crude in July and August increased the price at which reﬁners were willing to draw down crude stocks and inﬂated oil prices in June and July,
the International Energy Agency in Paris said in its Aug. 10 monthly report.
Therefore, said IEA analysts, prices remain high and crude futures markets “have
been toying with backwardation”—in which futures prices for near-month contracts
exceed those of farther-out months—despite high levels of crude stocks among
countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development at the end
of June. The September contract for US light, sweet crudes closed at a record high of
$78.21/bbl July 31. By Aug. 10, it closed at $71.47/bbl.
Data problems
However, IEA complained: “With the limited hard data to hand, there is still a
wide margin for interpretation of current and future fundamentals. We have weekly
data for the US and Japan, but to get a preliminary picture of the OECD takes 6
weeks.” Outside the OECD, it said, “there is still very little information on stock levels.”
Although some countries are struggling to establish data collection systems,
most are monitoring stock levels at ports, loading terminals, and reﬁneries. “Many
(if not most) companies probably have the ability to report these data on a real-time
basis. So why the lack of data?” IEA wondered.
IEA reported two common answers to that question. “Some non-OECD ofﬁcials
have indicated that several years of high prices have led the industry to run on
minimal stocks, and they worry that if they release this information, they might push
oil prices higher than they already are. That is the easiest issue to address: do not
worry—the market already implicitly assumes they are zero,” it said.
The second argument is that stock data are commercially sensitive. “That may
be the case, but keeping it secret has scarcely led to consumers paying less, and the
US and Japan show [timely reports] can be done. US regulations are generally very
responsive to industry’s needs, yet the comprehensive weekly data published by the
EIA demonstrate that commercial sensitivities can be overcome,” IEA said.
“This is not just about data coverage. It is also about the timeliness of data. In
the OECD, weekly European data are conspicuous by their absence (even China
and Russia industry publications provide some weekly data!). While there are some
genuine concerns in Europe about cost and quality of the trade data available, some
of the often-heard arguments against the publication of more frequent data fail to
see the bigger picture.”
Some statisticians claim data quality deteriorates if produced more frequently.
Others are more willing to accept less accurate but more timely information. IEA
said, “Weekly data are less accurate than monthly data; monthly data are less accurate than annual.” But data quality improves when collection is regular and subject
to continual assessment. “It is also wrong to interpret the focus on the US weekly
data as a sign that more timely data increase market volatility,” IEA said. “Experiences in other commodity markets show that it can have the opposite effect.”
IEA argues that more-comprehensive and more-frequent data improve market
understanding. If that knocks several hundredths of a cent off the price of each barrel
of traded oil, it would be more cost-effective than the current situation, where “uncertainties associated with a lack of data could bear a much higher cost,” IEA said.
Furthermore, the agency argued that traders’ usual focus on the high level of US
crude and petroleum stocks as evidence that the market is well supplied ignores the
low level of Japanese crude stocks and the average levels of European inventories.
In term of future demand, IEA said, “These stocks are below normal, and logic suggests they may be even lower from a global perspective. Our projections suggest
stocks will be drawn down further in August and September, yet when OPEC members come to assess the market at their Sept. 11 meeting, they will have to hand only
OECD data from June. If ever there was a compelling argument for the beneﬁts of
wider and more frequent stock data coverage, it is now.”
US inventories
US crude inventories fell 4.1 million bbl to 340.4 million bbl in the week ended
Aug. 3. Gasoline stocks dropped 1.7 million bbl to 203 million bbl. Distillate fuel
inventories rose 1 million bbl to 127.5 million bbl.

capabilities of our industry and will attract a broad collection of papers on topical
subjects related to both deepwater exploration and the complexities of arctic
exploration. At this year’s DOT, a special session on arctic technology will reflect
the growing importance of arctic exploration frontiers.
PennWell is committed to bringing DOT to the world’s most pertinent deepwater
markets. Norway is central to Arctic worldwide offshore E&P market and many
prominent players in the oilfield will gather for this most prestigious conference
and exhibition.
Plan on exhibiting, sponsoring and attending this event as DOT travels to Norway
for the latest in deep offshore technology.

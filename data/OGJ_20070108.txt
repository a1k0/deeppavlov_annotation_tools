Statoil discovers dry gas off eastern Venezuela
Anadarko to explore block off Mozambique
Anadarko Petroleum Corp. has signed a contract with Mozambique for exploration and production of a block in the Rovuma
basin in northeastern Mozambique.
Anadarko was awarded the 2.64 million-acre block, known as
Offshore Area 1, earlier this year in Mozambique’s second licensing round.
The block includes about 90,000 onshore acres and extends
offshore 35 miles eastward in water as deep as 6,000 ft. It borders
Tanzania to the north and extends southward about 100 miles.
Only two wells have been drilled in the area, said Bob Daniels,
Anadarko senior vice-president of worldwide exploration.
The contract commits Anadarko to a 5-year initial exploration
term, with options to extend that phase for 3 years, and permits a
30-year production term following any commercial discoveries.
Anadarko was awarded the block on the basis of a work commitment to acquire 2D and 3D seismic and drill seven wells during
the initial exploration term.
“Through our regional evaluation and analysis of existing seismic data covering most of the block,” Daniels said, “we have already identified multiple leads across an area equivalent in size to
460 typical Gulf of Mexico lease blocks.”
Anadarko will operate the block initially with a 100% working
interest.

Woodside has gas discovery in Libya
Woodside Energy (NA) Ltd., a subsidiary of Woodside Petroleum Ltd. and operator of the NC210 Block in the Murzuq basin
in Libya, has made a gas discovery with its C1-NC210 exploration
well on the block, said Repsol YPF, a joint venture partner.
The well, 1,000 km south of Tripoli and 150 km south of producing Al Wafa gas field, was drilled under an exploration and production-sharing agreement with National Oil Corp. Libya. TD is
808 m. Wireline logs indicate the potential for several hydrocarbon-bearing zones.
An initial production test of the Devonian Awaynat Wanin formation confirmed the presence of a gas column and flowed at 5.7
MMscfd through a 72⁄64-in. choke. Calculated absolute open flow is
10.7 MMscfd.

Aussie JV given nod to develop Woollybutt ﬁeld
A joint venture led by ENI Australia has been given the green
light to spend $180 million (Aus.) to develop the South Lobe section of Woollybutt oil field in the Carnarvon basin off Western
Australia.
The new project, in production license WA-25-L, involves connection of two horizontal wells (Woollybutt 4 and 6) to the existing leased floating production, storage, and offloading vessel Four
Vanguard via subsea pipeline.
Contracts have been secured for drilling and completion of the
two wells, modifications to the FPSO, subsea wellheads, flowlines,
manifolds, and control systems as well as installation and transport
of the necessary equipment.
The wells will be drilled in midyear, and first production from
the South Lobe is expected early in 2008.
The new development will boost oil production from the field
by about 10,000 b/d and will increase field life. The FPSO contract
runs until 2009, and there are optional extensions until 2013.
So far Woollybutt field has produced about 26.5 million bbl and
is currently flowing at 11,000 b/d.
ENI Australia has 65% interest, with Mobil Australia Resources
20% and Tap Oil Ltd. 15%. ✦

Production

Kvitebjørn ﬁeld production reduced in North Sea
Natural gas and oil production from Kvitebjørn field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea is being reduced by 50% for 5
months, effective Dec. 23, said operator Statoil ASA.
During that time, output will be reduced to 95,000 boe/d from
190,000 boe/d, in the interest of “sound reservoir management
and safe drilling operations” for wells remaining to be drilled,
based on reservoir conditions and available methods for drilling

Statoil ASA has found dry gas within three intervals drilled in its
Cocuina-2X exploration well on Block 4 of Plataforma Deltana, off
eastern Venezuela (OGJ, Sept. 4, 2006, Newsletter).
The well, 240 km from the Orinoco Delta, was drilled to 3,406
m TD. “The true potential of Block 4 cannot be confirmed until the
whole exploration program has been completed,” Statoil said.
Transocean Inc.’s Sovereign Explorer semisubmersible will now
proceed to the next well location, Ballena-1X, to drill in 350 m of
water. No well has been drilled in deeper water off Venezuela to
date, according to Statoil.
TheVenezuelan government awarded the Plataforma Deltana Block
4 license to Statoil in 2003. Statoil is operator with a 51% share, and
Total SA holds 49%. PDVSA Gas has the option to participate with up
to 35% once a commercial discovery has been declared.
Statoil is a partner, together with PDVSA and Total, in the extraheavy Sincor oil project in the Orinoco Belt.

in reservoirs with high pressure and high temperature. That would
amount to a net decrease of 15,000 boe/d in 2007 for Statoil, said
company officials.
Meanwhile, Statoil will meet commitments to gas customers by
increasing production from other fields.
Kvitebjørn has been on stream since fall of 2004. Located in
190 m of water, it was Statoil’s first high-pressure and high-temperature field and was expected to plateau in late 2005. However,

Aramco to cut ethane in petrochemical feeds
Saudi Aramco expects to reduce the proportion of ethane in petrochemical feedstock to 60% by the end of the decade, down from
100% during the 1980s, said Khalid A. Al-Falih, the company’s industrial relations senior vice-president.
Speaking during a Gulf Petrochemical and Chemical Association Forum in Dubai late last month, al-Falih discussed evolving
regional feedstock parameters.
Al-Falih said associated gas has an ethane content of 18-20%
while nonassociated gas has an ethane content of 4-6%. Saudi
Aramco’s incremental gas production capacity is not expected to

content by using propane and butane. Ethane accounted for 100%
of regional petrochemical feedstock from the 1980s through 1990,
he said. In 1992, Arabian Petrochemical Co. mixed propane with
ethane as a cracker feedstock.

One will extend between Grissik in South Sumatra and Rawa
Maju in West Java, while the other will join Pagardewa in South
Sumatra and Cilegon in Banten. The two lines, spanning 1,106 km,
will be able to transport 950 MMscfd of gas.
Indonesia has come under pressure to accelerate development
of the country’s gas infrastructure.
In October, the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry
(Kadin) asked the government to draw up a policy to accelerate development to ensure domestic gas supply to meet rising demand.
“Gas distribution infrastructure which has already been planned
should be built soon,” said Gito Ganindito, Kadin deputy chairman
for mining affairs, responding to reports on the sluggish construction of Indonesia’s gas infrastructure and its shortages of gas for
the domestic market.

Saipem to expand Dampier-Bunbury pipeline
Saipem SPA has received a $328.6 million contract from the
DBP Group to expand the Dampier-Bunbury pipeline in Western
Australia by first quarter 2008. The contract signals further capital expenditure in electric power generation and value-added processing in southwestern Western Australia (OGJ Online, Feb. 21,
2006).
Saipem will design, install, and precommission 570 km of nominal bore pipeline and associated facilities. Construction will occur
alongside half the existing mainline, Saipem said. The proposed
Stage 5A expansion will handle an extra 100 TJ/day of natural gas.
Saipem originally built the Dampier-to-Bunbury pipeline in the
1980s.
In September, DBP Group said the timing of Stages 5B and 5C
depends on a range of issues, including the price and availability
of gas to support new resource processing and power generation
developments.

PGN solicits bids for Riau-North Sumatra gas line
Indonesia’s state-owned gas distributor PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (PGN) plans to invite bids for construction of a $600 million,
360-km gas pipeline to link Riau and North Sumatra.
The pipeline, which will carry 200-300 MMscf of gas from
Duri, in Riau, to Medan, in North Sumatra, is expected to come on
stream by yearend 2007.
PGN Pres. Sutikno said the projected pipeline would connect

China begins receiving oil via Mekong River
China has begun receiving oil shipments from Thailand via the
Mekong River, marking the start of an experimental program announced earlier this year (OGJ, Apr. 10, 2006, p. 28).
Two ships, each carrying 150 tonnes of oil, arrived in southwest China’s Yunnan Province on the Mekong River, which is being
viewed as an alternative to the Strait of Malacca as a regular route
for shipping oil to China.
China in March signed an agreement with Laos, Myanmar, and
Thailand on shipping oil on the waterway, with an initial shipping
quota of 1,200 tonnes/month.
But the three Southeast Asian nations later agreed to raise the
quota after China set up an emergency response team to ensure the
safety of the shipments.
Experts said as much as 200,000 tonnes of oil would be shipped
to Yunnan via the Mekong when the quota was scrapped and the
transportation cost was about $25/tonne less than for shipping
by land.
Because of the increased quota, Qiao Xinmin, chief of the Yunnan provincial maritime affairs bureau, said China would ship
about 70,000 tonnes/year of oil from Thailand alone via the river.
According to Qiao, more than 20 experts from China, Laos,
Myanmar, and Thailand are checking ports and oil shipping facilities along the river, studying the feasibility of shipping even larger
volumes of oil. ✦

For The True Industry Pulse,
You Shouldn’t Miss This Webcast!
Oil & Gas Journal’s Annual Forecast and Review
From Oil & Gas Journal - The Industry Authority for more than a century

OGJ Editor, Bob Tippee
January 25, 2007
1:30 pm CST
Register free at:
www.ogjonline.com
(webcast section)

The webcast will be based on the annual Forecast and Review special report appearing
this year in the January 15 issue of Oil & Gas Journal. The Forecast and Review projects
oil and gas demand worldwide and in the US for the new year. The US forecast
analyzes demand by petroleum product (such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and so forth).
As the name implies, the report compares the forecast with estimates for actual
numbers for the prior year. In addition to oil and gas markets, the Forecast and Review
includes a forecast for US and Canadian drilling activity.
The format for the webcast will include predictions made at this time last year for 2006.
Bob Tippee, Editor, will make the presentation. If schedules permit, Marilyn Radler,
Senior Editor-Economics, and G. Alan Petzet, Chief Editor-Exploration, will be on hand
for questions. Marilyn assembles the numbers and writes copy for the supply-demand
portions of the Forecast and Review. Alan does the drilling forecast.

EOR awaits new CO2 sources

Guntis Moritis
Production Editor
Field examples continue to show the
value of carbon dioxide injection for
enhancing oil production.
The Permian basin of West Texas and
Eastern New Mexico remains the most
active area, but this technology has
potential for other regions of the world,
as noted at last December’s annual CO2
flooding conference in Midland, Tex.
The conference was the 12th held
and with about 350 attending, the largest in attendance to date. Over the years,
attendance at the conference has fluctuated, largely reflecting oil price swings.
In the last 4 years, the CO2 conference has added a carbon management
workshop, with the last one held in
Houston prior to the Midland venue.
The heightened worldwide interest
in managing carbon emissions with
geologic storage of CO2 may provide
the industry new incentives for converting this waste product into a valuable
asset for recovering additional oil from
mature reservoirs.
The Society of Petroleum EngineersPermian Basin Section and University of
Texas of the Permian Basin were two of
the conference sponsors.

Flood examples
Although CO2 EOR is a proven technology, the process requires extensive
engineering and usually involves a

phased development as well as close
monitoring and multiple adjustments
during a flood’s life.
The Denver Unit in Wasson field in
West Texas is a prime example of a CO2
flood that continues to evolve. Wasson,
discovered in 1935, held an estimated
4 billion bbl of oil initially in place and
produces primarily from a 300-ft thick
San Andres carbonate.
Prior to the formation of a waterflood unit in 1964, primary oil production from the wells in the unit area
peaked at about 50,000 b/d in 1946.
Waterflooding led to a new peak oil
production plateau of about 150,000
b/d from 1972-80 prior to the onset of
a production decline.
To arrest the decline, Shell Oil Co.,
then operator of the unit, in 1984
initiated CO2 injection in the eastern
part of the unit. Unlike waterflooding,
CO2 injection did not create another
peak but did lower the decline rate. The
initial response to CO2 injection leveled
the production to 35,000-40,000 b/d.
Occidental Permian Ltd. now operates
the unit, which currently produces
about 29,000 bo/d attributed to CO2
injection.
Maintaining these production levels
required the unit to undergo various
changes as more was learned about the
process, according to a presentation
at the Midland conference. Changes
included:
• Changing the continuous CO2
injection in the eastern part to wateralternating-gas (WAG) injection and
expanding the CO2 injection to the
western and central part of the unit in
1989.
• Stopping CO2 injection in the

southern part of the unit and in nonperforming patterns in the central area
in 1992.
• Revising the approved CO2 slug
sizes in the eastern area to 60% from
40% hydrocarbon pore volume in
1994, to 80% in 1996, and to 100% in
2001. The increases in slug size allow
CO2 to enter more portions of the moderate and low-permeability layers.
• Changing from an inverted ninespot pattern in the eastern area to a
semi-infill line drive in 1996.
• Developing the transition zone in
the eastern area in 1996.
• Continuing to optimize the chase
water volumes and WAGs based on pattern maturity.

Other areas
Outside the Permian basin some other CO2 EOR activity includes Denbury
Resources Inc. expanding CO2 EOR to
new fields in Mississippi, Anadarko Petroleum Corp. continuing phased development of CO2 injection in Salt Creek
field in Wyoming, and Apache Canada
Ltd. evaluating pilot projects that inject
acid gas in previously waterflooded pinnacle reefs in Alberta. A project is also
slated for Croatia.
The North Sea is another area with
potential projects. BP PLC has proposed
a CO2 EOR project in Miller field, off
UK, and Shell and Statoil ASA have announced a feasibility study on Draugen
field, off Norway. Both these North Sea
projects would use CO2 from newly
built onshore power plants.
New CO2 sources are vital for expanding CO2 EOR. Even the expansion
of projects in the Permian basin is limited by constraints in CO2 supply. ✦

The role of business
Fad words come and go in business, usually
without hurting anything but communication.
A specimen now in circulation, however, is more
insidious than most.
The culprit is “stakeholder,” of which corporations now have many, which is as precise as anyone
can be where stakeholders are concerned. The word
encompasses all people who might be affected by
a corporation’s actions: employees, neighbors, customers, contractors, suppliers, breathers of air and
drinkers of water downstream of its waste outlets,
environmental activists, human rights advocates,
and anyone else willing to claim a “stake,” loosely
defined. Some corporate managers seem to adore the
word, which implies social relevance. They send out
“Dear stakeholder” letters.

responsibility” by a business executive can amount
to the imposition of taxes and to decision-making
by an unelected agent of how to spend the proceeds. This occurs, he reasoned, when the executive’s actions reduce returns, raise prices, or lower
wages on behalf of social goals that stockholders,
customers, or employees could pursue on their
own but on which they would spend their own
money differently. Friedman, a champion of market freedom, considered such activity by business
people ineffective and politically unacceptable.
“The doctrine of ‘social responsibility,’” he wrote,
“involves the acceptance of the socialist view that
political mechanisms, not market mechanisms, are
the appropriate way to determine the allocation of
scarce resources to alternative uses.”

but it stimulated both of its US senators to become vocal
supporters where they’d previously been ambivalent,” Fry
said. “This showed us the importance of working even in
noncoastal states such as Utah or Tennessee in getting legislatures to pass resolutions of support. In other coastal states,
we’ve tried to build coalitions with chemical and other
manufacturers to promote similar actions.”

‘Signal for future’
Petty sees the comprehensive energy strategy bill—which
includes possible OCS activity off Virginia—that the state’s
legislature passed in 2006 and Gov. Timothy M. Kaine signed
into law, as “a signal for the future, at least for the eastern
seaboard states.”
Petty thinks Georgia and South Carolina are likelier to
consider similar steps than Florida, which the IADC official
considers closer to California in its attitude toward offshore
oil and gas activity. But he also said that some Floridians
might press for change if Cuba exercises its sovereign rights
and starts exploring and developing resources off its coast,
particularly if it’s with financial assistance from China.
Petty also anticipates that foreign energy confrontations,
such as that of Belarus and Russia’s OAO Gazprom, will have
an increasing US impact if Europe and other consuming

aggressively for other supplies.
“The world outside the US will increasingly drive domestic oil and gas issues. There’s no way to stop it,” Petty said.
Whitsitt conceded that the Senate, with its more deliberate approach in which 60 votes are still needed to stop a
filibuster, probably would stop more radical proposals that
may pass the House.
“But just because there’s that institutional ability, I think
it’s incumbent to not look simplistically at energy issues,”
Whitsitt said. “I think we need to be focused on energy
policy questions from the beginning, whether it’s in the
Senate, the House, or the administration. We need to keep
talking about things that matter to domestic producers and

suggest that the Azadegan project,
which is scheduled to add 125,000 b/d

contract. “Therefore, the project cannot

contract is agreed [to] almost immediately, which seems unlikely,” Stern said.
Negotiation problems have been
compounded by Japan’s displeasure with
Iran’s apparent violations of the nuclear
nonproliferation treaty, he continued.
Stern said that another project, the
Ahvaz expansion, which is scheduled
to add another 255,000 b/d of production in 2009, is equally questionable.
NIOC, which is building the project
alone, has not led a major project since
the 1978 revolution, he said.
“We would expect that if a project of
Ahvaz’s great size were proceeding without
foreign help, it would be a cause for national pride and, therefore, well reported.
We find no reports, however,” he said.
“Of course, Ahvaz could be proceeding with reportage only in Farsi, which
we do not read. This would be atypical,
given that English, French, or Italian
reporting exists for all other [Iranian]
projects. Hence, we believe that neither
Ahvaz nor Azadegan will be built on
schedule,” said Stern.
Iran’s ability to attract foreign investment for oil and gas projects may be
restricted further by a unique buyback
investment vehicle, he continued. In
most petroleum exporting countries,
foreign exploration and development
firms offer capital, technology, and
management in exchange for a share of
the extracted resource, he explained.
“Iran’s constitution considers such arrangements as foreign ownership, which
it prohibits. This prohibition has affected
disinvestment and deterioration in Iran’s
petroleum infrastructure, most of which
was built before the Iranian Revolution.
Compounding the problem is NIOC’s inability to lead major project construction,”
Stern said. ✦

Troubled projects in Iran and Russia

Iranian and Russian production is
important to a goal announced by the
government in May to increase the
share of oil developed and imported
by Japanese companies to 40% of total
imports by 2030 from 15% in recent
years.

However, he said, there are numerous smaller innovations such as the
systematic use of associated gas in the

very important to bringing more gas
resources to the markets in a sustainable
and responsible way.
He said it is evident that “[companies will] have to cost-effectively develop gas resources that are located farther

they all have to address the need to
improve the energy efficiency of our
plants, particularly in LNG, not to mention GTL [gas-to-liquids],” he added.
Along with the need for technology, the gas industry requires more
human resources due to the increasing
complexity of gas projects—finding
markets, setting commercial terms,
managing onshore plants in harmony
with host communities and sometimes
across borders.

“Sourcing more people locally is
critical,” for a number of reasons, Darricarrere said. Local know-how is a
major advantage in designing projects
that benefit all stakeholders. They help
in developing markets, in maintaining
relations with customers, in supporting local communities in their sustainable development, and in operating
and maintaining a plant over 20 years
or more. Secondly, maximizing the
involvement of the people to whom

the projects matter simply makes good
business sense.
“Companies that can put forward
dedicated technological capabilities
and the right people to guide stakeholders through the right decision
process then implement the project
on time and on budget will not only
maximize the benefits for host communities and countries but also help to
meet the gas challenges,” he concluded. ✦

Linn acquisitions
Linn’s Texas transaction involves a
field with a production mix of 55%
natural gas liquids, 35% natural gas,
and 10% oil from more than 820 wells.
The acquisition involves proved reserves
of 55 MMboe, more that half of which
are proved developed.
The Appalachian transactions include
more than 55 producing gas wells in
West Virginia. Those properties have 2426 bcf of proved reserves, Linn said.

Horst are about 30 million boe. First

Eric Watkins
Senior Correspondent
Russia’s Economic Development and
Trade Ministry, in forecasting the country’s oil and gas production and exports
to 2010, said gas exports in 2010 will
increase to 223.4 billion cu m and oil
exports, to 271 million tonnes.
It said Russia’s 2010 natural gas production will increase to 722 billion cu
m in 2010, following 655 billion cu m
in 2006, 668 billion cu m in 2007, 683
billion cu m in 2008, and 705 billion
cu m in 2009.
It forecast gas exports of 202.5 billion cu m in 2006, 200.8 billion cu m
in 2007, 208.5 billion cu m in 2008,
and 218.4 billion cu m in 2009.
The ministry said oil production will
grow to 512 million tonnes in 2010,
following 480.4 million tonnes in
2006, 492 million tonnes in 2007, 500
million tonnes in 2008, and 507 million tonnes in 2009.
It expects crude oil exports of 251.5
million tonnes in 2006, 262 million
tonnes in 2007, 269 million tonnes in
2008, and 274 million tonnes in 2009.
It also reported that exports of
refined petroleum products—103.5
million tonnes in 2006—are forecast to grow to 105 million tonnes in
2010. ✦

T

he Russians continue to have
problems over oil and gas with
their fellow states in the former
Soviet Union. Consider Belarus,
where the government has imposed
a customs duty on Russian crude
transported through the country’s
pipelines.
Belarusian Prime Minister Sergei Sidorsky said the customs duty would amount
to $45/tonne of oil effective Jan. 1.
The total customs duty will add
up to quite a few dollars, too, since
Russia’s oil transit through Belarusan
pipelines comes to some 70-80 million tonnes/year and reaches several
important markets.
The 1,923-km Gomel oil pipeline carries supplies toward Ukraine,
Poland, and Germany and accounts
for more than 70% of all oil transit
through Belarus, while the 1,065km Novopolotsk oil pipeline handles
shipments to the Baltic states.

Belarusian tax is actually a counter
attack on Russia’s recent price rises
for gas and crude.
In fact, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko lashed out angrily at the
Russian leadership over energy price increases, calling its conduct “shameless.”

Pay for services

The customs duty and harsh
remarks came after Belarus avoided
a cut off of its gas supplies on Jan.
1 only by agreeing to pay twice the
previous price this year and even
more in the future.
The Belarusians also are upset
about a new customs duty Russia plans to impose this year on oil
exports to its neighbor. The customs
duty would deprive the Belarusian
government of major profits it has
reaped by exporting products made
from cheap Russian crude.
As a result, Belarus has reportedly
stopped importing Russian oil as a

P L O R A T I O N

For more than half a century the
West Africa region, in particular the
countries bordering the Gulf of Guinea
and Congo Delta, has been one of the
most exciting and attractive regions in
the world for the oil industry.
A review of E&P literature as well as
an assessment of the strategy of all major international oil companies reveals
that this region has not only remained
attractive in recent
years but that in the
future it will become
even more important.
From an E&P perspective, the excellent
exploration record and
the start of many new
fields over the last few years particularly
in deep water are proof that the region
has remained attractive. However, the
facts that oil production will continue
to expand in the coming years and that
more oil is to be found clearly indicate
that the region will become even more
important in the future.
The countries that comprise West
Africa include Nigeria and several
non-OPEC countries. The latter group
includes seven important producers,
three small producers, and many nonproducers.
The important producers are Angola
(defines the southern limit of West
Africa), Cameroon, Congo (Brazzaville),

Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Ivory Coast,
and Mauritania (defines the northern
limit of West Africa). The small producers are Benin, Ghana, and Senegal. The
nonproducers include Gambia, Guinea,
Guinea Bissau, Liberia, Sao Tome and
Principe, Sierra Leone, and Togo.
Considering the well-known challenges that face many of these countries
that inevitably affect the oil industry, it
is worth reflecting on two key points.
First, the number of exploration
wells drilled in West Africa (including Nigeria) over the last 10 years
(1996-2005) accounts for 5% of the
world total, but in terms of volume the
region contributed 21% of the total oil
reserves discovered globally and 40%
of the reserves discovered in deepwater
provinces in the world.
Second, on the supply side, in the
last 5 years (2001-05) West Africa
excluding Nigeria was the second best
performing non-OPEC region after the
FSU; the region’s oil supply increased to
2.3 million b/d in 2005 from 1.6 million b/d in 2000.
Given that it took 40 years to reach
1.5 million b/d (1960 to 2000), the
recent response is clearly strong. Nigeria, the largest producer in West Africa
and an OPEC member, also saw its production capacity expand to 2.6 million
b/d in 2005 from 2.2 million b/d in
2000, and this came despite unexpected
capacity losses in

History and recent trends
West Africa including Nigeria is a
large, world-class petroleum province
with over 140 billion bbl (2P) of oil
and gas reserves discovered since the
1950s.
During the first 40 years, the success
of E&P activities was excellent, focusing
initially on the onshore and later on the
shallow offshore. By the end of 2005, a
total of 75 billion bbl of oil (2P) have
been discovered in the onshore and
shallow offshore, of which 38.6 billion
have been produced (Table 1).
A shift to deepwater exploration
(>500 m of water) began in the early
1990s, and this has also turned out to
be a great success. Since the first well
was drilled in 1995, a total of 21 billion
bbl of oil reserves have been discovered,
of which 500 million bbl have been
produced (Table 2).
At the end of 2005, total remaining
oil reserves (total cumulative discover-

It is worth mentioning that the
USGS country estimates do not include

prolific basins such as the Niger Delta
could represent another 10% to 30% of

billion bbl).

Oil production
In 2005, West Africa produced 4.9
million b/d of oil, of which Nigeria accounted for 2.6 million b/d, from 200
fields and 2,400 producing oil wells in
the region excluding Nigeria and from
241 fields and 2,600 producing oil
wells in Nigeria.
By type of environment, 1.13 million b/d of the oil production in West
Africa (excluding Nigeria) came from 8
large projects grouping several fields.
Angola was the largest deepwater
producer with the most projects on
stream (5 projects: Xikomba, Kizomba
A and B, Girassol, and Jasmin), followed
by Equatorial Guinea (2 projects: Zafiro
and Ceiba), and Ivory Coast (1 project:
Baobab).
It is interesting to note that the
number of deepwater oil discoveries
on stream is low relative to the total
number of deepwater discoveries made
to date. Some 900,000 b/d of the total
production (excluding Nigeria) came
from 13 developments grouping over
100 shallow water fields and more than
50% of the total onshore production of
300,000 b/d from 3 development areas
grouping several fields (Table 4).
In Nigeria, 1.2 million b/d came
from 14 onshore projects grouping
some 200 fields. The shallow offshore
accounted for 1.3 million b/d of total
country oil production. Some 30 fields
were producing, but 4 projects accounted for 40% of the 1.3 million
b/d of production. At the end of 2005,
two deepwater projects were on stream
(Abo and Bonga), which produced
around 130,000 b/d. Bonga was still
ramping up to its design capacity of
200,000 b/d.
Overall, most of the production in-

crease came from deepwater fields discovered in the last decade. The region’s
first deepwater discovery came in 1995
off Equatorial Guinea, and its first oil
was produced 2 years after. However, 10
years later (2005) total deepwater oil
production from the region reached 1.3
million b/d, to represent 36% of global
deepwater production.

Cost environment
According to various estimates, West
African countries are characterized for
being low-cost producers, and this is
another reason that makes the region
attractive even though technical costs
have been rising in the last few years.
The technical cost (sum of finding,
development, and production costs per
barrel) in Angola, Congo (Brazzaville),
and Equatorial Guinea averaged $8.70/
bbl in 2005 compared with the global
industry average of $14.90/bbl. Technical costs in Nigeria were estimated
to be in the range of its West African
neighbors.
In the last 10 years, production costs
among West Africa’s largest producers
have remained flat and even declined
even though production from deepwater fields has risen rapidly.
The conventional wisdom is that
deepwater fields tend to have higher
production costs than shallow water
fields and that therefore costs should
rise, but this does not appear to be the
case thanks to the geology, reservoir
properties, technology, and good cost
management. However, looking at
finding and development (F&D) costs,

the average cost in Angola, Congo, and
Equatorial Guinea show an increase in
2005 vs. 2002 of 50% to 75% primarily due to higher rig and materials costs
(Fig. 2).

Active players
International operators produce most
of the oil in West Africa.
Many of these have been in the region since the early days of exploration,
but new companies have also gained
access including national oil companies
and independents.
It’s worth mentioning that no international oil company has ever exited
West Africa completely; in fact most
continue to increase their presence in
existing or new countries by expanding
existing projects and taking new ones.
In terms of oil production share, in
2005 the top international companies
(BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Eni,
Exxon, Shell, Statoil, and Total) produced 4.3 million b/d or 88% of the
total oil, but their entitlement (net oil)
was 2.7 million b/d or roughly 55%.
International independents and local
companies (nongovernment owned)
produced the rest, and these amounted
to over 70 companies (Fig. 3).
Most of the companies operate
under favorable production-sharing
contracts that allow even the most
challenging fields in deepwater Nigeria
and Angola to be developed at a good
financial return; only a handful of fields
remains under different arrangements

conditions.
In contrast to conventional wisdom,
all contracts have remained relatively
stable in recent years, but the general
terms have been renegotiated in close
coordination with the operators to
reflect evolving global and local conditions. Importantly, the upward trend in
production is a clear reflection that the

problems.
Models used today can predict only
about 20% of drill pipe life. Environmental conditions can change these
predictions by significant amounts;
predicted values seldom match with experimental values. This article provides
an analysis of North Sea data regarding
the effect of drilling parameters on the
fatigue life of drill pipe.

Fatigue
Fatigue refers to changes in proper-

ties that can occur in metal due to repeated application of stresses or strains,
although usually this term applies to
those changes that lead to cracking or
failure.1
The problem of fatigue increases
during drilling of long and extendedreach wells. Despite several studies conducted of this subject, results seldom
match with experience because the
numerous drilling parameters
vary considerably. Among
those parameters,
environment
plays a vital role
because it varies
from well to well. The effect of severe
environmental factors can cause sulfide
stress cracking, hydrogen embrittlement, and corrosion of drillstring.

Whether the crack will propagate
from inside or outside the pipe depends
on the type of loading. If a specimen is work hardened, then there are
more chances that a crack will grow
from outside to the inside of the pipe
because the outer fibers are in compression. If external stresses are applied, the
imperfection will grow to an extent that
the material will eventually fail. Therefore, the fatigue mechanism should be
divided into two stages.
• Stage 1 growth. Due to cyclic loading,
minute imperfections grow at different scales from crystal level to visibility.

Physically speaking, these imperfections
also act as stress concentrators but at
undetectable levels. This is why, while
estimating fatigue life of drill pipe, we
cannot practically estimate about 80%
of the actual life of the drill pipe (Fig.
2).3

Equation 2.

Statistical analysis

It is impossible to predict the actual
amount of stress generated in drill pipe,
especially while drilling long, extended-reach horizontal wells. This is due
to the conditions under which drilling
takes place. Therefore, it is impossible to
correctly predict the number of cycles
before drill pipe failure.
It is common practice to report

used in the oil and gas industry. In this
article, a semielliptical surface crack is
assumed. The constants, C and m, were
taken from the North Sea.6 Values for Kic
can be found from literature. The load
ratio R is 0.6.
Fig. 3 shows a plot of stress intensity
range and crack propagation rate. The
relationship suggests that whenever a
crack is formed in the drill pipe, it will
grow at an exponential scale with a
slope, m. The position of this line will
be determined by the constant C.
At higher stresses, it will grow at
a faster rate, meaning that drillstring
subjected to the higher stresses has
greater probability of breaking off than
washing out. A closer look at the lower
stress intensity range shows that this
crack will grow nearly vertically (Fig.
4). The negative aspect of this finding is
that life of drill pipe will be shorter. The
positive aspect is that after a crack is
formed, it should be easier for inspection companies to detect the crack.
Based on the plot in Fig. 4, if drill
pipe is stressed to its maximum limit
and the bit is rotating at 150 rpm with
a ROP of 70 fph, then it can drill
42,665 ft during the whole of its life.
Therefore, inspection should be kept
at economically feasible number of
feet drilled. This work suggests that
inspection should be done for every
35-40,000 ft drilled. This inspection

high WOB can significantly
increase crack growth rate.
Note that longer number of
rotary hours and even greater
depths have been achieved by less WOB.
The physical understanding of
higher WOB means that drillstring is
subjected to more stress cycles. Microcracks in the string will fluctuate at a
faster rate than before. This results in
faster crack propagation. This is why
washouts are often observed while back
reaming—because high axial weight is
being applied on the bit.
Hence, weight on bit is an important
parameter during design of fatigue life
of the components. The higher crack
growth rate shows that time period

shorter and eventually break off will

warning.
• Rotary torque. Fig. 11 shows that
there is no effect of rotary torque on
crack-propagation rate. This means
that keeping WOB constant but applying more torque can result in achieving greater depths without increasing
crack-propagation rate.

Next steps
There is no information about 80%
of the life of a drill pipe. More research
is needed to understand crack propagation from microlevel to visibility scale.
This analysis suggests a new inspection interval, based on Forman crackgrowth model, that claims to reduce
washouts by 50%.
It seems that various drilling parameters have almost no effect on crackpropagation rate. The WOB should not
be increased, as more WOB will cause
cracks to propagate faster. Greater
depths can be achieved by applying
more torque and constant WOB.

and the primary costs are regenerant
acid and spent-brine disposal. Spentbrine volumes generated equate to
1-2% of produced water treated, and
the process consumes no fresh water
beyond that in the spent brine.
Other technologies evaluated for
this application include reverse osmosis
and zeolite treatment, both of which
generate at least five times more waste
and have treatment costs of more than
$0.40/bbl higher.
The Higgins Loop technology is a
more effective ion exchange technology
than fixed bed and other ion-exchange
systems. It efficiently uses the resin
capacity, needs less regenerant and fresh
water, generates consistent product
quality, and minimizes wastewater volumes. The technology offers expanded
ranges for the use of ion-exchange
resins and adsorbents in commercial
separations. ✦

Water rate
For 100 mole/hr of Gas E in the
presence of 40 wt % methanol, we
varied the water rate from 1-10 mole/
hr and predicted hydrate-formation
temperatures using the two simulators.
For each water flow rate, we adjusted
the inhibitor stream rate to produce the
specified inhibitor concentration of 40
wt % methanol.
Hydrate-formation temperature is
independent of the water rate in both
simulators. In subsequent runs, we set
the water-stream rate to 10 mole/hr for
100 mole/hr of gas.

The data showed increased epifauna in

Part 1 of this article (OGJ, Jan. 1,

of Gulfstream’s monitoring activities.
Part 2, presented here, discusses the results of its monitoring program. Subsequent parts will examine the use of the

Transect analysis
Gulfstream randomly selected 45
frames from each transect video collected by ROV and 45 photographs
from each diver-collected transect.
Analysis of each for percent biotal cover
by taxon followed the random point
analysis described by Bohnsack. This
analysis first scatters 100 random dots
onto each transect image. Tabulating the
percentage of dots touching organisms
of each individual taxon then yields the
percent biotal cover for a given taxon.
Averaging data from individual images
along each transect produces a mean for
the entire transect.
Reference habitat transect data represented unaffected conditions for statistical comparison to trenched pipeline
corridor and anchor strike transects.
Gulfstream calculated mean percent
cover, epifaunal-epifloral count, species
richness, and species diversity for each
transect. Percent cover and epifaunal-

Trenched corridor
Gulfstream established ten 25-m random transects within both the trench
corridor and trench spoil mounds
perpendicular to the pipeline in Depth
Zones 1, 2, and 3. Analysis of trench
corridor transects included percent biotal cover, species richness, and species
diversity when compared to reference
habitat results.
The trench corridor had a significantly higher proportion of biotic cover
than the reference habitat, with biotic
cover in the trench corridor of nearly
6% (Table 4). Turf algae, gorgonians,
and sponges dominated the trench corridor, with a large percentage of coralline algae observed (Figs. 1b and 2b),
similar to the reference habitat.
The high degree of variability limited differences between trench corridor and reference habitat transects in
percent cover for individual taxonomic
categories (Table 4). Taxonomic diversity was similarly limited between the
trench corridor and reference habitat.
ANOSIM results indicated a significant
difference in community structure between the trench corridor and reference
habitat transects.
Gulfstream also analyzed hard-live
bottom recovery by depth. The amount
of biotic cover decreased with depth
along the trench corridor, but the trend
was not statistically significant.
Trench spoil mound transects were
also analyzed for percent biotal cover,
species richness, and species diversity,
and compared to reference habitat
results. The spoil mounds showed a
similarly significantly higher proportion of biotic cover than the reference
habitat; more than 7% (Table 5). The
trench corridor had a smaller mean
biotic cover than the spoil mounds, but
the difference was not significant.
Turf algae, gorgonians, and sponges
(Figs. 1c and 2c) dominated the spoil
mound transects. Turf algae represented
about 50% of the fauna present. Analysis did not find a significant difference
in the percent cover of individual taxonomic categories (Table 5).

mounds did not differ significantly
from either the trench corridor or
reference habitat. ANOSIM results also
failed to show a significant difference in
community structure between the spoil
mounds and reference habitat or trench
corridor. Analysis of hard-live bottom
recovery showed less biotic cover with
depth in spoil mound transects, but the
trend was not statistically significant.

Anchor-cable transects
Analysis of anchor strike and cable
sweep transect images looked for
percent biotal cover, species richness,
and species diversity, before statistically
comparing them to the reference habitat (Figs. 1d and 2d).
The proportion of biotic cover
showed no significant difference between the anchor strike-cable sweep
and reference habitat transects (Table
5). Visible anchor strikes, however,
held a higher proportion of biotic
cover (Mann-Whitney, T = 346.0, P =
0.001*) within the strikes themselves
(mean of 9.5 ±2.3%) than in the reference habitat (mean of 1.1 ±0.4%).
Gulfstream expected that anchor
strikes and cable sweeps would increase
the amount of bare rock by scraping
away the surface sediment veneer. The
percent cover of bare rock the company
identified in the anchor strike-cable
sweep transects, however, was only
slightly greater (and not significantly
different) than that found in reference
habitat transects.
Comparing bare rock cover by depth,
Zone 1 exhibited a significantly higher
amount of exposed rock than Zone 2.
Performing a separate analysis examining only areas that showed visible signs
of anchor impact identified a significantly greater percent cover of bare
rock (Mann-Whitney, T = 354.0, P =
0.001*, mean of 11.3 ±2.7%) than the
reference habitat (mean of 4.0 ±2.9%).

Biological assessment
Undisturbed hard-live bottom reference habitat areas contained very little
biotic cover (<2%) with a predominantly sand veneer substrate. Dominant

sessile epifauna included turf algae,
gorgonians, and sponges. The red tide
that preceded 2005 monitoring led to
expectations of diminished biotic cover
in Depth Zones 1 and 2.
The community structure differs
between Depth Zones within reference
habitat areas; diversity based upon standard index values does not, however.
Turf algae dominate in the shallower
depths, while sponge and gorgonian
cover increases with depth. The communities established on exposed rock
proved susceptible to either burial or
scouring on a regular basis via sand
movement.
Hard-live bottom communities on
the west Florida shelf, therefore, are
not static-state growth communities
but instead are dynamic communities
frequently disturbed by natural events
such as red tide and storms.
The federal mitigation plan stated a
measure of 80% similarity for the environment to be considered recovered. It
did not state, however, if this required
80% similarity in percent cover or in

species composition.
Gulfstream activities appear to have
met both criteria, as biotic cover was
enhanced in the trench corridor, spoil
mound, and visible anchor strike areas
compared to natural undisturbed hardlive bottom. An increased amount of
bare substrate for epifaunal-epifloral
recruitment likely caused the increase
in cover.
The enhanced recruitment and
greater diversity of fauna found in the
areas of the pipeline, however, did not
significantly alter the community structure from that found on undisturbed
bottom. Rock exposed during trenching
and anchoring activities allows for attachment sites in an otherwise predominately sand veneer matrix.
These results are based solely on
percent-cover information. Noncolonial
epifauna were also counted along each
transect. Analysis found similar trends
in abundance when examining these
counts (Fig. 3). ✦

New resin family for drilling uses
Xponent, a new resin family, helps
enable downhole instrument manufacturers to design and fabricate a variety of
measurement-while-drilling and loggingwhile-drilling (MWD-LWD) instrument
housings, packers, and diverters.
The company optimizes component
manufacturing efficiency by offering
Xponent bismaleimide in various composite forms such as prepreg, towpreg, and
custom compression molded components
and molding compound.
Xponent resins provide an alternative
to machined and cast metals for MWDLWD applications. Sacrificial downhole
instrumentation in composite housings
also enables rapid drill-through compared
with metals. The Xponent family supports
a range of performance. Depending on
structure and design, downhole pressures
ranging to as high as 20,000 psi and temperatures to as much as 260° C. may be
tolerated. For offshore operations, Xponent
resins are resistant to corrosive effects of

saline at high pressure and temperature,

Hot news: Oil
proﬁts to be
down this year
Here’s news you won’t read on the front
pages of newspapers this year.
Unless prices spurt again, proﬁts of
major oil and gas companies in 2007 will
fall below last year’s record levels.
But stories about the declines will be
short and relegated to newspaper business
pages, unadorned by quotes from outraged
gasoline consumers.
Except for oil company shareholders

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

and managers, nobody cares about oil
company proﬁts unless gasoline prices are
abnormally high.
But the coincidence of elevated gasoline
prices and high oil company proﬁts always
provokes a national tantrum in the US.
It certainly did so last year, when prices
jumped for reasons anyone could see
(rebellion in Nigeria, war in Iraq, reﬁneries
ﬂooded by hurricanes).
The American public apparently expects
oil companies to refrain from earning profits when oil and gas prices jump.
This is not easy. Not proﬁting when
commodity prices leap is more difﬁcult
than, for example, producing oil in 5,000
ft of water and making vehicle fuel able to
meet ever-toughening air-quality standards.
In the oil and gas business, when prices
rise revenues rise if production rates don’t
drop. It’s arithmetic. And if costs don’t rise
proﬁts rise. Arithmetic again.
It is in fact impossible not to record
abnormally high proﬁts when prices leap.
It’s just as impossible for abnormally high
proﬁts to endure.
High proﬁts attract competition, which
increases supply, which lowers prices.
At the same time, high prices discourage
consumption, which lowers demand and
also lowers prices. High proﬁts also invite
cost increases, which erode proﬁts even if
prices stay high.
All that explains why oil-company
proﬁts this year probably won’t match last
year’s aberrations. Prices and consumption growth already have eased. Costs are
skyrocketing. The diminished proﬁts should
delight Americans who were irked so thoroughly last year. But they won’t see stories
about them on newspaper front pages.
Americans want to believe that rising
gasoline prices reﬂect a conspiracy against
them. They refuse to believe that markets,
including physical upsets like Nigerian
sabotage and Gulf Coast hurricanes, have
anything to do with fuel prices.
Newspapers want to please them. So no
one learns anything.

Inventory, weather inﬂuence markets
The February contract for benchmark US sweet, light crudes increased 26¢ to
$63.72/bbl Dec. 20 as the US Energy Information Administration reported a largerthan-expected 6.3 million bbl drop in commercial US crude stocks to 329.1 million
bbl in the week ended Dec. 15.
Warm weather then caused the February contract to fall for four consecutive trading sessions through the Christmas holiday, closing at $60.34/bbl Dec. 27, the lowest
level for a lead contract in more than a month on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price increased to $60.53/bbl Dec. 28 on the report of another large drop in
crude stocks, down 8.1 million bbl in the week ended Dec. 22, marking larger-thananticipated crude draws in 10 out of the last 11 reports. “Since Nov. 17, US crude supplies have declined by 20.2 million bbl, the biggest 5-week drop since the hurricane
season in 2005,” said analysts in Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc.
Weather drives markets
Nevertheless, forecasts of warm weather and fear of a slowing US economy continued to dominate the market. “This month is expected to end up being the warmest December on record while initial forecasts for January are calling for continued
mild weather,” said Robert S. Morris, Banc of America Securities LLC, New York.
Because of a strong El Nino weather pattern, the National Oceanic & Atmospheric
Administration called for higher-than-normal temperatures in most of the US for the
rest of the winter. “Market sentiment has been driven primarily by mild East Coast
weather recently. However, we suggest that the impact is being overdone, given
that heating oil is normally just 6% of US demand at this time of year, and last year
proved to be less affected by weather than is normally assumed,” said Paul Horsnell
at Barclays Capital Inc., London.
“The average price of front-month [crude contract on NYMEX] in 2006 is headed
for about $66.25/bbl, a 17% rise on 2005 and not much of a major deceleration from
the increases of 20%, 32%, and 37% experienced in 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively,” Horsnell said. “However, oil prices are ending the year relatively weakly, with the
value of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ basket currently lower
in dollar terms than it was at the start of the fourth quarter. Further, in euro terms the
value of the basket is currently only a little above its low for the quarter.”
Geopolitical issues ignored
Traders shrugged off several geopolitical issues that could impact the market.
The United Nations Security Council voted Dec. 22 to order all countries to stop
supplying Iran with materials and technology that could contribute to its nuclear and
missile programs. Iran remained deﬁant, although Iranian Oil Minister Kazem Vaziri
Hamaneh said Iran’s oil industry and crude exports would not be disrupted.
“This move, although expected, should be viewed as an escalation in the confrontation between the Islamic Republic and Western nations,” said Raymond James
analysts. The UN resolution “was watered down signiﬁcantly at the behest of Russia
and China; both have signiﬁcant economic ties to Iran.”
Raymond James said: “From an oil market perspective, this resolution does not
have any direct impact on Tehran’s ability to pump crude oil into the international
markets; the sanctions are targeted purely at the country’s ability to acquire materials necessary to develop nuclear technology. However, this stern decision by the
international community highlights the geopolitical risks that continue to haunt the
ever-tightening energy markets. Going forward, threats by Iran to pull out of the
Non-Proliferation Treaty and expel UN nuclear inspectors may further aggravate the
current situation and inﬂate the risk premium in oil prices.”
Violence escalated in Nigeria’s Niger Delta with armed attacks by militants on oil
production facilities. “The largest African crude producer has lost anywhere between
200,000-600,000 b/d in hydrocarbon production in the past year,” Raymond James
reported. “As a precautionary measure, one oil ﬁrm has already started to evacuate
dependents of foreign employees from the turbulent region. Nigeria continues to be
a stark example of the very real geopolitical risk to oil supply, and one that may not
be fully recognized by the commodity markets.” With the recent reelection of President Hugo Chavez, Venezuela’s oil production should remain below its OPEC quota.
The loss of more than 30% of Venezuela’s former crude production level since 2001
“is one of the worst declines of any major oil producing country,” said Raymond
James analysts. “The entire political map of Latin America continues to shift towards
left-wing governments with generally antitrade and anti-investment policies.”

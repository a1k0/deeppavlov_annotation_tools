Without a cost-effective way to remove high levels of nitrogen, you’ve bypassed
would-be opportunities again and again. Now is the time to stop, go back,
tap into those reserves and start making more money.

BCCK Engineering will help you remove nitrogen from your gas streams quickly, efﬁciently and affordably.
And with nitrogen out of the picture, all that gas — and all those proﬁts — are there for the taking.
Thanks to BCCK, it’s time to get both.

For a personal consultation, call BCCK at 888-518-6459,

COVER
A stationary lifting device placed the topsides onto the deep-draft
semisubmersible hull of the Independence Hub docked at Kiewit
Offshore Services Ltd.’s facilities near Corpus Christi,Tex. Once
moored in 8,000 ft of water in the eastern Gulf of Mexico,
Independence Hub initially will process gas from 10 deepwater gas
fields lying in 8,000-9,000 ft of water that otherwise would be
uneconomical to develop on a stand-alone basis.The article in the
special section on p. 43 describes the project in more detail. Photo

Nigerian militants leave oil-pumping station
Militants in Nigeria have abandoned an oil-pumping station operated by Nigeria Agip Oil Co. (NAOC) after a 2-week siege, freeing nine contract workers and some 20 government soldiers.
A government spokesman said the armed men left the facility in
the early hours of Nov. 19 after a truce was brokered by the Bayesla
state government.
A senior police officer confirmed that the hostages had been
released and the flow station vacated, but he could not say if any
ransom was paid to the militants.
Agip’s Tebidaba oil-pumping station in Nigeria’s southern Bayelsa state was overrun and shut down following an attack on Nov.
6 by armed militants, according to company and government officials (OGJ Online, Nov. 6, 2006).

Murkowski releases new pipeline contract report
Alaska Gov. Frank Murkowski on Nov. 16 submitted a 350-page
Interim Fiscal Interest Finding (IFIF) report to the Alaskan legislature that provides an economic analysis supporting construction of
a natural gas pipeline from the North Slope.
Murkowski, who is leaving office Dec. 4, said he was ready to
assist Gov.-elect Sarah Palin and the legislature.
Alaska Department of Revenue Commissioner Bill Corbus prepared the IFIF report, including proposed changes to a draft contract that Murkowski negotiated with North Slope producers. The
first draft was released in May (OGJ, June 5, 2006, Newsletter).
The oil companies have not agreed to any of the proposed
changes, Murkowski said. The IFIF includes a draft limited liability
corporation contract under which the project would be built and
operated by a partnership of the state of Alaska and North Slope
producers.
“This document represents the future of Alaska,” Murkowski
said. “We must transition our oil-based economy to one based on
gas production.”

Exploration

&

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Murkowski declined to say whether he might ask for additional
legislative consideration on the pipeline. The Alaska Supreme Court
is reviewing an Alaska state district court ruling that Murkowski
cannot unilaterally approve the pipeline contract. Murkowski appealed the lower court ruling.

EPA issues subsoil tank containment grant rules
The US Environmental Protection Agency issued the final secondary containment grant guidelines for states on Nov. 16, implementing a key provision of the underground storage tank amendments in the 2005 Energy Policy Act.
Secondary containment provides a barrier between an underground storage tank and the environment by holding leaking petroleum between the barrier and tank so the leak can be detected.
EPA, which provides funding to states through grants to regulate
underground storage tanks, said it worked with states and regional
tank offices to develop the guidelines.
The guidelines provide compliance requirements, detailed definitions and examples for states choosing to implement the secondary containment provision. Owners and operators would not
be required to retrofit equipment, but would have to follow the
guidelines with replacements or installation of new equipment,
the agency said.
EPA said states receiving funds under Subtitle 1 of the Waste Disposal Act must by Feb. 7, 2007, implement either these guidelines
or financial responsibility and certification grant guidelines that
the agency will issue in the next few months.
The agency is giving states maximum flexibility to establish
their own secondary containment requirements by that date because it is only a few months away. For states demonstrating good
faith efforts to meet the requirements, EPA said it has the flexibility to continue providing them assistance as they implement their
programs. ✦

Development

Husky completes White Rose delineation
Husky Energy Inc., Calgary, has completed the White Rose 2006
delineation program, resulting in an increase of the assessment of
White Rose oil field’s recoverable resources by 190 million bbl of
oil. The field is in the Jeanne d’Arc basin 350 km east of St. John’s,
Newf.
“The results of this delineation program, along with the strong
performance of the current development, should allow White Rose
to significantly extend its production plateau,” said Chief Executive
and Pres. John C.S. Lau.
Contributing to the increase in the assessment of the field’s re-

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

sources is Husky’s hydrocarbon discovery at the North Amethyst
K-15 delineation well in the southwestern section of White Rose.
This discovery could contain recoverable resources of 40-100 million bbl of oil, with a likely estimate of 70 million bbl. The K-15
well, drilled to 2,566 m on White Rose Significant Discovery License 1044, revealed a 50-55-m oil column with high reservoir
quality in the Aptian-age Ben Nevis Avalon formation. The company is continuing to assess core and fluid samples and wireline
log data.
Earlier this year Husky announced results of the O-28 delineation well, which was drilled in the western section of the field.

Further review of the well data and geological modeling has resulted in Husky’s
upgrading its estimate of recoverable resources in this area to 50-200 million bbl
of oil, with a current likely estimate of 120
million bbl. A further delineation well is
planned in 2007 to confirm the resource
estimates and to assist in future development planning.
The total estimate of about 190 million
bbl of recoverable resources from the K15 and O-28 wells is incremental to the
White Rose proven and probable reserves.
The two wells are near the SeaRose floating
production, storage, and offloading vessel.
Husky is conducting front-end engineering on the White Rose field’s southern
extension, which the company expects to
develop as a subsea tieback to the SeaRose
FPSO. Production from this pool is scheduled for late 2009, pending regulatory approvals. The southern extension reserves
are included in the current estimate of
White Rose proven and probable reserves.
It is anticipated that the K-15 discovery
also will be developed through the southern extension development.
The SeaRose FPSO is producing 110,000
b/d of oil from five production wells. A

sixth production well is being completed
and is expected to come on stream later
this month, increasing reservoir production capacity to 125,000 b/d of oil.
Field operator Husky Energy holds a
72.5% interest in the project. Petro-Canada
holds the remaining 27.5%.

Vinccler boosting Falcon
basin production
PetroFalcon Corp., Carpinteria, Calif., said
its PetroCumarebo joint venture with Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) looks forward
to accelerating activity on the East and West
Falcon blocks in northern Venezuela.
PetroFalcon’s
Vinccler
Venezuela
and PDVSA-Corporación Venezolana del
Petróleo signed the joint venture conversion agreement on Sept. 29, giving PetroCumarebo rights to the two blocks covering 838,000 acres for 20 years.
Gross production from the two blocks
totals 1,200 b/d of oil and 12 MMcfd of
gas.
Vinccler Venezuela, with 40% interest,
was expanding facilities to handle 20 MMcfd
and 1,700 b/d at La Vela field and 30 MMcfd
and 5,000 b/d at Cumarebo field.

PetroCumarebo plans to develop Los Moroches oil and gas field,
discovered in 1995 on West Falcon by the previous operator. Vinccler Venezuela also delineated several structural prospects around
Cumarebo field on 85 km of 2D seismic data gathered in 2005.
Due to the delay in incorporating the JV, PetroCumarebo will

Gentry makes Alberta oil discovery

Chile’s Magallanes area gets new gas ﬂow
GeoPark Holdings Ltd., Hamilton, Bermuda, said it has become the first private company to produce oil and gas in southern
Chile.
As operator of the 440,000-acre Fell Block, GeoPark is the only
oil and gas company operating in Chile other than state Empresa
Nacional de Petroleo (ENAP).
GeoPark is producing 5.4 MMcfd of gas and 50 b/d of condensate from single wells in Molino, Ovejero, and Nika fields on the
Fell Block in the Austral basin northwest of the Straits of Magellan.
It is selling gas to the Methanex methanol plant at Tierra del Fuego,
Argentina, and condensate to ENAP.
GeoPark plans to tie in Santiago Norte field in late 2006 and
other fields in second quarter 2007.
A workover rig has been cleaning out more wells since September, and a drilling rig is due to arrive in first quarter 2007. A 650
sq km 3D seismic survey is under way on the Fell Block.
GeoPark holds 100% interest in the Fell Block, having acquired
the last 10% interest from ENAP earlier this year.
The Fell Block in Chile and GeoPark-operated Cerro Dona Juana,
Del Mosquito, Loma Cortaderal blocks in Argentina total more than
700,000 acres.

Gentry Resources Ltd., Calgary, said a well drilled in the Mississippian Pekisko formation within the Princess exploration area of
southern Alberta encountered a net pay interval of 12 m within a
gross pay column of 40 m.
The discovery well is 8 miles south of Gentry’s existing Tilleyto-West Tide Lake Pekisko oil fairway.
On test, the well flowed for 8 hr at the equivalent of 925 b/d at
a flowing pressure of 200 psig. Gentry Resources expects to install
a temporary battery by early December, and the well is expected to
produce at a restricted initial well allowable rate of 125 b/d.
Two more exploratory wells are to be drilled in December, 15
miles south of the discovery well, to test another possible oil fairway. Five additional exploratory wells on the block are planned for KMV plans three more gas wells in Oklahoma

Shell lets EPC contract for Perdido project
Shell Offshore Inc. has let an engineering, procurement, and
construction (EPC) contract to Technip for a production spar hull
and mooring system for the Perdido hub project 200 miles south
of Freeport, Tex., in the Gulf of Mexico.
The contract covers spar hull and mooring system design and
fabrication, load out onto a transportation vessel, transportation
and quayside delivery at a Gulf of Mexico yard, and design of the
steel catenary risers, top tension risers, and umbilicals. The contract
value was not disclosed.
Technip’s operations and engineering center in Houston will
provide the overall project management, and the global engineering for the hull and mooring system, as well as engineering and
procurement support for the riser tensioner system. The detailed
hull design and fabrication will be carried out by Technip’s yard in
Pori, Finland.
Shell will operate the hub, called Perdido Regional Host, with
a 35% interest. Other interests are Chevron Corp., 37.5%, and
BP PLC, 27.5%. The facility will be capable of handling 130,000
boe/d, and it is expected to come on line “around the turn of the
decade,” Shell said. It will handle production from Great White,
Tobago, and Silvertip fields.
Shell plans to moor the regional direct-vertical-access spar in a
record water depth of 8,000 ft of water. The common processing
hub, on Alaminos Canyon Block 857 near the Great White discovery, will have a drilling and completion rig and will gather, process,
and transport production from wet trees as far away as 30 miles.
Pipelines from the facility will connect to undisclosed locations in
Texas (OGJ, Nov. 6, 2006, Newsletter).

Denser fracs improve Woodford gas ﬂows
Gas flow rates are much improved at the more recent horizontal
wells with higher frac densities in the Woodford shale play in the
Arkoma basin of southeastern Oklahoma, said Newfield Exploration Co., Houston.
Newfield, which has production data from 29 horizontal Woodford wells, said initial gross production averages nearly 6 MMcfd
from the eight horizontal wells it has tested that were treated with
the higher frac densities.
Two of the eight wells, which have laterals of 1,600-3,500
ft, had initial production of 10 MMcfd, and two others flowed
7 MMcfd of gas. Fracs at the eight wells involved three to seven
stages.
The company’s gross production from the play has grown to
nearly 80 MMcfd from 25 MMcfd at this time in 2005.
MarkWest Energy Partners LP, Denver, and Newfield plan to
place in service more than 50 miles of large-diameter pipe in early
December to complete the low and high-pressure backbone of the
planned 400-mile, four-county gathering system (see map, OGJ,
Oct. 9, 2006, p. 31). This is more than 3 months ahead of schedule.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Once the backbone is completed, Newfield will have the ability
to produce from any part of its 125,000 net acre position.
The 2007 plan calls for the drilling of 150 horizontal wells.
Permitted spacing of 640 acres would allow nearly all of the company’s current acreage to be held by production by the end of 2007
based on the anticipated drilling rate as activity ramps up to 20 rigs
from 11 operated rigs at present.

Antrim secures drilling rig for UK North Sea
Antrim Energy Inc., Calgary, has secured a semisubmersible rig
to drill three Causeway appraisal-development wells next year on
UK North Sea Block 211/22a.
Antrim, the operator and owner of 65.5% interest in the block,
hired AGR Peak Well Management (Peak) to conduct the drilling
program. Peak earlier had managed the drilling on East Causeway.
Antrim will spud the first appraisal-development well in May
2007, about 2 miles southwest of the East Causeway discovery. The
company expects to drill to 11,500 ft and to appraise the Middle
Jurassic Brent Group of sandstones, specifically the Tarbert, Ness,
and Etive formations.
The drilling program follows Antrim’s East Causeway discovery 211/23d-17z, which flowed on final test at multiple stabilized
rates of up to 7,500 b/d of light, sweet oil (OGJ, Aug. 18, 2006,
Newsletter).
The test rate did not include the 8,100 b/d of oil flow rate
previously recorded from the Ness formation in the suspended
211/23b-11 well in an eastern fault compartment.

Kuwait planning gas production by 2008
Kuwait, which in March announced the discovery of 35 tcf of
free natural gas and a large quantity of light oil in what it called its
“northern oil fields,” plans to start commercial production of gas
late next year or early January 2008, according to Farouk al-Zanki,
head of state-owned Kuwait Oil Co. (KOC).
At an oil and gas conference in Kuwait City, al-Zanki said the
firm expects an initial output of 180 MMcfd, which it would increase to 600 MMcfd by 2011 and to 1 bcfd by 2014-15.
Al-Zanki said KOC would have a provisional plan for natural gas
development by the end of November or in early December.
He said the company is searching for more gas in five exploration sites in the same region, which he did not name. It needs gas
for its desalination plants and for a planned large refinery.
Al-Zanki also repeated an earlier commitment to increase Kuwait’s oil production capacity to 3 million b/d by 2010, to 3.5
million b/d by 2015, and 4 million b/d by 2020 from the current
2.6 million b/d.
In January, Kuwait said it also planned to start exploration for
natural gas in what it called undisputed parts of offshore Dorra
field, which Iran also claims. At the time, Kuwait’s energy ministry
undersecretary Issa al-Oun told the Al-Siyassah newspaper: “Talks
with Iran are continuing over the continental shelf. But, we have

Gas-purchase agreements advance Galsi line

Gaz de France launches large LNG vessel

New gas-purchase agreements by five Italian energy companies have
given a push to plans for a third gas pipeline between North Africa and
Europe.
The companies, Enel, Edison, Hera, Ascopiave, and Worldenergy, have
agreed to import a total of 6 billion cu m/year of gas from Algeria via
the proposed pipeline connecting Algeria with Italy by way of Sardinia.
Sonatrach of Algeria, Enel, and Wintershall of Germany formed a
venture to study feasibility of the pipeline in December 2001 (OGJ, Jan.
7, 2002, Newsletter). Other companies have joined the venture, now
called Galsi.
The project envisions four pipeline segments: 640 km onshore between Hassi R’mel gas field in Algeria and El Kala on the Algerian coast;
310 km between El Kala and Cagliari on Sardinia in water as deep as
1,950 m; 300 km between Cagliari and Olbia on the northern Sardinian
coast; and 220 km between Olbia and Pescaia, southeast of Florence, in
water as deep as 900 m.
Sonatrach says the Galsi pipeline will have a capacity of 8 billion cu
m/year, and it projects start-up at the end of 2009.

Gaz de France has launched the 154,500-cu-m Provalys LNG
carrier, one of the world’s largest, at Montoir-de-Bretagne.
The 190 m by 43.5 m vessel is equipped to load LNG in arctic
conditions.
Gaz de France is both owner and charterer. It now operates 11 LNG
vessels and has two under construction at Chantiers de l’Atlantique:
one with 74,000 cu m of capacity due for delivery by yearend and
another with 154,000 cu m of capacity due in early 2007.

treat the city’s wastewater.
Microorganisms in the plant’s digester tanks, said the company, eat the
grease and other organic matter, naturally producing methane gas, which
fuels the plant’s new 250-kw microturbine cogenerator to produce electricity
for wastewater treatment.
“Meanwhile, excess heat produced
by the cogenerator warms the digester
tanks to their optimum temperature for
methane production,” it said.
The process will generate about 1.7

Democrats and energy
Democrats newly in control of the US Congress
have a unique opportunity to act constructively on
energy. The political party they defeated in elections this month abandoned the high ground of
energy realism. Seldom does an incoming party
get such a chance to steer a foundering policy
quickly onto reasonable course.
To do that, however, Democrats will have to
turn away from past rhetoric. Speaker-to-be of the
House Nancy Pelosi of California has blustered
about ending tens of billions of dollars of tax
“give-aways” to “Big Oil.” She won’t make good
on the promise. The tax code isn’t as generous as
populist mythology claims it to be, least of all to
big oil and gas companies. Does the Democratic
leadership want only to slap around oil companies
for sins no graver than being large, unpopular, and
for the past several quarters anomalously profitable? Or does it want to get serious about energy?

It inevitably breeds wishes disconnected from
economics and physics. And it tricks politicians
otherwise committed to market freedom into
believing that energy is some special case to which
markets are irrelevant.
For so important a factor in national economic
health, disregard for the discipline of economics,
for the practicalities of physics, and for the efficiencies of markets is dangerous. But it’s the foul
stew that bubbles up when oil prices rise enough
to make politicians notice how much of the oil the
US uses is imported. Then everyone panics, energy
independence becomes the battle cry, and expensive and mostly futile policy proposals receive
serious attention from adults who should know
better.
Imported oil is indeed less preferable than domestically produced oil and in that context merits
concern. But imported oil is better for energy consumers and for the national economy than substiEnergy independence

Data for liquids presented in this
article suggest that global crude oil,
natural gas liquids (NGL), and Alberta
oil sands production will plateau at
above 118 million b/d and productive
capacity at 123 million b/d in 2031—
far later than current alarmist predictions—even without the likely development of tar sands and other bitumens
and extra-heavy crude.
Unfortunately
there are
no reliable data
on total
recoverable
global natural gas resources and of
cumulative production, which are required to estimate the time and quantity of peak gas production.
Nevertheless, the global natural gas
outlook is also quite bright, with Jan. 1,
2006, proved reserves of 6,112 tcf, and
total 2003 global consumption of 95.5
tcf rising to 182 tcf in 2030, according
to the Energy Information Administration (EIA) Reference Case in its International Energy Outlook 2006. This
is equivalent to a roughly 40-year gas
reserve life. This outlook is especially
positive, as global gas exploration and
resources development have not been
nearly as intensive as for crude oil.
In the US, however, current gas production of 19 tcf/year is already near
its projected plateau, and a decline in
domestic production seems inevitable
unless there is a much more aggressive
leasing policy, both off and onshore,
especially for unconventional natural
gas resources such as coalbed methane
(CBM), tight sands gas, Devonian shale
gas, and gas from ultradeep formations.
This article addresses both these two
critical issues:
• The time and magnitude of peak
global production of conventional
petroleum liquids, such as crude oil and
lease condensates, and oil from Alberta
oil sands and NGL.
• The magnitude and time of peak
US natural gas production.

World liquids resources
In addition to crude oil, lease
condensate, and NGL, conventional
petroleum liquids now include crude
recovered from Alberta oil sands, which
have been included in proved reserves
since Jan. 1, 2003.1
According to the International Energy Outlook 2006, as shown in Table
1, estimated proved and undiscovered
world oil resources are 2,961.6 billion
bbl, which includes 1,292.5 billion bbl
of proved crude oil, lease condensate,
and NGL reserves.2 The US Geological
Survey’s estimates of reserve growth
and undiscovered resources also include
lease condensates and NGL. Worldwide,
NGL production during the first 3
months of this year was 7.613 million
b/d, or 10.3% of the total liquids production, in addition to 73.761 million
b/d of crude oil production.3 4
In order to estimate the time of
peak global oil or hydrocarbon liquids
production, there must be a good estimate of cumulative production through
2005. This estimate would include unconventional sources such as the prolific
Alberta oil sands that have made Canada
the world’s No. 2 reserve holder after
Saudi Arabia, with 178.8 billion bbl as
of Jan. 1, 2006, out of the total 1,292.5
billion bbl proved reserves.5
The most reliable value is 986.496
billion bbl through Jan. 1, 2005, from
the 61st edition of the DeGolyer and
MacNaughton Twentieth Century Petroleum Statistics 2005.6 These data, for
crude oil only, exclude NGL. Updating this value with an estimated global
crude oil production of 71.794 million b/d in 2005 would add 26.205
billion bbl to the Jan. 1, 2005, value
of 986.496 billion bbl for a total of
1,012.701 billion bbl.5
To estimate cumulative global petroleum liquids production through January 1, 2006, including NGL, the value
of 1,012.701 billion bbl would have to
be raised by 10.3% to 1,117.009 billion bbl on the basis of the admittedly
sketchy data cited for 2006.

One of the major positive impacts
on gas prices is that there is growing optimism about the potential of
unconventional gas, such as gas from
tight formations, Devonian shales,
geopressured reservoirs, coal beds, and
extremely deep horizons. Of highest
probability is that technology advances
can increase the production of three
sources of unconventional gas above the
levels projected by EIA through 2025
(Table 7).20
The Rocky Mountain region is by
far the largest source of CBM and tight
sands gas but much of the underdeveloped resources of unconventional gas
are inaccessible (Table 8).21
Total US CBM proved reserves as of
Dec. 31, 2004, were 18.390 tcf, according to EIA, and 2004 production was
1.720 tcf.21 In view of the huge US coal
resource base, the research, development, and demonstration (RD&D)
programs to enhance the technology
for CBM discovery, development, and
production seems especially promising, including the use of CO2 destined
for sequestration to stimulate production. For example, as shown in Table
6, the Potential Gas Committee in its
estimated potential US gas resources,
December 2004, projects the probable US resource of CBM at roughly 18
tcf, the possible resource at 57 tcf, the
speculative resource at 95 tcf, and the
total potential resource at 169 tcf, now
a relatively conservative estimate.
One of the first priorities should
be to obtain a more reliable estimate
of technically recoverable Lower 48
unconventional natural gas resources.
The Potential Gas Committee of the
Colorado School of Mines’ Potential
Gas Agency, the Department of Energy’s
Office of Oil and Gas, and DOE’s EIA
in its Annual Energy Outlook series, all
produced widely differing values. For
example, in the EIA Annual Energy Outlook 2004 (January 2004), the technically recoverable Lower 48 unconventional natural gas resources as of Jan. 1,
2002, are given as 475 tcf, including
343 tcf tight gas, 58 tcf shale gas, and

whose development was nearly entirely
the result of GRI’s RD&D investments
and which should offer additional opportunities to the new Gas Technology
Institute (GTI) formed by the merger
of GRI and the Institute of Gas Technology in 2000. Reeves makes many useful
suggestions on enhanced CBM production technologies and promising areas
for exploration and notes that the Green
River basin alone contains a resource
base of 314 tcf of CBM.

Methane hydrates
Methane hydrates have tremendous
potential.25 In fact, more than half of all
the organic carbon on Earth (recoverable and nonrecoverable fossil fuels,
soil, dissolved organic matter, land biota
and peat) is in the form of marine and
permafrost methane hydrate deposits.
This is equivalent to 706,000 tcf of
methane, of which 112,000-113,000
tcf is in US coastal deposits and a small
permafrost deposit at 95% probability.
About 100,000 tcf of methane would
meet total current US energy consumption of about 100 quadrillion (1015)
btu for 1,000 years. However, the current development initiatives seem to
remain focused on the more “conventional” forms of unconventional natural
gas, especially CBM.

74 tcf CBM (Table 9)22 compared with
184.1 tcf of Lower 48 proved conventional gas reserves on Dec. 31, 2004,
reported by EIA in its “2004 Annual
Report of US Crude Oil, Natural Gas
and Natural Gas Liquids Reserves.”23
An article by Sam Fletcher, “Major
US supply role seen for unconventional
gas,” extensively quotes Scott R. Reeves,
a well-known authority on this subject,
from an earlier conference in Houston
and gives a good history of the development of unconventional gas.24 In
particular, it covers CBM from the early
1980s to the early 1990s as a major
supply source thanks to Section 29
federal tax credits and research by DOE
and the Gas Research Institute (GRI).

of Mines, Potential Gas Agency, in its
biannual estimates of total US potential gas resources arrived at a Dec. 31,
2004, mean value of 1,119.255 tcf,
including CBM, but excluding proved
reserves.15 They also updated cumulative production to 1,053 tcf.26 Adding
Dec.31, 2004, proved reserves of 192.5
tcf for the US, including Alaska, results
in a total original resource of 2,365 tcf
(Table 10).15
Assuming a symmetrical bell-shaped
(logistic) curve of annual production
as Hubbert proposed,7 with the area
under the curve representing ultimately
recoverable resources, the peak production would be reached at the midpoint
of cumulative production, or 2,365/2
= 1,183 tcf. Less 1,053 tcf cumulative
production as of Dec. 31, 2004, leaves
only 130 tcf of cumulative production
before annual production declines.
At the current annual US natural
gas production of 19 tcf/year,27 there
would remain only 7 years before US
natural gas production would plateau.
This technique of projecting peak
production in a given producing area
is highly questionable because it does
not take into account technology advances, such as increased CBM and new
methane hydrate production, nor does
it reflect the new, more-liberal state
and federal leasing policies for offshore
conventional gas production.

New federal pipeline safety legislation is overdue and should be passed
before the end of the year, witnesses

hearing before the Senate Commerce,

Science, and Transportation Committee.
“We need to enact pipeline safety

end of this Congress,” urged Tim Felt,
president and chief executive of Explorer Pipeline in Tulsa. “A lot of work has
gone into the current bills, and there
are no major disagreements about what

a compromise should look like,” he
said, “Let’s get a good bill passed now.”
Committee chairman Ted Stevens (RAlaska) responded: “We’re going to do

he said as the hearing ended about 90
minutes later.
Prospects for sending a completed
bill to the White House during 2006
aren’t good because Stevens’s committee has yet to mark up its bill, S.
3961, and send it to the Senate floor for
final passage. It would then move to a
conference involving House bill, H.R.
5782, and the administration’s original proposals contained in H.R. 5678,
unless a more expeditious procedure
emerged.
“We understand that some efforts
are being made to reconcile differences
among the bills at the committee level,
with the hope that a single proposal
could be voted on in both houses
before the end of the session,” said
Thomas J. Barrett, who heads the US
Department of Transportation’s Pipeline

Carl Weimer, executive director of

Venture seeks better seismic imaging of deep prospects
Alan Petzet
Chief Editor-Exploration
A partnership led by Repsol YPF SA
has launched a project to apply unprecedented computing power to geophysics to reduce the risk in exploration of
deep subsalt prospects under ultradeep
water of the Gulf of Mexico.
Repsol YPF said the partnership gives
it exclusive or privileged access to the
know-how it needs to combine for the
first time the hardware and software
necessary to commercially image struc30

tures that, at more than 40,000 ft, are
impossible to resolve on today’s best 3D
seismic data.
The company said it is pursuing the
“full realization of the next generation of seismic imaging technology,
including a specialized technique called
reverse time migration (RTM), that will
accelerate and streamline oil and gas
exploration by several orders of magnitude compared to current industry
standards.”
Joining Repsol YPF in the Kalei-

doscope Project are 3DGeo Development Inc., a private Houston imaging
company formed by Stanford University
associate professor and seismic imaging
pioneer Biondo Biondi, and the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC),
owned by the government of Spain.
3DGeo will open a Barcelona office.
Repsol YPF also has joined the university’s Stanford Exploration Project, an
industry-funded academic consortium
aimed at improving the theory and
practice of constructing 3D and 4D images of the earth from echo soundings.

Applying RTM
Industry has known of the RTM
technique since the 1970s, but the
computer power necessary to perform
it profitably and apply it widely has not
been available, said Francisco Ortigosa
of Houston, Repsol YPF’s chief geophysicist and Kaleidoscope project leader.
The technique involves the fast Fourier transform of 3D data sets, which
requires computing power many times
greater than what is in use in exploration today, Ortigosa said.
“We can realistically say that we will
reach speeds fast enough to make RTM
a routine processing [step] in exploration and not something for special
processing. If we achieve RTM with the
productivities of salt profile migration,
we will be satisfied,” he said.
The cost of supercomputers based
on IBM Corp.’s Cell Broadband Engine
(BE) processor may also decline because
the gaming industry plans to produce
millions of similar processors, Ortigosa
added.
The partnership gives Repsol YPF exclusive access to the three key components of advanced seismic imaging.
These are: the RTM codes or algorithms through the company’s
relationship with the pioneers of the
technology; privileged access through
the Barcelona center to Cell BE-based
systems; and exclusive access to the
center’s research experience and the

MareNostrum supercomputer.
MareNostrum, developed by IBM, is
the world’s fifth most powerful supercomputer. Public benchmarks show
that the Cell BE processors perform the
computation of fast Fourier transforms
40 times faster than the leading brand
processors, Repsol YPF said.
Biondi said, “3DGeo will develop a
suite of production-ready high-end imaging applications that implement the
most advanced algorithms developed at
3DGeo, at Stanford, and in the industry,
culminating with heretofore unimplemented cutting-edge, full-wavefield
imaging techniques.
“Testing of these new compute-intensive imaging algorithms will benefit
from the exceptional computational capabilities available at the MareNostrum
supercomputer center in Barcelona, and
with BSC’s vast experience in computer
architecture and parallelization.”
The imaging development effort will
require extensive testing and trial runs
of challenging 3D data sets. The development and testing will be conducted
at the MareNostrum supercomputer
center by 3DGeo personnel working in
conjunction with Repsol YPF and BSC
personnel.

The project
Kaleidoscope “brings together the
necessary components of modeling,
algorithms, and the uniquely powerful

computing power of the MareNostrum
supercomputer to realize the promise
of RTM and incorporate it into daily
processing flows,” Repsol YPF said.
The process integrates steps traditionally taken sequentially, Ortigosa said.
3DGeo is one of the pioneers in
wave-equation migration and velocitymodel building. The Barcelona center
has vast experience in computer architecture and in parallelization for the Cell
BE processor.
Biondi said, “We estimate that this
solution will accelerate seismic imaging
by several orders of magnitude compared to conventional solutions running
on standard Linux clusters.”
First deployment of RTM in the gulf
could come as early as the end of the
first quarter of 2007. The partnership
is initially chartered for 5 years but is
meant to develop into a long-term relationship as other technology challenges
emerge, Ortigosa said. Eventually RTM
could have application off West Africa
and Brazil, he added.
Repsol YPF operates 45 of the 85
exploration blocks in which it holds
interests in the gulf, where it has been
a player since 2002. The blocks are in
Green Canyon, Atwater Valley, Alaminos
Canyon, and Mississippi Canyon. The
company’s first important gulf production is to start in 2007 at a net 7,500

CERA study: Oil production to track ‘undulating plateau’
The “peak oil” theory, stipulating
that world oil production will soon
peak and sharply decline, is flawed,
according to an analysis by Cambridge
Energy Research Associates (CERA).
Instead of a peak, CERA says, production is more likely to trace an “undulating plateau” that will last for a decade
or more beyond 2030. The report
added that during later decades of the
plateau period, unconventional production of heavy oil, gas-related liquids
(condensate and natural gas liquids),
32

gas-to-liquids, and coal-to-liquids will
supplement traditional liquids supply.
“It is likely that the situation will
unfold in slow motion and that there
are a number of decades to prepare for
the start of the undulating plateau. This
means that there is time to consider the
best way to develop viable energy alternatives that would eventually provide
the bulk of our transport energy needs
and ensure that there is a useable production stream of conventional crude
for some time to come,” CERA said.

Peter M. Jackson, CERA director of
oil industry activity, said, “The ‘peak oil’
theory causes confusion and can lead to
inappropriate actions and turn attention
away from the real issues.”
He added, “Oil is too critical to the
global economy to allow fear to replace
careful analysis about the very real challenges with delivering liquid fuels to
meet the needs of growing economies.
This is a very important debate, and as
such it deserves a rational and measured
discourse.”

Hubbert analysis
The CERA report contends that the
often-cited Hubbert model, which patterns production as a bell curve, fails to
recognize that recoverable reserve estimates evolve with time and are subject
to significant change. The model also
underplays the impact of technological
advances.
Although M. King Hubbert accurately predicted timing of the peak in US
Lower 48 oil production in 1970, the

CERA study says, he underestimated the
peak rate by 20% and total cumulative
Lower 48 production during 19702005 by 15 billion bbl.
Hubbert’s symmetrical post-peak
reservoir decline-curve assumptions
also fail to match observations of typical
oil-field production profiles, which are
often asymmetrical, even without new
technology or enhanced recovery.
The CERA report also challenges the
peak-oil theory’s reliance on assertions

that new discoveries aren’t replacing production. It calls the argument
“incomplete,” saying it ignores the role
of development and economic considerations that can encourage companies
and governments to favor development
over exploration.
CERA’s report contends that it is not
reservoir constraints but aboveground
factors such as geopolitics, conflict, economics, and technology that will dictate
future oil supply.✦

“If we are to leave our children
a world that resembles the earth we
inherited, we must act now to address
[greenhouse gas] emissions. When the
100th Congress begins in January, we
pledge to work to pass an effective system of mandatory limits on greenhouse
gases,” they wrote in a letter to Bush.
Bingaman will chair the Energy and

global warming.
“Unfortunately, we are not satisfied
with the level of US participation in the
international negotiations and in reducing our own domestic [GHG] emissions. Therefore, as incoming chairs of
three important Senate committees on
global warming, we seek your commitment to work with the new Congress to
pass meaningful climate change legislation in 2007,” the senators wrote Bush.
They and other Senate Democrats

have repeatedly said the Bush administration and the Republican congressional leadership have not taken climate

The three senators said they have
written or cosponsored legislation to
combat global warming.
“Although our approaches differ
slightly, we—along with the overwhelming majority of the scientific
community—agree that human-caused
global warming is real and that we

Serica-BG exchange assets

JMG was formed in late 2004 and
taken public last year. JED said the
acquisition was called off because of
changes in both companies and in
general market conditions since a letter
of intent was signed (OGJ, Apr. 3, 2006,

JED has concentrated on development drilling, and JMG on exploration
in western Canada and the US, both
working closely with Enterra Energy
Trust, an oil and gas income trust set up
in 2003.

Serica is operator and 50% interest
owner of Block 23/16f, on which it is
currently drilling the Columbus prospect. BG has an equity holding in part
of the adjacent Block 23/21 (Part Block
23/21) into which Serica believes the
Columbus prospect may extend.
Serica and BG have entered into a
cross-assignment agreement that provides, in certain specific circumstances,
for Serica to exchange with BG a 25%
interest in Block 23/16f for a 25%
interest in Part Block 23/21, excluding Lomond field. The agreement also

WORLD

A new desert
energy source

“H

e had been eight years upon a project
for extracting sunbeams out of
cucumbers...”
—Jonathan Swift, from Gulliver’s Travels
Chinese Petroleum Corp. Gen.
Manager Chen Pao-lang last week returned to Taiwan from a 13-day trip
to Libya, where—supposedly—he
was laying the groundwork for a bid
to explore for oil.
CPC was pretty tight-lipped over
what Chen actually did in Libya,
saying only it would provide more
information about his trip to Libya
after he had come back.
A day earlier, CPC Chairman Pan
Wenent said, “CPC is preparing to
bid for oil exploration rights in Libya
this December, and hopefully the
CPC can win the bid to explore more
crude oil resources.”
We have our doubts about that. We
believe CPC officials were in Libya for
the sunshine. We are not suggesting
they went there on vacation. We think
they went there in connection with
sunshine as a source of energy.

Smoke and mirrors
We were alerted to this possibility
by the publication of a report commissioned by the German government, which found that solar energy
from North Africa could help reduce
emissions from European power stations by 70% by 2050.
Franz Trieb of the Trans-Mediterranean Renewable Energy Cooperation (TREC), who also works for the
German Center for Air and Space
Technology, gave the upbeat side of
the report.
“Every year, each square kilometer of desert receives solar energy
36

equivalent to 1.5 million bbl of oil,”
he said. “Multiplying by the area
of deserts worldwide, this is nearly
1,000 times the current energy consumption of the world.”
He added, “We can tap into this
energy by using mirrors to concentrate sunlight and create heat to drive
a generator.”
The German expert envisages the
use of concentrating solar power
(CSP) systems—in which mirrors
focus sunlight on a boiler to create
steam that drives a turbine—and
transporting the electricity produced
on a vast network of highly efficient
power lines.

Sunshine from cucumbers
The real eye catcher, though, is
price. Trieb said it costs about $50
for a CSP plant to produce the same
amount of energy as contained in a
barrel of oil, but he said this figure
was “likely” to fall to around $20—a
likelihood he did not explain in
detail.
Gerry Wolff, of TREC-UK, said:
“Many people are saying there is not
enough renewable energy and that
we’ve got to have nuclear power. This
report shows that’s absolute nonsense.” Of course it is.
Wolff also said there would be
“fascinating spin-off benefits” for
North African countries beyond the
money from supplying Europe with
electricity. He said waste heat could
be used to desalinate seawater, while
the mirrors would provide shade to
grow plants, like cucumbers.
Enter the Taiwanese, who, we suspect, were consulted on the best ways
of putting the squeeze on those cucumbers for even more sunshine. ✦

Serica Chief Executive Paul Ellis
said, “If Columbus is successful, the
prospective common interests of Serica
and BG in Blocks 23/16f and 23/21
will enable appraisal wells to be drilled
and the development of any discovery
to be commenced in the most efficient
manner.”

Petro-Canada divestiture
Petro-Canada’s properties to be
divested are Chard, Stony Mountain,
Liege, Thornbury, and Ipiatik. PetroCanada’s interest in these properties is
estimated to cover 1.7 billion bbl of
bitumen.
Petro-Canada opened a data room
Nov. 20. It hired Harrison Lovegrove,
London, to manage the auction.
“Over the next 10 years or so,
we’ll be focusing all of our efforts on
developing Fort Hills and our in situ
properties of MacKay River, Lewis, and
Meadow Creek,” said Neil Camarta,
Petro-Canada’s senior vice-president, oil
sands.
With this sale, Petro-Canada has an
estimated 3 billion bbl of total bitumen
resource at Syncrude and Fort Hills and
more than 5 billion bbl in the in situ
properties at MacKay River, Lewis, and
Meadow Creek.
The company had earlier reported
plans to submit a commercial application for the Fort Hills project by
yearend, with a regulatory decision
expected by late 2007 to be followed
by construction lasting 3 years and oil
production starting in 2011.
An expansion at MacKay River, by
2010, will increase production by
40,000 b/d, the company said.
It has evaluated 130 wells on its
Lewis lease, as many as eight wells per
section in some areas. Canadian sections
are 1 mile square.
It also has delineated the Meadow
Creek lease with eight wells per section.
For both Lewis and Meadow Creek,
Petro-Canada has not announced a definite timetable for initiating production
(OGJ Online, Sept. 25, 2006). ✦

Deepwater projects typically face
technical and financial challenges to
their viability. Such challenges are now
increasingly significant for operators,
consultants, and contractors as exploration moves into ever deeper water.
It is essential that these challenges
are assessed, mitigated, and managed throughout project execution by
selecting appropriate field development
plans, risk management, and modifying project implementation methods. A
clear understanding of risks throughout
project execution is a key component of
deepwater development.
The aims of this two-part article are
to provide an insight into the various
risks involved in deepwater field development as well as to help engineers and
managers develop strategic risk management models.

• Long lead times for spares and
installation resources.
• High consequences of operational
failure.
• Flow assurance.
• Fabrication, installation, and
operation in new deepwater frontier
basins.
• Deepwater development may be
located in countries with high political
instability.
Deepwater developments require
large reserves, and the total number of
wells needs to be kept small in order
to make the project economically viable. The drilling capex can be typically
in excess of 50% of the total capital
expenditure. Hence, the oil recovery
per well needs to be high along with a
high production rate per well, typically
10,000-15,000 b/d of oil.
Today’s deepwater completions must
maximize ultimate recovery for projects to be economically viable. Newly
discovered deepwater reservoirs are
capable of high flow rates, and the wells
must be designed accordingly.
The cost and inaccessibility of
deepwater subsea wells also require the
industry to rely heavily on new technology to optimize the capital expenses
on projects. Completion design and
equipment reliability are critical to
the success of a development. While
new technology is essential, there are
risks in using technology that has not
been rigorously tested for reliability in
the environments in which it is being
deployed.
Reliability problems during the
life of a well show up in the form of
reentry and workovers, which must be
minimized to achieve project economics. Problems may result in formation
damage, lost reserves, safety, and environmental exposure.2
A project risk management methodology addresses the management of
uncertainties at different project phases
depending on the level of information
that is available and the type of decisions to be made.1
Effectively understanding risk is all
about moving up the learning curve
and being in a position to make in38

formed decisions (Fig. 1). However, in
the project-managed field development
context some key decisions must be
made early in the planning process if
they are to ultimately influence project
schedules and costs (Fig. 2).
Figs. 1 and 2 show that risk management is a crucial early phase activity in
the project cycle if we are to reap the
benefits of the knowledge it provides in
time to inform decisions that will prove
crucial in the ultimate cost, time, and
quality performance of a project. The
importance and urgency of risk management in deepwater projects cannot
therefore be overestimated.
On technically complex deepwater
projects that require large sums of capital expended over long periods of time,
there is no substitute for closely monitoring costs, assessing financial risks,
and implementing mitigation plans
based on robust decision intelligence as
early as possible in the project. Yale and
Knudsen3 illustrate how the influence of
strategic planning and risk assessment
on project expenditures decreases over
time using cost-risk analysis performed
on a midsize subsea tieback project in
the Gulf of Mexico.
Oil and gas exploration and exploitation is generally a high-risk but highly
rewarding business. The uncertainties
with regard to the presence and quantities of recoverable reserves, the cost of
developing reservoirs, and the product
prices are enormous. Cost-risk curves
demonstrate that investment in reservoir identification and delineation, plus
early engineering studies, are the best
way to mitigate risks. The risks may be
broadly classified4 as:
1. Revenue risks: uncertainties in the
quantity of recoverable reserves (initial-oil-in-place and recovery factor),
the rate of recovery (plateau rate, early
production, etc.), and the product price
(oil and gas sales price).
2. Cost risks: uncertainties related to
the cost of developing the field through
the value chain and the income recovered at market prices.
Technological risks can be considered a third type of risk. However,
the use of new technology is consid-

ered either to reduce costs relative to
traditional technology or increase the
uncertainty and potentially the costs on
the performance and reliability of the
new technology.
Technology risk is therefore in this
discussion included as a cost risk. An
offshore development project generally
goes through three distinct phases:4
1. The exploration phase, in which
the focus is on revenue risk, i.e.,
determining the reservoir production
potential.
2. The development phase, during
which most of the investment takes
place, focuses on the cost risk and the
technology needed to develop the field
in an economically robust manner.
3. The production phase, during
which the revenue risk is represented
by the product price and the production profile.
Deepwater project revenue and cost
risks are influenced by the following factors: field reserves; reservoir
complexity; development design and
engineering; oil and gas price volatility;
drilling and well completions; subsea
infrastructure, flowlines, and risers;
processing facilities and support structures; transportation and storage; and
project schedule.
The risks can, to a certain degree,
be managed and mitigated by selection
of different field development plans, as
well as project implementation methods.4 Under discussion of each type of
risk, the potential for risk mitigation
will be briefly addressed.
Risks that are specific to deepwater developments and to the specific
technology that can mitigate them
are identified in more detail. It is also
essential to take a broader and more
holistic view of risk (including opportunity) that goes beyond the subsurface,
technological, and project risks when
assessing project feasibilities. Fig. 3 illustrates the spectrum of risks that oil
and gas projects encounter and must
accommodate.
While our focus here is upon the
technical and project risks that are most
readily managed from an engineering perspective there is no doubt that

risk management has to go beyond the engineering level. The
more holistic approaches to risk are beyond the scope of this
article but are covered elsewhere.5 6
It is impossible to identify and mitigate against all facets
of risk, but it helps to be aware of as many as possible and
formulate contingency plans and strategies.
Project risk management can employ a range of analytical techniques and software. There is no one right way to do
it but plenty of inconsistent and haphazard approaches that
hinder rather than help in risk management. The key is to be
systematic and consistent.

Development framework
A stages and gates approach (Fig. 4) to the project management of oil and gas field and facilities emphasizes the importance of the planning stages (feasibility, FEED) leading into
engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contracting, construction and fabrication activity, on to HAZOP and
ultimately plant commissioning.
To move from one stage to another requires a gate to be
passed where decisions and approvals have to be made associated with funding, technical design, and project priority. Such
approvals are usually structured in the form of authorities for
expenditure (AFEs) to be signed-off by the project owners
(and often other stakeholders—e.g., government authorities)
as positive approval to proceed under stages of a project budget. Although the diagram for simplicity suggests a linear process proceeding from one stage to another, in practice there
are often loops and feedbacks to the work of earlier stages that
require adjustments to design, etc.

Design criteria and options
Design criteria must be robust and flexible, with the development concept demonstrating operating flexibility and operability. It should include the establishment and management
of a facilities weight budget and address how the facilities are
to be controlled.
A key pre-FEED question is how much redundancy is
needed to accommodate potential production capacity expansion? A high degree of redundancy automatically entails a
high degree of complexity.
Some design tradeoffs in a field development framework
can substantially impact the weight of the structure, (e.g., dual
versus single process trains) with negative weight gains, but
positive flexibility gains. In general terms, to reduce the total
installed capital cost of an offshore facility; it should be made
smaller and lighter.
The skidded or modular approach is common in the Gulf
of Mexico, where there is an abundance of quality speciality
fabricators in the region. While adding weight, modular construction can have overall benefits to the project in terms of
distributing the project workforce, improving the competitive
bidding process and quality of the facilities and dramatically
shortening fabrication schedules.
Offshore processing can be prohibitively expensive. In

extremely remote locations it may be
the only option but, depending on the
distance to shore, a subsea development
may be the least expensive solution for
gas field developments.
Tying back deepwater subsea field
developments long distances to shallow
water or even to shore is becoming an
increasingly attractive design option in
some areas. For example, in the Gulf of
Mexico, Mensa field developed by Shell
in 1,600 m of water is quite an innovative development with subsea wells
tied back 100 km to a shallow water
platform, West Delta 143.
Giant Ormen Lange gas field in 8001,200 m of water in the Norwegian
North Sea lies 140 km west of Kris40

tiansund and is being developed with a
subsea template linked to shore-based
processing facilities. Farther north, in
the Barents Sea, the Snohvit gas field
complex is also being developed with
subsea facilities to a land-based LNG
facility under construction. Such a
design concept is being considered for
the Shtokman field 560 km north of
Murmansk in the Russian Barents Sea.
Scarab and Saffron gas fields form
part of the West Delta Deep development in 650 m of water 90 km off
Egypt. They were also developed using
subsea manifolds with wells tied in and
lines to shore. This development came
on-stream in 2003. Popular design
concepts for fields in hostile and remote

(including deepwater) environments
are to exploit subsea technology with
pipelines to shore where possible.
Understanding how the risks and
technical challenges (discussed below)
fit and are to be addressed within the
field development project framework
and with specific design concepts are
essential to achieving projects on-time
and within budget without major
surprises and to mitigate threats and
exploit opportunities.

The reservoir size field reserves
pose the fundamental technical aspect
to revenue risk. Reservoir complexity,
depth, and remoteness from existing
infrastructure are the major factors that
influence cost risk. Reservoir models
that link engineering and 3D seismic
data sets help mitigate risk by optimizing reserves recovery through careful
well location and spacing.
Some reservoir types, such as narrow channels, can be hard to resolve
which means that such models are far
from foolproof. Invariably reservoir
characteristic assumptions used at the
planning stage differ from those that
manifest themselves during a field’s
production life.4 Post first oil production, reservoir dynamic behavior determines reserves size.

costly to drill with fewer contractors
offering proven capabilities.
International deepwater wells frequently cost more than $25 million to
drill and complete. In such cases technologies and models that facilitate increased recovery from individual wells
and enable a reduction in the number
of wells can offer huge cost and risk
reduction benefits.
Cromb2 was adamant: “Complex
drilling/completion systems should
not be acceptable for subsea equipment—period.” To ignore this undoubtedly increases risk and cost over the life
of the well, which invariably offset any
engineering gains made by doing so.
Technological demands that are
frequently crucial for deepwater drilling
are:
• Drilling of extended reach and
multilateral wells.
• Drilling and completion of wells
in deep and ultradeep water, especially
using smart/slender wells and underbalanced drilling.
42

• Design, construction and installation of lighter and smaller subsea
equipment for ultradeep water.
Plans that call for fewer deepwater
wells (assuming higher unit recovery
can be achieved from each well) are
an obvious way to try to reduce capital
and operating cost requirements. With a
good reservoir and model, it should be
possible to optimally locate wells and
by employing large-offset subsea wells
the total number of wells (and floating
facilities) can be reduced.

Flowlines and risers
Long-reach satellite developments
(more than 100 km in some cases) of
fields in deep and ultradeep water rely
heavily on flowlines and risers to make
production possible.
The maintenance and integrity of
these facilities is a risk and a cost that
cannot be ignored for deepwater fields.
Generic characteristics of deepwater
fields include:
• Remote locations.

• Deep columns of cold water with
strong ocean currents.
• Limited or difficult to access infrastructure.
• Complex supply, manpower, and
service logistics.
• Costly support vessels.
• Long flowline tiebacks to floating
production and storage systems from
outlying wells.
Flow assurance is critical for flowlines and risers in deep and cold water
and can be costly. Blockages due to
wax, hydrates, and sand can shut down
production and be expensive to remedy
unless remedial measures are designed
into the facilities.
Potential multifunction of risers,
flowlines, and umbilical cables are
undoubtedly some of the most critical
concerns associated with equipment
components of the floating production
systems being developed for ultradeep
water field developments.4

in deepwater projects. ✦

ditional wells to come later. Anadarko
expects production from each well
initially to be 50-70 MMcfd. All wells
target Miocene reservoirs.
The Transocean Deepwater Millennium and the Noble Amos Runner are
the two rigs currently completing the
predrilled wells. FMC provided the subsea wellheads and manifolds.
The 10 fields initially will have the
following number of wells (Fig. 5).
• Atlas, 1.
• Atlas NW, 1.
• Jubilee, 2.
• Merganser, 2.
• San Jacinto, 2.
• Spiderman, 3.
• Vortex, 1.
• Mondo NW, 1.
• Cheyenne, 1.
• Q, 1.
The wells include a mix of single,
two, and three-zone completions.
Anadarko wells are cased and perforated and completed with frac packs
of 40-80,000 lb of 30/50 lightweight
ceramic proppant and 8-gauge wirewrapped screens.
The wells incorporate multiphase
metering technology and other sensors
downhole, incorporating sand detection technology, and developing an
intelligent downhole instrumentation
network of sensors (OGJ, Feb. 27, 2006,
p. 51).
The fields include Roxar’s wet-gas
meters for integrating different well
streams from the multiple fields. Roxar
says the meters allow accurate detection
and measurement in real-time of the
hydrocarbon flow rates and water production as well as flow-assurance input
through the meters’ online detection of
formation water.
In Anadarko’s operated fields, six
wells have smart completions. Four
wells have two completed zones while
the remaining two have three zones
completed.
Baker Oil Tools said the wells include
its intelligent wells systems (IWS)
placed in wells in 8,000 ft of water, the
deepest water depth to date. The long
93-ft single subassembly included three

IWS lines, one tubing-encased conductor (TEC) line, and two chemical injection lines.
Anadarko described a Spiderman
three-zone well as having “smart”
completions on two zones that would
allow control of the zones from surface,
while the middle zone would require
rig intervention to open or close.
Anadarko said the wells are completed with either 51⁄2-in. or 41⁄2-in.
13-chrome tubing because of the CO2
content in the gas. The fields do not

Wellhead shut-in pressure is about
6,000 psi, and the bottomhole shut-in
pressures are 7,900-8,700 psi. Bottomhold temperatures are 132-172º F.

Pipeline
The Independence Trail Natural Gas
Pipeline is a wholly owned affiliate of
Enterprise Products Partners LP. The
134 mile, 24-in. pipeline connects the
Independence Hub Mexico to an interconnect with Tennessee Gas Pipeline in
West Delta Block 68. The West Delta 68
jacket was installed in July 2006 with
the topsides integration taking place in
October. The jacket is in 115 ft of water.
Topsides weight is 850 tons and jacket
weight is 350 tons
Allseas Solitaire completed the S-lay
of the pipeline in August 2006 (Fig. 6).
The pipeline has a maximum operating pressure of 3,640 psi and a capacity
of 1 bcfd. It has two subsea dual tees
of 16-in. and 12-in. in water depths of
about 6,500 and 4,500 ft, respectively,
for future tie ins.
The 24-in. line consists of API 5L
X-65 DSAW (double submerged arc
welded) pipe coated with 14-16 mils
thin film fusion-bonded epoxy (FBE)
and an additional 2-3 mils rough coat
FBE. Wall thickness and bare weight in

• 1.350-in. WT, 326.9 lb/ft.
• 1.220-in. WT, 297.1 lb/ft.
• 1.070-in. WT, 262.3 lb/ft.

2001 presentation
The WSOG process and
wider verification model was
presented at the International
Association of Drilling Contractors Northern Deepwater
conference in Stavanger,
May 2001. The technical
paper presented at IADC
used case studies to show
how different oil companies
and drilling contractors are
adopting the processes begun
in Norway for the benefit of
proving an effective operational risk management case
for their DP operations.
The WSOG model form
has had a significant influence worldwide. In 2004,
det Norske Veritas prepared
a report for the US Minerals
Management Service titled,
“Guidance on safety of well
testing.”2 The report includes reference
to WSOG in the form presently used.
Many operators—Shell/Enterprise,
BP, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Marathon, Amerada Hess, Elf Exploration
Angola, Woodside, BHP Billiton, and
Apache Corp.—have made use of the
WSOG form during their drilling campaigns. A number of drilling contractors
have also adopted this process, in one
form or another, in their DP operations
manuals (Fig. 4).

Additional uses of WSOG
The WSOG alert and reporting protocol is being used on well-intervention units Regalia, Seawell, and Island
Frontier, working for Statoil in the
North Sea.
The DP floatel industry in the
Norwegian sector of the North Sea
has developed FOGS (floatel operating
guidelines) along the same principles as

place before each well (even if everything is the same). The limit setting exercise should involve, as far as possible,
personnel who have working knowledge of the rigs operating criteria. The
supply of experienced and competent
crew is central here and further reenforces worries in the industry.
There must be consensus following
the WSOG limit setting exercise and
sign-off.
In the US Gulf of Mexico, some
operators view advisories as crucial,
therefore fundamentally supporting the
use of WSOG.
WSOG clearly works equally well
with drillships and semisubmersible
drilling units and has also been introduced in nondrilling DP sectors such
as the floatel market. Norway is even
advancing the WSOG concept for use in
moored operations as an early warning
HAZOP process.
History has shown that having a mature WSOG system aboard will satisfy
oil operator’s and regulator’s verification processes. There has been wide use
of this simple form since 1999, suggesting that the process works. ✦

that the current slowdown in demand
growth is temporary and growth will
“rebound to the level of the historical
average amid the region’s strong economic conditions.”

High oil prices

There are two major reasons for the
sudden slowdown in Asia-Pacific’s oil
demand growth, according to the study.
First, although oil prices have been rising during the past few years, oil prices
stayed at the historically highest levels
ever (in nominal terms) in second-half

market distortions. Because the government-regulated domestic product
prices in China are still lower than
international market prices, subsidies
give incentives to China’s refiners and
wholesalers to export or smuggle oil
products abroad to reap higher profits,
despite the economy’s needing them
for growth, thus resulting in product
shortages.
For example, truckers and other diesel consumers in Hong Kong purchased
diesel in Guangdong, China, which led
to an overall decline in Hong Kong’s
diesel consumption of 34,000 b/d in
2005. A net result was that Hong Kong’s
overall demand declined by about
20,000 b/d in 2005, according to the
study.
In 2006, the price imbalance
between mainland China and Hong
Kong will fall. The decline in Hong
Kong’s diesel demand will be offset by
a rebounding of diesel demand (about
11,000 b/d) in 2006.

PIPELINE FAILURE
RATES—CONCLUSION

This concluding part
of an article exploring a
model for reducing statistical uncertainty when
pooling pipeline data
Pipelines
applies Part 1’s methodology to actual pipelinefailure data compiled by the US Office
of Pipeline Safety (OPS) 1994-2005. It
also applies the methodology to estimate the failure rates in
multiple onshore pipeline systems in Southern
Mexico, for which failure
data were gathered 19952004.
Pipeline reliability
analyses struggle between
the need to increase the number of
km-years from which failure data are
gathered in an effort to reduce statistical
uncertainty and the need to avoid statistical uncertainties caused by pooling
disparate data.
Part 1 of this article described a usable method for considering both the
statistical and tolerance uncertainties of
merged data to produce more accurate
reliability predictions (OGJ, Sept. 25,
2006, p. 64).The methodology Part 1
outlined should be able to address failure processes with constant and timedependent rates, test whether pooling
of failure data across systems can occur,
and reduce the statistical uncertainties

in the estimation.
The primary pipeline attribute
considered by this article is location of
facilities. Future studies will analyze annual failure rates in terms of diameter,
wall thickness, stress level, and age.
This article first applies Part 1’s
methodology to pipeline failure data
reported by the OPS. A homogeneous
Poisson process [HPP] model calculates
the average failure rates and confidence
intervals, leading to the functional
form (Power Law Process) of the failure
intensity and identifying data that can
be merged under both assumptions. The
article will next apply the same procedure to the Mexican data.

System identiﬁcation, statistics
The information reported by OPS
identifies 10 clearly defined US systems
according to location: 5 gas transmission pipeline systems in the southern
region (S), southwest region (SW),
western region (W), center region (C),
and eastern region (E); and 5 oil transmission systems in the same regions.
The states which comprise each of these
systems can be determined from the
OPS web page.1
This article focuses on two failure
causes: external corrosion (EC) and
third-party damage (TPD), two of the
three leading causes of incidents in the
US (along with internal corrosion; IC).

failure rate for external corrosion equal
to 1.5 × 10–5 km-year and a corresponding estimation for third-party
damage of 4.2 × 10–5 km-year. Both
failure causes allow postulation of a reduction in failure rate from one period
to the other.
Applying the Fisher (F) test (Equation 2) to this case demonstrates that
the data collected for these two time
periods cannot be merged. The P-value
associated with rejecting the null hypothesis H0: λ1 = λ2 is less than 0.1%,
meaning that the reduction in the average failure rate with time is statistically
significant at 95% confidence. Better

ability of these pipelines.
Equation 3 fits the data to the law,
and the 95% confidence for the calculated shape parameter β was calculated
and then used to test the adequacy
of the homogeneous Poisson process
against the power law model (PLP).
Equation 4 shows the final expressions
for the cumulative number of failures
for TPD and EC.
Formally applying the homogeneity
test (Equation 5) to the data corroborates the trends observed in Fig. 2 and
allows for rejection of the null hypothesis H0: β = 1 for external corrosion
with α = 0.05. The null hypothesis
cannot be rejected at the chosen significance level for TPD.
Strong evidence exists against the
hypothesis that failures due to EC occur
with constant failure rate, while the opposite holds true for TPD.

changes in pipeline safety regulations,
and new reporting criteria for incidents
are among the possible explanations for
this change.

NHPP analysis
Incidents due to external corrosion
reduce pipeline reliability. A nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) can
model corrosion-related processes. Fig.
2 shows the relationship of the cumulative number of incidents to their years
of occurrence for gas transmission
pipelines. Data analysis suggests that
failures produced by third-party damage have a constant failure rate, while
external corrosion deteriorates the reli-

Assuming HPP, Equations 2, 6, and
7 test if data from different systems
can be aggregated. The assumption
that the five OPS systems follow NHPP
determined the applicability of pooling
their failure data. The time evolution of
failures suggests that, regarding external
corrosion, the five OPS regions suffer
from deteriorating reliability with different trends. Fig. 3 checks the parameters of the power law process for the
analyzed regions. The southwest region
follows a different deteriorating process
from the others.
Applying the homogeneity test and
statistical test (Equation 5 and Equations
8-10) corroborates the gathered data
formally. The null hypothesis, H0: β =
1, can be rejected for the five systems
with a 5% confidence level (Table 1).
The null hypothesis H0: β1 = β2=...β5
cannot be rejected at a 5% significance
level (Equation 8), but the hypothesis
H0: λ1 = λ2=...λ5 can be rejected at the
chosen significance level. Doing so allows the failure rates of these systems to
be treated as identical.
Data corroborated that failure rates
due to TPF were improving in the

Average failure rates
The assumption that the reported
incidents follow homogeneous Poisson processes provided the basis for
1995-2004 average failure-rate estimates associated with the failure causes
for the five systems. This stage of the
analysis used Equations 1, 12, and 13,
computing confidence intervals (CI) for
a 5% significance level with the error of
estimation. Table 2 shows the results of
the estimations for the two gas systems
(AG and BG).
In agreement with Fig. 4, corrosion-related incidents show the highest failure rate in these systems, while
incidents due to mechanical damage
show the lowest rate. MD, however, also
has the largest statistical uncertainty,
likely due to the small number of incidents reported for this cause during the
observation period.
Table 2 gives failure-rate values larger
than those previously published.2 3 The
majority of the reported incidents
studied here are small leaks, leading to
larger failure rate values, while previous
works focused on large leaks and ruptures.3 Table 2’s results allow identification of unreliable estimates as measured
by the width of the prediction’s confidence intervals.
Examples of inaccurate estimates
include those produced for mechanical
damage in systems AG and BG.

Merging the failure data gathered for

of the homogenous Poisson process
against the power model.
Table 4 shows the results of this
analysis, distinguishing the pipeline
systems that follow a power law process
from those that are best modeled by a
homogeneous (stationary, with β = 1)
Poisson process. The power law model
allows corroboration of systems both
in which maintenance has not been adequate to avoid reliability deterioration
(β > 1) and in which maintenance has
lead to reliability improvement (β < 1).
Fig. 5 shows the time evolution
of the cumulative number of failures
caused by external corrosion in the BG
system. It also plots the intensity function for the AG system, which shows
stationary behavior.
Table 4 also identifies the failure
datasets that follow a power law process
and could be merged following the
methods outlined in Part 1 to reduce
the statistical uncertainty associated
with the estimation of the corresponding failure intensity function. Analysis
of this information reveals that the
only possibility is to test whether the
failure data gathered in the gas pipeline
systems for EC-caused incidents can be
merged.
Equations 16 and 17 tested gas
pipeline systems AG and BG (numbered
1 and 2, respectively). This computation
scheme found N1(Texp) = 23, N2(Texp) =
32, and the experimental statistics Fβ
= 0.91 (Equation 16), concluding that
there are no arguments to reject the hypothesis that the shape parameters (β’s)
are equal at the 5% significance level.
In a second step, Equation 17 investigated if the failure intensity function

of the two systems could be assumed
to follow the same power law. The value
of the experimental statistic was found
to be 0.36, leading to acceptance of the
hypothesis that the failures caused by
EC in the two gas pipelines systems follow the same power law process, with
intensity (λ(t) = (4.4 × 10–4)t0.598)/
km-year.
This prediction has a reduced statistical uncertainty for the failure caused
by external corrosion in gas pipeline
systems, as compared to Table 4.

New system acquires critical data downhole
This new Smart Intervention service
system acquires critical data downhole
and transmits that data to the surface
to provide information on intervention
parameters.
The company says the information
gives well teams a better understanding
of what is happening at the business
end of the intervention bottomhole
assembly. Armed with this knowledge,
well teams can make informed, just-intime decisions that can optimize well
intervention operations and significantly reduce nonproductive time and risk
exposure, the firm notes.
The enabling technology for the
service is the Sentio tool, a downhole
acquisition tool. The tool contains an
array of sensors that measures weight or
pull on tool, torque, rpm, bending stress,
vibration, and pressure simultaneously at
a high data rate. A digital signal processor
analyzes the data stream and provides static
parameters and diagnostics that are trans-

the intervention operator, and based on
the feedback, the team and the operator
determine how to advance the intervention operation. Choices may include
parameter changes in a milling operation, pulling out of hole after confirming successful connection to a fish, or
working the pipe to overcome a weight
transfer problem.
Depending on the type of intervention operation, the engineer may
require different types of downhole
information. For efficiency, customized transmission formats are being
developed. In addition to the up-hole
data transmission, the bottomhole assembly is capable of receiving downlink
signals and provides a link for remote
mitted to a rig-floor monitor and can also control of future intervention tools. A rigbe sent to a remote real-time operating
floor display screen presents the downcenter. Portions of the information can also hole parameters in the clearest and most
be recorded in the on-board memory and meaningful manner and can be linked to a
stored, then retrieved later at the surface
remote real-time operations center.

Energy represents
a belief test for
new party leaders
Political-party leadership choices portend much about energy issues in the 110th
Congress. In turn, energy choices will say
much about what the parties believe.
For Democrats, there’s no mystery. With
Nancy Pelosi of California as speaker of the
House and Harry Reid of Nevada as Senate
majority leader, energy markets will be
under siege.
Liberal Democrats like Pelosi and Reid

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

treat energy as a menu of political choices
and energy problems as evidence of lapsed
political will—rather than the results of past
policy failures that they most often are.
Republicans will be more interesting.
The question is whether they learned from
their electoral drubbing Nov. 7 that they
can’t win elections by acting like Democrats. Energy issues give them a good way
to reassert an ideological difference.
Having lost the initiative on energy issues, Republicans now must defend the nation against the new majority party’s worst
compulsions. But will they?
Leadership choices this week provide
some comfort. The new House minority
leader, John Boehner of Ohio, showed
mettle last April by helping to block a windfall proﬁt tax on oil companies.
The new Senate minority leader, Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky, was a cosponsor
this year of an effort to expand oil and gas
leasing of the Outer Continental Shelf. The
Senate bill was a faint echo of its House
counterpart. But political resistance was
tough in the Senate, and at least McConnell
took part in a righteous effort.
Then there’s Trent Lott, the former majority leader from Mississippi deposed after
making remarks taken to be racially insensitive. Lott said he didn’t intend for the comments to be offensive and apparently has
served his penance; he’s back in Republican
leadership as McConnell’s assistant.
There can be no mistaking the intent
of comments Lott made in October 2005,
when gasoline prices were high following
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and oil company proﬁts were leaping.
Calling for “voluntary or mandatory
proﬁt controls,” Lott issued a manifesto:
“Either the oil companies must take steps
to help America, or America will do it for
them.”
A Democrat couldn’t have said it better.

Crude prices hit new low for the year
The December contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes plunged to $56.26/
bbl, the lowest close for a front-month contract since Nov. 18, 2005, on the New York
Mercantile Exchange after the Energy Information Administration reported the injection of 5 bcf of gas into US underground storage during the week ended Nov. 10.
That injection ﬁgure was at the low end of consensus expectations among Wall
Street analysts. It compared with a withdrawal of 7 bcf the previous week and the
injection of 51 bcf during the same period in 2005. US gas storage was then at 3.45
tcf, up by 176 bcf from year-ago levels and 238 bcf above the 5-year average.
It also was the ﬁrst increase in US winter gas supplies in 3 weeks, ending a
3-week rally on the natural gas futures market that had boosted the December gas
contract to $8.12/MMbtu Nov. 15 on NYMEX. That contract traded at $7.70-8.24/
MMbtu on Nov. 16 before closing at $7.76/MMbtu. “On the natural gas front, prices
have held within a 98¢/Mcfe range during [most of] November (with a high of $8.26/
MMbtu), after months of intense volatility. Frigid weather is the most likely catalyst
needed for oil and gas prices to break out of their respective trading ranges,” said
analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc. earlier that week.
On Nov. 17 Raymond James said, “A spell of forecasts—mild weather, slowing
economy, higher fuel inventories, etc.—prompted a wide sell-off as traders switched
over to the January [crude] contract,” with the December contract to expire at the
end of trading Nov. 17.
The December crude contract had rebounded by 48¢ to $58.76/bbl Nov. 15 after
falling for three consecutive trading sessions on NYMEX. That increase was sparked
by an EIA report that commercial inventories of US crude rose by 1.3 million bbl to
336 million bbl during the week ended Nov. 10. US gasoline stocks, however, fell 3.7
million bbl to 200.3 million bbl during the same period to the lower half of the average range. Distillate fuel inventories dropped 3.6 million bbl to 135 million bbl, with
a slight increase in heating oil buried by a large decline in diesel fuel. The US market
had watched distillate inventories drop during the previous 2 months, Raymond
James reported.
“The administration reported a large decline in total reﬁned product inventories,
driven by strong consumption and reduced supplies. Over the past 4 weeks, total
reﬁned product demand has been, on average, 4.5% above comparable year-ago levels. Total reﬁned product inventories, adjusted for demand, are now only 1% above
the historical 3-year average,” said Jacques Rousseau, senior energy analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group Inc., Arlington, Va., in a Nov. 15 report.
“US inventories have been falling like a stone relative to their normal patterns,”
said Paul Horsnell at Barclays Capital Inc., London. “The latest US data have continued the very strong pattern of previous weeks, producing the fastest rate of decline
relative to normal patterns in any 5-week period that we can ﬁnd,” Horsnell said. “US
oil product inventories, (excluding the ‘other oils’ category, which is estimated rather
than observed), now stand 17.3 million bbl higher than their 5-year average. Five
weeks ago, they stood 56.8 million bbl higher, i.e., they have fallen by 39.5 million
bbl relative to the 5-year average, which is a rate of descent of more than 1.3 million
b/d. In terms of forward cover, product inventories are now lower than their 5-year
average.”
Seasonal effects
Analysts at Enerfax Daily noted that temperatures were above average across
most of the US during the week ended Nov. 10, reducing demand and allowing utilities to add gas to storage that already was at a record high. The Nov. 23 US Thanksgiving holiday was expected to cut demand even further with ofﬁces and businesses
closed.
However, energy prices had climbed Nov. 15 partially in anticipation of Thanksgiving holiday travel. “More people travel over the Thanksgiving holiday than any
other holiday in the US. The American Automobile Association, the nation’s largest
motoring organization, expects 31.7 million travelers to hit the road. That number of
motorists is about 83% of the total number of travelers expected over the Nov. 23-26
period,” said Raymond James analysts.
Meanwhile, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries warned in its latest monthly oil market report that, if it continues producing at current levels, there
would be a bigger than usual build in oil inventories among consumer nations in the
second quarter of 2007.

serves that were beyond reach just a few years ago.”
While the technology challenges for expanding the deepwater and deep-shelf plays are substantial, the biggest concerns
for Gulf of Mexico operators and service/supply operators are
nontechnical in nature: shortages of rigs and personnel, rising
costs, leasing hurdles, and coping with natural disasters.

Rig availability
Drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico could be constrained
by the lack of available rigs worsening from today’s already
tight market.
Despite strong demand, rig supply in the gulf has slumped in
the past 5 years. Almost 150 rigs were available for work in the
gulf in 2001. Today, there are about 90. The upturn in oil prices
in recent years has pulled rigs from the gulf to other areas of
the world, drawn by more lucrative day rates and longer-term
contracts elsewhere.
In the short term (2006-08), says Cahuzac, “activity in
the Gulf of Mexico will be constrained by the number of
rigs available; this is at a time when there is an anomalously
high turnover of leases, prompting a demand with a critical
timing component.”
Bill Coates, president, Schlumberger north America, warns
that “a chronic shortage of jack up rigs is about to develop,
which will further depress shelf production for oil or gas.”

• “Management commitment to accelerated development.
We monitor and reward supervisors and rigs for success
in the program. Also, we continually remind everybody
of the criticality of this function for the future success of
the company.
• “Retention of our existing strong experience base is
achieved through constantly monitoring compensation to
ensure we have a competitive compensation package. In
addition, management maintains visibility on the rigs to facilitate a healthy two-way communication.
• “Morale-building tools are utilized such as a well-understood career development process.”
Dealing with personnel concerns also is related to a key
issue facing the industry, says Lew Mologne, president of oil
and gas treating services company ProSep Technologies Inc.,
Houston—“that being the need to use much better partnering-based relationships to streamline projects and reduce time
and costs.”

Regulatory issues
Access remains a key concern even in this busiest of offshore
provinces—considering that almost a third of the gulf, the eastern portion, remains off-limits to leasing.

semisubmersibles.
• Conducting site-speciﬁc assessments for each location
during storm season to assess the potential consequences
of mooring failure.
• Continually updating and modifying tropical storm evacuation plans to minimize risk to people on both dynamically
positioned and moored units.

Disaster planning
Gulf of Mexico players learned some grim lessons about disaster planning in the wake of 2005’s devastating Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which destroyed more than 100 gulf platforms,
set 19 MODUs adrift, and shut in 92% of the gulf’s oil production and 83% of its gas output.
Gulf operators and service/supply companies have formed
a joint industry project on mooring systems to advise the industry on risk-mitigating factors and provide input for impending
new regulations.
Mullen cites the following steps Transocean has taken in its
disaster-planning iniative:
• Improving stationkeeping capacity of moored deepwater

Importing technology is one approach Petrobras, with its extensive deepwater experience off Brazil, is taking, says Bertani:
“We are bringing the expertise that we developed offshore
Brazil, particularly with the utilization of FPSOs [ﬂoating production, storage, and ofﬂoading units], customized to the Gulf of
Mexico conditions.
“We are planning to deploy an FPSO with a disconnectable turret in our operated developments of Cascade and
Chinook [ultradeepwater ﬁelds]. This will allow quick disconnection in case of imminent hurricanes so that the vessel
can move away from the storm and reconnect once the sea
conditions allow.” ]

Technology challenges daunting for
deepwater GOM bonanza

O

vercoming technology challenges in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico is critical to future US
energy supply.
The deepwater (especially the ultradeepwater)
areas of the Gulf of Mexico offer the greatest near-term potential for signiﬁcantly adding to US oil and natural gas reserves and production.
The US Minerals Management Service estimates the deep
waters of the gulf contain resources totaling about 45 billion
bbl of oil and 232 tcf of gas. And the individual prospects are
more proliﬁc: According to MMS, in the past 10 years, the
average deepwater ﬁeld added over 67 MMboe of reserves

vs. about 5 MMboe for shallow-water ﬁelds. The successes
are even more substantial as the play has expanded into everdeeper waters in recent years. Since early 2000, new deepwater drilling added more than 6.2 billion boe of reserves, up
50% from the total deepwater reserves discovered during
1974-99.
That trend is further borne out by the recent extended
well test of the Jack discovery by Chevron Corp. with partners Devon Energy Corp. and Statoil ASA, according to Chris
Oynes, regional director, Gulf of Mexico region, US Minerals
Management Service.
The successful ﬂow test “increased conﬁdence in discovering and producing oil and gas from

according to MMS. After 12 discoveries, industry estimates
put the trend’s potential recoverable resources at 9-15 billion
boe. The discoveries, all in more than 5,000 ft of water and
with some wells approaching or exceeding 30,000 ft total
depth, demonstrate how the deepwater Gulf of Mexico is a
technology-driven play.
“To date, 99% of the oil and gas produced from the gulf
has come from relatively young rock, down in geologic age
to the Miocene,” notes Steven Hadden, senior vice-president,
exploration and production, Devon. “Until a few years ago,
the industry did not have the technology in place to ﬁnd or develop resources found in deeper formations in the ultradeep
waters of the gulf.”

says. “Wide-azimuth towed streamer data show good promise in this area.”
Rick Fowler, vice-predident and general manager, Gulf of
Mexico operations, Dominion Exploration & Production, a unit
of Dominion Resources Inc., Richmond, VA. elaborated on the
seismic challenges in the deepwater gulf: “Most of the highquality opportunities available are in subsalt horizons, where
applying seismic methods can be challenging,” he says. “We
can use seismic to identify structures below the salt; however,
our seismic images are not yet accurate enough to adequately
predict continuity within these structures.”
Fowler notes that once a subsalt discovery is made, it is
extremely difﬁcult to adequately appraise the reservoirs, thus
requiring many wells to ascertain
their size. Not only is such appraisal drilling costly, it delays a

“Alloys for ﬂowlines and risers subjected to the same
elevated pressures, corrosive environment, and differential temperatures will need to be developed as well,”
he adds.
Oynes also points to the production technology challenges
involved in subsea pumping and processing.
“Both of these issues would increase ultimate recovery
of producing properties,” he says. “Multiphase metering on
a platform and subsea is also a challenge that has not been
completely conquered.” ]

Deep shelf gas:
big potential but high risks

T

he deep geologic horizons of the shallow-water
Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf offer the
best near-term opportunity for increasing US
natural gas production.
While the shallow-water gulf OCS has been heavily
explored, sediments at depths of greater than 15,000
ft in water depths less than 200 m are relatively unexplored. Only about 5% of all wells drilled on the OCS
have penetrated below 15,000 ft subsea.
To be economic, deep gas ﬁnds on the shelf require
larger structures and high ﬂow rates.

Technology challenges

In tackling the deep shelf gas opportunity, industry must
overcome the major technology challenges associated
with drilling wells encountering high temperatures, high
pressures, and corrosive environments.
In deep shelf areas with salt intrusion, there are concerns with lost circulation of drilling mud systems when
drilling through salt.
Bill Coates, president, Schlumberger North America,
contends that, in many ways, drilling for deep shelf
gas is more difﬁcult than drilling in the deepwater Gulf
of Mexico.
Accordingly, operators must

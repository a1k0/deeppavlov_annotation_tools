EPA publishes regs on oil-spill rule amendments
The US Environmental Protection Agency published a final
regulation on Nov. 10 that amends certain requirements for facilities subject to its Oil Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) rule.
EPA said the amendments clarify regulatory requirements, tailor requirements to particular industry sectors, and streamline
certain requirements for a facility owner or operator subject to the
rule. The action completes the SPCC action, which was proposed
on Oct. 15, 2007; finalized on Dec. 5, 2008; and for which the
agency received public comments on Feb. 3, 2009.
The amendments do not remove any regulatory requirement
for owners and operators of facilities in operation before Aug.
16, 2002, to develop, implement, and maintain an SPCC plan in
accordance with regulations which were in effect at that time,
EPA said. Such facilities continue to be required to maintain their
plans during the interim until the applicable date for revising and
implementing their plans under the new amendments.
More information about the SPCC rule is available online at
www.epa.gov/emergencies/content/spcc/index.htm.

Tight market alters European utilities’ spending
The economic crisis is forcing European utilities to defer or
cancel investments in facilities, renewables, and energy efficiency
and to divest assets, according to Cap Gemini SA, Paris, in its annual European Energy Markets Observatory (EEMO).
Lower prices and drops of 5% in electric power consumption
and 8% in natural gas consumption in this year’s first half have
depleted utilities’ ‘war chests,’ said Colette Lewiner, in charge of
the EEMO report.
Germany’s E.On AG reduced its 2009-11 investment to €30 billion from €36 billion. Italy’s Enel SPA intends to reduce its 2009-13
investment to €32 billion from €44 billion. Investments by Spain’s
Iberdrola SA are down to €4.5 billion from an initial €13 billion,
while the newly merged Gas Natural and Union Fenosa will cut
investments to €11-13 billion from €31 billion.
This is a marked change from 2008 when aggregate utilities

investments reached a record €120 billion. But debt also increased:
the combined debt of the 10 largest European companies rose by
11.3% between 2006 and 2008 to €213 billion.

CSB to investigate Puerto Rico tank farm fire
The US Chemical Safety Board will fully investigate an Oct. 23
tank explosion and fire at Caribbean Petroleum Refining in Puerto
Rico that damaged homes and businesses more than a mile away,
the board said Nov. 17.
It said that at 12:23 a.m. on Oct. 23, a large vapor cloud ignited
at the facility near San Juan that includes a refinery that was shut
down in 2000 and a tank farm that is still in operation. CSB sent
investigators to the site that day who have conducted interviews,
requested hundreds of pages of documents, and catalogued key
pieces of evidence, it said.
A tank was being filled with gasoline from a ship docked in
San Juan’s harbor when the accident occurred, according to CSB. It
said that investigators have determined that a likely cause was the
tank’s being accidentally overfilled. Gasoline then leaked undetected and spread across the facility, creating a vapor cloud 2,000
ft in diameter until it reached an ignition source in the facility’s
northwest section, it said.
It said that its investigators found that the tank’s liquid level
could not be determined on the evening of the incident because
the facility’s computerized level monitoring system was not fully
operational and operators used a mechanical gauge on the tank’s
exterior wall instead. “Therefore, as the gasoline level in the tank
rose and eventually overflowed, employees located in the facility’s
control room were unaware of the emergency,” CSB said.
“The filling of a tank without a functioning monitoring system
is the type of activity the CSB will be examining very closely,” said
Jeffrey Wanko, the investigator-in-charge. “The CSB’s investigation will examine operations particular to Caribbean Petroleum,
but will also look at the regulations and best practices surrounding
the industry as a whole in an effort to improve safety practices at
similar facilities.” ✦

Development

Ivanhoe to acquire stake in PSA in Mongolia
Ivanhoe Energy Inc. said its Asian subsidiary plans to acquire
interest in a production-sharing agreement (PSA) held by PanAsian
Petroleum Inc., which holds exploration and production rights to
a large block in central Mongolia.
Ivanhoe’s Sunwing Energy Ltd. plans to acquire interest in PanAsian’s Mongolian interests for up to 3 million shares of Ivanhoe
common stock. Transaction terms do not involve any cash pay-

ment to PanAsian.
A private company based in Alberta, PanAsian has a PSA with
the Petroleum Authority of Mongolia. The contract provides PanAsian with the exclusive right to explore, develop, and produce oil
or gas within Block XVI in Mongolia’s Nyalga basin.
The structure of the merger is such that the holder of the PSA,
PanAsian Energy, and its wholly owned Mongolian subsidiary,
Shaman LLC, remain unaltered.

PanAsian has invested $4 million in the acquisition and development of Block XVI, which covers 16,839 sq km and contains
four subbasins. The target is light oil, Ivanhoe said.
A Russian driller initially explored part of the block in the
1950s, and the area was included in a regional appraisal conducted
by BP International for the Mongolian government in 1990.

Devon to accelerate Haynesville shale drilling
Devon Energy Corp. plans to accelerate drilling in its southern
Haynesville shale play based upon results from a well in San Augustine County, Tex.
Kardell 1H achieved an average continuous 24-hr flow rate of
30.7 MMcfd of gas equivalent through a 37/64-in. choke. Flowing
pressure was 6,824 psi.
The well was drilled to 18,350 ft TMD, including a horizontal lateral section of 4,500 ft. Devon operates the well with 48%
working interest. Crimson Exploration Inc. owns the rest.
David A. Hager, Devon executive vice-president, exploration
and production, said the company plans a five-rig program in
2010 in this southern play area.
Devon holds 570,000 net acres in the greater Haynesville trend
of east Texas and north Louisiana. Previously, Devon drilled eight
horizontal Haynesville wells around Carthage, Tex.

field commercial. Pan Orient serves as project operator.
The well is the first horizontal appraisal in the field and flowed
at 700 b/d of oil from a fractured volcanic reservoir target at a
depth of 446 m.
Carnarvon said this is a significant increase in the flow rate
from the nearby BR-2ST1 sidetrack Bo Rang B discovery well,
which had a cased-hole completion and flowed at only 35 b/d.
The JV points to the success of horizontal drilling and highlights the shallow zone potential within the Bo Rang and nearby
L44-W sectors of the L44 permit.
The JV is now planning to drill three more horizontal appraisals targeting the Bo Rang B field before yearend.
Nine multiwell drill pad locations are under environmental review by the Thai authorities. Approval is anticipated in January.

Petrobras extends Marimba to the north

Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) says it has extended Marimba
oil field to the north in the Campos basin off Brazil.
The 3-MA-32A exploratory well detected presence of 29° gravity oil in a 30 m of pay with good porosity and permeability.
Water depth is 400 m.
Petrobras estimates recoverable oil in the extension at 25 million bbl, which would increase Marimba’s recoverable volume by
27%.
Appraisal well completed in Bo Rang B field
It said the discovery resulted from revision of the area’s geoCarnarvon Petroleum Ltd., Perth, and its joint venture partner logical model and use of new seismic interpretation methods.
Pan Orient Energy Corp., Calgary, completed testing the BR-3D1
The state-owned company said it will place the well on proappraisal well in Bo Rang B oil field in Thailand and declared the duction through the nearby P-8 platform by next August. ✦

&

Production

Haynesville buried-array seismic work set
El Paso Corp. let contract to MicroSeismic Inc. for a buriedarray seismic monitoring program in its Haynesville shale development program south of Shreveport, La.
The buried array, to be installed before yearend, will provide
microseismic monitoring, mapping, and analysis for hydraulic
fracturing of El Paso wells. It will be the sixth such system the
contractor has installed in the Haynesville shale play.
El Paso has five rigs drilling in the Haynesville play and expects
to be producing more than 125 MMcfd of gas equivalent from the
shale by December.
In October it said it had 250-300 Haynesville locations on
40,000 net acres, 30,000 in Louisiana. At the time it had 13
Haynesville wells on production with two being completed.

Partners report high Bakken shale test rates
Brigham Exploration Co., Austin, and US Energy Corp., Riverton, Wyo., reported high initial production rates from their first
three completions in a six-well program in the Williston basin’s
Bakken shale oil play.
The latest completion, Brigham Lee 16-21 No. 1H Bakken,
flowed on a 24-hr test at 1,341 b/d of oil and 1.22 Mcfd of natural
gas after a 28-stage frac job. US Energy said oil sales would begin
immediately, with gas sales starting in 90-120 days following connection to a gathering system.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Wells in the program, all operated by Brigham, are drilled
about 10,000 ft vertically and 10,000 ft horizontally, targeting
middle Bakken strata.
The Lee well is in the Rough Rider area of Williams County,
ND, 5 miles south of BCD Farms 16-21 No. 1H and 8 miles northwest of the Brad Olson 9-16 No. 1H, both earlier completions in
the Brigham-US Energy program.
The BCD Farms well, also stimulated with a 28-stage frac job,
produced 1,553 b/d of oil and 1.34 MMcfd of gas during an early
24-hr flowback period, Brigham said.
The Brad Olson well, 13 miles southeast of the Farms location,
tested 2,112 boe/d of oil and gas.
US Energy said Brigham had finished drilling a fourth well,
Strand 16-9 No. 1H, and run a sleeve with 26 swell packers into
the hole and was preparing for completion. The other two wells,
Williston 25-36 No. 1H and State 36-1 No. 1H, are still being
drilled.
The companies’ interests in the wells vary. Brigham’s interests
increase after payout.
Bud Brigham, chairman, president, and chief executive officer,
said early results confirm his company’s interpretation of a continuous Bakken reservoir across the core Rough Rider area. The
company holds 100,000 acres in the area and sees potential for
three Bakken wells for each 1,280-acre spacing unit.

Suncor revives Firebag oil sands expansion
Suncor Energy Inc. will resume investment in the 50%-complete third stage of its Firebag in situ development in the oil sands
of Alberta.
The company has approved capital spending of $5.5 billion
(Can.) in 2010, including $900 million for the next step in Firebag
expansion and $50 million for the fourth stage. With other projects, the “growth capital” part of Suncor’s investment plans for
next year totals $1.5 billion.
The company suspended work on the Firebag third stage early
this year, along with plans for expanded upgrading capacity for
its mining operations. Resumption of the upgrading investment is
not part of the 2010 capital budget.
Noting “some improvement” in crude prices and the overall
economy, Suncor Pres. and Chief Executive Officer Rick George

Processing
ConocoPhillips delays refinery upgrade
ConocoPhillips has confirmed plans to delay the upgrade of its
260,000-b/d Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany.
“This is the right project for Wilhelmshaven—but not now,”
said Willie Chiang, senior vice-president, refining, marketing,
and transportation. “We will reevaluate this investment opportunity as market conditions warrant.”
ConocoPhillips had planned to add a coker, hydrocracker, and
hydrogen units to the refinery, which it acquired in 2006 from
Louis Dreyfus Refining & Marketing Ltd.
ConocoPhillips Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jim
Mulva last month said delay of the project was possible (OGJ, Nov.
16, 2009, p. 68).

Valero to shut Paulsboro FCCU until early 2010
Unscheduled maintenance on the scrubber at the Valero Energy Corp.’s Paulsboro, NJ, refinery’s 55,000-b/d fluid catalytic
cracking unit will force its shut down later this month, according
to a company news release. The unit will remain down until the
maintenance is completed, estimated at mid-January.
During the FCCU shutdown, Valero will also bring down the
remainder of the refinery for maintenance, it said. The entire
plant will be shut down for about 3 weeks during the longer FCC
outage.
Valero said staffing at the plant will not be affected, and production units will be restored to service once the maintenance is
complete. Nor will the outage affect a previously scheduled turnaround at the company’s Delaware City refinery.

Vietnam’s Dung Quat refinery to shut for repairs
Petrovietnam, apparently at the urging of state officials, reported it will shut down the 148,000 b/d Dung Quat refinery for
10-14 days for maintenance in December.
The facility, which began operating in February, has experienced several stoppages in the past year due to technical problems.
In mid-August, it was shut down for 6 weeks due to a technical
fault in a cracking unit.
“There was a problem at the RFCC unit and repairs should take

called the budget “a conservative capital strategy” that Suncor can
support from free cash flow at “midcycle” crude prices.
The third and fourth Firebag stages are to have production capacities of 68,000 b/d each from steam-assisted gravity drainage.
Production from the third stage is to start in the second quarter of
2011 and from the fourth stage in the fourth quarter of 2012.
Total production from the first two stages, which started up in
2004 and 2006, averaged 54.3 million b/d in July-September.
Production from those stages is recoverying from cap of 42,000
b/d imposed in 2007 by Alberta regulators in response to excessive sulfur emissions from the Firebag operation. The cap was
lifted in the third quarter of 2008.
Suncor is completing a sulfur plant, expected to cost $400
million, able to handle emissions from all six planned Firebag
stages. ✦

about 20 days, which means the plant will resume operation by
Sept. 9 or 10,” said a Petrovietnam official, who declined to be
identified (OGJ Online, Sept. 4, 2009).
At the time, officials said the plant would go back online at
the end of September, and would begin running at full capacity
by Oct. 20.
On Oct. 30, reports said the refinery had operated at full capacity in the first full week after the shutdown, and that Vietnam’s
crude exports were expected to fall after the unit’s successful restart.
However, reports in local media now say the unit’s crude oil
floating storage and offloading vessel has broken down.
As a result, the Phap luat Thanh pho Ho Chi Minh newspaper
Nov. 13 said the state appraisal council, which reported the breakdown to Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung, asked Petrovietnam to
take “drastic measures” to deal with the issue.
The council’s request came just days after Vietnam’s Minister of
Industry and Trade Vu Huy Hoang said general contractor Technip
would hand the Dung Quat facility over to Petrovietnam in January at the latest.
The refinery was due to become fully operational by yearend,
or 2 months behind schedule, Hoang said on Nov. 10.
On Nov. 7, Petrovietnam’s subsidiary Binh Son Petrochemical
& Refinery Co. signed a $4.8 million, 1-year contract with the
Marine Oil & Gas Maintenance Co., Oil & Gas Technology Co.,
and Malaysia’s OSS for maintenance of the refinery’s single-point
mooring structure.
Since starting up in February, the Dung Quat refinery has
bought 1.2 million tons of oil pumped from the the Bach Ho
(White Tiger) oil field, which lies off the southern coastal province of Ba Ria-Vung Tau. During that time, the $3.054 billion facility has produced 800,000 tons of products.
The Vietnamese government, aiming to reduce the country’s
trade deficit, has been hoping that production at Dung Quat would
help to reduce, or even halt the import of petroleum products during the remainder of 2009. The country’s trade deficit is forecast to
run at $11.5-12.5 billion this year, compared with $17.516 billion
in 2008. ✦

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Final leg of Rockies Express line enters service

Qatargas signed a memorandum of understanding with
CNOOC for long-term supplies of LNG to China in addition to
amounts already agreed by the two sides.
Under terms of the MOU, Qatargas intends to supply a further
3 million tonnes/year of LNG to CNOOC commencing in 2013. In
addition to the base volume, Qatargas and CNOOC said they will
“contemplate the sale and purchase of an additional 2 million tpy
of LNG.”
These volumes combined with an existing long-term supply
commitment of 2 million tpy of LNG agreed under a 2008 sales
agreement will potentially take the total volume of the Qatari LNG
to be supplied to CNOOC to 7 million tpy.
According to analyst IHS Global Insight, “CNOOC, the largest
offshore oil and gas developer of China’s [NOCs], is planning a
significant expansion of LNG import and storage capacity, which
Qatar with its huge liquefaction projects can help to fill.”
In addition to the CNOOC agreement, Qatargas also signed an
MOU with PetroChina for 2 million tpy of LNG to China.
Besides the 3 million tpy already to be supplied from Qatargas
to PetroChina, the new MOU will increase the total amount of
LNG deliveries to 5 million tpy.
Qatargas said the initial supply of 3 million tonnes of LNG is
expected to commence with the start-up of Qatargas 4’s Train 7,
while the additional 2 million tonnes of LNG under the new MOU
is expected to start in “the first half of the next decade.”
Russians close to approval of ESPO oil line tariff
In October, CNOOC received its first cargo of LNG from Qatar,
Russia’s Federal Tariff Service said it expects to approve the tar- 216,000 cu m of gas at the Dapeng LNG terminal in Shenzhen uniff for oil transportation through the East Siberia–Pacific Ocean der the long-term supply agreement signed between CNOOC and
(ESPO) pipeline in late November or early December.
Qatargas last June (OGJ Online, Oct. 20, 2009).
FTS head Sergei Novikov said the tariff should be introduced
from Jan. 1, and would be a through rate for eastbound oil ex- PEP lets contract for Veracruz pipeline project
Petroleos Mexicanos subsidiary Pemex Exploration & Producports, with two or three zones for oil exports.
Novikov’s remarks concerning three zones as well as their price tion (PEP) has awarded Copavisa the tender for construction of
structures largely reiterate a proposal made earlier this month by various pipelines in its Veracruz project. Copavisa presented a
winning bid of $8.77 million for the project, which will last for
Russia’s state-owned OAO Transneft.
Last week a Transneft spokesman said the firm wants the ESPO 2 years.
Pemex’s Veracruz project, the second-largest producer of nonline to be divided into the eastern, western, and central export
tariff zones, with $34/tonne charged for oil transported via the associated gas in Mexico after the Burgos project, also produces
eastern zone, $48/tonne via the western zone, and $42/tonne via some oil and associated gas.
News of the award follows a recent announcement by Pemex
the central zone (OGJ Online, Nov. 9, 2009).
Meanwhile, Russian authorities last week announced that all of that at least 90 of its oil and gas wells in Veracruz and Tabasco
the onshore and offshore facilities for oil exports have been fin- states were shut down due to flooding. Production dropped by
ished at the Port of Kozmino—the planned terminus of the ESPO more than 56%, falling to 26,280 b/d from 60,000 b/d, according
to Pemex executive Fernando Flores Rivera, whose office controls
pipeline, now under construction (OGJ Online, Nov. 12, 2009).
241 wells in the area. ✦
The final 195 miles of the Rockies Express-East pipeline was
completed Nov. 12, entering service between the Lebanon Hub in
Warren County, Ohio, and Clarington in Monroe County, Ohio.
The entire 1,679-mile Rockies Express Pipeline, extending
from northwestern Colorado to eastern Ohio, is now operational
and available for full firm shipper nominations, Kinder Morgan
Energy Partners LP said.
Long-term, binding firm commitments have been secured for
virtually all of the pipeline’s 1.8 bcfd capacity.
The Rockies Express line began service into Lebanon on June
28, opening the first direct route between the Rockies producing
region and historically higher priced natural gas markets in Ohio
and the US Northeast.
Shippers on the line took advantage of the new capacity almost
immediately, moving gas away from the markets they had been
serving in the Midwest to higher-priced markets. Regional price
differentials shifted in response to the changes in gas flows.
Bentek Energy says completion of the final leg of line to Clarington and additional interconnections with the Northeast market
will likely have similar effects (OGJ, Sept 7, 2009, p. 50).
Kinder Morgan owns 50% of the line, which it constructed
and operates. Sempra Pipelines & Storage, a unit of Sempra, and
ConocoPhillips each own a 25% stake.

CNOOC, PetroChina to buy more LNG from Qatar
Qatar’s state-owned Qatargas Operating Co. Ltd. boosted its exports of LNG to China by signing supply agreements with China
National Offshore Oil Co. (CNOOC) and PetroChina International
Co. Ltd. The agreements were announced at the official opening
of Qatargas’ representative office in Beijing, which was attended
by Abdullah Al-Attiyah, Qatar’s deputy prime minister as well as
minister of energy and industry, and Qatargas Chief Executive Officer Faisal M. Al Suwaidi.

Correction
In the story, “EOG sees reserve hike in Barnett
Combo play,” initial production was incorrectly stated as
6,000 b/d. Production should be 600 b/d (OGJ Online,
Nov. 6, 2009).

Gas-lift valve testing
This letter refers to an article by Zotan
Turzo and Gabor Takacs entitled “CFD
techniques determine gas-lift valve behavior” (OGJ, June 8, 2009, p. 46).
The article stated: “Mainly based
on the systematic work performed at
TUALP [Tulsa University artificial lift
projects], API published the first edition
of Gas Lift Valve Performance Testing
(API RP11V2) in 1995.”
The statement is not entirely correct. The testing techniques adopted
by American Petroleum Institute for
the Recommended Practice (RP) 11V2
had been performed for many years
prior to TUALP by Teledyne Merla. I am
the chairman of RP 11V2 and former
employee of Teledyne Merla. I am quite
familiar with the time line and development of the testing techniques adopted
by API.
While TUALP did practice one of the
testing methods prior to the publication
of the API document, the test method
they practiced was not developed by
them. In addition, the API document included two additional test requirements
that, to my knowledge, were never practiced at TUALP; namely, the Loadrate
test and the Flow Coefficient test. Both
of these additional tests are critical to
the proper testing of a gas-lift valve.
I would like to ensure proper credit
is given not only to Teledyne Merla but
also to the members of the API committee who worked very hard and for a
great deal of time to write this document.

remains practically frozen. After all, if
banks are still uncertain about lending to, say, solar farms, how likely are
they to finance new ethanol plants?”
analysts said.

Interior’s damaging overhaul
US Interior Sec. Ken Salazar often portrays
his approach to oil and gas leasing as repair of
damage inflicted by the administration of George
W. Bush. He thus adopts his own administration’s tiresome penchant for blame-shifting. More
important than that, however, is the damage he
is inflicting, with a growing record of resistance
to the development of oil and gas resources, on
national energy interests.
Since confirmation of his nomination last Jan.
20, Salazar has fallen into a pattern: He identifies an issue, blames the Bush administration for
mishandling it, then implements change, often
sweeping, that discourages oil and gas work.

26 million acres to a new, thick layer of activityrepellant bureaucracy. More recently, he ended the
royalty-in-kind program, a move that will revive
disputes between leaseholders and the federal
government over valuation of produced oil and
gas. An inspector general’s report found problems with the department’s administration of the
program, so the secretary—ever ready to swing
the saber—killed it. And the burden on producers
grows.
The latest setback to oil and gas activity on
federal acreage came hidden in, of all things, the
announcement of a federal offshore lease sale.

Economic consequences to the US
refining industry of the American
Clean Energy and Security Act (ACES),
H.R. 2454, also known as the WaxmanMarkey (W-M) energy and climate bill,
are profound, according to an evaluation by Energy Policy Research Foundation Inc. The legislation calls for controlling emissions of greenhouse gasses
(GHGs) by placing a price on them. The
bill passed the House
of Representatives on
June 26, 2009, and
companion legislation
is under discussion in
the US Senate.
Under the W-M bill,
manufacturers (refiners) and importers of transportation
and other fuels derived from crude oil
would be required to purchase allowances to account for the carbon dioxide
emitted into the atmosphere as a result
of combustion of these fuels beginning
in 2012, 2 years before any free allowances are distributed. Allowances could
be bought and sold under the legislation’s cap-and-trade program.
US refiners would responsible for
approximately 45% of all emissions
covered by the W-M bill, which would

bill costly to US refiners

regulate 86% of all US emissions by
2016. US refiners, but not importers,
would have to purchase allowances for
stationary source emissions (emissions
released at the refinery). US refiners
would receive some free allowances
beginning in 2014 and ending in 2026
to assist in transitioning to a higher
cost operating environment, but these
allowances are small compared to the
total obligations under the program
(Table 1).

Fig. 3 have remained relatively steady
in recent years, within their historical
range of $6-8/bbl, and are consistent
with EPRINC’s estimates in Fig. 2.
Net margins were strong during the
refining “golden era” from 2004 to
2007, but more recent data, shown in
Fig. 4, suggest net margins have likely
returned to their historical level around
$2/bbl.
Fig. 4 below shows gross margins
for refined products accounting for
85% of the barrel. Gross margins have
returned to their historical levels near
$10/bbl after several years at or over
$15/bbl beginning in 2004. Composite
margins shown in Fig. 4 do not include
bottom-of-the-barrel products, which
generally sell below crude cost.

Regulatory cost
The industry is likely to face a range
22

of cost pressures in the coming years
from both existing regulatory programs and new legislation. EPRINC
has estimated the cost of the following
regulatory and legislative initiatives
and divided the cost outcomes into two
categories: 1. costs faced by US refiners
but not by many foreign suppliers, and
2. costs faced by both US and foreign
suppliers.
With regard to cost of operations
borne by US refiners alone, the cost
of acquiring allowances for stationary emissions of GHGs at the refinery
site, and adjustments in tax rates (such
as removal of Section 199 in the US
tax code) are the most prominent.
Although refined products entering
the US from some foreign sources may
have a cost penalty from CO2 control
costs from stationary emissions, a large

volume of processing capacity now in
place abroad as well as new capacity
scheduled to come on line will be free
of a higher cost structure from carbon
controls of stationary source emissions and will also not be subject to the
higher proposed cost tax structure faced
by US refiners.
In some cases, national governments
may decide to participate in an international agreement to reduce GHGs but
may select control strategies that do
not raise the cost of industrial operations and instead focus on strategies to
promote efficiency and reduce consumption by end-users, as the European Union is attempting. The potential
for widely differing cost structures
for refining in international markets
is especially important in the near to
medium term.
EPRINC has identified substantial
foreign refining capacity with open access to the US market that faces neither
stationary emission costs for controlling
GHGs nor corporate tax levels which
would raise their cost structure to levels
comparable to the cost structure of US
refiners. Fig. 5 shows IEA’s forecast for
worldwide refining capacity additions
expected to come online between
2009 and 2014. The IEA forecast does
not include three 400,000 b/d projects
in Saudi Arabia which now appear to
be moving forward and are all scheduled to start up by 2014, although the
completion of any one refinery cannot
be guaranteed. China is set to be the
largest source of new capacity.
Depending upon the cost of allowances and whether Section 199 provisions are repealed, the incremental
cost of operating the US refining fleet
will rise by $1-2/bbl in 2015 as a result
of Section 199’s repeal and stationary
emission costs.
The cost imposed on refiners for
their stationary emissions is 75¢/bbl,
based on the typical amount of refinery emissions per barrel of throughput
(0.05 tons/bbl) and the average price
of CO2 allowances in the Environmental Protection Agency’s core scenario
for 2015 ($15/ton of CO2 equivalent)

frameworks such as those required to
meet the National Ambient Air Quality
Standards, per-ton fees for permits, and
state PSD program approvals, he said.
“Therefore, altogether, the proposal highlights the perils of forcing
[GHG] regulations into the [CAA]. You
shouldn’t try to fit a square peg in a
round hole,” he maintained.
The proposal also is not a relief rule,
Friedman indicated. With 300-400 PSD
applications annually already under
the CAA, the proposed tailoring rule’s
overall effect would be to increase PSD
enforcement nearly 40-fold to more
than 13,000 facilities without a proper
assessment of costs and benefits of such
a regulatory expansion, he said.
He cited EPA estimates that it costs
$125,000 and takes 866 hr for a plant’s
owner or operator to complete a PSD
permit application. “That means the
cost to industry for the more than
13,000 facilities to file PSD permits will
be more than $1.6 billion,” Friedman
said.

‘Kicking the can’
“In addition, it is not as if smaller
GHG sources will be exempted from

these significant filing cost increases,”
he continued. “EPA makes clear in the
proposed rulemaking that it intends to
eventually phase smaller sources into
the permitting process. Huge costs will
reach smaller facilities, just a few years
after our facilities pay these costs.”
The proposed program does not save
$54 billion, as its cost/benefit analysis
calculates, but merely delays the $54
billion which the US economy would
have to pay to comply with a PSD program, Friedman said. “We are simply
kicking the can down the road and paying later,” he observed.
The proposed tailoring rule also
would create regulatory uncertainty
since several states’ GHG permitting thresholds are less than the EPA
proposal’s 250,000 tons/year, he said.
Its preamble discussion also does not
answer how EPA could achieve a transition for states with fully approved PSD
and Title V permit programs, he added.
“The adjustments for the new applicability thresholds under the tailoring
rule could be delayed as the states have
to go through the notice and comment
rulemaking in order to incorporate new
federal requirements and policies into

state programs and raise their permitting thresholds to match the federal
program,” Friedman said. “Instead of
streamlining the permitting program,
these factors will mean that the tailoring rule will provide only an additional
level of uncertainty for facilities operating throughout the nation.”
Timing also is an issue, he pointed
out. The proposal, along with the
tailpipe rule, the endangerment rule,
and the GHG reporting rule, are among
the most important and far-reach rules
which EPA has addressed in the past
few years, he said, adding that they also
are complex and interrelated.
“Industry’s efforts to extend comment periods on these rules have been
uniformly rejected,” Friedman said.
“We strongly believe that it is more
important that these rules be done right
and not that they fit into an artificial
deadline. These rules are too important to be rushed only to find flaws
and unintended consequences. We
are only seeking these short comment
extensions in order to produce a useful and meaningful end product that
benefits both industry and society as a
whole.” ✦

Shorter lease terms proposed for central gulf sale
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The US Minerals Management
Service’s next Central Gulf of Mexico
lease sale on Mar. 17, 2010, will include
a shorter initial lease term for blocks in
400-1,600 m of water, US Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said on Nov. 13.
Tracts lying in 400-800 m of water
will change from an 8-year term to a
5-year initial term, which would extend
to 8 years once drilling of an exploratory well begins, Salazar said. Blocks
in 800-1,600 m of water will change
from a 10-year to a 7-year initial lease
term, which would extend to 10 years
once an exploratory well is drilled, he
continued.
“This new approach to lease terms

will better ensure that taxpayer
resources are being developed in a
timely manner,” Salazar said. Several
Democrats in Congress have pushed
for diligent development requirements
in federal oil and gas leases, commonly
called “use-it-or-lose-it” provisions.
American Petroleum Institute Pres.
Jack N. Gerard immediately criticized
the move, calling it “one more impediment to the development of the oil and
natural gas industry necessary for the
American economy to prosper.”
Gerard said API wrote to Salazar on
Nov. 10 to remind him that the administration of President Barack Obama
has set up a series of roadblocks to
discourage the investment necessary
to increase domestic energy supplies,
create well-paying US jobs, and pro-

renewable energy production; and
enforce rules, make decisions based on
sound science and the public interest, and follow the law and high ethics
standards.
“The rest, though, is up to you and
vide additional government revenues
at a time when they are desperately
needed.
“The shortening of lease terms does
nothing to guarantee more discoveries
but rather takes away from companies
the flexibility necessary to operate in
an extremely challenging and risky
environment,” Gerard said.
Salazar said the lease sale would offer nearly 36 million acres that potentially could produce up to 1.3 billion bbl
of crude oil and 5.4 tcf of gas off Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. The
acreage is in water 3-230 miles offshore
in 10-11,200 ft of water. It includes acreage in the 181 South area, he added.
Terms and conditions for the lease
sale are contained in the proposed
notice of sale information at the MMS’s
web site at www.gomr.mms.gov/

Cantwell’s
basic question

US

Sen. Maria E. Cantwell (DWash.) probably recognized
that the bill she introduced on Nov.
10 with Ronald L. Wyden (D-Ore.)
and Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.) has little
chance of being considered. Congress
appears unlikely to let state regulators and attorneys general consider
regulating over-the-counter financial derivatives trading as a form of
gambling.
Cantwell wanted to make a point.
“The derivatives market has done so
much damage to our economy and is
nothing more than a very high-stakes
casino—except that casinos have to
abide by regulations,” she said.
“Even in Las Vegas at the blackjack tables, both the house and the
player have to have capital behind
their bets,” she said, adding, “But we
allow Wall Street to continue to operate in the dark and without capital
to back up bets on derivatives. We
remain at risk of further harm until
we have the tools to stop abusive
speculative practices.”
Congress exempted derivatives
traders from state gambling regulations when it passed the Commodity
Futures Modernization Act in 2000.
Cantwell’s proposal would reveal this
provision.

Much bigger now
The derivatives market has grown
from $80 trillion, when CFMA went
into effect, to more than $600 trillion now, Cantwell said. The lack of
any regulations at the federal level
meant that the 2000 law made it
open season for rampant derivatives
speculation that culminated in the
economic collapse of 2008, she said.
Cantwell noted that Senate Bank30

ing Committee Chairman Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) mentioned
OTC derivatives when he unveiled
his sweeping federal financial regulatory reform proposal the same day.
“Our ultimate goal is a strong,
uniform set of federal regulations,”
she said, adding, “Congress must take
a strong stand to prevent the kinds of
abuses that have cost American workers and taxpayers so much.”

Basic question
Cantwell’s demand for tighter derivative regulations has grown more
urgent as Congress considers instituting a carbon cap-and-trade program
as part of global climate-change
legislation. “The fact that the derivative market still has loopholes means
we shouldn’t start a carbon market
too quickly,” she said at a Nov. 10
Senate Finance Committee hearing
on House and Senate climate-change
bills.
Cap-and-trade proponents argue
that the US Commodity Futures
Trading Commission successfully
regulated sulfur dioxide as a commodity under its acid rain program
in the 1990s. Witnesses at the
Finance Committee hearing said that
cap-and-trade would be much bigger
and not as focused.
“We’re talking about a huge
amount of the energy economy
which would be put into these
securities,” said Kenneth P. Green,
a resident scholar at the American
Enterprise Institute for Public Policy
Research.
Cantwell keeps raising an apparently basic question about cap-andtrade and probably will keep asking it
until she gets satisfactory answers. ✦

Some critics, he said, “want you to

2009 lease sales
Salazar noted that the Bureau of
Land Management has held 29 onshore
oil and gas lease sales so far in 2009
while the Minerals Management Service
has held two offshore lease auctions.
“Together, these sales offered more
than 55 million acres for oil and gas
development and generated more than
$931 million in revenues,” he said.
He said the US will rely on coal

to export to countries like China and
India technologies that promote carbon

OPEC: World oil demand to rise slightly in 2010
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries reported that the
world’s economic recovery will drive
global oil demand to 85.07 million b/d
in 2010, an increase of 0.9%.
In its latest monthly report, OPEC
forecast that the world economy will
grow 2.9% in 2010 after a contraction
of 1.1% this year, with the majority of
growth coming from emerging Asian
economies including China and India.
OPEC forecasts that oil demand next
year would grow 3.7% in China and

3.34% in the Middle East, while falling
1.25% in Western Europe. Meanwhile,
it said world oil demand in 2009 was
expected to drop 1.63% year-on-year to
84.31 million b/d.
In its report, OPEC also said world
oil demand was unlikely to return
to precrisis levels in the near future,
warning that sustained increase in oil
prices could erode crude demand amid
a shaky global economic recovery.
Key points of the OPEC report include:
• OPEC’s reference basket surged
$5.50/bbl, or 8%, in October to reach
$72.67/bbl. The bullish sentiment in

the market was strengthened by upward adjustments to world oil demand
following revision to GDP numbers by
the IMF. US dollar depreciation and
rising equity prices also contributed
to the upward price trend along with
counterseasonal draws in US gasoline
inventories. The basket stood at $76.50/
bbl on Nov. 10. Recent market volatility suggests that crude prices are likely

by 2.9% in 2010 after a contraction
of 1.1% in 2009. Most of the growth
is expected to come from the emerging Asian economies. China is forecast
to grow by 8% and 8.5% in 2009 and
2010 respectively, unchanged from last
month. Fueled by the unprecedented
fiscal and monetary stimulus, OECD
output is expected to show positive
growth in the third quarter. Still,
it remains to be seen when private
consumption expenditures will pick
up sufficiently as government support
fades. All major OECD regions are projected to return to growth in 2010 with
the US forecast to grow at 1.4%, the
Eurozone at 0.5% and Japan at 1.1%.
• Most of the signs are aiming toward higher world oil demand growth
in 2010; however, downward risk
factors highlight the need for caution.
World oil demand is forecast to grow
by 0.8 million b/d in 2010 following
a 1.4 million b/d contraction in 2009,
although the potential weak economic
recovery may dampen potential demand growth in the coming year. US
oil demand remains the major factor
driving 2009 demand growth. Despite
the improved performance in late summer, recent data indicates a contraction

in demand in October.
• Non-OPEC supply is forecast to
increase by 360,000 b/d in 2010 to
reach 51.2 million b/d. Brazil, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Canada, and the US
are seen to be the main contributors to
next year’s growth, while Mexico, UK,
and Norway are foreseen to experience the largest declines. OPEC natural
gas liquids and unconventional oil are
projected to reach 5.3 million b/d in
2010, indicating a significant growth
of 540,000 b/d over the current year.
In 2009, non-OPEC supply is estimated
to increase by 410,000 b/d, representing a minor upward revision from the
previous assessment. In October, OPEC
crude production averaged 28.99 million b/d, around 40,000 b/d higher
than the previous month.
• Product market sentiment improved slightly in October due to
product stock draws in the US, increasing freight movements, and relatively
higher demand from industrial sectors. However, rising crude costs have
overwhelmed positive developments
in product prices and exerted pressure
on refining margins, especially in the
Atlantic Basin. While a cold winter may
provide support for product markets
and encourage refiners to increase runs

in the coming months, excessive levels
of distillate stocks could further constrain refinery operations, impacting
crude stock movements.
• US commercial oil stocks dropped
by 19.4 million bbl in October to stand
at 1,089 million bbl, the largest draw
since December 2007. Gasoline and distillate inventories accounted for almost
half of the draw. Despite this draw,
the overhang with the 5-year average
remains considerable at around 70 million bbl. Crude oil inventories dropped
1.7 million bbl, narrowing the overhang to 22 million bbl. Although distillates fell 4.3 million bbl, the overhang
remains large. In September, Japan total
commercial oil stocks moved against
the seasonal trend, falling 11 million
bbl with preliminary data indicating
a further decline of 9 million bbl in
October.
• Demand for OPEC crude in 2009
was revised up 70,000 b/d to now
stand at 28.7 million b/d, representing
a decline of 2.3 million b/d from last
year. In 2010, demand for OPEC crude
is expected to average 28.5 million b/d,
following an upward adjustment of
110,000 b/d. This indicates a drop of
0.2 million b/d compared to the previous year. ✦

GOP members ask DOI to improve categorical exclusions
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Four US House Republicans urged
US Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to
improve, instead of jettison, categorical
exclusions in response to a recent Government Accountability Office report.
“We are deeply concerned about a
common practice of the Departments
of the Interior and Justice of settling lawsuits filed without forcefully
defending authorized agency actions,”
said Doc Hastings (Wash.), ranking
minority member of the House Natural Resources Committee, and three
other GOP members of the committee
32

in a Nov. 5 letter to Salazar.
“Specifically, a current lawsuit
is challenging the use of categorical
exclusions, a valuable tool provided by
Congress to the land management agencies to improve the government process
of approving energy production while at
the same time ensuring protection of the
environment,” they said, adding, “We
are worried that an out-of-court settlement by this department would eliminate or severely limit the use of categorical exclusions and further prohibit the
production of US oil and natural gas.”
Doug Lamborn (Colo.), ranking
minority member of the committee’s
Energy and Minerals Subcommittee;

Rob Bishop (Utah), ranking minority
member of the committee’s National
Parks Subcommitte; and Cynthia M.
Lummus (Wyo.), a committee member,
also signed the letter.
They noted that under Section 390
of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Congress directed the US Bureau of Land
Management to use categorical exclusions to expedite energy supply growth
by limiting redundant analysis and
unnecessary red tape.

‘Scalpel, not sledgehammer’

efforts to develop new guidance to
address the few issues of consistency

identified by GAO in the use of these
categorical exclusions, we are concerned that the [US] Department of the
Interior is prepared to use a sledgehammer where a scalpel would suffice,” the
four Republican lawmakers said.
They noted that in its report, GAO
recommended that errors it identified
be cleared up with resided guidance
implementation guidelines and better
oversight from state BLM offices.
“The report found many examples
where BLM failed to use categorical
exclusions or applied additional restrictions, highlighting the cautious and
overly conservative use of categorical
exclusions by BLM,” they continued.
“Categorical exclusions are not discretionary, yet GAO didn’t attempt to
quantify the one major use of BLM’s
implementation of Section 390: the
frequent violation of the law when
categorical exclusions were not used for
projects that met the criteria mandated
by Congress.”
DOI should not need to be reminded
that the Section 390 categorical exclusions are statutory, not administrative,
the four House Republicans said in
their letter. “There is nothing in the
statutory language that even mentions
extraordinary circumstances; rather,
the language is straightforward in mandating the use of categorical exclusions
when the conditions in the statute are
met,” they indicated. The law does not
give the Obama administration or DOI
discretion to decide which provisions
will be followed, they added.
They also noted that it is important
to recognize that categorical exclusions are one of EPACT’s biggest success
stories. “[Their] use in energy permitting has been accompanied by more
time available for field staff to conduct
environmental inspections and to address the backlog of [drilling permit
applications],” the federal lawmakers
said. “Field personnel recognize and
appreciate having categorical exclusions
in their management toolkit as it allows
them to efficiently process permits in a
timely manner while making educated,
common sense field decisions.” ✦

Brunei assures
Japan

J

apan’s oil and gas industry got
a bit of assurance from Brunei
after learning it will receive stable
long-term supplies of LNG from the
sultanate.
The reassurance came after some
considerable effort by the Japanese
government, including Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama who made a personal request of his counterpart from
Brunei, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah.
“I seek your cooperation in the
supply of LNG and the development of our friendly bilateral ties,”
Hatoyama told Bolkiah on the sidelines of a recent Asia-Pacific summit.
Bolkiah replied, “We’ve had a
good relationship in the past two
decades on the supply of LNG, and
there will be no problems with supply in the future.”
It was the second time in as many
weeks that Japanese officials pressed
a member of the Bolkiah family for
reassurances of Brunei’s willingness
to keep up the supplies of LNG.

ances cannot be overstated, especially
since Japan has virtually no energy
resources of its own and must rely
heavily on imports to meet its oil and
gas needs.
As for LNG, Japan imports 60 million tonnes/year from countries led
by Indonesia, Malaysia, and Australia.
Due to recent problems, it has had

redoubled it efforts to diversify its
sources of energy.

JBIC threatens

Underscoring those difficulties,
Japan Bank for International Cooperation earlier this month threatened to
withdraw its commitment to finance
the construction of an LNG plant
in Central Sulawesi if Jakarta insists
that the LNG produced there is for
domestic consumption only.

set of US refining customers, DOJ said.
According to the complaint, Cameron’s $8.25 million purchase of the
Howe Baker assets in 2005 reduced
from two to one the number of US
sellers of refinery desalters. Under the
proposed settlement, Cameron would
divest the desalter and dehydrator assets
from that purchase (the EDGE business)
and all related tangible and intangible
assets.
It also would divest a nonexclusive
license to certain Natco technology
related to refinery desalters, which uses
dual technology transformers. This dual
technology license may be used worldwide for the development, production,
sale, and service of refinery desalters
using this technology, DOJ said.

At the beginning of the millennium
oil prices were $27/bbl and essentially
remained at this level through 2003.
But soon afterwards they began a steep
climb, reaching $99 in November 2007
and a record high of $145 in July 2008.
This finally created awareness
among analysts that the world was
struggling to sustain oil production
and that it may not be possible to
increase supply beyond a certain level.
Indeed, crude oil output remained flat
at around 71 million b/d from 2004
through 2008, and during this period
the growing demand for petroleum
liquids was satisfied mainly with additional natural gas liquids.
Global crude oil production has
increased continuously from the 1900s
until 1980, when demand dropped
significantly during the last major
world recession. Production hit a low
of 53 million b/d in 1985, a huge 10
million b/d plunge from a high of 63
million b/d in 1979. It took 25 years for
demand to return to its previous trend
(Fig. 1, purple/square dots).
Astoundingly, over the last 30 years
world crude oil production has increased just 8 million b/d in spite of
the growth of offshore production—

& DEVE

L O P M E N T

from 9 million b/d in 1980 to 25 million b/d in 2008—and the existence of
a shut-in spare capacity of 10 million
b/d from the 1980 recession—a total
of 26 million b/d of available output.
Onshore production in the mean time
has remained flat, around 46 million
b/d over the last 2 decades (Fig. 2).
This disproportionately diminished
net production increase of 8 million
b/d over a 30-year
period results
from the perverse synergy that
occurs between
reserves depletion
and production
decline.
Global exploration and production trends for crude oil over the last
8 decades are disturbing (Table 1).
Discoveries of new reserves grew from
an average of 19 billion bbl/year in the
1930s to a peak of 55 billion bbl/year
in the 1960s. Thereafter they have declined continuously, reaching 15 billion
bbl/year in the 1990s and 10 billion
bbl/year in this millennium.
New reserves markedly exceeded
oil production (depletion of reserves)
up through the 1970s. At the zenith of

exploration successes in the 1960s they
were five times production, but from
the 1980s to the present, the reserves/
production relationship has become
inverted—today’s production rate is
three times that of discoveries, 26 versus 10 billion bbl/year.
Reserves are the foundation of production potential. If the reserves base
is being depleted, production capacity
inevitably declines, and this clearly has
been the situation since the 1980s.
These shortcomings of discoveries
are not due to a lack of spending as
some have suggested. Global E&P capex
has increased fourfold in this millennium, to over $450 billion in 2008.

Crude oil supply
The logistic model has proved to
aptly handle the upstream fundamentals of reserves growth/depletion and
production growth/decline of oil and
gas fields and their clusters as in the
case of country analyses.
Fig. 3 shows the global outlook for
crude oil production capacity through
the end of the century using this model. Superimposed on the graph are the
demand projections of the US Energy
Information Administration through
2030. Supply and demand projections
begin to decouple early on.

ply sources that make up the total petroleum liquids output. Crude oil is the
most important source and accounts for
83% of the total.
The crude oil production potential
of the reserves as estimated by the logistic model is also shown in the table.
The crude oil outlooks of the IEA outpace production capacity in 2015 and
2030, with shortfalls of 1.7 million b/d
and 12.7 million b/d, respectively.
More outstandingly, however, the
IEA’s outlook shows continued growth
in crude oil production while the logistic model indicates decline. It is also
worth noting the importance of NGLs
in the supply mix. NGL production
would have to double by 2030, to 20
million b/d.
The IEA also provides a breakdown
of expected oil outputs for the world’s
seven oil producing regions (Table
3). Production in four of the regions
(North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific,
and Latin America) is on the decline,
leaving three regions (Middle East, Eurasia, and Africa) to provide the necessary volumes to meet demand by 2030.
With the Middle East region having
the highest expectations, it would have
to increase its current output by 67%.
Africa and Eurasia would have to increase their present production by 27%
and 25%, respectively. These assumptions of output growth are conditioned

Deepwater markets
Contractors report a brisk business
off Africa for both drillships and semisubmersibles.
The newbuild ultradeepwater drillship Petrobras 10000 has commenced
operations off Angola under a 10-year

Zug, Switzerland, has an agreement
with the P&M Drilling International
BV joint venture of Petroleo Brasileiro
SA (Petrobras) and Mitsui to acquire
the rig under a 20-year capital lease
contract.
The Petrobras 10,000 features dualactivity drilling technology that allows
for cost-saving parallel drilling operations. Built at a South Korean shipyard,
the drillship has the capability of drilling in more that 10,000 ft of water.
Petrobras aggressively plans to
increase its rig capacity by chartering
up to 28 ultradeepwater drilling units.
The company has said it would like
drillships, and possibly semis, built in
Brazil for delivery during 2013-18.

Modifications to the

tion scheme required a
detailed engineering approach followed by construction work
carried out by multiple companies.
The first part of this two-part series
(OGJ, Nov. 16, 2009, p. 43) on debottlenecking the Weyburn injection
scheme described the design parameters; this concluding part covers the
steps involved in the detailed design
and construction.

P&IDs
Upon completion or near comple-

tion of the new process flow diagrams
and material balances, as discussed in
Part 1, the next step involved revision of the plant’s existing piping and
instrumentation drawings (P&IDs). The
new P&IDs showed all new equipment
such as the pumps, heat exchangers,
and other skids.
During the preparation of the P&IDs,
the detailed work also included the
sizing of all secondary equipment and
interconnecting piping and cable.
After completion and approval by

engineering followed.

pressors. The analysis used an API 618
Design Approach 2 (M.2-M.4).
The pulsation analysis also looked
at the existing pulsation bottles and
orifice plates and found that the bottles
were reusable but new orifice plates
were needed.
The mechanical analysis recommended:
• Dynamic rigid supports on the
first and second-stage suction piping.
• Third-stage suction bottle rigidly
supported from a stiffened existing Aframe support.
• Rigid support for all scrubbers
to maximize the mechanical natural
frequency, which is a potential vibrations source.
• Adjustment of the discharge bottle
support to maintain preload contact.
During start-up, a piping vibration
survey was performed.

Interconnecting piping

The injection pumps are in the two long buildings in the lower left. The pipe rack coming out of pump
buildings goes towards the aerial compressor coolers. Two variable-frequency-drive buildings are to the
right of the pump buildings. Two transformers are behind the VFD buildings. The Heatric exchangers’
open skid is visible behind the pump-skid building (Fig. 1).

Based on the P&IDs and the acoustical analysis, the design work created
the detailed 3D piping models for
fabricating all new spools and interconnecting piping.
The plant piping 3D layout for the
restaged compressors, exchangers, and
pumps identified the valves and instruments to make the turnaround piping
installation and instrument replacement
more efficient and easy.
After completion of the 3D piping
design, the next step preformed a stress
analysis on the piping with Caesar II
software. This required importing the
3D Autocad model and analyzing all
the new headers with the program.
The analysis passed all the stresses
to which the piping would be exposed,

proved useful throughout the project.

Compressor blowdown
Fig. 4 is a simplified schematic of a
single compression train to help visualize the blowdown procedure.
In the event of a plant emergency,
the standard procedure requires blowing down the gas to the plant flare.
This entails the closing of the inlet and
outlet emergency shutdown valves and
depressuring the piping and equipment
to the flare.
The gas can form hydrates when it is
blown down from high pressure as in

wet. In addition, it is extremely hazardous to try to contain this gas at high
pressure. With any minute temperature
change, the gas can expand and overpressure the piping or vessels.
Falcon performed the blowdown
calculations to avoid hydrates or containing the gas for long periods.

final pressure obtained in this step is
500 kPa (75 psi), the final pressure in
the partial blowdown sequence.
Tables 1 and 2 summarize the blowdown sequence pressures, temperatures, and times for depressuring each
step up to Step 4.
To prevent hydrates from plugging
the blowdown valve BV-1 and the flare
lines, the scheme includes a flare heater
before BV-1. Gas passes through the
flare heater and a temperature indicator
controller (TIC) monitors the temperature before the blowdown valve BV-1.
When the low set point temperature
and pressure are not met, the valve
throttles or closes until the gas heats
up to the desired temperature. Using
Tables 2 and 3, one can predict the hydrate point (temperature and pressure)
and avoid blowing down at a critical
temperature for the steps involved in
Table 2.
The temperature set points of the
TIC are pressure-dependent (measured
by a pressure-indicating transmitter)

and related to the hydrate temperature
at that pressure. Table 3 shows the
hydrate temperatures at different pressures.

Construction
EnCana managed the construction
at the plant. The company divided the
work among four local companies and
two Calgary-based companies. All work
proceeded quickly and costs were kept
on budget. The accompanying box
shows a summary of the work performed by each company
Construction and start-up went
very well. Only one issue arose during
construction. Operations requested to
invert the compressor feeding the initially designated respective pump.
This involved a change in the main
drawings; however, the skid drawings
tags were not changed because construction on the skids started considerably earlier. Subsequently, this led to
changing the equipment control and
indication wiring between pumps.

P-1

The pumps started up and ran
smoothly after 2 weeks.
As discussed in Part 1, the pump
curves did not reflect the required
horsepower per pump and required an
upgrade to 600-hp motors.

Lessons learned
Several things were learned from
this project.
Designing the injection scheme
revealed that the gas behavior of mostly
CO2 (76% and above) recycle gas varies
considerably for different temperatures.
Above the critical point, the design
requires specific gravities from reliable and consistent models. Although it
is possible to pump the recycle gas in
dense phase under certain circumstances, knowing the temperature at which
it is pumped is critical because of the
rapid changes in density.
The design requires pump curves
that accurately predict pump horsepower draw (with the corresponding
operating efficiency) and liquid flowOil & Gas Journal / Nov. 23, 2009

rate for the fluid’s specific gravity. If
possible, it is advisable to run the pump
at the actual conditions of operation
and confirm the points on the curve for
flow vs. horsepower draw and flow vs.
pressure differential (∆P).
Pumping dense-phase CO2 at the
right conditions is much more cost
effective than compression. There are
some constraints because the process
requires a compressor initially to obtain
the dense-phase pressure.
The scheme requires a careful
study for selecting the optimal cost
for the compression-pumping of the
recycle gas. Retrofitting a reciprocating
compressor requires that restaging is
feasible and that the gas have the right
specific gravity/dense phase (controlled
by the temperature after compression
entering the pump).
EnCana operations reports that the
reciprocating compressor and pump
combination is stable and operates
smoothly when the ambient conditions
are below 15° C. (60° F.) and easily
achieves a flow of 1.134 million cu m/
day (40 MMscfd). During the summer months, the pump capacity varies
more, and the combination can usually
be operated at 964,000 cu m/day (34
MMscfd).
The advantage of reciprocating
vs. centrifugal compressors is that
reciprocating compressors can compress water-saturated gas. Centrifugal
compressors cannot tolerate any water
saturation on the impellers.
Printed circuit heat exchangers are
sensitive to impurities in the gas. They
are prone to fouling easily. The Weyburn project team installed strainers
before gas entry into the exchangers.
Unfortunately, asphaltenes and other
solids contaminate both the purchased
CO2 and the EnCana recycle gas. Operations found it problematic to maintain
the strainers on line for very long.
Because of the operating conditions of
both streams (high pressure and high
CO2 content), the field considered the
strainers almost inoperable. ✦

that required substantial reductions in
harmful components in gasoline and
diesel. Table 1 summarizes the new
guidelines.1 2
Use of industrial gases can play a
major role in a refinery’s compliance
with these and other new requirements. For instance, desulfurization of
products can be increased—as required
by the regulations—by increased use
of hydrogen. The reduced capacity of
Claus plants due to increased desulfurization can be compensated for by use
of oxygen.
The three-part series, which this
article inaugurates, will discuss the effects of developments on refineries and
their utilization of gases. At the same
time, it will become clear that use of
industrial gases offers possibilities for
meeting the new requirements while
avoiding major investments in new
plants.

of hydrogen and nitrogen. Part 2 (OGJ,

a survey of the specific hydrogen consumption of the various hydrogenation
processes, depending on the feedstock
used.6
Catalytic reforming or platforming
is the principal producer of hydrogen
in a refinery. From 125 to 315 std. cu
m/ton of feed can be produced in the
process. Hydrogen production is much
smaller in the fluid catalytic cracking
process and in thermal processes such
as visbreaking, in which hydrogen
can amount to 2-16 std. cu m/ton of
feedstock.
We can estimate, on a crude oil
basis, that a crude oil with about 15 wt
% naphtha will yield hydrogen in the
reformer to the extent of about 0.4 to
0.6 wt % of the crude oil.
To make up the rest of the hydrogen
requirement resulting from the developments described, it will be necessary
to produce more and more hydrogen.
The following processes are the main
ones currently in use:
• Generation by steam reforming of
methane.
• Gasification of residues from petroleum processing, obtaining hydrogen from the synthesis gas.
• Recovery from refinery gases,

The local cooling of the
deposit when contacted by
dry ice sheers off the deposit
from the material below and
forms cracks in the deposit’s
surface. Dry ice particles hitting the surface at high speed
partially liquefy similar to
ice under the skates of an ice
skater. This liquid CO2 diffuses into the cracks formed in
the deposits and is vaporized
there. It expands eventually
and thus helps to remove the
deposit and push it into the
blasting gas stream, which
takes it out of the equipment
cleaned.
As the process leaves no
residue of blasting agent,
it is often possible to clean
components in place. Therefore, the time for dismantling
and reassembly is reduced
and often even the heating
phase of items can be omitted. The nonabrasive action of
the process also increases the
lifetimes of the components.
Because the process is easily
controlled, even complex
units can be cleaned easily.
There have been very good
results for the following substances, among others: oils,
fats, waxy substances, salt
deposits, anticorrosion paints,
adhesives, and resins. ✦

CATHODIC SHIELDING BY
DISBONDED COATINGS
Why you need
Polyguard RD-6

Disbonded coating
with moisture
underneath.

Graphic Illustration of Shielding

Extracted from NACE document “Coating Failure Definitions in Relation to CP”
Definition of “Shielding With No Holiday”
“A substantial diversion of cathodic current away from its intended target (i.e.steel substrate) due to a disbonded coating with a
high dielectric characteristic and no holidays on the disbonded coating. Steel substrate is deprived of protective current and
corrosion can continue undetected and unchecked, including MIC activity, until failure occurs. Traditional diagnostic techniques
such as CIS and DCVG cannot identify the existence of such anomalies.”
DISBONDMENT
Even the best coatings can
disbond in areas over time.
Disbondment risk is greatest
with girth weld coatings which
are application sensitive and
subject to soil stress.

HIGH DIELECTRIC
Corrosion coatings with solid
film backing have this high
dielectric characteristic.

INSIDIOUS #1
We at Polyguard believe that the
problem of shielding disbonded
coatings is one of the most
serious in the pipeline industry.
Our belief is reinforced as large
operators who discover the
shielding problem convert to
our RD-6 coating system.

INSIDIOUS #2
Shielding hides corrosion
not only from CP, but also from
common diagnostic techniques.
Shielding is truly an insidious
phenomenon.

Two corrosion coatings are proven to be non-shielding, that is to allow passage of protective CP current into disbonded areas. One
of these is FBE. The other is the Polyguard RD-6 coating system. After 21 years, and thousands of installations, there has been no
significant metal loss found under the Polyguard RD-6 coating system.

products may cause disbonding of nonmetallic coatings

processes at the metal-coating interface. The buildup
of hydrogen pressure at this
interface may also contribute
to disbonding. Heat flow to
the metal-coating interface
can accelerate this cathodic
disbanding process on
components containing hot
fluids.1
Coating disbondment
results in more bare steel
surface exposure to the
environment, increasing the cathodic
protection current necessary to maintain protection. The required protective current eventually may exceed the
capabilities of the CP system. The steel
surfaces shielded by disbonded coating debris also may not get enough
current to be protected. If an acidic
liquid intrudes between coating and
steel surface, corrosion would be severe
especially at elevated temperature.
The cathodic reaction on the steel
surface with CP applied leads to reduction of the hydrogen ion in acidic
environments.7 According to the Nernst
equation, the hydrogen redox potential will be shifted more positive with
lower pH.7 The hydrogen reduction line
moves to the right at lower pH, and
in sequence, the corrosion potential
of steel shifts more positive, requiring
more protective current to achieve the
same cathodic protection level in lower
pH environments.
The preliminary experiment results
shown in Fig. 7 demonstrate the corrosion potential shifting more positive
at a lower pH and requiring a higher
protection current to maintain the CP
system at the same protective potential. Higher cathodic current, however,
could also generate more hydrogen,
potentially exacerbate coating disbondment.

complexity of the design can also add
substantially to the cost of a launcher.
Opening a trap closure also has
health, safety, and environmental
implications. These issues become even
more complex when pigging from an
unmanned platform or during a remote
subsea operation. Mechanisms built
into the pigs rather than the launcher
control pig launching by AMPL, negating the need for human intervention
and reducing the intensity and risk of
regular pigging activities.
ITF worked with PE to secure industry support from four of its member
companies for an AMPL Joint Industry
Project to be carried out in two phases.
Following successful completion of
Phase 1, PE secured further support
for two sets of field trials to assess the
overall system performance and functionality and gain further understanding of the bypass systems on individual
AMPL tools.
JIP participants used a 10-in. AMPL
system for the first set of field trials,
recently completed at the Petrofac facility in Montrose, Scotland. These trials
successfully launched and received the
AMPL pigs at flow velocities of 0.5 m/
sec and 1 m/sec (14,000 and 28,000
b/d, respectively). The pigs launched
successfully and confirmed tests previously undertaken at PE’s North Yorkshire base to test and validate AMPL’s
setup before mobilization to the Montrose base.

Montrose test
The AMPL system cassette was
loaded with three suitably configured
pigs. Earlier flow tests had shown
this configuration to be successful at
launching individual pigs with the
fluid flow rate set to 0.5 m/sec. Fig. 1
shows data produced from this multiple
launch test.
This first test demonstrated the
AMPL system launching while the pipeline was operating at 14,129 b/d. Both

into the pig launcher.
Opening Valve V1 (Fig. 2) flooded
the launcher and brought it to operating pressure. Opening Valve V2
allowed product flow through the
launcher, cassette, and pigs. Closing
Valve V3 diverted flow through the
launcher. At about 300 sec the lead

the pig signaler, product was allowed
to continue flowing through the trap
for an additional 300 sec to test for

1,400 sec launch of the second AMPL
pig happened, again confirmed by
the pig signaler. The trap remained
flooded after once again being de68

pressurized.
During the
launch of the
second AMPL pig,
detectors signaled receipt of the lead
pig. Isolating and draining the receiver
to retrieve the pig confirmed only the
lead pig had launched. The receiver was
flooded and repressurized ready for
receipt of the second AMPL pig.
At around 3,200 sec, technicians
pressurized the launcher again, operating the valves by the same process
as the first two pigs. Launch detection of the final AMPL pig occurred at
about 3,500 sec, confirming individual
launch of each the AMPL pigs. During
the launch of this final pig, the receipt
of the second AMPL pig was detected.
Immediately retrieving the pig confirmed its individual launch.
The pipeline continued operating
until around 5,000 sec when the final
AMPL pig was detected and retrieved
in the receiver. The pipeline was shut
down and data retrieved.

The next stage of field trials will
take place in Oman, where AMPL will
be tested in an 8-in. OD oil pipeline
about 9 km long and currently under a
fortnightly pigging schedule. ✦

Credibility claim
shows low quality
of climate debate
Everything wrong about debate over
climate change congealed in a single
sentence at a Senate Finance Committee
hearing Nov. 10.
The words came from Sen. John Kerry
(D-Mass.) in response to warnings about
costs of the cap-and-trade legislation he
has sponsored with Sen. Barbara Boxer
(D-Calif.).
“Your studies aren’t credible because

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

you haven’t considered the impacts of
inaction,” Kerry said (OGJ Online, Nov.
11, 2009). In other words, the senator isn’t
listening. He and his allies promote an
apocalyptic view of planetary warming
in response to which they hope to seize
control of energy markets.
With the help of a dazzled popular
media, they have succeeded in polarizing
discourse into two camps: believers and
nonbelievers. As Kerry’s flippant dismissal
of serious warnings by serious adults
makes clear, nonbelievers aren’t welcome
in the debate.
Before he’ll take seriously the possibility that cap-and-trade legislation might idle
8 million b/d of US refining capacity and
raise the price of oil products by $1/gal, he
wants those highlighting the threat also to
present the “impacts of inaction.”
Yet all the senator needs to do is look
around. If his dangerous bill doesn’t pass,
things won’t change much.
Yes, carbon dioxide will further accumulate in the atmosphere. Depending on
climate mechanics no one yet knows how
to predict accurately, the accumulation
might enhance global warming that was
going to happen anyway but seems lately
to have stalled. Or it might not. Global
average temperature responds to many
influences beyond human emissions of
CO2, some of them much stronger. People
can’t affect it much.
In fact, Kerry should confess to the
temperature impacts of action on his bill:
nothing. A cap-and-trade scheme won’t
influence temperature. It will just raise energy costs and make the US more popular
than it is now among the ruling elite of
Europe.
Still, moderating CO2 emissions—
like the companion tactic of moderating energy use—makes sense. It can be
done, however, without nationalizing
energy consumption and destabilizing the
economy. Toward such sensible aims the
first step should be to shed comic-book
panic about climate catastrophe.
But don’t expect Kerry to listen.

J o u r n a l

Crude trades in tight price range
After trading over a fairly tight range for more than 4 months on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the front-month crude contract finally broke through to the
upside only to trade within an even tighter range of $79-80/bbl through 19 days in
late October and early November.
There was no explosive breakout—“just a subtle adjustment of the range, and
market dynamics have returned to being a fairly relaxed chess game,” said Paul
Horsnell, managing director and head of commodities research at Barclays Capital
in London. “The immediate floor to prices has been moving up, beyond $70/bbl
and perhaps as high as $75/bbl, and the downside below that has become more
protected by a continuing flow of reasonably supportive macroeconomic and
global oil data,” he said.
Energy prices fell Nov. 12 with benchmark US light, sweet crudes down $2.34 to
$76.94/bbl on NYMEX as traders focused on a US Energy Information Administration report of a larger than expected increase in crude inventories during the previous week. Prices continued to decline Nov. 13 as low as $75.57/bbl before closing
at $76.35/bbl.
Crude prices rebounded in early trading Nov. 16 on news China’s economy—
second only to the US—beat expectations and grew at an annual rate of 4.8% in
the third quarter, said analysts in the Houston office of Raymond James & Associates Inc. China’s power consumption was reported up 16% from 2008. A declining dollar and growing speculation that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries will leave production unchanged at its December meeting helped boost
the price of crude Nov. 16.
EIA reported commercial US benchmark crude inventories increased 1.8 million
bbl to 337.7 million bbl in the week ended Nov. 6, the latest period at press time.
That surpassed Wall Street’s consensus of a 1 million bbl gain but was well below
the American Petroleum Institute’s more-bearish report of a 3.2 million bbl build.
Gasoline stocks for the same week were up 2.5 million bbl to 210.8 million, while
analysts expected a 400,000 bbl draw. Distillate fuel inventories increased 300,000
bbl to 167.7 million bbl, also above average and in the opposite direction of analysts’ anticipation of a 700,000 bbl decrease.
Refinery runs
Imports of crude into the US in that period were up 530,000 b/d to 8.7 million
b/d. In the 4 weeks through Nov. 6, crude imports averaged 8.6 million b/d, down
1.5 million b/d from the comparable period in 2008. Nonetheless, the input of
crude into US refineries dropped 145,000 b/d to 13.8 million b/d during the week
with units operating at 79.9% of capacity as refiners continued to reduce utilization
rates due to weak refining margins. Jacques H. Rousseau, an analyst at Soleil-Back
Bay Research, said it was the first time in years refinery utilization dropped below
80% “absent hurricane-related shutdowns.” He said, “With refining margins near
their lowest level of 2009, we expect this lower supply trend to continue for the remainder of the quarter. The fourth quarter should be the worst quarter of the year
for refiner earnings, in our view.”
Rousseau added, “EIA regional data showed a continued trend of rising West
Coast gasoline inventories, which have increased 9% over the past 4 weeks.
Surprisingly, despite very weak refining margins, utilization rates increased in the
Rocky Mountains (from 81% to 86%) and West Coast (from 85% to 87%) regions
last week, which could raise inventory levels further in those markets in the coming weeks.”
Horsnell said Nov. 12, “Plenty of support seems to have built up beneath prices
to reduce the sustainability of any sharper moves to the downside. There has also
been a degree of increased control over the upside to prices, further compressing
the recent trading range. In our view, since the break out above $75/bbl occurred,
the nature of the selling pressure at the top of the range…appears less motivated
by macro shorts and technicals, and now seems to contain a greater component
of reference towards the policy of, and signals from, major oil producers. Those
signals are rarely as frequent or quite as subtle as the market often imagines, but
the general message has emerged that an immediate charge towards $90/bbl is
likely to be overtly damped. In the absence of clearer indications, the market is
currently trading as if somewhere around $80/bbl is the safest ceiling, and as if too
fast a progression beyond that might attract a more overt damping strategy from
producers.”

Exhibit Today
Expanding Sustainably
Growth requires the oil sands and heavy oil industry to make steady, long-term
progress along a narrow road for which no map exists.
On one side loom the high costs of extracting, processing, and transporting
unconventional hydrocarbons.
On the other side are environmental performance standards that toughen with
time and that the industry never must fail to meet.
Each step along this road requires innovation. Each must withstand
unpredictable economic changes. Each must uphold eternal values of nature
and society.

On this road, the beacon for progress is technology, advances in which will
control the costs, improve the environmental performance, and assure the
sustainability of an industry crucial to oil supplies – now and in the future.
The Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition is the
premier showcase for the knowledge and methods of this fascinating business.
Take this opportunity to present your product or service to a powerful, influential
audience. Join PennWell Petroleum Events in this fourth year conference and

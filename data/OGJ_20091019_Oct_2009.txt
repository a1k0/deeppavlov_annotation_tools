Iraq signs oil security pact with Britain

The combination is expected to close by Dec. 11 and will retain the Chaparral name. Founded in 1988, Chaparral has a large
inventory of low-risk exploitation prospects as well as near-term,
high-potential drilling projects. Since 2003, management has increased the company’s reserves and production by 21%/year. At
the end of June, it had proved reserves of 146 million boe, 62%
of which is oil. Production in this year’s first half averaged 21,000
boe/d.
United Refining in New York was formed last December to acquire energy assets through merger, capital stock exchange, asset
acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or similar combinations. At the end of September, it held $452 million in trust.
Chaparral has acquired and enhanced properties in its core areas of the Midcontinent and the Permian basin, as well as in the
Gulf Coast, the Ark-La-Tex region, North Texas, and the Rocky
Mountains. It has several enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects
under way using carbon dioxide injection and has identified other
candidates with the potential for substantial reserve and production growth, said company officials.
John A. Catsimatidis, United Refining’s chief executive and
chairman, will become executive chairman of the combined
company. Chaparral’s senior management will remain in place,
including cofounder Mark A. Fischer, chairman and chief executive; Joseph O. Evans, chief financial officer; and Robert W. Kelly
II, senior vice-president and general counsel.
“Chaparral’s management team has demonstrated the ability to

Fischer said, “This merger will give Chaparral access to capital

we need to exploit our large inventory of drilling and development
opportunities and to significantly step up our EOR program.” ✦
Iraq’s parliament signed an agreement allowing as many as 100
British Royal Navy Trainers to return for up to a year to help Iraq
protect its vital southern oil export terminals.
“The parliament passed the Iraqi-British security pact,” said
Abbas al-Bayati, a member of parliament’s security and defense
committee. Without explanation, he said a bloc of politicians
withdrew from the vote.
The British security pact failed to pass during parliamentary
sessions in July because of opposition from some politicians, particularly those loyal to Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who reject any
foreign troop presence in Iraq.
In August, Iraq’s South Oil Co. let a project management contract to AOC Holdings subsidiary Japan Oil Engineering (JOE) for
front-end engineering and design to restore and upgrade southern
Iraq’s Fao export oil terminal.
Under the contract valued at ¥3 billion, JOE and Yachiyo Engineering Co. will help South Oil Co. design pipelines to connect
a land-based oil storage facility with two sea-based shipping terminals 50 km off Basra in the Persian Gulf (OGJ Online, Aug. 6,
2009).
Most of Iraq’s 2 million b/d of oil exports are shipped through
the two oil terminals off Basra, where Iraq also faces problems
with oil smugglers, border disputes with Iran, and a host of other
security issues.

ExxonMobil reportedly buying stake in Jubilee
ExxonMobil Corp. reportedly has agreed to buy a stake in Jubilee oil field off Ghana from privately owned Kosmos Energy
LLC, several media organizations have said. The Financial Times
reported that the pending transaction was worth $4 billion.
“ExxonMobil routinely evaluates potential development opportunities around the world. We do not comment on the details
of commercial discussions or opportunities,” Patrick McGinn,
ExxonMobil spokesman for upstream media relations, told OGJ
in an e-mail.
A sale would require approval from Ghana’s government, legal experts have said. Tullow Oil PLC operates Jubilee and owns
34.7%. Kosmos owns 23.49%. Other partners include Anadarko

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Petroleum Corp. 23.49% and Ghana National Petroleum Corp.
13.75%.
ExxonMobil already holds some of the largest acreages in West
Africa including operations in Angola, Nigeria, Chad, Equatorial
Guinea, and Niger. Ghana is part of an emerging play in northern
West Africa. The play includes Sierra Leone (OGJ, Sept. 28, 2009,
p. 36.)
Raymond James & Associates analysts said there do not appear to be any proved reserves associated with this deal, but the
unbooked resource potential of Jubilee is estimated at 600-1,800
MMboe gross.
“This is Exxon’s first entry into Ghana, and it has plenty of cash
on hand to do so—$16 billion as of second-quarter 2009,” RJA

said. “The major’s move signals growing interest in the area and
bodes well for future development.”
Kosmos is led by James Musselman, formerly Triton Energy
Ltd. chief executive officer. Triton discovered oil off Equatorial
Guinea before Triton was sold in 2001 to Amerada Hess Corp.,
which is now Hess Corp.

Newfield, Hess plan Marcellus joint venture
Newfield Exploration Co. and Hess Corp. plan to start drilling
in 2010 on a joint exploration venture to exploit gas in Devonian
Marcellus shale in northeastern Pennsylvania.
Newfield will operate the 50-50 venture, which covers as much
as 140,000 gross acres in Susquehanna and Wayne counties.
Newfield noted it has gained shale gas experience in the
Woodford shale in Oklahoma’s Arkoma basin since 2003. It now
has nearly 300 MMcfd of gas equivalent gross operated production capacity in 300 horizontal wells, and its 165,000 net acres are
almost entirely held by production.
Hess has built unconventional oil expertise in the Williston
basin Bakken oil play in North Dakota with horizontal wells and
multistage fracturing. The two companies expect to finalize agreements in coming weeks for the Appalachian basin program.

Total starts development on Timimoun project
Algeria’s Sonatrach, Total SA, and Cepsa said the Algerian National Oil and Gas Development Agency has approved their development plan for the Timimoun natural gas project in Algeria.
According to Total, the approval is the outcome of an exploration and appraisal program begun in 2003, during which six wells

Total said development work should begin in the fourth quarter, with gas production scheduled to start in 2013. Timimoun
is expected to produce about 1.6 billion cu m/year of gas at its
peak.

Eni adds to exploration acreage in Pakistan
In a joint venture with Pakistan Petroleum Ltd. (PPL) and Royal
Dutch Shell PLC, Italy’s Eni SPA, as operator, won an exploration
license for onshore Sukhpur block in the Sindh province north of
Karachi, Pakistan, near Eni-operated producing areas of Bhit and
Badhra.
During a recent meeting in Rome with Pakistan President Asif
Zardari, Eni Chief Executive Paolo Scaroni expressed his company’s commitment to share its expertise and technology in the
development of Pakistan’s oil and sector under the Protocol of Cooperation signed last March with the Pakistani government.
Reuters news service quoted a Pakistani official as saying Eni
is likely to double its investment in Pakistan to $3 billion as early
as next year. However, Scaroni said future investments depend on
new discoveries.
Eni also is exploring for gas and oil off Pakistan. Longer term,
Scaroni said he’s interested in transporting gas from Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, and Iran—where Eni now operates—to markets
in Pakistan, India, and China. He said Zardari supports Eni’s ambition to initiate that project.
The Italian company has been in Pakistan since 2000 and was
the first international company involved in exploration and production of gas with an equity production of 56,000 boe/d. It holds
15 exploration licenses (3 offshore and 12 onshore), and 7 production or development licenses (3 operated) in that country. ✦

Kazakhs peg Khvalynskoye field at $5 billion
Development of Khvalynskoye natural gas field in Kazakhstan’s
sector of the Caspian Sea will cost $5 billion in the first phase,
Kairgeldy Kabyldin, chief executive officer of state-owned KazMunaiGaz (KMG), told delegates at the Kazakhstan International
Oil & Gas Exhibition & Conference.
Kabyldin’s remarks follow a statement by Total SA that it signed
a heads of agreement (HOA) establishing the principles of a partnership with KMG for development of Khvalynskoye.
Located in 25 m of water in the Caspian Sea on the border between Kazakhstan and Russia, Khvalynskoye is a conventional gascondensate field to be developed by Russia’s OAO Lukoil, operator.
Gas from the field will go to Russia.
Total and GDF Suez Group will invest $1 billion in the project,
which is expected to start producing as much as 9 billion cu m/
year of gas in 2016.
The agreement, which boosts Total’s role in the region, was
signed in the presence of Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev
and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who was on a visit to Ka8

Operation of the Timimoun project will be jointly conducted by the stakeholders: Sonatrach 51%, Total 37.75%, and Cepsa
11.25%. The development plan entails drilling around 40 wells to
tap eight structures over an area of 2,500 sq km.
The plan also includes construction of gas gathering and processing facilities, as well as a connection to the Sonatrach pipeline
that will carry gas from fields in west-central Algeria to Hassi
R’Mel.

zakhstan (OGJ Online, Oct. 6, 2009).
Khvalynskoye is jointly owned with Lukoil, which said it had
not concluded a production-sharing contract with KMG yet and
would keep its 50% stake.
Meanwhile, under the terms of the HOA, Total and GDF Suez
will acquire a participation of 25% (Total 17%, GDF Suez 8%)
from the initial 50% stake held by KMG.

The North Sea, 56 40.41 N, 2 56.19 E, 4:15 PM

With nasty corrosive fluids constantly tormenting
his control lines, Ola Hansen is really worried.

Engineered materials.
Sandvik specializes in duplex, super-duplex,
hyper-duplex steels and other advanced
alloys. They are extremely resistant to
corrosion caused by salt and aggressive
chemicals otherwise threatening oil and
gas operations. The remarkable mechanical
strength of these materials also allows
more compact system designs, lighter tube
installations and more versatile wirelines.

If you’re a senior engineer on a busy platform in the North Sea
– and responsible for subsea and downhole operations – then you
know all about the horrors your control lines are exposed to.
Especially at one kilometer below sea level and another kilometer
into the ground.
You’re also fully aware of the nightmare that would result from
a sudden failure or other serious malfunction of those missioncritical lines.
Such knowledge tends to make many people rather nervous.
While others stay remarkably assured, never seeming to give their
installations much of a thought.
Their secret? Tubulars made of engineered materials from Sandvik.

Materials that will resist just about any subsea or downhole torture
imaginable.
As the oil and gas industry is up against more hostile operating
conditions, Sandvik’s cure is more innovative metallurgical technology and more advanced materials.
By continuously developing new, higher grades of these materials,
we’re able to produce lighter, yet tougher tubes. Tubes that withstand corrosion, pressure, high temperatures and mechanical stress
better than ever before.
Engineered materials from Sandvik. Possibly your best insurance
against bad news.

Qatar inaugurates Pearl GTL control room
Qatar Energy Minister Abdulla bin Hamad Al-Attiyah inaugurated the central control room at the massive 140,000 b/d Pearl
gas-to-liquids (GTL) plant in Qatar.
The move signifies that commissioning of the project—which
will produce liquid transport fuels and 120,000 boe/d of natural
gas liquids and ethane—is imminent. This project is expected to
position Qatar as the GTL capital of the world.
The central control room is a large hushed chamber, with four
main banks of high-powered computers. It comprises almost 1,000
control cabinets hosting 179 servers that are programmed with 12
million lines of software code. The system is linked to every part
of the plant by about 5,850 km of underground cables.
“While testing begins on the many thousands of pieces of
equipment that have already been installed in the plant, construction continues and is expected to be complete around the end of
2010. Production ramp-up will then take around 12 months,” said
Pearl partner Royal Dutch Shell PLC.
Shell is buiding the plant in partnership with Qatar Petroleum.
Peter Voser, Shell chief executive officer, hosted a senior Qatari
delegation that also included Mohammed Saleh Al-Sada, minister
of state for energy and industry affairs, Qatar Petroleum directors,
and members of the Pearl GTL management committee.
Voser said, “Over 48,000 people are working on the Pearl GTL
site—the largest single construction site in the oil and gas industry

Suncor plans work for Alberta oil sands plant
Suncor Energy Inc., Calgary, let a contract to KBR Canada to
carry out turnaround services next year for its oil sands plant in
Fort McMurray, Alta.
KBR Canada will provide turnaround planning, management,
and execution for the shutdown and maintenance of the plant,
including direct-hire labor resources and management of subcontractors.
Other services include planning, scheduling, change management, cost estimating, forecasting, and integrating KBR’s work
with Suncor and other turnaround participants.
Over the next decade, Suncor plans to double oil sands production from the plant to more than 500,000 b/d.
Last month Suncor Energy reported average oil sands production of 302,000 b/d. Year-to-date, oil sands production at the end
of September averaged 295,000 b/d. “Production volumes were
impacted by planned maintenance to a vacuum unit, which began
on Sept. 8,” the company said. ✦

Petrobras starts refining of first presalt crude
Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) began refining
264,000 bbl from Tupi field—its first load of oil from the presalt
region—at the Henrique Lage refinery in Sao Jose dos Campos,
Sao Paulo state.
Petrobras said Tupi’s oil is rated as “paraphinic” and, according
to the Bureau of Mines characterization factor, its specific gravity
is 29.2° gravity, equivalent to a density of 0.877.
“This oil’s sulfur level is low—the lower, the easier it is to meet
future, increasingly strict specifications for all derivatives and particularly for naphtha and diesel,” the Brazilian firm said.
Additionally, it said that oil coming from the Tupi Field has
“low naphthenic acidity and good yield, as it does not generate
fuel oil, the product with the least value added.”
The Tupi reservoir lies more than 3,000 meters under the seabed, beneath 2,000 meters of salt, in 2,140-meter-deep waters
300-km off the São Paulo state coast.
According to Petrobras, recoverable volumes in the Tupi area
are estimated at 5-8 billion bbl of “high-quality, light oil and natural gas.” ✦

The $5 billion, 600,000-tonne FLNG facility is expected to take
5 years to build.
Meanwhile, Shell intends to drill eight subsea production wells
on its Prelude and Concerto gas discoveries in the Browse basin 475 km north-northeast of Broome. Development drilling is
scheduled to begin in 2013 and take 2 years. The wells will be
tied back to subsea manifolds before being connected to the FLNG
vessel via flowlines and riser.
The vessel tow from the South Korea construction yard (Technip and Samsung also have the contract to build the FLNG), along
with installation and hook up, will take about 6 months, with
commissioning in late 2015 before first production the following
year.
Production is estimated to comprise 3.6 million tonnes/year of
LNG, 1.3 million tpy of condensate, and 400,000 tpy of LPG.
Shell says the offshore project will have a low environmental
footprint on its location away from migration paths for whales
and turtles that seasonally pass up and down the Western Australian coast.
The FLNG project will come on stream after the company’s
proposed onshore coal seam gas-LNG project at Gladstone, Queensland, in joint venture with Arrow Energy begins production in
2014.

and relocating nearly 1.5 million cu yards of sediment from the
seafloor.
The dredging involves four separate locations. The primary focus is a turning basin south of the BP PLC oil terminal on Terminal
Island (Pier T), which will be deepened to 76 ft, the same depth as
the main channel. The deeper inner basin means large tankers no
longer will need to unload part of their oil outside the breakwater
to safely reach berth.
The new depth also allows ships to turn safely in the inner
basin. Oil tankers must point toward the ocean when docked
so that they can quickly move away from the berth in an emergency. The BP terminal is one of the busiest oil terminals on the
West Coast.
Accumulated sediments at Catalina Ferry basin, near the mouth
of the Los Angeles River, also will be dredged to improve the safety of the ferries between Long Beach and Catalina Island.
The project also includes the removal of contaminated sediments from the West basin, left over from past US Navy operations.
The dredge materials will be used to fill about 12 acres at the
northern half of ITS Terminal in Pier G. The newly filled area will
be incorporated into the terminal in early 2013 and help expand
the use of on-dock rail.
The dredging, scheduled to begin in March 2010, is partially

Human impact statements

________________

Nick Snow’s Watching Government
column entitled “Delivering ‘human
impact statements’” hit a key issue
that has been missing in policymaking in general and certainly in energy
policy ever since We the People created
government to make policy for us (OGJ,
Sept. 28, 2009, p. 28). Policy at best pays
lip service to the human element by
suggesting that it will create jobs, but it
seldom tells us how, or at what economic costs, or if other jobs will be lost
(a component of economic cost).
Before we throw too much criticism at the administration, we should
commend the fact that energy and the
environment are being treated together.
Indeed, both are interlocked, and it is
about time that government recognized
this fact.
Snow’s column points out how
critical it is to all policy, and especially
the oil and gas industry, to bring the
economy formally into the process.
The concept of a true economic
impact statement that, by definition,
must include the human impact component, has a much longer-term time
horizon than what a politician sees.
Indeed, economic costs are long-term,
whereas political capital must be spent
quickly while the “mandate” of election
is still hot. Therefore, it should be of
little surprise that such mundane issues
as those affecting the Harrisons—the
couple described in the column whose
business was hurt by lease cancellations
in Utah—would be shunted aside.
Similarly, a rush to get things done
is why even the energy-environmental
policy under consideration shows, at
best, benign neglect of the 80% of our
energy mix that will be around for a
long time as policy hopes that we transition to the brave new world of clean and
secure energy.
Of course such neglect could be justified as the 80% is assumed to be able
to survive on its own. However, as the
Harrisons found out, the devil is in the
details and the consequences of a rush
to make policy while ignoring economic
and human impacts.
This column should be required
reading for anyone inside the Washington, DC, beltway. Who knows? Some of
them might even pay attention.

eras that enable the doctor to see inside
the patient’s ear, nose, and throat, and
listen to the patient’s heart and lungs.
The doctor also can view the skin via
instruments providing lighting and
magnification.
“Any rig with internet capability can
have attention from board-certified
physicians through telemedicine,” said
Shannon Caldwell, NuPhysicia’s executive director of offshore and remote
services. Patients are evacuated only if
medically necessary.
Formerly, Caldwell was with Noble
Drilling where he served as the corpo-

and an estimated savings of $213,000,
Caldwell said.
Evacuations were prevented because
the doctor and patient agreed upon a
method of care that could be provided
onboard the Offshore Courageous.

Pilot results

NuPhysicia provided OGJ with the
statistic results of its 6-month Offshore
Courageous pilot during which 100
visits were made to the clinic. Patients’
confidential information was protected.
The patients’ average age was 37. Upper respiratory infections accounted for
37% of the cases seen and were by far
the most common reason for a visit to
the clinic onboard the Offshore Courageous, Caldwell said.
The most common drugs prescribed
were benadryl or levaquin, each of
them accounting for 12% of the total
patient visits. Ibuprofen was prescribed
for 9% of the patients.
During January through March,
physician-led health risk assessments
were offered to the Offshore Courageous crew at no charge. Interest was
moderate with 27 individuals completing a health questionnaire, getting lab
results, and talking with a physician.
Many of the patients were medically
obese or overweight, Caldwell said.
Blood pressure measurement showed
about one third of the patients had
hypertension. As the average age of the
oil employee increases, more workers
have long-term medical problems such
as hypertension and diabetes.
Consequently, companies are more

but only 4 evacuations resulted, marksaid they were satisfied with the care
ing an 85% reduction in evacuations
and believed the video services improved the visit. ✦

Technology continues to drive innovations in telemedicine—and consequently lower costs—for oil companies
and drilling contractors responsible
for providing medical care to offshore
crews.
InPlace Medical Solutions enables
offshore workers experiencing illness
or injury to visit directly with physicians through real-time, two-way
videoconferencing services. InPlace
Medical Solution is a subsidiary of NuPhysicia LLC of Houston.
The idea is to reduce the number
of unnecessary helicopter evacuations,
which can be expensive. Fewer medical
evacuations also increase productivity.

Typically, drilling rigs and platforms
provide paramedics who consult with
doctors via telephone. InPlace provides
a video scope and a digital stethoscope
for a medic to use on a patient while
a doctor electronically monitors the
examination.

Mitigating climate change
The International Energy Agency has performed
a service with its detailed comparison of a businessas-usual energy projection with one that assumes a
global effort to mitigate climate change. The comparison is part of the agency’s World Energy Outlook to
be published next month. IEA released the section on
climate change early as an excerpt entitled “How the
energy sector can deliver on a climate agreement in
Copenhagen,” where international leaders will meet
in December.
Some of IEA’s analysis is questionable. And the
agency makes no pretense of neutrality on core
political questions. But its report is rigorous and illuminating. It deserves attention.

tion scenario would increase cumulative energyrelated investment during 2010-30 by $10.5 trillion.
Of that, $4.7 trillion would be for transport, $2.5
trillion for buildings, $1.7 trillion for electric power,
and $1.1 trillion for industry, mainly for processing
efficiencies and electric motors.
Of course, $10.5 trillion is a lot of money. If the
investment occurred in equivalent annual amounts,
however, each chunk would represent only 0.8% of
global gross domestic product in 2007. That might
seem like a minor diversion of capital. In fact, however, the capital shift would have economic consequences.

inspectors conduct field inspections of
offshore drilling rigs and production
platforms 7 days a week in the Gulf of
Mexico, off California, and off Alaska.
The Gulf of Mexico MMS region is
responsible for the most inspections.
In the gulf, 55 inspectors go offshore
every day using 14 leased helicopters.

Senior Staff Writer

Act charges the MMS with the responsibility of ensuring all oil and gas companies conduct offshore operations in a
safe and pollution-free manner.
One of the first things an inspector notices is the housekeeping, Mike
Saucier, MMS regional supervisor of
field operations for the Gulf of Mexico,
told OGJ in a telephone interview from

SPECIAL

Offshore Rig Inspections

his New Orleans office.
“It’s amazing, but housekeeping is a
key indicator,” Saucier said. “If everything is neat and orderly, then the rest
of the inspection usually goes really
well.”
Inspectors report that another key
indicator is the level of supervision that
20

oil companies provide their employees.
Top performing companies tend to
provide a lot of personnel oversight and
training, he said.
Saucier notes that the hurricanes of
past years did not make any difference
in MMS inspection procedures.
“As we see different trends that occur in the gulf, maybe due to pollution
issues, maybe due to safety issues, the
regulations can be revised,” Saucier
said. “As far as issues that would require regulatory revision, we don’t see
anything at this point.”

Crane inspections
Recently, a special MMS task force
conducted numerous inspections of offshore cranes because of an increasing
number of lifting incidents involving
primarily cargo but also some personnel lifting accidents.
“It looked like the incident of crane
accidents were up so we did a blitz
inspection, and the results came out
pretty favorable. I don’t see that we are
going to revise any regulations,” Saucier
said. “Of course, we are
going to keep looking at
the cranes as we always
do.” Crane inspections
are part of the annual
inspection process.
MMS statistics show
a total of 2,724 safety
incidents reported during
2005-08 on the OCS, of
which 506 incidents involved lifting operations.
These statistics were outlined in Houston during
an Offshore Safe Lifting
Conference sponsored by
the American Petroleum
Institute in June (OGJ,
Aug. 10, 2009, p. 33).
Joe Levine, senior engineer with the
MMS office in Herndon, Va., reviewed
statistics based upon reports that industry makes to MMS. Out of 506 liftingrelated accidents, 351 happened during
production operations and 155 happened during drilling operations.

During 2005-08, four fatalities resulted from lifting operations of which
two involved cranes and two involved
other lifting devices such as hoists, tuggers, winches, or come-a-longs.
Of the 506 lifting incidents, twothirds involved operations in less than
1,000 ft of water. Levine also noted that
one-third of the incidents happened on
2% of the infrastructure.

Timing of inspections
Under the OCS Lands Act authorization, MMS conducts at least one annual
announced inspection for each of the
3,700 production platforms in the gulf.
“At any point, we can drop by
unannounced,” Saucier said. “We can

be flying offshore, and if we think we
need to stop at a particular facility, we
can do that.”
Although the drilling rig number
varies daily, Saucier reported 81 drilling
rigs were in the gulf in late September.
Each drilling rig is inspected at least
once a month while it is drilling.
Drilling inspections are not announced in advance. A typical drilling
inspection takes about 3 hr.
Production inspections vary depending upon the type of platform.
Inspection of a single-well structure
can be completed in 30 min while a
major deepwater production platform

can take 3-5 days. Depending upon the
remoteness of the platform, an inspector may decide to stay on the platform
rather than fly back and forth daily.
“We rotate inspectors between the
drilling and production so that all inspectors can do any type of inspection,”
Saucier said.
The total number of MMS inspections in the gulf for 2008 was 24,895.
Saucier said this number is so large
because inspectors visiting a production
platform will conduct several categories
of inspections.
Among the major categories of
inspections done last year, Saucier
reported 665 drilling inspections, 3,458
production inspections, 342 workover

and completion inspections, 4,468
pipeline inspections, and 6,941 royalty
meter inspections.
MMS also inspects stockpiles of industry’s equipment to contain and clean
oil spills.
“Industry is doing a good job on
maintaining the oil spill response
equipment,” Saucier said, adding MMS
inspects skimming equipment and
booms annually.
Operators must keep available all
equipment listed in their oil spill response plan. They must keep the equipment operational ready and also keep
records of any equipment maintenance.
“This equipment is located at
various locations across the gulf from
Panama City, Fla., all the way to Corpus
Christi, Tex.,” Saucier said. “From our
inspection program and monitoring,
we are very confident that the equipment is there ready to be used when
needed.”
Before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist
attacks on the US, the US Coast Guard
was responsible for platform and rig
inspections involving safety equipment for personnel such as life jackets, life rings, life floats, and escape
capsules.
Since the USCG has become more
involved in homeland security, MMS
has taken over inspections on bottomsupported fixed production platforms.
If MMS inspectors see any issue with
personnel safety equipment, then they
report it to the USCG.
“We are out there anyway doing
our annual inspections,” Saucier said.
“It adds a little more time, but we go
ahead and do those inspections for
Coast Guard.”

T E R E S T
“The operator is working with the
drilling rig contractor, who is there
also, so MMS really talks to both parties.”
In about February 2010, MMS plans
to schedule individual annual performance reviews with some of the 120
operators in the gulf. Generally, MMS
meets with operators that are performing below the industry average and a
few operators performing above the
industry average.
“We’ll go over their statistics for
2009,” Saucier said. “We meet with the
ones who could improve, and we meet
with the ones doing very well. It helps
us determine what is working and what
is not.”
In addition to the annual review,
MMS meets with operators throughout
the year and on a weekly basis. MMS
might initiate such a meeting if an operator is having trouble with something
related to inspections.
Operators also can initiate a meeting
with the MMS if for example they want
to discuss compliance or new technology that they would like to use, he said.

Inspection process

For completion inspections, MMS
inspectors use a four-step process:
• Review operator records to verify
completion of all required operatorperformed inspections, tests, and
training since the last complete MMS
inspection.
• Visually inspect all safety and
pollution-prevention devices.
• Test or demonstrate the operation
of critical safety and pollution-prevention devices to ensure proper installation and operation as well as to witness
critical pressure and operational tests.

Each year, MMS presents the Safety
Award for Excellence (SAFE) Program
22

to recognize companies going above
and beyond inspection requirements on
both district and national levels.
The 2009 National SAFE Award
went to Devon Energy Production Co.,
primarily in recognition of what one
regulator called an “almost unprecedented” period without a lost-time
accident.
Devon has gone 5 years without an
accident that caused an employee to
lose work time. In addition, Devon had
good drilling performance with no
incidents of noncompliance out of 13
wells drilled.
Bud Danenberger, who heads the
MMS Office of Regulatory Programs,
said Devon had the best operator safety
index number.
The safety index is a formula that
measures compliance on numerous
aspects of offshore drilling rig and production platform operations. The index
measures accidents and inspection violations by their severity. In 2008, MMS
inspected 1,012 safety components on
98 Devon complexes in the gulf.
Tony Vaughn, senior vice-president
for Devon’s Offshore Division, said the
accident-free record demonstrates the
company’s commitment to safety.
“More important than the recognition itself, however, are the daily
actions that led to this recognition,”
Vaughn said of the SAFE award. “Day
in and day out, our employees and our
contractors demonstrate their commitment not only to safety, but to regulatory compliance and environmental
protection.”
ExxonMobil Corp.’s Hoover-Diana
platform received the 2008 Lake
Jackson District SAFE in the high-production category and also was named
a national finalist for the 2009 SAFE
award in OCS high-activity category.
Gary Walz, ExxonMobil US production operations manager for the gulf,
said operating safely—in an environmentally sound manner and in strict
compliance with regulatory requirements—is a business fundamental.

Recommendations offered for withdrawn Utah leases
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The US Bureau of Land Management
should lead development of a comprehensive interagency strategy to address
energy leasing, development, and
related air quality concerns for other
Western states, an interdisciplinary
team which reviewed 77 withdrawn
Utah leases said in a special report.
It also recommended increased
coordination and collaboration on oil
and gas leasing and development at the
federal and state levels, studying the use
of interdisciplinary field reviews for
all proposed lease sales, and improving
interdisciplinary participation in identifying parcels to be offered.
“The report made some very
important recommendations that are
the foundation for change on how we
develop our oil and gas resources on
public lands,” US Interior Secretary
Ken Salazar said as he and other DOI
officials released the report Oct. 8. “We
will make sure that our public lands are
being managed to protect our lands,
resources, and wildlife. We also will
support oil and gas development in the
right places.”
He ordered the leases, which Utah’s
BLM state office sold in a Dec. 19
auction, withdrawn on Feb. 4 after a
federal district court issued a temporary
restraining order on them on Jan. 16.
US Sen. Robert B. Bennett (R-Utah)
protested the withdrawal on Mar. 18 by
placing a hold on David Hayes’s nomination to be deputy Interior secretary.
Bennett removed the block on May

20 when Salazar agreed to have Hayes
review the withdrawn leases once he
was confirmed.
In that initial review on June 11,
Hayes found flaws leading up to the
December lease sale and recommended
that BLM establish an interdisciplinary
team to make site-specific decisions on
whether to reoffer the parcels under the
same conditions, reoffer them under
different terms, or defer them from
leasing. This team’s efforts led to the
report just released.

disciplinary team conducting the last
review was able to be more thorough
than the Utah BLM field office employees who prepared the resource management plans that formed the basis
of decisions to offer the tracts at the
December sale. “Often when BLM develops land use plans, we don’t have the
luxury of conducting an inventory of
resources. The team, having the chance
to do this, tried to consider what’s most
desirable for our public lands,” BLM
Deputy Director Mike Pool said.

Visited tracts
The team’s leader, San Juan National
Forest Supervisor Mark Stiles, said the
group visited each of the 77 tracts or
chose a good viewpoint from which
to observe them, studied documents
that Utah BLM employees used leading
up to the lease sale as well as protests
that were filed, and, during their visits,
“looked the other direction from where
the parcels were” at nearby national
parks.
“Clearly, some areas were ready to
go forward, including the dry desert
areas near Cisco, Utah, as well as some
red rock country near Moab,” he said.
“We also saw areas which should be
deferred so we can consider wildlife
and scenic concerns, as well as their
proximity to Canyonlands National
Park. In one case, a tract looked promising but the boundary of Arches National Park was visible on the horizon.
Some clearly needed to be removed,
such as one which was adjacent to
Canyonlands National Park or on a cliff
overlooking a popular Colorado River
recreation area.”
A primary conclusion, according
to Stiles, was that BLM needs to take a
much stronger role in deciding which
lease parcels should be offered, starting
with information that oil and gas producers provide in their expressions of
interest and continuing with a harder
look at leasing within the context of the
acreage’s other multiple uses.
He said the report conceded that
reviews as thorough as the one conducted for this study aren’t always
possible, but added that they should be
more thorough, possibly by offering
fewer parcels so more field work can
be done. It also recommends that BLM,
the National Parks Service, Utah’s state
government, and others should work
on shared landscape plans for areas
near Arches and Canyonlands National
Parks, he said. “It should recognize that
the nearly 3 million visitors annually
to the Moab area are there not just for
the national parks, but also for the BLM
experience,” Stiles said.
“The report demonstrates there was
24

T E R E S T
a headlong rush for leasing in the prior
administration, and it took short cuts
that led to areas being leases which
should not have been,” said Salazar. “It
demonstrates that when we are allowing American’s ownership of these
lands to be leased out for oil and gas
development, we need to do it right.
I believe it was not done right in the
past. The controversy which arose
around these 77 leases will give us a
laboratory for learning.”

GOP reactions
Two Republican members of Utah’s
congressional delegation were dismayed. “This report proves what I’ve
been saying all along: that the Utah
BLM office followed the proper procedures for reviewing the proposed lease
parcels that were sold last year,” Utah
Sen. Bennett said on Oct. 8. “This report illustrates that rules only matter to
this administration when they produce
certain results. They’ve substituted the
rule of executive whim for the rule
of law, creating another huge vacuum
of uncertainty for future BLM leasing
decisions.”
“While I respect the authors of this
report, their findings are insulting,”
added US Rep. Rob Bishop, who chairs
the congressional Western Caucus. “If
the policy of the Obama administration is to not develop America’s energy
resources, just come out and say it. Be
honest. Be transparent. The one thing I
ask is please don’t hide behind misleading statements and arguments about a
‘flawed process’ or ‘a rush to judgment’
by BLM or state officials in Utah.
“I fail to see how a 9-day, on-theground review by a team of outsiders is
better than the 7-year process of public
hearings and real input that produced
the comprehensive plan by professional
BLM and state employees in Utah,” he
added.
Rep. Doc Hastings (R-Wash.), the
House Natural Resources Committee’s
ranking minority member, also did not
agree with the findings. “With unemployment near 10%, it’s astounding that

the Obama administration is once again
blocking American energy production and the creation of high-wage
jobs. After withdrawing 77 parcels of
land from oil and gas production in
February, the administration is now
only allowing 22% of these areas to be
developed. The vast majority of land
remains locked up, even though it has
already been through an extensive
7-year environmental review process.”
Referring to Salazar’s observation
that the approach taken in the latest report constitutes “a new day…a
new beginning on how we deal with
our resources,” Hastings said, “If this
announcement is the administration’s
definition of a ‘new day,’ the future of
American energy does not look bright.
This decision reflects the administration’s clear lack of commitment to job
creation and all-of-the-above energy
development.”

Industry responses
Oil and gas groups generally criticized Salazar’s decision to follow the
report’s recommendations to defer
re-offering 52 of the withdrawn leases
and permanently remove 8 more from
consideration.
“Today’s announcement that Secretary Salazar is removing 60 federal
leases from development is just another
in a series of actions this administration has taken to delay or thwart oil
and gas exploration in areas where its
development has been designated and
where lease sales have been carefully
planned,” American Petroleum Institute
Pres. Jack N. Gerard said.
“This troubling trend means less
revenue to federal, state, and local
governments at a time when our nation is running a record deficit. It also
means fewer jobs at a time our nation
is headed toward 10% unemployment,
and it means less domestic energy
available when our economy recovers
and demand rebounds,” he continued.
DOI chose redundant analysis over
development despite 7 years of environmental analysis leading up to last
December’s lease sale, the Independent

T

Commission agreed with the US
Department of Energy’s Fossil Fuels
Office on Oct. 2 to collaborate on
natural gas supply and delivery and
climate-change mitigation issues.
At its 2009 annual meeting Oct.
4-5 in Biloxi, Miss., IOGCC adopted
two new resolutions related to that
agreement. Resolution 106 supports
continued environmentally responsible domestic shale gas development.
Resolution 107 supports state regulation of all forms of carbon dioxide
geological storage.
Both resolutions reiterate a point
IOGCC and its members have made
for months: State regulators are more
qualified than their federal counterparts to develop and enforce rules for
these emerging technologies.
It may be particularly true of
shale gas. The resolution notes that

API: US drilling up, but
still below year ago
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
US oil and gas drilling activity rebounded somewhat from the previous
3-month period during 2009’s third
quarter but remained substantially
lower than the comparable 2008 period, the American Petroleum Institute
reported.
API said the estimated 8,856 wells
completed during the quarter ended
Sept. 30 were 10.2% more than the
second quarter’s total but 46% less than
the number for 2008’s third quarter.
Activity remains at levels not seen since

“The trend of declining well
completions is a clear indication that
oil and gas companies, which are facing declining earnings and threats of
increased taxes, continued to carefully monitor their expenditures,” said
Hazem Arafa, director of API’s statistics
department.
The report said the estimated number of US exploration wells dropped
59% year-to-year to 327, while the
number of development wells fell 46%
to 7,430.
Natural gas remained the primary
target, with an estimated 4,097 wells
completed, 49% fewer than in 2008’s
third quarter and the decade’s most
severe quarterly decline for gas wells,
it indicated. Oil well completions also
were well below a year earlier, with the
3,600 estimated wells during the quarter down 44% year-to-year, API said.
It also reported total footage at an
estimated 50,716,000 ft during the
third quarter, 53% less than during the
comparable 2008 period.

Oil resurgence
The report reflected what one Wall
Street analyst has noticed. “There’s

been a significant resurgence in oil
well drilling, primarily in the Permian
basin and the Bakken, but gas drilling
has remained relatively flat,” said Mark
S. Urness, who follows drilling contractors and oilfield services for Calyon
Securities (USA) Inc. in New York.
“People have decided to wait and see
on gas,” he told OGJ in a telephone interview. “Most of the increased investments have been in oil, and it’s been
primarily the small, private operators.
Everyone’s waiting for 2010. Things are
looking better for then because many
bigger independent producers have
recapitalized, but right now activity is
dominated by smaller operators drilling
for oil. That makes sense since a $70/
bbl price looks pretty attractive.”
Frederick Lawrence, vice-president
of economics and international affairs
at the Independent Petroleum Association of America, said that the quarterto-quarter improvement was “a nice
little rebound, but any optimism has to
be cautious.”
Lawrence thought it was interesting
that unconventional sources such as
shales continue to increase their share

of total domestic gas production. “If
you look at the Baker Hughes rig count,
the horizontal rig count is down less
than the vertical rig count year-toyear. That emphasizes the role deep gas
formations such as the Haynesville and
other plays are playing as they become
more popular with producers,” he told
OGJ on Oct. 13.
Declining earnings and political issues still inordinately affect the upstream part of the oil and gas industry,
Lawrence said. “The combination of
much lower commodity prices and
reduced demand is occurring in tandem with political challenges that the
industry is facing during this recessionrebound. We still need to be fairly
modest in our near-term expectations
based on what economists are saying about the macroeconomy and the
return of demand,” he said.
“Longer-term horizons may be
probable at this point,” Lawrence said,
adding, “With these higher prices,
more gas is going into the market than
into storage, which is good during
these shoulder months since we’ll
probably have record inventories going
into this winter.” ✦

desire for driving that is fun, useful,

trend of cleaner driving is likely to continue, including in the United States,
with fuel efficiency standards getting
ever tighter.”
Shell will need to move beyond
simply serving its customers efficiently
in its new role, he said. “We’ll have to
build and cater for a growing community of energy customers who want
to feel good about the energy they
use,” said Voser. “We can offer them
fuel-saving transport fuels and lubricants, blend in sustainable biofuels,
capture [carbon dioxide] at the point of
production and store
it underground, as we
plan to do at Canada’s
oil sands.”
Shell also can help
its retail customers
reduce their motor fuel
consumption through
programs such as
Fuel-Save, which the
Shell chief executive
officer said has helped
motorists in different countries cut
their consumption 10-20% simply by
driving differently. “Our philosophy is
that customers who save fuel spend less
money. And happy customers tend to
be loyal customers,” he maintained.
Shell also is looking into energy
alternatives, Voser said. But he also
observed that it takes about 25 years for
each new source to simply gain 1% of
the total market. “Biofuels are reaching
that mark about now. Wind could do so
sometime in the next decade, 25 years
after the first big wind farms were built
here in the United States and in Denmark,” he said.
“Over a billion new vehicles are expected to come on to the world’s roads
between now and 2050, more than
doubling today’s total. So there will be
room and need for many different fuel
types, including conventional fuels,
biofuels and electricity,” Voser said.

‘At the nexus’
Addressing to his talk’s theme, “The
28

T E R E S T
Energy Company of the Future,” Voser
said companies like Shell “sit at the
nexus of one the world’s most difficult
and exciting challenges: building a new
energy system capable of meeting the
energy needs of future generations at
much reduced environmental cost.”
This comes amid the International
Energy Agency’s prediction that the
world will need to invest $36 trillion
in energy supplies through 2030, Voser
said. Using International Monetary
Fund calculations, that’s more than 30
times the amount which governments
have used so far to save their banks and
revive their economies, he said.

Voser said Shell sold these interests
because it found that others were better
at those businesses. “That doesn’t mean
we have given up on trying new things.
For instance, we’re a technology leader
in the biofuels space; we distribute
more biofuels than any other company,
and we work very hard to build sustainable supply chains,” he said.

Greater access

This also would not be the first time
the oil and gas industry has had to
respond to the prospect of tighter supplies, Voser said. “In the aftermath of
the oil crises of the 1970s, for instance,

urkmenistan’s President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow recently
met with officials to discuss his
country’s oil and gas industry. His
verdict? Turkmenistan looks to the
future with confidence and is already
preparing for a post-crisis surge in
global energy consumption.
“Even when there is crisis and
consumption of oil and gas is declining, one should not listen to those
who call for cuts in oil and gas
extraction,” he said, adding, “The
crisis is developing by its own rules,
and in the end, the recession will
be replaced by a rise, when huge
volumes of energy resources will be
needed. The winners will be those
countries which have been prepared
for this surge.”
The president also expressed
confidence that the strategic program
of development of the oil and gas
industry until 2030 would be implemented. Under this document, by
then, the country is expected to have
raised extraction of gas to 250 billion
cu m and oil to 100 million tonnes.

Officials fired
The president’s remarks came
amid a crisis in his country’s oil and
gas industry, too. He fired nearly all
the country’s top oil and gas officials
on Oct. 14, accusing them of waste
and inefficiency in developing the
nation’s oil and gas resources.
“As a result of the irresponsible
attitude toward their work shown by
some industry leaders, our government has not received the expected
result,” Berdymukhamedov told
government officials.
He reserved particularly sharp
criticism for the decline in oil pro30

duction and the failure to extend the
gas network to several residential
areas across the country.
“Instead of oil production going
up, it is in constant decline,” he said.
“Foreign companies that work in
our country under the same conditions, but that use modern technology and equipment, operate twice
as efficiently as (state oil company)
Turkmenneft.”

Possible fraud
Dismissed in the industry shakeup were Mineral Resources Minister
Annaguly Deryayev; head of state gas
company Turkmengaz, Dovlet Mommayev; and state oil company Chairman Orazdurdy Khadzhimuradov.
Other reports detail the events
leading up to their dismissal, saying
that various officials had “grossly
overestimated” the deposits of gas in
the South Yolatan field, which Turkmen authorities had called “a super
giant.”
After close scrutiny, however, it
surfaced that Turkmen auditors had
overstated the field’s gas deposits by
at least three times, either by mistake
or deliberately.
Such revelations could put a dent
in the world’s perception of Turkmenistan. It is very much to the
credit of the Turkmen president for
heading off what could have been an
even greater embarrassment—fraud
even—down the road.
The officials fired by Berdimuhamedow were expected to address
investors at an oil and gas conference
in the Turkmen capital, Ashgabat,
next month.

achieve the initially targeted results.
In the process, Pemex has awarded
contracts valued at several billions
of dollars for work at Chicontepec
to Schlumberger Ltd., Weatherford
International Ltd., Halliburton Co., and
a unit of Mexican billionaire Carlos
Slim’s industrial and retail conglomerate Grupo Carso SAB.
However, Mexico’s hopes for Chicontepec have not yet been borne out as
production stood at just 31,000 b/d in
August, with reports saying that output
there will likely end the year far below
the early expectations of 70,000 b/d.
Chicontepec, which covers an area
of 3,785 sq km in Veracruz and Puebla
states, has total reserves estimated at 18
billion boe and embodies the hopes of
the nation for improved output.
Pemex’s overall crude production
has fallen to less than 2.6 million b/d
from a record 3.4 million b/d in 2004,
largely due to the decline at Cantarell
field.
Herrera, in charge of planning and
technical development at the energy
ministry, said the government sees the
decline in output at Cantarell stabilizing, although it will never regain its
peak levels of the past. ✦

Italian company is working on details
of the facility, which will be open to

Southern Sudan’s state-owned
Nilepet Corp. is to form a joint venture
with the winner of the bid. The government plans another refinery for the
Dar Blend oil fields in the Upper Nile
region, Luk said.
The energy minister’s statements
coincided with reports the northern
Sudanese government offered to help
Uganda as it begins oil production
in the Albertine rift stretching from
Southern Sudan through the Lake Albert Valley to southwest Uganda.
“The Sudanese government is ready
to cooperate with Uganda in developing its oil sector, including establishing
a refinery,” said Ali Hussein Award,
Sudan’s ambassador to Uganda. He said
Khartoum also is ready to resolve outstanding border disputes with Uganda.
Meanwhile, fresh controversy over
oil-revenue sharing between the northern and southern Sudanese governments erupted with publication of a
report by Global Witness, an international nongovernmental organization,
that shows a discrepancy between

T E R E S T
figures of the northern Sudanese government and those of Chinese National
Petroleum Corp., operator.
According to the Global Witness
study, the Khartoum-based northern
government underreported production in certain block by as much as one
quarter less than the amounts given in
annual reports of CNPC, which operates the blocks.
According to the report, the southern government received $2.9 billion
in oil revenues in 2009. The alleged
discrepancies are of the order of 9-26%,
so any money owed to the southern
government by the Khartoum government could be large.
Key findings by Global Witness
include:
• The volume of oil the Khartoum
government reported produced in
Blocks 1, 2, and 4 in 2007 was 9% less
than stated in CNPC’s annual report.
• The volume Khartoum reported
produced in Blocks 3 and 7 in 2007
was 14% less than CNPC listed.
• The volume Khartoum and other
sources reported produced in Blocks 1,
2, 4, and 6 in 2005 was 26% less than
CNPC’s figures.
• Khartoum’s and CNPC’s numbers

were about the same only for the one
oil block located entirely in the north
and not subject to revenue-sharing.
• Oil prices published by the finance
ministry in Khartoum and those published in the oil industry press for sales
in the same months do not match.
“The problem is that the southern
government cannot verify that the oil
figures published by the Khartoum
government are correct,” said the
report titled “Fuelling Mistrust: The
need for transparency in Sudan’s oil
industry.”
In 2005, a peace agreement ended
Africa’s longest-running civil war—the
22-year conflict between north and
south Sudan. Under the agreement,
revenues from southern oil wells are
to be shared between the northern and
southern governments.
Due to the current discrepancy over
oil accounting, however, Global Witness said “a return to conflict looks all
too likely” as armies are already massing on along the border.
During the civil war, 1.5 million
people were killed and four out of every five people in the south had to flee
their homes at some point, according to
Global Witness. ✦

Iraqi minister sees ‘big leap’ coming in oil production
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Following agreement on two new
oil service contracts, Iraq’s oil minister
said he expects his country to increase
its oil production to 10-12 million b/d
over the next 6 years from the current
2.5 million b/d.
“What we expect from the first bid
round and what we hope for from the
second round is that Iraqi production
will be between 10 to 12 million b/d,
and this will make Iraq equal to the
world’s biggest oil producers,” said
Hussein al-Shahristani, referring to
one auction in June and another due in
early December.

Al-Shahristani’s remarks, which
made no reference to the need to adjust
production quotas set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
came as international oil companies
agreed to Iraq’s financial conditions
for investment in two major oil fields,
Zubair and West Qurna 1, in southern
Iraq.
The minister said a consortium led
by Italy’s Eni SPA had agreed to Baghdad’s offer of $2/bbl for each extra
barrel of oil it extracts on top of the
current production of 227,000 b/d at
the 4.1 billion bbl Zubair field.
Al-Shahristani said he wanted oil
production at the field to increase by
1.125 million b/d within 6 years’ time.

Meanwhile, the minister said that
two competing consortia—one led by
ExxonMobil Corp. and the other by
OAO Lukoil—had submitted bids that
met Iraq’s conditions for the 8.6 billion
bbl West Qurna 1 field.
“After a major effort from the oil
ministry, our price was accepted, which
is $1.90 per additional barrel,” said
al-Shahristani, adding that ExxonMobil
proposed an additional 2.1 million b/d,
while Lukoil offered 1.5 million b/d for
the field, which now produces 279,000
b/d.
Al-Shahristani said that within 2
weeks the agreement would be completed with the Eni-led consortium,

The oil minister said it would also
take two weeks to decide between
the offers of the ExxonMobil-Lukoil
consortia. ExxonMobil’s consortium
includes Royal Dutch Shell PLC, while
Lukoil is in partnership with ConocoPhillips.
The two new agreements have
improved the outlook for Iraq’s oil and
gas industry following the June auction
when eight fields were offered to IOCs
but only one of them, the 17.8 billion
bbl Rumaila field, was awarded.
That field went to a consortium
comprised of BP PLC and CNPC which
bid $2/bbl produced to develop the Rumaila field with a production target of

T E R E S T
2.85 million b/d, up from the current 1
million b/d.
The price demanded by all of the
other IOCs in the June auction was
at least twice as high—and in a few
instances, almost 10 times higher—
than what the oil ministry was willing
to pay.
Combined with the BP-CNPC investment in Rumaila, al-Shahristani said
the two new agreements mean that
IOCs will invest $100 billion into his
country’s oil industry, with production
set to increase by at least 6 billion b/d.
The minister did not detail the efforts that would be required to develop
his country’s industry so quickly, saying
only that, “We do believe that it is a big
leap in developing Iraqi oil fields.” ✦

Union claims IOC lobbyists
pressuring Brazil legislators
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Brazil’s largest union of oil workers, the Federacao Unica dos Petroleiros (FUP), claimed international oil
companies are pressuring legislators to
amend a bill that would extend special
benefits to the country’s state-run Petroleo Brazileiro SA (Petrobras).
“There’s a very strong presence
of [IOC] lobbyists in the Chamber of
Deputies (lower house), represented by
the Brazilian Petroleum Institute,” said
FUP general coordinator Joao Antonio
de Moraes.
During an Oct. 8 hearing in the
Brazilian Senate, de Moraes said a provision in a bill to ensure Petrobras has
operatorship and a stake in each block
of the presalt region is being “heavily
attacked” by private oil companies.
De Moraes told legislators allowing
IOCs to operate presalt projects would
result in a loss of “exclusivity and
control over the technology” needed

32

to exploit the hard-to-reach deepwater
deposits.
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula
da Silva’s government recently submitted a legislative proposal to change
the current concession regime to a
production-sharing system that would
guarantee Petrobras as sole operator
of all presalt deposits and provide it a
minimum 30% stake.
Under the proposed legislation,
other companies could partner with
Petrobras and hold majority stakes in
the joint ventures. But Petrobras, as
operator, would control key decisions
regarding development (OGJ, Sept. 14,
2009, p. 27).
In its monthly report, the International Energy Agency noted discussion of the proposed new regulations
continue in Brazil’s legislature, and
future bidding rounds depend on their
approval.
Brazil’s subsalt region is the most attractive new oil frontier in recent years
among producers outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,

IEA’s report said.
“New discoveries within Brazil’s
much-feted presalt (subsalt) deepwater offshore basin have come along
recently with such regularity as to almost go unremarked,” the agency said.
However, IEA revised down its forecasts
for total Brazilian supply this year by
25,000 b/d to 2.51 million b/d, and in
2010 by 45,000 b/d to 2.75 million b/d.
Meanwhile, Brazilian construction
conglomerate Odebrecht Group secured
a $1.5 billion loan for its two deepwater
drilling vessels, Norbes VIII and Norbes
IX. Odebrecht said it will invest a total
$1.7 billion in the two vessels, which
have 10-year drilling contracts with
Petrobras and can drill in 3,000 m of
water in the presalt regions.
In other news, Keppel Corp.’s offshore and marine unit Keppel FELS and
its joint venture partner J. Ray McDermott signed a letter of intent with
Petrobras and Chevron Corp. for an
oil platform in Brazil. Keppel said the
contract is expected to be signed “at a
later date.”
Keppel FELS and J. Ray McDermott
formed the FloaTEC JV to bid for Petrobras’s P-61 oil platform contract with
an estimated value of $1.07 billion. ✦

Deepwater play

Papua New Guinea has a well established oil and gas production region in
the Highlands area of the country.
The commercial fields are largely
restricted to a narrow fairway of Jurassic age clastic reservoirs in the Papuan
basin. The deposits are mainly gas-condensate with some oil-only fields, and
current known gas and liquids in place
total 30.5 tcf and 1.247 billion bbl.
A second play, Miocene reefs in
the western Papuan basin, is mostly
biogenic gas, with limited geographic
distribution; again, a narrow ribbon on
a paleo-shelf break.
There is always a need to discover
a new play to increase the prospectivity and hydrocarbon potential. Blue

Coral Sea development
The basin has had an interesting
tectonic development (Fig. 2): Paleozoic
(Permian and older) Gondwana sag
basin deposition followed by TriassicJurassic-Cretaceous Gondwana synrift
and postrift, where the rift was to the
north. This makes the basin the last
easterly Tethyan basin, and it is as yet
undrilled.
This is followed by a second rift
phase in the south, the Coral Sea
opening, in the Late Cretaceous Early
Tertiary. There was associated doming
to the south as well as dislocation of
the plate to form marginal plateaus that
moved to the north, separated from the
Australian Plate by a transfer fault.
There was continued spreading in
the northern Melanesian island arc,
which ceased in the Eocene and reversed in the Oligocene. There was collision between the arc and the Papuan
basin at this time, but much later with
the new basin, probably in the Miocene. Fold and thrusting occurred in
the Pliocene, and then later inversion.
The potential petroleum systems with
this structural development are shown
in Fig. 2, with the interaction of sea
level changes and tectonic events.
The region has been deemed to
have little potential due to high risk in
source, reservoir, and charge.
• Reservoir risk—due to restricted
distribution of Toro sandstone reservoir
or equivalent.
• Charge risk—generation timing
is critical to migration pathways and

capture in developing anticlinal traps.
• Source risk—extent of downcutting of the Coral Sea unconformity into
the Mesozoic Petroleum System, possibly removing the source rocks.
Time space plots show three major tectonic events characterized by
structural rotation and erosion (Fig. 2).
The Gondwana tectonics is a rift system
with northward dipping normal faults
and rift axis to the north. The Coral Sea
unconformity is also associated with a
seafloor spreading center, normal faults
dipping to the south, and also a major
transfer fault between the stable Australian Plate and the Marginal plateaus.
The collision event has created
uplift and later downloading. So when
considering the seismic interpretation
of the basin, there is a need to look for
three unconformities that are in effect
the boundaries of three supersequences
(megasequences, to quote current
literature). There are numerous eustatic
events, but with no rotation. So in fact
these eustatic-derived unconformities
will be parallel unconformities and in
fact difficult to see on seismic.

Seismic stratigraphy
Considering the regional gross
section (Fig. 3) and zoomed region in
Figure 3 and applying some seismic
stratigraphy, it is possible to start to
unravel the basin.
Seismic stratigraphic analysis shows
starting from the bottom (oldest) and
working up the section: Marginal
plateaus are always relatively deep, so

there is a need for a major event to
lift, rotate, and subaerially erode the
plateau.
The peripheral bulge is interpreted
as the Coral Sea hinge zone where there
is a transition between southerly dipping faults (Coral Sea opening related)
to northerly dipping faults (Gondwana
breakup related), and older sediments
to the north have not been eroded out.
This is the central realization of
the new play of a Tethyan petroleum
system. The Gondwana breakup unconformity is characterized by angularity,
rotation, and terrestrial section grading
to deep marine. There is a thinning
wedge to the south as expected as well
as no thickening on immediate post
sediments, hence no evidence of loading. The Jurassic coal event is characterized as cyclic, low frequency, bifurcation events, local unconformities, high
amplitude, and evident even after 3 sec
two-way time.
The signal strength is a key in assigning this as a coal event. There are
few reflectors with sufficient impedance contrast to give such strong and
coherent reflection packages. Salt
and intrusives can be but are not the
character seen on the section. The deep
coal also is consistent with a terrestriallacustrine-shallow marine-deep marine
transition, the rift-drift scenario of
basin development. The shallow sediments, perhaps deep marine carbonates, are seismically “transparent.”

formity and not to volume creation due
to downloading. The collision unconformity is evident and associated with
the first thickening package, characterized as slope erosion and deposition
with onlap with crustal thickening and
associated downloading the implied
tectonic regime.
The erosion on Pliocene implies the
region was shallow-water at collision time, uplift then deepening with
loading. The thrust faulting is evident
as well as a detachment fault within a
chaotic zone of poor coherency.
The fact that there is Eocene at coast
implies massive nearshore anticline as
the breakup unconformity is lifting at
the slope. Or are there imbrications?
More seismic is required inshore to
answer this.
Seaward we note about 1.5 sec of
sediment (precollision event), and to
the north this increases to 3 sec, so
this implies repeat section based on the
Jurassic coal pick. Evidence for the detachment is that Miocene erosion to the

left but not so much to the right of the
detachment fault as well as a repeat section of Jurassic coals. Flat lying coastal
zone could indicate anticlinal ramp
thickening. In any case there are one,
maybe two thrust sheets, and there may
be additional plays within these sheets,
in addition to the basement level plays.

Papuan differences
So, interestingly we can extend to
petroleum system characteristics away
from the concerns and limitations of
the nearby Papuan basin.
With respect to the Jurassic coals,
it is postulated there are coal cycles,
so providing source, reservoir, and
seal. It is thought that structuring and
hydrocarbon generation and migration will be synchronous as there has
been shallow cool source rock until the
downloading has pushed the source
rock through the oil window. This
downloading just preludes the anticlinal structures.
The distance to Owen Stanley fault

is probably the edge of the continental
block—so there is 40 km of fetch and
migration is south into anticline. The
gross rock volumes and expulsion volumes have yet to be calculated, but they
should be significant.
The slope angle on the frontal thrust
is short and steep, then there is 40 km
of relatively flat seafloor and topography before mountain ranges are
developed. This leaves sufficient room
to develop a petroleum kitchen and
substantial fetch.
Also, this topographical flatness can
be used to imply a thrust ramp and
not imbrications of the thrust sheet.
Otherwise there would be significant
mountain building at the coast. There
would be mountain building at the
coast merging directly into the slope,
which there is not.
Crustal thickening supports overthrust model, as does to some extent
the geoid anomaly over Port Moresby
of 127 m, indicating an extra thick
or overelevated land mass. Onshore

ly ignored but still possible? A Miocene
reef play is probably associated with the
collision, but there is no seismic data
yet to support this.
What this means is that Blue Energy’s acreage position has a footprint
of over one third of a new basin. More
importantly the acreage covers the
entire prospective fairway in the new
basin. By analogy with the highlands
there will be a structural density of
over 40 anticlines in the fairway, per-

haps more.
This presents a
ground floor entry
into a new basin
with a very large
position and exceptional exploration potential and
opportunity. With
a coal source,
the system will
probably be gascondensate, but
a mature marine

cannot be ruled
out. ✦

Led by the Barnett (5 bcfed), Fayetteville (1.3 bcfed), and fast-rising
Haynesville (1.1 bcfed), shale reservoirs
currently contribute more than 8 bcfd
to North American gas supplies. That is
up from just 2 bcfd 5 years ago.
Development continues at a brisk
pace within the geologically favored
core areas of these proven shale plays,
while depressed gas prices, in part due
to the shale’s success, have drastically
slowed drilling in other domestic gas
basins.
A couple dozen other new, deep
shale plays are at various stages of appraisal (see table). Eastern shale plays
have the edge, being generally older,
thermally more mature and brittle, and
benefitting from stronger wellhead
prices (Fig. 1).
Western shales have suffered from
the decrease in gas prices and generally
lackluster tests but still have tremendous potential (Fig. 2).
Not all of these new shale plays will
succeed. Advanced Resources views
two plays to be potentially worthy: the
Eagle Ford shale in South Texas and
the Woodford-Cana shale in western
Oklahoma.

O D U C T I O N

Eagle Ford (Texas)
Extending eastward out of the
Maverick basin in a narrow belt across
South Texas (Fig. 3), the Cretaceous
Eagle Ford shale play emerged in 2008
on the heels of the Haynesville success,
which it resembles in certain respects.
The Eagle Ford underlies the Austin chalk and is a source rock for the
East Texas oil fields. Initial horizontal
drilling provides
encouragement
but the number
of wells drilled
is insufficient for
making a confident
prediction on the
long-term estimated ultimate recoveries (EURs) and
economics.
About 300-ft thick and 11,000-ft
deep, the Eagle Ford has a high 4% total
organic carbon (TOC) content and a
silty texture that is rich in brittle calcareous mineral components. As in the
Haynesville, gas-in-place concentrations
are high, in the range of 100-200 bcf/
sq mile.
The play also has elevated (300° F.)
temperatures. The 0.65 psi/ft reservoir
pressure gradient, however, is lower
than the 0.85 psi/ft gradient in the
Haynesville.
Petrohawk Energy Corp. discovered
the play by targeting the deeper, more
mature areas. Petrohawk has locked up
210,000 acres with low royalties, mainly in La Salle and McMullen counties
along the Edwards reef trend, in what
appears to be the emerging central core
of the play (Fig. 1).
Petrohawk’s initial 11 horizontal wells produced at an average 8.9
MMcfed for the initial 24-hr rate,
including significant condensate. With
a $120 million in capital expenditures
committed to the play in 2009, the
company has two rigs running and
plans to drill 29 operated wells.

Dominion Resources Inc. and Energen Corp. have drilled Conasauga test
wells but encountered drilling problems and low flow rates.
The Mississippian-age Chattanooga
and Floyd (or Neal) shales are stratigraphic equivalents with the Barnett
shale. Best developed in central Mississippi, companies have been disappointed with well tests in the Floyd
shale in part because the shale is 70%
clay-dominated, which inhibits effective fracturing.

Other Western US shales
Western shale plays, already contending with lower wellhead gas prices,
frequently are less thermally mature
and have a higher content of ductile
clays. Production rates have been lower
than in many Eastern shale plays, with
very limited commercial development.
The key to unlocking the Western
shales will be to target their more
mature and quartz-rich zones, coupled
with improvements in hydraulic fracturing techniques.
Hopes initially were high that the
Permian basin Barnett shale of West
Texas would match its Fort Worth basin
equivalent, but this has not occurred.
Initial flow rates generally have been
below 1 MMcfd, while wells there are
costly due to their greater depth, up to
18,000 ft.
The Bend shale of North Texas’s Palo
Duro basin was active several years ago
until well tests proved disappointing.
The Bend has good 2.5-4% TOC but is
only marginally mature with a 1% Ro.
The Mancos in the Uinta basin appears to be one of the better western
shale plays, with attractive TOC, depth,
and thermal maturity. Questar Corp.,
Gasco Energy Inc., and Bill Barrett
Corp. have had good results, achieving
EUR’s in the 1-5 bcf range.
The Manning Canyon shale in the
Uinta is 2,000 ft thick, 7,000-11,000
ft deep, with attractive 1-4% TOC and
a 1.2-1.5% Ro. A hard limestone that
may provide a frac barrier underlies it.
Companies testing the play included

Barrett, and ConocoPhillips.
The Pierre and Mancos shales in the
under-drilled Raton basin have fairly
shallow 4,000-6,000 ft depths. Pioneer’s early wells had EURs less than 1
Bcf, which is subeconomic at current
gas prices. El Paso Corp.’s Niobrara
shale wells in the Raton basin cost $2-3
million but have modest initial potentials (IPs) of 0.4-1.8 MMcfd.
The Gothic and Hovenweep shales
in the Paradox basin are not particularly deep (5,500-7,500 ft) but do have
brittle mineralogy with 50-85% quartzcarbonate. Bill Barrett reports spending $4 million for wells that initially
produce at about 3 MMcfd.
Questar drilled more than 20 wells
in the Baxter shale in the Vermillion
basin, Wyoming, but initial flow rates
were generally a modest 1 MMcfd.
Drilling is on hold.
The Lewis shale at 10,000-15,000 ft
depths of the Greater Green River basin
is much deeper than its San Juan basin
equivalent, has a more mature 1.1-2.0%
Ro, and appears to be an excellent target awaiting horizontal shale testing.

shales in California have rich 5-10%

TOC, are highly siliceous, and have vast
potential just beginning to be tested.
Most areas, however, are thermally immature and oil prone.

Global shale potential
Given the rapid and successful development of seven giant gas shale plays in
North America, with their diverse ages
and physical characteristics—yet all utilizing similar horizontal wells and large
multistage fracs—there appears no reason to doubt the success for developing
organic-rich shales in other regions.
Advanced Resources’ exploration
concept overseas is to follow known
shale source rocks into deeper regions
where they may have enhanced maturity, gas saturation, pressure gradients,
and mechanical brittleness.
Early-stage exploration is under way
in Australia, Poland, Sweden, and elsewhere, with little test data yet available.

Europe
Europe has appeal given the age, maturity, and stratigraphic data control of
the gas shale targets, not to mention the
strong gas markets.

Baltic basin, targeting a 1,500-ft thick
Silurian sequence that is silty, calcareous, and high in TOC (OGJ, Sept. 21,
2009, p. 52).
Nearby, BNK Petroleum Inc., also active in the Woodford shale, is evaluating 720,000 acres containing organicrich Silurian shale that is 500-2,500 ft
thick, 7,000-12,500 ft deep, and mature
(1.2-2.6% Ro), with moderate 25-63%

Eurenergy Resources Corp. and Toreador Resources Corp. are active in the
Paris basin.
Shell is testing the Cambrian-Ordovician Alum shale in southern Sweden,
which has a 70-200 ft thick oil shale
with TOC up to 20%, though relatively
immature.
Russia’s Dnieper-Donets basin contains Devonian and Carboniferous black
shales with a 3-13% TOC, and the Jurassic Bazhenov formation, the principal oil source rock in West Siberia, has
5-9% TOC and reaches a mature 1.3%

Gas shale drilling has lagged far
behind coalbed methane development
in Australia but the geologic potential is
vast. Santos Ltd., Beach Petroleum Ltd.,
and Drillsearch Energy Ltd. are evaluating gas shale targets adjacent to producing gas fields in the Cooper basin of
western New South Wales.
The thermally mature Cambrian and
Ordovician Arthur Creek shale underlies the more remote Southern Georgina basin in central Northern Territory
and western Queensland. The Horn
Valley siltstone in central Australia’s
Amadeus basin is an Ordovician source
rock that has fed conventional gas
fields. This unit is about 150 ft thick
and has a thermally mature 1-3% Ro.
Numerous other shales in Australia
await testing.

Other areas
Silurian black shales were sources
for Algeria’s oil fields in the GhadamesIllizi basins. Morocco’s Timahdit and
Tarfaya oil shales may have deeper gas
shale potential.
In South America, Cretaceous organic-rich shale source rocks are present
in both the Maracaibo and Middle
Magdalena basins of Colombia and
Venezuela. Correlative with the Haynesville shale (Turonian-Cenomanian),
this shale is 300 ft thick and has a TOC
>10% in places, though Ro appears to
be mostly less than 1%.
Clearly, gas shales have promise
outside North America, although it will
take extensive geologic work and more
drilling to locate the sweet spots.

tions ranging 0-43 mg/l. The sensors
were tested with three different types
of sample cells: a flow-through cuvette,
50-ml glass vials, and a 9.5-cm ID glass
cylinder with 6 mm WT (to simulate a
sight glass on a fuel-transfer pipe).
Each LED sensor exhibits different
dynamic range, linearity, and sensitivity, which can be changed by altering
the LED/detector angle. The sensors
can readily measure dye concentrations
several times lower and higher than the
EPA and IRS requirements (2.2 and 11.1
mg/l., respectively).

Regulations
IRS regulations require that taxexempt fuel contain a level of Solvent
Red 164 (SR164) dye that is spectrally
equivalent to >11.1 mg/l. of a highly
similar Solvent Red 26 dye (SR26) standard, which is available in pure form.
SR164 is used to dye fuel because it
less expensive than SR26 and has alkyl
hydrocarbon chains that improve fuel
solubility.
EPA regulations only require a dye
concentration that is one fifth as high
as the IRS levels. The higher dye concentration required by the IRS readily
enables detection of dyed fuel that may
have been diluted with undyed fuel.
Solvent Red dyes can be readily
measured in fuels with optical spectroscopy,1 in which the use of spectral
derivative processing removes the
broad absorption band in the 500-600
nm region exhibited by fuels, allowing accurate measurement of the more
narrow Solvent Red absorption bands
in that region.
The American Society for Testing
and Materials International has a published method that uses visible absorption spectroscopy to determine SR164
dye in diesel fuels.2 These methods
are highly quantitative and considered “gold-standard” measurement
techniques for the determination of
Solvent Red in fuel. They also, however,
require instrumentation that is not lowcost and significant involvement of an
operator for sample measurement and
data processing.

vial sample chamber with 2.5 cm ID
and 1.5 mm WT. These tests were performed with Solvent Red 26 in kerosine
and Solvent Red 164 in diesel for the
three sensors.
Final testing was performed by the
sensors being mounted on the outside of a glass cylinder with 9.5-cm
ID and 6-mm WT to simulate a large
fuel-transfer pipe (Fig. 2). The 6-mm
WT was used to simulate more closely
the thickness of a sight-glass on a
fuel-transfer line that could provide a
convenient location for mounting these
types of sensors.
Fig. 2 also shows a dip-probe sensor, which is not discussed any further

here, and no data are shown. Dyed diesel samples (300 ml) were introduced
into the sampling chamber, and data
from each of the three sensors were
collected sequentially to avoid interference among sensors. Kerosine standards
were not measured with this sampling
chamber. After measurement, samples
were removed with a large-volume
pipette, and the chamber rinsed with a
small amount of the next sample to reduce carryover. Samples were measured
in the order from lowest to highest
concentration.
The broad absorption band of the
Solvent Red dyes results in light attenuation in both red and blue spec-

tral regions with a smaller amount of
attenuation in the red region. For these
sensors, the amount of light detected is
inversely proportional to the dye concentration in the sample.
A summary of results appears presently.
Sensors are designated as 1A, 1B,
and 1C, according to Fig. 1. All data
have been converted from raw detector output voltage to absorbance units.
Absorbance was calculated with the
following relationship:
A = –log10(I/Io)
Where:

Results
Sensor designs 1A and 1C show
significant promise for use as fuel-dye
monitors at refineries and fuel terminals. Other sensor designs (1B) may
also have utility for fuel-dye monitoring. These sensors can readily measure
the IRS 11.1-mg/l. dye concentration
requirement; Sensors 1A and 1C can
discriminate concentrations several
times lower and higher, depending on
LED/detector angle.
The component costs for these
sensors range from $1-10, providing
an extremely cost-effective means of
monitoring fuel-dye concentration.
The LEDs have extraordinarily long

channels (for example, sensor design
1C or variants of it) should allow accurate measurement of fuel-dye concentrations over a range of conditions and
sample types by allowing compensation for color, density/refractive index

into the sample for Sensor 1A was likely
significantly affected by the thick glass

by the low absorbance values.
All sensors exhibited significantly
lower absorbance values relative to data
collected in the smaller sample vessels,
which is likely due to the reduction in

A common European
approach toward carbon
capture and sequestration and toward developing an integrated carbon
dioxide transportation
Pipelines
network will help address CO2 emissions.
Carbon dioxide transport infrastructure will be a key component of any
future carbon capture
and sequestration
plans. Pipelines are
the most economical
means of moving most
sequestered CO2, based
on location of the
supply sources (large
industrial compounds) and potential
injection sites (large depleted oil and
gas reservoirs, saline aquifers).
The pipeline industry is therefore preparing the first scenarios for
developing carbon dioxide pipeline
networks, while authorities and other
organizations examine creating a standardized framework for such networks:
DNV CO2PIPETRANS (OGJ, Sept. 14,
2009, p. 14) and the European Union
CCS Directive proposal discussed in this
article.

proposal for a directive on the geological storage of CO2. Although different
sections of previous EU legislation
already addressed some aspects of CCS,
this was the first initiative to integrate
in one document the principles of its
future development in the EU.
The proposal went through the
normal cycle of public and industry
consultation and was approved and
published in the Official Journal of
the European Union on Apr. 23, 2009,
under the title Directive 2009/31/EC
of the European Parliament and of the
Council on the geological storage of
carbon dioxide.1
The Directive also has European Economic Area relevance, meaning it can
be used by the countries that are not
members of the EU but are members of
the EEA: Norway, Switzerland, Iceland,
and Liechtenstein.
The EU Directive considers CCS a
bridging technology to reduce CO2
emissions. According to the directive,
and based on the EU’s target of 20%
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions
by 2020, 7 million tonnes of carbon
dioxide could be stored by 2020 and
up to 160 million tonnes by 2030. CCS
will be only one of the tools used in
reducing greenhouse gas emissions,

opment of the most economical CCS
technologies.
The directive asks member states to
create conditions for open and nondiscriminatory access to CO2 transport
networks and storage sites. It also requires countries to create all necessary
conditions for the cross-border transportation of CO2. EU legislation relative
to transporting waste materials is to be
amended to exclude CO2 transported
for the purpose of geological storage.
Issuing any CO2 storage permit will
require a description of the transportation method. Existing EU legislation on
permitting new large fossil-fuel power
plants will be amended to include the
economic feasibility of CO2 transportation from such a source to the potential
storage sites (sinks).

cess of the pipeline network, as well as
other factors having an effect such as
development of enhanced oil and gas
recovery—EOR, EGR—or the potential use of existing oil and gas pipeline
infrastructure for future CO2 transportation infrastructure.
The implementation of CCS projects
will be gradual, extending the development of a CO2 pipeline network across
several stages. Relatively short point-topoint pipelines will initially link demonstration and early stage CO2 sources
with the most promising storage sites
in their proximity. As CCS implementation advances, some regions or
countries are likely to develop hub-andspoke pipeline networks, optimizing
transportation between their domestic
CO2 sources and available domestic
sinks.

These include the development probalancing the storage deficit of some

regions with the excess storage capacity of other regions. Costs and problems will be more important during
the local point-to-point and regional
hub-and-spoke networks, while the
pan-European stage will definitely offer
cost benefits through network effects,
while at the same time requiring management of issues such as cross-border
pipelines.
Regionally focused studies have
assessed the potential contribution of
enhanced hydrocarbon recovery to the
development of a CO2 pipeline network
in Europe.2 All have concluded, contrary to the situation in regions actively
producing fossil fuels such as the US,
that EOR and EGR will play a limited
role in Europe. Most oil and gas fields
in the region will be depleted by the
time CCS industry growth allows captured CO2 to reach them.
Another factor is the potential use of
existing oil and gas transport infrastructure—pipelines, pumping and
compressor stations, offshore platforms,

etc.—for transporting captured CO2.
Although feasible in some regions, such
as sections of the North Sea, most of
any future CO2 pipeline network will
consist of new pipelines.
Timing the end of service of existing
pipelines to the arrival of captured CO2
will prove difficult. Important design
differences exist between gas and CO2
pipelines (pressure, corrosion protection, fracture arrestors, etc.). Infrastructure conversion investment will also
be needed for pipeline refurbishment,
pumping stations, platforms, etc.

Development scenarios
An impact assessment document
presented in January 2008 supported
the EU CCS directive. The document
assessed several possible European CCS
development scenarios for 2020, 2025,
and 20303 and their environmental,
social, and economic effects.
The document assessed the three
CCS elements—capture, transportation,
and storage—separately, concluding
that CO2 pipelines have similar risks to
those carrying natural gas and will thus
be similarly regulated. Amended Directive 85/337/EC therefore requires CO2
pipelines more than 40 km long with
an OD >800 mm to provide an envi-

ronmental impact assessment.
This article will focus on the two
CO2 pipeline network scenarios assessed
by that impact assessment. In the first
scenario (member states), each member
state of the EU will store, as much as
possible, CO2 within its borders, creating hub-and-spoke pipeline networks
with almost no cross-border interconnections. This scenario foresees just
560 km of CO2 pipelines in 2025 and
around 6,700 km in 2030, virtually all
onshore (Fig. 1).
Since about three quarters of the CO2
capture would happen in Germany, Poland, the UK, and Belgium, most pipelines would be built in those countries.

Costs
Developing a cost simulation for the
above scenarios requires understanding the main cost categories, as well as
the expected cost differences between
building new gas and new CO2 pipelines. CO2 pipeline infrastructure requires investment in two main categories: pipelines and other infrastructure
(pumping stations, offshore platforms,
etc.). The main pipeline infrastructure
cost categories are labor costs and pipe
and other material costs, followed by
land, ROW, and other costs (OGJ, Sept.
14, 2009, p. 60).
Some costs will be different for CO2
pipelines than for natural gas. Since
CO2 pipelines have a high-risk of aggressive internal corrosion from small
water or H2S volumes, material costs
will be higher. In most cases stainless
steel will be used instead of the cheaper
carbon steel, or a polyethylene liner
will protect the carbon steel unless a
corrosion inhibitor is added directly to
the CO2.
CO2 pipelines also need fracture
arrestors every 300-500 m to prevent
longitudinal ductile fractures caused by
the slow decompression of the carbon

The second scenario (pan-European)
can transport CO2 to storage areas in
other countries, using the assumption
that storage in depleted gas fields is
more secure than storage in saline aquifers. This scenario would create a truly

km of pipelines in 2020, 18,700 km in
2025, and 45,580 km in 2030.
More than 80% of the 2030 network
will be onshore pipelines (37,150 km),
with the balance lying offshore in the
North Sea, Baltic Sea, Irish Sea, and
Mediterranean Sea (Fig. 2 and table).
Almost 60% of the pipelines will
have an OD <610 mm, with the balance ≤900 mm. The EU gas transmission network measured about 110,000
km in 2001.

dioxide. To reduce transportation costs,
CO2 pipelines are also usually designed
at higher operating pressures than
gas pipelines, sometimes requiring a
thicker pipe wall.
CO2 pipelines need pumping stations instead of the compressor stations used for gas pipelines. Offshore
pipelines need either subsea manifolds
or standard platforms to receive the CO2
before pumping it to injection wellheads (1-10/subsea manifold, 10-20/
platform).
The pipeline cost estimate for
onshore CO2 pipelines uses a mix of
cost assumptions for both gas and CO2

pipelines drawn from the INGAA 2009
CO2 pipeline assessment4 and in the
ECA/Penspen/EIHP 2007 study.5 Cost
estimates for the pumping stations, etc.,
used cost assumptions similar to those
in the INGAA study.
Offshore pipelines cost estimates
used assumptions close to those used
in the NOGEPA 2009 study,2 while the
costs for the other transport infrastructure—platforms, pumping stations—
were estimated with the BERR 2008
study’s6 assumptions, particularly reuse
of some existing North Sea platforms
and limited use of CO2 for enhanced
hydrocarbon recovery.

New metering system for tight gas reservoirs
The CARBONTRACKER gas metering
system is a new development in reservoir
characterization for tight gas, underbalanced drilling operations.
The meter is designed specifically for
tight gas reservoirs and is accurate at flow
velocities as low as 1 fps. Installed in the
flare line between this firm’s MUD/GAS
SEPARATOR and the flare stack, the meter
measures gas flow velocity, temperature,
and pressure to determine actual and
standard volumetric flow, as well as mass
flow rates.
Rather than making decisions based
only on log data to predict production, operators can find the location of productive
gas zones while drilling underbalanced,
the company points out.
The meter can be used on any rig,
onshore or off. With no moving parts, it
tolerates dirty or wet conditions and creates no obstructions in the flare line. The
unit includes the flow cell that is installed
in the flare line, a flow computer, and a

housing to protect the electronic components.

12-v motor powers the compact,
self-contained

unit. That motor runs off a deep-cycle
battery, which in turn is recharged by
an adjustable solar panel. It takes only a
couple of hours to recharge the battery, the
company notes.
Depending on the characteristics of the
liquid, it is possible for the skimmer alone
to reduce oil content to less
than 5 ppm in water. The
unit is used as a pretreatment before disposal, as
well as in conjunction with
coalescing systems and
with systems where it prevents filters from blinding
prematurely.
The unit can be used in
tanks with depths as shallow as 1 ft or as deep as
100 ft.

Tradeoff on climate
bill might fracture
oil and gas industry
Compromise forming around climatechange legislation in the US Senate promises despair for the oil and gas industry.
Senate Democrats have signaled their
willingness to consider expansion of federal oil and gas leasing to secure support
for cap-and-trade legislation. Proposed
late last month by Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.)
and John Kerry (D-Mass.), the legislation
sets targets for greenhouse gas emissions

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

that are tougher than those in a cap-andtrade bill passed by the House in June.
But it glosses over the crucial question of emission-credit allowances, which
House-bill sponsors Henry Waxman (DCalif.) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) incorporated to overcome business opposition.
If the Senate bill passed, reconciliation
with the House measure would become
a high-dollar competition for allowances
and other favors.
The oil and gas industry could hope
only to limit damage.
In the House bill, which makes refiners
responsible for their customers’ emissions
as well as their own, damage is extreme.
The American Petroleum Institute
estimates the measure would force the
refining industry to make or pay for 44%
of total required emission cuts yet allow it
only 2.5% of available credits.
To expect meaningfully better treatment of refiners on the Senate floor or in
conference would be dangerously hopeful.
As presented, the Boxer-Kerry bill faces
probable defeat in the full Senate because
of its costs. But some opponents say they
might back the legislation if it contained
support for nuclear energy and new oil
and gas leasing.
The industry should resist the tradeoff.
Politically inspired side deals steer attention away from two core cap-and-trade
drawbacks: that the framework invites corruption and obscures increases in energy
costs.
Furthermore, expanded access to federally owned hydrocarbon resources has
merit by itself and never should have to
come at the expense of refiners’ health.
The compromise under discussion also
has the potential to divide producers from
refiners and independent refiners from
their integrated counterparts.
A fracturing like that would be regrettable. A united industry speaks more
coherently and exerts more influence than
a splintered one. In the confused politics
of the day, the oil and gas industry needs
all the influence it can muster.

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

EIA adopts new methodology
The US Energy Information Administration has adopted a new methodology to
show high and low ranges in forecasts of oil and natural gas prices, as revealed in
the October issue of its Short Term Energy Outlook (STEO).
Rather than continuing the use of variables such as inventories, gross domestic
product, weather, OPEC’s spare production capacity, and non-OPEC output, EIA
now derives confidence intervals around expected futures prices using the “implied volatilities” of benchmark oil and gas options markets on NYMEX.
“The EIA believes that this methodology represents a market-cleared estimate
of risks, i.e., a buyer and seller have agreed on the value of an option,” said Adam
Sieminski, chief energy economist, Deutsche Bank, Washington, DC, in an Oct. 9
report. The advantage over using historical volatilities, EIA said, is that it assesses
future price uncertainty based directly on current market data and the expectations of “highly informed” market participants. The same system is used to assess
market uncertainty by the US Federal Reserve Board and the Bank of England.
Price outlooks
EIA expects West Texas Intermediate to average $70/bbl over this year’s last
quarter and into first-quarter 2010 before rising gradually to $75/bbl by yearend
2010 as US and world economic conditions improve. “We believe prices will be
somewhat stronger in the near term as recovering economy and short-term weakness in the US dollar hold prices closer to $75/bbl over the fourth quarter and
first quarter,” said Sieminski. “However, the potential for some world economic
setbacks in mid-2010 encourages us to maintain a below-consensus outlook for
the second half of 2010 when we believe oil price could sink toward $60/bbl. We
retain the view that 2011 oil prices will average $80/bbl, a price we feel is more in
line with extraction costs.”
EIA’s confidence band around its gas prices forecasts is based on implied volatilities for the Henry Hub gas options on NYMEX. “EIA’s spot prices in the recently
published STEO are $1/MMbtu lower than the NYMEX futures strip,” Sieminski
said. “This difference reflects EIA’s expectation that a significant volume of natural
gas production remains economic at prices below the current NYMEX 2010 futures
prices.” He said EIA expects gas demand in the power industry—a crucial outlet
for high gas supplies this year—to be limited in 2010 as prices move slightly higher
and new coal-fired power generation capacity comes on line.
EIA forecast the Henry Hub spot price will average $5/MMbtu in 2010. “Our view
is more in line with the NYMEX curve,” said Sieminski. “We expect gas prices to
average $4.75/MMbtu in the fourth quarter, rising to a $6/MMbtu average in 2010.
We have maintained our 2011 estimate of $8/MMbtu because we believe the combination of lower supply and a recovered economy will allow the market to tighten
significantly. Our $6/MMbtu gas price forecast for 2010 is still low enough, in our
view, to support gas consumption growth in the key industrial and electric utility
markets.” The November gas contract closed at $4.96/MMbtu on Oct. 8, which was
“high enough to discourage some storage activity,” he said.
Iran’s ties to South America
While confronting Iran’s nuclear program, the administration of US President
Barack Obama also should address that country’s growing influence and connections with anti-US regimes in Latin America, warned a security and economic
expert in a recent opinion piece in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
Expansion of Iranian influence in the Western Hemisphere—diplomatic, economic, military, and terrorist infrastructure—has been rapid in the last 2 years,
said Roman D. Ortiz, senior associate in the security and defense consulting firm
Grupo Triarius and a professor at the School of Economy at Los Andes University
in Bogota. He also reports a substantial increase in Iranian Revolutionary Guards
(IRG) and their terrorist Hezbollah colleagues from Lebanon, with the IRG in close
cooperation with Venezuelan intelligence agencies.
“The radical leftist governments of Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Nicaragua
view Iran as a partner with whom they share common ground: hostility towards
the US. The result is an anti-American alliance in the heart of the Western Hemisphere,” Ortiz warned. Tehran hopes the threat of terrorist retaliation from Latin
America will discourage the US and Israel from attacks against Iran’s nuclear
infrastructure. Its goal is to shift US attention to the Western Hemisphere from the
Middle East, said Ortiz.

Welcome.

Letter from the Chairman and Chairman-elect
Welcome to LAGCOE 2009. On behalf of the LAGCOE
Executive Committee, Board of Directors, and volunteers, thank you for your attendance at our event. Our
Exposition is truly a unique event where industry leaders
exhibit the latest in equipment and technology and target key issues affecting the oil & gas industry through
our technical sessions.
Our 27th industry showcase promises to be a great
success and unparalleled business opportunity. Held
biennially at the Cajundome and Convention Center in
Lafayette, LA, our event is hosted by over 200 industry
volunteers and consistently attracts 16,000 attendees,
including major decision makers from all across the
Gulf Coast, to view featured exhibits by nearly 400 leading companies.
Since our ﬁrst show in 1955, LAGCOE has evolved
much like the oil and gas industry. Originally an exhibition focused primarily on the Louisiana Gulf Coast, today
we are one of the two largest petroleum industry conferences in the nation, attracting international attention.
LAGCOE has once again been selected to participate as a U.S. Department of Commerce “International
Buyer Program” event. Through this program, the
U.S. Commercial Service, located in U.S. Embassies and
Consulates around the world and particularly in key oil
producing countries, have promoted LAGCOE to foreign
government ofﬁcials and industry business people. As a
result of this promotion, LAGCOE is once again hosting
a large group of international visitors from approximately 20 countries. These international business people
will be visiting with LAGCOE exhibitors to purchase
equipment and/or learn about the latest technology available to the industry for upcoming work in their respective countries.
Just as the energy industry is constantly advancing
to meet new challenges and demands, LAGCOE exhib-

its and technical sessions are designed to support bold,
innovative approaches in the quest for energy.
Our exhibits offer the most advanced technology for
pursuing organizational goals. The products and services showcased here are cutting edge—the high tech
tools of the 21st century. LAGCOE technical sessions are
designed to offer solutions for the challenges of today’s
oil and gas environment where new technologies and
approaches are critical to enhancing production and
minimizing costs.
Finally, we want to thank the hundreds of volunteers
who rolled up their sleeves and did whatever was necessary to make this a great show. We especially acknowledge Event Manager Sally Ware, Angela Cring, and our
other hard-working professional staff for playing a vital
role in the success of this event.
Again, welcome to LAGCOE 2009. All of us are at
your service. We want to make this an exposition you’ll
remember for a long time to come, so call on us if we can
assist you in any way.
Regards,

Howard Wilson
LAGCOE Chairman

2009 LAGCOE Looey

LAGCOE honors Frank W. Harrison, Jr., for the signiﬁcant role
he has played in the industry’s growth and progress.
Frank W. Harrison, Jr. was born in Bastrop, Louisiana,
where his father was employed by Union Producing
Company as an area production and drilling supervisor.
After completing his primary and secondary education in
Bastrop, his family ties to the petroleum industry inﬂuenced Frank to enter Louisiana State University to study
geology. Frank’s accomplishments at LSU included being
a Cadet Colonel in the ROTC and student president of the
college of Arts and Sciences. Frank graduated from LSU
in petroleum geology in 1951. Frank joined the Union
Producing Company in Jackson, Mississippi in 1951.
Soon after this event Frank’s professional life was interrupted by military service in Korea where he served as a
ﬁeld artillery ofﬁcer and as a staff ofﬁcer.
Upon returning from the military, Frank was
assigned to New Orleans where for the next three years
he gained valuable experience as an oil scout, well sitting
and conducting subsurface studies along the Miocene
trend of coastal Louisiana. The last two years were spent
with Seaboard Oil Company. In 1956 Frank moved to
Lafayette, Louisiana, as district geologist for TransTex
Drilling Company, a subsidiary of Husky Oil Company.
Following this employment he served as head geologist
for American Natural Gas Production Company.
In 1959 Frank became an independent and consultant in Lafayette and entered into a partnership with
Jack Martin which prospered in the search for oil and
gas in South Louisiana. In 1982 Frank formed South
Louisiana Ventures, an exploration company staffed
to originate prospects and to conduct leasing and
drilling operations. Later, he established Optimistic Oil
Company in 1990.
During Frank’s tenure as an independent geologist,
his exploration efforts have been very successful in ﬁnd-

ing resources through new ﬁeld discoveries and extensions. Frank participated in the discovery and development of the Johnson Bayou Field, the Maurice Field, the
Bunchy Creek Field, and the Beaver Dam Creek Field.
In addition, he participated in the extension with Jack
Martin in the Deep Lake Field, the Section 28 Field
and numerous other signiﬁcant extensions in South
Louisiana. One of Frank’s unique attributes is his ability
to pursue, with equal energy and client integrity, both
consulting work and a program directed at ﬁnding oil
and gas. His consulting activities have always been an
important and satisfying part of his professional life.
This is particularly applicable to his continued involvement as a unitization expert. Although he has limited
his practice, he continues to appear before the State
Conservation Commissioner as an expert witness and
has gained recognition in this ﬁeld as one of the select
few geologists automatically sought after when regulatory unitization is necessary. Frank’s client list includes
a number of the larger independents and major oil companies operating in Louisiana.
Throughout Frank’s career as a practicing geologist he has almost continuously been involved with professional societies and worthwhile organizations for
whom he has assumed various positions of leadership.
The culmination of these honors was his election to the
presidency of the American Association of Petroleum
Geologists for the term 1981-1982. Other professional
organizations where he has served as president are the
Lafayette Geological Society, the Gulf Coast Association
of Geological Societies, the American Geological Institute
and the Louisiana Association of Independent Producers
and Royalty Owners Association (now LOGA). He is also a
recipient of the AAPG’s coveted Honorary Member award.

University of
Louisiana Lafayette.

The partnership between the University of Louisiana and the Oil and Gas
Industry is a strong one, and that’s thanks in large part to a thriving
Petroleum Engineering Department.

Since 1955, the Petroleum Engineering Department
in the College of Engineering has been educating undergraduates and graduates for the workforce and advancing the industry through faculty research including
well completion, production optimization and drilling
mechanics. For over 50 years, it has educated graduates
who serve the oil and gas industry worldwide.
“Petroleum Engineering graduates of UL Lafayette
are some of the best in the industry,” said Dr. Ali
Ghalambor, head of UL Lafayette’s petroleum engineering department. “They are highly sought after by major
production companies, the service industry, as well as
smaller independently-owned companies.”
UL Lafayette is one of only 16 schools nationwide to
offer a petroleum engineering curriculum.

STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT
The UL Lafayette Student Chapter of the Society
of Petroleum Engineering (SPE) is one of the best.
Last year, it was recognized as the 2008 Outstanding
Student Chapter during the 2008 SPE Annual Technical
Conference and Exhibition.
There are nearly 125 student chapters worldwide.
The award recognizes exceptional merit in a chapter
whose programs, activities and level of participation in
an academic year distinguish that chapter from other
chapters. The award is only presented when a student
chapter meets all criteria.

“They are extremely active in university and industry events. They participate in community service projects, fundraising activities, and they mentor ﬁrst-time
freshman and international students, helping them
adjust to academic life,” said Ghalambor, faculty advisor
to the SPE Student Chapter. “Our students have gained
global recognition among industry professionals for
their strong show of participation and their enthusiasm
for working in the petroleum industry.”

FACULTY AND FACILITIES
Petroleum Engineering at UL Lafayette also has
established a distinguished tradition in training, continuing education, research and economic development.
The department is internationally known for its many
contributions in drilling, well completions and production technology, and its faculty has published more than
10 books in the last several years.
The industry has utilized the Petroleum Engineering
Department’s excellent laboratory facilities for various
testing and product development over the years. The
department, with the assistance from several petroleum professionals, is planning and organizing the
2010 Society of Petroleum Engineers International
Symposium and Exhibition on Formation Damage
Control in Lafayette, which is the premier event for well
completion technology.

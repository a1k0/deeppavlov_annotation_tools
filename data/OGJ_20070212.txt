Engineering Your Competitive Edge

We found a way to keep oil rigs drilling 10 times longer.
Will anyone else? Don’t hold your breath.

What problem can we solve for you? One drilling operation was tired of bringing up nothing but worn
bearings. So they asked us to extend the life of these critical components. Today they average 300 hours of
uninterrupted operation, up from just 30. Our metallurgical engineers can find similarly innovative solutions
to the problems you’re facing, then deploy and support them globally. Find out more at kennametal.com.

Shell, Repsol may face probe over S. Pars deal
Repsol YFP SA and Royal Dutch Shell PLC may come under
investigation by US authorities for an agreement the companies
signed with National Iranian Oil Co.
“If there’s an investment greater than a certain amount, as specified in US law, then our lawyers take a look at it and the policymakers take a look at it, and see if there’s any further steps that we, as
a government, take,” said US Department of State spokesman Sean
McCormack.
On Jan. 30, Iran reported the completion of a preliminary
$10 billion deal with Repsol YPF and Shell to produce 16 million
tonnes/year of LNG from Iran’s South Pars field (OGJ Online, Jan.
30, 2007). Shell and Repsol YPF would each have 25% of the project, with NIOC holding 50%.
McCormack did not discuss any sanctions Repsol YPF and Shell
might face if they went through with their agreement, but he suggested that a final decision on whether to proceed is expected in
first quarter 2008.

Kurds say Iraq draft oil law not yet ﬁnalized
Kurdish officials have dismissed the idea that Iraq’s main political factions have overcome their differences on a draft oil law and
said a final agreement could be some time away.
The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) issued a statement
saying the draft law has not been unanimously finalized and that
statements to the contrary—attributed to an oil ministry spokesman—were inaccurate and misleading.
KRG attributed the remarks to a Jan. 17 article published by
Reuters news service that quoted the ministry spokesman as saying, “The committee finalized the draft of the law last night [Jan.
16]. It was approved unanimously, and it will go before the cabinet
early next week.”
The Kurdish group acknowledged that the process of drafting
the oil law is nearing completion but said important annexes to the
law are still pending and that three associated laws must be drafted
and approved before the whole package can be considered final.
KRG identified the additional laws as the revenue-sharing law,
the Iraq National Oil Co. charter law, and a law to define the oil
ministry’s new role.
Under the draft law, KRG would be allowed to negotiate and
sign new contracts within its region and to receive its share of
Iraq’s oil revenue, to be guaranteed and regulated by law.
The draft law also acknowledges that KRG is the competent authority to review its own previous contracts and make them consistent with the law.
KRG’s announcement coincided with reports that South Korea
will send a joint business-government delegation to Kurdistan to
discuss future oil field developments.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

The South Korean Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Energy
announced the trip, saying the delegation plans to meet with KRG’s
head and the minister of natural resources.
A ministry spokesman said the team is expected to review future oil field development endeavors and security conditions in the
region.
Officials from the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Energy,
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Korea National Oil Corp.,
GS-Caltex Corp., and SK Corp. will be in the 14-person delegation
to Kurdistan Jan. 22-25.

Japan’s Middle East oil imports fell 1% in 2006
Japanese imports of Middle East crude fell in 2006, dropping
by 1% from 2005, when they represented 90.2% of the country’s
consumption.
The decline is attributed to efforts of government officials and
domestic oil distributors that are eyeing new supply sources outside the Middle East, including Angola, Sudan, Russia, Azerbaijan,
and Central Asia.
Nippon Oil Corp. and five other companies began sourcing supplies from the Sakhalin-1 oil and natural gas development project
in Russia, while Idemitsu Kosan Co. recently signed an agreement
to purchase crude oil from Azerbaijan.
In Angola, Japanese firms hold stakes in 13 different concessions, while in Sudan, reports say Japanese agencies have been negotiating for rights to oil concessions in the southern region of the
country since 2005.
Last August, former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi took a
4-day trip to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan with the aim of securing
energy resources and boosting his country’s presence in the two
oil-producing Central Asian countries.

Russia, Algeria agree to energy cooperation
State oil firm Sonatrach is interested in exploring four Russian
gas fields after discussing energy cooperation with representatives
from OAO Gazprom in Algeria Jan 21.
According to Russian reports, Russia’s Industry and Energy
Minister Viktor Khristenko said that under an energy cooperation
agreement signed last August, Gazprom had offered Sonatrach a variety of exploration rights for eight hydrocarbon fields. Khristenko
said, “Gazprom has made its offer of assets exchange. Algeria has
selected four fields and is working out its offers.”
Algeria, in turn, is preparing a number of asset proposals for
Gazprom to evaluate in an asset swap.
Russia and Algeria signed another energy cooperation accord
Jan. 21 that will cover the entire petroleum chain from exploration
to marketing. The reports added that Russia’s OAO Rosneft and the

Algerian oil production.
Rosneft and Stroytransgaz are joint partners with a 60% stake in
Block 245 South exploration project in Algeria; Sonatrach has the
other 40%. The Russian companies plan to apply for a production
license for two fields that have reserves of 26.8 million bbl.

The European Union has expressed concern about a closer partnership between Russia and Algeria, as they are the biggest gas
suppliers to the EU. Senior officials from both countries sought to
reassure the EU that there was no need for alarm. “Russia and Algeria are reliable suppliers of energy,” Khristenko said in the state-run
Algerie Presse Service. ✦

ExxonMobil to start exploration in Sirte basin
ExxonMobil Corp., under an exploration and production-sharing agreement with Libya’s National Oil Co., will carry out exploration over four blocks in the Sirte basin, 100 miles off Libya.
The blocks are in Contract Area 20, which covers 2.5 million
acres and was awarded to ExxonMobil in the third round of EPSAIV licensing in December. The contract area lies in 4,000-6,500 ft
of water.
ExxonMobil said it has completed an environmental impact assessment and has met with local stakeholders. The company also is
shooting a 2D seismic survey in Contract Area 44 in the Cyrenaica
basin off Libya.

Murphy has Sabah deepwater gas discovery
Murphy Oil Corp. said its Rotan-1 deepwater exploration well
off Sabah, Malaysia, “encountered significant natural gas pay” in a
single zone.
It is the company’s first discovery in four exploration wells on
the block (OGJ, Dec. 11, 2006, p. 15).
Subsurface details were scant, but the well went to TD 7,024 ft
in 3,773 ft of water 80 km from shore and 50 km from the nearest
producing field to the southeast. Petronas operates that field.
The well encountered sweet, dry gas, Murphy said. It gave no
specific appraisal plan or timing but said a rig could return before
the end of 2007.
Block H interests are Murphy 80% and Petronas 20%.

NE British Columbia ﬁnd has gas in two zones
Wyn Developments Inc., Vancouver, BC, participated in a Mississippian Debolt gas discovery at Prophet River 75 miles south of
Fort Nelson, BC.
The Prophet River d-60-E/94-G-15 exploratory well, operated
by EnCana Corp., flowed gas at an initial unstabilized rate of up to
7.943 MMcfd from 4,440 ft. The wellsite is 11 miles northwest of
Tommy Lakes Halfway gas field.
Pressures and gas returns, coupled with known seismic and
geological data, suggest likely communication with wells drilled
by other operators 5 km southeast and 24 km south, Wyn Developments said. Seismic data also suggest that the gas reservoir extends
to the northwest.
The d-60-E well also encountered 75 ft of prospective pay in the
Triassic Halfway formation at 1,870 ft. The gas shows, log analysis, and seismic data suggest that the Halfway formation extends
northwest and also 7 km southeast to the c-97-D well that tested
gas. Approximate TD is 8,530 ft.
The company sees the potential of seven more Mississippian
and seven more Triassic Halfway development wells on 21 sq miles

of Prophet River lands. Potential exists to dually produce from the
zones.
If a summer development program is successful, production facilities could be in place in early 2008.

UK awards 150 licenses in 24th licensing round
The UK’s Department for Trade and Industry (DTI) has named
Maersk Oil North Sea UK Ltd., EnCore Oil PLC, and Ithaca Energy
recipients of exploration and production licenses in the UK North
Sea under the nation’s 24th licensing round.
DTI had invited 104 companies, 17 of which are new to the UK
continental shelf, to develop 246 blocks—continuing the record
number of licences issued last year. DTI awarded 150 exploration
and production licenses to the winners.
EnCore won 7 licenses covering 12 blocks and part blocks in the
Central North Sea, East Irish Sea, Northern North Sea, and Southern
North Sea. It expects to operate three of the licenses.
On Blocks 28/9 and 28/10b (split), the operator, Oilexco
North Sea Ltd. will drill a well within 12 months, paying a small
part of EnCore’s well costs. EnCore will operate Block 14/30a and
could drill a well, depending on what it learns from the nearby
14/30a-2 heavy oil discovery. On Blocks 113/29c and 113/30,
Nautical Petroleum PLC and EnCore have a “drill or drop” option
on a sizable offshore prospect that could be drilled from an onshore location.
Ithaca Energy secured 7 blocks, including Blocks 14/17(part)
and 14/18c, which are adjacent to its Athena project in the Outer
Moray Firth area. Block 14/18c contains a satellite discovery previously made by well 14/18-1, Athena East (formerly known as
Bordeaux) that tested 1,250 b/d of oil in Upper Jurassic. “A water
contact has not yet been established, which leads management to
believe the project has upside potential. Block 14/18c may also
contain upside with the extension of the Athena Lower Cretaceous
discovery tested by well 14/18-15 drilled by Ithaca in 2006. Block
14/17(part) is immediately west and on trend with Athena,” Ithaca said.
Maersk Oil was granted 15 licenses and will work with Eni SPA,
Noble Energy Inc., BG Group, Nippon Oil Co., Chevron Corp., and
Talisman Energy UK Group in different consortiums for different
blocks.
Alistair Darling, secretary of state for DTI, said, “There are potentially more than 20 billion bbl of oil and gas still available to
be produced, which is good news for industry, our economy, and
energy supply.”
However, DTI has delayed offering four blocks in Cardigan Bay
(106/30, 107/21, and 107/22) and the Moray Firth to potential
winners because it has received environmental challenges about

Uzbekistan, oil ﬁrms ink PSA for Aral Sea section
Uzbekistan, along with a consortium of state-owned Uzbekneftegaz, Lukoil Overseas, Petronas, China National Petroleum
Corp., and Korea National Oil Co., have signed a production-sharing agreement for the Uzbek section of the Aral Sea.
In a statement Lukoil said a 35-year PSA for the project was
signed in Tashkent on Aug. 30, 2006, and that all members of the
consortium have equal shares in the project.
A tender was issued in January for a 2D seismic survey of Uzbekistan’s section of the Aral Sea, which covers 2,300 linear km—
50% onshore and 50% offshore, including the tidelands and waters
as deep as 40 m.
In addition to the seismic survey, the PSA calls for the drilling
of two exploration wells over a 3-year period at a cost of $100
million.

S. Texas gas productivity declining, report says
South Texas natural gas wells examined in a recent study are losing productivity, and rising costs of materials and labor are driving
up operating costs, according to Ziff Energy Group.
The average well productivity of the fields studied fell by 25%
during 2000-05. The 2005 average operating expense was 98¢/
Mcf equivalent vs. 59¢/Mcf in 2000.
Ziff’s South Texas benchmarking study included production primarily in Texas Railroad Commission Districts 2 and 4. Seven operating companies provided data on 25 fields in the study.
The fields analyzed produced 1 bcfd from more than 2,400
wells. Total annual operating costs of the fields came to $250 million.

Petrobras America Inc. on Feb. 4 began producing from the first
well in the Cottonwood gas-condensate field in the Gulf of Mexico—the first deepwater field outside of Brazil that Petrobras, as
operator, has developed and put into production.
The field lies in 2,300 ft of water on Garden Banks Block 244
about 138 miles off Texas.
Gas production from the well is being increased initially to 40
MMscfd.

Contracts let for Al-Jubail petrochemical complex
Saudi Kayan Petrochemical Co. (Saudi Kayan) on Jan. 24 let
separate contracts to two companies for the construction of a polypropylene (PP) and a low-density polyethylene (LDPE) plant at its
petrochemical complex, for which construction is slated to begin
this month in Al-Jubail Industrial City, Saudi Arabia (OGJ Online,
Dec. 11, 2006, Newsletter).

Samsung Engineering was awarded the contract to build the
350,000-tonne/year PP plant, and Simon Carves Ltd., UK, received
the contract to build a 300,000-tonne/year LDPE plant.
The $2.2 billion complex, expected to be operational in December 2009, will have a capacity exceeding 4 million tonnes/year.
Saudi Kayan is a joint venture of Saudi Basic Industries Corp.
35% and Kayan Petrochemical Co. 20%. The remaining 45% will
be offered for public subscription. ✦

IGI gas line to become operational in 2011
Italy and Greece are planning to build a 220-km pipeline that
will transport 8 billion cu m/year of gas from the Caspian Sea to
Europe via Turkey from 2011.
The protocol of intent was signed Jan. 31 in Athens by Greek
Development Minister Dimitris Sioufas and his Italian counterpart,
Pierluigi Bersani.
Next year both countries will start building the subsea underwater pipeline between Greece’s west coast and southern Italy.
Italy’s Edison SPA and Greece’s Depa will have a respective 80-20
transmission capacity in the pipeline, which has been dubbed the
Italy Greece Interconnector (IGI). IGI will be linked to an existing
pipeline connecting Turkey and Greece, which is to start operations
later this year.
Third parties also will gain access to some incremental IGI capacity. The companies agreed to swap larger amounts of gas at the
virtual Italian Swap Point, contributing to the establishment of a
gas exchange.
Edison and Depa have already started negotiations for gas supplies from some producing countries in the Caspian Sea basin and
with those that will cross the pipeline.
Edison said that the commitment from the governments would
fast-track construction of the pipeline because of its strategic importance to the European Union in diversifying its gas supplies.
Russia supplies about 25% of western Europe’s gas needs.

RWE proposes Czech Republic-Belgium pipeline
RWE Energy AG plans to construct a 5 billion cu m/year gas
pipeline that will extend from the Czech Republic to Belgium. It
would start operations in 2011 and reduce Germany’s reliance on
Russian gas imports.
Plans call for a 560-km line to originate in Sayda on the Czech
border and cross through Werne in Germany and a 200-km section
extending to the Belgian system in the Aachen area.
“The pipeline would form a direct link between the Czech and
the German gas transport grids of RWE Energy,” RWE said. Germany, Great Britain, and the BeNeLux countries are the proposed
customers for gas supplies from the Caspian Sea area, the Middle
East, and Egypt.
The $1.3 billion project is another European route intended to
diversify its significant reliance on Russia, however RWE did not
rule out sourcing Russian gas supplies.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

An RWE spokeswoman told OGJ the pipeline would bring in
regasified LNG from its proposed 7.3 million tonne/year Adriatic
terminal in Croatia, which will start operations in 2011. She said
the Czech pipeline could link to other pipelines that could connect to OMV AG’s proposed 8 billion cu m/year Nabucco pipeline
through southeastern Europe (see map, OGJ, June 13, 2005, p. 60).
She emphasized that the project was in the early stages and that
nothing has been finalized.
RWE has invited third parties to take up capacity on a nondiscriminatory basis in the Czech pipeline to determine if it should
increase its capacity of 5 billion cu m.
To more quickly launch the project, RWE is seeking an exemption from the German Federal Grid Agency and the European Commission’s rules on grid regulation, stressing that the infrastructure
improves supply security and increases competition.
Berthold Bonekamp, CEO of RWE Energy AG, said, “We want
to invest in new capacities. Additional gas procurement options in
Europe promote competition.”

CenterPoint, Spectra pull plug on gas pipeline
CenterPoint Energy Gas Transmission Co. and Spectra Energy
have agreed to call off development of a joint Midcontinent Crossing (MCX) pipeline, which proposed to move natural gas from basins in the Midcontinent to interconnects serving the US Northeast
and Southeast (OGJ Online, June 12, 2006, Newsletter).
“Market and economic analyses do not support the construction of the proposed pipeline at this time,” the companies said in
a joint statement.
CenterPoint and Spectra plan to continue to “independently
evaluate opportunities for building infrastructure to transport
Midcontinent natural gas supplies including projects in the vicinity of the proposed MCX pipeline,” adding, “Should the appropriate project present itself, we would be willing to look at
it jointly.”

BP reports 600,000 b/d throughput for BTC line
BP PLC reported that throughput at the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
crude pipeline has reached 600,000 b/d, but it plans eventually to
increase that to 1 million b/d.
Initially the line transported oil only from the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli fields, but in January BP added production from the offshore
Shah Deniz gas-condensate field.
BP said it expects future increased volumes will “include those
from across the Caspian, possibly commencing by the end of
2007.” ✦

the trip.
• About 16 Mcf of hydrogen could

At a cost of $11/GGE—the highest
fuel cost in the report—the trip would
cost $804 despite the 41 miles/GGE
economy rating.

What matters most
For purposes of presenting straightforward data, PM based its fuel findings
solely on cost. In doing so, it stripped
away any environmental or human factors that might have come into play.
For example, the inexpensive drive
across the country in the electricpowered car did not take into account
how many stops might be needed, and
therefore how long the trip might take.
Nor did it consider the ton of coal that
was burned to do it.
What seems to matter most in this
price-based analysis is that cost still
carries a majority of the weight in our
transportation-oriented world. ✦

Furnishing crisis
The story often is told that in 1897 William
Randolph Hearst, publisher of the New York
Journal, sent artist Frederic S. Remington to Cuba
to record a developing war between the US and
Spain. Remington sent a telegram from Havana
reporting, “Everything is quiet. There is no trouble
here. There will be no war. I wish to return.”
Hearst replied: “Please remain. You furnish the
pictures, and I’ll furnish the war.”
This possibly fictitious exchange resembles
controversy over climate change. Ever since the
1988 hearing that then-Democratic Sen. Al Gore of
Tennessee held about an atmospheric build-up of
greenhouse gases and the implications for global
average temperature, the public has feared a crisis,
and a cadre of provocateurs has strained to furnish
one.

IPCC summary
Into the nasty war of opinion that has ensued,
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
this month delivered another of its analogs of the
incendiary graphics Hearst wanted from Remington. The “Summary for Policymakers” from
Working Group I of IPCC’s Fourth Assessment
Report sounds familiar alarms: carbon dioxide is
accumulating in the atmosphere; global average
temperature has increased; certainty is growing
that the gas build-up caused some warming; and
human activity deserves blame.
If the summary is accurate, the IPCC’s Fourth
Assessment, due in May, will reflect greater knowledge about observed planetary warming and associated phenomena than was available to the Third
Assessment Report, published in 2001. Among
other things, it will document increased certainty
about the human role in observed warming.
But does it furnish a crisis?
“The understanding of anthropogenic warming
and cooling influences on climate has improved
since the Third Assessment Report, leading to very
high confidence that the globally averaged net
effect of human activities since 1750 has been
one of warming, with a radiative forcing of +1.6
[+0.6 to +2.4] w/sq m,” the summary says. Proponents of mandatory cuts in CO2 emissions have
seized on that and other such statements to argue
that there’s no need for further debate, that the

science is “settled,” and that opposition to urgent
precaution bespeaks immoral obstructionism.
But they’ve always said those things. Their costly political agenda needs a crisis, and they rely on
the IPCC to furnish it. Gore has made a career of
this. Indeed, he seems to have been right when he
asserted, before science could be conclusive about
it, that human activity has contributed to observed
warming of the past half-century. But is this the
crisis that Gore insists creates a moral imperative
to overhaul energy use?
The new IPCC assessment provides reason to
think not. Climate change skeptic Christopher
Monckton, who served as a special adviser to former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, points
out that the new report has halved its projection to
2100 of a prominent warming fear: sea level rise.
He also notes that the IPCC’s estimate of humaninduced radiative forcing is down from the 2001
estimate of 2.43 w/sq m. And of the IPCC’s six
modeled temperature scenarios, Monckton argues,
three are “extreme exaggerations,” two of which
are based on population forecasts far above general
expectations. Temperature-increase projections of
the Fourth Assessment aren’t directly comparable
with those of the Third Assessment, where the topof-range figure was 5.8º C. by 2100. But excluding
the top three scenarios on the basis of Monckton’s
observation would keep the maximum temperature rise seen by the new assessment at no more
than 4º.

Abating crisis
By this reading of the IPCC summary, science is
more certain than before about the human link to
observed warming, but the effect in terms of radiative forcing is smaller than was thought 6 years
ago, as are maximum warming by 2100 and sealevel rise. So the crisis—if that’s what it is—seems
to be abating. This news should comfort anyone
wondering what response may be appropriate. The
new report makes clear that the warming and sealevel rise will continue for a very long time even
if emissions of greenhouse gas concentrations
somehow stabilize.
Had Hearst learned something comparable
about Cuba, he might have called Remington
home. ✦

In May 2006, Russia offered to buy
gas from Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan
at prices exceeding $100/thousand cu

price—in exchange for reassurances that
the country would not build or send its
gas through pipelines that would cut

In September 2006 Gazprom signed
a deal with Turkmenistan to buy 162

gas exported will be delivered through
Russia and that Turkmenistan is not interested in a trans-Caspian gas pipeline.

such as Poland key to diversification

this project could be raised in Europe

It probably would require more than

a pivotal role in global energy supply
and future energy security for the US.
Having Russia’s energy resources available, to act as a foil against potential
supply interruptions precipitated by
OPEC policies as several of its members
harden their anti-US-OECD stance, is
a good reason for OECD countries to
establish and maintain good relations
with Russia.
In 2006 across the Middle East
region, sectarian violence persisted
in Iraq; Iran continued to pursue its
nuclear ambitions; open hostilities
erupted between Israel and Lebanon
and between Israel and the Palestinians;
and Taliban offensives, launched from
Pakistan, were renewed in Afghanistan.
These heightened tensions across the
Middle East, where some 60% of the
world’s proved petroleum reserves
reside, suggest that the US is unlikely to
precipitate further instability in world
energy supplies by confronting Russia’s
expansionist and bullying energy strategy in the near future.

West should consider ramiﬁcations of its off-oil rhetoric
Gavin Longmuir
Consulting Petroleum Engineer
Stanley, NM
A.F. Alhajji
Ohio Northern University
Ada, Ohio
Environmental and political enthusiasm in the West for getting rid of oil
as an energy source may have major
unintended consequences through its
impact on decisions by a handful of key
oil exporters. Such consequences could
paradoxically include increased Western
dependence on oil and higher energy
prices.
An energy crisis is imminent if oilexporting countries believe Western
rhetoric and decide to reduce their
investment in capacity expansions at a
time when the West is failing to find a
suitable substitute. In this case, consumers will pay a dear price for the ill-considered statements of their leaders.
If, by contrast, oil producers attempt
to counter a policy-induced decline
in demand and kill oil substitutes by
raising production to lower crude oil
prices, or if demand actually declines, a
different set of problems might emerge.
Either scenario could wreak havoc on
the economies in the Middle East, supposedly one of the least stable areas in
the world. The cost of such political
instability in terms of lives, money, and
pollution will render all the positive
results from weaning consuming countries off oil negligible.
If oil-consuming countries wish to
lead the world safely to a future without
fossil fuels, they will have to consider
energy-market realities and how to
meet the revenue needs of current oil
exporters, as well as how to ensure adequate oil supplies during the transition
and investment sufficient to develop
new energy-supply technologies. The
new energy vision must adhere to market realities. Otherwise, market forces
will soon defeat these efforts.

that currently popular carbon capture
and storage is very energy-intensive
and, if implemented, will substantially
increase the demand for fossil fuels,
thus rendering their oil resources even
more valuable.
• Oil exporters could take Western
commentators seriously and assume
that oil importers will indeed reduce
their demand for oil, leaving them with
then-unmarketable oil in the ground.
Their logical response to this threat
would be to accelerate production of
oil while their resources still have value.
This would of course drive down the
price of oil and undermine the economic feasibility of alternative energies.
A collapse in the price of oil would
kill several new
energy technologies and ultimately increase
demand for oil. In fact, the oil-producing countries might view increasing
oil production and lowering prices as a
logical policy to counter the antioil policies of the governments of consuming
countries. Historical data from periods
of oil price collapses support this point:
Low oil prices increase oil demand,
decrease efficiency improvements,
choke alternative energy resources, and
increase waste.
• Alternatively, expecting a decline
in demand for their oil, oil-producing
countries might decide to reduce their
planned investments in production
capacity expansion and maintenance
and mothball some planned projects,
which would shortly lead to declining
oil supplies. If new technologies do not
come on line by the time oil production starts declining, the world will
face a serious energy crisis, probably
unparalleled in history. Reversing such
a trend of declining investments would
take years, despite massive increases in
oil prices. This alternative is not a mere
possibility: Several major projects have
been mothballed in the past when the
oil-producing governments deemed
these projects not needed.
• If oil-consuming countries do
begin to reduce their dependence on

oil, major oil exporters could seek to
use their now less-valuable oil within
their own borders as cheap fuel with
which to expand heavy industries.
Instead of exporting oil directly, they
could export the energy from that oil
embedded in metals, chemicals, and
manufactured products at prices that far
undercut Western products, constrained
as Western manufacturers would be by
having to use higher-cost alternative
energy sources. The net result would be
a loss of jobs and economic strength by
the West without having any impact on
the overall global consumption of fossil
fuels.
Even if Western countries successfully replaced imported oil with
indigenous alternative energy sources,
they would still have to live on the same
planet as oil-exporting countries, whose
fragile societies would then face the loss
of their main source of revenue. Energy
independence for current oil importers,
if somehow achieved, would aggravate
political instability in oil-exporting
countries.
In addition, it is unclear what will
happen to the world monetary system
without trade in oil and the associated
recycling of petrodollars. A change to a
world where most industrial countries
depend on their own domestic energy
resources would require a major change
in the global financial system. Such a
change would create its own difficulties, impacting even the industrial
countries.

from fossil fuels. Oil exporters might
reasonably expect importers to pay a
higher price for this “greener” oil.
Oil-producing countries also might
seek to become leaders in nonfossil
fuels through direct investment in projects or by research funding. Oil-producing countries in North Africa and the
Middle East, for example, have the large
areas of vacant land and consistent sunshine required by two of the alternative
energy sources most amenable to technological breakthrough: photovoltaics
and biofuels. An interesting question is
whether Western politicians now intolerant of oil from those regions might
respond in the same manner to alternative energy from the same places.
In the shorter term, oil exporters
might lobby consuming-nation governments for loopholes in antioil laws,
invest in the downstream businesses of
consuming countries to help meet oil
demand and gain local political influence, or fund unconstrained scientific
research into global climate processes.
Some such activities obviously might
strain ethics and, from the perspective
of oil exporters, backfire.

Goals of cooperation

Politicians, environmentalists, and
the public in oil-consuming countries
should not ignore the valid interests
of the oil exporters on which they
currently depend. Oil consumers and
producers will have to find ways to

Balancing these objectives will be
challenging. It might require politically difficult sacrifices by oil-consuming countries, such as compensating
exporting countries for their declining
sales volumes or mothballing their own
oil-production capacity.
The willingness to make such sacrifices and acceptance of such risks will
be a test of how serious oil consumers
are about weaning themselves off fossil
fuels. If industrial countries are reluctant to incur the costs of mothballing
their own sizable oil-production capacity or are unable to agree on an equitable sharing of the costs of this policy
between themselves, they will have
demonstrated that they are not serious
about reducing global oil consumption.
And OPEC countries can comfortably

CERA: Rising gas production costs diminishing returns
Fewer natural gas reserves are being
added for every dollar spent on exploration and production, and higher
costs are undermining the economics
of drilling more gas wells, Cambridge
Energy Research Associates said in a
recent report.
“Conventional wisdom is that all
producers are enjoying a windfall from
higher prices; however, the less-visible
cost of gas production has moved up
as dramatically as market prices,” said J.
Michael Bodell, CERA director, upstream gas strategies.
The report, “Diminishing Returns,”
analyzed full-cycle costs for wells
drilled in 2005. The study also identified a shift toward unconventional gas
production, now accounting for 25%
of total US and Canadian gas production.
CERA used statistics from its parent,
IHS, to analyze costs and production
rates for 48,000 wells completed in 50
US and Canadian gas basins (232 individual plays) in 2005.
Researchers found capital costs (ex-

cluding operating costs, royalties, and
return) were $1-6/Mcf.
The weighted average all-in cost
was from less than $4/Mcf to more
than $12/Mcf. Judged against record
2005 gas prices averaging $8.80/Mcf

prices and many other factors related
to well production,” Bodell said.
“However, viewed in the context of the
market and cost environment at the
time of drilling, it is clear that rising
service costs have begun to take away
much of the margin in many wells and
plays despite historically strong market
prices.”

More wells, ﬂat production

Declining productivity

“Record prices in 2005 triggered a
tremendous response in drilling by gas
producers, leading to nearly decadehigh reserves additions of 26.4 tcf and
added production of 14.7 bcf that year,”
Bodell said.
Yet production remained flat despite more rigs drilling during the past
decade, he said. Meanwhile, the cost
of new gas supply rose due to higher
drilling and operating costs as well as
declining average well productivity and
initial production rates.
“The ultimate economic performance of the wells drilled in 2005 will
depend on the trajectory of market

Record well completions are being
totally offset by declining well productivity, and price expectations will be key
to motivate continued strong drilling,
Bodell said.
“The fundamental driver of the
North American E&P challenge is the
relative maturity of the natural gas
resource base,” he said. “Although gas
resources are available—and some are
off limits due to access issues—and
new plays are being identified and
developed, many of these resources
are deeper, smaller, technically more
challenging, or more distant from
markets.”
The study found E&P companies are
developing smaller resources and facing
higher costs, with the inevitable result
of increased unit costs. Within this overall trend, many regions still reported
strong margins and provide returns on
equity of well above 10%.
“The E&P companies that have
shifted their portfolios to include these
lower-cost resources, particularly the
early movers, are recognizing substantial cost advantages,” Bodell added.
The study also said producers have
heightened drilling levels to replace gas
lost from production declines in wells
drilled during previous years.
“If no further drilling occurred after
1999, North American wet gas production would have fallen to about 29 bcf

Khodorkovsky’s
woes continue

F

ormer Yukos head Mikhail
Khodorkovsky knows where he
stands in Vladimir Putin’s Russia regarding new charges brought against
him and business associate Platon
Lebedev.
“It is absolutely clear what will
happen next: Fake evidence, testimony from intimidated witnesses, and a
quick guilty verdict,” Khodorkovsky
said last week in a statement written
from his prison cell in Chita, eastern
Siberia.
Khodorkovsky and Lebedev were
charged on Feb. 5 with laundering
more than $20 billion. If Khodorkovsky is found guilty of the charges,
10 years or more could be added to
his sentence.
Once Russia’s richest man,
Khodorkovsky is serving 8 years on

he claims were fabricated by his enemies in the Kremlin to punish him
for his political ambitions.
He rejected the new charges

of the court.

sleep over the prospect of a new
prison term.
“A new verdict does not scare
me,” he wrote. “What difference does
it make how many years I get under
trumped-up charges? Whatever the
prospect, my persecutors—‘the party
seeking a second prison term for
Khodorkovsky’—are not trusted by
any decent person in the world.”
Yes, one can certainly agree with
him on that point. Who, after all, really does credit Putin with anything
more than a naked power grab in his
treatment of the former Yukos chief?

Future hopes

Considering that treatment,
Khodorkovsky has come to accept
his fate in the hope of something
better when Putin eventually leaves
office. “My future and that of Platon
Lebedev will entirely depend on the
future of our motherland and its
image after the change of power in
2008,” Khodorkovsky said.
He had better hope that Putin can

by 2006, or less than half the production level in 1999,” Bodell said.

Shift to unconventional gas
The CERA-IHS analysis found higher
prices combined with improved drilling
and rock fracture technology has accelerated development of unconventional
resources, which accounted for 23% of
total US and Canadian gas production
in 2005. That compared with 11% in
1995.
Unconventional gas has been
generally more costly to develop than
conventional gas until recently. Because
these resources have lower per-well
flow rates and require more wells in a
given area to maintain a given supply
level, gas production rates for wells
added in 2005 were about half that of
wells drilled 10 years earlier.
However, because unconventional
wells access larger deposits than their
conventional counterparts, they accelerate reserve growth and provide higher
production over a well’s 20-year life.
“On the question of whether unconventional gas is cheaper or more expensive than conventional resources, we
found there is no consistent answer,”
Bodell said. “Unconventional production basins are distributed throughout
the cost spectrum among the lowest
and the highest cost resources, and not
overweighted on either the low or high
end.”
Industry is investing heavily in unconventional resources, moving from
the easier plays and basins to more
challenging opportunities, he said.
“These more challenging resources
may come at a cost that has the potential to put them in direct competition
with imported LNG,” Bodell said. ✦

Regional geology

The Newark basin is an exposed,
elongate basin of Mesozoic age (Late
Triassic to Middle Jurassic) that extends
from New Jersey to Maryland (Fig. 1).
The basin is noted for its local exposures of red clastic rocks and diabase
dikes. More current analysis suggests
that the Newark basin is one of a series
of half-graben structures that formed
in North America, northwestern Africa,
and western Europe in response to the
breakup of the Pangaea supercontinent.
In the 1970s, a new

The Brunswick is a reddish brown

extends across the basin. The Lockatong,
as mentioned above, is the traditional
name given to the organic shale facies
member.
The caliper log for the Lockatong
suggests that there are multiple thin
beds that may be separated by bed parting or fracturing. The gamma ray log
suggests that these beds are interbedded
siltstone and organic shale. Analysis of
the neutron porosity and the density

Similar developments are found in

The author will conclude with the
comments of two geologists who do
not wish to be identified. One geologist
said, “This reservoir looks better than
the Barnett, even at this early stage of
development.” The other said, “Given
the limitations of the dataset and the
variables of basin configuration, what
we may be looking at is one of the last
significant, completely undeveloped
reservoirs left in the world.”
The lacustrine reservoirs of the
Newark basin hold great potential and
should encourage further testing by
drilling. ✦

Houston-based Particle Drilling Technologies Inc. has successfully
tested a new drilling system, designed to enhance
the rate of penetration
Drilling
through hard rock.
Particle-impact drilling (PID) is a closed-loop process in
which hardened steel shot particles are
injected into the drilling mud, circulated, and recovered from the mud
system without allowing the shot to
circulate through a rig’s pumps and
surface equipment. The process operates
under normal rig pump pressures, and
the particles entrained with the drilling fluid are accelerated through the

O D U C T I O N

nozzles in a specially designed fixedcutter drillbit (Fig. 1).
Conventional drillbits crush and
grind rock, but PID does not rely on
weight-on-bit and torque to mechanically break the rock.
The PID drillbit combines minimal
mechanical grinding with hydraulic
blasting. It removes rock by blasting it
with the hardened steel particles (50-55
Rc), which comprise about
2-3% of the drilling mud by
volume and strike the rock
more than 4 million times/
min, according to PDTI (Fig.
2).
PDTI’s Greg Galloway

Testing at TerraTek Inc. in July 2005 demonstrates that the PID bit cuts a near-gauge hole (Fig. 3a at left). A cross section of the test block shows the volume
excavated by the impact of the steel particles (Fig. 3b at right; photos from Particle Drilling Technologies Inc.).
testing two bit sizes: 77⁄8 in. and 81⁄2 in.
He said that the existing design (preJanuary 2007) cuts the majority of hole
and leaves less than 1⁄8-in. outer portion
of gauge that is removed with the PDC
cutters (Fig. 3).
The new design uses particle impact rather than PDC
cutters to cut all the way to
gauge. Although this creates
the potential for overgauging, he noted there is very
little downside. Fig. 4 shows
the bottomhole pattern
drilled by the PID bit in a
hole drilled to gauge.
The surface components
of the PID system include:
• Particle-injection system, between the mud pump
and standpipe.
• Particle processing

(separation) and containment unit (for
recycled steel particles).
The spherical steel particles are currently injected from a hopper with a
hydraulic frac pump truck, downstream
from the rig’s mud pumps (Fig. 5).

After circulating back uphole, the steel
shot is collected by a triple screen “shot
process kit” located before the shale
shakers. The kit is based on a SWECO
round-top separator, and the third
(final) screen is passed over a rotating
magnet to attract and capture
the steel particles.
PDTI Senior Vice-Pres.
Tommy Hardisty told OGJ
that PID functions with conventional mud systems, 1010.5 lb mud weight, 30-35
yield point, and 15-17 plastic
viscosity. Where a fluid losscontrol additive is necessary,
the PID system works best
with fine calcium.
The PID system and components are further described
by US Patents 6,386,300 B1
and 6,581,700 B2.

• In Utah, PDTI ran 12 full-scale
test programs on several versions of the
PID bit at TerraTek Inc., an independent

acquired by Schlumberger in July 2006.
TerraTek tested PID performance using
shot rates of 12, 14, and 16.5 gpm
and bit weights ranging from 5,000,
10,000, and 15,000 lb.
TerraTek ran the PID bits through the
Sierra White granite, Carthage marble,
Mancos shale, and Crab Orchard sandstone (June 2005).

Hardisty said that the PID system
drilled through a hard stringer at
Catoosa, well known as “the wall,” so
smoothly that the drillers did not discern the changes in lithology.
Following the Catoosa testing, PDTI
announced that it had retained Beeken

How does one compare the incomparable? Take the Pilatus PC-12. Like that holiest of grails, the
perfect mousetrap, a PC-12 has found a way to outperform today’s ubiquitous light jet in all the ways
that count. Such as going twice as far. Carrying twice as much. And doing it with a cabin twice the
size. But unlike many a perfected solution, you won’t pay a premium to get it. In fact, ownership of an
entire PC-12 costs less than a quarter share of most fractional jets, with operating costs running less
than half. Plus, with the freedom of total ownership, you take command of where you go, when you
go, and how fast you’d like to get there and back. Now that’s what we’d call a better mousetrap.

21 HRC at the OD following
expansion.
The difference in ID and
OD hardness is directly
proportional to the degree of
plastic strain or expansion.
For example, ID expansion
of 18% (7.310-in. preexpansion to 8.625-in. postexpansion) vs. an OD expansion of
15.5% (8.000-in. preexpansion to 9.240 in. postexpansion).
Mass is conserved during expansion. The liner wall
thickness thins only slightly,
while the length shrinks
about 4%. Burst and collapse
ratings are 5,000 psi and
1,200 psi, respectively.
Proper handling of the
casing and connections during every stage of manufacturing, inspection, and installation is critical to achieving
a successful expansion and is
therefore tightly controlled
by an internal service company specification.
After expansion, the monobore liner extension system is pulled from the test
well (Fig. 3).

Downhole recess shoe

An oversized casing shoe
was developed to be installed with
the parent casing string and provide a
downhole recess area for the expanded
pipe.
The shoe’s recess ID and location
profile enable the liner to be anchored
on the bottom of the parent casing
and then expanded into the shoe with
no ID size restriction below the parent
casing. This feature eliminates the ID
size restriction that is present in other
expandable liner systems that hang off
in the parent casing.
The recess shoe is available in two
versions: one that facilitates fluid and
cement circulation of the expanded
liner run below the recess shoe, and
one that does not. Both versions are
rated to 5,000 psi burst and 1,200 psi
collapse (Fig. 4).

52

Top-down expansion
Engineers developed a top-down,
hydraulic expansion system that relies
on drill pipe pressure to expand the
liner. The expansion method addresses
operator concerns about not being able
to retrieve the expansion cone from
expandable products if catastrophic loss
of expansion pressure occurs inside the
expanded casing.
The expansion assembly consists of
an anchor, hydraulic cylinder, and expansion cone. As pumping begins, slips
extend from the anchor and lock the
expansion assembly in place. Continued
application of pressure down the workstring extends the hydraulic cylinder
and moves the cone downhole in 14-ft
incremental stroke lengths. The design
does not rely on drill pipe set-down
weight or overpull, or on a dart sealing
process to assure pressure integrity during expansion.

Practical Drilling
Technology

Additionally, the method
does not apply expansion
pressure to the expandable
casing. The top-down expansion method enables integration of a retrieval collet onto
the bottom of the expansion
assembly, which makes it
possible to retrieve the guide
shoe and leave an open ID
through the entire length
of the liner when it is fully
expanded. Typical expansion
rates are about 100 ft (30
m)/hr.
With top-down expansion, shrinkage in liner
length occurs at the “free”
end of the system. In this
case, the 4% shrinkage in
expandable liner length will
cause a portion of the open
hole at target depth (TD) to
not be cased by the expandable system. To accommodate
the shrinkage, prejob planning addresses drilling rat
hole below the target zone.

In the FSU, as well as globally, the
requirements for motor gasoline are becoming more and more stringent.
New standards exclude the use of
lead; reduce levels of benzene, sulfur, unsaturated hydrocarbons, and
total aromatics; include limitations
on oxygenate content; reduce saturated vapor pressure; and control
fraction composition.
Such trends significantly affect the
methods refiners use to produce motor
fuels.

octane number of light gasoline cuts.
In combination with other processes it
also allows refiners to produce a gasoline with low benzene and sulfur content. Uncertainty about future regulations on the use of methyl tertiary butyl
ether necessitates use of isomerization
for producing gasoline.
Pentane and hexane isomerization
is widely implemented in FSU refineries because it has the advantage of
minimizing investment by using idle
reactors within catalytic reforming or
hydrotreating units.
Main advantages of isomerization
also include the availability of considerable feedstock resources, unlike alkylation and dimerization processes.

The Naftan refinery in Belarus, since
the end of 2001, has operated a combined unit converted from a catalytic reformer. The unit contains these sections:
hydrotreating the feed fraction (IBP-70º
C.); fractionation of the hydrotreated
fraction with extraction of isopentane;
once-through isomerization of the deisopentanized cut (Fig. 2).
In 2004, a 120,000 tonne/year
pentane-hexane isomerization unit
was put into service at the Khabarovsk
refinery. This unit is based on a technology similar to the one used at the
CEPSA Algeciras refinery in Spain. This
unit features isopentane withdrawal and
return of a nonreacted pentane cut to
the process.
A medium-temperature isomerization unit LSI-200 has been operating
at the Novokuibyshevsk refinery since

2004. The process licenser is NPP Neftekhim, Krasnodar, and the engineering company is Lengiproneftekhim, St.
Petersburg. The design is based on oncethrough process that uses a zeolitic
catalyst SI-2. While developing detailed
documentation, the plant management
decided to shift to a proven catalyst:
Hysopar T-4500 produced by Süd-Chemie.
The Isomalk-2 process (Fig. 3)
designed by NPP Neftekhim and using
a sulfated zircon catalyst SI-2 has been
successfully implemented at four refineries. The start-up of an isomerization
unit at the Linos refinery considerably
improves the ratio of high-octane and
low-octane gasolines produced there.
The share of AI-95 gasoline increased
to 40% from 24%, and AI-92 gasoline
to 45% from 35%, due to the reduced
output of motor gasoline AI-80 to 14%
from 40%.

In addition, analysis of isomerate
composition shows that the catalyst
SI-2 is considerably superior to zeolitic
catalysts (octane number is five points
higher) and is as efficient as chlorinated
catalysts. The isomerization level of
pentanes and hexanes is not reduced,
while the resistance to catalyst poisons
is much higher.
This low-temperature isomerization
process features technological advantages. The level of pentane isomerization
(Table 2) is quite high and within the
range of 69.1-73.7%; hexane isomerization is within 18.9-31.4%. A maximum RON increase of up to 14 points
was achieved.
An isoreforming unit has been operating at the Ufa refinery since 2003.
VNIINeftekhim developed the catalyst,
IMP-02. Main catalyst specifications
are: platinum content of 0.38 wt %;
bulk density about 0.7 g/cu cm; and an
extrudate diameter of 0.3-2.1 mm. Unit
capacity is 25 cu m/hr and isomerate
output is 98 wt %.
Process conditions have been optimized during operations by reducting
the of total hydrogen circulating gasfeedstock circulation ratio to 730-760
cu m/cu m and increasing temperature
upstream of the reactor to 260-270º C.
The feed quality was very low: It
contains only 22-26 wt % of n-pentanes and the end boiling point was
81-82º C. The isomerate was obtained
with a MON of 76.6 and the increase
accounted for 4.0-5.2 points only.
Improving the feed quality (fractional and hydrocarbon composition)
as well as process stabilization enabled
the operator to reach optimum performance of the zeolitic catalysts. Unit
operating parameters were: feedstock
fraction 28-70º C.; total content of C5s
was 60-65 vol % including n-C5 of
35-39 vol %; hydrogen partial pressure
was 2.1-2.2 MPa; circulation ratio was
550-650 cu m/cu m; feed space velocity was 2 hr–1; process temperature was
270º C.; and the hydrogen content in
circulating gas was 80 vol % minimum.
Isomerate MON is 78-79.

The detailed design was from Ukrneftekhimproject, Kiev, based on the license
from Axens. The unit (Table 2) operates
very efficiently: Isomerate octane number is 87.2-87.9. The process efficiency
is due to processing a feedstock with
low hexane content.
The low-temperature isomerization

process has some serious disadvantages
that prevent it from wide implementation at FSU refineries. Specifically:
• Stringent requirements on the
content of sulfur, nitrogen, water, benzene, C7+ hydrocarbons, and olefins in
the feedstock.
• Constant injection of chlor-organics to maintain the catalyst activity.
• A complex and labor-instensive

• Equipment corrosion.
A Penex-DIG unit with a capacity
of 120,000 tonnes/year of feedstock,
licensed by UOP, was commissioned in
September 2004 at the Odessa refinery
in Ukraine. The unit consists of two reactors loaded with catalyst I-8 and I-82
in the amount of 14.2 and 15.2 tonnes,
respectively. The first year of operation
had a high efficiency with a specified
octane of 88.0-89.2, an increase of up
to 12 points, and a high conversion of
n-pentane and hexane.
Construction of UOP low-temperature isomerization units (Penex-DIG)
will be commissioned at the Achinsk
and Volgograd refineries by 2008.
The light-naphtha isomerization
process ParIsom (Fig. 4) is becoming
popular among Russian oil companies;
the main feature of the process is the
catalyst LPI-100. The process features
certain important advantages over isomerization based on zeolitic and chlorinated catalysts, namely:
• There is no need for organic chemicals to be injected to maintain catalyst
activity, which allows the elimination of
alkaline washing and avoids problems
related to use and disposal of alkali.
• The higher activity of catalyst
LPI-100 (at 80º C.) vs. zeolitic catalysts,
which precludes the use of fire heating
and reduces required capital investments.
• Possible process operations using
high feed space velocities, which allows
a reduction in the volume of catalyst
and reactor size, a high isomerate output, and better octane characteristics.
• Low sensitivity of the catalyst to
contaminants such as sulfur and water,
which eliminates the need for feed
dryers.
• It is an environment friendly and
waste-free process.
Currently the process is implemented at the Nizhny Novgorod refinery
and construction of a process unit is
planned at the Yaroslavnefteorgsyntez
refinery.
The unit configuration is similar to
60

units operating with zeolitic catalysts.
This process is cost competitive and in
the future it will gain a leading role at
Russian refineries. ✦

Pipeline abandonment
must consider environmental remediation
beyond simple closure
or removal of the line in
question.
Pipelines
In August and September 1996, Canada’s National Energy Board heard and approved
the abandonment of the entirety of
Yukon Pipelines Ltd. (YPL), the first and
(to date) only large-scale abandonment
of an NEB-regulated pipeline. Although
the NEB wrote its YPL leave-to-abandon
order in 1996, and the majority of the
pipeline and related infrastructure were
removed soon after, the abandonment is
still ongoing.
The leave-to-abandon order will not
come into force until YPL demonstrates,
to the satisfaction of the Board and in
consideration of comments from other
stakeholders, that soil and groundwater
contamination associated with the pipeline has been successfully remediated.
This article provides an overview of
the Board’s regulatory requirements and
responsibilities with respect to pipeline
abandonment, typical environmental
issues associated with pipeline abandonment, and types and examples of
pipeline abandonments addressed by
the Board to date. Subsequent parts will
present a more detailed examination
of the YPL pipeline abandonment and
associated remediation activity, including a discussion of some of the technical and regulatory challenges associated
with the project.

NEB Act, “A company shall not, without
the leave of the Board, ...abandon the
operation of a pipeline.” A company,
therefore, must apply for and receive
a “leave-to-abandon” order from the
Board before it can abandon operation
of its pipeline facilities.
When this order comes into force,
the company’s authorization to operate the pipeline (granted under section
52 or 58 of the NEB Act) is
canceled. Consequently, the
subject pipeline facilities cease
to meet the definition of a
pipeline under section 2 of
the NEB Act and NEB jurisdiction is terminated.
Sections 19 and 24 of the
NEB Act also have important implications with respect to pipeline abandonment. Nothing in the NEB Act grants
the Board authority to impose conditions upon a leave-to-abandon order.
Subsection 19(1), however, permits the
Board to direct that an order shall come
into force at a future time or upon
satisfaction of conditions imposed by
the Board. Section 24 prescribes that
any hearing with respect to pipeline
abandonment must be public (a public
hearing may be either oral or written).
In addition to considering environmental issues in the context of the
Canadian public interest in making a
decision under paragraph 74(1)(d)
of the NEB Act, the Board must first
perform an environmental assessment
of the pipeline abandonment under
sections 5 and 11 of the CEA Act. Typically, the environmental assessment for

end users).3-5 These amendments would
provide regulatory clarity for projects
such as diversion, replacement, or
discontinued use of an old pipeline segment where a new or existing segment
of pipeline would continue to provide
the same service.
Companies currently apply to undertake such projects under Section 52, 58,
or 74 of the NEB Act, none of which
adequately accommodate these applications.3 The revised regulations would
ensure that applications to decommission a pipeline receive examination and
regulatory oversight of technical and
environmental issues similar to those
for abandonment, but without requiring the regulatory process necessary to
address the effects of abandonment on
end users.

Environmental effects
Pipeline abandonment can involve
removal of the pipeline or abandonment in place, each with characteristic

environmental effects discussed in detail
in the Pipeline Abandonment Steering
Committee’s 1996 discussion paper on
pipeline abandonment technical and
environmental issues.2
Pipeline abandonment by removal
may be desirable when abandoning the
pipeline in place could obstruct future
land use or development, or result in a
safety hazard. Pipeline abandonment in
place may be desirable in areas sensitive to land disturbance such as environmentally sensitive areas, unstable or
highly erodible areas, or crossings with
water bodies, roads, railways or other
pipelines. Large-scale pipeline abandonments typically use a combination
of both options, with some segments
abandoned in place and others removed
depending on site-specific requirements.
Environmental effects of pipeline
removal are similar to those of pipeline
construction. Typical considerations
include access, protection of cultural

features and environmentally sensitive
areas, topsoil conservation, erosion
prevention, vegetation management,
contingency planning, surface reclamation, and post-construction monitoring.
Abandonment in place still entails
some ground disturbance, with similar
environmental considerations but on a
smaller scale. Whichever abandonment
option an operator chooses, attention
should be given to additional issues
of ground subsidence, drainage, and
contamination of soil, groundwater, and
surface water.
Regulations state that where pipelines are abandoned in place “ground
subsidence would be negligible for
pipelines up to 323.9 mm in diameter,”
but should be assessed on a site-specific
basis for larger pipelines.2 The settling
of soil disturbed by pipeline removal
may also cause subsidence. Ground
subsidence may channel surface runoff,
resulting in topsoil loss, erosion, and
siltation of water bodies.

on the abandonment itself (per paragraph 74(1)(d) of the NEB Act).10 11
In November 1997, once satisfied
that Manito had met all the conditions
of leave-to-abandon, including remediation of contamination attributed to
operation of the pipeline, the Board
declared the abandonment complete.12
This case set the stage for the YPL abandonment.
Following the YPL abandonment,
cases considered by the Board have
dealt primarily with projects that would
be considered decommissionings under
proposed OPR-99 revisions. For example, in 2002-03, TNPI applied under
paragraph 74(1)(d) of the NEB Act to
replace or re-route several pipeline segments as part of larger facilities construction applications. The Board noted
that there would be no discontinuance
of service as a result of these activities
and decided that the activities could
thus be addressed under section 52 of
the NEB Act in conjunction with the
overall construction activities for which
TNPI had applied.
Abandonment, however, still guided
consideration of issues pertaining to
the environment and the termination of
NEB jurisdiction. Environmental issues
considered included historical soil and
groundwater contamination and potential corrosion-created water conduits,
which would then leach pipe materials
into the groundwater. The NEB ordered
TNPI to remediate any detected contamination to meet both federal and
provincial guidelines.13-16
By contrast, in 2004, the Board issued Enbridge Pipelines Inc. an abandonment order (XO-E101-22-2004)
pursuant to paragraph 74(1)(d) of the
NEB Act for an old line segment that
Enbridge was going to remove with
no change in service. No hearing was
conducted. Similar to the 1993 TNPI orders, leave-to-abandon came into force
without delay and conditions were
attached to the abandonment itself. Environmental issues considered included
possible historical soil and groundwater
contamination, potential naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORMs),

topsoil conservation, and reclamation of
disturbed areas.
The NEB ordered Enbridge to report
any contamination encountered and
how it would be remediated. Contamination was not defined in terms of
provincial or federal guidelines.17
The proposed decommissioning
revisions to OPR-99 would provide
greater regulatory clarity and consistency regarding cases such as these.

Energy bill tries
to annul question
on royalty relief
The energy bill passed by the House
Jan. 18 tries to annul a question at the core
of the year-long, price-threshold controversy about deepwater royalty relief.
Section 203 of the Clean Energy Act of
2007 “reafﬁrms” authority of the secretary
of the interior to limit royalty relief when oil
and gas prices are high.
But in the Deepwater Royalty Relief Act
of 1995, Congress appears to have said

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

something quite different for deepwater
Gulf of Mexico leases awarded in the 5
years following Nov. 28, 1995.
The prevalent assumption in the controversy is that the Department of the Interior’s Minerals Management Service failed to
insert price thresholds in deepwater leases
granted in 1998 and 1999.
But a close reading of the 1995 legislation makes you wonder if it was those
years that MMS got right.
The act’s discussion of price thresholds
stipulates leases in existence and producing on Nov. 28, 1995, and determined by
Interior to deserve relief. For nonproducing deepwater leases and those awarded
during the next 5 years, the law mandates
royalty relief and says nothing about price
thresholds. And for those leases, the law
sets volumetric limits to relief in a section
presented as an exception to the clause—
the one that the new House bill would
reafﬁrm—authorizing the interior secretary
to suspend royalties and condition suspensions on price levels.
Instead of price thresholds supposedly
missing in 1998 and 1999, the controversy
might more appropriately focus on whether
MMS should have included thresholds in
leases awarded in 1996, 1997, and 2000.
The possibility that this is so has produced
lawsuits.
What’s interesting in all this is how little
attention has befallen the issue of MMS’s
authority to include price thresholds in
deepwater leases issued during 1995-2000.
Political opportunity oozes from a controversy involving money that oil companies didn’t pay the government. That they
had no legal commitment to pay anything
easily can be ignored.
But where’s the political opportunity
in money that oil companies did pay that
maybe never should have been collected?
It’s a most inconvenient question, which
the House bill, if enacted, quietly will
eliminate.

Cold boosts crude price above $59/bbl
The March contract for benchmark US crude closed above $59/bbl on the New
York market for the ﬁrst time in 2007 on Feb. 2 on the strength of forecasts that a
severe cold front would hike heating demand 36% above normal in the Northeastern
US, the largest heating oil market.
Energy markets ended January with a bang as the same crude contract closed
at $58.14/bbl Jan. 31. However, it retreated to $57.30/bbl Feb. 1, ending a 2-day rally,
because of a smaller-than-expected withdrawal of natural gas from US underground
storage. The Energy Information Administration reported the withdrawal of 186 bcf
of gas in the week ended Jan. 26. That was below the consensus of Wall Street analysts and compared with withdrawals of 179 bcf the previous week and 88 bcf in the
same period last year. Gas storage totaled 2.6 tcf, 152 bcf more than a year ago and
454 bcf above the 5-year average.
The March crude contract closed at $59.02/bbl after trading at $57.05-59.25/bbl
Feb. 2, as colder weather and increased demand reminded traders that members
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had agreed to cut production
by 500,000 b/d to an ofﬁcial ceiling of 25.8 million b/d effective Feb. 1. While compliance with OPEC’s October pledge to cut production by 1.2 million b/d in December
remains spotty, Saudi Arabia’s commitment to reduce its output by 158,000 b/d this
month helped boost crude prices.
The crude contract “rallied back to ﬁnish the week $3.60/bbl higher for the second
week in a row,” said Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland. “We are
now back to the fourth-quarter 2006 value range, and while we remain positive on
the medium term direction, we will take a more conservative and neutral approach
short term until we get more data conﬁrmation that could justify the continuation of
the rally.”
Other market factors
At Banc of America Securities LLC, New York, analyst Robert S. Morris reported,
“Strong US economic data provided a further boost to oil prices with the expectation that a faster growing economy would ultimately spur greater crude oil and
gasoline demand. Finally, tensions between Iran and the West continued to escalate
as Tehran announced that it would hook up 3,000 centrifuges this month to begin
large-scale uranium enrichment despite threats from the UN Security Council that
it would impose further sanctions later this month if Iran did not roll back its enrichment program.”
Meanwhile, oil unions in Nigeria threatened to strike because of escalating
violence in that country’s most proliﬁc producing area. “Leaders of Nigeria’s top oil
unions said a withdrawal of staff from the Niger Delta remains a possibility,” said
analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc. on Feb. 5, the
original target date for the strike.
“Violence in the Niger Delta has increased over the last 12 months with over 200
people being kidnapped. Recently, an attack by local militants forced Royal Dutch
Shell PLC to halt 477,000 b/d, almost a quarter of the nation’s production,” the analysts said. A total withdrawal of workers would force crude production from the delta
region, they said, “to come to a screeching halt.”
In other news, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez threatened to seize control of
at least 60% of four heavy-crude joint ventures in the eastern Orinoco Belt by May 1.
Those projects produce 600,000 b/d.
The March natural gas contract lost 5.4¢ to $7.48/MMbtu Feb. 2 on NYMEX. On
the US spot market, however, natural gas at Henry Hub, La., jumped 32.5¢ to $8.16
MMbtu. “Composite spot natural gas prices surged more than 11% last week with
the extended outlook for continued colder-than-normal temperatures,” said Morris
of Banc of America Securities. “In fact, a roughly 30% surge in this natural gas price
index since mid-January can be largely attributed to a sharp reversal in the weather
outlook.”
EIA said distillate fuel inventories fell 2.6 million bbl to 140 million bbl the week
ended Jan. 26, with a drop in heating oil offsetting a rise in diesel. That was the ﬁrst
decline in distillate inventory in 7 weeks. US crude inventories increased for a third
week, up 2.5 million bbl to 324.9 million bbl. Gasoline stocks jumped by 3.8 million
bbl to 224.6 million bbl in the same period. “The gasoline stock build was higher
than expected due to high imports, but the gasoline demand was very robust while
the cold weather started to draw down heating oil stocks in the Northeast,” Jakob of
Petromatrix said.

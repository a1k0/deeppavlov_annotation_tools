COVER
The first article in the special report on Independent Operations,
starting on p. 24, highlights strategies for overcoming obstacles
involved in developing the Marcellus shale, one of the largest new
onshore gas plays in the US. On the cover is the Patterson No. 163
rig, which is drilling Range Resources Corp.’s 29th horizontal shale
well in the rolling hills of Pennsylvania. Range expects at yearend
to be producing 30 MMcfd of gas equivalent from its Marcellus
shale acreage. A second article, on p. 28, examines stock sale trends
by some independents during a time of intense market fluctuations.

API: Industry will work with new president
The US oil and gas industry is looking forward to working with
President-elect Barack Obama and a new Congress “to get to work
on meaningful energy policy that contributes to economic stability,” according to Jack Gerard, American Petroleum Institute president and chief executive officer.
“The American people have spoken loud and clear that they
want politicians to put aside partisan bickering,” Gerard said in a
Nov. 5 news release. “The oil and natural gas industry stands ready
to help put America’s vast energy resources to good use, strengthening our nation’s economy and energy security, and providing
good jobs for Americans across the country,” he added.
Gerard said the industry stands ready to help the new administration deliver “a comprehensive and realistic energy policy that
encourages development of all domestic energy sources, including
oil and natural gas, for the benefit of consumers.”

Iraqi deputy oil minister escapes attempt on life
Iraq’s Deputy Oil Minister Saheb Salman Al-Qutub was wounded in a bomb attack outside his home in the northern Ataifiyah
neighborhood of Baghdad.
“The senior deputy oil minister Abdul Saheb Al-Qutub escaped
an assassination attempt by improvised explosive device close to
his house on Nov. 3,” the oil ministry said.
“The deputy minister left the hospital after he received the required treatment,” the ministry said, adding that Al-Qutub suffered
slight wounds and his driver was severely hurt.
Al-Qutub, a Shiite from the southern province of Basra, also
survived an assassination attempt in 2004 along the highway between Baghdad and Hilla, south of Baghdad. He was an adviser to
the oil minister at the time.
Al-Qutub was appointed to his position last year when the former deputy oil minister, Abdul Jabar Al-Wagaa, a Sunni, decided

Exploration

&

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

to retire after being kidnapped along with four other ministry officials. Al-Wagaa was released a few weeks later.
The latest attempted assassination on Al-Qutub coincided with
reports that Iraq’s crude oil exports in October rose 3.6% to 1.703
million b/d from 1.644 million b/d.
Iraq exported 1.385 million b/d from the Basra oil terminal,
while some 309,000 b/d were exported via pipeline to Turkey’s
Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. The remaining 9,000 b/d were
trucked to neighboring Jordan.

NEB: Economic uncertainty dominates outlook
Canada has sufficient oil and natural gas supplies to meet winter demand, although price volatility is likely, the National Energy
Board said.
“Markets here cannot help but be affected by the current volatility of world commodity markets,” NEB Chair Gaetan Caron said
Oct. 30 in his agency’s winter energy outlook.
Fuel prices have declined on a combination of factors, including
a deepening global financial crisis, falling demand, and a worsening US and global economic outlook.
NEB forecast that crude oil could average $50-75/bbl this winter on the New York Mercantile Exchange, where natural gas could
average $6-9/MMbtu.
Heating oil prices are expected to track crude oil prices, which means
average Canadian heating oil prices probably will be lower than last year.
Strong US natural gas production has helped to keep gas prices
low while helping to ensure adequate gas supply.
Canadian drilling activity has stabilized but remains down from
its 2005-06 winter peak, NEB said.
“Relative to the previous winter, Canadian production is expected to continue trending downward,” given slowing gas drilling combined with declines in initial productivity of new wells,
NEB said. ✦

Development

Apache’s Egyptian discovery tests 4,746 b/d
Apache Corp. said its WKAL-C-1X discovery in Egypt’s Western
Desert flowed on test at a rate of 4,746 b/d of oil and 4.4 MMcfd
of gas.
“The WKAL-C-1X discovery represents the westernmost oil ever
discovered in Egypt and confirms our exploration model for this
area of the Faghur basin,” said G. Steven Farris, Apache president
and chief executive officer.
The West Kalabsha concession involves the Jurassic Safa formation in Faghur basin, 50 miles east of the Libyan border (OGJ Online, Aug. 11, 2008).
The well, drilled to 14,600 ft TD, logged 46 ft of Safa oil pay. It

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

also logged 36 ft of pay in the Alem El Bueib 3C formation. Wireline pressure data suggests the water level may be at least 190 ft
below the base of the oil sand, Apache said.

Shell, ADNOC sign MOU for gas exploration
Royal Dutch Shell PLC will partner with Abu Dhabi National Oil Co.
to carry out possible deep offshore gas exploration in the country.
The companies have signed a memorandum of understanding,
and Shell plans to sign final agreements to quickly begin joint exploration and development activities.
Last year Shell’s production in Abu Dhabi averaged 146,000
boe/d.

That’s how many estimated oil
wells were completed in the U.S. during the
third quarter of 2008, up 34 percent from last
year’s third quarter and the highest estimated
third quarter oil activity since 1986. Had you
subscribed to API’s 2008 Quarterly Well
Completion Report you’d have seen the trend,
so your E&P report to Mr. Big would have
made a big impression. Isn’t it time you got

Jordan freezes oil shale proposals for 18 months
Jordan has stopped all oil shale activities in central Jordan for 18
months to enable the government to explore for uranium.
The Natural Resources Authority (NRA) posted a statement on
its web site announcing such a decision of the Council of Ministers.
The central Jordan area includes the Attarat Um Ghudran region,
which is 34 km east of Qatrana, and the Wadi Maghar region, 40
km southeast of Qatrana.
Royal Dutch Shell PLC is negotiating. Shell is interested in evaluating an area that extends from northern Jordan and West Safawi to
Azraq in the middle and Sirhan and al-Jafer in the south.
A Shell spokesman said Shell is working with the government
of Jordan under an existing, long-term relationship, and Shell envisions that its activities will be unaffected by this announcement.
Jordan depends on imported oil and refined products to meet
all its energy requirements. Oil shale is the only important indigenous source of energy in Jordan, a government document said.
The Jordanian government estimates that Jordan holds more
than 50 billion tonnes of oil shale resources.

Total plans downhole sulfur removal demonstration
Total SA intends to use the downhole sulfur removal (DSR)
technology, which it developed with Austin-based CrystaTech, on
sour gas fields in the Middle East and in the Caspian Sea area, Total
spokesman Kevin Church told OGJ. A decision has already been taken to move to the pilot unit demonstration phase of the project.
Total signed a technology development and commercialization
agreement with CrystaTech, a clean-energy technology development company, to develop a recycling process for the continuous
removal and recovery of sulfur deposits in sour gas well bores.
CrystaTech is modifying its patented CrystalSulf hydrogen sulfide
removal process to develop the new technology for this downhole
application.
DSR technology makes the sulfur soluble by continuously injecting a liquid hydrocarbon into the production well bores. It is
a nonspecified refinery product that absorbs and carries the sulfur
out of the well bore through a state-of-the-art recycling and regeneration process.
Total plans to use the technology in the production of large
sour gas reserves in the Middle East and the Caspian Sea. Existing
technologies, points out the company, require producers to either
shut in gas production while injecting disposable solvents to clear
blocked well bores, continuously inject nonrecyclable solvents, or
use chemical regeneration processes. ✦

Baku-Supsa line reopens, BTC ships Kazakh oil
BP PLC said the Chevron-led TengizChevrOil (TCO) consortium
has begun transporting crude oil through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
pipeline and that the Baku-Supsa pipeline has reopened after being
closed during recent hostilities between Russia and Georgia.
“As of today the Baku-Supsa pipeline has started working again
and we will gradually raise the amount of oil pumped through
it to the optimal level,” said BP Azerbaijan spokesperson Tamam
Bayatly Nov. 5.
The State Oil Co. of the Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) said the
Baku-Supsa pipeline, which has a benchmark capacity of 145,000
b/d, will carry 90,000 b/d after reopening and likely will remain
at that level until yearend.
The line was closed down as a safety measure in August during
Georgia’s 5-day war with neighboring Russia. At the time, the Baku-Supsa line had been open only a week after returning to service
following an 18-month closure for maintenance and repairs.
BP Azerbaijan also said shipments of TCO oil are now under
way through the BP-led BTC pipeline. Shipments of TCO crude
began in late October, the firm said, without detailing the amounts
or dates of shipments.
The oil from Kazakhstan’s Tengiz field is shipped by tankers across
the Caspian Sea to the Apsherob Peninsula in Azerbaijan and then
loaded into the BTC line, the BP Azerbaijan spokesperson said.
According to SOCAR officials, the BTC line could eventually
transport as much as 100,000 b/d of Kazakh oil.

Origin, ConocoPhillips ﬁnalize CSM-fed LNG venture
Origin Energy Ltd., Sydney, has finalized its deal with ConocoPhillips to form a coalseam methane (CSM)-supplied LNG joint
venture to be called Australia Pacific LNG. ConocoPhillips has submitted an upfront payment of $5 billion.
The proposal is to develop Origin’s CSM resources in the Surat
and Bowen basins in Queensland to supply a proposed 14 million
tonnes/year LNG plant at Gladstone on the central east coast of
Queensland.
First investment decision for Train 1 is due by the end of 2010,
and first LNG production is scheduled for 2014.
Through the JV, Origin will become the largest CSM-LNG producer in Australia.
Origin says Australia Pacific LNG brings together Origin’s 10
and ConocoPhillips’ 25 years of CSM experience. Through ConocoPhillips, the new JV has access to 40 years of experience in operating and developing LNG facilities.

PNG names LNG project share nominee
After several months deliberation, Papua New Guinea has put
forward Independent Public Business Corp. (IPBC) as the state’s
nominee to manage the government’s 19.4% stake in the $11 billion ExxonMobil Corp.-led Papua New Guinea LNG project.
12

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

IPBC was competing with fellow state-owned Petromin for the
position.
Prime Minister Michael Somare said the government’s ministerial economic committee and the National Executive Council had
noted IPBC’s progress to secure financing for the state’s equity in
the project without any sell-down of the government’s stake.
In other words, he said, the state won’t go into debt to finance
its equity and won’t need to provide state guarantees.
The equity funding arrangements are expected to be announced
in the PNG Parliament in mid-November.
Somare added that the government is pleased with the manner
in which ExxonMobil and its coventurers are driving the project,
particularly in the uncertain global financial market climate.
He said the time is ripe for development of PNG’s gas resources
in view of the growing role of gas as a fuel of choice in global efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and global warming.
IPBC also manages the government’s 17.56% interest in Oil
Search Ltd.

Centrica secures LNG cargo from Qatar
Centrica PLC will import its first cargo of LNG from Qatar later
this month to commission the second expansion phase of the Isle
of Grain LNG terminal in Kent.
The cargo from RasGas Co. Ltd. will be the UK’s largest ever
LNG delivery, according to Centrica, and is a crucial step in helping the country address its dwindling indigenous supplies from
the North Sea.
National Grid PLC owns the terminal, and Centrica has the rights
to import 3.4 billion cu m/year of gas for the next 20 years.
“RasGas will use one of the new generation of high capacity Q-Flex
super-tankers, the Al Khuwair. It is among the world’s largest LNG carriers and the largest gas vessel to call at a British port,” Centrica said.
The tanker will deliver up to 50 million therms of gas, which
represents about 35% of total UK demand on an average winter day.
The company’s chief executive, Sam Laidlaw, is in Qatar on
a trade delegation visit with the British Prime Minister Gordon
Brown and other British CEOs.
Sam Laidlaw, chief executive of Centrica, said: “Our capacity
at Isle of Grain is just one of many strategic investments Centrica
is making in new gas and power assets to secure the UK’s future
energy needs.”
LNG, increasingly important for the UK, is expected to make up
28% of the UK’s total supply by 2017, according to National Grid’s
2008 forecast. This year the UK will import 40% of its gas demand,
rising to 75% by 2015.
Under a 19-year contract, Centrica also has the rights to an additional 2.4 billion cu m/year of gas due to be available in 2010-11
in the third phase of the Isle of Grain expansion. This will mean that
almost 30% of the terminal’s total capacity will be available to supply
British Gas customers from that time and, overall, the Isle of Grain will
then be capable of supplying 20% of the UK’s annual demand. ✦

Unwarranted hostility
The editorial “An unprecedented
rebuke” (O&GJ, 10/13/08) might
better have been titled “Unwarranted
hostility” (OGJ, Oct. 13, 2008, p. 20). A
major dilemma facing the US petroleum
industry and especially international oil
companies is that of being taken to task
by the US government for doing what
the industry is supposed to do: that is, to
find and produce energy for the nation
at the lowest practicable cost. This is a
formidable challenge recognizing that
new petroleum reserves are becoming
increasingly hard to find and expensive
to produce.
Add to this the fact that the government-owned national oil companies
(NOCs) control over 70% the world’s
oil reserves and are using their growing
wealth to invest in energy-related activities outside of their national borders. The
long-term implications of this growing
NOC presence in the international oil
arena are not clear, but almost certainly
it will impact energy security and stability of oil markets. For example, developing competition from NOCs involves
governments where traditional economic constraints may be less of a consideration than in the private sector. This
poses new, potentially costly challenges
for international oil companies.
There is insufficient understanding
and appreciation in US government
circles of what the petroleum industry
does year after year in helping to assure
the nation of adequate energy supplies.
This governmental insensitivity simply
feeds public hostility and makes it more
difficult for the industry to get on with
its job. Understand, this is by no means
an appeal to government to coddle the
industry. However, government should
avoid selectively imposing harsh new
taxes and restrictions on an industry that
faces extraordinary challenges in finding
new petroleum reserves in increasingly
hostile natural environments and in
competition with other foreign-based
international oil companies and wellfinanced NOCs.
In short, American oil companies are
involved in fierce worldwide competition to secure energy supplies to meet
our nation’s needs. Government should
take care not to hobble our country’s
team.

That’s just one way our intelligent
KeyView-enabled rigs help reduce
the cost of wellsite interventions.
The KeyView System provides
decision quality information using
sensors that monitor operational
parameters and rig-operator
activities. Built-in safety features
like crown-out/ﬂoor-out prevention
and high hook load limiter trigger
the system to intervene before
costly accidents and errors occur.
The result: dependable procedures
and reliable data that lead to jobs
done better, faster.
To ﬁnd out how improved safety
can help reduce your costs, visit
keyviewsystem.com
______________ or contact
your Key representative.

Numbers are based on
Key rigs equipped with
KeyView versus Key
rigs without KeyView.

KeyView-enabled rigs can
signiﬁcantly improve job quality
compared to rigs without the
integrated KeyView System.
On conventional service rigs, for
example, rod makeup operations
depend upon the skill level and
discretion of rig operators. But
the KeyView System monitors
and records torque data while
alerting the operator if best
practices are not being followed.
And better connection makeup
means less pin failure and longer
service life, which will ultimately
mean less intervention frequency
and a lower overall cost of
wellsite intervention.
To ﬁnd out how improved quality
can help reduce your costs, visit
keyviewsystem.com or contact
your Key representative.

$500 million. That’s how much
oil and gas producers were billed
for costs associated with “ﬂat-time”
in 2006 alone. Analysis of rig crew
and equipment activity collected
by KeyView-enabled rigs help
identify the root causes for idling
service equipment. And knowing
what problems to solve is the ﬁrst
step in reducing costs.
To ﬁnd out how improved efﬁciency
can help reduce your costs, visit

Producing energy from smoke

Sam Fletcher
Senior Editor
Congratulations to President-elect
Barack Obama for his unsurprising victory after an unusually long and unusually bitter campaign. Many campaigners
and analysts kept promising energy
would be a major election issue, but
the closest the candidates came to a real
energy debate were the clouds of smoke
each generated.
Both pledged to work for energy
independence, an objective that those in
the energy business know is not possible
in 10-20 years and is perhaps not even
desirable. Would US voters pay more for
homegrown energy if cheaper foreign
supplies were available? Not likely.
Back in the 1950s when independent producers and governors of oilproducing states testified that increased
imports of Middle East oil eventually
would result in energy dependence,
Congress’ response was: “You just don’t
want the public to have access to all this
cheap oil.”
Irwin Stelzer, director of Hudson
Institute’s Economic Policy Studies,
said the US will remain dependent for
transportation purposes on imported oil
from unfriendly nations for the foreseeable future—“whether or not we decide
to drill at home.” He said, “For both
transportation and other energy needs,
neither nuclear nor alternative fuels can
be developed quickly enough—even
if politics and environmental concerns
were not an issue.”

From its initial discovery, this continent has prospered primarily because
of its vast resources. We had so much
crude we once were a major exporter,
supplying the “sea of oil” that carried
us and our allies to victories in World
War I and World War II. Problem is,
US citizens long ago became so used
to cheap fuel that most now consider
it their birthright. If that fuel is now
more expensive, it can’t be the result of
diminished resources, or rising production and processing costs, or a faltering
economy, or poor government policies.
No, it must be a conspiracy of some
sort.

lem would be resolved when ethanol
competes.
According to Frank Maisano, a proenergy Washington, DC-based public
relations specialist, the only energy
issue being pushed by the John McCain camp just days before the election
was a charge that Obama’s climate plan
would put into place an economic cap
so tough that it would “bankrupt” any
coal-plant builder. That was picked up
by the Congress of Racial Equality, who
called vainly on the Congressional Black
Caucus to disavow support for such
policies.

Dollars and politics
The US oil and gas industry, politically unpopular and publicly misunderstood, spent its political money on a losing cause in this year’s general
election. Campaign contributions associated with
the industry favored Republicans. At the national
level, the other party won.
For the oil and gas business, political weather is
never calm. Since the gasoline price leaps that followed Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, it has
been persistently stormy. Once Democrats, always
cranky toward oil and gas, settle into new and
newly fortified seats of power and notice where
the industry spent its political money in the elections of 2008, things can only get worse.

Industry giving
According to the Center for Responsive Politics
(CRP), which uses data from the Federal Election
Commission, oil and gas giving in the 2007-08
election cycle as of Oct. 19 totaled slightly more
than $26 million. That total ranked 16th on the
CRP’s list of “top industries.” The number represents contributions by political action committees
(PACs) and individuals giving at least $200. Of the
total, $18.3 million came from individuals and
$7.8 million from PACs.
The oil and gas industry’s giving fell well below levels by the CRP’s top five “industry” donor
categories: retired, $204 million; lawyers and law
firms, $181 million; securities and investments,
$123 million; real estate, $105 million; and health
professionals, $70 million. Other “industries” contributing more than oil and gas, in descending order, were candidate committees, business services,
insurance, education, TV-movies-music, Democratic-liberal, leadership PACs (set up by politicians to
contribute to other candidates’ campaigns), commercial banks, computers-internet, and lobbyists.
The oil and gas category was the only industry
among the top 20 with a giving pattern characterized by the CRP as “strongly Republican.” Republicans received 76% of the donations associated
with oil and gas. In fact, the industry was one of
only three in the top 20 giving more heavily to
Republican than to Democratic election efforts.
Seventeenth-ranked general contractors and 19thranked “miscellaneous manufacturing and distributing” both earned “leans Republican” descrip22

tions from CRP. All other industries in the top 20
were “on the fence” or tilted to varying degrees
toward Democrats.
Oil and gas industry donations strongly favored
the losing presidential candidate. The campaign
of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) received slightly
more than $2 million from industry PACs and
individuals. The campaign of president-elect, Sen.
Barack Obama (D-Ill.), received $523,000. The oil
and gas business ranked 12th on the CRP’s list of
industries supporting McCain. It wasn’t among the
top 20 industries supporting Obama.
The heaviest spending by oil and gas industry
donors in congressional races produced mixed
results. Twelve of the top 20 senators or senatorial candidates in receipts of oil and gas donations
won their elections or were leading in close races
at this writing. The top-20 list includes three senators who weren’t seeking reelection: Democrat
Hillary Clinton of New York, who unsuccessfully
sought her party’s presidential nomination, as well
as Republicans Pete Domenici of New Mexico and
Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas. The top 20 list also
includes both of the candidates in a single race:
incumbent Louisiana Democrat Mary L. Landrieu,
who ranked sixth and won, and Republican John
Neely Kennedy, No. 11, who lost. The leading senatorial recipient of oil and gas contributions was
Republican incumbent John Cornyn of Texas, who
in a ranking of all leading recipients of oil and gas
industry donations was No. 3 behind McCain and
former presidential hopeful and New York Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani. He won.

Scattered victories
All the top 20 House candidates in receipts from
oil and gas donors, 14 Republicans and 6 Democrats, won or were the apparent winners of their
elections. All but incumbent Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) are
from producing states, mainly Texas and Oklahoma.
Scattered victories in Congress will provide
little comfort amid the Democratic political
tempest soon to batter the “strongly” Republicanleaning oil and gas industry. The experience will
raise useful questions about campaign contributions. In the election cycle just ended, oil and gas
political donors probably have bought a $26-million bull’s-eye. ✦

The Marcellus shale, which extends
575 miles across parts of three eastern
US states, is thought to hold as much
as 500 tcf of natural gas, about 50 tcf
of which is considered recoverable. The
area is bringing producers, landowners,
and state and local officials to address
water use and other questions.
The Marcellus shale deep-gas formation also is bringing the oil and gas
industry
into parts
of Pennsylvania,
New
York, and
West Virginia for
the first time. Producers have responded
with aggressive outreach efforts.
“We have been meeting with individual groups about the Marcellus
play for some time,” said Charlie Burd,
executive director of the Independent
Oil & Gas Association of West Virginia
(IOGA of WV) in Charleston. “We have
been to several places in eastern West
Virginia where this development will
take place because it lies in a formation
that hasn’t been produced and a part of
the state that hasn’t had a lot of oil and

familiar with the process of exploring
and producing natural gas and oil.”
State regulators also have responded.
“We have experienced here in Pennsylvania what may be a relatively
unprecedented land rush,” said J. Scott
Roberts, deputy for mineral resources
management in Pennsylvania’s Department of Environmental Protection.
“There are now several million acres of
private land which have been leased for
Marcellus shale development, including 78,000 acres of state forest land
where bids were put out in September,”
Roberts said.
“Pennsylvania’s traditional oil and
gas production has been in the western
quarter of the state,” Roberts told OGJ
during an Oct. 28 telephone interview.
“The Marcellus exists in sort of an arc,
starting in the same portions to the
south but extending north and east, including all of our northern tier counties
to the Delaware River. Those counties
haven’t seen any oil and gas production because the opportunities haven’t
existed,” he said.

Marcellus shale committee
The state’s two main industry associations—the Pennsylvania Oil & Gas
Association (POGAM) and the Independent Oil & Gas Association of Pennsylvania (IOGA of PA)—announced the
formation of a joint Marcellus shale
committee on Oct. 15. The associations said the committee will represent
Pennsylvania producers on matters
connected with acquisition, exploration, drilling, and development of the
Marcellus shale gas resource. It also will
help present a unified voice before state,
county, and local governments and
regulators, they said.
“We’re focused on Pennsylvania,
which has had an active oil and gas
industry for 150 years. But the industry
has been relatively small, focusing on
smaller producing wells, and has flown
under the radar,” said Richard D. Weber,
one of the committee’s cochairman
and president of Atlas Energy Resources
LLC in Moon Township near Pittsburgh.

more attention to it,” Weber noted, adding, “It potentially could be one of the
larger US natural gas fields, and it has
caught the attention of our legislators,
regulators, and governor.”
Weber told OGJ in an Oct. 30 telephone interview that POGAM and IOGA
of PA recognized that several changes
had been proposed for regulating oil
and gas industry activities in Pennsylvania “and we felt we needed to come
together on issues related to the Marcellus shale,” he said, adding, “We invited
some newer companies to Pennsylvania
to join us. There are about 26 companies participating. The committee tries
to provide a unified voice on regulatory
issues and best practices.”
A separate, Appalachian shale water
conservation and management committee has existed for about 6 months to
address technical issues. It was formed
last spring by about half a dozen
Marcellus shale producers, which have
been active in the Barnett shale formation near Fort Worth, Tex., according to
Tom Hayes, its managing director and
a senior engineer at the Gas Technology Institute in Des Plaines, Ill. There
are about 20 members now who are
working to develop best management
practices and technical solutions for Appalachian shale gas development, Hayes
said in an Oct. 23 telephone interview.

whether there’s a major difference from

they’re estimating the same water use

“The companies have worked
together to bring a lineup of service
companies, key equipment vendors,
engineers, and regulatory organizations

possible solutions to what lies before
us,” Hayes told OGJ. “They have made

six public meetings from Nov. 6 to Dec.
4 on its proposal. “This is just the first
step in what will be a careful process
designed to look at environmental
issues unique to the high-volume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells in
these deep rock layers,” DEC Commissioner Pete Grannis said on Oct. 6.

“Horizontal drilling is not new.
Hydraulic fracturing is not new. And
drilling into the Marcellus shale is

proposed involve all three of these
elements, along with greatly increased
water use,” Grannis said. “This review
is designed to ensure that if the drilling
goes forward, it takes place in the most
environmentally responsible way possible,” he said.
Following the public hearings and

spring 2009.

Marcellus shale drilling permits will be
required to undertake an individual,
site-specific environmental review.
That review must take into account the
same issues being considered in the
supplemental GEIS process and must
be consistent with the requirements of
State Environmental Quality Review Act

supplies. Testifying before
the New York State Assembly’s Standing Committee on Environmental
Conservation on Oct. 15
on behalf of the Independent Oil & Gas Association
of New York, Roger Willis,
president of Universal Well

Pa., said the US EPA has
reviewed hydraulic fracturing extensively and found
no cause for alarm.
“With all of the hydraulic fracturing treatments
that have been pumped in
New York state, DEC has not
found one case of documented damage

the Marcellus have no potential to be
used for potable water and have been

million years. We are utilizing fluids
that comply with EPA regulations and
all of them have been divulged to DEC

“greener” additives and continues research with the Groundwater Protection

birthplace because of Col. Edwin L.
Drake’s discovery at Titusville in 1859,
the state of Pennsylvania more recently
has had a robust gas producing industry and has seen significant coalbed methane production over the last
couple of years, according to the DEP
official. Roberts said the Marcellus is an
unconventional formation that requires
more water for fracturing and that led
to the development of a water permit
addendum, which asks not so much
how much water will be used but how
much will be left in the stream after it’s
withdrawn.
“The producers may think this is a
bit clumsy. We continue to meet with
them to understand their concerns
and try to streamline things,” Roberts
said. “We felt it was important to get
something out and put people to work.
Now, we’re going back and engaging in
training for the oil and gas industry and
our own staff in regard to how we do
these things,” he said.

hard to try and streamline the process to
provide adequate environmental protections, but the addendum needs work and
we’ve communicated that to the DEP. I
think it has a constructive attitude and is
looking for a proper balance.”
Roberts agrees, saying: “Withdrawal
of waters is one of two problems, and
in some respects is the easier one to
tackle. What is done with the water
after it’s used is a thornier question. In
Pennsylvania, we have not seen much
deep well injection of waste water.
We will need to see if the rock here is
suitable for it. Without that, we need to
have industrial facilities for the industry
to use. Up until now, it has been using
sewage treatment plants with wastewater facilities. That’s not going to suffice in the long term for the Marcellus
formation.”
Producers recognize that water will
be needed to be treated to remove
contaminants and solids once it has
been used to recover Marcellus shale
gas, Weber said. “We as an industry

Weber, adding, “The DEP is working very facilities. We’re also evaluating other

methods such as disposal wells, evaporation ponds and ways to recycle our
frac water on site so we can reuse it.
This last approach poses some technical
challenges,” he told OGJ.
Against this backdrop, Roberts said
the state recognizes that Marcellus shale
gas development could have a major
positive economic impact. “If you look
at the economic opportunities that were
created in the Dallas-Fort Worth area
by the Barnett shale and then apply it
across Pennsylvania, the potential is immense,” he said, adding, “Our original
oil and gas act specified to make certain
Pennsylvanians get the most out of our
resources. Gov. [Edward G.] Rendell
wants to make sure that Pennsylvania
companies can compete for that work
and that Pennsylvania citizens can be
trained for careers in the oil and gas
industry, yet in a way that respects our
state, our environment, and our natural
resources. That’s a challenge that the
industry is embracing.”
Weber noted, “I think we have made
progress. But I don’t want to give anyone the impression that we’re done. We
have work to do.” ✦

said. “Each of the large-cap companies

the robust economics of their projects

declines, particularly for XTO.”
XTO said Oct. 24 it has hedged 70%
of its expected 2009 production at an
equivalent price of $11/Mcf of natural
gas equivalent. “Given these hedges and
the current commodity strip pricing,
XTO anticipates record cash flow and

we will continue to look for opportunities to increase our hedge position.”

2009 volumes hedged in this manner.
In September, Chesapeake slashed
its drilling capital expenditure budget
by $3.2 billion, or 17%, for the second
half of 2008 through 2010. Company
officials blamed a 50% drop in gas
prices since June and the possibility of
an emerging gas surplus (OGJ Online,

At that time, analysts in the Houston

Inc. warned, “Expect other firms to
follow Chesapeake’s lead and lay down
rigs as well.” They said, “We continue
to see reduced drilling activity (lower
rig count) as necessary to balance the

to the decline in activity about a quarter

Analysts at Friedman, Billings,
Ramsey & Co. Inc. (FBR) in Arlington,
Va., said some independent producers
are planning their 2009 budgets based
on average prices of $80/bbl for oil
and $7.50/Mcf for natural gas. “Hedging costs are expected to increase, and
liquidity on the long end of the curve
is expected to decrease. Management
teams expect bank debts, whenever possible, to be repriced to match funding
cost increases. Also, bank debt capital
available to the industry in general and
smaller players specifically is expected
to go down reasonably,” they said.
“E&P spending cuts make it clear to
us that operators will not simply ‘drill
through’ this period of natural gas price
uncertainty,” said analysts at Pritchard
Capital (OGJ Online, Oct. 15, 2008).
“We have begun to see spending reductions or deferrals that will negatively

prices below $4/MMbtu in the Midcontinent, West Texas, and the Rockies.”

Transparency impresses
Despite Chesapeake’s disappointing
performance earlier this year, analysts
were impressed with the company’s
plans at its inaugural analyst meeting
in mid-October. “The impressive level
of transparency shown by the management team should calm any lingering
fears about the company’s financial
position,” said Raymond James analysts.
Company officials told analysts its
operations in the Haynesville and Fayetteville shale areas alone could replace
95% of Chesapeake’s 2009 production.
“Due to the innovative joint venture
structures in these plays, Chesapeake’s
partners are expected to cover 64% of
the costs, meaning Chesapeake needs
to only spend about $545 million to
replace 95% of its 2009 production,

ing cash flow forecast of $5.8 billion,”
Raymond James said.
Company officials are certain they
can drive down acreage costs 50% in
the Barnett and Haynesville plays.
Pritchard Capital analysts previously
reported “significant skepticism regarding the Marcellus value proposition,
given that Chesapeake has not discussed
its plans in the past to any degree.” They
said, “Management believes Marcellus wells from pads can be drilled for
$3.5 million. They see returns in excess
of 200% at $7/MMbtu pricing on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.”
Chesapeake is operating 3 rigs on
its 1.8 million net acres in the Marcellus play and plans to go to 20 rigs by
yearend 2010, with net production
expected to reach 130 MMcfd of gas
equivalent from current levels of 15
MMcfd. That development could be accelerated with completion of a planned
joint venture. ✦

A growing share
RIK payments make up a growing
share of the oil and gas royalties MMS
and the US Bureau of Land Management
generate, according to GAO. About 58%
of the $9.74 billion in royalty payments
received in fiscal 2006 were in-value

MMS takes the oil or gas it receives as
an in-kind royalty and sells it on the
open market. The agency has said the
program increases revenue, improves
efficiency, and shortens the compliance
cycle.
Before the mid-1990s, MMS’s inkind efforts were generally limited to
its small refiners program under which
it took in-kind oil and sold it to small
refiners that did not have adequate supplies of their own, according to GAO.
The agency in 1995 began to study
whether taking oil and gas in kind was
in the federal government’s best interests and in 1998 began a series of pilot

MMS has expanded the program, the

In 2003 GAO recommended that
MMS develop a more systematic approach to assessing its RIK program,
and said the agency has made progress
in developing metrics for assessing the
program’s performance. The agency
said on Sept. 8 in an annual report to
Congress on the RIK program that it
generated more than $63 million in additional benefits during fiscal 2007.
GAO’s new report questioned whether MMS’s annual reports to Congress

The report also said that MMS’s

costs such as information technology
expenses that the two programs shared,

State BLM officials said the agency

its Utah acreage. Area oil and gas associations are welcoming the new plans.
Environmental organizations,
meanwhile, were more concerned
about a lease sale they expected BLM
to announce Nov. 4. They believed
it would include areas that they said
BLM previously had declared “wilderness caliber landscapes.”
“This has been a truly collaborative
effort in balanced stewardship for the
future,” said Selma Sierra, Utah State
BLM director. “We are pleased to have
the plans completed and look forward
to moving into the implementation
phase of the planning process.”
Sierra said the new plans will help
the agency meet challenges that have
emerged since the previous RMPs
were written about 25 years ago.
Each new plan took about 6 years to
complete, she indicated.

Some stricter controls
The agency tried to balance environmental protection with energy
resource development, state BLM officials said. In the new plans, 53% of
the acres open to leasing are subject
to stricter environmental controls,
and 18% of the lands within the
planning areas aren’t available at all.
BLM also wants to minimize the
oil and gas production footprint
on public land by using innovative
methods such as directional drilling,
well placement, sound muffling, and

thlleen Sgamma, governmentt
affairs director for the Independent
Petroleum Association of Mountain
States, said Utah’s BLM staff found
it difficult to balance often competing interests and respond to nearly
220,000 public comments and 87
formal protests.
Oil and gas production in Utah
occupies less than 1% of public land
there, she noted. With current technology and industry practices, producers can develop energy resources
now, and reclaim the land to its original condition afterward, she said.

Small, temporary impacts
“We hope BLM took into account
the small and temporary impacts of
natural gas development and recognized that energy production and
other uses of public lands in Utah can
and do coexist,” Sgamma said.
Area environmental groups are
more concerned with what they say
will be a move by BLM to offer oil and
gas leases in the Nine-Mile Canyon
region of eastern Utah on Dec. 19.
“What makes this action so deplorable is that BLM itself determined
these areas to be wilderness-quality
lands,” said Stephen Bloch, conservation director for the Southern Utah
Wilderness Alliance.
SUWA said the tracts that BLM
plans to offer are dominated by acreage that the agency determined had
wilderness character after conducting inventories during 1996-99 and
2001-07. They largely are part of land

ated with the RIK program beginning
with the fiscal 2008 report to Congress.
The agency also is re-evaluating the
process by which it calculates the time
value of money benefit or early payment savings, including interest rates
used and the comparison methodology
to in-value payments, he said.
“While MMS calculates revenue performance metrics by individual property for oil and by pipeline for gas, the
results are rolled up into reporting categories in order to protect proprietary
information regarding royalty-in-kind
sales, particularly contractual arrangements with service providers. The MMS
believes reporting revenue performance
by individual oil property or gas pipeline has the potential to compromise
the actual bid prices that MMS receives
for the sale of oil or gas and could affect
the competitive nature of the sales,”
Allred continued.
“Proprietary information includes
pricing and sales data. The royalty-inkind sales contracts include confidentiality clauses that neither party will
disclose prices received under the contract. Many RIK service agreements for
transportation and/or processing also
have confidentiality clauses that neither
party will disclose the rates charged or
the terms of the agreement. Maintaining the confidentiality of proprietary
data is essential to continue to contract
for royalty-in-kind,” he said. ✦

Brazil’s oil development bonanza shapes up
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Brazil’s Petroleo Brasilerio SA (Petrobras), even as it eyes greater output for
the future, exported a record 574,000
b/d of oil in October, breaking the
previous monthly high of 532,000 b/d
in April.
Altogether, Petrobras exported more
than 17.8 million bbl in October,
with exports bound mainly for the
US (65.2%), China (24.1%), Europe
(5.5%), and other South American nations (5.2%).
Analyst Global Insight said this
“trend is expected to continue in
the coming years as new fields come
online, particularly those in the presalt
layer, with the company planning to
invest in new refineries in order to add
value to its future oil exports.”

BG sees 300,000 boe/d
Underlining future developments in
the country, BG Group PLC said output
from the Tupi, Iara, and Guara deepwater fields in the Santos basin should hit
300,000 boe/d by 2012.
“First commercial production is now
expected from the 100,000 b/d Tupi
pilot by fourth quarter 2010,” said BG,
whose other partners in the fields are
Petrobras and Galp Energia.
BG further said the exploration success with Guara and Iara has led the
partnership to hasten planning on two
additional 100,000 b/d pilot schemes,
with the objective of achieving first
production in 2012.
BG estimated its net share of reserves
and resources in the Santos basin at 3
billion boe, of which 2 billion boe can
be classified as proved or probable.

Low prices no deterrent
The recent fall in crude oil prices
is not expected to adversely affect the
developments, according to BG Group
Chief Executive Frank Chapman, who
said, “We are comfortable that these

developments are economic at prices
significantly below where we are today.”
That view was shared by mines and
energy minister Edison Lobao who
said oil and gas production is viable at
Brazil’s subsalt reserves even with oil at
$60/bbl.
“It’s perfectly possible to exploit subsalt oil at this price. Of course, for the
good of the country we’d want a bigger
gain,” he said.
Lobao said the much larger size of
the subsalt reserves offsets the higher
cost of subsalt exploration. “Drilling
that lifts 5,000 or 10,000 b/d in a regular field could lift 50,000 or 100,000
b/d in the subsalt,” he said.

ExxonMobil drilling
Meanwhile, ExxonMobil Corp. has
started drilling in the presalt layer of
Brazil’s Santos basin, according to the
firm’s vice-president of investor rela-

tions David Rosenthal.
Rosenthal, in a conference call, said
the West Polaris deepwater drilling
rig arrived in Brazilian waters in late
September, and after concluding the
required inspections and clearances, the
company has begun drilling the Azulao
well on Block BM-S-22.
He said ExxonMobil chartered the
rig for 3 years and expects to have its
first results on BM-S-22 by yearend,
although they could be delayed to early
2009.
“I wouldn’t want to speculate on
exactly when we’ll make an announcement, but that will happen as soon as
we are ready and have information to
provide,” said Rosenthal.
He added that plans to drill a second
well on the block are under way and
will follow immediately upon completion of the first well.
ExxonMobil is operator of the block,

remains to be seen. But it will be necessary for Obama to take control of
the current financial crisis to ensure
the pursuit of energy supplies.
Price inflation for the goods and
services used in extracting oil and
gas—along with the recent collapse
in crude oil prices from a record
above $147/bbl in July to around
$63/bbl now—is forcing oil companies to rethink many projects around
the world.
A sign of that emerged last week
when BG Group CEO Frank Chapman
said his firm is delaying a final investment decision on whether to proceed
with Phase III development of the
Karachaganak gas and condensate
project in Kazakhstan.

Kazakhstan reason to rethink its
relationship with the development
partners. Along with BG, which has a
32.5% stake in Karachaganak Petroleum Operating BV (KPO), Eni holds
32.5%, Chevron has 20%, and LUKoil
has 15%.

Kashagan revisited?

After all, it was a similar delay
in the Eni-led Kashagan project that
prompted the Kazakhstan government to seek greater participation
for the state-run KazMunaiGaz
(KMG). That was settled just a week
or 2 ago, when KMG saw its share
doubled and a new operating model
instituted.
Something similar may be in the

remaining 20%.

Chevron to start also
Chevron Corp. expects to begin
production at its Frade field in Brazil’s
Campos basin next year. “First oil is
expected during the second quarter of
2009,” said Chevron Executive VicePres. George Kirkland in a conference
call.
Kirkland said construction of the
FPSO scheduled to operate in the
offshore field is 85% complete, and
the vessel is due to set sail from Dubai
in late December. Earlier, Chevron said
production could reach 85,000 b/d in
2011.
Chevron is operator of Frade and
holds a 51.7% stake, while Petrobras
holds a 30% share, and Frade Japao
owns the remaining 18.3%.
In another development, Inpex
Corp. said it has received the Brazilian
authorities’ approval to acquire a 20%
interest in offshore Block BM-C-31 in
Brazil from Royal Dutch Shell. In addition to Inpex, Petrobras holds 60% and
Shell 20% interest in the field.
In the coming year, an exploration well is scheduled to be drilled on
BM-C-31, which covers an area of 710
sq km, some 150 km off the state of
Rio de Janeiro.

Matto Grosso
Looking farther ahead, oil and natural gas exploration in Brazil’s centralwestern Mato Grosso state may begin in
2010, according to the state’s governor,
Blairo Maggi.
Brazil’s oil, gas, and biofuels regulatory agency ANP will hold its 10th oil
and gas exploration and production
rights auction on Dec. 18-19, offering some 130 onshore blocks, located
in eight sectors, in seven sedimentary
basins.
According to Maggi, the auction will
include rights for six blocks in his state,
including an area of 14,381 sq km in
the onshore Parecis basin, near the Teles
Pires River. ✦

Uncertainty afﬂicts International Gas Summit participants
Doris Leblond
OGJ Correspondent
Uncertainty was the hallmark of the
13th International Gas Summit in Paris
Oct. 22-23, reflecting the current world
financial turmoil and looming economic slowdown. Speakers felt unable to
predict short or medium-term natural
gas developments and were more at
ease with long-term projections.
Summit Pres. Nordine Ait-Laoussine, president of Geneva-based
consulting group Nalcosa, set the
tone in his introductory remarks: “We
are all apprehensive of the potential
consequences of the ongoing global
turmoil for the natural gas industry…
we do not know the answers to some
critical questions:
• ‘How deep will the recession be?’
• ‘How long will it last?’
• ‘Will this turn out to be the most
severe crisis the world has ever faced…
or will it be short-lived if proper remedies are agreed upon and implemented
quickly?’
• ‘Will some regions or industries
escape relatively unscathed?’”
He added, “It would appear inevitable
that the gas industry will be affected,
perhaps in a profound way.”

Supply security
The “security of supply” issue came
in for a new analysis. Moderator Claude
Mandil, former International Energy
Agency executive director and author of
a report on supply security released in
May to the French government, quickly
noted that “recession reduces tensions
on capacities and will create obstacles
to investments, with possibly lasting
consequences.”
GDF Suez global gas and LNG VicePres. Jean-Marie Dauger said, “Certainties have been jostled. The short-term
was comfortable; we are not comfortable now in any horizon, so it is easier
to talk of the long-term.” Although
fundamentals such as demography,

emerging economies, and Europe’s
long-term gas market growth remain,
he said, “Uncertainty is on the demand
level and the short-term availability.”

In the current changing environment and volatile market, Daugier
said, market risks could be reduced
and demand-supply security bolstered

through “downstream interpenetration”
of producers in consumer countries.
Eni Senior Vice-Pres. for gas and
power Camillo Michele Gloria agreed,
also suggesting that producing countries become involved in their clients’
downstream businesses. The problem,
he pointed out, was “government
mistrust,” but he said the crisis could
“bring good news with it.”
He added: “We have before us an
environment opportunity to think of
cooperation as a good way to long-term
access to resources. Security will need
strong cooperation between producers
and buyers,” he said. “Gas importers
must be engaged in wide-ranging win-

T E R E S T
win deals well beyond the buyer-seller
paradigm.”
Phlippe Boisseau, Total’s president
of gas and power, agreed that the crisis
would have an impact on demand
but remained bullish about long-term
prospects. He was optimistic that “LNG
projects decided today will come on
stream in 2020” and that they must be
started now.
Total intends to pursue a strong
investment policy. If investments proceed, he said, there will be no supply
problems after the 2013 bubble everyone is expecting. LNG’s flexibility as
well as the diversity of supply sources
are strong reasons to pursue investments.

Future LNG challenges
For Sonatrach, the constraint is not
access to markets but securing development of “adequate liquefaction capacities,” explained Nabila Metref, pipe gas
and LNG exports director. There are
many projects planned, she said, but
few under construction.
“Suppliers are implementing new
development schemes that take into
account the reality of each market and
[that] preserve security of demand,” she
said. “This includes downstream positions through dedicated [long-term]
affiliates.”
Viewing LNG growth with its “longterm promising future,” Royal Dutch
Shell’s general manager for global
energy strategy and portfolio development, Jacqueline Redmond, also saw
as one of the future challenges “the
below-average final investment decisions” in 2006-07 “and none taken in
2008,” due, in part, to escalating costs
and engineering, procurement, and
construction (EPC) constraints.
Utility Electricite de France says the
problem is the volatility of gas prices in
Europe, making it hard for electricity
producers to choose a technology and
increasing the risks taken by producers.
It strongly favors a “robust gas price
index,” which, it suggested, could be in
euros.
For the index to emerge, efficient
access to transit capacities and to
efficient flexibility tools would be required together with utility-producer
partnerships where project opportunities and risks are shared. A gas price
index in Europe, where both piped gas
and strongly growing LNG markets
coexist, would contribute to stabilizing
both spot and long-term gas contracts
it said.

Financing gas projects
The crucial question about financing
projects in the current financial turmoil
received no comforting answer.
Jerome Halbout, a partner in Parisbased 4D Global Energy Advisers, said

Oil & Gas Journal / Nov. 10, 2008

funding sources were particularly
sensitive to the financial markets crisis
in a softening economy “where oil was
a refuge for liquidity and with no improvement in sight in the price deck.”
Pinpointing the impact on upstream
companies Halbout said, “Frontier E&P
will suffer the most.
Majors, national oil companies
(NOCs), successful independents, and
recently financed projects—all with
sufficient operational cash flow needed
to fund their capital expenditure
commitments—would be the survivors
as funding commitments from banks
evaporate until 2009, with the capital
markets essentially closed.”
Projects not properly financed before
the funding crunch will be abandoned—or postponed if the promoter
is sufficiently financed to resist the
credit squeeze, he said. If not, nonconventional, frontier, or stranded reserves
will be canceled.
The pressure on EPC contractors
will slacken, but they will have more
work in Asia and producing countries,
Halbout said.
Concerning the financing of LNG
projects, banking group Societe
Generale’s director of energy project
finance Katan Hirachand was more
bullish as he expected the market
situation to be restored in the shortto-medium term.
“LNG is very favored by banks,” he
added. Nonetheless, “multi-sourced financings will be the key to maximizing
leverage and will need reconciliation of
different lenders and their objectives,”
he said. Strong sponsors with support
from governments and with a good
history will also be needed, he said,
and the intervention of NOCs would
provide “more comfort.”
Within the LNG sectors, he was
specially encouraging about “floating
LNG,” for it is “redeployable, faster to
market, had a reduced environmental
and social impact, and enjoyed a lower
potential unit cost. “However,” he
cautioned, “some innovation will be
needed to make floating LNG bankable.”

Some good news
One area where the current crisis
has yielded good news for the gas
industry is the change in the European
Commission’s strong bias for shortterm gas purchasing contracts versus
long time ones.
“The long term view is being rehabilitated,” noted Michel Guenaire,
partner at the law firm Gide Loyrette
Nouel, who was involved in a number
of disputes caused by the commission’s
short-term bias.
The need by buyers for supply
security “is likely to mark a return to
long-term contracts,” Guenaire said.
“The commission focused on shortterm contracts as a way to open up
the [European
Union] gas market and make it
more fluid,” he
explained. While
the commission
did not forbid
such contracts, a
supplier could be
sanctioned if advantage was taken
of a dominant
position.
The gas market, Guenaire
pointed out, is
still 90% involved
in long-term,
take-or-pay supply contracts.
Many were signed
when the buyers were still
monopolies and
the contracts
often are renewed
before falling due.

Their acceptance in markets now open
to competition will combine both
supply safety and the guarantee of
price competitivity.
The fact that gas prices can be
hitched to the spot market or forward
price of gas or on electricity prices
justifies the maintenance of long-term
gas contracts in an open competitive
market, Guenaire said, along with the
growing recourse to the gas release
system where an operator enjoying
a dominant position can sell gas by
auction to a competing operator.
The annual summit was organized
by Institut Francais du Petrole and
consultant-publisher Petrostrategies. ✦

The ultradeep Gulf of Mexico shelf
well known as Blackbeard has logged
four “potential hydrocarbon-bearing
zones below 30,067 ft,” said operator McMoRan Exploration Co., New
Orleans.
Having reached 32,997 ft in October, McMoRan and partners had to
decide whether to halt drilling and
attempt to test the zones encountered
thus far or
continue drilling to basement, expected
below the
permit depth
of 35,000 ft,
in an effort to
penetrate at least another 2,000 ft of
sediments.
It is too soon to tell whether the four
zones, in the Miocene Rob-L formation,
contain crude oil or gas-condensate,
James R. Moffett, cochairman of McMoRan said on an Oct. 20 webcast. On
Oct. 23, McMoRan said, “The well will
be temporarily abandoned while the

equipment is procured for this anticipated high pressure test.”
How soon formation tests might take
place wasn’t predicted.
Bottomhole pressure exceeds 25,000
psi, and the four zones exhibit the high
resistivity seen in Rob-L elsewhere.
Moffett said, “No one ever tried to
flow a well at these depths.” The well is
presently cased to 27,000 ft.
About 18 months after previous operators gave up on the well after drilling
to just below 30,000 ft, McMoRan’s
group took over. It deepened the well
routinely except for a 31⁄2-week period
of lost returns, penetrated a normal
stratigraphic section, and ran conventional logs to the new total depth, Moffett said.

Wide area impact
The well is on the crest of a massive
structure covering more than 10,000
acres, and test results have implications
out to a 50-mile radius of the well,
Moffett said.

“Seismic data on the prospect
indicates the potential for significantly thicker sands on the flanks of the
structure as confirmed in recent major
deepwater discoveries,” McMoRan said.
“Based on information obtained to date
in the South Timbalier Block 168 well,
McMoRan believes additional drilling
on the flanks could result in significant
reserve potential.”
A drillsite 21⁄2 miles southeast of the
Blackbeard well, for example, might encounter a depositional wedge in which
the same formations are two to three
times as thick as at the crest, Moffett
said. The great thickness and large areal
extent makes for large recoverables.
Moffett said this conclusion is based
on McMoRan’s interpretation of data
made public by the partners in the
K2 deepwater field 90 miles southsoutheast on Green Canyon Block 562,
where sands were transported from the
onshore Mississippi River Delta.
Operators naturally drill the top of
structures in deep water because they
lack well control and historically found
the greatest chance for hydrocarbons is
at the crest, Moffett noted.
McMoRan’s confidence in Blackbeard is further bolstered because it is
exploring for the same formations as
at its large Flatrock discovery in 10 ft
of water on South Marsh Island Block
212 about 100 miles north-northwest
of Blackbeard. The Rob-L formation encountered at 28,000-35,000
ft at Blackbeard is producing gas at
14,000-16,500 ft at Flatrock.

Successful wells can be placed on
production quickly through Tiger Shoal
field facilities.
McMoRan said the Flatrock-4 well
tested 109 MMcfd of gas and 2,500
b/d of condensate on a 500⁄65-in. choke
with 8,170 psi flowing tubing pressure. The same sand is producing 100
MMcfd in the Flatrock-2 well, which
went online in July.
The first three Flatrock wells are producing a combined 170 MMcfed of gas
and condensate, and wireline logs indicated 100 net ft of pay in the Rob-L section of the Flatrock-5 development well.
That well is drilling towards 18,400 ft
to deeper Rob-L and Operc sands.
A McMoRan group is also preparing
to drill the Ammazzo prospect in South
Marsh Island 251. It is 16 miles and 11
miles south-southeast of Flatrock and
JB Mountain fields, respectively, and
lies along the structural axis of a ridge
trending from Flatrock. Objectives are
the same three Miocene formations.
Ammazzo is one of the largest
undrilled structures on the gulf shelf,
McMoRan said.

“In general a twofold increase in

Stream Oil & Gas also plans a second

Deep shelf economics
Moffett pointed out that the deep
shelf play is not so price sensitive as onshore shale plays, for instance, because
the reserves are large, the gas is found
in conventional, soft rock that requires
no horizontal drilling or frac treatments, and production infrastructure is
everywhere.
The South Timbalier Block 168 No.
1 well, formerly Blackbeard West, is
the deepest ever drilled below the mud
line in the gulf. It is in 70 ft of water
115 miles southwest of New Orleans
(see map, OGJ, June 7, 2004, p. 40).
The prospect covers a number of leases
in the South Timbalier and Ship Shoal
areas.
McMoRan operates the well with
32.3% working interest. Plains Exploration & Production Co. and Energy XXI
USA Inc., both of Houston, have 35%
and 20%, respectively.

study evaluated the gas
resources in the Bamett (Fort Worth basin), Deep Bossier, Haynesville, Fayetteville, Woodford, and Marcellus shales
in the US and the Montney, Hom River
(Muskwa), and Utica shales in Canada
(Fig. 1).
The study expects companies ultimately to recover from these resources
261 tcf of gas, based on various risk factors applied and a long-term average gas
price of $8.50/MMbtu. Without the risk
factors, Tristone Capital says these shales
have a 743-tcf recovery potential (Fig. 2).
Fig. 3 shows the study’s estimated
production from these plays, and Fig. 4
shows its US well completion forecast.
Several emerging shale plays with
limited well control also may contribute additional gas to future production,

according to the study. These include
the Pearsall shales in the Maverick basin
of South Texas, the Niobrara shales of
Western Colorado, and the Barnett shale
in the Delaware basin of West Texas.

Shale play comparison
The study says that shale-gas plays
owe their success to a balance of various parameters along with constantly
evolving drilling and
completion techniques
and infrastructure. “It is
commonly said that no
two shale gas plays are
exactly alike,” the study
says.
Table 1 summarizes
shale-gas play attributes, and Fig. 5
compares the arithmetic average of the
attributes. The study notes that the most
productive core portions of plays may
deviate from the averages.
Multistage hydraulic fracturing along

frac fluid flow-back greatly to shorten
cleanup time, the study says.
The Montney formation in British
Columbia is where companies use this
fluid. The study notes that stimulating a
horizontal well in the Montney typically involves perforating, isolating, and
fracturing 6-11 zones at a cost of about
$100,000- 120,000/frac interval. It is
common to spend more than $1 million for fracturing these wells, the study
says. The study describes these jobs as
needing 8-10 pump trucks or about
18,000-22,500 hp and taking more
than 1 week to complete.

Emerging plays

_______

Three emerging shale plays listed by
the study are Pearsall shales in the Maverick basin of South Texas, the Niobrara
shales of Western Colorado, and the
Barnett shale in the Delaware basin of
West Texas.
The study says the Pearsall is as deep
as 3,500 m in places, has a 200-300 m
thickness, and contains about 30-175
bcf/section of original gas in place. It
notes reports that say initial horizontal
wells flowed at 0.8-3.8 MMcfd.
The Niobrara shales outcrop in Kansas and Nebraska, but are at more than
2,500 m depths in western Colorado.
The study notes that in the eastern
shallower portion of the play, the shales
are underpressured and wells have low
initial rates, while in the deeper overpressure portion, wells may produced
at 1 MMcfd and recover 100-150 bcf of
gas/section.
The Barnett in the Delaware basin is
twice a deep as the Barnett in the Fort
Worth basin and therefore holds much
more gas per section. One estimate is
that the Delaware Barnett has 500 bcf/
section compared with 150 bcf/section
in the Fort Worth basin. The study notes
that developing Delaware Barnett gas
will be more complicated and costly. ✦

This analysis used the simulation’s
histogram and probability distribution results to calculate and report a
confidence level of when the project
would be completed. We were willing
to accept an 85% confidence level for
the level of risk in this simulation run.
Typically, the industry standard for a
confidence level is 75-85%.
A confidence level greater than 85%
would provide more certainty, but the
same end results, in that the project
would be completed after the accelerated project schedule date of July 15,
2008. A lower confidence level would
yield less certainty and unrealistic
results, which would be too optimistic
for our analysis.

Results, recommendation
• Original baseline schedule. The
design, procurement, and construction
phases spanned 32 months, beginning
in February 2006, and included process
engineering, procurement of materials,
and foundation excavation.
• An original planned completion
date of Sept. 18, 2008.
• A proposed accelerated schedule
of 30 months. As of Aug. 1, 2006, the
project was 16.6% complete, with a
project completion date forecast for
July 15, 2008, about 2 months ahead of
schedule.
• The owner asked: What is the level
of risk associated with accelerating the
original project schedule? Our recommendation was to assess the reasonableness of the baseline schedule, analyze
the risk associated with the schedule
reduction, and evaluate various scenarios generated by the Monte Carlo
simulation model, including applying
additional manpower to critical-path
activities.

summarized the more than 2,100 activities into a set of 220 to 300 activities
that best described sequences that were
critical, near-critical, and risk-sensitive
to the project’s completion.
We selected a triangle distribution
because it provided a range of possible
outcomes given a low, high, and median occurrence of the risk event. Also,
as previously mentioned, we selected
the 25% uncertainty variable because
issues with vendor cooperation and a
labor shortage would probably affect
the critical and near-critical activities.

distribution functions for 1,000 simulated project schedule outcomes.
Before we ran the simulation model,
the completion date for the accelerated
project schedule was July 15, 2008. Our
Monte Carlo simulation results, however, suggested that the project would
have an 85% chance of completion by
Sept. 18, 2008 (Fig. 2). July 15 was the
best-case scenario, with a less than 10%
probability. Worst-case scenario was
Dec. 18, 2008.
Given these results, we concluded
that the contractor would most likely
be unable to complete the proposed
accelerated schedule within 30 months.
Paying the contractor an incentive or
overtime premium to complete the
project on or before July 15, 2008,
would have not been cost beneficial to
the owner.
In fact, we estimated that the owner
would have paid the contractor $5-7.5
million in incentives and overtime
premiums for a project completion date
that only had a 10% chance of being
completing within the projected 30
months.

detail FSHR installation and monitoring,
as well as its integration with the export
pipeline.

Background
Petrobras’s oil flow master plan
(PDET) for development of Roncador
field in the Campos basin off Brazil consists of the P-52 semisubmersible oilexport system, an 18-in. OD oil-export
pipeline, and a freestanding hybrid riser
(FSHR) connecting the P-52 floating
production unit (FPU) to fixed platform
PRA-1, also in the Campos basin. P-52
is stationed in water 1,800 m deep;
PRA-1 is in about 100 m (Fig. 1).
A front-end engineering and design (FEED) project contracted to 2H
Offshore Engineering and based on
technical specifications and functional
requirements provided by Petrobras
developed the FSHR. Flow-assurance
studies required 50-mm thick thermal
insulation for both pipeline and the
vertical portion of the riser.
The FEED process considered a mobile offshore drilling unit (MODU) for
deploying the FSHR system, to take best
advantage of local practices and Petrobras’s capabilities. Bid requirements allowed some changes to the design and

installation procedure developed during
the FEED phase, in order better to suit
the contractor’s capabilities. As a result,
a pipelay and construction vessel were
considered for installation of both riser
and pipeline. Technip won the contract,
excluding the flexible jumper, awarded
to Wellstream, and the foundation, to
Petrobras.
High expected production rates
at P-52 required an 18-in. oil export
pipeline. Instrumented pigging requirements dictate the export riser have the
same diameter. This large-bore specification, combined with the deepwater
site, put this application outside the
present range of flexible-pipe and steel
catenary riser (SCR) solutions, both of
which present high top-tension loads
for installation and operation. Lateral
buckling failure in flexible pipes and
fatigue damage in the touchdown zone
(TDZ) of SCRs further limitated design
to heavier pipes, compromising hangoff loads.
The reduced dynamic response
of the FSHR system results in a motion decoupling between the floating
production unit (FPU) and the vertical
portion of the FSHR system. FSHR’s vessel interface loads are also small when
compared with SCRs or flexible pipe,
making it an attractive alternative solution for this kind of application. Additional cost savings accrue by having the
riser in place before FPU installation.

Design changes
The FSHR FEED awarded to 2H
Offshore Engineering considered the
following requirements:
• Flexible jumper, replaceable at any
time.
• Installation by MODU.
• Welded riser joints.
• SPP thermal insulation = 50 mm.
A drilled and grouted pile installed
by MODU was to provide FSHR’s
foundation. During FEED development,
Petrobras established that, due to installation and maintenance requirements,
the connection of the flexible jumper
at the FSHR side would occur on top of
the buoancy can (BC). A detailed struc-

tural design analysis considered passing
the riser stem through the BC.
Petrobras free-issued a MODU for
FSHR installation as an option in the
bid package, assuming FSHR foundation and flexible jumper installation as
part of its work scope. Petrobras initially
issued different offers for pipeline
and FSHR. Bid requirements allowed
changes to the FEED to suit contractors’
capabilites, including locating the flexible jumper connection on the FSHR’s
side. Bidders only proposed pipelay
and construction vessels for installation
of the riser and pipeline. The contract
awarded to Technip included development of the detailed design, material
supply, fabrication, and installation of
both pipeline and riser.

FSHR description
FSHR design may have a number of
variants. An optimazation study determines actual configuration considering:
• Offset from the foundation to the
FPU.

• Net upthrust provided by the BC.
• BC depth.
• Flexible jumper length
• Flexible jumper azimuth (plan
view).
The FSHR consists of a single nearly
vertical steel pipe connected to a foundation system near the mud line. A BC
holds the riser in the proper vertical
orientation and is mechanically connected to the top of the vertical pipe
by a chain. The BC lies below sea level,
beyond the influence of waves and high
currents. A gooseneck assembly sits on
top of the top riser assembly (TRA).
A flexible jumper links the gooseneck
to the FPU, effectively decoupling the
vertical part of the FSHR from vessel
motions. Fig. 2 shows the FSHR’s general arrangement.
The FSHR runs from the No. 1 hangoff slot on P-52 to the pipeline-end termination (PLET) near the riser base. The
lower end of the vertical part interfaces
with a stress joint. Below the stress joint
lies an offtake spool, connected to the

foundation by a hydraulic connector. A
rigid base jumper connects the mandrels at the offtake spool with the PLET,
providing the link between the FSHR
and the pipeline. The foundation pile is
drilled and grouted.
The upthrust from the nitrogen filled
BC on top of the vertical pipe provides
the tension. The vertical pipe must
be kept in tension to maintain FSHR
stability for all loads. The vertical pipe
consists, from top down, of the uppertaper stress joing (UTSJ), interfacing
with the TRA, the upper-adapter stress
joint (UASJ), standard joints, the loweradapter stress joint (LASJ), and the
60

lower-taper stress joint (LTSJ), interfacing with the offtake spool.
At the top of the TRA is the gooseneck assembly. This assembly consists
primarily of the gooseneck and an ROV
actuated hydraulic connector allowing
the gooseneck and flexible jumper to
be installed separately from the vertical
section of the riser. The gooseneck assembly also includes a cross-brace tied
to a reinforced spool to provide support
against loads applied to the gooseneck
from the flexible jumper.
Attached to the gooseneck is the
flexible jumper (FJ). The flexible jumper
connects the freestanding section of the

riser system to the
FPU, and includes
bend stiffeners to
ensure the range
of rotations experienced at the end
connections do not
damage the jumper
due to low radius
of curvature. The
flexible jumper has
sufficient compliance to decouple
vessel motions substantially and offsets
from the vertical
portion of the FSHR
system, limiting the
freestanding riser’s
wave-induced dynamic response.
Positioning the
gooseneck at the
TRA allows for independent installation
of vertical riser and
flexible jumper. A
flexible pipe installation vessel can
install the flexible
jumper when convenient, minimizing
the risk of damage
to the flexible jumper during installation. The horizontal
offset between the
mandrel at the TRA
and the BC vertical axis allows installation and retrieval of the flexible jumper.
This design also minimizes time needed
for flexible jumper retrieval in case of
damage while in service to any of its
components.

Buoyancy can
A nitrogen-filled buoyancy can holds
the riser system’s vertical section in the
proper orientation. The BC is cylindrical, 34.2 m long, 5.45 m in diameter,
and fabricated from 50,000-psi yield
material. Bulkheads separate 15 of the
16 2.28-m tall compartments. The BC’s
design is pressure balanced, with the
internal pressure slightly above the
external pressure of water, resulting in a
½-in. thick skin. A 56-in. outer diameter central stem, the 16th compartment,
runs along the BC’s longitudinal axis.
Ports on the side of each compartment dewater the BC. Each compartment features an inlet and an outlet
port. Injecting nitrogen into the BC at
pressure for dewatering leads the BC
compartment to be slightly overpressurized with regard to the water pressure
outside.
The BC design leaves at least one
of the 16 compartments permanently
water-filled as a contingency. Should
one compartment fail in service, a
contingency compartment can be dewatered to keep operational tension in the
riser string.

conditions used for the connected FSHR
global analysis.

FSHR design

The overall philosophy
for the definition of load
cases follows the format
adopted by API RP 2RD and
considers test, operating,
extreme, and survival load
categories. Within each category a number of separate
load cases exist, each having
various combinations of
environmental conditions,
pressures, and platform offsets. Environmental events occuring across a range
of directions required a number of load
cases to assess component response.
Platform offsets applied in various
directions ensured all worst-case loads
were covered.

P-52 offsets
Design maximum static offsets
measure 5% water depth for the intact
mooring system and 7.5% water depth
with one mooring line broken but
depend on the direction of environmental action. Offset also considered
FSHR foundation and P-52 installation
tolerances.

Fatigue criteria
The acceptance criterion for fatigue
damage = [(installation fatigue damage) + (in-place fatigue damage in
25 years)] × 10 <1.0. Vortex-induced
vibrations (VIV) include long-term and
storm current profiles (1, 10, and 100
years return period).

Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analysis determined the
effects of practical variations in riser
configuration with time and uncertainties in design parameters. Parameters
considered include:
• Hydrodynamic drag coefficient

FSHR design
The design of an FSHR typically
involves an up-front global analysis of
the system to optimize riser configuration. Variable parameters include offset
from the production platform, depth of
BC, flexible jumper length, net upthrust
provided by the BC, and flexible jumper
azimuth. Clearance may beecome an issue and interference with adjacent risers

components, however, can address this
increased loading.
At both ends of the flexible jumper,
bend stiffeners keep the curvatures
of the flexible pipe within allowable
limits. Plots of typical bending moment
distribution along the riser’s length in
extreme storm conditions show two
peaks; one at the riser base, the other at
the interface with the TRA. Large bending loads are present at both ends of
the riser, but special components such
as taper joints control the curvature and
stress, bringing the stress ratios at the
ends lower than those found at the riser
standard joints.
The free-hanging flexible jumper
load case proved important due to the
high loads and stresses caused by this
survival condition. Sensitivity analysis
showed hydrodynamic drag amplification due to VIV inducing higher loadings (shear forces, bending moments,
von Mises stress) at the riser base. No
clashes exist between the FSHR system
and adjacent lines (mooring line No. 16
and the 7-in. production flexible riser)
for the load cases considered.
There were also no clashes between
the FSHR flexible jumper and the P-52
hull during both intact and damagedpontoon conditions for the load cases
considered. Sensitivity analysis shows
the parameters studied to have no impact on minimum clearance.
Fig. 4 shows the positions of the BC’s
top in the horizontal plane for 24 load
cases (Operating Design Case 1). The
foundation position is (0,0). Fig. 5 also
shows the BC’s position in the neutral
position load case (FJ installed, system
subject to only gravity and buoyancy
loads).

Product adds corrosion inhibition to its uses
Inhibex 301 kinetic-gas hydrate inhibitor (KHI), which promises performance
under a variety of gas types and conditions, now shows—after testing—it to
work as a corrosion inhibitor (CI).
Standard CI tests were conducted on
metal coupons immersed in 3% sodium
chloride to simulate seawater, with 50
ppm and 5,000 ppm (solids) of Inhibex
301 contained in the test brine. Results
showed Inhibex 301 to have a high inhibitor efficiency rating of 85% at 50 ppm and
87% at 5,000 ppm, the company reports.
The product is an environmentally
friendly V-Cap copolymer that facilitates
uninterrupted gas flow in natural gas pipelines whatever the environment, temperature, or working conditions, the firm says.
While Inhibex 301 will not eliminate
the need for a separate CI in flow assurance formulations, it will decrease the
amount of additional CI required, the
firm noted. In addition, its compatibility
with most commonly used CIs will help

formulators avoid compatibility problems
currently occurring between many KHI
and CI components.

North American Shale Gas:
Prospects and Pitfalls on the Road Ahead
Gas shale development in the US (and soon in Canada) has set a blistering pace,
thanks to aggressive E&P players and a strongly supportive services infrastructure.
Recent successes in North American gas shales are largely due to well-planned
leasing strategies, cost-appropriate technologies, and smart fi
field/play development.
But has shale gas become a victim of its own success? Concerns over an emerging
gas supply surplus have pushed gas futures prices down to the point where some
of the top operators have begun cutting E&D budgets and laying down rigs. Even
as momentum has spread from the Barnett shale into the Arkoma-Woodford,
Haynesville, Marcellus, and other plays, there are questions about the path forward.

EIA: New US gas
saved $4 billion
in ﬁrst 7 months
Anyone concerned about imported energy should ﬁnd useful the simple proposition that raising production lowers imports
unless consumption rises by the same
amount.
It would seem, in fact, that politicians
overtaken by hope for energy independence, which means no imported energy at
all, should lead crusades for domestic oil
and gas production.

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

Yet most of them use energy independence mainly as a marketing slogan for
conservation mandates and subsidization
of nonfossil energy.
Energy independence is, in any case,
unachievable. It’s useful as a concept only
as a test for the presence of an adult sense
of proportion.
To acknowledge the futility of energy
independence, however, is not to deny the
value of domestically produced energy.
In an Oct. 22 report, the US Energy Information Administration highlights the value
of lowering high-cost imports by raising
lower-cost domestic production.
The energy in this case is natural gas,
US production of which has undergone
what EIA calls “an historic shift.”
After 9 years of little change, US gas
output rose by 4% in 2007. In the ﬁrst 7
months of this year, it leapt by 9% year
over year.
“The increased production in the United
States meant that the country has needed
to import less natural gas in 2008 than in
2007, especially in the form of LNG,” EIA
notes (see the proposition above). “For the
ﬁrst 7 months of 2008, LNG imports fell
by 64% compared with the same period in
2007, continuing a trend of reduced imports
that started in the second half of 2007.”
EIA then estimates the value of producing instead of importing gas.
In the ﬁrst 7 months of 2008, it says,
US wellhead gas prices rose to an average
of $9/Mcf. In the same period, LNG sold in
Japan for $13.30/Mcf.
At those prices, buying LNG would have
cost about $4 billion more than the new US
production during January through July,
EIA reckons. The savings probably were
higher in August and September, when
US wellhead gas prices fell and Asian LNG
prices rose.
Domestic production is good business,
something besides energy that the US now
desperately needs.

Oil futures post biggest monthly loss
In a surprise rally in the last few moments of trading Oct. 31 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the front-month December contract for benchmark US light, sweet
crudes surged upward to close at $67.81/bbl, up $1.85 for the day. Just 2 days earlier,
NYMEX registered the highest 1-day percentage gain in crude prices since June.
Trading for the December contract was volatile Oct. 29 at $63.65-69.24/bbl before
it closed at $67.50/bbl, up $4.77 that day, as the Federal Open Market Committee
lowered its target for overnight interest rates by a half point to 1%.
“Oil’s rise was mainly the result of the US dollar’s biggest 1-day fall in 23 years on
news that the Fed cut the fund rate,” said analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond
James & Associates Inc. (RJA). “Oil and gas both posted solid gains of 7.6% and
4.6%, respectively, and energy stocks followed suit.”
Yet neither rebound could prevent crude futures sales during October from posting the biggest monthly loss for front-month crude prices since that commodity
began trading in 1983. At one point, Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland,
said, “West Texas Intermediate came close to but failed to test the support of $60/
bbl and ﬁnished the week [ended Oct. 31] higher by $3.66/bbl, but most of these
gains were made in the ﬁnal 10 min of the week and of the month. The front-month
NYMEX crude price was down 32.6% during October, or $32.83/bbl, for the month
and 54% below a record-high of $147.27bbl in July. So far this year, front-month
crude prices have tumbled 29.4% on NYMEX.”
Jakob said, “[North Sea] Brent was up by $3.27/bbl for the week. Heating oil for
December gained $4.80/bbl, and the front-month November contract for reformulated blend stock for oxygenate blending (RBOB) increased by only $1.94/bbl. Natural
gas was higher by 5%. WTI is now $28/bbl lower than a year ago, and this was the
ﬁrst in 5 weeks with a higher weekly close.”
Heating oil holds the line
Some said the rally apparently began in petroleum products, with an end-ofmonth squaring of market positions. Jakob said: “Heating oil values continue to
hold the oil complex above water and is the only product providing some support to
reﬁning margins, but the Commodity Futures Trading Commission data continues to
show a dearth of speculative activity on heating oil with positions showing close to
no change in the week. For heating oil, all the activity is happening in the commercial section or through small speculators (small speculators are holding more of the
open interest in heating oil than large speculators.) In RBOB, large speculators continue the action of last week and are adding to net length and covering short positions while the crack is in negative territory.” Meanwhile, The University of Michigan/
Reuters index released Oct. 31 showed a fall to 57.6 in late October, compared with a
reading of 70.3 in late September. Earlier in October, the reading was down to 57.5.
The US Commerce Department said gross domestic product contracted in the
third quarter to the lowest quarterly ﬁgure since third quarter 2001. For the most
recent quarter, GDP fell at a seasonally adjusted 0.3%/year rate between July and
September. The US Energy Information Administration reported US oil use in August
was the lowest since December 2001, down 8.4% from the same period a year ago
(OGJ Online, July 31, 2008).
RJA analysts said crude prices were lower in early trading Nov. 3 on concerns of
continued slowing energy demand. Over the weekend, Chakib Khelil, president of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, warned that member countries
must make further production cuts to stabilize oil prices between $70-80/bbl. “The
downward demand pressure is partly a result of continued uncertainties around the
global ﬁnancial crisis, but [the] US presidential election may alleviate some of the
uncertainty by providing more clarity around future government policies,” said RJA
analysts.
Meanwhile, supply disruptions blurred domestic gas production growth in
August. The latest US Energy Information Administration’s Form-914 natural gas
production survey, released Oct. 31, laid out total US volumes averaging 63.3
bcfd in August—up 5.4 bcfd (9.3%) from a year ago. “While volumes fell 100,000
bcfd sequentially, we would point out that production was negatively impacted by
hurricane-related (Gustav) shut-ins, which the Mineral Management Service pegs at
300,000 MMcfd, and operational issues (compression, shut-ins, etc.) in Wyoming.
While this ‘sloppy’ data point is 2 months stale, it provides support to the bearish
natural gas injection numbers seen in August, running 3.5 bcfd looser (on a weatheradjusted basis),” RJA analysts said.

Introduction

Atlantis, a signature BP-operated project
for the ages
“The ultimate measure
of the success of Atlantis will be based on a report card turned in many
times over during the life
of the ﬁeld. I see ﬁrst oil
only as the critical milestone that marks
the beginning of its journey on a path
toward remarkable achievements. What
I ﬁnd more intriguing is the very real potential that 10 years after startup we’ll
wake up and see a fresh article in Oil
and Gas Journal that highlights another
landmark achieved by Atlantis.”
– Greg Sills, Project General Manager, Atlantis

A

legendary Greek isle may have inspired the
name of BP’s Atlantis project in the Gulf of Mexico, but this stunning technological achievement
is neither mythical nor ancient. The Atlantis Field is located in the Gulf of Mexico about 185 miles south of
New Orleans, Louisiana, in Green Canyon Block 743. The
ﬁeld is in a region known as the Western Atwater Foldbelt and lies beneath a structure known as the Sigsbee
Escarpment. The escarpment is a thousands-feet-high
steeply sloping hill that tops out in water about 4,400
feet deep, with its base reaching a water depth of just
over 7,000 feet as the seabed becomes less contoured.
The Atlantis host facility is located about two nautical
miles from the ﬁeld in adjacent Green Canyon Block 787.
Moored in 7,074 feet of water, Atlantis was the world’s
deepest semisubmersible production facility when installed, and, at a displacement of more than 97,700 tons,
it is second in size only to BP’s Thunder Horse production, drilling and quarters facility. BP operates Atlantis and
holds 56 percent interest in the project, with co-owner
BHP Billiton holding the remaining 44 percent interest.
The oil and gas is exported to markets ashore via the BPoperated Mardi Gras transportation system, the world’s
highest capacity deepwater transportation system. Mardi
Gras consists of some 490 miles of oil and gas pipelines
and is designed to move more than 1 billion barrels of
crude oil and 1.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas daily.

The Atlantis host, a production quarters facility (PQ)
that is without a drilling rig, is designed to process
200,000 barrels of oil and 180 million cubic feet of natural gas daily. Initial development of the ﬁeld calls for 16
production wells and four injection wells, with growth
into adjacent areas not only expected but planned for
from the start of the project. Like many of the ﬁelds
found in the Gulf of Mexico, more than 60 percent of the
Atlantis Field structure lies beneath salt and the Sigsbee
Escarpment, making the decision on the type of facility
and drilling unit crucial to successful exploitation of this
extremely valuable asset.
BP partnered with Global Santa Fe for a purpose-built
drilling vessel for Atlantis. Drilling and completion team
members worked with Global Santa Fe on the design
and construction of the company’s new GSF Development Driller II (DD2), and BP’s input helped result in a
design that delivered more functionality than the basic
ability to drill and complete wells and install trees. DD2
has signiﬁcant construction capabilities that enable it to
install and remove major portions of the subsea architecture, and its design allows it to more safely conduct a
variety of complex tasks.
Atlantis proudly achieved ﬁrst oil on October 6, 2007,
the highlight of a journey that began in 1998, a journey
shrouded in uncertainty and huge risks. A key part of
BP’s $15 billion investment in the Gulf of Mexico, Atlantis was scheduled to be the fourth of four signature
projects to startup, with Holstein, Mad Dog and Thunder
Horse preceding it. The high expectations surrounding
these world-class developments extended beyond BP,
garnering global recognition by a giant banking ﬁrm that
included them in its report describing 50 energy projects
that could change the world.
Time would prove it impossible for the Atlantis team
to predict the upcoming, unprecedented changes in technology, the new weather patterns in the Gulf of Mexico
and the unforeseen quadrupling of oil prices that spread
rate and cost increases across the industry. Through it all
the team not only persevered, but used their ingenuity
and expertise to reach an exceptional level of success on
a world-class project, while confronted by some of the
most daunting challenges faced in the energy industry
to date.

lantis Field. It was drilled based on a 2D grid of 3D Kirchoff-method prestack depth migrated seismic data. The
results were considered marginal at best by many within
BP. The well veriﬁed hydrocarbons were present, but in a
relatively thin reservoir with only 90 feet of oil over ﬁve
intervals. Green Canyon, block 699 had penetrated thick
sands with multiple oil-water contacts, providing clues
that despite sparse initial results from the reservoir, substantial resources might yet be there. The challenges
of imaging and drilling through salt on an escarpment
in very deep water would draw serious scrutiny by the
decision makers at BP who were tasked to approve or
reject Atlantis. The capital at risk was signiﬁcant, even
for an energy major and its co-owner.
Drilling the Green Canyon 743-1 appraisal well began
on April 22, 2000, and two main sands—about 500 feet
of total pay—were revealed. John Oldroyd, a geologist
who has served continuously with the Atlantis team
since its inception nearly nine years ago, recalls the
doubt surrounding the project’s prospects as the team
prepared for the arduous sanction process with top-level
management: “Atlantis was ‘teetering on the edge of
do-ability’ according to one BP vice president, and that
was a reasonable assessment based on what we knew
at the time and what technology was available to us”.
The project team faced the difﬁcult task of creating
a viable development plan that would take into account
the ﬁeld’s potential while best preparing for the uncertainties that existed in the reservoir. To do this, BP and
co-owner BHP Billiton assembled a fully integrated team
consisting of a diverse group of personnel with extensive backgrounds in facilities, wells delivery, commercial

aspects and—for the ﬁrst time on a BP deepwater Gulf
of Mexico team—subsurface expertise.
Together they developed a comprehensive development plan with four major facets: a reservoir depletion
plan, a ﬂexible development concept, an innovative drilling plan and a reservoir management plan. Building on
what was learned by earlier BP projects such as Horn
Mountain, Holstein and Mad Dog, they built in some
unique solutions to the obstacles that might confront Atlantis in the future. They decided upon production from
wet trees transported through manifolds to a moored
semisubmersible production quarters located away
from the drill center, a dedicated semisubmersible drilling unit to be located above the primary drilling center,
and consideration for future multiple drill centers rather
than just one.

Path to project sanction
For Performance Unit Leader Greg Sills, the project’s
general manager, his work on the Atlantis team is the
longest he’s ever been on a single project in his decadeslong career. “I joined the team during what’s known as
the ‘appraise stage’ in the BP Capital Value Process
(CVP),” said Sills. Sills noted that CVP has ﬁve distinct
stages: appraise, select, deﬁne, execute and operate.
During the “appraise” stage a project’s alignment
with BP’s business strategy and the project’s feasibility
are determined. If the project passes scrutiny, funding
and resources for the “select” phase are approved to
study development options and choose the appropriate
plan. In the “deﬁne” stage, the development option selected receives the level of planning and design needed

to determine the scope of the project and to develop
cost and schedule estimates.
After the project scope is fully deﬁned and agreement
is reached to go forward, then project “sanction” is granted
and the funds and resources to deliver an operating asset
are made available. The “execute” stage follows sanction,
and includes engineering, procurement, construction and
all other steps to achieve startup. Throughout this stage,
careful oversight is maintained to help achieve cost, schedule and operability targets. The ﬁnal phase is “operate,”
which begins when a fully operational asset is delivered.
The goal going forward in this stage is to sustain maximum
performance and return on investment.
The upper-echelon BP executives who conducted
the CVP review of Atlantis lauded the detail and scope
of work of the integrated project development team.
The executives were able to understand clearly how the
risks of such a complex project were balanced by potentially large reserves, and that the carefully developed

both the signiﬁcant upside potential and the subsurface
downside uncertainties. They concluded possible rewards from Atlantis outweighed its risks, and the project
achieved sanction on November 18, 2002.

An unexpected vision

“Together, we will make Atlantis the
safest, cleanest, most reliable and best
performing asset.”
– Atlantis Vision Statement
According to Sills, people participating in the exercise to
create a vision statement for Atlantis were not prepared
for the notion that a project team in the early phase of
design would create a vision that not only went beyond
ﬁrst oil, but didn’t even allude to it. “We’re in the business to ﬁnd and develop the biggest ﬁelds we can, not
just build and operate assets. To develop and exploit
these huge opportunities in
the Gulf of Mexico requires
planning for the future from
the very beginning.” Sills
adds that even though the
main function of the Atlantis project team was to
bring the asset into the operate phase and turn it over
to the BP operations team,
they needed a “longer-wavelength” vision. “Note the vision statement doesn’t even
talk about startup. That surprised a lot of people,” said
Sills. “We deliberately aimed
way beyond ﬁrst oil.”
“We made sure that
BP’s brand values were embodied in all stages of the
Atlantis CVP,” added Sills.
“The development concept
itself limits the amount of
hydrocarbon inventory the
PQ is exposed to. The team
worked to reduce risks to
people and the environment
throughout the design. To do
that, we carried out extensive assessments to verify
that we had accomplished
the correct amount of risk
mitigation, and it paid off.”

Introduction

Offshore morning meeting

Sills noted that during the original concept selection, a preeminent decision factor was process safety.
“We compared which design would have more inherent safety, principally from the standpoint of preventing
an uncontrolled hydrocarbon release. We had a rigorous
suite of process safety assessments, so much so that
one contractor noted that the tedious and time-consuming effort to answer all questions we raised during hazard identiﬁcations (HAZIDs) and hazard and operability
analyses (HAZOPs) might impact the delivery schedule.
We decided to stay the course and spend the time to
do it right.”

Atlantis teamwork crucial to success
Sills related that projects like Atlantis are on the boundary between science and engineering, somewhere between what is now considered “normal” deepwater
project work and an expedition into new frontiers fraught
with the unexpected. “It’s one thing to be a record holder
for one reason or another, but I see that as more of an
indicator of the degree of difﬁculty that the team has
to cope with,” said Sills. “Step changes in size or water
depth in a mega-project like Atlantis are not only risky,
they bring with them things that by deﬁnition people
haven’t encountered before.”
To prepare for and cope with such challenges, the
Atlantis team developed a reputation for exceptional
www.bp.com/us

planning. From day one they implemented and developed a deep respect for the discipline of project controls
and used it for incredibly detailed planning, scheduling,
estimating and performance analysis. “Still, you have
to be able to handle the unexpected because you can’t
plan for and predict everything,” said Sills. “If you have
a well-integrated team that communicates across functions and is ﬂexible and innovative in the face of problems, you are best prepared to handle the problems that
certainly will arise when you’re pushing the envelope of
what is possible in deepwater operations.”
Many organizations across a variety of industries discuss issues through silos and top-down management
and other structures that impede successful communication and delivery of business results. The Atlantis team
was the antithesis of that, fostering a style of leadership
and cooperation that was inclusive, promoted creativity
and individuality, recognized exceptional performance,
and avoided micromanagement. “We were able to attract some of the best talent in BP and the industry to
the Atlantis team,” Sills said. “We had exceptional leaders and team members at all levels of the organization.
I am extremely proud of their innovations and resiliency
in the face of incredible and sometimes seemingly insurmountable challenges. Above all, they produced ingenious solutions that have become the hallmark of the
success of Atlantis to this day.”

Working Together to Capture the Prize
“The Atlantis project is a
key piece of the foundation for BHP Billiton Petroleum’s worldwide oil
and gas portfolio. Overcoming the signiﬁcant
technical challenges to create this large
business is an accomplishment that we
are very proud to be part of.”
– J. Michael Yeager,
Chief Executive BHP Billiton Petroleum

I

n the mid 1990s, BHP Billiton Petroleum made the
decision to enter the deepwater Gulf of Mexico
(GoM) at the same time BP was looking for a partner

to drill its Neptune prospect, which would later lead to
the discovery of Atlantis. BHP Billiton not only joined BP
in the Neptune test well, but was able to establish a larger area of mutual interest around the Neptune prospect
area. The move signiﬁcantly positioned the company as
a major player in the ultradeepwater GoM, leading to
signiﬁcant developments at Atlantis, together with BHPoperated facilities Neptune and Shenzi.
As a nonoperator with 44 percent interest in Atlantis,
BHP Billiton Petroleum lent expertise in areas where the
company felt it could add value, contributing team members to the BP-led project team and working to develop
subsurface design and well placement. The experience
working on one of the most complex and, at the time,
most ambitious deepwater projects in the world led to
BHP Billiton’s ability to achieve substantial growth in the
Gulf of Mexico.
The company has garnered technical and commercial
learnings from Atlantis, speciﬁcally in the areas of subsurface interpretation, facility design practices, regulatory

approval management, and contract strategy and management. The ﬁeld remains one of the largest in the world, and
it presented many challenges that were eventually overcome. From the integration of the hull and topsides, manifold replacement, service vessel waiting lists, hurricanes
and more, each solution to an obstacle became part of a
playbook for future company projects in the GoM.

Atlantis and beyond
Atlantis stands as a key part of BHP Billiton’s business.
On a global scale, Atlantis greatly added to the company’s
global production. In ﬁscal year 2007, BHP Billiton Petroleum produced on average 320,000 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) a day. The company will soon produce on aver-

age over 500,000 boe a day. That number is expected to
grow as more projects come on stream.
This achievement is only possible because of the
strong relationship and trust developed with BP over the
course of the Atlantis project. The ingenuity and attention
in working together on what some has previously called
a “technological impossibility” set the stage for sustainable success.
BHP Billiton Petroleum continues to work with BP to
optimize development and contribute in areas where the
company feels it can add value. The goal of BHP Billiton
Petroleum is to work with BP to ensure every barrel is
produced as cost effectively as possible with zero harm
to people and the environment.

s subsurface resource manager, Pramod Singh
sees the two dozen members of his team as stewards of the Atlantis resource base.
In addition to leading the initial evaluation of the potential resource opportunities in Atlantis, Singh’s team
was also responsible for preparing the development plan
and moving it forward. Once online, the team has been
accountable for understanding the performance of the
reservoir, including any changes, optimizations or adjustments to ensure that Atlantis achieves the best performance possible.
The team includes professionals from a variety of
specialties, including reservoir engineers, production
engineers, geologists, geophysicists, petrophysicists,
and petrotechnologists. He notes that the Atlantis leadership team was able to convince senior management
of the value of bringing on skilled people early in the
development process and then keep them together as
a cohesive team.

under salt, and some projects sometimes fall short later.”
In fact, he notes, Atlantis is one of the very few, if not
the only project where BP sanctioned a subproject (the
North Flank) even before it had brought online the original sanction area. “That was a big vote of conﬁdence in
both Atlantis and the Atlantis team.”
Connie Bargas, reservoir engineering advisor, says an
important part of the role of the subsurface team for Atlantis was to try to paint as complete a picture of the Atlantis Field as possible and get a range of the potential.
“Our job from a subsurface standpoint was to bracket the range around the resource size and the number
of wells that would be needed,” Bargas says. “We knew
that Atlantis had a big footprint, and we thought we
would need quite a few wells to produce the ﬁeld.
“We also anticipated that we would have to inject
water, but one of the uncertainties was how much energy we would get naturally. And one of the risk mitigation options was to plan on water injection.”

Understanding Atlantis
Singh describes Atlantis as a huge and
complex ﬁeld that from a resource base
perspective requires a variety of highly
technical subsurface skills.
Initially overshadowed by other fields
in the Gulf of Mexico, Singh believes Atlantis benefited from the situation.
“The Atlantis resource base was recognized, but the project wasn’t thought
of as the largest ﬁeld or the one with the
most potential,” he says. “We beneﬁted
by being able to work as one team with
Mad Dog and gained a lot of experience
and mutual learnings. Also, because Atlantis was not in the spotlight as much,
we could do a lot of good groundwork and
solid evaluation of the resource base.”

The team also spent time looking at whether

would have a big impact on costs.
“But the technical issues led us quickly to

“We eventually decided on a semisubmersible instead of a spar for several reasons, including the fact that we would likely have upwards of
20 wells—and probably more. That would have

Commercial teams, gave the group a variety of options
that could be evaluated for space and payload.
“While some speciﬁc items may never be needed,
we have given ourselves a lot of ﬂexibility,” Bargas says.
It would have been easy to increase the size of various
pieces, but the team made a conscious decision to give
future teams the ﬂexibility to add capacity or equipment.
The Subsurface Team also worked to make the design tie-back friendly. The decision has paid off, Bargas
said. “We actually ended up taking advantage of it quite
quickly since we added a ﬁfth manifold to the north.

Depletion plan
Atlantis has a number of reservoirs that are stacked,
so one of the challenges that the Subsurface Team addressed was where to start, including the more standard practice of starting at the bottom and working one’s
way up the reservoir.
“We decided to start with something in the middle.
We selected what we call the M-54 and M-55 zones for
the reasons that they have the best quality sand, the best
quality oil and the most oil that we found in any of the
Atlantis reservoirs,” Bargas says. “They provide the real
foundation, but we also wanted to leave ourselves the
ability to produce both above and below these two.”
The initial depletion plans call for future sidetracks
and recompletions as well as deepenings to ﬁnish out
development of the M-54 and M-55 zones and other

sands above and below.
“We will reuse well slots and well bores where possible to get double duty, but we know that some work
will be easier than others,” Bargas notes.

Water injection
In planning for water injection, Bargas says under one
scenario Atlantis could need water injection in late 2008.
The production chemists and subsurface teams are
working together to plan the program. “It’s important to
do a good job and get the right chemistry. Water injection
involves the entire project and will depend on production
data, so we will be carefully monitoring production.”

Teamwork
For the Subsurface Team, Atlantis represented an opportunity to capitalize on their joint experiences on the Na
Kika Field.
“We already had good working relationships. One
of the lessons that I learned while working on Na Kika
is the importance of working well together as a team,”
Bargas says. “We brought that learning to Atlantis,
along with the ability to trust each other and enjoy the
project together.”
Bargas also underscored the importance of communications. “At the time, it can feel like things are taking longer than is needed, but I think you actually save time, you
don’t have to redo it since you are really communicating.”

OBS nodes

Seismic nodes reap rewards from atop
the ocean bottom
“The Atlantis Ocean Bottom Seismic
(OBS) node survey marked BP’s ﬁrst
deployment of this cutting-edge technology. It was the largest and deepest
OBS survey anywhere in the world,
and it garnered a lot of industry attention, and for good reason. The results
were quite remarkable.”
– Pramod Singh,
BP Atlantis Subsurface Manager

A

lthough careful in producing of “serial number
one” items, the BP-operated Atlantis project team
decided the time and location were right to pioneer the use of Ocean Bottom Seismic (OBS) nodes. OBS
nodes, which are self-contained seismic recorders placed
directly on the bottom of the seabed to collect and store
seismic data, mitigate many of the problems encountered
with towed-array seismic data collected near the ocean surface. “Typical deepwater Gulf of Mexico seismic operations
include a vessel towing long cables, known as streamers, in
the water above the area being surveyed,” said John Howie,
BP’s Atlantis New Wells and Reservoir Description Team
Leader. “Hydrophones on the streamers collect reﬂections
of sound energy generated when an airgun ﬁres a shot (a
pulse of high pressure compressed air) into the water.”
With water above the Atlantis Field well over a mile
deep, and much of the ﬁeld sitting beneath a complex
cover of salt, it became obvious to the team that a new
method to collect seismic data was needed to better see
what lay beneath the surface. “The data sets collected
by using towed streamers were processed in many ways
using BP’s state-of-the art technology, but we still weren’t
able to get satisfactory visibility,” added Howie. “The very
nature of towed streamers is that they are linear; they
produce what’s referred to as ‘narrow azimuth’ recordings, which didn’t meet our needs.”
Fortunately, BP’s Exploration and Production Technology
Group (EPTG), recognizing the growing need for improved
subsalt imaging for company operations around the world,
had begun an effort in 2001 to explore improved methods
to recover such information. Their conclusion: seismic data
acquired from many directions around a reservoir with
“wide-azimuth” technology would markedly improve sub-

www.bp.com/us

salt imaging compared to the linear towed-array methods
commonly in use.
This ﬁnding would shift into high gear the effort to
design, build, test and deploy a wide-azimuth acquisition
system that employed self-contained OBS nodes, nodes
that could be accurately and safely deployed in a complex
subsea environment such as Atlantis. Jerry Beaudoin has
been the project manager in EPTG responsible for delivering this revolutionary acquisition system. BP worked with
several companies to conduct exhaustive prototype and
sea-trail tests of different OBS node designs. Following
prequaliﬁcation of potential vendors and careful evalution
of proposals submitted, based on Health, Safety, Security and Environmental (HSSE), commercial, quality and
delivery-capability criteria, BP selected Fairﬁeld Industries
for ﬁeld-scale OBS acquisition at Atlantis. In essence it
would move BP’s OBS node wide-azimuth application vision from the “lab” to “reality.”
The OBS nodes were built and warehouse tested, in
which they were repeatedly charged and discharged and
checked for operability and consistent battery life (about
30 days). Whether in the warehouse or on the seismic
vessel, the nodes were kept on charge, a single light indicating if they were in the “alive” mode. By design, the
data collected by the node was stored and still recoverable even if the battery died while still on the sea ﬂoor.

Node handling and deployment
Some 900 nodes were constructed, each weighing about
200 pounds and equipped with a four-component recording
system consisting of three perpendicular geophones and a
hydrophone. A contract vessel with two remote operated
vehicles (ROVs) was used to transport and install the nodes
on location. BP placed the 900 nodes over the Sigsbee Escarpment for a seismic shoot then retrieved them, downloaded the data collected, and placed about 700 nodes
below the escarpment for a second shoot. Throughout the
process, safety and protecting the environment were preeminent considerations. In preparation for the survey, Fairﬁeld aligned their HSSE management system in response
to BP’s requirements and encouragement.
BP recognized early-on that these large 200-pound
cylinders, much like a heavy barrel, required a careful

OBS nodes
large number of the nodes,” added Howie. When loaded,
a containment basket held about 25 nodes. It was moved
near an ROV, and from it 10 nodes then were loaded into
the ROV’s basket. Two very large work-class ROVs were
used for these challenging tasks, one stationed amidship
and one at the stern of the vessel.
The vessel crane system then would lift the fully
loaded ROV, weighing well over one ton, over the side
into the water and lower it as deep as 7,000 feet to reach
the target area. Onboard the ROV, a suction-cup arm was
used to retrieve a node from the ROV basket and place
it on the sea ﬂoor; then the ROV would lift off and ﬂy to
the next location as a conveyor-belt system moved the
next node in place to be lifted. “Through repetition we
became proﬁcient enough to safely install about 30-40
nodes a day,” said Howie. “For the ﬁrst time we used a
hydroacoustic-aided inertial navigation HAIN system. The
HAIN system helped us place each node with a +/- 2-3
meters accuracy on a regular grid with about 400 meters
distance between each node. In nearly 7,000 feet of water, this is incredible positioning accuracy.”

up to 30 degrees. “When viewed from the larger scale of
the entire grid of 900 nodes, we were able to ﬁnd what
amounted to ‘ﬂat spots’ to properly place the nodes to
give us the seismic data we needed.”

Node data and recovery

“The OBS nodes are sometimes referred to as ‘dumb’
nodes because there is no communication with them,”
added Howie. He feels that term is a bit of a misnomer
because each node has an impressive ﬂash memory capable of recording 2-millisecond samples throughout its
30-day battery life. “It took about 30 days to lay the node
“patch.” So a few days following the start of node deployment, the separate source vessel began shooting over
the top of the nodes. The progress of the ROV vessel
deploying nodes and the source vessel has to be carefully choreographed to make sure the right shots are ﬁred
when the node is in place and still “alive.” By the time
we’d placed the 900 nodes, we immediately returned to
the edge of the patch where we had started and began
picking them up,” said Howie. “Since our ﬁrst outing with
the nodes on Atlantis, their battery
life has improved to 60 days, a key
enhancement considering the time it
takes to place and retrieve the large
number of nodes needed for a ﬁeld
the size of Atlantis.”

OBS nodes
the Atlantis Field. This seismic survey conducted in close
proximity to the GSF Development Driller II (DD2) was possible because the small seismic source vessel could easily
maneuver in the vicinity, unlike a vessel with towed arrays
that could become tangled with nearby vessels and objects
in the water. “Towed-array seismic operations would have
been more difﬁcult if not impossible as close to the DD2 as
we were able to work,” said Howie. “We planned for both
the DD2 and the Atlantis production quarters platform to
be nearby when we conducted acquisition over the OBS
nodes, and this new technology paid off.” The OBS node

was complete by March 2006.

tion are occurring. Four D may also help identify isolated
areas and provide opportunities for future wells.
“We’re still developing an understanding of how to
fully use OBS nodes,” said Howie. “We see the potential
for a number of applications worldwide for nodes, many
outside of sub salt imaging. In particular, in places with
extensive platform infrastructure, the nodes have the capability of seamless acquisition where it would be very
difﬁcult with towed streamers.”
OBS nodes now represent one of several technologies
in the BP toolkit for imaging beneath salt. Sub salt imaging is a key technology leadership area for BP with an important intellectual property strategy. In the wide-azimuth
acquisition area, besides the seabed positioned nodes, BP
has also been the industry leader in the implementation of
wide-azimuth towed streamer (WATS) technology. WATS
provides the capability of collecting large swaths of wideazimuth data for sub salt exploration objectives.

OBS nodes increase the potential to illuminate parts of the
subsurface beneath the salt to determine what hydrocarbons might be there. The wide-azimuth seismic data collected by the nodes is particularly advantageous
when shooting over complex salt formations because the shape of the salt formation isn’t necessarily known. However, a step change in technology
and some innovative solutions to data processing
were required to efﬁciently and accurately process
the large amount of data collected.

of the BP High Performance Computing Center

Unlocking the secrets of Atlantis
Planning and teamwork prove keys to success for drilling
and completions teams

A

sk the teams involved in designing and managing the drilling and completions program for Atlantis about their experience and several key themes
quickly emerge: the detailed and comprehensive planning
that went into developing the drilling and completions programs; the close working relationships, coordination and
integration among the different teams; and the unique capabilities of the GSF Development Driller II (DD2).
During the program, the BP team would need all
three—extensive planning, exceptional teamwork and
world-class equipment—to successfully overcome all of
the challenges to unlocking the tremendous potential of
the Atlantis Field.

Planning for success
From day one, each of the teams worked together to
put a massive plan together and schedule it all out, says
Jonathan Sprague, wells delivery manager for Atlantis.
“We also put [the schedule] in pictures and images
to help everyone understand and take interest in the
plan. It was a powerful tool. We gave it to all the teams
and the DD2 crew. The more people saw it, the more
they took an interest in it.”
Allen Pere, Drilling Team Leader for Atlantis, says his
team invested about four months of work in planning
each well’s drilling program.
“The Drilling Team worked very closely with the Subsurface Team in designing the correct well path, evaluating seismic data, the geologic model, where faults were
located and where we needed to place the well,” Pere
says. “We looked at multiple well paths and ranked our
options based on which one would provide the most
value to the project.”
“The operations roadmap that the team put in place
to help coordinate the simultaneous operations was a
remarkable piece of work,” says Mick Leary, wells manager for the Gulf of Mexico for Development and Production. “I have never seen anything as planned and orchestrated to the level of detail as with this project. And
it has served us well, especially when external forces
required us to change. We were able to quickly assess
and reprioritize or resequence, almost without a hitch.”
The team also invested a lot of time on completion
planning and procedures.
“Our team focused on making sure that the wells piece
did not become a critical path to deliver ﬁrst oil,” Leary says.
“They have overcome a number of obstacles as we have
gone through the process of delivering this project.”

“We developed detailed plans on how we would execute completions, and then we incorporated lessons
learned after every completion,” says Bruce Rogers,
completions operations leader for Atlantis. “We included
feedback from everyone involved, from the drillers and
engineers to roughnecks and service company personnel. If there was a suggestion on how to do it better, we
reviewed it and assessed whether it was something that
should be included in the future.”

DD2: a world-class tool
In many ways, the DD2 is both a real and symbolic representation of the program’s vision and innovation.
Selection of the DD2 involved a large number of considerations from a variety of Atlantis teams.
Interest in a vessel like the DD2 was driven in part
by the decision to go with wet trees for completions,
says Rogers.
“Once we made the decision to go with wet trees,
the team recognized that it would need a rig that could
do development work,” Rogers says. “Wet trees have
a lot of challenges in terms of access to the trees. You
have to have lot of quality control at the tree in order to
stay functional for the life of the well. This means that
we would need a ﬂoating rig to access the tree and that
we would have to rely on ROVs for a lot of functions.”
As part of the selection process, the team looked at
different rigs and developments around the world and then
developed speciﬁcations for the drilling rig and vessel.
“Our ﬁrst exposure to the GSF Development Driller II
was at the Offshore Technology Conference when it was
in late design stage,” Rogers says.
With a huge subsea infrastructure yet to be installed,
the team recognized that it needed a rig that could do
subsea installations completely ofﬂine, if possible, while
also drilling or completing a well.
“We were asking more from a rig than has ever been
done in the Gulf of Mexico,” Rogers says, noting that
until the DD2, the primary focus for rigs in the Gulf was
on drilling rather than completions.
“With a typical deepwater rig, you’re drilling for years
before you do completions so earlier deepwater rigs often hadn’t done many completions,” Rogers says. “On
the Atlantis project, we’d spend at least 50 percent of
our time doing completions, so it became an important
consideration.“
Since BP had planned to batch set its initial producing wells, the remaining producing wells would be done

Drilling and completions
with the riser down.
“That meant that the drilling activities were only going to last 30 to 40 days, and our completion activities
were scheduled for 25 to 45 days per well. So we’re
spending at least half our time on completion activity.”

More than a drilling rig
Craig Wright, well site leader for Atlantis, is quick to point
out that the DD2 is “above and beyond a drilling rig. It’s
rightfully named, it’s a development vessel.”
“You could have the main center drilling, bottom hole
assemblies going on the auxiliary rotary, two ROVs on bottom, the winch putting a jumper in place, and unloading a
crew boat using a crane,” Wright says.
“The auxiliary rotary can be used to feed the main
well drill center so that we minimize downtime, or we can
use it to do things off the critical path to get ready for an
operation on the main well center,” Wright points out.
The No. 7 winch is a converted anchor winch with
10,000 feet of nonrotating wire that can be used to run
all of the subsea components, including jumpers, trees
and manifolds, concurrently with activities at the main
well center.
In terms of completions, the dynamically positioned

DD2 also provides the ﬂexibility to maneuver the vessel
as needed in order to change rig headings. “We can do a
move in 10 to 15 minutes,” Wright says.
“If you look at what we have been able to accomplish
with this rig, we’ve demonstrated an ability to do some
things that haven’t been done in the past, and now we
have the opportunity to use this experience in other parts
of the world,” Leary adds.
“This type of rig gives us another tool in our kit to consider in our planning efforts as we look to do other projects in the Gulf of Mexico and areas around the world.”

DD2 advantages
Selection of the DD2 provided ofﬂine capabilities for
both the drilling and completions teams.
“On the drilling side, we can make up casing strings
and rack them,” Rogers explains. “While on the completion
side, we can use the auxiliary rotary to make up all of our
downhole equipment assemblies as well as our production
tubing and stands and then rack them back to be ready.”
For example, Rogers says the team can run a subsea
test tree to land the tubing hangar. “We can make it up
ofﬂine and test it and then transfer it over to the tubing
hangar when we’re ready. That helps us avoid a lot of

potential downtime.”
Running main and auxiliary rotaries at the same time
also enables the crew to keep the main rotary busy as
much as possible.

Fluid-handling capabilities
Another important consideration was the DD2’s ﬂuid
handling system, which features separate tanks and systems for drilling mud ﬂuids and brine completion ﬂuids.
“Most rigs share the pits, which requires cleaning
between drilling and completion,” Rogers notes. Having separate systems provides more ﬂexibility and helps
prevent completion ﬂuids from becoming contaminated.
It also means the team can have completion ﬂuids on
board and ready to do a riser displacement even while
drilling is being completed, Rogers points out.
Taking advantage of the opportunity to provide input
into the ﬁnal design of the DD2, Rogers says his team
recommended adding a deck for the subsea test reel
for umbilicals and designed a riser bay deck for other
completion equipment.
“The riser bay deck is movable when we’re running
the riser and then use the space for other completion
equipment,” Rogers says. The deck for the subsea test
reel lets the team keep the reel on location, helping reduce handling and costs.
When the DD2 was brought on board, it was a new
rig that had never worked in the ﬁeld. Getting a new rig up
and running efﬁciently can be a challenge, Leary stated.
“There has been a mixed track record on the efﬁciency of new rigs when they ﬁrst start working,” Leary
notes. “While DD2 had its challenges in getting it up to
speed, it was remarkable how the team adjusted on the
ﬂy to those challenges and reprioritized and moved the
schedule around to keep us on the path to ﬁrst oil. They
overcame some big challenges.”

were able to resolve them. There was initial pushback
from the Drilling Team, for example, on running long
strings and how wells were suspended, Rogers stated.
“It took more planning and effort by the Drilling
Team, but after doing a few they liked it and found it to
be better. And it’s a much more efﬁcient way for us to
get a jump start on completion.”
Rogers also points out that the management team
approached the Atlantis project differently than others
by bringing in both drilling and completion teams from
the very beginning.
“We started looking at the project development with
completion activities in mind from the start. We worked
with the drilling teams on the design of the wells and
the casing strings to deliver the rates that our production team wanted. There was a lot of thought up-front to
deliver the ﬂow rates that we wanted.”
The coordinated effort also meant that the two teams
had the opportunity to design a work string that would
work for both drilling and completion activities.
“For completions, we wanted a plastic internal coating that would hold up to abrasion during frac jobs to
minimize the amount of scale. We also wanted gas-tight
connections, and metal-to-metal seals for frac operations since we would be doing high-pressure frac jobs,”
Rogers says.
The team also was able to make the case for buying
the work string and landing string for the rig itself so
that they could use it for every completion instead of
renting it out.
Sprague notes that Project Leader Greg Sills was instrumental in instilling a sense of commitment among
employees to the project. “You have to care about success and care about other people on the project. Because we cared, we went the extra mile to communicate.” As a result, the team never fell apart whenever it
had challenges, Sprague stated.

Team Atlantis
Another hallmark of the Atlantis project, Rogers stated,
is that it has not operated as separate teams with separate goals.
“We had common goals. That’s the secret to our success. We all understand what our goals are.“
Sprague agrees, noting, “I’ve always tried to put
what’s best for the project, in terms of value, ﬁrst; and
I’ve given my team the space and the empowerment to
freely work with any other team to get the best solution
for the project.”
While acknowledging that may not always be best
for the drilling and completions side of the team, “at the
end of the day if it’s adding more value to the project,
that’s what’s important,” Sprague says.
When there were differences of opinion, the teams

Teamwork and leadership
“When you look at a project like this, the leadership has
a major role to play. Greg Sills has been with this from
the beginning. It’s been remarkable that we’ve been
able to hold the core of the team together since the
beginning in 2001 and through the development period.
That’s a long time to hold a core team together for any
company,” Leary notes.
“People are proud to put Atlantis on their Curriculum.
They are proud of being part of a team that is delivering
a world-class project,” Leary says.
“Everyone has learned from the Atlantis experience.
We have taken people with pieces of knowledge and expertise and molded them together to collectively deliver a
great project. It is really a remarkable collection of exper-

tise that was brought together for Atlantis,” Leary says.
The Atlantis project also has proved to be an outstanding development opportunity.
Louise Jacobsen Plutt, for example, had the opportunity to serve as a drilling engineer on Atlantis and be
involved in planning and executing drilling operations.
Compared with her previous experience in the relatively simpler onshore Wamsutter gas ﬁelds, Jacobsen
Plutt says the Atlantis project was a unique opportunity
to be involved in the total process of planning and drilling
some of Atlantis’ ﬁrst wells.
“We were all working on the same goals to get ﬁrst
oil, but we also understood that some things may come
before drilling,” Jacobsen Plutt says. “Unlike other projects where drilling is the primary activity on a rig, this
requires more coordination and accommodating other
teams, and we were able to do that quite well.”

Productivity
The combination of planning, teamwork and world-class
equipment also paid big dividends in productivity.
Sprague says Atlantis has been able to achieve one of
the best completion performance records in the industry.
“We originally thought there would be 21 days of
downtime on drilling and completions, but instead it’s
been virtually hours,” says Sprague. “The key was good
planning, scheduling and communicating continually. As

www.bp.com/us

a result, we were able to shift priorities as the project
dictated rather than as one team dictated.”
Sprague notes that Atlantis also had one of the lowest records for nonproductive time (NPT) and expects its
drilling performance to be in the ﬁrst quartile on future
wells.
“We may suffer a little on drilling time, but we are
able to make up for it on completion and overall delivery,” Sprague says.
After the initial four wells were drilled, Pere’s team
conducted a detailed analysis of NPT during the drilling
program and focused on ways to eliminate or mitigate it.
“When we did our analysis, we realized that one of the
biggest sources of NPT was in obtaining appraisal data using wireline logging,” says Pere. Working with the service
provider, the team began using a new technology to take
formation pressures on drilling tools using logging-whiledrilling (LWD) tools instead of wireline management.
“The advantage is that while drilling the well we
are obtaining logging data instantly. After we reach total depth, we can obtain formation pressures and then
come out of the hole and run production casing. It enables us to reduce the process by one trip,” Pere says.
“In addition, in an effort to optimize its performance
during well completions, two completion engineers were
assigned to the rig crew during operations. The experience paid big dividends,” says Terry Miglicco, Atlantis

Drilling and completions
Completion Team leader.
“Because of their experience with the operations team,
our average NPT was about 18 percent, which is excellent
when you consider the complexity of the completions.”
By comparison, the industry average is 30-plus percent
NPT for smart well completions in the Gulf of Mexico.
“We estimate it saved us about 29 rig days on our
well completions,” Miglicco says.

Complex ﬂowback operations
Another important example of the value of detailed planning and teamwork for Atlantis involved ﬂowback testing
of the initial wells performed in the fall of 2007.
“We invested a year in preparing and planning for
ﬂowback operations,” says Miglicco. “We conducted a
thorough series of HAZOP reviews and detailed planning for every aspect of the operation.”
Communications was a big key, especially considering the number of teams and vessels involved.
“The ﬂowback operation required six vessels: the DD2,
two tugs managing the DD2, a hose handler, the barge and
a chaser boat to ensure that no other vessel encroached on
the 500-meter exclusion zone,” Miglicco says.
The team developed robust contingency plans, including emergency disconnects from the barge.
The ﬁrst three wells were ﬂowed back to a moored
barge. During the tests, the wells reached a maximum
ﬂow rate of 17,000 bpd.

In addition, the team decided to run production logs
concurrently with the ﬂowback tests.
“The production logs gave us great insight. We thought
the ﬁrst completion was perfect, and if we hadn’t tested
them, we would have done all the others the same way,”
says Jerry Sharp, PQ Base Management Team leader. “By
doing ﬂowbacks, we were able to understand some problems downhole that we weren’t aware of.”
By adjusting the program and changing the perforation strategy, the wells are now coming in at top quartile
in performance.
The planning and extra testing paid big dividends,
Sharp stated, and helped protect a signiﬁcant amount
of production capacity for both the initial wells and the
ones that followed.
“At the end of those three ﬂowbacks we had a very
good completion design that would have a tremendous
impact on our operations,” Miglicco says.

Pushing the envelope
Another hallmark of the Atlantis project’s drilling and completion program was the willingness of service providers
to develop new techniques or tools.
Halliburton, for example, developed a new perforating
gun just for Atlantis, Rogers notes. The team wanted to
be able to have large-diameter holes with low debris to
maximize the ﬂow rate without jeopardizing the well bore
from debris.
Halliburton developed
an 18-shot- per-foot big hole
charge. The new seven-inch
gun “gave us everything
we wanted,” with one-inchdiameter perforating holes.
Rogers notes that, initially, designers didn’t think
they could meet the speciﬁcation, “but they kept
persevering and were able
to deliver it.”
The team also decided
that, wherever possible,
it wanted ﬁt-for-purpose
equipment, even if it meant
asking different contractors
to work together.
“That’s exactly what happened with Schlumberger,
Baker Hughes and Weatherford when we asked them
to develop our sand control
system,” Rogers says.

Subsea

Atlantis subsea team ready for the unexpected
“We always thought that the subsea
team had two customers—the operations and subsurface teams. Maybe
it’s a mistake if you don’t consider
management as one of your customers, but that’s the way I lead my teams.
We put together a ‘fuzzy’ organization
in which people were assigned specific roles and responsibilities, but were
encouraged to work proactively across
functions to ﬁll gaps when they appeared. The results were great! When
the subsea team was faced with a
problem,we tackled it together. In the
end, that made management and the
entire Atlantis team very satisﬁed with
our performance.”

trees, a semisubmersible production drilling quarters and
some concepts not even in the books,” said Hall. Spars
had advantages, but with the limited number of wells going to the surface, a spar could limit the upside potential
the project had to offer. At the early stages of the project,
the subsurface team’s evaluation of the reservoir had a
lot of uncertainty because so much of the ﬁeld is subsalt.
“We were concerned that selecting a spar might limit
our production options, and that selecting a production
drilling quarters might restrict access to the drilling center, already crowded by its proximity to the Sigsby Escarpment,” said Hall. The team tried to make “apples to
apples” comparisons on concept selection, cost assumptions and production opportunities, and the result was to
go forward with a subsea development.

Decisions based on experience
The team decided on a subsea development with a
stand-alone production quarters semisubmersible, remote subsea wells and a long-term development rig.
Hall and Atlantis Subsea Team leader John Hughes both
had experience working on the Amoco Liuhua project
in the South China Sea. There, a dedicated vessel was
used for drilling and other work. “Gene and I had unique
learnings from Liuhua, so we relied on that wealth of

B

P and co-owner BHP Billiton had a lot to look forward to when the Atlantis project subsea layout
was envisioned. The design concept wasn’t unprecedented, but it certainly was a bit unusual for the
Gulf of Mexico. Reaching consensus on which way to
proceed took tremendous planning, a reliance on past
experience, and a thorough understanding of what challenges and opportunities might lie ahead in the difﬁcult
environment of the Atlantis Field.
Rising to the occasion was a mixed team of experts
with varied levels of experience in subsea, subsurface,
facilities, drilling and completions. “We evaluated many
different concepts,” said Gene Hall, BP’s subsea manager for Atlantis. “At the time BP had announced four
major projects: Holstein and Mad Dog, which were
spars, Thunder Horse, which was a production and drilling quarters semisubmersible, and the Mardi Gras pipeline to interconnect them.” Atlantis would come in as
the ﬁfth major BP-operated project in the Gulf of Mexico,
and the extra time afforded by being last in line would
enable careful consideration of all options.

knowledge to provide input on the decision-making process for Atlantis,” said Hughes.
The rig concept team quickly arrived at the conclusion that the vessel should be much more than a drilling
and completions platform. “The team decided it should
be a construction vessel as well, which would require
us to look on the market to ﬁnd the right vessel, or have
one built by the right company that could modify it to
suit our multiuse needs,” Hall added.
According to Ryan Malone, Atlantis Subsea Deputy
manager, some key points of the Atlantis development
concept would have major impact on the path chosen.
“With the host platform moored two miles from the drill
center and the round-the-clock availability of a dedicated
vessel, we could easily work directly over the drill center,” said Malone. “This would result in fewer simultaneous operations and would preclude the need to move
the host platform to gain access to the ﬁeld.” At a time
in the global energy industry when the limited pool of
vessels soon would become difﬁcult if not impossible to
charter, a dedicated modular drilling unit with added-on
capabilities would prove to be a prophetic choice.

Modiﬁcations to ﬁt subsea needs
The rig team was consumed with the process of getting
the right rig with the right equipment and selecting the
speciﬁc alterations necessary to make it the proper longterm development vessel. Modiﬁcations to winches,
extra quarters to accommodate the people needed to
execute a larger scope of work, and space to stow and
operate two large work-class remotely operated vehicles
(ROVs) were part of this effort. Global Santa Fe would be
the company selected, and their newly constructed dynamically positioned GSF Development Driller II (DD2)
would prove to be the vessel that could be outﬁtted to
deliver what the Atlantis team needed.
Modiﬁcations to the subsea kits included sizing
them to ﬁt through the moon pool aboard the DD2 and
restricting their weight so rig cranes could lift and land
them and other subsea components onboard the DD2
for testing. Of particular note, the Atlantis manifolds do
not contain hydraulically actuated valves linked to a control system. All valves in the original design were ROV
actuated, which kept the process simple, reduced interfaces and increased reliability, and kept down the weight

of the manifolds, making it possible for the DD2 to install them. Thousands of pounds of weight were saved
without the normal valve actuators.
“Very early on, the subsea team decided that with
the proper modiﬁcations and equipment, the majority of
the subsea components could be installed off the DD2,”
said Hughes. “We established the goal to do as much
subsea construction work from the DD2 as possible. It
was a unique situation to be able to achieve so much
work from a drilling rig and not impact drilling and completion operations to a signiﬁcant level.”

Subsea team tackles
large scope and scale
The Atlantis subsea team was multidisciplined and was
responsible for fabrication and delivery of components,
integrating with the broader Atlantis team to manage
interfaces among drilling, hookup, commissioning and
operations, and blending their scope of subsea work as
seamlessly as possible with other teams to help achieve
key project milestones.
On Atlantis, the subsea team is responsible for the
subsea trees, manifolds, jumpers to connect the manifolds to the trees and pipelines, ﬂowlines, umbilicals to
control the subsea wells and other subsea control systems, the ROVs on the DD2, interface equipment on the
DD2 used to test and run the equipment, all gear on
the PQ required to pull risers and for coiled tubing operations for gas lift in the riser, and the control systems
for subsea wells. “Our responsibilities are mechanical,
electronic, hydraulic and in diverse locations, so it’s a lot
to manage,” said Hall.
The fabrication aspects of subsea operations effort
were larger than some might expect. They included all
the trees, manifolds, jumpers, pipeline end terminations
(PLETs), pipeline end manifolds (PLEMs), and what
some called a project within a project, an extensive
ﬂowline and riser system. “We’ve built and installed one
of the more complex ﬂowline and riser systems in the
world,” said Malone. The subsea team also designed the
hang-off baskets on the PQ that the risers land into, and
managed or closely supervised several sites onshore
that fabricated the ﬂowlines, the jumpers, the manifolds
and the trees.
The ﬁrst version of the manifolds built for the project, Hughes remarked, were extensively tested on land
before anything was taken offshore. “We conducted
comprehensive tests for about six months by setting
up two complete manifolds and two trees onshore to
mimic what we were going to place on the seaﬂoor. We
put many of the system components together and ran
through system interfaces to look for clashing, and we
trained people and veriﬁed our operating procedures,”

www.bp.com/us

said Hughes. “When subsea kit items were delivered to
the DD2, our team members were able to take them off
the delivery vessel, touch them to the water and send
them to their designated position on the seabed without
delay. We had to be certain that everything would ﬁt and
work as designed, and it did.”
The initial Atlantis subsea architecture reﬂected the
team’s efforts to maximize production while providing
for future growth. Drilling Center 1 (DC1) would be located in some 6,818 feet of water two miles north of
the moored production quarters. It would feature six
ﬂowlines: four for oil and gas production, one for testing and one for water injection. Five manifolds, four for
production and one for injection, would rest on the seabed. Some 20 well slots would include 16 oil and gas
production wells and four injection wells. Six hydraulic
and two electrical umbilicals, 46 jumpers and some 59
ﬂying leads would ﬁnish out the subsea kit. An additional
drill center some two miles to the north was planned for
future development. DD2 would work in place directly
atop DC1.
Arranged in a building-block pattern instead of a ﬁxed
template, the Atlantis subsea architecture allows for future add-ons to handle production growth, and it mitigates well slot losses. “If we’re drilling and going through
various casing sizes and we damage a casing string, we
can move over some distance and drill another hole as
opposed to having to completely eliminate a slot like we’d
have to within a ﬁxed template,” said Malone.
The eight umbilicals are another signiﬁcant portion
of the Atlantis subsea kit. Six are hydraulic and two are
electric and ﬁber optic, which operate the trees. Signals
from the PQ are carried to the trees to operate the valves
through the subsea control modules (SCMs), also known
as a control pods. The SCM relays data on pressures, downhole temperatures and tree temperatures back to the PQ,
and the modules can be used to inject chemicals such as
methanol, parafﬁn inhibitor and low-dosage hydrate inhibitors (LDHI) at the trees and below the seabed.

Subsea selectively employs innovations
The Atlantis subsea kit has some items that set it apart
from other projects. Among those are the hydrate remediation system and the coiled tubing riser system.
Atlantis subsea kits have a hot-water hydrate remediation system on all of the manifolds, jumpers, trees,
PLETs and PLEMs. It consists of one-inch stainless steel
insulated tubing attached on the outside of the pipe
walls. To activate the system, an ROV stabs into a port
and with its electrical pump takes on seawater, heats it
and pumps it slowly through the stainless steel tubing
until the adjacent hydrate melts. “The size of the pump
and heater maintains a steady temperature of about 100

Subsea
degrees Fahrenheit,” said Malone. “That way it dissociates the hydrate slowly to avoid rapid melting and gas
expansion.”
The hot water is in a closed loop system, and its carefully controlled temperature protects against dangerous
expansion of gases when the gas entrained in the hydrate breaks out into bubble form. “If you use an electric heater you can’t be sure of the heat you’ll generate
with the resistor,” said Hall. “The temperature gauges on
the closed loop circulation system indicate the inlet and
outlet temperatures and enable you to balance the hot
water temperature and calculate the energy differential.
Using hydrate association curves, you can manage the
temperature carefully and keep pressures under control
so you don’t rupture a line.”
For the coiled tubing riser system, Hall relied on his
experience on the BP-operated Na Kika project that used
typical valves to keep water and gas for lift separate. “If
you have any seepage at these depths you can potentially wind up with a hydrate problem, even with twovalve protection,” said Hall. The team studied this and
came up with the idea of coiled gas lift tubing inside the
risers, forming a conduit for gas. “The advantage is that
we’re pumping relatively cold gas down a 2-inch coiled
line inside a 10-inch diameter riser; and by the time it
reaches the bottom where hydrates might form, it’s up
to the temperature of the ﬂuids in the riser ﬂow path.”
This design also helped to ﬁght potential hydrates forming in the riser system itself.

percent of the time that plan will hold true. However,
I insist that we must be able to retrieve whatever we
place on the bottom, and we should be able to retrieve
it quickly and safely. We were prepared,” said Hall. Atlantis equipment impacted by the weld issue included the
manifolds, jumpers and production PLETs.
When the weld challenges were discovered, the Atlantis project already had installed four manifolds but no
jumpers were connected. All of the production PLETs
were still on the surface. The Atlantis team had to decide
on a path going forward. Fortunately, Hall’s insistence
that they be able to retrieve what already was in place
soon would pay off.
“Considering the metallurgy concerns and other issues, we made the decision that it would take many
months to determine the root cause of the weld failures,
so we made the proactive decision to remediate all the
affected components and put in place what we deemed
a ‘Phase 1’ system to enable us to achieve our goal of
ﬁrst oil in 2007,” remarked Hall.
The “fuzzy” organization Gene Hall had put in place
years before was about to take one of its most important steps forward for the project. “When we heard
about the welds, we proactively sent all of our running
tools offshore in anticipation we’d be given the order
to pull the manifolds,” said team leader Hughes. “That
was on a Wednesday. The following Monday we had two
manifolds sitting on the dock in Galveston.” The team

philosophy of having a captured asset—the DD2,—and a
plan to use it to retrieve the kits made it possible for the
Atlantis project to meet head-on some potentially showstopping conditions.
If the manifolds had not been designed for retrieval
by the DD2, a heavy-lift vessel would have been required.
The retrieval process would have taken many weeks or
even months to source a heavy-lift vessel, develop the
necessary procedures, and complete the hazard identiﬁcations and hazardous operations reviews to ensure it
could be done safely. “We likely never would have been
able to achieve ﬁrst oil in 2007,” added Hall.
Steel markets were such that the raw materials
needed for forgings and the industrial capacity to machine new components didn’t exist. The Atlantis team
decided they’d have to cannibalize other components
already constructed to build a workable system in time
to meet their schedule. “We pulled up four manifolds,
cannibalized them for workable parts, and made some
major changes to them,” said Malone.
Existing components from PLETs, jumpers and manifolds were sent through an exhaustive process for rework
and put back into unaffected portions of the equipment at

various stages. Hundreds of components had to be cut
up. They included the nine-inch gate valves in the PLETs,
hubs—the upward facing components that the jumpers
land on, connectors—the portions of the jumpers that
latch on to the hub, and many others. Each manifold had
21 valves and 16 hubs that had to be removed.
“We removed all the valves and controls, literally turning the manifolds into simple headers,” added
Hall. “Luckily, we’d decided a long time ago that dual
jumper trees, which allowed going from production to a
test line, were a good idea; and that application allowed
us the ﬂexibility to create the simple Phase 1 manifold
system that we installed after the weld problems were
discovered.” Within a year, the Phase 1 manifolds were
already back on the ocean ﬂoor.
The simpler Phase 1 manifold system is scheduled
to be replaced by the more capable original manifold
designs in the future, possibly in 2010. If the recently
sanctioned North Flank of Atlantis is ready for tie-in by
that time, the subsea team will provide their input on the
decision to suspend production from the ﬁeld and install
the Phase 2 subsea architecture. In the meantime, Atlantis is enjoying much earlier production.

Flow test

Well ﬂowback tests yield important data
“This is the ﬁrst time that any BP team
in the Gulf of Mexico has conducted a
ﬂowback test on wells in deepwater to
a dynamically positioned vessel with a
barge tethered to it to receive produced
oil. The effort required extensive planning
and precise execution. It was well worth
the effort. The Atlantis team beneﬁted
greatly from the successful outcome of
this complex operation.”
– Terry Miglicco,
BP Atlantis Completion Team Leader

T

he Atlantis reservoir, with much of the ﬁeld situated subsalt, required careful consideration by BP
and co-owner BHP-Billiton. The team determined
that after each of the ﬁrst three Atlantis wells was completed, it would need to conduct ﬂowback tests on each
to conﬁrm the completion design and productivity. Any
problems could be corrected immediately and any lessons learned applied to future wells. This was much easier
said than done; about two years of design work, planning,
procurement of specialized equipment and training were
needed before the team was ready to proceed. Their
painstaking efforts proved worthwhile for not only the well
being tested, but for all future wells in the Atlantis ﬁeld.
“It was very important for the team to test the completion design and execution program prior to proceeding with ﬁeld-wide operations,” stated Terry Miglicco,
BP’s Atlantis completions team leader. The location of
Atlantis, about 185 miles south of New Orleans, Louisiana, in about 7,000 feet of water, made this endeavor
an ultimate test of the Atlantis team’s ability to plan and
execute a complex and potentially hazardous marine operation far from shore.

Flowbacks a challenge in deepwater
“We worked together with other Atlantis teams to ﬁgure out the most economical completions that made
the most sense to maximize production,” stated April
Partridge, BP Atlantis completions engineer. “Our initial
wells provided us the opportunity to do ﬂowbacks on a
mixture of single and stacked wells, which would show
us if the assumptions about the reservoir and our choice

24

of completions were correct.” The wells tested were the
DC-143 G5, DC-123 E4, and the DC-124 J (stacked intervals), the later a stacked frac pac to make it the ﬁrst
commingled well in Atlantis.
According to Partridge, one of the longest lead-time
items was identifying what equipment was needed to
safely bring the live hydrocarbons to the surface. “Because of the extreme water depth of Atlantis we had
to use a dynamically positioned vessel, the Transocean’s
GSF Development Driller II (DD2), so we needed the ability to very quickly close off the inner tree string,” added
Partridge. “We had to be able to shut all the valves and
fully isolate the hydrocarbons in case the DD2 had to
disconnect and come off location for some reason.” To
live up to BP’s brand values and health, safety and environmental concerns, all hydrocarbons would have to be
safely contained, with none entering the water.
To accomplish the operation, the DD2 was dynamically positioned on the surface above the wells, with riser and blowout preventer (BOP) stack down and a single
mooring line fair-lead to a 400-foot barge that received
the oil via a large-diameter ﬂoating hose. Two tugs,
one in the specially designed notch on the rear of the
oil barge and another assisting, helped keep the barge,
which had no propulsion system, in proper position relative to the DD2. A chaser vessel kept curiosity seekers
clear of the operations area and a hose-handling vessel
rounded out the ﬂeet of six vessels needed to execute
the ﬂowback tests.
In this case, the term “barge” is somewhat misleading because it was capable of holding some 120,000
barrels of oil and looked more like a ﬂoating production
storage and ofﬂoading (FPSO) vessel. The barge couldn’t
be anchored because of the very deep water above the
ﬁeld, so maneuvering the dynamically positioned DD2
and the barge and tugs in tandem was complicated by
wind, currents and sea state, as well as the need to
keep the ﬂare boom pointed in a safe direction. Motion
analysis was conducted to determine how the barge and
DD2 would react while moored together, with particular
attention paid to prevent pontoon damage to the DD2
from the barge and tugs as well as the large hawser
made of a combination of chain, wire rope and nylon line
that was used to tie-off the barge to the DD2.
A specialized temporary well-test skid provided by
Schlumberger was loaded aboard the DD2 to receive
the oil. This large manifold like device covered almost
the entire deck, and enabled well control at the surface
through choking back pressure. It also provided the

Facilities

World-class Atlantis facilities draw
industry attention

T

here are many superlatives that can be used to
describe the Atlantis production facility. Given its
tremendous size, even oilﬁeld veterans are awestruck when they see photos and drawings, much less
visit the facility for the ﬁrst time.
For the teams involved in building and commissioning the Atlantis facility, however, the words that are used
most often are “world-class” and “state of the art.”
Unlike many other semisubmersibles in use today,
the Atlantis production facility does not have drilling capabilities and was developed as a production quarters
(PQ) facility.
At the time of its installation about 185 miles south of
Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantis PQ or host
facility was the world’s deepest moored ﬂoating oil and
gas production platform designed to process 200,000
barrels of oil and 180 million cubic feet of natural gas
daily. At a water depth of 7,070 feet, the PQ ﬂoats on
four ballasted legs and is moored by 12 tension cables
to the seabed.
The hull fabrication for the PQ platform was undertaken by Daewoo in Okpo, South Korea, while the top-

side production modules were built in Morgan City, Louisiana. Integration of the facilities was at the KOS yard in
Corpus Christi, Texas.
The ﬁeld’s ﬁrst set of wells are being drilled by a
separate vessel, the Transocean’s GSF Development
Driller II (DD2) at a drill center to the north of the PQ. The
wells ﬂow into subsea manifolds and from there ﬂowlines carry the oil, gas and water to the PQ where they
are processed. After processing, the hydrocarbons are
moved through the Caesar oil and Cleopatra gas pipeline
systems—part of the Mardi Gras system—to existing
shelf and onshore interconnections.
The Atlantis PQ quarters consists of three 5,000-ton
modules for: production, compression and generation. The
production module houses all of the equipment associated
with oil production, including separators and pumps. The
compression module houses all of the gas compression
and treatment facilities. The generation module includes
three turbine generators and a variety of utility systems.
The turbine generators are dual-fueled, enabling the facility
to run on diesel initially until natural gas production from
the ﬁeld is sufﬁcient to power the generators.
“On October 6,
2007, we opened our
ﬁrst well,” stated Rickey
Harrison, offshore installation manager for Atlantis. “Production from
well DC-111 was 20,000
barrels per day (bpd) and
14 million cubic feet of
gas a day (mmscfd). By
mid-January 2008, we
opened six wells and
were producing more
than 110,000 bpd and
more than 56 mmscfd
of gas per day.”
“The original design
for Atlantis called for
it to produce 150,000
bpd,” stated Dirk Smit,
Atlantis PQ delivery
manager. But while
the team was fabricating the topsides, it became apparent that the
reservoir was capable
of more than that. Af-

ter engineers did a review of the
systems and determined that the
system could handle 200,000 bpd,
the team moved forward with the
higher capacity in mind.
Even after accommodating the
higher production capacity, the facility has been designed with even
more growth in mind, Smit says
that Atlantis has the capacity for
an additional module when future
production warrants it.
“Atlantis has three modules in
horseshoe shape, so a fourth module could go in the open end of the
horseshoe,” Smit says.

The Atlantis team was also able “to turn lemons
into lemonade” when design changes forced delays in
the project.
“Some of the delays helped give us more time to buy
equipment and to continue work on the design. We also
had time to do more studies, and we were 50 percent
complete on engineering when we started fabrication.”
That compares favorably with the industry average in which only 20 percent of engineering design
is completed before fabrication begins on major construction projects.
BP also launched a marine assurance team as part of
the organization.
“The marine assurance team has made signiﬁcant contributions to our process safety programs,” DeJohn says.
The team is staffed by specialists from BP Shipping
who have marine expertise, DeJohn says, “so now we
have more people with ship design and ship operations
experience who have accountability for the marine portions of the facility.”

Commissioning milestones

Forward momentum

Commissioning is the last step in the quality assurance
process for a new facility, Smit points out, but commissioning a major facility like Atlantis can be a challenge
because of the number of delivery teams involved, each
with different areas of responsibility.
As a result, an important part of Smit’s role was to
work with each of the commissioning teams to make
sure Atlantis had a fully integrated commissioning program “from the wellbore to the point of sale,” and ensuring that there were no gaps between the various teams.
That meant asking some tough questions: “How do
we know that we looked at everything that we need to
look at? When we say we’re ready for ﬁrst oil, how do
we know we really are?”
To answer those questions, Smit led a rigorous and
comprehensive commissioning review during which every aspect of the facility was reassessed. “Each commissioning team looked at their portion of the work as
well as how it affected other areas to ensure that there
were no gaps and that we were ready.”

Maintaining a facility like Atlantis is an ongoing process,
says Alastair Taylor, facilities manager, who notes that
integrity management is a continuing theme that will
become more prominent on Atlantis as time goes on.
“The work of the Facilities Team has to be totally coordinated and integrated from a safety and operations
point of view,” Taylor says.
As a result, he sees his team continuing to focus on
engineering and integrity management.
On the engineering side, Taylor’s team focuses on
both future work as well as remediation of any issues,
from the simple to the complex, including the replacement of upgrades to major pieces of equipment. His
team is also responsible for execution of any engineering work.
For integrity management, “our goal is to make
sure processes are sound and that we have the correct monitoring programs in place so that there aren’t
problems in the future with equipment or pipelines,”
Taylor says.
His integrity management and assurance staff
works closely with the operations team on all aspects
of the facility to ensure the long-term viability of the asset “so that it’s still producing in 20 to 25 years.”

Capitalizing on experience
“The Atlantis PQ has several things in common with
the other major BP facilities,” stated Ken DeJohn, facili-

Operations

Strong stafﬁng plans and technology help ensure
smooth, safe startup and operations

A

s with other aspects of Atlantis, the Operations
Team has beneﬁted from the strategic decision
to bring in people early, capitalize on the experience of other BP deepwater teams and leverage technology wherever possible.
“We brought in expertise and built a strong team of
people with three to 20 years of experience,” says Jerry
Sharp, PQ Base Management Team leader. “The mixture
of experience also gave us a lot of opportunity to mentor
and develop new staff. The opportunity to startup a ﬁeld
this size doesn’t happen often in a person’s career and we
believe it’s been an advantage to both the individuals and
to the project to share that experience.”
Sharp, who has been with BP for over 22 years and
involved in deepwater operations for more than 10 years,
says Atlantis was able to staff up with production engineers early and beneﬁted from partnering with teams from
other BP projects.
In his role as PQ Base Management Team leader,
Sharp was responsible for getting Atlantis ready for
production, including managing all base production activities to maximize production, improve efﬁciency, and

tion testing of each well, and the overall production plan
for the ﬁeld.
“While our team tends to focus on the shorter term, 12
to18 months, we work closely with the Reservoir Management Team, which focuses on the longer term—from eight
months through the life of the ﬁeld,” Sharp explains.
As he was building his team, Sharp also pushed for
the opportunity to bring on additional production engineers
early in the project.
“For a variety of reasons, we were able to bring on
someone about three years before ﬁrst oil to make sure
that what we were designing and installing was appropriate for the operation.”
“This is a dream project. There are few opportunities
in the industry to go from zero to our production rates in
such a short period of time, so it was exciting to be able
to deliver good performance and operating efﬁciencies,”
Sharp says.
By completely stafﬁng up front, Sharp adds the team
was able to do a lot of work before ﬁrst oil “so we were
able to deﬁne the upside potential before day one, before we opened the ﬁrst choke. This was one of the most
prepared and forward-looking projects
that I have been involved in.”
“We came in with the mindset of
how can we be more successful than
anything we had done in the past? The
role of a production engineer is a key
value that is not always recognized in
being able to deliver the business. We
have been able to leverage the discipline and show what it could deliver.”

understand the well and reservoir performances.
“Our team focused on how we started the wells and
our plans to ramp up to target rates. That included establishing the limits of the well and predicting how they
would perform in the next 12 months.”
It also covered the integrity of the wells in order to
prevent failures and protect project investments, along
with well surveillance, well testing allocation, comple-

“Another step that the Atlantis team
took to help ensure a smooth startup
was to embed operations personnel
into the commissioning teams that
fabricated the equipment,” stated Rick
Oneto, Atlantis Operations manager.
“We had 18 people in Morgan City, Louisiana, where
the topsides were fabricated and another 20 in the shipyard in Daewoo’s facility in Korea with the ﬂoating systems team during fabrication of the hull,” Oneto says.
“Our goals were to assist the construction teams by providing input about maintainability and operability.”
Oneto says the initiative and input proved to be valuable particularly during the initial phases of construction.

Operations
While on site during construction, the Operations
Team also played a role in preservation of equipment that
would not be used for several months or longer between
installation and ﬁnal startup operations in the ﬁeld.
Oneto also had team members assigned to documenting and developing maintenance and operating procedures
and work processes. “Good documentation is extremely
important, and we were able to utilize learnings from previous projects in development of our processes.”
Another goal was to have the entire operations organization in place one year prior to startup.
Startup typically means when a ﬁeld is ready to begin
producing oil. But startup for the Atlantis Operations Team
began almost a year in advance of ﬁrst oil when the team

began operating hull systems after the integration of the
topsides equipment and mooring out on location.
“At that time, we had to have personnel operating and
maintaining equipment on a full-time basis on an operational mode,” Oneto says. “That’s a departure from a traditional
startup schedule and almost two years before ﬁrst oil.”

Capitalizing on
technology developments
Coming onstream when it did, the Atlantis team was
also able to capitalize on several new technology developments to help plan and manage operations.
One of the most signiﬁcant technology tools has
been the Integrated Surveillance Information System
(ISIS) and ProcessNet, a high-level automation software
tool that provides both visual and analytical capabilities
for monitoring production operations.

30

“Technology continued to advance in the four years
since we started this team,” Sharp says. “We had the
opportunity to implement the latest technology with ISIS
and have a fully automated surveillance and information
system monitor real-time pressure, with intelligence.”
With ISIS, Sharp says, the team has been able to
raise the bar on the levels of surveillance and understanding of the wells.
ISIS provides the team not only with signiﬁcantly more
data, but also with the means to better understand and
monitor the data.
The monitoring system on facilities a few years ago,
for example, provided about 3,000 data tags, Sharp
stated. “But on Atlantis we’re using 40,000 data tags.”
With so much information, Sharp
says it would be easy for a production engineer to be overwhelmed
with the data and miss some of the
opportunities. But ISIS screens visually display the data and are easily
programmed to alert the Operations
Team to deviations from the normal
performance standards that they
have set.
ISIS has made a signiﬁcant contribution to the integrity standards
of the Operations Team and helps
them to avoid potential problems.
Sharp says sand production
monitoring and continuous bottom
hole well pressures are two good
examples of the utilization of the
ISIS capability.
“All wells are frac-packed to
prevent sand production from the
unconsolidated sands, so we have
devices on tress to monitor sand count. We can set up
independent alerts for sand detection. We can also set
alerts on annulus pressure to make sure thermal pressure doesn’t increase above certain limits.”
The automated system provides live data on all the
variables on trees and wells.
“We can monitor from almost any place. We can log
into the system on our laptops from any location, so we’re
not chained to the ofﬁce and can monitor continuously.”
Using ISIS, Sharp’s team in Houston can see the
same thing as the Operations Team on site. “They tend
to focus on real time in the ﬁeld, but we tend to look at
the data over time. We can provide guidance while looking at the same data.”
ISIS also helps the Atlantis team understand how the
well is behaving in the reservoir. “We will have seven
wells producing, and it’s possible that some wells could

Project services

Robust Project Services Team Contributes
to success
“The Atlantis Project Services Team
took a lot of the workload off of engineers, which enabled them to focus
much more on technical delivery of the
project. Our team of dedicated professionals, many of whom were embedded in the technical delivery teams, rigorously managed the project schedule,
cost estimates, and the progress we
were making with each activity in the
schedule. We used the data they compiled to gain a more comprehensive
view of the project, reduce conﬂicts
and help keep it on track.”
– Bill Naseman, Project Services Manager, Atlantis

W

ith delivery of a world-class project like
Atlantis on the line, the question in mind for
many in BP and BHP-Billiton was: “How do we
keep something so large with so many complex parts on
critical path?” What became apparent to Atlantis management was the need to ﬁnd a way to take a detailed look
at important activities to determine which ones were part
of the critical path to completion, while at the same time
also looking at the myriad other events that might lead to
conﬂicts and knock the project off schedule.
“We needed a method to identify possible conﬂicts
that speciﬁc activities might encounter and help the delivery teams ﬁnd different means to accomplish tasks or
change the order in which tasks were executed to prevent problems,” said Bill Naseman, Project Services manager for Atlantis. Naseman noted that while there may be
one so-called critical path on a huge project like Atlantis,
measured by the longest cumulative duration to ﬁnish all
of the activities necessary to complete the project, the
project team concluded that there would be more than
a dozen signiﬁcant items just off the critical path. If any
of these signiﬁcant items began to slip behind schedule,
their importance would elevate to critical and potentially
cause major delays to the project. For this reason, the
critical path and ﬂoat paths, and all the major items that
could impact them, became objects of intense scrutiny
for the project team to track and forecast.

32

To put the importance of this detailed tracking in
perspective, Atlantis planning and scheduling lead Joe
Faulkerson found the project analogous to an elephant.
“If you compare a large project like Atlantis to an elephant, when it’s a great distance from you, as in the earliest stages of work, it’s easy to cover it up just by holding up your thumb,” he said. “But when the elephant
is almost in the room with you because the scheduled
project delivery is at hand and there are challenges, holding up your thumb won’t cover up much of anything.” To
have everything properly covered would require a wellorganized team of experts to systematically follow and
review project activities and reﬂect the true status of the
project and where it was headed.

Properly staffed team
drives improved results
According to Naseman, Atlantis top-level managers were
supportive of maintaining the right-sized staff required to
support the project’s complex work scope. “We built a
right-sized Project Services Team to support the project,
which is one reason we’ve been able to deliver what the
project team needed,” Naseman said.
He added that the depth of his team provided the
ﬂexibility to move resources around to help hit “hot
spots” that needed extra attention from time to time.
Comprised of some 40 people at peak stafﬁng, the Atlantis Project Services Team was organized in a matrix
structure with central records management, a scheduling team and cost teams, plus project services organizations dedicated to speciﬁc technical delivery teams.
The records management staff worked with the engineering groups to compile drawings, equipment descriptions, technical data, tag numbers, maintenance
records and other useful links into a computer program
easily accessible to operations staff. Using a Documentum software product, up-to-date information on every
piece of equipment was available onshore or offshore
to anybody who needed access. “Rather than having to
wait for months to have important equipment data available, the Project Services Team records management
staff and the computer tools they employed provided
fresh and very detailed information to the people who
needed it most,” noted Naseman.
The project services scheduling team provided each
major Atlantis technical delivery team with at least one
planner/scheduler to support their efforts. The small but
indispensable central cost team pulled together all of
the cost forecasts from the individual delivery teams

Project services
and combined them with their own forecast of nonteam
speciﬁc costs to develop a total project view.
The supporting Project Services organization that
supported each technical delivery team was staffed by a
leader, several cost engineers and analysts and was embedded in each major delivery team. Each team’s makeup was slightly different, driven by the unique needs required to support the technical delivery team’s remaining
work scope. For example, the wells, subsea, production
quarters and operations teams each had a project services organization colocated with them, typically consisting
of ﬁve to six professionals. These project services organizations delved into the details of their delivery team’s
efforts and generated forecasts that matched the timing of the remaining work scope and assessed progress
against the overall plan, as well as assisting in processing invoices and researching audit claims. “We managed
these project services organizations to meet the needs

of the technical delivery teams while simultaneously
gaining and sustaining an overall project perspective,”
said Naseman. “This worked better than anybody could
have imagined. When project services staff completed
employee surveys, many identiﬁed their work group as
the delivery team they were supporting rather than project services. That made me proud because it demonstrated that, even though we are a matrix organization,
our professionals don’t feel like outsiders.
“We’ve built a best-in-class schedule from my perspective,” said Naseman. “Atlantis is a unique major project in that it’s fully integrated schedule includes all ac-

tivities, not just facility construction and commissioning
activities. We looked at the work holistically and included
drilling and completion activities, subsea architecture installation, ﬂowline installation, umbilicals and controls,
as well as the usual facility construction, installation and
commissioning work. Many project schedules wouldn’t
include the wells work scope; but with the Transocean’s
GSF Development Driller II dedicated to Atlantis and our
primary vessel for installing subsea architecture, it made
perfect sense to us.”

Project services a fresh approach,
not a legacy
To the Project Services Team, the road to success was
winding and bumpy to say the least. “The rigorous use
of scheduling tools traditionally isn’t high on the radar for
a lot of the technical folks, but I have conﬁdence in what
those tools can bring to a project,” said Faulkerson. “In
the old days in the ﬁeld, a lot of things
were done by the seat of your pants.
That approach rapidly disintegrates when
you’re confronted by the extraordinary
complexity and extensive scope of a project like Atlantis.” Faulkerson compared
Atlantis to a groundbreaking research and
development effort rather than something
more traditional, such as building cars or
airplanes on an assembly line.
Faulkerson recognized that the role
of the project services matrix organization was to ensure, as much as humanly
possible, that the full scope of the Atlantis
project was entered into a usable scheduling tool. Such an effort would take time,
people and money. He ﬁrst began work
with the drilling team, in which he and his
staff gathered as much detail as possible,
right down to single-hour and multiplehour activities—almost unheard of in the
energy business. They hit a rough spot
when they switched to a new version of
the Primavera software they were using, which created a
learning curve for his schedulers and slowed their ability
to track the project.
Faulkerson helped the team to persevere through
this delay and gave his staff the extra time they needed
to get the knack of the new and improved software. “I
didn’t want to stick with the old process, which was satisfactory but didn’t provide the detail across all portions
of the project that we needed,” remarked Faulkerson.
“To reduce schedule conﬂicts and help everyone understand how various events might interface, we ultimately
were able to create a way for technical staff to look at

minutia but was important to the people actually carrying out the tasks. From this highly focused look we intelligently lumped together activity sets and provided a
thorough overview of the true schedule and how different
events were interrelated. We discovered that work that
seemed relatively insigniﬁcant could have a big impact if
not conducted properly or at the right time.”
Safety and protecting the environment also came into
play. One consideration was landing the hangers on the
BOP stacks. The hanger, made of nonshearable material,
could pose a challenge if an emergency disconnect was
required. The schedule provided visibility of where the
hangers would be relative to events such as a construction vessel arriving for a remote pull-in. The hangers then
could be kept suspended above the BOP stack until conﬂicting operations were complete and out of the area.
Operators found they could refer to the detailed project
services organization schedules to help them make decisions on when and where simultaneous events might
occur and plan how to avoid or work around them.
Schedule changes also drive costs, and cost tracking
by the Project Services Team proved pivotal in demonstrating their worth. When it was decided to retrieve the
Atlantis subsea manifolds, the project services organization worked hand-in-hand with the subsea team to de-

liver a high-level estimate of what that work would cost.
Their estimate turned out to be very close to the ﬁnal
numbers. “From the Project Services Team’s perspective, it’s really about matching our estimates to the level
of scope deﬁnition. When we had less-deﬁned scope
and execution plans, we added provisions to our estimates to address the uncertainty.
“As the technical team improved the technical deﬁnition of our scope of work, then updated our cost forecasts
and the schedule to reﬂect that deﬁnition,” said Naseman.

Commercial Team partners
with Project Services
The Atlantis Commercial Team, led by Dan Elmer,
worked closely with the Project Services Team. Elmer
and his two commercial analysts are one of the smallest
commercial teams for BP’s Gulf of Mexico operations.
“We’re focused on commercial aspects and are generally unburdened with additional duties and functions like
some commercial teams,” said Elmer.
Elmer and his team were responsible for all of the economic aspects of the Atlantis project. They kept accounting of the ﬁnancials on track, managed the group ﬁnancial
objectives and long-term plan, and reported performance
upward in the BP organization. They also helped write ﬁ-

nancial memoranda to justify proposals in the project, and
ﬁled requests for supplemental funding when money beyond the originally sanctioned amount was needed.
“Atlantis is considered a top-notch asset at BP, but we
had to go through the same process [as every other asset] to acquire more funding when we needed it,” said
Elmer. “You have to be able to withstand extreme vetting
by senior managers, which requires accurate processes.”
Elmer noted that the Commercial Team received a tremendous amount of support from the Project Services
Team. “We worked with project services and assembled
sufﬁcient detail to precisely tell the Atlantis story without
putting it into the excruciating details one might expect
from an accountant. Feedback from top management revealed that the clear, concise information we presented
helped them understand our numbers, avoid surprises
and justiﬁed the funding we requested.”
Unpredictable events would change the landscape for
Atlantis and the Commercial and Project Services teams.
Storms that struck the Gulf of Mexico tightened the regulatory environment for the entire industry. Internal challenges
such as repairs and increased costs impacted the entire
project. Current high prices created cost pressures around
inﬂation as the prices we had to pay for everything we needed went up as well,” said Elmer. A noteworthy result of the
rigorous project services scheduling effort was economized
use of expensive assets such as vessels, which are limited
in number and in high demand in the increasingly busy global exploration and production environment.

36

The Project Services
and Commercial Teams
worked together to help
forecast cost changes.
When changes were
found, Project Services
worked with the line team
to better understand how
to communicate them to
the Commercial Team,
who then would take the
issues up to project management. Project Services
and Commercial proved to
be meticulous functions
that looked at dollars and
schedules constantly.
“You can’t get into a
situation where people
are throwing money
where they shouldn’t,”
said Elmer. “Commercial and project services
function as team members for sure, but in another respect we’re the ones who
raise a red ﬂag from time to time, sort of a check and
balance for the performance unit.”

Balancing act pays off
“We’re an early warning system in a way,” said Naseman.
“We work with the delivery teams to help them understand and predict impacts on costs and schedules. We
remove some of the administrative burdens from the
engineers and work teams, and help them communicate
changes. While all the delivery teams, project services
and the commercial analysts can’t always be in agreement, we’ve discovered that if you have the means to
track issues, get them on the table early and discuss
them, you can reach solutions to challenges much more
amicably and efﬁciently.”
Top-level management continues to sing their praises. “We were blessed with some very strong Project

Project future

Looking to the future

A

fter successfully overcoming a number of challenges on its path from discovery to commissioning and ﬁrst oil over the past seven years,
the Atlantis Field has a very big future ahead of it and
will serve as a model for future deepwater projects in
the Gulf of Mexico and around the world.
“Atlantis is already a giant and it has the potential to
be a super giant,” says Simon Todd, performance unit
leader for Atlantis. “It is awesome what we have already delivered. The sanction of the Atlantis North Flank
speaks to the huge potential of the ﬁeld. And over the
next few years we have the opportunity to further increase the number of options that we have to work with
in the Atlantis area.”
To capitalize on future expansion opportunities
throughout the ﬁeld, the Atlantis team had the foresight
to build in expansion capacity on the Atlantis PQ, giving
it the ﬂexibility and capability for future tie-ins.
During the final stages of Atlantis construction and
commissioning, Todd’s team began focusing on making sure the business processes and culture that are
required of a production operation were in place.
“We wanted to hit the ground running as a production
revenue-generating business and build off the strengths
of this major project,”
Todd says.
The detailed planning that was invested
in Atlantis, combined
with
the
lessons
learned from other recent deepwater projects in the Gulf of Mexico, put Atlantis in an
enviable position. As
a result, Atlantis was
able to both quickly
ramp up production
and deliver superior
operating efﬁciency.
“My job is to ﬁnd
the most expeditious
path to realizing those
resources. It is an
exciting challenge to
ﬁnd the right balance
between developing

tainable options for the future.”
Gary Imm, deputy project manager for Atlantis, believes Atlantis will be a showcase ﬁeld for a very long
time. “Atlantis has lots of capabilities and functionality
that could keep it busy for the next 25 years or more.”

Culture of success
The future of Atlantis also is being inﬂuenced by the
teams and culture of the organization.
“There is something magical about the culture of Atlantis that Greg Sills and the other leaders have created
over the last few years. There is tremendous potential
and people with great capability on the Atlantis team.
I’m motivated by the opportunity to unleash that magic
and potential. There is a high level of enthusiasm and a
feeling of esprit de corps,” says Imm.
Atlantis also represents the overall company’s direction in how it manages projects and teams. “There is a
deeper listening and engagement taking place, especially with the team on the PQ. It represents where we as a
company want to go,” Todd says. “There is tremendous
capability around collaboration and inclusion of people,
ideas and experiences, both within and outside the project. The notion that we need to carry forward is that

Project future
Atlantis is a big and complex asset and that when we
meet challenges we have to address them with integration and collaboration.”

Challenges ahead
Despite the success of Atlantis to date and the bright
outlook for the ﬁeld, team leaders also recognize that
more challenges await them in the future because the
project is on the cutting edge in terms of both technology and complexity.
Some of the challenges of the Atlantis PQ and subsea systems are the result of being on the boundary of
science and engineering, which underscores the need
for strong collaboration in managing a very complex system, Todd stated.
“But if you put in the proper front-end engineering
and planning, the result is usually success, especially for
complex projects, and can pay dividends in the end.”

Future design options
While the success of Atlantis has substantiated the
wisdom of its overall design and innovative approaches,
Imm also sees the potential for different approaches for
major ﬁelds in the future.
“I see us building more standardized facilities for
smaller production volumes,” Imm says. “Future Atlantis-sized ﬁelds might have two or three facilities that are
staged over time. With Atlantis, we had so much conﬁdence that it made sense to build a big facility. But with
other ﬁelds in the future you could start with a 60,000
bpd facility and then you could add another if you see
production warrants it.”
Imm also believes that going to more standardized
facilities may enable the industry to have a facility ready
in a shorter time frame.
“I would be surprised if many future ﬁelds will be
large enough that you would have the conﬁdence to put
all your eggs in one basket like we were able to do with
Atlantis. Instead, we could see a more staged production approach,” Imm says.

Capturing lessons learned
An important goal of the Atlantis management team has
been to ensure that lessons learned are captured and
transferred to future projects either in operation or in
planning stages.
“While our people were focused on Atlantis delivery, we also wanted to transfer those lessons to other
teams,” says David Tifﬁn, Completions Excellence Advisor for the Gulf of Mexico. “Atlantis has been very successful and has done things differently. It had a really
good organizational model that can be applied to upcoming projects.”

38

As a result, Tifﬁn’s team and others have looked at all
aspects of Atlantis from stafﬁng and planning through
appraisal and commissioning.
“Some future completions could cost upwards of $1
million per day so if we can use lessons learned from Atlantis to reduce the number of days required for completion by just a few days on other ﬁelds around the world,
then we will have made a great contribution to those
projects,” Tifﬁn says.
In the Gulf of Mexico, for example, the lessons
learned from Atlantis are being considered by the teams
planning other deepwater projects.
“There are a number of recommendations based on
what Atlantis has done that are relevant to other projects in the Gulf, ranging from the number of people and
the amount of time required to properly plan well tests.
Based on their track record and success, it would be
very beneﬁcial to incorporate those lessons”
Tifﬁn says one of the lessons from Atlantis has
been the importance of focusing on stafﬁng and the
development of people. Based on the experiences at
Atlantis, he notes that some have suggested earlier allocation of more to plan well tests for other promising
major ﬁelds.

Working smarter
Terry Miglicco, Atlantis Completion Team Leader, sees
more smart wells in the future for Atlantis and other
major ﬁelds.
Major parts of the Atlantis ﬁeld appear to have two
big zones, and some parts have more potential pay
zones. To capitalize on the various pay zones, BP has
pursued smart completions for some of its wells.
“Smart completions allow you to produce from different zones either separately or together,” Miglicco says.
“The advantage is that if you start having water in one
zone you can remotely shut in that zone without having
to bring in a rig and rework the well. In 7,000 feet of water, it’s very expensive to get back on these wells.”
Atlantis currently accounts for two of ﬁve smart
completions in the Gulf of Mexico but Miglicco sees
that increasing. “In a few years we may have 15 smart
completions in the Gulf.”

Planning for the future
Looking ahead, Bruce Rogers, Completions Operations
Lead for Atlantis, says a lot of intervention activity is
planned for the ﬁeld as BP goes after different zones
during the life of the wells in the ﬁeld.
“One of the exciting things about Atlantis is that
there are multiple pay zones in the wellbore -- maybe an
average of six each,” Rogers says. “We can’t complete
all of those at one time.

Project future
“In the past, with most wells you would plan to complete everything you could and you never planned on
going back into the well. On these, we’re planning to
go back into the wells in the future. This is a long-term
subsea development program.”
“We’re taking the meat of the ﬁeld ﬁrst in the middle
horizons. Current smart well technology only lets us
complete and manage two zones at a time, but we’re
looking at increasing that over time as smart well technology improves,” Rogers says.

Subsurface plans
Looking forward from a subsurface perspective, says
Connie Bargas, reservoir engineering advisor, there is a
need to understand reservoir performance very quickly.
“There are areas that we still want to appraise. We
have started development of the North Flank, but other
areas may have potential as well.”
In addition, the team has already identiﬁed ﬁve drill
centers, so there will be lots of construction work over
time to fulﬁll the completion plan.
“That makes Atlantis somewhat unusual since for

most ﬁelds you usually complete construction and then
just produce,” Bargas says.

BP in the Gulf of Mexico
BP was an early advocate of oil exploration in the Gulf of
Mexico—especially in the deepwater province. The company recognized its promise and began acquiring lease
blocks during the 1980s, which has led to BP’s leading
position in the basin today.
BP’s knowledge of the Gulf of Mexico region led to
a series of signiﬁcant discoveries, among them Atlantis
and Thunder Horse—world-class ﬁelds and recognized

Subsea tree

among the most signiﬁcant ever discovered in the Gulf.
Today, BP is one of the largest acreage holders in the
deepwater Gulf, owning more than 400 gross blocks in
water depths of 1,200 feet or greater.
For 2000-2010 BP has a $20 billion-plus investment
program in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The company
anticipates its total deepwater production to exceed
450,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2010 and
remain at that level through the next decade.
Gulf of Mexico assets include Pompano (1994), Marlin (1999), Horn Mountain (2002), Na Kika (2003), Holstein (2004), Mad Dog (2005), Atlantis (2007), Thunder
Horse (2008) and the Mardi Gras Transportation System
(2004) that exports oil and gas to shore.
BP holds interests in a number of other producing and
development assets: Diana Hoover, Great White in Alaminos Canyon, Europa, Deimos, Mars, King, Crosby, Princess, Ram Powell, Ursa, and Mica in Mississippi Canyon.
BP operates discoveries that are in appraisal on ﬁve
exciting prospects for the future: Tubular Bells, Puma,
Kodiak, Kaskida and Tucker.

The CoPilot drilling optimization service
has delivered continuous improvement in
drilling performance and risk management
for the Atlantis project since 2005. This
service is based on comprehensive prewell planning, downhole data acquisition
with real-time diagnostics and post-well
analysis. Although the CoPilot service has
been used throughout all the wells, it has
proven particularly useful in the challenging 14.5 inch by 16.5 inch and 14¾-inch
by 16.5 inch hole sections, which combined directional work in laminated sand
sections and reaming-while-drilling using
hole opening devices. In offset wells, this

interval had a history of failures with the
previous drilling service contractor.
Before the CoPilot drilling optimization approach was introduced, not
a single well in this interval had been
successfully drilled in one run. The AutoTrak™ G3 system, in combination
with the CoPilot service, enabled ﬁeld
service personnel to react immediately
to whirl events identiﬁed by the CoPilot
downhole system, adjust drilling parameters for improved drilling performance,
and monitor the hole quality. As a result,
these sections were drilled in a single
run in the ﬁve consecutive wells. All the
formation evaluation data acquisition
and directional objectives were met with
low-hole tortuosity conﬁrmed by CoPilot
bending-moment measurement, facilitating superior casing placement. By enabling quick, informed decisions based
on real-time data rather than from failure
patterns, the CoPilot service has accelerated the well-to-well learning curve for
the Atlantis team.

Achieving efﬁciency
through drill bit innovations
The BP Atlantis team used expandable
reamers in the BHA to drill through
challenging interbedded sand/shale sequences. This drilling conﬁguration can
result in destructive levels of vibration.
Hughes Christensen engineers analyzed this dynamic condition and developed solutions to achieve the best
possible performance.
Vibrations can occur when there
is a change in the depth-of-cut (DOC)
ratio between the amount of rock removed by the pilot bit and the amount
of rock removed by the reamer. For the
20-inch and 16.5 inch hole-opening sections, Hughes Christensen utilized a
Genesis™ seven-blade, 5/8-inch cutter
bit design for the pilot bits, which included the following stability features:
• High-imbalance cutter layout to
correct damaging backward whirl
patterns
• SmoothCut™ technology to limit
DOC and to balance the drill rate
between the pilot bit and the
reamer
• Lateral Movement Mitigator™ technology to reduce vibration severity
and protect shoulder cutters from
impact loads
• Zenith™ cutters to maintain sharp
cutting elements for the duration of
the run.
Through a Hughes Christensen/BP
continuous improvement process,
there has been a signiﬁcant reduction

in downhole vibration, leading to
fewer downhole

and lower cost per
foot.

The CoPilot continuous improvement cycle includes data capture for
detailed post-well analysis and identiﬁcation of “lessons learned” in
BHA design, bit selection, and best drilling practices for the next well.

Completions
with intelligent well control
Since the planning phase of the Atlantis project, Baker Oil Tools (BOT) has
worked to develop optimum completion options to meet stringent BP requirements. Known challenges have
included expected production rates of
30,000 to 40,000 bpd. Another concern
was providing the ability to frac the
production zones at rates of 35 to 45
barrels per minute with proppant volumes of up to 250,000 pound per zone,
while monitoring the live annulus. BP
also needed to isolate the lower zone
while fracking the upper zone.
BOT engineers worked closely with
BP staff to provide completion tools and
equipment that would meet or exceed
the demands of the Atlantis project,
including Neptune™ Safety Valves that
were also used on BP’s Thunder Horse
project. From a sand control perspective, BP wanted to maximize its production rates through a monobore completion. BOT supplied its CK Frac™ system
featuring a “smart collet” positive locating capability for monitoring of all setdown positions. To isolate the lower
zone while fracking the upper zone,

BOT used its Injection Control Valve,
an upstream pressure regulator that is
balanced with respect to downstream
pressure. Thus far, BOT has completed
successfully seven challenging deepwater subsea Atlantis wells.
The need for intelligent well control
was addressed early using HCM sliding
sleeves and Premier™ packers with feedthrough capabilities. BOT assisted BP in
installing the ﬁrst Intelligent Well Systems
completion in late 2006 on the “B” well.
The second such completion took place
in early 2007, and the third will be run during the second quarter of 2008.

Fairﬁeld was one of a number of
companies that BP invited to compete
in the development of the initial system
for Autonomously Recording Deep Water Sea Floor Seismometers to function
at depths of 3,000 meters. In response
to that challenge, we developed the Z
3000, which won BP’s 2006 Global Helios Partnership Award for Innovative
Technology.
The Fairﬁeld Z 3000 is composed
of individual self-contained nodes with
no external connection or moving parts,
thereby eliminating potential operational
problems or failures. Each node is rated
for water depths of up to 3,000 meters

The Z 3000 is the world’s ﬁrst commercial, deepwater, wide-azimuth nodal
seismic data acquisition system. Its
ﬁrst application was the world’s deepest 3D seaﬂoor survey over the giant
deepwater Atlantis Field in the Gulf of
Mexico. It proved extremely reliable in
these challenging conditions. Its superb
signal-to-noise ratio led to a new level
of geophysical resolution and interpretation in deepwater ﬁelds. Due to its
positional accuracy, the Z 3000 is ideally suited for 4D Time Lapse reservoir
monitoring.
Fairﬁeld specializes in all phases of
data acquisition and processing, including:
• Designing and manufacturing seismic acquisition systems
• Operating exploration crews
• Processing a wide variety of seismic data.
We have a long history of pioneering
in seismic work. Our ﬁrst 2D transition
zone program began in Louisiana in
1976. We introduced our ﬁrst, nonex-

clusive 3D survey in 1989, and licenses
have been granted to more than 125
exploration and production companies

Solving needs to deliver performance-driven results
The Frontline Group is a 15-year-old
privately held company that works primarily in oil and gas Exploration and
Production. Our mission is to identify
performance and efﬁciency opportunities in areas of Common Process,
Continuous Improvement, Quality Assurance, and Lessons Learned. From
our ofﬁces in Houston and the U.K. we
have delivered projects on six continents. Past and present clients include
BP, ConocoPhillips, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Marathon, Shell, Saudi-Aramco,
Newﬁeld Exploration, Willbros Engineering, MOL Hungarian Oil & Gas,
and Schlumberger.
High-performance teams, continuous process improvement, quality assurance, and lessons learned don’t just happen on rigs located miles offshore. They
require a dedicated team whose job is
to recognize and implement process improvement opportunities not only “next
time” but this time. That is The Frontline
Group’s niche in major E&P projects
such as Atlantis.
Even in highly specialized ﬁelds
such as well delivery and rig delivery,
bringing together the work of numerous vendors in an optimal way is a dynamic and opportunity-rich area for savings and efﬁciencies.
The operator and the vendors need
a common process. We identify performance goals and provide measures to
show where problems reside and how
they can be ﬁxed.
The operator also needs a quality
assurance process. Errors or unsuitable
supplies are costly mistakes on offshore
rigs. Our personnel help avoid them by
going down the supply chain and establishing quality assurance and continuous
improvement processes with vendors.
We qualify vendors and tour their sites
to audit those processes, thereby reducing unsuitable deliveries and breakdowns at the rig ensuring a sustained
reduction in nonproductive time (NPT).

proﬁle: Heerema Marine Contractors

HMC designs new solutions at Atlantis project
Heerema Marine Contractors (HMC) is a
leading marine contractor in the offshore
oil and gas industry and operates worldwide. We have extensive experience in
heavy lifting and the design and installation of structures and pipelines in up
to 3,000 meters of water depth. We currently operate two deepwater construction vessels, Balder and Thialf, as well as
the semisubmersible crane vessel Hermod. For work on projects like Atlantis,
we offer the full range of expertise, experience and construction capability.

Unique material
The installation of ﬁve Pipe-in-Pipe
(PiP) ﬂow lines and risers and one water injection pipe at 2,150 meter water
depth marked the last phase of Heerema Marine Contractor’s scope of the
BP Atlantis Project.
HMC Project Manager Bas Zoon
pointed out that HMC’s Balder was
the only vessel capable of combining
the handling of the long mooring lines,
suction piles and riser transfer loads,
and achieving the high-quality welding
requirements for the steel catenary
(SCRs) risers of the export and infield
pipelines. To have all this work handled by the same installation contractor provided great flexibility, reduced
Simultaneous Operations (SIMOPS)
and a lowered risk of interface clashes
for the client. This project was a clear
example of using a former semisubmersible crane vessel to its full capacity as a safe and reliable deepwater
construction vessel.”
Deputy Project Engineer Arthur
van Opstal says, that after a feasibility study of a year, the ﬂow lines and
risers part of the project was awarded
in August 2005. HMC carried out a
detailed pipelay analysis, developed a
SCR transfer procedure, detailed calculations of inner-pipe behavior and developed purpose-built lifting tools and
equipment. The Atlantis project was
HMC’s ﬁrst PiP installation.

PLET lifted up to J-Lay Tower.

New tools
Back in 2002 the balder
was upgraded with PiP
installation in mind. When
the PiP project was awarded, the basic design had
to be further developed
by fabricating, installing
and commissioning various PiP tools.
HMC developed two
instruments to keep the
inner pipe in place when
welded, the Obelix and
Ideﬁx tools. The Obelix tool
can handle weights of 80
to 100 tonn and the Ideﬁx
up to 10 tonn.
Other newly developed tools were a beveling
tool and a sliding tool. The
latter is able to move the

were setbacks and unforeseen problems. The best-known problem was the
Balder ﬂooding incident. As disruptive
as the incident was, the recovery of the

of water depth. Most systems on board
were loaded to their maximum capacity during installation of these heavy
pipelines, especially during the transfer
of the riser system to the platform. I

Point of no return
The SCRs were hung off at the end of
the pipeline installation. This is called
a “second-end” SCR installation. The
second-end method gives a lot of ﬂexibility to the installation schedule—in
this case the pipelines were installed
and the last portion (the SCRs) was installed after the hull was in place. The
downside of a second-end method is
generally that during SCR pipelay there
is a certain point of no return. When this
point is passed either the SCR has to be
completely installed or when weather
deteriorates the SCR has to be cut back
until the point of no return. For both the
inﬁeld and export pipelines many contingency plans were in place to reduce
the required weather window after the
point of no return as much as possible.
Once the ﬂow lines, anchor yokes
and risers were installed, the ﬂex joint
attached to the SCR had to be transferred from the hang-off table on the
Balder and hung off in chain jack of
the Platform Quarters (PQ). The use of
a ﬂex joint combined with a 40-meter
spool piece posed some rigging challenges, explains van Opstal. The weight
of the pipe, which had to allow for its
ﬂooding, required the combined use of
the crane and the J-Lay tower. We used
an A&R cable of 750 m attached to the
top of the crane to hold a part of the
weight. We also ran a nylon rope from
a winch on the Balder to the PQ. This
thrust assistance system helped reduce horizontal thrust levels from high
currents and deteriorating weather.

Challenging project
On September 2, 2007, the last ﬂow line
was landed in its receptacle porch on the
Atlantis PQ. By reaching this milestone
the Balder completed the extensive ﬂow
lines and risers installation program.
Looking back, HMC Project Manager
Wendell Freeman says, “The work was

10 years in the offshore installation industry and have to say this project was
the most challenging job I have worked
on,” adds Bas Zoon. “Since this was
HMC’s ﬁrst Pipe-in-Pipe job, a lot of
new equipment had to be designed
and fabricated. Three years of study
and engineering and onshore fabrication were required to prepare all equipment and procedures and complete all
tests to be able to install the 16-by-10
inch PiP system in over 2,000 meters

am deeply impressed by the skill and
teamwork that were displayed by the
onshore preparation team and the offshore installation crews on the Balder,

the work.”

J. Ray McDermott receives excellence award
for Atlantis project
J. Ray McDermott (J. Ray), a leading EPCI
offshore ﬁeld development company with
operations in the Americas, the Middle
East, the Caspian and Asia Paciﬁc, achieved
an industry milestone when it was awarded the Louisiana Contractors 2005 Award
for Excellence in recognition of its involvement with the Atlantis project.

with developing mutually agreeable
engineering-deliverables to support J.
Ray’s construction schedule. The team
also initiated the planning and was then
charged with executing the work.
During peak construction, more than
600 J. Ray personnel worked on the Atlantis project, clocking more than 2.34

J. Ray McDermott constructed three modules for the Atlantis topsides. The production and compression modules are each approximately 5,000 tons, and the power generation module (pictured) is approximately 4,000 tons in weight.

J. Ray’s contribution to the project
was the fabrication of three topside
production modules. Built at the company’s Morgan City, Louisiana, facility,
J. Ray procured bulk steel and interconnected piping materials and assembled
the three modules totaling 13,600 tons
(6,700 tons of structural steel, 1,775
tons of interconnect piping and 5,125
tons of engineered equipment).

million man-hours at the Morgan City facility. Upholding safety was a top priority
for J. Ray’s project management team.
J. Ray’s seven-member “project controls” group suggested managing the
project using “early curve” data from
their scheduling system. This was a critical decision that proved to be a chief contributor to the success of the project.

ing of a giant needle. Exact tolerances
for both the hull and the modules were
carefully monitored at each step.

Building for the future
J. Ray’s history is tied closely to the early developments of the offshore oil and
gas industry. In 1947, its marine group installed the ﬁrst steel template platform
for Superior Oil in just 20 feet of water.
Today, J. Ray operates a diversiﬁed ﬂeet
of vessels for the marine construction
industry and has fabrication facilities
and engineering ofﬁces worldwide.
For more than 50 years the Morgan City fabrication facility has routinely handled projects for the Gulf of
Mexico and the Americas. Recently, it
undertook fabrication projects for India
and Trinidad and is currently supporting a fabrication project scheduled for
construction at J. Ray’s new fabrication
facility in Altamira, Mexico.
Key features of the Altamira facility
include a quayside water depth of 30
feet (to be deepened to 39 feet in the
future), a 984-foot bulkhead and two
328-foot skidways. Under the lease
agreement, J. Ray has the capability
to extend the bulkhead length to 3,280
feet, which will provide the space needed to execute deepwater ﬂoating hull
assemblies.

Dimensional control
Project management is key
A project management team was assembled by J. Ray in early 2002 that
consisted of 40 individuals: discipline
engineers (structural, piping, E&I equipment), project controls and estimating,
who initially reviewed key concepts of
constructability with the design engineering company.
The management team was charged

J. Ray was responsible for getting the
modules to mechanical completion and
ready for commissioning. One critical
interface of the project was mating the
completed modules with the semisubmersible hull.
To safely transfer loads into the ﬂoating system, the four legs of each module were placed into specially designed
supports in the hull, a proverbial thread-

With extensive project experience highlighted by
many industry “ﬁrsts,” KBR and its subsidiaries, GVA
and Granherne, offer a broad technical knowledge
base and project management skills to support all
types of ﬂoating installations
The Atlantis Field represents a worldclass development in record-breaking
water depths with difﬁcult seaﬂoor topography. To tackle these challenges, BP
selected a subsea development tied to
a host semisubmersible facility. KBR’s
subsidiary, GVA, was chosen to design
the semisubmersible hull, based on its
GVA 27000 design. GVA’s experience
includes over 30 years of semisubmersible designs, and the company has been
the industry leader in the development
of purpose-built semis for ﬂoating production applications. GVA designs offer
proven performance, shipyard friendly
construction and ﬂexibility to adapt to a
broad range of ﬁeld developments.
To execute the hull design, GVA enlisted the assistance of its parent and
sister companies, KBR and Granherne,
to assemble an integrated team consisting of experienced personnel from all
three companies. Project ofﬁces were

But Schlumberger has brought to bear
still another well test technology at the
Atlantis project, one that brings real-time
data directly from the wellbore to desktops practically anywhere in the world.
Speciﬁcally, BP chose to use the
Schlumberger InterACT© system, which
collects and monitors well data (pressure, temperature, and oil and gas ﬂow
rates) in real time during the cleanup
operations performed with surface well
test equipment on the rig and then, using a standard Web browser with a simple Internet connection, links experts in
both BP and Schlumberger offsite locations around the globe. With InterACT,
these experts can collaborate with the

is being tested and completed, regardless of location.
The InterACT system provides ﬁeldproven, online workspace for remote
surveillance of drilling and wireline operations, stimulation and cementing,
and real-time well testing and production surveillance services. Asset teams
and partners can gain secure access to
project data at many points, which helps
stimulate closer teamwork and timelier,

proﬁle: Subsea 7

Subsea 7 one-of-a-kind capability crucial to Atlantis
Subsea 7 is one of the world’s leading
subsea engineering and construction
contractors with a multinational workforce in excess of 5,000 personnel
worldwide. Global offshore operations
are supported out of the North Sea, Africa, Brazil, the Gulf of Mexico and Asia
Paciﬁc. Subsea 7 has a ﬂeet of industryleading, dynamically positioned ships
capable of reeled steel and ﬂexible pipelay, subsea construction, and saturation

construction yards worldwide
Subsea 7 was contracted by BP to
transport and install six hydraulic/chemical-injection and two (2) electric ﬁber
optic umbilicals in the Atlantis Field.
The umbilicals are a vital piece of the
Atlantis offshore development because
they supply hydraulic power, chemical
injection, and signal and control functions to the subsea trees from the Atlantis host platform.
The vessel chosen for the umbilical
installation campaign was Subsea 7’s
multipurpose offshore support vessel
Toisa Perseus. The Toisa Perseus has a

TESCO completion systems add built-in
efﬁciencies to BP Atlantis project
TESCO was selected to play a key role
in the completions segment of BP’s
Atlantis project. TESCO was selected
as the primary service provider by BP’s
completion team to run chrome tubulars
on the project aboard the Global Sante Fe
Deep Driller II. Our tubular running experience coupled with proprietary, patented
Multiple Control Line Running Systems
(MCLRS) equipment packages apt for the
challenge made TESCO the likely choice.

Third generation of TESCO MCLRS units

Project tubulars included 5.5 inch
VAM Top® HC high-compression,
chrome, 13/85 ksi tubing joints so that
extreme compressive loads would not
damage the string. Stands of 120 feet
www.bp.com/us

were pre-built ofﬂine and racked back
until ready for the main run, a practice
we have employed successfully on numerous other deepwater projects.
With TESCO’s use of its MCLRS, assurances were in place that nonproductive
time (NPT) would be virtually eliminated
during the completion run. NPT, especially in the deepwater environment, would
be particularly expensive. Our MCLRS
is a tool that not only adds efﬁciency to
the completion process, but improves
safety as well. The
MCLRS allows control lines to be run
without manual manipulation and without passing through
the slips.
TESCO MCLRS
technology
consists of a raised
platform that elevates the slips six
feet above the rig
ﬂoor, which provides access to the
tubing string below the slips. Ten
or more control
lines feed through
the open platform
sides
without
passing
through
the slips and are
clamped to the
tubing string below the slips. The
MCLRS process
separates the control line clamping
crew from the rig
ﬂoor crew, making
both operations inherently safer and more efﬁcient. TESCO’s MCLRS is also capable of offering
control line protection for a variety of
Smart/Intelligent well completions as
on the BP Atlantis. Control line spool-

ers may be positioned in various locations to facilitate clamps with protective
pockets 180 degrees from one another.
Safety is again improved because no
one is required to ride a belt to secure
sheaves in the already crowded derrick.
The MCLRS is installed with three
simple lifts, and rig-up takes less than
two hours. However, installation time
is quickly recouped with typical running
speeds of between 10 and 21 joints per
hour. MCLRS technology adds an important component to an operator’s tubular
services tool box. By eliminating or at
least stemming the NTP associated with
crimped or broken control lines, TESCO’s
MCLRS could mean the end of control
line inefﬁciencies and accidents.
TESCO is a global leader in the design, manufacture and application of solutions for the upstream energy industry.
TESCO manufactures, sells and rents a
series of top drives for land and offshore
drilling applications. TESCO’s leading
technology, CASING DRILLING®, is considered a step change in the way drillers
reach bottom in difﬁcult drilling environments. CASING DRILLING® technology
can also be applied to the company’s a
Tubular Services division that also provides conventional tubular running services. TESCO’s credo of providing Better
Ways to The Bottom™ for its customers
is evidenced by the proven technical advances the company has made throughout the entire drilling drive train.

trees. These production trees are controlled by two styles of umbilical (hydraulic and electro/optical).
Production ﬂuids are delivered to
the Atlantis Production Quarters (PQ)
host semisubmersible via Pipe-in-Pipe
(PiP) ﬂowlines and steel catenary risers
(SCRs) designed by Technip. The water
depth and the high currents were signiﬁcant challenges during the design
phase of these underwater components. Challenges with pipelines and
risers included: water depth, currents,
seabed topography, riser installation/
weights, pipe and soil interaction, and
vortex induced vibration.
The PQ can accept up to 14 production risers and two export risers and
24 umbilicals. A total of six production
and two export risers and six umbilicals
have been installed for First Oil.
Technip’s work scope, which started

with the Appraise phase, will continue
beyond First Oil supporting further ﬁeld
development. Two 10” connecting pipelines will be welded in Technip’s spoolbase in Mobile, Alabama and subsequently spooled onto the Deep Blue for
installation on the Atlantis North Flank

Development Driller II: Dynamic partnership leads
to a new dimension in contract drilling
Transocean is the world’s largest offshore
drilling contractor, providing more than
50 years of experience in operations at
all water depths. We have worked with
national, major and independent energy
companies in many challenging environments around the world, setting by far the
most world records in our business and
drilling some of the ﬁrst wells for countries and clients. We continuously strive
to improve our operations, and the work
by the Development Driller II semisubmersible rig on the BP Atlantis project is
an example of improvement in action.
In fact, our relationship with BP is a
matter of customer focus, shared goals,
and a searching for collaboration to redeﬁne a major part of the offshore industry, break down boundaries between

vendor and client companies, and move
to the next generation of exploration
challenges with the next generation of
exploration technologies.
Several years ago, we began an
exploratory process on how to move
from then-current standards to create
the next generation of ultradeepwater drilling rigs. What we sought was
a still-deeper level of involvement and
partnership with the kind of client who
would be using this unit when it became
available. We felt there were unexplored
applications that could now be available
through the use of new technologies.
Our invitation to greater client involvement resonated within BP and
thus began a collaboration that would
create a truly new generation of off-

shore technology, a generation whose
design would start from the seabed and
move up to the deck and derrick. The resulting semisubmersible rig with all its
new capabilities would be the product
of intense customer focus and practical,
realistic customer input into the design
and construction stages.
What emerged from this joint effort
was a versatile drilling tool. From the
start, it saved time and money on the job.
With more deck space, it could accommodate more personnel and equipment
and, most importantly, more simultaneous activities safely and efﬁciently.
With its additional versatility, the
Development Driller II could also perform functions that customarily required

Udelhoven Inc. is a privately held company founded in 1970. Although the company’s activities are worldwide, our workforce numbers around 600. Udelhoven’s
signature contribution to major projects
is to provide companies like BP with
an unparalleled management corps for
building what is often a ﬁrst-of-its-kindand-size asset on time and on budget.
When a company like BP undertakes
a major project like Atlantis, it can’t just
redistribute its own managers to new
construction duties. It needs a readyto-go construction management team
dedicated to high standards, able to deliver them over long-term projects, and
bring the project in.
Many companies claim their people
are their most important asset. At Udelhoven, we mean it and our clients know
it better than anybody. Our people are
highly skilled, with years in the industry.
Many of our ﬁeld personnel are
name-requested by clients who also
often ask that whole teams from previous projects be brought together for upcoming projects. It is common for many

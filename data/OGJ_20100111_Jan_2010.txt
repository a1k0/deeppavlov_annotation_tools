Knowledge is power.
At URS, we believe that the more involved you are with
a process from beginning to end, the better equipped you
are to provide solutions. So when it comes to meeting
today’s increasing demand for oil and gas, we bring proven
experience with us — from oil sands, gas production, and
petroleum reﬁning to constructing a facility, maintaining
one, or developing an expansion plan. Which is why, in the
Industrial & Commercial sector, more people are turning
to us to get it done. We are URS.

COVER
The Seven Ocean rigid reeled pipelay vessel at the Subsea 7 pipeline
fabrication facility in Port Isabel,Tex., has onboard part of the
8-in. insulated flowline for Marathon Oil Corp.’s subsea Droshky
development in Gulf of Mexico’s Green Canyon Block 244.Water
depth at Droshky is about 2,900 ft.The vessel laid two parallel
18-mile flowlines from Droshky to Shell Exploration & Production Co.’s Bullwinkle fixed platform. Marathon expects first oil and
gas production from Droshky in mid-2010.The article in the
OGJ Focus: Drilling and Production section, p. 39, describes the
design of equipment for determining, at the rig site, drilling fluid
weight material sag. Photo from Marathon.

General

Interest

China, Venezuela sign round of energy agreements
China and Venezuela signed five agreements, one concerning
refining and two touching on exploration and development of oil
fields in the Orinoco Belt.
At the signing ceremony in Caracas, China National Offshore
Oil Corp. (CNOOC) agreed to help the Venezuelan government
assess oil reserves in the Boyaca 3 oil block in the Orinoco belt.
Venezuela’s state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA)
and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (Sinopec) also signed an
agreement to establish a mixed company to develop the Junin 8
Block.
CNPC and PDVSA agreed to set up a mixed company to develop
a 400,000-b/d refinery in Cabruta that will refine oil from the
Junin Block 8.
The two countries also signed an oil export agreement, which
could see up to 560,000 b/d heading to China in 2010, as well
as a deepwater technical advice agreement between CNOOC and
PDVSA.
Analyst IHS Global Insight said the agreements indicate growing ties in the oil sector between the two countries, with Venezuela seeking to diversify exports away from the US and to secure
finances to develop new oil reserves.
Global Insight also said China is keen to take advantage of the
fall in crude oil prices and global demand over the past year to
secure long-term supply deals from producer states like Venezuela
as its own import dependence rises.
Earlier this year, Russia and Venezuela, during Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez’s 2-day visit to Moscow, signed a similar
package of energy agreements, including one to develop the Latin
American country’s Orinoco belt and its 235 billion bbl of heavy
oil reserves (OGJ Online, Sept. 11, 2009).

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

However, to head off a potential budget shortfall, members
of Indonesia’s House of Representatives, urged the government’s
upstream watchdog BPMigas to reduce the cost recovery given to
oil and gas contractors.
“For now, BPMigas should limit the amount of cost recovery,”
to $10 billion from $11.05 billion, said Suharso Manoarfa, vicechairman of the House’s budget committee, in a hearing with the
government and the central bank (OGJ Online, July 28, 2009).
After allegations of insufficient transparency in the reimbursement process, Indonesia’s parliament eventually imposed restrictions on cost recovery payments in 2009, capping the total budget
for the scheme at $11.05 billion in 2009 and setting the cap at $12
billion for 2010.
However, these restrictions recently were singled out as a major contributory factor behind falling investment in the country.
As a result, plans were announced by Evita Legowo, director general at the energy ministry, to encourage the finance ministry to
abandon the caps.
“We as the player in this business fully support the government’s decision,” said Budi Basuki, president director of Medco
E&P Indonesia.
While the decision to drop the caps may be welcomed by Budi
and other members of the country’s oil and gas industry, analyst
BMI doubts the measure will do anything to improve Indonesia’s
efforts to attract investment.
“Although this is a step in the right direction, we doubt that
it will be sufficient to stem the fall in upstream investment, and
we expect the results of the country’s next licensing round to be
disappointing,” said BMI.

Russia, Turkmenistan revise gas contract
Russia and Turkmenistan have agreed to new terms on gas

Indonesia drops plan for cost recovery payments trade while their presidents, Dmitry Medvedev and Gurbanguly
Unable to attract enough investors to develop new oil and gas
blocks, the Indonesian government plans to abandon its recently
adopted practice of capping the annual cost recovery payment reimbursed to contractors.
“The policy of capping cost recovery is not appropriate. This
is not supposed to be capped. We will fix this matter,” said Coordinating Economic Minister Hatta Rajasa, referring to plans by
the government to reimburse all contractor cost items within the
scope of the cost recovery payment rules.
“We have corrected this,” Hatta said. “The most important
thing is not to cap the payment, but how to avoid moral hazard
[in the payment].”
Under Indonesia’s production-sharing contract regime, Jakarta
must refund investors’ full exploration costs once fields enter production.

Berdimuhamedov, signed a broader agreement on strategic energy
cooperation.
Turkmenistan sells gas to Russia under the 25-year Interstate
Cooperation Agreement signed on Apr. 10, 2003.
Under the revised contract, Russian purchases of up to 30 billion cu m/year of Turkmen gas—about two-thirds the level of
recent years—will resume Jan. 1, under a price formula based on
the European gas market.
Medvedev said it will be the first link of Russian purchases of
Turkmen gas to European prices.
Deliveries of Turkmen gas to Russia ceased 9 months ago after
the rupture of the main Turkmen export pipeline. Turkmenistan
blamed Russia for the incident, which came amid pricing disputes.
The energy-cooperation agreement will cover joint pipeline
construction, according to a senior Russian official.

Dana Gas makes ninth discovery in Nile Delta
Dana Gas reported a natural gas discovery with its Orchid-1
well in the West Manzala concession of the Nile Delta. The find
marks the firm’s ninth discovery in the region in recent months.
Dana said Orchid-1 was drilled 1.3 km west of its Azhar-1 well,
and was spudded on Dec. 15, 2009, reaching a total depth of 1,700
m in the Pliocene Kafr El Sheikh formation.
The well found 8.4 m of net pay of excellent sand reservoir of
Kafr El Sheikh formation, and tested dry gas at 12.6 MMscfd.
Dana said it is currently studying the options for producing
Orchid-1 through either its El Wastani or South El Manzala gas
plants.
“The preliminary estimated recoverable reserves of the Orchid
discovery range between 10-50 bcf of dry gas, pending further
appraisal,” the firm said.
Dana said the find follows its eight previous gas discoveries
in Egypt announced in 2009: Salma-1, West Manzala-2, Azhar-1,
Tulip-1, Sharabas-1, Sama-1, Faraskur-1, and Marzouk-2.
As a result of the finds, Dana said it has successfully achieved
its yearend production target for Egypt operations by delivering a
production rate “in excess of 40,000 boe/d.”
Overall, Dana Gas Egypt said it has delivered an average production rate of 34,750 boe/d during 2009. Compared to 2008, this
represents an increase of 27% on the end of year production rate
and is a 20% increase on the average daily production rate.

but Petrolia said it might frac the interval depending on results of
work to be carried out at Haldimand in early 2010.
The two wells are 220 miles north of gas production at McCully field near Sussex, NB.
Petrolia holds interests in 3.7 million acres of leases or 18%
of Quebec territory including Anticosti Island in the Gulf of St.
Lawrence.

Origin group makes oil, gas find off Tasmania

The Origin Energy Ltd. group has made a natural gas and oil
discovery in its Rockhopper-1 wildcat in Bass basin permit T/18P
off northern Tasmania. The size and commercial significance of
the find will be assessed following wireline logs and a test program.
Wireline pressure data has confirmed multiple hydrocarbon
zones within interbedded sands and shales of the Lower Eastern
View Coal Measures in the prospect. Selective wireline sampling
also recovered oil from some sands and liquid-rich gas from others.
The thickness of individual sands varies from 1 m to 5 m. Reservoir quality also appears to be variable.
No definitive water-bearing sands were encountered in the
target horizons and the joint venture is now contemplating drilling a sidetrack into a down-flank location to establish hydrocarbon column heights.

Connect,” Paper No. SPE 123996) said ConocoPhillips was interested in developing the rigless pump in order to lower the cost
for replacing pumps in sanded up wells in the West Sak Unit on
Alaska’s North Slope.
The paper noted that wireline-conveyed through-tubing pump
sections have been available but these still needed a workover rig
to deploy or retrieve the pump’s motor, which was run on tubing.
The rigless ESP has a slim ALC designed permanent-magnet
motor connected to the pump section that a wireline unit can
deploy or retrieve in 4.5-in. tubing with a 3.833-in. drift ID.
The initial pump installation still needs a workover rig for deploying the electric cable conventionally on the tubing string. A
wet connector in the bottomhole assembly of the tubing string
links the cable to the wet-connector system on the ESP.
ALC also said the production engineering and well services department of Saudi Aramco has plans to install a rigless ESP in early
2010.

Concession awarded for Adriatic gas field
Production from Guendalina natural gas field in the northern

MOG earlier expected production to begin in the last quarter of
2010 (OGJ, May 18, 2009, p. 34).
It now says Eni expects to begin development this month or in
February, install the platform in 20 m of water 25 km off Ravenna,
Italy, this year, and complete the drilling of two wells in the first
half of 2011.
MOG says Eni studies indicate Guendalina production will be
about 20 MMcfd. Proved and probable reserves are 22 bcf.

Statoil to upgrade Snorre complex
Statoil ASA will invest more than 5 billion kroner to ensure
increased production and continued profitability from its Snorre
field. The field “has the largest remaining reserves of Statoil’s
fields on the Norwegian Continental Shelf,” said Torstein Hole,
senior vice-president of the firm’s western exploration and production operations in Norway.
“A number of extensive modifications have been carried out
in recent years to make the installations more robust for increased
production and an extended lifetime up until the year 2040,” Hole
said in an article published on Statoil’s web site. “We are the NCS
field carrying out most modifications in 2009-10. Total capital
expenditure for Snorre in 2009 and 2010 amounts to 5 billion
kroner, of which health, safety, and environmental measures account for over 50%,” he said.
The flotel “Safe Scandinavia” is to arrive at Snorre A next summer and will increase the field’s sleeping capacity for 6 months
for more workers for additional projects and maintenance. The accommodation quarters on Snorre will be upgraded in that period,
with more single-occupant rooms to be built and noise-reduction
measures implemented.
The two platforms at the Snorre field will be upgraded and the
present fire and gas alarm will be replaced with a modernized system at a cost of 450 million kroner. Apply Sorco AS was awarded
the main contract for the upgrade.
“We will get a completely revamped, modern system with a
much improved coverage compared to the current one. This will
make the platform’s warning system more robust and will represent a big safety improvement,” said Hole.
The comprehensive project will extend 3 years to 2012. “While
the platform is in full operation, and the current warning system
is operative, some 1,700 detectors will be removed and 2,000 new
ones installed; 36 km of cable will be taken out and 47 km of new
cable installed,” Hole said. ✦

Putin launches first phase of ESPO oil line
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, eyeing the emergence
of new markets in Asia-Pacific, launched the first phase of the East
Siberia-Pacific Ocean (ESPO) oil pipeline.
“It is a strategic project, which enables us to enter the growing
markets of the Asia-Pacific region,” Putin said in a ceremony at the
port of Kozmino on Russia’s Pacific Coast.
At the ceremony, Putin initiated the loading of the first tanker,
The Moscow University, which was set to deliver the ESPO-brand
crude to Hong Kong, according to Nikolai Tokarev, president of
Russia’s pipeline monopoly OAO Transneft.
In October, officials at Russia’s energy ministry said the new
ESPO-brand crude will be light and medium-sour, superior to
Urals export blend but inferior to Siberian Light (OGJ Online, Oct.
12, 2009).
Transneft last month completed the first 2,757-km stretch of
the pipeline which runs from Taishet in the Irkutsk region to
Skovorodino near the Chinese border.
At Skovorodino, oil is currently being loaded on to railcars for
transport to Kozmino, which lies 2,100 km further east. The rail
connection will be phased out in 2012 when Transneft completes
the second section of the pipeline from Skovorodino to Kozmino.
The first phase of the line is capable of carrying up to 30 million tonnes/year of oil, about half of it earmarked for China via a
67-km pipeline spur from Skovorodino to the Chinese border, and
the other half destined for export from Kozmino. The full ESPO
line will eventually carry up to 80 million tpy of oil.
The first phase of the ESPO project cost $12.1 billion, while
another $2 billion was spent on construction of the Kozmino terminal.
Transneft will spend another $10 billion to build the pipeline
extension to Kozmino, which analysts said will become Russia’s
third largest seaborne oil outlet after Primorsk on the Baltic Sea
and Novorossiisk on the Black Sea.

Mackenzie Valley pipeline gets federal approval
Canada’s federal Joint Review Panel approved the Mackenzie
Valley natural gas pipeline after considering its environmental and
social effects.
The JRP was created in 2001 to streamline regulatory processes
around the pipeline. In 2006, it launched public hearings in the
Northwest Territories with the expectation of submitting a report
by mid-2007. However, the deadline was extended at least twice as
the panel analyzed its findings.
The pipeline would stretch more than 750 miles to transport
Mackenzie River Delta gas to Alberta and beyond. Plans call for

initial capacity of 1.2 bcfd, expandable to 1.9 bcfd.
Imperial Oil Ltd. (34.4%), ConocoPhillips Canada (15.7%),
Shell Canada (11.4%), and ExxonMobil Canada (5.2%) launched
the project in 2000. The consortium also includes aboriginal
partners, known as the Aboriginal Pipeline Group Inc., consisting of five First Nations tribes and their financial backer
TransCanada Pipelines Inc., which seeks to move the gas south
to US markets.
TransCanada Corp. Chief Executive Officer Hal Kvisle estimates
the regulatory delays contributed $3 billion (Can.) to the project’s
$16.2 billion total cost. Costs include $7.8 billion for the Mackenzie Valley mainline, $3.5 billion for the gas gathering system,
and $4.9 billion for anchor-field development (OGJ, Feb. 9, 2009,
p. 54).

FERC issues final EIS for proposed Bison pipeline
A proposed 301-mile natural gas pipeline in Wyoming, Montana, and North Dakota would result in some significant environmental impacts that could be mitigated to acceptable levels, the US
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said on Dec. 29.
The 30-in. Bison Pipeline Project—which a TransCanada Corp.
subsidiary plans to build from the Powder River basin to a connection with the Northern Border Pipeline in Morton County,
ND—would be designed to transport as much as 477 MMcfd of
gas, FERC’s staff said as it issued a final EIS environmental impact
statement on the proposed project.
It said environmental impacts would be significantly reduced if
the proposed project, which includes one compressor station, two
meter stations, 19 mainline valves, and three pig launching and
receiving facilities, is built and operated under applicable laws and
regulations, Bison’s stated mitigation plan, and additional measures recommended in the EIS.
The pipeline would be colocated with existing utility rightsof-way for about 53 miles, or 17.6% of its total route, FERC
said. “The proposed route has been significantly influenced by
agency recommendations to avoid sensitive wildlife habitats and
vegetation types,” it indicated. “Bison has been responsive to
landowner requests for minor route modifications and has adopted many of these into the proposed route evaluated in this
final EIS.”
Bison Pipeline LLC, the TransCanada subsidiary planning to
build the project, said its daily capacity could be expanded to 1
bcf, and that future development plans include expansion and extension of the pipeline into Rocky Mountain basins. It plans to begin construction in 2010 after receiving the necessary regulatory
approvals, with a proposed Nov. 15 in-service date. ✦

Sandrea observed, “Global crude oil
production has…remained flat at 71
million b/d since 2004” and went on
to comment that three-digit oil prices
may be “lurking on the horizon” (OGJ,
Nov. 23, 2009, p. 37). Indeed, all too
often projections of future oil demand
and production are made without fully
considering the impact of oil prices.
Over 50 years ago M. King Hubbert
made an important contribution to our
understanding of oil production trends
saying that for any given geographical
area, from an individual oil-producing
region to the planet as a whole, the rate
of petroleum production tends to follow
a bell-shaped curve. “Peak oil” occurs
when production can no longer be increased to meet demand.
He correctly predicted that production of oil from conventional sources
would peak in the continental US in
the period 1965-70. In fact, oil production will peak and then decline in any
petroleum region, province, or single
country as long as producers continue
to find and produce large reserves of
comparatively low-cost crude in other
areas. Hubbert went on to predict a
worldwide oil peak in “about half a century” but did suggest that the actions of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries might flatten the global
production curve, delaying the peak for
perhaps 10 years.
During his era of cheap oil it is
understandable that Hubbert failed to
appreciate the impact that rising oil
prices would have on consumption
and, consequentially, on oil production.
Worldwide “peak oil” is a myth stemming from the failure to recognize that
a worldwide shortage of any commodity in demand results in higher prices,
thereby stifling demand.
Projections of future world oil production cannot simply be linked to demand but must factor in the price of oil
which triggers a complex set of interrelationships. Higher oil prices provide a
strong incentive to use less energy, and
demand weakens. Oil exploration accelerates, and oil reserves increase accordingly. Alternative energy sources become
more attractive.

All of these responses to higher oil
prices push “peak oil” further into the
future. Thus, “peak oil” is like the desert
mirage that recedes as one approaches
it. Although rising oil prices have the
feedback effect of suppressing demand
and increasing petroleum reserves, this
cannot go on indefinitely. But the assumption that world oil production will
peak and then decline is illusory and
only prevails in the absence of rising oil
prices.
Today, in the context of world petroleum production and factoring in rising
oil prices, “peak oil” becomes “plateau
oil.” There will be no abrupt peaking of
world oil production followed by a decline as postulated by Hubbert. Instead,
there will be an extended period when
oil continues to be available at “prevailing prices.” Over time, prevailing prices
will fluctuate along a rising trend line,
thereby prolonging “plateau oil.”
The key, of course, is the impact that
rising oil prices will inevitably have in
discouraging oil consumption and in
the development of alternative energy
sources. This scenario will continue
to play out over an extended period
until oil production, even at elevated
prices, can no longer meet demand and
production gradually declines from its
plateau.
Oil reserves are finite. The production of most OPEC producers has topped
out; they do not have the capability of
significantly increasing production.
Ongoing exploration and recent discoveries of immense presalt hydrocarbon
reserves in deepwater offshore areas
assure continuing crude oil supplies.
This will not be cheap oil but will
require heavy capital investments to
develop, bring on line, and maintain on
production. The resulting higher crude
oil prices will also improve the economics of extracting oil from tar sands and
perhaps oil shale, thus adding new but
costly reserves.
Clearly, the petroleum industry is not
perched on the edge of oblivion. There
will be no abrupt decline in production
in accordance with Hubbert’s “bellshaped curve” prediction. Instead, the
world faces a period of “plateau oil,” a
time when the demand for oil moderates in response to higher oil prices and
production levels off accordingly.
This can be seen in world crude oil
production levels which have remained

relatively stable in the range of 72-74
million b/d since 2004 following years
of growth. We have entered a new period where the rising oil prices increasingly dampen demand and where world
production no longer rises annually to
accommodate demand but begins to
stabilize.
The challenge is to see how long this
leveling-off period can be maintained.
The industry’s future is in the hands and
minds of those geologists and engineers
who can see opportunities and capitalize
on them. Those who can find and produce oil in increasingly hostile environments will prosper. The earth’s finite oil
reserves are being gradually depleted but
are by no means near exhaustion.

Health care and energy
The political shenanigans contorting reform of US
health care show, yet again, the towering virtue of
governmental self-restraint. To question state activism, of course, is to risk being branded as a reflexive
government-hater. Yet it requires no such predisposition to see that legislation affecting all Americans has
been corrupted. And it requires no such predisposition to want to shoo political vultures away from
other crucial issues—such as energy.
On health care, Democratic lawmakers began
with the lavish ambitions of President Barack
Obama and have been contending with reality
ever since. Inevitably, as details emerged about
costs and consequences, public support for politically misshapen bills in the House and Senate—
though not, perhaps, for reform itself—melted
away. The House hurriedly and narrowly passed
a bill on Nov. 7, and the Senate passed its more
moderate version of the legislation on Dec. 24,

pend on budgetary tricks. And its flirtation with
federal spending for abortion has become heavy
political baggage.
Health care reform deserves better than this.
But no issue can receive constructive treatment
in the hands of self-righteous politicians pushing
extreme reform against popular doubt. Energy
certainly cannot.
After it finishes with health care, Congress
very likely will turn to energy, which in the current political milieu means rejecting oil, gas, and
uncleansed coal in favor of uncompetitive but
politically preferred alternatives. Stated reasons
to impose such reform are the twin fancies of
climate-change mitigation and energy independence. Unstated reasons include the chance to
dispense favors to political friends hawking economically hopeless energy.
Americans already have witnessed the mess
that results when Congress applies to energy the
squalid machinery at work on health care reform.

Lower oil and natural gas prices and
depressed refining margins resulted in
a sharp reduction in the third-quarter
2009 earnings of oil and gas producers
and refiners.
The combined earnings of three
samples of companies were down
across the board for the third quarter
and first 9 months of 2009. OGJ looked
at groups of US-based oil and gas producers, Canadian producers
and pipeline
operators, and
service and supply firms, each
of which posted
declines as compared to the year-earlier periods.
In the third quarter of 2009, the
front-month futures price of oil on the
New York Mercantile Exchange averaged $68.25/bbl, down from $118.22/
bbl in the corresponding 2008 period.

Meanwhile, gas futures on the NYMEX
averaged $3.441/MMbtu in the third
quarter of 2009, down from $8.987/
MMbtu a year earlier.

US operators
The sample of oil and gas producers
based in the US posted a combined 74%
decline in earnings in the third quarter
of 2009 compared with a year earlier.
For the first 9 months of the year, earnings fell 86%.
Commenting on the integrated
firms’ third-quarter results in light
of the sharp drop in oil prices in the
recent quarter as compared with the
same period in 2008, the Centre for
Global Energy Studies (CGES) said,
“The real significance of these figures
is that the companies’ downstream elements failed to offset the performance
of their upstream components, as one
would expect to happen in integrated
enterprises.”

2nd quarter. 23rd quarter July 31.

GGES said, “In the case of Chevron
[Corp.] and ExxonMobil [Corp.], the
downstream figures are dramatically
worse. Usually, one would expect refinery operations to ameliorate the losses
resulting from a falling oil price, due to
improved margins, but in this instance
downstream profits have also been
squeezed, particularly in the [Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development], most likely because the
steep run up in oil prices since March
2009 has not been mirrored by similar

increases in oil product prices.”
Chevron reported third-quarter
earnings of $3.8 billion—a 52% decline
from a year ago. The major’s upstream
earnings were down 41% from a year
ago, and the company’s downstream
segment earnings fell to $194 million
from $1.8 billion in the comparable
quarter in 2008. Chemical earnings
climbed to $164 million in the recent
quarter from $70 million, Chevron
reported.
ExxonMobil reported that its up-

stream earnings, excluding special
items, were $4 billion, down $5.3
billion from the third quarter of 2008.
Lower oil and gas realizations accounted for the majority of the decline, reducing earnings by $4.9 billion. Higher
operating costs reduced earnings by
$300 million.
Downstream earnings of $325 million were down $2.7 billion from the
third quarter of 2008. Lower refining
margins drove the decline, ExxonMobil
said, reducing earnings by $2.6 billion.

Petroleum product sales of 6.3 million
b/d were 387,000 b/d lower than last
year’s third quarter, mainly reflecting
asset sales and lower demand.
Stone Energy Corp., based in Lafayette, La., is the only company in
the sample of US operators to report
an increase in its third-quarter profits
from its year-earlier positive earnings.
But for the first 9 months of 2009, the
company incurred a loss largely due to
a $340 million writedown in its oil and
gas properties.

Keep OCS sale on schedule, Va. governor-elect tells Salazar
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Robert F. McDonnell, who will
become Virginia’s governor this month,
has asked US Secretary of the Interior
Ken Salazar “to do everything in your
power” to ensure that a planned 2011
sale of federal oil and gas leases off the
state’s coast stays on schedule.
“Offshore energy exploration and
production will be a priority in my
administration,” said the governor-elect
in a Dec. 23 letter to Salazar. “I would
like to work with you and [US President
Barack Obama] to make Virginia an
international leader in offshore energy
exploration and production on the Atlantic coast. It is important for both our
commonwealth and our country.”
A spokeswoman for Salazar said on
Dec. 29 that McDonnell’s letter is being
reviewed. “In regards to the specific
question on timing, [the secretary] is
reviewing the proposed Virginia lease
and at this point he hasn’t made any
decisions,” she said in an e-mailed
response to an OGJ inquiry.
McDonnell, a Republican, is due to
be inaugurated Virginia’s governor on
Jan. 16, 2010, succeeding Timothy M.

on Feb. 19, 2009, to postpone the lease

2009’s reasons
to chuckle

B

efore the season to be jolly
completely slips away, let’s look
back at some of 2009’s amusing moments in government and issue this
column’s annual “Watchy” awards.
Many of us will return all too soon
to tackling several very serious issues, but that doesn’t mean we can’t
take time out for some chuckles now.
From the outset of 2009, it looked
as if US Rep. Jim Costa (D-Calif.)
would easily win the year’s Apt Comparison Watchy with his frequent
references to using “every tool in
our energy toolbox” as he chaired
actual fact-finding hearings of the
House Natural Resources Committee’s Energy and Mineral Resources
Subcommittee.
But Costa was edged out of the
Apt Comparison Watchy for 2009
on Nov. 10 when Margo Thorning, senior vice-president and chief
economist at the American Council
for Capital Formation, told the US
Senate Finance Committee that having watched the cap-and-trade debate
for 15 years, she was reminded of
someone trying to lead a horse across
a cattle guard.

legislation to federally regulate hydraulic fracturing, to seek a comprehensive study “instead of jumping
directly to a new and potentially
intrusive regulatory system.”
A DeGette spokesman confirmed
that the two spoke, that she agreed
that a study was needed, and that
she didn’t plan to back off on her
bill. We’re betting that Ritter’s name
won’t be on DeGette’s dance card
when Colorado’s Democrats hold
their next spring formal.

‘Clunkers’ complaint

Watchy for the Renewable Fuels
Association after its president, Bob
Dineen, complained on July 30
about the House’s voting to transfer
$2 billion from the US Department
of Energy’s renewable energy loan
guarantee program to keep the “Cash
for Clunkers” program going.
Conceding that there are benefits
in the federal program paying people
to trade in less fuel efficient cars for
newer models, Dineen added: “These
new cars should also be running

ended. Unfortunately, it appears that virtually no progress has been made at the
federal level to get this process rolling.”

Took first step
The US Minerals Management Service took the first step toward holding
Outer Continental Shelf Lease Sale 220
off Virginia on Nov. 13 when it published a call for information and interest/nominations and a notice of intent
to prepare an environmental impact
statement covering about 2.9 million
acres some 50 miles off the state’s coast.
The proposed leasing area may contain 130 million bbl of oil and 1.14 tcf
of natural gas, MMS said. It is accepting comments on the call and the EIS
notice through Jan. 13.
McDonnell asked that Virginia remain in the current 5-year federal OCS
plan, and that the federal administrative process for the 2011 lease sale move
forward immediately. “Any effort to
remove or delay Virginia’s participation
in the lease sale would significantly
hamper our efforts to create jobs,
eliminate much-needed new revenue,
and undermine support for President
Obama’s stated commitment to make
the United States more energy secure,”
he warned.
The chief executives of two leading oil and gas industry associations
separately applauded McDonnell’s
action on Dec. 29. “It is time for the
Interior Department to take action to
allow expeditious leasing of federal oil
and gas resources off Virginia’s coast.
The [governor-elect], and the majority
of Virginians, want such action,” said
American Petroleum Institute Pres. Jack
N. Gerard.
Virginia could become the first
area on the Atlantic OCS to be federally leased in nearly 30 years, noted
National Ocean Industries Association Pres. Tom Fry. “America cannot
have increased energy supply without
increased access, and new areas of the
OCS cannot be leased unless they are
included in 5-year leasing plans and
sales are scheduled,” he said, adding,
“None of this can happen unless the

EIA 2010 forecast sees
falling US oil imports
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
A significant increase in US biofuels production
could make the nation less dependent on imported
oil, the US Energy Information Administration said
in an early release of its 2010 Annual Energy Outlook
reference case.
The scenario, which EIA released on Dec. 14, did
not include potential impacts of carbon dioxide emissions restrictions and other possible future policies. It
also only included technologies that are commercially
available or can reasonably be expected to become
commercial in the next decade. EIA nevertheless forecast declining US reliance on imported liquid fuels.
“Our projections show that existing policies that
stress energy efficiency and alternative fuels, together
with higher energy prices, curb energy consumption
growth and shift the energy mix toward renewable
fuels,” EIA Administrator Richard G. Newell said.
“However, assuming no new policies, fossil fuels
would still provide about 78% of all the energy used
in 2035.”
The reference case forecast a 16% increase in total
US liquid fuels consumption, including both fossil
liquids and biofuels, to an average 22 million b/d in
2035 from 19 million b/d in 2008. “Biofuels account
for all of the growth, as consumption of petroleumbased liquids is essentially flat,” EIA said, adding, “As
a result, reliance on imported oil declines significantly over the next 25 years.”
The scenario also envisioned US oil production
climbing 20% from 5 million b/d in 2008 to more
than 6 million b/d in 2027—where EIA expects it to
remain through 2035. It cited more onshore production resulting from wider use of enhanced oil recovery and increased production offshore as primary
causes.
It forecast that total US energy consumption would
grow by 14% from 2008 to 2035 as fossil fuels’ share
declines from 84% to 78%. “Recent federal and state
policies, and rising energy prices could moderate
growth in energy consumption and shift it to renew-

case was that total US gas production
would grow 13% from 20.6 tcf in 2008

House move promised against EPA’s GHG finding
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
A US House Republican energy
leader said he plans to introduce a
resolution expressing disapproval of

the Environmental Protection Agency’s
greenhouse gas emission (GHG) endangerment finding.
“EPA’s endangerment finding plainly
was intended to make the president’s
policies look good in advance of his

visit to the Copenhagen global warming conference, not to advance any
public good in America,” said Joe Barton (Tex.), the Energy and Commerce
Committee’s ranking minority member.
“But it also has policy implications that

NPRA suggests alternatives to EPA’s proposed GHG regulations
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The National Petrochemical & Refiners Association recommended three
alternatives on Dec. 23 as it submitted
comments to the US Environmental
Protection Agency opposing EPA’s
proposed greenhouse gas regulations
under the Clean Air Act.
“The path to [GHG regulation under
the CAA] that EPA has chosen is difficult, uncertain, and unnecessarily risky
in these troubling economic times.
The Tailoring Rule that is the subject of
these comments is doomed to failure,”
NPRA said.
“Fortunately, the timing, manner,
and content of EPA’s overall approach
to regulating GHGs under the CAA [are]
firmly with the agency’s control,” NPRA
said, adding, “Our comments outline
ways in which EPA could proceed down
alternative pathways that provide more
sensible regulation without [resorting]
to extraordinary administrative law
principles that cannot be applied in
these circumstances.”
EPA issued the proposed rulemaking, “Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tai-

24

loring Rule,” on Oct. 27. It would require
facilities emitting more than 25,000
tons/year of GHGs to obtain permits
demonstrating that they are using best
practices and technologies to minimize
GHG emissions, according to information at the agency’s web site.
It also proposes new GHG emissions
thresholds defining when CAA permits
under the New Source Review and Title
V operating permits programs would
be required for new or existing industrial plants. The proposed thresholds
would “tailor” the requirement so it
would not apply to small farms, restaurants, and other small businesses
while covering refineries, power plants,
and other large installations that EPA
said are responsible for nearly 70% of
the nation’s total GHG emissions from
stationary sources.

Endangerment finding
The proposed rulemaking’s significance increased with EPA’s Dec. 7
announcement that it had determined
that six GHGs pose significant dangers
to human health and are potentially
subject to CAA regulation.
NPRA recommended that EPA interpret that the CAA’s PSD provision be

triggered only after a National Ambient
Air Quality Standard is established for
a pollutant. “Under this interpretation,
which is fully consistent with the CAA
and EPA’s regulations, the [Section]
202 Rule would result in GHGs only
being subject to Best Available Control
Technology requirements if a source
otherwise triggers PSD for a criteria
pollutant,” it said.
The agency also could delay issuing
the 202 rule until it and the states are
better prepared to address GHG permitting, NPRA continued. “EPA could
use this time to pursue streamlining
of PSD and Title V requirements on an
aggressive time scale to avert the large
economic impacts that the agency indicates Congress did not intend,” it said.
NPRA said EPA also could specify
that under the 202 rule, the date
when GHGs are considered subject
to “actual control” would be when
vehicle manufacturers must comply
with an attribute-based standard for
the 2012 model year. “This would avoid
an imminent PSD trigger for stationary sources and give states and EPA
more time to address GHG permitting
issues,” the association said in its comments.

threaten serious damage to the economy for generations to come.”
He said the finding “accurately
reflects the thousands of candid,
outrageous e-mails that EPA’s allies in
the global warming community sent
to each other by demonstrating that
public relations priorities, rather than
straightforward science, are driving US
policymaking on global warming, and
nowhere did any demonstrate a whiff
of concern for who pays the bill or how
they earn their living.”
House GOP leaders said three committees’ ranking minority members,
Darrell E. Issa (Calif.) of Oversight and
Government Reform; F. James Sensenbrunner (Wis.) of Energy Independence
and Global Warming; and LaMar S.
Smith (Tex.) of Judiciary, back Barton’s
effort, as does Ralph M. Hall (Tex.),
who also is on the Energy and Commerce Committee.
Barton’s announcement came 3 days
after Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alas.), the
Energy and Commerce Committee’s
ranking minority member, said she
planned to file a disapproval resolution
aimed at keeping EPA from regulating
GHGs under the Clean Air Act as a con-

sequence of its Dec. 7 endangerment
finding (OGJ Online, Dec. 16, 2009).

Boxer responds
Senate Environment and Public
Works Committee Chairwoman Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) expressed her own
disapproval of the Republicans’ plans.
“Debating over policy about unchecked global warming is fair, but
repealing an endangerment finding
based upon years of work by America’s
leading scientists and public health
experts is radical in the extreme,” she
said, adding, “I am urging my colleagues to distance themselves from
these dissenters and not to interfere
with the independent work of scientists
and public health experts from both the
Bush and Obama administrations.”
EPA issued its finding after conducting a study in response to a 2007
US Supreme Court ruling that GHGs
fit within the Clean Air Act’s definition of pollutants. The finding does
not impose any emissions reduction
requirements by itself but does allow
the agency to finalize GHG standards
for new light-duty vehicles as part of a
joint rulemaking earlier this year with

the US Department of Transportation.
Barton suggested the finding would
do much more. “Everyone also understands that [it] is supposed to prod Congress into resuscitating cap-and-trade
legislation that is dying from overexposure to public scrutiny,” he said.
He said the policy envisioned by
the Obama administration would take
“money out of the pockets of those
lucky to have jobs so that radical environmentalists can wage a war against
nature.”

GOP leaders applaud
House GOP leaders applauded the
four lawmakers’ plans. “Republicans
stand united against this EPA ruling because it is a job-killer,” Minority Leader
John Boehner (Ohio) said.
“The recent EPA decision to treat the
air we exhale as a dangerous pollutant
will hurt families and small businesses,” added Republican Conference
Leader Mike Pence (Ohio).
But Boxer said efforts to stop EPA
are misguided. “Republicans are using scare tactics and false economic
arguments to support this effort,” she
said. ✦

be needed to conduct a thorough evaluation and peer review of a potential

Alaska officials file objections to polar bear habitat proposal
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The State of Alaska filed strong
objections to the US Fish and Wildlife Service’s proposal to designate
200,541 sq miles in the state and
adjacent ocean as critical habitat for
polar bears.
The area would be larger than California and cover nearly the entire US
range of polar bears, they noted.
“By law, a critical habitat designation should balance the concern for the
species with consideration for economic impacts,” said Alaska Attorney
General Dan Sullivan. “That has not
been done here. Moreover, the designation should cover only those areas
actually necessary for special protec-

ment with several environmental organizations, DOI agreed to publish a final
rule designating critical habitat for the
polar bear no later than June 30, 2010,
FWS said. The Oct. 22 proposal was a
step toward fulfilling that agreement, it
indicated.
“The FWS acknowledges that the
sum of documented impacts from
activities, such as oil and gas development and shipping, have been minimal
on the polar bear population,” the
lawmakers said, adding, “Data provided
by monitoring and reporting programs
in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, as
required under the more restrictive Marine Mammal Protection Act incidental take authorizations for oil and gas
activities, have shown that oil and gas
activities can coexist with polar bears
through the use of appropriate mitigation measures.”
They added they support FWS efforts to assure polar bears and other
wildlife thrive and recognize the polar
bear “has become iconic in the climate
change debate, and as such, any policy
affecting them quickly becomes one infused with emotion and attention from
certain special interest groups.”

tion. Instead, the service has included
areas lacking any special features and
has ignored the protections already in
place for polar bears under the Marine
Mammal Protection Act.”
Denby Lloyd, commissioner of the
Alaska Department of Fish and Game,
said, “Proposing the entire range of
a species as critical habitat is inconsistent with the facts and with the
service’s own previous decisions on
Alaska species such as the Steller’s
eider and Northern sea otter.”
Sullivan also emphasized the importance of the state’s role in providing
formal comments on the designation
of critical habitat and urged the federal
agency “to take into account the state’s
very legitimate concerns.” Alaska’s

state government will continue to
monitor how FWS implements critical
habitat for polar bears, he indicated.
The proposed designation is overly
broad and a job-killer for Alaskans and
other Americans, Gov. Sean Parnell
maintained.
“While [FWS] has yet to provide an
economic study of the impacts from
its proposed decision, major oil and
gas exploration and development efforts will, at best, be delayed by this
designation,” he said. “The service’s
overly broad critical habitat designation simply means more projects must
jump through more regulatory hoops.
Neither Alaska nor our nation can afford these job-killing moves, nor can
we remain so dependent on other nations for our energy supplies.”

They said, “We strongly urge the
FWS to use sound science and incorporate any applicable technological
and scientific advances when determining the most effective way to
proceed forward with the polar bear
proposed critical habitat. As climate
modeling and scientific technology
continue to develop, we trust that the
FWS will reevaluate any determinations.”
The letter produced an immediate response from Consumer Energy
Alliance Pres. David Holt. “Balancing

the safe, responsible development of
America’s abundant natural resources
while ensuring its critical habitat is preserved is something we can do, must
do, and in fact have done for many
years,” he said.
“Unfortunately, the [FWS] proposal,
as currently written, seeks to lock
up enormous resources of American
energy [which] could create thousands
of good-paying jobs and help stabilize
energy prices for struggling consumers
when they need it most,” Holt observed. ✦

f India and China thought their
oil and gas industries would have
favored status around the world, they
were mistaken. That was underlined
when investment fund TIAA-CREF
sold investments from Chinese and
Indian companies operating in Sudan’s upstream.
“Our decision to sell shares in
these companies culminated a 3-year
effort to encourage them to end their
ties to Sudan or attempt to end suffering there,” said Roger W. Ferguson Jr., TIAA-CREF chief executive.
“We have not divested from Petronas, which has acknowledged our
concerns and engaged in dialogue
about how it might address them,”
Ferguson said, giving executives in
Kuala Lumpur a reprieve.
TIAA-CREF reminded investors
of plans it announced last March to
intensify pressure on five companies
that maintain business relations with
the government of Sudan to “cease
those relations or attempt to ease suffering and end genocide in Darfur.”

With that in mind, TIAA-CREF
said it would:
• Seek meetings between TIAACREF executives and executives of
target companies to encourage them
to take positive and meaningful humanitarian steps and attempt to end
genocide.
• Publicly endorse the UNsponsored Principles for Responsible
Investment. Signatories include institutional investors with a combined
$2.5 trillion in assets under management with whom “we will join to
urge companies operating in Sudan
to confront human rights abuses.”
• Call upon other financial services
companies to “follow our lead and
increase pressure on target companies.”

York’s Department of Environmental
Conservation nears the end of a 2-year
process to develop a draft Supplemental
Generic Environmental Impact Statement (SGEIS)—the set of regulatory
standards that guide natural gas exploration and extraction in the state.
The draft SGEIS proposes stringent
new regulatory standards to monitor
gas exploration in the Marcellus shale.
“The extremely stringent requirements proposed by the SGEIS provide
the public with the necessary oversight
that natural gas exploration and extraction will be conducted in an environmentally safe manner,” the letter said.
The letter followed earlier reports
that New York City urged the state to
ban natural gas drilling in its watershed, becoming the most powerful opponent to date of a process that critics
say is poisoning drinking water.
Putting the city at odds with the gas
industry, Steven Lawitts, the city’s top
environmental official, said hydraulic
fracturing or fracing techniques used to
produce the gas represented “unacceptable threats to the unfiltered fresh water supply of 9 million New Yorkers.”
According to Marc LaVorgna, a
spokesman for New York Mayor Michael
Bloomberg, “Based on all the facts, the
risks are too great and drilling simply
cannot be permitted in the watershed.”
At that time, Gov. Paterson, who will
play a major role in deciding the future
of drilling next year as he slashes state
services to close a $3.2 billion budget
deficit, said he was still listening to “all
points of view.”
Paterson told reporters, “We’ve actually extended the public comment period because of the grave concern that
so many who we trust, like the mayor,
are raising in this issue.”
Earlier this year, New York proposed
new rules that would allow drilling
for natural gas in the Marcellus shale
formation. New York City is asking the
state to exclude the watershed from the
areas that can be drilled.

reports that Spectra Energy Corp. has
signed binding precedent agreements
with Chesapeake Energy Corp., Consolidated Edison, and Statoil Natural Gas.
The agreement calls for an expansion of Spectra’s existing Texas Eastern
Transmission and Algonquin Gas Transmission pipeline systems to deliver
“new, critically needed” gas supplies to
the New Jersey and New York area.
The proposed pipeline would be capable of transporting up to 800 MMcfd

of gas supplies to the region and is targeted to be in service in fourth quarter
2013.
Aspects of the proposed expansion
include:
• Construction of a new, 16-mile
pipeline extension that connects Texas
Eastern’s existing pipeline in Staten
Island, NY, to a new interconnect with
ConEd in New York.
• Replacement of 5 miles of existing
pipeline in New Jersey and New York

with larger diameter pipeline.
• Additional facilities on Spectra
Energy’s existing Algonquin pipeline
system.
Chesapeake Chief Executive Officer
Aubrey K. McClendon said his firm’s
“industry-leading position in the Marcellus shale provides the perfect supply
source to help energy consumers in
the New York City area reduce their
dependence on expensive imported oil
and carbon-heavy coal.” ✦

Mexico’s natural gas imports to soar by 133%
Mexico’s demand for natural gas will
continue to outstrip production, with
imports to cover the country’s requirements set to rise by 133% during 200924, according to government figures.
Mexico’s El Financero newspaper,
citing figures supplied by the Secretaria
de Energia (Sener), said the country’s
imports of gas will grow to 3.02 bcfd
from the current 1.293 bcfd.
According to the report entitled
Outlook of the Natural Gas Market,
Mexico’s gas production grew 4.2%
over the last decade, while the demand
growth stood at 5.9%, representing a
1.7% shortfall to be filled by imports.
El Financero said this trend will be
maintained until 2024, when the country’s production will reach 8.668 bcfd,
equivalent to an average growth rate
of 2.3%/year. But it said that “demand
will surpass 11 bcfd, which implies an
annual growth rate of 2.8%.”
The Sener report said Mexico’s demand growth has been met partly with
increasing gas imports, first from the
US and then from other countries, with
the establishment of LNG terminals in
Altamira and Ensenada, in 2006 and
2008, respectively. It said the imports
represented 3.7% of national demand in
1998, but 18.6% in 2008.
The Sener report explains increased
demand for gas as coming from the
launch of combined cycle plants to
generate electricity, the moderate substitution of fuel oil in the electric and

industrial sectors, greater requirements acknowledges deepwater production is
for the oil industry, and to a lesser
important, but “given the environmendegree, the use of gas that distributors

Alaska’s giant Umiat oil field, discovered in the late 1940s by the US Navy
in search of new sources of oil after
World War II, remains undeveloped to
this day.
The field is untapped in spite of
delineation by 12 legacy wells; the shallow depth of its consolidated, productive reservoirs; sweet, light 37° gravity
oil; and over 1 billion bbl of original
oil in place.
To this point, remoteness (92 miles
from the Trans Alaska Pipeline System
(TAPS)), permafrost,
and low reservoir
energy have been
the main development challenges. All
of these challenges have been addressed through modern technological advancements such as multilateral
horizontal drilling, electric submersible pumps, and cold gas injection for
pressure maintenance that bring Umiat
development closer to fruition.
Remoteness and environment is still
a key challenge; however, the State of
Alaska announced in December 2009
an aggressive plan to build an all-season gravel road from TAPS to the Umiat

area that would substantially reduce the
threshold for commerciality.
Geologic mapping by the US Navy in
1944 first defined the Umiat anticline
with its associated oil seeps.
The Navy and the US Geological
Survey conducted an extensive mapping
and drilling program in this remote
part of northern Alaska from 1944 to
1953. In particular, between 1946 and
1952, a total of 11 wells were drilled on
the Umiat anticline. Eight wells have an
oil column and two wells had longterm tests.
Much of this early drilling was experimental utilizing a variety of types
of drilling rigs as well as different types
of drilling fluids. A deeper test, the
Seabee-1, was drilled in 1978 and tested
gas from a deeper horizon.
The Navy established an air base at
Umiat and used the light oil for fuel.
So unlike other Arctic pending developments, Umiat has an established
footprint including an airstrip, lodging,
warehouse storage, etc.

deltaic sandstones and contains over 600 ft of net sandstone
available for net pay at Umiat.

Reservoir architecture
The block diagram in Fig. 6 shows the 12 legacy wells
drilled at Umiat, the Upper and Lower Grandstand main
productive horizons, and a possible deeper objective below
the shallow oil field.
Umiat is a large ultrashallow (500 to 1,400 ft) oil accumulation. The solid green color represents proved, probable,
and possible recoverable reserves of 250 million bbl of oil,
and the stippled green pattern represents potential additional
resource. Compared with the 7,500-acre Upper Grandstand
oil accumulation, the Lower Grandstand oil accumulation
has an areal extent of 5,600 acres.

Well correlations and rates
Fig. 7 is a correlation cross section encompassing all the
legacy wells drilled at Umiat.
The first well on the left is the Seabee well followed
from left to right by wells 1 through 11. Note the erosion of
the upper oil bearing reservoirs in wells 2 through 5. The
lower oil bearing sandstones in the Chandler Tongue are not
eroded, and the basal Chandler Tongue shale provides the
top seal for the Upper Grandstand reservoir.
Across the top of the cross section are the oil pump rates
for the wells. The Seabee well, on the far left, was drilled
to evaluate deeper objectives and not tested in the shallow
productive horizons.
Wells 1 through 3 were drilled with fresh water, and ice
formed across the perforations in the zone of permafrost
resulting in no flow. The low pump rates in the remainder
of the wells were caused by inadequate pump capacities and
formation damage from very high mud weights.
The two long term tests were at Well 5, which pumped
at the rate of 400 b/d of oil for 93 days, and Well 9, which
pumped 200-300 b/d of oil for 45 days. It was noted for
Well 5 that the rate was limited to the capacity of the pump;
the capacity of the well is not known.

Reservoir-fluid properties
The Navy acquired conventional core in the productive
horizons in almost every legacy well, particularly in the
main Upper and Lower Grandstand reservoirs.
Fig. 8 is a cross-plot of Upper and Lower Grandstand porosities vs. permeabilities for most of the wells with an inset
picture of the reservoir rock from core.
The Grandstand reservoirs are fine-grained, consolidated
sandstones with an average porosity of 14% and an average
permeability of 55 md.
Porosity and permeability for the Grandstand reservoirs
are based on 200-plus core samples taken from 10 wells. The
porosity of the productive reservoirs varies from 10% to 20%
with an average of 14%, and the permeability varies from 1

dating techniques indicate they were
uplifted to their present shallow elevation in Lower Tertiary time during the
formation of the Brooks Range thrustfold belt.
The fluid properties are also shown
in Table 1. The Umiat crude is light
sweet oil with 37° gravity. The viscosity
measured on five oil samples is nearly 3
cp at 100° F. After applying correction
for reservoir temperature it is estimated
to be 7-9 cp.
The pour point of Umiat oil is less
than –5° F., which indicates that the
oil is mobile in the reservoir that is
within permafrost, primarily the Upper Grandstand sands. This has been
proven by the oil produced in several
tests from the reservoirs in the permafrost.

As of 1960, Umiat was expected to
be the largest oil field in Alaska.
The discovery of the supergiant
fields on the northern coast in the late
1960s decreased the interest in developing what is still a large accumulation
compared to the average size of an oil
pool worldwide.

The nearest commercial traffic access road is the TAPS pipeline haul road
(Dalton Highway) almost 92 miles to
the east. Although the Prudhoe Bay
area has significant oil and gas infrastructure, it is located 220 miles away
even after an Umiat access road is built.
However, there is an airstrip for year
round access, and Umiat has lodging,
warehouse storage, etc.
Umiat is planned to be developed
using the proven methods that were
employed for the Alpine development,
which was roughly 70 miles west of
Prudhoe Bay. At Alpine large sealifts
and truckable modules were used to
transport the facilities, including ones
constructed in Alaska, Canada, and the
Lower 48.

Pay opposite permafrost
The Arctic environment presents the
next most significant challenge. The
year-round average surface temperature
near 0° F. makes permanent habitation
difficult and expensive.

Vertical scale: 1” = 500’

One challenge particular to Umiat
is the presence of at least part of the oil
horizons within the permafrost zone.
Although this should not immediately
impact primary production rates when
compared to other reservoirs with
similar oil saturation and oil viscosity
(at reservoir conditions), it represents
unique challenges concerning secondary recovery or pressure maintenance
operations.
A discussion of adverse sand-face
plugging behavior in a 1960 US Bureau
of Mines report1 leads one to assume
that keeping the formation cold and
stable (steady state conditions) will
result in higher oil permeability than
allowing water to thaw then refreeze at
thermal boundaries.
Any water injected into the reservoir
would tend to freeze and block future
injectivity. Any gas injected above
reservoir temperature would tend to
thaw, and then refreeze any interstitial
water it came in contact with. Although
the behavior has not been documented

Horizontal scale: none

in the Umiat related literature, it is
likely that sweep efficiency would be
adversely affected by a moving water
front preceding a hot injection gas
front.
With this in mind, cold gas injection
is proposed by Renaissance as the preferred pressure maintenance technique
and was evaluated by both the Bureau
of Mines and recent third party reservoir engineering studies.
Although the Bureau of Mines report
stated that solution gas drive at low
reservoir pressure results in reasonable
recovery factors of 29% to 45% due to
the significant expansion of a small
amount of gas, makeup injection gas
would be necessary to optimize recovery from the low pressure reservoirs. A
recent third party reservoir engineering
study estimates typical recovery factors
of 22% for the UGS zones and 45%
from the LGS reservoirs.
These recoveries are currently being
researched further at the University
of Alaska, Fairbanks. For the reserves

study, parameters were risked downward to account for reservoir heterogeneity and typical underperformance of
horizontal wells compared to predevelopment simulation studies.
Renaissance has gas resources in the
area for pressure maintenance.

Horizontal drilling
Since 1960, horizontal drilling has
provided viable rates in fields that were
previously uneconomic.
On average, horizontal wells produce two to three
times the rate of the

similar vertical well.2 Recent theoretical
calculations predict rates could increase
by 6:1.3
In reservoirs like the Bakken in
Montana, the increase in productivity due to both horizontal drilling
and multiple hydraulic fractures has
provided the only means of economic
production.
Horizontal drilling in Umiat field
would provide several benefits.
The first benefit would be re-

duced well counts to access the entire
structure and minimize additional
footprint.
The second benefit would be to allow segregated access to large portions
of the top and bottom of each of the
target sand bodies.
The third benefit is simply that rates
per wellbore of 1,000 b/d of oil or
more can be expected from dual lateral
wells.

Artificial lift options
Given the complex wellbore geometry, artificial lift optimization will
become an important driver for Umiat
profitability.
If recovery from the development
is to be maximized, withdrawals of
all liquids at the lowest possible bottomhole pressure will be a goal of the
artificial lift system. The use of electric
submersible pumps (ESPs) is currently
the preferred option. However, with
gas injection for pressure maintenance,
high gas-oil ratios may prevail with
time.
Recent experience in high gas/low
liquid horizontal producing environments has shown that fluids accumulating in low spots or “sumps” along the
horizontal wellbore length create an
oscillating gas surge that unloads fluids
but also tends to vapor lock the ESP
intake.
The ESP is planned to be placed in
the deepest straight and horizontal
section of the lower lateral of each
well. This should cause all liquids to
be removed from the wellbore at the
lowest possible removal point, thus
using gravity and fall-back to aid in gas
separation.
Since the wells are shallow, the
pump horsepower requirements are
not extreme and a short pump can be
pushed into the horizontal section if
the wellbore size is large enough and
doglegs are kept reasonable.
Gas lift is the other accepted technique for producing below a curved
portion of a wellbore. With gas injection as the secondary recovery method,
gas lift is a viable option and gas breakthrough will provide some additional
lift capacity.
Lift gas delivered at 400-600 psia
would be sufficient to lift significant
volumes of Umiat oil. This option
may be less capital intensive than ESPs
but requires greater gas compression
volumes.

Not all of these techniques mentioned are suitable for field applications
because of equipment size and complexity, while others show insufficient
reproducibility or require specially
trained staff to operate.
In the drilling industry, therefore,
there is a need for an accurate device
to determine a drilling fluid’s settling
potential.
The following describes the design
of a simple device that uses direct
weight measurement for sag determination.

Our equipment consists of a settling
chamber and a sampling cup that attaches to a laboratory scale with a steel
rod (Fig. 1). The equipment registers
solid material settling in the settling
chamber only when the material hits
the bottom of the sampling cup.
Using this simple principle and accounting for boundary conditions, we
can determine some settling parameters
that provide additional information of
the settling process.
One of the boundary conditions
needed is the area and volume of the
sampling cup vs. the total volume of
the settling chamber.
Design A (Fig. 2) has a sampling
cup with a cross-sectional area equal
to the area of the settling chamber (Di
= Do). This implies the sampling cup
collects most of the solid material in
the settling chamber. Some material,
however, will remain self-suspended
due to Brownian motion and some may
dissolve in the solvent (fluid). Because
the laboratory scale will not register
this material, there is some uncertainty
in the weight reading.
Design B (Fig. 2) has a sampling cup
with a much smaller base area than
the settling chamber (Di<<Do); the

sampling cup therefore only collects a
portion of the settling material. This
design will be influenced insignificantly by wall effects and by material
settling outside the sampling cup. The
only elements needed in the evaluation
is the area correction, sampling cup
capacity, and buoyancy effects.
The equipment used in our experiments (Fig. 3) consists of the laboratory
scale coupled with a modified atmospheric consistometer, as described in
API’s well-cementing testing standard.10
The consistometer is standard
equipment for the preparation of
well cement slurries before rheological measurements or for determining

thickening time. Using a consistometer
as base for our equipment design, we
benefit from having the option of using
the outer rotating cylinder to provide
the possibility for running sag tests at
dynamic conditions, for example, with
a simulated drillstring rotation.
The equipment is coupled to a cooling bath that makes it possible to run
tests at both high and low temperatures.
The sampling cup has an ID (Di) of
50.2 mm and inner height (Hic) of 49.6
mm, giving it a 98.2-ml volume. The
first step inserts the cup into the consistometer before the mounting of the settling chamber. A small gap between the

settling chamber and the sampling cup
allows the sampling cup to hang freely
in the suspension to be tested.
The sampling cup has a 56-mm
outer height (Hoc) and a 60-mm OD
(Do). It is attached to the laboratory
scale with a 6-mm steel rod. There is a
4-6 mm gap (H) between the bottom
of the sampling cup and the settling
chamber. This allows for a specific
amount of material to settle before
solids buildup underneath the sampling
cup affects the weight (Fig. 4).
The ID of the outer rotating cylinder
(Dioc) is 67 mm. This leaves a volume
of about 34 ml in the annulus between
42

the sampling cup and the outer rotating cylinder. In addition, the volume
underneath the sampling cup is about
19 ml.
The bulk densities of loosely packed
sand and barite used in our experiments were measured to be ~1.97 and
~2.37 g/cc, respectively.
From this it follows that for tests
with sand, the maximum capacity of
the sampling cup is ~194 g, while the
sampling cup can collect 233 g of barite
before being overfilled.

Buoyancy effects
If one adds particles to the fluid

after equipment assembly, as is the case
for the experiments described in the
article, we only need to account for the
buoyancy effect from the fluid density.
This assumes that the bulk volume of
particles added is less than the sampling
cup volume.
If one lowers the sampling cup into
a particle-laden fluid, the particles present in the fluid surrounding the sampling cup affect the weight readings.
This implies that, as settling occurs
in the annulus between the sampling
cup and underneath the sampling cup,
buoyancy changes.
Fig. 4 describes this phenomenon.
Particles settling underneath the sampling cup reduce the bulk density of
this volume and thereby reduce buoyancy and increase registered weight.
Similarly, if the bulk volume of the
settling material exceeds the sampling
cup volume, some material will settle
in the annulus between the sampling
cup and settling chamber’s wall. This
leads to increased buoyancy from the
suspension in the annulus and thereby
a lower weight reading.
In addition, particles settling out of
the suspension underneath the sampling cup will lead to a lower bulk density of the suspension surrounding it.
This will in turn lead to less buoyancy
and thereby higher weight readings.
For tests in which one adds solidsladen fluids after equipment assembly,
one needs to consider these elements.
For optimization studies in which the
particle content is equal, the described
design is still valid.

Settling parameters
Several practical measures of sag
in drilling fluids have been proposed.
Swanson et al. describes one of the
most commonly used measures that is
based on the density difference between the top (ρtop) and bottom layer
(ρbottom) of a fluid column.11 The difference defines a sag factor SF, Equation 1
in the equation box.
A sag factor of 0.5 thus corresponds
to a nonsagging fluid, while values
above some threshold identify potential

operational problems. Other measures
of sag also use the density variation to
identify a settling process as a significant sag incident.12 13 The density differences alone, however, are not sufficient
to predict sag incidents reliably.
For some operations one can still
operate successfully with higher density
differences than the set threshold value,
while other operations require much
smaller variations than specified. Furthermore, these measurements do not
consider the dynamics in the system
such as syneresis effects, for example,
the displacement of free fluid to the top
of the fluid column.
The equipment we developed allows
for determining additional parameters that provide a more general and
detailed description of the physics involved in the settling process. This includes the determination of parameters
such as total settling potential, settling
velocity or rate, and solid flux.

Settling potential
For all types of settling testing, the
mass of the total solid material content
in a sample normally follows from

the fluid composition. For particles
settling in a fluid, Archimedes’ principle applies: A body fully or partially
submerged in a fluid is buoyed by a
force equal to the weight of the fluid
displaced.
With a known quantity of dry material, Equation 2 calculates the total
settling potential (wTSP), where wdry is
the dry weight of the material, ρp is the
particle density, and ρf is the density of
the fluid suspending the solid material.
Equation 2 defines the settling potential, RS, as a ratio the mass of settled
material in the test (wSM) to the total
mass of material in the sample (wTSP)
given from the fluid composition.
For field applications, measurement
of this parameter can be relevant if the
well construction limitations are given
and one can determine an acceptable
settling potential, based on the available operational window.
The calculation requires a correction factor, Acor (Equation 4), when a
sampling cup does not cover the entire
bore (area) of the settling chamber
(Design B in Fig. 1). Di is the sampling
cup’s diameter, and Do is the inner
diameter of the settling chamber.
Equation 5 applies to a correction of
the settling potential.

Settling mass rate, flux
The time derivative of the settling
curve provides directly the settling
mass rate, qs (Equation 6). In the equation, m is the mass of settled material.
Fig. 5 shows a settling curve determined from a test that used our
equipment. In this case, Di equals Do
(Design A in Fig.1) and implies that the
sampling cup collects almost all settled
material and one can read the total settling potential, wTSP, directly from the
settling curve.
We define time of breakthrough (tb)
when qs = 0, such as when the mass
of material entering the sampling cup
equals the mass of material leaving it.
In addition, we now obtain wTSP and
it should equal the calculated values
given by Equation 2, provided that the
sampling cup volume exceeds the bulk
volume of particles in the suspension
and hence that no material settles outside the sampling cup.
The term “solid flux” expresses the
amount of material passing through a
selected area during a specified time
period (g/(m2-sec)). This provides a
more universal expression that also
includes the area correction.
From Fig. 1, it is clear that the solid
flux is inversely proportional to the
base area of the inner cylinder and is
then given by Equation 7, in which mp
is the mass of settled material and A

is the cross-sectional area where the
particles pass through.
A combination of Equations 2 and 7
gives the total settling potential (Equation 8).
In this manner, we have established
a system independent of test device
design that is more applicable than the
currently used sag definitions previously described.

Validation
To validate the performance of our
equipment, we carried out numerous
experiments with well defined model
suspensions. The initial two tests used
149.5 g of barite at a 4.2 g/cc and an
average 15-μm particle size (D50).
The first test involved pouring 400
ml of oil (ρf = 0.81 g/cc) into the test
chamber and then adding barite. The
second test was similar but used water
(ρf = 1.0 g/cc) in the settling chamber
before the barite addition.
These additions of particles to two
fluids should, according to Equation 1,
give final readings of 121.0 g and 113.9
g, respectively.
Fig. 6 shows that the first test with
barite added to oil gave a final reading
of 117.4 g, while the test with barite
added to water resulted in a 107.6-g
reading. This resulted in an error of
2.9% and 5.5%, respectively.
The test with water in the settling
chamber also obtained stable readings of ~7 g after 48-50 min before it
increased to 107.6 g. This probably was
caused by the high sensitivity of the
laboratory scale that registers nearby
movements.
At the end of the test period, the
weight was increasing slightly, and we
also observed some material settling
outside the sampling cup, causing the
discrepancy between the calculated
and measured values. Furthermore,
we observed some particles still to be
dispersed in the fluid at the end of the
test. These tests, however, show that the
equipment will measure the sedimentation rate adequately with a reasonable
accuracy.

44

Fig. 7 shows the solid flux for these
tests (Equation 7) using a sampling cup
with an ID Di = 50.2 mm. As observed
from the figure, the solid flux is higher
for particles settling in oil than in
water.
Fig. 8 shows the results of similar
experiments as in Figs. 6 and 7 but
using sand (Bascarp 10 delivered by
Askania AS) with a known particle size
distribution added to 350 ml of water
(ρf = 1.0 g/cc). The density of the sand
was 2.6 g/cc with an average particle
size, D50, of 114 μm.
Two tests were run during a short
period, both having 400 ml of water
in the settling chamber before particle additions. The first test added
50 g of sand to 400 ml of water. The
second test had two steps: first 16.5
g added before an additional 33 g,
which should, according to Equation 2
result in readings of 10.1 g and 30.4 g,
respectively.
For these experiments, the first
test showed an uncertainty of 0.9 %,
while the two-step test ended up with
uncertainties of 2.0% and 5.2% for each
step of the test. In each test, we again
observed that the fluid still suspened
some material at the end of the test,
explaining the discrepancy between
calculated and measured values. ✦

Stage 1: Prefiltration. A

provide maximum operating life to the liquid/liquid

and more importantly, 100%
rich-side filtration prevents
passage of suspended solids
that may deposit in downstream equipment such as
rich/lean heat exchangers,
column packing or trays, and
reboilers.

by amine contamination.
The residence time of the
flash drum was 22 min
on average, with a design
residence time of 19 min.
This was sufficient to handle
most hydrocarbon carryover
conditions.
A simple particle filter
assembly was installed on a
15-20% cleanup loop on the
lean-amine side. It offered
partial filtration of the lean
amine before the refineries’
contactors but no protection
for the Marsulex amine unit
and sulfur plant.
Following the planned
2006 expansion project, the
maximum amine recirculation flow capacity would
increase and therefore reduce
the residence time in the flash drum.
The operational residence time would
be reduced to 13 min (at operating
liquid level) or 9 min (at 50% liquid
level). This was considered insufficient
to separate liquid hydrocarbon from
the amine adequately, raising concerns
about the reliability of the plant under
the new operating regime.
In preparation,
Marsulex invited Pall
to perform an on
site demonstration
of rich-side full-flow
prefiltration and
liquid/liquid coalescence. Testing performed during the
fall of 2004 helped
better define the
contamination at the
outlet of the existing
flash drum. The site
trials also validated
the effectiveness of
rich-side filtration
and confirmed the
efficiency of the liquid/liquid coalescer
technology at separating hydrocarbons
from rich-amine.

Yearly refinery construction indexes listed for 80+ years
Gary Farrar
Contributing Editor

Here are yearly values for the Nelson-Farrar refinery inflation cost index
since 1926 (see tabulation above).
They are based on 1946 as 100,

since that was the date of index inception. Values from 1926 to 1945 were
back-calculated. ✦

I TEMIZED REFINING COST INDEXES
The cost indexes may be used to convert prices at any date to prices at other dates by ratios to the cost indexes of the same
date. Item indexes are published each quarter (first week issue of January, April, July, and October). In addition the Nelson
Construction and Operating Cost Indexes are published in the first issue of each month of Oil & Gas Journal.

Operating cost
(based on 1956 = 100.0):

cleaned out paraffin from the interior,
straightened the joints where needed,
and removed the fusion-bonded epoxy
coating from their exteriors.
PE then beveled the ends and sent
the pipe to a recoating yard. It is now
in service as a gas transmission line in
Oklahoma, saving the customers 30%
off the cost of new pipe.
An 8.625-in. OD pipeline relaid in
the 1950s near Amarillo, Tex., used one
of the first electric-weld constructions.
In service until 5 years ago, the pipe’s
coating remained well bonded and
the pipe itself in excellent condition. A
customer wants the pipe taken up with
minimal or no damage to the coating.
PE estimates 15% damage to coating,
an amount economically replaceable
in the field with patches, taking up the
pipe in 60-ft sections to decrease the
number of welds and limit trucking expenses. The customer plans to relay the
line for low-pressure natural gas service
in the Permian basin.
Another Texas gas producer and
pipeline company
has a policy in place
to purchase idled or
abandoned lines for
takeup and removal
to its own system.
On four occasions
in the past 3 years,
the company has
excavated, 8, 6,
and 12-in. OD line
pipe from dormant
systems, rehabilitated the pipe, and
relaid it.

“One Calls” or DOT calls flagging lines
for construction or other identification
purposes.
If the company maintains rights-ofway via mowing and general signage
upkeep, the costs can be extraordinary.
Judicial districts in many states assign
ad valorem taxes, school taxes, county
taxes, and state taxes to these properties. Theses taxes often go unquestioned
and are paid accordingly. Incidental
pipeline relocation expenses due to
highway and subdivision expansion
also seem to be simply passed off as a
necessary cost of doing business.

Pipeline operators have long abandoned retired equipment in place, seeking to reduce maintenance and care,
taxes, and upkeep while maintaining
ownership of idled pipelines. Federal
and state lawmakers and regulators,
however, wish to end this practice and
clearly define requirements for abandoning or idling out-of-use pipelines.
Idled pipelines pose potential hazards

often face pipeline relocation and identification issues, and landowners might
be unaware of rights-of-way.
Pipeline companies will be required
to remove pipelines if they are termed
abandoned or if they are idled with
demonstrated “intent to abandon”
by lack of maintenance, removal of
signage, failure to pay taxes due, etc.
Regulators will require companies
at least to identify dormant pipeline
inventory and obtain permission from
landowners before abandonment procedures of any sort.
Federal regulation remains pending,
but at least one Texas legislator from
Houston and another from the Fort
Worth (Barnett shale) area will introduce a bill in an upcoming session of
the state legislature requiring pipeline
operators to notify landowners before
abandonment and obtain permission
from affected landowners.

New pump jack uses magnet electric rotary motor
The new Mitey Titan pump jack uses a
permanent magnet electric rotary motor
that features large torque, low rotation
speed, low noise, and high power.
The pump jack was developed and
designed by Guizhou Aerospace Linquan Motor Co. Ltd., Guizhou, China, in
conjunction with Zhejiang University,
Hangzhou, China. Authorized distributors
include MTech Industries, Edmonton, and
Shanghai Grandway Telecom Tech Co. Ltd.,
Shanghai.
Features of the unit include high
efficiency, long life span, simplicity in
structure, ease of operation, light weight,
and small area needed for installation and
operation. The pump jack experiences
what the firms say are power savings upwards of 50% due to motor and frequency
conversion technology.
Additional components of the pumping
unit are the frame and frequency conversion control devices. Mechanical transmission parts have been eliminated with the

exception of the motor. The pump jack
has direct drive, eliminating the need for a
gearbox.
The motor is a three dimensional
permanently magnetic electric type compounded by a novel double-plate electric motor and an external rotor electric
motor. Utilizing know-how such as pole
conversion, frequency conversion, new
permanent magnetic materials, plate-panel
electric motor, and the external-rotor electric motor in addition to improvements in
structure, material, manufacturing technology, and the intelligent control system,
this motor offers higher torque vs. existing
low speed and high torque motors, the
firms say.
The permanent magnet electric rotary
motor works within the pumping unit’s
tower type structure and is supported by
a cylindrical steel post. The motor directly
drives the polished rod through the belt
system. The stroke and stroke frequency of
the rod are adjusted within a given range
through a frequency conversion unit. A

suspended weight is used as the balancing
weight, and the base flange of the post is
fixed to the foundation by bolts.

Trip coil monitor helps improve power system reliability
The newly released SEL-2652 trip coil
monitor checks on the connections and
circuit continuity of the circuit breaker trip
coil and lockout relay to give power system operators confidence that the breaker
is ready when needed.
The self-powered SEL-2652 indicates
circuit breaker status with a clearly visible
external LED and a contact output for
alarms or SCADA.
The unit provides constant monitoring
of the health of trip circuits and lockout
relays with an easy-to-use, reliable device,
the firm says.

Europol: Emission
trading fraud costs
Europe €5 billion
By the time it ended, the Copenhagen climate summit had become farcical
enough to obscure an instructive disclosure that emerged in the confab’s early
days. At this writing, quarrelling summiteers were straining to assemble some
token agreement that would keep their
effort from looking like more than an international contest for other people’s money.
Not even Nobel Laureate Barack

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

Obama, who took time off from his healthcare fiasco in the US to prod international
leaders into valiant combat against climate
variation, could rescue the moment.
Glaciers, therefore, seem destined
to continue melting, which they were
going to do no matter what happened in
Copenhagen. A greater hazard to human
well-being lurks in the US Congress, where
Obama’s political party is fragmenting
over a thunderously unpopular campaign
to overhaul health care.
The danger is that Democratic social
engineers will channel their frustration
over an inevitable health-care retreat into
a reinvigorated push for greenhouse gas
emission control via cap-and-trade.
It’s on that threat to prosperity that a
report by Europol, the European law-enforcement cooperative, has much to teach.
On Dec. 9, 2009,Europol said the European Union’s Emission Trading System, a
cap-and-trade scheme, had been fleeced
for €5 billion in the preceding 18 months
by fraudulent trades.
“It is estimated that in some countries
up to 90% of the whole market volume was
caused by fraudulent activities,” it said.
Criminals apparently had been buying
emission allowances in countries where
they didn’t have to pay Europe’s valueadded tax (VAT) and reselling in VAT countries, collecting the tax from buyers and
disappearing without passing the money
on to authorities.
Suspicion arose in response to unprecedented increases in emission trading in
late 2008. After France, the Netherlands,
the UK, and Spain changed tax rules
to prevent exploitation, market volume
dropped by as much as 90%.
The ever-present threat of trading fraud
is a powerful reason for the US to spurn
cap-and-trade. Congressional supporters
of the approach insist they can fashion
controls that will keep emissions trading
within honest bounds. But they’re largely
the same people who, behind closed doors,
are turning health care into political hash.

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

A ‘virtual’ oil price gain
The front-month contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes traded as high
as $80/bbl before closing at $79.36/bbl Dec. 31 in what many described as a 78%
price jump during 2009 and its biggest surge since 1999 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. But Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland, charged the
alleged 78% gain is “purely a virtual number that will look good only on a misleading investment brochure.”
Had a leveraged trader bought a NYMEX crude contract at the end of 2008 and
rolled his position on “the penultimate day of expiry” at the end of 2009, his earnings would have totaled $19.44/bbl for the year, a 43.6% gain, Jakob said. A trader
who rolled his front West Texas Intermediate position on the first day of the month
would have made $16.18/bbl or 36.3%, while one who bought the February 2010
contract at the end of 2008 in order to avoid the contango roll would have made
$19.12/bbl “but on a higher flat-price basis, hence a return of 31.74%,” said Jakob.
“The real tradable returns of WTI in 2009 depend on the timing of the roll of the
position, but if we average the roll on the first day of the month, on penultimate
day, and the unrolled February 2010 returns, then we come to a WTI increase of
$18.25/bbl or 40.9% during 2009, which is about half the virtual gains printed on
the continuous charts and reported by the mass media.” Jakob said. “If we are to
compare the 2009 WTI returns based on the February contract (i.e. unrolled position) then the returns for 2009 were only the fourth best of the last 10 years, and
that is only because there were 3 negative years. In other words, over the last 10
years for those years that had positive returns on WTI, 2009 was the worse year in
terms of percent returns.”
Jakob said, “The largest loser of the year would have been the investor…buying commodity exchange traded funds or commodity indices under the belief that
he was buying a futures-look-alike contract while he was buying a net-asset-value
instrument based on futures. In a contango structure any net-asset-value instrument on commodity futures will mathematically underperform the direct purchase
of a commodity futures. This being said there are many asset managers [who] are
happy to pay a higher commission for an underperforming investment vehicle to
cover for their lack of understanding of the markets they are investing in.”
In money markets, Jakob said, “The euro made strong gains during the year but
came back under pressure during December to bring it closer to the start-of-theyear value, and large speculators have been getting overly bullish on the dollar
index.” Crude prices continued increasing in December while the dollar index also
rebounded. Jakob observed, “There is nothing sacred in a dollar-to-oil correlation
but with crude oil prices rising in tandem with the dollar index, it means that Brent
on a euro price basis is at the highest level of 2009, and that could start to hit the
European demand price elasticity.”
Price forecasts
Analysts in the Houston office of Raymond James & Associates Inc. claim their
2009 oil price forecast was “unusually” accurate. “For the first time in 7 years,”
they said, “our forecast…did not prove overly conservative. At $60/bbl, our oil
forecast was near consensus and ended almost dead-on with the full-year average
of $58/bbl—despite the panicky meltdown in oil prices that reached its trough in
February.”
Raymond James analysts’ 2010 forecast is for $80/bbl, “which assumes modestly higher demand and falling non-OPEC supply.” They expect bullish supply and
demand trends to continue for several years and set their initial 2011 forecast at
$95/bbl.
On the other hand, they admitted, “Our bearish 2009 US gas price forecast was
directionally accurate but still 20% too high.” Their gas price forecast of $5/Mcf at
the start of the year was well below Wall Street’s $7.31/Mcf consensus. Gas prices
slid steadily through the third quarter as they expected but further than predicted,
averaging $4/Mcf for the year. This year they are lowering their gas price prediction to an average $5/Mcf from $5.50/Mcf previously; their initial 2011 gas price
prediction also is $5/Mcf.
Raymond James analysts expect US gas prices to hover around $5/Mcf for
several years because that is the price level at which US gas supply rises, LNG
imports increase, and gas-to-coal demand switching takes place.

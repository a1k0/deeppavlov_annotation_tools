NFS-BlackSeal®, NFS-Cement Shield®
NFS-Super Squeeze™

NFS-Blackseal is a graphite
based blend of several
resilient materials including
fibers, minerals, and polymers
designed to help reduce
seepage losses during the
drilling of a depleted zone.
NFS-Cement Shield is a
dewatering system that can
be applied through the drill
string, MWD, LWD into any
fracture to create a strong
bridge. It can be pumped
ahead of any cement job to
aid bringing cement to the
desired depth.

NFS-Super Squeeze is a dewatering
system that can be applied directly
into the well bore to create a strong
bridge. A broad PSD range can assist
reducing or eliminating major mud
losses by filling all vugular and
cavernous formations.

KPO ‘in talks’ with Kazakhstan over Karachaganak
Kazakhstan’s Prime Minister Karim Masimov said his country is
negotiating to purchase a stake in the Karachaganak gas-condensate
project from Karachaganak Petroleum Operating BV (KPO), a consortium of BG Group, Eni SPA, Chevron Corp., and OAO Lukoil.
“Currently, talks on this issue are ongoing between the energy
ministry, [Kazakhstan’s state-owned] KazMunaiGas (KMG), and all
the project participants,” said Masimov, referring to BG and Eni, each
with a 32.5% interest, along with Chevron 20% and Lukoil 15%.
The government’s aim of purchasing a 10% stake, first reported
last month, has been linked with efforts by KPO—including international arbitration—to secure a refund of more than $1 billion for export duties it should not have to pay under its final
production-sharing agreement.
Under the FPSA, signed in 1997 by the Kazakh government
and KPO partners, the consortium is to operate the Karachaganak
facilities until 2038.
Some industry analysts suggest the government is using export
duties as a pretext for pressuring the consortium to sell a stake in
the Karachaganak project similar to its successful effort to gain a
stake in the Eni-led Kashagan project.
In 2008, the Kazakh government doubled its stake in Kashagan to
16.8%, following a protracted dispute with the Agip-led consortium
over costs and production delays. Eventually, the newly formed North
Caspian Operating Co. BV—including KMG—replaced the Agip consortium as operator of the field (OGJ, Feb. 2, 2009, p. 33).
However, according to one analyst, the government’s current
move is more about money than it is about control of the project.
Karachaganak “is very profitable for investors and if you join the
project at a later stage of development you have smaller operational and financial risks,” Artem Konchin, an oil analyst at UniCredit
SPA told Bloomberg News.
Kazakh officials are aware of the value of the KPO project. In
December, Massimov and other officials joined KPO executives to
launch the first leg of the Karachaganak-Uralsk gas pipeline being
built by KPO in the Western Kazakhstan Oblast.
“The pipeline goes through the territory of five districts, and it
potentially allows for gasification of 146 settlements within Western Kazakhstan Oblast,” said Massimov, calling the development
“a great achievement.”
The second leg of the Karachaganak-Uralsk pipeline is due for completion in second half 2010. When complete, the Karachaganak-Uralsk
pipeline will supply gas to the villages situated on the left bank of the

Ural River along the way between Karachaganak field and Uralsk City.
According to KPO partners, Karachaganak is one of the world’s
largest oil and gas-condensate fields. Covering more than 280 sq
km, it is estimated to hold more than 1.2 billion tonnes of oil and
condensate and more than 1.35 trillion cu m of gas.

Tajikistan: Investment needed to boost production
Tajikistan needs a considerable increase of investment for the
quickest development of the country’s natural gas resources, according to a senior government official.
“A record amount of natural gas was produced in Tajikistan in
the 1970s, 525 million cu m/year, when huge funds were invested
in this sphere,” said Azim Ibrohimov, who heads the country’s
main geology directorate.
Today—taking into account industrial enterprises—the country needs annual production of 800 million cu m to 1 billion cu m
of gas, Ibrohimov said, adding, “A multifold increase of funding is
needed today to produce at least similar amounts of domestic gas.”
Ibrohimov, who noted that five companies prospect for gas in
the country, said there is still no fully encouraging information
that Tajikistan could fully supply all of its own gas.
“Taking into account prospecting work done by these companies, one cannot say that Tajikistan will (fully) be provided with
its own natural gas in the near future,” Ibrohimov said.
The comments come as Tajikistan faces a crisis over its gas supplies
from neighboring Uzbekistan. Earlier this month, Uzekistan’s stateowned Uzbektransgaz reduced its supplies of natural gas to Tajikistan
by 50% due to a dispute over payment (OGJ Online, Jan. 11, 2010).

EU, Iraq sign strategic partnership MOU
European Union Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs and
Iraq’s Minister for Oil Hussain Al-Shahristani signed a memorandum of understanding outlining priorities for an “energy strategic
partnership,” which includes Iraq as a possible natural gas supplier to the Southern Corridor gas lines.
For its part, the EU could help Iraq develop its electric power
system and tap its vast renewable resources.
Areas of cooperation covered by the MOU involve development of an Iraqi energy policy, an energy action program for
2010-15, assessment of Iraq’s hydrocarbon pipeline network, enhancing pipeline safety and reliability, identifying sources and
supply routes for gas from Iraq to the EU, and a plan for development of renewable energy in Iraq. ✦

The company turned to sales its Robert Crawley Gas Unit-1 well
in Live Oak County which flowed 17 MMcfd of gas with 7,300 psi
wellhead flowing pressure on a 24⁄64-in. choke from a 5,400-ft lateral after a 16-stage frac. True vertical depth is 14,000 ft.
The Eagle Ford shale at the Crawley location, 3 miles south of
Pioneer’s liquids-rich Sinor-5 discovery well, is 1,000 ft deeper
and has a 30% thicker pay zone than at the Sinor location.
The well’s goal was to test productivity towards the dry gas
window in a deeper, thicker Eagle Ford shale section with a longer lateral and additional frac stages. With the highest gas rate
reported to date in the play, Crawley-1 exceeded the company’s
expectations and confirmed that dry gas wells provide strong economics at today’s prices.
Pioneer holds more than 2,000 sq miles of 3D seismic data,
logs from more than 150 operated wells, proprietary core samples, and microseismic results in the Eagle Ford play. It is operating two horizontal rigs with wells in DeWitt and Karnes counties
under way, both targeting liquids-rich areas.
Two asset teams will report to William F. Hannes, formerly
executive vice-president business development, who is named executive vice-president South Texas operations. They are the existing South Texas asset team and the newly formed Eagle Ford shale
asset team.
Pioneer named three other executive vice-presidents: Danny
L. Kellum over Permian operations, Jay P. Still over Midcontinent
operations in addition to Rockies, Alaska, and Barnett shale assets,
and Chris J. Cheatwood over business development and geoscience-engineering technology.

Drilling

&

Thailand’s PTT Exploration & Production PLC (PTTEP) agreed
to farm into a 20% interest in three exploration blocks off northwestern Australia.
It became the fourth stakeholder in blocks WA-378-P (3,634 sq
km), WA-396-P (4,467 sq km), and WA-397-P (3,886 sq km), joining the joint venture led by Woodside Energy Ltd.
The farm-in represents PTTEP’s fifth venture in Australia where
the state-owned firm is seeking to further its presence.
The joint venture plans to drill an exploration well this year
after seismic showed ``great potential for gas,’’ said PTTEP chief
executive Anon Sirisaengtaksin.
After PTTEP’s 20% farm-in, Woodside Energy has a 50% stake
in those permits, Mitsui E&P Australia Pty Ltd. holds 20% and
Toyota Tsusho Gas E&P Browse Pty Ltd. has 10%.

Pakistan Petroleum signs exploration pacts
Pakistan Petroleum Ltd. (PPL) has signed two oil and gas exploration agreements with the Pakistani government.
PPL signed concession agreements for the 2,459-sq-km 246712 Jungshahi block and the 2,436-sq-km 2568-18 Gambat South
block, both in Sindh.
PPL intends to invest more than $17.05 million in the blocks
over 3 years for work including 2D and 3D seismic surveys and
drilling.
The agreement resulted from a Sept. 30, 2009, bidding round.
PPL operates Sui, Kandhkot, Mazarani, Adhi, and Chachar
fields in Pakistan with total production of 786 MMcfd of gas,
4,989 b/d of oil, and 150 tonnes/day of LPG. ✦

Shell, Petronas sign Majnoon contract with Iraq
Iraq’s Ministry of Oil has signed a 20-year contract with Royal
Dutch Shell PLC and Malaysia’s Petronas to provide technical assistance in the development of the Majnoon oil field.
The consortium targets a production plateau of 1.8 million b/d
of oil, up from a current level of 45,000 b/d. Majnoon, which lies
in southern Iraq, is one of the world’s largest oil fields.
Lead operator Shell will hold a 45% share, with partner Petronas holding 30%. The Iraqi state holds 25% of the participating
interests in all licenses.
“Iraq’s oil and gas reserves are among the largest in the world
and we look forward to applying our experience and technology
to support ongoing efforts to rebuild the country’s energy infrastructure,” said Shell Chief Executive Officer Peter Voser.
The signing follows the contract award on Dec. 11, 2009, and
the approval of the Iraqi Council of Ministers on Jan. 5.

Shell begins drilling for shale gas in Sweden
Royal Dutch Shell PLC, despite opposition from environmentalists, has begun to drill for shale gas in Sweden, saying there may
be enough gas to make the country self-sufficient for a decade.
“There could be enough gas to cover Sweden’s gas needs for
at least 10 years,” said a Shell spokesman, adding that the firm is

drilling its first well now and expects to finish three wells by the
end of March.
Shell’s drilling program has met with resistance from local
residents, according to the Skanska Dagbladet newspaper which
last week said neighbors to the planned drilling site appealed to
the Environmental Court over an earlier approval by the county
administrative board.
Last November, the county administrative board of Sjobo gave
the green light to Shell’s application to conduct test drilling for gas
in the municipality. That approval came after an earlier one by the
Swedish Mining Inspectorate.
The approvals have been granted despite objections of some
local residents and activists who fear the drilling program could
have adverse effects on the environment, especially on the region’s
water supplies.
Goeran Gustafson, a science teacher active in a green group
which seeks to stop the project, expressed concern about the impact on ground water, saying that it could be contaminated by
heavy metals and other dangerous substances.
Sweden is one of several countries in Europe where exploration
for shale gas is being carried out by international oil and gas companies. Others include the UK, France, Germany, Austria, Poland,
and Hungary.

By yearend, ConocoPhillips and 3 Legs Resources are expected
to have test results from northern Poland (OGJ Online, Sept. 21,
2009).
The International Energy Agency estimates that unconventional gas resources in Europe, including coalbed methane, could
amount to 35 trillion cu m, six times higher than the continent’s
conventional gas resources.

ficer, said construction is on schedule for delivery of the fourth
8500-series semi later this year.
Rigs in the series can drill to 35,000 ft in 7,500 ft of water.
Each has a hoisting capacity of 2 million lb and 8,000 tons of variable deck load. Each has an open layout to accommodate subsea
completion work.
The rigs can be modified to drill and complete wells in 10,000

ConocoPhillips advances Surmont expansion

A subsidiary of Ensco International PLC has taken delivery of
the third of seven ultradeepwater semisubmersible rigs being
built for it by Keppel FELS Ltd., Singapore (OGJ, July 20, 2009,
p. 43).
After sea trials and final outfitting in the Gulf of Mexico, the
new rig, Ensco 8502, will begin drilling late in the second quarter
under a 2-year contract with a subsidiary of Nexen Inc., which has
the option to extend the term by 1-2 years.
Dan Rabun, Ensco chairman, president, and chief executive of-

ConocoPhillips Canada Resources Corp. said it will start construction this year of the second-phase of its steam-assisted gravity
drainage (SAGD) Surmont oil sands project in Alberta. The company expects production from Phase 2 to start in 2015.
Phase 2 will increase Surmont bitumen production capacity to
110,000 b/d from 27,000 b/d, the company said. Production from
Phase 1 started in October 2007.
Surmont is a joint venture of ConocoPhillips and Total E&P
Canada Ltd. The project lies in the Athabasca oil sands region
about 40 miles southeast of Fort McMurray. ✦

Processing
Chevron plans downstream restructuring
Chevron Corp. plans to restructure its global downstream business in a move company officials said would leave the organization smaller and less complex.
A video message to employees from Mike Wirth, executive
vice-president for the company’s global downstream business,
warned of unspecified workforce reductions.
According to a report by the Houston Chronicle, Wirth told
employees details of the restructuring would be available in
March. The plan is to be in place by the third quarter, he said.
Chevron confirmed that employees had been told of the reorganization and the streamlining of staff that will result. A company official told Oil & Gas Journal the video message made no
new announcement about assets or the markets in which Chevron
works.
The official said downstream assets and markets have been
subject to “ongoing review” for many months and already have
resulted in cutbacks of various forms.
The video message follows a Jan. 11 interim financial update
from Chevron that warned fourth-quarter 2009 downstream
earnings would be “sharply lower, mainly due to significantly
weaker refining margins.”
Chevron’s global refining capacity totals 2 million b/d.
According to the 2008 annual report, the company has 937,000
b/d of capacity in wholly owned refineries in the US, including
265,000 b/d at El Segundo, Calif.; 54,000 b/d at Kapolei, Ha.;
330,000 b/d at Pascagoula, Miss.; 243,000 b/d at Richmond, Calif.; and 45,000 b/d at Salt Lake City, Utah. It also has an 80,000b/d asphalt plant at Perth Amboy, NJ.
Outside the US, Chevron owns refineries at Burnaby, BC,
55,000 b/d; Cape Town, South Africa, 110,000 b/d; and Pembroke, UK, 210,000 b/d.
It also owns shares in refineries outside the US through inter10

national affiliates with net capacities totaling 747,000 b/d. The
international capacities include 350,000 b/d through Chevron’s
50% share of the Yeosu refinery in South Korea and 145,000 b/d
through its 50% share of the Pualau Merlimau refinery in Singapore.

Aramco gets nod to build Jazan refinery
Saudi Aramco was tapped to build and finance the $10 billion Jazan refinery. Its capacity will be 250,000-400,000 b/d, said
Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Ali Al-Naimi.
Bidding by 8 Saudi firms and 42 international companies that
concluded last year.
King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud approved the project in
2006 as part of a wider development plan for the southern province, but bidding had been delayed as the country tried to generate foreign company interest in the project.
A project fully built and owned by private companies had been
a goal, but potential investors expressed concerns the distance of
the planned refinery from its supply fields would undermine the
plant’s economics.

Shell Canada to shut Montreal refinery
Shell Canada Products plans to halt operation of its 130,000 b/d
Montreal East refinery and to convert the facility into a terminal
for gasoline, diesel, and aviation fuel.
In a press statement Shell said the refinery “no longer fits with
Shell’s long-term strategy.”
Shell opened the refinery in March 1933 as a 5,000-b/d topping plant.
According to Oil & Gas Journal’s latest Worldwide Refining
report, the Montreal East refinery’s processing capacities include
14,610 b/cd of visbreaking, 27,900 b/d of fluid catalytic cracking,
20,910 b/d of semiregenerative catalytic reforming, 14,100 b/d of

5% while oil demand declined 1.5%, IEA says. Westbound shipments from the Persian Gulf fell because of the recession while
eastbound shipments from there and West Africa rose because of
Asian refinery expansions.
IEA cites reports that tanker demand, adjusted for increased
floating storage, fell by 2-3% last year. The global oil tanker fleet,
meanwhile, grew 7% from delivery of new tankers representing a
total of 30-35 million dwt.
Fleet additions will remain at 5%/year during the next 3 years,
IEA says. Orders in place and due for delivery through 2012 represent about 125 million dwt.
“The ability of the industry to negotiate more cancellations of
newbuilds will be critical to shipping sector fortunes, although
few were obtained during 2009,” IEA says.
Scrapping increased to an estimated 6.8 million dwt in 2009

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

from 2.8 million dwt in 2008, with most of the increase coming
in August and later.

Kinder Morgan Partners expands in ethanol
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP is expanding its role in the
transportation of renewable fuels.
The company reported the acquisition from US Development
Group (USD) of three unit train ethanol handling facilities in Linden, NJ; Baltimore, Md.; and Dallas and the formation of a joint
venture with USD to coordinate access to the facilities.
The acquisition value is about $195 million, including $80 million in Kinder Morgan Partners equity issued to USD.
The terminals, along with similar facilities already owned by
Kinder Morgan Partners, “will create a nationwide distribution
network of ethanol handling facilities connected by rail, marine,
truck, and pipeline,” the company said.
Kinder Morgan Partners said it expects to handle more than
218,000 b/d of ethanol in 2010. The new transaction brings its
total investment in the renewable fuels handling business to about
$500 million. ✦

Spending and jobs
As a marketing writer and technical editor for a major engineering firm,
which includes oil and gas, I was struck
by your comment that, according to
“liberal theory,” “…history suggests
otherwise” that states create jobs by
spending money (OGJ, Sept. 14, 2009, p.
88). Whatever history you are thinking about, it is a history mostly in your
imagination and has no bearing on
the real history about which historians
write, students study, and the rest of
us can, indeed do, know by reviewing
even the most cursory evidence. States
have always been catalysts for economic
growth. This is demonstrated over and
over, from ancient times to the present.
The industrial revolution began
because states financed or guaranteed
financing (as in pre-Civil War New England, for example) ships to bring raw
cotton to mills that created finished textiles while states, especially the United
States, paid for the forcible removal of
domestic populations and paid for the
means to establish the plantation system,
including slavery.
State expenditures for military purposes have always been a catalyst for
overseas commercial expansion and the
source of new technologies, whether
it was the shipping industry in Britain,
the world’s foremost naval power in
the 18th and 19th centuries, or the host
of industries—avionics, aeronautics,
electronics, metallurgy—created by state
expenditures for research and development, typically for military applications,
here in the US after World War II.
The oil and gas industry benefited
immeasurably by state expenditures for
exploration technologies throughout the
post-WWII period. In fact, the business
literature immediately after WWII is replete with approval of state expenditures
into the economy. Why? Because there
was much fear by many in government
and the private sector that with the end
of wartime production, the US would
simply go back to Depression-era conditions. State expenditure, largely through
the military but elsewhere, was seen by
the private sector, including the oil and
gas industry, as the appropriate antidote.
And it wasn’t just direct expenditure

into the economy. The GI Bill, passed
after WWII, had the state paying for
the education of millions: architects,
chemists, engineers, mathematicians,
physicists, construction specialists, and
others. Yet somehow this had no role in
contributing to the economy we have
today?
Then there is digital technology for
which the public paid 100%—I repeat,
100%—of the research and development from the 1940s through the 1960s,
which was then handed over to the
private sector, the Bill Gates mythology
notwithstanding. And have you never
heard that the internet started as the
completely state-funded “milnet” in the
1960s for the Pentagon?
Of course, there is the oil and gas
industry, which has benefited tremendously by public-sector subsidies in exploration technologies, sweetheart deals,
preferential bidding, tax benefits, and—
yes—military intervention. The entire
post-WWII US military presence in the
Middle East was understood, as stated
in our postwar policy documents (now
declassified), as “the big prize” in the
US gaining access to and then controlling oil production. Our presence in the
Middle East has served as an enormous
subsidy to the US oil and gas industry in
keeping domestic prices relatively low
compared to European and Asian economies, especially our biggest competitor
there, Japan, and now China. In fact,
the whole system was set up precisely to
keep competitors out, and the captains
of the oil and gas industry have always
been happy to oblige and dutifully filled
the campaign coffers of politicians who
pursued such policies. No doubt you
want the tax benefits, the subsidies, and
the military interventions to defend
“our interests.” No doubt what you also
want is to not pay for it.
Are you unaware of this? Or do you
simply consider massive public expenditures to the private sector, directly and
indirectly, throughout our history and
the history of every wealthy country
worldwide, advancing the interests of
the private sector—oil and gas, too—as
shining examples of “conservative”
theory?

In the intervening years since the

investors.

Massachusetts and oil
The US oil and gas industry has reason to treat
with care the Republican takeover of a US Senate
seat held for decades by the late Ted Kennedy representing steadfastly Democratic Massachusetts. It can
assume no easing of antagonism from Democrats
leading Congress and occupying the White House.
And resurgent Republicans do not uniformly or automatically support oil, gas, or the companies that
produce, process, and transport them.
State Sen. Scott Brown’s special-election defeat
of Massachusetts Atty. Gen. Martha Coakley, a
Democrat, shook Washington, DC, of course.
The vote clearly repudiated health care legislation
shoved to the center of the political agenda by
President Barack Obama and the liberal congressional leadership. It also probably showed revulsion for the political favors with which Democratic leaders finagled support for the measure.
Less clearly but more broadly, the vote expressed
concern about a government trying to intrude in
unprecedented ways into individual lives and the
national economy.

shoulder a heavy, disproportionate load under any
cap-and-trade law resembling the bill passed by the
House. But it should relieve all of the industry. The
cap-and-trade approach to mitigation of climate
change is deceptive, intrusive, and corruptible. Its
implementation would distort energy markets—
never good for economic energy forms—and channel undue blame to the oil and gas industry when
costs and systemic flaws became clear.
Perils remain, however. No one should confuse
this sudden shortening of the governmental leash
with public adoration of the oil and gas industry.

larly for the refining industry, are more
than problematic. They’re economic
suicide. Meanwhile, other nations like
China and Russia met in Copenhagen
[at the United Nations climate-change
conference in December] without us.
That’s a telling fact.”
He and other oil and gas association officials noted that Kerry and two
other senators, Joseph I. Lieberman (IConn.) and Lindsay O. Graham (R-SC),
proposed a climate-change compromise
framework on Dec. 10. “There are
parts of it which speak to onshore and
offshore oil and gas, but we really don’t
know the details,” said Fuller.
“It was interesting in their framework that, for the very first time,
members of the Senate were saying for
the first time that this country needs a
healthy and vibrant refining industry.
That was monumental to us,” Drevna
told OGJ. “I sent them a letter thanking
them for noticing us, but warned them
that if they were going to try to pursue
targets, it wasn’t going to help much.”
The domestic climate-change regulatory situation was complicated further
when the US Environmental Protection Agency, in response to a 2007 US
Supreme Court decision that GHGs fit
the federal Clean Air Act’s definition
of pollutants, issued an endangerment
finding on Dec. 7 that set the stage
for it to move ahead on attempting to
regulate GHG emissions under the law.
“EPA may be trying to force Congress
to move legislatively to avoid a bigger
problem since the [CAA] was designed
for local applications,” Fuller said.
Drevna suggested, “Let’s get back to
what the situation looks like today and
understand what happened in Copen22

hagen, then reassess everything. Whatever they have on their chalkboards
should be erased so everyone can start
with blank slates and participate in an
interindustry fashion and determine
what’s possible and what makes sense
instead of picking winners and losers. Heretofore, we haven’t seen much
which makes sense for the refining
industry and the US economy.”

Mixed signals
Many producers, meanwhile,
entered 2010 trying to reconcile what
they perceived as mixed signals from
the Obama administration in 2009.
Russell noted that US Department of
the Interior officials “say the right
things, but when you look at what they
actually do, it’s frustrating. They move
more slowly on oil and gas but quickly
on renewables, which they seem more
interested in.”
“We’re seeing more [DOI] actions
taken through the prism of climate
change,” added Daniel T. Naatz, IPAA’s
vice-president of federal resources and
political affairs. He said that Rocky
Mountain upstream independents were
troubled when US Interior Secretary
Ken Salazar directed BLM on Feb. 4 not
to accept $6 million in successful bids
on 77 tracts offered in BLM’s Dec. 18,
2008, oil and gas lease sale in Utah.
Disputing Salazar’s assessment that
offering the tracts was an 11th hour
maneuver by the Bush administration,
Naatz told OGJ that the secretary’s action raised questions about proximity
to national parks and proposed wilderness areas. “Producers didn’t get
everything they wanted at that sale.
The people in BLM are professionals,”

he said. “There are inherent costs to
operating on federal lands in the West
already. Independent producers with
small operations don’t have a large
number of plays. “BLM’s multiple
use ethos has assumed that different
activities coexist. When land turns to a
single use, oil and gas revenues can be
lost.” The onshore situation of rising
costs and permitting delays extends to
federal offshore areas, he indicated.
NOIA’s Fry said, “We are rid of the
moratoriums and withdrawals, where
85% [of the US Outer Continental Shelf]
was off-limits. Yet there’s only 15%
available under the current 5-year plan.
It will take a new 5-year plan, with administration support to move forward.”
The arrival of S. Elizabeth Birnbaum as
MMS’s new director on July 15 probably
has helped, he continued, but NOIA and
its members plan to make certain DOI
officials have all the information and
are aware of proposed policies’ possible
unintended consequences.
Shorter offshore leasing periods,
which Salazar announced on Nov. 13,
are one example, Fry said. “The change
itself is not that great if the government
considers matters which are beyond
lessees’ control, such as rigs not being
available or other government agencies
not completing their reports,” he said,
adding, “MMS needs to have flexibility
to grant extensions in cases where operators have been diligent but haven’t,
through any fault of their own, met
development deadlines.”

‘Under the gun’
Fry said he hopes Salazar does not
delay completion of a new 5-year
OCS plan much longer, and warned
that MMS is “under the gun” to keep
a planned 2011 lease sale off Virginia
on schedule in the current plan as the
state’s Gov.-elect, Robert F. McDonnell,
requested in a Dec. 23 letter to Salazar.
Fry said that officials in North Carolina,
South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida
have indicated that they’re interested in
seeing their states possibly be included
in the next 5-year OCS plan.
But Fry doesn’t expect much progOil & Gas Journal / Jan. 25, 2010

ress unless these coastal states receive
federal revenue shares similar to those
of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and
Texas, which would require congressional action. “These states recognize
that just having offshore resource
development, whether from alternatives
or from oil and gas, would create jobs
and improve their economies,” he said,
citing one estimate that Virginia could
get $165 million/year with a revenue
share similar to that of some Gulf Coast
states.
Other association officials
said it also became apparent
during 2009 that Congress
and the Obama administration planned to regulate more
aggressively. Interstate gas
pipelines received a dramatic
signal on Nov. 19 when the
US Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission launched new investigations into four pipelines’
rates under Section 5 of the
Natural Gas Act not in response
to customer complaints, but following
analysis of data which the pipelines
submitted earlier in the year. “We’re
asking whether this is limited or a
precursor of things to come. It certainly
raised some eyebrows in the financial
community,” Santa said.
Santa told OGJ that the last decadeand-a-half’s lighter regulatory approach
at FERC spurred investments for pipelines to increase capacity. “Owners of
existing facilities also felt that with certainty they would not be dragged into
regular rate cases, they could pursue
efficiencies and innovations,” he said,
adding that most pipeline rate of return
cases in the last 15 years were settled
before they reached an administrative
law judge.
Independent producers and other
end users had to fight hard to make
certain they could continue to use

he said, adding, “We haven’t sought to

NPRA’s Drevna said refiners face
threats not only from problems posed
by fuel composition mandates but also
from efforts to impose new plant security regulations as an indirect means of
creating new environmental requirements.
“It’s just emblematic of the proponents trying to debilitate the refining and petrochemical business in
this country,” Drevna said, adding,
“We were at the forefront of chemical and refining plant security even
before 9-11. That simply increased our
diligence on these matters. To suggest a total reconfiguration of security
procedures by having bureaucrats tell

will simply just move more plants and

As for cellulosic ethanol’s potential,
Drevna continued, it “reminds me of

“The corn ethanol folks say that we

He said independent producers

strategic transitions from gas toward oil
the past few years. “Its significant presence in the Bakken shale has given its

Urness said, “There’s a lot less exploration and more development going

API: US oil demand
showed signs of
recovery late in 2009
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
US oil demand fell during 2009 but
began to recover as the year concluded,
the American Petroleum Institute said.
Gasoline, kerosene, and all other oils
were strongest, but distillate fuel oil
lagged, especially for on-highway uses,
API’s yearend 2009 and December statistics showed.
“Clearly, petroleum demand is mirroring the economic recovery,” said
John C. Felmy, API chief economist,
on Jan. 15. “We are seeing December
demand figures stronger than fourthquarter figures and fourth-quarter figures stronger than full-year figures. But
the data also indicate that the recovery
still has a distance to go, particularly if
you look at ultralow-sulfur diesel fuel.”
API’s domestic supply and demand
figures for 2009 were similar to the US
Energy Information Administration’s
global assessment 3 days earlier in its
latest short-term energy outlook (OGJ
Online, Jan. 13, 2009). It also showed a
full-year drop in demand with a recovery gathering momentum as the year
wound down.
Total US petroleum product deliveries, which API uses to measure
demand, dropped 4% during 2009 to
an average 18.7 million b/d from 19.5
million b/d in 2008. Deliveries during
December rose 0.6% to an average 19.3
million b/d from December 2008’s average 19.1 million b/d, the report said.
“We’re seeing a firmer economy,”
Felmy told reporters during a teleconference. “Individual consumers feel a
little more confident, which can lead to
improvements in retail sales. That can
affect gasoline demand from improved
employment. Economic growth can

He said McCarthy confirmed in her
response that violations of the new

IPAA asks Salazar to reconsider onshore leasing regs
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The Independent Petroleum Association of America urged US Interior
Secretary Ken Salazar to reconsider
implementing what the trade association
believes are new duplicative and unnecessary onshore leasing regulations.
“These new regulations are not consistent with an American energy policy
that provides more jobs and revenues to
our nation’s economy and strengthens
our national security,” IPAA Pres. Barry
Russell said in a Jan. 13 letter to Salazar.
“Not only are these new regulations
duplicative and unnecessary, they will
further restrict access to vital oil and
natural gas resources our nation needs.”
Salazar and US Bureau of Land
Management Director Robert V. Abbey
announced on Jan. 6 that BLM will
consider site-specific conditions for
individual onshore lease sales during comprehensive interdisciplinary
reviews. The agency also will develop
master leasing and development plans
28

for areas where intensive new oil and
gas production is expected and adopt
new guidelines for using categorical
exclusions, they said.
Russell said the current federal onshore leasing program already provides
a thorough examination of any proposed activity’s potential environmental
impacts on a specific area. “The process
currently includes an examination of
the proposed action as part of an overall
land use plan, a thorough review and
project specific analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA),
consultation with the states, and the
requisite permits to drill that include
compliance with wildlife, air, water, and
land quality regulations,” he told Salazar.
Oil and gas producers operating on
federal lands also must comply with the
federal Endangered Species Act (ESA),
Russell added. “No industry faces more
scrutiny under the ESA than oil and
gas operators on federal lands and any
‘enhancement’ of that process will only
cause further delay, litigation challenges, and ultimately less resources being

produced on federal lands,” he said.
Russell said while independent
producers recognize that operating on
federal lands requires a partnership with
federal land management agencies, they
do not think it’s necessary to expand the
existing process. Russell said producers are particularly concerned with the
master leasing and development process
which Salazar mentioned because it
would add “significant, new, and redundant” programs to the process without
any requisite improvement.
Finally, IPAA and its members are
concerned about changes that Salazar
proposed in the use of categorical exclusions, which the 2005 Energy Policy
Act authorized as a time and moneysaving alternative to a full review under
the National Environmental Policy Act
where they were deemed appropriate, Russell said. “Efforts to revise or
allow [their] use under ‘extraordinary
circumstances’ will significantly limit
the ability of independent producers to
utilize these important tools,” he told
Salazar. ✦

Marcellus shale fight
continues in New York
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Chesapeake Energy Corp. has warned that new
rules proposed by New York regulators over shale gas
drilling already are unnecessarily onerous and may
deprive New York of badly needed revenue by scaring
off energy firms.
"The measures proposed…will be more burdensome than any of those placed on our industry
throughout the United States and will more than
adequately ensure that the development of the Marcellus shale natural gas formation in New York will
occur with sufficient environmental safeguards,"
Chesapeake said.
Objections concerning the methods used to extract
the gas arose after the New York State Department
of Environmental Conservation (DEC) extended the
public comment period on the draft supplemental generic environmental impact statement (DSGEIS) governing natural gas drilling activities in the Marcellus
shale formation to Dec. 31, 2009, from Nov. 30, 2009.
The DEC invited comments on the DSGEIS, which it
said “addresses the range of potential impacts of shale
gas development using horizontal drilling and highvolume hydraulic fracturing and outlines safety measures, protection standards and mitigation strategies
that operators would have to follow to obtain permits.”
The US Environmental Protection Agency responded by submitting documents of its own to the DEC
during the public comment period which closed on
Dec. 31, 2009.
EPA said it has "serious reservations" about allowing shale gas drilling in New York City's watershed,
and warned of a threat to the drinking water for 9
million people.
"We have concerns regarding potential impacts to
human health and the environment that we believe
warrant further scientific and regulatory analysis,"
according to John Filippelli, head of EPA’s strategic
planning and programs branch.
"EPA has serious reservations about whether gas
drilling in the New York City watershed is consistent
with the vision of high-quality unfiltered water supply," Filippelli said in the report.
EPA’s report coincided with statement by Tompkins
County, which lies to the west of New York City, saying
that its representative joined with federal, state, and local

China, Japan
sparring again

D

isputed natural gas reserves
beneath the East China Sea are
once again making headlines, as
China and Japan spar over which of
the two countries has the rights to
the underwater reserves.
That became clear last week when
Japanese Foreign Minister Katsuya
Okada warned his Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi that Tokyo will take
“certain” action if Beijing violates a
bilateral accord to jointly explore for
gas in the East China Sea.
In particular, Okada told Yang that
Tokyo will take countermeasures if
Beijing begins gas production in the
Chunxiao gas field, arguing that his
country would consider such action
a violation of a 2008 agreement to
jointly explore the area.
It’s worth observing that the talks
between the two men also touched
on North Korea’s nuclear issues, with
Okada asking China to work toward
bringing Pyongyang back to the sixparty denuclearization talks “unconditionally.”

The Japanese have justifiable
concerns, too, for it was just 10 years
ago that North Korea launched a ballistic missile that sparked heated debate in Japan over regional security.
The temperature of that debate rose
when two “mystery ships” violated
Japanese territorial waters before
escaping into North Korea.

Nuclear threat

As a refresher, the Aug. 31, 1999,
launch of the Taepo Dong I was
North Korea’s first of a missile with
a range of more than 1,500 km
and brought any part of Japan well
within North Korea’s sights.
The three-stage missile was
launched from North Korea’s eastern
seaboard. The first stage dropped
off into the Sea of Japan, while the
second stage flew over Japan into the
Pacific.
For the record, the third stage—
which US intelligence sources had
failed to detect until reviewing data
several weeks later—traveled 5,500

legislators to express “concern about the
state's proposed regulatory document issued by the DEC.”
Communicating the County's concerns about gas drilling at the protest
in New York City, Tompkins County
Legislator Martha Robertson said that
many questions about drilling “remain
to be answered.”
Earlier, the Tompkins County Legislature “urged that the entire process be
reevaluated and that no drilling be permitted using the hydraulic fracturing
technique until an adequate environmental review is completed.”
The debate emerged after New York
Gov. David Paterson, who is seeking
to reduce a $3.2 billion state budget
deficit, last year proposed opening the
Marcellus shale to drilling using horizontal hydraulic fracturing.
In December, the Independent Oil
& Gas Association of New York urged
Paterson in a letter to remain committed to his draft State Energy Plan, which
supports the expansion of natural gas
exploration in the Marcellus shale.
"We believe that New York cannot
afford to turn away or postpone the
tremendous opportunity for economic
resurgence and a clean energy supply
presented by the Marcellus shale," said
IOGA, along with a coalition of business and economic development groups
(OGJ Online, Dec. 29, 2009).
IOGA’s letter followed DEC’s extension of the commentary period as well
as reports that New York City urged the
state to ban natural gas drilling in its
watershed, becoming the most powerful opponent to date of a process that
critics say is poisoning drinking water.
Chesapeake has reportedly accused
critics of creating fear and panic with
misleading or incorrect information
with concerns "that have no basis in science or reality."
Earlier this month, Chesapeake
Energy Corp. announced a $2.25 billion
joint venture agreement with Total E&P
USA Inc. in which Total will acquire a
25% interest in Chesapeake’s upstream
Barnett shale assets (OGJ Online, Jan. 4,
2010). ✦

An apparent Eocene-Paleocene
discovery just off the central Louisiana
coast could eventually produce 2 tcf of
gas or more from Wilcox, appears to
have shallower Eocene pay, and is being
deepened to test more of the Paleocene
section, said McMoRan Exploration Co.,
New Orleans.
McMoRan cautioned that flow tests
and confirmation drilling are needed
to identify the content of liquids, if
any, in the hydrocarbons and the areal
extent of the Wilcox sands, but it hailed
the Davy Jones well as an important
data point in overall Gulf Coast/Gulf of
Mexico exploration.
The Davy Jones well, in 20 ft of water 10 miles south of Marsh Island, La.,
is about 85 miles south of the nearest
deep Wilcox production to the north
in the 30-year-old Cretaceous Tuscaloosa Trend just north of Baton Rouge
and 170 miles north of Lower Tertiary
discoveries such as Shenandoah in the
Walker Ridge area of the deepwater
Gulf of Mexico.
The apparent pay in Wilcox below
the salt weld is a “great signal” that operators might also encounter Tuscaloosa
sands if they drilled even deeper on the
shelf, said James R. Moffett, cochairman. In the deepwater gulf discoveries,
sands are thicker in the Lower Wilcox
than in the Upper Wilcox, Moffett
noted.
McMoRan, leader of a group of five
entities with interests in four federal
blocks that the shallow-water discovery appears on seismic data to cover,
said the Davy Jones well could revive
exploration on a broad area of the Gulf
of Mexico shelf. It could be one of the
largest shelf discoveries in decades
(OGJ Online, Jan. 11, 2010).

Davy Jones progress
The McMoRan group had drilled the
Davy Jones exploratory well to 28,262
ft by Jan. 11 and run logs to 28,134 ft.

The quality of the Wilcox sands “assures us…that we’re just a mirror image

means an attempt at quantitative analysis of thermodynamics as they apply to
the formation of black powder could be
misleading.
Although thermodynamics can
be useful in predicting what can and
cannot possibly form under dewing
conditions, the fact that a wide range
of products (iron oxides, carbonates, and elemental sulfur) is sampled
from the pipelines shows this is not a
homogeneous process controlled by
thermodynamics. If the gas phase is
relatively constant, thermodynamics
would predict one stable phase for each
of the nonmetallic components in the
gas phase (i.e., S and C).
The presence of all the mentioned
phases means there are regions of
kinetic control in the pipeline. These
uncertainties, however, mean the results should be used as a guide to better
understand the corrosion mechanisms
inside the pipeline.

air ingression in the gas, will not be at
equilibrium with the other gases in the
methane stream, due to the low kinetics of methane reacting with oxygen at
operating temperatures.
Oxygen cannot exist (thermodynamically) in a reducing environment
such as sales gas (Equation 1) because
38

it would react with methane. If oxygen
were at equilibrium with the methane,
the partial pressure of O2 would be
undetectable and CO2 and water concentrations would increase. H2S would
remain relatively unaffected.

Conditions indicated by the equilibrium gas composition (i.e., the Eh
and pH of the water or the equilibrium
CO2 in the gas phase) will therefore not
reflect the true kinetically controlled
situation, requiring any calculations
or diagrams based on the gas phase
equilibrium be interpreted in light of
expected kinetics (i.e., oxygen could
remain in the system as a kinetically
stable gas phase).
Specific reactions in black powder
production problematic with regards
to the application of thermodynamics follow. Kinetic barriers complicate
accurate prediction of the equilibrium
aqueous phase. But suppressing reactions in the calculations not occurring
in the pipeline allows a reasonable
estimate of the aqueous phase, increasing the usefulness of analyzing iron
reaction products by EpH diagrams and
aqueous-phase chemistry.

Dewpoint
Dewpoint calculations for a range of
conditions demonstrated the validity
of the calculations (Fig. 1). The operating temperature and pressure ranges
measured 15-30º C. and 720-900 psig,
respectively. Dewpoint calculations
considered the balance of the sales gas
as N2 and CH4 (CH4/N2 = 15.67), or Ar
for purposes of the calculations.
Pressure has the largest effect on
dewpoint. Calculations determined if
dewpoint temperature changes as a
function of contaminant concentrations
and pipeline pressure. Fig. 1 compares
the results obtained from a commercially available software package and
the dewpoint calculated using the alpha
moisture system dewpoint calculator.
In all cases the results are within about
2º C. of each other. Impurities (H2S and
CO2) had no effect on the dewpoint,
while pipeline pressure and H2O affected dewpoint temperature.
Point calculations are thermodynamic calculations done to attempt to
simulate the conditions in the precipitated water in the pipeline. They most
effectively identify reasonable ranges
of pH or redox for EpH diagrams or to

help better understand reaction mechanisms. All calculations are based on 1
l. of gas and are in units of moles. The
output from the thermodynamic model
gives the equilibrium gas phase and the
aqueous condensed phase.
Changing the values of CO2, H2S,
and O2, allows a range of values for pH,
Eh, and aqueous species concentrations.
The concentration of aqueous species is
important in setting the EpH diagrams
to the correct values. Oxygen can be
used in these calculations because Ar
has replaced methane and nitrogen.
This condition represents a transient
condition where O2 has entered the
pipeline, but does not react with methane due to kinetic constraints.
Changing gas conditions affect the
solution’s Eh and pH, low and high CO2
content. Maximum water concentration
equaled 0.55 mg/l. CO2 will buffer the
aqueous solution to a pH of about 4,
typical of carbonate solutions. Adding
H2S in a reducing environment has little
effect on pH. Oxygen naturally drives
up the Eh value, creating the potential
for localized increases of Eh along the
pipeline due to oxygen ingress.
The fact there are no pH conditions that would be above about 5 is
consistent with work by Sridhar et al.5
using a range of conditions with CO2
at 10 psi and all conditions (except the
one loaded with NaOH) showing a pH
around 5. These results reinforce the
difficulties of studying the problem in
isolation from its surroundings, these
relatively highly acidic pH conditions
not being encountered in the pipeline.
The presence of iron in the system dramatically affects its chemistry.
System pH normally lies between 5 and
6.5, due to the reaction of CO2 with
iron. When iron is introduced into the
calculation, FeCO3 precipitates, the pH
increases to 5, and FeOH+ is found in
the aqueous solution, much more in
line with the actual field findings.
Formation of Fe3O4 is thermodynamically possible but depends on the
availability of iron to the system (ratio
of iron to gas phase), helping explain
the range of compounds found in the

Looking at the calculated reaction
products as iron is introduced into the
system allows study of the progression
of product formation. In the presence
of Fe (given an oxygen free system),
FeS2 is the first iron compound to form

(at pH ~4). FeCO3 forms next if the
available sulfur is exhausted, increasing the pH to above 5. Relative rates of
these reactions are not known and are
affected by the relative concentrations
of the gases.

produces a corrosion product that is a
function of the partial pressure of both
acid gases and temperature.6 Investigation suggests different CO2-H2S ratios,
such as 200 and 500, representing the
change from predominately FeCO3 to
FeS6.
The preference for CO2 forming
carbonate over H2S forming FeS (both
reactants in aqueous form) is a kinetic
phenomenon, and not based on thermodynamics. Thermodynamically,
iron will preferentially react with S
over CO2 at virtually any concentration of reactants. The fact that FeCO3
is found preferentially at high levels of
CO2-H2S shows the kinetic reaction for
S is less than for CO2, perhaps due to a
passivating film occurring with sulfur
or, as mentioned earlier, to exhaustion of S at the reaction site due to the
slow dissolution of more H2S into the
water (slow replenishment of S in the
water).
As with CO2, calculations involving S
as described are kinetically controlled.
The prediction of the formation of
SO42– from thermodynamics does not
occur in the field. Reactions of oxygen
and H2S appear to be kinetically slow,

40

and the preferential reaction is as per
Equation 2.

EPH diagrams
EpH diagrams can identify regions
of pH and E (redox potential, or the
oxidizing or reducing environment
of the solution). Presentation of these
diagrams often occurs in a series with
varying conditions of activity of one
of the species, because while EpH diagrams can be constructed for metals
in water, when a nonmetallic element
is introduced (in this case carbon or
sulfur), another degree of uncertainty
is added to the system. This uncertainty must be removed by setting the
activity level or partial pressure of a
compound containing that nonmetallic element.
Providing a series of diagrams
with no reference to the actual system
provides little value in understanding
the mechanism of a reaction, making
the point calculations performed in
this work useful in helping determine
reasonable concentrations of aqueous
species for carbon and sulfur. Fig. 2 is
the baseline EpH diagram for water.
FeOOH, the data entered into the
commercial software package,8 did not

appear. Conditions for its formation are
not clear, but it can be assumed it forms
in the presence of oxygen via Equation
3, or through conversion of reaction
products via Equations 4 and 5.
This diagram is at 15º C., although
temperature’s effect is negligible over
the range experienced by the pipelines.
The region of interest lies between the
two dashed lines, showing the region
where water is stable. With only pure
water and a basic pH Fe3O4 can form, as
shown by this region in Fig. 2.
The progression moves from
elemental Fe, to FeO (or Fe(OH)2 as
shown), to Fe3O4, and finally to Fe2O3–,
the most oxidized iron oxide. Removing the aqueous species from the
diagram would show each phase field
layered on top of each other as the
electron volt increases (becomes more
oxidizing).

CO2 influence
Adding CO2 changes the EpH
diagram to that shown in Fig. 3 for a
system with low CO2 in the gas phase
(0.1 mol %). Adding C to the system requires there be a species selected with a
fixed concentration. This can either be
a gas (i.e., CO2) or an aqueous species
(i.e., HCO3–).
This article selected HCO3– and took
a representative value from the point
calculations done in the last section.
The carbonate phase, FeCO3, is covered
by the aqueous FeOH+ and Fe2+ fields.
This coverage only shows the ionic
concentration in the system since the
diagram is set to the typical 10–6 concentration for the sum of ionic species
(if the total of all ionic species is at least
10–6, the predominant ionic species
will be shown on the plot).
To see the solid phases, the ionic
species can be suppressed in the output
(Fig. 4). This plot, without aqueous species shown, clearly demonstrates FeCO3
as the phase of interest in the E and pH
range, supporting the point calculations
showing FeOH+ is present with CO2
and influences system pH.
EpH diagrams often display with the

aqueous phase boundaries as dotted
lines over the top of the solid phases.
The concentration of aqueous species
over a phase field shows the development rate of any corrosion, since corrosion will occur with greater intensity
if the dissolved Fe ions build to a high
concentration before equilibrium is
reached.
Setting the concentration of aqueous species at 0.001 allows observation of the solid phase fields with the
aqueous species. Fe3O4 forms at pH
values greater than about 6.5, but the
phase field overlaps the FeCO3 for a
given pH, depending on the Eh of the
system.
This overlap could explain why both
FeCO3 and Fe3O4 are found in the black
powder, since a pH of 6.5 or greater is
found in laboratory tests at Saudi Aramco, and Eh could change depending
on oxygen availability.

H2S influence
The effect of H2S on the pipeline
depends on the atmosphere in the pipeline and kinetics. Oxygen does not react
kinetically with H2S to create sulfates,
meaning EpH diagrams can vary widely
as to fields of stability depending on
the situation in the system. Fig. 5 shows
a simple EpH diagram using pH2S as the
basis for the calculation yields.
Fe3O4 lies between FeS and FeS2.
The Fe3O4 field is narrow (only visible as a thicker line), but at lower H2S
concentrations it is more predominant,
demonstrating a likelihood of FeS and
FeS2 formation depending on redox
potential.
Since oxygen ingress will affect
redox potential and is a nonuniform
event (sometimes minor, sometimes
major), it is likely both FeS and FeS2
will be found in a range of concentrations with one another.
Examination of both CO2 and H2S
demonstrates why a variety of solid
material is found in black powder.

42

Oxygen ingress can widely change
system Eh and favor formation of one
compound over another. The nature of
the ingress—in terms of both concentration and location—leads to nonuniform residue, complicating the overall
analysis of its formation.

A statistic analysis found that drillstring failures in Tarim oil field were
related to the difference between specifications and working conditions.
The analysis documented the drillstring failures from January 2005 to
March 2006.
During this time, Tarim oil field
had 36 failures in 2005 and 21 from
January to March 2006. These failures
caused extensive lost time for fishing the broken strings and the loss of
several holes.

In Well Milan 1 (photo on the left), the fracture failure in a 120.7 mm (43⁄4 in.) drill collar is in the pin’s last engaged thread (Fig. 3). During JanuaryMarch 2006, six 158.8 mm (61⁄4 in.) drill collars broke at the box (photo on the right). The fractures were 102-110 mm from the box seal shoulder, as seen
in this failure from Well Gucheng 4 (Fig. 4).

Failure causes
Bend, torsion, and impact fatigue
loads during drilling cause fatigue
cracks to grow easily. Fatigue fractures
will occur once cracks extend to a
certain size.
The wells in Tarim oil field are deep,
and the field has complex geology.
These factors contribute to difficult
drilling conditions. During drilling,
frequent bit bouncing and jumping will
cause fatigue failures.
Doglegs in wells caused the drillstring to bear extra bending load that
causes drill pipe to crack or fracture.4 5
Three drill pipe joints leaked because
of fatigue cracks at a 500 m depth
where the dogleg was 3.7°/30 m in
Well LG42. Another 15 joints of drill
pipe leaked because of fatigue cracks
at 1,870-930 m where the dogleg was
6.5°/30 m in Well LG13 (Fig. 5).
Another reason for some of the failures was large-size polycrystalline-diamond compact (PDC) bits that increase
torsion load on the drillstring.
The drilling program used shock
absorbers in 54 wells in 2005. Four
of the drillstrings with 406.4 mm (16
44

in.) PDC bits had fracture failures. Bit
bouncing and jumping added extra
loads on the drillstring resulting in
severe service conditions.6
Three examples of these failures are:
1. In Well Q 601, the rotary table
suddenly reversed because of bit
bouncing and jumping, thereby breaking two pins in the corner of the rotary
table.
2. In Well YL 101, five drillstring
elements broke because of bit bouncing and jumping while drilling with
a 444.5 mm (171⁄2 in.) PDC bit, resulting in four drillstring elements having
cracks.
3. One joint of 139.7 mm (5.5 in.)
S135 drill pipe broke in Well Q 601
well because of the large size PDC bit
bouncing and jumping.
Fast rotation speed can increase the
force away from the axes of the drillstring and result in extra bend stress
borne by the drillstring. This can cause
strong torsion and shock loads that
damage drillstrings. High-inertia torque
and kinetic energy can cause abnormal
torque borne by the drillstring in the
case of a bit bouncing and jumping.

Fast rotation speed also can increase
the total stress borne by the drillstring,
resulting in the initiation and spreading
of cracks.
Statistical data show that failures
increase with rotational speed. For example, in wells LG 802, HD 1-28, and
LN 621 rotary table speeds were 110,
100-120, and 120 rpm, respectively.
In well LG 802, 24 drill pipe joints
washed out in 15 days, and 2 joints
broke off after being washed out. The
well had four drill pipe breaks in 2
days.
In Well HD 1-28, six joints washed
out in 7 days with two joints washing out in 1 day. In Well LN 621, eight
joints broke off in 4 days with three
joints washing out in 1 day.
Washouts stopped with the introduction of composite thread drillstring
elements and the decrease of the rotary
table to 50-60 rpm. In these wells, the
pump pressure was more than 2 MPa
(290 psi) greater than when the washouts occurred.

quality was in accordance with API
Specification 7, and SY 5144.
Although the quality of imported
drill collars is better than for the collars
made in China, many imported drill
collar failures took place. The analysis
concluded that decreasing these failures
required a study of the techniques used
for drilling the wells.
Test results showed that the material toughness and yield strength of the
drilling stabilizer run at Tarim were not
in accordance with standards. To ensure drilling stabilizer quality, required
additional supervision and research.
Also the material toughness was
lower than the standards for 14 of the
drilling jar and shock absorber failures
that occurred in 2005.
The drilling jars that broke from
January to March 2006 included one jar
that fractured with standard torque being applied during make up in a workshop. This indicates that the failure was
due to the coarseness of the material in
the jar.

Analysis results
used are from API, ISO, SY, and GB.
User and manufacturer committees
have established API and ISO standards.
SY and GB are steel grade standards
based on API and ISO standards with
some improvements.
Because of difficult drilling condi-

tions in Tarim oil field, it is not enough
to use API, ISO, SY, and GB standards;
therefore, the field has adopted several
other standards for reducing drillstring
failures.
Two joints of new drill collars broke
during January-March 2006 and their

StatoilHydro publishes Troll Blend assay
StatoilHydro late last
year published an assay
of its Troll Blend crude
oil, a commingling of
Troll B, Troll C, Fram,
and Kvitebjorn fields off
Refining
Norway and operated by
the company.
Troll field lies in the northern part
of the North Sea, about 65 km west of
Kollsnes, near Bergen (map). It consists
of the main Troll East and Troll West
structures in Blocks 31/2, 31/3, 31/5
and 31/6.
The field contains, according to
StatoilHydro, about 40% of total gas
reserves on the Norwegian continental
shelf, one of the largest oil fields on the
shelf. In 2002 the oil production was
more than 400,000 b/d. In addition to
Troll A, B, and C platforms, StatoilHydro operates the landfall pipelines. Gassco operates the gas processing plant at
Kollsnes on behalf of Gassled. StatoilHydro is a technical services provider
for Kollsnes operations.
StatoilHydro expects the reservoirs
1,400 m below sea level to produce for
at least another 70 years.

New shale shaker offers small footprint
The new MD-3 shale shaker promises
operators with the ability to meet solids
control challenges, offshore or onshore.
The small footprint of the shale shaker
along with its solids control options and
the ability to adapt quickly to changing
drilling conditions are features of the
compact, high performance unit. The
shaker’s footprint matches the BEM-650
shaker to help simplify retrofitting into
existing shaker houses. The MD-3 comes
with a fume-extraction hood that helps
reduce operator exposure to vapors associated with drilling fluids and prevents
fluids from splashing outside the shaker
boundaries.
The shaker has three decks of solids
control that translate to lower waste volumes as a result of drier cuttings, the firm
says. The standard configuration has one
scalping deck and two primary decks.
Two modes of operation, 6.3 G’s of
progressive elliptical or 7.2 G’s of balanced
elliptical movement, are available with

a single-switch adjustment. And screens
replacement is a snap with the pneumatic
actuators that hold them in place. Simply
deactivate the pneumatic pressure and
remove the lightweight composite screens
to replace.

New packer provides openhole annular isolation
The newly developed Baker Oil Tools
MPas packer system provides openhole
annular isolation, which the company says
helps to eliminate many of the operational, production, and remedial problems
associated with cement jobs.
The MPas-e Remote-Set packer system
with eTrigger technology allows operators
to achieve selective zone isolation in open
holes in extended reach wells.
Run on production casing or liner
string, the MPas packer—plus the uniform
production profile created by the BOT
EQUALIZER inflow-control devices—enables flow in the annulus to be managed

without the limits or risks associated with
no isolation or more complex isolation
methods. The MPas packer provides improved time-to-seal control and a wider
hole-size range than swelling rubber
technology, the firm says.
eTrigger controller technology is a
method of electronically activating the
MPas packer, eliminating the costs, complexity, and logistics of an inner string
run for packer activation. eTrigger is computer programmed and once downhole,
the controller activates the packer when
the programmed temperature and pressure conditions are reached.
The successful use of Interventionless
e-Trigger technology enables operators to
economically isolate and control production from wells drilled with extended
reach drilling methods, the company
points out.

GE Oil & Gas,
Florence, Italy, and Al Shaheen Energy
Services, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Qatar Petroleum established to develop
partnerships in the oil and gas and energy
industries, have signed two partnership
agreements. Under the first agreement
Al Shaheen becomes a 50% strategic joint
venture partner in PII Pipeline Solutions.
GE Oil & Gas will maintain operational
control of the business. GE Oil & Gas and
Al Shaheen have also signed a 50:50 JV
agreement to perform aftermarket services
for the GE Oil & Gas installed fleet in Qatar. It will provide an enlarged range of
turbine, compressor, and related auxiliary
equipment services. The JV will help Qatar achieve increased oil and gas capacity
by providing the most advanced technologies for the inspection, maintenance, and
repair needs of the local oil and gas industry. The broader application expertise
available will include LNG and pipeline,
gasification and storage, and refinery and
petrochemicals.
GE Oil & Gas is a world leader in
advanced technology equipment and
services for all segments of the oil and gas
industry, from drilling and production,
LNG, pipelines and storage to industrial
power generation, refining, and petrochemicals.

Helmerich & Payne Inc.,
Tulsa, has announced that it expects
its second fiscal quarter of 2010 to be
impacted by Venezuela’s currency devaluation. The company’s preliminary
estimates regarding the impact of this
devaluation on its consolidated financials
indicate that it will probably result in an
exchange loss of about $20 million to
be recorded in the second fiscal quarter ending Mar. 31, 2010. Not included
in this estimate is the decline in value
of uncollected invoices issued since the
company changed its revenue recognition
to cash basis for its Venezuelan operation. H&P has not received any payments
since its fiscal yearend earnings report on
Nov. 19, 2009. All 11 H&P rigs that formerly worked for Petroleos de Venezuela
SA remain idle.
H&P is primarily a contract drilling
company.

From the Subscribers Only area of

Dramatic education
sometimes the best
antidote for fear
Because antidevelopment environmentalists know how to manipulate fear,
advocates of oil and gas development need
to know how to combat it. Fear and its environmentalist promoters are impeding development of the huge Marcellus shale gas
resource in New York and Pennsylvania.
Opponents to drilling have raised fear
about hydraulic fracturing, the technique
that has been used safely and often since

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

the 1940s, modern refinements to which
make shale development possible.
But use of hydraulic fracing is new to
parts of Pennsylvania and New York, and
drilling opponents say it threatens subsurface drinking-water supplies.
Gas operators and industry associations have made commendable efforts to
educate the wary public, pointing out how
technology and geology make fracing safe.
Yet fear persists. Education isn’t
enough.
New York state regulators have proposed rules that Chesapeake Energy Corp.
says will discourage Marcellus shale drilling (OGJ Online, Jan. 14, 2010). And Exco
Resources Inc. was under pressure from a
zoning issue trumped up by environmental
opposition (OGJ Online, Jan. 15, 2010).
Fear thus imperils development of a
resource that some say represents 500 tcf
of recoverable gas—and all the economic
goodness that comes with it.
When education fails, what’s left?
Drama. That’s what.
Fear gripped California in 1981 when an
infestation of the Mediterranean fruit fly—
the medfly—threatened agriculture.
After other eradication efforts failed,
then-Gov. Jerry Brown ordered aerial
spraying of the insecticide Malathion over
an area that included Palo Alto, Los Altos,
and Mountain View. In the uproar that followed, with environmentalists threatening
to shoot helicopters spraying the chemical, officials began a massive educational
campaign about Malathion’s safety.
In the middle of it all, Brown’s chief of
staff, Republican Brien Thomas Collins,
a wounded Vietnam War veteran, held a
news conference during which he drank
a beaker of Malathion to assure reporters
they’d be safe covering the story up close.
The Malathion assault proceeded,
stopped the medfly infestation, and created no health crisis. Collins died on Mar.
19, 1993, of a heart attack.
That’s drama. That’s education. Anyone
for a glass of frac fluid?

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

Energy markets in transition
This year will likely see a transition of energy markets back to “traditional fundamentals” of supply, demand, and inventories in place of the financial, currency,
and equity market drivers that dominated 2009, said Adam Sieminski, chief energy
economist, Deutsche Bank, Washington, DC.
“This would mean that rallies in the oil price above $80/bbl will only become
sustainable in 2011,” he said. Deutsche Bank analysts also expect natural gas
prices to average $6/MMbtu in 2010 and remain close to that average in 2011-12.
Oil prices in early January hit their highest levels since October 2008, peaking
$10-12/bbl above December lows, as a result of rising equity markets, a weakening
US dollar, and extreme winter weather over most of the US—indeed, much of the
Northern Hemisphere.
While it’s possible to explain the recent rise in oil prices, said analysts at the
Centre for Global Energy Studies, London, “It remains difficult in our view to
justify the base from which it rose. Dated Brent averaged $75/bbl in December, a
price level that is hard to explain given that the recovery in oil demand has been
weak and inventories remain very high, China excepted. Crude stocks at Cushing,
Okla., the West Texas Intermediate contract’s delivery point, are at a record high,
for example, and the small draw in middle distillate stocks in the US for the week
ending Jan. 1, despite the cold weather, suggests that tertiary stocks (those held
by the end consumer) are still substantial. Had inventories come under serious
pressure, then the contango in the oil futures market would have flattened noticeably, but there is little evidence of this.” CGES analysts acknowledged, “The global
economy is finally in recovery mode thanks to a veritable flood of cheap government money and fiscal stimulus programs in 2009, but the cost of generating the
rebound will become increasingly evident during the course of this year and a
growing awareness of this could lead crude prices lower, especially after the cold
snap comes to an end.” They said 2010 likely will present “its own set of debt-related challenges that will threaten the economic recovery.”
In Arlington, Va., analysts at FBR Capital Markets & Co. said, “Overarching
concerns about the value of the dollar and the ever-present global geopolitical risk
only add to our bullish secular outlook.” However, they warned, “It is important to
keep in mind that increase in global environmental stewardship could cause near
and intermediate-term upward pressure on the value of all hydrocarbon-based
commodities; longer term, it could cause structural downward demand pressure.”
Market forces
Some of the market forces that recently drove up energy prices are likely to be
less supportive over the remainder of the year, Sieminski said. “We expect the US
dollar will strengthen in anticipation of [Federal Reserve interest] rate hikes,” he
said. “Moreover, in terms of physical fundamentals, we believe the high levels of
oil inventories in the US and across the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development will be the Achilles heel for oil prices during 2010. Indeed, we
find that the high level of Petroleum Administration for Defense District 2 inventories [in the Midwest] means the flattening in the crude oil forward curve may be
difficult to sustain. We believe oil prices are therefore in danger of moving into
overbought territory.” The International Energy Agency in Paris reported global
crude production increased 270,000 b/d to 86.2 million b/d in December with higher output from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC
producers. OPEC production increased 75,000 b/d to 29.1 million b/d in December,
putting spare capacity at 5.4 million b/d.
Deutsche Bank expects global oil demand to increase 1.3 million b/d this year,
the same amount it declined in 2009. “Most of that growth should be in the nonOECD nations. Oil demand growth of 1.3 million b/d is consistent with global gross
domestic product growth of 3.5%,” said Sieminski. He noted, “Land-based OECD
oil stocks are falling, but overall levels remain ample. Crude inventories are back to
normal levels, but middle distillate stocks are exceptionally full. Floating inventories of both crude and distillates remain abundant.”
Deutsche Bank analysts expect the Environment Protection Agency to approve
a five percentage point increase in ethanol blend in US gasoline around midyear.
“We estimate that this will increase US ethanol demand by an additional 7 billion
gal and sustain strong demand side fundamentals for corn. Indeed on our estimates the proportion of US corn production employed in the US ethanol industry
will rise to almost 40% by 2012,” Sieminski said.

We never stop working on well-placement
solutions to make increased recovery a reality.
At Baker Hughes, we realize how crucial it is to pinpoint the ideal wellbore location that will maximize
production. We also know how difﬁcult that task can be—especially when you’re drilling in areas with
geologic uncertainty.
That’s why we offer an array of geosteering technologies to address your unique operational challenges.
Our AziTrak deep azimuthal resistivity LWD provides a complete 360° view of the downhole environment.
And our Reservoir Navigation Services—along with our BEACON collaboration centers —use these and
other real-time measurements to help you make faster, more accurate well-placement decisions. Of course,
these are just a few of the solutions available to help maximize your recovery.

Technology Forum: ReÔ¨Åning Equipment and Services‚Äî
reÔ¨Åners worldwide grapple with keeping their process
units Ô¨Åt and running as capacity utilization remains at
record levels. Which technology resources will they utilize to ensure their plants‚Äô reliability? The latest options
are reviewed.

The Ô¨Årst phase of the Sakhalin-1 project, one of the world‚Äôs
most ambitious developments, reached peak production of
250,000 barrels of oil per day in the Ô¨Årst quarter of 2007.
Sakhalin-1, a New Frontier details this pioneering development from its formative stages on the remote Sakhalin shelf
in the Russian sub-Arctic in the early 1990s. Operated by
Exxon Neftegas Limited on behalf of a Ô¨Åve-company international consortium, Sakhalin-1 is expected to continue
reaping beneÔ¨Åts for Russia, the Asia-PaciÔ¨Åc and an energyhungry world for at least the next 40 years.

Scorpion Offshore, established in 2005, is building Ô¨Åve
premium jackup rigs in Brownsville, Texas, the Ô¨Årst of
which will be delivered the Ô¨Årst half of 2007. The Relentless Pursuit of Performance Excellence presents the company‚Äôs operating, engineering and recruitment, training
and retention philosophies as it prepares to take delivery
of its new rigs, which are being marketed internationally.

San Bartolo Rodriquez Cano-1 is an indicated discovery in the
Sandino basin in northwestern Nicaragua.The well encountered
gas-condensate and light oil in eight zones below 6,000 ft in
Paleocene Brito formation turbidites.Though not tested as of
late March, it could signal the Central American country‚Äôs first
hydrocarbon production capability. It was drilled with a rig from
Mexico and other services provided from the US and Canada.

Enhances
Flow
Blocks
Corrosion
InnerArmor coatings are
high-density, non-porous
and chemically inert. They
provide an exceptionally
strong barrier against
corrosion and erosion.

InnerArmor has a very low
coefficient of friction. And it
repels water. Liquids slide
through quickly and flow is
improved ‚Äî reducing fouling
and using less energy.

A Perfect
Surface
InnerArmor has no grain
structure, no porosity. Like
glass, it goes on smoothly,
evenly and pinhole-free.
Making it impervious to
chemical attack.

Ultra
Hard
InnerArmor, with hardness of up to 3,000
Vickers, is many times
harder than steel. So
it extends product life
by standing up to
wear and abrasion.

Multi-Layer
Strength
Multiple layers give extra
strength. And combining
different layer materials
allows InnerArmor coatings
to be custom tailored to
achieve specific qualities.

InnerArmor and Sub-One are trademarks of Sub-One Technology

InnerArmor:
Breakthrough Technology for Inside Coating
The state of the art
in inside coating...
InnerArmor‚Ñ¢ is a major
advance: a patented new
way to put an extremely
hard, smooth, chemically
inert coating on the inside
of virtually everything ‚Äî from small parts to
industrial pipe.

they go on smoothly and evenly. And without
pinholes. The result: a virtually impenetrable
barrier against corrosion and erosion.
Customizable layered coatings
InnerArmor coatings can be created from many
different materials, from titanium nitride to
diamond-like carbon. And combining layers of
different materials can produce a spectrum of
coating characteristics for specific applications.

Virtually impenetrable ‚Äî by design
InnerArmor coatings are amorphous. They have
no grain structure and no porosity. Like glass,

Solving problems, reducing costs
InnerArmor technology provides new solutions
to age-old problems in many industries ‚Äî from
oil and gas to chemical processing.
Whether you‚Äôre fighting corrosion, erosion
or wear, in your pipelines or in your systems,
InnerArmor can help you
win the battles, increase
uptime and significantly
reduce your costs.

Interest

Senator proposes extension on 1998, 1999 leases
US Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-NM) reported plans to propose
3-year extensions of federal Gulf of Mexico deepwater leases issued in 1998 and 1999 without price thresholds if the leaseholders
agree to new terms including such a provision.
During a Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee hearing
on Mar. 20, Domenici, who is chief minority member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said he is open to other
ideas to bring leaseholders to the negotiating table, but added that
offering an extension in exchange for price thresholds deserves a
closer look.
Noting that the omission of price thresholds in the original
leases could cost the federal government as much as $10 billion,
Domenici said, ‚ÄúI recognize that this will not entirely solve the
problem and make the Treasury 100% whole, but the bottom line
is that this was a major mistake by [the administration of former
President Bill Clinton] that has already cost the government nearly
$1 billion. As I have said, I am open to other solutions that would
withstand legal challenges, but we must act soon.‚Äù
US House members have proposed either prohibiting holders
in future federal lease sales if they are unwilling to voluntarily renegotiate terms, or requiring them to pay ‚Äúresource conservation
fees‚Äù to make up royalties which would be suspended under the
original leases.
The US Minerals Management Service has tried to get holders
of such leases to voluntarily renegotiate terms. Six have signed new
agreements already, C. Stephen Allred, assistant Interior secretary
for lands and minerals management, told the Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee on Jan. 18.
At the Senate appropriations subcommittee hearing, US Sec. of
Interior Dirk A. Kempthorne said he would work with Domenici
and other senators to reach a solution. He also pledged that President George W. Bush‚Äôs administration would not omit price thresholds from oil and gas leases.

North, South Korea make energy pact
South Korea will provide North Korea the energy equivalent of
as much as 50,000 tonnes of fuel oil in exchange for taking initial denuclearization steps under the so-called Six-Party Framework
Agreement, which involves North and South Korea, the US, China,
Japan, and Russia.
Junichi Ihara, deputy director-general of the Japanese Foreign
Ministry‚Äôs Asian and Oceania Affairs Bureau, told reporters that the
decision was reached Mar. 15 in Beijing at the meeting of the SixParty Talks‚Äô working group on economic and energy assistance to
North Korea.

‚Äî Q u i c k Ta k e s

According to Joon Yung-woo, South Korea‚Äôs chief nuclear negotiator, the task of the working group is to determine detailed plans
and specific means of providing economic, energy, and humanitarian assistance to the North as agreed in the Feb. 13 agreement.
He was referring to the nuclear deal signed in Beijing, under
which North Korea‚Äîin exchange for heavy fuel oil or equivalent
aid‚Äîagreed to shut down and seal its nuclear reactors.
One of the main priorities of the working group is to decide
how the countries will sequence the provision of energy aid to the
north with the communist nation‚Äôs shutdown of its nuclear facilities. South Korean officials, speaking anonymously, said the actions
would have to take place ‚Äúsimultaneously.‚Äù

European gas execs reject market consolidation
Gas executives at European energy companies do not want further consolidation within Europe‚Äôs energy markets according to
a survey carried out by Deloitte at the FLAME gas conference in
Amsterdam Mar. 14.
Only 6% of delegates surveyed believed Europe‚Äôs competitive
strength in global energy markets would be improved through further consolidation. Respondents would prefer to enhance Europe‚Äôs
competitive position by harmonizing standards for cross-border
trading (44%), followed by ownership unbundling of networks
(30%), and the creation of a European regulator (20%).
Neither are delegates optimistic that all gas customers across
Europe can choose their supplier by the July 2007 deadline given
by the European Commission‚Äî83% of respondents said the deadline will not be met.
‚ÄúMany executives across the industry are comfortable with the
prospect of working in a more-competitive market environment,‚Äù
said Deloitte oil and gas leader Peter Newman. ‚ÄúThey seem more
persuaded by the arguments of the EU Commission in favor of
greater liberalization, as the best way to achieve diversification and
new investment, than of those of some of the national policy makers who continue to emphasize the role of ‚Äònational champions.‚Äô It
is quite possible that the EU‚Äôs strong new focus on energy emissions and efficiency may divert its attention away from the further
liberalization and regulation measures that form part of a single
European energy market.‚Äù

ODAC: UK was net oil importer in 2006
The UK became a net importer of oil for most of 2006, according to the Oil Depletion Analysis Centre (ODAC) in Aberdeen. ‚ÄúIt is
time for the UK government to let go of the idea that the UK will
be a net oil exporter until 2010 and accept we are now dependent
on imports,‚Äù ODAC said.
Data published by the UK Department for Trade and Industry
showed that the UK imported oil during every month in 2006

except for June. DTI forecasts that the UK will export oil for a few
months during 2007 and see a decline in domestic oil production. From 2008, the International Energy Agency and the US
Energy Information Administration expect the UK to be a net oil
importer.
In May 2006 the UK imported its highest net volume over that
year of 1.357 million tonnes of oil compared with 100,000 tonnes
of oil in March, which was the lowest volume. In June the UK exported 298,000 tonnes.
A spokeswoman for the UK Offshore Operators‚Äô Association said
the difference in oil imports and indigenous production in 2006
was small. ‚ÄúLast year‚Äôs dip can be attributed to lower-than-expected

Exploration

&

North Sea production, owing in part to delays in new fields coming on stream, reservoir performance, and maintenance programs.
Global constraints on resources, including equipment and personnel, also had an impact on activity levels in the UK.‚Äù
Crude oil production in the UK in 2006 was an estimated 1.6
million b/d, while consumption was an estimated 1.7 million b/d.
‚ÄúBased on the most recent information given to us by our
members, we believe it now likely that the UK will become a net
importer of oil from 2009 onwards. However, indigenous production could still provide 90% of the UK‚Äôs oil needs in 2010,‚Äù the
UKOOA spokeswoman said. ‚ú¶

Development

CNOOC makes oil, gas discovery in Bohai Bay
CNOOC Ltd. found oil and gas with a discovery well drilled in
the Yellow River Mouth Sag of Bohai Bay. The well, Bozhong (BZ)
28-2E-1, was drilled south of Structure BZ 28-2E between BZ 28-1
and BZ 28-2S oil fields.
The well penetrated oil pay zones with 35 m total thickness and
gas sections of 35 m. The well was drilled to 2,575 m total depth
in 20 m of water.
On test, the well flowed an average 1,600 b/d of oil through
7.14-mm and 14.29-mm chokes, and 10 MMcfd of gas through a
15.08-mm choke.
Since 2006, CNOOC has made four discoveries in the Yellow
River Mouth Sag, the company said.

and will drill one exploration well. The license lies in the north of
Libya, near the Egyptian border.
Statoil said the desert areas are little-explored in relation to petroleum resources. A few wells have been drilled in the area, but
that was in the 1960s and 70s.
During the second half of 2008, Statoil will drill the first exploration well in Libya.

MMS issues Ô¨Ånal notice for Lease Sale 202
The US Minerals Management Service issued a final notice for
OCS Lease Sale 202, covering 8.7 million acres off Alaska‚Äôs northern coast in the Beaufort Sea. The sale will be held Apr. 18 in Anchorage, MMS said.
The sale area extends from the Canadian border on the east
to the Barrow area on the west, but excludes offshore areas near
Barrow and Kaktovik, which the Inupiat Natives use for bowhead
whale subsistence hunts.
Any offshore oil and gas activity in the entire sale area will have
to be coordinated with the Inupiat whalers during their subsistence hunt, MMS Regional Director John Goll noted in Anchorage.
Stipulations for this sale were developed after consultations with
several interested parties and groups, he added.
The sale‚Äôs lease terms are the same as those used for MMS‚Äôs last
Beaufort Sea leasing, Sale 195, held in March 2005.
MMS estimates that the Beaufort Sea could contain about 7 billion bbl of oil and 32 tcf of gas on a mean conventionally recoverable basis.

Statoil ASA has proved gas and condensate on the Biotitt prospect in the Norwegian North Sea, 20 km northeast of the Sleipner
field.
Seadrill Ltd.‚Äôs ultralarge West Epsilon jack up drilled the well to a
TD of 2,360 m, targeting Cretaceous rock, with gas and condensate
being proved in the Heimdal formation of Tertiary age.
Statoil will investigate whether it will produce the find using
the Sleipner platform. Statoil said it would carry out an evaluation
and analysis of the gathered data to determine the find‚Äôs resource
potential and that a joint development with the 16/7-2 find south
of Biotitt could be an option.

Production

Gas production starts from Bibiyana Ô¨Åeld
Chevron Corp. has brought on production from Bibiyana gas
field on Block 12 in the Habiganj district of northeast Bangladesh.
The field is expected to initially produce 200 MMcfd of gas and
peak at 500 MMcfd by 2010. At that time, Bibiyana would be the
largest producing gas field in the country.
The field development project includes 12 development wells, a
gas plant, a gas pipeline, and a condensate pipeline. The gas plant‚Äôs
full capacity of 600 MMcfd is scheduled to be reached later this
year.
Due to the 2005 Chevron and Unocal Corp. merger, Chevron
has a gas sales agreement with state-owned Petrobangla. Under that
contract minimum volumes of 200 MMcfd will increase to 400
MMcfd at the end of 2008 (OGJ, Dec. 6, 2004, p. 44).
Chevron holds a 98% interest in the field.

Processing
Williams to pay $2.2 million for pollution charges
Williams Refining Co. agreed to pay $2.2 million to settle
charges that it violated Clean Air Act provisions at its Memphis refinery, the US Department of Justice and Environmental Protection
Agency jointly announced.
The Mar. 14 settlement agreement resolves allegations that the
Williams Cos. Inc. subsidiary, which owned and operated the plant
from the mid-1980s until its sale to Premcor Refining Group Inc.
in March 2003, did not comply with regulations intended to prevent benzene emissions. Valero Energy Corp. acquired Premcor in
2005.
Williams Refining‚Äôs settlement also resolves allegations that it
did not follow leak detection and repair regulations for the refinery‚Äôs equipment as specified in the CAA. Additionally, the agreement resolves assertions that the company did not properly store
hazardous waste, as required under the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act, and one violation of the Clean Water Act for an oil

EPA said it initiated an investigation of the refinery after it became suspicious of Williams Refining‚Äôs report of less than 10 Mg
of benzene emissions based on the plant‚Äôs size. The CAA requires
refineries that discharge more than 10 Mg/year to manage their
wastewater in compliance with the Benzene National Standards for
Hazardous Air Pollutants.
EPA said that the CAA also requires refinery operators to monitor pumps and valves for leaks, and to report any which are discovered. It said that it discovered more violations during an inspection
on Nov. 5 and 6, 2002, and as a result of a Feb. 2, 2002, pipeline

CSB investigators began working at the site a few days later, interviewing witnesses and examining the area where the fire began. ‚ÄúThe exact mechanical failure that led to the propane release
remains to be identified. Further modeling and testing of piping,
valves, and flanges will be needed to determine precisely what happened,‚Äù lead investigator Jim Lay said on Mar. 9.
He said Valero has cooperated with the investigation and has

PDVSA to convert reÔ¨Ånery for heavy oil
State-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) will work with
Japan‚Äôs JGC Corp. on basic engineering for a deep conversion project at PDVSA‚Äôs 200,000 b/d refinery at Puerto la Cruz.
In a statement, PDVSA said the project‚Äîto be completed in
2008‚Äîinvolves adding new technology to enable the refinery
to process extraheavy oil from the Orinoco tar belt instead of the
lighter crude oil it now processes.

PDVSA said the Puerto la Cruz expansion, estimated to cost
$1.7 billion, will enable the facility to refine an additional 80,00090,000 b/d of heavy crude.
The government of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has been
implementing a program to nationalize the country‚Äôs oil industry,
including sectors producing the heavy crude to be processed at
Puerto la Cruz.
The government warned it will assume control of operations
unilaterally if the companies do not cooperate by May 1. ‚ÄúIf by
the deadline there is no agreement, we will take direct control of
all these operations,‚Äù said Energy Minister Rafael Ram√≠rez.
On Mar. 12 ExxonMobil said it would participate in a transition
committee to oversee the transfer of its control of the Cerro Negro heavy crude facilities in the Orinoco belt. The facilities, which
convert tar oil into high-value synthetic crude, are valued at $31
billion.
ExxonMobil and PDVSA each own a 41.7% stake in the venture,
with the remaining 16.6% held by BP. ‚ú¶

Qatar Petroleum and ExxonMobil Corp. announced the completion of RasGas LNG Train 5 in Doha.
Completed in 29 months, Train 5 has a designed capacity of
4.7 million tonnes/year of LNG and will supply gas to northern
Europe.
RasGas currently operates five trains in Ras Laffan; Trains 6 and
7 are currently under construction. Those two trains, each with
capacity to process 7.8 million tonnes/year of LNG, are expected
to start-up in 2008 and 2009, respectively.

Kozmino terminal given environmental nod
Russia‚Äôs environmental oversight agency Rostekhnadzor said a
projected oil terminal at Kozmino, on Russia‚Äôs Pacific Coast, will
present no threat to its surroundings when constructed.
Head of Rostekhnadzor Konstantin Pulikovsky said plans were
ecologically safe for the oil port at Kozmino, selected as the export terminus of the planned 4,300-km East Siberia Pacific Ocean
(ESPO) pipeline.
Kozmino will be capable of receiving deepwater tankers and
handle crude exports of as much as 80 million tonnes/year‚Äîthe
pipeline‚Äôs largest projected throughput.
The pipeline route has already been altered following criticism by Russian President Vladimir Putin and environmental activists. State pipeline monopoly OAO Transneft last year agreed
to reroute the pipeline away from Lake Baikal (OGJ Online, May
25, 2006).

Gassco assesses gas pipeline routes to Europe

bring Norwegian North Sea gas to Europe. The company will publish its concept selection in May, a senior Gassco official said Mar. 9.
The company will make a final investment decision in December.
Speaking at a press briefing in London, Jan Hauge, Gassco‚Äôs
executive vice-president for product management, said the three
possible landing points for the pipeline are St. Fergus in northeast
Scotland, Zeebrugge in Belgium, or Den Helder in the Netherlands.
St. Fergus would be the cheapest option as it is the shortest distance.
Gassco wants to take gas from Troll field, but the proposal is
proving controversial because Troll partner Norsk Hydro ASA is
worried that gas production would reduce pressure needed for
recovering oil from the field. Gassco is investigating the design
challenges inherent in increasing gas production without having a
negative effect on Troll‚Äôs oil production. ‚ÄúIt will require sophisticated technological work,‚Äù Hauge added.
Hydro plans to increase oil production by more than 30% to 2
billion bbl and has developed Troll‚Äôs oil resources using more than
110 horizontal wells. Hydro is also assessing whether it is possible
to accelerate gas recovery from the eastern part of Troll field while
simultaneously preparing for increased oil recovery from the western section.
Hauge declined to give estimates on the capacity of the pipeline
or its length, saying information is being assessed and will be published in May. Gassco representatives also said there has been much
political interest in the pipeline, particularly from the UK, as security of supply in Europe is a top priority. One of the other issues to
determine would be tariff levels in each landing point.
A possible start-up date for operations is 2011, although Hauge
stressed that the pipeline could be postponed if conditions are not
right. ‚ú¶

RHEO-LOGICSM
Constant Rheology Synthetic Base Mud
In deepwater applications, Synthetic Base Mud systems (SBMs) are the drilling fluids
of choice in order to manage potential risks and well costs. However, with conventional
SBMs, managing hydraulic pressure can be challenging as the effects of temperature
and pressure change the viscosity of the fluid downhole. This often leads to incidents
of lost circulation, increased NPT and higher project costs.
Baker Hughes Drilling Fluids introduces RHEO-LOGICSM, a new generation of
Constant Rheology SBM bringing greatly improved pressure management and
drilling performance to the deepwater industry.
For more information visit our website www.bakerhughes.com
¬© 2007 Baker Hughes Inc. All rights reserved.

_________

RHEO-LOGIC is simple by design, easy to use, and does not exhibit the elevated
viscosity profile of competitors‚Äô systems. This low maintenance, cost effective system has
been repeatedly field proven to reduce mud losses, allow increased trip speeds, improve
hole cleaning, and enhance overall drilling efficiency in critical deepwater wells.
For all your deepwater SBM applications, choose RHEO-LOGIC. It‚Äôs Perfectly Logical.

Frontier exploration lamp is lit
shallow-water Caspian wells. Lundin
also plans to shoot 700 km of 2D and
3D seismic.

Sandakan basin
Alan Petzet
Chief EditorExploration
Large and small operators are moving to explore many of the world‚Äôs
remote and nonproducing regions.
While some energy companies prefer to drill blanket plays in the middle
of traditional basins, others devote at
least part of their capital budgets to
rank wildcatting. A number of the latter
are described in OGJ‚Äôs E&D Frontiers
report, which starts on p. 33.
Here are a few more programs in
various stages of progress.

Indonesia and Russia

Two groups are exploring blocks in
Philippine waters of the southwestern
Sulu Sea in the Sandakan basin, which
has no offshore production.
Esso Exploration International Ltd.
took a farmout from Mitra Energy Ltd.
of Malaysia to earn a 50% interest in 2
million acre, deepwater SC 56.
Mitra was acquiring 2,400 line-km
of 2D seismic data in late 2006 and
planned to shoot a 1,600 sq km 3D
seismic survey in the first quarter of
2007 (OGJ Online, Dec. 6, 2006).
Salamander Energy PLC, London,
took a farmout from Tap Oil Ltd., Perth,
to earn a 35% interest in 4,820 sq km
SC 41 in the Sandakan basin off Borneo
Island.
Tap Oil retains a 50% interest and
operatorship. Water is 200-2,000 m
deep on the block.
The SC 41 joint venture agreed to
boost the size of the 2007 3D seismic
survey to a minimum of 600 sq km
(OGJ Online, Feb. 9, 2007).
Existing 2D seismic data reveal the
prospectivity of SC 41 to consist of a
number of leads interpreted to have
the potential for 50-150 million bbl
oil accumulations on trend from the
Wildebeest-1 exploration well, which
discovered 40¬∞ gravity oil in 2000.
The Sandakan basin has only 25
wells, and Wildebeest-1 is its only deepwater well.

Lundin Petroleum AB, Stockholm,
has a $230 million exploration budget
in 2007 that includes the drilling of 19
exploration wells in the UK, Norway,
Russia, Sudan, and Indonesia.
The company plans to drill five
exploration wells in Indonesia and
two wells on the Lagansky Block in the
northwestern Caspian Sea off Russia.
PetroChina International and Lundin
will drill all five Indonesia wells on the
Salawati Basin and Island production
licenses (see map, OGJ, Aug. 1, 2005, p.
32). Lundin said the blocks have large
remaining land and offshore exploration potential, and that several large
structures have been identified in the
Sele straits.
Lundin plans to drill Morskaya-1 and Alaska North Slope
Brooks Range Petroleum Corp. spuda second well on the Lagansky Block,
acquired with Valkyries Petroleum Corp. ded the Sak River-1 well in mid-March
in late 2006. A barge-mounted rig built 2007 on the Central North Slope.
It is to be deviated northeasterly
in Astrakhan will be used to drill the

from an onshore ice pad to a true vertical depth of 11,500 ft subsea (13,100
ft measured depth) to test Kuparuk and
Ivishak formation oil prospects that underlie Gwydyr Bay. If successful, it will
be retained as a development well.
The Sak River-1 drillsite is at the end
of a six-mile ice road extending north
from the Prudhoe Bay Unit S Pad drillsite. The most recent exploration well in
the area was drilled in 1997.
The joint venture, which controls
47,866 acres, is also drilling the North
Shore Prospect and acquiring 3D seismic surveys to evaluate leads analogous
to both prospects.

Chad basins
CNPC International (Chad) Ltd., a
subsidiary of China National Petroleum
Corp, took over EnCana Corp.‚Äôs holdings
in Chad in early 2007 for $202.5 million (OGJ Online, Jan. 15, 2007).
EnCana said it had drilled 11 exploration wells with encouraging results
on the holdings, which initially covered
more than 108 million acres in seven
basins: Lake Chad, Bongor, LogoneBirni, West Doba, Doseo, Salamat, and
Erdis.
More than half the acreage is in the
southwestern and southern parts of
the country bordering Niger, Nigeria,
Cameroon, and Central African Republic. The rest borders Libya and Sudan in
northeastern Chad.
The deal represented EnCana‚Äôs
withdrawal from Africa. CNPC has a
large and growing presence in Africa
with participation in Algeria, Libya,
Mauritania, Nigeria, Niger, Sudan, and
Tunisia.
Chad‚Äôs only oil production is the
ExxonMobil-operated Chad-Cameroon
project in the southwestern part of the
country (OGJ Online, Aug. 7, 2006). ‚ú¶

Technology surge ahead
It is the business of energy forms not now
much in use to await technological breakthrough.
Hydrogen as a major contributor to energy supply
awaits a breakthrough enabling the cheap decomposition of water or hydrocarbons. Ethanol awaits
the cheap decomposition of cellulose. Oil shale has
awaited the cheap decomposition of kerogen for
years. While these breakthroughs might someday
occur, their timing is uncertain. Around the world,
governments are spending money to accelerate
technological progress for uneconomic energy
forms. They have no assurance of success.
More certain is an imminent surge of technological progress for energy forms already dominant in the supply mix. Drivers for new breakthroughs in oil and gas technology are in place.
They include:
‚Ä¢ Cost reduction. Many modern oil field methods, including horizontal drilling, multilateral
completions, and sophisticated seismic imaging,
came into widespread use as cost-cutting tools
after the collapse of crude oil prices in the late
1980s. Nothing stimulates the development and
adoption of technology like the need to cut costs,
which oil and gas prices lingering at abysmal levels into the mid-1990s made extreme.
Although oil and gas prices are hardly abysmal
now, costs are leaping. Increased activity is pushing
demand for services and supplies against system
capacity limits. In its Annual Energy Outlook 2007,
the US Energy Information Administration reports,
‚ÄúWhile iron and steel prices increased by 72% from
May 2002 to June 2006, onshore drilling costs
increased by 100% and rental rates for offshore
drilling rigs by 200% or more.‚Äù Activity will abate
in response; indeed, projects are being canceled and
delayed. But cost pressures will stimulate technological development, as they did before.
‚Ä¢ Access to opportunities. As the article on p. 18
reports, international oil and gas companies must
adapt in profound ways to the new activism and
financial strength of national oil companies. Companies work increasingly as nonoperating partners
with state-owned counterparts as providers of
technology and capital. More than ever, therefore,
leadership with technology is crucial for access to
international upstream opportunities. Companies
that appropriately see technology as a vital dimen-

sion of competitive advantage will spend money
to acquire it.
‚Ä¢ Regulation. No let-up is in prospect in regulation of the environmental performance of the oil
and gas industry and its products. In response to
government fuel specifications, refiners have found
ways to sustain gasoline octane without adding
lead, to reduce the sulfur content of gasoline and
diesel, to remove toxic substances from fuels, and
to slash vehicle emissions of various air pollutants. Similarly, upstream operators have cut air and
water pollution associated with their work while
diminishing surface disturbance from drilling and
production. Technology produced many of the
industry‚Äôs environmental gains, which can and
must continue.
In some combination, technology and regulation also will answer concerns about greenhouse
gases and climate change. Advances will be vital
to future use not only of oil and gas but also of
coal. Unless global economic development stalls
for some reason, all three energy forms will be
needed in growing amounts, along with nonfossil supplements. Real success in the moderation of
greenhouse gas emissions depends on the extent
to which regulation accommodates economic
imperatives. It will result more from technological
progress with all energy forms than from mandates about emission levels and consumption.
Technological breakthroughs with oil, gas, and
coal will occur. They‚Äôll make fossil fuels cheaper
to produce and cleaner to use. And they‚Äôll occur
by building on past advances, sustained by the
economic superiority of these fuels, in their major
applications, relative to others.
Breakthroughs essential to hydrogen, ethanol,
shale oil, and other energy forms requiring government subsidy might occur. Prudent investment
by governments in this hope therefore makes
sense. But ‚Äúprudent‚Äù here means accommodating
the risk that payoff in terms of commercial energy
will be small, relative to total demand, or nonexistent within a reasonable investment period.
Altogether insensible would be policies that
tried to retard progress for oil and gas to make
way for nonfossil energy alternatives. Oil and gas
advances won‚Äôt cease. Doubters will find the next
few years interesting. ‚ú¶

N T E R E S T
In the energy industry, the world is
not flat. Concentration of oil and gas resources in a handful of small, powerful,
and resource-nationalistic governments
and their respective national oil companies (NOCs) has created an uneven
playing field for international oil companies (IOCs). The rules of the game are
being challenged and altered in midcourse by NOCs at host-government
direction. The
changing competitive landscape
will transform the
role of traditional
IOCs, completing a process that
began 40 years
ago with a shift in the balance of power
favoring NOCs and resource holders.
Since 2003, high oil prices have
provided NOCs the financing needed to
pursue expansion at home and overseas.
A class of NOCs that we call entrepreneurial NOCs (or commercial NOCs)
has benefited particularly, moving ag-

gressively overseas and in downstream
activities. For traditional NOCs, such
as Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) and
Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA),
high oil prices have provided governments a windfall for activities unrelated
to oil but have not necessarily boosted
oil investment.
NOC decisions about business and
political strategies will affect oil and
gas markets for years. NOC goals and
priorities will differ from those of
IOCs. In response, IOCs have sought to
strengthen their ties with NOCs, but
results are mixed.

Changing IOC roles
IOC access to equity oil and gas
reserves decreased over the past 40
years, first due to nationalizations in the
early 1970s and 1980s and then due to
tougher exploration and development
terms in the 1990s and 2000s. Currently, IOCs are finding it increasingly
challenging to acquire new oil and

may have to move away from their traditional role of full equity developers of
oil and gas fields, to pursuing a variety
of commercial arrangements with host
countries and governments‚Äîfrom full
equity interest to partial equity sharing
and fee-for-services.
As their power and wealth grew,
NOCs began to assert themselves in
world energy markets, expanding
their upstream as well as downstream
footprints. Now, some NOCs are searching outside their home countries for
equity oil and gas and are forming joint
ventures and alliances with IOCs. NOCs
need IOC technology and oil-field management expertise and are inviting IOCs
to serve as contractors for field development‚Äîa role formerly filled by service
companies. Recently, Gazprom rejected
all partner and equity development bids
from IOCs to develop giant Shtokman
gas field off arctic Russia but apparently
will bring in Statoil as a contractor.
Shrinkage of equity oil and gas
owned by IOCs is dramatic. In the
1960s, 85% of global oil and gas
reserves was fully open to IOCs‚Äô equity
participation, 14% was held by Soviet Russia, and the NOCs controlled
less than 1%. This split has reversed,
with the IOCs‚Äô full open access falling
to around 16% while NOC access to
reserves has increased to 65%. IOCs still
have limited access to reserves in places
such as Russia and China that were previously off-limits, but even this access
might fall victim to resource-nationalistic energy policies.
For example, both Shell and BP have
been pressured to reduce their equity
stakes in Russian oil and gas fields,
which will benefit Russian companies
such as Lukoil and Gazprom. Shell
recently gave up its operator status in
Sakhalin-2 after it reduced its interest
from 55% to 25%, selling its share to
Gazprom.

their ability to replace reserves. Reserve
replacement ratios (RRRs) for almost all
IOCs were higher than 100% between
1990 and 2004. Expected RRRs for
2005-10 are less than 100% for IOCs.
Despite record revenues due to high
oil and gas prices, IOCs are finding it
increasingly difficult to find potential
high-yield prospects, given the commercial and political risk inherent in
many countries. This trend suggests that

Simply indescribable.

Strategic focus
Among the many strategic thrusts of
NOCs and IOCs, four will be highlighted here: natural gas projects (including LNG and GTL), deepwater E&P, oil
sands and heavy oil, and global refining.

Gas projects
With Europe, North America, and
Asia facing natural gas shortages and
with gas demand expected to grow,
most IOCs and NOCs are investing in
future supply and LNG infrastructure.
Crucial to meeting global gas
demand is the Middle East, which
can serve Asian, European, and North
American markets and where NOCs
are taking the lead. Qatar Petroleum
soon will be the world‚Äôs largest LNG
exporter, tripling its LNG capacity to
77 million tonnes/year (tpy) by 2010.
NIOC recently signed a 25-year deal
with GAIL (India) Ltd. for delivery

East, North Africa, the North Sea, and
Russia. Gas supplies from North Africa
and the Middle East are predominantly
NOC-owned, while supplies from the
North Sea are predominantly from
IOCs. Russia‚Äôs Gazprom recently has
been seeking to capture value for its exports by raising prices to former Soviet
republics toward parity with European
gas prices.
The International Energy Agency
reports that by 2010 around 167 million tpy of gas liquefaction capacity
is planned, representing close to $73
billion of investment. If ‚Äúproposed‚Äù terminals are considered, the worldwide
investment in liquefaction capacity can
reach close to $100 billion by 2010.
Nearly half of the planned capacity will
occur in the Middle East and North
Africa. Most of the planned LNG is
destined for Asia, Europe, and North
America.
IOCs and NOCs have dedicated a
small portion of their investment to
gas-to-liquids technology. Shell and
Chevron have a plant each, and Chevron
teamed with Sasol for a GTL plant in
Qatar that came online in 2006. Chevron also is working with NNPC on a
34,000 b/d GTL plant in Nigeria.
Two other GTL plants are in advanced planning stages and can be
operational by 2010. One is a Shell
joint venture with Qatar Petroleum for
the Qatar GTL Pearl 1 plant. The other
is Sonatrach‚Äôs GTL plant in Tinhert,
Algeria.
Estimated costs for GTL plants have
leaped to $84,000 per b/d of capacity
from $20,000-30,000 per b/d a few
years ago. Increasing costs have resulted
in ExxonMobil‚Äôs pulling out of its Qatari GTL project. Others may follow due
to increased costs of the technology.

Deepwater E&P
In deep water, IOCs enjoy a strong
technological advantage and are expected to quadruple spending over the
next several years. Deepwater prospects
are in some of the few regions where
IOCs can operate relatively unhindered
by NOC terms and conditions and can
24

obtain full equity participation. In addition, deepwater prospects offer hope
for the large discoveries that IOCs need
to replace production.
The term ‚Äúdeep water‚Äù generally
means more than 1,000 ft. The Gulf
of Mexico, where water-depth records
are continually broken, is the focus
of future deepwater activity. Deepwater production in the gulf has shown
average growth rates of over 16%/year
since 1985 for oil and over 20%/year
for natural gas. In 2006, the deepwater
gulf produced 293 million bbl of oil
and almost 1 tcf of gas‚Äî72% of the
gulf‚Äôs oil production and 40% of its
gas.
Other areas of deepwater development include the Norwegian and UK
North Sea and offshore Brazil, West
Africa, and Australia.
IOCs lead in deepwater investments.
Chevron is involved in some of the
world‚Äôs most challenging deepwater
projects. Its Jack 2 well on Walker
Ridge Block 758 in the Gulf of Mexico
is in 7,000 ft of water. Three of its five
biggest projects under development
are in deep water: the Tahiti project on
Gulf of Mexico Green Canyon Block
640; the Benguela Belize-Lobito Tomboco (BBLT) project off Angola; and
the Agbami project off Nigeria, where
Chevron is collaborating with Statoil,
Petrobras, and NNPC. Shell is active in
Nigeria‚Äôs Bonga field in the Niger Delta
in water more than 3,000 ft deep.
Companies such as BHP, Eni, and Total
also are active in deep water, as are
large independent producers such as
Anadarko Petroleum, especially in the
Gulf of Mexico.
Petrobras is by far the dominant
NOC involved in deepwater activities,
mostly off Brazil but also in the Gulf of
Mexico and off West Africa. Petrobras is
working in four deepwater areas of the
Gulf of Mexico, where it plans to spend
close to $1.5 billion by 2011. A key
area is the ultradeepwater Desoto Canyon region, where Petrobras is applying technologies developed off Brazil,
including floating production, storage,

and offloading (FPSO) systems.

Nonconventional oil
Most oil sands and heavy oil projects
are in Canada and Venezuela. Of 10 such
projects to be completed by 2010, eight
are oil sands projects in Canada, and
two are heavy oil projects in Venezuela.
These capital-intensive projects are
well-suited to IOC participation. IEA estimates the cost of a Canadian oil-sands
mining operation at $45,000-60,000
b/d of capacity, with in situ projects
about half that.
ConocoPhillips has teamed with
Canadian independent EnCana to
develop oil sands in the Foster Creek,
Christina Lake, and Borealis projects.
ConocoPhillips also is involved with
Syncrude‚Äôs third phase at Fort McMurray, Alta., where an upgrader expansion
will boost capacity from 2005 levels by
50%. Shell expects to increase production in the Athabasca region to 500,000
b/d from 155,000 b/d by 2010.
In eastern Venezuela, PDVSA estimates that over 235 billion bbl of oil
reserves exist in the Orinoco heavy oil
belt.
A key to full realization of the potential of these nonconventional resources
will be technology and, more precisely,
how to improve recovery rates at acceptable costs. This is a role IOCs can
fill. An issue of heavy oil and bitumen
development in Venezuela will be the
extent to which nationalist policies
deter IOC participation.

Global reÔ¨Åning
With worldwide spare refining
capacity rapidly diminishing, new capacity will be critical as demand grows
for oil products and the crude slate
becomes increasingly heavy and sour.
Low and uncertain refining returns
discouraged IOCs from investing in
capacity expansion until recently. The
average refinery margin worldwide
has improved to over $8/bbl in recent
years, high enough to encourage investment. IEA expects average refinery
spending to increase to $300 billion/
year in the next 5 years from $215

greenfield investment will be in China,
India, and the Middle East.
In partnership with international
companies with specific expertise, Saudi
Aramco is exploring the possibility of
building two grassroots export refineries in Saudi Arabia. It has signed an
agreement with Sumitomo Chemical
Co. of Japan to transform its Rabigh refinery through joint venture PetroRabigh into a fully integrated petrochemical complex. And it is exploring plans
to develop joint-venture petrochemical
complexes integrated with the Ras
Tanura and Yanbu refineries.
In Kuwait, KPC plans to spend over
$5 billion through 2010 to upgrade its
refining industry and to increase capacity to process its heavy and sour crude.
Outside Kuwait, KPC‚Äôs strategy is to expand refining and marketing outlets in
high-growth areas, especially in China
and India, through downstream joint
ventures with NOCs as well as IOCs
such as Shell and BP.
PetroChina also has invested heavily in refinery upgrades and expansions while reducing capacity through
selected plant and facility closures. It is
trying to better match product yields to
the Chinese market.

Entrepreneurial NOC Lukoil plans to
upgrade refineries to produce highquality products matching Euro-3 and
Euro-4 standards. Eni is investing in
conversion capacity to raise its refining
system‚Äôs yields of middle distillates and
to achieve greater vertical integration
with its E&P activities.
In the US, Chevron is expanding
its Pascagoula refinery and plans to
increase capacity for gasoline production by 15% by 2008. ConocoPhillips
expects to invest $4-5 billion over the
next several years at 9 of its 12 US refineries, increasing its output of clean fuels
by 15%. This increase is the equivalent
of adding a world-scale refinery.
Elsewhere, ConocoPhillips last year

other things, plans investments to

Their statements to reporters came

Chemical Safety Board‚Äôs scheduled Mar.

causes of the fire and explosion that
killed 15 people and injured another
180. The US House Education and Labor
Committee also scheduled a hearing on
Mar. 22 to examine the accident and its
worker safety implications.
CSB said many of the victims were in
and around trailers near an atmosphere
ventilation stack, which experienced a
geyser-like release after a distillation tower was flooded with highly flammable
liquid hydrocarbons. The procedure that
API is developing will deal with where
trailers and other temporary structures
should be located at refineries, said Ron
Chittum, API senior refining associate.
‚ÄúThe thrust of the document that‚Äôs
being considered is for companies to
consider multiple issues, run a risk
analysis, and consider blast and dispersion potential. There‚Äôs another alternative under consideration where it would
be possible to determine, very simplistically, where to site a trailer based on
your unit‚Äôs configuration without going
through such an extensive analysis. This
is all subject to the committee approval
process,‚Äù he said.
Chittum said the report of an
independent panel, commissioned by
BP and led by former US Sec. of State
James A. Baker III, raised issues that
the industry will need to address. He
expects CSB‚Äôs final evaluation will do
the same. ‚ÄúWhether these will become
recommendations to [the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration] for new regulations will be
determined later, and the industry will
certainly want to participate in their
formulation,‚Äù he said.

Concern with Congress
In the meantime, said Bob Greco,
API‚Äôs downstream director, the trade
association is concerned that Congress
might take actions that don‚Äôt look at the
best available data involving refinery
configurations and layouts. ‚ÄúWe will
learn from the Texas City incident and
make appropriate changes to our existing suite of standards and practices,‚Äù
Greco said. ‚ÄúBeyond that, we will work
with Congress and regulatory agencies.
But we also want to educate Congress
about the robust nature of our industry
standards.‚Äù
Chittum said pressure-release
systems such as the blowdown drum
which exploded at BP‚Äôs refinery are
safety devices designed to deal with
unplanned pressure buildups. ‚ÄúWe think
there are situations in a refinery that
use of a blowdown drum may be the
right approach, and eliminating them
in favor of a pipe flaring system may be
inappropriate,‚Äù he said.
Chittum said API does not know how
many blowdown drums are still being
used at US refineries, but said API has
formed a taskforce to address this and
other recommendations already made
by CSB.
‚ÄúCompanies already are using the
Baker report as a mirror against their
internal procedures and identifying
gaps that need to be filled,‚Äù Chittum
said. ‚ÄúThe industry also has set up a
multiassociation coalition of experts to
discuss what was learned from the Texas
City incident, but it‚Äôs still fairly early.‚Äù
he said.
Greco said US refining is one of the
nation‚Äôs most heavily regulated industries with extensive, and sometimes
overlapping, regulations from the
Environmental Protection Agency, De-

partment of Transportation, OSHA, and
other federal agencies. API has its own
standards and practices program on top
of that, including 150 recommended
procedures dealing with process safety
management, he continued.

New safety guidelines
‚ÄúWe are aware that OSHA is planning
to roll out a national emphasis program,‚Äù Chittum said. ‚ÄúOur understanding is that part of that will be increased
enforcements and visits to refineries.
Obviously, there will be more OSHA
inspectors knocking on the door and
going through records in detail to make
sure everything is being done right.
Our members expect that, and will
work with them,‚Äù he said.
Meanwhile, the American Institute
of Chemical Engineers‚Äô Center for
Chemical Process Safety said that it is
preparing to issue new safety guidelines later this month to help refinery
and chemical plant operators avoid accidents such as the Texas City refinery
accident.
The new guidelines will be contained in a book, Guidelines for Risk
Based Process Safety, and will address
many of CSB‚Äôs findings as well as BP‚Äôs
internal and independent investigations,
CCPS Director Scott Berger said in New
York on Mar. 16.
The group was working on the
new guidelines before the BP refinery
incident occurred with the intention
of capturing experience gained during the last 15 years of process safety
management, he indicated. ‚ÄúThe high
degree of openness in the BP, Baker,
and CSB investigations enabled CCPS
to also incorporate the lessons learned
in Texas City as the guideline project
progressed,‚Äù Berger said. ‚ú¶

countability Office in a new report.
Although past studies have developed modeling assumptions based on
small-scale spill data, there have been
no large-scale LNG spills or spill experiments, GAO reported. ‚ÄúWhile there is
general agreement on the types of
effects from an LNG spill, the results of
these models have created what appears
to be conflicting assessments of the
specific consequences of an LNG spill,
creating uncertainties for regulators and
the public,‚Äù the report said.
It said the US Dept. of Energy has
funded a study to address large-scale
LNG fires, but added that it will address
only 3 of the 10 top issues that a panel
of GAO-assembled experts identified as
potentially affecting public safety. The
planned DOE study currently does not
plan to address cascading failure of LNG
tanks, which its experts ranked second
most important after large fire phenomena, GAO said.
For its year-long analysis, the congressional watchdog service assembled
19 LNG experts to discuss potential
consequences of a terrorist attack on an
LNG tanker. It described the results of 6
unclassified studies of the consequences
of an LNG spill that contained new,
original research (either experimental
or modeling) and clearly described the
methodology used. It also interviewed
US agencies responsible for LNG regulations and visited all four US onshore
LNG import terminals and one export
facility.
GAO said the 19 experts agreed that
the most likely public safety impact
from an LNG spill would be heat from
a fire, that explosions are not likely to
occur in the wake of a spill unless LNG
vapors are in confined spaces, and that
some hazards, such as freeze burns
and asphyxiation, do not threaten the
public.
The experts disagreed with heat

Indonesian gas
Ô¨Ågures wobble

I

ndonesian gas is a hot topic,
judging by the number of e-mails
crowding my inbox these days. I‚Äôm
either skewered by sharp-eyed readers over dubious figures or offered
contracts to advise on lucrative developments.
Let‚Äôs get something straight: As a
journalist I hear lots of things that
sound dubious, and many of them
these days come from Indonesian
officials talking about their country‚Äôs
gas industry. In a word, we‚Äôre talking
politics now‚Äîand economics.
Indonesia has a falling output of
oil and imports crude to meet rising
domestic demand. We all know what
that means: When the price of crude
goes up, the government has to pay
more to finance the subsidy for the
domestic market.
But someone has to do something
and do it fast. For many Indonesians,
the ministry of oil and gas represents
the cavalry‚Äîalways just over the
horizon and ever ready to come to
the rescue. And ministry officials have
been more than ready to come to the
rescue‚Äîat least with words.

Japanese buyers, along with others in Taiwan and South Korea, are
among the most exasperated, having
contracted for supplies only to be
told their contracts are not going to
be honored. Singapore and Malaysia
also have been told they cannot have
any more gas after their current contracts expire.

The wobble rises

But domestic firms also have difficulty. Last week, Indonesia‚Äôs Upstream Oil and Gas Regulatory Body
(BP Migas) threatened to review the
special right granted to PT Bakrie
& Bros. over a project to build a gas
pipeline between East Kalimantan
and Central Java if the company fails
to start construction by July.
Yet back in January, the same
government‚Äîafter granting B&B
the pipeline rights‚Äîcast doubts on
the feasibility of the project. VicePresident Jusuf Kalla said the project
might not be necessary as Java has
enough gas reserves to feed itself after a large gas discovery on the Cepu

to make sound siting decisions and
to examine the positive and negative
aspects of locating terminals onshore
and offshore.
Barton cited the strong safety record
of LNG shipments, noting that more
than 40,000 tankers have delivered the
fuel over 47 years without a major spill.
‚ÄúIn the unlikely event of an LNG tanker
fire, most experts surveyed by GAO
agree that the protection zones already
required for LNG tankers will do the
job of protecting the public. That‚Äôs good
news, but given the long history of
safety, it‚Äôs also what we expected. GAO‚Äôs
recommendation for further research
is only prudent, however, and I‚Äôm confident that FERC will continue to apply
the latest science to support its licensing
decisions,‚Äù he said.
Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), a committee member whose district includes
the nation‚Äôs only urban import terminal
for LNG, said that GAO‚Äôs findings show
that further studies clearly are needed,
and that DOE needs to expand its current examination immediately to examine all the safety issues GAO‚Äôs assembled
experts identified.
Bart Stupak (D-Mich.), who chairs
the committee‚Äôs Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, said it plans to
examine national security implications
of the energy supply system because
it is concerned about how the government can best assure that LNG is
delivered safely and efficiently, given
increasing US reliance on it. ‚ú¶

in an annual report.
John S. Herold Inc. and Harrison Lovegrove & Co. Ltd. on Mar. 15
released highlights of their joint 2007
Global Upstream Mergers and Acquisitions Review.
Total expenditures on corporate
transactions last year topped $100
billion, down from more than $120
billion in 2005. Total expenditures for
asset deals increased for the fifth consecutive year, soaring 55% to more than
$60 billion. The review analyzed more
than 280 upstream transactions.
Arthur Smith, John S. Herold chairman and chief executive officer, and
Martin Lovegrove, Harrison Lovegrove
chief executive, noted this year ‚Äúcould
be a frustrating year from the industry‚Äù
because rising service costs are apt to
constrain earnings and cash flow. Meanwhile, oil and gas futures prices appear
are to be trending lower than last year.
‚ÄúEarly signs are that assets continue to
come to the market in abundance,‚Äù the
executives said. ‚ÄúBut should commodity prices stay around existing levels, it
is almost certain that deal prices will fall
against those seen last year. Some sales
will also likely be withdrawn as buyers
fail to offer prices that match the expectations of sellers. Indeed, we have already
started to see this feature developing.‚Äù
Falling commodity prices hampered
deal activity starting during the second
half of 2006, the review said.

Reserves values up
Worldwide proved reserves pricing was up 34% to $12.86/boe during
Oil & Gas Journal / Mar. 26, 2007

2006. In the US and Canada, proved
reserves pricing was up nearly 20% to
$17.89/boe. Worldwide pricing for
proved plus probable reserves also hit records, jumping threefold to $5.51/boe.
Although values were higher, the
volume of proved reserves bought and
sold fell for the second consecutive year.
Natural gas accounted for 53% of the total
proved reserves involved in 2006 transactions, a 10-year high, the review said.
The two largest corporate transactions in 2006 and four of the top five
asset deals were predominantly weighted towards gas, the review said.
The biggest corporate transaction
was the $30 billion merger of Norway‚Äôs
Statoil ASA and Norsk Hydro ASA‚Äôs oil
and gas operations, creating the world‚Äôs
largest offshore operator (OGJ, Jan. 1,
2007, p. 29). The largest asset deal was
OAO Gazprom‚Äôs takeover of a majority
stake in Sakhalin Energy Investment Co.
Ltd. (OGJ, Jan. 1, 2007, p. 29).

Buyers
Africa experienced a breakout year,
having four transactions worth more
than $1 billion each. That compared
with only two such deals during the previous 4 years. Transactions in the US and
Canada accounted for more than 55% of
total 2006 global transaction value.
Christopher Sheehan, John S. Herold
director of M&A research, told OGJ that
he expects West Africa, Canadian oil
sands, and US unconventional gas plays
to be hot spots during 2007. The deepwater Gulf of Mexico also is of keen
interest, Sheehan said. Of the 10 largest

Worldwide, well over 50% of all pipelines use
coatings which shield (block) cathodic
protection currents if disbondment occurs.
Even the best corrosion coatings develop
disbonded areas over time. Solid film backed
polymeric coatings (shrink sleeves, tapes, and
multilayer systems) can perform well as
coatings, but when they disbond, they are
proven to prevent your cathodic protection
system from working.
Cathodic shielding is a serious problem and a
documented problem. Since the late 80‚Äôs there
is a large body of published research on
shielding. Much of this research can be seen on
our website.
Corrosion coatings which permit the passage
of cathodic protection currents to water under
disbonded areas are called ‚Äúfail/safe‚Äù coatings.
In other words, if the coating fails, your
cathodic protection current can keep your
pipeline safe.
Two types of corrosion coatings are proven to
allow the passage of protective CP currents.
One of these proven ‚Äúfail/safe‚Äù coatings is FBE.
The other proven ‚Äúfail/safe‚Äù corrosion coating
is Polyguard RD-6. We have sold RD-6 since
1988, so there are thousands of installations.
We know of no project where serious
corrosion or SCC has been found under the
rarely seen disbonded areas of RD-6.

billion by 2011, according to a recent
study from energy analyst DouglasWestwood Ltd.
Just in Eastern Siberia, the growth
in expenditures is set to soar at a 43%
compound annual growth rate over the
next 5 years, according to the study, entitled ‚ÄúRussian Oil Field Services Market
Report 2007-11.‚Äù The report is based
on data collated from interviews with
key industry entities, including Russian oil companies and indigenous and
foreign oil field service contractors.
The report further suggests, however,
that the main volume of activity will
continue to occur in Western Siberia.
‚ÄúWestern Siberia currently accounts
for 70% of overall expenditure, but
with significant growth in other areas,
this will fall to 51% by 2011,‚Äù said
analyst Rod Westwood.
Attributing to this particular region‚Äôs
expenditure outlook is an increased
focus on reservoir management and

enhanced oil recovery, both in terms of
oil field services and major equipment
items such as rigs and electrical submersible pumps (ESPs), Westwood said.
‚ÄúRussia is the world‚Äôs largest ESP
market and our research shows that
over 70,000 units are currently active.
Many of the country‚Äôs aging rigs, which
have suffered from years of underinvestment, are also due to be replaced,
leading to major projected growth in
newbuild rig expenditure,‚Äù he said.
Douglas-Westwood Director Andrew
Reid said, ‚ÄúThe oil field services industry
within Russia has evolved rapidly in recent years, driven by the liberalization of
the market and a move to western business models as E&P players have moved
to outsource their servicing to specialist
contractors in an attempt to further improve their operational efficiency.‚Äù
The report confirms that Russian E&P
companies have been divesting their
inhouse oil service capability through
disposals, enabling access by third-party
providers, and allowing E&P companies to focus on reserves growth and
production. ‚ú¶

Remote and nonproducing basins
and areas are pulling in a small but
important share of exploration expenditures worldwide.
Almost every continent has examples
of seismic surveys, exploratory drilling,
or other exploration methods being
used in risky attempts at establishing
the presence of commercial volumes of
hydrocarbons.
The 2007 activity follows the announcement of several important oil
and gas discoveries made in remote
areas in 2006.
This article contains examples of the
activity and various operators‚Äô plans for
2007 and beyond.

of a petroleum system, the company
said.
In nonproducing Ethiopia, Lundin
Petroleum AB signed a production sharing contract in November 2006 that
covers blocks 2 and 6 in the Ogaden
basin.
The PSC covers more than 24,200 sq
km just west of the undeveloped Calub
and Hilala oil and gas discoveries.
Lundin Petroleum then held a 100%
interest with the government holding an option to participate with up to
10% interest in case of a commercial
discovery.
Neither block has been drilled, but
the company said indications of light
oil, gas, and condensate have been
documented in well tests and surface
seeps south and east of the blocks.
Australian independent Range Resources Ltd., Perth, completed a farmout to Canmex Minerals Corp., Vancouver, BC, in the Nogal and Darin basins
in the Puntland area of nonproducing
Somalia. Canmex will be operator and
is obligated to spend $45 million for an
80% participating interest and drill at
least two wells in each area.
Origin Energy Ltd., Sydney, acquired
3,759 line-km of seismic surveys on
blocks L-8 and L-9 in the Indian Ocean
off Kenya. Origin is operator with 75%
interest.
Seismic over some leads in Origin‚Äôs

permits appear to be associated with
direct hydrocarbon indicators (DHIs),
the company said. After a minimum of
four months‚Äô processing time, a decision must be made in the third quarter
of 2007 whether to enter the second
additional period, which carries drilling
commitments.
Rob Willink, Origin‚Äôs executive general manager exploration, said, ‚ÄúWith
interests being secured in new permits
and new seismic becoming available for
interpretation, we are entering a particularly exciting phase in the exploration of our more frontier assets.
‚ÄúThe potential for very large oil and
gas discoveries has been identified, but
as always, we remain conscious of the
geological risk and high cost associated with exploration, particularly in
our deeper water areas. To this end, we
have commenced a process of attracting
experienced partners to participate in
forward activities in these areas.‚Äù
Elsewhere in the Lamu basin, a
group led by Woodside Petroleum Ltd.‚Äôs
Kenyan subsidiary plugged the Pomboo-1 wildcat in 2,193 m of water on
Block L-5 in January 2007 and deferred
drilling a planned wildcat on Block L-7
until it could conduct a geologic study
that incorporates the Pomboo well
results.
Meanwhile, in West Africa, Roc Oil
Co. Ltd., Sydney, plans to drill three to

six wells on the frontier, 1,073 sq km
Cabinda South Block in Angola with a
rig that was to have arrived this month.
A second rig is to arrive on the block at
the end of May 2007.
The block, in the Lower Congo
basin, is unexplored since the 1970s.
Roc Oil operates the block with 60%
interest.
Roc Oil acquired 722 line-km of 2D
seismic surveys in 2005 and 416 sq
km of 3D seismic surveys in 2005 and
2006, respectively, and a high-resolution aeromagnetic survey covering the
entire block in March 2006.
Chevron produces 1.3 million b/d of
oil from Block O in the same basin just
offshore from the Cabinda South block.
Roc Oil lists the primary presalt
reservoirs as the Lucula sandstone of
Jurassic to Early Cretaceous age, sealed
by Bucomazi shales, and the Chela
sandstone of Aptian age sealed by the
Loeme salt.
Lucula is equivalent to the main
reservoir at M‚ÄôBoundi field in Congo
(Brazzaville), and Chela forms the gas
reservoir encountered at the 123-5 well
drilled by Gulf Oil (Cabinda) in 1968.
Main reservoir in postsalt plays is the
Vermelha sandstone, which accounts
for a large part of the offshore production. Secondary reservoirs include Iabe
sandstone and Pinda limestones, both
of which produce offshore, and sandOil & Gas Journal / Mar. 26, 2007

Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, and
Vietnam had important exploration in
Southeast Asia.
InterOil Corp., Toronto, is to reach
proposed TD of 10,000 ft in April or
May 2007 at an appraisal well near its
2006 Elk gas-condensate discovery
in the Papuan fold belt in Papua New
Guinea.
Elk-2, budgeted at $12.5 million,
is 2.9 miles northwest of the Elk-1
discovery on PPL 238. The gas-condensate targets are in the Miocene Puri and
Eocene Mendi limestones (Fig. 2).
The appraisal well is programmed to
test the entire 2,000-ft limestone section and intersect a postulated oil-water
contact below the gas accumulation.
The top of the gas target is at about
6,000 ft.
Meanwhile, TGS-NOPEC Geophysical
Co. ASA launched 18 months of nonexclusive geoscience surveys of Indonesia‚Äôs underexplored frontier basins in
early 2007 (Fig. 3). First data were to
be available in the second quarter of the
year.
The project was to cover 1 million
sq km in 16 sedimentary basins with
33,000 line-km of new 2D seismic
surveys, 419,000 sq km of multibeam
seaseep, gravity, and magnetic surveys,
1,500 sediment cores, 4,500 geochemical analyses, and 250 heat flow probes.
A team of geoscientists with extensive knowledge of Indonesian basins
and a proven exploration success record
in the region is to interpret the data.
Blocks are already in force in some
of the basins. For example, Premier Oil
PLC, London, was awarded a 3,396 sq
km onshore block on the southeastern
side of Buton Island, off southeastern
Sulawesi, in December 2006.
Five exploration leads have been
identified, and the work program calls
for shooting 265 line-km of 2D seismic
surveys. Premier has a 30% nonoperated interest.
Australian explorers are taking a
greater interest in several nonproducing

basins, including the Amadeus, Georgina, and Beetaloo basins.
Most of Vietnam‚Äôs oil production
comes from the Cuu Long basin with
a small amount coming from the Nam
Con Son basin, both off the southeastern part of the country (Fig. 4).
A large 2006 discovery was VRJ‚Äôs
09-3-DM-1X in the Cuu Long basin,
which flowed 3,500 b/d of oil and was
initially thought to have identified as
much as 500 million bbl of recoverable
oil.
OGJ estimated Vietnam‚Äôs production
at 340,000 b/d of oil and 15 bcf/
month of gas as of November 2006.
Pogo Producing Co., Houston, acquired 850 sq km of 3D seismic surveys
over the shelf portion of 1.48 million
acre Block 124 in the Phu Khanh basin
and plans to drill two exploratory wells
in 2008.
Only one small onshore gas field

Formigli said that Petrobras does
not want another P-36 or Piper Alpha
incident, and has learned from the
experiences. The company has intensive
training courses for new hires. The new
generation, he notes, is more aware and
has a stricter view of safety.
Schlumberger also emphasizes training. The company hired about 6,000
people in 2006 and offered about
400,000 training days during the year.
A new training center in Abu Dhabi will
open in March 2007 with the ability to
provide an additional 77,000 training
days/year.
Sbiti thinks the industry is unfortunately focused on statistics, and that as
currently reported, they do not adequately represent actual occurrences in
our industry. Contract staffers are seldom counted, for instance, in company
reporting. The industry has to evolve,
he said, and needs frank talk to avoid
glossing over realities.
As an example, he showed data
from 2001-06 on industry-recognized
fatalities, and Schlumberger-involved
fatalities (counts which included contractors), listed in Table 3. This suggests
that our current measures underreport
incidents by 100-400%. Sbiti thinks the
industry should also track all nonworkrelated fatalities to capture key knowledge. In 2006, for instance, Schlumberger found that driving and health
issues (primarily heart attacks) were the
common causes of 36 non-work-related
fatalities.
Schlumberger also tracks ‚Äúservice
quality events,‚Äù distinguished as catastrophic, major, serious, light, and nearaccident/hazardous. Although there
were some increases in three of the five
categories from 2005-06, Sbiti said he
does not see much pro-rata change, in
view of the escalated activity levels.

Nonproductive time
Asked whether nonproductive time
(NPT) has changed during the last 2
years, 48% of audience respondents
said it has gotten worse (Table 1).

Blackwood said that we do this to
ourselves, overestimate how much we
can do. Few contractors say they can‚Äôt
do a job, but often equipment doesn‚Äôt
work. The industry should either wait
for the experience base to catch up, or
admit that it is not very efficient, he
said.
Calhuzac acknowledged a widespread reluctance to say no to an operator. But he said his company is making
strides, and sold two rigs last year
instead of trying to reactivate them and
staff with experienced people. Rig performance is steady; equipment downtime has been flat for the last 2-3 years
on Transocean‚Äôs fifth-generation rigs.
Formigli said NPT has stayed the
same. He thinks the biggest problem
has been in shipyard work and construction. Well engineering and subsea

Sbiti looked back even further and
said that the supply chain system has
broken down many times during the
past 4 years, although the industry is

trying to improve upstream delivery.
Ferguson asked how the industry can
improve NPT. Formigli thinks simple
well designs for drilling and completions would help. Petrobras‚Äô approach
in well engineering is to treat reservoir

Risk
Companies face risk technically, politically, and financially.
Ferguson asked BP, if forced to
choose a single direction, whether it
would focus on either meeting production targets (today) or replacing
reserves (tomorrow). Blackwood said
the company could never choose; it was
necessary to keep both in sync.
Asked how attitudes toward risk and
reward have changed during the last 2
years, most of the audience voted that
attitudes had stayed the same (24%) or
that risk-taking has decreased (43%;
Table 1).
Blackwood was surprised by the result. Perhaps there is a perception of an
aversion to risk because new players are
heavily leveraged and act conservatively,
he said.
Sbiti said, ‚Äúour biggest risk is investing in our R&D portfolio.‚Äù Customers
are too stretched and have no time to
enter into novel, collaborative business
arrangements. But he sees that they are
still entering some new plays, taking on
risk.
Cahuzac said that high costs may
encourage a more conservative approach for technology development and
implementation. Showing data ftom
ODS-Petrodata, he noted that the average return on invested capital for the
major drilling contractors during 200105 was only 4.6%. Those 6 years were a

spent $595 million in 2006, up 17%
from $509 million spent in 2005.
Cahuzac noted that long-term
investments include not only research
and development of new technologies,
but also investments in people, in rig
upgrades, and newbuilds. Transocean
developed and patented innovative
dual-activity drilling technology by
1996 and incorporated it in its three
Enterprise-class, dynamically positioned
drillships. The Discoverer Enterprise
was the company‚Äôs first drillship to have
dual-activity capability. The technology
has paid off in increased efficiency, allowing parallel drilling operations on a
single well.
GlobalSantaFe Corp. later adopted
the technology for three of its newest
semisubmersibles: Development Driller
I, II, and III. In January 2007, a federal
district court entered an amended final
judgment against GlobalSantaFe for patent infringement.
Both companies announced the
terms of a settlement on Feb. 20, 2007,
2 days before the plenary session.
GlobalSantaFe will pay Transocean
about $15 million and future licensing
fees when operating in an area where
Transocean has dual-activity patent
rights. The fees include 3% of future
revenues from the three Development
Driller semisubs and 5% of revenues
from any other rigs that GlobalSantaFe
may acquire which incorporate the dual
activity technology.

same role as an association, disseminating information and training. But since
the monopoly was broken in 1998, he
said there is more support for SPE as a
mechanism for sharing knowledge.
Sbiti said there are too many industry events, and we could do with fewer,
with better overall quality. He thinks
that a company should have a strategy
on how to participate and collaborate.

Future
Companies are recruiting new
workers. Schlumberger envisions high
growth in the next 5 years, and needs
to hire 5,000-6,000 engineers and
technical staff. Petrobras hired 5,000 for
upstream in 2006 and ‚Äúwill maintain
this level,‚Äù stressing that the company
also has to staff new refineries. So far,
Formigli says Petrobras has 20 applicants for each position. Transocean
continues to recruit and sees a need to
focus more on evaluating competency
as well as providing training.
Blackwood said, ‚Äúwe need to continue projecting high-growth,‚Äù but
wondered, ‚Äúis there a better way to
manage boom-bust cyclicity?‚Äù ‚ú¶

Procedure calculates base gas compressibility factors
Metering

Nelson Menendez
Empresa Nacional del
Petr√≥leo (ENAP)
Magallanes, Chile
This article presents
Production
an easy and simple
spreadsheet procedure for custodytransfer calculations of the base compressibility factor for any pair of pressure and temperature conditions.
The procedure uses the second virial
coefficient data source from Reference
1. The calculated compressibility factors
are similar with values obtained from
the AGA 8 compressibility equation of
state.2

In gas industry metering applications, the base (or standard) conditions
for pressure and temperature vary, not
only with the geographical region but
among gas sales contracts.
In the US, the common base or standard reference conditions are 60¬∫ F. and
14.73 psia. In Europe, the normal reference conditions are 0¬∫ C. and 101.325
kPa, while the standard conditions are
15¬∞ C. and 101.325 kPa. Argentina also
uses 15¬∫ C. and 101.325 kPa, while
Mexico uses 20¬∫ C. and 1 kg/sq cm
absolute.
Calculations of real gas heating value,
density, base density, base volume, and
Wobbe index require compressibility
factors at base conditions. Tables list

these properties but only as ideal gas
values.
For custody-transfer, the procedure
has to adjust these values by including
a calculated compressibility factor at the
appropriate base conditions.
References provide data tables and
methods for obtaining the compressibility factor at base conditions, such as
GPA 2145, although these data generally are only true for one of most used
base conditions, which are 60¬∫ F. and
14.73 or 14.696 psia.
Anyone using other base conditions
has to find another method besides that
provided by the tables.
One solution is to use AGA 8 program (last version), but this option
requires complex algorithms and timeconsuming computer programming or
third-party software.
This article presents a spreadsheet
procedure to calculate, at custody-transfer-level requirements, a compressibility
factor at base conditions for any pair of
pressure and temperature conditions.

At conditions near ambient, pressure
less than 16 psia, the truncated virial
equation of state (Equation 1 in the
equation box) satisfactorily represents
the volumetric behavior of natural gas.
In Equation 1, the nomenclature is:
‚Ä¢ Z = Compressibility factor at base
conditions.
‚Ä¢ B = Second virial coefficient.
‚Ä¢ R = Gas constant
‚Ä¢ P = Absolute pressure at base
condition.
‚Ä¢ T = Absolute pressure at temperature condition.
For natural gas, the compressibility
factor value at base conditions is nearly
1, such as 0.99, so that B has to be
negative (Fig. 1).

the expansion of its

natural gas reserves guarantees low-cost

production and
sustainability. Iran
is therefore
currently
constructing massive new petrochemical production capacity that is approximately the
combined current ethylene capacity of
Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and China.
The petrochemical industry is one
of the most capital-intensive industries
in Iran. Feedstock is supplied from the
by-products of oil and gas exploitation,
including NGL and condensate, as well
as refined products such as naphtha,
natural gas, and ethane.
The first and also one of the biggest
petrochemical plants in Iran‚ÄîShiraz‚Äî
began operations in 1959, followed
by the Kharg petrochemical complex
located on Kharg Island, which was
established in 1966 with a capacity of

Before Iran‚Äôs revolution in 1979,
some plants such as the Razi and Bandar
Imam petrochemical complex came
into operation as well. After the IranIraq war, petrochemical production
accelerated. Iran currently produces
approximately 24 million tpy of petrochemical products.

Rise in petchem production
Production and investment in Iran‚Äôs
petrochemical industry have grown
significantly in recent years. In 1995,
petrochemical production was 8.7 million tonnes. The total volume of petrochemicals produced at National Iranian
Petrochemical Co. (NIPC) increased at
an average of 6%/year during 19952005 and reached 15.8 million tonnes
in 2005.
The production from all petrochemical complexes will be 23.6 million
tonnes in 2006.
Fig. 1 shows total petrochemical
production for 1990-2006.
The average growth rate of total petrochemical production for 1990-2006
is 14.3%/year. The largest increase in
production occurred during 1993-95
with an average growth of 30%/year
due to the start-up of the second phases
of the Arak and Bandar Imam petrochemical plants. During 1998-99, production growth was the lowest because

the Shiraz and Razi refineries were being revamped; this left the second and
third-largest petrochemical complexes
with little feedstock.
With the commencement of the
South Pars gas field development in
2001, NIPC started planning for large
gas-based petrochemical plants, many
of which came online in 2003-06.
Some of these include new petrochemical companies such as Amir
Kabir Petrochemical Co., Bu Ali Sina
Petrochemical Co., Fan Avaran Petrochemical Co., Bisotoon Petrochemical
Co., and Khuzestan Petrochemical Co.
Production growth during this period

Demand, export growth
In terms of domestic demand for
petrochemical products, growth during
1990-2006 averaged 10.5%/year and
5.3%/year during 1996-2006.
Fig. 2 shows domestic petrochemical demand for 1990-2006. This is
rather moderate compared with the
overall growth of the petrochemical
sector, leaving substantial volumes for
exports.
As previously mentioned, the Iranian government‚Äôs policy is to move
away from crude oil exports to the
export of non-crude and especially
petrochemical products. The policies
have been drafted to achieve these
objectives by encouraging the private
sector to export products; expanding
the marketing efforts beyond Iran;
improving product quality, packaging,
and after sales services; and supporting
local export establishments.
In 2006, about 78% of total annual production was exported (Fig. 3),
which brought in revenue of about $3
billion; a substantial increase from $35
million in 1990. Although the export
values pale in comparison with crude
sales, which were about $50 billion in
2006, it is still a substantial contribution, being the second-largest revenue
generating sector in Iran.

Pars petrochemical port
Iran is currently building the Pars
petrochemical port to cope with increasing production and exports. This
project consists of 15 jetties; seven
for solid products and eight for liquid
products.
Currently, the construction status
stands at 95% complete with jetty
No. 14 in operation, jetty No. 5 near
completion, and the rest of the 13 jetties to be completed by yearend 2007.
Jetty No. 5 is earmarked for the export
of products from Borzuyeh Petrochemical Co.‚Äôs aromatic No. 4, while the rest
of the jetties will cater to the export of
petrochemical products produced in the
Pars petrochemical zone.
The port will have an export capacity
of 24 million tonnes of liquid products
and 6 million tonnes of solid products
for a total of 30 million tpy. It can also
accommodate tankers and vessels of up
to 70,000 deadweight tonnes.
The port currently harbors two
ships/month of 44,000-45,000 tonnes
of LPG produced from Phases 4 and 5
of the South Pars gas field. Completion
of the Pars petrochemical port is scheduled for second-quarter 2007.

Feed-gas requirements
In 2005, petrochemical industry
alone consumed around 750 MMscfd
(more than 5 million tonnes of LNG
equivalent) of fuel and feed gas. Due
to massive investment in polyethylene
production, there is significant growth
potential for gas demand within the
country‚Äôs petrochemical industry during 2007-10.
The Iranian government has included the petrochemical industry as part of
its economic development plan, which
is categorized into 5 stages‚ÄîPlans 1 to
5. The economy is currently in Plan 4.

Plans 4 and 5 include about $24
billion for the petrochemical industry
in which much gas-fed capacity will
be brought online: 8 million tpy of
ethylene, 1.5 million tpy of propylene,
5.1 million tpy of polymers, 14.8 million tpy of methanol, 760,000 tpy of
benzene, 5-8 million tpy of ammonia,
and 4-7 million tpy of urea. The country is also actively recruiting outside
investors, further emphasizing the
significance of using energy resources
domestically.

Because most of the plants will be
gas-based, gas supplies will be diverted away from exports. This further
emphasizes our view that Iran will
continue to see escalating domestic gas
demand and, therefore, less gas available for LNG exports. The demand for
natural gas for the Iran petrochemicals should reach 1.8 billion scfd (13
million tonnes of LNG equivalent) by
2015 (Fig. 5).
Many of these projects are based on
borrowed capital and in the event that
export markets suffer, debt servicing

may become an issue.
The philosophy behind the explosive petrochemical projects is to carve a
major niche for Iran in the international
petrochemical market. Presumably,
these projects will force the projects in
the consuming countries out of business, due to expensive gas or naphtha.
Although this theory may prove correct
in the long run, consumer countries
may retaliate by imposing tariffs and
punitive dumping regulations to protect
their own industries. This may prove
to be a risky strategy, but one that will
transform the global petrochemical
industry.
It is highly likely that newer projects
will have to buy feed gas at higher prices‚Äîabout 50¬¢/MMbtu. Iran watches
the Saudi market closely; when Saudi
Arabia raised its feed-gas pries to 75¬¢/
MMbtu, Iran planned to do the same.

In addition, with international prices
paid for condensate at Borzuyeh, there
is pressure to increase domestic gas
prices. But the price hikes are being put
on hold to encourage industry development.
Meanwhile, although Iran cannot
easily increase prices, it will experience
continual pressure to do so, especially
because the Saudis are trying to raise
feed-gas prices for future projects given
the shortage of gas. It is, however, understood that even if the Iranians raised
the feed-gas price to $1.00-1.30/MMbtu, new projects will be economical,
although less attractive, compared with
the Saudis who currently charge less at
75¬¢/MMbtu. ‚ú¶

in computing the risk of a tank release.
This illustration divides the likelihood
of failure into different release scenarios
(events).
It likewise divides the consequence
of failure into different types of consequences.
To calculate the likelihood of failure,
the user needs to develop or rely on
data from others for the likelihood
(probability) of a specific event occurring. API Publication 353 provides two
methods for determining the likelihood
of failure.
In Appendix A, for a tank release,
Equation 1 (see equation box) expresses
the LOF.
Users can apply API Publication 353
Appendix A or Appendix B methods,
or they can develop any defendable approach that meets their needs.
The example used here‚Äîthe LOF of
an aboveground storage tank‚Äîapplies a
modification to the API Publication 353
Appendix A method.
This example illustrates an algorithm
60

(1)

that applies a user-defined weighting
factor to each category and subcategory
for a specific event.
Equations 2-6 calculate the LOF of
each category.
In this example, the user can define
or apply a weighting factor to each
subcategory and category. The application of the weighting factors allows the
user to reflect the company‚Äôs operating
experience and core values or tolerances
to certain types of risks.
In order to calculate the COF, the
user also needs to develop or rely on
information from others for the consequences of a specific event occurring.
API Publication 353 provides two methods for determining the COF. The user,
however, can develop any defendable
approach that meets its needs.
Equation 7 expresses API Publication
353 Appendix A COF for a tank release.
The example in this article computes
the COF of an aboveground storage tank
using an algorithm that allows a user to

apply weighting factors to each category or subcategory for a specific event.
Equations 8-10 express the approach
for computing the COF of an aboveground storage tank using these weighting factors.
Application of the weighting factors
allows the user to reflect the company‚Äôs
operating experience and core values or
tolerances to certain types of risks.
The risk of failure is the product
of the LOF and the COF. Equation 11
represents the overall risk of failure of
an aboveground storage tank. Equations
12-15 express the specific risks for each
scenario.

Risk results
Many ways of presenting the results
of a risk analysis are available. Data can
be looked at individually or in total. The
organization and presentation of the
data will depend upon the ultimate use
of the data.
One method helpful in prioritizing
maintenance, inspection, and mitigation

activities is performance of a relativerisk ranking. This approach compares
the risk of failure of each system to that
of every other system at that facility,
providing perspective on which system
is at higher risk than another. A tank
farm with multiple tanks could rank the
various risks for specific events and then
organize them to reveal the higher risk
tanks.
Figs. 4-7 illustrate this approach for
each tank-release event. Fig. 8 illustrates how the individual events can be
combined to show a total risk of failure
with respect to each system at that facility.
A similar approach can be used for
piping systems, loading and unloading areas, and ancillary facility equipment. ‚ú¶

Weld purge monitor complies with RoHS directive
Following changes to the procedures
and materials used in the production
of weld purge monitors, this firm says
its MkV weld purge monitor meets the
requirement for restriction of hazardous
substances (RoHS) compliance.
The 2006 directive from the European
Parliament, which went into effect on July
1 last year, relates to restrictions on the use
of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment.

normally can‚Äôt be heard at the surface. It
The self-contained system records the then transfers the readings produced to a
sound of perforation shots downhole that file located on the technician‚Äôs laptop.

The system‚Äôs on-board memory stores
data and prevents it from being lost in the
event of a power failure or radio transmission problem. Its cable-free feature also
means that the data are of high integrity, as
there is no risk of losing data as the result
of damage to cables.
The system makes it possible to detect
readings as low as 10 hz, which is suited
for perforating. It then records these signals into a sound file on the technician‚Äôs
laptop where they can be played back,
printed, and signed off.
Because the system is wireless, it is
simple and quick to install. To install and
operate the system, the user simply stabs
the geophone into the ground, switches it
on, heads over to the receiving unit, and
begins logging data.

Stop the press:
Scientists doubt
Gore‚Äôs alarms
It‚Äôs newsworthy when the mainstream
press takes notice of unfrenzied approaches
to climate change.
The News York Times made such news in
a Mar. 13 article by William J. Broad.
The essence: Celebrated alarms raised
by former US Vice-President Al Gore have
fallen subject to scientiÔ¨Åc scrutiny and come
up short.
Broad quotes an impressive range of

T h e
E d i t o r ‚Äô s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

scientists who see inaccuracies in Gore‚Äôs
horror movie about global warming, An
Inconvenient Truth.
Some of the quoted scientists agree
with Gore that humankind needs to change
behavior or face catastrophic warming. Others aren‚Äôt sure about that but favor lesser
precaution. Yet others argue that climate
changes attributable to people are too small
to do anything about.
Members of the group quoted by Broad,
largely can be said to disagree about the
politics of global warming but to agree that
Gore has the science, to varying degrees,
wrong. One obviously sympathetic scientist
expressed worry that Gore was ‚Äúoverselling
our certainty about knowing the future‚Äù but
praised him for ‚Äúgetting the message out.‚Äù
To some participants in the global warming
issue, propaganda comes before fact.
In Broad‚Äôs piece, Gore‚Äôs facts‚Äîthe melting ice, the vanishing coasts, the ravaging
storms‚Äîreceive the doubt they deserve.
Even better, the article gives a rare and
thorough airing to the possibility that at
least some observed warming might be part
of natural cycles.
In an e-mail exchange reported by Broad,
Gore characteristically asserted, ‚ÄúThe degree
of scientiÔ¨Åc consensus on global warming
has never been stronger.‚Äù Against the variety
of views presented in the article, however,
that deception looks Ô¨Çimsier than ever.
Responding to concerns about the accuracy of what he presented as fact, Gore
argued that his movie dealt with the most
important aspects of global warming even if
it shirked ‚Äúsome nuances and distinctions‚Äù
important to scientists.
There‚Äôs his central error. Truth about
global warming and wisdom of response lie
in the very complexities Gore wants everyone to ignore.
The right response to global warming
probably falls somewhere between no
response and blind response. Broad‚Äôs article
offers the refreshing prospect that between
the extremes, reasonable discussion remains possible.

OPEC takes no action
As expected, ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
made no move either to reduce or to increase production at their Mar. 15 meeting in
Vienna, vowing instead to monitor the world oil market until they next meet in June.
Last October, the 10 OPEC members other than Iraq voted to reduce their total
production by 1.2 million b/d to 26.3 million b/d effective Nov. 1 to stop a run-up in
crude prices. At their Dec. 14 special meeting in Abuja, Nigeria, the same 10 members agreed to shave an additional 500,000 b/d to 25.8 million b/d effective Feb. 1 ‚Äúto
balance supply and demand.‚Äù Analysts estimate OPEC actually has cut production
by nearly 1 million b/d, while OPEC ofÔ¨Åcials claim 1.2 million b/d. At any rate, crude
prices have fallen from record highs in December to $58-62/bbl in recent weeks,
although still subject to volatile swings.
At the end of their brief March meeting, OPEC ministers said, ‚ÄúAlthough all indicators clearly show that the market remains well supplied with crude oil and that the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development [countries‚Äô] commercial
oil stocks are healthy, overall oil market volatility is likely to continue.‚Äù Meanwhile,
they said the world economy in 2007 is expected to remain relatively Ô¨Årm, growing
slightly slower than in 2006 because of higher interest rates.
OPEC also issued its Monthly Oil Market Report for March in which it said a
combination of moderating demand growth and increasing distillate and conversion
capacity should lead to an increase in spare reÔ¨Ånery capacity this year.
With the end of winter and fewer concerns about the summer driving season,
market attention is expected to shift to crude oil developments in the coming
months, the report said. ‚ÄúAs a result, aside from potential downside risks to the
world economic outlook, other factors such as non-OPEC supply, the pace of incremental demand and nonfundamental factors including geopolitics warrant close
monitoring as they are expected to be the main drivers behind crude oil price movements in the coming months,‚Äù the report said.
‚ÄúOverall, reÔ¨Åners are sitting on comfortable stock levels across the world, and
with the completion of US reÔ¨Ånery maintenance schedules, gasoline stocks in the US
could rebound from the recent draw ahead of the driving season,‚Äù OPEC said.
The report increased its estimate of world oil demand growth for 2007 by 100,000
b/d to 1.3 million b/d, or 1.5%, primarily because of increased North American demand this winter. Non-OPEC output is expected to average 50.6 million b/d in 2007,
an increase of 1.2 million b/d over the previous year and a downward revision of
46,000 b/d from the last assessment. Preliminary data for February put non-OPEC
supply at 50.5 million b/d. In February, OPEC crude production averaged 29.96 million b/d, broadly unchanged from the previous month. In 2007, demand for OPEC
crude is expected to average 30.4 million b/d, broadly unchanged from the previous
year.
Psychological difference
On Mar. 14, the day before the latest meeting, the average price for OPEC‚Äôs basket
of 11 benchmark crudes dropped 11¬¢ to $57.14/bbl, compared with $57/bbl at the
start of the December meeting in Abuja. ‚ÄúWhile the value of the OPEC basket is little
changed since Abuja, psychologically there is of course a huge difference between
December‚Äôs weakening $57/bbl and the current $57/bbl, having recovered from a
January low below $48/bbl,‚Äù said Paul Horsnell at Barclays Capital Inc., London.
Much of the underlying market sentiment, ‚Äúparticularly among speculative funds,
is somewhat negative just as it was in December,‚Äù Horsnell said. However, the
market‚Äôs focus ‚Äúhas perhaps shifted from more immediate direct concerns about
the possibility of slowing oil demand and rising oil supply to less deÔ¨Åned concerns
about macroeconomic growth prospects derived from factors as diverse and as
distanced from the oil market as the subprime mortgage market and equity market
performance,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn other words, sentiment remains fairly negative but is perhaps now centered on features that OPEC has less direct control over.‚Äù
Prices and speculative sentiment might not have changed much over the past 3
months, but OECD inventories have fallen faster than the usual seasonal pattern,
and crude supplies have tightened. ‚ÄúMarket balances going forward look tighter than
they did previously under all the main forecast models. That tightening has been due
to the reduction in OPEC output combined with the general move to more pessimistic views on non-OPEC supply growth and the relative solidity in the views held of
demand,‚Äù said Horsnell.

COVER
Saudi Aramco’s 550,000-b/cd refinery in Ras Tanura, looking north toward the crude unit and Rheniformer, is the largest
refinery in the Middle East and seventh largest in the world,
according to the 2007 OGJ Refining Survey. Worldwide in 2007,
the number of refineries remained stable, while global capacity
increased slightly. For the sixth year in a row, worldwide capacity
is at a record level. Apache Corp. established its newest core area in
Argentina (lower photo) in 2006 with acquisitions of exploration
and production assets in the Neuquen and Austral basins, including 714,000 acres on the island of Tierra del Fuego.This week’s
Worldwide Report, starting on p. 22, includes an article discussing
worldwide production and an article, starting on p. 50, covering the
latest capacity trends from the refining survey. Photos from Saudi
Aramco and Apache.

SEC mulls oil, gas reserves disclosure rules
The US Securities and Exchange Commission is seeking public
comment on possibly revising oil and gas reserves disclosure requirements.The proposal recognizes that significant changes have
occurred in the business in the 3 decades since the federal securities regulator first adopted oil and gas reserves disclosure rules, it
said on Dec. 11.
“Technological advancements over the last 30 years have
changed the way in which companies detect and extract oil and gas
resources. Managements of oil and gas companies rely on these advancements to consider their investments,” said John White, who
directs SEC’s corporation finance division.
A number of analysts and investors also told the agency that its
oil and gas disclosure requirements needed to be updated to reflect
companies’ reserves and how they are managed, he added.
The commission seeks input on five questions:
• Should the SEC revise the proved reserves definition, including assessment and measurement criteria?
• How do new technologies affect that definition?
• How might the rules be changed to accommodate future
technological innovations?
• Should the rules permit other resource categories to be disclosed?
• Should the rules require third-party verification of companies’ reported reserves?
Comments may be filed with the SEC for 60 days following the
notice’s publication in the Federal Register, SEC said.

MMS to revise Indian oil valuation rule
The US Minerals Management Service has published a revised
US Indian oil valuation rule, which the Department of the Interior
said is designed to bring more certainty to the valuation process,
as many changes have occurred in the oil market since the March

Exploration

&

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

1988 oil valuation rule was codified.
MMS also is seeking nominations of individuals to a negotiated
rulemaking committee to make recommendations regarding the
“major portion” provision contained in most Indian tribal and allotted leases. The committee will include representatives from the
federal government, Indian tribes, individual Indian mineral owners, and the oil and gas industry, it said.
The agency said the leases define “major portion” as the highest price paid or offered at the time of production for the major
portion of oil produced from the same field. The rulemaking is intended to improve the Indian oil valuation process by eliminating
reliance on posted prices and addressing the unique terms of tribal
and allotted leases, MMS said.

Oil services consolidation continues
The end of 2007 brought more consolidation with oil services.
National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NOV) is buying Grant Prideco Inc.
for $7.4 billion in cash and equity.
The boards of both companies already approved the transaction,
which creates a giant supplier of drilling rig equipment and pipes
used in oil and gas wells.
Separately, private equity firm First Reserve Corp. said it was
acquiring European for Abbot Group PLC for $1.8 billion.
First Reserve said it was the largest private equity buyout in the
drilling services industry. Last month, offshore drilling contractor
Transocean Inc. bought GlobalSanteFe Corp for $18 billion.
NOV and Grant Prideco both are based in Houston. Closing is
expected in the first half of 2008. Upon completion, current stockholders of NOV will own 86% of the combined company.
The transaction remains subject to regulatory and Grant Prideco
shareholder approvals. NOV designs, manufactures, and sells drilling and production equipment and provides field services. Grant
Prideco specializes in drillstem technology and drill pipe. ✦

Development

Indonesia reduces exploration period for blocks
Indonesia’s upstream oil and gas executive agency BP Migas
may reduce the mandatory oil and gas exploration period to 3
years from 10 years to accelerate exploration at newly awarded oil
and gas blocks.
BP Migas Chairman Kardaya Warnika said if oil and gas companies fail to find reserves during the 3-year period, they would have
to return the leases to the government. Should the companies find
reserves during the period, they would not be given deadlines for
conducting drilling activities, he said. Under current regulations,
oil and gas contractors have 10 years for exploration and drilling
activities, or the government will revoke their rights.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

“We plan to exclude drilling activities from the list of commitments stated in the exploration stage. Drilling can be done only if
the feasibility study proves that reserves are available,” Kardaya said.
His hope is that the government will see a 30% increase in oil and
gas production by 2009, rising by 100,000 b/d to 1.03 million
b/d as targeted in the 2008 national budget.

Thailand awards 10 exploration blocks
Thailand has awarded 10 exploration blocks in its current petroleum exploration licensing round.

Hannon Westwood forecasts 210 wells on UKCS
Operators on the UK Continental Shelf are expected to drill at
least 210 wells by 2010, according to a report by UK North Sea
consultancy Hannon Westwood LLP, Glasgow.
A total investment of $500 billion will be required to maximize
the UKCS’s potential of 24 billion boe over the next 40 years. About
$1 billion/year should be spent over the next 4 years to develop
83 exploration prospects with farmin investment. The consultancy
forecasts that 50 exploration and appraisal wells will be drilled on
the UKCS each year.
However, operators are turning away from the gas basin on the
UKCS because of low gas prices and high equipment costs. Instead,
gas-prone companies are moving into oil projects, particularly in
the Central North Sea.
The report said, “The majority of the 83 wells expected to be
partially or fully offered for farmin funding–mostly in the Central
North Sea–are mainly offered by independents that are seeking to
fully fund their portfolio of proposed wells.” There are 26 prospects on promote or frontier licenses up for farm-in opportunities.
In contrast, the number of projects available in the southern North
Sea for farmin have fallen since July 2007.
Chris Bulley, executive director of Hannon Westwood, said:
“Since we first started reporting on farmin opportunities, the Central North Sea has consistently delivered the most farmin opportunities, signaling a continued drift towards an oil province and
despite the continued uncertainty over gas prices a continuation in
[high pressure, high temperature] drilling.”

Chevron’s main Chinese subsidiary will be the operator and

The Chuandongbei area includes Tieshanpo, Dukouhe-Qilibei,
and Luojiazhai gas fields (OGJ Online, Aug. 8, 2007).

Total makes oil ﬁnd on Angola’s Block 32
Total SA and its partners have tested 5,400 b/d of oil from the
Alho exploration well on deepwater Block 32 off Angola.
The well, drilled to a TD of 4,981 m, produced 26º gravity oil
from reservoirs in the Oligocene section. Alho is the twelfth discovery on Block 32. Earlier this year Total and its block partners
drilled the Colorau-1 exploration well, the group’s eleventh find
on Block 32 (OGJ Online, Aug. 7, 2007). Alho was drilled in 1,700
m of water and hit Upper Oligocene oil-bearing reservoirs. It is 9
km northwest of the previously announced Cominhos discovery
and is 155 km off the Angolan coast in 1,607 m of water.
Operator Total holds 30% in the block. Other Block 32 partners
include Marathon Oil Co. 30%, Sonangol EP 20%, Esso Exploration
& Production Angola (Block 32) Ltd. 15%, and Petrogal 5%.

Cuba invites Russian ﬁrms to explore offshore
Cuban Deputy Foreign Minister Eumelio Caballero, in Moscow
on a state visit, invited Russian oil and gas companies to undertake
exploration off Cuba in the Gulf of Mexico.
“We are in contact with the Russian companies, and we hope
that they participate in the prospecting for those deposits, in particular creating the necessary infrastructure,” said Caballero.
He said Cuba is “open to cooperation” and that “favorable” political conditions on the island create “magnificent prospects” for
Russian firms that participate in the project. “Russia and Cuba have
considerable prospects for increasing their bilateral economic and
trade links,” he said, adding that one of the most attractive and
advantageous areas is energy cooperation.
Caballero said his country has signed contracts with companies
from Spain, Norway, Venezuela, and China for exploration and exploitation of offshore petroleum deposits.

Brazil awards ﬁve Santos basin blocks to Karoon

Melbourne-based Karoon Gas Australia Ltd. has been awarded
five contiguous offshore exploration blocks in the Santos basin off
Brazil—the same region as the recent 8 billion bbl Tupi oil discovery (OGJ Online, Nov. 16, 2007).
Karoon said the Brazilian permits are 300 km east-southeast of
Tupi and 100 km from producing Caravela and Coral oil and gas
fields.
The blocks—1037, 1101, 1102, 1165, and 1166—will be officially awarded next March when Karoon pays $25 million in nonrefundable signature bonuses and refundable bid bonds.
Karoon has pledged a work program consisting of geological
analysis along with the reprocessing and interpretation of existing
seismic data. The company must acquire an additional 170-sq-km
3D seismic survey in three of the permits during the first 3 years.

Harvest Resources acquires Gabon block
Harvest Natural Resources Inc., Houston, will operate a block
off Gabon after signing a purchase agreement with Sasol Petroleum
West Africa Ltd. Harvest will gain a 50% interest under the Dussafu
Marin exploration and production-sharing contract.
The PSC contains 680,000 acres that lie in 1-1,000 ft of water.
Harvest Pres. and Chief Executive James A. Edmiston said, “The
Dussafu PSC lies within an active proven hydrocarbon basin containing significant production and infrastructure in contiguous

and geophysical interpretation, and engineering studies, and it will
drill a conditional well. This second exploration phase of the PSC,
which started May 28, is expected to last for 3 years.
The PSC requires approval from the government and the other
coventurers before it is finalized.

Production

Mexico sees 2.1-3.4 million b/d oil output to 2016
Mexico’s ministry of energy has released the country’s oil outlook for 2006-16, providing best-case and worst-case scenarios for
the outlook period, as well as key recommendations for development of state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos.
Under the best-case scenario, Pemex production levels will average some 3.255 million b/d over the period, reaching 3.4 million b/d in 2016. Under the worst case scenario, production will
average 2.5 million b/d during 2006-16 and fall to 2.1 million
b/d by 2016.
According to Energy Minister Georgia Kessel, the best-case scenario will depend on annual investments of some 157 billion pesos
as well as new production from Chicontepec and from Gulf of
Mexico deep water.
However, Kessel said that developing deepwater reserves requires “carrying out works in extremely complex conditions and
above all, a multiplication of Pemex’s operating capacity that would
be impossible under current conditions.”
More broadly, she said, “We should design the technical, legal,
and economic instruments to strengthen Pemex so it can generate
the investments, experience, and employment Mexicans demand.
I’m confident that with the help of our legislators, we’ll find the
solutions.”

White Rose oil field’s southern section is scheduled to go on
stream in late 2009. A 2006 delineation program in the field increased the assessment of White Rose oil field’s reserves by 190
million bbl of oil. The field could contain 40-100 million bbl of
oil, with a likely estimate of 70 million bbl (OGJ Online, Nov. 21,
2006).

Darfur rebels halt 50,000 b/d Defra oil production
Darfur rebels of the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) in
Sudan said they attacked the Defra oil facility in south Kordofan,
halting an estimated 50,000 b/d of oil production.
If confirmed, the refinery closure would be the third assault
since October by JEM rebels against petroleum installations in Kordofan after the group vowed to target Chinese oil firms.
Earlier this month, a rebel attack prompted the Chinese government to call for the safety of its oil workers in the country (OGJ
Online, Dec. 13, 2007). In October JEM rebels said they attacked
the Chinese-run Defra oil field. The rebels accuse China of indirectly funding Khartoum’s war effort in Darfur by investing in Sudan’s
oil industry. The Sudanese government receives large royalties from
estimated production of 500,000 b/d, and JEM says some 70% of
the oil revenue goes to the military.

The Surmont oil sands project in Alberta started commercial
production Dec. 11, said Total E&P Canada Ltd., which owns 50%

Surmont is 60 km southeast of Fort McMurray. Phase 1 has a
capacity of 25,000 b/d, and it is expected to reach plateau production by 2012. Phase 2, scheduled for commercial production

Placid reﬁnery expansion on schedule
Privately owned independent refiner Placid Refining Co. LLC
said its previously announced $300 million project to upgrade and
expand its Port Allen, La., refinery is on schedule for completion
in first-half 2010.
The project will expand the refinery’s crude throughput capac-

ity to 80,000 b/d from 55,000 b/d while cutting total air emissions in half. All existing process units are being expanded and upgraded. In addition, a fluid catalytic cracker gasoline hydrotreater,
sulfur extraction capacity, tankage, and other environmental improvements are being constructed to enable the refinery to meet all
applicable clean fuel standards for its products. The upgrades will
allow the company flexibility to utilize a less-costly, high-sulfur
crude oil mix in its production process, officials said.
Placid currently supplies 35-40% of the gasoline consumed in
the Baton Rouge area. The refinery’s gasoline production will increase to 1.5 million gpd from 1 million gpd when expansion is
completed. Diesel production will increase to 1 million gpd from
750,000 gpd. The 80-acre refinery, purchased in 1975, is Placid’s
only manufacturing facility.

Nicaragua, Esso near oil import storage accord
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said his country is nearing
an agreement with ExxonMobil Corp. subsidiary Esso that would
allow increased oil imports from Venezuela next year. Ortega’s
statement, unconfirmed by ExxonMobil, follows stepped-up pressure on the firm.
Ortega has ordered Energy and Mines Minister Emilio Rappaccioli to “quickly” draft a proposal to nationalize the import of oil,
claiming Esso officials were “acting like true mercenaries, speculators, [and] bleeding the Nicaraguan people.” Ortega alleged that Esso
refused to store the additional supplies of Venezuelan crude. Ortega
wants to increase the amount of oil received from Venezuela by 8
million bbl/year and to begin producing products for export.
However, Nicaragua can store only 2 million bbl. Ortega wants
the additional storage capacity to be provided by Esso which owns
import and storage facilities at Corinto port.
An earlier dispute between the company and the government
over use of the Esso terminal led to a temporary seizure of the
facility in August (OGJ Online, Aug. 23, 2007). The government
returned the terminal after Esso signed a memorandum of understanding with state oil company Petronic granting its shared use.
The increased Venezuelan imports follow an earlier agreement
between Ortega and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez who jointly launched construction in July of a 150,000 b/d refinery at Pie10

Greece proposes Libyan gas pipeline
Greece is interested in having a new gas pipeline from Libya to
the island of Crete, according to media reports. Details have not yet
been released, but the two nations are in consultation regarding the
project. Senior Greek business officials, led by Greek Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Petros Dukas, are visiting Libya to strengthen
relationships on several fronts, including energy, transport, telecoms,
and tourism. Greece is a major consumer of Libyan oil and petroleum products, with trade estimated at about $1.2 billion in 2007.

El Paso plans Ruby natural gas pipeline
El Paso Corp. has filed a federal right-of-way application with
the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management for
its Ruby Pipeline, a 680-mile, 42-in. natural gas transmission line
that will extend from the Opal Hub in Wyoming to the Malin, Ore.,
interconnect near California’s northern border.
The pipeline will have an initial capacity of 1.2 bcfd and will be
expandable to 2 bcfd. On this project, El Paso plans to partner with
the Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. subsidiary Bear Energy LP, Houston.
The Ruby Pipeline is expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2011 subject to regulatory approvals. ✦

More politics, less energy
The US oil and gas industry can find little consolation in last week’s passage of energy legislation
that could have been worse. The Energy Independence and Security Act, passed by the Senate Dec.
13 and the House 5 days later, doesn’t punish the
industry with taxation as originally proposed. As
energy policy, though, it still fails.
The worst recent proposal of a hostile Congress
fell victim to a veto threat. The bill doesn’t raise
taxes on oil and gas to pay for costlier substitutes.
It does, however, sustain the economic poison of
fuel choice by the government. And it promises
more energy supply than it will deliver.

CAFE standards
The bill’s centerpiece is a toughening of standards for vehicle fuel efficiency. In 2020, new
cars and light trucks will have to meet a corporate
average fuel economy (CAFE) standard of 35 mpg,
up from 27.5 mpg for cars and 22.5 mpg for
light trucks. It’s the first change to CAFE standards
since 1985 and the feature to which politicians
will point when they boast about having acted on
energy.
The bill also raises the standard for vehicle
fuels from renewable sources, mainly ethanol in
gasoline. The mandate, now rising annually to 7.5
billion gal/year in 2012, will jump to twice that
level in 2015. By 2022, 36 billion gal/year of
vehicle fuel sold in the US will have to come from
renewable sources, of which more than half must
be “advanced,” such as cellulosic ethanol.
And instead of outlawing “price-gouging,” the
bill makes it “unlawful for any person, directly or
indirectly, to use or employ, in connection with
the purchase or sale of crude oil, gasoline, or petroleum distillates at wholesale, any manipulative
or deceptive device or contrivance, in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Federal
Trade Commission may prescribe as necessary
or appropriate in the public interest or for the
protection of United States citizens.” Whatever this
means, the infraction is subject to a civil penalty of
as much as $1 million/day of violation. The same
penalty applies to the new crime of reporting false
information to a federal agency on the wholesale

prices of crude and products.
The bill won’t cut oil use or lift supply by anywhere near the amounts claimed by its supporters.
The extent to which toughened CAFE standards can lower fuel consumption is a matter of
dispute. According to some economists, lowering
fuel mileage just encourages driving. And market
controls always produce surprises. The first round
of CAFE standards, for example, spawned the
sport utility vehicle. But how much worry about
consequence can anyone expect from a Congress
that stiffens CAFE requirements in a bill that also
extends tax incentives for vehicles able to burn
low-mileage, 85% ethanol blends?
Extension of the renewable-fuel standard is an
attempt to paint over a huge mistake while bailing a coddled industry out of its greedy misery.
Because extravagant ethanol incentives have raised
the price of corn and encouraged construction of
too much distillation capacity, ethanol manufacturers are caught in a margin squeeze. By elevating the mandate, Congress hopes to sop up the
surplus while perpetuating the myth that ethanol
meaningfully extends energy supply at reasonable
cost. In fact, the original ethanol mandate placed a
huge, unfair burden on taxpayers and consumers
of food and fuel while raising the amount of energy needed for the production and transportation
of ethanol. Expanding it even as the costs become
obvious is scandalous.

Prohibiting what?
And what can be the point of the section on
unlawful market activity other than a subtitle,
“Prohibitions on Market Manipulation and False
Information,” that enables politicians to claim to
have prohibited market manipulation? Subjecting wretchedly ambiguous offenses to criminal
prosecution and huge civil penalties might in fact
crimp the information flows on which free markets depend.
In the name of energy policy, Congress again
has indulged base political impulses at the expense
of taxpayers and consumers. When lawmakers
crow about having acted on energy, Americans
should note what they’re paying for food. ✦

Worldwide oil and gas reserves grew
marginally from a year ago, and oil production declined slightly during 2007,
according to Oil & Gas Journal’s annual
survey.
New estimates of worldwide oil
reserves total 1.33 trillion bbl, up 1.1%
from previous estimates (OGJ, Dec. 18,
2006, p. 20). Gas reserves estimates
total 6.185 quadrillion cu ft, nearly
unchanged.

beginning of the year. But total gas

lower.

from the previous report because most
countries do not assess their reserves
annually.

Reserves changes
There were few major changes to individual countries’ oil and gas reserves
reported this year. Most of the adjustments were small and due to production. Reevaluations and economics
22

are also reasons cited for adjustments,
especially in light of higher oil and gas
prices.
The region with the largest percentage addition to reserves is the Western
Hemisphere. The newest estimates of
natural gas reserves in North America
and Latin America climbed a collective 5.3%, while oil reserves estimates
increased 1.6% from a year ago.
Canada’s gas reserves moved slightly
higher, but its oil reserves are now a
bit lower. The country’s conventional
crude and condensate reserves are now
estimated at 5.392 billion bbl, according to the Canadian Association of
Petroleum Producers. The latest estimate
of Canada’s oil sands reserves is 173.2
billion bbl.
The biggest regional decline in
reserves is for Western Europe. Collectively, oil reserves across the region are
estimated 10.5% lower than previously,
and gas reserves estimates are down 5%.
Norway’s oil reserves sank more than
12%.
The UK attributed its 7% decline
in proved oil reserves and 14%
decline in gas reserves to a combination of production during the
year, reserves additions from new
field developments, and reserves
revisions in established fields.
Oil reserves for the Asia-Pacific
region are up almost 3%, primarily
due to upward revisions in Malaysia and Thailand. Malaysia’s reserves
climbed—oil up more than 2% and
gas up more than 1%—as a result
of exploration, Petronas reported.
The newest reserves figures for
Papua New Guinea show large
downward revisions for both oil
and gas. Collectively, gas reserves
for the Asia-Pacific region declined 1%
in spite of increases in Malaysia and
New Zealand.
Total OPEC oil reserves climbed 2.7%
with the addition of Angola this year.
This puts OPEC’s oil reserves at 927.5
billion bbl, accounting for 69.6% of the
world’s oil reserves. The organization’s
gas reserves are now estimated at 3.15
quadrillion cu ft.

Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
Oil and gas executives and consumers often disagree about how US
energy challenges should be resolved,
said results of a survey commissioned
by Deloitte & Touche USA LLP.
For instance, 73% of executives
surveyed had a positive view about industry efforts to solve America’s energy
challenges, while only 12% of the polled
consumers agreed with that view.
International Communications
Research conducted the Deloitte survey
by telephone during October, polling 504 consumers and 200 oil and
gas industry executives. Results were
released Dec. 12 at Deloitte’s annual oil
and gas conference in Houston.
Some 37% of executives saw oil and
gas companies as the best at solving
US energy problems, while 27% of
consumers rated themselves as best at
solving US energy problems.
Each group held venture capitalists
in high regard as energy problem-

26

solvers (21% for consumers and 20%
for industry.) Some 17% of consumers
listed the federal government as the
best energy problem-solver, while 10%
of executives supported that view.
Gary A. Adams, Deloitte’s vice-chairman and US oil and gas leader, said industry needs to become more communicative and collaborative if it is to win
public support and improve alliances
with politicians to develop a coherent,
long-term national energy policy.

Top concerns listed
Executives and consumers agreed
that a top energy-related concern is too
much dependence on oil from places
unfriendly to the US. A total of 29%
of executives and 27% of consumers
cited this as the most critical US energy
issue.
“With the growing trend toward energy resource nationalism, it is easy to
understand the anxiety about being too
reliant on these sources,” Adams said.
“It is a troublesome trend for consumers and industry executives.”

policy, the environment, and climate
change,” he said.

Changing consumption
“Until now, energy has largely been
seen as the domain of giant multinational corporations and of mighty oilproducing nations,” Stanislaw said. “But
because of the convergence of concerns
about climate change and energy security, the picture that has emerged in the
past year is a far more complicated, and
yet more promising, one.”
Venture capitalists have invested in
more than 1,000 start-up companies
focused on clean-tech energy sources
such as biofuels, solar, and wind, he
said.

Consumers and industry executives also were concerned about what
Adams called the lack of a “realistic
energy policy for America.”
“Regrettably, most of our national
efforts to address long-term energy
challenges have been politically inspired, piecemeal, short-term projects,”
Adams said.
Meanwhile, 19% of consumers
reported concern about high gasoline
prices, and 20% of executives reported
angst over diminishing US oil and
gas supplies. But neither issue was a
shared concern.
Of the executives surveyed, 67%
expect oil companies to allocate less
than 20% of capital costs toward alternative energy investments, while 55%
of consumers believe the commitment
will be less than 20% of capital budgets
for companies.
Yet, 72% of consumers expressed a
strong desire for greater investments in
developing alternative energy sources.
Survey participants gave low priority to energy conservation, which was
listed as a concern by 9% of consumers
and 6% of executives.

“Consumer behavior can substantially reduce consumption, thus lessening the need for energy,” he said. “Seen
from this perspective, demand reduction is potentially the largest source of
supply. It is this drive towards efficiency—enabled by end-use technologies
that sip rather than chug energy—that
must be put at the heart of the new
energy era.”
Consumers are paying attention to
how they can consume oil, gas, and
electricity more efficiently, he said.
“Whether driving hybrid cars, diesel
cars, weatherizing homes, or buying
offsets to lighten their carbon footprints, consumers are becoming an
activist force. And this comes with the
realization that their actions are not a
sacrifice,” he said.
Stanislaw believes he sees “the very
beginning of a global race to create
dominant green economies.” Corporations must decide if they want to be

28

seen as friends or foes of the environment.

Changing companies
“Hydrocarbons will continue, of
course, to absorb most of the $500
billion that the world invests each year
in energy,” he said. “They will continue
to define the energy of geopolitics, as
energy superpowers such as Russia flex
their muscles and as the might and
market of China and India grow. And
vast fortunes, both national and individual, will continue to be reaped from
fossil fuels.”
In the future, energy companies will
no longer profit from selling oil and
gas, he said. Instead, the new energy
company will be what he calls a highvalue service company that provides
light, heat, and mobility in the most
environmentally-acceptable way.
He identified five ways in which
corporations will adapt and assist in the

green economy:
• Defining new efficiency technology from energy audits to smart meters
and smart appliances.
• Establishing low-impact production processes to lower environmental
impact. One critical trend involves
building or growing products as close
as possible to the end market to reduce
transportation needs.
• Creating new “eco-chic” products
and services. Companies are working
to create low-energy computers, cars,
and light bulbs. They also are creating
services.
• “Green” their brand. Companies
are cutting their own energy use and
emissions to appeal to consumers and
employees.
• Discovering supply alternatives.
More than 1,000 start-up companies
around the world are trying to devise
new energy supply and new efficiency
technologies. ✦

Regarding refining, he said a trend

Deloitte: NOCs seeking broader services, technology
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
National oil companies are seeking broader service capabilities and
more technology, and this trend could
prompt more consolidation among
service companies, a speaker told the
Deloitte & Touche USA LLP oil and gas
conference Dec. 12.
Chad C. Deaton, chairman and chief
executive officer of Baker Hughes Inc.,
foresees continuing consolidation
within the oil service industry in general. He declined to comment on any
specific deals that Baker Hughes might
be considering.
“Service companies need a strong
balance sheet and the mass to take on
big projects,” Deaton said in response
to questions after his speech to the Deloitte annual conference in Houston.
“More NOCs are acting like IOCs”
[international oil companies], Deaton
said, noting that every NOC must be
handled as a unique, individual customer with its individual level of drilling
expertise.
State-owned oil companies are becoming increasingly important customers for Baker Hughes, Deaton said.

Meanwhile, oil production is becoming
increasingly complex as companies
target more-remote frontier areas and
reach into deeper water.
Farouk Al-Zanki, Kuwait National
Petroleum Co. chairman and managing
director, also confirmed the need for
more drilling and production technology.
“Over the next 5 years, Kuwait will
need to develop more complex reservoirs,” al-Zanki said. Kuwait plans to
invest $64 billion over 14 years on its
upstream efforts, he added.

R&D investment scale needed
Given increasing complex international projects, service companies need
to be large enough that they can afford
to invest heavily in research and development, Deaton said.
The three largest service companies—Schlumberger Ltd., Halliburton,
and Baker Hughes—spend a combined
$1.5 billion/year in research and development, he said.
“The way you differentiate is
through technology and through the
quality of people that you have, and
the footprint that you have around the

world,” Deaton said.
Activities of Russian oil and gas
companies outside Russia are providing
increasing business for Baker Hughes,
Deaton said in response to questions
about Russia.

TNK-BP reorganization
It’s common for Russian oil companies to own their own service divisions
and drilling rigs, said Tim Summers,
TNK-BP chief operating officer.
TNK-BP’s six drilling subsidaries are
being consolidated into one company,
and that process is expected to be finalized by June or July 2008, Summers
said. The process includes an evaluation of whether to spin off the services
company operations.
“I think that (decision) will come in
2008,” Summers said.
When asked what BP has brought to
TNK-BP, Summers listed the integration
of skills and an organizational model
along with technology.
“In Russia, we’re bringing together
reservoir engineers, petroleum engineers, and drillers,” Summers said.
TNK-BP also has clarified its needs
and expectations to contractors, he
said. ✦

such action in 32 years. It makes a major commitment to
homegrown biofuels, sending our energy dollars to the Midwest, not the Middle East. It sets our nation on a new course,
a new direction for energy security,” she said following the
Senate’s vote.
Senate Democrats simultaneously applauded the surviving provisions while criticizing Republicans for opposing
requirements that were deleted. Several leading Republicans
praised Democrats for their willingness to compromise,
while others said the bill would do nothing to increase available energy supplies.

‘Good ﬁrst step’
The senators who chair the two committees that affect oil
and gas most directly said the approved bill was significant
although it fell short of what they wanted. “While it should
have been a better and stronger bill with tax breaks for renewable energy and a requirement for electric utilities to use
more solar, wind, and geothermal energy, it is still a good
first step toward a cleaner future for America,” said Barbara
Boxer (D-Calif.), the Environment and Public Works Committee’s chairwoman.
Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff
Bingaman noted that the bill also would reduce energy consumption by increasing home appliance energy efficiency.
“I’m disappointed that we were not able to move ahead with
a renewable energy standard or provisions to extend and expand the tax incentives for renewable energy production and
energy conservation. I hope in the next session of Congress
we are able to revisit both of these issues and enact legislation,” he said.
Other Senate Democrats were upset that a second vote
to limit debate earlier that day fell one vote short, forcing
removal of the oil and gas tax provisions. “Once again, President Bush and Senate Republicans have chosen to defend oil
company profits instead of standing with consumers and
moving toward a clean energy future. President Bush issued a
veto threat because the energy bill would have eliminated oil
company tax breaks in order to fund wind and other clean
energy sources. Senate Republicans fell in line and blocked
the bill,” said Hillary R. Clinton of New York.
Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) said an earlier veto threat led to
removal of a provision that would have made gasoline pricegouging a federal crime. “Although I’m disappointed we
weren’t able to more completely break away from our overdependence on fossil fuels, this is still the most important,
and greenest, energy bill ever passed by Congress. It bets on
American energy and investment rather than gambling our
future on the good will of [the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries],” she said.
Russell J. Feingold (D-Wis.), while also expressing disappointment that the oil and gas tax and renewable energy
requirement for utilities had to be removed, said the legisla-

Lugar: Energy

T

he winner of the 2008 presidential election will need to take
bold steps to address energy and
climate change problems despite the
absence of substantive discussions
from the current campaigns, said US
Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.) on
Dec. 18. “I would state unequivocally
that energy security and the economic and environmental issues closely
associated with it should be the
most important topics of the 2008
presidential election,” said Lugar, the
Foreign Relations Committee’s ranking minority member, in a speech at
the Brookings Institution.
He said that three factors led him
to this conclusion: Energy is the issue
with the widest gulf between what
is required to make the nation secure
and what is likely to be achieved under existing programs and congressional proposals. Transformational energy policies probably will be needed
to achieve US social and economic
aspirations. And energy exacerbates
almost every foreign policy issue.
“Only the president has the visibility to elevate a cause to national
status, and only the president can
leverage the buying power, regulatory
authority, and legislative leadership
of an administration behind solving
a problem that is highly conducive to
political procrastination and partisanship,” Lugar said.

Ethanol expansion
taxes or tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
The next president also must be
willing to reject subservience to
energy and environmental lobbying
groups without denying ideas they
can contribute, Lugar said.
Specifically, he said, the next president should quickly state that the
federal government will use its power
to make competitively priced biofuels
available nationwide. He or she also
must move beyond the 2007 energy
bill’s higher motor fuel efficiency
standards and use every federal tool,
from research support to market
regulations and incentives, to commercialize plug-in hybrid vehicles.

Coal, nuclear

The next president also must initiate a plan to use US coal resources by
accelerating work on carbon sequestration technologies and address
waste disposal concerns so that providing liability protection and loan
guarantees for new nuclear power
plants can be considered, Lugar said.
That chief executive also will
need to keep bureaucracy or political inertia from delaying initiatives.
Projects related to battery technology,
cellulosic ethanol, carbon capture and
storage, solar and wind power, and
other technologies should receive the
highest priority, he said.

tion’s passage still was a positive step.
“This year’s bill finally moves past the
misguided debates of previous Congresses and the fiscally and environmentally irresponsible proposals that
were considered and passed in recent
years,” he maintained.

Farm state senators applauded the
surviving ethanol mandate expansion. Tim Johnson (D-SD) noted that
it would ensure minimum production
of 15 billion gal/year of ethanol by
2015, essentially doubling the amount
currently produced in the US. “South
Dakota’s ethanol plants will have the capability to produce 1 billion gal of ethanol in 2008, and this bill will ensure a
strong future for renewable energy in
our state,” he said.
“This new legislation will continue
to allow for the growth of ethanol,
while also promoting other biofuels
such as those derived from cellulosic
material. The bill will raise the Renewable Fuel Standard to 36 billion gal by
2022, more than half of which would
have to come from advance biofuels. It
also provides resources for more biofuels research,” said Ben Nelson (D-Neb.).
“This is the most robust renewable
fuels standard we’ve ever had and will
dramatically expand the use of renewable energy and drive the production
and development of cellulosic biofuels. It will give a tremendous boost to
ethanol and biodiesel producers who
have suffered from lower prices,” said
Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa).
Ethanol and agriculture lobbies also
applauded the provision. The National
Petrochemical & Refiners Association
did not. “NPRA continues to oppose
expanding the biofuels mandate, to say
nothing of tying the nation’s energy
future to nonexistent technologies
such as cellulosic ethanol. Both the
Senate and House versions of HR 6 do
very little to increase domestic energy supplies, but they do everything
to choose winners and losers in the
markets, which will ultimately mean

businesses and consumers,” NPRA Pres.
Charles T. Drevna said.

New CAFE requirements
Backers of the higher average motor
vehicle mileage requirement also were
elated. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said
that she and Olympia Snowe (R-Me.)
“fought for 6 long years to get this bill
passed.” Approval would not have been
possible without the efforts of Commerce Committee Chairman Daniel
K. Inouye (D-Hi.) and Vice-Chairman
Ted Stevens (R-Ak.) among others, she
continued.
“I am elated that a strong bipartisan
consensus has agreed that it is time to
move our automobile fleet into the 21st
Century. That both parties would come
together to chart a new energy policy
is a landmark moment for this institution and frankly, with [gasoline] prices
continuing to skyrocket, comes not a
moment too soon,” Snowe said.
“This is the first statutory increase in
fuel economy standards for cars since
1975. Our actions today will improve
national security, create jobs, help consumers and protect the environment.
At times, it is the government’s responsibility to balance conflicting interests.
Today, I believe we found that balance,”
Inouye said.
Stevens said that he became involved
in the automotive mileage issue when
he realized that a combination of initiatives was the only way the US could
achieve energy independence. “Conservation, domestic production and the
development of alternative energy are
part of the broader solution,” he said.
But Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) said
she voted against the final bill because
the deleted provisions also included a
loan program to help automakers retool
plants to meet more aggressive mileage
standards and $1 billion of tax credits
for consumers to buy advanced technology vehicles. “I could not support
a new mandate on our auto industry
without including the critical incentives
and funding support needed to help it
be successful and keep jobs in America,” she said.

Republican reactions
Some Republicans also criticized the
final bill despite the deletion of provisions involving oil and gas taxes and
a renewable energy requirement for
electric utilities. “I simply could not
support an energy bill that will further
drive up the already high price of gaso-

line at the pump or the cost of energy
in our homes,” James M. Inhofe of
Oklahoma, ranking minority member
of the Environment and Public Works
committee, said on Dec. 14. “Absent
from this energy bill are domestic

gas, and clean coal technologies that are

hina’s ambassador to Russia, Liu
Guchang, recently said that there
are broad prospects for cooperation on oil and gas between the two
countries. Sure there are.
“Important progress has been
made in China-Russia energy cooperation, typically in oil and gas sectors, and the modalities of cooperation have become more diversified,”
Liu said.
“There are broad prospects for
energy cooperation between China
and Russia that has been reciprocal,
mutual, beneficial, and marked with
a win-win solution,” he told some 40
representatives from major Russian
and Chinese oil companies, as well as
cultural figures.
Shi Ren, a writer for China’s official Hong Kong Zhongguo Tongxun
She newspaper, has other thoughts

tended to rise in a sustained manner, the Russia side said later that no
big progress will be made in the oil
pipeline between the companies of
the two countries.”
Shi even refers to one Chinese observer who pointed out that the move
made by the Russian side is close to
“hoarding and speculation”—a major crime by Chinese standards.

Pacifying the beast

“However,” Shi says, “in order to
pacify this energy magnate and to
maintain good relations of cooperation in energy, the Chinese side may
give the opposite side appropriate
subsidies.” In plain English, it is
called paying through the nose, and
Shi is well aware of the reasons why.
“Russia is the world’s biggest
country in the production of natural
gas and the second biggest in the
production of oil, while China has
become the world’s second biggest
country in the consumption of energy and the second biggest country
in importing oil,” Shi says.

that is stable, diverse, and affordable,”
he said.
The bill also extends the Federal Unemployment Tax Act surtax on businesses that was first established in 1976 to
repay loans from the federal unemployment tax fund, he said. “Even though
this money was fully repaid in 1987,
Congress has extended this temporary
tax five times, imposing an annual $1.4
billion tax burden on America’s workers
and employers,” he said.
Wayne Allard of Colorado noted the
absence of any provisions aimed at reducing gasoline prices or increasing gas
supplies, but added that the bill extended a number of renewable energy tax
credits. “I am relieved the Democrats
sought compromise, allowing us to pass
a reasonable energy bill,” he said.
Both of Idaho’s senators backed
renewable energy and vehicle mileage
provisions in the bill but opposed the
oil and gas taxes. “This is not an ‘eitheror’ proposition,” said Mike Crapo.
“We must address the growing energy
demand of our country with both a
long-term commitment to promoting
investment in alternative energy sources
such as wind, solar, geothermal and
nuclear power with increased incentives, research and development. However, we must do this while maintaining
strong domestic production of more
traditional energy resources such as oil,
natural gas and coal-based electricity,”
he said.

March 3 – 5, 2008 / Moody Gardens Hotel & Convention Center, Galveston, Texas

SUBSEA TIEBACK
Forum & Exhibition

PennWell invites you back to the 8th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition.
SSTB has become the premier event for one of the fastest growing field
development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March 3 – 5, 2008 in
Galveston, TX at the Moody Gardens Hotel & Conference Center. Over 2,000
people and 150 exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference.You can’t
afford to miss it.
As our industry confronts new challenges, it has never been more important
to submerse yourself in them. This year’s theme is “Subsea is here, the game
is changing.” As our game changes, the sharing of knowledge and collective
experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety,
and economics of the subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by
industry leaders. As in the past, only by participating in this conference will you
be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will not be published and no

THE RETHINKING CONTINUES
By rethinking recovery methods, producers have brought to a hungry market gas from reservoirs
once considered economically and technically impossible. Tight gas sands, shales, and coalbeds
now represent large and growing sources of an essential form of clean energy. But they’re still
unconventional. The reservoirs are complex. The costs of drilling into and completing wells in them
are high and rising. They present unique environmental problems. Producing gas from unconventional
reservoirs proﬁtably, safely, and in amounts demanded by the market requires continuous rethinking the kind of thinking that shoves back limits on what’s possible with gas supply.
Rethinking of recovery methods will continue Sept. 30 - Oct. 2, 2008, at the Unconventional Gas
International Conference & Exhibition at the Hilton Fort Worth in Fort Worth, Texas. Planned by
editors of Oil & Gas Journal and an advisory board of industry experts, the event will highlight
innovation from unconventional gas plays around the world. It will be your chance to meet and
learn from other professionals in the fastest-growing sector of the gas-producing industry.
Don’t miss this opportunity to present your ideas to a powerful, inﬂuential audience. Join PennWell

technologies.
This series began
last week, with an article discussing
advances in fracture stimulation techniques and fluids used to improve tight
gas production (OGJ, Dec. 17, 2007, p.
39).
The final article in this series, to be
published next month, deals with coalbed methane (CBM) production.

Shales
There are technical difficulties in
producing gas from shales, which have
ultralow permeabilities and vary in
brittleness. Multilayered shale reservoirs
have widely varying reservoir characteristics and flow mechanism regimes.
Formations typically have high capillary
pressures in hydraulic fracturing scenarios. Treatment fluids can potentially
damage shale formations.
Multilayered shale reservoirs with a
variety of reservoir characteristics require specialized evaluation and drilling
techniques and “next-well” geological,
seismic, and production comparisons to
identify optimum fracturing targets.
All of these data sources can be fed
into custom models for a potential
well’s production design. Combining
logging systems with next-well and
field-wide properties, geomechanics,
and production performance data forms
the basis of an advanced modeling system. The system is tailored for the specific shale-production mechanism and
composition of the proposed new well’s
drilling and completion design. Placing
the well’s target location is critical and
can be done with economical, simplified, rotary-steerable drilling assemblies
in land-based shale wells.
Determining proper fracture placement within shale formations is a key
to creating large, highly productive

O D U C T I O N

fracture networks. Logging systems use
an innovative approach, incorporating select mechanical rock properties,
geomechanics, total organic content,
and porosity to help locate the best
fracture-initiation points within shale
formations. Microseismic methods
also provide invaluable information on
the depth and width of the multiple
fractures that are created during fracture
stimulation.
Due to shale’s
ultralow permeability,
successful economic
productivity from a
shale reservoir depends on the capability to maximize
formation exposure through horizontal
or vertical drilling and fracturing, or
both.
Economical rotary-steerable drilling
assemblies, high-horsepower fracturing
units, and multifunctional fractureplacement techniques provide maximum and optimized reservoir exposure.
A complex reservoir’s brittleness
must be leveraged through drilling and
fracturing to create as much fracture
face as possible to maximize gas migration from the producing shale. Brittleness can also be leveraged to create
formation exposure through the use
of high-horsepower fracture pumping
units, which have been developed to
provide maximum fracturing horsepower in a reduced environmental
“footprint.”
New designs include increased
horsepower and high-rate pumps and
offer improved safety, performance,
reliability, space utilization, operational efficiency, real-time automation
throughout the entire fracturing system,
and ultimate improved gas recovery.
Multilayer reservoir characteristics
and ultralow formation permeability require precision fracturing of optimum
locations along the wellbore, which has
led to significantly improved production results.
Pinpoint stimulation techniques have
evolved, making shale more profitable
as gas prices cycle. Multiple zones can

A wave-sonic log should be run to
obtain mechanical rock properties.
An EMI (electromagnetic imaging)
tool should be run to obtain natural and
induced fracture direction, followed by
analysis to identify sweet spots and a
fracture-initiation site.
A pulsed spectral gamma (PSG) log
enhances oil recovery by accurately
measuring oil saturations over a wide
range of properties and borehole conditions. The PSG log also aids in clay
typing, which adds to knowledge of the
reservoir and is helpful information for
planning future wells.

Enhancing production
Commercial production from shale
depends largely on the gas content and
natural storage and deliverability of the
rock. The prime goal of stimulation is to
contact and expose the greatest amount
of rock volume and surface area with
the least expensive material; in effect,
“mining” the shale using hydraulic
horsepower and injected water. This
hydraulic mining can turn a well in
nano-Darcy shale into a commercial gas
producer.
Restimulation has proven to increase
recoverable reserves by 50-100%.
Future vertical and horizontal wells
are likely to be completed by selectively treating, isolating, and retreating
unstimulated areas along the vertical or
horizontal wellbore.
Fracturing fluids and reactive fluids
should be designed with knowledge of
the specific shale mineralogy. The overall success of any shale play will include
observation of the resource through its
life cycle.

vertical wells are usually drilled and
completed to help the operator characterize the reservoir. With the experience
gained from drilling, fracturing, and
producing the vertical well, more comprehensive life cycle phases 3 and 4 can
be planned and performed profitably.

Horizontal well stimulation
Current horizontal stimulation designs typically include:
• Two to eight stages/horizontal
wellbore.
• Two to four frac initiation sites/
stage.
• 2-4 ft of perforations/site, with 6
spf, at 60° phasing.
• 20-30 bbl/min per frac site or 2-4
bbl/min per perforation.
• Volume average 1,800 gal/ft.

Horizontal completions

Horizontal well completions can be
one of three types:
1. Cased, cemented, multistage with
composite plugs to separate frac stages.
2. Multistage, with jetted sand and
water delivered by coiled or jointed
tubing to perforate zones.
3. Mechanical bottomhole assembly.
The cased, cemented, multistage
completion with composite plugs is the
most commonly used type of horizontal completion in shale wells. Each
stage is perforated, fracture-stimulated,
and isolated with a packer or bridge
plug, allowing the next stage to be
treated. The plugs and packers act as a
well “bottom” for fracturing pressure
to build up against. This process is the
most time-consuming, due to the cycle

drilling out plugs or packers. Use of

Water fracs produce a complex network of narrow-aperture fractures that
can be either induced from extensive
shear-failures (like shattered safety
glass) or created from dilation of preexisting, incipient fractures or planes
of weakness in the shale. The frac width
must be 1.5± times the maximum
grain diameter of the proppant to provide additional propping of the induced
fractures.
Because the permeability of the
matrix rock is usually ultralow
(0.0001-0.001 md), except possibly
near the wellbore, the fracture conductivity typically does not need to be
high; 20-50 md-ft is sufficient conductivity through the fracture network. The
exception would be with deeper wells
with higher closure pressure and rock
properties that would allow proppant
embedment. In a few cases, we have not
seen much correlation between production and proppant size. Many created
fractures remain open and conductive

hydraulic-fracturing operations. The
low compressive strengths of these cements, however, concern some operators that have long considered compressive strength to be the leading indicator
of cement-sheath integrity in highpressure fracturing conditions.
Foamed cement’s relatively low
compressive strength does not increase the risk for fracture initiation
and propagation in the cement sheath
during hydraulic-fracturing treatments.
Stresses induced in the cement sheath
by increased wellbore pressures during casing-pressure tests or fracture
stimulation treatments are tensile in
nature. The sheath’s capacity to withstand these stresses is predominantly
determined by the cement’s mechanical properties (Young’s modulus and
Poisson’s ratio) and tensile strength.
Cement compressive strength is of
minimal importance.3
The durability of foamed cement
has been demonstrated repeatedly in
Woodford shale hydraulic-fracturing
operations, where foamed cement
outperformed conventional cement
in withstanding high internal casing
pressures and high fluid hydrostatic
pressures.
Two factors explain this performance:
1. Mechanical properties of foamed
48

cement allow it to withstand greater
wellbore pressures than conventional
cement.
2. The ductile nature of foamed cement helps prevent the propagation of
fractures in the cement sheath, helping
ensure continued zonal isolation.
Well-cementing professionals believe
that the ductile properties of the cement
allow it to yield to injection pressure
rather than shattering as is usually
the case in high-density, more brittle
cement. Also, the cement-invasion distance may be less because of improved
fluid loss provided by the nitrogen
bubbles.

Acid-soluble cement
Zonal isolation for limited-entry
stimulation can be provided by acidsoluble cements (ASC).
Because conventional cements have
a low solubility in acid, perforations
can be difficult to break down and can
inhibit fracture initiation and cause
excess tortuosity during stimulation
and production. Successful horizontal,
limited-entry stimulation requires that
all perforations are open and in communication with the formation and the
designed perforation friction controls
the fluid distribution along the wellbore.

Unopened perforations and nearwellbore friction resulting from
tortuosity caused by the conventional
cement can significantly alter the fluid
distribution and decrease stimulation
effectiveness. Conventional high-compressive strength cements with a typical
acid solubility of less than 5% cannot
be reliably removed so that each perforation is openly communicating with
the formation.
Instead, acid-soluble cement can be
used to provide zonal isolation without
impeding stimulation and production.
This type of cement has a fast solubility
rate and is highly soluble (>90%) in
acid-based stimulation fluids. ASC has
physical properties much like conventional cement. It can be specifically formulated to provide the proper weight,
fluid-loss, free water, compressive
strengths, and pump times required for
particular well conditions. Slurry densities and yield ratios can range from
13.0 lb/gal to 15.8 lb/gal and 3.55 cu
ft/sk to 2.00 cu ft/sk, respectively (sk =
sack). ASC can also be foamed if lowerdensity slurries are needed.
The easy removal of ASC material
from the perforation cluster makes it
especially suitable for limited-entry
horizontal applications. The highsolubility allows the development of
a larger communication area in the

annulus immediately adjacent to the
perforations while still providing excellent zonal isolation along the wellbore.
This pocket that is dissolved around the
casing at the clustered perforation point
eliminates the tortuosity and fractureentry pressure effects that could alter
the planned limited-entry fluid distribution. Also, during production, the
skin effects, reduced near-wellbore
conductivity, and perforation-plugging
problems associated with conventional
cements are eliminated.

• Final directional survey.
• Last 3 or 4 days’ drilling-mud
reports.
• Depths and fracture gradients of
lost-circulation zones.
The cementing operation is monitored and controlled by operating
company and service company representatives to maximize opportunities to
make real-time changes to the procedure.

Cement process

In areas where alternatives to foam
cement may be preferred, recent advances in well cementing technology
have made it possible to provide the
option of nonfoamed cements with
the enhanced mechanical properties
and ductility required to cement shale
wells that will be fracture stimulated.
These cements can also be designed to
expand. The required mechanical modification additives can be dry-blended
with cement and mixed and pumped in
the field using conventional equipment.
In practice, combinations of salts in
cements and spacers and sodium silicates in preflushes in cementing fluids
have provided a simple and proven
means for managing shale instability
during the cementing process when
shale instability is considered to be an
issue. ✦

The following well information is
used to support an initial design for the
foam-cementing process:
• Operator well plan for casing
strings, drillbit sizes, casing sizes,
drilling mud systems, and if the well
is horizontal, a proposed directional
survey.
• Depths and thickness of potential
productive intervals and the fracture
gradients and pore pressures of these
intervals.
• Depths, thicknesses, and fracture
gradients of potential lost-circulation
intervals.
• Desired top of cement.
Design software aids in developing a
cementing process tailored for the well,
and the recommended cement slurries
are laboratory tested for performance.
During drilling, the cementing program is updated to reflect the influence
of events that were not expected, for
example, encountering an unanticipated
pressure zone.
When well total depth is reached,
initial well information is confirmed,
drilling-mud reports are consulted, and
drilling-mud and mixing-water samples
are collected to be tested for compatibility with spacers.
Updated wellbore information is
entered into the planning program
to develop a final cementing-process
design. Several aspects of the design are
updated in the software program:
• Total depth.
• Casing depths.
• Size and grade of casing.

Worldwide in 2007, the number of
refineries remained stable, while global
capacity increased slightly. For the sixth
year in a row, worldwide capacity is at a
record level.
Last year’s refining report showed a
worldwide capacity of 85.179 million b/cd in 658 refineries as of Jan. 1,
2007. This year, OGJ’s survey reflects a
total capacity of 85.309 million b/cd in
657 refineries, an increase of slightly more
than 129,000 b/cd.
The increase is more
than double last year’s
gain of 52,000 b/cd.
Fig. 1 shows the
trend in operable refineries and worldwide capacity. The large
jump in number of refineries in 1999
was due to improved information from
China.
Expansions and capacity creep that
offset losses were the main reasons for
the increases in capacity for the latest
survey.

latest survey numbers, decreasing about
96,000 b/cd and 13,000 b/cd, respectively.
The Middle East and South America
were essentially unchanged, losing
1,900 b/cd and gaining 200 b/cd of
capacity, respectively.

New crude capacity
This year’s survey does not list any
new refineries. All the increases in
refining capacity occurred in existing
facilities.
The largest single-facility increase
occurred in Rosneft’s Syzran, Russia,
refinery. The company reported a capacity of 214,000 b/cd, up from 151,460
b/cd, which was the capacity listed in
last year’s survey. The refinery was previously owned by OAO Yukos and was
acquired by Rosneft in May 2007 in an
auction.
In the US, the largest reported capacity increase occurred in Flint Hills

No refineries shut down in 2007,
mainly due to high refining margins
that made even the smallest plants
profitable.
The only closure reported in this
year’s survey is Petro-Canada’s 83,000
b/cd Oakville, Ont., refinery. The company reported that the plant had ceased
operations in 2003, but the shutdown
was not reflected in the survey until this

Corp. The deal was completed on May
11 for a purchase price of $1.76 billion, which included $213 million for
estimated inventories.
On Jan. 3, 2007, ConocoPhillips and
EnCana Corp. entered into a joint ven54

ture named WRB Refining LLC, which
involved the Borger, Tex., and Wood
River, Ill., refineries. The two refineries
have a combined capacity of 452,000
b/cd of capacity.
The transfer of capacity to EnCana

was enough to move ConocoPhillips
down one spot in Table 1. EnCana now
appears in Table 2 with a capacity of
226,000 b/cd.
Valero Energy Corp. fell two spots in
Table 1 because it sold its Lima, Ohio,
refinery to Husky Energy Inc. Finalized
on July 1, 2007, the deal transferred
ownership of the 161,500-b/cd refinery for $1.9 billion.
EnCana and Husky are, respectively,
the second and third Canadian firms
to merge unconventional crude with
US-based refining capacity. The first was
Suncor Energy Inc.
On Oct. 2, the US Federal Trade
Commission ended its administrative action against the merger of Giant
Industries Inc. and Western Refining
Inc. The two refiners had announced the
merger on Aug. 28, 2006, and completed it on May 31, 2007, creating a
company with just more than 200,000
b/cd of refining capacity.
In March 2007, BP bought out
Chevron Corp.’s 31% interest in the
392,000-b/cd Nerefco refinery. BP
is the sole owner and operator in the
refinery after completing the $900-million deal.
In July 2007, Basell announced it
was merging with Lyondell Chemical Co. for about $12 billion. The deal
includes Lyondell’s 282,600-b/cd refinery in Houston. The new company will
be named LyondellBasell Industries.
Lyondell anticipates the closing of
the transaction on or about Dec. 20,
2007. The transaction will therefore be
reflected in next year’s survey.
In one of the largest deals of the year,
Rosneft significantly expanded its refining assets by purchasing five Russian
oil refineries at the auctions held as part
of the OAO Yukos bankruptcy proceedings. Rosneft purchased Kuibyshev,
Novokuibyshev, and Syzran refineries
in the Samara Region, and the Achinsk
refinery and Angarsk petrochemical
company in Eastern Siberia.
At the beginning of 2007, Rosneft
owned two oil refineries in Komsomolsk and Tuapse. The company now owns
about 1.29 million b/cd of refining

Experience to date
with US offshore LNG
projects teaches critical lessons and offers
many clues for where the
offshore LNG market is
LNG
heading. And nowhere
is that experience more
vivid than in the files of the LNG Deepwater Ports Program at the Maritime
Administration
of the US Department of Transportation.
As the federal
agency responsible for permitting offshore
facilities, MARAD’s looking glass offers
one of the best predictors for how current and future proposals will shake
out. The rest will be up to the marketplace (Fig. 1).
Over the past 4 years, commercial,
environmental, and political factors have fundamentally shaped how
projects are designed, as well as where
terminals should be located to have the
best opportunities for success.
What emerges is a shift from large,
permanent or fixed designs that aim to

emulate onshore facilities to smaller,
more flexible and environmentally
friendly designs that target markets
where onshore facilities would be difficult, if not impossible to build.
A tale of two coasts sheds light on
the current and future state of offshore
LNG terminal siting in the US.
When Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger
in May 2007 denied BHP Billiton’s application to construct a massive floating
LNG terminal off California, he brought
to an end more than 3 years of comprehensive federal and state review and
extensive efforts by BHP to pursue the
project.
The terminal, proposed for siting
off Malibu, was heavily lobbied for by
the Australian government on behalf of
BHP and fiercely opposed by environmental interest groups, as well as several
notable (and vocal) celebrities, worried
about increased air and water pollution,
the dangers of LNG fires, and a host of
other issues.
Several months back, on the US East
Coast, two offshore LNG projects met
with a different fate. On Dec. 26, 2006,

Offshore realities
All things being equal, onshore
terminals have advantages over current
offshore designs. Onshore terminals
have robust gas storage capabilities, use
proven technologies, and have seamless
compatibility with conventional LNG
carriers. Many current offshore proposals, in contrast, offer no storage, rely on
new technologies, and in some cases
require use of specialized LNG vessels.
But offshore terminals, despite their
current limitations, offer one crucial
advantage over their onshore counterparts: They offer siting options in markets where onshore terminals may face
insurmountable hurdles. This enables
offshore terminals to target markets
where new onshore facilities will not
likely appear, including densely populated urban areas where safety concerns
are high and real estate is limited.
This emerging trend, even reality,
for offshore terminals to target niche
markets is a departure from many of the
original LNG projects that were planned
for the US.

Big footprints
In 2002, following amendment of
the Deepwater Port Act to include natural gas terminals, the first wave of project proposals were for facilities in the
Gulf Coast that were designed primarily
around the use of large gravity-based
structures—“Texas Towers,” in oil and
gas parlance. The projects were designed
to compete effectively with onshore facilities, with features including gas storage and the ability to accept shipments
from conventional LNG carriers.
None of the proposed Texas Towers,
it now appears, will likely be constructed in the gulf (Fig. 1). Their designs are
capital intensive, with construction cost
estimates that escalated significantly
over time. In the case of Chevron’s Port
Pelican project, approved in 2004 by
MARAD for siting 40 miles off Louisiana, cost estimates rose to well more
than $1 billion from $700 million.
Despite having the necessary approvals
to proceed, Chevron suspended work
and wrote off tens of millions in project

Pass Energy Hub terminal.
Despite significant outreach efforts
by Freeport-McMoRan and nods from
MARAD, the Coast Guard, and EPA
regarding open-loop technology, Gov.
Kathleen Blanco (D-La.), under considerable public pressure, vetoed the Main
Pass project on May 5, 2006, stating
that she would “oppose the licensing of
offshore LNG terminals that will use the
open-rack vaporizer system.”
Within the same month, FreeportMcMoRan, aggressively seeking project
approval, amended its application to
use a closed-loop regasification system.
Closed-loop systems burn a portion of
gas cargo to provide the heat source for
regasification. The technology has minimal impact on marine life but increases
air emissions from gas combustion. This
move by Freeport ultimately paid off,
as Gov. Blanco approved the redesigned
facility on Nov. 20, 2006.
Blanco’s veto had a cascading effect. Seeing the line drawn in the
sand, ConocoPhillps withdrew its two
pending Gulf Coast open-loop applications in the face of certain veto by Gov.
Blanco and a likely veto by Gov. Bob
Riley (R-Ala.).
The open-loop controversy is now
in its last embers, as only one remaining facility—Torp Technology’s Bienville
Offshore Energy Terminal—proposes to
use open-loop technology.
While the two recently approved
Boston area terminals will use closedloop systems, the State of California has
not embraced the technology due to
air emissions issues. As a result, several
California projects have proposed new
technologies that focus on minimizing
air emissions.
Clearwater Port and Woodside Natural Gas plan to use ambient air systems,
which use forced air as the heat source
for regasification. Also, Esperanza Energy is currently developing a wasteheat-recovery system that would utilize
water discharges piped from a nearby
power plant to provide heat for regasification.
The regasification battles demonstrate, first, the power of the governor’s

veto to force projects to use more environmentally benign technologies. Secondly, and more importantly, they show
that through innovation and flexibility
on the part of developers, offshore terminals can be designed and configured
to overcome environmental and other
hurdles to gain regulatory approval.

Future
To increase the potential of offshore
projects, developers must continue to
push the envelope to refine project
designs to overcome the commercial
limitations and environmental concerns
that are associated with many offshore
proposals. Recent progress has been
made, for instance, in pioneering shipto-ship transfer technology that will
enable regasification vessels to connect
with conventional LNG carriers to offload cargo, expanding the universe of
vessels that can call at such terminals.
While many of the current offshore
project proposals, which utilize small
environmental footprints and increasingly green technologies, have the
potential to gain approval from local
communities, regulators, and politicians, obstacles remain. If they can be
overcome, this next wave of offshore
terminals may open the door for LNG
to serve commercially lucrative markets
in the US. ✦

work is required to protect the system from virus attacks, unauthorized
personnel access, and version incompatibility.

System connectivity
Engineers began SIMVO development by programming each remote
work station with LabVIEW software,
standardizing the monitoring architecture. Each of the 12 work stations runs
different object-linking and embedding for its process control server,
depending on the connected device.
Devices include the ROC 364 remote
terminal unit (RTU), Omni 6000, and
Daniel 2500 flow computers; Bristol
DPC 3330 controllers; and a Foxboro
I/A Series distributed control system.
Engineers also used the OPC server to
communicate to a Siemens Simatic S5
PLC controlling substation pumps and
separators for in-line flow separation of
oil and water.
Engineers then used a CP5613 Ethernet to PROFIBUS gateway from Siemens
to interface to 12 RTUs and communicate through OPC servers to the

software’s data logging and supervisory
control module. PEP created a uniform
monitoring system despite each of
the 12 substations having a different
hydraulic design.

Supervisory application
PEP developed a DSC module application for each station displaying both
real-time values and historical trends
of the variables. Connecting these data
to the PEP intranet allowed publishing variables on the network through
the software’s DSC module tag engine.
The PEP application relied on several
communication protocols, including
OPC, RS-232 custom serial drivers, and
DCOMM.

• Graphical development environment.
• Built-in, open communications for e-mail
alarms, report generation,
and logging.
PEP used the software
and its DSC module to
implement an OPC server
and client for communication with different field
measurement devices
and between monitoring
stations. It reused existing
infrastructure and connected to other PEMEX
systems by using Ethernet
between the substations,
user interfaces, and enterprise systems.
The software’s graphical environment made it
easy to design and implement SIMVO in less than
3 months. Developing the
project in house kept it
under budget.

Application architecture
PEP developed the main SIMVO station to monitor all operating variables:
more than 3,000 tags from the 12 local
stations. The main station provides data
logging to a Citadel database and visualization of historical values through
graphs. PEP used the selected software
environment to add integration to
enterprise databases and automatically
generate e-mail alarms and events.

The annual International Petroleum Encyclopedia (IPE) 2007 has been the
premier resource for the petroleum and energy industries worldwide for four
decades. The 40th Anniversary Edition features new articles, new statistics,
and new and up-to-date maps.

· Bonus wall map of the Western Hemisphere Arctic Region, showing
activity, infrastructure, and exploration potential in Alaska, Northern
Canada, and Greenland.

· Atlas country reports on 118 nations, including new entries for Cambodia,

for data collection and reporting. The
new system achieves the same ends
using three to five people monitoring
the automatic system and managing
maintenance schedules and alarms.
The system measures temperatures,
pressure, and inventory levels at 05:00
daily, calculates on-hand crude inventory, and transfers the data to the central
office.
PEP used OPC and DCOMM encryption to protect the system from virus
attacks and unauthorized access.
The first deployment phase to the
12 substations yielded several benefits.
Real-time data from distributed measurement devices helped management
make quicker decisions. Having all
information centralized in a computerized format improved communication
between the different supply and distribution centers.
Daily reports resulted in definable
business improvements. A measurement
error as low as 1% using the previous
system represented a daily potential
miscalculation of $1 million of crude
oil inventory.

Future plans
Based on results since the firstquarter 2006 connection of the first
12 substations, PEMEX has decided to
add more stations to the monitoring
network and extend it to areas such as
gas distribution. ✦

Uganda, and Nicaragua, and more.

· Key statistics for the year’s most important energy trends, including:
-

Future energy supply.
Reserves and production.
Drilling and exploration.
LNG industry outlook, liquefaction
and receiving, carrier ﬂeet, risks
and opportunities.

-

Investment and markets.
Trade and tankers.
Reﬁning and products.
Gas processing & products.
Petrochemicals outlook.

· Statistics from the Oil & Gas Journal and BP Statistical Review of
World Energy 2006, as well as the US Energy Information Administration,
including data for:
- Oil and natural gas production, consumption, imports/exports, and prices.
- Oil reﬁneries, capacities, margins, and throughput.

· Chronology of events.

of 3⁄4 in. to 31⁄2 in.
The jet pump assembly includes this
unit interposed between a tubing string
and a packer. It requires a fluid separator
and compressor for complete operation.
In operation, compressed gas is injected
into the annulus formed between the casing and the tubing string. The compressed
gas forces the hydrostatic column of fluid
above the packer through the angled inlet
ports of the pump. It is forced into the
upper tubular end and the tubing string
where the compressed gas mixes with
the production fluid that has been pulled
up through the production ports by the
compressed gas.
The mixed fluids travel up the tubing string to the surface. At the surface,
the fluid exits the tubing string and is

sembly reaches a breakover point, creating
suction on the wellbore. In general, 0.5 lb

of pressure per foot of fluid column to be
lifted is required. Once breakover point
is achieved, the discharge line pressure
generally drops to 125-150 psi of working
pressure. Tex-Jet works in a range of depths
of wells, straight wells, or deviated wells
and is tolerant of sand, fines, and scale.

New line of enclosures for oil ﬁeld operations
A new line of rugged enclosures is engineered for applications such as monitoring drilling rigs, compiling and processing
seismic data, and maintaining pipelines.
Shielded from extreme conditions in
temperature, contaminants, moisture, vibration, and radiated or emitted electrical
noise, the enclosures help ensure that critical computing applications operate reliably,
with minimum repairs and downtime, the
company notes.

CONDENSATE EAST OF SUEZ:
NGL and its Naphtha Impacts in
Asia Pacific and Mideast Gulf
Condensate and the Light-End Products Squeeze
By Asia Paciﬁc Energy Consulting

• This is the “deﬁnitive” report on
condensate in the fastest growing,
critical regions of the world, Asia
Paciﬁc and the Mideast Gulf.

Condensate coming into its own
Condensate, one of the two groups
deﬁned as Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs),
is ﬁnally coming of age in world trade,
marketing, reﬁning and petrochemicals. Condensate sales are moving
from a niche marketing specialty to
a mainstream segment of crude and
products trade, and nowhere is this
more evident than in the Mideast Gulf
and Asia Paciﬁc.
This report explains how the protean
nature of condensate allows it to be
used in a wide range of sectors: as a
reﬁnery slate component; in specialized distillation towers called condensate splitters; in direct feed to ethylene crackers; in gasoline blending and
as a substitute for gas in turbine power generation. It can be deﬁned as a
base material, a blending component,
a feedstock or a boiler feed.

Some dislike oil
companies; some
just dislike oil
While battling recently against misguided energy legislation, a veteran oil and gas
industry representative observed, “They’re
trying to put us out of business.”
Although the industry dodged the
worst of what its opponents in Congress
proposed in the latest ﬁght, it remains a
popular target for political punishment.
Oil companies and the associations that
represent them in Washington, DC, need to

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

give systematic thought to repeated efforts
to put them out of business.
It’s not enough to whine about being
misunderstood. It’s not enough to think
public education alone will solve the problem. Attitudes must be changed. The job is
difﬁcult.
It can be useful to start by distinguishing
between two factors of antagonism toward
the oil and gas industry: Some people dislike oil companies. Some people just dislike
oil.
Among people who dislike oil companies are those who hate corporations, especially large ones, in general. Antagonism
from this group is constant, but the group
itself probably isn’t large.
In a much larger group are the people
who dislike oil companies when prices of
oil products are high and when, therefore,
oil-company proﬁts also are high. Antagonism from this group subsides when oil
prices fall.
Oil companies should ﬁnd ways to turn
the cyclicality of this source of antagonism
to its advantage. It should at least expect
trouble from the public and politicians
when oil prices jump and act preemptively
with its public relations and advertising.
People who just dislike oil are, like
corporation-haters, a constant source of antagonism. Most are environmental activists.
Without blushing, they will argue against
oil and gas leasing of federal land because
the activity might lead to the burning of
hydrocarbons.
Many oil haters probably are corporation haters, too. Both groups are beyond
enlightenment.
The remaining group, though, deserves
attention. It encompasses haters of oil
companies who do not also hate oil as a
substance or corporations in general.
The hatred of these people correlates
with oil prices and oil-company proﬁts and
therefore, unlike that of the other group,
can be dealt with if the industry will make
the effort.

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

Economic factors whiplash energy prices
The January crude contract for US light, sweet crudes climbed to $94.85/bbl Dec.
12 on the New York Mercantile Exchange before closing at $94.39/bbl, up $4.37 in the
biggest 1-day gain since Jan. 30 and the highest closing since Nov. 27, after the US
Federal Reserve said it would make $24 billion available to European central banks
to spur economic growth.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the world’s largest securities ﬁrm, raised its 2008 oil
price prediction to $95/bbl from $85/bbl for benchmark US crude and predicted crude
may hit $105/bbl before 2009. Analysts ﬁgure higher investment costs and weaker
demand will cause producers to curtail supply.
However, the January NYMEX contract fell to $92.25/bbl Dec. 13 then slipped to
$91.27/bbl Dec. 14 in a combination of proﬁt-taking and renewed concern about an
economic slowdown.
The Department of Labor said US consumer prices jumped 0.8% in November,
the biggest increase in more than 2 years driven by higher energy costs. Meanwhile, the US dollar rose to a 7-week high Dec. 14 after earlier plumbing record lows
against other key currencies. As a result, crude is not only challenging gold as a
ﬁnancial hedge against inﬂation but is now also challenging it as a hedge against the
dollar’s weakness, said analysts with the Societe Generale Group in Paris.
Financial market outlook
“Historically, the correlation between the oil price and the US dollar has always
been weak,” SGG reported in its December commodities review. However, it said,
“Since the start of 2007, this correlation, and more precisely the euro and US dollar
vs. the oil price, has increased to reach a record high recently. While a weakening
of the US dollar gives a natural incentive to European and Asian oil consumers to
hedge more to capture this foreign exchange effect, we are convinced that this traditional relationship does not sufﬁce to explain the recent surge in the correlation.”
The foreign exchange (forex) market for international currencies is the largest
ﬁnancial market in the world, trading more than $3 trillion/day. The higher the price
of oil, the more US dollar reserves are accumulated by central banks and sovereign
wealth funds that manage national investments of oil exporting countries. A weak
dollar gives foreign oil-producing countries more incentive to exchange it for other
currencies to diversify their exposure in both forex reserves and investments.
But now that the correlation has become so obvious, SGG analysts said, “The
causality may have been reversed for the last few months, with some investors
trading it exactly the same way they have traded the gold and dollar correlation.”
They said. “While gold has conﬁrmed its status as the best hedge against US dollar depreciation, it is facing stiff competition as the best hedge against inﬂationary
pressure. This results from the perception that the current inﬂation trend is fueled by
commodity price increases, in particular energy and food prices. This would explain
why gold, oil, and grains have performed so well since October while base metals,
US natural gas, and other soft commodities have underperformed.”
SGG “does not expect the subprime crisis fears to recede signiﬁcantly before the
second half of 2008, opening then the door to rate hikes on both sides of the Atlantic. Not only should this return to more restrictive monetary policies temper inﬂation pressures but it should also trigger a trend reversal in the US dollar. In short,
the ﬁnancial outlook is expected to remain favorable for commodities until the third
quarter of 2008, which partly explains our more pronounced bearish price forecasts
for the second half.”
SGG analysts foresee a slight decrease in oil demand within the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development, with growth coming primarily from China
and the Middle East. The increase in the marginal cost of crude production has been
“spectacular over the last 5 years” but should moderate over the next 5 as shortages of staff and equipment ease. Analysts at SGG said, “The key feature for 2008
should be the strengthening of the linkage between the US and European natural
gas markets. Indeed, while LNG still represents a small component of US supply, it is
about to represent the marginal molecule driving the price discovery mechanism on
both sides of the Atlantic. However, US natural gas is potentially the commodity that
could suffer the most from the subprime crisis and its impact on the US economy,
and we therefore see Henry Hub, Okla., [gas spot market] prices averaging the same
level as in 2007 ($7.10/MMbtu).”

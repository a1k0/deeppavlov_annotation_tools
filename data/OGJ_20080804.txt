GE
Oil & Gas

Depth:
it’s genetic

It starts with the right people and it ends with the
right solution. GE’s people have been pushing offshore
and subsea technology boundaries for more than
50 years. We have a long line of industry milestones,
including more than a decade of design and operational
experience with Troll C, the ﬁrst commercially scaled
pilot subsea separation system, and the Ormen Lange
subsea compressor designed for reliable unattended
operation 900 m below sea level, with power up to
20 MW. We continue investing heavily to further advance
technologies for subsea applications, providing one
seamless package for separation, power, boosting,
compression and controls. This strategy helped set the
current world record for water depth drilling (3,051 m)
achieved using a combination of our VetcoGray and
Hydril Pressure Control technologies. To some, deep
water is an obstacle. To us, it’s an opportunity.
Technological depth – it’s in our DNA.

Dutch fund charged with US futures control
The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on
July 24 charged a global proprietary trading fund based in the
Netherlands, two of its subsidiaries, and three employees with manipulating and attempting to manipulate US petroleum commodities markets.
Optiver Holding BV; subsidiaries Optiver US LLC and Optiver
VOF; and employees Christopher Dowson, Optiver US’s head trader; Randal Meijer, trading head and supervisor at Optiver US and
Optiver VOF; and Bastiaan van Kempen, Optiver US’s chief executive, were named in the CFTC’s civil complaint filed in US District
Court for New York’s southern district.
They were charged with allegedly trying 19 times to manipulate light, sweet crude, New York Harbor heating oil, and New York
Harbor gasoline futures contracts, which trade on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
The attempts were made during 11 days in March 2007, CFTC
said. In at least five of the attempts, the defendants successfully manipulated energy futures contracts and created artificial prices, the
federal commodities trading regulator continued. Futures prices
were forced lower in three instances and higher in two instances,
it said.
The scheme produced about a $1 million profit for the defendants, the complaint said. It said the defendants allegedly used a
manipulative scheme commonly known as “banging” or “marking” the close, which involves acquiring a substantial position
leading up to the closing period followed by offsetting the position
before trading closes.
The complaint also charges Optiver and Van Kempen with concealing the scheme and making false statements in response to a
NYMEX inquiry, CFTC said.
“These charges go to the heart of the CFTC’s core mission of detecting and rooting out illegal manipulation of the markets,” said
CFTC Acting Chairman Walter L. Lukken. “Although this alleged
energy trading scheme lasted only several days in March 2007,
even short-term distortions of prices will not be tolerated by the
commission.”
The UK Financial Services Authority and NYMEX assisted CFTC
in its investigation, he added.

Chavez: IOCs must transfer technology with pacts
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, renewing concerns about
an old theme, said his country will stop doing business with international oil companies (IOCs) that fail to transfer technology as
part of their contracts.
“The order I’m giving is the following: Any foreign company

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

that doesn’t transfer technology, well, their contracts will be canceled. We’ll get others that want to be here,” Chavez said on Venezuelan national television.
The issue of technology transfer is a sore one with the Venezuelan president as well as with IOCs themselves.
Last October ExxonMobil Corp. and ConocoPhillips, under
pressure from the government, withdrew from Venezuela, leaving
behind their right to produce oil as well as technology and infrastructure that could be used by their competitors.
Technology for advanced well drilling, upgrading oil quality,
and prevention of accidents could fall into the hands of companies,
such as state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), that do
not have the technical expertise to extract reserves with the same
efficiency as the two US firms.
The future remains unclear as to the status and use of the leftbehind technology, but it could prompt a legal challenge from the
two companies.
Earlier in 2007, Chavez blamed former directors of PDVSA for
allowing transnational companies to extract oil from the country
without investing in new technology.
“The transnational companies did not uphold their agreements.
They extracted a billion barrels of oil without investing in technology to produce heavy crude,” Chavez said in his weekly Alo
Presidente talk show.
Chavez said the former PDVSA directors who signed agreements
with transnational companies during the period between 1958
and Chavez’s first election in 1998 should be taken to court.
“It was authorized robbery,” Chavez said.

Neptune TLP resumes full oil production
Full oil production has been restored on the Neptune tension
leg platform in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, BHP Billiton Ltd.
said.
BHP and its partners recently completed remediation work to
strengthen components inside the hull’s pontoons (OGJ, July 14,
2008, Newsletter).
Production began July 6. As of July 25, Neptune had five of six
wells on line, and its oil production was at full design capacity of
50,000 b/d.
Natural gas production continues to ramp up to its design capacity of 50 MMcfd of gas.
The TLP stands in 4,250 ft of water on Green Canyon Block
613, which is 120 miles off Louisiana. Field development includes six subsea wells. More development wells are expected to
be drilled after interpretation of seismic data, being obtained this
year. ✦

Development

Sonangol OKs developments on Block 31
Angola’s position as Africa’s leading oil exporter is set to rise as
new offshore deepwater discoveries on Block 31 are brought on
stream by 2011.
Angola’s state oil company Sonangol has given operator BP Exploration (Angola) Ltd. and its partners the nod to develop Pluto,
Saturn, Venus, and Mars (PSVM) fields, which lie in the northeast
part of the block.
Development is expected to start this year and oil production is
expected to peak to 150,000 b/d by 2012. The fields lie in 2,000
m of water and are 400 km northwest of Luanda.
The PSVM field development will comprise a converted-hull
floating, production, storage, and offloading vessel with 1.6 million bbl of storage capacity; 48 production, gas, and water-injection
wells plus infill wells; 15 manifolds and associated subsea equipment; 170 km of flowlines; and 95 km of control umbilicals.
Sonangol’s approval is key for BP’s production profile into the
next decade and beyond. Andy Inglis, chief executive of BP exploration and production, said, “It demonstrates the scale of the
resource base in Block 31.”
So far the consortium has discovered 15 fields on the acreage
to date and it will develop the others in a similar manner to the
PSVM group of fields. The partners have begun to plan the second
development in the southeast part of the block. They are also ready
to award major contracts for the first phase once it has been sanctioned.
BP holds a 26.67% interest in Block 31. Partners are Esso Exploration & Production Angola (Block 31) Ltd. 25%, Sonangol EP
20%, Statoil Angola AS 13.33%, Marathon International Petroleum
Angola Block 31 Ltd. 10%, and TEPA (Block 31) Ltd. with 5%.

Santos JV makes gas ﬁnd with Netherby well

Melbourne-based BHP Billiton Pty. Ltd. has given the green light
to development of Turrum oil and gas field, which lies in the Bass
Strait production area off southeast Victoria.
BHP holds a 50% share in the project, which is operated by fellow 50% interest-holder ExxonMobil Corp. BHP has now approved
funding for its share of the $1.25 billion full field development.
Production will be channeled through the partnership’s existing
Gippsland facilities, which comprise offshore pipelines extending
to the onshore production facilities at Longford.
BHP says the new facilities for Turrum will consist of a new
platform, designated Marlin B, which will be linked by a bridge to
8

a total depth of 1,870 m, will now be assessed with wireline logs
and a pressure-testing program.
Netherby is the second of three planned appraisal and development wells in this sector of the permit in which it is hoped to add
reserves to the planned Henry field gas development as an adjunct
to the existing Casino field production facilities.
Netherby-1 lies 4 km north of Henry. If the coming tests are
successful, Santos plans an immediate sidetrack well to fully determine the reserves before moving the rig to the planned Henry-2
appraisal.
Operator Santos, Adelaide, has 50% interest in the project with
AWE and Mitsui each having 25%.
In related news, Santos has appointed acting Chief Executive
Officer David Knox as permanent chief executive of the company
(OGJ Online, July 29, 2008).

Coogee behind with Montara development
Coogee Resources Ltd., Perth, is about 4 months behind schedule with its Montara oil development project in the Timor Sea. The
project is now expected to come on stream by yearend.
One reason behind the delay, the company reported, is a labor shortage in Singapore, where the project’s floating production,
storage, and offloading vessel is being converted at Jurong Shipyard.
However China’s Chiwan Schenzen Engineering had delivered
the wellhead platform jacket on time and budget, and Clough Thailand is currently loading out the topsides.
Phase 1 of the Montara development includes production from
four wells: two on Skua field (previously produced by BHP Petroleum, but abandoned in 1997) and one well each in Swift and
Swallow fields. Phase 2, to be completed in 2009, includes two
wells at Montara field itself and one more at Swift.
In addition, Coogee has completed feasibility studies into the
potential commercialization of the smaller gas fields surrounding
Montara, Jabiru, and Challis, and expects preliminary front-end engineering and design work to begin into on methanol production
option during the third quarter. FEED itself is planned for 2009.
The company also is considering CNG and LNG options for
these fields with potential partners. ✦

the existing Marlin A platform. Since it is one of the original steel
structures in the Bass Strait, the Marlin A platform will require an
upgrade to accommodate the bridge as well as new equipment.
Turrum is scheduled to come on stream in 2011. For the first 4
years the oil and condensate will be stripped from the production
stream and the gas reinjected into the reservoir. Commercial gas
sales are expected to begin in 2015 at a rate of 200 MMcfd of gas.
Turrum, which was discovered in the 1970s, lies 42 km offshore in 60 m of water. Reserves are estimated to be 1 tcf of gas and
110 million bbl of oil and condensate.
ExxonMobil says the field will be a key contributor to the estimated 7 tcf of remaining known gas reserves in the Bass Strait—a

Agip lets contract for Oyo ﬁeld off Nigeria

IOCs can begin drilling in Chile, minister says

Agip Exploration Ltd. has let a €75 million turnkey contract to
Technip SA to design and produce the subsea system for Oyo oil
field on Block OML 120/121 off Nigeria.
Technip’s contract covers the engineering, fabrication, and installation of close to 20 km of flexible production, water injection,
and gas injection flowlines and risers. It will also install 15 km of
umbilicals supplied by Agip.
“The offshore installation is scheduled for the summer of 2009
and will be carried out by the Constructor, one of the Technip’s
pipelay and construction vessels,” Technip said.
Oyo, which lies in 410 m of water, is expected to start production in 2009 and will produce 29,000 boe/d at its peak.

Chilean Mining Minister Santiago Gonzales said international
oil companies (IOCs) that won bids to explore for oil and natural gas in the southernmost regions of Chile can begin drilling in
August.
“The comptroller general approved the operating contracts so
companies can begin drilling,” Gonzalez said. In May, Chile signed
contracts with four IOCs for exploration of eight blocks in the
southern Magallanes region (OGJ, May 12, 2008, Newsletter).
As part of that bidding round, Chile’s mining ministry July 15
awarded the Otway block in the Magallanes region to a consortium
of Wintershall, GeoPark Holdings Ltd., and Methanex Corp., collectively WGM.
The award was made to WGM after Total SA, which last year
won the Otway block in the round, inexplicably did not sign the
special operating contract for the block in May.
The WGM consortium, which plans to invest $30.49 million
on the Otway block, said it will acquire 330 line-km of 2D seismic
data, 470 sq km of 3D seismic data, and will drill seven exploratory
wells.
For its part, Chile’s state-run oil company Empresa Nacional del
Petroleo (Enap) said it plans to invest $300 million. Enap holds
a 50% stake in the Coiron, Caupolican, and Lenga blocks in the
Magallanes region.
Two weeks ago, GeoPark discovered an oil field on Chile’s Fell
block following drilling and testing at its Aonikenk 1 exploration
well (OGJ Online, July 16, 2008). ✦

Gupco starts production from Taurt gas ﬁeld
Gulf of Suez Petroleum Co. (Gupco) has begun natural gas production from Taurt field on the Ras El Bar concession off Egypt.
The offshore field is a subsea development and includes two
subsea wells, a 70-km pipeline, and control umbilical tieback to
upgrading facilities at the existing West Harbor processing plant.
Taurt lies 70 km northeast of Port Said in the West Nile Delta.
Gas production started in July and will be used to supply the Damietta LNG plant.
Gupco is a joint venture of BP PLC, Egyptian General Petroleum
Corp., and Eni SPA affiliate International Egyptian Oil Co. (IEOC).
Taurt is BP’s first subsea development in Egypt.

China’s NDRC approves biodiesel pilot projects
China’s National Development and Reform Commission
(NDRC), focusing on new output targets, has approved three biodiesel pilot projects involving total capacity of 170,000 tonnes.
PetroChina’s Nanchong refinery will build a 60,000 tonne/year
biodiesel plant in Sichuan province, Sinopec will build a 50,000
tpy plant in Guizhou province, and CNOOC will build a 60,000
tpy plant in Hainan province.
NDRC, which said the three biodiesel plants will use jatropha
oil as feedstock, did not provide a timetable for the plants’ construction.
In April, Gushan Environmental Energy Ltd., China’s largest
producer of biodiesel as measured by annual production capacity, began construction of new biodiesel production plants at its
Chongqing and Hunan sites.
Gushan expects both plants to begin production in the fourth
quarter. The Chongqing and Hunan plants are expected to add
60,000 tonnes—30,000 tonnes each—to Gushan’s annual biodiesel production capacity.
Gushan currently operates four production facilities in Sichuan,
Hebei, Fujian provinces and Beijing with a combined annual production capacity of 240,000 tonnes.
The company aims to increase its annual production capacity to

Samsung to build biodiesel plant in Indonesia
Samsung Group intends to invest $1.63 billion to develop a
25,000-hectare oil palm plantation and biodiesel plant in Indonesia’s Riau province.
“They bought the land recently, and that was their first investment. The total investment will likely increase by 10 times,” said
Al Hilal Hamdi, who heads Indonesia’s national team for biofuel
development.
Hamdi, who claimed that Samsung had spent 1.5 trillion rupiah
on acquiring the land and the plant, said the facility was expected
to go online in 2009 and would produce 50,000 kl./year of biodiesel.
Indonesia currently produces two types of biofuel: bioethanol
made from cassava, sugarcane, and sorghum; and biodiesel, which
is made from castor and crude palm oil.
Output of both types is expected to increase greatly after October when Indonesia plans to impose a new regulation requiring
that at least 2.5% of fuel consumed by manufacturers is comprised
of biofuel. ✦

ExxonMobil cranks up Nigerian NGL project
ExxonMobil Corp. unit Mobil Producing Nigeria has begun operating its $1.3 billion East Area Natural Gas Liquids II project on
Bonny Island, about 17 miles off Nigeria. The project is expected
to recover 275 million bbl of NGL from associated natural gas produced in East Area reservoirs on Blocks OML 67, 68, and 70.
In addition, the East Area NGL II project will produce at its peak
about 50,000 b/d of NGL and ultimately recover 275 million bbl
of NGL from about 950 MMscfd.
Major components of the project, according to a company announcement, include an offshore NGL extraction complex, more
than 125 miles of new natural gas and NGL pipelines, and expansion of the existing onshore Bonny River fractionation terminal.
The NGL project is part of an integrated approach to reduce
flaring in conjunction with the existing East Area Additional Oil
Recovery project. “The projects will reduce flaring and improve oil
recovery through reservoir pressure maintenance,” the company
said.
ExxonMobil said the NGL project follows successful start-up
of the East Area Additional Oil Recovery project in June 2006. Together, the two developments “provide for recovery and commercialization of associated gas streams in the field and gas injection
into existing reservoirs for recovery and production of additional
oil volumes,” it said.
Mobil Producing Nigeria (51%) operates the project with coventure partner Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. (49%).
Start-up of the NGL II project brings the total of ExxonMobil
worldwide start-ups in 2008 to five, including Kizomba C Mondo
(Angola; OGJ Online, Jan. 21, 2007), Volve (Norway; OGJ, Feb. 25,
2008, p. 9), Starling (UK; OGJ Online, Jan. 21, 2007), and ACG
Phase 3 (Azerbaijan).

Dolphin lets contract for TFP gas line
The UAE’s Dolphin Energy has awarded a $418 million contract
to Russia’s Stroytransgaz for the construction of the Taweelah-Fujairah natural gas pipeline (TFP).
Construction of the 48-in., 240-km line will begin in the third
quarter, with completion expected in 2010. The line will link Dolphin’s receiving facilities at Taweelah in Abu Dhabi with Fujairah
on the UAE’s eastern coast.
The award for the TFP line pipe was announced in December
2007, with the $200 million order going to Salzgitter Mannesmann International GMBH for the supply of 120,000 tons of X70,
48-in. coated line pipe. More than 40% of the pipe’s length has
been received, with delivery completion set for spring 2009.
Dolphin already supplies the UAE with gas from Qatar via a
48-in., 364-km subsea export pipeline connecting the company’s
Ras Laffan gas processing plant in Qatar with the receiving facilities
at Taweelah. The pipeline can carry as much as 56.6 million cu m/
day of gas or 20.7 billion cu m/year.
In June Oman started preparations for the import of Qatari gas.
Omani Oil and Gas Minister Muhammad bin Hamed al-Rumhi said
a key receiving station at al-Buraimi, on Oman’s border with the
UAE, was being readied ahead of the imminent arrival of the gas.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

“We are hopeful that Dolphin gas will begin flowing next month,”
said Al-Rumhi.
His statement followed earlier reports that Abu Dhabi National
Oil Co. and Dolphin had signed a 25-year pipeline deal for Dolphin to lease and operate ADNOC’s Eastern Gas Distribution System
(EGDS) in Abu Dhabi (OGJ Online, June 18, 2008).
EGDS, which is used to supply gas to ADNOC’s customers in
Abu Dhabi and Dubai, will be leased by Dolphin to deliver the
company’s processed gas from Qatar to customers across the UAE,
as well as Oman.

Sonatrach lets EPC contract for Arzew LNG train
Algerian oil company Sonatrach has awarded Saipem/Snamprogetti, in joint venture with Chiyoda, a €2.8 billion lump sum
turnkey contract for a new LNG train (GL3Z).
The contract encompasses engineering, procurement, and construction of a single 4.7-million tonne/year train to be built near
Arzew, Algeria, about 400 km west of Algiers. Work is to be completed by yearend 2012.
This is the first time Saipem has been named main contractor
of a large LNG plant.
Saipem is 43% owned by Italy’s Eni SPA.

Oil ﬂow resumes from Iraq via Ceyhan pipeline
Iraq resumed sending some 480,000 b/d of crude oil through
its northern pipeline after Turkey allowed exports to restart from its
Mediterranean port of Ceyhan.
The Turkish government had ordered a halt to Iraqi exports on
July 21 as a way of forcing Baghdad to pay an outstanding debt
pegged at some $100 million for unspecified costs.
After Iraq paid half the debt on July 22, Turkish state pipeline
operator Botas restarted loadings from the pipeline at Ceyhan. No
statement was issued concerning the outstanding payment.
Earlier, there had been contradictory statements from Turkish
and Iraqi officials about the shutdown.
An official of Turkey’s state-owned Botas gas company told the
Ihlas news agency that the flow of Iraqi oil exports through the
Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline stopped July 22 for 17 hr.
He said the cause of the halt was technical not financial. “It
is true that Turkey has claims. But the halt of the flow is not concerned with this debt,” he said.
That contradicted earlier reports, attributed to Iraqi oil officials,
that Baghdad’s oil exports to Turkey were halted after a Turkish
court ordered the stoppage pending settlement of a claim.
“A small Turkish court issued an order to stop Iraqi exports because of claims lodged against Iraqi entities,” an official said. He
said the claims were for “relatively small” amounts of money, without providing further details.
Iraq’s northern pipeline, which carries crude from Kirkuk oil
fields to Ceyhan, flows at about 430,000 b/d and accounts for
more than 20% of Iraq’s oil exports. The bulk of Iraqi crude oil
exports, which stand at more than 1.5 million b/d, pass through
its oil export terminal in the south of the country at the port of
Basra. ✦

Arctic resources

Oil provinces

USGS concluded that the area north
of the Arctic Circle has 22% of the
world’s undiscovered, technically recoverable resources.
The region has 13% of the undiscovered oil, 30% of the undiscovered
natural gas, and 20% of the undiscovered natural gas liquids (OGJ Online,
July 24, 2008).
Of the Arctic’s estimated 90 billion
bbl of undiscovered oil, 1,670 tcf of
gas, and 44 billion bbl of NGL, 84% is
believed to be offshore. These figures
are the sum of the mean estimates for
25 provinces.

Arctic Alaska is the top Arctic undiscovered oil province with 30 billion bbl
of undiscovered oil, 221 tcf of gas, and
6 billion bbl of NGL.
Second is Amerasia basin with 9.7
billion bbl, 57 tcf, and 542 million bbl.
The Amerasia basin extends north and
northeastward from Arctic Alaska and
north of the Sverdrup basin.
Third is East Greenland Rift basins
with 8.9 billion bbl, 86 tcf, and 8 billion bbl.
Next is East Barents basins with 7.4
billion bbl, 318 tcf, and 1.4 billion bbl.
Fifth is West Greenland-East Canada

with 7 billion bbl, 51.8 tcf, and 1 billion bbl.

Gas provinces
West Siberian basin is the top Arctic
undiscovered gas province with 651 tcf,
20 billion bbl of NGL, and 3.6 billion
bbl of oil.
East Barents basins is second with
318 tcf of gas, 1.4 billion bbl of NGL,
and 7.4 billion bbl of oil.
Arctic Alaska is third.

Other provinces
Other Arctic provinces estimated at
5 million boe or more of undiscovered,
technically recoverable resources are
the Yenisey-Khatanga basin, Laptev Sea
Shelf, Norwegian Margin, Barents Platform, and Eurasia basin.
Provinces with 1-5 million boe
are North Kara basins and platforms,
Timan-Pechora basin, North Greenland
sheared margin, Lomonosov-Makarov,
Sverdrup basin, Lena-Anabar basin,
North Chukchi-Wrangel Foreland basin,
Vilkitskii basin, and Northwest Laptev
Sea shelf.
Those with less than 1 million boe
are Lena-Vilyui basin, Zyryanka basin,
East Siberian Sea basin, Hope basin, and
Northwest Canada Interior basins.
The USGS did not yet report the
results of individual assessment units in
the provinces.

What it means
The assessment represents an appraisal of possible future additions to
world oil and gas reserves from new
field discoveries in the Arctic.
USGS said, “The study included only
those resources believed to be recoverable using existing technology, but
with the important assumptions for
offshore areas that the resources would
be recoverable even in the presence of
permanent sea ice and oceanic water
depth. No economic considerations are
included.” ✦

Skewed attention to supply
After years of neglect, US energy politics at last
considers supply. The attention is skewed by the
politics of a grueling election year. But skewed attention can be better than none.
Both major political parties, however, seem to
construe oil and gas development as an instantaneous phenomenon that can be switched on and
off at will. A reminder is in order that development involves a long sequence of contingent decisions and activities, all subject to a range of risks
and the vicissitude of economics, politics, and
corporate strategy.
Neither party would be discussing petroleum
development if oil prices were low. They take up
the subject only in response to pressure generated
by the pain of high oil prices. They don’t want to
appear as powerless with prices as they really are.
In fact, the market may be outrunning their promises, having lowered crude oil and product prices
impressively in the past couple of weeks in what
may or may not be a trend.

prices until whatever production results comes on
stream, if then. That will be long after election day.
Democrats, by contrast, say they’ll lower gasoline prices immediately by restricting commodity
trading and pressuring holders of existing OCS
leases to rush drilling and development. They want
to avoid anything, such as OCS leasing, that would
anger their environmentalist wing. Their desperate alternatives to OCS leasing would restrict the
operation of markets and limit future supply. The
effect on prices would be the opposite of what the
Democrats suppose.
Both parties need to acknowledge the limits of
their influence over markets. That step alone would
represent progress in the making of US energy
policy. Another helpful move would be to recognize that oil prices didn’t surge because someone
controlling supply suddenly decided they should.

Industrial energy costs have increased recently relative to industrial
construction costs in a shift that will
affect energy investment, production,
and use.
For at least 4 decades, energy and
construction costs have changed at
nearly identical rates, as shown in the
trend line in Fig. 1, which plots a data
series dating back to 1930. The relative
increase in energy costs
apparent in the 2007
data point is only the
second major upward
departure from the
trend to have occurred
during the period.
In an earlier article,
the author pointed to the inevitability
of this shift and described a wide range
of responses it would induce.1 Among
those responses are the application of
significantly more-expensive exploration and production technologies,
application of advanced enhanced oil
recovery processes, and major increases
in the production of heavy oil.
The recent rise in the cost of energy relative to the costs of industrial
construction would be expected to
encourage construction of new energyproducing and processing facilities.
Higher retail energy costs for gasoline
and electricity should also encourage
new energy-related investments in the
US.
This real surge in new domestic
energy-producing investments is not
apparent today, except perhaps for
petroleum drilling. While environmental and regulatory constraints are
major factors in this delay in energyproduction investment, the long-term
correlation of industrial construction
with industrial energy costs also has
been an important limit on investment
in energy-producing facilities.

this plot are the Nelson-Farrar Refinery
Fuel Index and Refinery Construction
Index tabulated in Oil & Gas Journal.
The computed slope for the plot is
1.00, although the fuel index shows
considerable fluctuation relative to the
construction index.
The author has previously published
this curve in OGJ with data to 1992,
among other observations regarding
petroleum supply and price.1 The 1:1
ratio of energy to investment cost has
continued with peaks in industrial
energy prices in 1984 and now in
2007. Between these two peaks, there
was a prolonged apparent depression
of industrial energy prices relative to
investment costs.
The slope was calculated with the
Excel Solver with the following equation:
1) log (energy cost index) = n log
(investment index) + k
The Excel Solver calculated the two
correlating parameters n and k to minimize the error associated with calculated industrial energy costs using the
following equation applied to each year
of the data:
2) error = (log (energy index calculated) – log (energy index tabulated))2

The above yearly errors were
summed, and then the sum was
minimized by the Excel Solver. The
result was that n = 1.00, the slope of
the curve shown in Fig. 1. The actual
numbers that fit the first equation were
n = 1.00525, k = 0.481 with the summation of errors being 1.225. This large
summation of errors is due to the cyclic
nature of the energy cost index with
respect to the investment cost index,
which is also obvious in Fig. 1. The

industrial energy dropped below construction costs rapidly for more than
a decade. So in 2008, potential investors must make a decision about the
expected financial returns from new
or expanded energy production and
processing investments.
Potential investors realize that these
financial returns are largely a function
of energy policies, not technology or
energy resources. So an optimal energy
policy for international petroleum producers might be to randomize increasing petroleum prices. The implication
of this external policy is that domestic
energy policy should stabilize energy
markets with loan guarantees for new
economically attractive, long-term
energy production and processing facilities, etc. In addition, environmental
constraints, in particular carbon dioxide
emissions, should be economically
reasonable and stabilized.
Potential investors must also accept rather high investments required
per unit of energy made available. The
public example is drilling in ultradeep
water, a production realm in which
records of depth and distance from
shore are being set frequently. Tar sands
and heavy oil production also represent
large investments per unit of hydrocarbon energy made available.
The world will never run out of
oil, only the oil that can be produced
economically relative to other energy
sources. That concept was elaborated
on in the previous article mentioned
earlier, which estimated the amounts of
oil ultimately to be produced based on
historic production data. It was necessary to include a price of oil, fourfold
greater than in 2002, relative to other
energy sources to establish an amount
of oil ultimately to be produced, Q∞.
A value of 2.3 × l012 bbl was chosen
to fit historic world petroleum production data shown in Figs. 1 and 3 of that
analysis.1 A recent example of costs
and energy policy constraining energy
availability is the FutureGen coal-fired
electric power plant. Increasing estimated investment costs have resulted
in investing companies and the Depart-

ment of Energy backing off from that
project.
“Free” renewable energy resources
such as wind and solar are particularly
sensitive to high investment costs per
unit of energy actually produced, since
both wind and solar are intermittent
and then vary in intensity, even when
nominally available. In addition, the
economies of scale for solar and wind
are less favorable than they are with
traditional chemical processing plants
and refineries. It takes a whole line of
duplicate wind turbines to generate major amounts of electricity since the size
of each unit is limited by materials and
mechanical design factors as well as the
nature of the wind. Solar collectors are
sold by the square foot, so doubling the
output power approaches doubling the
cost of the proposed solar power facility.
Another factor is the increase in
estimated investment costs as moredetailed designs are completed for new
processes. In 1981 the author estimated,
using 27 data points, that these increases in investment costs resulting from
more-realistic designs were 18%/year
for proposed 250 MMcfd Lurgi synthetic natural gas plants over the 9-year
period in which SNG plants were being
discussed.2 This is an 18%/year increase
beyond the inflation of construction
costs estimated with the Chemical Engineering Index.

10,000

Indexes commonly used to correct
construction costs as a function of time
are for existing and proven plant designs. These indexes include the Chemical Engineering Index, Nelson Refinery
Index, and Marshall Swift Installed
Equipment Index. This historic observation of increasing estimated investment costs as more detailed design are
completed contrasts with the promises
of less costly facilities in the future. Reduced costs for construction of future
facilities, termed the learning curve, are
demonstrated for technologies that are
already commercial.
It is easy to project new processes
that have very desirable features in
today’s context. For example, highpressure gasification of residual biomass
with sequestration of carbon dioxide
in deep saline aquifers would result in
a process with a major negative carbon
footprint: CO2 would actually be removed from the atmosphere. Now, add
membrane separators to separate hydrogen from the gasifier product gases for
use in fuel-cell powered vehicles. Transposing this two sentence conceptual
process into reality would require many
million of dollars and several years of
effort. It then might be found that the
actual costs were still prohibitive.
Many people and firms promoting
their own renewable energy or environmental cleanup processes fail to appre-

advances of the past 20 years.
Directional drilling has reduced the
well pad footprint at Prudhoe Bay by
88% in the past 20 years, she maintained. “More oil probably leaks on
driveways here in Washington, DC, than
touches the ground in Alaska. Let’s use
this ingenuity to develop more of our
resources and move ahead on renewable
and alternative technologies,” she urged.
Byron L. Dorgan (D-ND) said Republicans still are promoting a “drive
and drill” strategy. “The oil industry
has many friends here who are willing
to act like human brake pads and stop
proposals which encourage alternatives

and other real solutions. Is their policy
going to be to just drill a hole, which
is a relic of yesterday, or to engage in
a game-changing strategy? We should
have had 100 senators ready to shut
down excessive oil speculation last
week. We should have had 100 votes for
solar, wind, biofuel, and conservation
tax credits,” he said.
David Vitter (R-La.) said a full energy
debate is needed, and that he had proposed seven amendments already. “This
issue hasn’t been the first question at
my town hall meetings for the past
year; it’s been the first 10 questions. Everyone has asked why Congress hasn’t

done anything about high gasoline
prices. Other senators have other good
ideas. We need an open process that lets
us call up amendments, debate the ideas
and act on them,” he said.
Majority Whip Richard J. Durbin
(D-Ill.) said leasing of 12 million acres
in the latest federal OCS sale when 200
million acres were offered indicates
that the oil and gas industry isn’t taking full advantage of its opportunities
domestically. Calls to open more of the
OCS, he continued, are “the administration’s last attempt to give oil companies

OCS survey

Costly E&P
behind high prices

S

everal members of Congress may
try to minimize it. But experts
say that a basic force behind dramatically higher oil and gas prices
is more expensive exploration and
production.
“Both the public and policy focus
is on [the crude oil] price. But the
dramatic increases in costs are bedeviling the industry, delaying new supplies and constitute one of the major
reasons for rising prices,” Cambridge
Energy Research Associates Chairman
Daniel Yergin told a US Senate workshop on oil prices on July 17.
“The problem is not only access
but building facilities to produce new
fields. An attitude has permeated the
market that if an oil company says
production will begin in 6 years, it
actually will happen in 10 years,”
observed Roger Diwan, a partner and
head of the financial advisory practice
at PFC Energy, at the same event.
The oil and gas upstream sector’s
problems in responding quickly to
soaring oil prices now are rooted
in plunging prices 20 years ago,
the two experts agreed. Companies
concentrated on downsizing from
1998 to 2000 because they expected
prices to stay low, Yergin said. Manufacturers produced less equipment
and universities educated fewer
petroleum engineers and geologists,
Diwan said.

$100 then, $210 now
The latest Upstream Capital Costs
Index compiled by CERA and its parent, IHS Inc., found that costs associated with constructing new oil and
gas upstream facilities have doubled
since 2005. The index grew reached
a record 210, CERA said on May 14.
26

Since the index’s values are based on
costs in 2000, that means that equipment costing $100 then would cost
$210 now, it added.
Rising oil and gas resource development expenses have been driven
by raw material costs, CERA’s report
said. Iron ore costs for finished steel
have gone up by as much as 60%
since the beginning of 2008 as
contracts have been renegotiated, it
noted.

Qualiﬁed employees
“Steel costs are a huge issue. So
are labor costs. It gets harder to find
qualified employees as we get into
the Bakken shale and other lessconventional areas. Horizontal wells
are more expensive,” said Frederick
Lawrence, vice-president of economics and industry affairs at the Independent Petroleum Association of
America.
“Privately held independent
producers are drilling about half the
new US oil and gas wells. These costs
are hitting them hard. They don’t
have the recruiting resources that
large, publicly held companies have.
Keeping qualified labor and having
the best technology becomes more
and more expensive each year,” he
said.
Yet wells keep getting drilled, he
continued. “The number of rigs that
have been put to work in the Barnett shale and other active plays has
jumped dramatically. It’s amazing
that Congress says we’re not using
our leases to their maximum potential when the industry is breaking
drilling records around the country,”
Lawrence said. ✦

Bingaman noted that the 2005
Energy Policy Act contained a provision
requiring the US Department of the
Interior to survey the OCS for the first
time in more than 20 years. When it reported back after doing so in 2006, he
said he noticed that it had tried to save
money by not using three-dimensional
seismic mapping. “Neither the administration nor Congress tried to get another survey done with modern, more
accurate technology,” Bingaman said.
When asked following the workshop
if another OCS study could be part of
DOI’s fiscal 2010 budget, Bingaman
said that it might.
Other Democrats questioned whether increasing available OCS acreage
would send a strong, positive signal to
world oil markets as some Republicans
have claimed. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.)
said that bids were received on only
200 million of the 500 million acres
of new Gulf of Mexico tracts offered in
OCS Lease Sale No. 181, and producers
have not fully developed onshore and
offshore leases they already have. “This
psychological effect idea is a specious
argument. We really can’t affect world
prices with our geology,” she said.
“Oil is a global commodity, influenced by supply, demand and events.
How you affect these elements is on the
fringe unless you make a massive effort.
It would be false, as some people suggest, to think that opening up the OCS
today would reduce prices tomorrow,”
added Robert Menendez (D-NJ).
But the two witnesses called for
expansion of federal oil and gas leasing
on the OCS. “Responsible development
of part of the OCS should be part of the
picture. The sense of new prospective
territories becoming available and moving toward exploration would be very
beneficial,” Yergin said. “Many people
have said that the United States needs
to increase its supplies. I don’t think
it’s fair to ask other countries to do it
if we’re not willing to do something
ourselves,” Diwan said.

$9/bbl in the 2 days after US President
George W. Bush lifted the executive
withdrawal of US OCS tracts on July 14,
however, they suggested that other factors might have been at work. Speculators might have sold oil positions to pay
off losses in other markets, Diwan said.
A US decision to negotiate directly with
Iran may have had the most positive impact, he added. “There also could have
been pessimism about the weakening
US economy and its impact on future
demand,” said Yergin.

OPEC’s spare capacity
The two witnesses emphasized that
a wide variety of conditions over a
long period led to 2008’s dramatic oil
price increases. A combination of supply and demand shocks from 1985 to
2005 wiped out the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries’ spare
capacity, which left markets without any

down-side risk, Diwan said. Sluggish
supply growth outside OPEC has fed the
future scarcity narrative, which attracted
financial players to oil commodity markets, he said.
Yergin added that from 1998
through 2000, major oil companies
downsized dramatically to survive because oil and gas prices were so weak.
Investments were not made in new
equipment or in training new engineers, both witnesses said. “It’s clear
we’re in an oil shock now. The fact that
it coincides with a financial crisis means
people are talking about stagflation for
the first time since the 1970s. Changes
in the makeup of the oil commodity
markets are definitely a factor. So are the
declining dollar and US relations with
other countries,” said Yergin.
“In the last 25 years, the United
States has encouraged consumption

and discouraged production. That
needs to be changed. It took us 20
years to get to a truly tight market. It
will take a long time for us to unwind
it. The problem is not only access but
building facilities to produce from
new fields,” Diwan said.
Strong worldwide economic growth
ignited energy demand in China, India,
and other countries, they noted, adding that these countries could embrace
conservation next. “I think it’s striking
that the Chinese have put efficiency at
the top of their energy list. China and
India both need to feel that the energy
security system built around the International Energy Agency will work for
them too,” Yergin said.
“If we put aside the geopolitical
questions, I think the energy supply
response has begun. Oil is not going
to have as dominant a position 5 years
from now,” Yergin said. ✦

BLM decision sets stage for major NPR-A lease sale
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The US Bureau of Land Management issued a record of decision that
sets the stage for a major lease sale in
the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska’s
northeast portion.
Land in the NPR-A’s northwest
section also will be offered in the sale
expected in the fall, the US Department of the Interior agency said on July
16. It said that the acreage, which will
become available in the two sections,
could result in as much as 8.4 billion
bbl of oil being developed.
Several trillion cubic feet of natural
gas also might be produced for shipment to markets in the Lower 48 states
on pipelines which have been proposed, BLM added.
Officials emphasized that the announcement was not a response to a
proposal by US House Democrats last
week to require BLM to offer more
leases within the NPR-A as an alterna28

tive to Congress authorizing leasing on
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge’s
coastal plain.
“We’ve been on a track to complete
this planning process for some time. We
completed this final [environmental impact statement] a month ago and made
no secret about making a final decision
after the 30 days we were required to
wait. I don’t think this has anything to
do with whatever is happening on the
Hill,” Deputy BLM Director Henri Bisson told reporters during a teleconference.
“This is an opportunity for what we
hope will be a major lease sale for land
in the northeast NPR-A in October that
has not been leased as well as for land
in the northwest NPR-A. I think we’ve
achieved a pretty good balance and that
most people will be satisfied,” he said.
The decision includes a 10-year deferral of leasing on land north and east of
Teshepuk Lake, Bisson said.

Wildlife protection
Tom Lonnie, BLM’s Alaska state
director, said that the decision provides
for protection of high-value wildlife,
including caribou and water fowl, and
meets North Slope residents’ subsistence needs while making land with
high oil and gas potential available for
leasing.
He said that the plan includes protections for polar bears, including requirements to consider impacts on areas the
animals use for dens. The polar bear’s
listing as a threatened species means
that BLM will continue to work closely
with the US Fish and Wildlife Service
on future oil and gas activities, he said.
The NPR-A’s supplement final plan
under which the leases will be issued
has phased leasing and performancebased measures as major components,
according to Lonnie. Production of
oil from this area will assure that the
Trans-Alaska Pipeline System remains
viable, he explained. TAPS throughput currently is around 700,000 b/d,

down from its full 2.1 million b/d
capacity, he said.
ConocoPhillips has production just
outside the NPR-A and has estimated
that production from leases within the
reserve could begin as early as 2012,
Lonnie said. Existing infrastructure just
east of the NPR-A connects with TAPS,
he said.
“It’s impossible to anticipate the size
of production. It’s always possible that
there will be a discovery offshore and

a pipeline would be brought in further
west, which would allow us to hook in
earlier,” Lonnie added.
“It’s also important to understand
that NPR-A has future natural gas resources that potentially could be more
important than oil, so any gas pipeline
that is constructed will use them heavily,” said Bisson. Producers which have
expressed interest include Anadarko
Petroleum Corp. and Pioneer Natural
Resources Co., he said. ✦

Indonesia, in a bid to exercise greater

Indonesia’s OPEC withdraw decision ‘sovereign’
Eric Watkins
Senior Correspondent
Chakib Khelil, president of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, while acknowledging that
Indonesia has played an important role

since joining the organization in 1962,
said its plan to withdraw from the
group is a “sovereign” decision.
Khelil also indicated that several options were available, saying that Indonesia could either suspend its membership or remain in the organization as an

Windfall proﬁts tax
The announcement also coincided
with calls for the government to issue a
special tax on windfall profits reaped by
oil and gas companies.
Marwan Batubara, a member of
the Regional Representatives Council
(DPD), July 21 said a windfall profit tax
for oil and gas firms would be a “fair
measure” to help relieve the burden of
high gas prices on Indonesians.
“Oil and gas, just like other natural
resources, belong to the people. But, it
is the people who are suffering from
skyrocketing oil prices—[while] with
little effort, oil and gas firms are gaining tremendous profits from the hike,”
Marwan said.
“If the government applies a windfall profits tax of 50%, our state income
will increase by 20.36 trillion rupiahs/
year,” Marwan said.
Energy analyst Kurtubi said such a
tax would be fair as companies were
not enjoying windfall profits due to the
caliber of their strategies, investments,
or technologies but “merely because of
the soaring global prices.”
However, Kurtubi said that such a tax
would be best introduced in conjunction with measures designed to create a
more conducive investment climate for
the industry. “The government must for
instance simplify the investment procedures and withdraw the production
tax,” Kurtubi said. ✦

Mexico, US talk

T

he US and Mexico are reported
to have begun talks on how to
conduct oil exploration operations
in the Gulf of Mexico beginning in
2011 when a 10-year moratorium
expires.
News of the discussions between
the US and Mexico came as analysts
and officials of the Latin American
nation expressed concern over declining production.
The US-Mexico talks are focused
on the treaty, signed on June 9, 2000,
between the two countries on the delimitation of the continental shelf in
the western Gulf of Mexico beyond
200 nautical miles. The treaty specially mentioned the need for cooperation between the two nations, “taking
into account the possibility that there
could exist petroleum or natural gas
reservoirs that extend across that
continental shelf boundary.”

comprised by the Hoyo de Dona.
Oviedo Perez said he would like to
see joint operation become the “standard way” concerning exploitation of
cross-border reserves in the gulf.
His remarks chime in with observations by some Mexican experts that
the exploitation of the waters on the
US’s side of the gulf boundary could
reduce reserves on the Mexican side.

Migrating reserves?

“When they take petroleum from
the American side, our petroleum is
going to migrate,” said Francisco Labastida Ochoa, head of the Mexican
Senate’s Energy Committee, in a recent interview with Mexico’s Milenio
newspaper. Discussions between
the US and Mexico came as officials

at yearend. “All the options are open,
but it is up to Indonesia to make the
decision,” Khelil said.
Indonesia’s Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro
repeated his country’s aim of leaving
the group when its membership expires
at the end of the year, saying that, “We
have become a net oil importer.”

Indonesia’s future
Indonesia turned a net oil importer
in 2003 on declining production of
oil together with increasing domestic
consumption. However, government officials have said Indonesia could rejoin
OPEC in the future if its oil production
and exports pick up again.
The discussion over Indonesia’s
future in OPEC coincided with reports
that—due to continued low domestic
production and spiraling consumption—the country’s oil and fuels trade
balance has been in deficit for the first
half of this year and is likely to remain
in deficit for the remainder of 2008.
Economist Faisal Basri of the University of Indonesia (UI) said the deficit
stood at $5.5 billion as of the end of
May, with oil and fuel imports reaching
$13 billion while exports earned just
$7.56 billion. “We are heading toward
a very critical situation if we don’t
formulate a proper energy policy. The
deficit is predicted to be $15 billion at
the end of this year,” said Faisal at a discussion on the energy crisis held by UI.
The big gap between the fuels import and export shows the country has
poor production but massive consumption, said Faisal, who added that inefficiencies at state-owned Pertamina have
contributed significantly to the wide
gap between imports and exports.
Faisal offered a comparison to illustrate his point, saying, “Pertamina’s
cost recovery in 2007 was $36.10/
bbl, while Chevron’s [Corp.] was only
$6.80/bbl.”

and gas sector have not been as successful as government officials had hoped.
According to Evita H. Legowo, the
newly appointed director general of oil
and gas in the ministry of energy and
mineral resources, half of the 21 oil and
gas blocks offered by the government
last year failed to attract investors.
“We don’t know exactly why some
blocks didn’t attract any investors. It
could have been that investors had
doubts about the data or maybe they
needed more advanced technology to
operate the blocks on offer,” said Evita.
In a renewed effort to attract investment, the government plans to open
a new auction for oil and gas blocks
in October or November, and may
include those blocks leftover from
the last round. “We are still formulating which blocks we will offer. We are
also still deciding whether the unsold
blocks would be offered again or not,”
said Evita, who did not disclose which
blocks remained unsold.
In May 2007, the government put up
21 oil and gas blocks for auction. ✦

Pertamina to offset
downtime, hike
August fuel imports
Indonesia’s state-owned PT Pertamina will raise its fuel imports by 60%
for about a month to compensate for a
drop in production at its Cilacap refinery in Central Java. The state firm will
be conducting an overhaul in August at
the facility.
Ahmad Faisal, Pertamina director
of marketing, said the company will
increase its imports to match the normal monthly output from the Cilacap
facility, which produces 350,000 b/d.
About 60% of its output includes fuel,
while the remainder is taken up by
asphalt and oil-based lubricants.
The announcement followed reports
that Pertamina, already a candidate for
government scrutiny over corruption
in the upstream sector, is facing charges

by legislators of “irregularities” in its
importation of crude oil and products.
In 2007, Pertamina imported
321,000 b/d of crude oil and
300,000-350,000 b/d of fuel to help
meet domestic demand of 1 million
b/d of fuel. The country’s six refineries
reportedly have a combined production
capacity of 652,000 b/d.
The Cilacap refinery has two crude

distillation units with respective capacities of 118,000 b/d and 230,000 b/d.
The facility also has a 29,000 b/d
gasoline-making reforming unit and a
50,000 b/d visbreaker.
Last year, Pertamina and Japan’s Mitsui & Co. announced plans to establish a
joint venture to build a $1 billion gasoline cracker at the Cilacap refinery, and

Atmomartoyo said the new unit would
have a capacity of 40,000-50,000 b/d.
In May, Pertamina processing director Rukmi Hadihartini said the state oil
and gas firm would soon seek financial

support to upgrade the refinery, adding
that the company would reach a final
investment decision in October for the
project.

Pertamina estimates have put the cost
at around $1.9 billion, but Hadihartini said recalculations are under way
as “the price of raw materials, such as
steel, has soared.” ✦

API: US oil demand dropped 3% during ﬁrst half
US oil demand dropped 3% in 2008’s
first 6 months as gasoline deliveries fell
1.7% in their first significant 6-month
decrease since 1991, the American
Petroleum Institute reported on July 18.
Domestic petroleum demand had been
faltering for 3 years, managing only to
hold relatively steady, before deliveries
for this year’s first half averaged 20.08
million b/d, their lowest 6-month level
since early 2003, API said in its monthly
statistical report for June.
“Higher pump prices and a slowing
economy were undoubtedly factors,”
said Ron Planting, API’s statistical
director. “What was really remarkable
was that we had the largest decline in
internal consumption in 17 years—to
the lowest level since 2003.”
The decline did not extend to diesel
fuel, where demand for ultralow-sulfur
diesel (ULSD) jumped 16% year-to-year
to an average 3.25 million b/d from
2.8 million b/d, according to API. It
said that low sulfur diesel deliveries
climbed 7.2% to an average 3.58 million b/d from 3.34 million b/d during
the comparable 2007 period.
Planting said refiners have supplied
the US market with record diesel supplies. Domestic refiners have increased
capacity and are making greater record
amounts of diesel as a percentage of
their total runs, he told reporters during a teleconference.

Gasoline inventories also grew yearto-year, increasing 3.6% to 212.1 million bbl at the end of June from 204.8
million bbl a year earlier. API measures
demand based on deliveries, which fell
1.7% during the first half to an average
9.06 million b/d from 9.21 million b/d
during 2007’s initial 6 months, it said.
“Gasoline has a greater share at the
consumer level, which is more discretionary. Diesel users already have figured
out the shortest routes and ways to use
fuel more efficiently, so they tend to be
less flexible,” Planting explained. US
retail gasoline prices averaged $4.113/
gal, and retail diesel prices averaged
$4.764/gal, the US Energy Information
Administration reported on July 14.
Asked if motor fuel prices have reached
a level impacting demand, API Chief
Economist John C. Felmy replied, “Our
data clearly show it in the United States.
“The issue here is more what’s happening at the world level, particularly
China, India, and the Middle East. Those
areas still have subsidies and price
controls. In China, it’s hard to see much
happening before the Olympics, but it
could do something after. India is moving more toward a service economy
that could reduce domestic pressure to
continue subsidies. Producing countries
in the Middle East also might take another look at subsidies,” he continued.

Diesel inventories

Slowing demand also influenced US
petroleum imports, which sank below
an average 13 million b/d, their lowest first-half level since 2003, API said.
Crude oil imports, excluding purchases
for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, fell
2.5% year-to-year to an average 9.77
million b/d from 10.02 million b/d.

API’s statistics showed that ULSD
inventories at the end of June totaled
72.3 million bbl, 8.1% higher than
their 66.9 million bbl a year earlier.
Low sulfur diesel inventories grew 1.2%
to 92.5 million bbl from 91.4 million
bbl during the same period.
34

Imports also drop

Product imports dropped 9.9% to 3.19
million b/d from 3.54 million b/d
during the same period.
Domestic crude oil and condensate
production slid 2.2% during the first
half to an average 5.09 million b/d from
5.21 million b/d in the comparable
2007 period, according to API. Natural
gas liquids production rose 5.2% yearto-year to an average 1.83 million b/d
from 1.74 million b/d, it said.
Crude oil production in the Lower 48
states fell 2.1% during the first half to an
average 4.4 million b/d, despite year-toyear increases in some regions, API said.
It indicated that Alaskan crude oil output
for 2008’s initial 6 months was down
6.4% to an average 725,000 b/d.
“It’s not for lack of trying. Exploratory drilling is up 53% this year. Footage
drilled is up 50%. Development drilling
increased about 15% in the second
quarter, not as much as exploratory
drilling. The industry is trying hard,
but if you keep going back to the same
areas, you find less oil and gas. That’s
the key point of our request for more
access,” Felmy said.
Production would not increase immediately even if Congress decided to
open more of the Outer Continental
Shelf and authorize leasing on the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge’s coastal plain,
he conceded. “Companies have to do
a host of environmental impact statements, get permits and lease tracts. If
Congress were to make a statement
that we’re serious about going forward
into new areas, there would be sufficient time to develop the infrastructure. Churchill once said the best time
to plant a tree is 20 years ago, and the
second best time is now,” API’s chief
economist said. ✦

Despite the growth of other regions,
Europe remains one of the world’s largest offshore producing theaters.
Nearly 600 offshore fields have been
developed off Europe, involving a similar number of platforms plus some 380
subsea wells, over 200 subsea templates,
and nearly 1,000 pipelines.
However, the corporate scene has
changed dramatically as declining
production and high costs have
forced the original developers, the oil majors, off to
other regions. This has opened
the way for a new breed of
smaller players better geared
to economically extracting
the remaining reserves from a
multitude of small fields and squeezing
the last drops out of massively depleted
existing ones.

energy needs in 2020, and the UKCS
has the potential to provide 20-25% of
UK gas demand and 60-65% of UK oil
demand.
West Sole (1965), the first gas discovery in the UK North Sea, went on
production in 1967. Since then, the UK
has produced 37.5 billion boe and has
the potential to deliver another 25 billion boe or more over time, according
38

It has been reported that in 2007
around 40% of the region’s exploration wells were successful, discovering
300-400 million boe. However, these
were typically less than 20 million boe,
and such accumulations bring to the
fore the issue of costs.
Through mid-July 2008, five offshore fields have been approved for
development; Maersk’s BOA, Petrofac’s
Don South West and West Don, Venture’s
Grouse, and Oilexco’s Shelley. Discoveries are still being made. In late June

to the industry body Oil & Gas UK.
Current business plans outline the
potential for the delivery of 10 billion boe from existing fields and new
projects. However, they also note that
further progress will require exploration to be sustained at current rates for
decades, matched by improvements to
the investment climate to encourage the
maximum recovery of oil and gas from
existing fields.

UK offshore operating costs rose
almost 30% from 2006 to 2007 with
the average technical cost of new developments (capex and opex combined)
having reached $29/boe for projects
coming on stream over the next 3 years,
a level some 70% higher than in 2005.
UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown
and the Chancellor of the Exchequer
Alistair Darling ventured north on May
28 to meet with oil industry executives
in Aberdeen. The meeting was to discuss
the global oil supplies situation, but the
minister was undoubtedly made aware
of the fact that even at current oil and
gas prices it is difficult for the North
Sea to attract investment in marginal
field developments and that the players
need an improved fiscal package.
Turning to drilling, which consumes
so much of offshore outlays, activity in
the region is again dominated by the
UK and Norway. A Douglas-Westwood
study found that 83% of the 2,624
wells drilled off Western Europe in
2003 to 2007 were in these two countries, and the bulk was in the North
Sea. A total of 2,349 exploratory and
development wells is forecast over the
next 5 years, and few are expected to be
drilled in deep water.
During the last 5 years Western
Europe attracted the third highest
volume of offshore drilling spending in
the world, almost all of it ventured in

Pore pressure greatly
affects drilling safety and
the economics of drilling
design and well construction.
Drilling
This article focuses
on how a calibrated 3D
pore-pressure volume can be used to
optimize well design when pore pressure and mud weight windows are the
dominant issues in drilling.
Engineers often use estimated pore
and fracture pressure profiles along the
well path as primary input to the well
design due to their overriding influence
on casing seat selection. This, in turn, is
the primary driver for hole geometry,
casing program, and overall well cost.
While this type of workflow has been
used historically for wells in abnormally pressured areas, it also applies to
wells drilled through depleted zones.
More recently, this has also applied to
deepwater wells, even when normally
pressured, due to issues surrounding
support of the mud column in the drilling riser.
High-quality 3D volumes of mechanical earth properties such as pore
pressure and fracture gradient can provide detailed insight into relative pressure distributions within a volume. Reliable quantitative calibration, however,
using data from drilled wells within the
area, can deliver a more accurate pressure model in which to
plan the well.

constraints imposed by these profiles.
Integrating 3D pressure data with
other appropriate tools allows the wellpath trajectory to become an active
variable in the well’s planning process.
This can produce far more effective solutions than those constrained by fixed
pressure profiles.
The first requirement to use 3D pressure data effectively for well planning is
a visualization tool with the
ability to corender multiple
volumes and isolate features
and data ranges through
combinations of color and
opacity. Fig. 1 shows 3D
pore pressure values corendered with seismic data and
existing wells in a structurally complex
reservoir.
A volume-based seismic interpretation solution is ideally suited for this
requirement. Pressure sealing and
nonsealing faults and formations can
be more clearly distinguished, based
on the presence or absence of pressure
discontinuities across specific geologic
boundaries.
Effectively planning a well in a
3D pressure volume requires a fullfunctioned well planning tool that can
interactively create geometrically valid
well paths in the 3D volume based on
specified engineering constraints.

tive well path planning tools provides a
powerful combination for optimizing
the well-path pressure profile on a qualitative basis. For example, variable opacity displays can be used to identify visually areas where the pressure is above or
below a certain gradient threshold. This
can be effective in identifying routes to
reach specific targets, avoiding isolated
areas of abnormally high pressure. Furthermore, the ability to display volume
data as ribbons and curtains along any
well path allows visual determination of
the pressure profiles in any given well.
Trajectory design alone, however,
cannot determine how easily or even
whether a well can be engineered and
physically drilled.

Uniﬁed solution
The large number of interdependent
variables involved in well design make
it impossible to identify a single “best”
design for any well. While it is often
possible to optimize for a subject of the
variables, it is unrealistic in almost all
cases to determine the absolute optimal
design covering all aspects of the well
trajectory, casing program, drillstring,
mud system, hydraulic, and rig requirements. Thus, there is a need to be able
to iterate rapidly through many design
options, to identify practical alternatives, and to focus engineering resources on the integrity of a chosen design.
To examine all the alternatives and
converge on this optimal well design,
it is vital that all engineering analysis
functions be fully integrated within the
same application as the well-planning
functions and reference a common
drilling database (Fig. 2). The Paradigm
Sysdrill application provides such a unified drilling engineering solution. Use
of a common data model ensures that
any changes to the well path and well
path-related data, such as the pressure
profile, are immediately available to
all engineering analyses, removing the
need for data exchange or replication.
Direct extraction of 3D volume data
along a well path allows the pore and
fracture gradient profiles specific to that
wellbore to be used directly for calcuOil & Gas Journal / Aug. 4, 2008

Further engineering analysis would

cases, might identify further issues or

It is therefore essential that the wellplanning and engineering functions are
delivered as a unified solution, tightly
integrated with a 3D visualization application, so that the workflow can be
quickly rerun as required to optimize
the well design. Integrating multidisciplinary applications is the key to
well-design efficiency.

Fossil fuel development requires long-term sulfur strategies

Based on history, the world will
require long-term sulfur management
strategies because the increased development of fossil fuels likely will result
in involuntary production of large
amounts of surplus sulfur.
At present, the high price for sulfur
has removed the stranded label from
even the most remote sulfur blocks.
Nonetheless, experience has shown
that this situation may not last. If that
surplus arises, it may persist for long
time in comparison with the historical
frequency of up and down cycles of the
sulfur market.
Current management strategies have
dealt with surplus sulfur, for the most
part, satisfactorily over the short-term.
These strategies, may be characterized,
in part, by:
• Relatively short-term storage,
during which older blocks have been
preserved from the initial pour of
about 25 years.
• Magnitude and duration of existing acid-gas injection schemes.
Based on a presentation to PennWell’s Oil Sands
and Heavy Oil Technologies conference, Calgary,
July 16-17, 2008.

• Capacity of newly developed
sulfur consuming products to use large
amounts of sulfur relative to what may
be produced.
If one considers that a period of sulfur surplus could extend as long as our
dependence on fossil fuel consumption
continues, the limitations associated
with current strategies come into focus.
These limitations arise from many factors, including the inherent physical
and chemical properties of sulfur as
well as regional variations in regulatory
frameworks, prevalent climatic conditions, environmental impact tolerance,
and available space at grade, below
grade, or in subterranean formations.
In recent years, Alberta Sulphur
Research Ltd. has been examining the
chemistry associated with several con-

cepts that deal with long-term management of surplus sulfur.
Concerning aboveground block
storage, the company has examined
certain protective barriers that may
help preserve the physical and chemical integrity of the sulfur block. It has
also investigated in laboratory and field
demonstrations the feasibility and benefits of storing sulfur in shallow belowgrade excavations with subsequent
capping. Another study looked at certain
aspects of acid-gas injection chemistry
for facilitating modeling of the behavior
of fluids rich in H2S and CO2.
Finally, it has investigated a new use
for sulfur in which hydrogen sulfide
is combusted to sulfur dioxide, the
thermal energy captured, and the sulfur
(and perhaps some CO2) sequestered by
injection into, for example, a depleted
sour-gas reservoir.

The tiered sulfur block resides on a sound base pad (Fig. 1).

block. An overseas company also has
initiated a pilot investigation of covered-block storage. ASRL hopes to initiate a similar field test in south central
Alberta within the year (Fig. 5).
The concept of a protective strategy

Since 1989, companies in Western
Canada have disposed of acid gas by
injecting it into subterranean formations. Target reservoirs have consisted of
deep saline aquifers, depleted sour-gas
reservoirs, and at least one active souroil reservoir.
To date the largest operation in Canada is the Talisman-Spectra operation at
Kwoen in northeast British Columbia.
This operation injects close to 660
tonnes/day (tpd) sulfur (as H2S) and
320 tpd of CO2.
The ERCB reported in its 2006 Annual Report on Sulphur Recovery that
38 acid-gas injection schemes were in
operation in Alberta with total licensed
injection capacity of 572 tpd sulfur.8
Furthermore, the same document reports that of the 14 sour-gas processing
plants degrandfathered during 2001-06,
half selected acid-gas injection as the
H2S-CO2 management option.
While most schemes to date are
small in scale, relatively few technical obstacles exist for scaling up from
the 1.7 million cu m/day operation at
Labarge in Wyoming to much larger
operations compressing raw sour gas or
amine acid gas.
The sequestration of H2S by aqueous phase trapping, mineralization,
and mobile-phase migration have been
studied, but some concerns remain
regarding long-term containment.
One area that required further
research was the generation of additional phase-equilibrium data to predict
dewpoint temperature and pressure of
various acid-gas compositions for the
injection. The prediction would enable
the design engineer to decide on the

Acid-gas combustion
One specific drawback to acid-gas
injection is that hydrogen sulfide returned to the reservoir is an energy-rich
molecule.
By foregoing the Claus operation,
the plant loses a source of steam that is
typically used to regenerate the richamine stream.
Clark has proposed a one way of
recovering that energy and returning
sulfur to the reservoir.13 The method
is to combust the acid gas to sulfur
dioxide and compress and liquefy the
SO2 stream and inject it downhole. The
target reservoir would be a depleted
sour gas or a sour-oil formation.
Once the SO2 or the SO2-CO2 mixture reaches the reservoir, the SO2 will
react almost instantaneously with the
residual hydrogen sulfide in an underground Claus reaction. This reaction
will produce two condensable products:
sulfur and water. These products should
not migrate laterally to any extent.
Depending on the dominant seques-

tration mechanism, the pressure in the
reservoir may not increase but could
decrease in time. The H2S content of
the reservoir fluid also will decrease
in time. Thus, this is an opportunity to
take a sour-hydrocarbon resource, generate sweet gas with no sulfur emission
and no carbon emission to generate
steam or electricity from the combustion and sequester the SO2 and CO2
downhole.
Downhole there is little pressure

long-term concerns about cap rock or

concept. Of course, one could burn the
surplus sulfur to generate heat and SO2
as well. An engineering company has
already proposed a two-step combustion process.14
An intensive program in the laboratory has focused on this concept, which
ASRL presented in 1999. To date, the
program has examined the properties
of sulfur (melting point and viscosity
under high acid-gas partial pressure)
and the properties of SO2-CO2 mixtures under elevated temperature and
pressure (density, solubility in aqueous
fluids, and saturated water content).15 16

Improving performance
Molecular-sieve (MS) adsorbents
have become widespread for removing
contaminant from natural gas. Over the
last 3-4 decades, they have proven suitable and economic in reducing contaminant levels during gas processing. With
increasing treatment requirements,
however, including more stringent
product and effluent specifications,
greater plant size, and increasingly difficult feedstocks, there is considerable
incentive to improve MS performance.
Simultaneously, decades-long experience from operating plants has begun
to reveal limitations in conventional use
of these materials. With guidance from
the past, MS end-users and manufacturers are developing effective strategies
for enhancing use of these materials
and maximizing their potential.
ExxonMobil has been involved in adsorption and adsorbent use for at least
a half-a-century, with both operating
experience and ongoing MS and adsorbent development programs. Relevant
experience includes gas treatment at
several locations worldwide conducted
over the entire gamut of operating
conditions. It is one of the largest users
of adsorbents supplied by vendors and
maintains its own internal programs
and research into new adsorbent materials and chemistry.
This unique combination of breadth
of operating experience and depth of
in-house research capability has allowed
ExxonMobil to approach the problem
of optimizing adsorbent performance
from a unique vantage point.
Key limitations exist in conventional
MS operating practice, including deactivation via exposure to certain contaminants, suboptimal regeneration (e.g.,
refluxing), unwanted byproducts during regeneration, and lowered adsorbent life due to increased regeneration
frequency and severity. The company’s
strategy addresses these limitations using:

lar sieves. The transient thermal waves
produced during regeneration, for
example, may create unwanted byproducts like COS.
Improper regeneration may ultimately reduce product quality if the temperature is too low or time is too short. On
the other hand, excessive temperatures
or heating times may reduce adsorbent
life or cause adsorbate decomposition
(or coking) in some instances.
Modified cycling, as well as additional adsorbents (such as alumina),
can reduce degradation of molecular
sieves. Such additional adsorbents also
allow targeting and removal of other
contaminants, including oxygenates like
methanol that may promote undesirable
side reactions on valuable molecular
sieves.
This article will discuss effective
compound-bed configurations and
process techniques to address
problems sometimes encounFig. 1
tered with conventional mole
sieve treatment.
ExxonMobil Corp. operates dozens of gas-treatment
plants worldwide and is
committed to using modern,
advanced materials, as well as
lowering regeneration-energy
requirements, thereby reducing emissions.

wave arrives, they may react in some
fashion, possibly catalyzed by the solid
itself. Again, reduced regeneration
temperatures will tend to reduce these
undesirable side reactions.
Another means to reduce decomposition reactions is to ramp the temperature
more slowly during initial stages of regeneration. This allows more time for the
molecules to desorb, diffuse, and flow out
of the bed before the high temperature
front arrives. A variation of this theme
is to bring the temperature up to some
intermediate value and hold it there for
some time, then ramp to the final temperature. Ramping, or holding at intermediate temperatures, also reduces the thermal
stress placed on the system but increases
the regeneration cycle time.
Of course, any modification to regeneration cycles requires agreement from
operations, as adjustment of the regeneration stream cleanup system may also
be needed. It is ideal to have the material
vendor in agreement with the changes,
but this may not always occur.

Compound beds
To minimize adverse effects of the
cracking of heavy components, we suggest using compound beds (i.e., MS and
desiccant), including modified alumina
in the product zone, for example in
Zone A3 in Fig. 1. ExxonMobil’s studies
indicate that, by doing so, one could
use a regeneration stream with lower
temperature and also a regeneration
stream that contains a small amount of
water vapor that may suppress coking
reactions.14
Adding water vapor to the regeneration stream for a short period may act
to desorb heavy molecules (BTX and
mercaptans) before the thermal wave
arrives. In effect, it may be a modified
desorptive,1 or displacement type of
regeneration.15 Use of alumina controls
the rate at which water is added to the
regeneration stream.
Figs. 4 and 5 exemplify the advantages of our approach compared
with using only MS (the conventional
approach). These figures were generated with the aid of an in-house

Field data capture system offers updated version
Field data capture system eVIN has
released its latest version—eVIN 2008.
The company says its mobile application for oil fields captures daily well information on about 25% of the producing
wells in the US and about 15% worldwide.
With the 2008 release of eVIN, the firm is
broadening its use and expanding its capabilities to remote environments around the
world. eVIN’s new framework provides integration into production forecast systems,
putting production targets into the hands
of the pumper down to the measurement
point level.
This latest release provides:
• Complete route and stop management.
• Advanced field data capture of daily
data, run ticket, and tank volumes.
• Automated alarms and graphs for
problem resolution.
• Accountability to meet production
targets.
64

The program allows field operators
to compare on a daily basis actual vs.

THE REMAINDER

September 30 – October 2, 2008
Hilton Fort Worth
Fort Worth, Texas USA

UNCONVENTIONAL GAS EXTRACTION BECOMING VIABLE
Production from unconventional reservoirs — tight gas sands, shales, and coalbeds--accounts for a large and growing share of total gas
supply. But the reservoirs are complex. The costs of drilling into and completing wells in them are continually rising while presenting unique
environmental problems. Producing gas from unconventional reserves proﬁtably, safely, and in amounts demanded by the market requires
increasingly sophisticated recovery methods.
Gas recovery from unconventional reserves will be explored on September 30 – October 2, 2008 at the
Unconventional Gas International Conference & Exhibition to be held at the Hilton Fort Worth, in Fort Worth,
Texas. Planned by the editors of Oil & Gas Journal and an Advisory Board of industry experts, the event will
highlight innovation from unconventional gas plays around the world.

NEW!
This timely new book
book, written by an expert team of
scientists and engineers, provides a road map for
transforming energy business capabilities to confront an
increasingly competitive global economy.
Authors Roger Anderson, Albert Boulanger, John Johnson, and Arthur
Kressner extend into the energy industry the best practices available in
computational sciences and the lean management principles currently
being used in other leading manufacturing industries.
Computer-aided lean management (CALM) technologies and
methodologies can be used to:
• Signiﬁcantly lower costs and improve operations of electric power
utilities and oil and gas companies.
• Assure that a new design introduced to the “market” will be effective.
• Measure the results of an action taken and use those measurements
to drive greater efﬁciency in business operations.

“

Computer-Aided Lean Management for the Energy Industry comes at a
critical time in the world’s energy lifecycle…. Applying the ‘lean practices’
of the aerospace and auto industries to energy production and distribution
will enable the wringing out of waste from our energy infrastructure. In so
doing, the concepts explored in this book may prove to be the cheapest
and cleanest forms of energy available on the planet.

”

— Ron Prosser, formerly president of Boeing Services Co. and currently CEO of The
Prosser Group, consultants on green energy related projects.

High oil prices
form weak base
for state power
Most Americans base their distaste for
foreign oil on presumed instability in the
Middle East. They should note recent events
in Moscow and Minsk.
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
visited Russia and Belarus to sign energy
deals and, as usual, chatter about US “aggression” and “imperialism.”
This is the despot who has embraced
truculent Iranian President Mahmoud

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

Ahmadinejad and supported terrorists in
Colombia. In Moscow he signed separate
deals with TNK-BP, Lukoil, and Gazprom for
exploration and development in Venezuela’s
Orinoco heavy oil region, where his government has expropriated interests of western
oil companies in existing projects while
raising taxes.
He also sought a second agreement
to buy Russian military equipment and
proposed, according to Fox News, an alliance with Moscow through which “we can
guarantee Venezuela’s sovereignty, which is
now threatened by the United States.”
As though to hedge his bets, the Venezuelan leader stopped in Minsk to schmooze
with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenka, who called him a “brother.”
Lukashenka also regularly denounces
the US and, like Chavez, holds ofﬁce by virtue of elections widely regarded as rigged.
Belarus, though, has squabbled with
Russia over oil and other matters. So
when Chavez agreed in Minsk to expand
an energy cooperation agreement that the
governments entered last year, he might
have been playing his chums against one
another.
After Chavez left Moscow, meanwhile,
fractures widened between the 50-50 partners in TNK-BP: BP and Alfa Access Renova.
BP responded to pressure from AAR by
withdrawing its seconded employees. Then
Robert Dudley, the British head of the joint
venture, left Russia citing harassment from
the four Russian billionaires that make up
AAR. The partners had been calling for
Dudley’s resignation since a board meeting in Cyprus earlier this month. After the
meeting, the government did its part for the
home team by refusing to renew Dudley’s
1-year visa.
So goes business in Russia and Venezuela, where citizens seem to like the
immoderate exertion of state power. The
power of the moment, of course, owes
much to oil prices that have deﬁed the laws
of economic gravity—until recently.
What was that about “instability?”

A week of falling prices
The biggest ever work-week fall of crude prices dropped a total $16.20 July 14-18
to $128.88/bbl, “below key price points that bulls may have needed to hold onto to
continue their rally,” said analysts at Pritchard Capital Partners LLC, New Orleans.
“Some think enough damage was done to the complex to usher in $120/bbl crude
oil as the next technical ‘must hold,’” the analysts said at the time. Prices continued
falling the following week, with the August contract for benchmark US light, sweet
crudes expiring July 22 at $127.95/bbl. As the Energy Information Administration reported a bigger than expected drop in US oil inventories and an unexpected jump in
gasoline stocks, The new front-month September contract dropped $3.98 to $124.12/
bbl July 23 before rebounding to $125.49/bbl July 24 on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
Prices for crude and petroleum products made moderate gains in early trading July 25. Pritchard Capital analysts said, “Product inventories continue to build
amid soft demand, but in order for reformulated blend stock for oxygenate blending
(RBOB) and heating oil to test some of the critical support levels, it will need some
cooperation from crude oil, particularly in the case of RBOB where crack spreads are
miserable.”
Dolly, a category 2 hurricane, came ashore at South Padre Island, Tex., July 23,
and then subsided to a tropical storm as it drenched South Texas. Although the
storm inﬂicted no damage on most oil and gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico, the
US Minerals Management Service reported workers were evacuated from 62 of the
717 manned production platforms in the gulf and from 8 rigs of the 123 offshore rigs
by the time the hurricane made landfall.
MMS estimated 4.47% of oil production and 7.87% of gas production in the
gulf was shut in due to the storm. Total production from US leases in the gulf was
estimated at 1.3 million b/d of oil and 7.7 bcfd of gas as of January. Workers quickly
returned offshore after the hurricane passed.
Inventory surprises
EIA reported commercial US crude inventories fell 1.6 million bbl to 295.3 million
bbl during the week ended July 18, exceeding a Wall Street consensus of a 700,000
bbl draw. Gasoline stocks jumped by 2.9 million bbl to 217.1 million bbl in the same
period, vs. Wall Street’s expectations of a 100,000 bbl decline. Only the distillate fuel
consensus was on target, with inventories up 2.4 million bbl to 128.1 million bbl.
Propane and propylene inventories were up 300,000 bbl to 45.3 million bbl.
Imports of crude into the US fell 985,000 b/d to 9.8 million b/d in that same week.
Input of crude into US reﬁneries was down 355,000 b/d to 15.1 million b/d with
reﬁneries operating at 87.1% of capacity. Gasoline production rose to 9.2 million b/d
during that period, while distillate fuel production decreased to 4.6 million b/d.
“The larger-than-expected draw was primarily due to a drop in imports to 9.81
million b/d from 10.79 million,” said Michael C. Schmitz, Banc of America Securities
LLC, New York. “Imports have averaged 9.88 million b/d year-to-date, 2.3% lower
year over year. Otherwise, reﬁnery utilization dropped 2.4% to 87.1% vs. consensus for no change as reﬁning margins remain weak due to deteriorating product
demand.”
Jacques H. Rousseau, an analyst at Soleil-Back Bay Research, reported, “Weak
demand led to a 6.3 million bbl (1.7%) build to reﬁned product inventories (gasoline plus distillate plus jet fuel), the largest increase since Jan. 4.” As a result of
the rising inventories and falling margins, reﬁners reduced their utilization rate to
87.1%, well below year-ago levels of 91.7%. Reﬁnery runs were at the lowest levels
since 1997.
Soleil-Back Bay Research lowered its estimates of reﬁners’ earnings in the last
half of 2008 through 2009 primarily on expectations that weak demand for reﬁned
products will continue over the next 12-18 months.
Based on US data, July has been a weak month for gasoline demand while the
overall level of US oil demand remained relatively robust. Compared with an all-time
record high demand in July 2007, Paul Horsnell, Barclays Capital Inc., London, said,
“Gasoline demand is noticeably weaker in year-over-year terms than it has been in
any month this year.” Despite talk of demand destruction, he said, “When the fall
already released in wholesale prices is passed through to retail prices, and with the
rate of increase tailing off, we would expect US gasoline demand to recover somewhat from the relatively gentle 1.4% decline seen for 2008 to date.”

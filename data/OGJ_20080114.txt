Baker Hughes delivers Best-in-Class results

Continuous Viscosity Profile Aids
Production Facilities Design
Location: Campos Basin, Brazil
Client: Petrobras
Objectives:
Characterize the reservoir to plan the field development
Characterize the reservoir fluid to help design lifting
and production facilities

Challenges:
Reservoir oil composition is expected to vary. 14 - 15°
API oil is common, but 25° API also is found in offset wells.
MREX
2.5 cP
PVT
2.5 cP

Solution:
The Baker Atlas MR ExplorerSM (MREXSM) service identified
reservoir intervals with different oil properties.
Baker Atlas’ Reservoir Characterization Instrument®
(RCI®) service collected six single-phase fluid samples
in the identified intervals.

Results:
Single-phase samples provided high-resolution
PVT characterization of the reservoir fluid. Average
contamination is less than 0.4%.

MREX
2.4 cP
PVT
2.9 cP

The MREX analysis characterized in-situ oil viscosity as a
continuous curve, matching measured viscosity within 5%.
The PVT properties and in-situ viscosity profile helped client
optimize production facilities.

COVER
US President George W. Bush called the 2007 Energy Independence
and Security Act, which he signed into law on Dec. 19, 2007, an
example of what can be accomplished when Congress and his administration worked together. In actuality the bill survived several
confrontations in and out of Congress before it reached his desk.
Washington oil and gas industry association executives are preparing for more bruising legislative battles this year as they fight to
keep gains from the 2005 Energy Policy Act and 2006 Enhanced
Energy Security Act.Their assessments of 2008’s prospects, which
range from guardedly hopeful to warily grim, are showcased in a
special report on US Energy Politics, beginning on p. 20.

Westwood sees jump in deepwater investment
Operators will make capital investments in deepwater exploration and production of nearly $25 billion/year by 2012, says John
Westwood, managing director of the UK consultancy DouglasWestwood Ltd.
Deep water, Westwood told the Society of Underwater Technology in Houston, represents “virtually the only place where giant
oil fields will be found in future years.”
Major international oil companies, he stressed, need that kind
of discovery.
“There are literally hundreds of small, undeveloped offshore
fields worldwide, but ‘big oil’ needs big fields,” Westwood said.
“The remaining ‘easy oil’ and indeed gas is in hard places and is
being strongly competed for by countries such as China, India,
and Russia. A recent example is Gazprom’s move to gain access to
Nigerian gas reserves.”
The 2008-12 growth his firm projects for deepwater E&P expenditure represents growth over the prior 5 years of 30%. It
will “drive demand for deepwater drilling rigs, floating production systems, subsea production hardware, and more,” Westwood
said.
Major companies increasingly turn to deepwater operations as
production declines in continental shelf areas such as the North
Sea and Gulf of Mexico and as access shrinks to opportunities elsewhere.
Westwood noted that national oil companies control 80% of
global oil reserves, the same share international oil companies controlled in the 1970s.
At the same time, international companies face rapidly rising
costs.
For example, Westwood said, lifting costs in the UK North Sea
increased from $15/bbl in 2005 to $25/bbl.
Westwood cited the Arctic as another potentially rich but difficult producing area, where Russia, Canada, and the US are competing in “a great subsea land claim.”

Iraq starts lease round prequaliﬁcation process
Iraq’s Oil Ministry has invited international oil companies to
submit applications for a prequalification process ahead of the
country’s planned oil licensing round.
The ministry said the process would help to identify those companies that are qualified to work in the country, with only qualified and selected groups to be invited to participate in competitive
bidding later.
The deadline for submissions is Jan. 31. Names of qualified
companies will be published after this date.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

The timing of the licensing round itself remains unclear, however, with the ministry only indicating that tenders for oil extraction and service contracts in southern, central, and northern Iraq
would be issued “soon.”
Meanwhile, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and Nechirvan
Barzani, the prime minister of the Kurdistan region, held a round
of talks on Jan. 2 to discuss pending issues between the central
government and the government of the Kurdistan region.
High on the agenda of their talks were the oil contracts that the
Kurdistan region government has signed.
An Iraqi spokesman said President Jalal Talabani and al-Maliki
signed an agreement specifying that all signed contracts should
be subject to the provisions of the Iraqi Constitution and that the
government of the Kurdistan region should delay signing anything
related to oil contracts.
Concerning the signing of oil contracts, Mahmud Uthman, a
member of the Kurdistan Alliance, told London’s Asharq al-Awsat
newspaper that, “If the two sides do not agree on this issue, they
will refer it to the Supreme (Federal) Court to look into it and decide whether these contracts are legal or illegal.”

Total to share CCS pilot results with Indonesia
Total SA signed an agreement to pass on to Indonesia the results
of its carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) pilot project near
Pau in southwestern France.
The agreement gives the Indonesian Agency for the Research
and Development of Energy and Mining Resources access to the
main results of Total’s pilot project in the Lacq basin.
This project involves extracting CO2 from gases emitted by a
boiler at a Lacq factory and reinjecting it 4,500 m underground in
an old gas field.
Total plans the first injection of CO2 in late 2008 and will inject
a further 150,000 tonnes of CO2 over the following 2 years and
measure the results.
The project, one of the first in the world to include the whole
chain from combustion to CO2 geological storage, is primarily intended to prove the technical feasibility of an integrated carbon
capture and storage scheme.
“It should enable Total to contribute to the fight against global
warming and provide an efficient solution to help limiting the
footprint of Total’s activities in exploration and production, refining, and chemicals,” Total said.
Total said Indonesia will be able to develop its technical and
economical understanding of such a CO2 storage scheme, especially concerning the geological aspects. That could assist the Indonesian government to establish an appropriate regulatory framework
for similar projects in that country. ✦

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Partners make oil ﬁnd with Julia in gulf

Natuna D-Alpha gas ﬁeld development pact nears

ExxonMobil Corp. and StatoilHydro AS have made an oil discovery 265 miles southwest of New Orleans in the Gulf of Mexico.
Drilled to a total depth of 9,500 m, the Julia discovery well lies in
2,000 m of water.
Partner StatoilHydro said further appraisal drilling is planned
this year to determine the extent of the discovery. “This is a promising oil discovery,” said Helen Butcher, StatoilHydro’s exploration
manager for deepwater Gulf of Mexico. “StatoilHydro is a major
lease holder in Walker Ridge. This discovery supports our firm belief in this area,” she added.
Julia is the first well drilled under a 2005 exploration agreement
between StatoilHydro and ExxonMobil in deepwater gulf. StatoilHydro is participating in further developing two additional finds
in the same area: Jack and St. Malo. Both are scheduled to come on
stream after 2013.

Indonesia and ExxonMobil Corp. are nearing an agreement to
renew their contract for development of Natuna D-Alpha gas field in
the Natuna Sea, about 140 miles east-northeast of Natuna Island.
The two sides are now finalizing the wording of the agreement
under which the government is set to secure a production split,
according to Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro.
Under the former contract, ExxonMobil had a 100% production split (OGJ, Nov. 21, 1994, p. 30). However Purnomo said the
government will seek a greater share for state-owned PT Pertamina.
He did not say how much the government is seeking.
According to Indonesian state media, the Natuna Block is believed to have reserves amounting to 46 tcf of recoverable gas.

Apache has drilling success with Argentine well
Houston independent Apache Corp. reported that its Seccion
Banos-2004 well on the Argentine side of Tierra del Fuego island is
producing 1,635 b/d of oil and 1.3 MMcfd of gas from the Lower
Cretaceous Springhill sandstone. The well is the first large producer
drilled following Apache’s 700 sq-mile (1,800 sq-km), 3D seismic
survey in the area.
“Prior to Apache becoming operator of this 714,000-acre
block...very little 3D seismic had been acquired,” said Apache Pres.
and Chief Executive Steven Farris. “With 40% of the survey shot,
and newly processed data arriving every day, we have identified
more than 30 exploratory, field extension, and development locations.”
Apache said SB-2004 had the highest initial production rate of
any well drilled in 40 years of oil and gas activity on the concession. Drilled to 5,544 ft, it confirms the productivity of a sparsely
drilled 20 sq mile area between three 40-year-old fields—Canadon
Piedras, Cabo Nombre, and Bajo Grande. Apache has begun drilling
the first of six potential offsets it has identified.
Production from SB-2004 follows Apache’s development of the
previously unexploited offshore discovery at Cabo Nombre Sur,
4.2 miles to the south. Two wells—CNS-2005 and CNS-2006—are
producing a total of 11.5 MMcfd of gas and 53 b/d of oil.
Apache operates the Tierra del Fuego concession and holds a
70% working interest; Repsol-YPF SA holds 30%.
On Tierra del Fuego, Apache holds almost 2 million gross
acres—714,000 acres on the Argentine side of the island and two
recently awarded exploration blocks comprising 1.2 million acres
on the Chilean side. Apache’s net production on the island is 5,226
b/d of liquids and 122 MMcf of gas.

ONGC Videsh, Hindujas Group sign E&P pact
Seeking to acquire more oil and gas assets abroad, the board
of ONGC Videsh Ltd. (OVL) has agreed to sign a memorandum
of understanding with Hinduja Group, London, to jointly explore
acquisition of overseas acreages, particularly in Iran. OVL is the
overseas arm of India’s state-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp.
“Now we will talk to the Iranian authorities on the projects,”
a senior OVL executive said. “Based on the opportunities, we will
form a project-specific joint venture or an SPV.”
For developing assets in Iran, OVL and the Hindujas will adopt
a collaborative approach. Indications are that they were exploring
joint opportunities in Iran’s onshore Azadegan oil field and its offshore South Pars Phase 12 gas asset.
The equity structure and investment decision will be finalized
once an equity stake in the two blocks is obtained. OVL and the
Hindujas were understood to be in talks with a subsidiary of National Iranian Oil Co. for a presence in the two fields.
Azadegan, with reserves estimated at 33 billion bbl, is one of
the largest oil fields to be discovered in the world during the past
30 years.
South Pars gas field contains about 50% of Iran’s gas resources.
Together with its extension, Qatar’s North field, it is regarded as the
largest offshore gas field in the world.

Iran awards Dayyer gulf block to Edison
Iran signed a contract with Edison of Italy for exploration rights
to the 2.1 million acre Dayyer offshore block.
The block lies generally between Iran’s coastal towns of Kangan
and Bushehr, north across the Persian Gulf from the Qatar peninsula.
Edison plans to shoot seismic and drill one exploration well in
a 4-year exploration period, investing €30 million.
National Iranian Oil Co. offered the block for bids in 2004. ✦

Johnson, and western Dallas counties in Texas. Additional acreage
is being acquired by Chesapeake’s own landmen and lease brokers
as well as through land services agreements with leasing teams of
four smaller companies.
The 2007 gross production exit rate from the Barnett share was
600 MMcfd of gas equivalent (400 MMcfd net) compared with a
2006 gross production exit rate of 250 MMcfd.
“We now will focus on achieving our 2008 gross production
exit rate target of 900-1,000 MMcfd,” McClendon said.

Petrobras lets contracts for Cascade, Chinook
Petrobras America has let a $50 million contract to Subsea 7 Inc.
to design and install power cables, control umbilicals, and 16 jumpers for the deepwater Cascade and Chinook oil fields in the Gulf of
Mexico. The fields are expected to start production in 2010.
Subsea 7 will handle 70 km of power cables, and it will use of
its deepwater umbilical installation vessels in late 2009 and early
2010. “The final selection of vessel will be dependant on the size
and weight of product to be installed following optimization by
Petrobras and Subsea 7,” the company said.
A floating production, storage, and offloading vessel will be
used for the first time in the gulf to bring Cascade and Chinook
onstream. At least two subsea wells in Cascade and one subsea well
in Chinook will each be drilled to 27,000 ft and tied back to the
FPSO. Based on reservoir performance, the development plan could

Processing
Iraq reﬁnery ﬁre kills one, injures 15
One worker was killed and 15 others injured when a fire broke
out at Iraq’s largest refinery in Baiji, Salahudin province, just 200
km north of Baghdad.
A spokesman for the oil ministry could not say when the fire
was likely to be extinguished or production expected to resume.
The fire was ignited by an explosion at the refinery’s cooking
gas unit, but the spokesman said it was too soon to tell if the explosion was the result of an accident or not.
Baiji has been the focus in recent months of violent attacks by
suspected fighters belonging to the al-Qaeda terrorist organization.
News of the fire coincided with claims by Iraq’s militant Ansar al-Islam Group that it was responsible for three attacks on US
forces and an oil pipeline during Dec. 20 to Jan. 2.
The group, which has ties to al-Qaeda, said it blew up an oil
pipeline in the Zammar area of north Mosul on Jan. 1.

Marathon lets contract for Detroit plant expansion
Marathon Oil Corp. has let an integrated engineering, procurement, and construction contract to Fluor Corp., Irving, Tex., for its
projected $1.9 billion expansion and upgrade of the company’s
Detroit, Mich., refinery.
The $1.6 billion EPC contract includes services, the value of
procured materials, and the construction contracts under Fluor’s
direct management. The full EPC contract value will be booked in

be expanded to include additional wells on each unit.
Both fields are in Block 425 of the Walter Ridge area in
2,300-3,000 m of water. Petrobras is operator with 50% of Cascade and 66.67% of Chinook. Devon Energy Corp. owns the remaining 50% of Cascade, and Total E&P USA Inc. owns 33.33% of
Chinook.

Total lets N. Sea platforms construction contract
Total E&P Nederland has appointed Fabricom Oil & Gas to design and construct its 21 offshore production platforms in the
Dutch sector of the North Sea. The value of the deal was not disclosed.
Under the 5-year framework agreement, work will be carried
out on a lump-sum basis under the construction-driven engineering principle in which the construction experience acts as a guideline for the engineering, Fabricom said. This new style of working
is expected to reduce lead times and costs, and improve quality of
the work.
Fabricom will join Total in project management, detail engineering, work preparation, procurement, prefabrication, offshore
installation, and precommissioning. “Total E&P Nederland retains
the responsibility for the studies and basic engineering as well as
the purchase of specific materials,” it added.
Fabricom signed a maintenance contract for the same platforms
in July 2007. ✦

the fourth quarter of 2007.
With completion of this project, Fluor will have assisted Marathon in increasing the Detroit refinery’s heavy oil processing capacity, including Canadian bitumen blends, by about 80,000 b/d.
Total refining capacity will increase to 115,000 b/d from 100,000
b/d.
Construction is expected to begin within the next few months
and the project is expected to reach completion in late 2010, adding more than 400,000 gpd of transportation fuels to market.

Star Petroleum lets contract for Thai jet fuel plant
Star Petroleum Refining Co. Ltd. let a $60 million contract to
CB&I, The Woodlands, Tex., to build a jet fuel processing plant and
related storage and shipping systems in Rayong Province, Thailand.
The scope of work includes engineering, procurement, fabrication, and construction of a Jet Merox plant to treat and sweeten jet
fuel with a capacity of 20,000 b/d. Also included are associated
process facilities, four 100,000-bbl jet fuel storage tanks, and pipeline sendout and marine facilities.
CB&I also is contracted to build an oil and diesel storage system,
which includes a 160,000-bbl diesel storage tank, a 750,000-bbl
oil storage tank, and all of the associated piping and mechanical
work.
The full project is scheduled for completion by early 2009. Star
Petroleum is a joint venture of Chevron Corp. and PTT PCL. ✦

ExxonMobil planning a ﬂoating LNG terminal
ExxonMobil Corp. plans to seek regulatory approval for BlueOcean Energy, a floating LNG receiving terminal that will help
boost natural gas supplies to New Jersey and New York.
The project, estimated to cost more than $1 billion, will have
the capacity to supply 1.2 bcfd. The terminal is expected to be
moored in 150 ft of water about 30 miles off Long Island. The
terminal would be away from shipping lanes, ports, and recreational areas.
With several years required for permitting, engineering, and
construction, BlueOcean Energy is expected to begin service
around 2015.
Plans call for a subsea pipeline to deliver gas to New Jersey and
New York markets. No pipeline route has been selected, although
initial plans involve a crossing in New Jersey’s Raritan Bay.
The floating terminal is designed to receive LNG supplies from
double-hulled LNG vessels about twice a week. The LNG will be
stored inside insulated tanks within the terminal’s double hull.
BlueOcean Energy is at the start of a lengthy, rigorous permitting process involving state and federal agencies and the public.
The US Maritime Administration and the US Coast Guard are the
agencies that review terminal plans under the Deepwater Port
Act.
In addition to BlueOcean Energy, ExxonMobil is involved in
three other terminal projects. Receiving terminals are under construction near Sabine Pass, Tex.; in Wales; and in the Adriatic Sea
off Italy.
BlueOcean Energy has commissioned former New Jersey Atty.
Gen. John Farmer, a security expert and senior counsel to the 911
Commission, to conduct a safety and security assessment of the
proposed facility.

Pipeline outlet eyed for Rubiales heavy oil
Rubiales heavy oil field in Colombia’s Los Llanos Orientales area
could have a 170,000 b/d pipeline outlet by late 2009.
Petro Rubiales Energy Corp., Vancouver, BC, signed a memorandum of understanding with Colombia’s state-owned Ecopetrol for
construction of a 230-km, 24-in. pipeline costing more than $300
million that will transport oil from Rubiales and Piriri fields in the
Meta Department to the Casanare station for transshipment to the
Oleoducto Central SA (Ocensa) pipeline. Petro Rubiales will build
another pipeline branch to the Cusiana station.
Interests in the project are to be Ecopetrol 65% and Petro Rubiales 35%. Capacity is expandable to 260,000 b/d to accomodate
further developments and exploration in coming years, Petro Rubiales said.

Qatargas delivers ﬁrst LNG via its Q-Flex vessels
Qatargas has delivered its first shipment of LNG using one of its
chartered Q-Flex vessels.
The Al Gattara left Doha on Dec. 3 and arrived at Tohoku Electric
Power Co.’s terminal in northern Japan, completing her maiden
cargo voyage without incident, said Ahmed Al Khulaifi, chief operating officer for shipping.
10

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

The newly designed Q-Flex vessels have on-board liquefaction
capacity and about 40% lower energy requirements and carbon
emissions than conventional vessels due to the economies of scale
created by their size and the efficiency of their engines.
Qatar Gas Transport Co. Ltd. and OSG International Inc. jointly
own the Al Gattara, which Qatargas has chartered on a long-term
basis.
Meanwhile, Qatargas has signed a supply contract for 700,000
tonnes/year of LNG from the Qatargas 2 venture to be shipped
starting in 2009 to Mexican power company Total Gas & Power.
The LNG will be supplied from Qatargas 2’s Train 5, which is
expected to come on stream in 2009, supplying Mexico’s Altamira
terminal and opening a new market for Qatari LNG’s 31 million
tonnes/year exports.

Nexus secures tanker, ﬁrst loan for Crux
Nexus Energy Ltd., Melbourne, has secured a tanker to be converted into a floating production, storage, and offloading vessel
and a $50 million (Aus.) bank loan to kick-start its proposed Crux
liquids project in the Browse basin off Western Australia.
Vanguard Oil & Gas International is purchasing the MV Ishwari
to convert into an FPSO for use at Crux, Nexus said.
This follows a July 2007 memorandum of understanding
among Nexus, Vanguard, and Viking Shipping that established an
engineering design and equipment procurement program leading
to the expected sanction of the Crux project during third-quarter
2008 with a production start-up of mid-2010.
Design work includes a gas processing plant to be incorporated
onto the topsides of the vessel and a weather-vaning turret and
mooring system.
The vessel is described as a high quality, well-maintained Suezmax class oil tanker with a double hull that was built in South
Korea in 1991.
Thome Offshore Management, Singapore, will manage the Ishwari during trading prior to conversion and will serve as subcontractor to Vanguard for the vessel’s life extension, conversion, operation, and maintenance in the field.
The Early Stage Project Finance Development Facility is being
provided by the Bank of Scotland International (Australia). The
funds will be applied to drilling costs for the current Crux-3 and
Crux-4 wells.
Nexus says the Crux-3 well has intersected 150 m of high quality net pay over a 300 m gross vertical gas column that includes a
fourth reservoir zone not previously confirmed in the field.
Pressure data in this and previous wells indicate the gas sands in
each formation (Montara formation, Plover formation and Nome
formation A & B sands) are in pressure communication across the
field and form part of a single accumulation. This is expected to
simplify the development plan.
Nexus has an 85% stake in AC/P23, which contains Crux, with
Osaka Gas holding 15%. Nexus also holds a 50% interest in adjoining AC/P41, with Shell holding the other 50%, which contains
similar exploration prospects. ✦

Peak-oil concerns
I attended the Association for the Study
of Peak Oil 2007 World Oil Conference
that was held in Houston not too long
ago (OGJ, Nov. 26, 2007, p. 22). The
conference only drew 525 attendees. I
find it alarming that only 525 people are
concerned with the reality that world
oil production will soon peak and then
ultimately start declining. Some at the
conference argued that peak production
has already occurred, while others forecast a peak to occur in 2040. The fact is,
it doesn’t really matter exactly when peak
oil production happens as long as we can
all agree that peak oil production will
happen, and when it does, the lifestyles
of most people in the US will change
forever.
The United States has 5% of the
world’s population yet consumes 25%
of the world’s oil. Twenty years ago the
United States imported 30% of its oil.
Today we import 68% of our oil with
most of it coming from Canada, Saudi
Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela, and Nigeria.
Canada’s oil production is in decline,
and so is Mexico’s. Venezuela has a
whacky dictator, and Nigeria continues
to have civil unrest. Lastly, Saudi Arabia’s oil production could be in decline,
but no one knows for sure because the
Saudis aren’t talking. When you factor
in China and India’s increasing thirst for
oil, it doesn’t take a fifth grader to tell
you that demand will soon overtake supply if it hasn’t already.
When Matt Simmons [chairman,
Simmons & Co. International, Houston]
spoke at the ASPO conference, he noted
that there were only 3.1 million hits on
Google for “peak oil” vs. 80.5 million
hits for “global warming.” How can an
issue that will ultimately affect the way
we live, the way we work, the way we
travel, and indeed the quality of life for
future generations to come, be of such
little importance? I applaud the work
of ASPO and similar organizations that
strive to educate the public on such a
complicated subject. I look forward to
the 2008 World Oil Conference and only
hope that we can at least double the
2007 attendance.

March 3 – 5, 2008 / Moody Gardens Hotel & Convention Center, Galveston, Texas

SUBSEA TIEBACK
Forum & Exhibition

PennWell invites you back to the 8th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition.
SSTB has become the premier event for one of the fastest growing field
development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March 3 – 5, 2008 in
Galveston, TX at the Moody Gardens Hotel & Conference Center. Over 2,000
people and 150 exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference.You can’t
afford to miss it.
As our industry confronts new challenges, it has never been more important
to submerse yourself in them. This year’s theme is “Subsea is here, the game
is changing.” As our game changes, the sharing of knowledge and collective
experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety,
and economics of the subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by
industry leaders. As in the past, only by participating in this conference will you
be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will not be published and no
Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room
stays inside the conference room. We hope you will join us.

OGJ’s news mainstays

Bob Tippee
Editor
A new information service illustrates
three mainstays of Oil & Gas Journal’s
approach to news.
It’s targeted. It’s electronic. And it’s
authoritative.
The new service is OGJ Washington
Pulse. You can find it by clicking the
appropriately labeled link in the gray
navigation bar on the left side of the
OGJ Online home page (www.ogjon________
line.com).
______
On the OGJWP
main page, you’ll
find a number of
articles in several departments
plus an archive of
stories written in
previous weeks.
Articles go
online as they’re
written and edited.
Each Thursday, all
items written since the prior Thursday
are assembled into a dated newsletter
that can be downloaded from the “Archive” area and printed.
In a few weeks, only OGJWP subscribers will be able to open current
articles and archived newsletters.

makers in the oil and gas business—engineers, geoscientists, and top managers.
To OGJ’s audience, even outside the
US, Washington news is important.
Laws, regulations, and proposals in
the world’s biggest energy-consuming
country and fifth-largest oil producer
affect the oil and gas business far beyond US boundaries.
So OGJ has covered Washington for
decades. But it has aimed its Washington coverage at professionals busy with
industry operations—people affected by
but not directly involved with energy
politics. The focus is on consequences
rather than processes.
OGJWP reports the processes. It
covers politics shaping legislative and
regulatory proposals for readers with

direct professional interests in all the
personalities and maneuvering that are
involved.
OGJWP thus covers political and
procedural details that OGJ would omit

OGJ recapture the timeliness it sometimes sacrifices while editors pursue
those operational details others omit
and scrub from stories the fluff that fills
so many web pages these days.
Also like the parent, OGJ’s Washington offspring writes and edits from a
strong foundation of industry knowledge and experience. OGJWP’s editor
is veteran Washington energy reporter
Nick Snow.
OGJ readers know Snow’s work. He
has been the magazine’s Washington
correspondent and Watching Government columnist since September 2004.
Until joining the staff full-time last
October, he also worked part-time as a
copy editor at the

Snow holds a journalism degree

an Energy Fellow, Professional Journalism Fellowships (now John S. Knight
Fellowships).

Right combination
Snow knows how to write for savvy
readers. He works fast in multimedia
formats. And he knows the oil and gas
business.
To anyone at OGJ or who knows
OGJ, that’s the right combination. Let us
know what you think of his work. ✦

Candidates and energy
As candidate selection began in the US presidential campaign, two inaugural events yielded
different winners for each of the two main political parties. Victors of the Iowa caucuses and New
Hampshire primary elections can be called frontrunners in their parties’ races for nomination—
but not to the exclusion of candidates concentrating their efforts elsewhere. At this point, no one
can know who will lead his or her party’s ticket in
November.

2007, he called it an example of what

gas emission controls than the agency’s
new national standards.
It was not surprising that the White
House and Congress often were at odds
over energy strategies during 2007
after Democrats assumed control of
both the House and Senate in early
January. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
(D-Calif.) included energy in the bills
passed during the first 100 hr of work
that month. Congressional Democrats
on both sides of the Capitol pushed
20

bills designed to stop alleged gasoline
price gouging and repeal 2005 Energy
Policy Act incentives they considered oil
and gas industry giveaways. But when
they finally sent the 2007 energy bill to
the White House for Bush’s signature,
it raised automotive fuel efficiency
requirements, increased the federal
ethanol mandate, and established new
consumer lighting and other appliance
efficiency standards.
Several House and Senate Democrats
have said they will reintroduce proposals that were not adopted in 2007
because the changes are still needed.
Now that they have had a full year of
working with a Congress where the
Democrats are back in the majority following 12 years of Republican control,
oil and gas industry associations and
their leaders have a better idea of what
they are facing. Their assessments of
2008’s prospects range from guardedly
hopeful to warily grim.

“We’re beginning to see a better
understanding that taxing the oil and
gas industry punitively for its own sake
is counterproductive in many ways,”
American Petroleum Institute Pres. Red
Cavaney observed. He listed three main
reasons: The industry reinvests heavily in its business, consumers feel new
taxes because they are simply passed
through, and taxing an industry with a
proven record to fund new technologies
is risky because there’s no guarantee
that such investments will be as productive.
Cavaney also suggested that federal
lawmakers and their staffs increasingly
recognize the massive role that hydrocarbons play in the nation’s energy mix,
and that alternatives, even growing at
supersonic speeds, won’t be able to take
their place for several decades. “They’re
beginning to understand that energy is
not a pure political football. It has real
effects on real people. We need to get
serious about creating a stable energy
security framework,” he said.

tion Council, said much of the initial congressional activity during the
110th Congress’s first session reflected
Democrats’ pent-up agenda frustration.
“By not being in charge for so long, we
saw a very partisan, very intense release
of that frustration when they regained
control, particularly in the House. With
these energy bills and HR 6, the Democratic leadership exercised surprising
strength in keeping its members in line.
In most votes, fewer than 11 Democrats
broke ranks over punitive legislation,”
he said.
“With this latest energy bill, some
of that frustration may have subsided.
While the leadership still exercised
discipline, we may have seen the first
indication that it recognizes there needs
to be decent policy among the politics.
That makes me hope, going into 2008,
that we might have some breathing

Early versions of congressional legislation would have
seriously inhibited producers’
ability to find oil and gas domestically, Petty said, adding,
“But there are other insidious
efforts to reduce production,
particularly through regulations.”

Hydraulic fracturing
One of these regulations would place
hydraulic fracturing back under federal
water regulation control after it was
excluded from the Safe Drinking Water
Act in 2004 when a study found no
discernible effects. This time, industry
opponents are trying to bring it under
the Clean Water Act’s authority by focusing on producer water from coalbed
methane, which contributes heavily to
domestic natural gas production, Petty
said.
The Independent Petroleum Association of America will continue mobilizing its members to communicate with
members of Congress and encourage
them to develop a progressive energy
policy, IPAA Pres. Barry Russell said. But
the group also recognizes that many
federal lawmakers who have defended
the oil and gas industry will retire at the
end of 2008, particularly in the Senate,
he told OGJ. “We spend a lot of time
working with Democrats from producing states and in the Blue Dog Coalition. But decisions are being made by a
smaller and smaller group,” he said.
Lee O. Fuller, IPAA vice-president of
government relations, noted that the
110th Congress so far has relied on
the leadership more than committees
to develop initiatives, especially in the
House. “Many producing-state Democrats are on committees that have jurisdiction. But if those committees don’t
get to develop policies, it becomes a
very difficult problem,” he said.

48, and large potential resources exist
off the US Atlantic and Pacific coasts,
most of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and
in many sections of the Rocky Mountains, Baker reported.
The US over the last 20 years has
removed much acreage from availability
to oil and gas exploration companies as
leases, dropping from 75% of federal
lands available in 1987 to 17% today, it
said.
“These [unavailable] areas are estimated to contain more than 125 tcf
of natural gas resource, the equivalent
of six times US natural gas demand
in 2006, reported Baker Institute.
“Nearby, Mexico also is home to proven
gas reserves of up to 14.6 tcf and an
estimated 69.2 tcf of undiscovered gas
resource that could be exploited if political barriers to increased investment
could be resolved.”
The Baker report emphasizes the
importance of policymakers’ granting to
oil and gas producers access to currently
locked-up domestic resources, saying
the growth of international trade in LNG
will greatly impact US energy security,
especially when other sources are politically volatile and possibly unpredictable.

The US intends “continued increases
in LNG imports,” said Katharine Ann
Fredriksen, principal deputy assistant
secretary for the Office of Policy and
International Affairs at the US Department of Energy. The primary US LNG
source is Trinidad and Tobago, which
provides 66.7%, with Egypt 20.5%,
Nigeria 9.8%, and Algeria 3% adding to
the supplies.
The Baker report emphasized the
importance of securing sufficient LNG in
the face of burgeoning demand in other
countries such as Mexico, Canada, the
European Union, and Asia-Pacific, particularly India and China where demand
is expected to increase by 3.5%/year.
Factors important in enabling greater
LNG imports will be cooperation
between countries in production and
trade, Fredriksen said, along with greater interactions among governments
and the private sector, and regulatory
certainty.

US elasticity and serve as a backstop
to minimize the impact of a gas cartel,
should one be created.
End-use US gas demand is expected
to climb to 23.9 tcf in 2015 and 26.9
tcf by 2025, up from 20 tcf in 2006. At
the same time, domestic production is
projected to be about 20.8 tcf in 2015
and 21.2 tcf in 2025.
If more federal lands are not opened
up for drilling, the US will have to
rely on imports for 20% of total gas
consumption by 2025, increasing to
31.1% by 2030. Of these volumes,
20-25% would be from the Middle
East. However, the report added, opening the locked-in lands would not lead
to total gas independence. A strategic
gas reserve might be more politically
expedient as would conservation offsets
or “trading” of conservation efforts to
offset productive activities.
The table is the Energy Information
Administration’s short-term Natural
Gas Outlook 2008 forecast made prior
to government policy intervention. EIA
said it will revise its forecast in light of
the recently passed HR 6, the Energy
Independence and Security Act of 2007
signed into law on Dec. 19, 2007.

balancing energy supply and demand,
said Roland George of Canada’s National Energy Board. Ample supplies are
available to meet the country’s needs,
and fossil fuels and other conventional
fuels will continue to dominate.
Canada has 420 tcf of remaining gas
resources, mostly in frontier provinces.
George said conventional gas production from the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) will decline steeply,
with mid-range prices not high enough
to prevent it. Plans call for 25,000 gas
wells to be drilled in WCSB.
Production will increase, however,
in the northern and offshore areas and
from unconventional gas sources. There
will be an influx of LNG imports that
will compensate for the reductions in
WCSB production. He said seven import
terminals are planned and that LNG will
contribute to more than half of Canadian gas requirements by 2030.
The wide range of prices reflect uncertainty, he said, but: “We’re looking at
$5.50-12 (US)/million btu for gas.”
Despite higher energy prices,
demand is expected to increase with
robust increases in population and
the economy—expected to be about
1.8% over the medium-to-short term
(10 years) and as coal is phased out in
Ontario for electricity generation. Long
term, he expects 0.3-1.4% growth as
the economy slows. After 2015, with
advanced technologies, clean coal is
expected to meet more of the energy
demand.
“Canada will continue to be part of
an integrated continental energy market
where the border goes each way,”
George said, emphasizing that Canada
will continue to play a role in continental energy security. “Competition is a
good thing” in North America, he said.
Several enablers will help to successfully overcome energy challenges:
technology that offers solutions to
expanding the boundaries of the conventional resource supply and improve
energy efficiency; governmental policy
that integrates across multiple objectives
of economic growth, environmental
sustainability, and development of the

energy sector; adequate investments to
develop new sources of energy and new
and replacement infrastructure to meet
the growth in energy demand; public
engagement; and high quality analysis
to facilitate timely decision-making.

Alaska gas pipeline proposal progressing
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
TransCanada’s application to build
a natural gas pipeline in Alaska is open
for a 60-day public comment period,
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said. It’s the only

one of five formal applications to meet
all the state’s requirements.
Other applications were submitted by Sinopec of China, AEergia of
California, and two Alaska groups:

the Alaska Natural Gas Development
Authority.
Palin said the public comment period for TransCanada’s proposal began
Jan. 5. Following the allotted period
for comment, she could submit the
proposal to the state legislature, whose
session begins Jan. 15.
“We’re thrilled to have a project
sponsor willing to build a pipeline on
terms that benefit all Alaskans,” Palin
said.
TransCanada proposes a 48-in
pipeline extending from Prudhoe Bay
to Alberta, where it would tie into
existing pipelines that transport gas to
US markets. The project’s estimated cost
is $26-35 billion, and it’s estimated
that—if authorized by lawmakers—the
proposed pipeline could start operation
in 2017.
The proposed pipeline would follow
the route of the existing trans-Alaska

oil pipeline and the Alaska Highway,
and continue through northern British
Columbia to link with the pipeline grid
in north-western Alberta.

State’s role
In 2006, Alaska Gov. Frank
Murkowski reached a privately negotiated pipeline agreement with North
Slope producers ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil Corp., and BP PLC. But that
agreement was dropped when Palin
was elected governor.
Upon taking office in 2007, she
outlined elements of an open bidding
process. The Alaska Gasline Inducement Act (AGIA) calls for the state
to provide $500 million for a gas
pipeline project and fixed tax rates
for 10 years (OGJ, Mar. 12, 2007,
Newsletter). Those incentives are for
a pipeline project that meets state
requirements.

AGIC replaced the Stranded Gas
Development Act, a 1998 law that
allowed companies to apply for state
incentives for a large gas project.
Meanwhile, Palin said the state
continues to review a pipeline proposal from ConocoPhillips that was
made outside the AGIA solicitation.
ConocoPhillips has said a fiscal
terms agreement on gas production
would be needed in order for a gas
pipeline project to proceed. Previously, ExxonMobil and BP made similar
comments, but ExxonMobil and BP
have not submitted any gas pipeline
proposals to Palin.
A ConocoPhillips spokeswoman in
Alaska said Jan. 7 that the company’s
proposal “has the best chance of leading to a successful Alaska gas pipeline
project, and we look forward to working with the state.” ✦

Drilling plans
If the federal export license is
extended, ConocoPhillips agreed to
approve 2008 drilling plans for at least
two wells, and Marathon agreed to ap-

prove a minimum of five wells.
Jim Bowles, president of ConocoPhillips Alaska Inc., said his company
plans to move a rig to Beluga field to
drill two wells this year, and it also

might drill two or three wells from
Tyonek platform.
“Already, it’s kicking off new plans
and new thinking as far as gas development,” Bowles said of the agreement
with the state.
Marathon will drill 5-12 wells as
a result of the agreement, said Steven
Hinchman, the company’s senior vice
president of worldwide production.
ConocoPhillips and Marathon also
agreed to make data available to other
potential oil and gas explorers in the
Cook Inlet region to encourage exploration and development.
The agreement includes a framework for cooperation among the Alaska,
ConocoPhillips, and Marathon on future
applications to the DOE for additional
LNG export authorizations.
A goal is to make at least 30 MMscfd
of plant inlet capacity available for gas
purchased from other producers, the
agreement said. ✦

Bush economic advice includes more domestic E&P
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
US President George W. Bush is
including more domestic oil and gas
exploration in his general economic recommendations as 2008 gets under way.
Bush reiterated his opposition to
new taxes and voiced concern over
impacts from the housing crisis. But
he also noted that gasoline prices have
risen and that consumers are feeling
financially pinched.
“There is no quick fix. As a matter of
fact, I signed good legislation, passed
by Republicans and Democrats, that enables us to begin to diversify away from
oil and gas, and that’s good,” he said on
Jan. 7, referring to the 2007 energy bill
he approved on Dec. 17.
“But the diversification isn’t going
to happen overnight. We ought to be
exploring for more oil and gas in the
United States of America, and I’m con28

vinced we can do so in environmentally
friendly ways,” Bush told the Union
League Club of Chicago.
At a Jan. 4 meeting of his working
group on financial markets in Washington, the president said Congress
and the administration will need to
work together keep taxes low. Raising
taxes when the economy is strong but

indicators are mixed would be a serious
mistake, he maintained.
“Secondly, we have got to understand
that if we are worried about gasoline
prices, we ought to expand refineries
here in the United States, and we ought
to explore for oil and gas in environmentally friendly ways in the United
States,” Bush continued. ✦

US House to lose major natural gas advocate

US Rep. John E. Peterson (R-Pa.),
one of the House’s strongest advocates
for expanding natural gas production
from the Outer Continental Shelf, announced on Jan. 3 that he won’t run
for reelection in 2008.
Peterson, who plans to serve out his
term, said that “a few chronic, non-

threatening health issues have to be
addressed at home, requiring me to devote more time to my family, time and
presence which would not be possible
if I sought reelection.”
While his initial impact after being elected to his first House term in
1996 was in securing services for rural
Americans, Peterson defied conventional wisdom in early 2005 when he gave
a floor speech urging an end to federal

OCS leasing bans that had been in place

He and Rep. Neil Abercrombie
(D-Hi.) cosponsored bills in 2006
and 2007 to lift the moratoria, dedicate fixed portions of resulting federal
royalties to environmental restoration
projects and renewable energy research,
and share part of those royalties with
producing states feeling the impacts.
Minority Whip Roy Blunt (R-Mo.)
noted that when he and Peterson
arrived to begin their first terms in
January 1997, crude oil cost $23/bbl,
gasoline cost $1.25/gal and natural gas
cost about $2/Mcf.
“More than a decade later, with oil
in triple-digits and American manufacturers being forced overseas by spiraling natural gas costs, John’s message of
responsible energy development may be
more relevant and important today than
ever before,” Blunt continued.
Before his election to the US House,
Peterson was a Pennsylvania state senator during 1985-96, a member of the
state’s house in 1977-84, and a Pleasantville Borough Council member for

New BLM fee:
a precedent?

T

he US Bureau of Land Management announced Jan. 2 that it
will collect a $4,000 processing fee
for each new oil and gas drilling
permit application. Rocky Mountain producers warn of a dangerous
precedent.
December’s omnibus spending
bill made the fee part of the Department of the Interior’s fiscal 2008
budget. “The House was insisting
on it. The Senate was against it. What
made the difference was that the
White House came out in favor of
it,” said Bob Gallagher, director of
the New Mexico Oil & Gas Association in Santa Fe.
He asked BLM’s public affairs
office how language in the 2005
Energy Policy Act prohibiting BLM
from recovering such costs affect the
fee. Spokesman Tom Gorey responded
that the omnibus spending bill
specifies it is a processing, not a costrecovery, fee.
“The money generated by these
fees is not new revenue but rather a
reimbursement to the US Treasury
for the estimated cost of processing
new APDs [applications for permits
to drill] for the duration of fiscal
year 2008,” BLM said in a press
release.

Bigger question
“They used the word ‘reimbursement’ in their press release, but it
looks a lot like recovery,” Gallagher
told me. “We don’t believe their language legally gets them over the provision. The bigger question is where
it will stop. If you have cost recovery
for APDs, do you also allow it for
rights-of-way or other procedures?”

Tim Spisak, who heads BLM’s
fluid minerals division, said Congress
reduced the agency’s oil and gas operations budget by $25.5 million and
created a new APD appropriation for
that amount. “It put in a mechanism
to collect a processing fee and tied
it to a reimbursement for the appropriation. BLM gets the same funding
level; it’s just broken up into two different funds,” he explained.
But Marc W. Smith, executive director of the Independent Petroleum
Association of Mountain States in
Denver, said the fee increases the cost
of processing a document without
improving the level of service.

‘A new tax’
“It’s a new tax on domestic energy
production. More important, it
doesn’t address any of the ongoing
needs of the BLM offices that are trying to keep up processing drilling applications and managing other public
lands needs,” he maintained.
“Right now, there’s no promise it
actually will go to BLM. The money

BMI: Venezuela still vital Latin American oil supplier
Eric Watkins
Senior Correspondent
Venezuela will account for just
8.04% of Latin American oil demand
by 2011 while providing about 28.24%
of its oil supply by then, according to a
recent analyst report.
Business Monitor International’s
Venezuela Oil & Gas Report claims that
Latin America regional oil demand rose
to 7.15 million b/d in 2006. It said the
region should average 7.33 million b/d
in 2007 and then rise to 8.15 million
b/d by 2011. Regional oil production
was 10.58 million b/d in 2006. It is set
to rise to 11.51 million b/d by 2011.
The region consumed 179 billion cu
m (bcm) of natural gas in 2006, with
demand of 268 bcm targeted for 2011,
representing 50% growth. Production
of 175 bcm in 2006 should reach 274
bcm in 2011 and implies just 6 bcm of
net exports at the end of the period.
Venezuela contributed about 16.04%
to 2006 regional gas consumption,
while producing 16.35%. By 2011, it is
expected to consume 17.92% of the region’s gas, while contributing 17.50%
to supply.
BMI assumes oil and gas liquids
production of no more than 3.25 million b/d by 2011, with the country
expected to produce 2.65 million b/d
in 2007. Consumption is forecast to
increase by around 3%/year to 2011,
implying demand of 655,000 b/d.
The report said Venezuela’s export
capability would be about 2.6 million
b/d by 2011, while gas production is
forecast to rise to 48 bcm over the period from 28.7 bcm in 2006 matched
by equivalent consumption.
Crude oil export revenues are
estimated at $48.30 billion for 2007,
assuming an OPEC basket price of
$64/bbl. Based on BMI’s assumption
of $61/bbl crude in 2008, $55/bbl
in 2009, and an average $50/bbl in
2010-11, crude oil export revenues
30

will be $44.96-47.35 billion during
the period. Gas export potential exists
beyond 2011.
In the BMI business environment
rankings matrix, Venezuela received a
composite score of 30, ranking it sixth
out of nine states included in the region.
“The overall business environment
can be considered no better than neutral in a regional context, in spite of the
country’s perceived high level of longterm economic risk, plus the demanding licensing and production-sharing
regime,” it said.
While recent changes in taxation
and its licensing system have reduced
foreign involvement in Venezuela,
several key players appear committed to
the country while others are reassessing
their involvement.
Meanwhile, BMI said the country has
“considerable untapped hydrocarbons
potential, with a high reserves-to-production ratio, significant output growth
potential, and an established competitive framework.”
Drawing attention to some of that
potential, BMI cited statements of state
oil firm Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), which claimed in June 2007 that
a study conducted by US engineering
firm Ryder Scott has determined that
Carabobo Block 3 in Venezuela’s Orinoco belt holds 28.65 billion bbl of oil.
The firm said the block may hold

proved reserves of 5.7 billion bbl, based
on the expectation that 20% of the oil
deposits can be recovered.
Venezuela is trying to verify the vast
reserves of the Orinoco extra-heavy
crude belt, as the government is negotiating majority stakes in the Orinoco
projects, which were forcefully nationalized by President Hugo Chavez.
BMI also noted that Venezuela may be
inflating its reserves claims. “In spite of
recent underinvestment and reduced international oil company involvement, Venezuela claims that its proven oil reserves
have risen to 100 billion bbl. This is well
in excess of most external estimates.”
The country’s energy and oil ministry said it has certified 12.4 billion
additional bbl of proved reserves in the
country’s Faja del Orinoco region, where
the government assumed control of oil
ventures with IOCs earlier in 2007.
In Carabobo Blocks 2, 3, and 4, in
the Orinoco region, surveyors have certified 20.1 billion bbl of proved crude
oil reserves and more than 140 bcm of
gas reserves, BMI said, citing a government statement.
In the Orinoco Magna Reserve project, meanwhile, the Chavez government
expects to certify more than 200 billion
bbl of crude oil reserves, which—if
correct—would give Venezuela the
largest hydrocarbons reserves in the
world. ✦

South Korea to ban single-hull tankers by 2011
Eric Watkins
Senior Correspondent
The South Korean government will
ban the entry of single-hulled tankers
into its waters starting in 2011, about
5 years earlier than originally planned,
as the Asian nation continues to suffer
from the effects of its worst-ever oil
spill on Dec. 7, 2007.
“We can implement the ban sooner

than planned following the oil spill,”
said an official of South Korea’s Ministry
of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, referring to the collision between the very
large crude carrier Hebei Spirit and a
barge off the country’s west coast.
Massive clean-up efforts are still
under way and the South Korean government has yet to release a damage
estimate or how much the clean-up will
cost.

The South Koreans had originally
planned to prevent single-hulled vessels, considered more spill-prone that
double-hulled ships, from entering
their waters in 2015—a start date lobbied for by the nation’s oil industry and
ministry of commerce.
Modern tankers are fitted with two
hulls to reduce the risk of an oil spill,
and are usually more expensive to hire.

Hebei Spirit spill
The Hebei Spirit was fitted with
one hull, according to Lloyd’s RegisterFairplay, which assigns ship-registration
numbers. An international ban on such
ships is due to start in 2010, with South
Korea one of 146 nations that pledged
to uphold the ban.
But last month’s disaster has prompted the change of policy in Seoul as
the collision between the barge and
the Hong Kong-registered supertanker
caused 10,500 tonnes of oil to spill into
the waters off the South Korean coast.
The spill is the worst in South Korea’s history and is the biggest anywhere since the Tasman Spirit leaked
about 27,000 tonnes of oil at the port
of Karachi in Pakistan in July 2003,
according to Tim Wadsworth, technical
support manager for the International
Tanker Owners Pollution Federation Ltd.
The Hebei Spirit leak was estimated
at almost a third of the 37,000 tons
spilled into Alaska’s Prince William
Sound by the Exxon Valdez in 1989, according to ITOPF.
At the time of the Hebei disaster,
reports said South Korea was struggling
to contain the spillage, which occurred
near Hyundai Oilbank Co.’s refinery on
the nation’s west coast.
The South Korean government dispatched 30 patrol boats, 4 helicopters,
and 10 oil-spill control vessels to the
site where the collision punched three
holes on the ship’s side and spilled the
oil, according to the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries.
Although the Hebei Spirit had
stopped leaking by then, the slick from
the spill was estimated at 7.4 km long
and 2 km wide.

Iran provokes
US, Turkey

S

hould the oil and gas industry
worry about an ankle-biter? That’s
what Iran seems like these days after
the administration of US President
George W. Bush reversed its view of
the Iranians’ nuclear pretentions.
Yet, just last week, Bush said Iran
had committed “a provocative act”
in the Strait of Hormuz when Iranian
speedboats approached three US navy
ships and threatened that the ships
would explode.
“It’s a dangerous situation and
they should not have done it, pure
and simple,” Bush said. “I don’t know
what their thinking was but I’m telling you what I think it was.” He said,
“It was a provocative act.”
The Strait of Hormuz, the most
prominent choke point in the global
crude oil trade, handles 17 million
b/d of the world’s water-borne crude
oil, more than a third of total shipments.
Iran is well aware of the effect that
adverse moves in the region have
on oil markets, but it dismissed US
concerns about the incident, calling it
routine for both sides.

Iran has suspended supplies of
natural gas to Turkey due to a cold
weather front that brought a sharp
fall in temperatures, rain and snow
in the region, according to Turkish
television reports.
Under a contract signed in 1996,
Iran must ensure daily supplies of 28
million cu m of natural gas to Turkey
via a 2,500-km pipeline connecting
the two countries.
“Despite its pledge to ensure
uninterrupted supply of natural gas
during the winter, Iran failed to meet
its obligations in the past 10 days
and fully stopped energy supplies,”
said Turkey’s Minister of Energy and
Natural Resources Hilmi Guler.

Shivering in Turkey

Iran has in the past halted natural
gas deliveries to Turkey several times
during the winter citing increased
domestic demand for the fuel.
Turkey has never built domestic
fuel storage facilities and always compensated for the shortage of exports
from Iran with additional supplies
from Russia and other countries.
NTV television said Guler would

Per Mansson, a tanker broker at Nor
Ocean Stockholm AB, said South Korean
oil companies are probably the world’s
biggest users of single-hull tankers, but
that the collision might cause a change
of policy in South Korea that would
have a tremendous effect on the market.
South Korea, along with India, dominates the fixture lists of single-hull tankers, which no longer trade to Europe
and North American ports.
Some 60% of crude imported to
South Korea is shipped on single-hull
tankers, about two to three times the
market average, according to a report

by Citigroup Global Markets. The report
said 173 single-hull tankers were fixed
until mid-December to South Korea,
from the 628 single-hull VLCC fixtures
in 2007.
Within days of the spill, the demand
for double-hulled VLCCs rose. In its
weekly report on tanker shipping rates,
EA Gibson said the collision and oil spill
“could be a trigger for a major shift in
the tanker industry.”
Analysts also said that smaller
number of available large tankers, and
higher daily rates to charter them,
could prompt many charters to split

their cargoes on to smaller ships such
as Aframaxes, leading to increased rates
for these vessels as well.
Meanwhile, Hyundai Oilbank, the
company that received the oil from the
single-hull Hebei Spirit, has already
indicated it plans to change its own
chartering practices.
In a statement, Hyundai Oilbank,
while awaiting government directives
on single-hulled ships, said it would
revise its chartering policy following
the Hebei Spirit spill by increasing the
number of double-hulled VLCC chartering. ✦

A formal environmental assessment

The expansion had been mentioned

Rising demand for natural gas in the
US and an uncertain outlook for imports make the search for new domestic
reserves both urgent and economically
attractive. Few regions of the world are
as extensively explored as the lower 48
states, yet there remain a small number
of frontier areas of the first rank with
proven hydrocarbon potential.
Among these, the most underexplored by far is the Columbia River
basin (CRB) of south-central Washington State (Fig. 1). This 60,000 sq
mile province, larger than most Rocky
Mountain basins, is also unique in
geologic character, complexity, and gas
prospectivity.
It was the target of important, if
intermittent, industry interest from the
1950s to the 1980s, when several companies led by Standard of California and
Shell drilled a remarkably courageous
series of deep wildcats attempting to
penetrate thousands of feet of basalt in
hopes of encountering thick Eocene
reservoirs beneath.
Now, a new round of activity is under way. The first phase of this activity
involved three deep tests, drilled between 2005 and 2007 by EnCana Corp.,
providing important confirmation of
basin potential and adding significantly
to understanding of the CRB. The next
phase of work, currently in progress,
involves an impressive technical effort
spearheaded by Exxel Energy Corp. of
Houston. Results of these efforts not
only justify further drilling but reconsideration of two older wells as possible
reentry candidates.
The present article is intended to
summarize some of the ideas and
information that contribute to this
conclusion. As such, it is aimed at
updating previous publications on the
hydrocarbon potential of the basin,1 2
including the author’s own.3 The writing of this report has benefited greatly
from selected access to data provided by
Exxel Energy, a major participant in the
CRB play.

Exploration history
The current round of drilling represents only the second time modern
exploration methods have been applied
to the CRB.
During the 1980s, Shell, Meridian, Arco, Chevron, Exxon, and several
independent operators were involved
in detailed study of the province. Their

New exploration concepts highlight
Columbia River basin’s potential
analyses, based on surface mapping in
surrounding areas, as well as data from
a few older wells plus seismic, gravity, and magnetotelluric (MT) surveys
within the CRB proper, yielded a preliminary basin model.
Several key aspects of this model
are worth reviewing. Shell et al. verified the existence of three graben-like
subbasins filled by Eocene fluvial
deposits (Swauk/Manastash/Herren
and Roslyn/Naches/Chumstick formations) and Oligocene volcanogenic and
siliciclastic rocks (Ohanepechosh and
Wenatchee formations, respectively),
overlain by Miocene flood basalts.
Thickness of the basalt was difficult to
predict at the time, but data strongly
suggested it increased substantially into
the subbasin lows.
Major structures included basement
horsts and long, narrow, late-stage folds
(Yakima fold belt) bounded by shallow
thrust faults that appeared to steepen
with depth. Based on field study, reservoir quality was expected to be highest
in the Swauk and possibly the Roslyn
intervals. Surface structures were interpreted to continue at depth. The model
did not incorporate the possibility of a
basin-centered gas accumulation, as this
concept was not yet articulated.
Shell and partners drilled eight wells,
mainly to test Yakima fold belt structures. Five of these penetrated into the
prospective Tertiary reservoir section.

margins and hundreds of wells drilled
in both eastern and western Washington
(many wells in western Washington
penetrate the identical Tertiary stratigraphic sequence as exists in the CRB).
The result, compared with interpretations based on only one or two data
types (e.g., MT and well correlations)
is a greatly enhanced ability to image
and characterize the subbasalt section.
Improved delineation is now possible of
such key parameters as basalt thickness,
subbasin geometry, structural style,
burial history, and reservoir distribution.

is present in thin (5-20 ft) sands below
12,500 ft depth, again suggesting that
migration was an important inhibiting
factor on diagenetic processes.
The Teanaway is a nonmarine, volcaniclastic unit at the base of the Roslyn
that appears to have tested gas and very
high volumes of water in the Yakima
1-33 well over a thick perforated interval. In the central and southern portions
of the CRB, net sandstone in the Roslyn

alone averages 2,100 ft, testifying to a
very large gas resource.

Structural style
Three types of dominant structures
exist: horst-like basement uplifts; a
system of NW-SE dextral, oblique-slip
faults; and a set of east-west folds commonly bounded by low-displacement
thrusts. A number of basement uplifts
and also the boundaries of subbasin

lows are defined by the NW-SE fault
system and its weaker NE-SW conjugate
set (Fig. 3).
Thrusted folds in the basalt have a
complex, variable relationship to structures at depth. In some areas, thrusts are
detached, while in others they may be
rooted in older, basement faults. In general, it is now speculated that much of
the basalt cover responded as a separate
structural entity relative to the underlying sedimentary section. New analysis
of seismic and other data suggests that
ramp-type geometries are prevalent in
certain parts of the basin (Fig. 4).
These interpretations, which revise
previous ideas of basin structure, highlight new kinds of prospects, including
those where conventional traps and the
basin-centered accumulation may be
superimposed. Despite the existence of
brecciated basalt at the surface, faults
are interpreted to be sealing at depth
within the Tertiary section, based on
analogy (e.g., to Oregon’s Mist field).
Base of basalt is reliably predicted from
a combination of integrated geochemical stratigraphy, gravity and magnetic
data, well correlations, and mapping of
individual flow geometries within the
basalt section.

Trap types
As suggested by Fig. 5, there are a
minimum of five trap types in the CRB.
These include:
1. Basement highs.
2. Thrust-related closures.
3. Subthrust (upturned) beds.

Peak oil models show
a widening gap between
China’s oil demand and
production. The generalized Weng model
predicts a peak oil proProduction
duction in China of 196
million tonnes in 2026
and the Hubbert model indicates a peak
oil demand in 2034 of 633 million
tonnes.
Because forecasts indicate a widening
gap between production and demand,
China’s government is undertaking
various measures to reduce this gap and
more measures will be needed in the
future. In 2006, China imported 47% of
the oil it consumed.
For predicting future oil production
and demand in China, this article shows
the results of three peak oil models:
Hubbert, Generalized Weng, and HCZ.

O D U C T I O N

and Zhang Shengzong developed the
HCZ model in 1995.5
The Hubbert model has been applied
widely in the world, while application
of the Generalized Weng and HCZ model has been limited to mostly China.
Although all these models forecast
reserves and production of oil fields,
they are seldom used to predict oil
demand. Based on the theory that everything in the world
follows the natural
process of “risegrow-mature-decay,”
we believe demand
of oil would follow
the same pattern
and predicting oil
demand with these models is feasible.
Table 1, shows the equations used in
the three forecast models.

Oil reserves
With improvement of technology
and knowledge, China’s discovered reserves have increased steadily (Fig. 1).
The increase of oil reserves in China
can be divided into five stages:
1. 1907-49, oil discoveries in the
Ordos basin and a few other areas.
2. 1950-64, large reserves found in
the Songliao basin.
3. 1965-75, Bohai Bay basin development.
4. 1976-90, exploration and development in the east, offshore, and west.
5. After 1990, development began
in the Tarim, Junggar, and Ordos basins,
with production still increasing in these
basins.
According to a 2005 assessment of
oil and gas resources, China has 21.2
billion tonnes of recoverable reserves.

From 1949 to
1957, oil production in China
was less than 10
million tonnes/
year (tpy). With
the discovery of
Daqing oil field,
oil production
increased continually in the 1960s
and surpassed 20
million tonnes in
1969. The discoveries in Bohai
Bay basin and the
44

additional production in Daqing
in the 1970s
increased oil production by 10 million tpy, with production surpassing
100 million tpy in
1978.
Although
the production
increase slowed
after the 1980s, it
reached 184 million tpy in 2006

(Fig. 2).
The oil fields in the eastern China

are the main contributors to China’s
oil production, but with the extensive
exploration and development of the
Songliao and Bohai Bay basins, the
production in the east has started a
downtrend from the 1980s (Fig. 3). In
1984, eastern China produced 94% of
China’s oil, but this had decreased to
63% in 2004.
The decreasing oil production trend
in the main oil producing areas after 30
years of increasing reserves and production means that a new stage of development for China oil industry has started.6
The percent of China’s oil produced
in middle and western areas has increased from 6% to 23% in the last 20

Systems approach

James Weith

Peoria, Ariz.

The systems approach
to start-up helps reduce
construction man-hours
by eliminating duplication of effort, which is
useful in itself. It is an
Refining
extension of the systems
approach to construction, which involves the precommissioning team working closely with
construction, beginning with the
hydrotest of the systems.
The real benefit, however, is allowing customers access to the systems
sooner so that they may begin to
make use of them and keep their
workloads more uniform during
precommissioning of the project. The
Construction Industry Institute (CII)
is correct in stressing that the systems
approach must be implemented before
construction begins, so that all parties
are committed to it.
The prioritization of the systems
through implementation of the Precommissioning Intensity Index should
be performed as early in the project as
possible. Doing so can eliminate much
time, money, and operator and maintenance stress.

such as a debutanizer complete with its
reboiler, overhead condenser, accumulator, and all other associated exchangers,
pumps and piping—or as small as the
cooling-water distribution piping for its
overhead condenser.
The construction industry has been
building process units on a system basis
for years. Now the CII has established
a concept for precommissioning plants
on a system basis as well.
Precommissioning is defined as
all the activities required to prepare a
system for commissioning and start-up
such as punch listing, cleaning, flushing, loading of packing and catalyst,
and final assembly and closure of
equipment. With proper controls, air
freeing or inerting of equipment could
be included as part of the precommissioning phase.
Commissioning is defined as actually putting those systems into service.
If the equipment in a system was not
inerted at the end of the precommissioning phase, it definitely must be at
the beginning of the commissioning
phase before normal operating fluids
(hydrocarbons, for instance) could be
brought in.

Systems

Constructing by systems

Any particular process unit in a refinery is an assembly of many systems,
each of which consists of a group of
equipment with interconnecting piping
and instrumentation that collectively
serves to perform a specific function or
purpose. This can be something as large
as a complete fractionation system—

A system consists of a group of
equipment with interconnecting piping
and instrumentation that collectively
serves to perform a specific function or
purpose.
Because of this common purpose,
all of the piping in a system is usually
fabricated from the same line class.

systems in an orderly manner, which
also facilitates operator training. Startups will also be smoother because the
operators are not tired and stressed
from long periods of overtime.
The benefit to the contractor for this
is a longer construction time frame.
Instead of having to complete construction typically 6 weeks or more before
start-up, end of construction on the last
few systems can be as late as a couple
of weeks before start-up. Average end
of construction is therefore only 2-3
weeks before start-up, which gives construction 3-4 more weeks to work.
This does require making some of
the utility systems “hot” during construction, which requires extra safety
precautions and vigilance. Although
use by the owner does not mean commissioning of systems, there are some
exceptions.
Typically those are steam, condensate, instrument air, and electrical
power—utilities that are required for
functional testing of the equipment. All
of these are hazardous because of their
50

high energy potential. But steam is the
most onerous because it can also cause
severe burns. Insulation on it must
therefore be complete before it can be
put into service.
A prime example of this occurred
in the fall and winter of 1977 when I
was the project manager for what was
then Plateau, Inc., for the relocation of
an fluid catalytic cracking unit from
Winnipeg, Man., to Bloomfield, NM.
Due to the death of the original field
superintendent followed by a series
of failed attempts at replacements, the
construction force had essentially no
direction and was confused about what
to do next.
At this point I divided the main
column and gas concentration unit into
systems so that construction workers
could focus on one section at a time.
The depropanizer and propane-drying
column was one section, the debutanizer was the next section, the recovery
section was the third, and the main
column with all of its pumparounds
was the fourth section.

We started with the depropanizer. As
soon as it was complete, the operators
performed the hydrotest and flushing
with that system’s pumps and worked
forward through the plant to the debutanizer, followed by the recovery section
and then the main column.
By this point, I had assumed the position of acting field superintendent for
the contractor as well, and was developing priorities and work lists for each
section. This unique situation allowed
the required coordination to make this
approach work.
Another unique facet of this project
was that we operated the main column
and gas concentration unit as a crude
unit for 16 weeks while the regular
crude unit was being revamped to
produce the required feed for the FCC.
I did not realize it at the time, but this
allowed me to make use of operations
and maintenance staffs.
By the time the crude unit was back
on line and the FCC reactor structure
was complete, we had all of the bugs
worked out of the downstream portion

of the FCC, and the operators were very
familiar with its operation.
Although this was an extreme case of
making use of systems, it is the epitome
of what it means. When we pulled the
blind on the reactor vapor line to start
feed to the riser, we only had to worry
about and concentrate on the operator’s first-time exposure to circulating
catalyst and operating an FCC reactor
and regenerator.

and diesel product blending systems.
Through careful evaluation and systemization of the lines and their tie-ins,
we developed a strategy to implement
the tie-ins in both product-blending
areas without any effect on their day-today blending operations.

Optimize the schedule
Although it is easy to see graphically that the new method promoted by
CII makes a lot of sense, there is really
much more to it. Just completing the
systems in a phased approach still does
not optimize the completion of the
construction and precommissioning
phases of the project.
Proper optimization will determine
which systems should be completed
first and which ones can be completed
last. Because some systems are much
more complex than others, it is simply
practical to complete and precommission them first, to keep them from
becoming critical.
Fig. 2 shows this. Precommissioning requirements and time involved on
some complex systems will take longer
than on simple systems. Some systems
might be more important than others, and they too should be completed
earlier rather than later.
On some large projects there will
undoubtedly be many complex systems.
In that case, it is practical to intersperse
them among some simpler systems so
that operations does not have to deal
with too many complex systems at the
same time, and it helps to smooth the
customer’s workforce.
During the winter 1999-2000, myself, a team of three other process engineers, and a score of pipe designers was
charged with designing 350 tie-ins in
the off site areas required for the startup of a large refinery expansion on the
Canadian East Coast. These were for the
new feed and product lines between the
new units and the existing tanks and for
new lines and manifolds in the gasoline

worksheet used.
The systems are prioritized from left
to right. Critical tie-ins for each system
are in the center of the figure. Once we
established those tie-ins, that whole
system could be isolated to install the
rest of its tie-ins. In this manner, only
one blending pump was taken out of

service at any time. Because each pump
was manifolded with at least one other
pump, it was possible to work systematically through the systems without
interfering with the blending operation.
This was a successful effort to prioritize and manage the work to the benefit
of the refiner, which up until then

We had a natural gas source in a
nearby unit and installed a temporary

cure during a holiday weekend, when
no construction workers were in the

The vendor did this without having
to completely head up any of the vessels. This completely removed the cure
and all of the systems required for it

an expedient decision because the air

however, we did not have to perform
the cure or the always debatably and

Although there are successes with
the systems approach to start-ups, there
are also difficulties. Even though the
benefits for its use are obvious, there
are a few things that can still trip it up.

Plant owners must beware of:
• The contractor’s field supervisors. Even
though the contractor’s general managers might have bought into the program
wholeheartedly from the beginning,
many times their field supervisors have
not. It takes much effort and determination to keep it going. Because they are
charged with showing progress with
good productivity, they will be hesitant to try something new. They would
prefer to gang a whole geographic area
of the plant to minimize their resources
before relocating those resources to
move onto the next section.
What really happens in the field,
therefore, is to construct the plant in
whole blocks until about 70% completion, and then move to systems. It is
at this point that the issue must be
emphasized.
• The engineering group. The owner and
contractor can agree on the systems
approach, but the contractor will be

unable to implement it if the detailed
engineering is incomplete. This can be
a problem with fast-tracked jobs. This
may mean the owner must be flexible
and willing to do some trading between
systems to accomplish the end result.
• Equipment vendors and process licensors.
Everything can be going perfectly until
vendors and licensors show up, because
when they do, they want to punch out
everything that has to do with their
equipment or process. That can confuse
and demoralize contractors, because
they can begin receiving punch lists for
systems that have not yet been completed or turned over.
The owner can be taking a lot of
care with the contractor and then have
the whole thing blow up over this. The
owner must act as a filter between them
and the contractor.
• Instrument and electrical technicians.
Of all of the maintenance crafts, this
one presents the greatest obstacle.

Instrument technicians are resistant to
performing individual system loop and
continuity checks on a daily basis. They
would rather wait until the end of the
week, and then do them all. It takes a
strong maintenance supervisor to overcome this inertia. ✦

GAS TURBINES—1

A two-stage supersonic ejector can capture
low-pressure gas such as
that being vented from a
typical first stage dryPipelines
gas seal, and discharge
it for re-injection into
a higher-pressure stream at 3,400 kPa
(atmospheric) for fuel-gas utilization.
The ejector device seeks to capture
gas leakage from
a dry-gas seal at
low pressure and
reinject it into the
fuel-gas line to
the gas generator
(without the use
of compressors or
rotating elements), allowing the use of
gas that would otherwise be vented to
atmosphere. This device eliminates costs
associated with gas loss and reduces
greenhouse gas emitted by the dry-gas
seal to the atmosphere.
Leakage gas pressure of 70-340 kPa
(gauge) presents one of the primary
problems mitigating against reaching
these goals, with a minimum pressure
required downstream of fuel-gas regulators of 2,400-3,400 kPag.
The device consists of a two-stage
supersonic ejector. The first stage is
highly supersonic (nozzle exit Mach

Several tests conducted on various configurations of the two stages
on natural gas arrived at the optimum
design and operating parameters. The
optimum design gave an expansionpressure ratio (motive:suction) on the
order of 14.0 and compression pressure
ratio (discharge:suction) of around 8.1.
These ratios would meet the requirement of minimum suction and discharge pressure mentioned above.
This first part of two articles summarizes the optimum configuration
arrived at after several iterations of
different geometries of the supersonic
nozzles, particularly for the firststage ejector. The second, concluding
article presents the performance-test
results of the integrated system and
describes a successful implementation
of the supersonic ejector unit at one

Ejectors have the advantage of no
moving parts. No seals, no shafts, no
packing, and therefore no maintenance also stand out as distinct advantages over mechanical compressors or
vacuum pumps, which often require
elaborate maintenance programs. Their

design enable reliable, maintenance-free

higher pressure than the process gas being sealed for flow to occur. Overhung
compressors require just one dry seal,
allowing seal supply gas to be drawn
from the compressor discharge, filtered,
and supplied in a steady flow to the seal
capsule.
Most seal supply gas reenters the
process cavity, with a small volume
(leakage) passing through the seal faces
and venting to atmosphere. The amount
of gas leakage depends on the process
pressure and rotating shaft diameter.
Fig. 1 gives an example matrix of the
order of magnitude of gas leakage from
a typical first stage dry-gas seal.
Current supersonic ejector development focuses on providing a means of
capturing gas leakage and reinjecting it

A variable throat diffuser can swallow standing shock13 14 but complicated
design too badly to be used in this application. A diffuser throat made slightly
larger than needed instead kept standing shock either slightly downstream of
the diffuser throat or at the throat itself.
Computational fluid dynamics analysis carried out to discern the flow field,
accompanied by extensive testing of
various configurations, helped reach the
optimum design of a fixed-geometry
diffuser that could work with different
nozzles of different throat area. Previous literature presented both the results
of these efforts14 and the methodology
used to arrive at the optimum configuration.
The optimized nozzle-diffuser arrangement showed the nozzle clear
from a standing shock wave and
achieving good suction. The diffuser section’s shock wave region (the

First stage

Satisfying the relatively low suction
pressure to match the dry-gas seal leakage pressure (~400 kPa-a) in the context of this discussion requires an ejector with a highly supersonic exit flow,
bringing with it the problem associated
with compressing the same supersonic
flow after entraining the dry-gas seal
leakage gas in a supersonic diffuser. Fig.

and fabricated in an attempt to reduce
the likelihood of a shock wave at the

ejector with this nozzle size in terms of
expansion ratio (P1:P2), compression

The second-stage ejector’s size and
design allowed it to use full line gas
pressure as motive gas without throttling and discharge at a pressure (Pout)

flow to the second stage is the exit flow
from the first-stage ejector.

RECOVERY METHODS

™

September 30 – October 2, 2008
Hilton Fort Worth
Fort Worth, Texas USA

THE RETHINKING CONTINUES
By rethinking recovery methods, producers have brought to a hungry market gas from reservoirs once considered economically and
technically impossible. Tight sands, shales, and coalbeds now represent large and growing sources of an essential form of clean energy.
But they’re still unconventional. The reservoirs are complex. The costs of drilling into and completing
wells in them are high and rising. They present unique environmental problems.
Producing gas from unconventional reservoirs proﬁtably, safely, and in amounts demanded by the
market requires continuous rethinking – the kind of thinking that shoves back limits on what’s possible
with gas supply.
Rethinking of recovery methods will continue Sept. 30 – Oct. 2, 2008, at the Unconventional Gas
International Conference & Exhibition at the Hilton Fort Worth in Fort Worth, Texas. Planned by editors
of Oil & Gas Journal and an advisory board of industry experts, the event will highlight innovation
from unconventional gas plays around the world. It will be your chance to meet and learn from other
professionals in the fastest-growing sector of the gas-producing industry.
So mark your calendar.
Plan to attend the ﬁrst annual Unconventional Gas International Conference & Exhibition.

Candidates test
limits of unruly
energy utterance
On energy, US Democratic presidential
hopefuls are testing the limits of unruly
utterance.
For many months, Sen. Hillary Clinton
of New York led what seems to be a contest
in this area with her proposal to tax oil
and gas so the government can spend $50
billion on alternative fuels (OGJ, Nov. 19,
2007, p. 17).
More recently, the two candidates who

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

beat Clinton in the Iowa caucuses have
been whipping her as well in energy demagoguery.
When the crude oil futures price topped
$100/bbl during trading in New York Jan.
2, John Edwards called the event “another
example of how corporate greed is squeezing the middle class.”
He said the increase “shows the urgency of taking on the big oil companies
so we can build a new energy economy
and transition away from oil to other
affordable sources of energy,” which he
didn’t identify.
Tracking to the central theme of his
populist campaign, Edwards declared,
“It’s time for us to rise up and take on the
corporate greed that is taking over our democracy so we can leave a better America
to our children.”
In Iowa, Edwards won second place
behind Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois, who
has his own strange energy voice.
“I’ll be a president who harnesses the
ingenuity of farmers and scientists and
entrepreneurs to free this nation of the
tyranny of oil once and for all,” he said in
his victory speech.
Apparently, Obama saw no contradiction between that promise and his assertion
just moments earlier that “the time has
come to tell the lobbyists who think their
money and their inﬂuence speak louder
than our voices that they don’t own this
government; we do, and we are here to
take it back.”
Let’s connect the dots and ﬁll in the
missing word here: farmers, lobbyists,
money...ethanol! No tyranny there, of
course.
This is the candidate who wants the
federal government to spend $150 billion
over 10 years on “clean energy”—a sure
way to run lobbyists out of town if ever
there was one.
All for “our children,” no doubt.

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

Oil ﬁnally tops $100/bbl
For the ﬁrst time ever, a front-month crude contract hit $100/bbl Jan. 2 before
closing at $99.62/bbl, up $3.64 for the day in the initial trading session of 2008 on
the New York Mercantile Exchange. The previous intraday high for front-month crude
was $99.29/bbl Nov. 21.
The February contract climbed to $100.09/bbl Jan. 3 on NYMEX before slipping
to a $99.18/bbl close. However, Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland, claimed the Jan. 3 record marked “the ﬁrst real attempt to break the [$100/bbl]
mythical level,” since the Jan. 2 sale “was only a controversial one-lot transaction
done on the ﬂoor away from computer trading.” Jakob said, “The three-digit number
provided strong resistance, but with a late buying wave maintaining the close within
$1 of $100/bbl, we would expect to see further attempts at breaking it.”
Jakob said, “Technically the positive momentum is still valid, and the risk remains
for a strong advance when and if [a closing price of] $100/bbl is [achieved], as the
next target will then jump to $105/bbl.”
Jakob said, “While crude oil at $100/bbl makes a nice headline, the story is not
about oil but about commodities. . . We expected a strong start of the year for commodities on the back of passive investment ﬂows, and the tone of the ﬁrst trading
day of the year conﬁrmed the trend. Pension funds will allocate more investment to
commodities during the ﬁrst quarter while reducing exposure to equities.”
US inventories
The Energy Information Administration reported US crude stocks plunged 4 million bbl to 289.6 million bbl in the week ended Dec. 28, well below market expectations of a 1.7 million bbl drop. Gasoline inventories gained 1.9 million bbl to 207.8
million bbl in the same week. Distillate fuel inventories gained 600,000 bbl to 127.2
million bbl.
Although the latest data showed “another strong week for demand,” it was not
enough to offset rising supply, resulting in an increase in reﬁned product inventories, said Jacques H. Rousseau at Back Bay Research LCC, a research partner for
Soleil Securities Corp.
Analysts in the Houston ofﬁces of Raymond James & Associates Inc. said “mixed
signals” on US stocks possibly contributed to a slight pullback in crude prices Jan.
3. “Also, tanker rates have skyrocketed out of the Middle East, indicating stronger
production (i.e., more cheating),” among members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, they said.
However, Jakob said, “The draw in crude oil stocks was expected due to the endof-year tax savings. The crude stock change during January will be a better fundamental barometer since the December draws are only bullish if not met by a rebuild
during January.”
The ﬁnal US weekly data for 2007 show US crude inventories ending the year
some 65 million bbl lower than the peak at the end of June, said Paul Horsnell of
Barclays Capital Inc., London. “The sharp down-trend in crude inventories has taken
them from well above their 5-year average to 6.8 million bbl below that average.
Allowing for crude oil held as pipeline ﬁll, reﬁnery and tank bottoms, (i.e., the minimum operating requirement), we estimate that the level of discretionary commercial
US crude inventories has now fallen by about 60% over the past 6 months. What was
a signiﬁcant overhang is now a deﬁcit relative to normal patterns,” he said.
Raymond James analysts said, “Also putting upward pressure on crude prices
is the worry that OPEC has minimal spare capacity. Shokri Ghanem, the chairman
of Libya’s National Oil Corp., recently stated, ‘OPEC’s production is already close to
maximum capacity, and the organization can do nothing to curb prices.’ However, Indonesia, the second-smallest OPEC producer, has announced its intention to request
a 500,000 b/d production increase during OPEC’s Feb. 1 meeting.”
Jakob said, “OPEC is right to say that the price of oil is driven by ﬁnancial ﬂows
rather than supply and demand, but they are wrong to say that they can not do
anything about it. It would need either a much stronger US dollar or a wide contango to bring enough speculators back to the short side to offset the buying coming
from pension funds. OPEC can not do much about the dollar, but it has the power
do something about moving the current backwardation back to a contango. For that,
OPEC would need the resolve to oversupply rather than supply, but it has not shown
yet such intention.” He said passive investment ﬂows will not stay idle until OPEC’s
next meeting, “hence the risk remains on the upside.”

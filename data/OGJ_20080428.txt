trout watersheds, and consider factors designed to maximize revenues to the federal treasury and to the state while minimizing
environmental impacts, according to the federal lawmakers.
Before each new leasing round, BLM would have to confirm
that wells necessary to recover 90% of the recoverable natural gas
beneath the previously leased development area were completed
and that stringent environmental standards were met, they said.
The bill also would expand BLM’s Areas of Critical Environmental Concern to include the headwaters of two creeks, which the
lawmakers said are critical native cutthroat trout watersheds. It also
would limit development outside the ACECs and within development corridors along existing ridge-top roads to 20% of these areas.
A spokesman for the Independent Petroleum Association of
Mountain States in Denver said on Apr. 22 that the organization
was pleased that the three lawmakers apparently have dropped their
opposition to any further Roan Plateau federal leasing.
But IPAMS Communications Director Jon Bargas also told OGJ
that Congress transferred Naval Oil Shale Reserves 1 and 3 from the
US Department of Energy to BLM in 1997 with the express purpose of leasing the 73,620 acres. “Since then, BLM has developed

Alaska state officials have rejected ExxonMobil Corp.’s latest plan
to develop Point Thomson Unit (PTU) on Alaska’s North Slope. The
gas-condensate area has no production.
Alaska Natural Resources Commissioner Tom Irwin said the
proposed plan was not in the state’s best interest because it would
have involved development on the 106,200-acre PTU, east of Prudhoe Bay, without any commitment to produce gas.
“In light of the history of this unit, I did not trust the appellant’s
commitment to follow through with their 23rd plan of development,” Irwin said Apr. 22.
No immediate comment was available from ExxonMobil, PTU
operator. It estimates the high-pressure reservoir has reserves of
more than 8 tcf of gas and 200 million bbl of condensate (OGJ,
Mar. 10, 2008, p. 36.)
ExxonMobil along with BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc., Chevron
USA Inc., and ConocoPhillips Alaska Inc. hold working interests in
PTU, covering 45 state oil and gas leases. The oil companies have
said production hinges upon construction of an Alaska gas pipeline
to the Lower 48.

It also has restructured the four “strategic associations” producing extra-heavy crude from the Orinoco belt and raised their royalties and income-tax rates. In response, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil Corp. quit their Venezuelan heavy-oil projects.

Iraq expects new energy law, closer EU ties soon
Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki told European parliamentarians that his country’s Oil and Gas Draft Law will be passed soon
to attract international energy investment.
Al-Maliki told the European parliament’s foreign affairs committee that his government is nearing a final agreement on the law,
which will pave the way for signing strategic partnership agreements and developing investments.
Europe argues that the law’s ratification is essential for development of international investment in Iraq’s energy industry.
Meanwhile, the European Commission said Iraq has offered to
increase its supply of natural gas to the European market over the

Dana makes oil ﬁnd on West Rinnes structure
Dana Petroleum PLC will sidetrack well 210/24a-11 into the
neighboring East Rinnes structure on Block 210/24a in the northern UK North Sea after discovering oil on the West Rinnes structure, also on Block 210/24a.
The well produced up to 7,800 b/d of 32º oil during a drill
stem test from the Brent reservoir on the West Rinnes structure.
Dana said it is confident the size of the East Rinnes structure is
similar.
The well reached a total measured depth of 6,470 ft, and the
flow rate was limited by test equipment on the drilling rig, the
company said. Dana is encouraged by initial tests that the well’s oil
quality is similar to that being produced at Hudson oil field 5 km
away. The well found excellent quality sands throughout the Brent
sequence, Dana reported.
“A comprehensive set of wireline log data has been acquired,
including pressure data and oil samples,” Dana said.
Dana said the results “exceeded our predrill expectations” and
that the discovery at West Rinnes gives “strong encouragement” for
other prospects in the area.

Australia extends continental shelf acreage
The United Nations has allowed Australia to greatly extend its
continental shelf after 15 years of lobbying.
The UN found that Australia’s territory should be extended by
2.5 million sq km—an area about five times the size of France. The
new area takes in extensions of the Exmouth Plateau and Wallaby
Plateau in the west, the Great Australian Bight in the south, and the
Lord Howe Rise in the east.
All are areas the government scientific body Geoscience Australia thinks could hold petroleum reserves and are future potential
exploration areas.
No one will put a figure on likely petroleum resources in this
new offshore territory, but all agree it is virtually unexplored.

next 3 years. The offer was made during talks between Iraqi Oil
Minister Hussein al-Shahristani and EU Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs.
The EC said Iraqi officials are ready to sign a draft energy memorandum of understanding, which would open the way to closer
EU-Iraqi energy ties.
The EC said Iraq made “a political gesture of goodwill” by
promising to export at least 5 billion cu m of gas to the European
market by 2011.
It said Iraq also was committed to increasing its oil production
to 3 million b/d by yearend and that it aimed for 4.5 million b/d
by 2012.
“This should be a favorable contribution toward decreasing oil
prices,” the commission reported in a statement. “Iraq confirms it
is exploring new areas for production.”
EC Pres. Jose Manuel Barroso said negotiations on a complete
energy pact with Iraq “are going on very well” and suggested that
a final agreement could be reached by May. ✦

The announcement leaves a lot of unexplored territory that may
produce Australia’s next oil and gas province, according to Belinda
Robinson, Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association chief executive.
“We know very little about [the new areas] but a number
of them are adjacent to existing producing areas, including the
Browse and Carnarvon basins off Western Australia, so we’d be
hopeful they may be prospective,” Robinson said.
However, she added that having jurisdiction over the acreage
is not enough. The challenge for Australia is to persuade potential
investors to risk money here rather than elsewhere.
“This requires a two-pronged approach: first to ensure the availability of baseline geological information and second to ensure that
the fiscal framework takes account of the high costs and high risks
involved in exploring these areas,” she said.

Husky, CNOOC to develop Madura BD ﬁeld
Husky Energy Inc., Calgary, has reached an agreement with China’s CNOOC Ltd. to jointly develop Madura BD gas and natural gas
liquids field off East Java, Indonesia (OGJ, Jan. 22, 2007, p. 37). The
agreement covers the development and further exploration of the
Madura Straits production-sharing contract.
Deal specifics include payment of $125 million to Husky by
CNOOC to acquire a 50% equity interest in Husky Oil (Madura)
Ltd., which holds a 100% interest in the Madura Straits PSC.
Madura Straits PSC covers 2,794 sq km of exploration acreage
about 40 km north of East Java. Since 1984, 10 wells have been
drilled on this block, resulting in two discoveries: Madura BD and
MDA fields. In 2007, Husky signed three gas sale and purchase
agreements for the sale of 100 MMcfd of gas from Madura BD field
to East Java buyers.
CNOOC subsidiary CNOOC Southeast Asia Ltd. currently operates two blocks in Indonesia and holds interests in numerous other
blocks.

IOR-EOR offers lowest-cost reserves additions
Unlike in past years, improved or enhanced oil recovery is now
the least costly method for adding reserves, according to a presentation at the 16th SPE/DOE Improved Oil Recovery Symposium,
Apr. 21 in Tulsa.
In his presentation, Rafael Sandrea, president of IPC Petroleum
Consultants Inc., Tulsa, estimated that IOR-EOR could add reserves
for a capital expenditure of $2-4/bbl. He said this is less than the
needed $4.30-6.25/bbl capex for heavy oil production, $4-6/bbl
spending for deepwater, $12.86/bbl for acquisitions, and $14.42/
bbl for global finding and development costs.
Sandrea also said the target for IOR-EOR remains huge. His estimate of discovered conventional oil in-place to date is 10.9 trillion bbl. In this estimate, he does not include the 3 trillion bbl of
heavy oil and bitumen found in Alberta and the Orinoco region of
Venezuela.
The world has produced only 1.028 trillion bbl of conventional
oil, and Sandrea said that without expanding the use of IOR-EOR
methods, the ultimate worldwide recovery factor would be only
22%.
He also cautioned that without extensive increases in recovery
factors, world oil demand would face the following supply shortfalls: 2010, 2.7 million b/d; 2015, 5.4 million b/d; 2020, 12.1
million b/d; and 2030, 30.6 million b/d.
Sandrea said the $200-400 billion capital spending needed for
adding 100 billion bbl of IOR-EOR reserves is in the same range as
the industry’s current global spending of $260 billion/year.

water injection supply flowlines, and associated control umbilicals
have been installed in the DWG development.”
Oil production is expected to increase as more predrilled wells
come on stream during the year. Overall, ACG’s total production
will hit more than 1 million b/d, including Chirag, East Azeri, West
Azeri, and Central Azeri.

Shell considers carbon capture for Browse

Shell Australia is thinking of introducing a carbon dioxide capture and geosequestration (CCG) side to the proposed floating
LNG (FLNG) development at its wholly owned Prelude gas find in
the Browse basin off Western Australia.
According to documents lodged with environmental regulators
in Australia, the company is planning to build a 3.5 million tonne/
year FLNG for the field which lies 450 km northeast of Broome.
Shell says in the application document that the project has potential for CO2 sequestration, thereby reducing its carbon footprint.
The CCG move comes in the wake of Prime Minister Kevin
Rudd’s federal government plans to introduce a carbon trading
scheme by 2010 as part of its goal to limit greenhouse gas emissions.
If successful, the FLNG proposal at Prelude could be a catalyst
for development of other ‘stranded’ gas in Australia and elsewhere.
The Prelude plant proposal is for a vessel 480 m long and 70-80
m wide and designed to survive a once-in-10,000 years cyclone.
It would be built outside Australia and towed directly to the field

involved two types of pollutants, selenium and whole effluent
toxicity.
ConocoPhillips brought the refinery into compliance with its
CWA permit limits for both pollutants after federal enforcement
actions began, according to DOJ and EPA. They said WRB Refining
LLC, the refinery’s current owner, also signed the agreement.
The proposed settlement, still subject to final judicial approval,
requires ConocoPhillips to monitor surrounding waters, including
Dixon Creek and the Canadian River, for selenium levels as well as
for the accumulation of selenium in fish tissue.
The company also will maintain controls it put into place to
minimize its selenium discharges and to correct whole effluent
toxicity violations, DOJ and EPA said. It also agreed to perform
a supplementary environmental project, which will cost an estimated $600,000, to reduce the amount of solids discharged into
local waterways during storms, they indicated.

Shell FCC process raises diesel, propylene yields
Shell Global Solutions International BV announced the development of a new process to increase production of diesel and propylene from FCC units.
The middle distillates and lower olefins selective process (MILOS) uses an additional riser in the FCC, either in a revamp or
grassroots unit, which gives the refiner options to simultaneously
maximize production of diesel and propylene.

“Changing market demands for less gasoline and more diesel
and propylene has proved difficult to achieve with the traditional
and inflexible layout of the standard FCC. MILOS addresses this by
providing the refiner an operational choice,” said Mart Nieskens,
global manager, catalytic cracking at Shell Global Solutions (US)
Inc. (SGS). “The process is designed to be simple and easy to
change between modes to help provide greater flexibility.”
According to Shell, refiners can run an FCC in different modes
with the new process. In the propylene mode, propylene production can double compared with a base-case FCC unit while maintaining traditional diesel yields and quality.
In diesel mode, diesel production can increase up to 20% with a
seven point rise in cetane number and increased propylene production. The FCC unit can run anywhere between these modes or revert to normal FCC operation by changing operating parameters.
“The MILOS process should be particularly attractive to refineries linked to petrochemical complexes,” said Pankaj Desai, SGS licensing sales manager. “Moreover, because it’s designed to provide
increased flexibility, the MILOS process can help refiners to take
advantage of the seasonal demand patterns.”
Feed to the additional riser can be different feedstocks, such as
FCC naphtha, coker naphtha, visbreaker naphtha, vegetable oil, and
GTL process products, or even paraffinic vacuum gas oil, according
to Shell. ✦

BLM begins hearings on Ruby gas pipeline
The US Bureau of Land Management has begun a series of
public hearings on a proposed $2 billion natural gas pipeline that
would run 680 miles between southwestern Wyoming and southern Oregon near the California state line.
The Ruby Pipeline system, which would be built by subsidiaries
of El Paso Corp., PG&E Corp., and Bear Stearns Cos., initially would
transport 1.2 bcf/day of gas from the Opal Hub across northern
Utah and Nevada to an interconnection near Malin, Ore. (OGJ, Dec.
24, 2007, Newsletter).
Two compressor stations, one near the 42-in. pipeline’s origin
and a second midway along its route, also would be built initially.
Additional compression could increase capacity to 2 bcf/day.
BLM is holding the meetings as a participating agency in the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s preparation of an environmental impact statement on the project. The US Forest Service
also is participating because the system would cross the WasatchCache National Forest in Utah and the Fremont-Winema National
Forest in Oregon.

Iraq’s NOC lets contract for Kirkuk-Banias repair
Iraq’s state-owned North Oil Co. has signed a preliminary agreement with Russia’s Stroytransgaz for the repair of the Iraqi section
of the 880-km Kirkuk-Banias oil pipeline. In 2007, Stroytransgaz
received a contract to bring the Syrian section of the line back into
working condition.
The Kirkuk-Banias pipeline had a carrying capacity of 300,000

b/d before the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, but its original
capacity when built in the 1950s was 1.4 million b/d.
The pipeline was closed for much of the 1970s and 1980s. In
the 1990s, it was reopened so Iraq could bypass the United Nations oil embargo. At the time, reports put Iraq’s exports through
the line at about 150,000-200,000 b/d.

BG, Singapore sign LNG supply deal
BG Group PLC and Singapore’s Energy Market Authority (EMA)
have signed a memorandum of agreement for BG to provide as
much as 3 million tonnes/year of LNG for up to 20 years, starting
in 2012.
The deal underpins Singapore’s desire to enhance its energy security and marks the first time it will become an LNG importer. It
also has expressed a desire to create an LNG trade hub with spot
cargoes.
BG Group, sourcing LNG from its global portfolio, will supply the LNG to the import terminal on Singapore’s Jurong Island
that also is scheduled for completion in 2012. PowerGas Ltd., a
wholly owned subsidiary of Singapore Power Ltd., was contracted
to build, own, and operate the terminal.
The plant’s capacity can be expanded to 6 million tonnes/year
and ultimately to 10 million tonnes/year by the mid-2020s.
Both parties declined to reveal the value of the agreement,
saying only that the deal had been concluded at “competitive
rates.” ✦

Ever asked yourself how fish swim in sub-zero waters without freezing? We did.
That’s how we came up with the idea for a new chemical that stops hydrate plugs
forming in our deepwater pipes – based on a protein that engulfs ice crystals inside
the fish’s body.
Fresh thinking, innovation, even leaps of imagination are part of our daily lives at
Shell – across engineering disciplines as diverse as:

The new imperative
Energy policy for many years has been impossible to discuss outside an environmental context.
Within limits, the linkage makes sense. Energy
production, transport, and use have environmental consequences that must be acknowledged
and controlled. Distortion arises, however, when
policy-making consistently favors environmentalism over energy supply and affordability. Longstanding distortion of this type now draws a new
imperative into the energy-environmental policy
nexus: food.
Alarm is spreading fast over a rapid increase in
food prices. World Bank Pres. Robert B. Zoellick
recently said food prices have doubled during the
past 3 years in a crisis that threatens to push 100
million residents of poor countries deeper into
poverty. The United Nations World Food Program
(WFP) says its studies confirm the estimate.
“There is the new face of hunger—the millions
of people who were not in the urgent hunger category 6 months ago but now are,” WFP Executive
Director Josette Sheeran said in London last week.
The WFP, calling high food prices the biggest challenge of its 45-year history, wants new support
from governments distracted by threats of recession.

governments push biofuels—supposedly to fight
pollution, lower emissions of greenhouse gases,
and extend oil supply but mostly to enrich farmers.
A World Bank study published this month refutes the energy-cost excuse for rising food prices
as well as explanations based on crop failures.
Only about 15% of the increase in food product
prices is attributable directly to elevated energy
and fertilizer costs, the study said. And supply
slumps from poor crops in some areas have been
offset by good crops and increased exports elsewhere.
Although the World Bank and UN continue to
tip-toe around the obvious, the verdict is clear:
The biofuels craze, while raising costs for everyone, is devastating the chronically hungry. And it
will continue to do so until crop markets adjust.
According to the World Bank study, the adjustment
won’t play out before 2015.
On the role of biofuels in the food crisis, World
Bank and UN officials tread carefully. Both organizations advocate aggressive responses to global
warming, inevitably including governmental support for biofuels. Neither organization has time

actually affects Earth’s heat balance or for quesEnergy and food

Labor cost pressures are especially strong in Alberta.
Total budgets for capital spending

US upstream spending

Oil and gas exploration, drilling, and
production spending in the US this year
will increase nearly 6% to $160.2 billion (Table 1).
This forecast is based on OGJ’s annual drilling forecast, which projected
that the total number of well completions in the US this year will be 49,012
(OGJ, Jan. 21, 2008, p. 35).
Drilling and exploration expenditures will total $130.2 billion, including $17 billion for geological and
geophysical costs. Outlays for production will total $24.75 billion, up 4%
from a year ago.
Upstream activity in the deep water
of the Gulf of Mexico is reflected by the
amount of bonus payments the Minerals Management Service (MMS) collects
from lease sales related to the Outer
Continental Shelf. OCS bonus payments
in 2008 will jump 88%.
In 2006, OCS lease bonus payments
totaled $914 million

million bbl of oil and 1.64-2.64 tcf of
natural gas.
Offshore E&P activity continues to
move into deeper waters. In a February 2008 report on deepwater activity,
WoodMackenzie said: “The lower level
of exploration activity during 2007 is
in part due to higher levels of appraisal
and development drilling activity
coupled with the tight rig market. We
expect exploration drilling to pick up
in 2008, driven by a combination of
factors. Increased rig availability, further
prospect identification from ongoing
seismic analysis, and the acquisition of
large amounts of acreage in 2007 will
all encourage exploration.”

US reﬁning
Capital expenditures for transportation, downstream projects, and corporate spending in the US this year will
total $36.7 billion, according to OGJ’s
forecast. This is up from $23.9 billion

last year and $20.2 billion in 2006.
Leading the spending growth are pipeline, refining, and LNG projects.
A few large expansion projects will
boost spending to $13 billion at refineries this year. In 2007, refining capital
outlays declined 8% to $8.3 billion.
Among current projects is Motiva’s
Port Arthur refinery expansion, which
will bring total crude distillation capacity to 600,000 b/d. The additional
325,000 b/d of capacity will be online
in 2010.
Encana and ConocoPhillips are
expanding the heavy-oil processing capacity of the 306,000-b/d Wood River
refinery in Illinois, which they operate
via their WRB Refining LLC partnership.
ConocoPhillips has allocated about $1.6
billion for capital spending at its US refineries this year, focusing on reliability,
energy efficiency, capital maintenance,
and regulatory compliance. The company also said work continues at a number

of its refineries to increase crude capacity, expand conversion capability, and
increase clean product yield.
In February, Total announced a project to build a 50,000 b/d coker, a desulfurization unit, a vacuum distillation
unit, and related units at its Port Arthur,
Tex., refinery. The project, scheduled for
commissioning in 2011, will cost $2.2
billion.
The new units at Port Arthur will
increase the refinery’s deep-conversion
capacity and expand its ability to
process heavy and sour crude, and the
project will add 3 million tonnes/year
of ultralow-sulfur diesel to the refinery’s current output.

Petrochemicals, pipelines
OGJ forecasts that 2008 US petrochemical spending will total $1 billion.
This is up from last year. The majority
of petrochemical investment, however,

Perfectly balanced:
the needs of drilling
and completion.

Introducing the SMART RDF
family from M-I SWACO.
In complex openhole completions, a host of challenges place a wide range
of demands on reservoir drill-in fluids (RDFs) and breakers. SMART RDF*
Technology addresses them all by adapting to project conditions. The
result is minimized formation upset and maximized production.
We’ve designed a portfolio of SMART RDF fluids and breakers for a variety
of applications, all engineered to work together seamlessly, giving you
complete command of downhole fluids-related events. While drilling,
these fluids meet today’s highest performance standards. During completion, the SMART RDF fluids and breaker systems ensure maximum control
either by permitting oil to flow easily through the existing filter cake or
by eliminating the filter cake thoroughly and uniformly.
Now you can create a high-performance filter cake that can be removed in
a predictable, controlled way, without the use of aggressive chemicals and
their potentially destructive consequences.
The result is better performance, smoother drilling and completion operations, and improved productivity — all while protecting the formation.
This means you achieve the maximum potential from your reservoir.

Special Report

During a Mar. 26 conference call on
Mexico’s reserves, Carlos Morales, head
of E&P at Pemex, said that although the
country’s oil production during the first
2 months of this year averaged 2.9 million b/d, the company expects output
for the year to average 3-3.1 million
b/d.
On Mar. 30, Pemex released a report
detailing 13 years of production expectations, with output declines from
Cantarell field plus a declining reserves
base in Mexico.
George Baker of Baker & Associates,
Houston, commented on the report:
“Pemex, in its diagnostic report, reveals
determination to develop fields in deep
water, fully realizing the value of experience in the selection and timing of
technology. The document stops short,
however, of advocating the long-awaited strategic alliances of [international
oil companies].”

SAFE: US economic survival tied to oil, gas production hikes
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Record high crude prices, combined
with the declining value of the US
dollar and growing signs of a recession, make increased US oil and gas
production necessary not only for the
nation’s energy security but also for its
economic survival, a leading advocacy
group told reporters Apr. 17.
“Energy security can’t be subjugated
to climate change. If we don’t address
both, we’ll have neither,” said Robbie
Diamond, president and chief executive
24

of Securing America’s Future Energy
(SAFE), as the organization released a
new report, A Different Type of Price
Spike.
“While we pursue the health of our
planet, we need to protect the health of
our economy,” added David P. Steiner,
chief executive of Waste Management
Inc. and one of four members of SAFE’s
Energy Security Leadership Council
who joined Diamond at the briefing.
Adam M. Goldstein, president and chief
executive of Royal Caribbean International; Eric S. Schwartz, a senior director
at Goldman Sachs; and retired US Air

Force Gen. Charles F. Wald also participated. The latest oil price escalation differs greatly from its predecessors, which
could be traced to constrained supplies,
Schwartz observed. “Starting a few
years ago, we had a demand-side shock
from emerging economics, and not just
for oil. There also was a shift in financial markets as economically rational
investors moved into commodities to
diversify their portfolios and diversify
their returns,” he said.
Emphasizing that it was his personal opinion, Schwartz conceded that
derivative markets can have a marginal

New York nixes
LNG plant plan

T

hree weeks after winning Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission
approval, a large floating liquefied
natural gas terminal and regasification facility proposed for construction in Long Island Sound was
rejected by New York’s state government.
Sec. of State Lorraine A. CortesVazquez said on Apr. 10 that the
Broadwater LNG project, a joint venture of TransCanada Corp. and Shell
US Gas & Power Co., is not consistent
with six policies under New York’s
coastal zone management plan. The
installation aims to deliver up to 1.25
bcfd of gas. FERC approved the project on Mar. 20.
Gov. David A. Paterson said that his
concerns regarding the LNG project
include its size, potential disruption of
commercial and recreational fishing,
and alleged failure to guarantee lowcost gas to Long Island consumers.
He reactivated the state’s energy
planning board after 5 years to prepare a comprehensive strategy that
would examine renewable technologies but not rule out LNG or other
traditional sources. Paterson, who
chaired the state’s renewable energy
task force when he was lieutenant
governor, said that Broadwater might
not be needed.

‘The best option’
In response, John Hritcko, Broadwater senior vice-president and the
project’s director, said, “We continue
to believe that the Broadwater project, as proposed, is the best option
for New York State to meet its growing demand for clean, affordable,
reliable natural gas, and does so with
no near-shore or onshore impacts.”
26

impact on prices but added that growing demand amid limited supplies
is a much greater force. Government
has a role in constraining participants
who try to move prices, but placing
the blame for higher prices entirely on
speculators is a mistake, he continued.

Impact delayed
Sponsors will review specific aspects
of the state’s decision before deciding
on their next steps.
At first glance, this looks like an
impasse. But the federal LNG project
permitting process lets Broadwater’s
sponsors ask US Commerce Sec.
Carlos Gutierrez if New York’s action
actually follows its coastal plan. The
state also has proposed two alternative sites in the Atlantic Ocean on the
other side of Long Island.
Bill Cooper, president of the Center for Liquefied Natural Gas in Washington, said that Paterson’s idea of
having an energy task force develop a
comprehensive strategy for New York
is hardly new. “People in the Northeast agree they need more natural gas.
The question still is where to put the
facilities,” he told me.

‘Certainly, there’s demand’
Markets determine the need for
projects, while the federal and state
governments protect the environment
and surrounding communities, he
said. “Certainly, there’s demand for
the gas Broadwater would provide.
You have only to look at the New
York city-gate spot prices through
each winter to see this.”
FERC’s Mar. 20 approval of the
Broadwater project does not necessarily mean it will go ahead exactly
as proposed, he added. The decision
provided a working document with
more than 80 conditions which
developers will have to meet before
the federal energy regulator issues a
construction permit. “The important
point is that the process apparently is
moving forward. And yes, developers
of other LNG projects are watching
closely as it does,” Cooper said. ✦

“It’s pretty clear to American families
that oil prices are going up and that it’s
regressive,” said Goldstein. The impact
was delayed because growing home equity served as a buffer against rising energy costs as long as real estate boomed,
he explained. That changed when the
subprime mortgage crisis undermined
the market and slowing discretionary
purchases began to accelerate economic
uncertainty, he said.
Soaring crude oil prices pose serious
implications for US military forces, according to Wald. “Even though instability and insurgencies pose threats, I
believe limited resources, whether oil
or water, are a greater problem,” he
said, adding that 85% of what a soldier,
airman, or sailor carries into the field is
either water or petroleum products.
He also said that US military services
generally provide the only protection
for global oil shipments, whether in
the area of the Strait of Hormuz or off
West Africa, where multinational oil
companies are committing $100 billion
to develop new fields. Diamond said
that Congress took a good first step at
reducing demand by including tougher
automotive efficiency requirements in
the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act. Now it needs to take similarly decisive actions to increase domestic
oil and gas production, he maintained.
Participants agreed that it would
take time for additional US oil and gas
production to have an impact, but they
added that it would be worthwhile because it would keep in the US more of
the money consumers spend on energy.
“Think of the investment that could be
made in future energy technologies’
research and development with $357
billion if you don’t send that money
overseas,” Steiner said. ✦

They also questioned the idea that
global warming has increased storm
activity in the region. They conceded
that there were more hurricanes in
the Atlantic Basin from 1995 through
2007 (an average of 3.8/year) than
there were in the previous 25 years
(1970-94 where there were an average
1.5/year). But they traced the increase
to rising thermohaline circulation and
growing salinity in the Atlantic over
several decades, which they said is not
directly related to rising global temperatures.
“There have been similar past periods (1940s and 1950s) when the Atlantic was just as active as in recent years.
For instance, when we compare the Atlantic Basin hurricane numbers over the
15-year period from 1990-2004 with
an earlier 15-year period (1950-64),
we see no differences in hurricane frequency and intensity even though the

global warming during 1990-2004,”
Gray and Klotzbach said. ✦

manages new projects and new motor fuel resources at IFP.
He told OGJ: “From coal onwards, one finds the refining
processes applied to heavy oil and deep conversion products.”
Whether produced from direct liquefaction, with hydrogen added to the organic structure of coal, or from indirect
liquefaction through breaking down the coal structure by
gasification with steam, investment in a CTL plant costs as
much as a large refinery but produces much less fuel volumes.
China’s Shenshua CTL plant, due on stream this year in Inner Mongolia, is a large complex having associated coal treatment and refining operations. It will produce only 20,000
b/d of CTL but will cost several billion dollars. Shenshua is
using the direct liquefaction process, while Sasol chose the
indirect process.
Brian Ricketts, an International Energy Agency coal analyst, said the liquid coal market would not exceed 15% of
transport fuels before 2050. And if clean technologies are
included, it would not be more than 10% by then. However,
use of the direct or indirect technology would accelerate
after 2020-30, he said.

Coal plentiful
At the conference Poland’s former Prime Minister Jerzy
Buzek, a member of the European Parliament and vice-president of the European Energy Forum, described his country as
having the “largest coal reserves in Europe.” He said Poland
is engaged “in resolving a coal conversion dilemma: whether
to use coal as power for electricity or only for liquid fuels.”
William Anderson, assistant secretary of the US Air Force
for installations, environment, and logistics, told the conference the USAF is committed to synfuels development to reduce dependence on foreign oil. Within the USAF’s “energy
initiatives,” Anderson plans to test certification of synfuels on
the air fleet by 2011 and use a synfuels blend by 2016 for
half the fuels purchased.
Meanwhile, his department is developing “a major international initiative” through ongoing talks with the UK’s
Royal Air Force and France’s Air Force about alternative
aviation fuels, greenhouse gases, and aviation fuel demand
reduction. It also is “reaching to Air Forces across the world;
fuel needs to be international,” he said.
Closing the conference, Appert gave his own cautious
view, warning, “In an uncertain environment, the industry
needs to understand the constraints of financing and engineering. But, as well, the finance and engineering worlds
have to understand and manage the specificities of CTL.
“Given the size of CTL commercial plants, the needs for
commodities will be huge.” He urged the industry to continue “studying and improving CTL, [while] keeping our eyes
open to other energy routes. By doing so, I am convinced
that CTL will be part of the solution to the dramatic challenges of energy and environment the world is facing.” ✦

Project would bring heavy oil to West Texas
Centurion Pipeline LP launched an
open season to determine interest in a
proposed reversal project that would
deliver heavy Canadian crude from
Cushing, Okla., to West Texas.
A possible buyer of heavy crude is
Holly Corp. of Dallas, which plans to
reconfigure its Artesia, NM, refinery to
handle heavy crude. A Holly spokesman
confirmed that the pipeline reversal, if
implemented, would give Holly access
to heavy crude.
Holly’s 85,000-b/sd refinery is being expanded to 100,000 b/sd, with
completion scheduled for first-quarter
2009. The reconfiguration to process
heavy crude also is expected to be completed in 2009.
Centurion’s 16-in., 375-mile pipeline runs to Slaughter, Tex., which is

within 60 miles of the Artesia refinery,
the Holly spokesman said.
The pipeline is known as the No.
1 Pipeline. Centurion’s 30-day open
season began Apr. 14.
Occidental Petroleum Corp., Centurion’s parent company, said the No. 1
Pipeline is one of two 16-in. pipelines
that Centurion currently operates from
Slaughter to Cushing.
“Centurion recognizes that there are
several ongoing projects that will bring
heavy Canadian crude to more than
one Cushing terminal,” said Richard
Kline, Occidental communications vicepresident in Los Angeles. “Centurion
is looking to be able to provide a new
transportation capacity from Cushing
for those projects and movements to

markets in the Permian basin and surrounding area,” he said.
The reversed pipeline could be in
southwest-bound service as early as
fourth-quarter 2009. Its projected capacity is 60,000 b/d.
“Oxy will continue to market Permian basin production so as to receive the
maximum possible value,” Kline said.

Holly’s reconﬁguration
Holly is making a series of investments in the Artesia refinery, which is
also known as the Navajo Refining Co.
LP refinery.
In 2006, Holly completed an ultralow-sulfur diesel (ULSD) project and
expanded the refinery to 83,000 b/sd
from 75,000 b/sd. This included a refinery expansion and conversion of the

Biofuels begin
to feel the heat

T

he oil and gas industry is not
alone in taking heat from
environmentalists these days. Even
biofuels—long thought to be the
answer to hydrocarbons—have come
in for criticism.
A recent United Nations report
called biofuels a “crime against
humanity” for diverting food crops
toward fuel production as a global
scarcity deepens and food prices rise.
The UN report said farmers
worldwide must reduce dependency
on fossil fuels and better protect the
environment, as riots erupt over food
shortages in the Caribbean and Africa
and hunger approaches a crisis in
parts of Asia.
It even recommended an international moratorium on incentives for
producing and marketing biofuels.
Thilo Bode, the head of German
consumer protection group Foodwatch, also lashed out against the
“lethal” trade policies of industrialized countries. “We need a different
energy policy,” Bode said. “It is not
right that we fill our tanks at the expense of those who are famished.”

the environmental sustainability of
agricultural land.”
Chief Executive Tony Hayward said
BP will focus on “the next generation
of biofuels, which will be based on
more efficient molecules and will not
be derived from food crops.”
US Energy Sec. Samuel Bodman
took a similar view, saying the nation
should begin “moving away gradually” from ethanol made from food
such as corn.
“As we pursue diversity in our
overall energy mix, we must also
pursue diversity in our biofuels,”
Bodman said at a conference in Alexandria, Va.

Lula backs biofuels

Perhaps the stoutest response came
from Brazilian President Luiz Inacio
Lula da Silva, who Apr. 16 made an
impassioned defense of biofuels, denying that their production contributes to food scarcity or rising prices.
“Biofuels aren’t the villain that
threatens food security,” he said at a
Latin American meeting of the UN’s
Food and Agricultural Organization. “On the contrary...they can pull

distillate hydrotreater to gas oil service,
conversion of the gas oil hydrotreater to
ULSD service, expansion of the continuous catalytic reformer, expansion and
conversion of the kerosene hydrotreater
to naphtha service, installation of additional sulfur-recovery capacity, and
installation of a 10 MMscfd hydrogen
plant.
Crude capacity then was increased
to 85,000 b/sd by relocating heat
exchangers and replacing pumps in the
crude unit.
In December 2006, Holly announced
plans to install a 15,000 b/d hydrocracker and a 28 MMscf hydrogen plant
at a cost of $125 million to increase
liquid volume recovery, increase the
refinery’s capacity to process outside
feedstocks, and increase high-value
product yields, as well as meet new
low-sulfur gasoline specifications (OGJ,
June 4, 2007, Newsletter).
The hydrocracker and hydrogen
plant projects will provide improved
heavy crude oil processing flexibility.
In February 2007, Holly said it
was revamping a crude unit to increase crude capacity at the refinery to
100,000 b/sd. Holly also plans to revamp a second crude unit and to install
a solvent deasphalter unit.
It expects the expansion portion of
the overall project consisting of the
initial crude unit revamp, the new hydrocracker, and the new hydrogen plant
to be completed and operational by the
fourth quarter.
“The completion of the heavy crude
oil processing portion of the overall
project, including the second crude unit
revamp and the installation of the new
solvent deasphalter, will be targeted
to coincide with the development of
future pipeline access to the Navajo
refinery for heavy Canadian crude oil
and other foreign heavy crude oils
transported” from Cushing, the Holly
web site said.
A new sulfur recovery unit currently
under way will permit the refinery
to process 100% sour crude and is
planned for start-up in the third quarter
of 2008. ✦

DOE monitors CO2 injection in Australian gas ﬁeld
The US Department of Energy provided technology that helped Australia
launch the Otway basin pilot project,
which will inject carbon dioxide into
a depleted gas field in southeastern
Australia.
The project involves monitoring the
CO2 to demonstrate the feasibility of
storing it in the Waarre formation.
The Otway basin pilot project is one
of 19 sequestration projects endorsed
by the Carbon Sequestration Leadership
Forum (CSLF), an international climate
change initiative that focuses on sequestration technology development.
The project is directed by Australia’s
Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies (CO2CRC) of
Canberra. Project partners include DOE
and various public and private organizations.

Up to 100,000 tonnes of CO2 will
be injected more than a mile beneath
the earth’s surface. A team of Australian, American, and other international
researchers will monitor the storage
reservoir.
CO2CRC is 100% owner of licenses
PPL11 and PPL13, which cover Buttress
CO2 field and nearby depleted Naylor
natural gas field.
The program will involve production of CO2 from Buttress at a rate of
3 MMcfd, piping the gas 1.75 km to
Naylor, and injecting it into the Cretaceous Waarre reservoir on the flank of
the depleted field (OGJ, Mar. 10, 2006,
Newsletter).
The injection process will span 1-2
years, while monitoring and modeling activities will last for several years
beyond that.

Buttress reserves exceed 10 bcf,
90% of which is CO2. Minor amounts
of methane will be stripped out and
used to power the compressors and
other equipment. The Otway project
is unusual in that researchers own the
petroleum leases, the CO2 source, and
the depleted storage reservoir.

DOE provides expertise
In DOE-sponsored research, the
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
(LBNL) developed instrumentation to
track the CO2 plume during and after
the injection. Sophisticated seismic
techniques will provide data about the
location, migration, and permanent
storage of the CO2 plume.
Remote sensing is just one of several
monitoring techniques LBNL research-

Turkmenistan seeks energy cooperation, offshore PSAs
Eric Watkins
Senior Correspondent
Turkmenistan will allow international oil companies to develop Caspian
Sea offshore deposits under production-sharing agreements, said Tacberdi
Tagyyew, deputy chairman of the Turkmen council of ministers.
Tagyyew told delegates at a conference on “Oil and Gas of Turkmenistan
2008” in London that some 32 licenses
for oil and gas exploration in the Turkmen section of the Caspian Sea have
already been issued, and international
oil companies may participate in several
projects.
However Turkmenistan will reserve
the exclusive right of domestic companies to extract oil and gas from the
country’s onshore deposits, he added,
although foreign partners may partici-

pate by providing services.
Tagyyew’s remarks coincided with
a call for a new atmosphere of cooperation on energy that appears to be
emerging among the “energy triangle”
countries that include Russia, the European Union (EU), and Central Asian
states.
“Each member of this ‘energy triangle’ depends on the other two, and it
requires a new atmosphere of cooperation,” said Pierre Morel, the EU’s special
representative for Central Asia. Morel
called on all sides to quit “politicizing” energy issues and seek a long-term
energy strategy.

Gas export routes vary
In that vein, Turkmenistan is supporting a broad-based policy on natural gas exports, according to Tagyyew.
He said Turkmenistan adheres to a

“multiple-version” approach toward
routes for exporting gas extracted in
the country.
He said strategic relations, based on
a 25-year trade agreement concluded
in 2003, link Russia and Turkmenistan,
which currently delivers 50 billion cu
m/year of gas to Russia’s OAO Gazprom. Soon, he said, deliveries will
increase to 70-80 billion cu m.
Tagyyew also said a gas pipeline to
China would go online in 2009, with
some 30 billion cu m of gas transiting
the line from eastern Turkmenistan to
China via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.
Meanwhile, he said, Turkmenistan
is considering other export possibilities, including a gas pipeline to Pakistan via Afghanistan and a gas pipeline
to Europe via the so-called southern
Caspian-Black Sea corridor or Nabucco
gas pipeline. ✦

it said.
The cuts will affect office-based

will be affected.
The decision was taken after the
company carried out a cost and efficiency study. Last June Shell dropped
plans to build a £25 million headquarters in Aberdeen and has put up part of
its operations in the UK North Sea for
sale.
Shell’s actions follow a similar move
by BP PLC that will cut its onshore
North Sea workforce by almost 20%—a
loss of 350 jobs. Both companies have
insisted that they remain dedicated to
the area. ✦

One Continental geologist mapped
the Middle Bakken in the Williston basin in Montana, and Hamm approached
companies that had discovered Mustang

a pilot waterflood, but they were not
interested.
The companies, Headington Oil Co.
and Lyco Energy Corp. of Dallas, had
completed vertical wells in the Bakken
after failed attempts to complete for
Red River oil, but the Bakken production wasn’t commercial if a new well
were drilled from surface, Hamm said.
Later Lyco aligned with Halliburton
Energy Services and began drilling the
Bakken horizontally on 320-acre units.
Laterals were short and production rates
weren’t commercial at first. Eventually
fracs were tried, but rates still weren’t
commercial.

found the field to have contained more
than 30 billion boe of original oil in
place with estimated ultimate recovery
of 3.5 billion boe (OGJ, Apr. 27, 2006,

Chesapeake sees large potential in US plays
A Jurassic Haynesville shale play
in Louisiana, with only a few wells
producing gas so far, could eventually
be worth 7.5-20 tcf of recovery net to
Chesapeake Energy Corp., the company
said in late March.
The 20 tcf figure depends on the
company’s securing 500,000 net acres
in the play, compared with the 200,000
acres it held in late March. Haynesville
could have “a larger impact on the
company than any other play in which
it has participated to date,” said the
large Oklahoma City independent.
Chesapeake also has become involved
in five unconventional oil projects, four
of which were developed internally,
in four states that range in size from
100,000 to 1 million acres and have a
collective 1 billion bbl recovery potential net to the company. Two of the plays
are producing, and the other three are
to be drilled in the next 12 months.
40

The company also is pursuing the
Colony and Mountain Front Granite
Wash plays in the Anadarko basin in
Oklahoma and Texas, each of which
could mean 1 tcfe of net recovery.
About 40% of the energy content of
the Colony play is in oil and natural gas
liquids.
Chesapeake expects to drill 250 more
net horizontal wells on 60,000 acres
in Oklahoma in the Colony play, now
producing 40 MMcfd, and 400 more
net horizontal wells on 75,000 acres in
the three-discovery, 150-mile Mountain
Front play in both states.
Chesapeake disclosed few details
about the plays due to competitive
considerations.
The company also said it is ready to
accelerate drilling in the Appalachian
basin, where it owns 1.1 million net
acres in the Devonian Marcellus shale
and 500,000 net acres in the Devonian

Lower Huron shale, where the combined ultimate recovery could exceed
10 tcf net. It plans to drill 165 wells
in the two formations this year and
next. ✦

A recent study advocates that the many fields
that lie along Iraq’s borders should be operated
jointly with the adjacent
country (Fig. 1).
Production
The Centre for Global
Energy Studies (CGES) conducted the
study in reaction to February 2008
claims in the Iraqi press that neighbouring countries were stealing Iraq’s oil.
These claims recall the assertions
of Saddam Hussein’s regime in 1990
that Kuwait was stealing oil from
Iraq’s South Rumaila field by excessive
production from the Ratga field. This
alleged theft was one of Saddam’s justifications for invading Kuwait.
Also in 2001, Iraq claimed Kuwait’s
overproduction in the Ratga and Abdalli
fields had led to about 50 million bbl
moving into Kuwait from two Iraqi
fields: South Rumaila and Safwan (part
of the Zubair field complex).

Joint operations
The study suggested that an ideal
approach is for two adjacent countries
to undertake joint appraisal, planning,
development, and production operations of fields on their common border,
as well as for fields on either side of the
border so that it can be verified that the
fields are connected or are in separate
reservoir systems.
Even for two separate fields, the
study noted that a joint production
system sharing some surface facilities
might be preferable; however, technical
and political expediency requires a high
degree of cooperation and coordination.
The study further said that joint
operations would benefit even border
fields that were developed separately
and produced for decades such as Naft
Shahr-Naft Khaneh on the Iran-Iraq
border, or Ratga-South Rumaila and
Abdalli-Safwan-Zubair on the KuwaitIraq.
The CGES study reviewed and analyzed the oil and gas fields on or near
the borders with Iran, Kuwait, Jordan,

O D U C T I O N

and Syria and suggested which field
might continue across the borders.

Syria, Jordan borders
Fig. 2 shows the fields discussed in
the study that are on Iraq’s border with
Syria and Jordan.
On the Syrian side are:
• Al-Hawl, gas discovery that could

• Karachok, producing oil field that
was the first oil field discovered in Syria.
• Swaidiayh, producing oil field that
extends into the Sufaya in Iraq.

At Prudhoe Bay, Alas., nonrig tubing
repairs have become a viable alternative
to rig workovers (RWOs). This type of
repair provides economic remediation
for wells with production tubing by
“A” annulus communication.
Wireline-set retrievable straddles can
eliminate tubing communication at a
significant cost savings. They are particularly attractive in areas where RWO
cost is significant, such as offshore, remote, or arctic locations. The advantage
of tubing straddle repair over a conventional RWO is that there is no need to
pull tubing, resulting in the well being
returned to service faster.
Typical straddle deployment costs
are less than 5% of the costs for tubing
replacement with an RWO. Singleset or “one-trip” straddles were used
historically at Prudhoe Bay. However,
starting in 1994, a less expensive, retrievable, two-run straddle design was
adopted.
A 2006 study of 263 permanent
and retrievable tubing straddles set in
181 wells at Prudhoe Bay showed that
single-set straddles were far more suc-

cessful and lasted longer than two-set
straddles.1
This article describes the recent development, history, and success rate of
a retrievable, single-set tubing straddle
for 41⁄2-in. and 31⁄2-in. tubing. It details
the modifications required to convert
an hydraulic set straddle pack-off to a
one trip wireline set system. Twentynine of these straddles have been set
at Prudhoe Bay to date, improving the
straddle program success rate to 80%
from about 50%.

New solution
Prudhoe Bay is a mature, enhanced
oil recovery/waterflood oil field. Mechanical problems with the original
completions have traditionally been
repaired with a rig to replace the tubing. The majority of these wells were
completed with 41⁄2-in. and 51⁄2-in.,
L-80 carbon steel production tubing.
BP has made significant cost savings
by deploying the alternative remediation technique discussed in this article,
and the workovers may result in the
recovery of additional reserves. Tubing straddles are designed to eliminate
production tubing by “A” annulus communication (Fig. 1).
They consist of two sealing elements
connected by a pipe spacer to straddle
and isolate the source of tubing by “A”
annulus communication. They can be
installed in producers or injectors to
isolate leaks in damaged gas lift mandrels (GLMs), jewelry, tubing collars,
and eroded or corroded tubulars.

*The pipe spacer can be replaced with jewelry
such as gas lift mandrels, proﬁles, sliding sleeves, etc.

Historical straddle analysis
The history of tubing straddles set
at Prudhoe Bay from 1986 to 2005
is detailed in SPE 107069.1 The paper
also gives a complete description of
prestraddle diagnostics and includes
lessons learned from the 20-year
straddle program. The number of
straddles and the success rate have
varied considerably over the years and
are updated in Fig. 2 with data through
2007. A successful straddle is defined
as one that has passed a successful

tom of the packers and into the slips/
pack-off. Only one set of slips can be
used in the system and the optimum
placement for them is in the lower
packer. This is necessary because of the
axial movement of the assembly during
setting. If the upper slips are in place,
they will contact the tubing wall and
prevent any additional axial movement
down. This prevents the upper assembly
and spacer tubes from moving down
and energizing the lower pack-off. The
lower assembly is unable to move up
because it is retained by the lower slip.
The setting sequence design involves
the following:
1. Shear up and set lower slip. This
stops any additional axial movement
up.
2. Shear down and pack-off lower
element.
3. Shear down and pack-off upper
element.
4. Shear setting tool.
The use of only one slip section
to maintain the assembly in position
downhole has been determined to be
satisfactory for the straddle application.
The assembly is pressure balanced above
and below, thus no axial movement can
be induced due to pressure variations.
Pack-off energy is maintained in the
upper and lower elements via body lock
rings as originally designed.
The rubber elements consist of a
70 durometer center element and 90
durometer end elements. The Baker
Model No.10, E-4 setting tool is used to
generate the required mechanical axial
forces to squeeze the two packers into
a set position. Setting rods run through
the bore of the assembly and attach to
a wireline adapter kit. The adapter kit
is retained within a machined profile
within the bottom sub of the lower

psi. However, they have been tested in

high as 4,000 psi.

deployed a 31⁄2-in. straddle. The operations were similar to previous straddle
setting procedures. After performing
prestraddle diagnostics, technicians rig
up wireline on the well.1 They arm the
setting tools and make up the straddle.
The tool string consists of:
• Electric-line head (the weak point
and fishing neck in a small housing).
• Electronic release (disconnect).
• Casing collar locator.
• Baker-10 firing head.
On location, the operator test fires
through the tool string to ensure continuity. The unit is then powered down
and made up to the straddle that is
horizontal on the ground. The assembly
is pushed into the lubricator and a cap
is screwed onto the lubricator bottom.
The lubricator is picked up and stabbed
onto the wellhead. The lubricator is
pressure tested, the well is opened up,
and the toolstring is run in at a maximum speed of 100 fpm.
Third-party cranes are required for
longer straddles. Straddles are available in 5 ft increments up to 35 ft,
but straddle length should be kept to
a minimum length to ease handling
requirements.

and 1 hr 10 min with braided line, the

Inspection of the elements indicated
that the center element (70 durometer) had been compressed. It was a
little harder to discern that the two end
elements (90 durometer) had been
compressed (Figs. 5 and 6). However,
the force the middle element was subject to was also transmitted to the outer
elements. Both upper and lower packers
should have seen a minimum of 11,000
lb of compressional force. A thorough
inspection of the straddle confirmed the
o-rings, shear ring, slips, and elements
were in place and in good condition.
The temperature at the setting location was 35° F. and it is possible that
although the end elements were subject
to the same compressional force as the
middle element, they weren’t elastic
enough to extrude due to cold temperatures. Prior to the second straddle
attempt, 590 bbl of 180° F. seawater
and 225 bbl of 190º F. diesel were

the elastomers to pack-off. Baker set
the straddle successfully and it is still in

One mechanical change that was
recommended, but not implemented
was made to have a higher shear value
for greater pack-off force. This would
provide greater compressional force
from the initial shear. A softer element
could also be considered.
Although it is conjectured that temperature played a part in the failure of
this straddle, a 41⁄2-in. straddle was successfully set in the same well at 3,300 ft
and would have been subject to similar

Stuck straddles
Of the 29 single-set straddles that
Baker has run, two of them (7%) were
stuck above the target depth prior to
setting. This was significant because the
1986-2005 study of 263 straddles indicated that only six straddles (2%) had
become stuck due to tight spots which
were not noted in the prestraddle slickline drift.

worked with a 3.8-in. gauge ring, and

deviation at this gas lift mandrel, but no
significant doglegs in the vicinity. After
the straddle became stuck, the operator pulled off at the weak point. The
straddle was fished and the well was
redrifted with no problems noted.
A shorter straddle (21 ft, element
to element, 37 ft tool string overall
length) was then deployed. Although
the tool string lost weight at 10,977 ft
and continued to fall slowly, the straddle
was set on depth. The shorter straddle
was successfully deployed and pressure
tested and is still in service. It was likely

Fishing
There have been no problems fishing the single set straddles. On the two
operations where straddles were stuck,
wireline pulled out of the weak point
and slick line subsequently fished the
straddle. In retrospect, it may have been
better to set the straddle where it was
stuck and retrieve the setting tools,
rather than pulling out at the weak
point. Depending on wellbore configuration, setting the straddle may result in

In 2007, global LNG demand
reached about 172.2 million tonnes, a
rise of roughly 13 million tonnes (or
8%) compared with 2006. Fig. 1 shows
the largest growth on a percentage
basis occurred in the Americas (41%),
followed by Asia (10%), while Europe
(–7%) declined.
Interestingly, the situation was the
reverse of 2006, when Europe experienced the largest
growth rate in
imports due to a
cold winter and
strong demand
in the UK. The
Americas, on
the other hand,
saw imports decline by more than 7%
due to mild weather and ample storage, which stabilized prices and enabled
cargoes to be directed to other higher
value markets, particularly Asia. Asian
imports posted strong growth rates of
10% in 2006 and 11% in 2007, further
cementing the region as the most stable,
high growth market in the world.

ket for the second year running, led
Asia-Pacific LNG importers in absolute
growth. The rise in imports in 2007 can
be attributed in part to economic recovery and attractive LNG prices compared
with oil-based substitutes, which drove
demand in the industrial sector.
In the power sector, demand for LNG
expanded as power generation was affected by the closing of several nuclear
power plants, most notably TEPCO’s
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant, as
well as low utilization of hydropower
capacity due to lower-than-average
precipitation.
In Korea, imports increased marginally by about 0.3 million tonnes compared with 2006. The relatively flat level
of imports can be attributed to seasonally mild temperatures, particularly
in the first half of the year, although
imports began to pick up in the second
half, driven by stronger sales in the
power sector. These increased sales were
due to the lower generation unit cost
of gas vs. oil, coupled with relatively
strong electricity demand.
In Taiwan, LNG imports were up a
healthy 7% to 8.3 million tonnes yearon-year. The rise in imports was driven
by the power sector and to a lesser
extent the industrial sector, followed by
the residential sector. Taiwan imports
from the Atlantic Basin totaled about
1.21 million tonnes, with the largest
supplies stemming from Equatorial
Guinea, followed by Egypt and Nigeria.
The Atlantic Basin accounted for
nearly 15% of Taiwan’s portfolio in
2007, a significantly higher share than
that of the Asia-Pacific region as a
whole, which stood at 7%.

has not, however, signed any additional
supply contract so far to feed the additional capacity in the terminal.

Americas
Warm weather in Western Europe led
to record levels of LNG imports in the
Americas, particularly through August,
as the US confirmed its position as the
market of last resort. As a result, LNG
demand in the Americas increased by
5.6 million tonnes or 41% year-on-year
driven primarily by US demand, which
increased to 16.2 million tonnes.
In Mexico, the Altamira terminal,
which received its first LNG cargo in
August 2006, imported 2.0 million
tonnes in 2007 from Nigeria, Egypt,
and Trinidad. Imports will increase this
year with the commencement of the
Costa Azul terminal, though it remains
to be seen how much LNG will be attracted to the West Coast terminal given
strong demand in Asia.
Demand in the Dominican Republic
also increased slightly due to the relaxation of tensions on Atlantic Basin supply.

LNG supply
In 2007, global LNG supply grew by
about 13 million tonnes or 8% year-onyear. As was the case in 2006, production levels did not meet expected targets
due to projects delays (NLNG Train 6),
technical problems (Snohvit), feedstock
shortages (SEGAS and Bontang), as
well as unplanned outages (NWS). As
Fig. 2 shows, the largest supply growth
occurred in the Middle East at 15.5%,
followed by the Atlantic Basin at 1.16%,
and Pacific Basin at 0.7%.
LNG supply from the Middle East
continues to grow on the increased
output from Qatar and smaller increases
from Oman and Abu Dhabi. Since 2006,
Qatar has replaced Indonesia as the
world’s largest LNG producer accounting for 29.4 million tonnes of exports
in 2007. The incremental growth of 5
million tonnes year-on-year is primarily due to the start of RasGas Train 5 in

The terminal sits at the widest point
on the Sabine River Navigation Channel,
3.7 nautical miles from open water and
23 nautical miles from the outer buoy.
The channel is maintained at 40 ft deep
and not subject to tidal limitations, says
the company. The terminal’s two berths
are recessed far enough so that no part
of the LNG vessel will protrude into
the open waterway while docked, says
company material.

nearing completion, has built 10.1 bcf

an LNG capacity of 160,000 cu m and
a maximum continuous regasification

This scenario exaggerates the magnitude of the

since it excludes the effect of local demand, the
likelihood of noncoincident
demand peaks on different
pipeline systems, curtailments of receipts from the
East and South Texas corridors, and similar market
developments. The numbers,
however, still clearly show
that intense competition will

market implications:
• Demand for gas at the west
(Carthage) end of the corridor to fill
surplus capacity will drive up relative
prices in this area. Holders of capacity
on the new pipelines will bid up prices
in East Texas markets to secure volumes
to fill the new pipeline capacity. This
pattern has already become apparent in
the spot market following start-up of
Gulf South’s East Texas-to-Mississippi
expansion in February and March 2008.
• Capacity holders on the new
pipelines may bid prices high enough
to pull gas from other pipelines already
operating in the region.
• While limits exist on the availability of incremental production to fill new
pipeline capacity, enough new gas supplies will reach the eastern (Transco Sta-

tion 85) end of the region to
put downward price pressure
on the premium Southeast
market. Given downstream
constraints from that region,
this pressure could threaten
Transco Zone 4’s traditional
pricing premium, particularly after first-quarter 2009
completion of the Gulf Crossing pipeline. At that point the
difference between inbound
capacity and outbound capacity will reach its highest level
(Fig. 2).

Costs, differentials

projects and the rate design

benefits that frequently reflect
those efficiencies will lower

30% lower than the $0.155/

An even more dramatic shift will occur between Perryville and the premium Southeast market. A total of 4 bcfd
will be added on this route, increasing
total capacity by almost seven times. The
average ITC on this new capacity is only
$0.105/MMbtu, 50% below traditional
pipelines.
The sector between the Houston ship
channel and Henry Hub has run consistently full since autumn 2007. New
construction will increase capacity on
that sector by just 0.8 bcfd.
Since most of the new pipeline
capacity consists of additions to the
northern route (Carthage-Perryville)
and the southern route is at capacity on most days, the northern route
will emerge as the primary path for

Terminology
The Southeast US-Gulf Coast region can be viewed as a dense web
of interconnected pipeline systems
that crisscross in a network that defies
traditional analyses of natural gas flows
and capacities. Bentek has developed a
simplifying model to help understand
Southeast-gulf flows and capacities. The
resulting flow structure resembles a
horizontally stretched letter I (Fig. 3).
The I model simplifies analysis by assigning each existing and new pipeline
segment in the region to one of five
regional pipeline sectors.
Sector I-1 runs west-to-east from
Carthage, Tex., through Perryville, La.
Sector I-2 includes pipelines that move
gas in a west-to-east flow from the
Houston ship channel area into the
region around Henry Hub in Louisiana.
Sector I-3 runs from South Louisiana north to Perryville and includes
some pipelines that can flow gas south
from Perryville to South Louisiana.
Sector I-4 extends from North Louisiana eastward to Transco Station 85 in

Zone 4, TETCO M1, FGT Zone 3, and
Sonat, La.
Completion at the same time of the
Rockies Express pipeline into Lebanon
and Clarington, Ohio, will provide
another boost to Rockies prices, put
downward pressure on Ohio Valley
prices, and displace gas that has traditionally moved from the Southeast-gulf
region. These developments will combine to flatten basis differentials across
the Southeast and into the Ohio valley
area (OGJ, Apr. 2, 2007, p. 56).

Henry Hub
New pipeline capacity being built
from northeast Texas around Carthage
into eastern Louisiana near Perryville
will exceed new capacity being built
to move gas eastward from Perryville.
Surplus Perryville supplies can move
either north into the Midwest and Ohio
valley, or south by either physical movement or displacement, into pipelines
along the South Louisiana corridor to
the Henry Hub, and then north and east
to premium markets.
These capacity developments, in conjuction with unpredictable market conditions, will tend to make pricing flipflop between the northern and southern
pipeline corridors. Production growth
will eventually fill available capacity into
Perryville, increasing surplus supplies
at that location. Capacity limitations to
move gas north and east out of Perryville will then reverse some flows
that have traditionally moved north out
of South Louisiana. Those flows will
instead move south into the Henry Hub
and surrounding pipelines.
Four new LNG terminals are also

scheduled to be completed in the
Southeast-gulf region within the next
18 months, adding 7.1 bcfd of sendout capacity on the Louisiana and Texas
coast. Two of the new facilities, plus the
existing Lake Charles terminal, will add
6.0 bcfd of peak LNG sendout capacity
within 75 miles of Henry Hub.
Whether more than a few token
deliveries of LNG arrive at US Gulf
Coast terminals over the next few years
remains uncertain. But any cargoes
which do arrive will likely do so in the
summer, when demand in Europe and
Asia is at its lowest.
When surplus LNG arrives in the
Southeast-gulf region, the gas may
either move immediately into the
pipeline grid and presumably on to
market-area storage, move into existing
and new high-deliverability gulf-region
storage, or some combination of the
two. More than enough pipeline capacity should exist to handle LNG volumes
delivered into gulf-region storage.
Withdrawals, however, are another
matter. Market conditions will encourage withdrawals from existing and
new storage facilities during relatively
narrow time frames, resulting in excess
demand for pipeline capacity out of the
region.

volatility both there and at surrounding pricing hubs when LNG imports
enter the region. The tendency of new
transportation and storage capacity to
compress regional price differentials
and dampen the volatility of price
differentials across the entire market
will offset this trend. When combined,
these diverging developments suggest
basis as measured by the difference
between Henry Hub and other market
regions will become more volatile and
more heavily influenced by localized
market forces in the Southeast-gulf
region. ✦

The module accompanies the bottomhole assembly

parameters such as
pressure, temperature,
inclination, compression, and tensile and
impact loads.
The system was
deployed recently in Alaska, where it was
subjected to 24,000 impacts greater than
10,000 lb each over a 30-min interval
during a high-profile fishing operation.
During vibratory impacting, the tool
continued to acquire pressure, temperature, and strain data, performing without
interruption, the firm reports. The tool has
been used on more than 12 wells for various applications since. The system can be

The system can be applied in the following BHA configurations:
• Perforating.
• Fracturing.
• Inflatable packer setting.
• Bridge/plug setting/retrieval.
• Heavy duty fishing operations.
• Milling operation.
• Vibratory hammers.
• Hydraulic single shot hammers.
• Tractor deployment/measurement.
• Sliding sleeve manipulation and

Bush attempts
climate-change
damage control
The climate-change proposal by US
President George W. Bush deserves credit
for damage control.
On Apr. 16, Bush announced a goal of
halting the growth greenhouse-gas emissions by 2025.
The plan emphasizes technology, appeals for parallel efforts in all economically
growing countries, asserts the need for
accelerated cuts in power-plant emissions,

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

and relies on incentives, including for
nuclear energy.
Because it spurns mandates, the
proposal drew criticism from advocates of
aggressive climate-change response.
And because it presumes the need for
response, the plan alarmed observers who
remain doubtful about the ability of politics
to inﬂuence climate and worried about the
economic effects.
Bush disclosed at least part of his motivation by citing “a growing problem here at
home”: court rulings authorizing regulators
to limit greenhouse-gas emissions under
air-quality and other environmental laws.
“If these laws are stretched beyond their
original intent,” he said, “they could override the [energy] programs Congress just
adopted and force the government to regulate more than just power-plant emissions.”
The president rejected tax increases but
didn’t mention cap-and-trade schemes such
as the one proposed in a bill the Senate is
expected to consider soon (OGJ Online,
Apr. 8, 2008).
That’s appropriate. Economically, they
do the same thing: raise the cost of energy
use. With a direct tax, energy users see
what’s happening to them. Cap-and-trade
schemes camouﬂage the effects.
Either way, the costs are real.
A week before Bush spoke, the Congressional Budget Ofﬁce estimated costs of the
Senate bill—“revenues,” in the language of
ﬁscal politics: $1.2 trillion during 2009-18
net of income and payroll tax offsets. And
meeting mandates in the legislation would
cost private companies an estimated $90
billion/year during 2012-16, CBO says.
The average cost is $165 billion/year.
As a share of last year’s gross domestic
product, that’s 1.3%. For perspective: Receipts from the federal income tax this year,
according to an estimate by the Heritage
Foundation, will be 8.5% of GDP.
The cap-and-trade proposal by the Senate thus represents a hard punch to a jittery
economy. The pain is just harder to see
coming than that of a direct tax.

Weak dollar buoys oil prices
The US dollar at record lows against the euro, China’s robust demand for diesel,
and market concerns about supply and demand have pushed up oil prices more
than 18% so far this year, said analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James &
Associates Inc. in mid-April.
At Barclays Capital Inc., London, Paul Horsnell reported, “The drift up in prices
and the continuation in the reduction of resistance to higher prices along the curve
are still very much a function of perceived imbalances into the future. If we are correct in our view that non-OPEC supply will be at best very weak in 2008 and is likely
to fall, despite a decade of rising prices, the impact on perceptions of the long-term
clearing price is likely to be a powerful one and likely to be more powerful than any
perceived position in the short-term economic cycle.” He predicted, “The price highs
of the year are not yet in.”
Adam Sieminski, global energy economist for Deutsche Bank, said, “We believe
the oil price remains mesmerized by the course of the US dollar. If as we expect [the
euro] hits $1.62, it would imply the oil price rising to $118/bbl. However, it would
require oil prices hitting $145/bbl for the market capitalization of energy companies
on the Standard & Poor’s 500 to represent a similar share as tech stocks at the peak
of the internet bubble.”
The weak dollar has lowered the cost of oil to many foreign buyers and has
encouraged investments in crude as a hedge against the falling value of US currency
and fears of inﬂation.
As for natural gas, the current difference between gas prices in the US and UK
markets “will discourage ﬂows to the US,” said Sieminski. “While two new LNG
terminals took ﬁrst deliveries this week and another is coming on soon, we expect
utilization rates at these facilities will stay low unless US gas prices rise. We remain
bullish on price.”
Reﬁnery outages
Input of crude into US reﬁneries was down 113,000 b/d to 14.2 million b/d in the
week ended Apr. 11, with reﬁneries operating at 81.4% of capacity. Jacques H. Rousseau at Soleil-Back Bay Research said total reﬁned product inventories—including
gasoline, distillate, and jet fuel—declined more than 4 million bbl (1.1%) during
the week, due primary to lower supply. “We expect this trend of lower supply and
seasonally improving demand to continue in the coming weeks, but we remain
concerned that high retail gasoline prices will slow consumption growth during the
summer driving season,” Rousseau said.
In addition to planned maintenance and the seasonal turn-around efforts at
several reﬁneries, several have experienced unexpected disruptions of production.
BP PLC began Apr. 14 restarting an alkylation unit at its 460,000 b/d Texas City, Tex.,
reﬁnery. Just a day earlier, ExxonMobil Corp. began the restart of a CO boiler at ﬂuid
catalytic cracking unit No. 3 at its 53,000 b/d Baytown, Tex., reﬁnery.
An Apr. 10 ﬁre at an electrical substation at Marathon Oil’s 239,000 b/d reﬁnery in
Catlettsburg, Ky., forced the closure of the FCCU.
Sunoco Inc.’s 194,000 b/d Marcus Hook, Pa., reﬁnery was in restart mode Apr.
9 following an Apr. 7 power failure, according to a recent report by Dow Jones
Newswires, compiled from both ofﬁcial and unofﬁcial sources. Valero Energy Corp.’s
255,000 b/d Aruba reﬁnery is expected to operate at a reduced rate through April,
pending completion of repairs to a crude vacuum unit following a ﬁre on Jan. 25.
Coker repairs began in late March at Valero’s 210,000 b/d Delaware reﬁnery and are
expected to continue through early May.
At Lyondell Chemical Co.’s 268,000 b/d reﬁnery in Houston, an FCCU was shut
down Mar. 19 due to a compressor failure and is expected to restart in April. A
20,000 b/d FCC unit was shut in at Valero’s 340,000 b/d Corpus Christi reﬁnery. The
company’s 325,000-b/d Port Arthur reﬁnery is operating at 260,000-270,000 b/d during repairs to drum cracks on a coking unit.
A 43,000 b/d hydrocracker was shut down Apr. 12 at BP’s 260,000 b/d Carson,
Calif., reﬁnery following a ﬁre at an associated compressor. Exxon restarted a
hydrotreater that was idled Apr. 4 due to a ﬁre at its 152,500 b/d Torrance, Calif.,
reﬁnery. A 36,000 b/d hydrocracker was shut in Apr. 2 to repair a heat exchanger at
Valero’s 165,000 b/d Benecia, Calif., reﬁnery.

JULY 15 – 17, 2008
Calgary TELUS Convention Centre
Calgary, Alberta, Canada

INNOVATION OPENS THE DOOR
The oil sands of Alberta in western Canada are undergoing an investment boom worth more than $100
billion. From 2007 to 2016, the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board (EUB) projects total real investment
in Alberta’s oil sands (surface mining, upgrading, in situ, and support services) to reach Canadian $118
billion. Oil sands output is set to rise from about 1.2 million barrels a day to an expected 3 million b/d
by 2016, and perhaps 4 million plus by 2020. That could make Canada the world’s fourth-biggest oil
producer after Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States.
The Alberta oil sands and heavy oil industry is both a globally important and growing source of oil
supply as well as a vital breeding ground for production and environmental technology. As the boom
continues, share your ideas, experiences, technology, and expertise with major industry players who
must react quickly to the rapid expansion. Plan to attend the second annual Oil Sands and Heavy Oil
Technologies Conference & Exhibition, July 15 – 17, 2008 at the Calgary TELUS Convention Centre in
Calgary, Alberta Canada.

8:30 – 10:00 a.m.

SULFUR 1
Chair: Jim Hyne – HYJAY Research & Development
Co-Chair: Bob Tippee – Oil & Gas Journal
World Sulfur Perspective and its Impact on Canadian Sulfur
Bill Kennedy – retired from Shell Canada
Despite the present astronomical price of sulfur, which was unexpected by all, forecasts indicate
a substantial oversupply of this essential material is expected within a few years - this paper will
explore such issues and its impact on the Alberta sulfur industry.
Sulphur Output from Oilsands – Changing Alberta’s Sulfur Balance
Jerry d’Aquin – Con-Sul, Inc.
A review of oil sands projects with their possible sulfur production, combined with an outlook for gasderived sulfur output, yields one possible estimate of sulfur availability in Alberta for the coming decade
Logistical Alternatives and Challenges Facing Alberta’s Changing Sulfur Geography
C. Doug Houston – Kinder Morgan Canada Terminals Ltd.
Alberta’s oil sands processing investments and declining sour gas reserves will shift the centre of sulfur
production from southern to the northern Alberta centre, requiring new storage, forming and logistical
infrastructure to support the outﬂow of product.

TRACK 2:

EXTRACTION METHODS

8:30 – 10:00 a.m.

PRODUCTION 1
Chair: Mike Freeman – M-I SWACO
Co-Chair: Guntis Moritis – Oil & Gas Journal
Development of a Chemical Treatment for the Management of Wellbore Tar Adhesion
Dr. Gregory Perez – Halliburton
Rather than solvate the tar into the mud, an aqueous polymeric treatment has been developed aiming to
effectively minimize the inherent adhesive properties of the bitumen allowing for conventional solids control
equipment to remove the encapsulated bitumen as a ﬁrm solid
Slotted Pipes for Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD), Experimental Testing & Numerical
Modeling under Torsion & External Pressure Loads
Luciano Mantovano – TENARIS
Electro-Enhanced Oil Recovery (EEOR) Using Direct Current
Dr. Kenneth Wittle – Electro-Petroleum, Inc.
Field demonstrations of Direct Current stimulation of heavy oil ﬁelds showed changes in the produced ﬂuids
including an increased in oil production rates, reduced produced oil viscosity, reduction in water cut, reduced
H2S production, increased gas production, increased produced gas energy (heavy gas) content and reduced
PAH concentration which can be explained by well known electrochemical and electro kinetic processes.

TRACK 3:

UPGRADING METHODS

8:30 – 10:00 a.m.

UPGRADING 3
Chair: Shunlan Liu – AERI
Co-chair: Keng Chung – Well Resources
Bitumen Upgrading by Supercritical Water Cracking Coupled with SAGD Process
Jun Abe – JGC Corp.
Extra heavy oil such as Canadian bitumen is highly viscous and difﬁcult to transport through
pipeline. We have been developing an upgrading process of bitumen by supercritical water
cracking coupled with SAGD process.

8:30 – 10:00 a.m.

HTL Upgrading Value Proposition for Oil Sands
Edward Koshka – Ivanhoe Energy

Industry wins $1 billion in California OCS leases suit
The US Court of Appeals upheld the 2006 ruling by the Court of
Federal Claims awarding over $1 billion to 11 oil and gas companies that sued the government for its breach of nearly three dozen
oil and gas leases off California.
The award by the Court of Federal Claims was likely the largest
in that court’s 150-year history. In issuing its decision, the Federal
Circuit wrote that the government had breached the leases when it,
in effect, changed their terms after the leases had been issued.
The leases were sold in the early 1980s by the US Department
of the Interior as part of an effort to identify new sources of energy.
Through their exploration, the companies had discovered new oil
fields on federal lands off California, estimated by the federal government to contain over 1 billion bbl of oil. Under terms of their
contracts, the companies were given the right to “explore, develop,
and produce” oil and gas in the leased areas. However, production
drilling never commenced because subsequent changes in federal
law materially interfered with the companies’ efforts to develop
the reserves.
Covington & Burling LLP represented the 11 oil companies.
Partner Steven Rosenbaum, who delivered the oral argument before the Federal Circuit, said, “When any person, company or organization enters into a contractual agreement in this country, they
must fulfill the terms or pay damages, even if that entity is the US
government.”
In 2006, Rosenbaum successfully represented the American Petroleum Institute in a defense against a lawsuit seeking a prelimi-

nary injunction to prevent an OCS lease sale in the Western Gulf of
Mexico. He currently is representing API in defending a pending
challenge to the Department of the Interior’s 5-year OCS leasing
program.

IPAMS, IER energy ads target voters, conventions
As the US Democratic and Republican national conventions take
place, the Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States
in Denver and the Institute for Energy Research (IER) in Washington, DC, are running energy-themed advertising campaigns stressing the need for more US oil and gas production. The ads, targeting
officials, delegates, and voters, seek to educate Americans on the
role increased domestic production can play in creating jobs and
improving the US economy.
“Liberal activists have treated American energy like a four-letter
word for decades, even though it’s the key to our prosperity and
our high standards of living,” said IER Pres. Thomas Pyle. “They
would have American citizens believe that their country is running
out of oil and natural gas, that what does remain cannot be produced safely, and that development would only have a negligible
effect on price. These assertions are patently false,” Pyle declared.
“To meet America’s future energy demands, we will need all forms
of energy. Natural gas, the cleanest fossil fuel, needs to be a critical
component of any national energy policy.”
IPAMS is running its ads in Denver during the Democratic National Convention, while IER’s radio commercials and newspaper
advertisements will run in Arkansas, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada,
and North Dakota. ✦

Queensland bans oil shale projects for 2 years
The Queensland government has placed a 2-year moratorium
on oil shale projects, paralyzing the proposed Queensland Energy
Resources Ltd. (QER) project in the McFarlane deposit about 15
km south of Proserpine on the state’s central east coast.
The project would entail bulk sampling and open-cut exploration of about 400,000 tonnes of oil shale material in the area.
Queensland Premier Anna Bligh flew to north Queensland recently to formally block the $14 billion (Aus.) project.
She cited concerns of community and environmental groups
who maintain that the Whitsunday region tourism industry and
the Great Barrier Reef are at risk if the project proceeded.
The premier widened the ban by imposing the moratorium on
all new oil shale projects while it investigates the environmental
impacts of shale oil mining.
Only one lease—around the Stuart deposit near Gladstone—is
current, and that was granted by the previous government in the

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

1980s. Bligh declared, “No new shale oil mines will be permitted
in the state.”
The move has created an outcry by the mining industry, with
Queensland Resources Council CEO Michael Roche accusing the
government of protecting the marginal Labor Party seat of Whitsunday at an election due later this year.
He added that exploration companies already rank Queensland
as the least attractive jurisdiction in Australia, and the latest decision will simply reinforce that view.
“Sovereign risk is a key consideration with billions of dollars at
stake,” he added.
For its part QER says the government’s move is premature. A
company statement said: “The company remains convinced that
developing the state’s strategically important oil shale resources is
in the best long-term interest of both Queensland and Australia.”
Only 2 weeks ago the company announced it had abandoned
the Alberta-Taciuk Processor (ATP) revolving kiln oil-shale process-

vast oil shale deposits along the east coast of Queensland (OGJ
Online, Aug. 14, 2008).
Paraho II technology has already been tested with more than
8,000 tonnes of Queensland oil shale samples.
QER says the deposits have the potential to produce 1.6 billion
bbl of shale oil over the next 40 years.

StatoilHydro makes gas ﬁnd in Barents Sea
StatoilHydro AS discovered natural gas within the Arenaria prospect on Block 7224/6 in the Barents Sea but said it’s too early to
tell if the gas can be produced because it’s from poor quality reservoir rocks of middle Triassic age.
StatoilHydro drilled the exploration well with the Polar Pioneer
drilling rig to prove hydrocarbons in sandstone of early Jurassic to
late Triassic age. After reaching a vertical depth of 2,315 m below
sea level, it did not find any hydrocarbons in its primary target
despite there being good reservoir sands.
The gas discovery was its secondary goal. It will now permanently plug and abandon the well.
This well was compulsory under its work program and the first
on Exploration License 394, which was awarded in 2006.

Dong makes oil ﬁnd on Ipswich prospect
Dong E&P Norge AS has discovered oil on the Ipswich prospect
in the southern Norwegian North Sea about 290 km southwest of
Stavanger.
If the prospect is commercial, it could be tied back to nearby
Oselvar gas-condensate field. Dong plans to submit a development
and operation plan to the Norwegian government in first-quarter
2009. Wildcat exploration well 1/3-11 and sidetrack 1/3-11 T2
discovered oil in Paleocene rocks. The oil column is at least 60 m
oil with reservoir properties comparable to Oselvar.
Dong and its partners did not test the well, which was drilled by
the Maersk Guardian jack up rig in 72 m of water. The main well
was drilled to 3,232 m and the sidetrack to 3,465 m subsea, and
both finished early Paleocene rocks.
The well will be permanently plugged and abandoned. The
Maersk Guardian rig will then move to Production License 289
and drill exploration well 3/7-7 for Dong on the Marsvin prospect. ✦

Chevron to develop Hebron heavy oil off Canada
Chevron Canada Ltd. and its coventurers have this summer finalized legal agreements with Newfoundland and Labrador to develop
the Hebron heavy oil fields off northeastern Canada.
The complex consists of Hebron, Ben Nevis, and West Ben Nevis
fields, which lie in the Jeanne d’Arc basin between the Hibernia and
Terra Nova production areas on the Grand Banks (see map, OGJ,
Feb. 14, 2005, p. 32). The complex is 210 miles off Newfoundland
and Labrador in 300 ft of water. Hebron was discovered in 1981,
but the project was put on hold in 2006 when the operator could
not reach an agreement with Newfoundland and Labrador.
Recovering 19-21° gravity heavy oil in the area’s harsh conditions presents a challenge, and the reservoir characteristics are
technically complex and demanding. Chevron Canada, operator
of the complex, said the field is “expected to be developed using
a gravity-based structure with integrated drilling and production
topsides.”
The Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum
Board (C-NLOPB) in 2006 estimated that the Hebron complex
contains 731 million bbl of proved and probable oil resources,
about 30 million bbl of natural gas liquids, and 429 bcf of natural gas, based on geologic, petrophysical, and reservoir simulation
studies and drilling results (OGJ, June 19, 2006, p. 29) and (July
3, 2006, p. 52). Chevron estimates recoverable oil to be in the
400-700 million bbl range.
Chevron Canada holds a 26.63% working interest in the project.
Other partners are ExxonMobil Canada Properties 36.04%, PetroCanada 22.73%, StatoilHydro Canada Oil & Gas Inc. 9.7%, and Oil
& Gas Corp. of Newfoundland and Labrador 4.9%.

“Drilling of exploration well 7224/6-1 was completed by the
Polar Pioneer drilling unit at a water depth of 265 m. Polar Pioneer
will now start drilling exploration well 7222/11-1 in the StatoilHydro-operated Exploration License 228,” the company said.

Chevron Canada holds an ongoing financial interest also in the
Hibernia and Terra Nova offshore oil projects, and in exploration
in the Orphan basin.

Vanco, Lukoil lease drillship for Ghana deep water
Vanco Ghana Ltd. and partner Lukoil Overseas Ghana Ltd. have
completed contractual arrangements with Aban Loyd for use of its
Aban Abraham dynamic positioning drillship to drill the Dzata-1
wildcat on deepwater Cape Three Points Block off Ghana. The drillship can drill down to about 19,350 ft.
The vessel is in Sembawang Shipyard in Singapore being retrofitted to enable the unit to drill in as much as 2,000 m of water.
When shipyard activities are complete, the Aban Abraham will mobilize to West Africa and drill the Dzata-1 in the fourth quarter.
Cape Three Points Block encompasses 1.25 million acres in
200-3,000 m of water. The Dzata prospect lies 70 miles southeast
of Jubilee field, which has estimates of 500 million-1.8 billion bbl
of recoverable oil, “confirming an active petroleum system in the
Tano basin and heightening the exploration activity in the region,”
Vanco said. Jubilee is expected to produce about 20,000 b/d of
oil (OGJ Online, July 16, 2008). In addition to the Vanco-Lukoil
partnership, other companies working off Ghana are Devon Energy,
Amerada Hess Corp., Anadarko, Tullow Oil, and Kosmos Energy.
The industry plans to drill several wells in the area in the next few
months.
On Cape Three Points, Vanco had 2D and 3D seismic surveys
shot, which revealed large compressional folds in a newly recognized subbasin. The Dzata (Lion) prospect represents one of nine
major structural and stratigraphic prospects on the block.

ticlinal structure with numerous Lower and Upper Cretaceous potential reservoir horizons and distinct direct hydrocarbon indicators, including flat spots and a gas ‘chimney,’” said Vanco. The well
will be drilled to 4,900 m TD—3,031 m below the mud line.
Vanco Pres. Gene Van Dyke said the companies had worked for
more than a year to secure the Aban Abraham drilling slot in a
tightening deepwater rig market, and they intend to secure additional slots for other planned wells in West Africa.
Vanco, which is serving as operator of Cape Three Points Block,
holds a 28.34% interest in the property, with Lukoil holding a
56.66% stake. State oil company Ghana National Petroleum Corp.
holds a 15% carried interest.

Pemex annual oil output slides 10%; Cantarell 36%
Production from Mexico’s Cantarell oil field fell 36% over the
past year, reducing the country’s overall oil production and creating a sharp decline in its exports.
“New fields aren’t coming on line fast enough to replace Cantarell,” said Jesus Reyes Heroles, general director of Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex).
Reyes’ remarks coincided with an announcement by Pemex that

Processing
Regulators clear parcels at Marathon reﬁnery
Two portions of Marathon Petroleum Co.’s refinery complex at
Garyville, La., have been designated ready for reuse, federal and
state environmental regulators jointly announced on Aug. 20.
A 4.5-acre land farm and a 10.2-acre land treatment unit which
the Marathon Oil Corp. division used for land treatment of various refinery sludges from 1989 to 1998 received the designation,
the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality said.
Marathon’s successful completion of investigation and risk
management activities have made conditions at the sites protective
of human health and the environment based on their current and
planned uses, officials of the two agencies said during an Aug. 20
ceremony at the plant. The properties adjoin processing and utility
facilities, they noted.
“Marathon has demonstrated that a clean environment is important to them. This ceremony is a testament to fine work many
people put into cleaning up this land and getting it ready to be
put back into commerce,” Louisiana DEQ Assistant Secretary Lou
Buatt said.

Pakistan reﬁneries protest lower products duties
The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of Pakistan has
rejected a claim by the country’s refineries that they face loss under the reduced “deemed duty” (ad valorem surcharge) that they
now are allowed to charge. ECC asked the Ministry of Petroleum
and Natural Resources to submit each refinery’s financial results
separately to determine the impact of the reduced-duty formula
on the refineries.
Pakistan’s five refineries have a total refining capacity of 267,000
b/d. A sixth is under construction and expected to begin products

in the first 7 months of 2008 the state firm produced an average of
2.84 million b/d of oil, down 10% from the same period in 2007.
Pemex confirmed that the decline in production is due mainly
to the fall-off in production from Cantarell. It said the giant field
produced 1.12 million b/d, a figure 472,000 b/d less than during
the same period a year before.
Between January and July of 2008, Pemex exported an average of
1.44 million b/d, or 16.3% less than the same period in 2007. But income from crude exports during January-July totaled $30.08 billion,
or 51.8% higher than in 2007, due to the surge in global prices.
Mexico’s production of natural gas stood at 6.75 bcfd during
the first half, representing a 13% increase compared with the same
period in 2007.
The Pemex refinery system produced 1.5 million b/d of gasoline, diesel, and other fuels during the same period, while imports
of gasoline averaged 342,500 b/d, up 17.6% over the January-July
2007 period.
Pemex said the total volume of petroleum product imports in
January-July rose to 555,100 b/d, on average, or 22.2% greater
than such purchases during the January-July 2007 period, at a total
cost of $14.08 billion. ✦

production for export, in spring 2009. Four of the refineries meet
the country’s domestic market demand for petroleum products.
A report on refineries’ profit considered by ECC in one of its
previous meetings contradicted the refiners’ claims of facing huge
losses, despite an enormous increase in the cost of imported crude
oil feedstocks. ECC indicated that each refinery’s profit had increased 15-18 times during the last 6 years. This kind of profit is
only possible when a section of the economy enjoys protection
such as the deemed duty, the committee said.
Following the ECC directive, the ministry will ask the refineries
to submit their financial results for the first quarter of the current
fiscal year. These financial results will be presented to ECC for its
consideration.
The outcome also will affect the new refinery under construction. Indus Refinery Ltd. (IRL) is scheduled to start commercial
production of petroleum products in March 2009 from a 100,000
b/d refinery under construction near Karachi. IRL’s foreign investors hold 86.7% of the shareholding, while local sponsors hold
13.3%.
IRL CEO Sohail Shamsi said the company’s investment was based
on the existing formula and would be wasted if the refinery could
not make a profit. He said Pakistan’s refineries were operating on
low fixed margins, contrary to the belief that they made windfall
gains.
Because in 2007 gasoline demand in Pakistan was declining, the
refinery plans to export its products. The refinery would produce 1
million tonnes/year of kerosene, 1.5 million tonnes of low-sulfur
diesel, and 500 tonnes/day of liquefied petroleum gas. It also will
produce propane, butane, high quality unleaded gasoline, and aviation fuels.
Oil consumption in Pakistan recorded a growth of 8.3% in the

Fitch: Kazakh lines enter 5 years of investment
Kazakhstan’s oil and gas pipeline operators, according to Fitch
Ratings, are set to embark on intensive investment programs over
the next 5 years to capitalize on favorable oil and gas industry fundamentals, as well as increased demand from a rapidly growing
Kazakh economy.
“Whilst the credit impact of these programs will be more
pronounced in the short-term, it could be limited in the longrun based on the nature of projects funding,” the ratings agency
said.
KazTransGas (KTG), a national operator of gas pipelines in Kazakhstan, has increased capital expenditure plans with a view to
investing more than $8 billion in the construction of three gas
pipelines, including the West-South gas pipeline, the China gas
pipeline and the By-Caspian gas pipeline.
In turn, Kazakhstan’s state-run oil pipeline operator KazTransOil
(KTO) intends to invest more than $2 billion in the construction
of two new oil pipelines.
The two new lines include the Kenkiyak-Kumkol route,
which will connect western Kazakhstan to China, and a link
between the Kashagan oil field and a new export terminal on
the Caspian Sea.
Moreover, according to Fitch, the consortium operating the
Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) pipeline is considering the
possibility of pipeline capacity expansion, with the costs estimated
at some $2.5 billion.
Angelina Valavina, Director of Fitch’s energy, utilities, and regulation team, said that while implementation of the construction
and expansion projects unveiled by Kazakh pipeline operators will
put pressure on the companies’ credit metrics in the short-term,
“the impact of escalating capex is likely to be subdued in the medium to long-term due to the flexibility of financing options available to operators.”
Fitch noted that nonrecourse financing is emerging as an important financing tool in the region, as demonstrated by KTO’s
financing of the Kenkiyak-Kumkol route construction. KTG is also
currently negotiating for financing of the China gas pipeline to
be arranged by its JV counterparty—CNPC—without recourse to
KTG.
Fitch also noted that some projects are expected to be partly or

fully state-funded given their social and political importance such
as the construction of the West-South gas pipeline by KTG.

Enbridge calls open season for Texas gas line
Enbridge Energy Partners LP, Calgary, and Atmos Pipeline &
Storage LLC, Dallas, issued a solicitation of interest Aug. 25 for
firm transportation service on a proposed 100-mile, 1 bcfd natural gas pipeline in Texas called the Barnett Intrastate Gas (BIG)
pipeline.
The BIG pipeline would connect Atmos Energy’s Line X in Johnson County, Tex., to Enbridge’s Double D and Clarity pipelines at
Bethel in Anderson County, Tex.
Bridging the two companies’ systems, BIG would provide shippers access to gas from the Waha, Barnett Shale, Bossier sands, and
Anadarko basin producing regions. “Delivery points would include
multiple market options at the Enbridge Carthage Hub in Panola County, Tex., and the Enbridge Southeast Texas Hub in Orange
County,” Enbridge said.

Nabucco capacity attracts strong shipper interest
Potential natural gas shippers on the proposed 31 billion cu m/
year Nabucco gas pipeline have booked out capacity on a nonbinding basis, suggesting a strong demand in western Europe for new
gas supplies from the Caspian and the Middle East.
Nabucco, which is behind the €7.9 billion project, carried out a
survey to assess market interest. “Nabucco capacities are more than
100% overbooked by potential shippers from day one in 2013 on
a long term basis,” the company said.
The European Union has given support to the pipeline to reduce the EU’s reliance on Russian gas supplies.
Construction of the 3,300-km line, which will extend from
the Caspian Sea to Austria via Turkey and the Balkan states, will
occur in two phases: The first, which will have an initial capacity
of 8 billion cu m/year, is expected to start in 2010 and complete
in 2013.
The second construction phase will start in 2013 and complete
at yearend 2014. It will extend from the Turkish border through
Iran to Georgia. It will carry some 31 billion cu m of gas/year to
the European Union from the Middle East and Central Asia (OGJ
Online, July 14, 2008). ✦

Two Minute Warning!
Polyguard announces
RD6 - OS coating
for offshore girth welds.
warning to our competitORS:
• Your girth weld coating takes 4 + minutes to install.
• RD6 - OS takes about 2 minutes.
• Effective immediately, your system may be obsolete.

ANNOUNCEMENT TO USERS OF
OFFSHORE GIRTH WELD COATINGS:
YOUR COATING QUALITY JUST WENT UP — FOR TWO REASONS
1. In offshore pipeline construction, the rule of thumb for a ‘quick lay’ of pipe is four minutes. That’s about the
time of a welding cycle. When the welding cycle is finished, the superintendent wants to pull the next joint.
If girth weld coating installation isn’t complete, it slows the whole job down. There is a lot of pressure to hurry,
and that can affect coating quality.
2. RD6 has demonstrated, in twenty years of use on Big Oil pipelines, that it is a non-shielding coating.
CP current could reach the pipe surface if the coating were ever to disbond from the pipe surface.

YOUR PROJECT COST JUST WENT DOWN — FOR FIVE REASONS
The five reasons are — five less installation steps. RD6 - OS requires no torch. This means no preheating the
steel, no heating the underlap, no heating the overlap, no heating the closure, no heating circumferentially around
the pipe, no heating until recovery is complete. Far less application steps… far less possibility for human error.
The truth is, the machine assisted RD6 - OS coating will be finished before a torched coating is past the first step of
steel preheating.

Challenge us to prove our two minute claim.

A peek at deepwater life
Nina M. Rach
Drilling Editor
Exploration and development of
petroleum resources in deep water
requires extreme engineering. Often
equated with the technical demands
of working in space, the high pressures and low temperatures of the deep
ocean’s extreme conditions require
highly engineered robotics and thermal
protection systems.
Images provided by remotely operated vehicles 1-2 miles below the ocean
surface give us a glimpse of unusual
creatures and ecosystems. ROVs run by
Oceaneering International Inc. in the
western Gulf of Mexico have repeatedly
sighted big fin squid at two locations in
the Alaminos Canyon area, examples of
a genus named only 10 years ago.

Big ﬁn squid
Mike Vecchione, director of cephalopod biology at the National Systemics
Laboratory for National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration’s fisheries
service, and Richard Young at the University of Hawaii established the genus
Magnapinna in 1998.
Vecchione said two species of big

eering has been involved with Perdido
operations since June 2007. They often
see marine life at depth, he said, but the
animals come and go quickly. But he
mentioned a large grouper that blocked
an ROV in 1993 and shut down operations for several hours.
Clay Groves, an ROV superintendent
for Oceaneering, told OGJ he has seen
big fin squid seven times at Perdido.
The most recent encounter was on Aug.
27 while drilling a Silvertip well in Alaminos Canyon Block 815 in 9,300 ft of
water. It was picked up by color camera
on the Millennium 33 ROV and the
black and white camera on the smaller
Hydra Min 7 ROV.
The squid have greenish bodies and
red-orange markings, Groves said. The
legs are unusually articulate, projecting sideways and then straight down.
Overall size appears to be 15 ft.
Groves has seen many different
marine creatures at great depths, but he
said the Perdido squid are unusual bePerdido

fin squid have been identified from the
Gulf of Mexico: Magnapinna atlantica
and M. pacifica.
“They’re truly bathypelagic animals,”
he told OGJ; “We’ve now seen them in
a lot of places, always in waters below
1,000 m.”
This marks the base of the “twilight
zone,” defined as the deepest point of
detected penetration of natural sunlight,
generally coinciding with the bottom of
the permanent thermocline and marked
by a recognizable faunal change.
Vecchione contributes research to the
Census of Marine Life, a 10-year global
scientific initiative (www.coml.org).
COML anticipates completing its
“World Register of Marine Species” by
2010. The world’s first comprehensive
list of past and present species, it currently includes about 122,500 validated
marine species names—more than half
of the estimated 230,000 marine species known to science.

This Magnapinnid species, a “big fin” squid, was sighted in 7,828 ft of water on Alaminos Canyon Block 857 in the Gulf of Mexico. Photos from Clay Groves

The Democrats’ wish list
From faulty premises flow illogical conclusions.
The energy plank of the Democratic Party’s presidential campaign platform starts wrong and ends
wrong (see story, p. 28).
The energy plank gets one assertion right when
it says about the US, “We know we can’t drill our
way to energy independence.” The country in fact
has no way—no matter how much it drills, no
matter how much it conserves, and no matter how
much it supports renewable energy—to achieve
energy independence.
But campaign platforms aren’t designed to
affirm the granitic truths of physics and economics, and this one is no different. The energy-plank
statement uses the futility of energy independence
to dismiss oil and gas drilling but retains the
goal in service to “renewable energy technologies such as solar, wind, and geothermal as well
as technologies to store energy through advanced
batteries and [efforts to] clean up our coal plants.”
All it takes is “our ingenuity and legendary hard
work”—and, of course, money.

Classic errors
Even by the standards of campaign platform
planks, which are written for elections and not
policy-making, this one is loony. It errs in classic
ways. For example:
• It relies on numerical targets set by government while
paying little or no regard to economic or physical practicalities.
The energy plank calls on the US to become
50% more energy-efficient by 2030 than it is now,
to double the fuel-efficiency requirements of new
vehicles, and to derive 25% of its electricity from
renewable energy sources by 2025. Numeric targets
imply seriousness of purpose. But the only stated
purpose in the Democrats’ energy plank is energy
independence, which—to repeat—is unattainable.
• Its execution would require massive public spending.
In fact, the energy plank is nothing but public
spending—for research and development dedicated to cellulosic ethanol and other biofuels, for
federal-local partnerships, for federal and military
purchasing benefiting upstart energy technologies. Like numeric targets, commitments of money
seem to demonstrate seriousness of purpose. Yet
governments seldom spend funds they receive
20

from taxpayers the same way taxpayers would
spend the money if allowed to keep it. There are
good reasons to accommodate this conflict, such
as defense, law enforcement, public health and
environmental programs, and aid to the poor. But
government spending should happen only for
good reasons. Support of noncommercial fuels can
be such a reason but too often just wastes money.
• It perpetuates the demonstrable falsehood that the government makes sensible choices about fuels use.
Historically, the government has made remarkably poor choices about fuel use. Who, other than
corn growers, now thinks a large and growing
mandate for ethanol in gasoline makes sense? Yet
the assumed superiority of government fuel decisions lurks beneath every splinter of the Democratic energy plank.
• It makes unsupportable economic claims.
The plank promises “a green energy sector
that will create up to 5 million jobs.” Ridiculous.
The forced use of noncommercial energy creates
costs. So do aggressive efforts to cut greenhouse
gas emissions, such as the cap-and-trade scheme
that the Democrats say will fund their spending
on governmental energy. Elevated costs create net
employment losses. Yes, some people would move
into new jobs at those “green” energy enterprises
created by government and supported by taxpayers. But many more people would lose jobs as
governmentally mandated and heavily subsidized
energy pillaged the economy.

Wish lists
Campaign planks are just wish lists, of course.
They’re designed to attract votes. The Democrats
pointed out that their energy wish list came from
30,000 people attending 1,645 meetings held
throughout the US.
The assembly of a wish list designed to attract
votes is not the same as serious discussion about
energy in an interdependent and competitive
world. The US needs such a discussion more than
it needs ethanol from cellulose or forests of wind
turbines. As long as energy independence remains
the motivating premise of Americans in large
numbers, serious discussion about energy will
remain the biggest wish of all. ✦

US-based oil and gas producers and
refiners reported higher second-quarter
2008 earnings as a group, but individual company results were highly varied.
The combined earnings of a sample of
these firms were up 10% from a year
earlier.
Meanwhile, a sample of producers
and pipeline companies headquartered
in Canada posted a collective 13%
increase in net income for the
second quarter, and a group
of service and supply companies reported a combined
earnings increase of nearly
5% from a strong year-earlier
period.
High oil prices buoyed
the combined second-quarter results of
the operators, but downstream earnings were crushed by the high cost of
inputs. Natural gas prices were up from
the second quarter of last year, too, but
many producers reported lower earnings as a result of hedging losses. Companies also incurred higher operating
expenses, while higher feedstock costs

Integrated companies

The large, integrated oil companies
in the sample of US-based operators
reported stronger earnings as a result
of higher oil and gas price realizations
compared with those a year earlier, but
all of them recorded meager downstream results.
The largest company in the group,
ExxonMobil, reported record earnings
of $11.68 billion for the second quarter, a 14% increase from a year earlier,
as revenues gained 40% to top $138
billion. Downstream and chemicals
earnings slumped, but record oil and
gas realizations increased earnings by
$6.1 billion.
ExxonMobil said that lower sales
volumes, higher operating costs, and
increased taxes reduced the company’s
earnings somewhat, as its total production decreased 8% from second-quarter
2007.

announced an unrealized noncash,
after-tax mark-to-market loss of $2.085
billion from future-period natural gas,
oil, and interest rate hedges, mostly as
a result of higher oil and gas prices as
of June 30, 2008, compared with Mar.
31, 2008.
For the recent second quarter,
Petrohawk reported revenues of $305
million, a 31% increase over secondquarter 2007 revenues, but the company incurred a $92.8 million loss for
the 3 months ended June 30.

a realized loss from natural gas derivatives of $1.51/Mcf. The company’s average realized oil price for the quarter was
$79.84/bbl, which included a $38.01/
bbl realized loss from oil derivatives.
Petrohawk’s total loss on derivatives
contracts was $277.6 million for the

ly Corp., Valero, and Tesoro, posted weak
results due to low refining margins.
Independent refiners’ profitability could be further reduced in coming quarters, according to Friedman,
Billings, Ramsey & Co. analyst Eitan
Bernstein, as a slowdown or contraction of the US and global economies
dampens the growth in demand for
refined products, lowering sales prices
for gasoline, heating oil, diesel fuel, and
other products.
Holly Corp. reported that its secondquarter net income declined to $11.5

million from $158.6 million in the
same period of 2007. For the first 6
months of this year, net income was
$20.1 million compared with $226.2
million for the first half of 2007.
The refiner’s revenues were up for
the recent quarter and for the first half
due to higher refined product sales
prices, but earnings were hit on a
couple of fronts. Holly’s Navajo refinery in Artesia, NM in May experienced
unplanned downtime for repairs to its
fluid catalytic cracking unit following
an instrument control malfunction, and
the company’s Woods Cross, Utah refinery operated at reduced rates during
the quarter primarily due to multiple
power interruptions.
Holly also said that its earnings in
the first half decreased due to reduced
refined-product margins combined
with production declines, lower yields,
and higher operating expenses.
Meanwhile, Valero reported a 67%
decline in second-quarter earnings to
$734 million, and Tesoro’s earnings
declined 99% from a year earlier to $4
million.

Canadian operators

and pipeline operators based in Canada
recorded a combined increase in earnings for the second quarter, but four of
the 14 companies posted a net loss for
the period.
With net income up 345%, Enbridge
Inc. announced the largest percentage gain in earnings from the second
quarter of 2007. Net income was $659
million (Can.) on revenues of $3.87
billion (Can.).
Enbridge said the increase reflects
a $556.1 million after-tax gain on the
sale of its interest in Compania Logistica
de Hidrocarburos CLH SA, a Spanish
pipeline company, and favorable operating performance, partially offset by unrealized fair value losses on derivatives.
Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.
posted a $347 million (Can.) loss for
the second quarter, which the company
attributed primarily to risk management
losses. Higher product prices would
have otherwise resulted in earnings of
$960 million (Can.) for the quarter,
despite a nearly 7% production decline
from the second quarter of last year.

companies during the second quarter
and first half of this year.
The 24 companies in this sample
posted a combined 5% increase in
earnings for the recent quarter, as their
revenues climbed 26%.
Although none of these firms reported a loss for the 3 months, eight of
them announced a decline in earnings
from the second quarter of last year.
Only two of these firms reported a
reduction in second-quarter revenues
from a year earlier.
Transocean Inc. merged with GlobalSantaFe Corp. in November 2007 and
reported that its earnings and revenues
for the second quarter and the first half
of 2008 were more than double its
results from a year earlier.
Halliburton Co. announced its net
income in second-quarter 2008 was
$507 million, down from $1.5 billion
in the second quarter of 2007. Halliburton had completed its separation
of KBR Inc. in second quarter 2007
and recorded to discontinued operations a gain of $933 million, accounting for the strong second-quarter 2007
results. ✦

able Energy. He said using less energy
and finding more sources go hand in
hand. Although Americans have driven
52 billion miles less in the wake of recent high prices, he said, it is important
that policymakers enact long-term legislation that will attract investors needed
to develop long-term solutions.
“The politicization of energy is
harming everyday citizens,” he said,
because much of the short-term policy
enacted is of value only to politicians
seeking the next election and does not
result in development of needed technology as fast as it should.
Amy Myers Jaffe, the Wallace S.
Wilson Energy Studies Fellow at Rice
University’s James A. Baker III Institute
for Public Policy, emphasized how critical the effects of geopolitics are on US
national security as well as its energy
security. She said developing domestic alternatives to the energy sources
that fuel our economy is important to
reduce US vulnerability in light of the
post-9/11 environment.
“What are the consequences of our
being cut off from [oil] sources?” she
asked. “Oil producers are using our

dependence as political leverage.” She
added, saying, “Our dependence on foreign sources of oil places constraints on
how far we can push regarding managing human rights and other issues.”
And although saying a US ally of
30 years, Saudi Arabia, has been like a
“prince on a white horse” to the US—
increasing production after 9/11 and
after the US went into Iraq—she said,
“Demand has burgeoned, and Saudi
Arabia has not invested [the billions]
needed” to continue to provide extra
amounts when needed. “No matter
how close an alliance is, it is better to
squeeze the amount we need from our
own resources and efficiencies than to
rely on alliances with other producers.”
Jaffe urged that Democrats and Republicans compromise to allow new drilling
and to use the royalties from it to pay
for developing supplementary alternative energy sources. “It’s going to take an
incredible amount of capital, including
public and private funds, in this effort.”
Clay Sell, president of Hunt Energy
Horizons and a former deputy US Energy secretary, said a national electricity
transmission grid is needed to provide

access to natural energy from areas
of the country “where the sun shines
brightest, and the wind blows hardest,”
but where there currently are too few
people to warrant having built such
infrastructure. “We need a transmission
grid to the marketplace,” he said.
Another “great untapped energy
source,” he said, is greater efficiency in
the utility industry, and in new buildings and appliances. “Utility regulators
must put in place policy for efficiency,”
he said, along with investment tax
credits so that long-term investments
can occur.
The fifth speaker, Stuart C. Strife,
vice-president for exploration at
Anadarko Petroleum Corp., explained
to the nonenergy-industry audience
that “Over 50% of [US energy needs]
to 2030 and possibly beyond will be
provided by oil,” and that “we consume
about 24% of the oil in the world.”
Noting also that “US producers provide
about 85% of our natural gas needs,
importing only 15%,” he said we need
to “develop technology to take more
advantage of natural gas to address our
energy needs.” ✦

Dealing with CSB’s
‘investigative gap’

T

he Government Accountability
Office has concluded that the US
Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) could investigate
more accidents if it would use its
statutory authority to solicit other
entities’ work in some cases.
The agency, which has operated
since 1998, had a fiscal 2006 budget
one-eighth the size of the National
Transportation Safety Board, on
which it was modeled, GAO said in
an Aug. 22 report. Yet NTSB investigated 250 times as many accidents
because it used other agencies’ findings when it could not send investigators to an accident site, the congressional watchdog service said.
It suggested that CSB needs to deal
with what GAO called an “investigative gap,” the difference between the
number of accidents investigated and
the number triggering CSB’s investigative responsibility.
In fiscal 2007, CSB was notified of
920 accidents, 35 of which involved
at least one fatality, “and CSB investigated one of these,” according to GAO.
It said officials said the agency lacks
the resources to investigate more than
a small percentage of accidents that
meet its statutory criteria.

rative reports on what happened and
why,” Bresland said.
OSHA, EPA, state fire marshals, fire
departments, and police also have law
enforcement and regulatory responsibilities (unlike CSB) that necessarily
focus on rules violations instead of the
overall adequacy of existing rules, standards, and industry practices, Bresland
said. Such agencies are often reluctant
to share the results of their ongoing
investigations with CSB, he said.

Companies’ investigations

Most companies experiencing significant chemical accidents involving
death or injuries become involved in
lengthy lawsuits and conduct investigations that legal privilege often
protects, Bresland said. Even if CSB
was able to obtain and rely on one as
a primary source, it could undermine
the agency’s credibility, he indicated.
GAO also said in its report that
CSB needs to improve its accident data, hire more investigators
and open regional offices, address
accountability and management
problems, and have a permanent,
independent inspector general.
The day before GAO released
its report, CSB announced that it is

buildings; and would use federal and
military purchasing programs to encourage promising new markets and
technologies.
“This plan will safeguard our
economy, our country and the future of
our planet,” it said. “This plan will create good jobs that pay well and can’t be
outsourced. With these policies, we will
protect our country from the national
security threats created by reliance on
foreign oil and global insecurity due to
climate change. And this is how we’ll
solve the problem of $4/gal [gasoline]:
with a comprehensive plan and investment in clean energy,” the plank said.
Officials said the platform was the
product of 1,645 meetings attended by
30,000 people in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the
US Virgin Islands from July 15 through
Aug. 8. Overseas meetings of Democrats
were held in Shanghai, Dublin, Bangkok, and elsewhere, they added.
While the platform’s energy proposals included many ideas which Sen.
Barack Obama (D-Ill.), the Democrats’
2008 presidential nominee, made part
of his campaign, it did not contain a
windfall profits tax on major oil companies. It also did not include calls to
open more of the US Outer Continental Shelf to oil and gas leasing, which
several groups in the Senate and House
proposed as the August congressional
recess began. A proposed energy rebate
was part of another plank aimed at
stimulating the economy and providing
consumers immediate relief.
Congressional Republicans immediately dismissed the platform’s
energy plank as a restatement of earlier
Democratic proposals. House Minority Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio) said
on Aug. 26 that energy independence
was “a signature campaign promise”
of Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and
other House Democrats in 2006, “yet
their chronic negligence in addressing record [gasoline] prices continues
to have devastating consequences for
working families, small businesses,
seniors, and schools.”

“Here we are, exactly 600 days from

NPRA asks House to resist contradictory energy policy
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Opening limited areas of the Outer
Continental Shelf while enacting socalled “Use it or lose it” legislation
and other counterproductive measures
would be a mistake, said National Petrochemical & Reﬁning Association Pres.
Charles T. Drevna on Aug. 22.
“NPRA applauds Congress for
initiating a serious dialogue about
expanding domestic energy production. Unfortunately, recent statements
indicate Congress may soon consider
legislation that would only open limited portions of the [OCS] for domestic
production and tie that policy to measures which could ultimately counteract the very supply increases our
nation is hoping to achieve,” he said
in a letter to US House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Minority Leader
John Boehner (R-Ohio).
“Such contradictory policies have the

likely potential to threaten American energy supplies and security,” he observed.
In addition to the “Use it or lose it”
proposal, which many congressional
Democrats say will pressure oil and
gas producers to move faster on leases
they already hold, Drevna criticized calls
to release crude oil from the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve to bring prices down,
to make oil and gas companies ineligible
for the federal tax code Section 199
manufacturing deduction, and to change
existing Gulf of Mexico lease contracts.
“Unilaterally changing existing
contracts would establish a dangerous
precedent regarding conﬁdence in the
government to honor its contractual
obligations. This could open the door
for foreign state-owned companies
to gain a foothold on US OCS energy
production and cost American jobs,” he
warned.
He urged the House’s Democratic and
Republican leaders to fully consider the

adverse impacts of such proposals as
legislation develops. “Congress should
not only open the entire OCS to energy
exploration and production with no
strings attached, but should also look to
open portions of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge legally singled out for future
oil and gas exploration,” Drevna said.
“The question of domestic energy
production is particularly important considering the fact that nationally-owned
foreign oil companies control over 80%
of global oil production, with public
investor-owned companies in control of
only about 13%,” he continued.
Drevna’s letter followed one that
American Petroleum Institute Pres. Red
Cavaney wrote US senators on Aug. 13
criticizing a proposal by a bipartisan
group of 10 senators to open more of
the OCS while imposing at least $30
billion in new taxes on oil and gas producers. Cavaney has said the so-called
“Gang of 10’s” plan was “light on new
production and heavy on new taxes.”

the group would work to expand the
consensus of senators “from 16 to 60”
in the coming weeks.
Senate Majority Leader Harry M.
Reid (D-Nev.) also agreed to the
original group’s request for a day-long
energy forum and asked Energy and
Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) to direct
it.

Meanwhile, in the House, Speaker
Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has not responded to either the working group’s
proposal, which now has 70 cosponsors, or to one by six other House
members. Both call for leasing more of
the OCS (see story, this page). Several House Republicans have stayed in
Washington for nearly 3 weeks speaking from a shutdown House floor

criticizing Pelosi for not bringing the
OCS question to a vote before the recess
began.
Two oil industry groups, the American Petroleum Institute and the National Petrochemical & Refiners Association,

The other routes include the
150,000-b/d Western Route Export
Pipeline (WREP), the South Caucasus Pipeline for natural gas, and the
50,000-70,000-bd rail link extending
from Azerbaijan to Georgia’s export
terminals on the Black Sea.
BP recently announced the reopening of the SCP, but later said the WREP
remains closed with no indication of
when it might reopen.

BP PLC has reopened the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline through
conflict-stricken Georgia, and normal
operations are under way.
The 1-million b/d pipeline, owned by
a BP-led consortium of international oil
companies, had been closed since Aug. 5

Officials said the train was in the village of Skra, 5 km west of Gori, on the

for oil exports from Azerbaijan to European markets.
Russian troops left Gori on Aug. 22,

occurred near an abandoned Georgian

mined the base before they left it.

“I am sure the Russians have left other

“They want to disrupt our life and our

Let’s not forget
Khodorkovsky

Deliveries to Iran
Reports varied regarding the extent
of the damage, but the main result is
a decision by the State Oil Co. of the
Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) to begin
exporting Azeri Light crude to Iran in a
swap arrangement.
Under the agreement, SOCAR can
sell up to 300,000 tonnes via the
Persian Gulf over 2 months, shipping
oil from the offshore Azeri-ChiragGuneshli fields across the Caspian Sea to
the Iranian port of Neka.
The start of SOCAR deliveries coincided with a halt in supplies of Azeri
crude oil via the BTC line as well as the
shutdown of the WREP, and the rail line.
SOCAR also increased exports of oil
products to Iran above current contract
levels because of the rail outage in Georgia,
the company said. Georgian ports are SOCAR’s outlet for products sales to Europe.
A SOCAR spokesperson said deliveries
of Azeri crude to Iran would vary, depending on the availability of the BTC line.

Relief supplies from US
News of SOCAR’s use of Iranian
outlets coincided with reports that a US
naval destroyer delivered relief supplies
Aug. 24 at Georgia’s Black Sea port of
Batumi, the first of three such American
vessels due to arrive in the coming days.
The US ships have avoided Georgia’s
Black Sea port of Poti—60 km north
of Batumi—as the Russian army is still
occupying it. Even as the ships approached, a Russian general warned of
increased tension due to their presence.
“The situation in the Black Sea is
tending to become more tense,” said
Col. Gen. Anatoly Nogovitsyn, deputy
head of the Russian general staff.
“NATO countries are building up
their naval presence to deliver humanitarian aid.... I do not think that this will
contribute to the stabilization of the situation in the region,” Nogovitsyn said. ✦

T

he fate of Russian oilman Mikhail
Khodorkovsky has been written
about before in this space and he has
not been forgotten, especially in the
heat of recent reports of Russia’s attack on Georgia.
Indeed, we have long sensed that
his treatment at the hands of the regime of then-President Vladimir Putin,
now Russia’s prime minister, was a
bad sign for the oil and gas industry—
whether Russian or international.
Events have borne out our foreboding: Khodorkovsky’s arrest, trial,
and incarceration in a Siberian prison
represented some of the earliest indications of how the Kremlin viewed,
and would mistreat, others in the oil
and gas industry.
Look how things have fared: China

Of course, there’s still more to be
expected from the Kremlin, especially
in the Caspian region. What’s next?
Well, consider giant Kashagan oil field

which holds 10 billion bbl of reserves.

Plans call for Kashagan oil to be
transported to international markets
via the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC)
pipeline. While ships initially will be
used to transport the Kazakh oil to
Baku, plans eventually call for a new
pipeline under the Caspian.
Will the new monopolist Russian

Exploration has led to the discovery of several giant oil and gas fields,
including Urengoi gas field, with more
than 3,500 tcf of estimated ultimate recovery, and Samotlor oil field, with EUR
of more than 28 billion bbl of oil, the
report said. Urengoi field lies at 66° 40’

a subsalt prospect and is expected to
reach total depth in September.
Participating interests in the Cabinda

high-resolution aeromagnetic survey in
March 2006 over the whole block. Its
first well, Massambala-1, discovered a
shallow heavy oil accumulation on the
western side, and the group plans to
drill as many as six shallow appraisal

The second and third wells, Cevada-1
and Soja-1, had good hydrocarbon
shows but neither was judged commercial.

In August, Lehman Bros. analyst
James C. West said leading-edge rates for
land rigs are $18,000-23,500/day in
the US, up from $15,000-21,000/day
earlier this year, and $14,000-20,000/
day in second-half 2007. He expects
contractors’ profit margins to increase
in this strong drilling market.
The new rush toward drilling new,
deep shale gas plays will require higherspec land rigs: 1,500-hp and higher.
Table 1 shows the 12 drilling contractors that control most of the higherspec rigs in the US land drilling fleet. As
of June 2008, this includes 374 rigs of
1,500-2,000 hp and 105 rigs of 2,000
hp or more.
The top five US drillers control land
fleets with 1,118 rigs, and have a combined market capitalization of nearly
$27 billion (Table 2).
In 2007, many industry analysts
speculated that building land rigs on
spec might be result in a glut and depress day rates, particularly in light of
the downturn in Canadian drilling. But
Richard Mason, publisher of The Land
Rig Newsletter, noted in June, “$12 gas
changes things…There is no doubt that
existing manufacturing can produce
another 50 higher spec rigs.”
In July, LeTourneau Technologies Inc.
(LTI), a subsidiary of Rowan Cos. Inc.,
announced two new contracts to build
land drilling rigs:

US land drilling fleet (120 units). An
increasing number of the company’s
rigs are operating under term contracts,
66 in August, up from 54 in May, according to West. Another 40 rigs are

Why Produce
Diesel from the
Vacuum Unit?
Look ahead five years. The economy is likely to keep tightening
and the rush to control pollution
will inevitably be accompanied
by demands for greater energy
conservation. Consequence? A
growing market for diesel which
yields more energy per unit
volume. Yet many continue to
believe that producing diesel
from the vacuum unit is poor
design—that it should be produced only from the atmospheric
column. Hence many refiners

PROCESS

CONSULTING
SERVICES,INC.

Also: eliminating diesel from
vacuum unit feed cuts vacuum
gas oil (VGO) yield because
it is more difficult to vaporize
the feed in the vacuum column
flash zone. If atmospheric diesel
recovery is very high, VGO yield
is low. As crudes get heavier
it is essential to leave some
diesel in the vacuum column
feed to achieve reasonable VGO
cutpoints.
Lastly, if you process Canadian
oils sands Dilbit and Synbit, you
can’t run the atmospheric heater
hotter than 680°F resulting in very
high diesel boiling range material
in the vacuum feed. To obtain reasonable diesel recovery from the
whole crude you must produce it
in the vacuum unit.

feed 20-30% diesel boiling range
material to their FCCs or hydrocrackers. But where most motor
fuel is diesel, refiners have long
known that producing vacuum
unit diesel can increase production up to 5 volume percent on
whole crude.
Maximum diesel production is
simply not possible in the
atmospheric column because
flash zone temperature would
need to be 760°F or higher.
Moreover, the inherent reflux
rate below the diesel draw results
in molar L/V ratio less than 0.15.
But in vacuum columns it can be
0.4 or higher. And distillation is
driven by L/V!

Offshore construction

Offshore drilling
High oil and natural gas
prices keep the offshore
drillers busy worldwide, and
many continue to augment
the fleets. Nine of the largest,
US-based offshore drilling
contractors have 33 rigs under
construction, a combined fleet
of 542 rigs, and a combined
market capitalization of more
than $110 billion (Table 2).
42

As of early August, a total
of 177 offshore drilling rigs
were under construction
worldwide, including 39
drillships, 53 semisubmersibles, 7 drilling tenders, 77
jack ups, and 3 inland barges
(Table 3).
National Oilwell Varco
reported a growing backlog
for land and offshore rig
equipment in its secondquarter 2008 results. The
company’s total backlog
for rig equipment grew to
$10.8 billion ($9.4 billion
for offshore and $1.4 billion
for land) from $9.9 billion
in the previous quarter. NOV
expects to deliver about $3
billion of the current backlog in remainder of 2008,
$5 billion in 2009, and $3
billion in 2010 and beyond.
In August, Lehman Bros.’
West noted that the Gulf of
Mexico jack up market had
“improved significantly over
the past quarter” and expects
leading-edge day rates to
move higher. West said jack
ups may continue to leave
the gulf due to higher contract rates elsewhere. Pemex
may tender for 4-6 independent-leg cantilever (IC) jack
ups, he said, releasing several
mat-supported rigs, shifting
its focus to IC jack ups.

The Sevan Driller is under construction at COSCO’s shipyard, Nantong,
China, shown here in November 2007 (a), Feb. 2008 (b), and Apr. 2008
(c).The rig will be able to drill wells to 40,000 ft in water depths of up
to 12,500 ft, and offers a variable deckload of more than 15,000 tonnes.
The Sevan Driller will work in the US Gulf of Mexico for Petrobras America

This article reports on
development of a shortcut method that minimizes the calculation
steps for obtaining the
inhibitor concentration
Gas Processing
and injection rate required to depress hydrate
formation to a desired temperature.
Several thermodynamics models
are also available that yield inhibitor
concentration and injection rate, but
their calculations may require rigorous
computer solutions.
This article presents four diagrams to
predict the required weight percent of
monoethylene glycol (MEG) in the rich
solution and the flow rate for the desired depression of the hydrate formation temperature (HFT) for natural gas
streams. These diagrams are generated
for a natural gas with relative density of
0.6 at pressures of 3, 5, 7, and 9 MPa
and are applicable to wet gas temperatures of 20°, 30°, 40°, and 50° C.
In order to extend the applications of
these charts to wider ranges of natural gas mixtures with specific gravities
of up to 0.8, the article provides two
generalized correction factors. These
correction factors are based on rigorous
computer simulation. The accuracy of
this shortcut compares favorably with
rigorous computer simulation results
obtained from commercial process simulators; it yields excellent agreement.

and water exist at specific conditions.
This is particularly true at high pressure
and low temperature.
Fundamentally, there are four ways
to prevent hydrates from forming:
1. Reducing the pressure below
the hydrate-formation pressure for the
given temperature.
2. Maintaining the temperature of
the gas above the hydrate-formation
temperature for the given pressure.
3. Reducing the water vapor dewpoint of the gas below the lowest operating temperature (dehydration).
4. Injecting alcohols or glycols into
the gas stream to move the hydrateformation conditions to lower temperatures and higher pressures (inhibition).
The first and second methods may
not be practically possible for economic
or operational reasons or both. The
choice to inhibit hydrate formation,
the fourth method, or to dehydrate, the
third method, is based on economic
and operating parameters that are not
addressed here.
The method to be discussed here
specifically relates to the inhibition
method to prevent formation of hydrates in natural gas streams.
When an inhibitor is used for
hydrate depression, there are three possible phases into which the inhibitor
may distribute:
1. The aqueous phase, in which the
hydrate inhibition occurs.
2. The vapor hydrocarbon phase, in

lines to help users forecast gas-hydrate
formation conditions for most systems
containing hydrate-forming molecules
in the presence of inhibitors.
Hammerschmidt proposed the first
empirical equation to find the required
concentration of an inhibitor in an
aqueous solution for lowering the hydrate formation temperature.1 Nielsen
and Bucklin proposed an improved
equation of Hammerschmidt’s equation
applicable only for methanol solutions,
for concentrations up to 0.8 mole fraction methanol in the aqueous phase and
temperatures down to 165 K.2
To improve the prediction over
a larger range, Carroll proposed a
modified version of the Nielsen-Bucklin
equation to take into account inhibitor
concentration by including the water
activity coefficient.3 Moshfeghian and
Maddox proposed a correlation to
predict the concentration of inhibitors
at high pressure and high concentration
of inhibitor.4 This correlation includes
the water-activity coefficient and enthalpy of hydrate formation per hydrate
number.
Portability and simplicity are advantages of these correlations because they
can be solved with a simple calculator.
It should be noted that process simulation packages such as HYSYS or gas
processing software like GCAP and
EzThermo are also available for predicting the effect of inhibitors on hydrate
formation.5-7
In this work, four graphs predict
MEG concentration to prevent hydrate

formation. These graphs are based on
rigorous computer simulation that used
HYSYS. Several simulations determined
the effect of MEG concentration in the
aqueous phase on the depression of
the HFT. These simulations were for gas
compositions having relative densities of 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75, and 0.8 at
pressures of 3, 5, 7, and 9 MPa, each
saturated with water at temperatures of
20°, 30°, 40°, and 50° C.

Simulations
Fig. 1 shows the process flow for
computer simulation used to develop
the correlations of hydrate inhibition
presented in this study. A feed stream
of saturated wet natural gas mixes
with a stream of MEG solution. For all
of the simulations the injected MEG
composition is 80% MEG and 20 wt %
water. The mixed stream temperature is
decreased with the HYSYS cooler operation to meet the minimum temperature
of system studied. The cooled stream
is then separated with the three-phase
separator operation.
For these simulations, the cooler’s
outlet temperature is set at –30° C.,
producing a gas stream leaving the
three-phase separator with a hydrocarbon dewpoint of –30° C. This temperature has no effect on the hydrateformation temperature calculations
but may cause a small change in the
concentration of MEG in the outlet
aqueous phase.

Five natural gases with relative density ranging from 0.6 up to 0.8 in increments of 0.05 were used to develop the
required charts.
Obtaining a representative set of
operating conditions over which to test
the correlation the temperature and
pressure of each feed stream involved

increments and 3 to 9 MPa in 2 MPa
increments, respectively. In all of the
simulations, we varied the flow rate of
MEG solution to obtain a wide range
of MEG concentration in the aqueous
phase. Then, for each MEG solution
rate, we calculated the MEG concentration in the aqueous phase and the HFT
depression.

Base chart
We developed the base charts, using
a gas having a relative density of 0.6
with pressure and temperature variations as discussed previously. Fig. 2 plots
the simulation results of MEG concentration in aqueous phase (i.e., rich solution), depression of the HFT, and MEG
solution mass flow rate for pressures of
3, 5, 7, and 9 MPa, respectively.
These charts can determine the
required MEG concentration and flow
rate for a desired HFT depression for a
gas with a relative density 0.6 at watersaturation temperatures between 20°
and 50° C. for pressures ranging from
3 to 9 MPa. For pressures between the
curves presented, linear interpolation
can be used.

Specified conditions and the predicted correction factors W1, W2 and
accordingly the required MEG concentrations in the aqueous phase appear
in Table 2 for these gases. Application
of these corrected MEG concentrations predicts the required MEG flow
rates (Table 3a). Table 3a also shows a
comparison between the results of this
proposed shortcut method and HYSYS.
To demonstrate the accuracy of the

48

Table 3

proposed method further, we have
changed gas compositions from those
used to generate these charts. These
new gas compositions predict the
required MEG concentration and flow
rate. Tables 3b-3c show the charts results and their comparisons with results
of HYSYS.
In all of these cases, the charts give
good agreement with those predicted
by HYSYS. The analysis of the results
obtained indicates that the required
MEG weight percent in the aqueous
phase will decrease by increasing the
gas relative density. The MEG weight

percent obtained for gas with relative density 0.6 can therefore be used
for gases with higher relative density
if a more conservative estimation is
required.

in 2007 to $4.8 billion.
US oil pipeline operators’
profits, meanwhile, were nearly unchanged, despite a more than 5.6% increase in operating revenues. Much
of the extra revenue may have been
applied to growth or acquisitions,
with more than $4 billion of oil
carrier property changes reported
in 2007, a greater than 115% increase from the prior year.
Operators, however, began to

SPECIAL

Pipeline Economics

the number of formal construction
plans brought before the US Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission for new
or expanded pipeline and compression
and planned expenditure fell for the 12
months ending June 30, 2008.
Proposed mileage fell by more than
50%. Compression plans followed a
similar pattern, with just four of 18
projects calling for new or additional
compression of 20,000 hp or greater
and none calling for more than 40,000
hp.
The decreased scale of the proposed
projects reflects surging costs in both
material and labor. Estimated $/mile
pipeline costs rose nearly 22% to more
than $3.38 million/mile, while $/hp
cost estimates rose 12.4%.
Pipeline labor prices
maintained their premium to material and
miscellaneous costs as
the single most expensive
per-mile item. All three
categories saw increases,
but labor costs rose
nearly $300,000/mile.
Higher-cost labor
also affected the balance between estimated
and actual costs for both
pipeline and compressor
projects completed in the
12 months ending June
30, 2007. Actual pipeline
costs exceed projected

costs by nearly $373,000/mile, with labor costs making up nearly $215,000/
mile of this difference.
Higher-than-anticipated labor costs
also contributed almost the entire difference between estimated and actual
compressor costs, with projects completed by June 30, 2008, running $40/
hp more expensive than had been
predicted, and actual costs for both material and miscellaneous expenses lower
than estimated costs.
The difference between estimated
and actual costs was even sharper for
offshore projects, with actual costs
running more than $4.2 million/mile
higher than estimates. Companies active in the US Gulf of Mexico attributed the difference to delays and damage
caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita
in 2005.

US pipeline data
At the end of this article, two large
tables (beginning on p. 65) offer a variety of data for US oil and gas pipeline
companies: revenue, income, volumes
transported, miles operated, and investments in physical plants. These data are
gathered from annual reports filed with
FERC by regulated oil and natural gas
pipeline companies for the previous
calendar year.
Data is also gathered from periodic
filings with FERC by those regulated
natural gas pipeline companies seeking
FERC approval to expand capacity. OGJ
keeps a record of these filings for each
12-month period ending June 30.
Combined, these data enable an
analysis of the US regulated interstate
pipeline system.
• Annual reports. Companies that, in
FERC’s determination , are involved
in the interstate movement of oil or
natural gas for a fee are jurisdictional to
FERC, must apply to FERC for approval
of transportation rates, and therefore
must file a FERC annual report: Form 2
or 2A, respectively, for major or nonmajor natural gas pipelines; Form 6 for oil
(crude or product) pipelines.
The distinction between “major”
and “nonmajor” appears as a note at

(p. 68).
The deadline to file these reports
each year is Apr. 1. For a variety of
reasons, many companies miss that
deadline and apply for extensions, but
eventually file an annual report. That
deadline and the numerous delayed
filings explain why publication of this
OGJ report on pipeline economics oc-

curs in the third quarter of each year.
Earlier publication would exclude many
companies’ information.
• Periodic reports. When a FERC-regulated natural gas pipeline company
wants to modify its system, it must
apply for a “certificate of public convenience and necessity.” This filing must
explain in detail the planned construction, justify it, and––except in certain
instances—specify what the company
estimates construction will cost.

OGJ’s exclusive, annual Pipeline Economics Report began tracking volumes
of gas transported for a fee by major
interstate pipelines for 1987 (OGJ, Nov.
28, 1988, p. 33) as pipelines moved
gradually after 1984 from owning the
gas they moved to mostly providing
transportation services.
Volumes of natural gas sold by pipelines have been steadily declining, so
that, beginning with 2001 data in the
2002 report, the table only lists volumes transported for others.
The company tables also reflect asset consolidation and merger activity
among companies in their efforts to
improve transportation efficiencies and
bottom lines.

Construction, other cost increases hit home
Expanded drilling of various natural
gas supply basins, particularly new
large shale plays, and construction of
new LNG import facilities has helped
create a historic pipeline infrastructure
buildup in North America. One result,
however, has been a sharp increase in
labor and materials costs.
Wilson’s “Market Conditions Update
2008” reported 2008 price increases
announced as of July 1 for electric resistance weld line pipe totaling $1,025/
ton and $1,325/ton from Tenaris and US
Steel respectively. Further upstream in
the steel process, steel scrap now costs
more than what hot roll coil did as
recently as late 2004.

Effect on plans
This cost run-up has begun to affect
expansion plans for US oil and gas
pipeline systems, with the number of
applications for new construction sliding (p. 64) and cost overruns directly attributable to higher labor and material
costs seen in a number of completed
projects. Examples of these overruns
and comments from some large system
operators regarding approaches for addressing these moving forward follow.
Rendezvous Pipeline Co. LLC saw
line pipe costs for its 21 mile, 20-in. OD
project in Wyoming rise by nearly 41%.
The company attributed this discrepancy directly to the number of projects
being constructed at the same time,
which forced it to pay premium prices
to obtain the pipe it needed. What
Rendezvous described as severe labor
shortages also saw it pay premium
prices for workers, with actual costs
exceeding estimates by nearly 69%.
Other companies, such as Midwestern Gas Transmission Co., were forced
to retain manpower and equipment on
a stand-by basis—even prior to ﬁnal
construction authorization—to avoid
losing the contractor or its personnel to other projects. This approach,
combined with the already tight marker

54

for labor and materials, saw Midwestern’s material costs for a 16 in. OD,
31-mile line in Tennessee jump more
than 29%, while labor costs more than
quadrupled.
Columbia Gas Transmission Corp.
estimated the cost of 20-in. OD steel
pipe at $25.38/ft for a project it completed in 2007, but actually paid $38.13/
ft.
Availability of equipment and labor
has also been limited in the offshore
segment, particularly in the wake of
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Tennessee
Gas Pipeline Co. invited several contractors to bid on work in March 2006,
but a shortage of labor, boats, and
other equipment forced the company
to negotiate a day-rate priced construction schedule with the only bidder able
to do the work. The contractor subsequently had difﬁculty ﬁnding qualiﬁed
welders, forcing additional delays and
expenses. Construction costs on the
project were almost four times higher
than estimated.

What’s being said
Looking at these factors, Brian
O’Higgins, who manages expansion
projects in the Northeast US (where
cost changes often have their greatest effect) for Williams, commented
that beyond the industry-standard 5%
contingency included in cost estimates,
Williams now includes cost escalations
for forward years on a line-item basis
for items such as engineering, land,
materials, and construction, which
it updates quarterly. O’Higgins also
said Williams is spending more time
in a project’s planning stages getting
engineers and contractors in the ﬁeld
to help develop cost estimates on a
segment-by-segment basis.
The net effect to Williams for
projects already underway has been a
lower internal rate of return.
ONEOK Inc., meanwhile, has at-

tempted to lock in material costs when
possible by actions such as extending
pipe orders with mills already producing pipe for the company. ONEOK says
that, though construction costs have
increased, volume growth prospects
have so far kept pace, resulting in
continued favorable economics for its
projects.
Enbridge, meanwhile, has acquired
enough of its material in advance that
it has successfully moved material
from one project to another when delays are encountered. Denise Hamsher,
Enbridge’s director of federal, regulatory, and public affairs for the company’s major US projects, also says that,
though North American steel suppliers
have so far been very competitive,
the company would be looking further
aﬁeld for new requirements moving
forward.
Hamsher remarked that labor costs
have been particularly hard felt on
mainline construction projects, but that
Enbridge had so far managed to keep
its costs in line by coordinating with its
contractors.
Jack Crawford, president and CEO
of Altex Energy, which plans to build
a crude oil line from Alberta to the US
Gulf Coast, noted the importance of
keeping the overall economic picture
in mind when looking at the effects of
costs, stating that all of Altex’ competitors were being affected in the same
way.
Labor concerns haven’t affected
Altex’s plans yet, the pipeline currently
being set for completion in 2012-14,
and Crawford believes that job losses
suffered in other skilled areas (the
automotive industry for example) could
create a new potential labor pool for
the pipeline industry. Crawford also
noted that high prices for steel and
labor could eventually lead to demand
erosion, reducing costs, and that the
high cost of transportation could well
make continental options for line pipe
more appealing than overseas alternatives.

change from year-to-year, with some
companies becoming jurisdictional,
others nonjurisdictional, and still others
merging or being consolidated out of
existence.
Such changes require that care be
taken in comparing annual US petroleum and natural gas pipeline statistics.
Institution by FERC of the two-tiered
(2 and 2A) classification system for
natural gas pipeline companies after
1984 further complicated comparisons
(OGJ, Nov. 25, 1985, p. 55).
Only major gas pipelines are required to file miles operated in a given
year. The other companies may indicate
miles operated, but are not specifically
required to do so.
For several years after 1984, many
nonmajors did not describe their
systems. But filing descriptions of their
systems has become standard, and most
provide miles operated.
Reports for 2007 show an increase

in FERC-defined major gas pipeline
companies: 77 companies of 121 filing
for 2007, up from 73 of 118 for 2006.
FERC made an additional change to
reporting requirements for 1995 for
both crude oil and petroleum products
pipelines.
Exempt from requirements to prepare and file a Form 6 were those pipelines with operating revenues at or less
than $350,000 for each the 3 preceding
calendar years.
These companies must now file only
an “Annual Cost of Service Based Analysis Schedule,” which provides only total
annual cost of service, actual operating
revenues, and total throughput in both
deliveries and barrel-miles.
In 1996 major natural gas pipeline
companies were no longer required to
report miles of gathering and storage
systems separately from transmission.
Thus, total miles operated for gas pipelines consist almost entirely of transmission mileage.

FERC-regulated major natural pipeline mileage increased in 2007, reaching its highest level since 1995 (Table
1). Final data show an increase of more
than 3,000 miles, or nearly 1.7%.

Rankings, activity
Natural gas pipeline companies in
2007 saw operating revenues increase
by more than $4.6 billion or nearly
27% from 2006, outstripping the gains
seen in net income and leading to the
lowest earnings as a percent of revenue
(21.93%) since 2003.
Oil pipelines saw much the same dynamic at work, with earnings nearly flat
despite the 5.63% increase in revenues.
Liquids deliveries for 2007 via pipeline rose more than 1.2 billion bbl or
9.4%, led by a more than 13% rise in
products deliveries. Throughput measured in million bbl-miles (bbl-mile:
1 bbl moving 1 mile), however, fell
roughly 2%, by nearly 77 billion bblmiles, with a crude throughput drop

For all natural gas pipeline companies, for example, net income as a portion of operating revenues fell in 2007
to 21.93%, continuing the downward
trend started in 2006. Income as a
portion of operating revenues stood at
23.59% in 2005.
The percentage of income in operating revenues for oil pipelines retreated
in 2007 after rebounding strongly in
2006, falling to 41.76% from nearly
44%.
Net income as a portion of gas-plant
investment countered the slight decline
seen in income as a portion of revenue
for natural gas pipelines, moving to
4.99% after having slipped 4.55% in
2006 and eclipsing the 4.7% level last
seen in 1998.
For oil pipelines, net income as a
portion of investment in carrier property in 2007 eased slightly, falling to
11.45% after having risen to 11.5%

in 2006. Income as part of investment
in carrier property in 2004 stood at
11.4%, having risen steadily toward that
level from 6.8% in 1998.
Major and nonmajor natural gas
pipelines in 2007 reported an industry
gas-plant investment of more than $95.5
billion, the highest level ever, up from
nearly $88.3 billion in 2006, $84 billion
in 2005, more than $83 billion in 2004,
nearly $78 billion in 2003, $74.2 billion
in 2002, almost $71 billion in 2001,
$68 billion in 2000, and nearly $66 billion in 1999.
Investment in oil pipeline carrier
property also continued to rise in 2007,
reaching almost $35.9 billion after
rebounding to $32.7 billion in 2006
from the lowest level seen since at least
1997, 2005’s $29.5 billion.
OGJ for several years has tracked
carrier-property investment by five
crude oil pipeline and five products
pipeline companies chosen as representative in terms of physical systems and
expenditures (Table 3). In 2003, we
added the base carrier-property invest58

ment to allow for comparisons among
the anonymous companies.
The five crude oil pipeline companies in 2007 increased their overall
investment in carrier property by more
than $40.2 million, or nearly 1.3%; the
same grouping of companies increased
overall investment in carrier property in
2006 by more than $38.4 million, or
1.2%. The increases of the group overall
have come despite one of the five having lowered its investment in carrier
property for the past 3 years.
The five products pipeline companies increased overall investment
in carrier property in 2007 by $463
million, or 8.35%, following a more
modest 2006 increase of $182 million,
or 3.39%. These increases came despite
a roughly $140 million reduction in
investment by one of the five.
Comparisons of data in Table 2
with previous years must be done
with caution: in 2004, a major crude
oil pipeline company listed their sold
significant assets, making comparisons
with previous years’ data difficult.

Investment by the five product
pipeline companies in 2007 was more
than $6 million, continuing a return to
growth started in 2003 when investment of more than $4.7 billion was up
from 2002’s $4.5 billion level.
Fig. 2 illustrates the investment split
in the crude oil and products pipeline
companies.

Construction wavers
Applications to FERC by regulated
interstate natural gas pipeline companies to modify certain systems must,
except in certain instances, provide
estimated costs of these modifications

Tracking the mileage and compression horsepower applied for, and the
estimated costs can indicate levels of
construction activity over 2-4 years.
OGJ has been doing that since this report began more than 50 years ago.
Tables 4 and 5 show companies’ estimates during the period July 1, 2007,
to June 30, 2008, for what it will cost

Special Report

additional compression.
These tables cover a variety of locations, pipeline sizes, and compressorhorsepower ratings.
Not all projects that are proposed are
approved. And not all projects that are
approved are eventually built.
Applications filed in the 12 months
ending June 30, 2008, fell sharply following 3 years of sustained strength:
• Roughly 900 miles of pipeline
were proposed for land construction,
and no new offshore work. The land
level is down from the nearly 2,050
miles proposed in 2007, the 1,450
miles proposed in 2006, and the 1,700
miles proposed in 2005.
• New or additional compression
proposed by the end of June 2008 measured 238,500 hp, down substantially
from the 713,000 hp reached in 2007
and 583,000 hp seen in 2006, but still
more than the 175,000 hp envisioned
by the pipelines in 2005 (Table 5).
Putting the downturn in US gas

pipeline construction in even starker
perspective, Table 4 lists 19 land-pipeline “spreads,” or mileage segments,
and no marine projects, compared with:
• 25 land and 1 marine project
(OGJ, Sept. 3, 2007, p. 51)
• 42 land and 1 marine project
(OGJ, Sept. 11, 2006, p. 46).
• 56 land and 4 marine projects
(OGJ, Sept. 12, 2005, p. 50).
• 15 land and 0 marine projects
(OGJ, Aug. 23, 2004, p. 60).
• 37 land and 3 marine projects
(OGJ, Sept. 8, 2003, p. 60).
• 83 land and 3 marine projects
(OGJ, Sept. 16, 2002, p. 52).
• 49 land and 2 marine projects
(OGJ, Sept. 3, 2001, p. 66).
• 115 land and 6 marine projects
(OGJ, Sept. 4, 2000, p. 68).
Further, of the 19 projects applied
for, only 8 are for pipelines of 50 miles
or more in length, with just three of
these being for projects over 100 miles
long (and 2 of the 8 of 42-in. OD).

For the 12 months ending June 30,
2008, the 19 land projects would cost
just more than $3 billion as compared
with the $5.6 billion planned for 25
projects a year earlier. The smaller number and scale of these filings indicates
a potential pause in addressing the
infrastructural needs associated with US
natural gas demand growth.
Projects’ cost projections indicate
much about where companies believe
unit construction costs ($/mile) are
headed. It is telling that even with the
scale diminished, estimated $/mile
costs for the new projects continued to
rise.
For proposed US gas pipeline projects in 2007-08, the average land cost
was $3.381 million/mile; in 2006-07,
the average land cost was $2.775 million/mile; for 2005-06, the average
land cost was $1.95 million/mile; for
2004-05 the average land cost was $2.2
million/mile; and for 2003-04 the average land cost was $1.7 million/mile.

Cost components
Variations over time in the four major categories of pipeline construction
costs—material, labor, miscellaneous,
and right-of-way (ROW)—can also
suggest trends within each group.
Materials can include line pipe,
pipe coating, and cathodic protection.
“Miscellaneous” costs generally
cover surveying, engineering, supervision, contingencies, telecommunications equipment, freight,
taxes, allowances for funds used
during construction (AFUDC),
administration and overheads, and
regulatory filing fees.
ROW costs include obtaining
rights-of-way and allowing for
damages.
For the 19 land spreads filed for in
2007-08, costs-per-mile projections for
the four categories all showed increases,
with miscellaneous charges showing a
particularly sharp jump:
• Material—$1,045,846/mile, up
from $1,011,471/mile for 2006-07.
• Labor—$1,344,389/mile, up
from $1,052,658 for 2006-07.
• Miscellaneous—$837,246/mile,
up from $595,552/mile for 2006-07.
60

• ROW and damages—$154,729/
mile, up from $115,659/mile for
2006-07.
Table 4 lists proposed pipeline in
order of increasing size (OD) and increasing lengths within each size.
SPECIAL

Pipeline Economics

The average cost-per-mile for the
projects rarely shows clear-cut trends
related to either length or geographic
area. In general, however, the cost-permile within a given diameter indicates
that the longer the pipeline, the lower
the unit (per-mile) cost for construction. And lines built nearer populated
areas tend to have higher unit costs.
Additionally, road, highway, river, or
channel crossings and marshy or rocky

terrain each strongly affects pipeline
construction costs.
Fig. 3, derived from Table 4, shows
the major cost-component splits for
pipeline construction costs.
Despite increases in other categories,
labor remained the single largest portion of land construction
costs. Labor’s portion of estimated
costs for land pipelines moved to
39.76% in 2008, from 37.93%
in 2007 and 32.35% in 2006.
Material costs for land pipelines
continued to rise in absolute
terms even while slipping as a
percentage of total costs in 2008
to 30.93% from 36.44% in 2007
and 38.17% in 2006.
Fig. 4 shows a 10-year comparison of land-construction unit costs
for the two major components: material
and labor.
Fig. 5 shows the cost split for land
compressor stations based on data in
Table 5.
Table 6 lists 10 years of unit landconstruction costs for natural gas
pipelines with diameters of 8-36 in. The
table’s data consist of estimated costs
filed under CP dockets with FERC, the
same data shown in Tables 4 and 5.

Estimates; based on FERC and construction-permit applications for a 12-month period ending June 30 of each year. 2Only one project proposed during this period for this diameter. 3Involves river, stream,
or channel crossing.

Table 6 shows that the average cost
per mile for any given diameter may
fluctuate year to year as projects’ costs

are affected by geographic location,
terrain, population density, or other
factors.

Completed projects’ costs
In most instances, a natural gas pipeline company must file with FERC what

Actual cost data must be filed within 6 months following commissioning of installed compression equipment. Not all projects proposed (estimated costs) are built (actual costs). 2Generally includes surveys, engr., supervision, interest, administration and overheads, contingencies, allowances for funds used during construction (afudc), and FERC fees. 3Addition.
Source: US FERC; for completed-project costs filed between July 1, 2007, and June 30, 2008, under CFR Section 157.20(c)(4)

actual costs on cost-per-mile bases for
project totals.
Tables 7 and 8 show such actual costs
for pipeline and compressor projects
reported to FERC during the 12 months
ending June 30, 2008. Fig. 7, for the
same period, depicts how total actual
costs ($/mile) for each category compare with estimated costs.
Per-mile pipeline construction costs
for completed projects rose by nearly
51%, after jumping more than 86% a
year earlier. After leading the price surge
last year, labor posted the smallest permile increase of the cost categories for
completed projects in the 12 months
ending June 30, 2008.
Even so, actual costs were 18.6%
higher than projected costs for the 12
64

months ending June 30, 2008, with the
price of labor running 40.4% higher
than had been anticipated. Some of
these projects may have been proposed
and even approved much earlier than
the 1-year survey period. Other may
have been filed for, approved, and built
during the survey period.
If a project was reported in construction spreads in its initial filing, that’s
how projects are broken out in Table 4.
Completed projects’ cost data, however,
are usually reported to FERC for an entire filing, usually but not always separating pipeline from compressor-station
(or metering site) costs and lumping
several diameters together.
The 12 months ending June 30
saw more than 196,000 hp of new or

additional compression completed,
reversing recent declines that saw
more than 96,000 hp completed in
2007, 106,000 hp completed in 2006,
and 153,000 hp of new or additional
compression completed in 2005 vs.
468,000 hp in 2004.
More than half of the 2007-08
horsepower came from three projects.
Actual compression costs ran within
$40/hp of estimates, with declines in
material costs and miscellaneous expenses countering higher than expected
prices of labor (Table 8). ✦

*Major natural gas pipeline companies as defined below (and in FERC Accounting and Reporting Requirements for Natural Gas Companies, para. 20-011, effective Feb. 2, 1985, beginning with 1984 reporting year). Beginning with 1996, major companies were
required to file mileage for transmission systems only.
Source: FERC Forms 2 and 2A for major and nonmajor natural gas pipeline companies. Under criteria established for the 1984 reporting year (OGJ, Nov. 25, 1985, p. 80), major pipeline companies are those whose combined gas sold for resale and gas transported for a fee exceeded 50 bcf at 14.73 psi (60º F.) in each of the 3 previous calendar years. Nonmajors are natural gas pipeline companies not classified as majors and whose total gas sales of volume transactions exceeded 200 MMcf at 14.73 psi (60° F.) in
each of the 3 previous calendar years

Updated cost management program available
An updated cost management solution—version 2.1 of Kildrummy CostManager—is on the market.
The software is suited for use by companies and government agencies to control
expenditure on megaprojects and project
programs.
The firm says its program adds value
by enabling managers to base their cost
forecasts on compelling evidence. Forecasting final cost early, quickly, and accurately
requires speedy access to well-organized
information, the company points out.
Version 2.1 is designed to harness
subtle aspects of technological change to
better deliver information. The firm notes
that users find it more useful to display
and manipulate complex reports rather
than simply print them out.

Curtiss-Wright Corp.,
Roseland, NJ, has secured a contract
from Global Supplies, Dubai, for 10 top
and bottom DeltaGuard automated coke
drum unheading systems for installation at
the 21,000 b/d Essar Oil Vadinar refinery
at Gujarat, India, by October 2009. The
DeltaGuard device safely opens the top or
bottom of a coke drum during the delayed
coking process, which generates extreme
temperature and pressure conditions. Unlike other unheading systems, the remotely
operated DeltaGuard system creates a
totally enclosed coking system, eliminating safety risks to personnel during the
unheading process. With the Essar installation, the total number of installed DeltaGuard systems will rise to 254, representing nearly 34% of the worldwide market.

Acteon companies
Claxton Engineering, 2H Offshore,
and Subsea Riser Products have received
an order from Venture Production PLC to
provide an ultrahigh-pressure riser for use
during a high-pressure, high-temperature
(HPHT) drilling campaign in the North
Sea, which is scheduled for fourth quarter
2009. The riser will be the world’s first
full-bore access (183⁄4-in.) riser capable of
working at pressures in excess of 12,000
psi. Linked to this, the flanges used to
connect the individual pipe sections will
be attached using a shrink-fit process—the
first time this technology has been used
in this application. The riser will enable Venture to drill and complete HPHT
subsea wells from a jack up employing a
surface blowout preventer (BOP), which
will provide significant cost benefits
and operational efficiencies. Venture has
already contracted Noble Drilling’s Scott
Marks jack up, which is currently under construction in China, for the HPHT
campaign. As well as acting as the lead
contractor, equipment integrator, and offshore service supplier, Claxton will provide
a range of ancillary equipment, including
an umbilical, wellhead and BOP connectors, a tensioning ring, and a hydraulic
power and control system. A team from
Claxton will be responsible for running
and pulling the riser on the rig, and for its
inspection and maintenance. 2H carried
out the initial riser design and analysis
work, and SRP has led the development of
the new shrink-fit technology. SRP is ultimately responsible for supplying the riser,
which has 13 main sections plus fatiguecritical, tapered stress and tension joints.
Forging the main pipe sections has already
commenced at two plants in France and
Italy. The flanges will be forged once the
main pipes are finished, and then extensive machining will be required before the
flanges are shrink-fitted. Once the riser is

complete, a detailed testing program will
be carried out before delivery to Venture in
September 2009. Venture expects to begin
using the riser immediately thereafter to
drill HPHT development and appraisal
wells in several of its Central North Sea
assets in water depths to 120 m.
Acteon is a group of specialist engineering companies serving the global
offshore oil and gas industry. It focuses
on technology that has applications in the
vital region between the seabed and the

expected to close in September 2008.
Industrial Rubber is a leading designer,
producer, and applicator of protective coatings to pipeline and industrial markets. Since
2006, the company’s revenue has almost
doubled, driven in large part by the success
of the IRACORE Pipe Systems, which has
broad applications to the oil sands and other
industries.
Lime Rock is a private equity firm focused on the global energy industry.
Thompson is a private equity firm focused on the manufacturing, distribution,
and services industries.

Austin Ventures,

THE REMAINDER

September 30 – October 2, 2008
Hilton Fort Worth
Fort Worth, Texas USA

UNCONVENTIONAL GAS EXTRACTION BECOMING VIABLE
Production from unconventional reservoirs — tight gas sands, shales, and coalbeds--accounts for a large and growing share of total gas
supply. But the reservoirs are complex. The costs of drilling into and completing wells in them are continually rising while presenting unique
environmental problems. Producing gas from unconventional reserves proﬁtably, safely, and in amounts demanded by the market requires
increasingly sophisticated recovery methods.
Gas recovery from unconventional reserves will be explored on September 30 – October 2, 2008 at the
Unconventional Gas International Conference & Exhibition to be held at the Hilton Fort Worth, in Fort Worth,
Texas. Planned by the editors of Oil & Gas Journal and an Advisory Board of industry experts, the event will
highlight innovation from unconventional gas plays around the world.

Europe’s diesel
preference gets
lift from France
A French effort to reduce vehicular emissions of carbon dioxide might ease marketbased problems of the European program
known as dieselization.
Many countries in Europe encourage the
use of diesel in cars and trucks, with taxes
favoring the distillate fuel over gasoline.
France is one of those countries. Early
this year, the French government added
a program aimed at discouraging the

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

purchase of large cars. The purpose is to
reduce emissions of CO2.
As described in the Aug. 12 Oil Market
Report of the International Energy Agency,
the program adjusts prices of vehicles with
discounts and surcharges according to
estimated emissions of CO2 per distance
driven.
A vehicle emitting more than 160 g/km,
for example, incurs a surcharge as high as
€2,600. A car emitting less than 120 g/km
receives a discount of as much as €1,000.
The French ﬁght against carbon
amounts to an extra boost for diesel vehicles. Diesel-powered cars emit less CO2
than gasoline counterparts of equivalent
horsepower, IEA points out. They’re also
about one-third more fuel-efﬁcient.
Under the new French program, small
diesel engines enjoy steep discounts. A car
with a 90 hp diesel engine emitting 120 g/
km receives a €200 discount. A gasoline car
of the same horsepower emits 150 g/km
and gets no discount.
While diesel-powered cars use less fuel
and emit less CO2 than gasoline-fueled vehicles, they cost more to buy and maintain.
The popularity of diesel vehicles in
Europe thus has resulted mostly from the
historic price discount of diesel relative to
gasoline, IEA notes.
Until recently, the fuel-price difference
could offset the purchase-price penalty of a
diesel vehicle fairly quickly. Now, however,
elevated prices of oil and distillates have
made diesel and gasoline prices converge
in most countries—and diesel to pull ahead
in some.
The new price relationship makes diesel
vehicles less appealing than before to average motorists, IEA says. Only those who
drive great distances may see a cost beneﬁt
in diesel vehicles.
IEA adds, “This could augur a renewed
interest in gasoline engines, thus partly
reversing Europe’s dieselization trend—
unless other countries emulate France’s
policy.”

‘Cold War’ heats oil market
Crude futures soared above $120/bbl Aug. 21 on the New York market for the ﬁrst
time in 2 weeks as both the US dollar and US-Russian relations deteriorated. In the
Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc., analysts suggested “a new
Cold War” might be “heating up the oil market” apparently due to US opposition to
Russia’s incursion into nearby Georgia.
That same day at Petromatrix in Zug, Switzerland, Oliver Jakob noted “Ten days
ago, the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline was on ﬁre, bombs were falling on Georgia,
the US [crude] stocks were reported lower than expected, but the price of oil was
moving down. Today the BTC pipeline is repaired, no shots are ﬁred in Georgia, the
US stocks are reported higher than expected, but the price of oil is moving up. The
difference between then and now is of course the directional move of the Dollar
Index and assets allocation linked to it.” BP PLC, operator, said shipments of Azeri
crude would resume via the BTC pipeline by the end of August.
Moreover, Jakob said, “We do not buy the argument that explains yesterday’s
[price] move by ‘geopolitical concerns.’ Russia has taken care not to bomb the BTC
pipe in its Georgian intrusion, and it has enough leveraged arguments to use against
the West (northern access to Afghanistan, veto on ‘Iranium’) not to have to use the
oil tool.” He added, “The US envoy to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization claims
that on the eve of the Georgian assault on Ossetia, [western ofﬁcials] were again telling them not to do it as they would fall into a Russian trap. Georgia apparently did
not listen, and despite all the current face saving, not all NATO nations are extremely
happy to have been thrown in the trap and put their relations with Moscow at risk
of this uncontrolled adventure.” Meanwhile, Russia suspended military cooperation
with NATO due to the dispute over its incursion into Georgia.
OPEC output cut?
That same week, Paul Horsnell, Barclays Capital Inc., London, warned that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries “is now heading for an output cut, and
potentially a very large one” at its Sept. 9 meeting. “Only a price rally back to well
above $120/bbl is likely to be able to halt a substantial removal of OPEC crude output
from the market,” he said.
While rising in euro terms, the value of the OPEC basket in late August sank to the
lowest dollar ﬁgure since early May. “Given the speed of recent falls,” Horsnell said,
“a move below $100/bbl for the value of the OPEC basket would represent a matter
for major concern for most of the key ministers, and a move below $90/bbl would
be likely to be considered as something of a crisis. Indeed, at current price levels or
lower, we would see it as inevitable that OPEC will seek to reduce its output and its
target ceiling at the September meeting.”
The August oil market report from the OPEC Secretariat “states that the risks
to the outlook are on the downside, that non-OPEC output is about to surge, that
OPEC is already producing well above the call on its crude, that the demand outlook
is worsening, that the global economic situation is deteriorating rapidly, and that
speculators are now short,” said Horsnell. “We think the secretariat is being a little
pessimistic about demand and, most importantly, is factoring in a wave of non-OPEC
supply growth that is likely in reality to disappoint. However, that does not detract
from the view that the cautious strategy of least regret for OPEC is to cut, and possibly to cut very hard.”
Should crude futures prices stabilize around $120/bbl, Horsnell said, “then a cut
is less likely.” Should prices linger lower, he said, “then a cut in actual output is fairly
certain, and should prices fall further, then the target ceiling and actual output are
both likely to come down sharply, in our view. However, whatever the price dynamics in the coming weeks, at this point another meeting in October or at the latest

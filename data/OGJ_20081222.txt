Alberta’s royalty framework takes effect Jan. 1

Cuba, Venezuela sign new accords on oil, gas

New royalty framework rates will become effective in Alberta
on Jan. 1, 2009, for production from new natural gas wells and
conventional oil wells.
Spurred by then-high commodity prices, Alberta Premier Ed
Stelmach announced the “New Royalty Framework” in October
2007, saying it would bring an additional $1.4 billion (Can.) to
government coffers in 2010, 20% more than the current royalty
regime (OGJ, Nov. 5, 2007, p. 34).
The new royalty structure did not include oil sands, and the
Alberta government spent 2008 negotiating with Syncrude and
Suncor, large joint-venture projects that had royalty agreements in
place through 2016. Syncrude partners were the last to come to
terms, announcing their acquiescence on Nov. 18.
The unforeseen drop in natural gas and oil prices and credit
restrictions from the global economic crisis, however, have slowed
drilling activity and project development in the province.
In response, the Alberta government recently introduced optional, 5-year transitional royalty rates for new wells commenced
during Nov. 19 and Dec. 31. Operators now have the option of
choosing to pay royalties under the transitional scheme or the new
royalty framework scheme.
Alberta Energy announced the transitional royalty rates to the
media on Nov. 19, but issued a clarification on Nov. 24: “Companies with oil and gas wells between 1,000 and 3,500 m where
staging, preparatory, or initial drilling work has begun during this
period will be eligible to make the one-time choice to have the
transitional rates applied to production beginning Jan. 1, 2009.
Any wells producing oil or gas prior to Jan. 1, 2009, must transition to the new royalty framework.
“Because this clarification will only apply to a nominal number
of wells and only on production after Jan. 1, this adjustment is
not anticipated to affect the estimated royalty impact of the 5-year
program announced on Nov. 19, 2008.”
Alberta Energy stressed that the new program is not a “royalty
holiday.” Operators have a one-time option to select transitional
rates or framework rates for new wells. All wells drilled in 2009-13
that pay transitional rates will be required to shift to the new royalty framework on Jan. 1, 2014.
All other existing wells and oil sands projects will move to the
new royalty framework Jan. 1, 2009.

Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and his Cuban counterpart,
Raul Castro, have signed agreements to expand the capacity of two
refineries in Cuba and to construct a third one.
Altogether, the expansion plans will see Cuba’s refining capacity
increased to 350,000 b/d from the current 87,000 b/d, according
to a statement from Venezuela’s state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela
SA (PDVSA).
Under the agreements, the capacity of Cuba’s Cienfuegos refinery will be stepped up to 150,000 b/d from the current 65,000
b/d, while the Hermanos Diaz refinery in Santiago will rise to
50,000 b/d from 22,000 b/d.
PDVSA said the proposed refinery in the port city of Matanzas
will have a capacity of 150,000 b/d, and is to be managed by
Cuvenpetrol SA—a new joint venture of PDVSA and Cuba’s stateowned Cupet.
PDVSA did not reveal the respective stakes of the two sides in
the joint venture or a schedule for the expansion of the existing
refineries or the construction of the new one.
However, the Venezuelan firm said that Cuvenpetrol will control
all refining interests in Cuba being pursued by the two countries,
including the design and construction of an LNG regasification
plant, gas pipelines, and other facilities.
The agreements signed recently mirror earlier ones between the
two countries.
In April 2006, PDVSA entered into an agreement with Cupet
to establish a joint venture company to refurbish and expand the
Soviet-built facility at Cienfuegos that had been neglected since the
start of the 1990s, when Soviet assistance to Cuba ended.
Under the earlier Venezuelan-Cuban JV, the refinery’s capacity
was initially raised to 65,000 b/d. The upgraded Cienfuegos refinery was inaugurated in late 2007 and started operations in January.
The Cienfuegos refinery is expected to close 2008 with production of 20 million bbl of fuel, according to deputy director, Raul
Perez, who said the plan for the refinery envisaged output of 19.4
million bbl for the year.
Cuba imports 100,000 b/d from Venezuela in oil and products
under special financial conditions that include bartering for Cuban goods or services such as doctors, teachers, and athletic trainers. ✦

That’s how much U.S. oil and natural gas companies
spent in 2007 drilling and equipping new wells. But
you already knew that because you subscribe to API’s
Joint Association Survey (JAS) on Drilling Costs. After
all, it’s the only long-term source of information on
detailed U.S. drilling expenditures. So you already
figured that in to your big presentation you gave to
the Board, right?

A1-54/01 wildcat 38 miles offshore went to total depth of 11,077
ft in 2,807 ft of water in the Mediterranean Gulf of Sirte.
The Dekhila-1x well in deepwater West Mediterranean (Block
1) 45 miles offshore in Egypt’s Nile Delta went to TD 8,881 ft in
3,883 ft of water and found a gross hydrocarbon section of 148 ft
at multiple intervals. Results will be incorporated into engineering
studies for the wider West Med development.

The company has commissioned the 800-km TransSakhalin oil
and gas pipeline system, which connects the offshore Molikpaq,
Piltun-Astokhskoye-B, and Lunskoye platforms in the northeast to
the new terminal and Prigorodnoye port in Aniva Bay. Oil was exported through a tanker loading unit 4.5 km offshore in Aniva Bay
and connected to the terminal by a subsea pipeline.
The Governor Farkhutdinov giant tanker carrying 100,000
tonnes of oil left the island and set sail for South Korea’s Yosu port,
according to Russian news reports. At peak, Prigorodnoye will annually serve 160 LNG carriers and 100 Aframax oil tankers.
The milestone represents a major step in commissioning the
facilities. The operator also will start LNG processing in the next
few weeks. LNG supplies to customers in Japan will start begin in
February (OGJ Online, Nov. 28, 2008). The Piltun-Astokhskoye-B
platform also will send oil later this month.
The $20 billion Sakhalin-2 project has been unable to export
year-round as its offshore facility could work for only 6 months
of the ice-free season. “Year-round production and export of the
Sakhalin-2 oil will significantly enhance energy security in the
Asia Pacific and strengthen Russia’s position in the world markets,”
Sakhalin Energy said.
Sakhalin-2 involves oil and gas production from Piltun-Astokhskoye field, which includes Piltun and Astokh oil and gas areas, and
Lunskoye field.
SEIC has produced more than 100 million bbl of the Vityaz
crude since 1999. The company is a joint venture of OAO Gazprom

12.5%, and Mitsubishi Corp. 10%.

Fate of North Pole reﬁnery pondered
Alaska’s state government and Flint Hill Resources will begin
a joint effort to position the company’s refinery at North Pole
for long-term success, Gov. Sarah H. Palin announced on Dec.
10.
“The Flint Hills Resources Alaska refinery in North Pole has a
significantly positive economic impact throughout our state,” Palin
said. “The refining operation is a major employer in Alaska and is
vital to the operations of Anchorage International Airport, the Port
of Anchorage, and the Alaska Railroad,” she added.
The move came after Flint Hills’ announcement in May that it
was reviewing alternatives for the refinery due to financial challenges.
The plant is Alaska’s largest refinery with a 240,000 b/d processing capacity. About 60% of its products are destined for the
aviation market.
Palin said both the state and Flint Hills would evaluate options
aimed at improving the plant’s ability to respond to volatile energy
costs, varying product demands and volatile refining margins as
well as facilitating upgrades to position the installation for longterm success.
The governor said Flint Hills has agreed to provide data to the
state’s Department of Natural Resources, which has assured that it
will remain confidential. The data will let the state agency analyze
refinery economics over 3-6 months, Palin said.

Tui ﬁeld partners consider FPSO expansion
Partners in the development of Tui oil field off New Zealand,
led by Sydney-based Australian Worldwide Exploration (AWE), are
considering an expansion of the fluid handling capacity of the Umuroa floating production, storage, and offloading vessel to 180,000
b/d. The group has also deferred indefinitely the drilling of a third
horizontal well in the field in favor of further exploration within
the larger mining licence PMP 38158.
The upgrade of the FPSO will enable more oil to be recovered at
a faster rate from the currently producing reservoirs and also provide the flexibility to tie-in any future nearby discoveries.
As expected from the outset, the field is gradually increasing its
water cut and this is now limiting the maximum oil recovery rate
to about 32,000 b/d.
The field has an estimated proven and probable reserve of
around 50 million bbl. At the end of November, total production
had reached 19 million bbl.
The Tui group is now confident it can extract the remaining reserves without the extra development well. There are five attractive
prospects near the three producing reservoirs which in total could
contain another 50 million bbl of oil.
Semisubmersible Kan Tan IV will be used for the 2009 exploration program but no decision has been made about which prospects will be targeted.
The Tui partners are AWE 42.5%, Mitsui Exploration & Production NZ 35%, New Zealand Oil & Gas 12.5%, and Pan Pacific Petroleum 10%. ✦

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
The Alaska Railroad and Flint Hills also will review potential
opportunities to structure refinery ownership and operations as
part of a corporation similar to, or part of, the Alaska Railroad,
Palin indicated.
The state will consider impacts on other Alaska refineries in all
case, she emphasized.

Dominican Republic buys Shell’s reﬁnery share
The Dominican Republic has become the sole owner of the
31,000 b/d Refidomsa refinery at Haina after Shell Petroleum NV
completed transferring its 50% stake.
The government paid $110 million for the interest, which Shell
said it sold because it was no longer of strategic importance to the
company.
The parties agreed to the share purchase on Aug. 5.
The refinery, commissioned in January 1973, is the primary refinery in the Dominican Republic. Along with its import terminal,
it supplies most of the fuel requirements in the country. It has a
hydroskimming configuration, and in 1992 the refinery commissioned its own power generation plant, which improved the plant’s
reliability.
Shell said it would remain in the retail, lubricants, and commercial marketing businesses in the Dominican Republic. ✦

Equatorial Guinea to set up gas processing hub
Equatorial Guinea plans to establish a gas-gathering company
to collect gas in the Gulf of Guinea and direct it to key projects in
the nation, according to a senior official from the state owned gas
company Sonagas.
Serapio Sima Ntutumu, deputy director general at Sonagas,
said at the CWC LNG summit in Barcelona that Equatorial Guinea
wants to position itself as a gas processing hub in the region gathering gas from Nigeria, Cameroon, and other sources in Equatorial
Guinea that could be fed into its LNG expansion, petrochemicals,
LPG plants, and methanol systems.
Sonagas will perform a feasibility study to evaluate its gas options, an initiative crucial to eliminate gas flaring. It hopes to collect
at least 800 MMcfd from Nigeria and 200 MMcfd from Cameroon,
Ntutumu told OGJ.
“If they have even more, all the better. Noble Energy has discovered gas on Block O & I; ExxonMobil has gas activities. We want to
work with them.”
The new company would effectively become a hub for gas activity, coordinating work in Equatorial Guinea and offering licenses
for gas development.
Equatorial Guinea also is working on a master gas plan to find
ways of monetizing its resources. The government will announce
further details later, Ntutumu said.
The nation’s importance in the oil and gas arena was recognized
by Gazprom Neft in October after it signed memorandum of understanding with the nation’s energy ministry committing to carry
out upstream, downstream, and financial studies. The partnership
will strengthen the cooperation between Russia and Equatorial
Guinea.

postponed after the recent Mumbai massacre.
Turkmenistan, which has failed to provide the gas reserves certification required by both Pakistan and India, is expected to present
the certification when the meeting is rescheduled.

Gazprom to plan gas transport, storage in Europe
Gazprom Vice-Pres. Alexander Medvedev indicated in Paris Dec.
12 that the company is interested in acquiring gas transport and
distribution assets in France and other areas of Europe to bolster
the company’s gas storage capacities. He said Gazprom Marketing
& Trading France already has joint gas storage projects.
“We want to ensure distribution in all the countries where we
deliver our gas under long-term contracts,” he said.
Gazprom signed an agreement in December 2006 extending
Gaz de France’s long-term contracts to 2030 and, at the same time,
the partners agreed that Gazprom could sell as much as 1.5 billion
cu m/year in France as direct sales.
Medvedev said he is aiming for these volumes within 2-3 years,
up from the current 500 million cu m, which accounts for 1% of
the French market for large industries. Gazprom is now aiming for
medium-size clients.
Youri Virobian, who heads the new French affiliate, said broadening Gazprom’s market share would depend on “the future of
regulated prices,” which have kept the industrial gas market restricted to 19% for new entrants since the industrial market opened
to industry in 2004. Householders, who could access the market
since July 2007, only account for 1.9%, he noted.
Medvedev indicated that, due to the financial and economic
crises, Russian investments will be prioritized, but he did say the
Nordstream and Southstream gas pipelines and the Shtokman gas
field projects would proceed.

Pakistan plans $1 billion TAPI, IPI gas storage
Pakistan says it will require $1 billion to build underground
storage for gas to be imported from Iran and Turkmenistan, according to the country’s petroleum ministry and the Asian Development Bank in a joint study with Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Ltd.
(SNGPL) and Sui Southern Gas Co. Ltd. (SSGCL).
SNGPL, SSGCL, and Inter-State Gas Systems, which is responsible for building the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India
(TAPI) and Iran-Pakistan-India (IPI) gas pipelines, would build
three to four underground gas storage tanks.
Pakistan plans to import 2.2 bcfd of gas from Iran, of which
Pakistani share would be 1.05 bcfd. If India does not participate,
Pakistan would take the entire volumes.
From Turkmenistan, Pakistan will import 3.2 bcfd of gas, to be
shared equally with India. Pakistan would also need underground
storage for gas supplied to different areas of the country.
Pakistan and Iran currently are in a dispute over the gas price,
an obstacle to further progress on the IPI gas pipeline project. Pakistani and Iranian officials were expected to meet soon in Tehran to
resume negotiations on the price issue.
The steering committee on the TAPI gas pipeline project was
scheduled to meet in New Delhi this month, but the meeting was

Gran Tierra defers Colombian pipeline project
Gran Tierra Energy Inc., Calgary, deferred a 100-km pipeline
project in Colombia connecting Costayaco field to the Orito gathering facilities. Recent pressure-testing of the existing pipeline system and testing of friction reducers injected into the oil stream
show the existing pipeline system can move about 15,000 b/d
from Costayaco with new pumps.
Gran Tierra will move an additional 10,000 b/d by truck, allowing it to meet estimated second-half 2009 production of 25,000
b/d. The company reduced expected peak plateau production from
35,000 b/d, but extended the peak’s duration to 3 years.
The company estimates a $140 million savings for 2009 from
deferring the pipeline project. The company said a WTI price of
$61/bbl was needed to keep pipeline construction economical.
Gran Tierra, which discovered Costayaco field in 2007, holds
five exploration licenses and a working interest in two technical
evaluation areas in Putumayo basin.
Production in Costayaco field is suspended while the existing
pipeline remains shut in. Output from other Putumayo assets, the
Llanos basin, and the Lower Magdalena basin continues (OGJ Online, Dec. 4, 2008). ✦

Commodity prices, ﬁeld costs
Permian basin ‘Wolfberry’
Gulfport Energy scaled back its

The scaleback is giving the operating team time to integrate new geoscience information, including extensive
electric logging suites, a microstem

understand the reservoir and improve
completion practices.

Fayetteville shale
With gas prices on the skids, Southwestern Energy decided against its
initial plan to ramp up activity in the
Arkoma basin Fayetteville shale play in
2009 and instead hold drilling at about
the 2008 rate (see story and map, p.
32).
Harold Korell, chairman and chief
executive officer of Southwestern, sees
the seeds of a resumption in Fayetteville
growth in the decline in the US rig
count in recent months.
The $15/Mcf price of gas caused
the current oversupply, he said in
early December. Some companies paid
$10,000-20,000/acre for land, and
those in difficult financial circumstances
are overextended and are idling rigs and
cutting budgets.
Idling those rigs will help bring
supply back in line with demand, Korell
reasoned, because of an expected 65%
decline in first-year production from
the shale wells being drilled in numerous US plays.
The same thing happened in
2000-01, he said, when 400 rigs were
stacked and production fell dramatically.
“I think we’re going to see that happen again in 2009,” he said.
Southwestern’s Fayetteville play is
economic at less than present prices,

Confusion in a rocky year
A rocky year in the oil market approaches its
end with important, if confusing, developments.
On Dec. 17, the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries acted with unusual clarity to
defend the price of crude oil by cutting production. Many times in the past, the exporters’ group
has announced cuts but not specified whether the
reductions applied to quotas or actual production,
which nearly always differ. OPEC’s 500,000-b/d
September “cut,” for example, was an effort to
enforce year-old quotas then largely ignored. In
October, the group announced a 1.5-million b/d
reduction without defining the baseline.
The latest move is less ambiguous. The cut,
OPEC announced after a meeting in Oran, Algeria,
will amount to 4.2 million b/d and apply to actual
September production by the 11 members with
quotas: 29.045 million b/d. The new target thus
is 24.8 million b/d. That’s 1 million b/d below
the group quota implied by the September and
October reductions. More importantly, it’s 3.3 million b/d of crude oil below what the International
Energy Agency estimates the OPEC-11 produced
in November. If achieved and sustained into the
first half of 2009, a production cut that large can
reverse a contraseasonal build-up of crude stocks
that began in October, about which the group is
expressly and legitimately concerned.

Unintended help
OPEC may have received unintended help in its
defense of the crude price from the US Federal Reserve. The day before the producers’ group acted,
the Fed cut its target interest rate for overnight
bank lending to an historic 0-0.25%. It also said it
would buy government securities from banks to
put cash into circulation. These aggressive efforts
to stimulate the US economy will tend to weaken
the dollar, which in fact plummeted in value after
they were announced.
Early this year, unusual dollar weakness correlated with unusual oil-price strength. More recently, other forces, mostly plunging oil demand and
grim economic news, have overwhelmed whatever
relationship exists between those variables. Indeed,
oil prices dropped after the Fed announced its
interest-rate cut as traders reacted to other influ18

ences. As long as oil is traded in dollars, however,
a dollar of diminishing value can only help efforts
to shore up dollar-denominated oil prices if the
other turbulence subsides.
While potentially related OPEC and Fed
maneuvers thus coincided with unpredictable
consequences last week, the US Energy Information Administration unveiled a forecast with
more-lasting implications—at least for the country
that leads the world in oil consumption. In the
“early release” version of its 2009 Annual Energy
Outlook, EIA sees a flattening of consumption of
petroleum liquids through 2030 as use of biofuels
grows enough to satisfy modest increases in total
liquids use. As a result, net dependence on imports
shrinks from 58% of total liquids supply recently
to 41% in 2030. Last year, EIA projected import
dependency in 2030 of 54%.
Consumption of natural gas, by contrast, grows
in the EIA forecast, supported by robust gains in
domestic production. The production increase,
largely resulting from unconventional reservoirs,
squeezes the import share of total supply to 3% in
2030 from 16% at present. Last year EIA forecast 2030 gas import dependency at 14%. With
growth in total energy use slowing and the carbon
intensity of fuels diminishing, the average increase
in energy-related emissions of carbon dioxide falls
to 0.3%/year from last year’s projection of 0.7%/
year without any new policies.

What price?
So OPEC has cut production to strengthen
oil prices. If successful, the move would impede
economic recovery just as the Fed acts to stimulate recovery with a tactic that also might raise oil
prices and thus, to some extent, work against itself.
Markets have reason to be confused. Now, though,
they’re mostly obsessed with economic torpor and
swooning oil demand. EIA, meanwhile, sees structural change in the US oil and gas markets. Yet fossil fuels in its projection still represent 79% of US
energy supply in 2030, when, because of growing
global demand and limits on resource access, the
price of crude reaches $130/bbl.
Ah, yes, $130/bbl oil. It seems like only yesterday. ✦

Larger estimates for Venezuela have
increased worldwide oil and gas reserves from previous estimates, according to Oil & Gas Journal’s annual survey
of proved reserves.
Worldwide oil production declined
slightly in 2007. But preliminary estimates indicate that worldwide crude
and condensate production increased
1.1% this year, spurred by robust
demand in late
2007 and early
2008, and record
high oil prices that
peaked in July.
New estimates
of the world’s oil
reserves total 1.34
trillion bbl, up 10.5 billion bbl from
those reported a year ago (OGJ, Dec.
24, 2007, p. 22). The latest estimates of
gas reserves total 6.254 quadrillion cu
ft, up 68.67 tcf from those reported a
year ago.
The increases in total oil and gas
reserves come in large part as a result of
higher estimates for Libya and Venezuela, as reported by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries. OPEC
also reported larger gas reserves and
smaller oil reserves for Iran.

es, including government agencies and
ministries. Since most countries do not
assess their reserves annually, many of
the figures in this report are unchanged
from a year ago.

Reserves changes

Other than those mentioned above,
there were no other large changes in
reserve volumes on the country level.
Most of the adjustments recorded from
a year ago were related to production,
but some reevaluations pertained to
economics as the price of oil climbed.
The region with the largest changes
in reserves is the Western Hemisphere,
as was the case in the previous edition of this report. Led by Venezuela,
collective oil reserves in North America
and Latin America are up 3.6% and gas
reserves are 5.6% higher than reported
a year ago.
Most of the additions to Venezuela’s
reserves are the result of additions of
extra-heavy oil. The country’s reserves at
the end of 2007 stood at 99.377 billion
bbl, including 58.173 billion bbl of
extra-heavy crude, according to PDVSA.
This total is up 12.3 billion bbl from
that reported a year ago.
Libya’s new oil reserve estimates are
up 2.2 billion bbl to 43.66
billion bbl. Indonesia, which

has been facing declining
output for some time and

2009, holds 3.99 billion
bbl in oil reserves, down
Worldwide Report
9% from previous estimates,
although its gas reserves are
revised 13% higher at 106 tcf.
Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador,
and the US show larger oil
reserves, while oil and gas
reserves in Canada, Mexico,
and Colombia are lower.
Canada’s oil reserves
include 5.392 billion bbl of
conventional crude oil and
condensate, according to

Deloitte: Oil demand growth will outlast ailing economy
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
An ailing global economy will stall
oil demand growth for a while, but
industry must prepare itself to fulfill
long-term growing global oil demand,
speakers said Dec. 10 at Deloitte LLP’s
energy conference in The Woodlands,
north of Houston.
The Deutsche Bank (DB) economics team expects global gross domestic
product growth to be nearly zero in
2009 and 2.6% in 2010, said Adam
Sieminski, DB chief energy economist.
He expects the current economic downturn to be the worst in 50 years.
Consumer demand in major industrial countries will be depressed for
about 18 months, Sieminski said. Consequently, oil demand and oil prices are
expected to suffer, although he remains
optimistic about the long-term fundamentals for fossil fuels.
“By the end of next year, I think
we will be out of the worst of this,”
Sieminski said of the global economic
downturn.
DB revised its oil price forecast for
2009 to $47.50/bbl compared with an
earlier forecast of $60/bbl.
“This forecast reflects the new, lower
economic outlook and subsequent
impact on global oil demand, which
we see falling by 1% in 2009,” Siem-

inski said. “Our 2010 forecast for an
average West Texas Intermediate price
of $55/bbl is at the low end of the
consensus range. Our $80/bbl estimate
for 2011 reflects a view that oil prices
will sharply recover once the economy
regains its footing.”
He foresees support for US natural
gas prices. “The US gas rig count is
down 10% since the August peak, and
we expect it will keep on falling.”

OPEC’s inﬂuence
Sieminski expected little to come out
of the Dec. 17 meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
“OPEC isn’t ahead of the game,”
Sieminski said Dec. 10. “They are just
simply reacting. It will probably take a
couple more meetings after this one,”
before OPEC takes action that would
actually change the supply-demand
situation.
Luis Giusti, senior advisor of the
Center for Strategic and International
Studies, expects OPEC to take action to
stabilize prices. Noting that Saudi Arabia
is building new cities, Giusti said he believes Saudi Arabia would like oil prices
to be $60/bbl.
Giusti criticized OPEC’s October
meeting, calling it “sloppy” and saying
nobody believed that OPEC actually was
going to reduce production.
Regarding national oil companies

and international oil companies, Giusti
expects to see renewed partnerships
in part because IOCs need access to
reserves. He also believes that “a new
era of cooperation” between NOCs
and IOCs is needed to meet future oil
demand.
Amy Myers Jaffe of Rice University’s
James Baker Institute said NOCs are
expected to control a greater portion of
future oil production during the next
20 years but they will have difficulty
fulfilling this role.
“Many NOCs have stagnant or falling oil production due to civil unrest,
government interference, corruption,
inefficiency, and diversion of capital
to social spending,” Jaffe said. She said
Middle East oil producers, particularly
in Saudi Arabia, want to ensure longterm oil demand growth and therefore
desire a shallow, short US recession.
Saudi Arabia figures predominantly
in the international financial system,
Jaffe said, adding that it’s in the Saudis’
interest to protect their extensive asset
holdings worldwide.
The Saudis also would like to slow
down a shift to more fuel-efficient cars
because that will reduce oil demand,
particularly in the US where robust fuel
efficiency measures are expected. Development of the next generation of biofuels also could mean a further decline in
US oil demand, Jaffe said. ✦

Deloitte: US needs 50-year energy strategy
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
A national energy council should
be established in the US to develop a
50-year energy strategy, with the council developing benchmarks to monitor
progress and making regular public reports, said economist Joseph Stanislaw.
In a proposal released Dec. 10 by

Deloitte LLP at its annual energy conference, Stanislaw said the US must change
the way it uses energy if the nation’s
citizens are to avoid being buffeted in
the future by rising and falling energy
costs.
“With the historic election of Barack Obama to president, our nation
enjoys new opportunities to confront

monumental challenges, especially the
convergence of energy, climate change,
and security,” said Stanislaw.
The chief executive offer of JA Stanislaw Group and independent senior
advisor to Deloitte, Stanislaw emphasized the difficulty of making and
implementing energy choices.
During previous oil price shocks,
presidents have pledged to develop

an energy strategy to lessen US dependence on imported oil. Yet, US oil
imports have continued to increase.
Stanislaw noted that if the US car
fleet had the same average fuel economy
as European cars, then the US would
import about 3 million b/d less oil,
making it less dependent upon oil-producing countries such as Venezuela.

The Deloitte conference featured a
panel discussion on the future of US
energy policy that included among its
panelists Guy F. Caruso, senior adviser
for the Center for Strategic & International Studies.
Caruso said the upcoming Obama
administration will be called upon to
balance economic recovery with energy
policy and environmental policy.
“These policy changes could have
long-term impact,” Caruso said. “Projected impacts of climate change and
carbon constraints are potential game
changers.”
Other panelists were Michelle
Michot Foss, University of Texas chief
energy economist; and Vicky A. Bailey,
president of Anderson Stratton International LLC energy management
consultants. Regarding the status of the
global oil market, Caruso listed four key
indicators to watch during 2009-12: oil
demand in emerging economies, investments in productive capacity, investments in refining capacity, and financial
investments in oil futures.
Caruso formerly worked for Parisbased International Energy Agency and
for US Energy Information Administration. CSIS serves as a strategic planning
partner for the government by conducting research and analysis and developing policy initiatives.
Bailey suggested that after Obama
takes office, he might want to do some
things quickly that do not involve getting into climate change policy, which
is expected to involve lengthy discussions and congressional debate.

Bailey suggested government might
look at helping stimulate jobs in energy.
She also advocated an educational focus
on engineering and science.
Stanislaw agreed, suggesting educators identify skills that schools can teach
to promote a workforce to usher in
what he called “a new era of energy and
environmental progress—these include

more traditional skills, which can be
supplied by workers like electricians
and welders as well as more advanced
engineering skills.”
Foss said the Obama administration
needs a framework for its first 100 days
to filter issues.
“I don’t think climate is the right

one. Maybe it should be energy investment,” Foss said. She also said the public dialogue so far on climate change
has not necessarily served the public
well, and she advocated more discussion on the issue.
“In earth science, we look at carbon
dioxide as a marker or an indicator but
not as a cause,” Foss said. ✦

Colorado’s new
oil and gas rules

W

ant a glimpse of one of 2009’s
potentially biggest domestic
production issues? Look no further
than the new oil and gas regulations
Colorado adopted Dec. 11.
The Colorado Oil & Gas Association thinks they’re awful. Earthworks,
formed to oppose mining practices
but expanded its efforts into oil and
gas in 1999, thinks they’re terrific.
The state’s Oil and Gas Conservation Commission unanimously approved changes it said would provide
greater protection for Colorado’s
water, wildlife, and communities.
The regulations also apply to private and federal land because they
are “grounded in the police powers
of the state” to protect the public’s
safety and welfare, COGCC said.
The commission developed the
new rules after Colorado’s general
assembly adopted House Bills 1341
and 1298 in its 2007 session. COGCC
said the process involved public
meetings statewide, thousands of
comments and testimony, 23 days of
hearings and deliberation before final
vote. The legislature will review the
rules in its 2009 session.

Primary provisions
Key provisions include establishing
protection zones around streams that
serve public drinking water supplies,
requiring producers to keep track of
and disclose drilling chemicals they
use to state and emergency responders, managing erosion and reducing
water pollution around production
sites during storms and snow run-off
periods, and reducing odors from development near homes and schools.
COGCC said producers also will be
required to let the state’s health de28

partment and wildlife agency consult
and offer recommendations, notify
nearby landowners and seek public
comments on proposed projects.
Operators also will have the ability to
submit large-scale development plans
to expedite or eliminate some permit
reviews, the commission said.
“The rules grandfather most existing operations and will be phased
in over several months to provide
for a smooth implementation,” it
indicated. COGCC also has received
approval to hire new employees and
is planning training sessions with
producers, it added.

Burdensome
But John Swartout, COGA senior
vice-president for policy and government affairs, said Dec. 11 that
COGCC’s new regulations “create
the most expensive, time-consuming
and burdensome regulatory environment in the nation, all at a time when
Colorado should be fighting to keep
jobs.” The rules also don’t achieve the
legislative intent to create a “timely
and efficient” drilling permit application process because they add
“numerous and burdensome layers…
to the already cumbersome process.”
Earthworks took the opposite view.
“A commission that had been oil and
gas industry-dominated for decades
now has a balance of representation
from the industry, local government,
public health, agriculture, and wildlife sectors, with a mandate to protect
public health and the environment
in the course of oil and gas development,” it said on Dec. 12.
Colorado’s new rules take effect

official who warned: “We literally have
hundreds of [Oil Pollution Act] cases in
our ‘no further action’ file due to the
Rapanos decision, most of which are oil
spill cases…. Again, we do have a file
with well over 100 cases held due to
Rapanos.”
The actual problems may be worse
than messages from those and other EPA
regional offices describe, Waxman and
Oberstar said. EPA withheld hundreds
of documents from the committees and
redacted the identities of every corporation or individual as well as specific affected waters in material that the agency
supplied, the two House committee
chairmen said.
“As you assemble your new environmental team and develop your agenda
for next year, we would like to work
with you in a cooperative manner to
restore the integrity and effectiveness of
a program that is vital to the health and
environment of the American people,”
they told Obama. ✦

EU reaches ‘three 20s’
energy-climate agreement
The 27-nation European Union
reached a unanimous agreement on
the climate-energy package at its Dec.
11-12 summit. The agreement means
member states must fulfill the “three
20s” target: By 2020 each country must
bring down its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% from its 1990 level, bring
the share of renewables in the energy
mix to 20% from the current 8%, and
achieve energy savings of 20%.
Since the targets were set in early
2008, the more recent financial crises
have given several countries second
thoughts that the free allowances of
the Carbon Dioxide Emissions Trading
Scheme, which are to become payable from 2013, would strain them too
much.
The agreement is expected to bolster
Europe’s position at the Copenhagen
climate conference scheduled at yearend 2009. ✦

PERSONNEL MOVES AND

Shell pauses
Corrib project

I

n the oil and gas business there
are times when projects come to
a standstill or even halt altogether.
Something along those lines has happened to Royal Dutch Shell PLC in
Ireland.
Readers of this column will not
need reminding of Shell’s Corrib gas
project, and all of the controversy
surrounding it over the past several
years.
It seems Shell has decided to push
the pause button for the time being.
In fact, Ireland’s planning board,
An Bord Pleanala, last week announced that Shell EP Ireland has
withdrawn its planning application
for a modified onshore pipeline
for the Corrib gas project. Shell did
not comment on the decision, but
sources close to the project told the
Irish Times that a revised application
under the fast-tracking legislation
would be lodged in the new year.

Additional information sought
An Bord Pleanala had been seeking
crucial additional information from
the Corrib gas developers on the new
pipeline route, which was modified
as a result of a recommendation by
government mediator Peter Cassells.
Last August, the board gave the
developers 6 weeks to provide additional information regarding the
development’s impact on the stability
of ground in the area, on its environmental impact, and the impact of any
extension of the life of wellfields.
An Bord Pleanala also sought
reports on a post-landslide site at
Derrybrien wind farm in Co Galway,
as referred to in the company’s environmental impact statement.
The proposed 9-km, high-pressure
30

pipeline route extends from a landfall
at Glengad under Dooncarton mountain, where there was a series of
landslides in September 2003.
Sources close to the company said
a combination of factors had influenced the decision to withdraw the
current application. Among them is a
delay until next year in laying the offshore pipeline, and a recent direction
that disposal of peat unearthed in any
pipe-laying must be incorporated in
any planning application.

No overall delay
Sources said this allowed for time
to submit a fresh application, along
with the same environmental impact
statement. There would be “no overall delay” to the project as a result.
It also is understood that there
will be no fundamental change to the
modified route, but the Irish Times
said there will be some “adjustments,” described as “minor,” in the
new application.
But don’t expect the controversy
to die down.
To allay public concerns, Shell
consultants RPS said that “a revised
application will now seek minor
realignments to part of the proposed
route for the Corrib onshore pipeline, in order to avoid more sensitive
habitat, including bog pools, in the
Rossport commonage, identified during recent surveys.”
That did not satisfy opponents.
In fact, spokesman for community
group Pobal Chill Chomain, John
Monaghan, questioned how such surveys had been undertaken since there
was a District Court order preventing
Shell from carrying out such invasive
works in the commonage. ✦

XTO Energy Inc. has promoted Keith
A. Hutton to chief executive ofﬁcer and

In November, Iraq approved construction of two refineries, scheduled
to have total capacity of 300,000 b/d.
Previously, Iraq approved two other new

Iraqi Oil Minister Hussan AlShahrastani said Iraq needs help from
outside companies to stem the decline
in oil production and to help develop
new fields.
Al-Shahrastani said the next 2 years
will be crucial to rebuild the oil sector,

Fayetteville progress

Southwestern Energy Co., Houston,
which had planned to accelerate its
Mississippian Fayetteville shale play in
Arkansas in 2009, will instead keep
about the same level of activity as in
2008.
The company, however, indicated
that it is more immune to weak gas
prices than companies in many other
shale plays.

Southwestern’s land holding is
855,000 net acres and still growing.
Of that, 125,400 net acres are held by
conventional production on the west
side of the play.
Through September, Southwestern
had drilled 720 wells, 650 of them
horizontal, in the numerous pilot areas
marked by red and blue squares on the
map.
The company was to have participated in 520 horizontal wells in 2008,
75% of them operated.

Economic factors
A combination of elements leads
Southwestern to believe that the Fayetteville is one of the best quality North
American shale plays, Korell indicated.
Years from now when we can look
back and compare the shale plays, the
Fayetteville will have yielded better
returns than the core of the Fort Worth
Barnett shale, he opined.
Part of this is because of Southwestern’s low costs and dominant position
with finding and development costs
under $2/Mcf, he said. Southwestern’s
royalty interest averages 15%, low relative to later Fayetteville entrants.
Korell said he has reorganized the
company’s “idea people” who have
been implementing the Fayetteville play
into a new “idea generation group” and

dedicated some seed money to investigate new opportunities. He did not
elaborate.
Meanwhile, the 1.2 bcfd Boardwalk
Pipeline Partners LP pipeline from Conway County to White County, expected
to begin taking gas in late 2008 or early
2009, will add 800 MMcfd of capacity
for Southwestern.
Boardwalk, originally expected to
start up in September, is tackling a
troublesome 2,300-ft river crossing.

Vulcan Minerals Inc., St. John’s, expects a busy year in several exploration
plays in Newfoundland and Labrador in
2009.
Vulcan plans to drill a 3,600-m
exploration well, Robinson-1, onshore
in the Bay St. George basin that would
be the basin’s deepest well ever. It is
on a seismically defined structure with
several prospective reservoirs.
A drill pad is being built for the well,

resources in eastern Canada’s Maritimes basin.
The company, through its US subsidiary Triangle USA Petroleum Corp.,
held a 27% working interest in 12,100
gross acres in northeast Hill County,
Tex., developing the Barnett shale in the
Fort Worth basin, before divesting that
interest in July 2007.
Triangle also explored and drilled
20,000 gross acres in a Fayetteville
shale joint venture in the Arkoma basin
with Houston-based Kerogen Resources
Inc. (OGJ, Sept. 17, 2007, p. 59). The
company may divest the Arkansas holdings, said Howard Anderson, Triangle’s
president and chief operating officer.
Triangle’s threefold Canadian strategy
has been to:
• Acquire an early position in large,
contiguous blocks.
• Use expertise gained from previous projects.
• Add joint-venture partners to

These methods extract remaining
oil through increasing oil mobility by
reducing oil viscosity, reducing water
mobility by increasing water viscosity,
or reducing capillary forces by reducing
interfacial tension between the displacing fluid and oil.
Thermal methods are usually suitable
for high viscosity oils, while chemical
methods are mostly for low to medium
viscosity oils.
Remaining oil saturation is perhaps
the most critical criterion in selecting
the EOR method. The choice also depends on such considerations as depth,
oil viscosity, etc.8 Thermal EOR methods
are often the best for recovering heavy
oil. Thermal methods provide a driving
force and heat for reducing oil viscosity
and improving its mobility.

Thermal processes
The world contains about 10 trillion
bbl of heavy oil resources.9 Egypt has
about 3 billion bbl of heavy oil in place
with about 40% in the Eastern desert,
3% in the Western desert, 18% in Sinai,
and 39% in the Gulf of Suez.10
The recovery factors for the world’s
heavy oil vary from a fraction of a percent to 80%, depending on the oil and
the reservoir characteristics, as well as

the technique used. Heavy oil viscosities
vary from 100 to 1,000 cp at reservoir
temperature. Heavy crudes typically also
contain 3 wt % or more sulfur, 10-30%
asphaltenes, and as much as 2,000 ppm
of vanadium compounds.9
Cyclic-steam stimulation is one of
the most common thermal processes
in use. It involves injecting steam and
then producing oil for the same well. It
is considered an economic oil recovery
method that costs about $20/bbl of oil
recovered.
Oil recovery factors for cyclic-steam
in Cold Lake, Alta., are more than 25%,
while in Venezuela recoveries as high as
40% have been noted.9
Continuous steamflooding, much
like waterflooding, is a pattern drive,
with arrays of injection and production wells. In this case, the recovery
factor largely depends on the pattern
size, since heat loss to the surrounding

ervoir engineering study to evaluate
enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in the
Upper Dolomite of Issaran oil field. It
targeted the Upper Dolomite because of
its large original oil in place (more than
50% of the concession OOIP) and its
low estimated primary recovery of less
than 1%.
In 2004, the company conducted a
successful cyclic-steam stimulation pilot
in well Issaran-44. Initial evaluation
indicated that the oil recovery factor
from this reservoir could reach 20%
compared with about 1% under natural
depletion. Fig. 2 compares the simulated and actual results that confirm the
pilot’s success.
Based on the pilot, the company decided to begin commercial production.
Its redevelopment plan included three
phases. Two phases finished in 2007
and the third phase will be finalized in
2008.
The phases involve cyclic-steam

in 2004. Initially, a simple sector model
evaluated the feasibility of implementing steam injection in the fields. The
model considered vertical and highangle wells.
This model indicated that steam injection would succeed. It showed good
results for small 10-acre or less drainage areas and recovery factors of about
double of those for cold recovery.
Later, the operator used a more
sophisticated sector model to design the

started preparation for the initial pilot
plan for cyclic steam stimulation. This
pilot placed a 25-MMbtu steam generator in each field and involved two wells
in each field. The pilot alternated steam
injection and production between the
two wells.
Steam injection started in Oudeh
in September 2006 and in Tishrine
in October 2006. After 4 months of
operation in Oudeh, steam injection
had to stop for 8 months (February to
September 2007) due to excess H2S in
the fuel gas.
The pilot projects have expanded
with time. Currently, they involve five
25-MMbtu steam generators in each
field and 14 wells in Oudeh and 23

wells in Tishrine. Initially, the operator
injected steam through the annulus in
the first 3 wells of each pilot. Now, all
injection goes through vacuum insulated tubing.
Figs. 6 and 7 show the performance
of the pilots.
In June 2008, the cyclic steam injection increased production to 850 b/d
from about 550 bbl/d in Oudeh and
to 2,500 b/d from about 750 bbl/d in
Tishrine. Lack of steam injection from
February to September 2007 affected
Oudeh production.
The steam/oil ratio in this pilot
ranges from 1 in the very good wells to
20 in the poorer wells.

In 2008, growth in crude distillation
capacity continued to build on momentum of past years; refiners added more
capacity than the past 2 years, according
to the latest OGJ Refinery Survey. For
the seventh year running, worldwide
capacity is at a record level.
Last year’s refinery survey listed a
global capacity of 85.309 million b/
cd in 657 refineries as of Jan. 1, 2008.
This year’s OGJ
survey shows a
total capacity of
85.603 million
b/cd in 655
refineries, an increase of nearly
300,000 b/cd.
This year’s capacity growth is greater
than the growth in 2007 and 2006
of 130,000 b/cd and 52,000 b/cd,
respectively. The number of refineries,
on the other hand, has been on a steady
decrease. In the past 10 years, the global
refining industry has shut down more
than 100 refineries, mostly smaller, less-

in the amount of refining capacity, up
about 269,000 b/cd, or 1.2%. Western
Europe added about 34,000 b/cd, or
0.2%.
North America showed a slight net
decrease of 7,500 b/cd.
Other regions experienced no net
gain or loss in stated capacity.

New crude capacity
This year’s survey lists one new
refinery. All other increases in refining
capacity occurred in existing facilities.
In mid June, China Petroleum &
Chemical Corp. (Sinopec) started up
a $1.8-billion refinery in Qingdao,
China. The company reported that the
200,000-b/cd refinery will produce
transportation fuels that will meet Euro
III emission standards as well as petrochemical products.
The largest single-facility increase
occurred in Valero Energy Corp.’s Jean
Gaulin refinery in Quebec. The company reported a capacity of 260,000 b/cd,
up from 215,000 b/cd, which was the

efficient plants.
Fig. 1 shows the trend in operable
refineries and worldwide capacity.
A new refinery start-up in China,
expansions in other refineries, and
capacity creep that offset losses were the
main reasons for the capacity increases
in the latest survey.
Asia experienced the largest increase

capacity listed in last year’s survey.
Two refineries in Asia experienced
30,000-b/cd increases. LG-Caltex
reported an increase to 680,000 b/

WORLDWIDE REFINING

acquired from Kyushu Oil Co. Ltd. this
year.
In the US, the largest reported capacity increase occurred in Frontier Oil
Corp.’s El Dorado, Kan., refinery. Frontier reported a 16,000-b/cd increase,
growing to 126,000 b/cd in this year’s
survey from 110,000 b/cd reported in
last year’s survey.
Another major increase in reported
capacity occurred in LyondellBasell’s
Berre l’Etang, France, refinery, which it
acquired from Royal Dutch Shell Group
in 2008. The refinery increased capacity to 105,000 b/cd from 78,000 b/cd

Reﬁnery closures, delistings
As in 2007, no refineries shut
down in 2008, mainly due to high
refining margins early in the year that
made the vast majority of refineries
profitable.
The removals of refineries from this
year’s survey include MOL Hungarian
Oil & Gas Co.’s Tiszaujvaros, Hungary,
and Koramo Kolin’s Czech Republic refineries. The plants were removed from
the survey because they process no raw
crude.
In addition, the Suncor Energy Inc.,

Denver, refinery was removed from the
survey. The company reported that the
Denver and Commerce City refineries are operating as a single, integrated
plant.
Other refineries lost capacity as
owners restated and updated the survey
numbers.

than 200,000 b/cd of capacity in Asia,
the US, and Western Europe. Capacities
from Tables 1 and 2 include partial interests in refineries that the companies
do not wholly own.
Significant changes from last year
involve Total SA, Chevron Corp., Nippon
Oil, Marathon Oil Corp., Valero, BP PLC,
and Alon USA.
On Aug. 30, 2007, Murco Petroleum
Ltd., a UK subsidiary of Murphy Oil
Corp., agreed to purchase Total’s 70%
interest in the Milford Haven, Wales,
UK, refinery for $250 million. This
year’s survey reflects the ownership
change for the 108,000-b/cd refinery.
Murco previously held a 30% interest
and now owns the entire plant.
This transaction was sufficient to
move Total down two spots in Table
1. Last year’s survey lists the company
with 2.719 million b/cd of capacity. This year’s survey shows that the
company owns 2.655 million b/cd of
capacity.
Similar to 2007, Petroplus acquired
two European refineries. The company
purchased the Petit Couronne and Reichstett Vendenheim refineries in France
from Shell.
The Petit Couronne refinery has
a capacity of 154,000 b/cd and the
Reichstett Vendenheim refinery has a
capacity of 85,000 b/cd.
The acquisition, completed on Apr.
1, 2008, was first announced on Aug.
2, 2007, and had to go through the European Commission’s approval process.
The net purchase price, including estimated inventory and other adjustments,
was about $785 million.
Petroplus now has 792,000 b/cd of
refining capacity, up from 552,000 b/
cd at yearend 2007 and 300,000 b/cd
in 2006.
On Oct. 1, 2008, Nippon Oil acquired Kyushu Oil, which increased
its refining capacity to 1.3 million b/
cd from 1.16 million b/cd as listed in
last year’s survey. In addition, Nippon
reported that the refinery has a capacity
of 160,000 b/cd.
The acquisition moved Nippon Oil
from 17 to 15 in Table 1. Nippon also

production capacity of 105,000 b/cd, is
adjacent to a LyondellBasell polyolefins

In Table 2, Shell fell from second to
third due to the loss of three refineries
in Western Europe.
Other changes in capacity that
appear in Tables 1 and 2 are due to
adjustments in declared capacity. In

Italian ENI and Russian Gazprom
signed a memorandum of understanding regarding construction of the South
Stream pipeline June 23, 2007. The line
will run from Russia across the bottom
of the Black Sea to Bulgaria, splitting
there with one arm heading westward
via Greece to Italy and another arm
flowing northward to Serbia with possible continuation into Central Europe.
From Varna, Bulgaria, the southwestern route will continue through Greece,
crossing the Ionian Sea to southern Italy.
The northwestern pipeline will run
through Serbia, Hungary, and Slovenia
to Austria, ending at Baumgarten gas
storage. Another option would run the
northwestern route through Slovenia to
northern Italy instead.
Russia and Bulgaria signed the agreement governing Bulgaria’s participation
in the project Jan. 18, 2008. Before
Serbia joined Russia in South Stream,
Gazprom and Serbia’s state-owned gas
company Srbijagas (Serbian Gas Co.)
agreed to study building a gas pipeline from Bulgaria through Serbia. By
Feb. 25, 2008, the two companies had
formed a joint venture to build the
Serbian section of the South Stream and
a large gas storage facility near Banatski
Dvor, Serbia.
Russia and Hungary agreed to set
up an equally owned joint company
to build and operate the Hungarian
section of the pipeline on the same
day. Hungary is a shareholder in the
EU-backed Nabucco pipeline, aimed
at bringing gas from Central Asia to
Europe while bypassing Russia. Its
agreement with Russia on South Stream
prompted US concerns Budapest may
sideline the EU project, aimed at reducing Europe’s energy reliance on Moscow.
Russia and Greece signed an intergovernmental agreement covering
construction and operation of the Greek
section of South Stream on Apr. 29,
2008.
Russia’s agreement with Serbia provided Gazprom with extremely favorable terms for work in Serbia, while

Another document still awaiting
ratification is sale of 51% in the Serbian national oil company to Russian
Gazpromneft for €400 million (OGJ,
Jan. 28, 2008, p. 5). Even after ratification, however, Serbian oil and gas fields
(Fig. 2) will remain Serbian property.
The ratification was initially scheduled
for May, but internal Serbian political
problems have repeatedly postponed
ratification.
EU gas demand will rise to roughly
800 billion cu m/year by 2030 from
current levels of 540 billion cu m/year.3

while Serbia heightened the long-term

South Stream would set back the energy security objectives of the European
Union and the US on two major counts:
• It would preempt markets targeted
by the Nabucco project, cementing a
Russian monopoly on some of them
and breaking into new ones, while
increasing overall European dependence
on Russian-delivered gas.
• It would carry gas from Central
Asia via Russia, preempting Turkmen
and other gas volumes and strengthening Russia’s monopoly on Central Asian
gas, despite Western intentions to the
contrary.

The webcast will be based on the annual Forecast and Review
special report appearing this year in the January 19th issue of
Oil & Gas Journal. The Forecast and Review projects oil and gas
demand worldwide and in the US for the new year. The US forecast
analyzes demand by petroleum product (such as gasoline, diesel,
jet fuel, and so forth). The Forecast and Review includes forecasts
for US and Canadian drilling activity.
In addition to the 2009 forecast, the webcast will include past
predictions compared with actual performance and industry trends
for the previous four years. Bob Tippee, Editor, will make the presentation, with Marilyn Radler, Senior Editor-Economics, and G. Alan
Petzet, Chief Editor-Exploration, on hand for questions. Marilyn
assembles the numbers and writes copy for the supply-demand
portions of the Forecast and Review. Alan does the drilling forecast.

Camera has UL/CSA certiﬁcation

New well test separator

The MIC1-440 PTZ camera is now Underwriter Laboratories/Canadian Standards
Association certified,
allowing the unit to
fulfill an added level
of explosion-protected qualification
and meet regional
requirements for
hazardous locations
such as oil and gas
fields, chemical processing plants, and
refineries.
Its 320° tilt
enables viewing
above and below the
camera for comprehensive site surveillance, while IP68/NEMA 4X ratings help
ensure high performance imaging in harsh
environmental conditions, the company
says.

The new CleanPhase well test separator
system enables optimum retention of fluids, allowing for cleaner phases and better
measurements.
The firm says its system is a rejuvenated
approach to phase isolation during the
separation process. The new generation
well test separator allows flow-back activities to be conducted through increasing
safety, reducing manual intervention, and
providing seamless operations.
The firm notes that an operator in
North Africa tested 22 wells using the
separator, which accurately measured flow
rates from wells producing gas, condensate, and water.
The separator has SmartWeir technology that uses radar unobtrusively to monitor liquid levels and adjust the weir to
accommodate well effluents. It also allows
on line separation for the entire job, from
the beginning of cleanup until the end of
the well test.

The first reservoir fluids are identified
sooner than with traditional methods, allowing the well testing to begin earlier, the
company points out. It allows fast cleanups
by flowing the well to a higher-pressure
vessel than is possible with conventional
setups, which require flowing to a lowpressure surge tank. This eliminates the
need for and risk of pressurized storage
tanks, the company says.
The separator handles high water cut
and fluctuating flow rates without slowing down the process, which leads to
the isolation and measurement of purer
single-phase fluids. The separator provides
high-quality and high-capacity phase separation for fast cleanups, better measurements, and increased certainty, according
to the company.
It can operate as a stand-alone unit or
in combination with the PhaseTester multiphase flowmeter.

Smelly political,
ﬁnancial reports
gag Democrats
Not that Republicans haven’t exploded
their share of stink bombs in recent years,
but the week ending Dec. 12 was especially
malodorous for Democrats.
Most attention went to the Dec. 9 arrest
of Democratic Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich
on suspicion he abused his ofﬁce for personal gain.
Among numerous outrages in federal
charges against him is his alleged intent

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

to sell the Senate seat of President-elect
Barack Obama.
Prosecutors stressed that charges
against the governor don’t implicate
Obama, for whom the news nevertheless
can be no minor cause for worry.
The Chicago scandal provides a reminder of the sweetheart deal on a Chicago
house made for Obama in 2005 by political
supporter Tony Rezko, a Blagojevich aide
convicted in June on corruption charges.
That mess mostly obscured disclosure,
also on Dec. 9, of the expansion of what
Democrats hoped would be a quickly
ﬁnished and forgotten ethics investigation
of Charles Rangel (D-NY), chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee.
Rangel in September requested that the
House Committee on Standards of Ofﬁcial
Conduct examine his personal ﬁnances
after questions arose about his control
of rent-stabilized apartments in Harlem,
unpaid taxes, and use of congressional
stationery in fund raising for the Rangel
Center for Public Service at the City College
of New York.
The investigation now will deal also with
a New York Times report that Rangel supported a tax measure favorable to Nabors
Industries Ltd. on the same day he met with
Nabors Chairman and Chief Executive Eugene Isenberg about a $1 million contribution to the Rangel Center.
Rangel and Isenberg deny any link exists
between the tax issue and donation.
Ultimately worse for Democrats might
be the arrest on Dec. 11 of New York stock
broker and former Nasdaq Stock Market
Chairman Bernard Madoff on federal fraud
complaints. Madoff is accused of swindling
investors out of $50 billion.
The scandal will exacerbate public skepticism about Wall Street and complicate
efforts by a newly Democratic government
to solve US economic problems.
And one way Madoff used his allegedly
ill-gotten riches was to contribute generously to political campaigns, almost all of
them Democratic.

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

Another year without Santa
With the Christmas holidays approaching, members of the oil and gas industry
are anticipating stockings full of rocks from the new Santa-elect in Washington, DC,
while other industries’ wishes for bundles of cash will come true.
“We are seeing trillions of dollars spent by governments around the world to ‘bail
out’ all types of businesses that are ‘too big to fail.’ Where were these guys when energy businesses were failing in the mid 1980s?” complained analysts in the Houston
ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc.
They then answered their own question: “Energy is considered a necessary evil
by most politicians and consumers. The reality is that rising energy prices are generally bad for most developed countries (especially the US) and falling energy prices
are good for most of the world.”
Low energy prices are so good, in fact, that it will provide consumers with a
2009 “dividend” that will rival the size of all the announced bailout plans around
the globe, said Raymond James analysts. “Based upon our 2009 estimated energy
prices, a rough estimate of the potential beneﬁcial impact of lower energy prices
for global consumers next year is about $1.7 trillion or 3.2% of global gross national
product,” they reported. That includes lower prices for oil, gas, and coal.
Political inﬂuences
It’s true, however, that some industries are too big—both in numbers of employees and political clout—to be allowed to go under. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 850,100 people employed in the US manufacture of motor vehicles and parts
in September. That jumps to 1,572,200 workers if manufacture of all transportation
equipment is included, from cars to garbage trucks and recreational vehicles.
Energy prices fell Dec. 12 as Democrat and Republican Senators split along party
lines on a proposed $14 billion bailout of General Motors and Chrysler. The companies eventually will be rescued, however; campaigning Democrats promised to put
US voters back to work and therefore can not add thousands of auto workers to the
unemployment lines. Both the number of unemployed persons (10.3 million) and the
unemployment rate (6.7%) continued to increase in November. Since the start of the
recession in December 2007, the number of unemployed workers increased by 2.7
million, and the unemployment rate rose by 1.7 percentage points.
As for the petroleum industry, US Department of Labor statistics list 9,320 workers employed in oil and gas extraction in September; 1,760 in pipeline transportation
of crude; another 2,090 in “other pipeline transportation;” and 22,390 in “petroleum
and coal products manufacturing.” Even if the oil and gas industry could claim all of
those employees, that totals 355,500 workers. Not only does it fall far short of the
numbers making autos and parts, it’s even less than the 379,000 people working
in motion picture and sound recording; 428,000 employed in performing arts and
spectator sports; and 867,000 in publishing (excluding the internet). What’s more,
a greater percentage of workers in the four other industries are likely members of
unions that have political inﬂuence with the incoming administration.
Even among major oil producing states, oil industry workers are a minority
accounting for 41.7% of total employment in Alaska; 31.5% in Louisiana, 17.9% in
Wyoming, 13.1% in Texas, and 12.5% in Oklahoma, according to DOL. Of those, only
Texas is among those states with the biggest populations, and it has sided with the
Republicans more than the Democrats in recent years.
One out of ﬁve auto manufacture jobs are at Big Three facilities in the Detroit
area, but 61% of all automotive workers make vehicle parts in Michigan, Ohio,
Indiana, Tennessee, Illinois, Kentucky, New York, California, Pennsylvania, and North
Carolina, several of which are key states in presidential primaries.
It’s no wonder then that only oil workers and some representatives of producing
states are dismayed when oil prices plunge. But as Raymond James analysts previously pointed out, low oil prices are their own best cure.
The “material savings” from lower fuel prices “should facilitate a gradual recovery in oil demand, though the timing of this process will largely depend on the pace
of macroeconomic recovery,” the analysts said, adding, “While macrovisibility is still
minimal, we believe that our current working assumption of a 2% decline in 2009
global oil demand will probably prove overly aggressive. Once oil demand begins to
rebound within the context of broader global economic recovery, it should support a
sustained rise in oil prices, hence our gradually rising price forecast beyond the lows
of the ﬁrst quarter of 2009.”

IMPROVING ASSET PERFORMANCE: A HOLISTIC APPROACH

I

n challenging economic times, upper
management pushes hard to protect
their shareholders’ return on net assets.
For the people who manage those assets
daily, that typically means doing more with
less. But how?
Improving asset performance requires a
systematic focus of your efforts: What are
the real issues that contribute to unreliable
performance? What are the underlying
reasons (not just the symptoms) when your
facility experiences performance problems?

UNDERSTANDING YOUR NEEDS
Unreliable performance can be the result
of equipment failure, human error, or
a combination of both. The General
Reliability Model (Fig. 1) shows that
weaknesses in the management system
and culture issues are the underlying
reasons for most equipment failures and
human errors.
As a facilities manager, you can make
initial improvements by solving the
causes of speciﬁc equipment failures and
human errors. The beneﬁts, however, will
last much longer if you also address any
weaknesses in the management system and

cultural issues that may have contributed
to the asset performance problems.
ABS Consulting has an improvement
strategy that addresses these issues and
provides a framework for the sustained
improvement of asset performance:
• Eliminating the causes of equipment
failures – including human error – that
affect system performance
• Creating a culture and management
system to sustain improvement
• Establishing effective and efﬁcient
methods to monitor system performance
and drive continuous improvement

IMPROVEMENT TOOLS
There are many tools for improving
reliability and quality, but few of them
address all the issues. ABS Consulting
has found that selecting and applying
an appropriate mix of the various tools
in combination is more likely to help
organizations achieve and sustain improved
asset performance:
• Screening tools, such as Pareto
analysis, for determining which asset
performance problems are the most
signiﬁcant contributors

• Performance measurement systems, such
as Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)
and Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)

A SUCCESSFUL TEAM
For some organizations, assembling a
team with the skills, abilities and time
to implement a successful improvement
strategy is a challenge. ABS Consulting’s
Reliability and Maintenance Management
experts can provide the services you
need and assist with all phases of your
improvement program.
Contact an ABS Consulting representative
soon to ﬁnd out how we can:
• Help you develop an effective assetimprovement strategy
• Help your facilities personnel identify
the most signiﬁcant contributors to
unreliable asset performance
• Help your organization assess,
improve, and implement more effective
management systems
• Help you establish appropriate
performance measurement tools and
continuous improvement systems
• Help you establish a “reliability culture”
ABS Consulting also offers coaching and
training that will give your personnel the
skills and conﬁdence they need to execute
your performance improvement plan. The
solution you’ve been looking for may be
just a phone call away.

Rebuilding Together was founded 30 years ago to improve the homes
and lives of low-income homeowners. In 2005, it launched the Energy-Efficient
Homes Initiative (EEHI) in partnership with API to introduce an energy-saving
component to some projects. With employee volunteers, API has sponsored
some 100 projects, donating $5,000 to $10,000 for each home’s energy-efficient
windows, appliances and other energy-saving components. This is the story
about a few families they helped, as told by API staffer Juan R. Palomo, who
has worked on houses around the country.

HURRICANES | By Cathy Landry

AFTER THE STORMS

Assessing the aftermath of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike and the lessons
learned from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

Packing a Punch. Hurricane Ike gathers strength over the Gulf before making landfall in Texas.

The U.S. oil and natural gas industry
was dealt a walloping blow in
September, sustaining a one-two
punch inflicted to the midsection of
the nation’s energy infrastructure by
hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Just like
the hugely powerful back-to-back
hurricanes of 2005 – Katrina and
Rita – the 2008 storms plowed into
the Gulf Coast region, leaving
destruction in their wakes.
All of the storms left families
displaced and property destroyed,
damaged or flooded. But for the oil
and natural gas industry, thanks in
large part to years of preparations,
improvements and the learning of
lessons taught during the previous
storms, the most recent hurricanes
were far less destructive.

Comparing the effects of Gustav
and Ike versus Katrina and Rita is a
difficult proposition since each storm
had its own unique set of features,
including different storm paths and
intensities. Katrina left in its wake
death and destruction after the levees
broke in New Orleans, while Ike was
known for its enormous storm surge,
which all but leveled the city of
Galveston. Gustav brought pouring
rain and whipping winds to a broad
swath of the Gulf region, while Rita,
which registered as a category-five
hurricane while it was out in the
Gulf of Mexico, flooded refineries
and low-lying areas of the Louisiana/
Texas coast.
So, while the hurricanes were
unique in character, and it still will

be some time before a final assessment
is concluded on the industry’s handling
of Gustav and Ike, reports indicate
that many of the changes the industry
put in place during the past three
years worked. Improvements were
seen across the spectrum – from the
stability of drilling rigs and platforms,
improved power restoration at
refineries, better fuel distribution
in the evacuation regions and better
communication with federal, state
and local emergency officials.
“The key to success in recovery
efforts is established in the dialog
before the event even occurs,” says
Robin Rorick, API’s director of Marine
and Security. “That’s why the industry
and the government worked so hard
in the post-Katrina and Rita years.” »

A Quick Response. Coast Guard HH-65C rescue helicopters conducted overflight search and
rescue operations following the landfall of Hurricane Gustav in Louisiana.

Greater cooperation and communication between government and
industry led to the improvements seen
in the oil and natural gas industry’s
emergency-response efforts this
hurricane season, Rorick says. “During
Katrina and Rita, the government
understood oil and natural gas were
important, but not how and why. We
worked with them over the past three
years to explain the how and the why.”
The key issue to understand, is
the interdependency of the nation’s
critical industries, and specifically the
importance of the energy industry to
relief efforts and the national economy.
“Just think about it: If you don’t have
fuel for generators, the ice in storage
meant to help those left homeless
or evacuated from the storm melts,”
Rorick explains. “If you don’t have
fuel, you can’t move the relief trucks
to where they need to be. If you don’t
have electricity, you can’t pump gas or
run a refinery, which means you don’t
have the fuel to allow evacuated
citizens to return home.”
Communications between the
government and the industry broke
down during Katrina and Rita, which
led to difficulties in getting workers
back to their jobs and returning
operations to normal. During
Katrina and Rita, some workers and
contractors were unable to access
their work sites because they were not

allowed entry by state or local officials.
Following the 2005 hurricanes, the
industry explained this problem to
public officials and showed them why
access was so vital to rapid recovery
of petroleum facilities. Public officials
responded and implemented better
communication and new credentialing
procedures that virtually eliminated
the problem during the 2008 storms,
Rorick says.
Another example of how industrygovernment cooperation worked
better was during flyovers, which
allow the industry to make crucial
initial assessments of damage to
facilities and to the areas nearby.
During Katrina and Rita, it took
days – even weeks – to conduct
flyovers of key oil and natural gas
infrastructure, including refineries,
platforms, processing plants and
pipelines. Each company needed
to hire its own services, creating
an enormous backlog on a limited
resource.
“Close communications between
the U.S. Minerals Management
Service, the U.S. Coast Guard and
the offshore industry provided a far
better preliminary assessment of the
damage,” says Tim Sampson, API’s
hurricane team leader and manager
of exploration and production.
“During the 2005 hurricanes, the
industry had difficulty getting over-

flight imagery of their facilities in a
timely fashion,” Rorick says. “In the
lessons learned process subsequent
to Katrina and Rita the issue was
identified and discussed in detail.
By the time the 2008 hurricanes
occurred, a process and system were
set into place where companies could
actually request flyovers of their
facilities and get pictures to conduct
their preliminary assessments.”
On the retail side, the industry
worked primarily with state and local
officials. For example, Texas worked
with the industry to ensure that fuel
would be available to facilitate the
evacuation and recovery effort. Three
years ago, southeast Texas ran out of
gasoline as Rita approached and
residents in coastal communities and
in Houston rushed to leave the area.
Determined not to let that happen
again, Texas state emergency officials
worked with oil companies, fuel
distributors, terminal operators,
truckers and gasoline stations to
coordinate detailed plans to ensure fuel
supplies were adequate for evacuation.
Electronic signs were posted along
freeways urging motorists to fill up
their tanks early. Some companies and
independent retailers filled storage
tanks along evacuation routes to at
least 65 percent to handle increased
demand. Texas and the companies also
stationed tanker trucks and generators
along the re-entry routes to restock
the pumps once the storm passed.
In addition, they prewired a number
of gasoline stations to handle
generators so the pumps could still
dispense fuel even if the hurricane
caused widespread power outages –
which it did.
“Certainly, the communications
between government and industry
were streamlined and worked better,
but the problems were not entirely
solved. It’s better, but there’s still work
to be done,” says Rorick. “Just as the
industry and the government did
after the 2005 hurricanes, we’ll have
to identify and analyze those areas
that need improvement subsequent

to the 2008 hurricane system. The
most efficient response is one that
continues to evolve and improve.”
On the exploration and production
side, API issued a series of new
standards in 2006 and 2007, drawing
on lessons learned from the 2005
hurricanes. The standards, which
sprung from newly revised wind,
wave and water current measurement
data, included: higher deck heights

storm, “the ability for employees to
more easily get back to the refineries
in order to conduct the assessments
and begin making repairs was a major
help in getting operations restarted.”
For many months, the oil and
natural gas industry will be dealing
with lingering effects from the storm –
including restocking inventories and
fixing platforms and rigs. And it also
will evaluate its performance during
the latest hurricanes to ensure that
emergency preparedness and response
improves again before another major
hurricane blasts into the Gulf of Mexico.
“It’s a process. No response is perfect,
and every response, no matter how
good, can be improved,” Rorick says.
“We always can learn new lessons
and make more improvements.” I

No “significant spills” related to Hurricane
Ike have been reported by federal agencies.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration’s emergency response division
deems a spill “significant” only if it poses a

In general, the greatest volume of
spilled oil results from “land-based
spills,” caused by such things as runoff,
while the second greatest amount
comes from recreational marine
vessels, according to the National
Academies of Science.
On the refining side, recovery
efforts were hampered by loss of
electrical power just as in Katrina and
Rita. But this year refiners received
greater prioritization from utilities,
which enabled damage assessments to
be initiated more quickly, says Cindy
Schild, API refining issues manager.
While there was less damage to
refineries after Ike and Gustav than in
2005’s Hurricane Rita, the 2008 storms
hit the heart of the industry’s refining
sector. According to Schild, lessons
learned during Katrina and Rita
showed their value – from having
redundant forms of communication
in place to better pre-positioning
supplies and generators. Refiners also

systems to reduce damage to other
facilities, such as pipelines, if a rig
breaks loose.
Platform destruction during
Gustav and Ike, at least based on
early estimates from the U.S. Minerals
Management Service, was less than
half that of the damage sustained
during Katrina and Rita, when 115
platforms were destroyed.
Preliminary assessments of the
damage indicate offshore facilities
performed well considering the
magnitude of the two storms,”
Sampson says. “More importantly,
personnel were evacuated without
injuries and, according to USCG,
there were no significant spills from
our facilities.”

STATISTICS REPORT | By Robert Dodge

Hurricane Hurdles
The effects Gustav and Ike had on the oil and natural gas industry show up in recent statistics.
U.S. petroleum deliveries, a measure of demand, are
continuing to decline for 2008. Deliveries fell substantially
during September, adding to the ongoing 2008 pattern,
as Hurricanes Gustav and Ike cut domestic oil and gas
production and interrupted Gulf Coast refinery activity.
“Hurricanes Gustav and Ike hurled some significant
challenges at the industry,” says Ron Planting, API Statistics
Manager.
Planting notes that the combined effects of the two
hurricanes resulted in shutting in about 32 million barrels
of crude oil and 164 billion cubic feet of natural gas. And
about 4 million barrels per day of U.S. refinery capacity
were affected.
As October got underway, the upstream and downstream
segments showed a strong recovery from the hurricanes.
Even so, this year’s trend so far reveals lower demand for
most products than was recorded in 2007, reflecting lower
consumption by consumers and businesses. Analysts
attribute lower demand to higher prices earlier in the year,
as well as declines in economic activity as the meltdown
in financial markets took their toll.
“It is a pretty simple equation. When businesses and
individuals are working less, they use less energy,” says
Planting, adding that the hurricanes socked a substantial
punch to product output during September. “The effects of
Gustav and Ike on the refining sector were extraordinary.”

Hurricane disruptions also hindered the delivery of
foreign crude to Gulf Coast ports. Oil imports in September
fell nearly 13 percent from a year ago to less than nine
million barrels a day. Product imports also fell in September,
dropping 12 percent from a year ago to 12 million barrels
a day. Results affected by the hurricanes included:
•

Gasoline deliveries for September were down 3.8
percent from a year ago, adding to an overall decline
for the third quarter of 4.0 percent. Third-quarter
deliveries averaged 9.12 million barrels a day, the
lowest August-to-September level in six years.

•

Deliveries of distillate fuel oil for the month fell 11.8
percent to 3.7 million barrels a day, the largest yearover-year decline since February 2002. The drop
reflected a big decline in low-sulfur diesel deliveries.

•

September’s deliveries of kerosene jet fuel were
essentially flat when compared to September 2007.
But they fell from August, when jet fuel deliveries were
at their second-highest level in 24 months, and fell
159,000 barrels a day to just over 1.53 million barrels
of daily deliveries. Substantial effects on refining, with
total deliveries of crude oil to distillation units falling
to their lowest levels since February 1992, down 14.2
percent from August and down 15.9 percent from
September 2007. I

oday’s refinery is not your grandfather’s refinery. U.S. refiners are
investing billions of dollars to continue
providing Americans with the energy
they need while facing demands to
produce higher-quality fuels using
crude oil that is more difficult to refine
into gasoline and diesel because it is
heavy, often acidic and high in sulfur.
Even though a new U.S. refinery
has not been built from the ground
up in more than 30 years, existing
refineries are continually being
upgraded and reworked to improve
efficiency and flexibility. Existing U.S.
refining capacity continues to grow,
having expanded from 15.7 million
barrels per day in 1998 to 17.6 million
barrels a day today. This expansion
is the equivalent of nearly 10 new
200,000 barrels-a-day capacity
refineries or one each year.
According to the federal Energy
Information Administration, domestic
refiners currently plan to add between
800,000 and one million barrels per
day in refining capacity of gasoline,
diesel and other fuels by 2010. That
is the equivalent of adding five new
medium-sized refineries through the
expansion of existing refineries.
Economic conditions have prompted
some companies to delay projects. Even
so, long-term global diesel fuel demand
growth is forecast to continue, giving
some companies incentive to stick with
their plans.
U.S. refiners have been pushed
to retool their plants and maximize
production of diesel fuel, analysts say,
due to rising demand for diesel and the
prospect of future lower gasoline use.
Federally-mandated higher vehicle
corporate average fuel economy
(CAFÉ) standards enacted in 2007
place higher demand for fuel-efficiency
in vehicles and a federal requirement
to increase the amount of ethanol in
the gasoline pool has also been a factor.
The year-to-date strong demand
for diesel versus weakening demand

for gasoline is a key factor in diesel
prices, which have been higher than
gasoline prices in the United States.
U.S. diesel demand has been primarily
in the industrial and commercial
sector, rather than for consumers.
This, however, is likely to change, as
acceptance of Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel
(ULSD) fuel grows and as more diesel
passenger vehicles are introduced.
U.S. demand for highway diesel now

ogies, Inc., says oil companies have
leaned toward adding diesel
production when they have announced
new refinery projects. Announced
projects are focusing on expanding
hydrocracking and coking capacity,
which allows refiners to produce highvalue products like gasoline and diesel
from heavier crude oil. “This bias is in
response to the expected softening in
gasoline demand in the foreseeable
future due to increasing ethanol
mandates and fuel efficiency
standards,” Jacobs says. “Diesel
margins have been strong since 2006
and show no signs of retreating. Diesel
demand is expected to continue the
growth in demand above fossil fuel
based gasoline.”
Based on publically-announced
refinery expansion plans as of March
2008, the U.S. will add about 550,000

barrels per day of incremental coking
capacity and more than 200,000 barrels
a day of hydrocracking capacity, Jacobs
says. He cautions that several of these
projects “could be delayed or canceled
due to recent economic events which
have affected the availability of capital
and have eroded short-term demand.”
Diesel-fueled vehicles have made up
less than five percent of the U.S. lightduty vehicle market. As a result, U.S.
refineries have been configured to
produce more gasoline than diesel.
But, with diesel demand increasing,
U.S. refineries are making huge
investments to increase diesel
production. Many oil companies have
announced refinery expansion and
adjustment plans to increase the
amount of diesel fuel produced.
“Over the past five years, U.S. diesel
demand has been roughly triple the
growth rate of gasoline – three percent
per year, compared with gasoline’s one
percent annually,” notes API refining
issues manager Cindy Schild. While
there has been a reduction in demand
for gasoline so far this year, this has
not been the case with diesel.”
Schild also points out that increased
use of diesel as a transportation fuel in
Europe, where more than half of the
cars run on diesel, has resulted in less
European diesel available for import
into the U.S. At the same time, recordhigh pump prices earlier this year led
to the first ever decline in gasolinefueled vehicle miles traveled in the
U.S. and the first year-on-year decline
in U.S. gasoline demand in 15 years.
A refinery’s ability to process
heavier, higher-sulfur crudes is
governed by its complexity.
The simplest refining technique is
distillation – crude oil is heated and
various products are stripped off as
they reach their boiling points. More
expensive and complex units, like
cokers and hydrotreaters, can squeeze
out a greater volume of cleaner and
higher valued products. U.S. refiners »

are producing record amounts of
diesel to meet growing demand and
capitalize on high diesel margins. Since
2005, diesel prices have been higher
than gasoline prices. According to the
EIA, U.S. refiners increased their
yields of diesel fuel to the highest levels
since the agency began keeping records
in 1993. EIA analyst Joanne Shore says
this summer’s performance underlined
the industry’s determination to crank
out more diesel.
“High distillate margins in the
summer of 2008 provided refiners
with incentives to increase distillate

Shore says the longer-term
fundamental picture seems to justify
refiners taking steps to increase
distillate production versus gasoline
but the level of investment that will
achieve a favorable return is less clear.
She says the EIA sees a significant
shift in demand for petroleum-based
gasoline versus distillate over the
next 15 years because of recent
U.S. legislation.
“While still not the shift that
Europe has seen, U.S. refiners will be
facing a significant change in product
mix from the refinery that will impact

have invested heavily in such units
to comply with federal clean-air
legislation, leaving them better placed
than their counterparts around the
world to run heavier, higher-sulfur
crude. Heavier, or higher density,
grades of crude oil account for about
25 percent of daily global supply, but
some analysts predict that figure could
rise to more than 50 percent by 2030.
“The nature of the crude slate being
processed by U.S. refineries continues
to become heavier and heavier.
Technological advances enable us
to obtain and process heavier crude
slates which was not feasible years ago.
U.S. refineries are some of the most
complex in the world and have the
capability to process heavy crudes,”
API’s Schild says.
This technology also enables
U.S. refiners to maximize their use
of nearby Canadian oil reserves. U.S.
refiners and pipeline operators in the
Midwest and beyond are investing
huge sums to expand and upgrade
refineries to make refined products
from oil derived from Canadian oil
sands and build new infrastructure to
transport more Canadian oil into the
United States. According to consulting
company Wood Mackenzie, pipeline
companies and refiners plan to spend
$31 billion from 2008 through 2015
to expand their capacity to refine and
distribute Canadian oil sands products
in the United States.
Several of the announced projects
are joint ventures with Canadian
interests to share the risks and rewards
of an operation from recovery to retail.
KBC’s Jacobs says, “the Canadian
sources are a strategic feedstock source
for the U.S. refining industry. Most
crude oil sources are located in areas
of the world that historically have
seen periods of political instability,
presenting a real supply risk to the
large capital investments required
to expand refining capacity.”
Even before the planned expansions are completed, U.S. refiners

production. Gasoline margins were
sometimes negative, but distillate
margins were very high. Once it
became evident that this high-margin
distillate picture was going to last
some time, refiners began focusing
on shifting to higher distillate yields
at the expense of gasoline, which was
in surplus supply,” Shore says.
“With the planned hydrocracking
capacity, the U.S. refiners might not
need to do much more to satisfy
U.S. distillate needs and even increase
exports of distillate.”

investments,” Shore says. She noted
that the EIA is predicting that overall
oil demand is not expected to grow
much over the next 30 years – perhaps
less than one-half percent per year
on an annual average while distillate
demand may still grow fairly strongly
as gasoline demand declines. I

A DAY IN THE LIFE | By Robert Dodge

THE MARATH
Meet Richard Bedell, a 30-year oil and natural gas
industry veteran running one of the largest refinery
expansions in the country.

Bedell, age 53, has been here before. Hurricanes have
become a way of life for the manager of Marathon’s Garyville
Refinery. In the last three years he has led his 700 employees
through Hurricanes Katrina and Gustav and watched
nervously as Rita and Ike veered into nearby Texas.
Weathering hurricanes is challenging, but it is just one
part of Bedell’s job. As Garyville’s manager, he also oversees
the refinery’s daily processing of 256,000 barrels of crude »

Richard Bedell, just in from a refinery tour, quickly removes
his hard hat, goggles and blue Marathon jumpsuit so he can
read from the white piece of paper he clutches in one hand.
It’s the latest forecast on Hurricane Gustav. As he reads,
Bedell frowns a bit, realizing the pleasant day outside with
its blue sky and puffy white clouds will soon be swept away.
“Well, there goes the Labor Day weekend,” he says with
a chuckle.

A Vast Expansion. A large refining tower shipped up the Mississippi River to Garyville will be installed at the expanded refinery.

oil. And, if that were not enough, his refinery is in the midst
of a historic $3.0 billion expansion that will make Garyville
the fourth-largest refinery in the nation.
Bedell started his career in the oil and natural gas industry
at Garyville in 1979, less than three years after the facility
opened. He has worked there four times during a 30-year
career that also has included managing roles at three other
Marathon refineries. All these experiences added up to make
him the logical man to lead Marathon’s largest-ever refinery
project.
“This is a fantastic time to be working at the Garyville
refinery,” Bedell says. “This major expansion is a project of
historic size for Marathon and I have the privilege of working
in the middle of it all. Requiring an unprecedented level of
coordination, organization and teamwork, it has been a once
in a lifetime opportunity.”
But right now, Hurricane Gustav is knocking on the door.
It’s the Wednesday before the Labor Day weekend and
thoughts about outdoor barbeques and fishing are replaced
with more urgent hurricane preparations. The forecasts
continue to worsen, and by Saturday afternoon, Gustav
is expected to bring sustained winds of more than 60 miles
per hour and gusts of more than 100 – with conditions
expected to last about 10 hours.

“At noon Saturday, we began shutting down all the units
and by noon on Sunday we were down cold,” Bedell says.
A final check of the refinery was made early Monday morning
and all of Marathon’s on-site employees were sheltered by
7 a.m. to ride out the storm. “We do not have to worry about
a storm surge here, but we do have to worry about the wind
and whether you can have people working safely outside.”
When the winds subsided, the only damage was to some
insulation and some cooling tower damage.
But it would still take until the next Sunday to complete
the restart of the refinery because of widespread power
outages. It also took about five days to account for all of
Garyville’s employees, who also were trying to cope with no
electric power and limited fuel supplies needed to get to work.
Putting Employees First
Just as it did after Katrina, Bedell says Marathon came
to the aid of its employees, providing fuel for commuting
and home generators, as well as hot meals at the refinery.
“We served 6,000 hot meals, cooked and prepared on site,”
Bedell says. “We made sure that we had a hot meal for
everyone who worked days or nights.”
Bedell says Katrina reinforced the value of supporting
employees so they can do their jobs. “We have a very

detailed hurricane plan and it is phased in as the storm
approaches,” Bedell says. By June of each year, the refinery
is stocked with food and water supplies, and on-site crews
have been designated to ride out the storms.
Even so, there was no way to be fully prepared for
Katrina. When the skies cleared, 40 employees had lost their
homes. Marathon quickly rented 30 apartments that were
barely finished, found some rental homes and furniture.
“We could not recover the plant until we first took care of
our employees,” Bedell says. “It was a good thing that the
company did. It was one of those things we had to do on
the fly, but we knew it was the right thing to do.”
The Facts of Expansion
With hurricane season over, Bedell has spent the last quarter
of the year focused on the refinery expansion.The refinery is
located on a 3,500 acre site that was once the San Francisco
Plantation founded in 1856. Not far from the refinery, the
plantation home sits among a stand of live oak trees and
retains much of its original splendor, having been restored

And he has to be. When the expanded facility comes online,
which is scheduled for December 2009, the old and new
facilities will be fully integrated, which required Bedell and
his colleagues to be involved since before groundbreaking.
“It’s my responsibility to make sure we have the people,
the systems and we are ready to run this thing as a seamless
operation,” Bedell says. “We have one organization that has
run the existing refinery and another organization that is
building the new refinery. By next year, it will be one
organization that fits together.”
As construction activities reach their peak, Bedell
says there are more than 5,000 temporary workers on site.
And that figure reveals only part of the manpower needs.
“As the construction moves through different phases we are
bringing in different craftsmen. By the time the project is
finished we will bring over 10,000 different people through
the site,” Bedell says. “We are always doing different crafts
at different times. We have to make sure that they are
working safely and to our standards. It is an enormous
effort because we are moving new people in all the time.”

The expansion is so large that the existing refinery is almost visually
lost to some visitors. The scale of construction appears as if a new
city is underway with its steel superstructure, high cranes, traffic jams
of trucks and mobile equipment, as well as thousands of workers.
by Marathon. The house, which has numerous antiques,
and its adjacent grounds are a National Historic Landmark
and host to daily tours, weddings, concerts, festivals, auto
shows and gumbo cook-offs.
The plantation grounds may be next door but seem
a world away from the refinery.
In fact, the expansion is so large that the existing
refinery is almost visually lost to some visitors. The scale
of construction appears as if a new city is underway with
its steel superstructure, high cranes, traffic jams of trucks
and mobile equipment, as well as thousands of workers.
The stats help illustrate the story: Ten miles of new paved
roads, two miles of structural steel pipe racks, 17,700 piles,
92,000 cubic yards of concrete, 21,000 tons of structural
steel, 300 miles of pipe and 1,000 miles of wire and cable,
just to name some of the materials needed to complete
the expansion.
When the expansion is fully online, it will employ 200
new workers and up to 80 new full-time contract employees.
The added capacity will allow the plant to process an
additional 180,000 barrels of crude oil and increase the
refinery’s capacity to produce low-sulfur diesel.
Indeed, Bedell can spew those facts and figures like
gunfire. He appears as conversant as a construction manager.

The Great Shift Change
The refinery is being built and will come online at a time
when many Baby Boom generation workers are retiring.
Known in the industry as the “great shift change,” the
exodus threatens to drain facilities like Garyville of their
best and most-experienced workers – an unwelcome
trend anytime but worse during a major expansion.
Bedell says he has hired 160 new workers during
the last year, most of whom were under age 30.
“Over the next few years we have a huge group of
people retiring,” says Bedell, noting that many workers
have 30 years of experience. He says the refinery got an
early start on hiring new workers, allowing enough time
for them to be trained at the existing facility and to be
ready when the expansion comes online.
“The refinery has been tasked with building the
workforce that will run the expansion and integrate
it into our existing refinery,” he says.
Safety is Key
Throughout the process, safety is key. Bedell is proud
of Garyville’s safety record and status as an OSHA VPP
Star refinery – the highest honor given to recognize the
most effective industrial safety and health programs by »

the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration.
And, he says, maintaining high
safety standards is key to having a
successful operation. “The drive
for continuous improvement and
excellence in our safety performance
carries through our work culture into
everything we do. That attitude, or
culture, also drives us to excellence
in environmental performance and
operational performance. I don’t think
you will find a refinery that does one
of these things well but not the others.
It all fits together.”

Back to His Roots
It would seem that Bedell, who
returned to Garyville in 2001, has been
preparing to lead the refinery through
the expansion throughout his career.
Even so, he did not start in the oil and
natural gas industry.
After graduating from Lehigh
University in 1977 with a degree in
chemical engineering, Bedell went to
work in product development for a
Philadelphia chemical company. He
soon discovered he would rather have
a hands-on job as a process engineer
and also wanted to get back to the
Gulf Coast where he grew up.

That’s when Bedell’s father, who
worked for ExxonMobil for 41 years,
offered to help. “He said, ‘Give me
some of your resumes and I will give
them to some of the people that I
know,’” Bedell recalls. The resume
made its way to Marathon and Bedell
was hired to work at Garyville just as
the company was bringing online its
first expansion of the three-year-old
facility.
From there, Bedell spent the next
15 years moving up the ranks at
Marathon’s refineries in Texas City,
Robinson, Illinois, and Detroit. He
also spent a short time as a crude oil
trader, and in 1984, earned a master’s
degree in petroleum engineering.
He moved often, working at
some of the refineries more than
once, including Garyville where
he is on his fourth tour.
“It was kind of nuts,” he says,
remembering he once moved three
times in one year. “You get all your
boxes unpacked and it’s time to pack
again. And (state) income taxes are
always fun when you do that. But the
opportunities came up, and each time
they were good opportunities.”
Now, after two hurricanes and the
ongoing expansion, Bedell says it is
hard to remember when he last had a
typical day. But his usual routine is to
arrive at work at 6:30 a.m. Mornings
are filled with meetings, including
daily sessions to monitor the refinery’s
operations and less frequent sessions
that focus on specific projects and
budgets.
About twice a week, he schedules
lunches with groups of 15 to 20
employees to better know the plant’s
workers and get their views. And then
there are his weekly walks – strolls
around the refinery to “get a much
better feel of what is going on.”
On one recent walk, he discovered
the plant had an unwanted visitor.
“One of the guys saw me walking and
asked if I wanted a ride, and then he
asked me if I was out looking for the

alligator. Until then, I did not know
we were trying to catch a seven-foot
alligator in a ditch up on the north
forty.”
On a good day, Bedell leaves his
office at 4:30 p.m., which allows him
just enough time to beat the 5:00 p.m.
quitting time at the construction site
and the resulting traffic jam. But other
days, he will have evening meetings
with local and state community
organizations that keep him working
late. Once home, he has a recently
acquired Blackberry to keep in touch
with the refinery and admits he is
fighting not to become a “Crackberry
addict.”
“I resisted getting one of those for
the longest time. I finally got one this

year and said I would not become
one of those addicts,” he says. “But
I do find myself looking at it during
television commercials.”
Bedell agrees that Garyville seems
like the right place to be. He is happy
to be living in the Gulf Coast region,
although he does not find enough
time to go fishing or sit outside with
his wife and enjoy a glass of wine in
the evening. But there is satisfaction
in having started his career at Garyville
and now being on hand 30 years
later to preside over the refinery’s
expansion.
“I’ve known some of the people
here from when we were young and
played basketball and bowled together
back in the ’70s,” he says. “I have a

great job, and we are doing something
that has never been done in our
company – to the extent that this is
the largest project we have ever had.
And you figure it’s been 30 years since
anyone built a refinery and we are
doing it.”
“So after 30 years I am back, and
we are doing it bigger than we have
ever done it.” I

KEY ENERGY SERVICES’ TECHNOLOGIES CAN EXTEND
A FIELD’S PRODUCTIVE LIFE

W

hether or not commodity prices are
at record high levels, operators are
always sensitive to not only the price of
oil but the cost of the various well services
necessary to extend a ﬁeld’s life.
Bumping up against the above scenario is
the so-called knowledge leak, the challenge
of experienced oil industry employees
retiring faster than new employees can be
hired and trained. This scenario is affecting
all sizes of oil and natural gas companies as
well as service companies. As a result, they
must compensate with new and innovative
technologies and solutions that reduce
manpower requirements and to deploy
industry best practices using fewer and lessexperienced but well trained personnel.
Key Energy Services, the world’s largest
rig-based well services provider, continually
and successfully strives to better serve
its customers’ well servicing needs by
providing the services that extend the life
and value of existing assets and reducing
the frequency of wellsite interventions.
The company’s ongoing commitment
to its customers is demonstrated by its
development of an expanded suite of
comprehensive services that integrate the
newest technologies with the highest safety
and training standards.
Key’s management understands that its
customers ultimately determine its success,
regardless of market conditions. As a
result, the company evolves from the top
down to better serve its customers’ needs.
Recently the company has undergone a
re-organization initiative to ensure that
it has the most qualiﬁed people in every
position, from the Chief Executive to
its ﬁeld personnel. The result is that the
people making decisions within Key, as
well as those carrying out those decisions,
have the knowledge and skills to perform
at optimum levels. This, in turn, results in a
higher level of customer service.
During this reorganization phase,
Key Energy Services created several
marketplaces for which its business
development leaders are charged with
identifying ways to enhance the company’s
contributions to its customers’ projects.

The company’s operations, technical and
sales teams work together, examining
project plans and ﬁscal opportunities to
eliminate unnecessary steps, trim ﬁeld
work teams where possible and increase
efﬁciency while reducing customer costs.

A GROWING AND EVOLVING
COMPANY
Growing both organically and through a
series of strategic acquisitions, the company
provides workover services, electric wireline,
pressure pumping, ﬁshing and rental
services, ﬂuid logistics services and drilling
from 150 locations in the United States,
Mexico and Argentina. Additionally, Key
offers services in Canada and Russia through
its part ownership in well-established service
companies in those countries.
Key Energy Services grew out of The
Yankee Companies, a holding company
with interests in environmental services,
energy and banking. In 1988, The Yankee
Companies’ board decided to re-focus the
company’s strategic plan and concentrate
on the energy services business, divesting
its non-operating companies as a result.
The corporation was rebuilt with its West
Texas well servicing division, Yale E. Key,
as the foundation for the future.
During the next several years, an
aggressive acquisition program led to the

creation of Key Energy Services Inc. The
company’s strategy was to consolidate
the fragmented well services business
by building a strong company with
critical mass and ﬁnancial stability. While
difﬁcult due to the hundreds of small
regional companies at that time, in less
than 10 years Key grew and evolved from
a company with less than 50 working
rigs to the world’s largest rig-based well
services company. Rounding out the plan
to become a total service provider was the
acquisition of Q Services in 2002, which
gave the company a pressure pumping
division and strengthened its position in the
ﬁshing and rental services market.
Key’s growth didn’t stop there, however.
In 2007 the company acquired Moncla
Companies, which operated a ﬂeet of 59
well servicing and workover rigs, including
a ﬂeet of inland water workover barges
as well as other well servicing equipment.
The acquisition allowed the company to
expand its broad array of services to the
offshore market.
Key also acquired Advanced Measurements
Inc. (AMI), which develops technology for
oilﬁeld service equipment instrumentation.
AMI assisted with the development of the
proprietary KeyView® system.
Other 2007 acquisitions included Kings
Oil Tools, a California-based company

Key has deployed coiled tubing units like this one in nearly every active U.S. shale play,
including the Barnett, Marcellus, Bakken and Haynesville shales.

that owned 46 well service rigs and related
support equipment. In 2008, the company
acquired a second California-based well
service company, Western Drilling, with 22
rigs including several used for horizontal
drilling. These acquisitions made Key the
largest well services provider in the state
with over 160 working rigs.
Another important acquisition was
Hydra-Walk Inc, which provides pipe
handling solutions. Key also purchased
a 50% stake in Geostream, a Russian
company that provides drilling and
workover services as well as subsurface
modeling and engineering.
Key Energy Services expects to continue
its growth via additional acquisitions in
the U.S. as well as selectively expanding its
product line to better serve its customers.
Internationally, the company continually
seeks new opportunities and new markets
to introduce its services.

KEY’S COMMITMENT TO SERVICE
Key Energy Services’ business lines
provide the industry with a comprehensive
suite of products and services designed
to serve all facets of oilﬁeld operations.
The wide range of products and services

COMPANY PROFILE
offered to the industry means added
convenience for Key’s customers by
reducing the need for third party vendors.
Customers can depend on Key as their
single source for planned activities as well
as emergencies at the wellsite.
In addition to workovers and general
well servicing, the company’s business
lines include electric wireline for reservoir
mapping, cased-hole logging, perforation
and mechanical wireline. The company
signiﬁcantly expanded this business during
2007 and 2008. Key had been a regional
player in the Appalachian Basin for many
years. In 2006, the company introduced
its wireline services to its Texas-based
operations. Key began 2007 with four new
wireline units and quickly expanded to
16 units by the end of that year. Another
dozen units are expected to be in service by
the end of 2008.
Key also provides pressure pumping

INNOVATIVE KEYVIEW
RIG MONITORING AND
CONTROL SYSTEM
Key Energy Services developed its
KeyView® system, which is comprised
of a network of monitors and controls
integrated into its well servicing rigs. Safety
incidents have been signiﬁcantly reduced
due to improved operational control. Job
quality is improved as a result of operators’
awareness of wellsite conditions. Overall
well servicing efﬁciency is increased due
to minimized downtime, lower periods
of inactivity and longer intervals between
interventions. The result is an improved
bottom line for Key’s customers.
KeyView monitors equipment, rig
operations and rig activity and provides data
in real-time. The data is transmitted from
remote locations to Key’s central database
and is available via a secure website for
viewing by Key personnel and the customer.
Nearly 250 rigs have been deployed with
the KeyView system and more are being
installed on new and existing rigs. KeyView
rigs have experienced better safety, higher
quality performance and better operating
efﬁciency compared with rigs without
KeyVew. For example, KeyView-enabled
rigs have experienced up to 56% fewer safety
incidents. They have improved job quality up
to 63% and increased efﬁciency by reducing
non-productive time by as much as 20%.

with Key, is beginning ﬁeld testing on

COMPANY PROFILE

KeyView is a patented satellite-enabled rig
data capturing system proven to improve job
safety, job quality and job efﬁciency.
the next KeyView generation,” said Dick
Alario, Chairman, President and CEO of
Key Energy Services. “The next iteration
will feature more data gathering capability
and more controls.”
The system utilizes sensors throughout
the rig to monitor and control certain
operating parameters. These include
hookload, engine RPM, block position
and velocity, hydraulic pressure and the
presence of hydrogen sulﬁde (H2S) gas.
Data also is based on rig operator activities
such as circulating, third party rig up/rig
down, pulling out or running pipe into the
hole and crew break.
In certain situations, conditions or
activities may activate safety related
interventions or alarms, enabling rig
operators to respond quickly to such
events. Additionally, the data is time
stamped, allowing later data viewing for
reporting, analysis and rig performance
evaluation.
Safety is one of the most important
features of the system with its crown out/
ﬂoor out prevention. Combined with the
high hookload limiter, the system will
intervene within a fraction of a second after
sensors detect the limits, preventing costly
accidents and errors.

Higher quality performance is achieved
by KeyView in several ways. The system’s
successful joint makeup feature avoids over
torquing tubing or rod connections. Use
of the hookload limiter avoids overpull on
downhole equipment by monitoring gradual
increases in pull until the equipment is freed.
In a Permian Basin well, a downhole tool
string hung up while pulling out of the well.
They operator had the KeyView system
hookload limiter set at 10,000 lbs over the
actual string weight. When the tool string
hung up, the system disengaged the throttle
in 1/50th of a second, preventing the tool
string from parting and saving a $250,000
ﬁshing job.
In another Permian Basin well, a Key
Energy operator observed that progress
was not being made on drilling out a
cement plug. The work string was pulled
and visual inspection revealed that the
bit was missing a cone. Under similar
circumstances, such failures might be
considered the result of incorrect weight on
bit during the drilling process. However,
examination of the KeyView data during
drilling conﬁrmed that the correct weight
on bit was used. The bit supplier veriﬁed
the KeyView data and concluded that the
failure was a bit problem rather than due
to incorrect drilling processes. The bit
supplier provided a replacement bit at no
cost to the operating company.
In 2007, Key was awarded a contract
from PEMEX for production enhancement
services in Mexico utilizing the KeyView
system. Key deployed three of its KeyView
equipped rigs to Mexico and added
the monitoring system to two PEMEX
rigs. The result was almost immediate.
Improved quality of work by enhancing
safety and reducing the typical duration of
PEMEX’s well service jobs translated into
more workovers per rig per year, longer
well equipment life, more predictable
scheduling, less downtime and more
production days.
“We identiﬁed PEMEX’s critical need,
explained to them how Key could ﬁx it
and then proved ourselves,” Mr. Alario
said. “It is every company’s dream to ﬁnd
a company like PEMEX, deploy your
technology, people and resources and
solve a problem.”

PEMEX was so pleased with the results
of the ﬁrst contract that Key was awarded a
second PEMEX contract in 2008. Key will
initially provide four KeyView equipped
well service rigs to PEMEX. Five KeyView
systems were installed on PEMEX owned
well service rigs. The contract gives the
Mexican national oil company an option
for additional rigs and KeyView systems
in the future. It is estimated that Key will
operate more than 20 rigs in Mexico by
mid-2009.
“We are putting a well back on production
for a fraction of the cost of drilling a new
well,” Mr. Alario said. “Depending upon the
job’s requirements, we are bringing the wells
back on in as little as two days. Others may
take a couple of weeks.”

HYDRA-WALK AUTOMATED PIPE
HANDLING SYSTEM
Key Energy Services acquired HydraWalk, Inc. in June 2008 and integrated
the automated pipe handling system
into its product line as an alternative to
manual pipe handling. Hydra-Walk, based
in Oklahoma, operates more than 80
patented pipe handling units in Oklahoma,
Texas and Wyoming. Key intends to ramp
up production and deployment of the pipe
handling system to meet its customers’
needs for such services. The Hydra-Walk
system also can be combined with the
KeyView monitoring and control system,
moving the company further to its goal
of becoming the safest and most efﬁcient
provider of rig-based well services.
“We wanted to move into the pipe
handling business for several reasons,
including better safety, faster operations
and efﬁcient handling of tubulars,” Mr.
Alario explained.
Hydra-Walk automates the pipe
handling process by using a mechanical
arm to lift pipe from the catwalk and
transports them to the rig ﬂoor. Minimizing
human interaction with the pipe increases
safety for wellsite personnel and prevents
damage to pipe. Jobs are completed more
efﬁciently and cost effectively.
Enhanced job quality is achieved by
automating the pipe handling process.
This minimizes the human element that
sometimes leads to improperly stacked

pipe, which in turn can damage the pipe
body, the collar of the threads. The system
preserves the integrity of the pipe joints by
virtually eliminating damage to pipe during
their placement, adding longevity to the life
of the pipe and reducing replacement costs.
Hydra-Walk is available in two different
models to accommodate different ﬂoor
heights. The standard model is capable of
reaching rig ﬂoors up to 21 ft high. For
jobs requiring maximum reach up to 28
ft, the Hydra-Walk System SS model is
especially useful where equipment such as
snubbing units are in use.

Hydra-Walk automates the pipe-handling
process using a mechanical arm to lift pipe
lengths from the catwalk and present
them to the rig ﬂoor.
Among the safety features of the HydraWalk system is its design that allows
control of the unit from the side or with
a wired or wireless remote. This allows
the operator to move and have a clear
view of rig personnel and operations.
Safety pins/laydown arms ensure a safe
transition from pipe racks to the rack unit,
preventing overshoot. The system provides
an automated consistent function for
decreased incidents and downtime.
The Hydra-Walk pipe handling system
can pick up or lay down pipe up to 7 5⁄8-in.

steel and other premium pipe for expanded
applications without the risk of damage
when properly operated. The system’s
versatility means the unit can be installed
on well service and drilling rigs.
Efﬁciency is increased by hydraulic
adjusters that ensure a smooth transition
of pipe from the pipe racks to the HydraWalk system. Portability and size allow for
easy handling of the unit by forklift and
positioning in small spaces or wellsites. Set
up usually takes about 15 minutes.

KEY’S COMMITMENT TO SAFETY
Key’s commitment to place the most
capable employees in every position
requires a selective recruitment process
followed by rigorous training. Training
and maintenance programs are aligned
to ensure that crews and equipment meet
the same superior standards, regardless of
location. Properly trained crews implement
the procedures and best practice that lead
to customer satisfaction.
A Corporate Safety Council comprised
of senior company management conducts
in depth, bi-monthly safety reviews of a
selected division’s operations. The program
has led to the sharing of best practices
company wide, and has resulted in a safety
record that is industry renown.
“The company’s safety record had
improved materially in 2004,” Mr. Alario
said. “We decided to enhance the programs
being used to drive our performance
higher.
“As a result,” he continued, “we reduced
the number of safety incidents by half from
the 2004 level based upon the 200,000 man
hour OSHA calculation that is standard for
our industry.”
A key component of the company’s
safety program is DuPont’s acclaimed
STOP™ process. Additionally, Key has
developed practices in conjunction with
Liberty Mutual Insurance’s Managing Vital
Performance® (MVP) process to identify
tasks that have been high risk and then
to develop task-speciﬁc observations to
address the associated hazards. Combined
with the STOP program, MVP provides a
synergistic, behavior-based safety approach.
Key develops and delivers one of the
most intensive training curricula in the

well services industry. The program is a
balanced blend of skills and safety courses
taught in house by Key instructors in each
of the company’s regions.
“We conduct a lot of in house training
and we also bring in external expertise as
well,” Mr. Alario said. “We use behaviorbased safety training and we spend a lot of
time with our managers in the ﬁeld.”
The classroom training is supplemented
by on the job exercises during which
students wear bright green hard hats to
identify them as novices and to ensure that
they are provided with all of the assistance
they require.
Another of Key’s training innovations is
simulation exercises, and is best evidenced
at facilities such as the Permian Basin
Training School. Students learn to operate
equipment on a fully-equipped and
deployed service rig.

PERFORMANCE IS KEY
Key’s performance is quantiﬁed by ﬁve
established pillars: better people, better
safety, better training, better equipment
and better technology. The primary value
propositions to its customers are to reduce
the overall cost of wellsite interventions
and extend the life and value of existing
assets. Key’s commitment to evolving
oilﬁeld operations for the beneﬁt of
its customers is demonstrated through
the company’s recent acquisitions and
expanded services and technologies.
By establishing a new and heightened
benchmark and level of accountability, Key’s
forward thinking has advanced customer
service not only within its own organization
but for the industry as a whole.

rom the battlefield to the oil field – it’s not such a leap
for returning veterans. The well-trained, adaptive
individuals who have been serving the U.S. overseas are
now being courted by the U.S. oil and gas industry.
A combination of a wave of retirees moving out of the
oil companies, and the incoming wave of veterans made
the decision to recruit them easy. United by the American
Petroleum Institute’s Workforce Task Force, member
companies needing all levels of expertise are reaching out
to veterans with a website, www.veteranstoenergy.org, and
a massive organizational effort aimed at helping both sides
of the equation.

The industry is being hit hard by the retirement of the
77-million baby boom generation, partly because many
companies allow workers to retire as early as age 55. Indeed,
the average age of the industry workforce is 54, and experts
believe at least 50 percent of the current workforce will be
retiring during the next five to 10 years.
During the last big oil boom, companies scooped up as
many employees as they could, says Jim Raney, a member
of the task force. When they ran out of recently graduated
engineers, they hired the professors away from a number
of engineering schools. Schools can’t turn out enough such
graduates to satisfy the need.

“As a member of the military you are taught that you are military
24 hours a day, seven days a week first, and everything else is
second. You come in with a good attitude. You can be put out
on a rig because you’re used to being out in the field and you
have the right frame of reference.”

This will be the third major hiring program developed
with API, according to Denise McCourt, API industry
relations director. Already in place are a Monster.com
effort to attract university students and the Rockies Energy
Workforce Collaborative, a regional group designed to
promote job opportunities in the industry.
It was the Rockies program that McCourt says first
noted veterans as excellent prospects. “They were willing
to relocate, were used to working outdoors under difficult
conditions and understood the discipline required to work
in the industry.”
And there they were, coming back from Iraq and
Afghanistan: Engineers, file clerks, squad leaders, back from
the war and looking at their options. Jim Raney understood
that. A West Point graduate and now retired colonel, Raney
had just signed on at Anadarko when he was deployed to
Afghanistan in 2001.
Raney is the Technology Manager at Anadarko and
was recruited to help work on the hiring program with his
friend Brian Roberts, a senior staffer in Anadarko’s Human
Resources program, who was charged with developing a
plan to recruit vets.
Raney graduated from West Point in 1975, did six years
of active duty and then was in the reserve until 2001. During
that time he worked for Mobil and moved on to Anadarko.
He retired as a colonel in 2005.
Raney says beyond helping veterans make the connection,
he is prepared to help translate the skills the veterans have
into oil and gas language.
Not such a big job for a guy whose previous military
service included keeping Osama bin Laden’s hands off the
supplies of aid sent into Afghanistan in Operation Enduring
Freedom.
Raney recalls how it was when overseas duty time was
ending. “I am a returning vet myself,” he notes. “But I wasn’t
too worried [about coming back to work]; the oil business
was doing well. I didn’t have the same problem as some.

Some working guys had no prospects, or didn’t know
if their company would keep their job open and what
position they’d go back to.”
“There was a lot of anxiety among them and they’d
just done a lot of good!”
Another West Point graduate, Manny Gonzalez, is
currently in charge of Chevron’s Los Alamos Alliance,
which takes new technologies developed for the military
and seeks to find uses for advanced energy solutions.
The idea of recruiting men and women who are leaving
the military is a natural, Gonzalez says. “It’s simple. As a
member of the military you are taught that you are military
24 hours a day, seven days a week first, and everything else
is second. You come in with a good attitude and you can be
put out on a rig and you are used to being out in the field,
you have the right frame of reference. And, by the time you
have left the military, you might have a wife and family and
you’re probably pretty stable.”
Roberts jokes, “Anyone who can lead a platoon, can
lead a crew into work.”
In truth, he says, returning veterans have been schooled
in what’s necessary; they can be expected to be “well-trained
and well-disciplined,” he adds. “And they bring the diversity
of background and thought we increasingly want to work
with.”
Veterans look good to oil, McCourt says, for many
reasons, not the least of which is “they are used to working
in the elements. Used to taking orders, and that’s important
because safety is so important. We see returning veterans
as a tremendous talent pool.”
The website has an arms-wide-open appeal. An
introduction says:
America’s oil and natural gas industry is experiencing
a shortage of people in three areas: exploration and production,
refining, and service and supply. Operators are searching for
drilling engineers, facilities operators, and welders to work on
the 500,000 producing wells and 4,000 oil and natural gas »

they need leadership experience, and many of our veterans
possess those skills.”
McCourt says the site is meant to “emphasize that even
though they may look for jobs and say I’m not trained for
that, their experiences and skills can be translated for a
broad spectrum of opportunity.
All these people are familiar with the roller coaster
business that oil and gas can be, but Gonzalez is convinced
the demand will keep the personnel needs high.
And he urges veterans to think outside the box when
they read job requirements. “If you are trained in basic
engineering, you can do anything. You can switch to
petroleum engineer. I myself am a mechanical engineer.”
He adds regular workers who are not college grads should
also look at the jobs in terms of responsibilities they’ve had.
Brian Roberts explains the other appeal of hiring veterans:
“You know, with previous wars, like Vietnam, soldiers came
home and often didn’t have much to come home to in terms
of employment. And here we have the opportunity to do
something good.” I

platforms operating in U.S. waters. America’s 144 refineries
need electricians, mechanics, and instrumentation professionals.
Drilling contractors, which supply both the drilling rigs and
the crews that search for oil and natural gas both onshore and
offshore, need roustabouts, derrick hands, and equipment
operators.
The website is meant to be a comprehensive guide to all
the work available in the industry, for a “seamless transition”
for the returning veteran.
Raney’s experience with Mobil after the Vietnam war
informs his planning for retraining veterans: After the war
was over, they hired about 60 degreed engineers out of
the military. They were a pay grade lower than petroleum
engineers, but after five years the veterans were retroactively
raised after a relook, he said.
So veterans may have all sorts of skill sets but need some
intervention to make clear what their service amounts to,
Raney says. “They need a chance at the interview,” and
“really need to understand what skills sets they have
attained and give them credit for the attributes. Most
project managers don’t need to have oil field experience,

FEDERAL REPORT | By Jim Ford

TRANSITION OF POWER
The oil and natural gas industry faces challenges as energy issues remain top items
on the nation’s policy agenda.
Imagine it is January 20, 2009.
President Barack Obama and Vice
President Joe Biden take the oath of
office, standing on the West Front of
the Capitol, accompanied by a glowing
Senate Majority Leader and House
Speaker.
The Senate is firmly in the hands
of the Democrats, who may now
have enough votes to cobble together
a 60-vote majority with moderate
Republicans. Ditto for the House,
which has seen the Democratic
majority substantially increase.
From day one of the new
administration and Congress, the oil
and natural gas industry is expected
to face a host of challenges. Anyone
who has followed the legislative policy
battles since the hurricanes of 2005
is familiar with the issues: Proposals
to increase taxes, impose marketplace
restrictions, and legislate onerous
greenhouse gas and other environmental restrictions designed to
diminish the use of oil, natural gas
and refined products, as well as
access to explore and develop on
federal lands, including the Outer
Continental Shelf.
President-elect Obama’s election
victory has put him in a position of real
power at a time when Democrats will
take control of Congress and the White
House for the first time since 1995.
Obama comes to the job with
a mandate for change, and energy
policies are among the top items he
plans to address early in his presidency.
He is expected to have strong support

from House and Senate Democrats,
who feel his coattails gave them their
enlarged majorities.
Congress used this year’s electionyear session to signal its intentions
by proposing a variety of energy
measures. Before lawmakers left
to campaign, they approved, and
President Bush signed, a 10-year,
$8.8 billion tax increase on the oil and
natural gas industry that was tucked
inside the $700 billion emergency
bailout to rescue troubled banks.
The tax increase came in a bundle
of extensions of popular tax breaks
like credits for alternative energy and
research and development. What the
industry lost was a future increase in
the rate of a general manufacturers’
deduction and more favorable
treatment of foreign income. In
addition the legislation increased
the oil spill fund tax that refiners
pay from five cents per barrel of oil
to nine cents in 2017.
Looking ahead to next year,
Obama and Democratic leaders
on Capitol Hill are expected to:
• Push for higher taxes on the
industry to provide tax breaks
for individuals and to promote
renewable energy. Obama supports
a windfall profits tax on the
industry, as do any number of
senators and House members.
But tax hikes could be delayed
if policymakers become concerned
that new taxes would worsen
an already weak economy.

• Decide if they want to re-impose
the ban on drilling on the Outer
Continental Shelf. Lawmakers
decided against extending the
moratoria when they approved
a temporary spending bill before
Congress adjourned in October.
• Resume efforts to draft mandatory
greenhouse gas emissions limits.
Legislation is expected that would
cap emissions at a certain level and
then allow the purchase and trading
of emissions allowances by affected
facilities, including a host of oil and
natural gas industry operations.
Obama will come to office having
campaigned in favor of very
restrictive “cap and trade”
legislation. But economic conditions
could force lawmakers to hold off
or take a slower approach on any
greenhouse legislation.
The industry will be arguing that
a windfall profits tax and other tax
increases will harm energy security and
the economy by removing capital that
otherwise could be used to expand
domestic oil and natural gas
production.
API, its member companies and
other allies will be working vigorously
throughout 2009 to find opportunities
to advance the industry’s issues agenda.
There will be an equal effort to defeat
initiatives that could undermine the
nation’s energy security and make
less energy available to American
consumers and businesses. I

STATE OUTLOOK | By Juan R. Palomo

BEYONDTHE BELTWAY
For decades most energy-related legislative activity took place in
Washington. Today, we’re seeing more and more energy legislation
originating outside the nation’s capital.
State legislatures in a number of states are expected to
consider legislation in the following areas next year:
Taxes
All but one state, Vermont, are required to adopt a balanced
budget. With the economy suffering, tax revenues are
expected to be down because most states rely on property
taxes for income. So many states will have to come up with
revenue to pay for all their proposed spending and some
may look to oil companies for that revenue.
Climate Change
Many environmental activists are becoming increasingly
disenchanted with the inability of Congress to address
global climate issues. They are turning to the states instead.
In many cases, it is California that is taking the lead, as it
did when it adopted its low-carbon fuel standards and its
attempt to limit greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles.
Other states with strong environmental communities are
often motivated to follow that state’s lead. More and more
states are forming regional alliances such as the Regional
Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the Northeast and the
Western Climate Initiative, with the goal of reducing
greenhouse gas emissions by a certain date.

Fuels
A number of states are expected to be pressured by
jobbers – wholesalers who buy gasoline for resale to
retailers – who want the states to force refiners to sell
them both gasoline that has been blended with additives
(to meet clean-air requirements) and unblended gasoline,
which they can blend with the additives themselves.
Retail Marketing
In some states, dealer organizations are pressing for
legislation that would grant dealers the right of first
refusal when companies sell their stations in the state.
Companies are opposed to this legislation because
it restricts their ability to sell multiple stations to a
single buyer. I

Under the Dome. State capitols like
this one are expected to see more
and more energy legislation.

OFFSHORE OPERATORS CHOOSING CIR CABLE OVER METAL-CLAD VARIETY

A

s drilling and production technology
evolves, the oil and gas industry
demands innovative, next-generation
cable products that provide reliable
performance, greater worker safety, and
lower cost installation.
AmerCable’s CIR® (Crush & Impact
Resistant) cable is a revolutionary cable
technology that delivers added safety,
productivity and lower total installed
costs, while offering a true alternative to
old fashioned MC (metal clad) cables.
AmerCable’s CIR cable is crush and
impact resistant without external armoring,
yet passes the same stringent crush and
impact testing required by UL 2225 for
Type MCHL.
CIR power, control and instrumentation
cables are ﬂame retardant (IEEE 1202)
and impervious to water, air, gas and
vapors while having a 40% smaller bend
radius and up to 35% less tray ﬁll than
type MC cable. AmerCable’s exclusive
Gexol® insulating compound provides

superior ﬂexibility, dielectric properties
and ﬁeld-proven performance in the most
unforgiving operating environments.
Additionally, CIR cable is ergonomically
superior to MC cable and much safer to
handle. The smooth, ﬂexible CIR jacket
eliminates the sharp edges encountered
by personnel during type MC cable
installation, glanding and termination, as
well as during splicing. These qualities also
help reduce the potential for sustaining
repetitive strain injuries to cable handlers,
which are costly and result in lower
worker productivity. Such injuries include
lower back strains and sprains, lateral
epicondylitis (tennis elbow), and carpal
tunnel syndrome, among others.

COST SAVINGS ABOUND
According to Rudy Bright, technical
director for AmerCable’s Oil and Gas Unit,
customers beneﬁt from a lower installed
cost by specifying CIR over type MC cable.
In a recently conducted cost comparison

Crush and impact resistant CIR cable’s smooth jacket, superior ﬂexibility and lower overall installation
costs make it the new favorite for oil and gas companies looking for innovative cable solutions.

test using 100 ft of each of ﬁve different
cable assemblies, each with two glands, the
installation and labor costs using CIR were
reduced by as much as 36% from those of
similar MC cable assemblies.
“It takes only one tool – a knife – to
prepare CIR cable for installation,” said
Bright. “And in addition to its superior
ﬂexibility, CIR glands cost up to 50% less
than metal clad glands, and take up to 30%
less time to install.”
What’s more, he noted, referring to
resistance to outside contaminants and
wear, CIR’s jacket cannot be damaged
even by routine sand-blasting, a common
practice in cleaning and preparing metal
surfaces for re-coating or painting.
“Try that with meal-clad cable runs and
see what happens,” he said.

FAST, PROMPT DELIVERY
AmerCable works in partnership with
customers to develop cost effective cable
solutions. As the cable industry leader
in shortest lead times and best on-time
delivery – AmerCable adds value through
reliable, innovative cable products and
predictable delivery for new build or
renovation projects across the globe.
AmerCable Systems, the company’s
engineered assembly unit, designs and turnkeys cable assembly solutions for hazardous
oil and gas environments. With the
overall shortage of qualiﬁed electricians,
assemblies are an effective way to lower
overall connectivity costs.

ONE ON ONE | With Robert Bryce | By Martha Liebrum

DANGEROUS
DELUSIONS
Author Robert Bryce takes a sledgehammer to the idea of America’s
energy independence. He thinks it’s impossible.

You heard it before and
during the election season.
Now you’re hearing it again:
The U.S. needs to achieve
“energy independence.”
Every politician says so. And
the public, recognizing that
oil reserves often are in
unstable political hot spots,
thinks it is a good idea to
be less reliant on overseas
sources. But energy writer
Robert Bryce says that’s an
impossible, even dumb, idea.
He documents why in his
book Gusher of Lies, The Dangerous Delusions of “Energy
Independence.” Bryce doesn’t take a gentle approach to this
concept of eventual independence. In fact, he bashes it with
a sledgehammer, in a surprisingly interesting fact-filled 300
pages. Most people, he notes, would be amazed at how many
very essential items, besides oil, the U.S. imports from all
over the world. There’s arsenic (for pesticides) from China
and Mexico, mica (for paint and cement) from India and
Germany and uranium (nuclear reactors) from Australia,
Canada, Russia and Kazakhstan, among others.
His point: This is an international economy and the U.S.
is thoroughly enmeshed in the world market for the current
source of energy, oil and gas. And it’s not possible in the next
few decades to reach “independence,” even if we want to –
and Bryce doesn’t. He is a believer in most alternative fuel

efforts (he has solar panels on his Austin, Texas, house). But
it does not supply his home at all times with all the energy
he needs, nor will it in the foreseeable future, he says. Bryce,
who was a featured speaker at the API annual meeting in
October, expanded on his book for Insight:
When the presidential campaign was waging full tilt, every
candidate called for “energy independence.” Is it rhetoric
or do you think the politicians really believe it’s possible.
Rhetoric? Of course it is. Anyone who has even the
vaguest understanding of the size and scope of the global
energy market knows that energy independence is not
doable. Look at the world’s most energy-rich countries:
Saudi Arabia, Iran, Russia – none of them are energy
independent. And yet, Obama, McCain, Pelosi, Clinton –
and even Paris Hilton – are saying we should be energy
independent. It’s just dumb. The idea that the U.S.,
the world’s single-biggest energy consumer, could be
independent of the world’s single-biggest business, the
$6 trillion per year energy business, is ludicrous on its face.
This political season spawned some of the silliest political
posturing that I have ever seen. Few people – very few –
understand the energy business or energy in general, so
politicians are free to demagogue on the subject without
fear of contradiction. As the Cato Institute’s Jerry Taylor
and Peter Van Doren wrote in May 2007, “Once the topic
of conversation turns to oil, the human brain spontaneously
short-circuits, nodal synapses fire randomly, and I.Q. points
bleed out of the cranium and all over the kitchen floor.”
They were absolutely right.

You favor increased U.S. domestic production. How can
that best be accomplished?
The answer here is obvious: Increase offshore exploration
and production. The claims by the Democrats and the
Green/Left that there’s not very much oil offshore are just
plain dumb. The biggest discoveries of the past few years
have been offshore, look at the Jack discovery in the Gulf
of Mexico in 2006 or the Tupi discovery offshore Brazil
last year. There is a lot – a whole lot – of oil and gas in U.S.
waters. We just need to let private industry start looking
for it. It will take a while, probably a decade or more to
develop those resources, so we need to get busy.
When the government restricts access for exploration,
it’s most often because of environmental concerns. What
do you see as a logical way to balance access for oil or
gas exploration and preservation of natural resources?
When it comes to offshore drilling, I think the oil
and gas industry has a pretty good environmental record,
particularly over the last few years. Thus, I think most
offshore areas under federal control should be opened up
to leasing. Sure there will be environmental risks that come
with that exploration and production. But when it comes
to energy, there’s no such thing as a free lunch.
In your chapter on possible solutions, you give first
place to getting government out of the energy business.
How do you see that happening?
Alas, I don’t see it happening. For the last few decades,
Congress has been trying to pick winners in the energy field
and it continues to fail miserably at that.

“Anyone who has even the vaguest
understanding of the size and scope
of the global energy market knows
that energy independence is not
doable.”
Americans were running out of whales for oil to light our
homes when someone found oil underground. Do you
foresee a time when someone will discover something now
unknown that will make oil, gas, coal, wind turbines, solar
panels and thermal-heated driveways an antique concept?
Perhaps. But I am convinced that no matter how much
money is thrown into the alternative energy sector, the world
is going to continue using fossil fuels for a long time to come.
As Vaclav Smil, a distinguished professor of geography at
the University of Manitoba and a real savvy voice on energy
issues has said, energy transitions are “deliberate, protracted
affairs.” That’s absolutely true. We are going to be using coal,
natural gas, and oil for decades to come. That said, I am
hopeful – and history is showing – that we will continue
moving toward fuels that use less carbon. I’m very bullish
on nuclear and natural gas in particular. Solar and wind will
continue to be players, but unless or until we can come up
with viable systems that can store lots of electricity, I think
they will be niche players. Beyond that, who knows? The
energy business is ruthlessly policed by the immutable laws
of thermodynamics. And those laws have snuffed out many
promising ideas. I

You say people should be motivated to restrict their driving,
but you live in Texas, where spaces are vast and mass transit
isn’t a serious alternative. What’s the solution?
I think you misapprehend my position. I have written many
times that the only thing that will make Americans drive less is
higher fuel prices. And that’s what we are seeing today. As for
the solution, it’s obvious: Higher fuel prices mean that drivers
are going to have to drive less, opt for more efficient vehicles,
and seek other alternatives, if they have them. I’m not suggesting that any of that will be easy or cheap. It’s going to be hard
and expensive and in the coming years, as oil becomes more
expensive – and I think that in about a decade, it surely will –
the transition to other fuels, whether it is electricity or natural
gas or something else, is going to be protracted and painful.

Many of our meetings and conferences offer excellent sponsorship and exhibit opportunities. Laura Barcaskey of Durable Mecco said of one
API conference: “It was a well spent three-days to get better acquainted with the key industry leaders of your industry, and to learn more about
the application of our products in the oil industry. As with most industries today, markings for traceability is a key topic, and technology is
allowing data to be captured in new ways in heavy applications such as down-hole drilling and those subject to harsh environments/processes.
We, at Durable Mecco, look forward to strengthening our relationship with API to handle their diverse markeing and identification needs.”

TIPRO history:
The stories of the independent
producers and royalty owners

Humble Beginnings

W

hile the legal beginning of TIPRO starts in
1946, its philosophical origins predate that
event. To understand the dynamic of the premier association for independents, one has
to understand how oil came to be king in Texas.
One by one the great oil ﬁelds of Texas were discovered: Spindletop in Beaumont in 1901; Burkburnett in North Texas in 1915; Luling in Central
Texas in 1924; Santa Rita – the strike that funded
the Texas university systems for a century - in the
West Texas Permian Basin in 1923; Amarillo in the
Panhandle in 1926, and more.
Circumstances in each ﬁeld raised speciﬁc conﬂicts
between independents and the majors. Often, the issues
involved the majors’ reluctance to invest in the risky and
expensive exploration phase but then swoop in after a
discovery and use various methods to corner the ﬁeld’s
supply and distribution. These behaviors contributed to
the 1880’s anti-trust legislation against Standard Oil and
the formal break-up of the trust into the Seven Sisters in
1911. These companies, however, often continued such
business practices.
The most dramatic and signiﬁcant example of this was
the world-famous East Texas Field. Discovered during
the Great Depression,
hundreds of farmers,
share croppers and all
manner of workers toiled
for little or no pay in
exchange for royalties if
anything materialized.
Many majors thought it
was a fool’s errand.
Early wildcatters had
to endure the most
tumultuous working
conditions

2

Then the Daisy Bradford hit in 1930. Overnight hundreds of regular citizens became royalty owners. In no
other place in the world were so many regular citizens
such large, private owners of a precious national resource.
The largest reserve discovery in the world at that time,
the 600 derricks in Kilgore in 1935 alone signaled
the presence of almost as many wells as the town
had people in 1930! (Lawrence Goodwyn Texas
Oil, American Dreams1, p.53.) This discovery also
made the Texas Railroad Commission the most
inﬂuential governing body for global oil prices.
But such a signiﬁcant supply also had a quick and
devastating impact on global oil prices, sending them
plummeting due to overproduction and theft and raising
the ire of the majors. They lobbied hard at both state and
federal levels for proration limits and other measures to
reduce the ﬂood of supply. Seeing this massive threat to
their livelihoods in what had become a very personal
business, many independents resisted such measures, especially those dictated by the Railroad Commissioners in
Austin. In 1931, martial law was actually declared in East
Texas with National Guard troops sent out by Governor
Ross S. Sterling to enforce the limits.
Against this backdrop, independent producers began
organizing. Regional groups formed in each signiﬁcant ﬁeld in Texas. The East Texas ﬁeld gave rise to the
Independent Petroleum Association of Texas in 1933,
the group that would later reconstitute itself as TIPRO in
1946. (Goodwyn, p.51.)

The War Years: Oil
In his book Texas Oil, American Dreams, which places
the founding of TIPRO into the political context, Goodwyn states, “The event that caused Texas oilmen to take
notice was the public surfacing in 1943-44 of the AngloAmerican Petroleum Agreement.(Goodwyn, p 58)
“One of the key conclusions of the agreement was
that ‘American security required restraint on the use of

domestic reserves and larger drafts
on foreign oil supplies,’” he wrote.
(Goodwyn, p 59)
Houston oilman Glenn McCarthy
brought a group of independent producers together to assure the U.S.
government understood the agreement’s implications to the American
oil and gas industry. The independent oilmen became an important
force in sidelining the treaty.
These operators learned that there
was no one clear voice representing independents. Consequently,
the Texas Independent Producers
and Royalty Owners Association
(TIPRO) was established in 1946 by
a group of 39 Texas wildcatters led
by McCarthy and Jack Porter, who
was the organization’s ﬁrst president.

gas. Though it would take the next
half century for natural gas to mature
into its own, the early seeds of conﬂict
were sewn in the late 1940s.
For years, small independents
signed long-term natural gas contracts for pennies as an oil by-product. Once the demand and corresponding value increased, they were
anxious to revisit such contracts. The
majors and their pipeline subsidiaries were less than anxious, however.
Because the distribution systems in
many areas amounted to monopolies,
and monopolies using taxpayer-funded infrastructure, no less, the dispute
over regulation had begun.

Two generations of TIPRO
presidents

The War Years: Natural Gas
Just as the outcomes of WWII began
disputes for independents over oil
that was supposed to last a generation, it also sparked new battle lines
with majors over natural gas.
Natural gas was largely considered
a by-product to be ﬂared off during
the early days of the oil industry.
That changed as its value was realized and technology provided more
efﬁcient means of transportation,
storage and distribution. But, as
with everything in this industry, they
were all extremely expensive, longterm, large-scale and risky endeavors. Enter Uncle Sam.
During the war, getting essential
supplies like oil to the industrial
north was becoming disrupted and
risky due to the increases in German
U-boat patrols near the U.S. The government, corporations and others realized massive investment in pipeline
infrastructure was needed in conjunction with a huge investment for the
Houston Ship Channel itself. This was
essential to America’s war effort.
After the war, this lasting infrastructure created a new market for natural

but the association also works at the
federal level. The organization provides representation in the legislative
process when bills that impact the industry are debated in the legislature.
TIPRO continues to work for its
membership that has grown to include not only independent producers and royalty owners, but many
other industry related-companies
with a common interest. Many of
TIPRO’s members bring their own
history to the group. Many of the
association’s recent presidents also
have parents that were active in the
organization and previously served
as president of the Association.

With some signiﬁcant milestones,
natural gas regulation was largely secondary to the numerous oil issues until
the 1990s. However, it would jump to
the forefront early in the 21st century
as Enron became the new equivalent
of the previous century’s Standard Oil,
and the world’s appetite for cleaner
burning fuel seemed insatiable.
Since its humble beginnings,
TIPRO has grown into the largest
statewide association of its kind in
the nation. It has led efforts for fairness and representation for independent producers and royalty owners
for more than 60 years. TIPRO’s focus
has primarily concentrated in Texas,

TIPRO’s immediate past president,
Scott L. Anderson, who held the
position from July 2006 until July
2008, is the son of past TIPRO
president, Bruce Anderson, who
served from 1983-1985. Bruce
Anderson was active in TIPRO since
the 1960s. He founded Anderson
Oil in 1949 in Casper, Wyoming,
moving to Denver eight years later.
“With incredible foresight, in 1965
he felt he needed to move the company to Houston because he thought
Houston was going to become the
energy capital,” Anderson said.
Bruce joined TIPRO a short
time after the company moved to
Houston. By this time, the privatelyowned company had production in
several states. Today, the company
produces in 14 states.
Scott Anderson began working
at the family business when he was
in the sixth grade, working during
the summer digging ditches, and
working with gaugers and pumpers

“My father had some health problems,” Scott explained, “So I went
to work for Anderson Oil in January
1981.” Bruce passed away in 2001.
Scott became more involved with
TIPRO, joining several committees
and eventually being elected president.
“This industry has been very good
to our family,” Scott said, “but things
don’t happen by themselves. There
has to be people who take proactive
stances on issues and make sure that
this continues to be a good business.
“We are very fortunate to live in
Texas, where a lot of regulators and
legislators know the importance of
the energy industry,” he continued,
“but so many times people pass
regulations and laws that can hamper the industry.”
“That’s why you need to have an
active lobbying arm to promote
the industry,” Anderson continued,
“and make sure people are aware of
the consequences of legislation and
regulations.”
TIPRO members traveled to
Washington, D.C. twice during
Scott’s presidency to visit the Texas
Congressional delegation.
“We provide a good source of
information for them to be able to
support the positions we need them
to take,” Scott said.
In Texas, TIPRO has been active
during the urbanization of E&P
activity, notably in the Barnett Shale
play around Fort Worth. “TIPRO
and its members have been present and participated and supported
the companies at meetings in those
areas, such as at water district meetings,” Scott explained.

A quarter century
as TIPRO Treasurer
Bennie Downing, a CPA in Austin, is
TIPRO’s immediate past treasurer, a
position he held for more than a quarter century, ending on June 30, 2008.
He’s been a TIRPO member since

4

1977, shortly after he became a royalty
owner. “The ﬁrst meeting I attended
was in the Gondolier Hotel in Austin,
and Texas Governor Dolph Briscoe
came into the meeting,” Downing
said. “It was a small meeting, maybe
30 or 40 people but it was impressive
when you have the governor come in
and carry the day for you.”
“In the mid-1970s the Federal
government implemented the windfall proﬁts tax as a result of high oil
prices and resulting high oil company
proﬁts. That became a tremendous
opportunity for royalty owners to
become involved and we eventually
received a tax credit,” Downing said.
“TIPRO had a major role in
obtaining that credit for the royalty
owners. That is one of the beneﬁts of
becoming a TIPRO member.
“Frank Pitts (later to become
TIPRO’s president from 1980-81)
was a great speaker and traveled
around the state talking about the
tax,” Downing continued. “We also
went to Washington, D. C. in 1977
to talk with and lobby our Senators
and Representatives. It was a challenging time for the oil and natural
gas industry during the Carter Administration, Downing said. “History
was made when President Carter
froze natural gas prices, and then
de-regulation of natural gas from
wells below 15,000 ft.”
As a result of numerous classiﬁcations of natural gas, all with different
prices, TIPRO implemented special
programs for royalty owners from
how to prepare leases, accounting
procedures, setting up accounting
books, and other related topics.
“It was a great program, and very
well attended,” Downing recalled.

40 years separate father
and son TIPRO presidents
Joe Abel, president of M.D. Abel
Company, was president of TIPRO
from 2002-2004. His father, M. D.

Abel, who founded the company in
1961, was TIPRO’s president from
1964-66. Joe began working for his
father in 1976, with the company’s
primary focus in south Texas and
non-operated interests in west Texas,
plus mineral interests in more than
50 Texas counties.
“TIPRO works for me by working with the state legislature and
representing us in the regulatory
process,” Abel said. “It’s like a voice
in the wilderness bringing some
reasoning to the public about the oil
and gas industry.”
M. D. Abel testiﬁed on natural gas
pricing for two weeks in the mid1960s in front of the Federal Power
Commission (FPC), predecessor of
the Department of Energy (DOE).
“TIPRO was trying to raise the price
of natural gas from a nickel to 12
cents,” Abel explained. “They were
trying to increase the market potential
for natural gas and needed a better
price in order to put in the infrastructure to transport the gas to market.”
When Joe Abel became involved
with TIPRO in 1996, the Texas
Railroad Commission (RRC) and the
public were concerned with orphaned
and unplugged wells. “The Oilﬁeld
Cleanup Fund had been in place for
more than 10 years but the industry
was being accused of not devoting
enough money to the effort and plugging enough wells,” Abel said.
Joe Abel, Rusty Howell with
Howell Oil & Gas, Doug Robinson
with Henry Petroleum and Obie
O’Brien, then a lobbyist for Apache,
represented TIPRO in a joint effort
with Texas Oil & Gas Association
to increase funding of the Oilﬁeld
Cleanup Fund. “We spent a lot of
hours and several years to the funding effort,” Abel said.
“We also established the Oilﬁeld
Cleanup Advisory Committee,” Abel
explained. Increasing oil industry
funding for the Oilﬁeld Cleanup

Fund wasn’t easy. Controlled by the
RRC, which is responsible for assuring that wells are plugged, the fund is
supported by the industry from fees
and taxes on natural gas and oil sold.
The major oil and gas companies
wanted the entire increased funding
to come from fees. Smaller companies believed the only equitable way
to come up with increased funding
was from sales.
“TIPRO worked with other associations, developed a compromise and
then worked through the legislative
process to attain a process that has
worked very well,” Abel said.
Another recent issue with which
TIPRO worked for independent
oilmen is storm water runoff. Site
preparations at oil and gas proper-

ties are not covered by permitting
requirements for storm water runoff.
First, the Environmental Protection
Agency attempted to regulate these
sites without a change in the law
from Congress. TIPRO initiated a
lawsuit to continue the correct interpretation of the law.
“Without the exemption, industry
would need a permit before the operator could receive a drilling permit anywhere in the U.S,” commented Abel.
“TIPRO envisioned a 1-2 year
Federal permitting process,” Abel
continued, “and we could lose our
oil and gas lease while waiting on
the Federal government to approve
our storm water runoff plans.
“Our current President, Tad Mayﬁeld, took up the initiative on that

issue,” stated Abel. “After that was
settled and we agreed on EPA’s new
rules, an environmental group sued
EPA over them.” TIPRO has continued to be involved in the case now
defending the revised rules.
Abel remains very active in
TIPRO. “With TIPRO, you build relationships with different individuals
that you meet,” Abel said. “We are
all facing the same kind of problems
and we address them.
“I still get called from time to time
to testify at legislative committees,
depending upon what kind of expertise TIPRO requires.”

TIPRO

proactively represents
the industry’s interests

T

IPRO’s full-time professional staff actively lobbies
at the state and federal levels, providing Texas
independent producers and royalty owners representation in the legislative and regulatory process
when bills and rules that impact the industry are being
debated. The organization has two registered lobbyists on
staff. The organization’s State Issues Committee and Federal Issues Committee follow all relevant bills and rules
through the legislative process, from drafting to voting,
should the proposed legislation reach that stage.
While TIPRO is primarily involved with Texas state
issues, it sometimes is engaged in Federal regulatory and
legislative issues. “Our main focus is at the state level,”
said Donna Warndof, TIPRO’s Director of Public Affairs
and one of the association’s registered lobbyists. “When
there are federal issues where we feel we can make a difference, we become engaged in that process.
“Examples of federal regulations where we became
involved have included stormwater rules and certain
pipeline regulations,” Warndof added.
TIPRO sometimes works with city councils and other
local government agencies, and that is something that
may increase in the future as the industry in Texas
becomes more urbanized. What TIPRO typically does
rather than send an association staff member to a local
water district board meeting in Tarrant County, for example, is to contact a TIPRO member who lives in that
district to attend the meeting.
“We can bring our expertise to the table,” Warndof
said, “but nothing is more helpful than policy makers
hearing from someone that lives and votes where the
issues are.”
TIPRO also calls on the expertise of its members when
working with the state legislature. For example, if an
owner of a company in Corpus Christi has an interest in
a bill that affects his company, TIPRO staff may ask him
to meet with area legislators to help explain how a particular bill affects his company. The same process is used
for whatever part of the state is affected by a particular

6

bill or amendment to a bill, whether it is west Texas, east
Texas, south Texas, etc.
“If a Senator from west Texas is promoting a bill, then
we might request that a TIPRO member or even a State
Issues Committee member who is from west Texas go
to the Senator as one of his constituents and discuss the
bill. Whether we like it or we oppose it, having a local
connection puts a face on the issue for the Senator,” said
Lindsey Dingmore, Manager of Government and Regulatory Affairs for XTO and TIPRO’s State Issues Committee
Chairman.
In another example, TIPRO’s State Issue Committee
will look at a bill in the legislature and note that it is an
issue primarily affecting east Texas. In that instance, the
committee will examine TIPRO’s membership and determine that there is a producer in Tyler, for example, who
probably is the best person to address the issues with a
particular legislator.
In this case, a TIPRO staff member will contact the
producer, explain the issues and TIPRO’s concerns and
determine if the producer has the same concerns. “Nine
times out of ten the member thanks TIPRO for ﬂagging the issue for him and asks what he can do to help
TIPRO,” Dingmore said.
“Sometimes we ask the producer to testify on a piece
of legislation,” Dingmore explained. “Other times it’s
knocking on a legislator’s door and asking if he can
speak with him about the legislation.
“If TIPRO supports the bill, we can offer the legislator any assistance he may want us to help pass the bill,”
Dingmore said. “If we oppose the bill or a section of the
bill, we can say, ‘We see what you are trying to accomplish but here are our concerns.’”

Member-driven legislative agenda
The legislative lobbying efforts and agenda that TIPRO
pursues is member-driven. In addition to the organization’s professional staff that follows a bill’s progress, TIPRO constantly receives input from its general

L e g i s l a t i v e

membership regarding pending
legislation that affects them. For
example, a member might contact
TIPRO about a bill he hears about
and wants to make sure that TIPRO
is aware of it, or he wants to know
what TIPRO is doing regarding the
potential legislation.
“That’s one method to assure that
we are pursuing the message for
TIPRO members,” Dingmore said.
Additionally, the committee depends on TIPRO staff to cull through
the bills and ﬂag potential concerns.
Usually the professional staff knows
there are concerns with a particular bill but other times they may
want to talk with members about
how a bill might affect them or the
industry. The staff then reports to
the committee, which reports to
the association’s Board of Directors.
Additionally, TIPRO reports on the

committee’s actions in the Target, the
twice-monthly member newsletter.

TIPRO works for its members
The Texas legislature is in session
only 140 days every other year
but TIPRO’s professional staff, like
Texas legislators, don’t vacation
during the interim. “The legislature’s
committees meet regularly during
the interim,” Dingmore said. “They
have charges given to them by the
Speaker of the House and the Lt.
Governor and they study a number
of issues during that process.
“TIPRO staff attends those committee hearings and we are anticipating legislation,” Dingmore said.
As a bill moves through the
legislative process, TIPRO will be
very much engaged in a discussion
to amend it should it be detrimental
to the industry. “That is very much

E f f o r t s

a part of the legislative process, and
TIPRO’s registered lobbyists become
very engaged in that process,” Dingmore explained.
During the interim between sessions, the committee meets on an
as-needed basis that could include
meetings in Austin or via conference
calls. During legislative sessions,
members of the State Issues Committee typically meet weekly in
conference calls or in face-to-face
meetings, discussing the legislative
action during the week and receiving input from committee members.
Committee members represent
many of the disciplines necessary
to understand potential legislation
and its impact to the independent
oil and gas operators and royalty
owners. For example, one committee member is a tax expert and can
advise the committee if a tax issue

E f f o r t s

arises. Other committee members
offer additional expertise.
It is a misnomer that lobbying is
always an adversarial process. While
it can be, that is not usually the case.
There are legislators that understand
the exploration and production
business very well and realize that
TIPRO wants to be engaged in the
legislative process. On the other
hand, there also are legislators who
may not understand the industry as
well but who want TIPRO’s input
when they sponsor legislation. Most
often, legislators want to address a
particular issue in the best practical
way and not to be detrimental to the
production of oil and natural gas in
the State of Texas.
“We have those discussions with
legislators all the time,” Dingmore
explained. “That is the real value of
an association like TIPRO, both to
its members and to the legislature,
to be that voice that can credibly
come to the table and suggest workable ways to pass bills.”
In addition to legislators seeking
advice from TIPRO, the association regularly seeks out legislative
committee members and committee
chairmen to provide them regular
brieﬁngs on the state of the oil and
gas industry or on a particular issue.

Thousands of pieces
of legislation to vet
There can easily be up to 5,000
pieces of legislation offered during
a legislative session. As a result, the
State Issues Committee depends
upon TIPRO staff to read through
the bills and to ﬂag those that could
contain potential concerns to TIPRO
members and the industry. Each of
the bills contains a subject line so in
many cases it’s just a matter of reviewing the subject to learn if it affects the
exploration and production sector.
“If the subject line refers to the
board of cosmetology, it’s obviously

8

not going to be a bill with which we
will be concerned,” Dingmore said.
“But there could be a bill that deals
with road infrastructure and deep in
that bill could be a section that levies
an additional tax or fee on oil and
gas-related vehicles on state roads.
“In that case, we will examine the
bill and learn what the legislator is
proposing,” Dingmore added.

As a result, the actual number of
bills that TIPRO staff and lobbyists
work with each session could be
several hundred, sometimes as many
as 1,000 or more. TIPRO maintains
a tracking list that follows each bill
through every step of the legislative
process. The reason is that a bill that
is read as it was introduced, and
deemed good for the oil and gas industry, can be amended by another
legislator and reverse the impact for
TIPRO members
“We follow the bills through the
committee process, including having
a TIPRO staff member at the committee hearings, to assure that an amendment detrimental to the industry isn’t
attached,” Dingmore explained.

As the bills progress, TIPRO staff
discusses the bill or amendments
with the sponsors. This includes the
bills the organization supports as
well as opposes. TIPRO staff typically sends a message to the sponsors of the bills it supports, outlining
the reasons for its support. This also
is a method of registering the association’s support for the bill.
“Many of the sponsors will know
that TIPRO has an interest in their
bill because it deals with the oil
and gas industry,” Dingmore noted,
“but some legislators may not know
about our interest. Being an effective
voice for the industry means clearly
telling our story, even if we disagree
with the sponsor.
“Also, if there is an amendment
to the bill that we might oppose, it
is important to quickly visit with
the bill’s sponsor and discuss that
amendment.”
It can be a complex process and
could seem overwhelming to the legislative outsider. That’s where TIPRO’s
professional staff and registered lobbyists come in. It’s a grueling process for
the staff 140 days every other year. The
truth is, it would be a difﬁcult task to
accomplish what they do 12 months of
the year, every year, but that, in effect,
is what the organization’s professional
staff does. After all, as noted earlier, the
legislative process doesn’t shut down
for 18 months between sessions.

TIPRO develops legislation
While TIPRO’s professional staff and
lobbyist track bills and engage their
sponsors in support or opposition.
TIPRO also develops legislative proposals. Only members of the House
of Representatives and Senate can
actually introduce legislation. If the
association has identiﬁed a problem
that it thinks needs to be addresses,
TIPRO staff will visit with a member
of the legislature or interested stakeholders to develop proposals.

Dingmore explains, “We will lay
out our issue to them, identify the
problem and say, ‘Here is why we
think there is a problem and here is
our recommended solution.’
“We may ask them to introduce a
bill or add an amendment to remedy
the situation. Or we may work with
task forces and study groups to
make recommendations.”
At times TIPRO may write
model drafts of legislation and ask
a legislator to sponsor the proposal
with TIPRO’s support throughout
the legislative process. Sometimes,
the legislator will ask TIPRO to talk
with other committee members to
make certain they understand the
issue as well as it was explained to
the sponsoring legislator. When that

occurs, TIPRO’s professional staff
and certain members with interests
in the issue will visit with committee members to support the legislator’s effort.
On the other side, a legislator who
is sponsoring a bill might approach
TIPRO noting that there may be
a problem with another legislator
who opposes the bill. TIPRO will
visit with the opposing legislator
to explain the association’s and the
industry’s support of the bill.
“There is some degree of this
taking place in every legislative session,” Dingmore said.

Federal Issues
“The Federal Issues Committee
works in much the same way,”

E f f o r t s

explains Warndof. “The federal
legislative process usually includes
fewer numbers of bills but they are
broader in scope and often change
faster in the legislative process. In
contrast, federal agency rulemaking
is often slower than at the state level
but is also more complex.
The Federal Issues Committee functions about the same as
the State Issues Committee,” she
continues. “We as staff monitor and
ﬂag issues and raise them with the
Committee members. Any member
may also bring an issue for consideration. Then positions and actions are
discussed that can result in anything
from calls and letters of support or
opposition, to formal written comments or testimony.”

Technology
is key to optimally producing reserves

T

he entire idea behind evolving technology in the oil and
gas industry is to maximize an operator’s return on his
investment, which, of course is his reservoir. The key is
understanding what is occurring subsurface by learning
the reservoir’s characteristics via seismic and offset wells, and
then understanding what the operator needs to successfully
apply technology to optimally access the reserves. Knowing the
reservoir’s geology and the formation’s attributes is only the beginning. Working with various service companies, the operator
applies the technologies that, based upon reservoir characterization, result in the highest percentage of reserve depletion.
In many instances today, the industry has moved from
drilling “simple” vertical wells to the more complex horizontal wells necessary to bring value to the reservoir. “The
reason to utilize horizontal well technology is to achieve
the best production rate possible,” said Jeff Gorski, Vice
President, Sales & Marketing for Schlumberger Oilﬁeld
Services, Dallas/Fort Worth and the company’s representative at TIPRO. Over the past few years, he has been
involved with numerous presentations to TIPRO membership about the industry’s innovative technologies.

Technology for drilling horizontal wells
The number of horizontal wells drilled in Texas and in
the United States is increasing, according to Gorski, primarily in ﬁelds produced from tight gas sands and shale
gas plays. This includes plays such as the Barnett Shale
around Fort Worth, the Fayetteville shale in Arkansas and
numerous tight gas sands plays in the Rocky Mountains.
“Horizontal drilling appears to be the technique of
choice in terms of bringing the ultimate value to these
reservoirs,” Gorski said.
To illustrate the growth of horizontal wells, about 45
rigs operate in the Fayetteville shale, with approximately
80% drilling horizontal wells. As of September 2008,
operators in the Barnett Shale play were further developing horizontal techniques: operators are utilizing about
190 rigs with more than 170 drilling horizontal wells.
Horizontal well success factors begin with a cohesive

10

work ﬂow. This includes researching and understanding
the formation’s geology, geophysics, petrophysics and
geomechanics in order to optimally place and maintain
the drillbit’s orientation through the formation. Understanding reservoir characterization is important when
utilizing horizontal well technology such as rotary steerable systems, logging while drilling (LWD) and measurement while drilling (MWD) to steer the drillbit to the
geologic objective.
“It is important when drilling horizontal wells to stay
within the reservoir and assuring that we have the lateral
extent,” Gorski explained, “so the ultimate production
matches the well’s design.”
One of the enabling technologies brought to market is
Schlumberger’s PeriScope bed boundary mapper service.
PeriScope enhances well placement by providing the
ability to “see” the reservoir and map the reservoirs’
boundaries as the wells are being explored. The technology eliminates the potential necessity of drilling expensive and time-consuming sidetrack wells and enhances
production. The service is the industry’s ﬁrst deep and
directional electromagnetic LWD measurement, allowing
the producer to continuously monitor the position of
the formation and ﬂuid boundaries up to 21 ft away. It
is unique it its ability to map bed boundaries, enabling
the drilling team to explore these horizontal wells and
remain in the formation’s sweet spot.
The deep measurement range provides early warning
when steering adjustments are necessary to avoid water
or exploration hazards or to avoid exiting the reservoir
target, an important feature when drilling thin or dipping formations.

Remotely monitoring wells
Additional technology used to optimize exploration and
completions is remote operations centers, where the collaborative drilling team of the operator and service company can monitor the exploration and logging of wells in
real time. Schlumberger has numerous remote Opera-

tions Support Centers (OSC) around
the world that monitor, on a 24/7
basis, various parameters of a well
in progress. More and better quality
downhole data is being transmitted
in real time. Decisions based on that
data could be made at the well site
but in many cases immediate access
to experienced and expert drilling
engineers is imperative to the success of the well.
The company’s OSCs incorporate advanced processes, leading
exploration technology and proven
drilling software for data optimization and analysis as well as communications software for directional
drilling, MWD and LWD operations.
Monitoring the same processes to
optimize exploration also enhances
safety and reduces risk.
“The bulk of the OSCs are focused
on the drilling operations,” Gorski
said, “but many of the OSCs provide
monitoring of various other disciplines such as wireline and fracing
operations, for example. We have a
center in Oklahoma that monitors
the performance of wells with electrical submersible pumps.”
OSCs can be conﬁgured to meet
speciﬁc operator objectives. These
options include Schlumberger’s inhouse OSCs for short-term projects,
or dedicated full-support centers
built in the operator’s ofﬁces for
larger, longer-term projects. The
levels of service provided by the
company’s OSCs also are tailored to
meet the customer’s requirements.
Some operators and projects might
require more service offerings than
others. Schlumberger meets its customers’ needs by offering three levels
of service, each providing a higher
level of solutions.
Remote monitoring locations are
established worldwide, with differing
functions. For example, the company’
OSCs that monitor LWD and MWD
operations are located in Youngsville,

LA; Aberdeen; Calgary; Ciudad del
Carmen, Mexico; and Port Gentile, Gabon. Experienced LWD and
directional drilling engineers provide
operational support for LWD and
MWD ﬁeld crews as well as monitoring operations for trends in pore
pressure and real-time tool performance, downhole shocks and other
exploration mechanics data.

Stimulating and completing
horizontal wells
The next stage after landing and
understanding the horizontal well
is executing and optimizing the
completion. In many instances, tight
gas sands and gas shale plays require
not only an optimal completion
system but successful fracturing and
stimulation of the formation.

The PeriScope* 15 service
enables precise well
placement through exact
knowledge of fluid and bed
boundary contact points.

“The hydraulic fracture mapping
becomes very important from the
standpoint of assuring that the fracture stays in the formation,” Gorski
explained, “and that you are opening
the reservoir itself rather than running into dangers of fracturing a
nearby water sand, for example.”
The company’s StimMAP LIVE
diagnostic service optimizes the fracture treatment by mapping the fractures while they are being created.
This is accomplished by analyzing
micoseismic events created during
the fracturing process and automatically locating them in 3D space. The
heart of the service is a processing
platform that automatically detects
and locates microseismic events. It
then incorporates the processing tool
into hydraulic fracturing operations
to ensure identiﬁcation and location of microseismic events orders of
magnitude faster than hand picking,
enabling operators and technicians
to make better onsite decisions.

The company recently introduced
its StimMORE ﬂuid diversion service
for diverting fracture treatments
along a wellbore in cemented or
openhole completions for shale
fracturing applications. Used in
combination with StimMAP LIVE,
StimMORE allows real-time optimization of the fracture treatments.
The service can be used in most well
geometries and is ideally suited to
cased and openhole horizontal wellbores up to a maximum of 250°F.
The service also is especially wellsuited for use in shale formations.
The diversion slurries can be
pumped on the ﬂy as part of the
main treating ﬂuid, diverting the
fracture as needed based on the
real-time integration of microseismic data. The slurries are based
on standard fracturing ﬂuids and
proppants, with the addition of a
proprietary mix of materials that
enable fracture diversion. The
technologies allow the operator to

create complex drainage patterns
within the reservoir, enabling access
to reserves that may otherwise have
been left in place.
The StimMORE re-fracturing
treatment was applied to a major
operator’s horizontal well in the
Barnett Shale. The well’s initial gas
production of 2,200 Mcf/d declined to less than 500 Mcf/d over
a four-year period. The StimMORE
service coupled with the StimMAP
Live real-time fracture monitoring
service enabled sufﬁcient and costeffective coverage of previously unstimulated well sections, resulting in
a net increase in estimated ultimate
recovery of 0.7 billion cubic feet.

Better seismic imaging and
interpretation
Of course, before drilling and ultimately completing a well, attaining
seismic to help characterize the reservoir and formation is paramount.

technology is signiﬁcantly ahead
of where the industry was only a
few years ago. In one example, an
operator in the Rocky Mountains
conducted 2D seismic surveys and
interpretations but then came back
and surveyed the area with 3D
seismic, greatly enhancing his ability
to characterize the reservoir before
drilling his ﬁrst well.
“Seismic is the exploration tool of
choice. The recent technology advances in acquisition and processing
allows for improved reservoir characterization, that is before you begin
turning to the right,” Gorski said.
Better reservoir characterization
through better seismic, coupled with
new technologies and applications in
imaging and algorithms to interpret
the data, results in better information
before spudding the well. In some
cases, operators don’t have to take the
time and expense of exploring a pilot
hole ﬁrst to make certain they are in
the correct well section and then kick
off toward the target formation.
With PeriScope, and other
technologies that enable real-time
monitoring, there are many regions
today that don’t require the expense of drilling a pilot hole. This
allows the exploration of multiple

wells from a single well pad. For
example, in the Piceance Basin in
the Colorado Rockies, one operator
is drilling as many as 22 wells from
a single pad, all of them directional.
This process not only allows the
operator to bring his production
on line quicker from the ﬁrst 4-6
wells but to continue exploring the
remaining wells while sending the
natural gas to the sales line. In effect, the gas sales from the ﬁrst 4-6
wells pay for the entire 22-well pad
drilling program.
This procedure also saves the operator time and money by not having
to move the rig from one location to
another. Additionally, the exploration
and fracturing process is environmentally friendly since the drill site
is signiﬁcantly smaller than a typical
onshore drilling location. Another
environmental positive that also
results in lower overall cost is water
conservation. Water that is used for
the drilling ﬂuid, after it is cleaned,
also can be used for well stimulation
and fracturing processes, and then
reused again for drilling ﬂuids.

TIPRO looks ahead,
plans for future in changing industry
and political landscape

I

n 2008, 62 years after its founding in 1946, TIPRO
began an ambitious and visionary strategic planning
exercise to guide it through the next decades as a
result of extraordinary changes in the industry and
the political landscape that took place during the past
couple of years. This tremendous undertaking involves
the entire TIPRO membership. We hired a prominent
industry planning and development consultant, who
brought extensive oil and gas industry experience with
several major operators as well as IT experience.
The ﬁrst phase of the strategic planning effort included initial planning meetings attended by about 20
TIPRO members, including former presidents, board
members, committee chairs and founding members.
The attendees also reviewed
TIPRO’s original objectives
contained in the organization’s 1946 charter, and then
participated in several exercises aimed at drafting a new
mission statement, a list of
core values and a vision statement for the Association.
“In reviewing the original
charter documentation, it was interesting to see how relevant the issues still are” said Donna Warndof, TIPRO’s
Director of Public Affairs. “We also were able to bring
new issues to light.”
The next phase of the planning involved the entire
TIPRO membership, who was asked to provide their
input. We sent a draft version of the vision statement to
the entire membership with a survey form to be submitted for feedback. A revised vision statement will be
based upon membership feedback.
“This vision document will help the Association create
multi-year plans to enhance our current efforts, increase
member participation and adapt our communications to
better represent the exploration and production sector,”
explained TIPRO Executive Vice President Adam Haynes.

“We are actively seeking and soliciting new members,” Haynes continued. “As new companies are
formed or new ventures occur, we are in communication with those entities, making sure they know that
TIPRO is here for them.
“Our members are very smart and they understand
the beneﬁts of joining together to help ensure laws and
regulations for our industry continue to be favorable.
Our members support TIPRO’s work so they can have a
voice in government,” Haynes continued.

American oil and gas demographics
is changing
Change is affecting the oil and gas exploration sector.
Two of the industry’s challenges are the age of its participants and the “urbanization” of the industry. The average
age of the industry’s professionals is in the 50s. For the
past couple of years, the industry has been trying to
attract new engineers, geologists, geophysicists, geoscientists and other engineers in their 20s that are just out
of college. The industry has had some success of this
recently, but even with more money, better incentives,
sign-on bonuses, full-ride scholarships, and specialized
community college program development, the supply of
professional or even skilled workers is not keeping up.
The American oil and gas industry sometimes encounters a shortage of students with technical degrees who
are born in the U.S. As a result, some companies are
looking internationally for qualiﬁed personnel to work in
U.S. companies, resulting in a more diverse workplace.
However, this sometimes creates issues that need to be
overcome. For example, foreign students may run into
language or culture barriers. Fortunately, independent
producers are adept at meeting changing circumstances
and adjust well to the new operating norms.
Additionally, trying to hire a foreign worker can sometimes be difﬁcult due to U.S. immigration laws. Major
oil and gas companies have been hiring foreign workers for decades but for independents, and particularly

smaller companies, it can be difﬁcult
to negotiate the complex set of laws
and bureaucracies.
“It’s a deﬁnite demographic challenge for the industry, especially
when our preference has always
been to hire Americans ﬁrst,” Warndof said.
As far as the urbanization of the
industry is concerned, Warndof
said, “the low hanging fruit in terms
of ﬁnding and producing oil and gas
has been picked. Now we are moving into the more difﬁcult areas, untraditional formations in new places,
and that includes urban areas.”
“The pace and scale of worldwide
urbanization is new in history. The
latest demographics point out that
this decade will see 50% of the
world’s population is living in what
is deﬁned as an urban area,” Warndof noted.
“We know that is the future,” she
said, “and we are going to have to
ﬁnd ways to meet it.”
The challenges of urban exploration and production include focusing on technologies such as water
recycling or making drilling rigs
quieter and less intrusive. “There
is a lot of pride in the fact that we
are developing these technologies
and best practices under U.S. laws,”
Warndof said. “We are on the cutting edge of best practices and it is
going to spread worldwide.”

New programs, initiatives
for the future
TIPRO is in a transition phase for the
entire organization, and that includes
educational programs, seminars and
publications. The association produces a twice-monthly newsletter for
its membership, but it also has begun
growing different types of publications. For example, more white
papers on different issues are being
prepared for legislators as well as the
public and TIPRO membership.

w ww.t ip ro.or g

Along the lines of more effective communication is a revamping
of the Association’s website. The
website was redesigned to be more
user-friendly and will be used to
better educate the public about the
state’s independent operators. People
seeking information about TIPRO or
the independent operators, whether
it is a policy maker, elected ofﬁcial,
a citizen or one of the association’s
members, will be able to ﬁnd it on
the new website. It is a great tool for
TIPRO members.
“For a policy maker or elected
ofﬁcial who reads hardcopy paper
reports, storage will no longer be an
issue because TIPRO’s white papers
will be available online,” Warndof
said. “If you are a citizen looking for
a particular article, you won’t have to
write or email us to send it because it
will be online and searchable.”
Other publications are aimed at
smaller companies that don’t have
departments devoted to work with
new regulations. For example, check
lists have been produced by TIPRO
to help small companies meet legal
requirements when new regulations
are implemented that affect them.
“We have provided summaries to
our members in the past but we are
seeing that they need to be more
speciﬁc,” Warndof explained.
The association has conducted
workshops as well when new regulations are implemented, such as
workshops to better understand and
meet legal ﬁling requirements for
new tax regimes. While the workshops are not usually conducted on
a regular schedule due to the nature
of the timing of new regulations
(the Texas legislature meets for 140
days every other year), the association has conducted workshops more
frequently during 2008.
At the beginning of 2008, for example, new franchise tax laws went
into affect. TIPRO conducted several

workshops in different parts of the
state explaining what E&P companies needed to know about the new
tax law. “They were well attended
and we received good feedback,”
Warndof said, “so we likely will
conduct more in the future.”
These particular workshops were
more interactive than previous
events. Several different people spoke
to the groups during the one-day
workshop, and attendees were able
to bring their forms and questions
and receive answers. The workshops
were tailored speciﬁcally to the E&P
industry, and that will be the template for future similar endeavors.
For example, as the Clean Air
Act requirements change for Texas,
workshops that typically would be
available from organizations other
than TIPRO might focus on reﬁneries. That is not where TIPRO’s membership would learn what they need
to know. As a result, the association’s
workshops will be geared for the
independent operators discussing
the regulations that apply to compressors and timelines for when they
need to be changed, for example.

Issues in the 2009 Texas
legislative session
The Texas legislature meets for 140
days every other year. As a result, the
legislature typically focuses on issues
to take the state through the following 24 months. Topics generally
include the state budget, transportation, education and health and
human services issues. Some of those
are recurring issues and likely will be
the major topics in 2009 as well.
“For our industry, as legislators
are spending time on these big
ticket items, our job is to focus on
our issues,” said Lindsey Dingmore,
Manager of Government and Regulatory Affairs for XTO and TIPRO’s
State Issues Committee Chairman.
“In the grand scheme, they might

16

be considered by some to be small
issues, but they are our important
issues, and we will constantly push
them to the front whether we support or oppose an issue.”
Dingmore believes the important
oil and gas issue for the 2009 legislative session will be tax issues. “There
are going to be some key tax issues
on what is called the Texas margin
tax, which is a relatively new tax for
our members,” he said.
This tax formerly was called
the franchise tax, however, it is
not exactly the same tax since the
legislature has broadened it. “Now
more TIPRO members pay that tax,
so some potential changes to the
margin tax will be important to our
members,” Dingmore explained.
Property tax also will be a large
issue, one of a number of issues
related to the valuation of minerals
and personal property in the oil and
gas sector.
The margin tax applies to taxation
of a business’s gross receipts. The
property tax applies to properties
that companies own as well as minerals, which are assessed a valuation
as a person’s home would be assessed
a valuation. School taxes, county
taxes, road taxes, etc. are paid based
upon the mineral valuations.

“Eminent domain also will be a
large issue for our membership,”
Dingmore said, “especially those
members that are producing in areas
where new infrastructure needs to
be installed, such as the Barnett
Shale.”
There are new wells in the Barnett
Shale and along with that comes the
necessity to lay new pipelines. Some
of TIPRO’s members own either
separate entities that lay pipe or they
lay pipe as a producer, Dingmore
noted. “Sometimes they have to use
the power of eminent domain to
cross property with the pipelines,
and those issues will be discussed in
the next legislative session.”
Water will be another issue discussed in the 2009 legislative session.
Texas is growing rapidly and there
continues to be a strain on our surface
and ground water resources. Water
is a major component of the oil and
gas production process so TIPRO will
monitor those discussions closely.
“Without water our exploration
process comes to a halt pretty quickly,” Dingmore emphasized. “If there
is going to be restrictions, fees or
permitting processes to access water,
we want to be a part of that debate.”

that TIPRO always watches closely
during the legislative session. “Is the
agency getting the funding they need
for personnel and other things,” Dingmore asked, “and is it going to be able
to fulﬁll its function?”
For example, “if there are bad
actors in our industry, we want the
laws enforced for those who consider ourselves good actors,” Dingmore
explained.
The Texas exploration and
production industry also wants to
assure that the permitting function
of the RRC is well funded because
the industry needs permits approved
within a reasonable time frame.
Additionally, TIPRO is interested in
assuring that the Oilﬁeld Cleanup
Fund, which is entirely funded
through fees paid by the industry, is
sound and used to clean the environment. As such, producers want to
ensure the rules governing the Fund
are adequately implemented and administered by the RRC. TIPRO was
a strong supporter of increasing the
fund to assure that orphaned wells
were properly plugged.
“We have a great interest in seeing
that the Oilﬁeld Cleanup Fund continues as we originally designed it,”
Dingmore said. TIPRO has also par-

w ww.t ip ro.or g

ticipated in an industry study group
on the relationship of inactive wells
to the Cleanup Fund. Warndof, who
chairs the group, comments, “This
group will make recommendations
for a menu of steps that will help
keep inactive wells from increasing
liability to the OFCU and also from
provoking disputes with surface
owners. We are proud to take another proactive step in stewardship.”
TIPRO also becomes involved
when the RRC goes through the
sunset review process with the legislature. During the sunset review process, each state agency is examined
with greater scrutiny than during the
normal legislature. Agencies that do
not meet certain criteria may not be
allowed to continue to exist.
“A sunset review is a funding as
well as a programming scrutiny
opportunity,” Dingmore explained.
“We are very involved in that process
because the legislature wants to ﬁnd
out if an agency is doing the things
it should be doing and if it is doing
them efﬁciently.
“Among other things, the legislature debates whether an agency
should have broader or more
restricted authority to implement its
functions,” Dingmore concluded.

A WORLD OF GOOD
Clean. Abundant. Affordable. American. Because natural gas is the only available fuel
with these four advantages, it will play an increasing role in meeting America’s 21st-century
energy needs. U.S. natural gas will not only fuel our homes, businesses and cars, but also our
economy – adding jobs and revenues at local, state and national levels.

CLEAN

More energy, less pollution. In our vehicles, it cuts emissions by up to 90%.1
For power generation, it cuts carbon emissions nearly in half.2

ABUNDANT

We have more than a century’s supply3 of natural gas and rising, while developing
large reserves that ﬁve years ago weren’t possible to produce.

AFFORDABLE

On a gallon-equivalent basis, natural gas costs about 40% less than gasoline.4
Its clean efficiency makes it a bargain for power generation.

AMERICAN

About 98% of the natural gas we use is from North America,5 which keeps dollars
at home – while nearly 70% of the oil we use is imported,6 and we export
$1.4 billion a day7 to pay for it.
By ﬁnding and producing America’s own natural gas,
we’re Doing a World of Good.

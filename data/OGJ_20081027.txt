EU ministers agree on energy compromise
Strongly backed by France, which is president of the European
Union through 2008, the unbundling compromise reached June 6
(OGJ, June 16, 2008, Newsletter) was adopted unanimously Oct.
10 at the Energy Ministers meeting in Luxembourg. Controversial
legislation otherwise could have separated the network operation
of electricity and gas from production and supply activities.
Described as “a major political agreement,” the compromise
confirms that ownership of both transportation and marketing
networks will be retained by the producers, but the units will be
operated independently from the parent company and supervised
by an Independent Transmission Operator.
A European regulatory agency will be set up, which will “considerably bolster the coordination of the national regulators,” according to the ministers’ press release.
The European Parliament definitely will adopt these texts in a
second reading. In its first reading, the Parliament had opted for
full unbundling.
The ministers also reaffirmed the crucial importance of energy
efficiency both to achieve climate objectives and to guarantee energy security.
The ministers also discussed the energy-climate package and
especially the renewables directive under which these energies
should account for 20% of the energy mix by 2020. It is one of the
leading priorities of the French presidency, and an agreement at its
first reading is targeted by yearend.

France leads EU Council’s Kyoto extension push
France’s National Assembly voted almost unanimously Oct. 21
on the draft law implementing the country’s environment package,
concluding a widespread debate with all relevant stakeholders over
the past year.
The result “should considerably bolster France’s credibility and
voice within the European and international climate negotiations”
said Jean-Louis Borloo, minister of ecology, energy, and sustainable
development.
Borloo was alluding to the back-tracking of a number of European Union member states on the energy-climate package, which
France wants to see adopted at the next EU Council meeting Dec.
11-12. It will coincide with the United Nations climate conference
in Poznan, Poland, Dec. 1-12 to extend the Kyoto Protocol treaty
beyond 2012.
The energy-climate targets to 2020 are “the three 20s,” namely
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, increase the share of
renewables in energy consumption to 20%, and improve energy
efficiency by 20%. It is one of the priorities of France, which cur-

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

rently holds the rotating EU presidency until yearend, to have the
package adopted in December.
President Nicolas Sarkozy, at the last 27 leaders summit meeting
in Brussels Oct. 15-16, said solutions would be found for countries
that have expressed concern over the cost of the package in the current unfavorable financial and economic environment.
Italy, Poland, and several new EU member states, including
Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and Slovakia, have
threatened to veto the package, while a consensus is needed for its
adoption. Many are coal-dependent countries that are also worried
that the EU’s Emission Trading Scheme would be too costly for
them, as they would need to buy certificates allowing them to emit
carbon dioxide as of 2013. They want the deadline extended to
2020. Their view is that the EU’s policy should be “to reconcile environmental targets with the need for sustainable development.”
The European Commission has already provided for some flexibility in the application of the package. But as its president Jose
Manuel Barroso firmly said at the Oct. 15-16 meeting: “What the
Commission is adamantly opposed to is anything that undermines
the overall architecture of the package” [the three 20s].
Any major backtracking would jeopardize the EU’s environmental leadership because it hopes to influence other countries
worldwide to follow its suit.

Eni, Enel to develop Italy’s ﬁrst CCS project
Italy’s Eni SPA and electric power utility ENEL will integrate
their carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects to construct a pilot
plant in Brindisi under a strategic cooperation agreement signed
in Rome.
Eni, Enel, and the Italian Environment Ministry will also work
on developing carbon dioxide capture technologies and renewable
energy, according to separate memorandum of understanding.
At the Brindisi thermal power station, Enel is working on a pilot
plant that will be able to remove 2.5 tonnes/hr of gas and transport it to the Cortemaggiore site in fall 2009. Eni has started an
injection project that could offload 8,000 tonnes/year of CO2 into
depleted, exhausted Stogit field at Cortemaggiore (Piacenza) in fall
2010. Both companies have committed to lay a pilot dense-phase
CO2 transport line at the Brindisi site to bolster their experience in
transporting CO2.
They will study Italy’s CO2 storage potential in partnership with
Italian research bodies as the European Commission has strongly
urged that this technology be widely deployed across its member
states to enhance security of energy supplies. Enel and Eni plan
to carry out a detailed feasibility study on the construction of a
large-scale integrated demo plant for Enel’s clean-coal power station. ✦

WE’VE GOT THE INDUSTRY

COMING
GOING.
AND

BUT IN A GOOD WAY.

U.S. crude imports rose 1.2% from July 2007 to
10.5 million barrels per day in July 2008. During
the same time period, exports of total distillate fuel
doubled compared to the year before, up 145.9%
to 25.2 million barrels per day from the previous
year. Had you subscribed to API’s Imports and
Exports of Crude Oil and Petroleum Products you
would have seen the details hidden in all the data.
Details like where it’s from, where it’s bound, and
just how much is coming and going. It’s almost like
a list of what’s in and what’s out. But without all the
Hollywood hype and gossipy undertones.

Development

CNX Gas pushes Chattanooga shale exploration

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

CNX Gas Corp., Pittsburgh, has expanded its position the Devonian Chattanooga shale gas play to 235,000 acres in northeastern
Tennessee and plans a two-rig program to drill 10 wells in the rest
of 2008.
The acreage in Scott, Campbell, Anderson, and Morgan counties, Tenn., is largely contiguous and is composed of only a small
number of leases, a rarity in the Appalachian basin, the company
noted. It expanded by buying out its 50% partner Knox Energy Inc.
and acquiring several other leases.
Chattanooga is 50-80 ft thick at about 3,500 ft and rich in total
organic carbon. The company has drilled eight horizontal wells in
the play.
The most recent well cost $900,000 to drill and complete. The
wells were drilled with a truck-mounted, top-drive rig with a
185,000-lb hookload capacity.
CNX Gas, which connected the fifth well in mid-October, said
gas rates at the first four wells are 230, 160, 100, and 230 Mcfd.
Daily rates for the better wells have been stable.
New drilling is occurring in areas that have shown better initial
results, and the company plans microseismic work in late 2008 to
better understand the variances in individual well production.

Atkins-Lincoln 17-2 well in Sentell field, Bossier Parish, La., north
of Shreveport, encountered gas in the Jurassic Lower Bossier and
Haynesville shales.
The well logged 205 ft of highly laminated, silty, and naturally
fractured shale zone with crossplot porosities of 9-12%. Mud logs
indicated abundant gas shows throughout of 400-600 units with
trip gas as high as 3,000 units. The interval exhibits the characteristics of the Lower Bossier shale, the company said.
Just below the laminated section it cut 185 ft of quality dark
black organic rich shale with 1,100-3,000-unit gas shows. This interval exhibits the characteristics the industry classifies as Haynesville shale. TD is 11,300 ft.
The wellbore is suspended with 7-in. intermediate casing
through the Cotton Valley formation at 9,500 ft to preserve the
company’s options to complete as a vertical producer or reenter
for horizontal drilling pending the development of completion
techniques.
As a member of the Core Laboratories Integrated Reservoir Solution’s regional Haynesville Shale Study, the company’s data are
being incorporated into the Core Lab database for use in designing optimum completion techniques for horizontal drilling in the
Haynesville play.

PetroChina to drill in Uzbekistan

Eagle Ford shale gas-condensate ﬁnd gauged

China National Petroleum Corp. subsidiary PetroChina will
form a joint venture with state-owned Uzbekneftegaz to develop
Mingbulak oil field in Namangan province on the northern edge of
the Fergana Valley in northeastern Uzbekistan.
The joint venture “will help meet Uzbekistan’s demand for oil
and boost the development of China’s natural gas upstream business and the Central Asia-China natural gas pipeline project,” CNPC
said.
CNPC in January started building the CAC pipeline, which will
transport gas from Turkmenistan, through Uzbekistan and southern Kazakhstan, to western China’s Xinjiang region. The pipeline,
scheduled to start operations in 2009, will have a transmission capacity of 1.1 tcf/year of gas.
CNPC, which did not disclose any financial details of the new
agreement, said production from Mingbulak field, which has reserves estimated at more than 30 million tonnes, is expected to
reach 2 million tonnes/year.

Petrohawk Energy Corp., Houston, said it placed a horizontal
new field discovery well in Upper Cretaceous Eagle Ford shale in
South Texas on production at the rate of 7.6 MMcfd of gas and 250
b/d of condensate.
The South Texas find is in southwestern La Salle County just
south of Stuart City gas field on the Edwards reef trend (see map,
OGJ, Aug. 13, 2007, p. 38). Petrohawk Energy has leased more than
100,000 net acres in what it believes to be the most prospective
areas for commercial production from the Eagle Ford.
The company drilled the STS 241-1H discovery well to 11,300
ft true vertical depth and ran fracs totaling more than 2 million lb
of sand in 10 stages in a 3,200-ft lateral.
It also cored, logged, and is drilling the lateral at the Dora Martin 1H, a confirmation well 15 miles away, where Eagle Ford quality appears to be superior to that in the discovery well. Petrohawk
Energy expects to spud a third well by mid-November.
The company estimated development well drilling and completion cost at $5-7 million. It plans to run one rig continuously and
will access existing gathering and transportation facilities. ✦

“There are also options for services post-Phase II FEED, which
include early works, detailed engineering and procurement services, technical assistance, and design-system integrity,” said Aker Solutions ASA, one of the companies in the engineering consortium.
Kashagan, which has 34.5 billion bbl of oil in place, is a challenging field having high pressure and high hydrogen sulfide levels.

In addition, it is in an environmentally sensitive area with difficult
weather conditions. An initial output of 150,000 b/d of production from the field was originally scheduled to start in 2005, but
it has been delayed until fourth-quarter 2012 due to the technical
challenges, cost increases, and a reconfiguration of the offshore
plant to boost efficiency levels and safety standards (OGJ Online,
Sep. 19, 2008).
Kashagan, 80 km southeast of Atyrau in the North Caspian Sea,
will be developed in three phases.
WorleyParsons and Aker Solutions secured the engineering services, fabrication, and hookup for the first phase, which is expected
to cost $19 billion.

Processing
Pennsylvania plant to process Marcellus gas
MarkWest Energy Partners LP has started up a 30 MMcfd refrigeration plant southwest of Pittsburgh to process natural gas from
the Devonian Marcellus shale.
MarkWest, meanwhile, is installing a 30 MMcfd cryogenic gas
processing plant next to the refrigeration unit near Houston in
Chartiers Township in Washington County for start-up in the first
quarter of 2009 and plans to build a 120 MMcfd cryogenic plant
with a depropanizer by late 2009. It also is evaluating the addition
of a fractionator.
The refrigeration plant represents Pennsylvania’s first large-scale
gas processing infrastructure, said Mark West and Marcellus gas
producer Range Resources Corp., Fort Worth.
MarkWest is investing $200 million in facilities to gather and
process gas that Range Resources is extracting from the Marcellus,
and Range has invested more than $700 million in leases, drilling,
and facilities in the past 4 years.
The refrigeration plant “signals the beginning of material natural gas production from the Marcellus shale formation,” Range
Resources said. The company plans to be producing 30 MMcfd by
yearend 2008 and 80-100 MMcfd by yearend 2009.

Takreer moves ahead with Ruwais expansion
Abu Dhabi Oil Refining Co. (Takreer), an arm of state-owned
Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. (ADNOC), has selected Honeywell unit
UOP LLC to supply technology and engineering services for an
expansion at the Ruwais refinery in the UAE.
The refinery will produce propylene, unleaded gasoline, naphtha, LPG, aviation turbine fuel, kerosine, gas oil, bunker fuel, and
other products. Basic engineering design is currently in progress,
and the refinery is expected to be complete in 2014.
Honeywell said the new facility will utilize “a wide range of
UOP technologies for the production of clean, low-sulfur distillate
and gasoline.”
In July, Takreer selected Shaw Group’s Energy & Chemicals
Group to supply engineering services and licensing for its proprietary residue fluid catalytic cracking technology.
In addition to its RFCC technology, Shaw also will provide
engineering services to integrate and coordinate 11 process units

Group seeks greater New Albany gas output
GTI is leading a research consortium to turn noncommercial
natural gas wells into commercial producers in the Devonian New
Albany shale in the Illinois basin.
GTI signed a contract for a multiyear program with the Research Partnership to Secure Energy for America, which is focused
on meeting US gas demand and lowering costs for consumers. GTI
is a research, development, and training organization.
The consortium involves GTI and 14 participants. They include Atlas Gas & Oil, Aurora Oil and Gas, BreitBurn Energy, CNX
Gas Corp, Inflection Energy, NGAS Resources, Noble Energy, and
Trendwell Energy Corp.
The consortium plans joint research targeting the 10.5 tcf of
technically recoverable gas in the New Albany shale formation. ✦

from other licensors at the site.
In February Takreer announced plans to more than double the
capacity of the Ruwais facility to 817,000 b/d.
At the time Takreer general manger Jasem Ali al-Sayegh said the
engineering and design study for the expansion should be completed by yearend 2008 or early 2009.
Refined products consumption in the UAE is set to rise about
4.5% this year, according to forecasts of analyst BMI, which also
said, “Takreer sees the Ruwais expansion as one of its most important projects.”
Ruwais produces light products mainly for export to Japan and
elsewhere in Asia. Fuel oil is sold as bunkers by the ADNOC and
also used for domestic electric power generation.
Once expanded, Ruwais will be integrated with a petrochemicals complex and an oil lubricants plant, due online in 2012 and
currently under construction by Takreer along with joint venture
partners Neste Oil and OMV.

PDVSA awards JGC modernization contract
Venezuela’s state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), as
part of its on-going Siembra Petrolera plan, has signed an agreement with JGC Corp. to form a strategic alliance aimed at improving the country’s refining capacity. In particular, the accord with
JGC will foster the development of Venezuela’s refining projects,
especially those involving the conversion of heavy oil, according
to Asdrubal Chavez, PDVSA refining, commerce, and supply vicepresident.
JGC was involved in the construction of the Cerro Negro heavy
crude upgrader in the Orinoco belt, and the Japanese firm also is
completing basic engineering for an expansion at the Puerto La
Cruz refinery.
The PDVSA announcement follows several earlier ones concerning financial arrangements for the projects.
In September, Venezuela said it signed a $1.2 billion loan with
the Japanese Bank for International Cooperation.
According to Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez, who doubles as president of PDVSA, the loan will enable modernization of two refineries: at El Palito and Puerto La Cruz.
The amount of Japanese financing for the two projects is con-

siderably lower than PDVSA had earlier hoped for. In May, PDVSA
made an unsuccessful bid for $3.5 billion in credit from Japan’s
Sumitomo Corp. and Itochu Corp. “For the expansion of the El
Palito and Puerto La Cruz refineries we’re using technology…for
deep crude conversion. For this we need specialized equipment
manufactured overseas, and that’s why we’ve secured the Japanese
company financing,” Ramirez said at the time.
The hoped-for accord was similar to a $3.5 billion loan PDVSA
obtained in February 2007 from Marubeni Corp. and Mitsui & Co.
as an advanced payment for oil shipments to be made later in the
year. The Japanese funds were provided to PDVSA via two special
purpose companies established in the Netherlands by Marubeni
and Mitsui: Yucpa Finance and Caribe Financing Co.
PDVSA was expected to repay that loan through sales cash flow

generated by its crude oil and petroleum products. The first oil
exports to Japan—20,000-30,000 b/d of oil and products—were
expected to begin by mid-2007.
In July, Venezuela’s El Universal newspaper reported that rising
costs and rising oil prices had led PDVSA to “realign its Siembra
Petrolera investment plan up to 2012.”
According to information provided by PDVSA to Banco Central de Venezuela, the firm now plans to invest $78.116 billion in
2007-12, an increase of 40% over the $56 billion calculated for the
same period in 2005.
The paper said that 2008 is “the main” year for investment
within the plan, with a total outlay of $15.671 billion planned.
That amount includes $4.102 billion for production, $3.91 billion
for natural gas, and $2.276 billion for refining. ✦

Sakhalin-2 deliveries to start in early 2009
Shipments of LNG to Japan from the Sakhalin-2 project in far
eastern Russia are expected to begin early next year, according to
two Japanese partners in the project.
“We probably can start delivery in the first quarter,” said a
spokesman of Mitsubishi Corp., while one for Mitsui & Co. said
“Construction work is more than 98% completed, so we will be
able to start delivery early next year.”
The Sakhalin Energy Investment Co. (SEIC) partners originally
aimed to start delivery in 2008, but delayed the schedule to 2009
citing a shortage of resources. Russia also briefly froze the project,
citing environmental problems, which contributed to the delay.
Earlier this month, Russian authorities visited the site and said
it no longer posed any threat to the environment. “This project is
exemplary from the point of view of the environment,” said Russian Natural Resources Minister Yuri Trutnev after the inspection.
In September, Sakhalin Energy started to send natural gas from
the Molikpaq offshore drilling platform to a gas processing facility on the coast of Sakhalin Island. It said gas would then be piped
from the processing facility to its LNG plant on the island.
Since then, there have been new developments concerning the
arrangement for ships to transport the LNG to markets.
In early October, the Japan Bank of International Cooperation
(JBIC) joined the two banks already financing Sovcomflot’s project
to build two LNG tankers for the project.
In addition to JBIC, the consortium of creditor banks includes
Mizuho Corporate Bank and Bayerische Landesbank. “JBIC’s entry
into the project will make it possible to optimize [the] financing
expense for the borrowers,” said Russia’s state-owned Sovcomflot,
which is constructing the ships along with NYK.
The two 145,000 cu m ships—the Grand Aniva and the Grand
Yelena—are being financed by a $320 million loan for 12 years.
The loan is secured by earnings from the operation of the vessels under long-term contracts to deliver LNG to Japan, South Korea, and the US. The Grand Elena, built in 2007, and the Grand
Aniva, built in 2008, were delivered on schedule from Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries.
Both vessels have since been sublet to Taiwan Maritime Transport (TMT) in the interim year before the Sakhalin-2 project gets

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

ready for start-up. Delivery of the third and final ship ordered by
the Sakhalin partners, the 147,200-cu m Grand Mereya, is due this
month after several delays.
The ship was originally listed as being due for handover from
Japan’s Mitsui Engineering & Shipbuilding Co. in April. Later, a date
in May was given. In July, project officials said the vessel would be
delivered in August.
“We are finally getting to the end of the technical problems,”
one MES official said. “The delays were caused by failure of the
[ship’s] low-duty boil-off gas compressors,” he said.
Industry sources also suggested that SEIC was in no hurry to
take delivery of the vessel, which it had planned to trade on the
spot market until exports from the project start next year. In terms
of exports, SEIC already has signed long-term supply contracts
with Japanese, South Korean, and US buyers for nearly all of the
LNG from the island’s 9.6 million tonnes/year capacity plant.
More than 60% of that output will go to Japanese utilities firms
including Tokyo Electric Power Co. and Tokyo Gas Co., accounting for 7.5% of Japan’s total natural gas imports. The remainder of
Sakhalin-2’s output will be sold to the US and South Korea.

Pemex awards Ku-Maloob-Zaap pipeline contract
Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) has let a contract to Global Industries Ltd. for oil and natural gas pipeline work in Pemex’s Ku-Maloob-Zaap field in the Bay of Campeche, which it had announced
in July.
The project, worth about $46 million, is scheduled to begin
in March 2009 and be completed by the end of July 2009. Global
will utilize its Shawnee construction vessel as the main pipelaying
vessel, with additional support vessels assisting.
Global will install two pipelines in water about 300 ft deep: 2.1
km of 24-in. line extending from PP-Maloob-C platform to PP-KuH platform, and ½-km of 12-in. from a subsea connection to the
PP-Maloob-C. The project also includes pipeline crossings, risers,
and expansion curves, the firm said.
Ku-Maloob-Zaap is one of Pemex’s central projects for offsetting the natural decline at Cantarell field, which currently accounts
for more than 40% of the company’s output. ✦

Warming letter reply
You know you are being effective
when people complain about you. The
letter in the Sept. 8 issue of Oil & Gas
Journal, though, followed an established
formula, starting with an impugned
association with the coal industry (OGJ,
Sept. 8, 2008, p. 12).
A point by point refutation would be
tedious, but I am compelled to say that
neither I nor the Lavoisier Society has
any association with or funding from
the coal industry. I left the coal industry
in 1980 to join the oil industry. Right
now I am the very happy operator of oil
exploration permits totaling 8.6 million acres of Palaeozoic intracratonic
rift sediments in the Canning basin of
northwestern Australia.
The oil industry in this country
embraced global warming as a way of
selling more natural gas to the power
industry, displacing coal. That supping
with the devil, though, has resulted
in serious blowback, as the Australian
government has undertaken to introduce
carbon taxes which will severely impinge the LNG industry here.
At the same time, there is strong government support in Australia for expansion of the export coal industry, so that
other countries can increase their carbon
dioxide emissions.
A peer-reviewed paper of mine
predicting a 2° C. decline in temperature next decade has been accepted for
publication in January in a UK scientific
journal. Previous papers of mine on the
subject of climate are available on the
Lavoisier website: “The Past and Future
of Climate,” “Failure to Warm,” and “Solar Cycle 24: Implications for the United
States.” The web locations are:

Makings of a new mess
A sobering aspect of the global financial crisis
is comprehensive failure of officials and experts,
first, to see the problem coming and, next, to appreciate its severity until full-blown calamity was
at hand. Well into 2008, US officials were providing assurances that financial troubles could be
confined to the mortgage industry. Then, one after
another, venerable financial institutions run by the
industry’s brightest minds began in various ways
to topple, their previously hidden vulnerabilities
suddenly on shocking display.
Among multiple shortcomings contributing to
the fiasco is one that festered at the core of earlier,
less-sweeping financial breakdowns. It’s the inability of modern, sophisticated risk management adequately to manage risk. The spectacular collapses
of enterprises like Metalgesellschaft, Barings Bank,
and Enron had in common the loss of control over
risk amid aggressive trading of complex derivative
instruments. This time, the failure didn’t confine
itself to a single institution. It’s systemic. And it
may yet undermine the global economy.

New market
Against this background, the US soon may create a massive derivatives market with no commercial foundation. The government will determine
the underlying value of the traded instruments.
Rules will be complex. Trading will be hard for
anyone but traders to understand.
Current events provide no reason for confidence that the government can effectively administer a synthetic market such as this or that
industry can manage risks within it. That such a
monstrosity is even under discussion defies belief.
But so does much that flows from popular anxiety
over global warming.
Both presidential candidates propose “capand-trade” schemes to limit emissions of the
gases thought to aggravate observed warming. The
programs would set emission caps and provide for
the trading of emission allowances, the supply of
which the government would control. The main
difference between the candidates’ proposals is the
ultimate target. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) wants
emissions to be 60% below 1990 levels by 2050.
Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) wants the reduction
over that period to be 80%.
Like anyone who has proposed a cap-and-trade
response to climate change, the candidates pro-

mote their ideas as market-based strategies able to
capitalize on technical ingenuity. Their programs
are in fact highly prescriptive and very complex,
enforcing staged reductions in emissions by
phasing down over time the availability of emissions allowances. Two features are important: the
creation of a market for emissions allowances, or
“offsets,” and limits on emissions of greenhouse
gases.
The prospective market’s size depends on the
value of allowances, which depends greatly on
regulatory details such as whether buyers can
hold allowances for future use. An allowance
value of $25/tonne of carbon dioxide-equivalent
is a reasonable guess. At that value and at current
emission levels, allowance trading could be worth
a tantalizing $150 billion/year. It’s enough to inspire considerable risk-taking, corruption of regulators and lawmakers, and surely some measure of
the type of accounting deception that camouflaged
the housing-credit mess. And it all will serve an
activity that produces nothing of genuine economic value.

House of horrors
Why would anyone propose to build another
financial house of horrors?
The answer is simple and troubling: Cap-andtrade systems mask the inescapable and inescapably large costs of global-warming responses.
However they’re achieved, emission cuts replace
low-cost with high-cost energy. A market for allowances can in no way assuage the consequent
economic harm and might, by diverting resources
to the pursuit of trading profits unrelated to real
goods and services, make things worse. Supporters
of cap-and-trade schemes say new businesses related to nonfossil energy would offset the damage.
Given the subsidies needed to bring alternatives
to market, not to mention the effects on consumers forced to pay more for energy, that assertion is
delusional.
In the perilous second half of 2008, a capand-trade remedy for global warming should be
unthinkable. If there must be warming response,
the people forced to pay the bill—that is, all who
consume energy and pay taxes—deserve an honest
view of the cost. In the perilous second half of
2008, new economic hazard is not something politicians should paper over with program tricks. ✦

Montana’s Crow Nation and Australian-American Energy Co. reported in
August that they will jointly construct
a $7 billion coal-to-liquid (CTL) fuels
plant in southeastern Montana. Plans
for the plant were unveiled Aug. 8, with
2016 announced as the likely date for
the start of production at the plant.
CTL seems to present an ideal scenario for coal, utility, and petroleum
companies
to work
together.
Utility
companies want
to turn
coal into
electricity, while coal companies seek to
expand their market from solely electric
power generation to liquid hydrocarbon conversion, and petroleum companies can use the carbon dioxide (CO2)
produced for enhanced oil recovery
(EOR).
The economic incentives of using
coal with green technology to make
electricity and transportation fuel was
explained in the OGJ, Feb. 26, 2007,
article, “Fischer-Tropsch oil-from-coal
promising as transport fuel.”1 Specifically, the method couples the integrated
gasification combined cycle (IGCC)
process with Fischer-Tropsch syngas
conversion to develop an advantageous,
green CTL system from pairing the two
technologies.

New economic conditions
However, much has happened since
that economic analysis. Crude oil
prices ramped up to more than $140/
bbl from about $60/bbl, while plant
construction prices escalated greatly as

well—although not quite to the degree
of crude oil.
Furthermore, CO2 can now be
valued higher because its use in EOR
floats with the value of crude oil.
Originally $1/Mcf, it recently commanded a price as high as $5/Mcf.
IGCC investment costs also have risen—
to $2,000-3,000/kw capacity from
$1,400/kw capacity.
This article presents the best and
worst-case scenarios for CTL based
on recent economic conditions. The
best-case scenario includes oil valued
at $135/bbl, investment costs for IGCC
increased to $2,000/kw capacity from
$1,400, and CO2 valued at $5/Mcf. The
worst-case scenario has oil valued at
$75/bbl, investment costs at $3,000/
kw capacity and CO2 valued at $2/Mcf.
The cost for the Fischer-Tropsch section
of the IGCC plant was scaled by the
same amount.
The economics shown in Table 1
illustrate that a huge increase in capital
costs was offset by higher crude oil
prices. Specifically, the discounted cash
flow (DCF) rate of return increased to
27% for the best-case scenario from
the original 15% (Case 3 in the February 2007 article), and it dropped only
slightly—to 12%—for the worst-case
scenario.
The announcement of the Crow
Nation-Australian-American Energy Co.
Montana CTL project is evidence that
this clean technology merits serious
consideration for future energy projects, particularly when the coproduced
CO2 can be used for EOR.

IGCC plant operations
In a typical IGCC plant, coal is first
gasified to synthesis gas—hydrogen and
carbon monoxide (CO). The synthesis

gas is scrubbed to remove acid gases
and mercury. The synthesis gas is then
burned in the combustion turbine,
and the hot exhaust is used to raise
steam to drive a second turbine. Both
turbines produce electricity, with the
thermal efficiency increasing to 40% for
combined-cycle operation from 33%
for a direct-fired coal unit.
If the synthesis gas is passed through
a water gas shift converter before reaching the turbines, the CO converts to
CO2 and hydrogen. The CO2 can then be
scrubbed, providing a hydrogen-rich
stream to the turbines. This is an “ultragreen” scenario because there is very
little CO2 emitted from the power plant.
CO2 cannot be eliminated entirely because some CO must be left in the feed
to the power plant for flame stability.
The figure shows the process flow for
converting coal to electricity and liquid
hydrocarbons.
With newer technologies, such as
IGCC, coal conversion is an environmentally friendly process. Pollutants
such as mercury, sulfur oxides (SOx),
and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) are
essentially eliminated because coal gasification instead makes hydrogen sulfide
and ammonia, and these easily can be
removed in acid gas scrubbers. CO2 also
can be captured and sequestered. If oil
fields are nearby and responsive to CO2
flooding for EOR, then CO2 can provide
a significant income stream.

be injected into the ground and stored.
In addition, the CO2 produced in the
CTL process has tremendous potential
for EOR use if a mature, light-oil field is
nearby. These synergies suggest that the
coal and petroleum industries should
cooperate to enable green coal technology to be exploited to increase oil
production via EOR.

a price of $1-5/Mcf. Because it takes
roughly 5 Mcf of CO2 injection to produce 1 bbl of oil, the price of CO2 will
continue to rise correspondingly as oil
becomes more valuable.
Oil & Gas Journal’s most recent
EOR survey shows EOR projects using
CO2 injection increasing, with the 100
ongoing CO2 miscible injection projects
accounting for 240,000 b/d of additional US oil production. Despite these
advances, scant availability of CO2 currently limits the US petroleum industry’s ability to expand CO2 flooding.3
Because CO2 has become a viable
product in its own right rather than
simply a byproduct, CO2 handling today
differs considerably from its handling
during the energy crisis of the 1970s
and 1980s when it was simply emitted into the atmosphere. As incentive to
curtail CO2 emissions, the US Department of Energy has been funding CO2
sequestration partnerships around the
country.

two major presidential nominees left
discussion of energy issues to surrogates. Two such lively discussions
were recently held in Washington,
DC.
In one, Virginia Gov. Timothy M.
Kaine (D) and a predecessor George
Allen (R) represented the campaigns
of Sens. Barack H. Obama and John
S. McCain, respectively, at an Oct. 15
Dulles Regional Chamber of Commerce breakfast debate.
Virginia became part of the US
Minerals Management Service’s
2007-12 Outer Continental Shelf
leasing plan after its legislators passed
a comprehensive energy plan, including possible offshore lease sales, and
Kaine signed it in 2006. “We’d like to
learn what’s out there and then determine whether it should be leased and
developed,” Kaine said.
Allen said the state has tried for 2
years to get out from under a federal
OCS moratorium but was repeatedly
frustrated by Democratic congressional leaders. “Once it does, Georgia and the Carolinas won’t be far
behind,” he predicted.

‘Use it or lose it’
Allen and Kaine said their respective candidates support more access
to domestic resources. But Kaine said
Obama wants to see lessees develop
tracts more quickly and suggested
that so-called “Use it or lose it”
legislation might be needed. Allen
responded that this would be redundant because federal leases already
have time limits.

Allen. McCain favors an “all of the
above” approach, he said.
Kaine said Obama wants more
alternative and renewable energy
research and development. “Drilling
for more oil and gas domestically
should be part of a total package, but
he wants it to be a small part. It’s a
short-term strategy that’s a dead end
without alternatives,” he said.

Major role for gas
The two major nominees’ energy
policy advisors also debated at an
American Gas Association Natural
Gas Roundtable luncheon Oct. 16.
John McCarrick, representing McCain, and L.G. Holstein, representing
Obama, agreed that gas will continue to play a major US energy role.
Both candidates want to increase domestic production, support opening
more of the OCS, but oppose leasing
within the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge.
Holstein suggested that the nominees’ biggest energy policy difference
is over nuclear power, which McCain
encourages. He said Obama would
promote gas and realizes its increased
use would require more domestic
production.
McCarrick responded that the
International Energy Agency has said
1,200-1,400 more nuclear plants
would be needed to meet future
worldwide demand, and the US

beginning of the Pleistocene Epoch,”
USGS said.
While the evaluation assumed that
the assessed hydrocarbon resources
can be produced by existing conventional technology, the report added that
the production potential of northern
Alaska’s known and seismically inferred
gas hydrate accumulations has not been
adequately field-tested, although it has
been the focus of a research effort led
by the US Department of Energy.

T E R E S T
“Although verified by only limited
field testing, numerical production
models of gas hydrate-bearing reservoirs at the Milne Point and Prudhoe
Bay oil fields suggest that gas can be
produced from gas hydrates with existing technology. Among the various
techniques…depressurization appears
to be the most promising method,” it
said.
Of the 85.4 tcf, which represents a
mean estimate, the USGS report said
that about 20.6 tcf, or 24%, is in the Sagavanirktok formation; 28 tcf, or 33%,

is in the Tulavak-Schrader Bluff-Prince
Creek formations, and 36.9 tcf, or 43%,
is in the Nanushuk formation.
“Given that relatively few wells have
penetrated the expected gas hydrate
accumulations in these three assessment
units, there is significant geologic uncertainty, which is reflected in the range
of estimates,” it said. The new mean
estimate is lower than the 590 tcf reported in the 1995 assessment because
it deals only with technically recoverable amounts instead of total in-place
gas hydrates, it pointed out. ✦

FACTS: Iran needs timely completions in South Pars
Iran’s natural gas production from
South Pars gas field Phases 6, 7, 8, and
9—all expected to be completed this
fall—could prevent another massive energy crisis in Iran this winter, according
to Siamak Adibi in a September FACTS
Global Energy Energy Briefs report.
Much would depend on the phases’
completing on schedule and on the
winter’s not being excessively cold.
In the frigid 2007-08 winter, Iran
consumed a peak 21.2 bscfd of gas,
Adibi reported, while total production averaged 16.5 bscfd. The shortage
resulted in a massive reduction of gas
reinjection into Iranian oil fields and
a supply cut to electric power plants,
industrial projects, and 200,000 residential and commercial consumers. Iran
also halted gas exports to Turkey.
Although Iran agreed to increase
its gas imports from Turkmenistan in
second-quarter 2008 to as much as
1.1 bscfd this winter to decrease Iran’s
gas deficit, it found Turkmenistan gas
imports last year to be unreliable.
Turkmenistan stopped deliveries of 800

gas shortage increased to maximum
levels and then raised the price of its gas
to $4.90/MMbtu from the 2007 fixed

In April, Iran agreed to pay the
higher price and renewed imports.
Turkmenistan said that after 2009, its
gas price would be linked to oil in a
new price formula, FACTS reported.

Iranian South Oil Co. (NISOC) supplied
65% of Iran’s gas production. Although
it expects to increase production by
an additional 0.9 bscfd of gas this year
by developing Tange Bijar gas field and
drilling more wells in Nar, Kangan,
Homa, Shanul, Varavi, or Tabnak gas
fields, the gas from South Pars Phases
9 and 10 will be urgently needed to
prevent “a massive energy crisis” this
winter, FACTS reported.
• Phases 9 and 10. Development of
Phases 9 and 10 of the South Pars gas
field development, which would release
2 bscfd of gas to the domestic market,
was nearing completion in September,
and gas is expected to flow from Phase
9 this month, with Phase 10 flow expected in November.
“The gas crisis may be more critical
for years 2009-11 when delayed South
Pars phases will not be completed earlier than 2012,” FACTS reported.
• Phases 6-8. Although South Pars
Phases 6-8 will produce another 3.6
bscfd of gas, 152,000 b/d of condensate, and 1.6 million tonnes/year
of LPG, the gas is scheduled to be
delivered via a 512-km, 56-in. pipeline to Agha-Jari oil field in Khuzestan
Province for reinjection. Phase 6 was
scheduled for completion this summer,
and gas is expected to flow from Phases
7 and 8 late this year and early 2009.

ed until late 2012-early 2013. About
1 bscfd of gas from Phase 12 has been
allocated for Iran’s domestic market.
However, another 2 bscfd of gas
from Phase 12, which has been designated as feedstock for Iran’s LNG plant,
might well be delivered to the domestic market until the long-delayed LNG
project starts up in 2015, said FACTS.
• Phases 17 and 18. NIOC and National
Iranian Drilling Co. recently signed a
contract valued at more than $1 billion
for drilling 27 wells in Phases 17 and
18, which are intended to produce 2
bscfd of gas and 80,000 b/d of condensate. They are expected to be completed in 2013-14.
• Phase 13. Although Phases 13 and
14 formerly were allocated to Iran’s
LNG project, Royal Dutch Shell PLC
and Repsol YPF SA have delayed a final
investment decision (FID) on participating in the Persian LNG project, thus
delaying it.
However, because Phase 13 is located
near the Iran-Qatar marine border, its
development is generating sense of
urgency. “The longer Iran delays development of Phase 13, the more likely
it is to lose some of its gas reserves to
gas migration, as Qatar is extensively
exploiting the adjoining North Field,”
said FACTS. Phase 13 is thought to have
a relatively high output of gas and condensate productivity levels.
Later South Pars phases
So although Iran originally sched“The gas crisis may be more critical uled Phase 13 development to follow

However, the EPC contractor will install the offshore platforms in the Phase
13 areas instead of the area of Phases 15
and 16, and Phases 14-16 will be considered for the Persian LNG project.

After 2015 development
Other phases are unlikely to be completed before 2015.
• Phase 11. Long delays have precluded Phase 11’s providing gas for the
domestic market before 2015. Considered for Pars LNG, Phase 11 is unlikely
to see its FID before Iran’s next presidential election—in summer 2009 at
the earliest, FACTS said.
Total SA recently said Iran’s political environment is too risky right now
for investment, and it has postponed
making an investment decision. NIOC
responded that it will not wait for
Total’s decision and is able to develop
Phase 11with local companies.
“We think Total effectively has withdrawn from the project by postponing
its FID because of Iran’s current political
situation. However the company is still
officially involved,” Adibi said in the
FACTS report. “Even the cancellation
of Pars LNG and the appointment of
new contractors to develop Phase 11 is
unlikely to provide gas from Phase 11
for the Iranian domestic market before
2015.”
• Phases 19-24. These phases have
also been delayed, and their development is expected to be completed after
2015. ✦

Natural gas supplies will continue
to come mainly from conventional

The great uncertainty, however,
is how major resource holders will

Pipeline delays
Looking at the needed infrastructure
to deal with increasing gas flows, both
regional and global, Tanaka was concerned that “progress on major pipelines, outside the United States is slow.”
Improvements to market functioning
are especially urgent in Europe, he
noted, because of the region’s growing
demand for gas. Also needed in Europe
are greater cross-border gasline connections.
Noted, also, were the many delays in
pipeline infrastructure development last
year globally as well as increased costs.
Particularly mentioned were Nabucco
and Nord Stream in Europe and the
Alaska pipeline in North America.
In LNG there are similar trends, as

“In fact, Pertamina benefits from the

In July, the Indonesia’s Supreme Audit Agency (BPK) began an investigative

its subsidiary, Singapore based Petral, a
week after experts hinted at irregulari-

The audit, which has a particular

of Russia joining the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries. In
the coming months, we’ll probably
hear more, too.
A week or so ago, Qatar’s Oil Minister Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah
expressed the hope of seeing Russia
one day become a full member of
OPEC as it would “add value” to the
organization.
“I wish one day to see Russia as
a full member of OPEC,” Al-Attiyah
said in an interview. “Russia as the
second (largest) oil exporting country (after Saudi Arabia) has a strong
role in the oil market, so if Russia
were to join OPEC, it would add
value,” he said.
But even Al-Attiyah had to acknowledge that his wish has little
chance of being fulfilled—at least
for the moment. “So far the Russians
support cooperation, but they don’t
talk about full membership,” he said.

Cooperation could include joint

national oil and gas companies,
joint investments and the sharing of
technology, as well as environmental
issues, Sechin said. But again, he said
nothing about becoming a member
of OPEC.

Russians say ‘nyet’

With all due respect to our friend
Al-Attiyah and other esteemed OPEC
ministers, there is no reason to think
that Sechin or any other Russian
official ever would want to join the
organization.
After all, what is OPEC about

sharing contract—set to expire on May
6, 2011—had to be extended in any
case.
According to Sung, the South Korean
company plans to seek an extension of
the West Madura PSC but “every time
we invite Pertamina to discuss the issue,
they choose not to come.”
The looming contract extension date
puts Kodeco and CNOOC in a weak
bargaining position as Indonesian regulations require investors to return oil
and gas blocks to the government after
their rights expire.
Under those terms, Indonesia can
either extend the Kodeco and CNOOC
contracts or simply offer the block
to Pertamina. In an effort to secure at
least a share of the block, Kodeco and
CNOOC might decide to accede to Pertamina’s demand.
Pertamina’s efforts to assume control
of the Madura block follow attempts to
obtain a larger interest in other oil and
gas concessions, including Total’s Mahakam Block in East Kalimantan, Inpex’s
offshore Masela Block in the Timor Sea,
and Chevron Corp.’s deepwater fields off
East Kalimantan.
“We want to have 20% stakes in
Masela, Mahakam, and the deepwater
areas,” Karen said. “We have secured

mate development cost will range to

The Cretaceous Hollin sandstone,
one of the principal producing formations in Ecuador’s Amazon basin, is the
pay zone at Pungarayacu. It is 250 ft to
more than 300 ft thick and is topped
from surface to deeper than 1,500 ft.
The firm said confirmation of these
resources “would make the Pungarayacu
field the largest accumulation of heavy
oil in Ecuador
and one of
the largest in
Latin America.”
Ivanhoe also believes there is potential for deeper exploration for lighter
oil.
Ivanhoe said, “This deeper zone in
the Pungarayacu field has not yet been
drilled with exploration wells, but the
field lies on a regional arch that could
focus migrating oil into this area.”

Ecuador’s state-owned Petroecuador
and Petroproduccion have signed a
30-year contract with Ivanhoe Energy
Ecuador Inc., a subsidiary of Ivanhoe
Latin America, to explore and develop
Block 20 on the western edge of Ecuador’s Amazon basin.
Block 20 contains the 250-sq-mile
Pungarayacu heavy oil accumulation
along the Napo uplift.
Ivanhoe said the contract covers
project appraisal and the development,
including production and upgrading
the heavy oil of the 426-sq-mile Block
20, which lies 125 miles southeast of
Quito, the Ecuadoran capital.
Pungarayacu field was discovered 30
years ago. During the 1980s, Petroproduccion drilled 26 core holes in the
field, which has been studied and evaluated by Petroproduccion, ARCO, and
other oil companies.
According to Ivanhoe, “these thirdparty studies estimated that Pungarayacu contains between 4.5 billion bbl
(Petroecuador-ARCO) and 7 billion bbl
(Petroecuador) of oil in place.” Ulti-

Production plans
According to project plans, oil production will begin with 30,000 b/d,
eventually rising to 120,000 b/d of
9-14° gravity oil.
Ivanhoe plans to use its heavy-tolight (HTL) technology to upgrade the
heavy crude into grades of 23° gravity
crude. The viscosity-reducing technology is proprietary and patented but
unproven at commercial scale in the oil
industry. Modules as small as 10,000
b/d are being designed in San Antonio,
the company said.
“We look forward to demonstrating the substantial advantages of our
HTL process, which include enhanced
efficiency, significant environmental
benefits, and the economic production
of previously stranded petroleum resources,” said David Martin, a seasoned
Latin American geologist and executive
chairman and chief executive officer of
Ivanhoe Latin America.
Investment requirements are estimated to be $20 million during the
first year of the contract and a total of
approximately $110 million for the first
3 years of appraisal.
To recover its investments, costs and
expenses, and to provide for a profit,
Ivanhoe will receive from Petroproduccion a payment of $37/bbl of oil
produced and delivered to Petroproduccion.
The payment will be indexed quarterly for inflation, starting from the
contract date, using the weighted average of a basket of three US governmentpublished producer price indexes relating to steel products, refinery products,
and upstream oil and gas equipment.
Ivanhoe Energy Ecuador may elect
to receive its payment in oil, based on
market prices, Ivanhoe said.
The company said it is in detailed
discussions about Pungarayacu development partnerships with international oil
companies, including Asian companies.

rayacu field. That followed a statement
in August by Petroecuador Pres. Luis
Jaramillo who said that Ivanhoe would
start producing about 108,000 b/d of
heavy oil at the Pungarayacu field by
May 2009.
Such a time line seems highly optimistic, however. Ivanhoe said no field
work will begin until after 6 months of
environmental studies. The succeeding
3-year appraisal phase would involve
seismic surveys, drilling appraisal and
production wells, and conducting steam
injection tests of the various sands.
Nevertheless, a greatly underutilized
400,000 b/d oil pipeline to the Pacific
Coast port of Esmeraldas crosses Block
20, Ivanhoe noted.
New wells are required because
the 26 uncased core holes have been
plugged.
White et al. wrote in AAPG Memoir
62 that cumulative production from

Ecuador’s Oriente from 1972 through
1992 was 1.7 billion bbl from Hollin
and 1.17 billion bbl from the overlying Cretaceous Napo formation. They
estimated remaining recovery in the
province at 2 billion bbl in the succeeding 20 years, mainly from existing
fields and developments already under
way in the early 1990s.
Exploration on the block outside
Pungarayacu might raise its estimate of
oil in place to 15-20 billion bbl, said
Robert Friedland, executive chairman of
Ivanhoe.
In 2007, Ecuador rejoined the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries and has an assigned production quota of 520,000 b/d.
The country had a total output of
about 511,000 b/d in 2007, including
production by Petroecuador and private
oil companies operating in the country

BC’s Beaver River ﬁeld ﬂows gas from shales
The life of Northeast British Columbia’s Beaver River field may be extended
if initial flows from shale and siltstone
formations prove out in the Liard basin
field.
Two Canadian independent operators
reported an initial flow of 10 MMcfd
of sweet, dry gas at 3,000 psi wellhead
pressure on a 3-day test at the field’s
A-5 well.
The gas flow came from a brittle
layer, rich in dolomite, at the top of a
thick sequence of organic rich shale
after a series of minifracs and highpressure acid stimulations. The goal of
the exercise was to identify prospective
intervals for a future frac stimulation
program.
Pending regulatory approval, the
well will go on production by the end
of October, said Questerre Energy Corp.
and Transeuro Energy Corp.
Questerre Energy said, “While too
early to evaluate the full contribution from the Liard shales, these initial
results are well above our expectations.
With over 30 sq miles of prospective

acreage, existing infrastructure and
takeaway capacity, this remains an exciting opportunity.”
Questerre, which operates the field,
said the high flowing pressure associated with this well will likely reduce
production from the lower pressure A-2
and A-7 wells, limiting overall production gains.
Transeuro said it expects the gas rate
to decline initially and is confident it
will stabilize at commercial levels.
Beaver River field, 150 km northwest
of Fort Nelson, BC, is near the provincial border with Yukon and 100 km
east of the Horn River basin, which has
an emerging gas play in the Devonian
Muskwa and Evie shale.
A-5 is the third well to be put on
production from the shale-siltstone
intervals at Beaver River field, said
Transeuro. The intervals are collectively
more than 2,000 m thick and for classification purposes have been separated
into three major intervals.
The intervals are the Mississippian Mattson shale at 1,200-2,100 m,

Pluspetrol starts up Pagoreni gas-condensate ﬁeld
The Peruvian government reported
that the six-member Consorcio Camisea
has begun production of natural gas at
Pagoreni field on Block 56 in the Cuzco
region and part of the Camisea gascondensate project.
The consortium, comprised of Pluspetrol Peru Corp., Hunt Oil, SK Energy,
Tecpetrol, Sonatrach, and Repsol YPF SA,
said it will initially produce gas at six
wells on the block.
The consortium said Pagoreni means
an increase in the production of liquids
of as much as 45,000 b/d and an
increase in gas production from 500
MMcfd to 1.26 bcfd.
Gas is piped to the 450-MMcfd
Malvinas gas processing plant near the
Camisea fields and is then transported
to Pisco, where naphtha, propane, butane, and diesel are extracted.
The consortium said the launch of
production from Block 56 marks the exploitation of a new reserve of 3.4 tcf of
gas and 227 million bbl of NGL, increasing the Camisea reserves to 14.8 tcf.
Development of Block 56, in which
the consortium has invested some $850
million, is also being referred to as the
second phase of the Camisea project as
it is adjacent to Block 88, which went
into production in mid-2004.

Welcomed production
The Block 56 production will be
welcome in Peru, which is seeing demand growth for gas. In fact, demand
has grown so quickly that the pipeline
transporting gas from Camisea to the
capital region has reached capacity.
The pipeline is operated by a con44

sortium known as Transportadora de
Gas del Peru SA, or TGP. According to
the energy and mines ministry, TGP
has a contract to increase capacity in
the westbound pipeline to 450 MMcfd
from the current 290 MMcfd.
Earlier this month, the Peruvian
government awarded Conduit Capital
Partners LLC subsidiary Kuntur Transportadora de Gas, SAC (Kuntur), a
30-year concession contract to build a
southbound 700-km pipeline to carry
gas from Camisea to the port of Ilo in
southern Peru.
Development and construction cost
for the pipeline, known as the Gasoducto Andino del Sur (GAS), is estimated to
be $1.4 billion. Construction is due to
begin in 2010, with operations expected to begin by yearend 2012.
Conduit said the pipeline will
deliver “attractively priced gas that is
expected to help spur economic growth
in Peru’s southern region, which will
begin facing power shortages as soon as
2011.” ✦

Egypt
Gulf of Suez Petroleum Co., the joint
venture of BP PLC and Egyptian General

private Cairo operator, subject to final

ministerial approval.
Two shallow nearshore discoveries

partners to carry part of the costs of an
exploratory well in the Orphan basin
350 km east of St. John’s, Newf.
The well, to be drilled in 2009,
would be only the second well in the
basin (see map, OGJ, Aug. 8, 2005, p.
32). The first well, Great Barasway F-66,
was drilled in 2006-07 at a cost of
$200 million. Results are confidential.
A farmee would assume part of
Chevron and Shell’s costs to earn up to a
25% interest in the prospect and an option to earn an interest in the balance of
two licenses that total 4.2 million acres.
The licenses are in 1,500-3,500 m
of water, and the prospect is supported
by 3D and 2D seismic. ExxonMobil and
Imperial Oil Ltd. each hold 15% interests in the licenses.

Missouri
MegaWest Energy Corp., Calgary,
reported production of 50 b/d of heavy
oil from shallow Pennsylvanian sands at
its Marmaton River steam drive project
in Vernon County, Mo.
It is operating 40 producing wells,
13 steam injectors, a water supply well,
and a water disposal well in 10 acres.
Steam injection is to start in November
on an adjacent 10 acres with 24 producing and 10 injection wells.
Steam preheat at the Grassy Creek
project with 46 producers and 15 injectors on 19 acres was to begin Oct. 15.

Crude oil prices
hovered below $100/bbl
in fourth-quarter 2007,
keeping drilling crews
busy and motivating operators to invest in capiDrilling
tal-intensive projects. As
the prices rose through
2008, more new rigs were ordered and
day rates continued to increase. New
yards are under construction in India
and China, with nearly 200 newbuilds
filling order books.
Oil averaged $123.80/bbl in secondquarter 2008, then fluctuated wildly
in third-quarter 2008, from a high of
$147.27 on July 11 to $90.51 on Sept.
16, averaging $118.22/bbl.1 Turmoil
in the US financial system has some
analysts speculating about a looming recession and slowed demand for energy.
On Sept. 29, Deutsche Bank lowered
its 2009 New York oil price forecast
by 23% to $92.50/bbl because of the
economic crisis.1
High natural gas prices drive a lot of
drilling in North America, where there’s
a pipeline infrastructure
and established markets.
Prices have been sufficient to justify the cost
of hydraulic fracturing
gas-bearing shales, and
demand for frac services
has increased sharply as
operators pursue new
shale plays around the US
and Canada.
Operators of new
pipeline projects in Australia and elsewhere will
increase drilling in order
to maintain a steady supply of natural gas to feed
LNG trains (OGJ, Oct. 13,
2008, p. 45).
Improved technologies affect natural
gas drilling by reducing costs and
expanding the economically recoverable
resource base.

Worldwide activity
Worldwide drilling set a record in
August 2008, with 3,523 rigs operat-

ing, based on the Baker Hughes Inc.
international rig count (Fig. 1).2
The North American rig count
reached a historic high of 2,436 rigs
in August 2008, up 13% from a year
earlier and diverging from a pattern
set over the last 5 years (Fig. 2, Baker
Hughes). The seasonally cyclic trend,
in which drilling spikes in February, is
driven by Canadian operations.
Normally, drilling
falls off in March and
April, increases over the
summer, levels off in
August and September,
and then rebuilds to
a new peak in February. In 2008, however,
North American drilling has steadily
increased since April, and August drilling surpassed February (Fig. 2).
Baker Hughes Inc.’s international
rotary rig count (excluding North
America, Iran, and Sudan) reached a
record high of 1,102 rigs in June 2008,
up 8.6% from 1,015 rigs a year earlier

tional rig as active, it must have been
drilling at least 15 days during the
month. A rig is considered drilling if it
is “turning to the right” and has not yet
reached TD.2
The increase in international rig use
is mainly driven by gains in Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia Pacific.

are likely to usher in a long period of
ultradeep drilling (OGJ, Oct. 6, 2008,
p. 30). Petrobras has already spent more
than $1 billion drilling 15 wells in
the ultradeep presalt, announcing 10
discoveries.4
Petrobras indicated it would order
28 new rigs to develop the presalt plays,
beginning in 2013. If all 28 rigs are
delivered on schedule and fully utilized,
and each well takes 100 days to drill,
Simmons analysts say Petrobras could
theoretically drill 700 wells by 2024.4
In the Middle East, 289 rigs were
drilling in August, up 7% from a year
earlier. Most of this (89%) is land drill48

ing. Offshore activity decreased 11% to
32 rigs, but land drilling was up 10%,
to 257 rigs. Three countries have particularly active drilling programs: Saudi
Arabia, Egypt, and Oman. Saudi Arabia
had the largest share (26%) of rigs in
the Middle East, split 65 land frigs and
10 offshore. The second largest concentration (21%) was in Egypt (60 rigs,
split 49 land, 11 offshore). Oman was
running 55 rigs, all but one on land.2
Another cluster of countries includes Pakistan, with 25 rigs drilling in
August, Syria (20), Yemen (15), Kuwait
(13), Abu Dhabi (11), and Qatar (10).
There was minor activity in Dubai and

Jordan (2 land rigs each). Baker Hughes
discontinued counting rigs in Iran and
Sudan in January 2006. 2
Europe had 97 rigs operating in
August, split nearly evenly between land
(49) and offshore (48). Activity was
up 18% from 82 rigs working a year
earlier. Four countries accounted for
61% of the European activity: UK (24
rigs), Romania (18), Norway (17) and
Germany (10). Smaller fleets were running in Turkey (6 rigs), Hungary (5),
Italy (4), Netherlands (3), Denmark
(2), France and Poland (1 each), and 6
elsewhere.

about 7% over the year, with 257 rigs
working in August 2008, up from 241
in 2007. Land drilling (53%) slightly
leads offshore work.2
The most drilling activity in August 2008 was in India (80 rigs) and
Indonesia (63), accounting for 56%
of drilling in the region, according to
Baker Hughes.
Cairn India ordered two new supersingle AC-powered drilling rigs from
Weatherford International; the first
arrived in late September. Both will be

used in development drilling in Rajasthan, where Cairn has delineated several
oil fields (Fig. 4).
Significant fleets are also working
in Australia (29 rigs), China offshore
(24), Thailand (13), Malaysia (11), and
Vietnam offshore (9). Smaller numbers
are drilling in New Zealand (6 rigs),
Myanmar (5), Brunei and Papua New
Guinea (4 each), Japan (3), Phillipines
(2), and other places (4).
Drilling activity in Africa has
dropped about 9% from a year ago. In

August 2008, 62
rigs were drilling
in more than eight
African countries
and about 74%
of those were on
land.
About 37%
were at work in
Algeria (23 rigs)
and another 24%
in Libya (15 rigs).
Tunisia and Angola
each had 5 rigs,
Nigeria 4, Congo
3, Gabon 1, and
6 were working
elsewhere.2

SCORE ends
After acquiring Global Santa Fe Corp.
last year, Transocean Inc. has discontinued the monthly summary of current
offshore rig economics (SCORE). This
measure was initiated by Houstonbased offshore drilling contractor
Global Marine and was a useful measure of profitability. The calculations
compared the profitability of current
mobile offshore drilling rig rates to
the profitability of rates at the 1980-81
peak of the offshore drilling cycle,
when speculative
new rig construction was common.
In 1980-81, SCORE
averaged 100% and
new-contract day
rates equaled the
sum of daily cash
operating costs plus
about $700/day
profit/$1 million
invested.
Transocean is the
world’s largest offshore drilling contractor, controlling
146 mobile offshore
drilling units (MODUs), about 24% of
the global fleet.

US drilling
US drilling continues to increase as
operators continue to develop conventional plays and target new shale-gas
plays throughout the country.
RigData’s list of the top 50 operators,
based on footage drilled, shows that
they drilled 15,279 wells (including
6,911 directional wells) in the first 9
months this year, all deeper than 2,500
ft (Table 1). This is an 18% increase
over the 12,991 wells that the 50 top
operators drilled in 2007 (OGJ, Oct.
22, 2007, p. 41). And yet, those 15,279
wells represented only 44.2% of all the
wells drilled in the US through September 2008, while the 12,991 well starts
in the first 3 quarters of 2007 represented 50.7%.
The number of directional wells,
6,911, represented 45% of all wells
drilled. Three operators each drilled
more than 500 directional wells:
Chesapeake Operating Co. (922), Devon
Energy Production Co. LP (622), and
EOG Resources Inc. (549).
Five operators drilled 250-499 directional wells: Williams Production RMT
Co. (418), EnCana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc.
(406), XTO Energy Inc. (388), SEECO

Inc. (318), and BP America Production
Co. (298).
Fifteen of the top 50 operators
drilled wells with an average footage
of 10,000 ft or greater. Seven operators
drilled wells with an average footage of
12,000 ft or greater: Ultra Resources
Inc., Shell Rocky Mountain Production
LLC, Penn Virginia Oil & Gas LP, ExxonMobil Development Co., Samson Lone
Star LLC, Questar E&P Co., and Goodrich Petroleum Co.
RigData ranks Patterson-UTI Drilling Co. first in rig utilization among US
drilling contractors, but three Nabors
companies are listed separately (Table
2). Taking Nabors Drilling USA LP
(ranked second), Nabors Well Services
Co. (ranked 22), and Nabors Offshore
Corp. (ranked 24) as a single entity, and
the overall utilization would be higher,
273 rigs used, on average, each month,
compared with Patterson-UTI’s average
of 251 rigs.
Other top drillers, with an average
50 rigs or more in use each month, are:
Helmerich & Payne IDC ,171 rigs in
use; Grey Wolf Drilling Co. LP, 104; Unit
Drilling Co., 71; Pioneer Drilling Co.,
60; and Ensign US Drilling Inc., 51.

US rig counts are considerably
higher than a year ago. Table 3 shows
the 4-week average for all US rigs in
September 2008 was 2,018, up 13%
from 1,787 rigs a year earlier.
For the week ending Sept. 26, 2008,
the Baker Hughes rig count listed 1,912
rigs drilling in the US, while RigData
listed 2,315 working rigs (Table 3).
There were also 69 rigs (BHI; 114
RigZone) drilling off Alabama, Alaska,
California, Florida, Louisiana, and Texas.
Baker Hughes listed 14 rigs working
in Louisiana’s inland waters; Rigzone
reported 35 in Louisiana and 4 in Texas
inland waters. Baker Hughes rig counts
are more conservative, and only include
rigs “turning to the right.”

M&A, IPO
According to Forbes, 2008 is “on
pace to be the year with the least
number of mergers and acquisitions in
a decade.” Initial public offerings are
also scarce, it noted, with only seven
venture-backed offerings.5
On Sept. 30, Dow Jones VentureSource reported that in third-quarter
2008, returns from venture-backed
companies reached a new low, down

Petrobras has

MPF Corp. Ltd. announced that it filed
for insolvency protection under the

The “Multi-Purpose Floater” was designed to handle early production and
will be the world’s largest drillship.6

Looking ahead
There are no signs that the demand
for oil and natural gas will abate, and
continuing high prices should promote
continued drilling. Most analysts are
bullish on the broader energy cycle.
Most of the newbuilds for land fleets
and more than half of the MODUs
under construction (Table 4) are already
committed to contracts, so we may see
additional building as new plays require
rigs.
One of the most interesting areas to
watch will be offshore Brazil, which has
55 MODUs under contract and more
on the way. The rapidly expanding fleet
of ultradeepwater and harsh environment rigs will require thousand of
experienced personnel—how will we
get them?

Forecasts
On July 25, PSAC predicted drilling
activity will decrease 11% in 2008, in
an updated Canadian drilling forecast.2
The initial release of the 2008 forecast
in October 2007 projected 14,500
wells would be drilled in 2008. But
in April, PSAC revised this upward to
16,500 wells in 2008.3 The July update
reiterates the prediction of 16,500
wells, noting that this is still 11% fewer
than the total number drilled in 2007
(18,557 wells).
On Apr. 23, PSAC‘s Soucy said,
“While all the talk of late is centered on
the price of oil, it’s actually the price of
natural gas that affects the industry in
Canada, especially in Alberta.” With so
much focus placed
on the oilsands,

PSAC, Canada’s national trade association, represents more than 270
companies in the service, supply, and
manufacturing sectors of the upstream
petroleum industry. The Canadian Index
compiles the market performance of
the Top 30 (by market cap) Canadian,
publicly traded PSAC member companies (Fig. 1).
The data show a drop in the PSAC
index to about 140 at the end of September, from a high of 200 in midJune.4 The index in mid-September
was 30 points below its position a year
earlier (170), attributable to change in
the taxation regime in Alberta (OGJ,
Oct. 22, 2007, p. 50) and to general
downturn in the financial markets. This
was followed by a precipitous fall in
mid-September to a low of about 90 in
mid-October. This decline is not limited
to Canada; the Philadelphia oil field
index of US companies shows a similar
decrease.
Companies are added or removed
from the PSAC Top 30 list quarterly.

Drilling contractor mergers
Several Canadian drilling contractors
have acquired US-based fleets in the
past year.
In June, Calgary’s Savanna Energy
Service Corp. purchased five drilling
rigs and equipment from privately held
GreyStone Drilling LP for $59 million
($11.8 million/rig).5 All five of the
rigs are working in the Haynesville in
Louisiana and Texas.
Precision Drilling Trust is in the final
stages of acquiring Houston-based Grey
Wolf Inc., one of the largest US drilling
contractors. Based on footage drilled in
2007 and the size of its US land drilling
fleet (120 units), Grey Wolf is the fifth
largest drilling contractor, with a market
capitalization of $1.9 billion (OGJ, Sept.
1, 2008, p. 39).
The merger is worth $1.12 billion
in stock and cash, working out to $9.3
million/rig. Pro forma ownership of the
new company will be 75% Precision
Drilling and 25% Grey Wolf.
According to Precision Drilling’s
presentation at the Peters & Co. Ltd.

North American Oil & Gas Conference
on Sept. 11, the rationale for its merger
with Grey Wolf is to:
• Build high-performance rigs at
lower cost.
• Introduce superseries rigs to new
customers.
• Drill North American oil and gas
shales.
• Grow internationally, targeting
global oil.
The fleet of the combined company will include 371 drilling rigs,
19 newbuilds, and 229 service rigs;
second only to Nabors Drilling in North
America. Most of the new combined
fleet is in Canada (221 drilling rigs, all
service rigs). Another 147 drilling rigs
are in the US, as well as 2 in Mexico
and 1 in Chile, as of Aug. 22.

Fleets
Savanna Energy Services offers drilling services through three subsidiaries:
Trailblazer Drilling Corp., Lakota Drilling, and Akuna Drilling Inc. The average
age of the 104-rig fleet is less than 5
years. Drilling accounts for 80-85% of
the company’s revenues, and well-servicing 15-20% (through Savanna Well
Servicing).
According to Savanna’s secondquarter 2008 results, announced Aug. 5,
the company has expanded its rig fleets
into southern Saskatchewan (6 drilling,
8 well service) and the US (14 drilling).
Expecting a strong demand in 2009,
the company has also increased its 2008
capital construction program by $54.5
million to a total of $150 million for
the year. The new allocation covers four
additional heavy-duty double drilling
rigs, two double service rigs, drill pipe,
and other equipment, expected to be in
service by third-quarter 2009.
Savanna is enhancing its capabilities in deep directional and horizontal
gas and oil drilling and will have 108
drilling rigs and 72 well service rigs at
the end of the construction program.
Nearly half of the fleet (46 rigs) consists of hybrid drilling rigs, designed to
accommodate both coiled tubing and
conventional, jointed, Range 3 pipe

with automated pipe-handling equipment and top drives (Fig. 2).
Savanna drilled 4,586 wells with its
hybrid rigs in 2007, dominating the
sub 2,000-m market in Canada.6 Savanna’s market share increased to about
25% of all Canadian wells drilled in
mid-2007, up from 16% in mid-2005.
Trailblazer Drilling, one of Savanna’s
subsidiaries, designed the hybrid rigs in
2002, and the hybrid fleet now consists
of:
• 38 first-generation rigs (CT1500),
capable of drilling to 1,500 m with
27⁄8-in. coiled tubing or 1,200 m with
31⁄2-in. drill pipe.

CAODC attributed the positive revision to “increasing activity based on
renewed strength in commodity prices
and positive drilling results, particularly in the high profile [shale] plays
in Saskatchewan (Bakken) and British
Columbia (Montney).”
CAODC also predicted that the size
of the western Canadian drilling fleet
would decrease to 885 rigs by yearend
2008 and that rig utilization in 2008
would increase to 42%, up from 38%
in 2007.

Hurricane Ike swept through the gulf
Sept. 10-14, damaging and destroying
drilling rigs and production platforms.
On Sept. 16, the US Minerals Management Service reported that three jack
up rigs were destroyed, one jack up was
extensively damaged, and two rigs were
set adrift by Hurricane Ike. MMS also
reported that the derrick on BP’s Mad

MMS reported on Sept. 24 that 52 of
the 3,800 offshore oil and gas production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico
were destroyed by Hurricane Ike, up
from 49 platforms reported on Sept. 18.
Dozens of additional platforms suffered
moderate to extensive damage from
storm surge and wave action.

Lost jack ups
Contractors lost three jack up drilling
rigs: Pride Wyoming, Rowan Anchorage, and ENSCO 74.
Pride International had 11 jack ups
at work in the Gulf of Mexico and

Missing derricks
Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. had
8 jack ups and 10 semisubmersible rigs
in the gulf in September. One jack up,
the Ocean Tower, was extensively damaged during Hurricane Ike. It was drilling in Vermillion Block 245 for Chevron
but lost its derrick and drilling package.
The LeTourneau Class 53-S jack up was
built by Marathon LeTourneau in Vicksburg, Miss., and delivered in 1972.
BP Exploration’s Mad Dog spar
platform was installed in 4,734 ft water
in Green Canyon Block 782 and began
production on Jan. 13, 2005. BP operates Mad Dog (60.5% working interest) on behalf of partners BHP Billiton
(23.9%) and Unocal (15.6%).
On Sept. 15, BP announced that the
derrick had been toppled by Hurricane
Ike and fell to the seafloor. Pride manages the Mad Dog drilling rig (Fig.1).

Failed moorings
Sugar Land, Tex.-based Noble Drilling had seven rigs working in the gulf;
two semisubmersibles drifted off location after their mooring systems failed
during Hurricane Ike. Both the Noble
Paul Romano and the Noble Amos Runner had been working for Anadarko. On
Sept. 15, Noble said that the mooring
system on the Noble Lorris Bouzigard
semisub was also damaged but the rig
did not drift.
Transocean’s Transocean Marianas
semisub drifted a few miles off location at Green Canyon Block 516 where
it had been drilling for ENI. Transocean
said the rig will need some repairs.
With nearly a month lost to delays
and damage from the two hurricanes,
spud dates will be delayed and drilling programs will probably need to
be modified. An uptick in demand for
platform decommissioning services is
also likely. ✦

ranking for each system and component. The frequency and intensity of
monitoring is then adjusted to achieve
an acceptable level of risk.
Adoption of risk-based approaches
in the petrochemical, refining, and
natural gas industries represents a shift
from reactive inspection and maintenance methods (Table 1).
In the long-term, an effective riskbased approach should substantially
reduce maintenance and inspection
costs because inspection focuses instead
on those components and systems most
likely to fail and most likely to have
significant consequences. In the shortterm, however, inspection and maintenance costs can actually increase when
the current condition and history of the
plant’s systems are scrutinized.

Risk-based approach
At the core of any risk-based approach is developing risk rankings for
process units or individual equipment
items such as piping circuits, tanks, or
pressure vessels. A simple qualitative
approach provides

mented written schemes of examination, the inspection program, and data
acquisition program.
Because the release and outage
problems were well documented at
the refinery, this historical data helped
identify the units subject to the most
common upsets. The inspection program then focused on implementation
in the highest-risk units first.

Key tasks
Establishment of any RBI program is
difficult. For this program’s implementation, 12 dedicated plant integrity specialists, including engineers, inspectors,
and technicians, were employed in the
refinery’s inspection organization.
Major specific tasks conducted during implementation of the refinery’s
RBI program were:
• Identification of factors contributing to likelihood or consequence of
failure:
–Local environmental factors. These are
degradation mechanisms that could
affect the loss of containment or overall
performance due to local environmental
factors (temperature, humidity, etc.).
–Possible failure mechanisms. Each system
component has known failure mechanisms and remediation methods.
–Effects of multiple failure mechanisms due
to local conditions, such as seismic stress or brittle
failure.
• Evaluation of risk to meet safety,
environmental, and economic objectives:
–Calculation and ranking of the total risk at
each refinery unit.
–Establishment of the RAL.
• Development of the specific
inspection program for each unit to
achieve the RAL:
–Determining which items are critical and
essential for monitoring.
–Establishing repeatable, credible, and welldocumented inspection methods to enable the
refiner to predict corrosion rates and evaluate fitness
for service (FFS).
–Inspection and maintenance planning. Assessing FFS outcomes (multidisciplinary engineering
analysis), remaining life, turnaround data and
extent, and next inspection dates.

• Program implementation:
–Installation and entry of all data into a commercially available AIM RBI software system for
plant components and systems.
–Training of personnel in objectives, policies,
and procedures.
• Management of change process:
–Liaise with national legislators for a shift in
time-based inspection constraints.
–Documentation and approval for all inspection
process changes.
–Verify that the process is producing the
desired results.

Deﬁciencies
When program implementation
began, we identified several key deficiencies within the refinery. Some of
these deficiencies were present before
the components were initially put into
service. These included fabrication
defects, segregation, wrong materials
of composition, welding flaws, poor
fabrication techniques, and incomplete
and inaccurate records. We prioritized
these deficiencies with respect to risk
and developed remediation programs
for each.
Deficiencies resulting from the
components being on stream were
also discovered. Typical of these were
generalized corrosion, corrosion under
insulation, stress cracking, other metallurgical changes, pressure excursions,
and delayed maintenance. As with the
other deficiencies, we prioritized these
for remediation.

we addressed the refinery’s remaining
units.
When we addressed the high-risk
items, issues within the refinery began
to decrease. Once the program reached
its second year, unplanned releases
stopped and, therefore, the losses associated with them also ceased. In
addition, unplanned outages from all
sources were reduced by 92%.
One area where the RBI program
was most apparent was on the contingency budget for turnarounds. In 2006,
the budget and expenditures were $80
million. For 2007, the actual spending
was reduced to $26 million, representing a savings of $54 million. ✦

Battelle’s two-curve
method (TCM) fracture
arrest predictions for
X70 grade steels and
higher requires a correction factor for the predicPipelines
tions to be accurate and
useful for selecting pipe
steels. The first part of this article (OGJ,
Oct. 20, 2008, p. 52) examined three
correction factors: Leis, Wilkowski, and
Centro Sviluppo Materiali (CSM). This
concluding article will show the appropriate factor to be grade-specific.

Background

penetrating enough of the WT will
begin to propagate along the length
of the pipe.
If the pipe is operating at less than its
transition temperature (i.e., 85% shear
area transition temperature, SATT) in
the drop-weight tear test (DWTT), the
fracture will be brittle and will propagate at high speeds and possibly over
long distances (miles). If the pipe is
operating at greater than DWTT 85%
SATT, it will be ductile and the propagation or arrest will depend on its toughness (Charpy V-Notch impact energy,
CVN).
TCM contrasts the fracture speed
and pressure curves for a pipe with a
given toughness against the gas decompression speed curve and pressure

X70 data, demonstrating it to be the
most conservative of the three, with 5%
nonconservative propagate data and 0%
conservative arrest data. These results
seem extremely conservative, so much
so that the required pipe toughness may
be unavailable from mills.
Fig. 4 compares the correction factors for CSM, Leis, and Wilkowski. The
CSM correction starts as the highest
until a TCM CVN of 170 J is reached, at
which point the Wilkowski correction
becomes the highest. The Leis correction is the lowest of the three.
Table 1 summarizes the results of
the correction factor effects on the
X70 steels for lean and rich gases. The
table shows that as the conservativeness
of the correction factor increases, the
percentage of conservative arrest data
increases. The Leis factor appears to be
about right for the X70 control-rolled
steels examined, based on the observation that it lies between the nonconservative and conservative data.

X80 predictions
The balance of this article will
discuss the factors that control fracture
arrest for X80 pipe and address application of the existing formulations to
predicting the arrest toughness of X80
pipe. Available X80 burst test data all
involve lean gas. Applying the following
information to rich gas must therefore
be done with caution, as data from
X70-grade pipes showed the possibility that predicted arrest toughness may
have to be higher for rich gas than
had been determined for lean gas. The
predictions are also only valid for steels
exhibiting a relatively flat upper shelf in
the CVN curve.
All of the X80 data presented applies
to control rolled or thermomechanically
processed steels as did all of the X70
steel data presented previously. Table 2
shows the X80 tests performed. Table 3
summarizes the effect of the correction
factors on the X80 steels.

Table 3 offers two observations. The
various factors have a different effect on
the higher-grade pipe, suggesting that a
factor should be grade specific. The Leis
factor also does not have any conservative arrest data, while the Wilkowski
and CSM factors appear too conservative
with only 7% nonconservative propagate data points. Equation 3 shows a
proposed revision to the Leis correction
factor for X80 controlled rolled steels,
increasing the multiplier from 0.002 to
0.003.
It would be nice to have zero
nonconservative and conservative data
points, but the present status of predictive capabilities coupled with the
variability in toughness properties leads
to scatter in the full-scale test results
that cannot be eliminated. This suggests
that a correction factor averaging the
nonconservative propagate data and the
conservative arrest data is about as good
as can be expected.

Not every length in a pipeline has to
arrest a fracture for fracture control to
be achieved. Specifying the predicted
TCM arrest level as a minimum value
for a pipe order will ensure all pipe has
a toughness level that exceeds the minimum specified value.

Quenched, tempered
The final assessment is based on X80
quenched and tempered steels. Having only 11 data points minimized the
scatter. Figs. 5-8 show a comparison of
the measured CVN energies of the pipes
in full-scale tests vs. the TCM predicted
CVN arrest energies. With the few data
points available, even the uncorrected
data are in reasonable agreement. But
the X80 control-rolled-steel results
demonstrate the need for a correction
factor. ✦

Rig activity scheduler software updated
The latest version of rig activity scheduler (RAS) software—Version 3.0—promises to help take the guesswork out of assigning rigs to wells and enables upstream
operations to utilize drilling, completion,
and workover rigs more efficiently.
With new features that provide decision
support, RAS 3.0 incorporates an automated, interactive capability for scheduling complex drilling operations. Rigs are
assigned to wells with a drag-and-drop interface that links drilling activities to userdefined key performance metrics, such as
production output, rig budgets, and well
completion dates. As operating conditions
change and revisions are needed, users can
develop and evaluate multiple scenarios
before selecting the most appropriate
course of action. RAS 3.0 features include:
• An advanced rig cost model, allowing multiple contract, availability date, day
rate, and transportation cost information
to be incorporated into drilling plans and
schedules.

• GIS integration, to support rig transportation computations based on multiple
factors, including the available road network, transportation speed, and movement
restrictions.
• Support for well availability-unavailability intervals, to accommodate restrictions because of weather and wildlife.
• Enhanced auditing and security
capabilities.

SUCCEEDING In A Changing Environment
As the industry shifts to deeper water, the environment in
which we work becomes more complex, hazardous and
expensive. Successful companies recognize early the
changing conditions and environmental challenges facing
the industry. At the Deepwater Operations Conference &
Exhibition in 2008, participants and attendees will discuss
how to succeed under these extreme conditions.

Plan to attend, sponsor and exhibit at the 2008 conference
and exhibition as the technical focus shifts to “Succeeding
in a Changing Environment.” As with our past conferences,
proceedings will not be published and the press will not be
invited to assure conﬁdentiality between the attendees and
the speakers allowing the most up–to–date information to
be shared.

The Next Generation of Deepwater Challenges
Plan now to join industry colleagues and conference host
Woodside Petroleum for the 20th Deep Offshore Technology (DOT)

International Conference & Exhibition 3 – 5 December 2008 in
Perth, Australia.
E&P operations offshore Australia encounter the full scope
of technology challenges – deepwater conditions, remote
ﬁeld locations, deep gas development challenges, hostile
environments, seaﬂoor issues, difﬁcult currents, ﬂow assurance
issues, long distances from infrastructure, logistical challenges,
isolation from heavy lift and installation vessels – you name it
and Australia has it all.
This year’s DOT addresses virtually every technology issue that any
deepwater operator will ever have to face. Plan today to exhibit,
sponsor and attend this exciting event, along with the industry’s
leaders and brightest minds in this unique technology showcase.

Supply cuts key
to how far oil
prices plunge
With equity markets gyrating and
economies in peril, attention gravitates to
demand in questions about oil prices. But
no one should overlook supply.
That’s not to say demand has lost importance. The International Energy Agency now
expects global oil demand to average 86.5
million b/d this year, up only 0.5% from last
year’s level. That’s 240,000 b/d less annual
average demand than IEA projected last

month. At the beginning of this year, IEA
was projecting global oil-demand growth
for 2008 of 2.3%.
As demand unravels, crude oil prices
plunge. In New York futures trading, marker
crude fell below $70/bbl to a 14-month low
Oct. 16. That’s half its level of only 3 months
ago. The question of the day: How low
will crude prices go? The answer depends
greatly on supply.
And supply depends ﬁrst on action by
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries. The group’s rescheduling of an
extraordinary meeting to Oct. 24 from Nov.
18 signals a production cut. The only question, which group members already may
have decided, is how much. Beyond OPEC’s
production response lie supply reductions
emanating from the same economic malaise that’s slashing demand.
Constrained credit has become a new
limit on oil industry investment.
“In the upstream,” IEA notes in its October Oil Market Report, “this will intensify
the impact already accruing from access
restrictions, tightening ﬁscal barriers, and
manufacturing/service capacity constraints.
In short, expanding production capacity, even in line with moderating demand
growth, becomes more difﬁcult.”
Investment difﬁculties will hit small independent producers and possibly several
Russian operators hardest, IEA says. Most
large international companies and state
producers will survive; those with heavy
debt will have trouble. Rig orders may be
cancelled. A new phase of industry consolidation is likely.
“A cash liquidity crisis also affects storage, reﬁning, and trading activity,” IEA says.
“Oil market liquidity itself is already suffering, so underlying price volatility could
persist, or even increase, in the months to
come, something that further complicates
investment planning for the future.”
Supply constriction thus looms—from
OPEC and from curtailed investment.
Atop those two joists rests the next
price ﬂoor.

OPEC regains market attention
Although the faltering economy has been driving down energy prices in recent
months, the November US crude contract rebounded $2 to $71.85/bbl Oct. 17 on the
New York Mercantile Exchange in anticipation that the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries would cut production at its Oct. 24 meeting in Vienna.
Thanks to some of the largest 1-day price losses in NYMEX’s history, front-month
US crudes have recently traded for less than half of the record $147/bbl that they
commanded in July. Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland, noted US crude
fell as low as $68.57/bbl in intraday trade Oct. 13-17, ﬁnishing down $5.85/bbl at the
end of that business week. Heating oil lost $3.24/bbl in the same period, while the
contract for reformulated blend stock for oxygenate blending (RBOB) was down
$5.92/bbl. Jakob said, “On the other hand, natural gas gained 3.9%.” North Sea Brent
crude for December was down $6.22/bbl for the week.
The average price of OPEC’s basket of 13 benchmark crudes gained 48¢ to $63.82/
bbl Oct. 17 but was still down $8.85/bbl from the Oct. 10 closure. Thus far this year,
the OPEC basket had averaged $106.13/bbl, up from $69.08/bbl for all of 2007. Days
before the meeting, OPEC Pres. Chakib Khelil said a production cut was “very likely”
since global supply exceeded demand by 2 million b/d. OPEC earlier lowered its
outlook for world oil consumption by 450,000 b/d to 87 million b/d.
OPEC would not have moved its meeting from mid-November to Oct. 24 “if it had
not already decided on a cut,” Jakob said. “Everyone these days is getting a rescue
plan and OPEC has decided it also wants one.”
At Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co. Inc. (FBR) in Arlington, Va., analysts were
expecting a 1 million b/d reduction going into the meeting. “But we question
whether weaker producers will be able to adhere to their quota during a downturn,
particularly as additional cuts are likely to be required,” they said. They estimated
Saudi Arabia alone could reduce production by 1 million b/d “as long as the OPEC
barrel fetched an average price of $60/bbl in 2009. By contrast, our estimates suggest Iran must earn $74/bbl in 2009 if exports fall even 100,000 b/d (to 2.4 million
b/d),” they said.
Paul Horsnell, Barclays Capital Inc., London, said OPEC is likely to cut more than
is necessary for the medium term, if prices are to be stabilized in the short run. “A
cut of 1 million b/d with the potential for more cuts to come looks like a feasible
starting point for discussions,” he said.
Adam Sieminski, chief energy economist, Deutsche Bank, Washington, DC, said,
“We believe OPEC production cuts are inevitable in this environment, but the experience of 1998 and 2001 suggests the cartel will struggle to cut production as fast as
world growth is slowing.” He added, “We now expect global gross domestic product
growth to slow to 1.2% in 2009, and that this will translate into ﬂat to declining oil
demand. Energy and industrial metals commodities will be major casualties in this
environment.” As a result, he said, “We expect oil prices will average only $60/bbl
and could bottom out at $50/bbl in 2009 or early 2010.”
Industry reductions
Having already lowered its 2009 rig count forecast last month, Raymond James &
Associates Inc. in Houston cut it again because “the economic situation has severely
deteriorated,” analysts said. “Additionally, reported US natural gas storage injections
remain bearish despite more than 200 bcf of hurricane-related production shut-ins in
the Gulf of Mexico.” As a result, they said, “We now anticipate the US rig count will
fall by more than 10% year-over-year in 2009 with a 40% peak-to-trough decline in
the natural gas rig count. We expect the overall domestic rig count to fall 30% from
its highs.”
Raymond James expects US natural gas prices to remain depressed until late
2009 with the rig count hitting bottom in mid-2010 at an average 1,500, down 12.5%
from 2009. “Between the reduced cash ﬂows, the credit crunch, and the simple need
to remove excess natural gas supply, we see no real way out of a severe slowdown
in natural gas-directed activity in the US,” they said.
FBR reduced its 2008 crude price forecasts to $105-110/bbl from an average $115/
bbl previously. It lowered its 2009 outlook to $80-95/bbl, from an earlier pick of $110/
bbl. Its 2010 projection is now for $70-$85/bbl, a “new downside” from the former
estimate of simply $85/bbl. FBR’s long-term estimate for 2011 and beyond is at
$80-90/bbl.

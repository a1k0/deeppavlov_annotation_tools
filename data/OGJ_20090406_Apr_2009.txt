SEC ﬁles charges in oil investment scheme
The US Securities and Exchange Commission charged a Los Angeles man and two of his companies with securities fraud on Mar.
24 and moved to halt their oil and gas investment sales.
The commission obtained an emergency court order from a
federal district court in Los Angeles to freeze the assets of Clement
Ejedawe, also known as Clement Chad, and his companies, Innova
Energy LLC and Innova Leasing & Management.
SEC said in its complaint that Ejedawe and his companies raised
$1.3 million from 30 investors by promising guaranteed returns
on working interests in oil and gas leases or drilling equipment. In
fact, it continued, the money was used to pay sales commissions;
small amounts to complaining investors; and Ejedawe’s personal
expenses, including cash withdrawals, his apartment rent, and donations to his church.
The complaint said that since December 2006, the defendants
solicited investors by cold-calling them from a Los Angeles boiler
room where they said money would be invested in oil and gas lease
or equipment working interests and promised monthly payments
of $4,000-5,000 for every $50,000 invested.
SEC said that in their solicitations, representatives did not disclose that Ejedawe is the subject of at least seven separate ceaseand-desist or desist-and-refrain orders relating to his unregistered
offering of securities, including orders from California, Alabama,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Kansas, and Washington.
SEC said a hearing on whether a preliminary injunction will
be issued against the defendants is scheduled for Apr. 6. It also is
seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement, and civil penalties
against Ejedawe and the Innova entities.

Pence to lead GOP Energy Solutions Group
US House Republican Conference Chairman Mike Pence (Ind.)
will chair the House GOP American Energy Solutions Group, House
Minority Leader John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said on Mar. 30.
The group will work on crafting Republican solutions to reduce
energy prices for American families and small businesses, Boehner
said.
“As gasoline prices skyrocketed to record levels last summer,
Republicans consistently advocated an all-of-the-above strategy to
create up to 1 million new jobs in the United States by increasing
American energy production, encouraging greater efficiency and
conservation, and promoting the use of alternative fuels,” he said.
“Rep. Pence showed extraordinary leadership last summer during Republicans’ historic [gasoline] price protects, and I know he
is dedicated to developing solutions to keep energy costs affordable
for all Americans,” Boehner said.
He said that Reps. John Shimkus (Ill.) and Fred Upton (Mich.)
will be cochairmen. Other members include Joe Barton (Tex.),

ranking minority member of the Energy and Commerce Committee; Doc Hastings (Wash.), ranking minority member of the Natural Resources Committee; and Rob Bishop (Utah), who chairs the
Western Caucus.

European gas demand increases by 2.1% in 2008
Preliminary figures and estimates brought out by the European
Union of the Natural Gas Industry (Eurogas) indicate that total
natural gas consumption in EU27 increased by 2.1% in 2008 over
2007 from 506.4 billion cu m (bcm) to 517 bcm. The total number of gas customers connected to the EU27 gas grid rose 1% to
112.5 million customers.
The largest gas consumers by far were in the UK where consumption rose to 101.8 bcm from 97.6 bcm in 2007; in Germany,
where consumption fell to 85.1 bcm from 86 bcm in 2007; and
in Italy, where consumption fell to 82.8 bcm from 82.9 bcm in
2007.
On a lower scale, consumption increased in France to 47.4 bcm
from 45.8 bcm in 2007; in the Netherlands, up from 39.8 bcm to
41.4 bcm; Turkey to 36.1 bcm from 35.9 bcm; and in Switzerland
to 3.3 bcm from 3.1 bcm.
Although natural gas markets vary significantly from one EU
country to another, Eurogas believes some general trends may explain the overall increase. The main one is that the weather was
mild in 2007 but rather cold in 2008 which, in addition, was a
leap year of 366 days.
Overall the residential sector registered stable consumption resulting mainly from a trade-off between generally colder weather
and energy savings. So the increase in gas consumption could be
attributed to high demand in the power sector due to favorable gas
prices compared with oil and coal. However, in all EU countries,
there was a major slowdown in industrial demand in the last quarter due to the economic crisis.
Indigenous gas production increased 1.8% to 202 bcm over
the period, pulled along by the Netherlands’s 10.9% increase in
production and Denmark’s 9.4% hike, compensating for the downward trend in most other EU producing countries.
Indigenous production, nonetheless, covers the highest percentage of the gas supplied in the EU, covering 39% of the total
net supplies in 2008. The main external sources are Russia 25%,
Norway 18%, and Algeria 10%. Some 60% comes from fields in
Western Europe.

EPA: Global warming a threat to public health
In an action that appears to boost prospects for a federal global
warming emissions cap, the US Environmental Protection Agency
reportedly sent a proposal to the White House on Mar. 20 determining that global warming is a threat to public health and wel-

fare, US Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) said on Mar. 23.
“This finding will officially end the era of denial on global
warming,” Markey said. “Instead of allowing political interference
in scientific and legal decisions, as was the case in the previous administration, the Obama administration is letting the sun shine in
on the dangerous realities of global warming,” added Markey, who
chairs the US House Select Committee on Energy Independence
and Global Warming.
An EPA spokeswoman confirmed the proposal’s existence and
its delivery to the White House, but said it was an internal document, which the agency developed in response to a US Supreme
Court directive.
“If the proposal is issued, it will undergo public comment and

public hearings before it becomes final. The document does not
propose any requirements on any sources of greenhouse gas emissions. The proposed finding does not impose any new regulatory
burdens on any projects, let alone those funded under the American Relief and Recovery Act,” she said.
Markey, however, said that he and Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.) are drafting climate
and energy legislation to control emissions that cause global warming, and an endangerment finding by EPA would send a strong
signal to companies and industries pumping heat-trapping pollution into the atmosphere that they will have to curb such emissions. ✦

ExxonMobil to probe Orinoco trend in Llanos

Maurel & Prom discovers oil in Gabon

ExxonMobil Corp. plans to begin exploring an extension of Venezuela’s Orinoco heavy oil belt in far eastern Colombia in 2009.
The company in 2008 was awarded a technical evaluation
agreement on Block CPE-3 covering 6.4 million acres in a remote
and unexplored area of the eastern Llanos basin on trend with the
Orinoco belt.
Exploration is to start with 2D seismic surveys. This region is
400 miles east-northeast of Bogota and almost as far south-southwest of Caracas.

Maurel & Prom, Paris, reports the OMOC-1 well on the Omoueyi permit in southern Gabon on test stabilized at 1,000 b/d of oil
from an 11 m interval in the Cretaceous Gas de Base formation,
confirming the permit’s potential and reinforcing exploration efforts. The well targeted the Kissenda and Base sandstones, which
produce oil at Omko and Onal, respectively.
Pay thicknesses are 40 m in the Kissenda and 14 m in the Base.
Maurel & Prom is testing a 6-m interval in the lower Kissenda formation and plans to test a 24-m interval in the upper Kissenda.
OMOC-1 reached a depth of 1,020 m. The well is south of the
Onal production permit and 9 km from the production center.
Maurel & Prom also reported that its Mafia Deep-1 well in Tanzania is not a commercial gas discovery at this stage.
Gas plugs were found at 3,950 m, and the well currently is
4,914 m deep. After reprocessing seismic data, the company said
the well’s main objective is expected in about 150 m, representing
10 days under normal drilling conditions.
“The sandstone beds that may be the origin of the gas breakthroughs observed total approximately 20 m,” it added.

Noble Energy discovers more gas off Israel
Noble Energy Inc. discovered natural gas at the Dalit prospect
30 miles off Israel on the Michal license with a well drilled to
12,000 ft in 4,500 ft of water.
Formation logs identified more than 110 ft of net pay in a highquality reservoir. Dalit is Noble’s second subsalt, lower-Miocene
discovery in the Levantine basin.
Production testing will be performed at Dalit after the well is
completed. Subsequent to testing, the rig will return to the Tamar
discovery in the Matan license to drill an appraisal well designed to
better define Tamar (OGJ, Feb. 9, 2009, p. 39).
Charles D. Davidson, Noble Energy’s chairman, president, and
chief executive officer, said Noble Energy plans to start its production from this new region in 2012.
“Based on results from the seismic program, we could see further exploration in the region starting in the second half of 2010,”
Davidson said.
Noble Energy operates both the Michal and Matan licenses with
a 36% working interest. Other interest owners are Isramco Negev 2
with 28.75%, Delek Drilling with 15.625%, Avner Oil Exploration
with 15.625%, and Dor Gas Exploration with 4%.

Lundin buys into Krabbe discovery
Lundin Petroleum AB has acquired from Talisman Energy Norge
AS a 40% interest in production license 301 north of Ula field in
the southern North Sea. The license holds the undeveloped Krabbe
oil discovery.
The value of the transaction was not disclosed. This transaction
is subject to government approval.
Lundin plans to tie in Krabbe and its nearby Nemo discovery
in PL148 to existing nearby facilities as a subsea development so
it can improve efficiency and lower development costs. “The two
discoveries are of similar type and size,” Lundin said. ✦

Lurgi – your clean conversion partner.
Lurgi is the worldwide leading partner when clean conversion is postulated. We command
sustainable processes which allow us to make better use of oil resources or biomass than
ever before.
With our technologies we can produce synthesis gases, hydrogen or carbon monoxide: for
downstream conversion to petrochemicals. Based on resources like natural gas, coal and tar
sand we produce synthesis gas which we convert into low-pollutant fuels.
Enhanced sustainability: from biomass which does not compete with the food chain, we
can recover ultra-pure fuels burning at a low pollutant emission rate which are excellently
suited for reducing the carbon footprint. You see, we are in our element when it comes to
sustainable technologies.

spinoffs for land-based activities in the north of Norway,” said
Anita A. Stenhaug, vice-president of Norne operations.
“Alve is a pilot project for submitting a simplified plan for development and operation for satellite fields,” said Kjell Helge Eide,
manager for the development project. “This procedure has now
been adopted in development projects for other such fields.”
Alve is in production license Block 159B, about 16 km southwest of Norne. The field embraces the Garn, Not, Ile, and Tilje formations. Proved reserves are in Garn and Not.
Alve is expected to produce 4 million cu m/day of gas. Reserves
are estimated at 6.78 billion cu m of gas and 8.3 million bbl of
condensate.
The Alve licensees are operator StatoilHydro 85% and Dong E&P
Norge 15%.

BP awards Caspian Sea Chirag project contract
BP PLC, on behalf of Azerbaijan International Oil Co., awarded
KBR Inc. a front-end engineering and design (FEED) contract for
the Chirag oil project in the Azerbaijan section of the Caspian Sea.
The Houston-based engineering, construction, and services
company will provide FEED and procurement support services
for a single, large drilling platform that will tie in to existing

Kuwait cancels fourth reﬁnery at Al Jour
Kuwait Prime Minister Sheikh Nasser Mohammad al-Ahmad
al-Sabah reported that the country has canceled plans to build a
630,000 b/d fourth refinery at Al Jour on the Persian Gulf coast
near the Saudi Arabia border. He said an Audit Bureau study deemed
the project unfeasible.
The refinery, earlier expected to cost $10 billion but later raised
to $15 billion and rebid, had been scheduled to start in 2013 (OGJ,
Nov. 12, 2007, p. 32).
Work on the grassroots refinery, which would have produced
low-sulfur fuel oil for the country’s power plants, was officially
halted at the council of ministers’ Mar. 23 meeting after contractors
had been notified.
Kuwait National Petroleum Co. had awarded engineering, procurement, and construction contracts in May 2008 to four South
Korean companies and a Japanese firm. Fluor Corp. was project
manager and front-end engineering and design consultant, and
Foster Wheeler was the feasibility study consultant. Fluor said it
was notified Mar. 20 of its contract cancellation. It will reassign the
300 engineers working on the project.
The other contractors notified included Hyundai Engineering &
Construction, which had a contract for $1.12 billion for offshore
facilities; a consortium of Japan’s JGC Corp. and Korea’s GS Engineering & Construction, $4 billion for main unit construction;
Daelim Industrial, $1.184 billion; and SK Engineering & Construction, $2.06 billion. GS Engineering was to have provided equipment.
The project was referred to the Audit Bureau for investigation in
August following allegations by opposition members of Parliament
(MPs) that the bidding process was flawed and that the contracts

This is the next stage in the Chirag oil project development, including incremental expansion of existing ACG field development.
KBR has been involved with the development of the ACG project
since 1995. Work on the project is under way.

E.On starts production from Rita gas ﬁeld
E.On Ruhrgas UK North Sea Ltd. has started natural gas production from Rita field in the UK North Sea via a subsea development
tied back to Hunter field, which the company operates.
E.On Ruhrgas did not disclose Rita’s likely output. The field is
connected to Hunter by a 14-km pipeline. This is the first time a
dual lateral well was drilled in a Carboniferous reservoir in the
southern gas basin, the company said.
“Each leg was drilled as a 6-in. hole and has a horizontal length
of more than 800 m. Gas is exported via the CMS infrastructure to
the Theddlethorpe gas terminal on the UK’s east coast, where the
gas is supplied to the UK market,” said E.On Ruhrgas.
Rita field lies on Blocks 44/21b and 44/22c. E.On Ruhrgas UK
operates the Rita field and has a 74% equity share. Coventure partner Gaz de France Suez E&P UK Ltd., meanwhile, holds a 26%
share.
Development approval for Rita was granted in early 2008. ✦

should have been awarded through the state-run Central Tenders
Committee (CTC) to ensure transparency.
The outcome of their report was not published, but local media
and MPs said the bureau concluded that the project was “technically and economically not feasible” and that future such project
tenders should go through the CTC.
This is the second refinery proposal the country has scrapped
in 4 months. In December, Kuwait dropped plans for a $7.5 billion partnership with US Dow Chemical after pressure from MPs,
which cited “high cost amid the global economic downturn.”

France struggles to meet 10% ethanol deadlines
The introduction in all service stations in France of the new
“green” unleaded gasoline, incorporating 10% ethanol instead of
the current 5%, will take longer than initially expected.
However, Jean-Louis Schilansky, president of the oil trade group
UFIP, told a press conference held Mar. 24 to launch the E10 that
75% of France’s service station network should be selling it by
yearend.
The pace will be consistent with the logistic and technical
problems encountered by oil company operators, independents,
and supermarkets. Ethanol must be moved by truck rather than
by pipeline; existing oil depots and service station tanks must be
adapted to the new unleaded; and service stations must either sacrifice one pump to deliver it or, if a large service station, use one
that was used to deliver other unleaded gasolines.
While BP retained its own depots when it sold its Lavera refinery and will be able to have all its service stations ready with E10 by
the end of April, Shell has no access to any depots. It sold its three
refineries last year and relies on the speed at which the new owners

can accommodate its needs.
Total expects to have some 300 service stations delivering E10
the first fortnight in April and will progressively have all of its
4,000 service stations in France ready during the year.
Esso also will gradually have its service stations ready but
doesn’t know how long it will take to deal with its own technical
problems.
All four companies told OGJ they are keen and willing to deliver
the “green” unleaded. They could refuse to do so but would have to

pay a polluting tax instead.
The E10 can be used only by automobiles sold after 2000 and
will only be really profitable for drivers when prices at the pump
are higher than they are now. The price difference currently is only
1-2¢/l., if at all, as drivers need more E10 to travel the same distance as vehicles using normal unleaded fuel.
The government’s purpose in introducing the E10 at least 5
years ahead of the EU is that is should reduce carbon dioxide emissions in France by 1 million tonnes/year by 2010. ✦

Cove Point LNG terminal starts up expansion
Dominion subsidiary Dominion Cove Point LNG, Richmond,
Va., recently started up its 1.8-MMcfd expansion of the terminal
on the Maryland shore of Chesapeake Bay.
The company said the project expands the terminal capacity by
80% and LNG storage capacity by nearly 100% to 14.6 bcf (equivalent).
New facilities include:
• Two 160,000-cu m LNG storage tanks.
• Increased vaporization and associated station facilities adding
800 MMcfd.
• An 81-mile, 24-in. OD pipeline in central Pennsylvania and
associated facilities that allow imported natural gas to move to US
Northeast natural gas markets.
• A 48-mile, 36-in. OD gas pipeline loop in Maryland that increases pipeline capacity from the terminal.
• Two new compressor stations near Perulack and State College,
Pa.
• Various natural gas storage facilities and pipelines that move
natural gas to Dominion’s South Point market hub, other interstate
pipelines, and the Leidy, Pa., interconnection with Transcontinental
Gas Pipeline.
A subsidiary of StatoilHydro ASA has contracted for all the new
capacity, including firm transportation and storage services in
Pennsylvania, said Dominion. The previously existing capacity was
already under contract.

Sakhalin Energy exports ﬁrst LNG cargo to Japan
Sakhalin 2 has sent its first LNG cargo to Japan via Energy Frontier LNG carrier for delivery at Tokyo Bay. The cargo holds 45,000
cu m for Tokyo Gas and Tokyo Electric.
The LNG was loaded through the 805-m-long jetty at the Prigorodnoye port, which was built for the year-round export of LNG
and oil.
“Russia has marked its entry into the Asia-Pacific LNG market,”
said Sakhalin Energy Chief Executive Officer Ian Craig.
The first train at the 9.6 million tonne/year liquefaction complex has begun production, and the second train is scheduled to
come on stream later this year.
“This year and 2010 will see a gradual ramp-up to full production capacity,” said Sakhalin Energy. “The newly built Sakhalin II infrastructure includes three offshore platforms, an onshore processing facility, 300 km of offshore pipelines and 1,600 km of onshore

pipelines, an oil export facility, and the LNG plant.”
Sakhalin’s LNG will serve consumers in Japan, Korea, and other
markets.
Shareholders in Sakhalin Energy are Gazprom with 50% plus 1
share, Royal Dutch Shell PLC with 27.5% minus 1 share, Mitsui &
Co. Ltd. 12.5%, and Mitsubishi Corp. 10%.

Dutch terminal to double fuel imports to Moldova
Netherlands-based EasEur Holding, owner of Moldova’s sole oil
products import terminal, expects shipments through the facility at
Giurgiulesti to double to 30,000 tonnes this year from the 14,899
tonnes shipped in 2008.
EasEur Vice-Pres. Thomas Moser expressed satisfaction with development of the terminal’s operations this year. He said the firm
has invested $27 million in the terminal, which became operational in August, yielding eight tanks with a combined storage capacity
of 63,600 tonnes.
Moser said EasEur Holdings expects a number of storage tanks
at the facility to be leased out to international oil trading companies in the coming months.
The terminal’s first incoming shipment last August was 4,000
tonnes of Euro diesel from the Motor Oil Hellas refinery in
Greece.
All products shipped by the terminal in 2008 were delivered to
EasEur Holding’s 23 filling stations in Moldova, according to the
economy ministry, which said that EasEur Holding plans to build a
total of 50 filling stations in the country.
Construction of the terminal was launched in 2006 by Azpetrol
SRL, Azpetrol Refinery SRL, and Azertrans SRL—the three Moldovan subsidiaries of Azeri oil company Azpetrol.
In June 2006 EasEur Holding, a subsidiary of Eastern Capital
NV, acquired the three Azpetrol subsidiaries and renamed them Bemol Retail, Bemol Refinery, and Danube Logistics.
Earlier this month, Moldova energy regulator ANRE said the
country’s imports of oil products, including diesel fuel and gasoline, last year rose by 3.4% to 565,000 tonnes and by value increased by 45.4% to $531.5 million.
Imports of diesel fuel rose by 5.2% to 350,000 tonnes/year,
while the volume of gasoline imports rose by 0.7% to 215,200
tonnes/year, ANRE said. It said Moldova’s LPG imports, which
were not included in the overall import figures, grew by 19% in
2008 to 60,100 tonnes. ✦

If Atlas shrugged
As an oil executive and an American,
I also find the course being pursued in
Washington, DC, to be energy suicide
(OGJ, Mar. 9, 2009, p. 68). I think it’s
time for Atlas to shrug.
I see Transocean is moving corporate
headquarters to Switzerland, and Noble
is reincorporating there and considering
a transfer of management. Maybe if ExxonMobil notifies Washington that it will
not be able to flourish under this lunacy
and will have to cease being a US-based
company, they’ll get it.

CNG vehicles have niche
Re: Nick Snow’s fine reporting of Sen.
Harry Reid’s press conference on compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles (OGJ,
Mar. 2, 2009, p. 28).
Our family owns and operates a
2004 Honda natural gas vehicle (NGV).
We love the car for its low operating
costs and its low local emissions. While
natural gas burns clean, the exploration, production, and transportation
require liquid hydrocarbons and coal;
NGVs only displace some of the pollution. Also, since our NGV has only a 200
mile range, my wife typically refuels it
every 2-3 days and rarely strays far from
the limited refueling stations. The fuel
economy (about 30 mpg) is less than a
comparably sized Jetta Diesel (about 40
mpg), and the expensive 3,600 psi tank
has a life expectancy of only 15 years.
We are also investors in oil and gas
exploration, drilling, and production—
investments with minimal return for the
risk, particularly at the present low prices. Our partners have had little success
in finding large gas fields, not surprising
when peak natural gas production in
the lower 48 states occurred 35 years
ago (1973). Based on this and on what I
understand about the short lives of shale
wells, I cannot be optimistic about longterm supply.
NGVs have a niche to displace diesel
and gasoline in local transportation: bus-

es, trucks, and fleet vehicles that never
stray far from a filling station and can be
filled overnight in their fleet garages, so
as not to overload the present infrastructure. Adding additional infrastructure
to fuel large fleets of NGVs may prove
wasteful and uneconomical if the supply
is not adequate for the next 30 years.
Remaining large sources of natural gas
are in unfriendly countries and would
have to be imported as LNG.
Decision-makers need to consult both
with people who have expertise and
experience in the day-to-day operation
of NGVs and with natural gas supply
specialists to intelligently determine the
wisdom of large-scale expansion of the
NGV fleet.

Stopping the juggernaut
For anyone in the oil and gas industry, the
spectacle of an American president sacking the
head of General Motors should be chilling. The
episode says much about Barack Obama and the
radicalism he brings to the presidency. He believes
in governmental control of free enterprise. He acts
eager to test at least the political limits of executive
authority. And, as the federal budget he proposed
to Congress shows, he dislikes the oil and gas
business.
Whether Rick Wagoner needed to be ousted as
GM’s chief executive is not the question here. The
question is whether the president of the United
States, and not the owners of the company, should
make and execute the decision. The answer is no.

Who owns GM?
Obama leads a government to which GM is
disastrously indebted. But neither he nor his government owns the company. The president used
the government’s status as emergency creditor to
arrogate prerogatives of corporate ownership. This
is supremely alarming.
For the oil and gas business, politicization of
GM is not just some other industry’s misfortune.
In his Mar. 30 announcement of plans for GM and
Chrysler, Obama said: “I am absolutely committed
to working with Congress and the auto companies
to meet one goal: The United States of America
will lead the world in building the next generation
of clean cars.”
GM thus is to become the instrument by which
the government will try to override markets and
steer US fuel consumption away from petroleum.
In perfect harmony with that strategy on the
demand side of the market is Obama’s Mar. 31
signing of a lands bill that forecloses oil and gas
supply from 2 million acres. Except for the early
rejection of windfall profit taxation, every policy
initiative on energy from the Obama administration aligns with the off-oil manifesto of environmental extremism.
Obama has made this veer toward btu bankruptcy part of a risky, state-centered makeover of
the economy, the prospective debt from which has
alarmed even members of his own political party.
And he predicates this liberal blitz on beliefs made
20

clear by pronouncements like this one, from a Mar.
24 press conference: “If we don’t tackle energy,
if we don’t improve our education system, if we
don’t drive down the costs of health care, if we’re
not making serious investments in science and
technology and our infrastructure, then we won’t
grow 2.6%; we won’t grow 2.2%. We won’t grow.”
Like so many from the new president, that
statement bejewels vacuity with elegant rhetoric. It
is, in fact, indefensible.
Energy, education, health, science, technology,
and infrastructure are vital national concerns. They
always have been and always will be. That each of
them has problems also is nothing new. Some of
those problems do need prompt attention.
But the economy can grow in spite of them,
and to suggest otherwise is exaggeration. The US
had the same problems during the 1980s and
1990s yet experienced unprecedented growth.
Indeed, the current economic crisis relates more
to financial dysfunction and global imbalance than
to anything in the formula of problems against
which Obama seeks to leverage socioeconomic
overhaul.

Other misdirection
This isn’t the only misdirection at work in
Obama’s power move. The president continually
holds up the unpopular presidency of George W.
Bush as the source of everything needing repair.
Yet what he’s really attacking is the market-centered, limited-government orientation of Ronald
Reagan’s presidency of 1981-89. It was Reagan’s
turn away from high taxation and government
activism that made possible an historic cycle of
growth. If anything, Bush helped weaken the
foundation of Reaganite prosperity with fiscal irresponsibility and market intrusion.
The US government has become a liberal juggernaut threatening harm not only to the oil and
gas industry but also to the national economy. The
only way to stop it is to discredit a flawed ideological core: the belief that government officials know
better than owners do how to run the machinery
of wealth creation. Obama has pushed oil and gas
into the center of an intellectual fight. The industry
must respond. ✦

Oil & Gas Journal’s semiannual
Worldwide Construction Update shows
a decline in construction activity compared with the previous edition of the
report (OGJ, Nov. 17, 2008, p. 24).
Many companies have delayed their
target completion dates for projects
reported to OGJ in previous surveys.
Some projects listed in the earlier report
have been canceled.
Following are project details
from the new survey, which is

Iraq considers PSAs in second licensing round
Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
Iraq is considering offering exploration blocks under production-sharing
agreements (PSA) this year for its second licensing round, according to Oil
Minister Hussain Al-Shahristani. Along
with other measures, the PSAs could
help the nation boost oil production
to 6 million b/d from 2.5 million b/d
over the next 6 years, he said.
Speaking at the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries’ recent
international seminar in Vienna, AlShahristani said there are 65 blocks that
hold oil and gas potential, but Iraq has
not yet decided which blocks to offer
under production-sharing contracts.
During his address, he said he wants
operators to invest $35 billion to im28

prove Iraq’s fields under the two current
bid rounds. Iraq wants “a fair market
share for crude oil and gas on the world
market,” he added. If its production
target is achieved, Iraq would be one
of the biggest producers in OPEC after
Saudi Arabia.
Iraq’s oil industry has been badly
affected by war and mismanagement.
For the second bid round, operators are being offered acreage under
service contracts, which are expected
to be signed by the end of the year
(OGJ Online, Dec. 31, 2008). Operators are looking at the fields: Majnoon,
West Qurnha Phase 2, Halfaya, Gharaf,
Badrah, East Baghdad, Central Euphrates
oil fields (Kifl, West Kifl, and Marjan),
Diyala oil fields (Qumar, Gilabat, Nau
Doman, and Khashim Alahmar), Naj-

mah, and Qaiarah. These are expected to
add nearly 2 million b/d of production
capacity with an estimated investment
of £20 billion.

New oil, gas law
Al-Shahristani said it’s not known
when Iraq’s new oil and gas law would
be approved by the parliament. The
law establishes a sector framework,
outlines revenue sharing, restructures
Iraq’s oil ministry, and creates an Iraqi
National Oil Co. The cabinet passed the
draft legislation in February 2007, but
differences over provisions and among
various political parties have blocked its
progress in parliament.
“We are proceeding with the bid
round; the ministry of oil has full authority to the round, and any contracts
that are signed will be presented to the

cabinet for approval,” Al-Shahristani
said. Gas production is a key tenet of
Iraq’s petroleum policy. It wants to raise
production to 70 billion cu m/year and
fully utilize associated gas to end gas
flaring by rehabilitating partially damaged gas processing plants in the south
and constructing new ones.
Plans to improve the gas pipeline
network by connecting gas fields
under development also need to be
implemented. Iraq aspires to become
a gas exporter by 2012. “An estimated
quantity of 7 billion cu m/year that is
regrettably flared now will be utilized
for power generation and other industrial usage,” Al-Shahristani said.
The third crucial objective is to raise
oil refining capacity to 1.5 million b/d
from 600,000 b/d to meet the expected increase in internal and external
demand, especially for light products.
By next year, two atmospheric distillation towers, with a capacity of 70,000
b/d, in the Durra and Basra refineries
are expected to be finished.
Five refineries with a total capacity of 840,000 b/d are to be installed
by 2015. These include Nasiriya with
a capacity of 300,000 b/d; Kerbala,
140,000 b/d; Missan, 150,000 b/d;
Kirkuk, 150,000 b/d; and East Baghdad, 100,000 b/d

IOCs neccessary
Al-Shahristani said relationships with
international oil companies (IOCs)
would be crucial in realizing Iraq’s
objectives, but with its revenues being
generated from the oil sector, low oil
prices are threatening future investment. A 60% fall from peak oil prices
last July has severely damaged Iraq’s
budget.
Contracts for successful operators in
the first licensing round are expected to
be announced at midyear. This was first
publicized last year with six giant producing oil fields requiring rehabilitation: Rumaila (north and south), Zubir,
West Qurna Phase 1, Misan oil fields,
and Kirkuk and By Hassan oil fields. The
fields’ production would have to be increased by 1.5 million b/d within 3-4

T

he international oil and gas
industry—as well as Russia’s—is
watching with incredulity as prosecutors bring a new case against
former OAO Yukos Chief Executive
Mikhail Khodorkovsky.
Can it really be happening again?
You bet it can, and with all of the
cloak-and-dagger stuff you’d expect
from a country run by Vladimir
Putin, a former KGB spy, and his
entourage—or should one say henchmen? In any case, Khordorkovsky
and Platon Lebedev, former head of
international financial organization
Menatep, suddenly found themselves
under way from their Siberian prison
and heading back to face the new
charges in Moscow.
The charges, which are about as
labyrinthine as one can imagine, are
not really worth talking about in this
space. They are simply the pretext
needed to get the two men back
into the public limelight for use as a
diversion from the country’s current
financial morass.

Good drama
You have to admit that it makes
good drama to have such a wealthy
man on trial when so many thousands—or perhaps even millions—of
impoverished Russians are emerging
from a frosty winter only to face an
economy in freefall.
If you think there’s any exaggeration in that, just consider the most
recent World Bank report that projects Russia’s gross domestic product
to shrink more than expected this
year—with ordinary people feeling
the shrinkage more than most.
WB’s latest report for Russia
forecasts its economy will shrink by

4.5% this year, or about 2.5% worse
than Russian officials had expected.
And they even see an upturn before
yearend. Worse, WB also notes that
Russia’s dependence on energy has
become a liability—along with its
reliance on capital inflows and borrowing abroad.
Klaus Rohland, WB representative in Russia, delivered the killer
observation, saying, “At this point in
the crisis, focus should shift to the
people and slightly away from the
financial sector because people are
now affected by the crisis.”

Clowns needed
Focus on the people? You mean actually do something that would help
the Russian people survive the crisis?
Hmmm...you can bet that probably
won’t be running through the mind
of Putin or his, uhm, entourage.
No, what they clearly have in
mind is a circus—especially if there
is no bread—and who better to provide the entertainment than prosecutors intimating that Khordorkovsky
and Lebedev are responsible for the
country’s financial woes?
Underlying the new trial, however,
is a point of real concern to Putin
and his government. Some time ago,
members of the Russian parliament
were considering a plan that would
allow Khordorkovsky his freedom for
time already served.
Could anyone imagine the kinds
of things the freed oilman—an
insider—could say about the Russian
government’s mishandling of the
industry? Such talk would clearly lead
back to high places, wouldn’t it?
In the absence of bread, bring on
the clowns! ✦

Saudi Aramco, in line with newly

continue to invest in new oil, gas, and
petrochemical projects, despite the
current global economic downturn,
according to government leaders and
company officials.
“We believe the elements [needed]
to succeed in this environment are
the ability to integrate petrochemicals
with refineries and gas plants, securing
feedstocks at competitive pricing, and
achieving higher efficiency on product chain integration,” said Abdulaziz

Brazil considering OPEC’s
renewed membership invitation
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Brazil’s President Luiz Lula da Silva,
apparently reversing earlier decisions,
said his government is again considering an invitation to join the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
“Very, very soon Brazil is going to
participate in OPEC,” said the Brazilian
president, according to Argentina’s Empresas News. If correct, the statement
would reverse earlier remarks by Lula,
who last year said he preferred Brazil to
export refined products, not crude.

The Brazilian president’s remarks
follow a Mar. 23 statement by Mines
and Energy Minister Edison Lobao, who
said the country was officially invited to
join OPEC, but that it should enter the
organization only when it effectively
becomes an oil exporter.
At the moment, he said, OPEC membership would not be possible as Brazil,
which consumes all of its own production and still imports oil, would not be
able to implement OPEC output cuts.
But Brazil could join once it has taken
care of domestic needs and begun to
export oil, he said.

The statements by Lula and Lobao
indicate a possible shift in policy, as last
September Brazil declined an invitation from Saudi Arabia to join OPEC,
citing plans to export refined oil, not
crude from its deep water reserves. At
the time, Lobao said Brazil determined
it didn’t need OPEC, because the Latin
American country planned to boost oil

income by refining crude into products
like gasoline for export abroad.
Petroleo Brasilerio SA’s Refining and
Petrochemicals Chief Executive Paulo
Roberto da Costa confirmed Lobao’s
remarks, saying, “Brazil was invited to
participate in OPEC and did not accept
because our priority is refining here
and exporting derivatives.”

Earlier that year, Lula also opposed
OPEC membership in favor of becoming an exporter of refined products.
“Brazil is going to be transformed
into a major producer. I do not want it
to become an exporter of petroleum,”
he said. “I want Brazil to export petroleum products” (OGJ, July 7, 2008, p.
37). ✦

technologies, low-carbon fuels, clean

The energy efficiency title aims to

global warming title would place limits
on emissions of heat-trapping pollutants, and the transitioning title would
protect US consumers and industries
and promote green jobs during the
transition to a clean energy economy,
Waxman and Markey said.

Cap-and-trade
The global warming title discusses a
possible cap-and-trade program. “One
key issue that the discussion draft does
not address is how to allocate the trad-

able emission allowances that restrict
the amount of global warming pollution emitted by electric utilities, oil
companies, and other sources. This issue
will be addressed through discussions

Other Democrats on the committee
applauded the proposals. Rick Boucher
(Va.) said it includes bipartisan legislation he introduced on Mar. 24 to
fund accelerated development of CC&S
technologies. “I am reviewing the provisions of the draft and will be consulting with interested parties, including
colleagues on the committee, regarding
changes which I will recommend for
the purpose of assuring the control program is economically sustainable and
will not be economically disruptive,”
Boucher said.
But the committee’s ranking minority member, Joe Barton (R-Tex.), was
not impressed. “Tuesday’s cap-and-trade
bill marks a triumph of fear over good

sense and science, and it couldn’t come

Barton said US unemployment stands
at 8.1%, with a rise to 8.5% expected,
and jobless rates already top 10% in
California, Nevada, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Oregon, Michigan,
Rhode Island, and Washington, DC. “So
it’s not surprising when the Gallup Poll
reports that 41% of Americans consider global warming an exaggeration.
I consider it a dangerous exaggeration
because it gives rise to plans like this
one, which increase unemployment and
raise electricity bills,” Barton said.

entities supposedly at the urging of
Enron Corp., which was an active energy trader at the time. By 2007, these
unregulated markets had grown to a
point that critics said showed speculators used them to circumvent regulated
exchanges and manipulate crude oil
and other commodity prices.

Impact on prices
When CFTC began to investigate,
it eventually concluded that information was insufficient about how price
swaps and other financial instruments
were being used to affect commodity
markets. It found, however, that these
financial instruments sometimes had an
impact on prices, and that they needed
to be regulated. Congress gave CFTC
authority to regulate them as part of the
2008 reauthorization act.
Acting CFTC Chairman Michael V.
Dunn said on Mar. 23 that the new rules
are a step in the right direction to make
ECMs more transparent and accountable
so participants and the general public
can be better protected.
“The final rules put in place the
framework in which we will exercise
our new authority to police these important contracts,” Dunn indicated. He
said the new rules incorporate several
changes:
• They revise information submission requirements for ECMs.
• They establish procedures and standards by which CFTC determines that
an ECM contract performs a significant
price discovery function.
• They provide guidance with respect to complying with nine statutory
core principals for ECMs with significant price discovery contracts.
• They amend existing regulations
applicable to registered entities in order
to clarify that such regulations now
apply to ECMs with significant price
discovery contracts.
CFTC said several commenters, in

Hard work for
Western Caucus

US

Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah)
was ready to give Ken Salazar
the benefit of the doubt. Then, during
the US Interior secretary’s first few
weeks in office, he canceled several
leases from a December onshore sale
in Utah, delayed preparation of a new
5-year Outer Continental Shelf leasing plan, and withdrew an oil shale
proposal solicitation.
The lease cancellations particularly disturbed Bishop, who is a
senior member of the House Natural
Resources Committee, because they
deprived Utah of $300 million in
federal royalties. “He didn’t just take
away leases. He affected people’s
lives; he took away jobs,” Bishop told
me on Mar. 20.
Bishop said Salazar’s actions were
part of a troubling trend. “There was
a lack of engagement early on, and
many people thought that the Obama
administration would take a moderate approach. With the stimulus
package, the proposed budget, and
Secretary Salazar’s actions, it’s obvious they plan to take the government
further left,” he said.
Bishop, who chairs the House’s
Western Caucus, said he and other
members are trying to develop
alternatives to the administration’s
proposals. He found the new oil and
gas taxes and fees “deeply troubling”
and suggested that using royalties
from increased production on federal
lands for an alternative technologies
development trust fund would be “an
orderly, logical process.”

Democrats, too
But he also said that any proposed compromises will need to be
bipartisan and to have Democrats’

support. Western Caucus Republicans
are working with oil-state Democrats
such as Gene Green of Texas and Dan
Boren of Oklahoma to educate federal lawmakers and their staffs about
modern oil and gas production, he
explained.
“It will take a lot of outreach and
education, more than simply standing up and screaming, to get more
people to understand what’s going
on,” Bishop said.
The problem isn’t limited to
members elected to their first terms
in 2006 and 2008, he continued. “A
lot of old members from urban districts don’t have a clue about what’s
going on. We want to take people
from the urban East and show them
the relatively minor impact an oil and
gas field has in comparison to a solar
or wind farm,” he said.

Still talking
Bishop said he’s encouraged that
the bipartisan spirit that brought
many House Democrats and Republicans together last summer to work
on Reps. John E. Peterson (R-Pa.)
and Neil Abercrombie’s (D-Ha.) OCS
proposal has extended into 2009.
“People on the floor are still talking
about doing something in a bipartisan way. The Obama administration is
the new player, and it isn’t interested
yet,” he told me.
“The energy issue hasn’t gone
away. We still have abundant resources
that are locked away. A unique situation forced prices down toward the
end of last year, but that won’t last.
We in the Western Caucus want to be
ready with viable alternatives when
they are needed,” Bishop said. ✦

US to see more LNG, despite downturn
Warren R.True
Chief Technology Editor-LNG/Gas Processing
More shipments of LNG will come
to the US this year, whether the market
needs them or not.
As much as 90 million tonnes/year
of new LNG supply will flow towards
global markets this year and next. With
current LNG markets in a balance never
before seen in world trade, the additional volumes must move somewhere.
That somewhere is the market of last
resort: the US. That market is already
adequately supplied, thanks to the recent surge in shale gas production.
These were some of the major trends
announced last month at Platts’ 8th Annual LNG conference in Houston.

US surge
For some time now, industry analysts
have predicted that excess cargoes of
LNG will find a home in the US, a
default location in an increasingly balanced global trade. As prices fall in Asia
and Europe, the argument goes, the
plethora of storage and the thoroughly
liquid market in North America will
attract shipments unable to fix destinations in the other two markets.
Waterborne Energy’s Steve Johnson
told the conference an average about 3
bcfd would arrive this year. Last year
saw a sharp decline from the record
volumes that arrived in 2007. While
predicting growth in LNG shipments in
the US for this year and next, Johnson
did not explain why this would happen, given that natural gas demand,
especially industrial and commercial,
has dropped off the table. US markets
are adequately supplied by domestic
production and Canadian imports,
complemented by what little LNG is
coming here to satisfy existing longterm contracts.

P L O R A T I O N

A number of external factors have
come together to provide many opportunities for growth for the fledgling
hydrocarbon industry in Paraguay. These
include higher gas prices regionally
coupled with increasing demand, particularly in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile,
all of which plan to import liquefied
natural gas at world prices and at great
capital cost.
Paraguay consumes the equivalent of
30,000 b/d of oil as refined products
such as gasoil, gasoline, lubricants, and
aviation fuel, all of which are imported.
It is hoped that with proposed drilling by CDS Oil & Gas Group PLC in
2009 there will be success in finding
oil in commercial quantities that can
be produced for refining at the government owned 7,500 b/d Petropar
refinery at Villa Elisa near Asuncion. This
would reduce refined product imports
and conserve hard currency.
If exploratory drilling for natural gas
by any of the active exploration companies proved up commercial volumes,
it might be possible to develop the gas
fields, provide gas for domestic use, and
build the pipelines needed to export gas
to nearby markets.

& DEVE

L O P M E N T

Lack of production
Many have wondered why Paraguay
has no oil or gas production.
They reason that the country should
be productive because hydrocarbons
have been produced for more than 75
years in Bolivia just to the west and for
more than 25 years at Palmar Largo in
Argentina a few kilometers south of
Paraguay.

Nonproducing Paraguay’s potential
conventional and unconventional
A combination of technical and
financial factors in Paraguay influenced
the oil companies that conducted the
exploration in years past not to continue their efforts. Some of them were:
1. They did not satisfy the parameters of the geologic model of the large
producing wells that they were pursuing.
2. They lacked the computer technology to interpret their exploration
results, as can be done today.
3. They had other interests to pursue

Exploration history
The first exploration well drilled for
oil in Paraguay was in 1947 and the latest in 2005.
In the intervening 58 years only 48

wells were drilled by several international oil companies and two private
Paraguayan companies (Fig. 1). During 1947-2008 the various companies
acquired 21,434 line-km of 2D seismic
data.
The Chaco basin is a large sedimentary basin located mainly in northwestern Paraguay and southeastern Bolivia.

The portion in Paraguay is minimally
explored.
Reprocessed seismic data since 2001,
recent concepts in seismic stratigraphy
and analysis, and interpretation of multiple data bases from several previous
operators allowed for positive revisions
to the geological model and hydrocarbon assessment of the Paraguayan
Chaco basin. The revisions confirmed
that five important aspects that are indicators of the potential presence of commercial hydrocarbons are present. These
are adequate hydrocarbon sources,
reservoirs, seals, trapping mechanisms,
and migration timing.

The incremental addition in Bolivia of more than 50 tcf of gas in
1999-2003 was partly the result of
government incentives and privatization
that are no longer in effect. The large
gas reserve additions were mostly in the
Carboniferous Escarpment, Tarija, and
Tupambi intervals, and also the Devonian Huamampampa formation.
New technology also resulted in first
production for Silurian and Cretaceous
oil pools, mostly northeast of Santa
Cruz, Bolivia. The source beds for these
new reserves are the Silurian Kirusillas
formation, the Devonian Los Monos
and Icla formations, and a very minor
Cretaceous oil source bed, the same
source beds as are present in the Chaco
basin of northwestern Paraguay.
Along the southwest boundary of
northwestern Paraguay, Cretaceous oil
production of 50 million bbl from 10
fields is sourced by an organic-rich

Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition
July 14 – 16, 2009
Calgary TELUS Convention Centre, Calgary, Alberta, Canada

Oil for tomorrow
THE PROMISE. THE PRACTICE.
Technologies developed for the oil sands and heavy oil resources of Alberta are vital to more than tomorrow’s oil supply.
They represent solutions to problems encountered throughout the oil industry.
Problems like managing costs during periods of lower oil prices, dealing with labor shortages, handling sulfur, controlling
air emissions, producing oil under difficult conditions, mitigating surface impacts, recycling produced water, capturing and
sequestering carbon dioxide, and more.
While it finds solutions to these challenges, the oil sands and heavy oil industry continues to develop unconventional
resources that are critical to meeting the world’s long-term needs for reliable hydrocarbon supplies.
Continued progress in oil sands and heavy oil producing technologies means progress in ensuring a dependable supply of
petroleum products at a time when traditional recovery methods are strained by additional demand from rapidly developing
industrial nations.
The Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition is the premier forum for the people who make this
innovation and progress possible.
Don’t miss this opportunity to present your product or service to a powerful, influential audience. Join the Oil & Gas
Journal and our conference attendees in Calgary this summer for the third annual Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies
Conference and Exhibition.

• It allows the pressure increase to
travel through the formation faster and
further. This is needed to match microseismic data.11 12
• On balance, there is a big difference between injection permeability
and production permeability (Fig. 7).
Pressure-dependent permeability is
generally smaller during production
and depletion in hard rock because of
cement in natural fractures.13
• A lumped pressure-dependent
permeability during injection would
include permeability enhancement due
to shearing as well as ballooning of
fractures and tensile failure.

Fourth key
The fourth key involves matching
microseismic patterns because shear
failure directly causes microseismic
bursts. Again, it was Warpinski who
recognized this as a key and documented a detailed effort to model and
match observed microseismic burst
patterns.1 14 There are two extremes
of modeling to match microseismic
observations:
1. Sophisticated finite element or
discrete element.11 15-17
2. Analytic screening model.1 2 14
Fig. 8 summarizes our in-house
screening model, FracFail, which is
similar to earlier approaches.1 As pore
pressure diffuses away from the central
fracture plane throughout the reservoir,
it induces shear

plus other mechanisms such as ballooning of fractures or tensile failure. This
lumped approach is also the approach
we have used in our modeling discussed in the following section.
In summary, the role of fracturedominated pressure-dependent leak off
in shear stimulation is as follows:
• It has the same order-of-magnitude as pressure-dependent permeability (actual pressure-dependent permeability can be up to 10 times larger).
• Permeability increases due to PDL
can be very large during fracture treatments (exceeding 100 times) because
the mechanism is fracture-dominated
(natural or shear-induced fractures).

Enhanced leak off (Cp/Co)

We have done this in one case in
which we matched microseismic burst
patterns, as follows:
One modeling approach assumes a
pressure-dependent permeability function (for natural or induced fractures)
and uses this as a variable parameter to
match both microseismic burst pattern
and well production.11 12 Fig. 7 shows
one such function, where the pressuredependent permeability increase during
injection reaches about 60 times.
Another such function gives a permeability increase of 667 times for a
pressure increase of only 81 psi.11 Note,
this increase would include permeability enhancement due to shearing

I TEMIZED REFINING COST INDEXES
The cost indexes may be used to convert prices at any date to prices at other dates by ratios to the cost indexes of the same
date. Item indexes are published each quarter (first week issue of January, April, July, and October). In addition the Nelson
Construction and Operating Cost Indexes are published in the first issue of each month of Oil & Gas Journal.

New analysis shows
pipelines using shorted
casings are more susceptible to corrosion
than pipelines using
Pipelines
nonshorted casings. The
preferential location of
anomalies on carrier pipe inside casings
is 2% of the casing length, or about 3
ft on average from either end of the
casing. Beyond 3 ft,
peak anomalies are
relatively uniformly
distributed. The
preferential location contains 25%
of peak anomalies,
or 10 times the
likelihood of anomalies elsewhere in
the casing.
Operators generally consider cased
pipe segments to be safe because
time-independent threats, including
third-party excavation and outside force
damage, are largely eliminated. The possibly enhanced external corrosion of the
carrier caused by the casing, however,

compromises this safety argument.
No sound evidence exists to suggest
that cased segments are safer than uncased ones in terms of leaks per mile or
scheduled or immediate responses per
mile. A 1984 survey instead revealed
that, of 14 countries, five reported corrosion damage on the carrier pipe when
casings were used, but none reported
corrosion damage on the carrier pipe
at crossings where casings were not
used.1 External corrosion on the carrier
pipe can become more severe than on
uncased segments when the carrier pipe
has access to electrolyte due to condensation from vent pipes open to air, or in
the presence of a short if ground water
gains access into the casing-carrier
annulus when the casing end seals are
either lacking or do not properly seal.
Fig. 1 shows the major elements of a
typical casing, including vent pipes, end
seals, and insulator spacers.

Background
When a thin layer of electrolyte is
condensed at the carrier pipe’s coating holidays, a high diffusion rate of
oxygen can lead to a high corrosion
rate. For such atmospheric corrosion,

In both cases, if the casing happens
to be located near a compressor station,
elevated temperature can accelerate the
corrosion problem. Elevated temperatures can cause a soft coating on carrier

pipe, such as hot applied asphalt, to
melt away and therefore turn the cased
segment into a bare pipe. The elevated
temperatures on the cased segment can
create steam in the annulus of the casing, which can cause condensation to
form along the top inside of the casing.
The condensed water can then drip

followed by formation of a protective
oxide.
Continuous dripping of condensed
water, however, can create a new cycle
of corrosion by washing away the
oxide. Such cyclic corrosion can create
long lengths of defects along the axis
of the carrier pipe, which can result in
rupture along this corrosion path. An
example of this failure is the 1985 incident of the Texas Eastern Gas Pipeline
Co.,2 to be described in the conclusion
of this article (OGJ, Apr. 20, 2009).

Second, the short can result in galvanic
coupling between the casing wall inner
surface and the carrier pipe at the coating holidays. The more positive potential of the casing wall inner surface can
shift in the positive direction of the
carrier pipe potentials at the coating
holidays, resulting in a higher corrosion
rate.

• Casing length.
Casings can also obstruct standard
methods of direct examination or
indirect inspection of the carrier pipe,5
making it more difficult to identify a
corrosion problem. Standard procedures for indirect inspections or direct
examinations of cased crossings therefore may need modification to address
these concerns or new technologies
may need to be developed to meet this
need.
External corrosion of cased pipe segments is complex and can be influenced
by many factors, including:
• Design differences (requirements
vary through history).
• Steel or weld type.
• Installation year.
• Historical CP interruptions.
• Historical leaks.
• Historical shorts, short clearance.
• Casing extensions to accommodate
road work.
• Bare or coated carrier or casing.
• Coating types, conditions.
• Bacterial presence.
• Local weather conditions.
• Seasonal water table changes.
• Soil electrolyte corrosivity.
• Local air corrosivity related to
geographic locations such as coastal or
grass-forest lands vs. desert, industrial
areas vs. agricultural areas, etc.
• Issues such as stray currents.
Fig. 3 shows an example of external
corrosion of a carrier pipe in a casing due to use of a wooden spacer. The
wooden spacer possibly shielded CP,
which otherwise would have provided
protection. Corrosion under wooden
spacers often occurs in older cased segments.
The conclusion of this article (OGJ,
Apr. 20, 2009) will focus on:
• Statistical analysis of in-line inspection (ILI) anomaly data provided
by seven operators participating in the
subject program.
• Evaluation of the effects of metallic
shorts vs. nonshort conditions.
• Investigation of historical casing
failures.
• Comparison of the number of

Table 2 also includes the breakdown
for the number of cased pipe segments
with anomaly depths between 20% and

Fig. 4 is a visual demonstration of
the casing data in Table 2. The cased
pipe segment with an anomaly depth
greater than 80% WT is hardly seen
(blue color), while the casings with
anomaly depths less than 20% WT account for the majority (green color).
A significant reduction in the number
of the cased pipe segments emerges as
anomaly depth increases.
• Data limitations. When reading or
interpreting the statistical data, one
must keep its limitations in mind. The
accuracy of ILI tools in finding and sizing anomalies depends on many factors
including, but not limited to:
—Types of pigging tools used; their
detection limits.8
—Qualification, competence, and
experience of personnel using the tools
and interpreting data.
—Software version used to interpret
the data.
—Operator ILI procedures, requirements.
• Basis of statistical analyses. Statistical
analyses counted and used only the

New industry visualization tool
Time Chart, a new web visualization tool, expands the capabilities of
the PetroTrek tool kit of web parts and
services.
The new tool allows users running
Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 to
access from a single location information
on production, operational, and safety data
and view relationships between past and
current well events. By making more data
easily available and putting information
in context, Time Chart facilitates decisionmaking to help oil companies improve
their operational performance, the firm
notes.
With Time Chart technology, petroleum
information workers are empowered with
another level of data visualization, the firm
says. As a web part, Time Chart connects
multiple data sources through web services, whether the data are stored locally or

in a database thousands of miles away. All
data can be displayed together graphically
to form a composite view of information
over any period of time.
The web part solution, with its components that work together to enable
developers to create web pages for users to
more easily access information, provides
the ability to efficiently visualize well
events. Among these events are allocated
production, annulus pressure, downtime,
choke size, flowing and shut in pressures,
reworks, recompletions, well treatments,
preventive maintenance, flowline temperature, attributed losses, well tests, and
production status.
The PetroTrek tool kit is a collection
of configurable web parts and services
specifically designed to meet the complex
information needs of petroleum engineers,

geoscientists, and other members of an asset team. In addition to the Time Chart, the
tool kit contains web parts for production
decline curves, well logs, field maps, well
tests, directional surveys, graphs, and tabular views of data. PetroTrek tool kit web
parts can be combined and configured to
quickly build production dashboards, operations reports, and electronic well files.
The company says its PetroTrek tool
kit web parts use Microsoft Silverlight
technology to render a graphically rich,
interactive user experience. Users can pan,
zoom, and manipulate data as well as configure presentation elements from the web
part. And because the web parts use AJAX
to stream data between browser and server,
users don’t have to wait for pages to reload
to see changes take effect.

Salazar: It’s not
war on oil and
gas; it’s taxation
In case anyone ﬁnds the difference between war and larceny puzzling, US Interior
Sec. Ken Salazar offers help.
“This is not, as some have suggested, a
war on the oil and gas industry,” Salazar assured directors of the American Petroleum
Institute Mar. 19.
“This,” according to the secretary’s
analysis in a prepared text, is President Barack Obama’s program of change: “Restor-

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

ing honesty and ﬁscal responsibility to the
budget. Making hard choices. Seeing where
we can get a better deal for the American
taxpayer.”
Troubling words, these.
According to Salazar, “Interior has not
systematically reexamined how the federal
government is compensated for extraction
of oil and gas for over 25 years.”
So it must have tumbled by accident
into its January 2007 increase in the royalty
on deepwater leases to 16.67% from 12.5%.
But who’s to quibble?
“We are going to take another look
at royalty rates,” said the cabinet ofﬁcer
who, since taking ofﬁce, has been busily
trimming producer access to federal land,
onshore and off.
“Tax breaks that are no longer needed,
and which the American people can’t afford, will disappear,” he went on.
This, of course, already is clear in a
proposed federal budget that would, if
enacted, use the tax code to ravage investment in onshore drilling and impose a new
offshore excise.
Two days before Salazar spread his
cheer in the API boardroom, Mary L.
Kendall, Interior’s acting inspector general,
spoke at a congressional subcommittee
hearing of the insufﬁciency of pressure on
federal offshore leaseholders to produce oil
and gas.
“Production activities are not required
to commence within the primary lease
term,” she said, keeping alive the “use-it-orlose-it” issue that reared its ludicrous head
last year (OGJ Online, Mar. 18, 2009).
There is, in fact, no reason for leases
to stipulate production. The money and
trouble invested in offshore leases constitute all the incentive leaseholders need to
produce oil and gas.
Alas, the Obama team evidently
distrusts market incentives and sees no
contraction in policy inducements to rush
oil and gas production from a static lease
inventory for less money.
But, hey, it’s not war.

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

Economic outlook remains cloudy
In the ﬁnal days of March, market analysts saw some indications that the economic crisis might be nearing bottom and could perhaps rebound in the second half
of this year.
The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending increased by 0.2%
in February. Analysts at Pritchard Capital Partners LLC, New Orleans, noted Mar.
20 that crude prices had gained more than $20/bbl, or 59%, from earlier lows of
$33.98/bbl, while Department of Energy data for 2 of the previous 3 weeks showed
increased US demand from 2008 levels. The average US retail price for conventional
gasoline climbed to $2/gal for the ﬁrst time since November.
Still, Adam Sieminski, chief energy economist, Deutsche Bank, Washington, DC,
said, “The global economy is in worse shape than the consensus expects, but…
the world can avert a 1930s style downturn. We expect the energy and industrial
metals complex eventually will be the major beneﬁciaries of an improving economic
outlook.”
In its Mar. 30 weekly report, the Centre for Global Energy Studies (CGES) said
Mideast Gulf liftings are at a 6-year low, averaging 16.4 million b/d in March, down
more than 1.5 million b/d from last year’s high. Most of that falloff has occurred since
December, but the long lead-time between oil being lifted in the Middle East and
arriving off the coasts of consumer countries means the full impact of production
reductions has yet to be felt in North America and Europe.
However, CGES analysts see “little clear evidence” that producers have been
turning customers away. Oil supplies still in ﬂoating storage “suggests producers
have cut production in response to falling demand from reﬁners,” they said. Although the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries remains committed to the
lower production quotas agreed in December, CGES analysts said, “It is unlikely that
Mideast Gulf liftings will fall much further, as the Gulf Arab states are already near
full compliance, while Iran is unlikely to cut its output much further.”
Inventories rising
Meanwhile, inventories of crude and petroleum products continued rising this
year in the US, EU16, and Japan but remain below the levels of 2006-07. Increased
domestic production has increased US crude stocks despite a drop in imports.
“Crude oil stocks in Europe and Japan fell by 7 million bbl in January and February
and are down by a further 10 million bbl in Japan, where the economy is shrinking at
a rate not seen since the 1970s,” CGES said. Imports will fall further as OPEC reductions progress down the supply chain.
“Reﬁned product stocks have risen as demand has weakened, but this is easing as reﬁners cut runs in response to weak margins. If weak margins persist and
throughput continues to be low, any upturn in demand could see reﬁned product
stocks begin to fall from current highs,” CGES reported.
Global reﬁning runs historically decline from January through April or May, as reﬁners in the US and Europe do seasonal maintenance in preparation for the summer
months, when demand for gasoline is dominant. But this year, CGES said, January
throughputs in major reﬁning centers were down more than 2.5 million b/d (5%)
from a year ago because of poor proﬁt margins due to the sharp falloff in demand.
“Even a 700,000 b/d increase in February, primarily in Europe, leaves runs 1.7 million b/d (3%) down on the same month last year. It seems unlikely that this upward
trend will continue, with major reﬁners in the US and Asia announcing extended
maintenance closures and run cuts in the second quarter,” said CGES analysts.
Meanwhile a sharp drop in middle distillate margins in major reﬁning centers
suggests that demand for diesel, a key indicator of economic activity, is shrinking
globally. Gas oil stocks in Singapore are climbing due to increased exports from
China, South Korea, and Japan. “Chinese state reﬁners will be allowed to export
680,000 tonnes of diesel tax-free in the second quarter to help reduce Chinese
stocks,” CGES reported. “Independent gas oil stocks in Rotterdam have risen to
around 17 million bbl as supplies from Russia increase and European demand for
heating fuels drops. US distillate stock levels fell in the week ending Mar. 20 . . . but
are still well above the 5-year average. Until economic activity picks up, or reﬁnery
throughputs fall even further, margins will remain weak.”
Jacques H. Rousseau, an analyst at Soleil-Back Bay Research, reduced his estimates of 2009 earnings at six reﬁning companies primarily due to the sharp decline
in reﬁning margins in March and the potential for increased gasoline imports during
this year’s second quarter.

quantiﬁed in terms of ranges and thresholds. The paper presents the results of this evaluation and points to future work which will
be undertaken to complete a full feasibility analysis and detailed design features of the system.
Dehydration and Desalting of Heavy Crude Maya into TMDB by means of Tanks of Storage of 500 MB Converted to Gun Barrel
Luis Fernando Lopez Cisneros – PEMEX
In this work design a system of dehydration and desalting for 750 MBD of heavy crude Maya, by means tanks type Gun-Barrel. The
design one carries out using the simulation packages HYSYS and CFD of ANSYS, considering the parameters that were studied in
bottle tests and proﬁled in tanks of storage of 500 MB, being based in the settling speed that affects the dehydration and desalting
of crude.

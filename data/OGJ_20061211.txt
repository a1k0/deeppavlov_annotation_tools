General

Interest

WoodMac: Output boost forecast for Venezuela
Production from Venezuela’s marginal fields will surge within 3
years, predicts Wood Mackenzie Ltd., Edinburgh.
That conclusion came in a report entitled “Venezuela’s new
empresas mixtas set to boost output.” Venezuela formed new joint
venture companies (empresas mixtas, or mixed companies) with
international oil companies after renegotiating contracts under
which the companies were working (OGJ, Apr. 25, 2005, p. 48).
The mixed companies operate the assets, and state company
Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) takes a majority stake in each,
typically 60% or larger.
After 2 years of reduced investment and production declines
during “the painful process of rewriting the marginal-field contracts,” a production boost is in prospect, WoodMac said.
“By 2009, oil production from the former marginal fields could
have risen by 125,000 b/d or more, a 34% increase on today’s levels,” said Matthew Shaw, WoodMac Latin America senior analyst.
He noted these figures exclude production from seven marginal
fields that were relinquished to PDVSA by participants choosing
not to convert their contracts.
“In some cases, the return on investment arising from the contract conversion will actually increase—especially for the secondround marginal fields which had particularly tough fiscal terms—

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

but the drop in working interest has seriously reduced the net
present value of the assets for the third parties,” Shaw said. “The
overall decrease in their portfolio value is approximately $2.5 billion, a 43% drop.”
The report also predicted long-term potential for many fields.
“The new contracts have extended the previous license terms
by as much as 14 years, which should allow previously untapped
oil reserves to be exploited, for instance by implementing water
injection,” Shaw said.

US House passes bill on produced-water use
The US government would study expanded uses for water
produced with oil and gas under legislation passed Dec. 5 by the
House of Representatives (OGJ, Oct. 16, 2006, p. 30).
HR 5110 would direct the US Interior secretary to identify obstacles to using produced water. It also would authorize funding
for three pilot plants in Colorado, California, and Arizona or Nevada to demonstrate ways produced water can be made suitable
for other uses.
The bill moves to the Senate, which would have to pass it before
adjourning for the year. If the Senate doesn’t act, the bill will be
reintroduced early in 2007, according to a spokesman for its sponsor, Rep. Mark Udall (D-Colo.). ✦

Development

Iran plans Azadegan tenders, Pars Phases 6-8
Tender documents for Iran’s Azadegan development were expected to be ready by Dec. 15, said Gholamhoseyn Nowzari, National Iranian Oil Co. (NIOC) managing director, at an NIOC seminar in Tehran last month.
In October, Japan’s Inpex Corp. agreed to reduce to 10% its concession in Iran’s Azadegan oil field from the current 75%, with the
outstanding 65% stake to be transferred to NIOC (OGJ Online, Oct.
6, 2006).
Nozari also announced that NIOC expects to finish the preparation of a directive on modifications to buy-back deals by next
week.
Meanwhile, Nowzari said, NIOC held discussions Oct. 31 with
Total SA concerning a project to develop South Pars gas field and
the Pars LNG project.
Nowzari expressed hope that South Pars Phases 6-8 would be
commissioned by Mar. 20, 2007, the end of the current Iranian
year.

Petrobras, Ecopetrol plan joint projects
The national oil companies of Brazil and Colombia plan jointly
to explore the Tucano Block in Bahia, Brazil, and to expand produc-

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

tion in Tibu oil field in Colombia.
Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) will sign an agreement
with Colombia’s Ecopetrol to further develop Tibu, 500 km north
of Bogota near the Venezuelan border. The Ecopetrol-operated field
began production in 1944, reached its production peak in 1955 at
26,000 b/d of 32-50° gravity oil, and has produced a total of 247
million bbl. It has 129 active wells.
Petrobras will manage the advanced development program and
fund 55% of it. The program is designed to extend production by
as much as 100 million bbl. Production is expected to increase to
more than 15,000 b/d from 1,800 b/d, and Petrobras will retain
40% of the field’s total production.
The 21⁄2-year Phase I will begin in January. Petrobras will invest
$40 million for studies to determine the field’s potential and for
technology.
Ecopetrol will work in partnership with Petrobras in the exploration of the 170 sq km Tucano 156 Block in Bahia. The block, in
the Tucano Sul basin, 90 km from the Bahia coast, was purchased
at a recent National Petroleum Agency auction.
Ecopetrol, with a 30% share, will be the project’s operator, and
Petrobras holds 70%.

Murphy temporarily abandons Gulf of Mexico well
Murphy Oil Corp. has temporarily plugged and abandoned its
Thunder Ridge exploration well on Mississippi Canyon Block 737
in the Gulf of Mexico.
The primary objectives found wet sands, with a secondary shallower objective encountering a small oil accumulation. The exploration well and subsequent sidetrack were drilled in over 6,100 ft
of water.
Postdrilling analysis will continue to determine if the resource
found can be commercially viable as a tieback to another facility. Thunder Ridge lies close to the company’s recently sanctioned
Thunder Hawk development, which will include a stand-alone
semisubmersible floating production unit that is scheduled for installation in late 2008 to accommodate the expected start of oil
production in 2009.
Murphy owns a 37.5% working interest in the field and serves
as operator. Partners are Dominion Exploration & Production Inc.
25%, Hydro Gulf of Mexico LLC 25%, and Marubeni Corp. subsidiary Marubeni Offshore Production (USA) Inc. 12.5%.

Talisman strikes oil off Trinidad and Tobago
Talisman Energy Inc. and its partners made an oil discovery with
the Ruby-1 exploration well on Block 3(a) 30 miles off the northeast coast of Trinidad and Tobago. On test Ruby-1 produced 5,000
b/d of oil through a 7⁄8-in. choke from a limited interval within the
pay section.
The well, which was drilled to TD 5,750 ft, found 1,200 ft of
hydrocarbon-bearing sands, including more than 800 ft of net pay.
Talisman said its Kingbird-1, an exploration well drilled prior to
Ruby-1, found 80 ft of gross hydrocarbon pay and was abandoned
without testing pending further technical studies.

Wholly owned subsidiary Talisman (Trinidad Block 3a) Ltd.
holds 25.5% working interest in Block 3(a). Partners BHP Billiton
(operator) and Anadarko Petroleum Corp. each hold 25.5% interest. Petrotrin has 15% interest and Total SA holds 8.5% interest.

Dana reports oil discovery off Mauritania
Dana Petroleum PLC reported an oil discovery in Cretaceous
sandstones in its Aigrette-1 well on Block 7 off Mauritania (see
map, OGJ, Oct. 23, 2006, p. 38).
The well was drilled to TD 5,152 m in 1,358 m of water. Dana
ran wireline logs, took pressure measurements, sampled fluids, and
cut sidewall cores.
“Downhole pressure measurements and fluid samples confirmed a 20-m oil column was present in good quality Cretaceous
age reservoir sands,” the company said.
The well was originally planned for TD 4,900 m. Dana said
the deepened section encountered “significant further sands” that
didn’t contain oil.
Dana discovered gas in the Pelican-1 well on the same block in
2003.
“The extensive acreage of Block 7, coupled with the discovery
of both oil and gas within the first two wells and the presence in
Aigrette of deeper sands than those found in Pelican, all provides
considerable encouragement for future drilling in this underexplored region of northern Mauritania,” said Tom Cross, Dana’s
chief executive officer.
Dana, operator, and its partners work under a production-sharing contract on the block, which covers 10,090 sq km.
Interests are Dana 36%, Gaz de France 27.85%, Hardman Resources Ltd. 16.2%, Woodside Energy Ltd. 15%, and Roc Oil Co.
Ltd. 4.95%. ✦

Production

Hess begins Phu Horm gas ﬂow in Thailand
Amerada Hess (Thailand) Ltd. has begun production from Phu
Horm gas field on Block E5N in Udon Thani Province of northeastern Thailand, reported Salamander Energy PLC.
Phu Horm’s gas reserves are estimated at 550 bcf plus condensate capable of yielding 500 b/d of production (OGJ, Aug. 1, 2005,
Newsletter).
Gross production, initially from two wells, will be about 60
MMcfd, increasing to an expected rate exceeding 100 MMcfd plus
condensate. Additional wells will be brought into production in
2007, and deliveries are expected to increase to as much as 108
MMcfd.
Hess owns a 35% interest in the field and is operator. Other
partners are Apico LLC 35%, PTT Exploration & Production PLC
(PTTEP) 20%, and ExxonMobil Exploration & Production Khorat
Inc. 10%. Salamander owns 27.2% of Apico.
A gas sales agreement with PTT Public Co. Ltd. calls for more
than 500 bcf of gas from the field to be supplied to a power station
at Nam Phong over 15 years.

impact statement.
Impacts would be most significant during construction of the
Gulf LNG Clean Energy Project, which also would include a new
pipeline to ship as much as 1.5 bcfd of gas out to three interconnection points, FERC said.
Gulf Energy LLC, which is building the terminal, sought FERC’s
approval to build a berth and unloading facilities capable of accommodating one LNG tanker, LNG transfer systems, two 160,000-cu
m LNG storage tanks, 10 high-pressure submerged combustion
vaporizers, vapor handling systems, hazard detection and response
equipment, and ancillary buildings, utilities, and service facilities.
Gulf LNG Pipeline LLC separately requested FERC approval for
a 5-mile, 36-in. gas sendout pipeline and associated support facilities, including three interconnects and meter stations, one pig
launcher, and one pig receiver.

Dutch-UK Balgzand-Bacton gas line starts
The new Balgzand-Bacton pipeline has begun commercial delivery of natural gas from the Netherlands to the UK.
The 235-km, 36-in. pipeline works at a pressure of 135 atm.
Around 230 km of the pipeline is offshore under the North Sea. It
will have a capacity of 15 billion cu m (bcm)/year when a remotely operated electrical compressor station enters service in January
in Anna Paulowna, Noord Holland.
“In the Netherlands the pipeline was pulled through the dunes
using a horizontal directional drilling technique to cause less damage to the environment,” a BBL spokesman told OGJ.
The spokesman said BBL has received “a lot of interest” in an

open season for pipeline capacity, which it will offer monthly.
BBL is a joint venture of E.ON Ruhrgas, Fluxys, and NV Nederlandse Gasunie.
The Balgzand-Bacton pipeline is the third major gas transport
project serving the UK to start up this winter. The 600-km southern leg of the 1,200-km Langeled pipeline from Norway delivered
first gas to the UK in October (OGJ, Oct. 23, 2006, p. 34). And an
expansion of the Interconnector pipeline between the Netherlands
and the UK came on stream the same month, increasing capacity
by 7 bcm/year to 23.5 bcm/year.
The UK is expecting new LNG supplies to be delivered to Teesside via the Excelerate project early in 2007. The South Hook LNG
and Dragon LNG terminals in south Wales are expected to become
operational by late 2007.

Falcon Gas Storage Co. Inc. plans to build a 63-mile, 24-in. gas
pipeline to serve its expanded 16 bcf working capacity WorshamSteed gas storage facility in the western Barnett shale gas play near
Fort Worth. Pipeline capacity is expected to be 450 MMcfd, and
commercial operation is scheduled to begin Sept. 1, 2007.
Falcon’s Worsham-Steed pipeline will extend southward from
the Worsham-Steed facility through Jack, Parker, and Hood counties in Texas. It will interconnect with two existing 36-in. gas
transmission pipelines: the North Texas Pipeline, jointly owned by
Enterprise Products Partners and Energy Transfer Partners, and the
Atmos Energy Corp. Line X pipeline.
In addition to an existing interconnection with Energy Transfer’s
Old Ocean pipeline at Worsham-Steed, the new pipeline will connect to Devon Energy Corp.’s Acacia pipeline, Atmos’s Line WA, and
Enterprise’s recently announced Sherman extension pipeline. ✦

Since 1983, we’ve been advancing the science of CO2 removal
from natural gas with Cynara membrane technology. Our latest
fourth generation Cynara membranes are breaking all previous
records for system efﬁciency and cost-effectiveness.
After nearly two years of actual ﬁeld operation, the new 30"
membranes have proven to increase processing feed capacity
while signiﬁcantly reducing total weight and footprint. This is
extremely important on offshore platforms and space-constrained
onshore facilities.

A Malaysian perspective

Alan Petzet
Chief EditorExploration
Fresh from several years of exploration success in Malaysia, Arkansas-based
Murphy Oil Corp. said another place
it would like to be in Southeast Asia is
Indonesia.
Murphy’s growth in Malaysia began
with discovery of West Patricia oil field
in 2000 at its first well in shallow water
and Kikeh oil field, the country’s first
deepwater discovery, in 2002.
Drilling several dozen wells off
Sarawak and Sabah on northwestern
Borneo has given Murphy perspective
on basins of similar age in Indonesia,
said David Wood, president of Murphy
Exploration & Production Co.
Murphy holds acreage in Malaysia’s
three main producing provinces.

both fields have oil columns more than
1,000 ft thick and test-flowed in excess
of 10,000 b/d/well.
Kakap, being unitized with Shell
Malaysia’s 2004 Gumusut discovery on
adjacent Block J, probably won’t begin
producing oil until 2011. Development
cost is two or three times that of Kikeh.
One of Murphy’s challenges is learning to make thin-bed oil pays commercial in deep water.
Wood noted that 14 of the 18 wells
drilled in the Sabah Trough found hydrocarbons, but some are in high-quality sands just a few feet thick, mostly
below seismic resolution.
Murphy’s Jangas, Kerisi, Senangin,
and Siakap finds could have a combined
1 billion bbl of oil in place. A recovery
factor can’t be calculated because the
sands’ areal extent and vertical connectivity aren’t certain, Wood said.
One plan is to tie Kerisi back to
Kikeh and produce it to check performance.

area to penetrate this deep section.
A carbonate interval that works in
rift plays off China and the Philippines
has not been tested off Borneo, and a
shallower Pliocene play is also untried,
Wood said.
Meanwhile, new 3D seismic data
reveal prospects in 1,200-1,500 ft of
water in deepwater Block H.

Sarawak oil and gas

Murphy has had 85% success in
finding movable hydrocarbons with its
wells off Sarawak, Wood said.
Output averaged 13,500 b/d net to
Murphy’s 85% interest in 2005 from
West Patricia and Congkak fields 25
miles offshore on Block SK 309. West
Patricia is expected to recover 50-60
million bbl of oil.
Discoveries in 2005 at Endau and
Rompin, containing oil in multiple reservoirs, are being examined for standalone development.
Meanwhile, Belum, Golok, Maharani,
and Serampang found gas in multiple

The OCS leasing struggle
Meager offshore oil and gas leasing reform
tested political winds in the US House of Representatives Dec. 5 and nearly got blown away. At
this writing, the effort was trying to skirt opposition in the final days of the 109th Congress as an
attachment to unrelated legislation.
The bill, which would open 8.3 million acres
of the Outer Continental Shelf in the eastern Gulf
of Mexico, is far less aggressive than a measure
the House passed in July. Still, supporters had to
withdraw it when they sensed trouble winning
the two-thirds majority required for passage under
special rules for expeditious handling. At midweek,
MSNBC reported that leasing reform was one of
several bills drawn to renewal of tax cuts as a possible vehicle through the House.

Acting on supply
Trouble passing the lesser of two OCS leasing measures typifies the 109th Congress. This is
the Congress that produced the sweeping Energy
Policy Act of 2005, a marvel of bipartisan dealmaking notable mostly for pushing the US toward
the nationalization of fuel choice. It’s the Congress
that chose to address outside its deliberations on
“energy policy” the question of how the world’s
single biggest energy-consuming country can
preclude leasing of 85% of its offshore territory.
It’s the Congress that, when it did take up leasing reform, acted with awesome timidity. It’s the
Congress that stayed reluctant to the bitter end to
act substantially on energy supply.
Voters should remember this performance
if the US winter is as cold as the last weeks of
autumn. That leasing reform in any configuration
survived this long is in fact a political triumph
born of stressful prices for natural gas. States with
industries hurt by expensive gas, some of them in
the US interior, have learned that OCS access serves
general interests and not just those of oil companies and coastal communities. This is ideological
progress. But the legislative payoff, if any, will fall
far short of what the US needs.
The bill seeking a path of least resistance
through the House last week was one passed in

August by the Senate, which refused to consider
the broader legislation that the House passed in
June. The Senate bill makes opening of the eastern
gulf acreage palatable to Floridian lawmakers by
precluding leasing until June 30, 2020, of acreage 125 miles off Florida’s western coast and 100
miles off the panhandle. It also allows Gulf Coast
states to share 37.5% of future OCS revenue up to
a $500 million limit (OGJ, Aug. 7, 2006, p. 24).
The House bill would have made possible the
lifting of leasing moratoriums across the whole
OCS. Moratoriums would have ended automatically for federal acreage 100 miles or more offshore.
Coastal states could have blocked federal leasing
50-100 miles offshore. And leasing would have
been prohibited within 50 miles of shore except
where affected states rescinded the ban.

Controversies
Beyond the controversial ending of moratoriums long in effect, the House bill poisoned itself
in at least two other ways. To entice states to approve leasing, it would have shared federal revenue
without limits. And it provided for gas-only leases.
The White House Office of Management and
Budget, in addition to some leasing supporters in
the Senate, objected to fiscal consequences of the
revenue-sharing provision and to administrative
challenges of the gas-only leases (OGJ, July 10,
2006, p. 22). Senators promised not to consider
the House bill if it went to a conference for reconciliation with their narrower measure. If there
was to be any leasing reform, therefore, it would
be the Senate bill, which the House had to pass
before adjournment last week.
The something-beats-nothing argument has
been made in this space before (OGJ, Aug. 7,
2006, p. 19). It’s worth repeating that any bill
expanding OCS acreage available for oil and gas
leasing bears historic significance. But the energy
significance is a direct function of the amount
of acreage involved. By that test, the Senate bill
didn’t amount to much. It apparently requires a
cold winter to underscore what still needs to be
done. ✦

Exploration and appraisal drilling
in Southeast Asia has continued at high
levels through 2006 as oil companies,
flush with cash, seek to replace reserves.
The high level of license awards in
2005 sustained drilling activity through
2006, and this trend is expected to
continue if operators can secure access
to drilling rigs.
A number of significant discoveries
were made during
2005-06, with
Indonesia and Malaysia accounting
for more than half
of them. About 30
discoveries were
made this year,
adding potential reserves of 300 million
bbl of oil and 10 tcf of gas.
Husky Oil China Ltd.’s deepwater gas
discovery off China was the highlight
of the year to date, encouraging further
licensing and improving industry

South Korea’s Daewoo also discovered
additional volumes of gas near Shwe
field in Myanmar, for which cumulative
reserves of 8.6 tcf was certified in 2006.
In addition to exploration success,
at least 170 new field developments are
expected to come on stream in Southeast Asia by 2012. They will generate
about 950,000 b/d of new liquids
production and more than 8 bcfd of
incremental sales gas (Figs. 1 and 2).
Key developments include the Cepu
Block on Java, the Kikeh and Gumusut oil fields off Sabah, supplies to the
Tangguh LNG plant in Irian Jaya, and
Puguang gas field in China. These five
projects together should contribute
390,000 b/d and 2.1 bcfd of new production by yearend 2011.

in this review are Brunei, Cambodia,
offshore China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Malaysia-Thailand Joint Development

Thirty-one licenses were awarded
across the region in the first 10 months
of this year. Although significantly
lower than the 47 licenses awarded in
2005, this is not a full-year figure, and
impending awards in Indonesia could
boost the total. High levels of awards
were seen in China and the Philippines, with lowest activity in Malaysia
and Myanmar (Fig. 3). This is perhaps
a reaction to preceding years of high
activity, in which most of the attractive acreage was awarded. Eight areas
predominated:
• China. Seven awards were made off
China through October, continuing the
trend from 2005. Six of them are in the
South China Sea and followed Husky’s
5 tcf Liwan discovery on its deepwater
acreage (OGJ, June 26, 2006, Newsletter). Husky signed an additional deepwater block and two more in shallow
water. BG Group PLC has been awarded
three deepwater blocks, while Devon
Energy Corp. signed the only block

outside the South China Sea, expanding
its position in the East China Sea.
In addition, Total SA, in partnership
with PetroChina, gained an interest in
the South Sulige Block in the Ordos basin, a rare example of an onshore China
license being awarded to a foreign
operator.
• Philippines. In the Philippines,
seven service contracts (SCs) have been
awarded, predominantly to international companies, including a Royal Dutch
Shell unit and Nido Petroleum Ltd.,
Perth. Shell has expanded its Philippines
portfolio by signing SC60 in the Northeast Palawan basin.
Two contracts awarded in 2006
were for Area 1 and Area 4, part of the
Department of Energy’s second formal
licensing round in 2005. Area 1, in the
Southwest Palawan basin, increased
Nido Petroleum’s Philippines portfolio
to eight blocks, while Malaysia’s Ranhill
Energy, Kuala Lumpur, was awarded
Area 4, in the Sulu Sea.
• Indonesia. Licensing levels have
continued downward through October, with only five signings, compared
with nine in 2005. However, 41 blocks
have been tendered, and the number
of awards could increase substantially
before yearend.
The much-anticipated results of the
2005 bidding round were announced
in June. Only four blocks were awarded,
despite seven having attracted bids. The
open acreage in the Makassar Straits was
popular with international players, and
Petronas Carigali, ExxonMobil Corp.,
Husky, and Marathon Oil Corp. were
the successful operators. The blocks are
characterized by high exploration risk
and high costs, and seven of the 14
blocks failed to attract bids.
Of the 41 blocks offered this year, 20
are under competitive tenders that close
in December. The remaining blocks
were subject to direct offers and closed
on Oct. 11. Only one block failed to
attract a bid. ConocoPhillips, Chevron
Corp., and ExxonMobil are among the
international and local companies believed to have made submissions. With
awards expected by yearend, this could

licensing activity.
• Malaysia. Only two blocks were
awarded in Malaysia through November, marking a loss of licensing momentum from 2005, when activity was
driven by exploration successes and
tenders for the most prospective deepwater acreage. Despite the slowdown,
the deepwater trend continued, with
Murphy Sabah Oil Co. Ltd. awarded the
SB P deepwater block off Sabah in January. The block includes newly demarcated acreage resulting from a partial
relinquishment of Murphy’s SB K block.
• Thailand. Only three blocks were
officially awarded in 2006, under
Thailand’s 19th licensing round, which
closed in June. However, at least two
more are pending final approval, with
authorities considering a total of 22.
These awards are anticipated in early
2007.
• Myanmar. Most onshore and shal-

low-water acreage in Myanmar has
been awarded following high levels of
licensing activity in 2004-05. A few
open blocks remain, and Block M8
was awarded to a consortium led by
Zarubezhneft in September. In a bid to
further boost activity, the government
has offered 18 deepwater blocks, attracting interest from both existing and
new players, although no awards have
been announced to date. Under terms
of the newly offered deepwater licenses,
a 2-year technical evaluation period is
offered prior to the signing of a full
production-sharing contract (PSC).
• Brunei. Onshore Blocks L and M
were awarded this year—the first since
2003. The activity planned by the new
operators, Loon Energy of Canada, and
China Oil, will help offset delays affecting development of Brunei’s disputed
offshore acreage.

The exploitation of Kikeh field has
its share of challenges. Costs have risen
to $1.7 billion, including construction of a gas pipeline to Labuan Island.
Unitization issues also remain, given
the field’s proximity to Brunei. A fault is
understood to separate the main Kikeh
field from the satellite Kikeh 5 structure, which lies closer to the disputed
maritime boundary with Brunei. It is
likely that Kikeh 5 will require unitization before it can be integrated with the
main field development.

Gumusut-Kakap (Malaysia)
Gumusut field was discovered in
2003 on Shell-operated Block J. It
extends westwards into adjacent Block
K and potentially over the disputed
marine border with Brunei. Murphy
Oil operates Block K on which Kakap
field is located. Unitization issues and
the ongoing territorial dispute between
Brunei and Malaysia likely will complicate this development as well.
The field lies in more than 1,000 m

similar to Kikeh’s and could be more
costly still. These challenges could slow
the development of a discovery that is
estimated at a cumulative 500 million
bbl of oil reserves. First production
could begin in 2010 and reach 83,000
b/d by 2011.

Puguang (onshore China)
The Chinese state company Sinopec
discovered Puguang gas field in Sichuan Province in late 2002. Following
appraisal drilling, field reserves were
increased to 6.6 tcf, making it one of
the largest gas fields in China. Sinopec
intends to aggressively develop Puguang
to produce 390 MMcfd by 2008 and
more than 700 MMcfd by 2010.
Gas demand in China, concentrated
in the eastern and coastal areas, is
expected to rise rapidly over the next
decade and accommodate the planned
increase in gas production. Plans originally included construction of a pipeline to Jinan, in Shandong Province,
but the Chinese government decided

The switch
to biofuels

I

s the day approaching when countries around the globe will switch
from oil and natural gas to biofuels?
Some already are touting the switch,
but it could prove costlier than they
think. Consider Indonesia, a member
of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, where stateowned electricity company PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) plans to
operate biofuel-fired power plants
next year.
With a combined capacity of 58
Mw, the plants—to be built in several
regions such as Lampung, West Nusa
Tenggara, East Nusa Tenggara, and
South Kalimantan—would use palm
oil as their main energy source.
Alhilal Hamdi, chairman of
Indonesia’s National Biofuel Development Team, who is also president
of PT PLN’s board of commissioners, said the plan was part of the
company’s efforts to maximize the
use of alternative energy sources in
its operations. “PLN will reduce its
dependence on oil in stages,” he said.

Exports rising
Consider Malaysia, where experts
are projecting 1 million tonnes in
biofuel production next year for export, more than double the production of this year’s 400,000 tonnes.
Malaysian Palm Oil Association
(MPOA) Chairman Sabri Ahmad explained that the demand for biofuel
in Europe and the US was expanding
rapidly in line with the requirement
for more environmentally friendly
energy.
At the launch of the International
Biofuel & Alternative Energy Conference on Dec. 5, Sabri said that by
2012 Europe would require 10 mil32

lion tonnes/year of biodiesel compared with 4 million tonnes/year
currently. Consider the Philippines,
where both chambers of the legislature have passed a bill mandating
vehicles to run on environmentally
friendly biofuels. The legislation
mandates the use of biofuels by
blending 5% bioethanol with gasoline within 2 years after the law takes
effect and 1% biodiesel with diesel
within 3 months after it takes effect.

Competing with food
Philippine Senate Minority Leader
Aquilino Pimentel Jr. said the bill will
“start the beginning of our cutting of
the umbilical cord of dependence on
imported fossil fuel from the Middle
East, and it will start the cleansing of
the environment from polluted air.” It
also will boost employment, he said.
While such countries are touting
the new industry, biofuel still has adverse effects that are only beginning
to emerge.
In China, for example, grain is
getting as expensive as oil due to
demand growth for corn and other
crops to be used to generate biofuel
instead of for food.
“We predict that agricultural
products will be as hot as petroleum
in the future,” said one trader at the
Dalian Commodity Exchange, where
corn prices jumped 19.5% in October and last month to reach a 10-year
high.
Of corn, Wang Jinmin, a professor
at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, said: “With its increasing role as a crude oil substitute and
environmentally friendly energy,
prices are unlikely to drop in the
long run.” ✦

could decline by as much as 1 million
b/d.
Pemex predicts that the declines will
be offset by new wells coming online in
deepwater Gulf of Mexico and in Chicontepec field in Veracruz state. However, many experts say both areas would
require at least a decade of exploration
and development before significant
production begins. ✦

Small producers cite
struggles in UK N. Sea
Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
Small oil and gas companies are
struggling to acquire and develop acreage in UK licensing rounds because of
intense competition and high taxes,
company executives said at a conference
in London.
Speaking at the World Junior Oil
and Gas Congress in London, Russell
Langusch, managing director of Elixir
Petroleum, said 141 companies have
applied for licenses under the 24th
licensing round for the UK North Sea.
The UK government hasn’t announced
results (OGJ Online, Nov. 10, 2006).
Langusch said the introduction of
promote licenses by the UK Department
for Trade and Industry (DTI) to encourage exploration and production by
small companies in the UK North Sea
has spurred a record number of applications over the past 2 years.
However, the DTI has “unrealistic”
expectations of these companies’ abilities to finance drilling under promote
licences, he added.
Many international oil companies
are selling holdings in the mature UK
North Sea to independent producers
and new, small companies. Oil executives said they needed a stable and
reasonable tax regime to encourage
them to invest in the region, which is
estimated to hold 27 billion boe.
“The UK government did not understand the impact of its tax change

in 2005 and the effect on our operations,” Tom Windle, founder and chief
executive officer of Wham Energy, said.
In December 2005, Gordon Brown,
chancellor of the exchequer, shocked
the UK oil industry by doubling the
supplementary corporation tax rate
on oil and gas production to 20% in a
move that pushed the total corporate
tax on production begun after 1993 to

50% and on older production to 75%.
The high taxes have hurt the economics of developing mature acreage with
declining production rates.
Alex Kemp, a professor of petroleum economics at the University of
Aberdeen, added that it would be
challenging for the UK to meet its goal
of producing 2 million b/d of oil by
2020 because companies would need to

develop 20 new fields/year. Recent discoveries, he said, are smaller than their
predecessors, which means that greater
numbers of them are required to meet
the target.
“We also need quicker decisionmaking and technical and managerial
handling of operations to meet this
goal,” Kemp stressed. ✦

Tighter oil market likely in 2007, analyst says
The oil market is likely to tighten in
2007 with global demand for crude up
by 1.7 million b/d, non-OPEC production growing by just 1 million b/d,
and only a 1.1 million b/d increase in
refining capacity, said Edward L. Morse,
managing director and chief energy
economist for Lehman Bros. Inc., New
York.
World demand for crude rose by 5.2
million b/d from 2002 to 2005, or an
average 1.7 million b/d/year. The consensus is for 2006 demand growth to
be just over 1 million b/d, but Lehman
Bros. puts it at 1.2 million b/d.
The reason for the 2006 demand
reduction from the previous average
was not the escalation of prices as some
might speculate but the “incredible
distortion” of supply and demand fundamentals caused by Hurricanes Katrina
and Rita in 2005.
Damage inflicted by those hurricanes
and the associated surge in energy prices depressed US demand until last April.
But since April, US energy demand has
been stronger than prehurricane 2005,
Morse said Dec. 5 at an annual oil and
gas conference hosted by Deloitte &
Touche in Houston.
The 2006 market also was weighed
down by fuel switching in electric
power generation. US demand for residual fuel was reduced by 400,000 b/d as
a result of lower natural gas prices. But
Morse sees no room for further substitution in 2007.

Demand outlook
“Barring any unforeseen incidents, I
can’t see how demand can fail to grow
at less than 1.7 million b/d” in 2007,
Morse said. He sees US oil demand
increasing by 250,000-350,000 b/d
in 2007, compared with an average
growth of 293,000 b/d/year in 19952005. US demand for gasoline, diesel,
and jet fuel should grow by 300,000
b/d, even if the 2006-07 winter proves
to be warmer than normal. But cold
weather and fuel substitution could
add another 200,000 b/d or more, said
Morse.
China’s demand growth is pegged at
500,000-700,000 b/d in 2007 from
an average of 395,000 b/d/year in
1995-2005. Controlled product prices
in China have resulted in “rationed
demand,” said Morse. Chinese refiners
have been losing money on domestic
sales of petroleum products and have
restrained production availability in
response. As product prices are liberalized, that pent-up demand could add
150,000 b/d to China’s basic demand
growth.
Other emerging Asian markets
should add another 200,000 b/d of
demand growth. The “torrid economic
growth” in the Middle East “will likely
add at least 350,000 b/d” of oil demand growth, Morse said.
Energy intensity—the measure of the
energy efficiency of a nation’s economy,
calculated as units of energy per unit
of gross domestic product—is falling,
Morse said. The amount of oil neces-

sary to produce a given level of gross
domestic production is declining as a
result of “economic maturing,” conservation, and increased energy. In 19952005, global GDP growth averaged 3%
vs. a 1.7% average oil demand growth.
Yet US oil intensity is almost double
that of Japan and western European
countries, while China and India stand
at twice the world average. Oil-intensive countries, of course, run increased
risks from sustained high crude prices,
which have increased because of greater
demand.
Morse noted the “gradual numbing” of consumers to higher oil prices,
since world demand for crude increased
annually September 2002-September
2005 despite rising crude prices.

Production outlook
The International Energy Agency
in Paris and OPEC members expect
non-OPEC supply growth to be equal
to or better than demand growth. IEA
is projecting non-OPEC production
will grow 1.68 million b/d, while a
more optimistic OPEC sees non-OPEC
production growing by 1.77 million
b/d. But Lehman Bros. figures nonOPEC production will grow by only 1
million b/d—“perhaps by much less,
depending on disruptions in 2007.”
Added production by non-OPEC
countries will come primarily from
off West Africa, the deepwater Gulf
of Mexico, and the Caspian region,
Morse said.
Morse said OPEC output would need

to increase “by at least 700,000 b/d”
to meeting incremental demand in
2007, but the cartel’s growth capacity
is limited. That means tight oil markets
in 2007, “perhaps very tight,” he said.
At this point, crude production capacity all depends on developments within
the OPEC countries, with continued
political risks in Nigeria, Iran, Iraq, and
Venezuela.
Lehman Bros. is projecting distillation and upgrading capacity to
grow substantially by the end of this
decade, with planned gross additions
of 1.5 million b/d in 2008, 1.9 million in 2009, and 3.2 million b/d in
2010. ✦

OCS leasing bill pulled from House ﬂoor
US House leaders pulled the Senate’s
Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas leasing reform bill from the floor on Dec. 5
because there were not enough votes to
pass it under special fast-track rules.
Proponents had pushed to get S.
3711 on the calendar under a rules suspension to keep it from being amended.
But they apparently lacked the votes to
reach the two-thirds majority required
in such cases. The bill must pass the
House without amendments to avoid
a conference and move directly to the
president for enactment.

Louisiana representatives and senators from both parties say passage of the
Senate’s OCS bill is vital since it contains
a provision giving Gulf Coast states
except Florida a portion of federal OCS
oil and gas revenue.
Louisiana Reps. Bobby Jindal (R)
and Charlie Melancon (D) were the two
primary sponsors of HR 4761, a more
aggressive OCS leasing reform bill that
would have given coastal states beyond
the Gulf of Mexico a means to share
federal revenue in exchange for allowing leasing off their coastlines. ✦

PERSONNEL MOVES AND PROMOTIONS

Petrobras changes international area executives
Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras)
has made several changes to its
international area executive staff, all
effective Jan. 1.
Alberto Guimaraes, general executive director of Petrobras Energia SA
since 2002, has been appointed president of Petrobras America Inc. Prior to
his assignment to Argentina, he held
various positions, including executive
manager for new business and superintendent of the former commercial
department.
Petrobras Energia Reﬁning &
Petrochemicals Director Carlos Fontes
succeeds Guimaraes as general executive director of Petrobras Energia.
Fontes, a chemical engineer, has been
in Argentina since 2004. Before that,
he held various positions, including
products and reﬁning processes manager, petrochemical projects manager,
petrochemical executive manager, and
president of Petroquisa.
Renato Tadeu Bertani, currently
the managing director of Petrobras
America, has been named executive
manager for the Americas, Africa, and

Inc., Texas Eastern Products Pipeline Co.
LLC, and TEPPCO Partners LP to divest
their interests in land, pipelines, and
other assets at the NGL storage site east
of Houston by Dec. 31.
Agreements under which the partnership was formed require TE Products
to offer the interests to Louis Dreyfus
on the same terms proposed by any
third party, the FTC said on Nov. 27.
Louis Dreyfus then has 30 days to exercise the right of first refusal.
In the application, Duncan and the
three firms he directly or indirectly
controls ask to divest their interests in
the Mont Belvieu storage partnership to
Louis Dreyfus to satisfy the FTC order.

Eurasia at the international area at the
company’s headquarters.
Bertani joined Petrobras in 1976 and
has served in several technical and
managerial positions, including exploration manager and general manager
of the Potiguar basin in Rio Grande
do Norte, new business manager, and
exploration and production director of
the subsidiary Petrobras Internacional
SA (Braspetro). He also has served as
general manager for Petrobras UK Ltd.
and from 2001 as president of Petrobras America.
Joao Carlos Araujo Figueira, executive manager for the Americas, Africa,
and Eurasia at the international area
since August 2004, will become E&P
director of Petrobras America.
Figueira, a geophysicist, has held
several technical and managerial positions in the company’s international
activities, including in the UK and Angola. He has served as E&P director of
Braspetro, which was incorporated to
Petrobras, and also as executive manager of the company’s international
area since its creation in 2000.

FTC will accept public comments on
the application through Dec. 27.
FTC’s order came from its Aug. 18
challenge of a 2005 acquisition that
combined Enterprise Product Partners
and TEPPCO Partners’ NGL storage
businesses at Mont Belvieu. It said the
transaction likely would result in higher
prices and degraded service by reducing the number of salt dome storage
providers there to three from four.

Cottonwood sale
The sale will result in a pretax gain
of $22 million to Mariner in the fourth
quarter. Mariner will not be required to
fund $21 million of development costs
necessary to establish first production,

Other moves
St. Mary Land & Exploration Co.
Pres. and Chief Operating Ofﬁcer Tony
Best, who joined the company in June,
will transition into his new role as chief
executive ofﬁcer on Feb. 26, 2007. On
this same date, Chief Executive Mark
Hellerstein, who has been with the
company for 15 years, will become
nonexecutive chairman.
In addition, St. Mary hired Javan
Ottoson as chief operating ofﬁcer, effective Dec. 18. At that time, Best will
relinquish the chief operating ofﬁcer
position but will continue to serve as
president of the company.
Ottoson has 23 years of experience
in the energy industry, most recently
with Energy Partners Ltd. in New
Orleans, where he served as senior
vice-president, drilling and engineering. He also managed the Permian
assets for Unocal Corp. subsidiary Pure
Resources Inc. and its successor owner,
Chevron Corp., from 2003-06.
Prior to that, Ottoson worked 20
years for ARCO in management and
operational roles, including president
of ARCO China, commercial director
of ARCO British, and vice-president of
operations and development, ARCO
Permian.

estimated to occur in first quarter 2007.
Consequently, Mariner’s 2006
capital spending forecast of $525-545
million (excluding hurricane repairs
and acquisitions) is now expected to
be about $504-524 million (excluding hurricane repairs, acquisitions, and
dispositions).
Mariner acquired its interest in the
Cottonwood project from Petrobras
in April 2005 when Mariner allowed
Petrobras access to Noble Drilling Inc.’s
Noble Lorris Bouzigard deepwater
semisubmersible, which Mariner has
under long-term contract. Since acquiring its interest in 2005, Mariner participated with Petrobras in two sidetrack
wells in the project. ✦

This two-part article summarizes a
series of tests indicating that a technology now exists for near real-time 3D
mapping of the reservoir-scale permeability field using surface-based seismic
acquisition networks.
Despite decades of work, hydrocarbon production, particularly that of oil,
remains highly inefficient with often
up to 60-70% of the known resource
being left unproduced. It is generally acknowledged that the principal
obstacle to more efficient production
is the absence of a means of accurately
mapping the reservoir “architecture” or
permeability field.
Our work, combining a new geomechanical model for the behavior of
fluids in the earth’s brittle crust in combination with a previously unexploited
seismic imaging technology, seismic
emission tomography (SET), is shown
to allow direct imaging and mapping
of the reservoir-scale permeability field
geometry.
This technique could have important
implications for improved efficiencies
of hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation.

Why imaging is difﬁcult
The most ubiquitous secondary rock
structure is fracture.
For example, no rocks are known
to be totally devoid of joints. Because
fractures scale like earthquakes, i.e.,
there is an inverse power law relationship between size and frequency, it may
be said that there is no such thing as
an “unfractured” rock, at least at some
scale.
So to varying degrees all
reservoirs are
fractured reservoirs, and fractures can be
said to play an
important and often critical role in the
architecture of all fluid reservoirs. The
relationship between fracture size and
frequency indicates that because there
are many orders of magnitude more
smaller fractures than large ones, it is
highly likely that much of the permeability resides in the smaller fractures.
Thus the ability to image the full
spectrum of crack sizes would seem to
be a requirement for direct permeability field mapping.
Recognizing fracture’s critical role

a near-critical state, i.e., it is close to
brittle failure almost everywhere, where
failure is manifest principally by slip
on preexisting fractures. Just how close
has been established by analyzing stress
drop data associated with microseismic
activity. Statistical analysis of the data4
shows that small (±0.01 bar) perturbations of the ambient stress field are
sufficient to cause failure of critically
oriented cracks.
Because it was unclear how the crack
cascade mechanism could result in the
increases in fluid pressure (Pf), let alone
the sustained increase in Pf required to
increase production, it was suggested1
40

that the phenomena was the result of
a fluid pressure “Pf wave” propagating
through the hydraulically linked fracture network connecting the wells.
A wave of this type has been found
experimentally5 and is referred to as a
“slow wave.”
Combining the Pf wave hypothesis
with the foregoing empirical data forms
the basis of a simple geomechanical
model. The model predicts that the
response of the earth’s brittle crust
to a change in fluid pressure should
result in systematic slip and associated
brittle failure of the hydraulically linked

fractures connected to the point of Pf
perturbation.
Acoustic energy (AE) generated by
the slip events can be detected. Thus
propagation of the Pf “wave” through
the critically oriented fracture network
forming the permeability field will
produce AE emissions resulting in its
“illumination.” Recording the AE emissions should allow direct mapping of
the fracture-related permeability field.
The following outlines this model:
1. Given: The state of the earth’s
brittle crust is everywhere near failure.
2. A change in Pf at a well changes
the stress state at the well.
3. The change in Pf propagates
through the hydraulically linked fracture network connected to the perturbation point changing the stress state as
it moves.
4. This fracture network consists of
preexisting cracks critically oriented for
slip that are also fluid filled and therefore the weakest fractures.
5. Because stress drops on the order
of ±0.01 bar are sufficient to cause failure and because changes in Pf induced
by production are on the order of
hundreds of bars, the Pf wave will cause
failure of the critically oriented cracks
forming the permeability field thereby
“illuminating” it.
The problem is thus reduced to one
of being able to image the AE emitted
by the slip on preexisting cracks across
the broadest spectrum of crack sizes
possible. If this can be done in near
real time and at the reservoir scale then
direct mapping of the permeability field
is possible.

Imaging microseismicity
Because there is a continuous spectrum of crack sizes, the distinction
between microseismicity and creep is
arbitrary.
Creep, for instance, is defined as
the processes that allow continuous
deformation and so is scale dependent.
Although microseismic events are considered to be larger than creep events,
a rule of thumb distinguishes them on
the basis of whether or not the failure

events are resolvable under ordinary
field conditions.
If the event is resolvable it is considered microseismicity; if not, it is
considered creep. The distinction is
ambiguous as the ability to detect and
resolve an individual event (microseismicity) is largely dependent on how
close the event is to the receiver.
The detection of microseismic events
using surface networks is severely
hampered by attenuation and noise. The
most robust form of microseismicity
detection requires the use of downhole
seismometers in the effort to place
the detectors as close to the sources as
possible. This is the method in general
use for monitoring induced fracture
stimulations. The use of downhole
instruments to detect microseismicity
suffers from a number of well-known
drawbacks.
1. It requires a dedicated well ideally
within 0.5 mile of the treatment well.
2. The ability to detect resolvable
events drops off with the inverse square
of the distance to the source. Thus the
spectrum of events, already limited by
the resolvability requirement, is further
filtered by distance.
3. Because of the inverse power
law relationship between the size and
number of events, there are orders of
magnitude more unresolvable events
than resolvable. Thus only a limited part
of the crack size spectrum constituting
the permeability field can be seen.
This set of problems means that it is
at least highly impractical if not impossible to map the reservoir scale permeability using downhole instruments.
Accomplishing this task clearly requires
a different technology.

The SET technique
Seismic emission tomography
emerged from the technical section of
the Nuclear Test Ban treaty in the late
1980s and early 1990s.
It is geared specifically toward
identifying “point” sources (meaning
dimensions less than a minimum processed wavelength in scale) of energy.
SET can also find a sufficiently “rough”

surface, meaning a surface that behaves
like a bunch of individual scatters.
Identification of a scatterer as well
as point sources is done by coherence
(using semblance as the metric). This
requires multiple channels of on-theground recording.
A signal will show up only if it arrives at all the channels within a certain
time window. Noise will cancel out (or
at least not add together as rapidly).
To first order, the signal to noise
ratio behaves as the square root of the
number of channels available. The best
one can do with any technique in order
to determine if one is looking at signal
or noise is to compute the appropriate statistics. For SET these statistics are
generally simple to derive.
The product of SET is a “three dimensional image of the medium where
the distribution of brightness shows the
distribution of active volumes...(it is)
a portrait of the medium in terms of
its ability to produce or scatter seismic
energy.”6
SET uses a surface-based seismic
network (Fig. 1) to beam form the
selected volume of the earth’s crust. For
any given time interval the AE emissions
for each voxel are stacked to provide
a value for the AE emission at each associated grid point of the volume. The
values for each voxel of the volume
are then normalized against all the AE
values of the volume and contoured to
provide an image of the AE emission
field (Fig. 2).
An example of a set of map slices
through two SET volumes is shown in
Fig. 3. The use of SET allows 1) the entire spectrum of active crack sizes to be
imaged; 2) the use of a surface network
for monitoring AE emissions; 3) the
area covered is limited only by the size
of the network deployed.
It is clear that SET has none of the
limitations that the use of downhole
instruments for monitoring microseismicity has; there are, however, some
tradeoffs:
1. SET cannot locate individual
cracks but instead plots the distribution
of AE emissions, where the primary

emission sources are the product of
crack failure.
2. SET cannot currently distinguish
the crack sizes generating the AE. This
is because the amount of AE being
emitted by any given voxel is a function
of the total crack area formed in the
volume for the particular stack interval,
i.e., the AE can result from either many
small failures or from a single large
failure.
3. The resolution of the AE locations
is set by the voxel size, which is in turn
a function of the number of receivers
and the local environment. The current
theoretical maximum resolution is 10
m, i.e., voxel size is 10 by 10 by 10 m,
however 5-m resolution may be possible under the right set of conditions.

Billions of barrels in Bakken recovery seen in Williston
Alan Petzet
Chief Editor-Exploration
The Bakken formation play in the
Williston basin is writing a new chapter
in the oil reserves history of the US onshore Lower 48, thought by many to be
a mature and fast-depleting province.
The play is spearheading production
and reserves increases in Montana and
North Dakota and prompting reevaluation of earlier resource assessments for
the play, said the US Energy Information
Administration.
EIA’s report attributed to the US
Geological Survey an estimate of the resource for the entire Bakken formation
at 271-503 billion bbl in place, with a
mean of 413 billion bbl. USGS noted
that it has never published those figures,
which are preliminary results from
research that was never completed and
therefore never technically and scientifically peer-reviewed.
The USGS’s 1995 assessment stated
that the Bakken might have generated
billions of barrels of oil but included no
specific figures. A new USGS assessment
of the entire basin, due out in about a
year, will contain a numerical estimate
of the technically recoverable oil resource in the Bakken, the USGS said.
“If the potential bears out, this
could (depending on recovery factors)
increase the estimate of technically recoverable crude oil resources in the US
by billions of barrels,” EIA said in what
it promised to be the first in a series of
reports on technology-based oil and
natural gas plays. By comparison, the
most recent estimate of the technically
recoverable crude oil resource of the
entire US is 174.67 billion bbl, excluding the Bakken. US proved reserves at

discovered field in the Middle Bakken
formation to date.
Headington Oil Co., private Dallas
operator, has estimated oil in place at
5 million bbl/sq mile in the Bakken in
this field.
“With an assumed 10% average
recovery factor, Headington estimates
primary oil recovery could be 500
million bbl from Elm Coulee field,”
EIA said. The 1995 USGS assessment
estimated ultimate Bakken recovery at
151 million bbl.
EIA predicted, “It is likely that other
energy resources also await discovery or
rebirth in the US as new technology allows us to locate, define, interpret, and
extract them economically.”
The continuous nature of the Bakken formation means its hydrocarbons,
deposited during the Upper Devonian
and Lower Mississippian periods, have

Dakota and 3,100 ft in Manitoba and
Saskatchewan.
As the Williston basin subsided, EIA
explained, massive low-permeability
carbonates above and below the Bakken
acted as seals. The increased temperatures and pressures that accompanied
subsidence thermally converted the
kerogen content of the shales into oil.
“Sealed with no conduit or highpermeability formation adjacent to the
Bakken formation to allow the petroleum to escape, the internal fluid pressure within the shales rose and eventually fractured the shales and the middle
member from within,” EIA explained.

Tobago.
In April 2006, Mike
Coolen was named president and chief
operating officer of Canadian Superior.
He had been vice-president in charge
of offshore operations and a member of
the company’s board for several years.
At the company’s Halifax offices,
Coolen told OGJ that he spent 20 years
at Mobil Oil Canada and saw the pace
change after moving from a major to
a smaller independent. “One of the
differences is your ability to implement
change rapidly. A large company has
more structure and bureaucracy and
can’t operate on an ad hoc basis. At a
smaller company everyone can take on a
lot more initiative to make changes and
add value. This is a real advantage for us.
We can be very responsive to changes
in oil and gas prices and tax regime.”
The hurdles to fund projects can be
rigorous, Coolen noted. But business
fundamentals don’t change, whether
you’re at a little company or a big company. “We must manage the portfolio
within our ability to fund projects.”
“It’s funny—people wonder how a
small Canadian company can have the
technical ability to drill these offshore
wells. But it’s not the size of the company that matters—we’re the same size
as any other company’s team looking
after a particular basin.”
Canadian Superior has about 50
employees, with more added during
offshore drilling, a “great staff of dayto-day operations people,” he said. They
were all experienced hires, with many
on the offshore team having 20-30
years in the North Sea and elsewhere,

(Petrotrin).
• Block 5(c) “Intrepid,” 80,041
acres, awarded May 2004; productionsharing contract (PSC) signed July 20,
2005.
Coolen feels positive about the
company’s prospects in Trinidad. He
noted that 15 of BP’s top 25 producing
wells worldwide are located in Trinidad.
Canadian Superior’s Block 5(c) offsets
BG and ChevronTexaco’s Dolphin and
Dolphin Deep gas discoveries, as well as
BPTT’s Chacalaca gas discovery.
Block 5(c) may contain more than
4 tcf unproven, unrisked reserves, and
the company has three well locations
selected based on a 3D seismic survey.
“Hopefully we’ll be successful in all the
wells—we’re not waiting for the third
to hit.”
Canadian Superior will use the Kan
Tan IV semisubmersible to drill three
back-to-back wells off Trinidad in 2007.
(The company announced the third
well for Block 5(c) on Nov. 14.)
The rig is a third generation,
enhanced Pacesetter design, and will
be delivered to Canadian Superior in
early first-quarter 2007, following its
current refurbishment at the AmFELS
yard in Brownsville, Tex. The Kan Tan IV
will have a new accommodation unit,
updated BOP equipment, 1 million lb
Varco top drive, and a Vetco riser.
After commissioning and field testing, the rig will be towed to Trinidad.
The Kan Tan IV is managed by A.P.
Moller-Maersk AS of Copenhagen and

Canadian Superior is the largest acreage holder off Nova Scotia, with 1.29
net million acres on six exploration
licenses. The company has six prospects
on the Sable Island Bank, along the
Scotian Shelf:
• Marquis (two licenses), 111,000
acres licensed Jan. 1, 2001, drilled in
2002.
• Mayflower, 712,000 acres licensed
Jan. 1, 2002.
• Mariner, 101,800 acres licensed
Jan. 2, 2002, drilled 2003-04.
• Marauder and Marconi, 371,000
acres licensed Jan. 1, 2004.
There are many play types among the
acreage, including deepwater turbidites
at Mayflower, shallow water Abenaki
reef plays at Marquis, and shallow water
Cretaceous plays at Mariner, Marauder,
and Marconi.
But the basin has been historically
slow to develop. Coolen said that one
of the reasons is the prevalence of gas
and small reservoirs. The early explorationists—Shell and Mobil—were oil
seekers. It took the discovery of Venture,
Thebaud, North Triumph, and others,
leading to the Sable development project, to get development rolling.
Now, technology is catching up, he
says, and people are finding better ways
to develop gas and condensate resources
on the shelf. Small discoveries have
more opportunity to be developed than
ever before.
Deep Panuke is a good example of
technology allowing companies develop
plays efficiently (OGJ, Nov. 20, 2006, p.
47). Using a MOPU will be an advantage over a fixed platform, he said, and
expects about 1 tcf in the deep gas reef
play; the four wells tested are capable of
delivering 400 Mcfd.

The company is targeting 14 sands,

Engineering manager Mark Gillis
said they have designed the well with
six casing strings and plan a comprehensive suite of wireline logs. The
biggest challenge is gaining a workable
level of confidence in pore pressure
prediction, Gillis said. Canadian Superior uses GMI software and Knowledge
Systems Inc. personnel will be on site
during drilling. The well design is based
on activity in surrounding fields and assumes a normal compaction model.
After setting the conductor and running riser, the well will be drilled with
water to about 1,000 ft. The company
will switch to synthetic mud about
3,200-3,500 ft below the rotary table,
and expects to reach 16.5-17 ppg at TD,
assuming a pressure ramp in the lower
section of the well. Without the ramp,
the mud weights could stay around 13
ppg. Baroid is contracted to provide
drilling fluids.
After drilling and testing the Intrepid
prospect, the rig will be moved to drill
the Bounty prospect, anticipated to be
another 80 days plus 20 days to test.
They have “an attractive day rate” for
the rig, Coolen said, because of Canadian Superior’s flexibility with scheduling around the rig refurbishment. “We
started conversations with Maersk in
2005, months before the market started
escalating.”
If they are successful, Canadian Superior expects to build a core area in Trinidad over the short and longer term.
“Success in Trinidad & Tobago would
have a direct and immediate affect on
our offshore Nova Scotia business.”

A new cubic equation of state (EOS)
predicts densities of Western Canadian
heavy oils and their SARA (saturates,
aromatics, resins, and asphaltenes) fractions. The method considers the SARA
fraction of heavy oil as a pseudocomponent.
A comparison to experimental
density data shows that the new EOS is
more accurate than the Peng-Robinson

Marginal wells account for much US production
Marginal wells remain
an important segment of
US oil and gas production operations.
In its latest report,
the Interstate Oil and
Production
Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC) estimated
that these wells in 2005 accounted for
about 17% of oil and 9% of natural gas
produced onshore US
The report “Marginal Wells: Fuel for
Economic Growth,” October 2006, said
that these wells in 2005 produced more
than 321 million bbl of crude and 1.76
tcf of natural gas, with average daily
production reaching its highest in 10
years.
The report outlined also the economic benefits these wells create. It said
in 2005, states collected more than $1.2
billion in taxes from marginal wells.
In the US, every dollar of marginal oil
and gas production created $1.01 of
economic activity.

Marginal wells
IOGCC defines marginal oil wells
as those producing 10 b/d or fewer.
50

It reported that in 2005 the US had
401,072 marginal or stripper oil wells
producing about 2.2 b/d on average
(Table 1).
The organization defines marginal
gas wells as those producing 60 Mcfd
or fewer, and its report noted that during the last decade the number of marginal gas wells has steadily increased to
288,898 wells (Table 2).
Its report said that US onshore oil
production in 2005 was about 5.1 million b/d with marginal wells producing about 881,000 bo/d. Marginal gas
production was about 4.8 bcfd in 2005.
In its statistics on plugged and abandoned wells (Tables 1 and 2), IOGCC
does not include temporarily abandoned wells but only wells permanently
plugged. These in 2005 amounted to
11,058 oil wells and 4,515 gas wells.
Not included in IOGCC P&A’d statistics
are orphaned wells, which are wells
producing 10 bo/d or fewer and have
not been plugged, but whose owners are either insolvent or cannot be
located.
The report noted that 11 states have
about 73% of the marginal oil wells.

These states, which exclude wells in the
Appalachian basin, also have 44% of the
marginal gas wells.
The Appalachian basin in 2005 accounted for about 50% of the marginal
gas wells and almost 29% of the marginal gas production, the report found.
The statistics show that Texas has
the most marginal wells, with 124,116
marginal oil and 37,396 marginal gas
wells that during 2005 produced about
140 million bbl of oil and 302 bcf of
gas.

IOGCC
The Interstate Oil and Gas Compact
Commission is a multistate government
agency whose stated goal is to promote
the conservation and efficient recovery of US oil and natural gas resources
while protecting health, safety, and the
environment.
IOGCC members include governors
from 37 states (30 members and 7 associate states) that produce most of the
US oil and natural gas. The organization
also has seven international affiliates.
It has monitored the status of marginal oil wells since the 1940s. ✦

Initial mercury measurements
in 2000 for gas upstream of Khalda
Petroleum Co.’s Salam gas plant in
Egypt’s Western Desert showed mercury
content between 75 and 175 μg/std. cu
m. Concern for the plant’s downstream
aluminum heat exchangers led the
company to decide, therefore, to install
mercury-removal equipment.
To avoid mercury condensation
under pipeline
conditions, mercury
should be removed
from sales gases to
less than 20 μg/std.
cu m.1
The company
evaluated two
alternatives—UOP’s HgSIV adsorbents
and Puraspec’s 1156 absorbents—for
removing mercury from natural gas.
This article will review the corrosion
mechanism of mercury and aluminum,
the analysis techniques for mercury in
natural gas, and the mercury-removal
techniques from natural gas and present the process design, field analysis
procedures, and performance of Salam
mercury-removal unit.

Netherlands, the mercury content of
natural gas varies from “nondemonstrable” to about 300 μg/std. cu m, where
250 μg/std. cu m is considered a high
concentration.9
Implications of the effect of mercury
in natural gas were not reported until
1973, when a catastrophic failure of
aluminum heat exchangers occurred at
Skikda LNG plant in Algeria (OGJ, Sept.
15, 1975, p. 192). It was found that
a combination of mercury and water
temperatures around 0.0º C. caused
corrosion in the aluminum tubes (constructed of aluminum alloy 6061). This
discovery prompted several research
studies into this phenomenon.
After the Skikda failure, a study of
the Groningen field in Holland revealed
similar corrosion in the gas gathering

Dual amalgamation, thermal desorption at 800º C., and analysis by atomic

plant and Shams manifold are lower
than at Qasr wells. That may be related
to the ability of the mercury to precipitate on the internal surface of the
pipeline.
Bingham states that as mercury
enters gathering system pipelines with
gas, it is reduced because of chemisorptions onto steel pipe walls.2 Leeper suggests the following reactions as driving
this reduction:10
H2S + Fe2O3 → 2FeO +S + H2O
and
Hg + S ↔ HgS
Trace quantities of H2S are the catalyst for the reaction of mercury with
iron oxide from the pipe. The mercurysulfide precipitates and is adsorbed onto
the pipe wall. Grotewold reports that
for 110-km pipeline, mercury content
decreased to 20 μg/std. cu m from
about 50 μg/std. cu m.13 This reduction
is influenced by pipe wall roughness
and adhesive forces.

New buried identification marker technology offers potential
improvements in oil and
gas pipeline-maintenance

tion of the likelihood of
accidental damage and
associated safety hazards.
Electronic marking, locating, and
identifying of systems used by telephone companies, power companies,
water and sewer utilities, and cable
companies can also protect underground gas and oil pipelines in urban
and rural settings by marking road
crossings and important buried features
such as valves, stubs, and turn points.
The US natural gas infrastructure
includes about 1.4 million miles of
underground pipeline. US Office of
Pipeline Safety records show that during the first 6 months of 2006 there
were 16 incidents of third-party excavation damage to natural gas distribution
pipelines at a cost of $1.22 million, one
related death, and two serious injuries.
Four incidents of third-party excavation damage to transmission pipelines
during this same 6-month period
totaled $173,000 in damages. During
all of 2005, there were 19 such natural
gas transmission line damage accidents
(costing $2.48 million) and 67 distribution line incidents (with $8.5 million
in damages).1
Unintended contact during excavation or trenching commonly causes gaspipeline accidents, which occur when
construction companies and grading
crews perform work without proper
one-call notification or fail to follow
common-sense digging practices.

Locating, marking
Traditional utility-locating equipment injects an RF signal into a conductive object in the ground, such as a pipe
or cable, to indicate the presence and
path of a buried utility. This technology
only approximates utility depth and
location and works only with metallic
objects. Passive markers buried adjacent to utility components respond to

signals from a locator device and can be
pinpointed precisely as to location and
subsurface depth.
Electronic underground markers
require no external power source, and
are not disturbed by surface grading or
construction. Their usefulness, however,
is limited as they indicate simply that
some utility is buried at the marked
point. The effective message of an electronic marker is:
“dig here to learn
more.”
A new buried
identification
marker system incorporates preprogrammed marker
identification, making it possible to locate and identify quickly the depth and
exact properties of the marked object
without excavation.
The electronic system uses 4-in. diameter plastic balls that are located and
read with hand-held locators by means
of utility-specific radio-frequency
signals. Individual colors and interrogation frequencies distinguish between
gas, waste water, potable water, CATV,
telephone, electrical power, and general

number and associated bar code from
the ball and placing it on a field map
provides an initial record of the marked
location. The same details are temporarily stored in the marker locator device
for downloading to a computer. Stored
data update the utility mapping and
infrastructure database.
An accessory device for the marker
locator measures and records global positioning satellite (GPS) coordinates for
each marked location. This GPS information is also stored in the unit during
each shift for downloading in support
of GIS mapping.

Application example
BP Gas has adopted ID markers for
protection of rural road pipeline crossings as part of its San Juan operations
center in northwest New Mexico. This
center oversees 5,500 sq miles in three
counties, which include several thousand natural gas wells and nearly 500
rural road pipeline crossings. Because
a substantial portion of BP gas lines
in this operating region is made of
fiberglass, they cannot be located with
traditional equipment.
Crews typically grade the gravel or
dirt roads in the area at least twice a
year. Because grade levels may change
depending on soil conditions, rain,
winter runoff, and grading activity, road
crews need accurate and dependable
information on the depth of every pipeline before they can safely grade a road.
BP’s ground-disturbance policy mandates that no mechanical equipment be
permitted within 24 in. of buried facilities to safeguard against injury, shield
the underground infrastructure from
damage, and protect the environment.
After a preliminary field test of ID
markers, BP instituted a program of
marking every road crossing in the
region, generally using three programmed ball markers per crossing: one
over the pipe on each side of the road
and one in the center of the road.
The marking program performed
vacuum excavation of pipelines at each
road crossing, followed by backfilling
to a measured depth (typically 3-4 ft

Backfilling the exposed pipes to a measured level allows placement of the ball marker at a known distance
from the pipe (Fig. 4).

Marker read-write units load the ball location relative to the pipe, ID number, GPS coordinates, and any
other identifying information onto the ball before burial.The same units will later use this information
to confirm the precise location and depth of each marked crossing (Fig. 5).
below the surface). The on site team
would then program an identification
marker ball with the measured distance
from the pipe to the electronic marker

and place it in the partially backfilled
hole.
The locator accurately measures the
distance from the surface to the marker

(which varies with grading) and reads
the fixed marker-to-pipe distance recorded on the marker, making calculation of the total surface-to-pipe distance
for each marker easy (Figs. 1-5).
Details programmed on each marker
include company name, measured
depth from marker to pipeline, and
pipe size and type.
County road-grading contractors in
this New Mexico region can now access
maps that show the location and depth
of each buried gas line crossing, each
of which is also registered with the
New Mexico one-call system. BP will
periodically monitor gas line depths in
the region, using marker locaters to find
and read the buried marker balls and
updating published records appropriately.
High-risk areas where erosion is
likely to lead to grade shifts or where
soil conditions could cause line movement are monitored most closely.
BP is now installing ID markers at
rural locations in Colorado. This technology may eventually be used in other
BP operating areas having numerous
rural road crossings, including Wyoming, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and
Louisiana. The company anticipates that
ID marking will result in measurable
cost savings because it eliminates the
need to periodically pothole each road
crossing to maintain ongoing accuracy
of pipe depth records. ✦

From the Subscribers Only area of

An open letter
to the noble
Iranian people
Noble Iranians,
Because your president, Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad, took the trouble to write a
letter to US citizens—“noble Americans,” in
his words—a reciprocal gesture, albeit from
a lesser ofﬁce, seems appropriate.
Your president upholds unassailable
values: “compassion, empathy, respect for
the rights of human beings, securing justice
and equity, and defending the innocent and

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

the weak against oppressors and bullies.”
Yet Americans hear of state-sponsored
political murders inside and outside your
country, of bullying by Basij militia and Hizbollah vigilantes, of rigged elections, and of
authoritarian rule by the religious leaders
to whom Mr. Ahmadinejad answers. His
lectures on human rights and defense
against oppressors are, therefore, perplexing.
Your president disparages America’s
military presence in Iraq and support for
what he calls “the Zionists.” Yet he doesn’t
mention his regime’s support for insurrectionists in Iraq, vocal truculence toward
Israel, and development of what most
observers believe to be nuclear weapons.
In fact, Mr. Ahmadinejad seems to want the
US to withdraw from Iraq only so Iran can
move in. You Iranians know only too well
that your president, whom a majority of
voters elected, takes his orders from clerics
for whom you never have the chance to
vote. Experience with contradictions like
these might be what makes Iranians better
than Americans at distinguishing politics
from culture.
Some Americans recognize that those
“Down with the USA” signs in Iranian hotel
lobbies don’t speak for all Iranians. And
some try to view Iranian political emanations in the context of the autocracy that
shapes them. But not many. The only image
most Americans have of Iranians is of angry young men punching the air and cursing the “great Satan.” That’s regrettable. The
image inﬂuences government behavior.
You would do well, therefore, not to expect a letter from President Bush—not that
it would be a bad idea for him to send you
one. He works in a frenzied media culture
that tends not to differentiate a people,
like you, from those who govern, like Mr.
Ahmadinejad. Sorry, but that’s politics.
Besides, it’s football season, and most
Americans already have forgotten about
your president’s letter.
Sincerely,
An American

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

Cold weather raises energy prices
Energy prices soared to the highest levels in months during the ﬁnal 4 days of
November as an arctic cold front moved across the Midwest US toward the East
Coast, dumping several feet of snow in its wake.
Temperatures plummeted below freezing along the Texas Gulf Coast. The National
Weather Service predicted below-normal temperatures in the eastern US during the
ﬁrst 2 weeks of December. With the spreading cold front, analysts at Enerfax Daily
said, “Heating demand across the US will climb to 10% above normal by Dec. 4,
from 57% below average [on Nov. 27].” During November, the ﬁrst complete month
of the current heating season, temperatures averaged 4.7% colder than last year but
9.1% warmer than normal, said weather forecasters. Natural gas futures jumped
to $8/MMbtu, pulling crude futures above $60/bbl as post-holiday trading resumed
Nov. 27 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The January contract for benchmark
sweet, light crudes gained $1.08 to $60.32/bbl Nov. 27 on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The January natural gas contract bumped up by 28¢ to $8/MMbtu. By Nov.
30, the January crude contract was trading at $63.13/bbl. The January gas contract
traded as high as $9.05/MMbtu on NYMEX before closing at $8.84/MMbtu, down by
2.7¢ in that session on forecasts of moderate weather following the cold snap.
Energy prices also were buoyed as the US dollar dropped to a fresh 20-month
low against the euro and a 14-year low against the British pound. The average price
for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ basket of 11 benchmark
crudes “has risen by just 0.13 euro over the past week compared to the $1.58/bbl rise
in dollar terms,” Paul Horsnell, Barclays Capital Inc. of London, reported Nov. 29.
Analysts at Raymond James & Associates Inc. explained, “Many commodities,
priced in dollars, become relatively cheaper for buyers outside of the US when the
dollar weakens.” They also noted a new report by McKinsey & Co. that projects world
energy demand to rise 2.2%/year through 2020, outpacing the 1.6% growth seen in
the past decade.
Inventories
The US Energy Information Administration said commercial crude inventories in
the US fell by 300,000 bbl to 340.8 million bbl during the week ended Nov. 24, ending a 4-week build. Gasoline stocks dropped 600,000 bbl to 201.1 million bbl in the
same period. Distillate fuel inventories fell for the eighth consecutive week, down 1
million bbl to 132.8 million bbl in the latest period.
“In just 7 weeks, some 90% of the US oil product overhang has disappeared, and
inventories have drawn relative to their 5-year average at a rate of over 1 million
b/d,” said Horsnell. “Seven weeks ago, the combined build above the 5-year average for just gasoline and diesel combined was 35.4 million bbl, whereas today that
combined build stands at just 1.7 million bbl. Heating oil inventories have also fallen
relative to the 5-year average, although in general they have spent the whole year
describing a very normal pattern from a slightly higher than normal base.”
He said, “Heating oil output has been slow to ramp up this year, and from this
point the race is on between that ramping up of supply and the ramping up of demand as determined by weather.” On Nov. 30, EIA reported the withdrawal of 32 bcf
of natural gas from US underground storage in the week ended Nov. 24. That was
above the consensus of Wall Street analysts and compared with withdrawals of 1 bcf
the previous week and 51 bcf during the same period last year. US gas storage now
stands at 3.4 tcf, up by 185 bcf from year-ago levels and 230 bcf above the 5-year
average.
OPEC
Venezuela said it would propose another cut in production quotas by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries at the group’s scheduled Dec. 14 meeting in
Nigeria. President Hugo Chavez wants to keep futures market prices close to $60/bbl
for benchmark US crude.
Meanwhile, Ecuador announced its intention to rejoin OPEC, and Sudan and
Angola also expressed interest in joining the cartel. “The sole addition of Ecuador
which pumps 540,000 b/d seemed inconsequential. However, by tallying Sudan
(500,000 b/d) and Angola (1.4 million b/d) the combined production of these three
nations represents approximately 8% of current OPEC production,” said Raymond
James analysts. “The addition of new member states to the organization would allow OPEC to [wield] further inﬂuence in its ability to sway production and pricing of
crude oil in world markets. No time frame has been set as to when the new members would be expected to join.”

“Subsea processing — a dream of offshore operators since the 1960s —
is ﬁnally moving into the mainstream of our industry. FMC’s goal is to make it
happen; to deliver complete, integrated subsea systems with proven reliability,
and to provide our clients with direct technical support for the life of the ﬁeld.”
— Peter Kinnear, President, FMC Technologies

FMC Technologies was expanding the frontiers of subsea production long before
the introduction of its rugged and reliable UWD-15 wellhead line in 1991.
Today, FMC is the world’s leading provider of complete subsea systems.
We face plenty of challenges. Replacement reserves are increasingly hard to ﬁnd.
Explorers are working in record water depths and dealing with extreme reservoir pressure
and temperature. There are shortages of every kind, from deepwater rigs to people with
the skill and experience to run them. And, with heavy oil accounting for the bulk of the
world’s remaining reserves, even the chemistry of the crude is a challenge.
One of the industry’s next frontiers is the ability to simply and reliably separate produced
ﬂuids on the seabed. The technology is emerging now to process oil, gas, water and sand
without the expense of ﬁrst lifting all of the produced ﬂuids to facilities on the surface.
Subsea processing also eliminates the need for offshore platforms in some new ﬁelds, and
can therefore accommodate longer distance transportation of hydrocarbons. This is
especially attractive in regions subject to climate extremes and seasonal storms.
The world’s energy future depends on such advanced technology.
Although there are still ample oil and gas reserves, they are increasingly
more difﬁcult to recover. Operators are drilling in record water depths and
targeting formations they would have bypassed just ﬁve years ago.
Operators are also working hard to recover more from their existing ﬁelds. In some cases,
producers are boosting recovery factors by 10 percent or more. The following pages explain some of the remarkable advances that are shaping the future of subsea production.

A History of Strategic Alliances
FMC Technologies is a global supplier of subsea
production systems including subsea trees, controls, manifolds and tie-in systems. From project
inception to abandonment, FMC delivers solutions
that lower costs and boost performance. Since we
entered the subsea market in the 1970s, our plan
has been to work closely with operators to develop
the technology they need.
The beneﬁts of strategic alliances ﬂow both ways.
While our customers get exactly the tools they
want, FMC Technologies gains experience on some
of the most challenging oil and gas developments in
the world. We are proud of these alliances, because
they have led to many of the breakthrough innovations that make today’s most productive subsea
developments possible.

Reducing costs
In a historic 1995 contract with Shell, Statoil, Total
and ExxonMobil, FMC Technologies promised to
ﬁnd technical solutions that would cut the high cost
of subsea systems by 75 percent over 10 years, a
promise that it kept.
“That is perhaps the main reason why our customers come back to us,” says Tore Halvorsen,
Vice President, FMC Technologies, Kongsberg,
Norway. “They have a ﬁrm belief in the extra
value of working with our company. Our customers see us as a solutions provider.”

2

Global experience
At any one time, FMC is working on more than 25
subsea projects worldwide, but two of the largest have captured the attention of the petroleum
industry. The ﬁrst is Norsk Hydro’s Ormen Lange
development in the North Sea. The project was
awarded in 2003 and is scheduled to come online in
2007. Ormen Lange (Long Snake) is Europe’s deepest subsea development (800-1000 m water depth).
It features a 120-kilometer (75-mile) pipeline from
the ﬁeld to onshore gas-treatment facilities off the
west coast of Norway.
The second of FMC’s current high-proﬁle projects is
Statoil’s Tordis improved oil-recovery (IOR) project.
The contract was awarded in 2005, with start-up
scheduled for October 2007. Tordis will host the
ﬁrst commercial subsea production system, which
will boost the amount of recoverable oil from the
current 49 percent to 55 percent — an addition of
19 million barrels from the Tordis separators alone
and 35 million barrels (including topside changes)
over the life of the ﬁeld.
In many ways, the experience gained through all of
our alliances since the late 1990s — and everything
we have learned about system reliability and quality
since then — has been leading toward the Tordis
development. Tordis is not just a milestone for the
industry; it is a vision of the future that incorporates numerous aspects of subsea technology as we

Game-Changing Innovation
FMC Technologies manufactures much of the hardware it sells in its global network of major manufacturing sites around the world. What we don’t build
is purchased from other suppliers, then certiﬁed for
subsea service according to our own rigorous standards. We use our experience to integrate complete
subsea systems and provide technical support for
the life of those ﬁelds.

ridgidized or preloaded operations. These modular
designs and multi-task running tools enable many
of the same components to be used across the
entire UWD-15 line.
Our UWD-15 tools also require fewer running
and test tools than any competing subsea drilling
system — a real advantage in crowded offshore
working conditions. These multi-functional tools
provide options for running and retrieving components, either individually or in combination with
other equipment, enabling fast, accurate and reliable UWD-15 system installation.

More than 1,500 subsea systems worldwide are equipped with
trees, controls, manifolds and tie-ins supplied by FMC Technologies.

FMC’s rugged and reliable subsea trees can handle working pressures up to 15,000 psi.

Subsea trees
FMC’s world-proven UWD-15 family of subsea
wellheads has been meeting customer demand for
weight-set installations, metal-to-metal seals, reliability and reduced cost since its introduction in 1991.
With working pressures up to 15,000 psi, the UWD15 wellheads are available for a complete range of
shallow-water and deepwater applications, including standard, shallow-water ﬂow, large-bore and

FMC is the dominant supplier of subsea HPHT systems, including
the ﬁrst producing system in the Shell Princess project in 2002.

FMC’s high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) subsea tree systems, which can handle pressures up to
15,000 psi and temperatures of 350 degrees F (177
degrees C), are the most technically advanced oil
and gas wellheads in the world. The trees are modular, so they can be reconﬁgured to meet customer
needs without the expense of custom design.

Electric subsea controls
FMC Technologies began developing subsea electric
controls in the 1970s and has been supplying commercial applications since 2001. Electric controls are
now an alternative to traditional hydraulic controls
in several subsea applications.
There are many economic, operational and environmental beneﬁts. Electric control systems powered
by rechargeable batteries eliminate the slower
response time of hydraulic controls, particularly in

deepwater applications. In addition, electric actuators can be operated faster and more precisely.
They even allow operators to monitor the mechanical condition of the valve and actuator, based on the
resistance the actuator must overcome to position
them. In the future, electric controls could be one of
the enabling technologies that make new developments possible, such as ultra-long tiebacks to existing platforms.

HOST system
Operating offshore, especially in deep water, is
hugely expensive. Over the years, however, FMC
Technologies has earned a reputation for offering
simple, straightforward solutions that save time
and money.

The hinged-over subsea template (HOST) system was developed
as a way to standardize subsea components and reduce cost.

FMC Technologies is one of the world’s leading providers of
electro-hydraulic controls, with systems that can operate as many
as 46 functions on a single tree. Now all-electric applications are
extending the range of possibilities for offshore developments.

FMC Technologies operates major manufacturing sites for subsea
systems that serve each producing basin, including this 36,000square-meter (390,000-square-foot) facility at its corporate headquarters in Houston, Texas.

One of the most signiﬁcant innovations was the
hinged-over subsea template (HOST) system. The
challenge was to develop a wellhead template
that could be installed without the use of a bargemounted heavy-lift crane. FMC’s solution was to
build a subsea template that could be installed
directly from a drilling rig.
Developed as part of an alliance with Statoil, Shell,
ExxonMobil and Total, the HOST system employs
a hinged design that allows the template to be run
in a folded-up position, which takes up much less
space on the deck of a ship, barge or drilling vessel.
The HOST is rugged, so it can be used at any depth.
But it is still light and compact enough to lower to
the seabed with a crane no larger than the ones
found on most deepwater rigs. Once the HOST is
positioned on the seabed, it opens like the petals of
a ﬂower to become a steady and secure base for
the wellheads.

Light well intervention uses equipment connected to the surface vessel only by an umbilical
line, instead of through a heavy workover riser,
to perform wireline operations such as logging,
gauging, plugging, reperforating and other downhole operations.
The RLWI equipment to connect to and control the
well can be deployed from a low-cost dynamically
positioned monohull vessel. One of the enabling
technologies is FMC’s patented barrier and lock
system, which locks onto and seals the wellhead
so that a tool package can be inserted and lowered
downhole with the well under full pressure.
“With this fully robotic system, we have reduced
the cost of intervention by more than 60 percent,”
Hansen says. “We believe that it is an important
tool that will increase oil recovery rates in many
subsea developments.”

“With the HOST system and other building blocks
that FMC Technologies has developed, we can
provide custom solutions without the expense of
having to design each new system from scratch,”
says FMC’s Tore Halvorsen.
“The HOST system was a breakthrough in the
building-block system. We were the ﬁrst to come to
market with such a solution. Other companies were
making subsea templates, but they needed crane
ships or barges to launch them.”

Riserless Light Well Intervention
Subsea wells, by deﬁnition, are more difﬁcult to
service than dry trees. That means they are serviced
less often. As a result, they typically achieve lower
production rates over the life of the well. That could
change with an emerging technology called Riserless Light Well Intervention (RLWI).
“The main driver behind RLWI is to make subsea wells easier and cheaper to access than they
are now,” says Harald Hansen, Well Services
business manager for FMC Technologies.

FMC Technologies is currently using Riserless Light Well Intervention in the North Sea on wellheads as deep as 550 meters (1,815
feet). It plans to extend the range to one kilometer (more than a
half mile) by 2007.

Reliability as a Discipline
Complete offshore systems, regardless of the supplier, are typically
assembled from products made
by companies around the world.
Meters, gauges, ﬂowlines, umbilicals, tubulars and many other
components are all bought from
vendors who specialize in those
niche markets.
FMC Technologies has a proven
track record of putting reliable
equipment in the ﬁeld. As the
company that provides the total
package, FMC takes responsibility
for making sure that all the parts
work as designed, regardless of
the source.
“Our clients know that every
component in our system has been
certiﬁed by FMC to make sure that it
meets our performance standards,”
says Brad Beitler, director of Technology and Business Development. “If
there’s a problem, we’re the ones our
clients call to make it right. That’s
why FMC made reliability a discipline
within the company. It’s one reason
that over the past 20 years, simple
and robust subsea systems have become one of the most reliable sets of
equipment in the ﬁeld.”

Subsea Processing – The Next Big Step
Subsea processing
The beneﬁts of subsea processing are obvious. If
you can separate the oil and gas from the produced
water and sand on the seabed, you don’t have the
expense of lifting them to the surface and can
thereby lower the back pressure against the reservoir. Re-injecting the water into a depleted section
of the reservoir can help restore reservoir pressure.
The rewards are lower cost and higher production.
Subsea processing consists of treating produced
ﬂuids upstream of surface facilities at or below
the seabed, including oil/gas/water separation,
multi-phase pumping, gas compression and
ﬂow assurance.
Subsea separation, a technology that is available now, is particularly attractive in maturing ﬁelds, where the water cut is in danger of
exceeding the capacity of the existing ﬂowlines
and process equipment.
For several years, multi-phase pumps have been
available for subsea applications to maintain pressure and prevent slugging in long pipelines. By adding subsea separators, some operators see increased
production rates and increased oil recovery. They
will also be using their existing ﬂowlines and surface equipment more efﬁciently.
Our industry, however, is by nature very conservative. Much of the new hardware that is appearing
today could have been available several years ago,

but widespread acceptance takes time. FMC’s
approach has been to involve its clients in the
design process.
“We involve our customers in the discussions and
in our design thinking to show why we have done
things a certain way,” says Erlend Fjøsna, manager,
Subsea Processing Systems. “Our designs are
simple and robust, so systems should not fail. But
if a primary system does go down, there is always
a backup mode and the possibility of reconﬁguring
the ﬂow so the facility can continue operating.”
FMC Technologies believes that 2005, with the
industry’s ﬁrst order for a full ﬁeld application of
subsea processing, will be remembered as a milestone for the offshore industry.
“In many ways, the interest we are seeing in subsea
processing is moving faster than we thought,”
Fjøsna says. “But that really shouldn’t be a surprise,
because the value cases for subsea processing are
so obvious and so strong.”
With an installed base of more than 1,000 subsea
trees, a global presence for life of ﬁeld services and
long-term relationships with our customers FMC is
in a unique position to grow the FMC subsea processing business. When integrating our knowledge
about subsea and processing with the CDS separation products and skills, we clearly have a competitive advantage in the market” says Tom Munkejord,
Director of Process Systems.

Where We Stand Today
Subsea technology is perhaps the most rapidly
advancing area of the oil industry. Our ability to
produce offshore oil and gas from increasingly
harsh and remote locations depends on it.
“With our ﬁeld development and process system
skills combined with CDS’s product portfolio, we can
offer now is a fully integrated system,” says Rombout
Swanborn, managing director, CDS Separation Technology, a subsidiary of FMC Technologies. “We take a
systems approach to the ﬁeld, building an optimized
process that starts at the subsea wellhead and ends at
the sales meter.”
Full-system integration is a powerful tool. In new
developments, it can lower not only equipment costs
but operating expenses as well over the life of the
ﬁeld. For existing ﬁelds, upgrading to a fully integrated subsea system can optimize the oil and gas
recovery rates, in some cases adding years of production to mature reservoirs.
“The question is not about our ability to supply fully
integrated subsea processing systems, but about
market acceptance,” Swanborn says.

“It typically takes ﬁve to 10 years to introduce
game-changing concepts to our industry, but current
market pressures are shifting the rules. Producers
with maturing ﬁelds are more willing than ever to try
new technology. It’s an exciting time now to be on
the brink of widespread acceptance for a number of
new technologies.”

Challenges of subsea processing
Today, proven technologies are available for subsea
separation and pumping at water depths of 1,000
meters (3,300 feet) with good-quality crude. Existing
technology, however, is being challenged as operators
go after deeper ﬁelds, more remote locations and
heavier oils.
To meet these challenges, FMC and CDS are developing novel heavy-oil separation technologies that
do not depend on large and heavy vessels.
In a related effort, FMC and Siemens are developing a low complexity subsea gas compression
system. FMC is also working with several partners
to qualify subsea power systems that will supply
these new technologies with the high-voltage electricity they need, even at very long distances from
the host facility.

Complete subsea systems make it possible to develop ﬁelds in
areas where ice and heavy seas would threaten surface facilities.

Flow management

Flow metering

“With increased distances and a larger number of
branches in the wells, our ability to use electric controls becomes more important. Electric controls are
necessary to meet our vision of controlling all of the
branches and all of the wells over long distances.”

Accurate metering is important for maintaining the
reservoir performance and assuring the accuracy of
the reservoir model. How much ﬂuid is coming from
each branch of the well? How much is water, and
how much is oil? Which branches may be producing
too much sand? Knowing the answers to these questions can mean the difference in thousands of barrels
of production every day.

“With our separation technology and process systems, we can simulate the ﬂow and the beneﬁts of
ﬂow splitting,” says FMC’s Kjartan Berg, manager,
Subsea Flow Management Systems. “We can separate
water and gas and re-inject water into the reservoir.
We can analyze systems, identify bottlenecks and
determine the payoff if an operator is thinking about
adding more equipment.”

“Maintaining the data quality of what comes from
which branch and which well is a key to good reservoir management,” Berg explains. “The information is
critical for optimizing production day-to-day.”

New ﬂow-assurance center
Assistance in the design stage
Ideally, FMC ﬂow-control engineers should be involved in the design process early on. They have the
tests and experience to determine the proper number
and size of the ﬂowlines and how much insulation
they will need to perform in all types of weather.

FMC installed its ﬁrst ﬂow-assurance control center
in Asker, Norway, in 2005 and will soon add others in
the United States, Brazil and Australia. The plan is to
offer 24-hour monitoring for wells operated by FMC
clients anywhere in the world.

If ﬂowlines are too big, for example, operators
could experience slugging problems that hold back
production and damage processing equipment on
the seabed and at the surface. If the ﬂowlines are too
small, they will become a bottleneck that restricts the
production capacity of the ﬁeld.
Without enough ﬂowlines, operators lose
some of their ability to monitor the ﬂow from
individual wells.
“Subsea systems require more attention to these
details to optimize and ﬁne-tune the ﬂow,” Berg
adds. “While subsea systems can certainly simplify
offshore operations, they do require more attention
to ﬂow assurance and ﬂow optimization.”

Increased Oil Recovery
With conventional tools, subsea operators may
recover from 20 percent to 50 percent of the oil
in place, and up to 70 percent of the gas. Technology has brought us to these levels, but there is still
plenty of room to improve the recovery factors of
existing ﬁelds and future developments.
Advanced subsea trees, electronic controls and better ﬂow-assurance tools, plus innovations like the
HOST system and Riserless Light Well Intervention,
are already having an impact. The next big step is
subsea separation. In that arena, one new product
may change not only our ability to process oil and
gas on the seabed but at the surface as well. The
technology is called inline separation.

components toward the walls of the vessel, and
gas remains closer to the center, where it can be
mechanically separated from the liquid stream.
Water and sand can be separated from the oil in
much the same way. Not only is the small diameter
an advantage in terms of surviving the pressures of
deepwater environments, the design makes them
super efﬁcient.
“The efﬁciency of inline equipment actually drops
when the diameter gets larger, because the larger
radius decreases the centrifugal ﬁeld,” says Guy
Hellinx, CDS sales director. “If you want to have
high efﬁciency, you want to stay relatively small.”

Boosting production economically
Inline separation is an option to consider each time
a new production system is installed or modiﬁed.
Inline separation is so versatile that it could likely
be the system of choice for many new applications. However, there will still be situations where it
would be better or more reliable to have a separator
vessel on the surface. In some cases, a large-capacity surge tank might be needed to handle a sudden
large increase in liquid volume.
FMC Technologies’ inline separation technology provides the
company with a competitive advantage in subsea processing
capabilities for deepwater development.

Inline separators
Inline separators are an ideal solution for subsea
use for several reasons. First, they are small in
diameter. The body of the separator itself is a piece
of pipe with no moving parts. Supporting it are the
same controls, valves and other components that
have already been proven for subsea reliability on
other systems.
The principle behind inline separators is relatively
simple. The ﬂow of produced ﬂuids is set spinning
at high velocities as it passes through the body of
the separator. Centrifugal force pushes the heavier

12

One advantage of inline systems offshore is that they
weigh much less than traditional separator vessels,
which can save money in platform-mounted applications. Inline separators require only 20 percent of
the weight and space required by most conventional
separator systems. On an FPSO, for example, inline
separators could save enough space and weight to
give a smaller class of FPSO the same processing
capacity as the largest FPSOs currently in use.
One of the best applications for inline separators is
to quickly increase the capacity of onshore or offshore processing facilities. Like adding a new piece
of pipe, inline separators can be installed without
taking any of the existing separators and scrubbers
out of service.

Additional inline separators could be added as a
ﬁeld matures to keep up with the increasing volume
of produced water. Space for the new equipment
would not be an issue, since inline separators require only a bit more room than the section of pipe
they replace.

the separator is small in diameter, so inline separators are easy to install, cost effective and versatile
enough to be used in most retroﬁt applications.
They are particularly useful in debottlenecking
projects. If operators need more capacity, they can
simply split the stream for one separator and add a
second or third.

Separation at the seabed
Inline separators are able to efﬁciently isolate
most of the gas, oil, water and sand from produced ﬂuids. The next logical step is to reinject a
slurry of water and sand back into an unused portion of the reservoir, saving the expense of bringing the sand and water to the surface or shore.
Statoil is planning to install a similar sand removal
system in 2007 as part of the Tordis subsea separation project delivered by FMC.

Wider applications
for inline processing

The beneﬁt of lighter, smaller production separators
is obvious offshore, where weight and space are at
a premium. Inline separators are also a good choice
for remote developments onshore, where equipment is often transported thousands of miles to the
ﬁeld. For some new and brownﬁeld developments,
inline separators could be the difference between
doing the project or not.

Production rate

Inline separators were designed for subsea use, but
they are just as efﬁcient on the surface as they are
on the seabed. The pipe that makes up the body of

In some cases, inline separators can boost production. Operators are beginning to see them as
ﬂow-management tools that can reduce pressure in
the ﬂowlines, which creates a greater differential
between pressure in the formation and pressure at
the surface.

Project Proﬁle: Ormen Lange
Ormen Lange is Europe’s deepest subsea development so far. The three-phase project is being deployed in waters ranging from 850 to 1,100 meters
(2,800 to 3,600 feet), about 120 kilometers (75
miles) off the west coast of Norway.

Another challenge for the Ormen Lange developers has been the seabed itself, which is an irregular
and challenging mix of rocks and soft clay. Any low
areas of the gas pipelines create potential traps for
liquids to accumulate and freeze.

Norsk Hydro is the operator through the planning
and development phase, then Shell Norway will
take over as operator when Ormen Lange comes
onstream in October 2007. Shell is also responsible
for drilling the production wells.

FMC Technologies responded by integrating
three ﬂow-assurance systems based on its wellestablished FlowManager™ real-time ﬂow-management software. The company will also provide
continuous monitoring of Ormen Lange’s critical
production variables. FMC qualiﬁed the ﬂowassurance system by conducting both computer
simulations and full-scale cool-down tests of the
equipment at its facilities in Asker, Norway.

Each of Ormen Lange’s three phases includes a
template with eight subsea trees with a working
pressure of 10,000 psi. Produced ﬂuids will be
transferred by twin 30-inch-diameter pipelines to
an onshore processing plant. The processed gas
will then be delivered by pipeline to Europe and
the United Kingdom. Ormen Lange could eventually supply up to 20 percent of the UK’s natural
gas consumption.
“The operators faced a variety of challenges on this
project, but their main concern was ﬂow assurance
in the long pipelines,” says FMC’s Kjartan Berg.
They are dealing with sub-zero temperatures on the
seabed, so hydrates and ice are a constant threat.”

“Over the next few years, formation pressure alone
will be enough to push gas through the pipeline
to shore,” Berg says. “But the plan is to eventually install electric compressors on the seabed to
compensate for the natural decline in reservoir pressure over time. This is a new step-change in subsea
technology, and we are in the process of qualifying
a compressor system now.”

Ormen Lange’s subsea
kit includes three massive subsea templates,
each with eight 10,000psi trees.

Project Proﬁle: Tordis Subsea Processing System
The world’s ﬁrst commercial subsea processing
system will be installed in Statoil’s Tordis ﬁeld in
the third quarter of 2007. Tordis is located in the
Norwegian section of the North Sea in 200 meters
(656 feet) of water. The plan is to install a full-scale
separation facility and electric pumps on the seabed to reinject bulk water into a non-hydrocarbon
reservoir. The oil and gas will be boosted through
a multiphase pump back to the ﬁeld’s Gullfaks C
offshore platform.
“Tordis is a perfect application of subsea separation,” says FMC’s Erlend Fjøsna. “The ﬁeld is maturing, so its wells are producing more and more
water. That is restricting production, because the
ﬂowlines and the surface facilities do not have
the capacity to transport and handle all of the
extra water.”
It’s a common problem in mature offshore ﬁelds.
Operators now have three choices: they can
continue to delay production and reduce ultimate
recovery, they can upgrade their surface facilities
and bring in additional processing equipment,
or they can do some of the processing subsea. In
Statoil’s case, subsea processing clearly made the
most economic sense.
In terms of system reliability, the subsea processing unit for Tordis will be a money-maker from

day one. If it ever does need to be shut down for
maintenance or repairs, the ﬁeld will continue to
produce at a reduced rate until the unit is returned
to service.
Three companies bid on the project, and FMC was
awarded the contract in 2005.
“Our solution was different from the others,”
Fjøsna says. “By taking the gas out in the inlet section of the separator, we were able to reduce the
size of the vessel by almost 50 percent. That made
our vessel more compact than what our competitors proposed.”
The smaller-diameter vessel is less expensive to
build, but the main advantage of FMC’s design is
that the separator will be easy to install and easy
to retrieve if it ever needs repair.
To win the contract, FMC not only came up with
a more-compact design for the separator, but also
performed extensive testing to demonstrate reliability of the system.
“At the beginning of the project, the operator was
very concerned about the separation system’s
ability to remove sand,” says Toine Hendriks, CDS
process engineer. “So we built a full-scale test unit
and demonstrated that our system would work.”

Not If, But When
“FMC’s industry-leading subsea technology is making it possible to produce subsea ﬁelds and achieve recovery factors similar to what operators expect from
topside equipment,” says Erlend Fjøsna, manager, Subsea Processing Systems.
In the case of the Tordis ﬁeld development, production will actually increase
over current levels and allow the operator to recover more of the oil in place.
Elsewhere, subsea production systems will extend the lives of existing
ﬁelds and make marginal developments proﬁtable.
“Subsea separation is the key,” Fjøsna says. “Without subsea processing, Tordis
would have to be shut down and much of the oil left in place. This new separation
technology will increase the recovery from Tordis by 35 million barrels over the
life of the ﬁeld, and we believe that we will see similar results in many ﬁelds over
the coming years. Customers are no longer asking if it will happen, but when.”

Nigeria.
Offshore West Africa is forecast to lead the world in annual spending for operations at $13 billion per year by
2010, according to energy analysts Douglas-Westwood. At the same time, the offshore industry is experiencing
growth constraints because of the increasing demand for equipment and people. The experienced personnel
needed to design, build, and operate drilling and production equipment are difficult to find and command a
growing premium.
These offshore market forces are directing the industry toward new cost-cutting technology and other
commercial innovations to overcome resource constraints. The value of the deepwater technology and
expertise showcased at the Offshore West Africa conference is greater than ever.
Reflecting the increasing West Africa offshore activity, the Offshore West Africa conference has grown
accordingly. OWA 2007 is expected to attract over 1,500 attendees and 100 exhibitors from the energy
centers of Nigeria, Angola, Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, United Kingdom, UAE, United States, France, Italy,
Norway, The Netherlands, Niger, Russia, Australia, and Asia.
The Offshore West Africa technical sessions are presented in two concurrent technical tracks, with each
presentation followed by a question-and-answer period.
Plan today to participate in the highest quality conference and exhibition in West Africa today!

Offshore West Africa Mission Statement
The mission of the Offshore West Africa conference is to provide an annual technical forum in the region dedicated
to the advancement of oil and gas exploration and production activities offshore of Africa. This conference
shall address the technical challenges to safely and cost-effectively develop both shallow-water and deepwater
reserves. It shall also encourage the development of young professionals in the region.

Crews handle 42-in. pipe for a natural gas pipeline being constructed between Groveton and Farrar in East Texas for Energy
Transfer Partners LP.Work on the pipeline included the directionaldrill crossing shown here in Crockett,Tex., August 2007.The
Groveton-to-Farrar section, to be completed in the second quarter
of 2008, is part of 135 miles of looping for ETP’s Cleburneto-Carthage pipeline. Oil & Gas Journal’s special Pipeline Report,
which begins on p. 68, discusses corrosion modeling of such pipelines and the increasing prevalence of joint-ventures in new pipeline
ownership. Photo from Willbros USA Inc. by Lindy King.

Statoil called upon Tenaris to supply TenarisBlue Dopeless premium connections when it came
to develop its Snøhvit field in the environmentally sensitive Barents Sea. The dry, dope-free
connections are being used for all casing and tubing in a full range of materials – including carbon,
chrome and CRA – because the Dopeless technology eliminates discharges, allows fast and clean
make-up and makes for safer working conditions on the rig. Our innovations are opening up a new
world of possibilities and making life easier for our customers, their crews and the environment.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

WEC: TNK-BP calls on Russia to change tax regime to participate in international dialogue about climate change,” he
Russia will have to change its tax regime if it is to attract future
investment from energy companies, a senior figure from TNK-BP
said.
Speaking at the World Energy Congress in Rome, Lord George
Robertson, TNK-BP deputy chairman, said the company has paid
$50 billion in taxes to the Russian government over the last 4 years.
“There are rising levels of taxation and cost, which means that
margins are being squeezed, and so there is less cash to invest,”
Robertson said. “Russia’s tax environment supports prices of under
$25/bbl but when it’s beyond $27/bbl, the Russian government
takes the bigger share.”
Russia is looking for investments in Siberia and offshore in the
arctic, but Robertson said this would be difficult if costs remain
high. TNK-BP, with production of 1.3 million boe/d, is one of Russia’s largest oil and gas producers.
“Diversity of supply will be key to the future so that we can find
flexible ways of solving our problems,” Robertson said.
Forging closer ties with Asia also is a major priority for Russia, said Sergey Boydanchikov, Rosneft chairman and president. The
company plans to more than triple to 18% its supplies to Asia by
2020, but Boydanchikov stressed that Europe would still remain an
important market.
“Europe is our traditional partner and it won’t suffer because of
our policy,” Boydanchikov said. “This will be in the interest of Russia to sell oil and continue to seek profit and higher added value.”

OPEC discusses carbon capture for reducing GHGs
Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
discussed carbon capture and storage (CCS) during a Nov. 17-18
meeting in Riyahd.
Algeria’s Energy Minister Chakib Khelil discussed energy and
the environment as it related to a draft declaration at the Third
OPEC Summit on Nov. 18.
“Carbon storage could reduce the impact of fossil fuels on climate change, and developed countries have the technology on
this,” Khelil said.
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) Executive Director Yvo de Boer addressed OPEC delegates and spoke with reporters during the Riyahd meeting.
“I think the debate here points to a constructive willingness

said. The UNFCCC’s International Panel on Climate Change calls
CCS the most promising technology for rapidly reducing global
greenhouse gas emissions.
A UN climate change conference is scheduled for December in
Bali. UN approval of CCS methodologies could promote CCS technology research and development efforts.
Separately, the European Commission is expected to approve CCS
as an emissions reduction method, beginning in 2013. The third
phase of the cap-and-trade European Trading Scheme (ETS) would
make CCS projects eligible for ETS emissions-reduction credits.

Former executive pleads guilty in bribe plot
A former executive of a Willbros Group Inc. subsidiary pleaded
guilty to conspiring to bribe Nigerian government officials with
more than $6 million to secure a major natural gas pipeline construction contract in that country, the US Department of Justice
announced on Nov. 5.
Jason Edward Steph of Sunset, Tex., pleaded guilty to violating
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. He is cooperating with the government’s investigation and faces a sentence of up to 5 years in
prison and a $250,000 fine. Sentencing was scheduled for Jan. 25,
2008.
Steph worked for Willbros’s overseas subsidiary Willbros International Inc. from 1998 to April 2005 and was general manager
of its onshore operations in Nigeria from 2000 until April 2005,
DOJ said.
As part of his guilty plea, he admitted that in late 2003 he, a
senior executive in charge of Willbros Group’s international business, two purported consultants working for Willbros International, and certain Nigerian-based employees of a German engineering
and construction company agreed to pay the millions in bribes. The
money was to go to officials of Nigerian National Oil Corp. and
its Nigerian Petroleum Investment Services subsidiary, a Nigerian
political party, and a senior official in the Nigerian government’s
executive branch.
Steph also admitted that he, former Willbros International executive Jim Bob Brown, and others arranged to pay about $1.8
million in cash to government officials in Nigeria to further the
scheme. Brown pleaded guilty to a similar charge on Sept. 14,
2006, DOJ said. ✦

Khelil told OGJ that the government had introduced these terms
because it needs technology and assistance to develop the blocks.
“Algeria and Sonatrach have money; we don’t need that.
Sonatrach has the know-how. We want Sonatrach to become an
important player in the international arena,” he said.
He denied accusations of resource nationalism, a major subject
discussed during the World Energy Congress in Rome, saying that
the phenomenon was not particular to Algeria.
Sonatrach will not seek other international partners to help it
with Gassi Touil integrated production and LNG export project in
the Berkine basin in the Sahara Desert after terminating the agreement with Gas Natural and Repsol (OGJ, Sept. 20, 2007, Newsletter).
“It poses too many problems to find other partners and start
from scratch, so we have decided to do it alone,” Khelil said. Production will start in 2012, 3 years later than originally planned.
Khelil said Sonatrach ended the agreement because of delays
and rising costs. The former partners are now in arbitration. “This
is a commercial issue, not one of resource nationalism. Even the
Spanish foreign minister has said that.”
He defended Algeria’s decision to impose tax on exceptional
profits as one of “logic,” saying, “When oil was $15/bbl in the
‘80’s and the contracts were signed, there was no mechanism to
have oil prices go that high. The state of Algeria said it would take
a fair share, but a similar thing is happening in Alberta, the US, and
the UK.”

Production flows from a 15-slot production, drilling, and quarters platform in 105 m of water through a 26-in. gas pipeline and
12-in. condensate pipeline to processing facilities in the Sangachal
Terminal onshore. After processing, the gas enters the South Caucasus Pipeline between Azaerbaijan and Turkey, which was laid as part
of the Shah Deniz development.
At midyear, Shah Deniz was producing more than 14.2 million
cu m/day of gas and 30,000 b/d of condensate.
Partners in the Shah Deniz production sharing agreement are
BP, operator, and StatoilHydro, 25.5% interest each; State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic, Lukoil, NICO, and Total, 10% each;
and TPAO, 9%.

Total ﬁnds more oil off Congo (Brazzaville)

Total E&P Congo has found six oil reservoir levels in its ultradeepwater Persee Nord Est Marine-1 discovery well. The well,
which targeted Miocene rock, was drilled on Mer Tres Profonde
Sud (MTPS) block off Congo (Brazzaville).
The well, which reached 4,110 m TD, is 185 km offshore in
2,120 m of water.
Total will now start on field development studies to bring together its other previous oil discoveries after assessing the resources.
“Following Andromede in 2000, Pegase Nord in 2004, Aurige
Nord in 2006, and Cassiopee Est in 2007, this new drilling success
is the fifth oil discovery in the MTPS permit,” Total said.

Production

Cantarell and Ku Maloob Zaap production falling
Production of crude oil in Mexico’s main oilfields—Cantarell
and Ku Maloob Zaap, in the Gulf of Mexico Campeche Sound—is
falling due to water and salt seepage into the reservoirs, official
documents reveal.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

According to documents of state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos,
the seepage is causing a reduction in production equivalent to
84,300 b/d of oil. Pemex said the loss of production due to water
and salt dates back to 2004, and is a natural result of the maturing
of these fields.

“As in all deposits, the problem of water production in mature
fields is not something that can be reversed, but rather it is a situation that must be managed to continue producing crude oil, now
with a percentage of water,” Pemex said.
In September, Pemex produced an average of 1.5 million b/d
of oil from Cantarell, 15% less than in September 2006, the Pemex documents revealed. As recently as November 2006, output
of 415,000 b/d at Ku Maloob Zaap field in the Gulf of Mexico had
been expected to climb to 800,000 b/d by 2010, partly offsetting
Cantarell’s decline (OGJ, Nov. 6, 2006, p. 33).

BP starts up gas ﬁeld off Trinidad and Tobago
BP Trinidad & Tobago (BPTT) on Nov. 17 began natural gas production from its wholly owned and operated Mango field on Galeota block about 35 miles southeast of Galeota Point in 235 ft of
water off Trinidad and Tobago.
The field is expected to add an incremental 750 MMscfd of gas

Processing
Chevron signs agreement for Piceance production
Chevron USA Inc. has entered into a long-term agreement with
Enterprise Gas Processing LLC for the gathering and treatment of
natural gas produced from Chevron’s Piceance basin operations in
western Colorado.
Under the agreement, Enterprise will process all gas produced
by Chevron from its Piceance program at its 750 MMcfd Meeker,
Colo., gas processing facility, which lies 26 miles north of Chevron’s development. Gas production will be transported through
Enterprise’s 48-mile, 36-in. Piceance Creek gathering system to the
Meeker facility, which was placed into service in October.
The Meeker facility also has the capability to extract as much
as 35,000 b/d of natural gas liquids. Phase II, which will double
capacity of the facility to 1.5 bcfd of gas and 70,000 b/d of NGLs,
is projected to begin operations in the summer of 2008.
Initial volumes from Chevron’s Piceance production are slated
to be 50 MMcfd starting in 2008.
Under the terms of a separate transportation and fractionation
exchange agreement, Enterprise will transport Chevron’s mixed
NGLs extracted at Meeker through its Mid-America Pipeline
(MAPL). In the third quarter, Enterprise completed an expansion
of MAPL, adding 50,000 b/d of incremental capacity.
Chevron began its Piceance basin drilling program with a
13-well delineation program in 2005 on 33,000 acres that it owns
on Colorado’s western slope. Two purpose-built rigs began drilling the first development wells this summer, using extended-reach
directional drilling techniques that will allow Chevron to complete
up to 22 wells from a single pad. The entire development program
may involve more than 2,000 wells and could last from 10 to 15
years, with production operations continuing for several decades.
Enterprise has already executed agreements totaling more than
2 bcfd of gas with six of the 12 largest producers in the region.

deliverability plus some associated condensate.
Mango field, discovered in 1971 and further appraised in 2000,
has been developed using a single unmanned platform with a capacity to produce from nine wells. Gas is transported through a
4-mile, 26-in. subsea pipeline tied into the current Cannonball
pipeline and the Cassia B gas processing hub. Gas from Mango will
supply Atlantic LNG’s liquefaction plant and the LNG will be used
locally and will be exported to international markets.
The Mango platform was the second to be built to the same
standardized design as the Cannonball platform, which is the first
offshore platform to be designed in Trinidad. Cannonball was installed in 2005. The 860 tonne Mango jacket and the 890 tonne
topsides were built at the Trinidad Offshore Fabricators yard in La
Brea, Trinidad. Trinidad Offshore is a joint venture of Chet Morrison Contractors and Trinidad’s Weldfab. Mango platform was installed in February. It was built simultaneously with the Cashima
platform, which also followed the Cannonball template. ✦

Abidjan.
The facility is being funded by US energy firms Energy Allied
International and WCW International, together with Ivory Coast’s
state-owned Petroci.
“The implementation of this new refinery is a much anticipated
next step in our vision to make Abidjan and [Ivory Coast] a major center for refining and redistribution of high-end petroleum
products along the West African Atlantic Basin,” said Petroci general
manager Kassoum Fadika.
Fadika said Angolan, Nigerian, and possibly Congolese crude
will be treated in the refinery, which will target US markets.
State-owned refining firm Societe Ivoirienne de Raffinage manages Ivory Coast’s other refinery, which is in the same industrial
area of Vridi, and it can process 70,000 b/d.
The SIR facility is 47.21% owned by the Ivorian government,
while Burkina Faso owns another 5.39%. Four international oil
companies—Total SA 25.3%, Royal Dutch Shell PLC 10.3%, ExxonMobil Corp. 8.1%, and Chevron Corp. 3.7%—own the remainder.

French producers asked to lessen oil price impact

France’s Finance and Economy Minister Christine Lagarde urged
all producers and distributors of fuel in that country to reduce the
impact of high oil prices on consumers.
Oil majors Total SA, Royal Dutch Shell PLC, BP PLC, ExxonMobil
Corp.’s Esso subsidiary, and Eni SPA unit Agip, as well as smaller
distributors, all promised at the Nov. 10 meeting to continue the
policy, started in 2005, of “smoothing out” price hikes and passing
on price drops to consumers as quickly as possible. In this way, said
Total Chief Executive Officer Christopher de Margerie, “No company can outrageously take advantage of market movements.”
Lagarde acknowledged that, as a result of that policy, pump
prices in France are lower than average fuel prices in the European

of motor fuel sales. She said she would encourage the opening of
more super and hyper markets. The majors have developed different strategies to remain competitive in that market.
At that meeting, representatives of the major oil companies confirmed their commitments to invest 3.5 billion euros in 2006-10 to
increase and upgrade refining capacities. Total’s share of that investment is 3 billion euros. In addition, Total will invest another 500 million euros in the same period to develop in new energy technologies.

Lagarde said she strongly backs the International Energy Agency’s plea for oil and gas producing countries to increase production. She said the matter would be taken up at the Euro group and
European financial ministers meeting this week in Brussels, as well
as at the Nov. 17 meeting in South Africa of the “Group of 20”—a
bloc of developing nations established Aug. 20, 2003.
Lagarde advocated more transparency of oil inventory levels,
which should be published weekly, “as in the US.” ✦

Saudi gas pipeline ﬁre kills at least 28
At least 28 people were killed and another 10 injured on Nov.
18 when a fire broke out after an explosion along the Haradh’Uthmaniyah natural gas pipeline in Saudi Arabia’s Eastern province.
The explosion and blaze occurred when workers were welding
a plate on the pipeline, one source said, adding that the gas plant
was unaffected. “This is purely maintenance-related,” said an adviser to the Saudi oil ministry.
The fire broke out in the early morning hours about 30 km
from the Hawiyah gas plant, where maintenance work for new tieins was being conducted, Saudi Aramco said in a statement.
“Emergency response teams were immediately mobilized; affected lines have been isolated and the fire has been brought under
control,” Aramco said.
Saudi Oil Minister Ali Al-Naimi said the fire would have no impact on the company’s production capacity since it was a new pipeline, while a Saudi adviser to Saudi Arabia’s oil ministry said there
was no question the fire was an accident. A technical committee
will investigate its causes.

On Nov. 13 Zubkov said, “Measures are being taken today, and
we think the large volume of oil will be removed from the shoreline.” But Alexey Zimenko, an environmentalist with Russian Program Office World Wide Fund for Nature said the region’s ecological system will not recover soon from the consequences of the
tanker’s sinking.
“The consequences [to the Krasnodar territory region] will persist for many years,” Zimenko told Interfax news agency.
“The environmental system of the region has sustained serious
damage,” Zimenko said. “It is insufficient to collect the oil on the
water’s surface and on the shoreline. A considerable part of the
black oil will sink to settle on the bottom, and it will participate
in the environmental cycle.” Russian federal weather forecasting
service Rosgidromet warned Nov. 13 that oil products from the
sunken tanker could spread beyond Kerch Strait to the Sea of Azov.
“In the current stormy situation the greatest danger lies in intensive pollution of the coastline in the shipwreck zone, including
on Ukrainian territory with oil products,” Rosgidromet said.

Greece-Turkey gas pipeline link inaugurated
Oil output begins from Oyong oil ﬁeld off Java
Santos-operated Oyong oil field off East Java has shipped its first
cargo of oil from the field’s Shanghai floating production, storage,
and offloading (FPSO) vessel.
The company said 250,000 bbl were loaded into the Emerald
Queen export tanker the week of Nov. 12. Production is expected
to stabilize at 8,000-10,000 b/d.
Field commissioning is virtually complete, Santos said, with gas
injection operational and all production wells on line.
Oil is produced via a wellhead platform from oil wells and two
gas wells. It is processed on the Sea Good 101 production barge
and piped to the FPSO for storage and offloading.
Participants in the Sampang production-sharing contract are
Santos, Adelaide, with 45%, Singapore Petroleum 40%, and Cue
Energy Resources, Melbourne, 15%.

Controversy looms over Kerch Strait fuel oil cleanup
Russian officials and environmental experts are in disagreement
over the short and long-term effects of 1,300 tonnes of heavy fuel
oil spilled by the sunken tanker Volgoneft-139 in Kerch Strait (OGJ
Online, Nov. 12, 2007).
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov said the majority of fuel
oil will be removed from the shoreline within 3 weeks, while work
to put things back in order in the aftermath of the disaster will be
completed “within 40-45 days.”

Greece and Turkey Nov. 18 took a major step in linking Caspian
Sea producers with west European consumers as Greek Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip
Erdogan inaugurated a 178-mile pipeline link that will transport
natural gas from Shah Deniz field off Azerbaijan.
The new line initially will carry 250 million cu m/year of gas
from Karacabey, in western Turkey, to Komotini, in northeastern
Greece. The line’s capacity is expected to triple by 2012, when Poseidon, a 132-mile undersea pipeline between Italy and Greece begins operation (OGJ, Aug. 13, 2007, Newsletter).
US Energy Sec. Samuel Bodman, on hand for the inauguration
ceremonies, welcomed the new line as an “extraordinary project”
and a “critical new energy bridge” between the East and West.
“This Turkey-Greece Inter-Connector is a critical first step in a
new energy supply chain, and it comes on line at a critically important time,” Bodman said, adding that the European Union is
the world’s biggest gas import market and one of the world’s fastest-growing. “It is reasonable to expect that Europe’s dependence
on energy imports will continue to grow over the next 25 years,
meaning that Azerbaijan and the rest of Central Asia is poised to become Europe’s newest main source of supply, alongside the North
Sea region, Russia, and North Africa,” Bodman said.
Azerbaijan’s President Ilkham Aliyev, also at the ceremonies, said
his country is ready to implement projects aimed at expanding
energy cooperation with the European Union. ✦

Markets under assault
Governmental activism has roared back into
fashion in the energy-consuming world. In the US,
a Republican president and Democratic Congress
spar over energy policies that differ on specifics
but converge around the assumption that energy
choice is a fitting purpose of government. In Europe, progress toward energy-market deregulation
is giving way to supposedly weightier concerns.
Indeed, the main movement toward market
economics now is by countries trimming price
subsidies, and those steps relate less to enlightenment than to fiscal pressure.
The reinvigoration of energy governance in major consuming nations has many possible explanations. Some observers see the oil price surge of the
past few years as a market failure and summons to
govern. To some, the excesses of Enron and rogue
traders elsewhere discredited the deregulation of
electricity markets if not trading more broadly and
the legitimacy of free markets in general.

Transcendent problems
A belief also seems to be at work that transcendent problems have emerged, problems massive
and complex enough to overwhelm whatever
remediation might be expected from the simple
working of free markets, problems only governments can address. Energy insecurity and climate
change are popular favorites.
To some degree, too, activism by consumingnation governments responds to menacing initiatives of producer governments empowered by
surging oil revenue. Oil money, for example, has
rekindled Russian hegemony. It has given mavericks such as Venezuela’s Hugo Chavez and Iran’s
Mahmoud Amadinejad international maneuverability they wouldn’t otherwise possess.
But these are excuses, not good reasons, for
governments to yield to their natural urges to
govern with abandon. They dodge the question
whether consumers fare better in markets working freely or in markets misshapen by intrusions
such as fuel-use mandates, consumption limits,
and price controls. Yet history answers clearly: For
consumers, free markets always are preferable.
They’re preferable even when prices are stressfully
high because they keep supply flowing to priority
uses. Inevitably, consumption mandates raise costs,
and price controls create shortage.
US and European energy markets strained

under regulation in the 1970s then flourished,
to the extended benefit of consumers, after price
and consumption controls eased in the 1980s.
Elevated prices of the moment in no way repudiate
the comfort that followed deregulation where it
occurred. In fact, years of depressed energy prices
contributed to unprecedented economic growth
in much of the world, growth that has blunted the
sting of an inevitable price upswing. Nothing—
not elevated prices, not tension over energy security, and not climate change—warrants distortions
like those of the ’70s.
As governments lunge toward past errors, oil and
gas companies can serve national interests by proclaiming whenever possible the superiority of market
freedom over regulated energy systems. And they
should anticipate three standard counterarguments.
Appeals for market freedom reflect blind
ideology, goes one typical complaint. In some
cases, this may be true. Yet a preference for market
freedom can flow from simple pragmatism born
of experience with what works and what doesn’t.
Markets act swiftly and efficiently; governments
can’t. Therefore, matters such as fuel choice and
pricing are best left to markets. Besides, what’s
wrong with ideology?

Supporting regulation
Supporters of markets vis-a-vis governments
also face accusations that they thoughtlessly abhor
governance. This claim is extreme and unfair. To
support market freedom is not automatically to
oppose government as an institution or regulation
as a practice. In fact, most free-market advocates
support regulation to limit trading misbehavior,
for example, and to guide whatever responses
to climate change may be in order. In all issues,
though, governments should restrain themselves
and orient their actions to market freedom. The
point of such a framework is to make governance
effective, not to disparage governance itself.
The other standard argument against a preference
for market solutions is the supposition that problems
can be too big for markets to handle.Yet energy-market distortions create problems bigger than those that
the policy mistakes causing them aim to solve. Price
and market controls leap to mind.
Energy markets aren’t yet in retreat in the consuming world. But they’re under assault. Energy
consumers have reason to worry. ✦

The rapid increase in ethanol consumption during 2002-06 will prove
to have been a one-time event that
captured two thirds of the ultimate
near-term market.
Growth beyond the remaining third
of ethanol’s potential will depend on
ethanol’s ability to replace gasoline as a
primary fuel.
Gasoline replacement by ethanol is
constrained by two factors: The
gasoline-ethanol distribution
infrastructure does not deliver
ethanol for gasoline blending
everywhere in the country, and
there are physical limitations on
existing vehicles—all 240 million of them—as to how much
ethanol they can use in combination
with gasoline.

invented. Used intermittently as an octane booster over the years, it received
renewed interest with the Energy Tax
Act of 1978, which offered a 4¢/gal
blending credit for “gasohol.” That
worked out to 40¢/gal of neat ethanol.
The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
streamlined the credit and expanded
it to 51¢/gal for ethanol blended with
gasoline.
The Energy Policy Act of 2005
(EPACT) mandates more use of ethanol,
4 billion gal in 2006 and 7.5 billion gal
in 2012 and years thereafter. Current
consumption, because of this boom in
ethanol use in the last year, exceeds 6
billion gal/year.
Between 2002 and 2006, ethanol
consumption increased by a factor of
2.5, from 2.1 billion gal to 5.4 billion gal. While this gives the illusion
of boundless consumption of ethanol
in the future, it would be a mistake to
translate that growth rate ad infinitum.
The reason ethanol became such a hot
item in 2006 was that the additive
methyl tertiary butyl ether was removed from the gasoline pool because
of public displeasure with leaks of the
substance into water supplies and the
related threat of defective-product litigation against refiners.
The MTBE phase-out had been under
way since 2000, when public opposition to it began to grow. Consumption,
which had peaked at about 300,000
b/d, ceased last year. About 400,000
b/d of ethanol poured into the market
to replace MTBE as an oxygenate, octane
booster, and supply extender.
Fig. 1 shows the ramp-down of
MTBE and the ramp-up of ethanol sales.
Fig. 2 shows pricing phenomena that
led to almost a tulip-mania style bubble
for ethanol. The ethanol price peaked in
the middle of summer 2006 at almost
$4.50/gal, in contrast to wholesale
gasoline, which also jumped last year
but only to $2.25/bbl.
Ethanol’s price surge certainly
spurred interest in producing ethanol,
which was hugely profitable. As domestic ethanol production ramped up with
the opening of more and more ethanol

plants, prices of ethanol and gasoline
began to converge. In recent months
ethanol became cheaper than gasoline
as the supply increased.
US ethanol plant capacity grew, with
131 operating plants capable of meeting
all US needs right now: The capacity is
7 billion gal/year or 460,000 b/d. The
72 plants now under construction will
raise capacity to about 880,000 b/d,
almost 10% of US gasoline consumption and well above the EPACT 2012
mandate.
Rising demand for ethanol has of
course increased demand for corn, the
price of which last year doubled (Fig.
3). Now ethanol producers are buying
more corn and driving corn prices up
as they increase output and push ethanol prices down. An ethanol oversupply has developed while corn demand
remains high.
This year US corn plantings reached
their highest level since 1944. Corn
acreage has increased 15% at the
expense of other crops, notably cotton (acreage down 20%) and soybeans
(acreage down 11%). Cotton and soybean prices will be higher because of
smaller plantings. Those increases will
occur with corn prices already high and
likely to go higher by 2008.

Not new oil
Ethanol is not the new oil; it is new
but something different. Or maybe it is
the same old thing but a new fashion
statement.
Ethanol’s energy content is only
two-thirds that of the same amount
of gasoline. Volumes of ethanol don’t
hold comparable energy values, either.
Wholesale prices of ethanol currently
are $1.80/gal, which translates to about
$2.70/gal for wholesale gasoline—before tax, dealer mark-up, and transportation cost.
Ethanol raises widely recognized
physical issues. Because it tends to
separate from gasoline in the presence
of water, gasoline-ethanol blends can’t
be shipped by pipeline. So ethanol is
transported mostly by rail at up to four
times the cost of oil products moved by

pipeline. Because the blend has a short
shelf life, ethanol and gasoline must be
mixed near the point of retail sale.
Distribution limits keep ethanol
blends out of some US markets. As a
result, the average ethanol content of all
US gasoline is below 5%, less than half
the concentration that all automobiles
can use.
While there has been talk about
flexible-fuel vehicles able to use fuels
containing 85% ethanol (E85), only 6
million of the 237 million vehicles now
on the road are FFVs—and most don’t
burn E85. Only 1,200 retail establishments sell the fuel.

President George W. Bush has elicited
a pledge from the Big Three automakers
that half their 2012 output will be FFVs.
Foreign automakers have not shown
much interest in doing the same; they
have other ways of achieving high mileage per gallon.
In 2017, when the president wants
gasoline use to have been cut by 20%,
there will be 280 million vehicles on the
road in the US, not many of which will
be FFVs. Even if Detroit meets its pledge
to Bush, only 25% of the new vehicles
sold in any given year will be FFVs.

Easy amount blended
What does all this mean? There is
an easy amount of ethanol that can be
absorbed in the gasoline pool (Table 1).
That is about 5%, and that is where the
market is now: about 8 billion gal/year,
or 500,000 b/d.
At that level, ethanol is a necessary
and complementary component of the
gasoline pool. It is the current situation.
It represents the replacement of MTBE
in an economic environment that accommodates ethanol prices higher than
gasoline prices.
But a lot of production capability is
under construction and soon will be
available. The additional ethanol will be
hard to absorb into the gasoline pool,
given the 10% effective cap and the lack
of distribution facilities.
Certainly increasing volumes can
be supplied, and gasoline performance
can be enhanced, but at the same time,
with all this capacity coming on line,
ethanol prices will converge on gasoline
prices on a btu-adjusted basis. If the
market is oversupplied, adjusted ethanol
prices will be lower than gasoline. The
10% theoretical maximum that can
be used in current vehicles would be
hard to achieve because of the distribution conflicts. With ethanol production
capacity soon to about double, reaching
15 billion gal/year, the potential for
an ethanol price slump is high, and it
20

would result in stranded ethanol plant
investment and pressure by ethanol
producers for new subsidies.
For years beyond 2012, there are
proposals for ethanol sales mandates
that assume concentrations in gasoline
above the current 10% cap. How that
might be achieved is an unanswered
question, given that only US automakers espouse the plan, and they account
for only about half of US vehicle sales.
Proposals for sharply increased
ethanol sales simply assume that auto
manufacturers will warranty existing
cars for fuel blends containing far more
than the current 10% maximum.

price pressures in the economy.
Assuming away vehicle compatibility
issues, even if cellulosic sources become
commercially viable on the most optimistic schedule, consumption of ethanol still won’t exceed 10% of gasoline
supply without substantial changes in
the stock of capital: pipeline transport
and terminal facilities; retail facilities
able to dispense E85; universal distribution across the country; and a change
in the automobile stock to facilitate the
use of higher concentrations of ethanol
in gasoline.
Investors have been quick to back
ethanol production, but infrastructure
has attracted little interest. Financing
such infrastructure as pipelines is challenging. There are special vehicles for
raising capital in the pipeline and midstream segments of the industry—the
master limited partnership is one—but
raising capital for projects requires
special efforts.

Reﬁning vs. ethanol

Investment in refining has lagged at
the same time that ethanol plant investment has been robust. Refining capacity
grew by only 600,000 b/d in the past
few years, while imports of oil products
grew by 1 million b/d. A new energysecurity issue is emerging: The US depends not only on other nations’ crude
oil but increasingly on other countries’
refining capacity.

ASPO: Depletion, technology affect peak oil
Angel White
Associate Editor
The peak oil issue is essentially a race
between resource depletion and the
continuing development of technology,
according to industry and academic
experts at the third annual conference
by the Association for the Study of Peak
Oil (ASPO) in Houston Oct. 17-20.
Peak oil production when world
supplies of crude can’t meet global
demand is “real and imminent [and]
will occur sooner than most people
expect,” said Chris Skrebowski, editor
of Petroleum Review. He cited falling
discovery rates, fewer large discoveries,
rapid depletion, companies’ struggles to
maintain production levels, and too few
countries with real growth potential for
output.
Skrebowski said these factors are
combined with nongeological threats to
supply flows, including “resource nationalism” in Russia, Venezuela, Bolivia,
and Ecuador; tighter terms and conditions for production-sharing agreements; civil insurrection; cost inflation;
ageing equipment and facilities; lack of
skilled workers; and refinery constraints.
He said net depletion of 4%, or 3.3
million b/d, is now double annual demand growth. Depletion is accelerating
22

at a rate of 0.1-0.15%/year, so “to avoid
economic disaster, we need to shed lots
of oil demand,” said Skrebowski.
Compounding the issue even more,
the rules of economics are not working,
Skrebowski said. Governments of most
oil-producing states outside the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development subsidize fuel prices for
their citizens while some governments
of OECD countries tax fuels heavily. As
a result, pump prices around the globe
range from 20¢/gal to $9/gal.
Other conference speakers agreed
that the economics are malfunctioning.
Matthew Simmons, chairman of
Simmons & Co. International, Houston,
said, “There is no sign that high prices
have had any impacts on demand.”
Robert L. Hirsch, senior energy
advisor of Management Information
Services Inc. (MISI) and coauthor of a
peak oil report to the US Department
of Energy, said, “The problem is [the
price] shocks, where [changes] occur
rapidly. Markets cannot react that fast.”
Skrebowski said crude supplies
may be mitigated by limited discoveries, infill and other small production
projects, trimming the depletion rate,

Reserves growth
Jeremy Gilbert, managing director of

ASPO forecasts 130 billion bbl and the
US Geological Survey forecasts as much
as 724 billion bbl.
Gilbert contends, however, that

medium-term supply, even if found

years from discovery to production.
In addition, he said, there is no agreement on how much reserves growth is
to be achieved. “Reserves don’t always
grow,” Gilbert said. Some are sustained
and some are depleted. Thus, he said,
most forecasts for reserves growth are
overestimated.
He estimates potential reserves

warns will “not all come at once” and
“will not affect the peak.” He said reserves growth occurs in existing fields,

GLOBAL TUBULAR SOLUTIONS

PIPES FOR THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR

OAO TMK, Russia's largest manufacturer of tubular goods, offers a
wide range of pipes to the oil and gas sector used for the construction
and the operation of oil and gas wells and for the transportation of
hydrocarbons, including line pipes, tubing, drill pipes, and casing.
Pipes are produced from in-house manufactured steel, treated in a ladle
furnace, argon degassed, and vacuum processed before continuous
casting.

A special tracking system ensures that all drill pipes, casing, tubing, and
line pipes conform to standards of quality and required characteristics
throughout the production process.
TMK pipes are certified according to GOST R, API, RWTUV, and
PIN-DVGW standards. All TMK plants apply the ISO 9001:2000 Quality
Management System.

and typically recovery by new technology is taken into account in the initial
reserves estimate.
Gilbert said most growth occurs
because operators were overcautious in
their initial estimates of reserves, especially in the US where the US Securities
and Exchange Commission’s reserves
reporting rules are followed. He said
SEC rules for reserves growth are used
by the major integrated companies but
not by OPEC members. Therefore, it is
used for about 23% or less of world
production, he said, adding that the
resources that don’t fall under SEC rules
will not follow US reserves growth patterns.
Gilbert said reserves growth “will
help fill the gap” but cautioned that
“the pace [of reserves growth] in the
past [is] not a guide to pace in the
future.”
If oil peaks in 10-15 years, he said,
“It’s probably already too late for
smooth transition to add alternative energy.” He said problems for consumers
will begin before peak is reached.

2005-15 and the delayed, who see the
oil peak occuring around 2020-40,
with a plateau of 15-30 years.
Nehring emphasized that although
the dates between the delayed and imminent views may seem like a small
difference, “it represents the difference
between catastrophe and a difficult but
manageable transition.”
Variations in the estimate of ultimate
world production put the occurrence of
peak oil around 2007-16.
Different views of remaining world
oil reserves is the essential difference
between imminent peakists and delayed
peakists, said Nehring.
He said, “Recovery growth is central
to the delayed peakist, and it is immaterial to the imminent peakist.”

Technology vs. depletion

Simmons questioned whether the
world can cope with even a 4.5%/
year depletion decline, as estimated by
Cambridge Energy Research Associates. He said CERA’s estimate requires
adding 60 million b/d of production
in 10 years.

if wellhead output can grow, infrastructure soon will shrink due to the
immediate need to rebuild oil and gas
facilities.
He also questioned the likelihood
of planned Saudi Arabia projects to
come on line, and noted that recent big
discoveries, specifically Chevron Corp.’s
Jack field in the Gulf of Mexico, cannot
find rigs to complete further tests.
Gilbert said, “New technology will
continue to add to recovery but will
achieve less.”

Transportation
Oil demand is not likely to slow or
decline. One reason is its fundamental
growth engine (transportation), which
is unstoppable, said Simmons.
With a global population of 6.5 billion and a vehicle production rate of 50
million vehicles/year, it is hard to stop
transportation growth, he said.
Skrebowski pointed out that
76.5-83% of the oil barrel is used for
transportation. He said jet fuel and ship
bunkers are difficult to substitute, but
even then surface transport fuel still accounts for 50% of the barrel.
Hirsh contends that the situation is
“a liquid fuels problem, not an energy
problem.” He said, “Windmills are not
going to run our cars.”
Roger Bezdez, president of MISI, says
jet fuel costs have tripled in the past 4
years. Aviation fuel costs are forecast to
grow to nearly half of US domestic oil
production in 2030, he said.
Hirsh posed a question to the conference attendees: At what price would
you stop using your vehicle? His implication is that attendees would attempt
to perpetuate their way of life for as
long as possible.

happen rapidly.” He noted that it took
25 years for electricity to be widely
used.
Justin Ward, engineer with Toyota’s
Advanced Technology Vehicles Department, said it took 27 years for gas-powered vehicles to become mainstream in
global markets. And it has taken 9 years
for the Prius, Toyota’s hybrid car, to get
to 100 million sold.
In order to elicit change in consumer
behavior, Tertzakian said “There must
be a compelling alternative at a cheaper
price.”
Complicating the peak oil issue is the
fact that hydrocarbons are compelling
and cheap. “Only when alternatives are
as compelling will consumers be compelled to buy,” he said.
In addition, he proposed that the
peak oil challenge is not a technological engineering issue, but a social
engineering issue, involving traffic
congestion, urban sprawl, and “vehicle
obesity,” e.g., the Hummer H6.

characteristics of regulated markets. “Of

development by the Inter-Continental

CFTC further said that while many

A deepwater
royalty storm

M

any members of Congress
already were upset over the absence of price thresholds from federal
deepwater leases issued in 1998 and
1999 under which royalties were not
paid. Then a federal district court in
Louisiana triggered a fresh political
storm.
The court ruled in the Kerr-McGee
Corp. lawsuit challenging deepwater
royalties on Oct. 30 that passage of
the Outer Continental Shelf Deepwater Royalty Relief Act in 1995
eliminated the US Department of the
Interior’s discretion to enact a price
threshold requirement that applies to
volumes below the minimum volume
of royalty-free production.
Officials from the administration
of President George W. Bush immediately disagreed. “If the court’s
interpretation of Congress’s action in
1995 is correct, certain leaseholders
will be allowed to produce massive
amounts...without paying royalties to
the United States without regard to
the price...perhaps amounting to one
of the biggest congressional giveaways of federal resources in modern
history,” DOI Communications Director Tina Kreisher said.

be lost if the ruling stands.
US House members also didn’t
like the court’s action. Natural Resources Committee Chairman Nick
J. Rahall (D-W.Va.) said in a Nov. 6
letter to Bush that the ruling could
result in “an unconscionable giveaway to the oil and gas companies on
behalf of the American taxpayer.”
He urged the administration to
appeal and for Bush to withdraw
his veto threat over the language
in House energy bills. “With last
week’s court decision, and oil prices
now exceeding $90/bbl, I hope you
will reconsider this stance, and urge
swift passage of an energy bill containing these necessary provisions,”
he wrote.

Cites CRS study

Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.),
who chairs the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and
Global Warming and is a Natural
Resources Committee member, said
on Nov. 9 that a new Congressional

“Generally, most witnesses believed
that some changes to the ECM provisions may be appropriate, as long as
they are prudently targeted and do not
adversely affect the ability of established
ECMs to innovate and grow,” the report
said.
CFTC considers the current level of
regulation appropriate when an ECM
trading contract’s volume remains
low and its prices are not relied upon
to a great degree by other markets.
But when such a contract matures
and begins to serve a price discovery
function for commodity transactions
in interstate commerce, it warrants
some increased oversight to deter and
prevent price manipulation or other
market integrity disruptions, the report continued.
The commission report said a
determination that a contract serves
a price discovery function should be
based on its having a trading volume
high enough to affect regulated markets or become a trading benchmark
and either influence other markets
and contracts through a linkage or be
materially referenced by others in interstate commerce “on a frequent and
recurring basis.”
ICE Chairman Jeffrey C. Sprecher applauded the CFTC report. “The spirit of
the recommendations is largely consistent with the views we have expressed
in several testimonies this year. Such a
solution recognizes and addresses the
complexities of [over-the-counter]
markets and preserves the significant
economic and utility benefits of a properly functioning market,” he said in an
Oct. 24 statement.
ICE adopted daily position reporting
in its primary OTC markets a year ago,
Sprecher said. “The concept of position
accountability and ‘self-regulatory-like’
authority would provide ICE with the
ability to take action in its markets if
necessary. We will continue to engage in
a dialogue with regulators, the industry, and Congress and look forward to
effectively resolving this long-standing
matter,” he said. ✦

last week, but ahead of his arrival Le
Monde newspaper issued an editorial
that could not have been mistaken for
the red carpet treatment.
To be sure, Le Monde did welcome
Chavez in his role as an intermediary
in resolving a hostage crisis between
the Colombian government and a
force of guerrillas in the country.
It said the Venezuelan president’s
involvement is welcome because
“hitherto nobody and no group of
countries has succeeded in negotiating with the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia (FARC), the
hostage takers.”

More to the point, it said that,
“The lack of investment in the oil
industry explains why Caracas is
struggling to achieve the quota set by
OPEC, which has just held a summit
in Riyadh. Venezuela is reduced to
selling crude and importing practically everything the country needs.”
Nor did the paper find any consolation in Chavez’s political vision, saying his ties with Cuban leader Fidel
Castro and Iranian President Mahmud
Ahmadinezhad are “unlikely to dispel
the uncertainties concerning the 21st
century socialism championed by the
Venezuelan president.”

King Abdullah’s rebuke

Speaking of Castro, the Cuban
leader was one of the few on earth
who had any praise for Chavez’s performance at the recent summit of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries in Riyadh.
In an editorial of his own, Castro insisted that “Chavez said it very
clearly in Riyadh” by proposing that

Ecuador has resumed its membership in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, which it left in
1992, with the arrival of President
Rafael Correa at a summit of the group’s
leaders in Saudi Arabia.
Ecuador’s membership in OPEC was
welcomed by Venezuela’s President
Hugo Chavez, who had earlier championed its return. According to Ecuadorian officials, their country’s bid was
backed by Venezuela, which offered to
help pay the $4.7 million in outstanding dues (OGJ Online, Oct. 19, 2007).
In his opening speech at the OPEC
summit, Chavez also referred to “the 13
member countries of OPEC,” indicating
that the previously 12-member cartel had
welcomed in Ecuador as its new member.
Ecuador’s president Rafael Correa
wasted little time in supporting the Venezuelan leader at the summit in Riyadh,
backing Chavez’s calls to increase OPEC’s
political influence on the global stage.
At a press conference, Correa said he
agreed “completely” with Chavez’s position, which the Venezuelan leader outlined
in a speech at the summit’s opening dinner.
In his speech, Chavez said that OPEC
must “change and become a much
stronger player in the geopolitical and
geoeconomic domains” and that “in the
years ahead OPEC should set itself up as
an active political agent.”
In his remarks, Correas said: “OPEC
must take political action because we
are (making) public policy—and public
policy is political.” Correa also called on
consuming nations to do more to “compensate” OPEC nations for the environmental and other costs of producing oil.
Ecuador is the fifth largest oil producer in South America, with output of
530,000 b/d or less. In September, Ecuador produced 517,000 b/d—less than
any other member of the organization. ✦

Oil and gas industry interest in
searching for additional production potential throughout the Black Sea region
has been on the increase for several
years.
Bringing new production supplies
on line in this area presents attractive
economics to exploration and production companies due to close proximity
to consumption markets and could be
a boon
to those
countries
in the
immediate
area that
currently
must import a sizable quantity of their
energy supply—especially natural
gas—from Russia and beyond.
Recognizing the productive potential of the geology and the need for
“homegrown” energy supplies in the
area, Frontera Resources entered this
region a decade ago to make the most
of opportunities in what we refer to as
the Greater Black Sea Region (Fig. 1).
Currently, we are actively pursuing
what we have determined to be signifi-

cant drilling opportunities in the oilrich Kura basin, specifically in eastern
Georgia where Frontera holds a 100%
working interest in a 5,060 sq km
license area known as Block 12, which
it acquired in 1997 (Fig. 2).

Cretaceous play
Block 12 contains seven known, undeveloped oil fields along with numerous additional prospects for exploration
and exploitation drilling.
As a result of extensive geological
and geophysical evaluation efforts using
a mix of traditional and newer, more
sophisticated technologies, including
AVO analysis, Frontera has identified
two major geological plays within Block
12: the Tertiary Clastics Play and the
Cretaceous Carbonate Play.
The focus on the Cretaceous play is
relatively new in the upper Kura basin
and represents an exciting new opportunity for exploration.
The Kura basin is a prolific hydrocarbon producing basin, spanning more
than 400 km from the South Caspian
Sea and Azerbaijan into central Georgia.
The Kura basin, which actually is the
onshore extension of the South Caspian
basin, has been explored
since the late 1800s, with
the primary reservoir targets
being the Pliocene and
Miocene-age intervals of the
Tertiary system.
The reservoir rocks
typically are fluvial clastics
sourced from the surrounding Lesser and Greater Caucasus Mountains. They have
been such prolific producers
in the basin that they are
commonly referred to as the
“productive series.”
Much of the early drilling in the basin was based

Cretaceous carbonate drilling prospects
in the upper Kura basin at our Basin

said in late October. EnCana, with no
immediate plans for further drilling,
added that the basin, which has only
been partially tested, has potential for
large gas accumulations.
EnCana drilled three wells, Anderville

Large two-part block granted in southern Belize
Providence Energy Belize Ltd.,
Houston, has acquired exploration and
production rights to 531 sq miles in
and off southern Belize.
The award consists of a mostly
offshore block in the Gulf of Honduras
from Punta Gorda to New Haven and
another block over and southeast of
Glover Reef off Dangriga. The agreement provides for 8 years for exploration and 25 years per discovered oil
field.
Nearly all of the 57 wells drilled in
Belize had oil shows or are producing oil, “indicating the source rock is
exceptional,” said Scott Bayless, chief
executive officer of Providence Energy
Group.
Kyou Kim, Providence’s senior geologist, noted that part of Mexico’s western
coast is a subduction zone where the
organic-rich sedimentary Pacific basin
is folding underneath the Mexican continental shelf at 5-15 cm/year.
Bayless said the lands covered by the
agreement “are strategically positioned
in southern Belize where we believe a

major oil migration path extends from
Southern Mexico and the subduction
zone, through Guatemala, into Belize.”
Belize began producing oil in 2006
when Belize Natural Energy Ltd. and
CHX LLC, private Denver independents,
found 38° gravity sweet crude near
Spanish Lookout in the northern part
of the country about 55 miles westsouthwest of Belize City (OGJ Online,
Feb. 24, 2006).
R. Ramanathan, consultant to the
Belize government, said in March 2006
that he believes the next discoveries in
Belize will be made in the “southern
offshore basin, where it is continuous
with the field of Guatemala…and also
the southern basin on land near Crique
Sarco, Monkey River, and the Punta
Gorda Belt…and more in the southern
offshore basin including Glover’s Reef.”
Providence’s lands encompass these
areas. The lands contain oil seeps, gas
seeps, tar balls, and oil slicks, Bayless
said. They lie about 300 miles southeast
of Mexico’s giant Cantarell fields in the
Bay of Campeche. ✦

and abroad. Faced with a tight market
for deepwater rigs and ever-increasing
day rates, IOCs and NOCs are opting to
build their own.

Project demand
The Tenth Biennial Simmons & Co.
International Offshore Europe Energy
Conference, held in Gleneagles, Scotland, in September, featured six energy industry panel discussions; four
touched on the rig market.1
Growth in Latin America was described as “explosively strong” in the
international oil service panel, with
an “extraordinary revival” in Mexico’s
drilling activity, following 2 years of
“stagnation.”
The panel estimated that Petroleos
Mexicanos E&P’s onshore Chicontepec
initiative would require 15,000 new
wells to generate a production output
of 1 million bo/d. In August, Pemex
granted a 4-year contract to ICA Fluor,
jointly owned by Fluor Corp. and
Empresas ICA, to manage engineering, procurement, and construction of
surface facilities at Chicontepec (OGJ
Online, Aug. 14, 2007). Schlumberger
has already signed a 4-year contract to
oversee drilling and oil services for 500
new wells in Chicontepec II.
Bids for Chicontepec III, another
500-well project, were due in October.
Brazil’s 5-year E&P budget increased
30-35%, based on recent revisions by
Petrobras.
Saudi Arabia’s offshore Manifa
heavy oil project will require about 40
offshore rigs capable of horizontal and
extended reach drilling, the panelists

companies should actively pursue
subsea equipment qualification and
reliability. Rather than only focusing efforts on reactive numeric failure
analysis, EMDC employs a qualification
methodology objectively to evaluate the
adequacy of the equipment qualification and quality programs.
EMDC believes its qualification approach can be optimized by applying
the following strategies (Fig. 1):
• Focus the evaluation at the component level within the system hierarchy.
• Reference vendor part numbers
to lock down technical definition and
associated manufacturing-quality processes.
This method allows operators to
identify and track—in terms of technical definition, qualification, and quality
assurance—a set number of common
components that can be optimized in
various system configurations across a
number of projects.
Management at the component level

and operator) as client configuration

require assembling larger equipment
packages in country. It also enables
robust management of change and
communication processes between the
operator and vendor.
This approach has three key underlying processes that promote its success:
1. Breaking down components into
primary “building-blocks.”
2. Implementing generic failuremode assessment (FMA.)
3. Implementing generic product
qualification sheets (PQS).
Component-level breakdown is consistent with API categories. A comprehensive component-level breakdown
can cater to wide flexibility for fieldspecific configurations. EMDC based the
FMA approach on a simplified version
of a failure-mode effects and criticality analysis, often used as a design tool
within the industry. For example, this is
recommended as a technology qualification tool in DNV-RP-A203.1
The FMA highlights component-

specific failure mechanisms and critical
design features. The PQS approach
involves developing generic datasheets,
similar to topsides-proven instrumentation, systems, and automation society
(ISA) data sheet processes.
This part number-datasheet approach
improves qualification because it supports a structured process that improves
visibility of technical information and
fits well with the vendors’ internal
tracking systems. This approach enables
improved management of detailed
design changes, as well as facilitates
procurement, contracting, and tracking
of lessons learned.
Additionally, this process is applicable readily to proven field-tested components, increasing efficiency of the
qualification process and reducing the
need continually to redefine qualified or
field-proven equipment.

fication approach is on the inherent
value of the use of component-specific datasheets, an important first step
of this process involves identifying
components used in typical deepwater
subsea development operations. Using
API standards and experience, EMDC
has identified 11 component categories
and about 75 components based on
functionality and classes of equipment.
The component categories include
valves, hydraulic-chemical controls,
electric controls, coatings, and insulation, while the components for valves
include such types as ball, gate, and
needle and for electric control of such
equipment as flow meters and wet-mate
connectors.
Once EMDC identifies and categorizes subsea components, the components are consistently documented in
individual PQS.

atic way to identify component failure
modes and mechanisms and the tests
needed to qualify a component relative
to its intended function.
EMDC derived the basis for the FMA
templates from DNV RP-A203, which
applies specifically to components and
equipment for offshore developments.
The templates’ objective is to ensure
systematically the technology functions reliably within specified limits.
46

This aspect of the process is important
particularly because it allows operators to identify failure risks and to test
components and equipment before
project execution.
The strength of the FMA process
is that it allows operators to identify
critical qualification tests and acceptance criteria that encompass testing
of potential failure mechanisms. For
example, EMDC completed an FMA on

a thermoplastic hydraulic flying lead
(HFL) component and identified 51
potential failure mechanisms (Table 1).
A regrouping of the FMA data, however,
identified only nine unique qualification tests for evaluating all potential
failure mechanisms.
Narrowing the qualification into
these nine tests optimizes the time
spent on the testing and analysis of the
HFL.

The FMA process allows for increased visibility of failure modes and

lessons learned provide information
to maximize efficiency, reliability, and
resources.

Streamlined PQS
Streamlined PQS documentation
facilitates successful project execution
for both vendors and operators. Using
PQS data sheets, vendors also can communicate to subsuppliers the detailed
requirements for components and
equipment and other critical information.
The PQS process has the potential
to maximize vendor efficiencies and
facilitate tendering, bid evaluation, and
project execution for proven common
components. With increased efficiency
on managing vendor resources, a project team can focus more on project-specific issues, thereby reducing time spent
during early project life on equipment
qualification reviews.
Operators gain increased project
oversight on purchasing, offering the
potential to minimize engineering costs
and reduce contingencies. As resources
are constrained by short schedules, this
standardized process allows vendors
and operators to quickly access information and efficiently address issues,
which increases the likelihood of delivering on time.
The standardized approach also
provides higher visibility of qualification using clear documentation, which
facilitates operators’ fit-for-service
determinations. Additionally, it provides
a structured starting point for management of design changes, upgrades to
new service conditions, and qualification gaps.
Operators can also use the documentation created from this approach to
help leverage qualification information
across many projects. For adaptability
to different field configurations, the
component breakdown feature is ideal,
particularly because it migrates toward
using standard components throughout
the deepwater subsea industry.

O D U C T I O N

may also facilitate local content capabilities. The qualification process not only
allows established vendors and suppliers
to participate on proven goods, but also
provides a better mechanism for adding
new vendors and suppliers.
Companies also use the datasheets
and assessments as training and reference tools to benefit local content by
allowing local contributors to understand the requirements for successfully
providing reliable components and
equipment.

Dynamic framework
EMDC believes that this subsea
qualification approach provides a reliability-enhancement framework that
objectively evaluates vendor qualification programs.
EMDC offers its approach to equipment qualification for consideration
as a new recommended practice for
the rapidly evolving deepwater subsea industry; however, the principles,
processes, and tools generated through
this initiative also can apply broadly to
other functional areas where equipment
reliability is critical. ✦

while the other two units process butane.
A single dehydration facility consists of two identical beds that work
interchangeably; during normal operation one of the dehydrators is put
online to dry the wet hydrocarbon

THE RETHINKING CONTINUES
By rethinking recovery methods, producers have brought to a hungry market gas from reservoirs
once considered economically and technically impossible. Tight gas sands, shales, and coalbeds
now represent large and growing sources of an essential form of clean energy. But they’re still
unconventional. The reservoirs are complex. The costs of drilling into and completing wells in them
are high and rising. They present unique environmental problems. Producing gas from unconventional
reservoirs proﬁtably, safely, and in amounts demanded by the market requires continuous rethinking the kind of thinking that shoves back limits on what’s possible with gas supply.
Rethinking of recovery methods will continue Sept. 30 - Oct. 2, 2008, at the Unconventional Gas
International Conference & Exhibition at the Hilton Fort Worth in Fort Worth, Texas. Planned by
editors of Oil & Gas Journal and an advisory board of industry experts, the event will highlight
innovation from unconventional gas plays around the world. It will be your chance to meet and
learn from other professionals in the fastest-growing sector of the gas-producing industry.

Background
Pipeline design requires calculation
of a minimum required WT based on
appropriate standards.1-3 This minimum
calculated wall thickness includes two
parts: pressure containment and corrosion allowance. Corrosion allowance
normally accounts for the part of the
pipe wall thickness required to compensate for loss due to corrosion. Either

life of the pipeline or experience set the
corrosion allowance.
Prediction models incorporate the
effects of factors that influence corrosion inside a pipe. A true industry
standard approach to predicting pipeline internal corrosion does not exist,
although there are aspects of commonality between the models offered by a
number of operators, research organizations, and academic establishments.
A previous publication presents an overview of various corrosivity models.4

pitting corrosion.
The second, concluding article (OGJ,

model and its validating observations.

Most of the internal corrosion of
oil and gas pipelines occurs through
localized attack, characterized by loss
of metal at discrete areas of the surface
with surrounding areas essentially unaffected or subject to general corrosion.
These discrete areas may take various
geometrical shapes. Circular depressions, usually with tapered and smooth
sides, are pits. Stepped depressions
with a flat bottom and vertical sides are

mesa attack. Other geometrical forms
of localized corrosion include silts
(sometimes referred to as knife line)
and grooves.
In flowing conditions, localized
attack may take the form of parallel
grooves extending in the flow direction.
This phenomenon is known as flow-induced localized corrosion.5
Corrosivity models have contributed
to our understanding of the effects of
chemical, physical, mechanical, and
other forces on the corrosion conditions inside the pipe, but they do not
predict localized pitting corrosion, the
main failure mechanism of oil and gas
production and transportation equipment.
This article presents a practical
model to predict internal pitting corrosion of oil and gas pipelines and uses
data obtained from an operating field to
validate the model.

(dormant pits).
Pitting corrosion, therefore, does not
occur as a continuous process but rather
in various steps; the process is stochastic or random.7
The depth of a corrosion pit depends
on the pit’s growth rate and the timing
of its initiation.

Prediction problems

The problems in developing an
internal pitting corrosion model for oil
and gas pipelines are twofold:
• Development of a scientifically reliable pitting corrosion model to predict
the performance of the pipes.
• Availability of inputs from the operating pipelines to use in the scientific
model.
Field operating conditions should
predict pipeline performance. An apparent trade off exists, however, between

Pitting parameters
Laboratory and field experiments developed a model to predict internal pitting corrosion under pipeline operating
conditions. The laboratory experiments
used realistic pressure and temperature
conditions of oil and gas producing
pipelines, gathering the oil and water
samples required for this purpose from
the field. Field experiments also occurred in six operating pipelines.
Previous publications described
details of the experimental procedure
and analysis of laboratory and field experiments.8-18 The following paragraphs
present salient features.
The internal surface of a pipeline is
susceptible to corrosion. Dissolving the
products of corrosion in the environment leads to a uniform corrosion rate;
i.e., general corrosion will occur. If the
corrosion product forms intact layers that cover the surface (commonly
known as surface layers), the corrosion
rate will decrease to a minimum.
Neither of the two extreme conditions—uniform corrosion or formation
of an intact, compact, and protective
layer—generally occurs. In practice, the
following sequence of events leaves the
pipe susceptible to pitting corrosion:
• Surface layers (single or multi)
form due to corrosion of metal exposed
to the environment.
• In the event of a breakage of the
surface layer, corrosion reactions taking
place at the steel surface continuously
reinforce the surface layer.
• Under operating conditions of oil
and gas pipelines, a combination of any
or all of the three following surface layers is possible: iron oxide, iron carbonate, and iron sulfide.
• Surface layers are removed at localized areas of the steel surface but left on
the rest of the surface.
• Areas where the protective layer is
removed become anodic (with respect
to the rest of the pipe).
• The surrounding areas become
cathodic.
• The corrosion reaction taking place
at the localized anodic areas is insufficient for complete reformation of

Once this sequence of events occurs, pits initiate, propagate, and failure
eventually occurs. The probability and

• WT. The industry has established nominal thicknesses
for various steels and pipe diameters. Conditions in which
the risk of or effect of failure is high call for pipes with increased WT to be used.
• Pipe orientation. Topography causes pipes to be laid at various orientations, with angles of 0-90°. Laying the pipes at
various orientations does not increase or decrease the probability of pitting. But pipe orientation does affect the flow
pattern and deposition of solids, thus indirectly influencing
the location of pitting corrosion.

The corrosivity of a crude oil depends on its chemical
characteristics. In general, inorganic salts, sulfur content,
organic acids, dissolved gases and water, solids, and paraffins
determine crude’s corrosivity.
The degree of oil’s affinity to carbon steel yields three
categories:
Oil-wet surface: The oil has a strong affinity to be in contact with carbon steel.
Water-wet surface: The oil has no affinity to be in contact
with carbon steel. The oil may not be in contact with carbon

An oil-wet surface physically isolates the pipe from the
corrosive environment. This condition makes establishing a

A mixed-wet surface physically isolates the pipe from the
corrosive environment as long as the oil-to-water ratio is
high. This condition makes establishing a low anodic localized area surrounded by larger cathodic areas less difficult,
when compared to oil-wet surface, but the probability of
pitting corrosion remains low. Susceptibility to pitting corrosion increases at the inversion point, when the water-in-oil
emulsion becomes oil-in-water.

A water-wet surface (in the presence
of oil) is highly susceptible to pitting
corrosion. This condition makes establishment of a low anodic localized area
surrounded by larger cathodic areas
relatively easy, increasing the probability of pitting corrosion. The engulfing
oil layer above the water layer facilitates
localization and stabilization of smaller
anodes surrounded by larger cathodes,
increasing the probability beyond what
is seen in the absence of oil.
Table 1 shows the experimentally
determined variation in pit growth rates
with oil types, holding all other factors
equal.
• Water. There are two kinds of emulsion, oil-in-water and water-in-oil.
W-O emulsion has low conductivity and high resistance, making it less
corrosive, while O-W has high conductivity and low resistance, making it
more corrosive. The ratio of water-oil at
which W-O converts to O-W is called
the inversion point. Previous publications describe the methods used to
determine inversion point.17-18
The higher conductivity of water
means that the entry of any amount of
water increases the probability of pitting corrosion, unless the oil emulsifies
the water, creating a water-in-oil phase
of low conductivity. Table 2 shows the
experimentally determined variation
in pit growth rates with water and oil
emulsion, when all other factors are
equal.
• Gas (flow). Introduction of gases
can increase pitting corrosion by
increasing turbulent flow. At the same
time flow rate enables the gas to dissolve in the liquid (water). Acid gases
such as CO2 and H2S are corrosive when
dissolved in water.
Table 3 shows the experimentally
determined variation in pit growth rates
with flow, when all other factors are
equal.
• Solids. Solids have two detrimental
effects.
In a low-flow regime, deposits
may form on the surface and produce
conditions for under-deposit corrosion.
They also help establishment of areas
72

conducive to the development of small
anode-large cathode regions. In moderate flow conditions, solids may abrade
the surface removing any protective
build-up and leading to a surface profile
conducive for pitting. Solids in higherflow regimes also produce erosion-corrosion through abrasion.
Table 4 shows the experimentally
determined variation in pit growth rates
with the presence and absence of solids.
• Temperature. Higher temperatures
generally increase the corrosion rate by
accelerating the electrochemical and
chemical reactions. The rate of precipitation, however, also increases with
temperature, reducing the corrosion
rate when protective films are formed.
The influence of temperature on protective film formation is quite complex.
For layers that physically adsorb into the
metal surface, protection decreases with
increasing temperature because elevated
temperature facilitates desorption. For
layers that chemisorb onto the metal
surface, the chemical bond strength and
the resulting protection increase with
temperature up to a certain point, at
which the thermal degradation of the
layer occurs.
Increased temperature similarly
increases the diffusivity of both pitting
(e.g., chloride ions) and inhibitive (e.g.,
corrosion inhibitors, sulphate ions)
species.
Table 5 shows the experimentally
determined variation in pit growth rates
with temperature.

an arrangement.
All indications point toward additional proposals from other JVs. On Aug.
6, 2007, for example, a newly formed
JV between TransCanada Corp. and
Northwest Natural Gas Co. announced a
proposal to build and operate a natural
gas pipeline of about 220 miles from
northwestern Oregon to north-central
Oregon.
The emergence of JVs pursuing pipeline construction projects is not limited
to natural gas. ONEOK Partners LP and
a subsidiary of Williams Companies
Inc. have formed a JV to construct and
operate a 750-mile NGL pipeline from
Wyoming to Kansas.
Table 1 summarizes these projects.
JV and consortium projects have long
been the norm in international crossborder pipeline projects, often following the consortium model from the
upstream. In the past, however,
major pipeline companies typically developed US pipelines on
their own, and in many cases,
in competition with alternative projects proposed by other
major pipeline companies.
Examples of this traditional
approach remain, with Spectra

and El Paso Corp. each having

of the Rockies Express Pipeline into the
northeastern US. Greenfield projects,
however, are increasingly being sponsored by JVs. The tremendous costs and
commercial risks associated with pipeline development make development
through JVs increasingly attractive.
At the same time, however, prospective participants in JV pipeline projects
must give special attention to the risks
and unique issues associated with JVs.
This is especially true for companies
that traditionally have developed projects without partners. The success of a
JV pipeline project depends on the participants being aware of, and allotting
time to address, risks and issues created
by capital intensive infrastructure development projects with partners.

project by spreading the risks, both
through shared capital contributions
and partnering with entities that bring
unique skill sets or market positions to
the project.
A JV involving some combination of
local gas distribution company, pipeline
company, and producer, for example,
may be able to address certain commercial risks that each entity, working
alone, would be unable to mitigate. An
LDC may lack the resources and specialized staff required to pursue a pipeline
project, but an LDC with an ownership
interest in a JV pipeline may be able to
guarantee the pipeline adequate market

will likely have a commercial and regulatory philosophy that differs greatly
from the commercial and regulatory
philosophy of a producer that operates
in a part of the industry subject to less
regulatory oversight.
Although the differences may not be
as pronounced, even a JV between entities in the same segment of an industry,
such as a JV between two pipeline companies, will likely involve the meshing
of different corporate cultures. The JV
requirement that distinct companies act
as one creates complexities that would
be absent if the distinct companies
acted alone.
Participants in a JV have less flexibility and control over a project than they
would if they acted alone. The decision-making process in a JV often takes
more time and may require a degree of
consensus building. This reality follows
from the fact that each JV participant
essentially serves two or more masters.
Although any potential participant in
a JV pipeline project should be aware of
the risks and issues associated with the
JV model, participants should also be
aware that many of the risks and issues
can be addressed with careful planning
begun at the earliest conception phases
of the pipeline project.

JV issues
The first task of any JV is to define
clearly its objectives and participants.
This may seem obvious and self-explanatory but is often neglected. Just as

each bring value to a JV, each may also
bring a different commercial objective.
A pipeline company’s objective may
center on providing service to an underserved market or accessing a market
to optimize the value of what might
be an underutilized part of its existing system. An LDC, on the other hand,
may focus on introducing a competitive
supply alternative, while a producer
may seek sufficient capacity to vacate
production from a field and increase the
price at the wellhead.
Each entity may be seeking to relieve
a bottleneck, but the ultimate commercial objective of the producer or LDC
may be to affect commodity price-cost
while the pipeline company’s objective may be to maximize return on its
pipeline investment.
Such circumstances do not present insurmountable problems. The key
lies in communicating objectives and
adopting a JV structure that satisfies the
objectives of each participant. If the
objectives of the respective participants
are at fundamental odds, the likelihood
of a successful venture is low.
In the late 1990s, Portland Natural
Gas Transmission System and Maritimes
and Northeast Pipeline were pressured
to create a JV to construct and operate a shared segment of what was first
proposed to be two distinct, competing
pipelines. Development of what came to
be referred to as the joint facilities occurred despite the competing commercial objectives of PNGTS and Maritimes.
This has resulted in a steady stream of
disputes and litigation, not surprising
when entities pursue a JV without understanding and accepting each other’s
objectives.
Structuring a JV requires addressing
numerous governance issues. The decision-making process of the JV must receive immediate and ongoing attention.
If each of two participants owns 24% of
a JV and another participant owns 52%,
the participants with the minority interests in the JV likely will want to ensure
they have a role in decision making and
management, while the 52% interest
owner may want to structure the JV so
80

that a simple majority carries decisionmaking power.
Participants should also consider the
merits of crafting a voting structure that
protects against a tyranny of the minority, where one small interest owner can
hold a project hostage. The governing
structure of the JV will have to address
issues that will require unanimity, issues that will require only two of three
interest owners, and issues that can be
resolved by a simple majority.
Participants also may want to consider whether there should be limits on
the transferability of ownership interests and management responsibilities.
Some participants may be uncomfortable with the idea that they could end
up managing a JV with another participant’s undetermined assignee. Rights
of first refusal limit transferability or at
least provide existing owners with the
ability to keep a project among themselves rather than be forced into business with an undesirable or unknown
successor-in-interest. At the same time,
however, parties should take care to
structure the right of first refusal to
minimize its negative impact on interest
value in the marketplace.
In addition to establishing protocols
for JV governance, participants in a JV
must have a clear understanding of the
role they will have in the JV. Issues that
must be resolved include determining
which company will manage the development and construction of the project
and which will operate the pipeline.
Planning must also address how each
party will be compensated.
In making these determinations, JV
participants should consider not only
which of them has the most experience and expertise in operating a
pipeline, but also the overall operating
philosophy of the pipeline. They must,
further, determine the restrictions and
guidelines that will guide transactions
between the operator and its affiliates.
The issue of affiliate transactions between energy industry participants has
received increased scrutiny from both
federal and state regulators, and accordingly any JV pipeline project must take

steps to ensure the pipeline’s eventual
operator will comply with relevant
federal and state restrictions on affiliate transactions, both with respect to
arrangements with affiliates as shippers
and with respect to shared services and
support relationships with affiliates.
Failure to comply with affiliate
standards can be costly. In 2003, FERC
approved a settlement between its Division of Enforcement and Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. under which
Transco agreed to pay a $20 million
civil penalty to resolve a range of affiliate abuses.1
Since 2003, FERC has acquired
even greater authority to impose civil
penalties for affiliate violations (or
any other violations of FERC’s natural
gas rules and regulations). Under the
Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC has the
authority to impose civil penalties of up
to $1 million/day/violation.2
Although many companies are
aware of the restrictions on affiliate
transactions, some companies interpret
the restrictions in a more permissive
manner than others. Participants in a
JV must be comfortable with how the
pipeline’s operator will handle affiliate
transactions.
The likelihood that any pipeline
project may be subject to regulatory
oversight of local, state, and often federal agencies, requires that participants
share a common regulatory strategy
and philosophy. Participants should also
consider how the JV will communicate
and work with landowners who may be
directly affected by the construction of
pipeline.
Participants should likewise consider
how the JV will interact with regulators. For instance, FERC has a prefiling
process in which applicants seeking approval of an interstate gas pipeline construction project may work with FERC
staff and other interested parties to
identify and address issues related to the
project before it is formally submitted
for FERC approval. Some JV participants
may see the FERC prefiling process as an
opportunity to increase the likelihood
of a project obtaining FERC approval,

while others may see it as creating an
opportunity for a regulator or other
interested party to insist on certain conditions that might not be mandated in a
less collaborative process.
The prevailing view, shared by the
authors, holds that project developers
are well-advised to participate in the
prefiling process and to engage early,
often, and candidly with all affected
parties.
Just as participants in a JV pipeline
must agree on an approach to regulatory issues, so must they agree on an
approach to commercial issues. One
common issue that requires resolution
is whether anchor shippers (shippers
with large capacity commitments at
the project’s outset that have financially
supported its initial stages) will be
treated more favorably than shippers
not committed at the outset to take
capacity on a new project to support its
development.

as FERC have some restrictions on the
advantages that a pipeline company may
give to its anchor shippers, participants
in a JV pipeline project should consider
whether to provide their anchor shippers with rates or other benefits commensurate with their commitments.
Each participant must be comfortable
with how commercial issues such as the

treatment of anchor shippers will be
handled. ✦

New power plant engine burns heavy oil
Here’s the new 20-cylinder 46F
engine for power plant installations
burning heavy fuel oil.
The new engine develops 23,000
kW at 600 rpm, suitable for 50 and
60 Hz electricity generation. It offers more power and less emissions
than the firm’s existing 18-cylinder
Model 46 engine, while maintaining
high energy efficiency.
The new 20V46F engine develops
1,150 kW/cylinder compared with
975 kW/cylinder from the 18V46,
at 600 rpm (50/60 Hz) as opposed
to 500 rpm (50 Hz) and 514 rpm

CONDENSATE EAST OF SUEZ:
NGL and its Naphtha Impacts in
Asia Pacific and Mideast Gulf
Condensate and the Light-End Products Squeeze
By Asia Paciﬁc Energy Consulting

• This is the “deﬁnitive” report on
condensate in the fastest growing,
critical regions of the world, Asia
Paciﬁc and the Mideast Gulf.
• The study provides a complete guide
to optimizing value in future condensate production, utilization, and trade.

Condensate coming into its own
Condensate, one of the two groups
deﬁned as Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs),
is ﬁnally coming of age in world trade,
marketing, reﬁning and petrochemicals. Condensate sales are moving
from a niche marketing specialty to
a mainstream segment of crude and
products trade, and nowhere is this
more evident than in the Mideast Gulf
and Asia Paciﬁc.
This report explains how the protean
nature of condensate allows it to be
used in a wide range of sectors: as a
reﬁnery slate component; in specialized distillation towers called condensate splitters; in direct feed to ethylene crackers; in gasoline blending and
as a substitute for gas in turbine power generation. It can be deﬁned as a
base material, a blending component,
a feedstock or a boiler feed.

From the Subscribers Only area of

Cost study plus
math should doom
US energy bills
The oil and gas industry should welcome an important study projecting the
costs of energy bills under consideration in
Congress. But it should not let an impressive modeling exercise obscure simple
mathematics.
Forecasts about economic effects are
difﬁcult to make and easy to nitpick. Flawed
details and disputed assumptions can discredit whole studies that reach otherwise

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

valid conclusions.
Energy bill supporters will treat the new
cost study by Charles Rivers Associates that
way if they don’t try simply to ignore it.
Commissioned by the American Petroleum Institute, the study says the legislation
would lower US gross domestic product by
1.7% against baseline projections in 2020
and by 4% in 2030 (OGJ Online, Nov. 14,
2007).
By 2030, the study says, the legislation
would lower employment by 4.9 million
jobs and average annual purchasing power
of US households by $1,700.
And it would trim production of oil
against baseline projections by an average of 4%/year and gas by 2%/year during
2010-20. Demand for oil would be about
18% lower than expectations in 2020 and
33% in 2030 due to “signiﬁcantly higher
costs faced by end-users.”
These things happen when a government raises taxes on and in other ways
punishes the industry that produces commodities representing almost two thirds of
US energy supply. They are strong reasons
not to impose the taxes or inﬂict the punishment.
If backers of the energy bills pay the
study any attention at all, they’ll assault details and insist questionable tidbits discredit
everything. Or they might dismiss the study
on sight because of API’s role in it, arguing
that anything touched by an oil group bears
ineffaceable tarnish.
These days, US energy policy-making
repels facts about energy, especially facts
from an industry that knows something
about the subject.
Even if industry opponents manage to
sweep aside an important study, though,
the energy bills still won’t bear up to math.
It’s mathematically impossible to lower
energy costs by replacing oil and gas with
costlier substitutes.
It also should be mathematically impossible for anyone who argues otherwise to
hold elective ofﬁce, but politics follows its
own weird rules.

Crude price wafﬂes above $90/bbl
The front-month crude futures contract fell $3.45 to $91.17/bbl Nov. 13 on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest level in nearly 2 weeks, after the International
Energy Agency (IEA) in Paris reduced its estimates of global oil demand for the
fourth quarter through 2008.
Citing higher prices and weaker-than-expected economic data from the US and
the former Soviet Union, IEA reduced its projected fourth-quarter demand for crude
by 500,000 b/d. The organization also reduced its 2008 demand estimate by 300,000
b/d. IEA estimates world demand for crude will average 85.7 million b/d in 2007, up
1.2% from 2006 levels. It’s projecting demand of 87.7 million b/d in 2008, up 2.3%
from 2007.
Crude futures prices rebounded Nov. 14 as the market worried about a possible
counter-seasonal draw of US oil inventories. But the December contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes dropped 66¢ to $93.43/bbl Nov. 15 in New York after the
Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported the ﬁrst build in US crude inventories in 4 weeks and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries reduced its
forecast for oil demand growth.
Citing higher energy prices and warmer winter weather, OPEC reduced its estimate of fourth-quarter growth in global oil demand by 100,000 b/d to 1.7 million b/d,
for a growth rate of 1.97%, down from 2.1% in its previous monthly report. OPEC
said demand for crude in 2007 will grow only 1.4%, not 1.5% as previously estimated, but its outlook for the ﬁrst quarter of 2008 remains unchanged at 1.8% growth, or
1.5 million b/d.
US crude inventories jumped 2.8 million bbl to 314.7 million bbl in the week ended
Nov. 9. Consensus of Wall Street analysts was for a decline of 400,000 bbl. US gasoline
stocks increased 700,000 bbl to 195 million bbl vs. an expected drop of 200,000 bbl.
Distillate fuel inventories fell 2 million bbl to 133.4 million bbl during the same period
instead of the expected decline of 100,000 bbl. However, most of that crude build was
in the isolated Petroleum Administration for Defense District (PADD) 5, including the
West Coast, Alaska, and Hawaii. Crude inventories in PADD 2—the Midwest, including the Cushing, Okla., pipeline distribution point—remained unchanged, said Olivier
Jakob, managing director of Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland.
“Following a sharp rise in imports, crude oil inventories rose by just 900,000 bbl
east of the Rockies and were ﬂat at Cushing,” said Paul Horsnell at Barclays Capital
Inc., London. “Like crude oil, the rise in gasoline inventories was concentrated on the
West Coast, and the required seasonal build before yearend still looks far too anemic
to us.” Horsnell also noted that US gasoline demand appears to have been down
only 0.4% from year-ago levels in the ﬁrst 8 days of November despite a 39.4% jump
in retail prices.
Few things have the potential to be more corrosive to energy prices “than a sudden cholera-like outbreak” of pessimism over crude demands of the US and other
members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Horsnell
said. “The sense of the IEA’s comments is that they believe that the speeding up
in oil demand growth would have been greater if prices had not risen. In our view
that is precisely the reason why prices had to rise because we believe that demand
growth rates as high as the IEA’s original forecasts could have led to some signiﬁcant degree of stress within the system,” he said.
Major market change
The most signiﬁcant change in oil markets over the last 10 years “is the increased
length of time required for markets to rebalance in the aftermath of both supply and
demand shocks,” said Adam Sieminski, chief energy economist for Deutsche Bank
AG, Washington, DC. “We still believe that oil prices are going to come down from
today’s levels but that the time frame required to do that has been stretched out,” he
said. “We still believe that oil prices should eventually fall toward the mid-$60/bbl.”
At $95/bbl the real price of crude is “back to levels reached in early 1980s that
were associated with a global recession,” Sieminski said. “Relative to gross domestic
product, however, it would take $125-150/bbl oil to achieve the same peak, because
incomes have grown faster than the oil price. There is also good evidence that what
causes oil recessions is war-related fears of not getting oil at any price. The slow boil
on prices that we have had for the last 7 years is less destructive to consumer psychology. In short, there is no obvious tipping point, and that is why the price keeps
going up.”

Is cathodic protection worthless?
What kind of question is this?
Most in the pipeline industry
agree that cathodic protection
(CP) is the smart way to provide
backup corrosion protection on
underground pipelines.
But consider: If you use solid film
backed corrosion coatings, you may
be wasting money by adding CP to
the pipeline.
There is a common sense reason for
this statement. CP systems protect
pipelines by delivering electrical
current to the steel surface. Solid
film back corrosion coatings have
the property of resistivity, which
means they block electrical current.
This blocking effect is called
cathodic shielding.
The phenomenon of cathodic
shielding, or blocking of protective
CP current, has been the subject of
dozens of technical papers since the
mid 1980’s. You can review a cross
section of these papers on
Polyguard’s website. You can also

Phone: (011) 214.515.5000
www.polyguardproducts.com

view a 10 minute explanation of the
cathodic shielding process.
Worldwide, we estimate that over
half of pipelines are being coated
with solid film back coatings, such as
shrink sleeves, tapes, and 2 or 3 layer
systems. Most of these lines have CP
systems. These are the operators who
may be wasting their money on CP.
Moreover, many install shielding
coatings on girth welds, the most
vulnerable area for corrosion.
Two corrosion coatings are proven
to be non-shielding, and allow
passage of protective CP currents.
One of these coatings is FBE. The
other is Polyguard RD-6.
NACE Standard RP0169-2002 states:
“Materials....that create electrical
shielding should not be used on the
pipeline” 1.
49 CFR §192.461 states:
“External protective coating …must
…have properties compatible with any
supplemental cathodic protection.” 2

If you are concerned that your
organization is behind this curve, we
recommend:
1. Visit
polyguardproducts.com/failsafecoating.htm
and review the large body of information
about shielding problems.
2. Talk to operators who have used
Polyguard’s RD-6 system. (There are
many) Ask them if they know of any
serious corrosion or SCC ever found
under RD-6. (We don’t, even after 19
years and thousands of installations).
3. Have someone in your organization attend
the NACE course “Coatings in Conjunction
with Cathodic Protection” .

1. NACE Standard RP0169-2002 “Control of
External Corrosion on Underground or
Submergeed Metallic Piping Systems”.
2. 49 CFR Ch.1 (§192.461 see also §195.559)

Polyguard has been ISO 9000 certified since 1996.

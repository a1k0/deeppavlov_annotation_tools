COVER
Luberef II is the second of two lube oil plants operated by Saudi
Aramco Lubricating Oil Refining Co. (Luberef), a joint venture of
Saudi Aramco (70%) and ExxonMobil Corp. (30%). Standing
next to Aramco’s Yanbu refinery, the plant started up in 1999 with
capacity to produce 2.1 million bbl/year; it boosted Luberef’s
total refining capacity to 4 million bbl/year. A special report on
advances in Middle East processing begins on p. 48 with a Purvin
& Gertz analysis of how the condensate market in the region is
likely to develop and whether investments in processing are likely.
Following this article is an account of efforts to reduce foaming in
two Aramco amine sweetening plants. Photograph from Aramco.

Industry seeks more time to meet fuel rules
The Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA) on Aug. 13
petitioned the California Air Resources Board (CARB) for a more
reasonable timeframe for meeting new fuel rules approved by the
board earlier this summer. CARB has 30 days to respond.
CARB on June 14 amended California’s reformulated gasoline
rules to permit increased use of ethanol and lower-carbon fuels.
The new rule gives refiners 2 years to comply or face punitive and
costly penalties.
WSPA Chief Operating Officer Cathy Reheis-Boyd said, “We are
not asking the board to change the new fuel specifications. We are
simply asking the board to take into account that refiners also must
comply with many other environmental regulations and construction realities when making major refinery changes; and that takes
more time than the current rules provided.”
In addition, the California Energy Commission (CEC) testified
that based on its detailed modeling and surveys, it could take more
than 4 years to complete the modifications. In fact, other major
changes in California fuel formulations have taken at least 4 years
to implement: California’s cleaner-burning gasoline introduced in
1996 took 51 months, and California’s Phase 3 cleaner-burning
gasoline introduced in 2000 took 481⁄2 months.
Reheis-Boyd said, “Our industry is committed to meeting these
new fuel rules and is already working towards meeting them. But
our companies need a reasonable timeframe to build the required
facilities, given the lengthy process required to comply with numerous state and local regulations.”
CEC also said a more reasonable timeframe “would minimize
the risk of supply difficulties and associated price spikes for California consumers and businesses.”

Philippines to vary energy sources, use more gas
Recently appointed Philippines’ Energy Secretary Angelo T.
Reyes has promised to make more use of natural gas to vary the
country’s energy sources and lessen its dependence on imported
oil, estimated at some 325,000 b/d during 2006.
“Natural gas is the fuel of the future. [It] provides energy independence, stable and secure energy supply, and clean and efficient

fuel. We are currently using this for power alone, but we need to
promote it in the transport, industrial, and commercial sectors,”
Reyes said. He said several gas projects earmarked for construction
will require $5 billion in investment during the next 7 years.
Among the projects Reyes said his department proposes is conversion of the Sucat, Limay, and Malaya coal-thermal power plants
to gas-fired power facilities and construction of the 100-km Batangas-Manila I and 140-km Bataan-Manila II gas pipelines.
Plans also are under way for construction of new gas facilities in
Central Luzon, Cebu, Agusan and Davao, and Palawan, while compressed natural gas facilities could be built in Luzon in areas such
as Batangas, the Clark economic zone, and Cavite.
Reyes said gas constituted 29% of the country’s power generation mix in 2006, while coal and oil made up 27% and 8%, respectively.

Iran oil minister replaced, caretaker appointed
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has removed Kazem
Vaziri Hamaneh as the country’s oil minister and appointed Gholamhossein Nozari as the caretaker until further notice. Analysts
have interpreted the move as stamping his authority on one of the
country’s major industries that generates lucrative revenues.
Ahmadinejad did not give a reason for replacing Hamaneh, but
in a letter announcing his replacement, the head of state-owned
National Iranian Oil Co., Ahmadinejad thanked Hamaneh for his
efforts to date. A spokesman from the Iranian oil ministry told OGJ
that Hamaneh would serve the president in an advisory role on oil
and gas affairs. He had held the role of oil minister for the last 2
years.
Iranian press said that Ahmadinejad was unhappy with Hamaneh’s performance in attracting foreign investment and with the
unrest in the country following gasoline rationing in June. Critics
also said Iran had sold gas too cheaply to India and Pakistan via the
proposed 2,300 km pipeline under development.
Ahmadinejad will need to introduce a candidate before Iran’s
parliament for the appointment to become official, the ministry
spokesman added. He was unable to give a timetable on when this
would happen and if indeed Nozari would be presented. ✦

Tullow makes deepwater oil ﬁnd off Ghana
Tullow Oil PLC has discovered a light oil accumulation with its
Hyedua-1 well on the deepwater Tano license in 1,530 m of water
off Ghana.
As the initial exploration well on the license, Hyedua-1 targeted
the equivalent Santonian turbidite sandstones found in the Mahogany-1 discovery well, drilled about 5.3 km to the northeast on

the adjacent West Cape Three Points license.
Hyedua-1, drilled to 4,002 m TD by the Fred Olsen Energy ASA
Belford Dolphin deepwater drillship, encountered a 202 m gross
reservoir interval containing 108 m of high-quality stacked reservoir sandstones and net hydrocarbon-bearing pay of 41 m.
Logs and pressure tests indicate the strong likelihood that the
reservoir sands are in communication with those at the Mahogany

discovery. Well data results further suggest that the Hyedua-1 and
Mahogany-1 wells could represent a continuous accumulation
with combined hydrocarbon columns in excess of 361 m within a
single continuous trap extending across the West Cape Three Points
and Deepwater Tano blocks, the company said.
Hyedua-1 will be sidetracked, prior to casing, to acquire core
data over the reservoir interval and suspended for potential use as
a development well.
Tullow will now appraise the accumulation. Suitable vessels
have been identified to carry out a 910 sq km 3D seismic survey,
covering the combined feature on both blocks, and a program of
up to three additional appraisal wells late this year.
Tullow operates the Tano license with a 49.95% interest and
holds 22.9% interest in the West Cape Three Points license.

InterOil gauges gas at Elk-2 appraisal well
InterOil Corp., Toronto, said it has achieved positive results
from its Elk-2 appraisal well on PPL 238 in Papua New Guinea.
“We are now confident that the Elk structure contains sufficient
gas to underpin the first train of an LNG plant, which will be built
by Liquid Niugini Gas Ltd. adjacent to our refinery [planned at Port
Moresby], and sufficient oil shows to justify sidetracking to confirm an oil leg,” said InterOil Chairman and Chief Executive Phil
Mulacek. The Elk-2 well was programmed to test the entire 2,000
ft Puri and Mendi limestone section in a downdip position of the
discovery well 2.9 miles away (OGJ Online, Feb. 13, 2007).
Drilling and testing at Elk-2 confirmed 4,452 ft of indicated
hydrocarbon column from the highest known gas in Elk-1 to the
lowest indicated hydrocarbons in Elk-2, InterOil said. Mud logs
indicated multiple gas zones, and there were multiple oil shows
throughout a 594 ft column. In addition, the well had flowed gas
and gas liquids during a drillstem test, the company said.
The target Puri and Mendi limestone reservoirs are much thicker than predrill estimates, it added.
The company intends to drill the Elk-2 well to total depth, log
it, complete it, and test it.
“We will then sidetrack the well to intersect the potential oil
leg structurally higher in the porous Mendi limestone section,”
Mulacek said.
InterOil has been designated as the preferred natural gas supplier for the planned Port Moresby LNG project, which consists
of a two-train, 9 million tonne/year liquefaction plant having a
nominal processing capacity of 1.6 bcfd of condensate and gas liquids, handling and storage facilities, and a gas pipeline from supply
sources.
InterOil’s Elk and Antelope structures are the key gas resources
for the project (OGJ, Nov. 20, 2006, Newsletter).

LNG production is still on track to begin in 2012, InterOil
said.

Total farms into offshore Vietnamese block
Total SA has received approval from the Vietnamese government
to acquire a 35% interest in the production-sharing contract for
offshore exploration Block 15-1/05. The French company will
work alongside PetroVietnam Exploration & Production, which
serves as block operator with 40%, and South Korea’s SK Corp.,
with 25%.
Block 15-1/05, which covers 3,840 sq km, is about 40 km off
Vietnam in 40 m of water. It lies in Cuu Long basin near four recent
discoveries—Su Tu Den, Su Tu Vang, Su Tu Trang, and Su Tu Nau.
The partners have already shot 2D seismic surveys on the block.
Phase 1 exploration, which will be launched before yearend,
will include 800 sq km of 3D seismic data acquisition and the
drilling of two wells.
Total’s agreement with Vietnam also calls for stepped-up international cooperation between the French firm and PetroVietnam,
particularly in the area of exploration. In 2006 the Asia-Pacific region accounted for about 253,000 boe/d, or 11%, of Total’s production. Total is mainly active in Indonesia, where it has operated
Mahakam block with partner Inpex since 1970 and is one of the
country’s leading producers of LNG. It also has gas production operations in Thailand and Myanmar as well as offshore operations
in Brunei.
Total diversified its assets with the recent acquisition of interests
in a number of exploration projects in Australia, Indonesia, and
Bangladesh. It also acquired a 24% stake in Australia’s Ichthys LNG
project, in partnership with Inpex (OGJ Online, Feb. 2, 2007). It
also has signed a contract with China National Petroleum Corp. to
appraise, develop, and produce gas from China’s South Sulige block
(OGJ, Dec. 11, 2006, p. 18).

Southern Michigan gets TBR oil discovery
Continental Resources Inc., Enid, Okla., plans to drill two offsets in November to an Ordovician Trenton-Black River discovery
in Hillsdale County, Mich., 60 miles southwest of Detroit.
The McArthur 1-36 tested at a rate of 20 bbl/hr of oil with 240
psi flowing tubing pressure on a 3⁄4-in. choke. The well cut 182 ft
of potential pay at 3,400-4,020 ft.
Continental has 83% working interest in the discovery and has
identified other opportunities modeled after Albion-Scipio field in
the area, where it holds 13,280 net acres of leasehold. McArthur
1-36 is the company’s first well in Michigan.
Hillsdale County adjoins Indiana and Ohio. ✦

(OGJ Online, Jan. 30, 2007). The development also uses a floating
production, storage, and offloading vessel.
Murphy also expects first sales of its associated natural gas via

alone. After completion of A2, the Todco 250 jack up will move
back to the A1 well to complete operations.
The partners are completing operations on the production liner
across the reservoir intervals.
A production platform, with the capability to process the gas
and export it via nearby existing infrastructure, has been successfully installed on High Island A268 to process gas from the A1
well.

Providence to start gas ﬂow from High Island A2

NAOSC to produce bitumen from Leismer project

Providence Resources PLC expects to start natural gas production from the lowest reservoir level in its A2 well at High Island
A268 in the Gulf of Mexico by the end of August. The well was
drilled to a deviated 6,863 ft TVD, targeting potential gas accumulations.
Predrill gross recoverable volumes from the block range 3.5-5.8
bcf of gas.
The well encountered two high-quality gas-bearing sands in
A2, assessed in an analysis of the well log and sidewall core data.
Providence said its predrill expectations were met in the combined
net gas pay. The well was drilled from the newly installed High
Island A268 “A” platform using the Todco 250 jack up. Providence
said the A2 well TD bottomhole location is about 1 mile east of the
A1 well discovery.
This production will compliment gas from A1, announced in
January, from which production will start in mid-September. The
A2 discovery further underpins the economic justification for the

Statoil ASA subsidiary North American Oil Sands Corp. (NAOSC)
will produce 10,000 b/d of bitumen from its Leismer demonstration project in Canada by late 2009 or early 2010.
Bitumen production will come from 22 horizontal well pairs
linked to four well pads and a processing facility will generate
steam for underground injection to make the heavy oil less viscous.
The Alberta Energy and Utilities Board has already given the
Leismer project the go ahead.
NAOSC operates 1,110 sq km of oil sands leases in the Athabasca region of Alberta, northeast of Edmonton, which is one of the
largest heavy oil provinces in the world. Statoil acquired NAOSC
earlier this year for $2 billion (OGJ Online, Apr. 27, 2007).
“The Leismer demonstration project is the first lease to be developed in the NAOSC portfolio. The NAOSC portfolio is expected
to yield more than 200,000 b/d at the end of the next decade,”
Statoil said. ✦

Processing
OMV to upgrade European reﬁneries
OMV AG, Vienna, planning a program of upgrades in its European refineries, said it will shut down its 69,280 b/d Petrobrazi refinery in Romania for upgrades sooner than originally planned—in
this year’s fourth quarter instead of first quarter 2008.
In Germany, it plans to install an expanded cracker and new
metathesis plant at its 72,000 b/d Burghausen refinery, work that
will take 6 weeks in the fourth quarter. “Additional propylene will
be delivered to Borealis, feeding the new Borstar propylene plant
coming on stream at the same time,” OMV said. In addition, the
262,300 b/d Bayernoil refinery in Germany will be restructured to
improve plant configuration, OMV said.
In Austria the company will construct a thermal cracker in its
208,600 b/d Schwechat refinery in Vienna so it can process more
heavy crude and reduce the amount of heavy fuel oil in the product
slate.
A company spokeswoman told OGJ that OMV’s strategy is
to build on two hubs: a Western hub comprised of Schwechat,
Burghausen, and Bayernoil that would have a refining capacity of
18.4 million tonnes/year and an Eastern hub of Petrobrazi and Arpechim in Romania, with a capacity of 8 million tonnes/year (OGJ
Online, Oct. 12, 2006). Arpechim is operated by OMV’s Romanian
unit Petrom.
OMV said it also will begin preparations to construct a 360-km
ethylene pipeline in southern Germany from Munchsmunster to

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
Ludwigshafen that will connect the southeast Bavarian chemical
triangle with the northwest European ethylene network at Ludwigshafen. The pipeline will be completed in third quarter 2008.
OMV upstream priorities for 2007 are to develop Strasshof gas
field in Austria, Maari oil field in New Zealand, Komsomolskoe oil
field in Kazakhstan, Block S2 in Yemen, and oil discoveries in Libya
and to complete Pohokura gas field development in New Zealand,
said OMV Chief Executive Wolfgang Ruttenst at a press conference
Aug. 16.
In Romania, the company will continue its modernization of
production facilities to enhance efficiency and reduce production
costs.

Coffeyville Resources restarts ﬂooded units
Coffeyville Resources Refining & Marketing LLC said it has restarted most of the operating units at its 100,000 b/cd refinery in
Coffeyville, Kan., after a record flood of the Verdigris River caused
the shutdown of the facility in early July.
Process operations that have been restarted include two crude
units, two vacuum units, one naphtha hydrotreater, a catalytic reformer, two distillate hydrotreaters, a fluid catalytic cracking unit,
the alkylation unit, the isomerization unit, the delayed coking unit,
and sulfur recovery facilities. Remaining units are in varying stages
of start-up.
The company also said the refinery would be fully restored

ahead of its earlier mid-September projection. It cautioned, however, that mechanical challenges created by the flooding that reached
more than 6 ft deep will require the company to carefully monitor
all equipment as it increases throughput to full production after
start-up. In addition, truck rack sales from the company-owned
terminal in Coffeyville could resume as early as next week, Coffeyville Resources said. It has been shipping product via pipeline
from preflood inventory.
The company’s adjacent nitrogen fertilizer plant, which was
also flooded but sustained less damage than the refinery because it
sets on higher ground, was restarted and began shipping product
2 weeks after the flood (OGJ Online, July 23, 2007).

Slavneft-Yanos eyes Russian reﬁnery upgrade
Slavneft-Yanos, owned by TNK-BP and Gazpromneft, has let a

Hammerfest LNG plant processes ﬁrst Snohvit gas Proposed LNG terminals in France face problems
Statoil ASA said the gas processing facility at the Hammerfest
LNG plant in northern Norway has received gas from Snohvit field
on Aug. 21. The plant at Hammerfest is Europe’s first export facility
of its kind.
Gas lifted from Snohvit field previously flowed as far as the slug
catcher, but this is the first time gas has reached the processing
facility, Statoil said.
The company is expected to begin sending LNG exports from
the Snohvit LNG project in the fourth quarter (OGJ Online, May
17, 2007).
Interests in the project are operator Statoil with 33.53%, Petoro
SA 30%, Total E&P Norge 18.4%, Gaz de France 12%, Amerada
Hess Norge 3.26%, and RWE Dea Norge 2.81%.

New JV proposes Paciﬁc Northwest pipeline
Palomar Gas Transmission LLC, a newly formed joint venture of
TransCanada Corp. and Northwest Natural Gas Co. (NNG), propose
to build and equally own a natural gas pipeline that would serve
Oregon, the Pacific Northwest, and the western US. If approved,
the transmission line could begin service in late 2011.
As proposed, the project would include 220 miles of 36-in.
pipe extending from northwestern to north-central Oregon, connecting TransCanada’s existing Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN)
system with NNG’s distribution system near Molalla, Ore., 30
miles southeast of Portland.
The project design includes an extension option that would
serve the Bradwood Landing LNG terminal proposed by NorthernStar LLC on the Colombia River.
The main section of the project is a 110-mile eastern portion
that accounts for $300-350 million of the total project cost estimated at $600-700 million.
NNG’s utility operation has agreed to contract for about 100
MMcfd of capacity on the pipeline. The company currently depends on a single interstate pipeline for its supply, two thirds of
which comes through the Columbia Gorge.
TransCanada’s GTN system will operate the Palomar pipeline,
and has yet to request preliminary environmental approval for the
project from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Even before that filing is made, Palomar will begin the public engagement
process, the company said.

A local environmentalist group and a handful of residents near
Antifer are opposing construction of the proposed 9 billion cu
m/year Gaz de Normandie LNG terminal, regasification unit, and
pipeline at Antifer near the Le Havre oil port in Normandy, France
(OGJ Online, Oct. 10, 2006).
Another problem, which is the “Not in my backyard,” or Nimby, syndrome is threatening construction of a 6 billion cu m LNG
receiving-regasification terminal that the Netherlands company 4
Gas plans at Verdon, 100 km south of Bordeaux at the mouth of the
Gironde River (OGJ, Aug. 21, 2006, Newsletter).
Concerning the Gaz de Normandie LNG project, the environmental group, which reportedly has collected 7,500 signatures on
an internet petition, wants the project scrapped, saying the project’s
purpose is profit and not because France needs more gas—a “fossil
fuel which produces carbon dioxide”—according to environmentalist leader Francois Auber.
GDN Pres. Jean-Luc Poyer, in charge of the project for the main
shareholder Poweo, told OGJ that there also were supporters of the
project and that public input is scheduled for Sept. 14 through Dec.
14. The National Commission for Debates had asked Poyer to avoid
polemics until then, he said.
GDN is a €500 million LNG regasification terminal project led
by energy supplier Poweo 34%, in joint venture with E.On AG of
Germany 24.5%, Austrian utility Verbund 24.5%, and the oil storage and port firm CIM 17%.
Concerning the Verdon terminal, France’s State Secretary for
Transport Dominique Bussereau wants the €400 million terminal
transferred from its proposed location on a 700-ha industrial site
to La Rochelle, north of Bordeaux beyond the mouth of La Gironde. His constituency faces Verdon on the other side of the Gironde River mouth, and he said the terminal will spoil a “tourist
area.”
A public debate is scheduled to begin in mid-September and
end in December on the terminal, after which acceptance or rejection of the site will be decided, said 4 Gas General Manager for
France Henk Jonkmal.
The final decision will rest with State Minister for Ecology and
Sustainable Development Jean-Louis Borloo, who also is responsible for Transport and Energy. ✦

Correction: Camisea project
The July 23, 2007, edition of Oil &
Gas Journal has a listing of major oil and
gas projects being developed (OGJ, July
23, 2007, pp. 43-60).
On p. 58 of the project table, an
entry under “Peru” reports for “Camisea
gas/Peru LNG SRL” a peak year of 2009
and gas production of 1,300 MMscfd. It
lists the operator as Hunt Oil and under
“Development type” shows: “Blocks 56
and 88, 700-km gas pipeline, 575-km
liquids pipeline.”
I’m afraid that O&GJ’s database on
these projects contains pieces of wrong
information. As the manager responsible
for one portion of the project (gas production) I would like to offer you some
clarification:
• Camisea gas: right.
• 1,300 MMscfd: partly right. We are
increasing gas treatment capacity from
nominal 440 MMscfd to 1,160 MMscfd
in a project expected to be ready by
mid-2008 with peak investments in
2007-08.
• Blocks 56 and 88: right. But operator of both blocks is Pluspetrol Peru
Corp. (not Hunt Oil, as stated).
• 700-km gas pipeline and 575-liquids pipeline: wrong. Both pipelines are
already built and working (as part of
the initial start-up of Camisea in 2004).
These pipelines are property of TGP
(Transportadora de Gas del Peru).
• Peru LNG SRL: right. Under development, operator is Hunt Oil. Hunt Oil
is also a shareholder of TGP and a nonoperator partner in Blocks 56 and 88.

Restating temperatures
Too much can be made about mistakes in
US surface-temperature data from the Goddard
Institute for Space Studies (GISS). Too little can be
made about them, too.
Conservative commentators overreacted to
revelations that GISS had erred in ways that stoked
alarm about global warming. GISS is run by James
Hansen, one of the first scientists to issue warnings about human contributions to observed
warming and a longstanding ally of Al Gore in
the former vice-president’s crusade for aggressive
response. When a Canadian mathematician pressed
for and won a downward correction to GISS temperature data, bloggers and radio talk-show hosts
pounced. One of them, Rush Limbaugh, called the
correction evidence that “this whole global warming thing is a scientific hoax.”
That’s an overstatement. But so, evidently, was
Gore’s claim in his award-winning scare movie,
“An Inconvenient Truth,” that 9 of the 10 hottest
years in US history have occurred since 1995.

ing. Even if that happened, no one would believe
it. Young energy consumers and voters have been
taught that their parents overheated the planet by
driving to work and that anyone with doubts must
be under an evil spell cast by oil companies.
In any event, it’s no hoax that carbon dioxide of
human origin is accumulating in the atmosphere.
The central issue of the brittle global warming
debate should be the extent to which the gas accumulation causes the temperature rise. Serious
scientists can be found on both sides of the question. The unfortunate habit of politics is to note
the coincidence of CO2 and temperature gains, to
assume causation, and to insist that people do anything imaginable to halt the trend, starting now.
In fact, the CO2 and temperature records don’t
correlate perfectly; in the US, the correlation is
worse now than it was before the GISS changes.
Timing discrepancies have long been a source for
doubt—Gore and his fans call it denial—about the
ability of people to affect global temperature by
cutting CO2 emissions.

Other questions remain. By how much can

COMMENT
As I contemplate attending the
Oct. 13 homecoming at Louisiana
Tech University to be recognized as
a member of the graduating class of
1957, I look back with fond memories.
My experiences involving professors
and classmates, particularly those in the
Department
of Petroleum
Engineering (PE), are
now a half a
century old,
but indelible
in my mind.
On further reflection, however, even
I have a bit of difficulty in appreciating
the contrast between how petroleum
engineers were educated then and now.
So, what is the current level of undergraduate preparation? How should
academic programs evolve to meet the
ever-changing needs of the upstream
petroleum industry?
My opinions are from the viewpoint
of a petroleum engineer who earned a
BS degree in petroleum engineering in
1957 and who has been in continuous
professional practice since that time. I
also have the added perspective as the
grandfather of an enthusiastic young
man entering Texas A&M University this
fall to study petroleum engineering.

Industry needs fresh approach
to petroleum engineer training
D. Ronald Harrell
Ryder Scott Co. LP
Houston

My comments are not intended to
express a lack of respect for the dedicated, learned professional academic staffs
in the various outstanding US and overseas universities with petroleum engineering programs. Indeed, I understand
and appreciate their daily challenges
with budgets, staff, equipment, and the
university and government bureaucracies that continually limit their dreams
and aspirations.
I refreshed my recollections by
reviewing my college transcripts, and,
sure enough, my 4-year degree plan
required 145 hr of coursework with 0
electives. That included 19 hr in math,
25 hr in chemistry and physics, 11 hr
in engineering drafting, and 5 total
hr for pattern-making, machine shop,
welding, and surveying. Civil engineering courses totaled 16 hr with 9 hr devoted to electrical engineering subjects.
I was required to take six geology
courses plus labs for a total of 20 hr. My
eight petroleum engineering courses
combined for 26 hr of college credit.
The remaining courses varied from
mechanical and industrial engineering courses, English, technical writing, speech, and economics. I had no
courses in humanities, business, or in
statistics and statistical analysis.

in the petroleum industry. Although
there may be room for a traditional
statistics course in the curriculum, the
emphasis should be on courses taught
by engineers that leverage relevant
examples with a practical, petroleumoriented focus.”
The authors, both of whom are
respected academics, further say that
“the uncertainty understanding thus
developed at an early stage then should
be used as a common thread through
the entire set of subsequent engineering
courses.” Again, the availability of qualified staff to accomplish this is a presentday limitation.
These observations and recommendations by Bratvold and Begg are fully
appreciated by this writer, who has
spent a career in estimating and evaluating petroleum reserves and resources
while continually struggling with assessing the true range of both technical
uncertainty and commercial risk associated with resource classification and
categorization. Can we continue to produce top quality petroleum engineers
in a traditional 4-year academic cycle?
My belief is that we cannot. Universities
across the US and other countries are
working very hard to produce qualified
young men and women to serve as petroleum engineers, and I applaud their
noble and worthy efforts.
However, I believe industry and academia must come to recognize that the
unique and expanding challenges facing
the petroleum industry this century
demand even better-trained individuals.
Many would say that the industry-academia cooperation to which I refer is
alive and well and has been for a long
time. I refer to a recent statement attributed to John Hofmeister, president
of Shell Oil Co., where he said “Just as
the oil and gas industry faces the ‘great
crew change,’ it is also gearing up to
meet a rising global demand for energy.
These dual challenges require many
new engineers with next-generation
skill sets—and their education will take
creative thinking and unprecedented
partnerships between industry and
academia.”

other forms of endowments, structured
fellowships, and funding of research
projects—constitute the minimum
level of support to be underwritten
by the industry—a sector that desperately needs quality graduates and is the
prime beneficiary of the program. The
exploration and production industry
has little obvious enthusiasm for grant
programs. Companies seem more interested in contributing through scholarships and intern programs. I find it
interesting that several of the very large
integrated companies have a public
position that they are adequately staffed,
whereas my conversations with many
of their employees paint a fairly grim
picture about increased workloads and
employee turnover.
As reported in a recent article,
“Industry Working Together to Address
2007 Faculty Shortage,” 19 PE departments in the US had 42 faculty vacancies.3 The article also expressed concern
about the “threatened cessation” of US
Department of Energy funding for oil
and gas research. The DOE now underwrites as much as 40% of the research
conducted by professors and graduate
students in PE departments.
Many US universities have benefited
from time to time from invaluable
contributions provided by adjunct
professors, many of whom are actively employed in industry but are
willing to contribute their professorial talents one or more days each
week. Sadly, their compensation is not
much more than gasoline money. No
university can effectively create and
effectively manage an undergraduate
program staffed primarily by adjuncts.
However, the students greatly benefit
from those programs and genuinely
seem to appreciate the efforts made by
adjuncts to teach real-life engineering skills. This is only a partial solution because many universities are not
favorably located, meaning close to
metropolitan areas where petroleum
engineers work in the upstream petroleum industry.
Distance learning through video
conferences, internet, and possibly
24

other means may meet the immediate
needs of some companies, departments,
or individuals, but this clearly is not
a long-term solution for the primary
education of petroleum engineering
students.
Most large oil and gas producers
and some of the larger service providers have training regimens for new
engineering hires, but, in general, those
programs are much less intensive than
those of 25 or more years ago. Several
industry professional organizations
are redoubling their efforts to serve
their constituencies and are increasing
their roles in training beyond what the
industry typically provides. Mentoring
is a common practice in many companies, but its effectiveness is reduced if
reduced staff numbers limit the time
between mentor and mentee.
Industry must cultivate a skilled,
young workforce of petroleum engineers to replace the retiring baby
boomers. That requires sowing seeds
for the future by supporting university
PE programs through advisory programs to develop new course curricula.
Industry also should support grant
programs, internships, and adjunct
teaching opportunities through volunteer efforts and financial subsidies. Participation requires breaking a myopic
corporate mindset that demands results
now. Current and future engineering
students will become the lifeblood of
the industry as oil and gas become
harder to find and develop. Industry
support of university PE programs now

will show a high return on investment
in the not-so-distant future. ✦

nvironmentalism has long hindered development of the oil and
gas industry. But now—in a variety
of places around the world—it also
has become the means of taking projects away from their developers and
putting them into altogether different
hands. Consider Kazakhstan, which is
using alleged environmental violations as a threat to revoke the license
of a consortium led by Italy’s Eni SPA
unit Agip to develop the vast offshore
Kashagan field.
Nurlan Isakov, the country’s
environment minister, said the work
of the Agip KCO consortium, which
includes Royal Dutch Shell PLC, ExxonMobil Corp., and ConocoPhillips,
could be stopped because of environmental concerns. His remarks came
as Eni and the Kazakh government
began talks on the project’s future.
Isakiv said if the obligations Agip
has taken upon itself are not complied with, Kazakhstan is by law
obliged to revoke the permit because
further operations will cause even
more ecological damage. Work at
Kashagan may be stopped altogether,
he said.

group in talks over the Kashagan contract. To underscore the consortium’s
determination, Eni Chief Executive
Paolo Scaroni is likely to arrive in Kazakhstan for talks this week. But any
agreement could take months.
One consortium spokesperson said
there should not be any surprises as
KazMunaiGaz, the Kazakh national oil
company, is a member of the consortium. That may be, but there may be
other issues—and other parties—at
play here.

Enter China

Just days before Kazakhstan issued
its warning to the Eni-led consortium, it also signed an agreement to
build pipelines to carry oil and gas
from fields near the Caspian Sea to
China. “The Caspian will be linked to
western China,” Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev said after
a meeting with Chinese leader Hu
Jintao in the Kazakh capital of Astana
on Aug. 18. According to one report,
the agreement marks a setback for
the European Union and the US, both
of which have urged Kazakhstan to
export oil and gas across the Caspian

mitigates major impediments and uncertainties to investment—could result
in several million new barrels per day
of production by 2035, reported the
Task Force on Strategic Unconventional
Fuels.
By contrast, it added, a “base case”
approach, which assumes the current
rate of development, existing laws, processes, and fiscal regimes, would make it
“unlikely that significant investment in,
or production of, unconventional fuels
will occur in the foreseeable future.”
An “accelerated” development approach would require government’s
sharing of considerable investment and
risk with industry “but could perhaps
double the incremental production
achievable in the same timeframe,” it
said.
Primary uncertainties include
access to resources on public lands;
technology performance and efficiency; capital investment and operating
costs; price and market risks; federal
and state fiscal regimes; environmental standards, permitting processes,
and timelines; infrastructure requirements; water requirements and availability; and socioeconomic impacts
of development, the report said. It

Task force’s origin
US Sec. of Energy Samuel W. Bodman established the task force in March
2006 as mandated under the 2005 Energy Policy Act. In addition to Bodman,
it included the US Interior and Defense
secretaries; governors of Colorado,
Wyoming, Utah, Kentucky, and Mississippi; and representatives from three
potentially affected communities. Gov.
Jon Huntsman of Utah and Gov. Ernie
Fletcher of Kentucky transmitted the
initial report of its findings, recommendations, and options to Congress and
the White House on Aug. 13.

800 billion boe could be recoverable,
depending on technology and economics, at around 25 bbl/ton. Production
potentially could exceed 2.5 million
b/d within 30 years, it added.
A strong response to the US Department of the Interior’s 2005 offering of
oil shale research, demonstration, and
development leases on federal lands
“signals that private industry may once
again be ready to aggressively pursue
the potential of the nation’s oil shale
resources,” the report said.
It said US heavy oil resources in
place are estimated at 60-100 billion
bbl, with 2 billion bbl proved reserves
and another 20 billion bbl potentially
recoverable. With current production
using enhanced recovery around
302,000 b/d (increased to 500,000
b/d when other processes are included), the report suggested that another
500,000 b/d of domestic heavy oil
production could be achieved.
About 11 billion bbl of tar sands
appear recoverable from the estimated
54 billion bbl of domestic resources
in place, it said. Most of the deposits,
about 32 billion bbl, are in Utah, with
another 18 billion bbl in Alaska. The
balance are in Alabama, Texas, California, Kentucky, and other states. Unlike
Alberta’s tar sands, those in the US are
often consolidated or cemented and are
“hydrocarbon-wet” instead of “waterwet,” requiring new recovery technology, according to the report.
It said that while oil production
from US tar sands currently is limited
to minor volumes from a few Califor-

nia deposits, output could approach
200,000-300,000 b/d by 2025 with
higher oil prices “and public actions to
encourage projects.”

CO2 enhanced recovery

Carbon dioxide already is being used
domestically in enhanced recovery at
82 projects to produce about 237,000
b/d from the estimated 300 billion bbl
of conventional crude left behind in
US reservoirs after primary and second
production, the report said. Economics,
CO2’s price, and relatively scarce infrastructure to deliver CO2 to candidate
oil fields currently constrain growth, it
continued.
If delivery and other problems
could be overcome, the report said that
another 90-200 CO2 enhanced recovery
projects at $30-50/bbl oil prices could
add 2.7-2.9 billion bbl of reserves and
350,000-400,000 b/d of production
from 2010 to 2030. The projects would
consume 400-600 bcf/year of CO2, it
said.
It estimated that first generation US
coal-to-liquids plants would have capital costs of $70,000-100,000/b/d of
capacity, or $3.5-5 billion for a 50,000
b/d plant. Produced fuels would be
competitive at a $45-60/bbl world
crude oil price, excluding costs for carbon capture and sequestration and tax
credits for other subsidies, the report
said. Plants smaller than 50,000 b/d
would likely cost more, it added.
Most of the task force’s recommendations in the report attempt to
address major unconventional resource

development impediments. It calls on
Congress and the administration to:
• Provide an effective land tenure
system.
• Develop an inclusive regulatory
and permitting system that provides a
predictable schedule.
• Create a fiscal regime to attract
private development capital and a fasttrack technology program to generate
investment.
• Formulate effective and integrated
local infrastructure plans.
• Establish a program to handle local
social and economic impacts (including
consideration of ways to direct mineral
revenues to area communities).
• Develop an effective governmental structure at federal, state, and local
levels.
The group also recommended
international collaborations on unconventional fuels development, including
forming a partnership with Alberta on
oil sands and with other countries on
oil shale. It also called on the federal
government to work with affected states
and communities in creating project
development processes and conducting
initial evaluations of investments which
will be necessary to handle social and
economic impacts.
The task force said that its next step
will be to complete an EPACT-mandated
program plan for commercializing
US unconventional fuels—including
detailed proposed objectives, strategies,
key activities, and timelines—which
will provide the basis for subsequent
program implementation planning. ✦

Chinese NOCs double domestic upstream spending
Upstream spending on oil and gas
operations in China by that country’s
three national oil companies jumped to
$21.5 billion in 2006 from $12.6 billion in 2004, a greater increase than all
of their international spending last year,
including acquisitions.
While industry attention has focused
on increased international activity by
28

China’s NOCs, the domestic expansion of PetroChina, CNOOC Ltd., and
Sinopec is of greater importance in
their competition with international oil
companies, said Wood Mackenzie Ltd.,
Edinburgh, in a recent report. “All three
companies have dramatically increased
their expenditures on domestic exploration and production activities over

the last 5 years to the extent that each
company is now investing at a greater
rate than most of the major IOCs,” said
Norman Valentine, senior corporate
analyst for Wood Mackenzie.
Chinese NOCs’ spending on field development has increased beyond most
of the larger international companies.
“At almost $9.40/boe, PetroChina’s

domestic upstream field development investment rate in
2006 was substantially higher than the average rate of the
international majors at $7.50/boe,” Valentine said. “Sinopec’s
and CNOOC’s domestic investment rates of around $12/boe
were also greater than the average rate of the international
large caps, at $11/boe. In terms of activity, the differences
are probably greater, as China has to some extent been sheltered from the full impact of the recent inflationary environment affecting upstream capital costs due to the lower costs
of domestically sourced labor and materials.”
The increased spending has paid off in several major discoveries by the Chinese companies. “PetroChina’s
multibillion-barrel Nanpu oil and gas field and Sinopec’s
giant Puguang gas discovery significantly strengthen the
companies’ portfolios, which are dominated by established
and maturing producing fields,” Valentine said. “Increased
domestic expenditure has also increased liquid output
from onshore legacy fields. For example, PetroChina has
increased production from enhanced oil recovery projects
in the Daqing field, while Sinopec has halted production
declines from its Shengli area.”
Wood Mackenzie said these discoveries are likely to maintain China’s long-term production levels rather than trigger
much of an increase in current production. However, analysts
said the impact on China’s gas development over the next
5-10 years is potentially more dramatic because of the large
scale of gas reserves in the Sichuan basin and in Nanpu field.
It could mean the NOCs will be more selective in pursuing some of the speculative overseas LNG opportunities
and major international gas import pipeline developments,
instead concentrating on the development of indigenous gas
resources.
“Focusing E&P investment on China in our view provides
the best opportunity for value creation for each of the NOCs.
We expect the companies’ heavy investment to continue until
at least the end of the decade,” Wood Mackenzie reported.
Meanwhile, Chinese NOCs will continue searching out overseas acquisition opportunities as they seek to develop into
larger, more internationally competitive organizations.
Much industry commentary has been devoted to the
increase in overseas expenditure of China’s NOCs, with their
increasing appetite for multibillion-dollar asset acquisitions
drawing much attention. “According to our analysis, total
overseas expenditure by the three companies has indeed
increased substantially over the last 2 years and reached $8
billion in 2005 and 2006,” they said. ✦

Drilling history
Scully Energy’s interest in the southern part of the Fort Worth basin is the
result of two key wells drilled in 1918
and 1949.
The 1918 well, New York Syndicate/
Tienert No. 1, is one of the 1,000plus wildcat tests drilled in an effort to
extend the Ranger Atoka-Bend play to
the south along the southeastern flank
of the Bend arch. Tienert-1 encountered
oil shows in the Marble Falls and Ellenburger formations at 3,400 ft. Records
indicate the “well penetrated a 30 foot
oil bearing zone and showed considerable oil and much gas.” However, the
Tienert-1 well was deemed noncommercial and was plugged.
The 1949 well, Susman/Gotcher No.
1, was drilled to 1,450 ft and penetrated only the upper portion of the Strawn
section.
Records indicate a shut-in gas well
from the Strawn reservoir that tested 2
MMcfd of gas. The well was eventually

Strawn sediments in the Fort Worth
basin were derived from the rising forelands of the Ouachita fold belt.
The Llano uplift occurred during
Pennsylvanian time and is also associated with the Ouachita orogeny (Fig.
3). The Llano uplift is ovate in shape
and is structurally complex with numerous faulting and structural folding
or arches that developed in a radial pattern around the uplift. It is along these
arches where major oil and gas fields
have been discovered, such as Ranger
field and subsequently TOGA field.

Three major delta systems dominated Strawn deposition in the Fort Worth
basin (Fig. 4).4
Depositional thickness of the Strawn
sediments ranges from 4,500 ft in the
north part of the basin to 1,500 ft in
the southern part of the basin. The
Eastland Delta system filled the south
Fort Worth basin and is associated with
numerous oil and gas fields, including
TOGA field.
The westerly prograding Eastland
Delta system deposited Strawn sediment
from the rising Ouachita fold belt into
the Fort Worth basin. The orogeny of
the Llano uplift and subsequent Lampasas arch were contemporaneous with
Strawn deposition and controlled the
accumulation of the sediments.
The Strawn sediments were funneled
and deposited along the north flank of
the Lampasas arch (Figs. 5 and 6). Surface geology2 corroborates the depositional direction from the Ouachita fold
belt. The Llano uplift acted as a barrier
to the southwest where the Strawn sediment thins appreciably.

Strawn stratigraphy
three structural features are important
components to the development of the
TOGA field reservoir and trap.
The Fort Worth basin is classified as a

Drilling costs can be
estimated with a combination of established,
analytic techniques. This
article, concluding a
three-part series, presents
Drilling
a general framework to
estimate costs with a
formalized systems perspective.
This framework combines regression-based techniques, as employed in
the joint association survey, with the
multidimensional attributes of drilling, as incorporated in the mechanical
risk index (MRI), directional difficulty
(DDI), and difficulty index (DI) models
(OGJ, Aug. 6, 2007, p. 39; Aug. 13,
2007, p. 46). A generalized methodology to frame the drilling cost estimation problem is presented and illustrated with an example from the Gulf of
Mexico.

Drilling objectives
The objective in drilling a hydrocarbon well is to make hole as quickly as
possible subject to the technological,
operational, quality, and safety constraints associated with the process.
These objectives are frequently conflicting and depend on factors that interrelate; vary with respect to time, location,
and personnel; and are subject to significant private and market uncertainty.
Drill rates are often constrained by
factors that the driller does not control and in ways that cannot be documented. In many situations, the causes
of dysfunction are complex, occurring
simultaneously, where effective solutions have not been developed.
Evaluation of drilling performance
commands a high degree of visibility
across oil and gas companies, and over
the past few decades, various methods
have been proposed to evaluate drilling cost and complexity. Understanding
the drilling process requires isolating
the factors of drilling and quantifying
their interaction.1-4 There is no way
to identify all of the characteristics of

drilling that might be important, but
we can observe many characteristics,
and in practice it is usually sufficient to
consider a set of factors that adequately
represent the technical aspects of drilling conditions.
Well characteristics are measured
directly, while operator experience and
wellbore quality frequently need to be
represented by other variables. Many
unobservable
factors also affect drilling performance, such
as well planning
and preparation,
project management skills,
communication and training,5-10 but
these variables are usually outside the
scope of analysis.
The premise of a systems approach
to cost estimation is that process
characteristics from several wells will
allow the factors that influence drilling
cost to be discovered. We first outline
the drilling performance benchmarks
and estimation techniques common in
industry. Main factors that characterize
the drilling process are then defined.
The generalized functional approach is
specified and calibrated, and an example is used to illustrate the procedure.

Two methods are commonly used to
benchmark drilling performance.
The first method is based on experimental design and controlled field studies. Typically, one or more parameters
of the drilling process are varied and
the impact of the variable(s) on output

(ROP) or cost/ft (CPF) examined.
The second method to study factor
effects is based on an aggregate assessment of well data. In this method, data
that characterize a set of wells are collected, and relationships are established
between the variables based on empirical modeling techniques.

ous factors of drilling and the cost and
complexity of the well bore. In this
approach, wells drilled under a wide
variety of conditions provide the raw
data to explore the manner in which
factors contribute to drilling cost.
In the Gulf of Mexico, the joint association survey (JAS) and the mechanical risk index (MRI) are popular
methods used to evaluate drilling cost
and complexity. The JAS estimates drilling cost using survey data and quadratic
regression models constructed from
four descriptor variables. The MRI is
a risk index that employs six primary
variables and 14 qualitative indicators
to characterize wellbore complexity. For
additional details on these metrics, see

Factors
There are many factors and events
that affect the time and cost to drill a
well. Measurable factors include the
physical characteristics of the well,
geology, and drill parameters; indirect
characteristics, such as operator experience and wellbore quality, are represented through other variables.
Factors such as well planning and
execution, team communication, leadership, and project management skills
will also affect drilling performance but
are often considered beyond the scope
of analysis.
Associated with every well w is a
vector of dependent variables, φ(w),
and a matrix of observations of independent variables, X(w). The matrix
of observations is used to explain the
dependent variables and is selected
based on the underlying engineering
and mechanical processes associated
with drilling, the choice of dependent
variable, data availability, and the level
of classification.
There is no way to identify all the
relevant characteristics of drilling, but
we can identify many factors, and in
practice it is only necessary to identify
the set of factors that describe the primary elements of the process.

Well characteristics
A wellbore is a three-dimensional
tubular structure that is described in
geometric terms with respect to the

length, diameter, and curvature of the
hole’s trajectory. The drilled interval
(DI) is the difference between the total
depth (TD) and the spud depth (SD),
DI = TD – SD, while the vertical interval
(VI) is the difference between the vertical depth (VD) and spud depth, VI =
VD – SD. The spud depth is the distance
from the rotary table to the seabed.
A well consists of segments of casing
string Si oriented at the angle A(Si) relative to a reference coordinate system.
The maximum angle of the wellbore
is computed as MA = max A(Si). If
i
MA ≥ 85°, the well is categorized as
a horizontal well under the indicator
variable HW: HW = {1, MA ≥ 85°; 0,
otherwise}. If L(Si) denotes the length
of well section Si, then the total length
of the horizontal section of a well is
denoted as HL, Equation 1.
Each casing section has a diameter
Di = D(Si) and radius Ri = R(Si), and
length Li = L(Si) measured from the
rotary table. If k = NS represents the
number of strings associated with the
well, then a well is characterized by the
vectors D = (D1, D2, ..., Dk) and L = (L1,
L2, ..., Lk). The incremental well casing
length is denoted by L* = (L1*, L2*, ...,
Lk*), where Li* = Li – Li-1, for i = 1, ...,
k, and L0* = 0.
Operators generally prefer the
production casing to be as large as
possible to maximize production, but
large production casing requires a
large wellbore, which is typically more
complicated and expensive to drill.
Average hole size and volume removed
characterize the geometry of the final
drilled well. The average hole size (HS)
of the wellbore is determined by the
weighted average diameter of the casing
string, Equation 2, while the volume of
rock removed (VR) without washout is
defined by Equation 3.

Well complexity
Complex wells arise from diverse
factors, including the nature of the
geologic formation, depth of the target,
size of the reservoir sands, trajectory of
the wellbore, experience of the contractor, and technology applied. Well

complexity is difficult to quantify and
frequently ambiguous because practices, opinions, and experiences among
drilling contractors vary so dramatically.
High-pressure/high-temperature
(HP/ HT) wells must be planned and
drilled with significantly less formation
data than shallower and cooler wells.
If the formation pressure (FP) exceeds
10,000 psi or temperature (T) exceeds
300° F. anywhere along the wellbore,
then a binary indicator will classify the
well as complex (Equation 4).
The ratio of the horizontal length to
the total footage drilled describes the
percentage of the well’s footage drilled
under horizontal conditions, Equation
5. The aspect ratio, AR (Equation 6),
measures the aggregate curvature of the
well trajectory, and the extended reach
ratio, ER, is the ratio of total depth to
total vertical depth, Equation 7. All of
these metrics provide, with some degree of correlation, alternate measures
of well complexity.

Other drilling problems include
stuck pipe, sloughing shale, lost mud
circulation, formation damage, embrittlement, and abnormal pressure.
Rig equipment failure, lost circulation,
weather, and stuck pipe are the main
causes of trouble time in the Gulf of
Mexico.

GENERALIZED FUNCTIONAL MODEL METHODOLOGY
Step 1.
Step 2.

The time to drill a well is described
by the number of the dry-hole days,
DHD, defined as the number of days
from the spud date to final well depth,
plus any time spent batch setting, preinstalling or pre-setting casings. Dryhole days normally includes time for all
operations essential to well construction, such as tripping, running casing,
and cementing (known as “flat time”),
as well as interrupt and weather time
and time spent on sidetracking. Time
spent coring, logging, or other evaluation techniques are excluded.
Total number of days from the
rig arrival on location until the rig is
released is the total site days, TWD. This
time includes the time for mooring and
demooring, where applicable, completion and testing, suspension and plug
and abandonment activities. Normal
dry-hole days is DHD excluding all
nonproductive time such as freeing
stuck pipe, repairing equipment, and
WOW.
The cost of operations during the
dry-hole day period plus the casing
batch set, preset period is denoted DHC.
The definition of DHC will vary with
each operator but will normally include
the cost of operations, plus overhead,
base operations, incentive payments,
logging, transport, materials supply,
marine vessel support, marine supply
base, port facility, and warehousing.
The cost of wellheads and technical and
mechanical sidetracks are also normally
included.

wells, the correspondence is expected
to be weaker.
The sign of the horizontal displacement, aspect ratio, and extended reach
ratio is uncertain. The aspect ratio and
extended-reach ratio describe the geometry of the wellbore trajectory, and
because they are strongly correlated,
only one of the variables needs to be
included in the regression model.
The coefficient of the final bit size
is expected to be positive because a
large wellbore should take more time
to drill and cost more than a small
wellbore. The number of casing strings
directly indicates the complexity of the
well; and the maximum mud weight
positively correlates with the pressure
profile. Increasing the number of casing
strings or applying greater mud weight
is expected to be associated with slower
drilling time and greater costs.

Condensate production, especially in
the Middle East, will rise substantially
in the next few years. Some concerns
about the effect of increased production on the marketability and prices of
condensate have led producers to consider investing in condensate processing
capacity as an alternative to being at the
mercy of the condensate market.

Deﬁnitions

natural gasoline-type condensates that
are frequently recovered from gas-processing operations.
To assist the definition, Fig. 1 shows
a typical gas production and processing
chain.
The definition of condensate became
highly political within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
because condensates do not fall within
OPEC quotas. In 1998 OPEC agreed, for
quota purposes, that 50° API was the
break point between light crude oils
and condensates.
Most condensates are used as refinery feedstocks for the manufacture of
products for the fuels markets. Some
condensates, however, particularly
paraffinic condensates (those with high
paraffin content), are suitable as feedstocks for the manufacture of ethylene.
Paraffinic condensates used in this way
compete with naphtha for this end-use
market.

many use to describe a variety of light

could be exported.
Commingling into crude oil is
generally the favored option where possible. Most North Sea crude is handled
this way. Condensate may enhance
the value and marketability of a crude
stream, although with limits.
If condensate addition results in a
crude that becomes difficult to process because its yields of light ends or
naphtha are too high or its yields of
fuel oil are too low, then condensate
addition can depress the value of the
crude. If crude value is plotted vs. API,
value tends to increase with increasing API, but this trend can reverse for
crudes with API gravities in the mid and
higher 40s.
Processing a condensate by simply
splitting it, or splitting and treatment or
other processing of the derived products, can be attractive in some circumstances. Certainly it limits condensate
supply and produces products that
can be sold into deep and established
markets.
Finally, the condensate can be
exported without any processing and
treatment.

Our outlook is for global condensate
production to rise strongly, primarily
due to increasing gas production. The
Middle East is expected to account for
more than half of this increase (Fig. 3).
Considerable uncertainties surround
this outlook. In particular, major uncertainty relates to the future development

Currently segregated condensate
production accounts for about 3% of
total refining industry feed on a global
basis. Most of the remainder is crude.
During 2005-20, segregated condensate production will increase to about
4.7 million b/d from about 2.1 million b/d, but this increase
will still leave condensate as

Because condensate is a
relatively small proportion of

no doubt that condensate

the market without undue
difficulty. This is not to say,
however, that this increase
could not have pricing implications.
To a considerable degree,
Middle East condensate

buyers that preferred to have some

feedstock slate is technically impossible.
Condensates include too much light
material and too little heavy fuel oil.
This overloads the overheads systems
and inadequate heat input results.
Typically, therefore, condensates must
be coprocessed with crudes, with the
condensate 10-20% of feed.
This means that condensate must be
segregated and injected into a refinery
feed stream on a ratable basis. This can
tie up refinery tankage and reduce operating flexibility.
For a refiner without a specific desire
to boost naphtha yields, this is typically
an inconvenience that requires some

incentive. The incentive is a market discount relative to refining value for the
condensate.
An historical analysis shows that
refiners in Asia interested in processing
feedstocks with high naphtha yields
typically processed Middle East condensates. These refiners are favorably
inclined towards processing condensate and are willing to pay full refining
value. When condensate production
increases, it becomes necessary to market condensate to refiners without such
interests. Market discounts are therefore
likely to appear. With limited production, discounts are nonexistant or mi-

nor; these would deepen if production
increased substantially.
Deep discounts are not sustainable. They would encourage refiners to
invest in additional flexibility to process
condensate and would also encourage condensate producers to invest in
condensate processing facilities of their
own. Long-term discounts are therefore
expected but will not be severe.
The naphtha market also affects the
pricing of condensates and specifically
the extent to which a market discount
will apply at any point in time. When
the naphtha market is strong and naphtha buyers are concerned about supply security, condensate demand will
increase and market discounts, if any,
will decline.
The outlook for the naphtha market is also therefore important to the
outlook for condensate markets. Asia is
a huge importer of naphtha because its
olefin business is largely naphtha-based,
although the use of LPG feedstock is
likely to increase.
Little distillate is used as olefin cracker feedstock in Asia. Naphtha accounts
for about 80% of Asian ethylene cracker
feed and Asia accounts for almost half
of total global light naphtha demand.
It is interesting to track the yield of
naphtha from Asian refineries. Fig. 7
shows that this is approaching a level
that represents the technical maximum
yield of naphtha from the region’s
refineries.
Demand for naphtha in Asia will
continue to rise and refinery production will increase much more slowly;
Asia naphtha imports will therefore
surge during the next few years. During
2006-08, regional naphtha supply deficit will rise to 47 million tonnes from
29 million tonnes.
This will result in a firm short-term
market for naphtha, and consequently
good demand for condensate. In the
slightly longer term, the market will
ease due to increasing Middle East
naphtha and condensate production and
increased use of LPG feedstock in the
Asian olefin cracking industry.
Clearly, these trends will have an

Future considerations
It is difficult to generalize about the
attractiveness of condensate processing
as a producer option. Location and the
existence of local demand for products

important bearing on the economics
of condensate processing investments.
In the longer term, increasing condensate production will result in discounts
relative to refining values, though not
unduly deep discounts.
In the short term, firm naphtha and
condensate markets are more likely;
however, the factor not yet discussed is
location. A location with local demand
for products from a condensate processing operation will have a strong
economic advantage compared with
a location where most, if not all, of
the products must be exported. This
is simply a result of tanker transportation economics, which can result in
FOB prices for exports of $20/tonne or
more below the price at which product
can be imported. (FOB: free-on-board;
buyer pays freight and insurance costs.)
The most favorable circumstances
for a condensate processing operation
are for a location that has local condensate available (FOB pricing) and a
local deficit in terms of product supply.
A location that has the opposite situation will find it difficult to cover cash
operating costs.
An extension of this analysis suggests that condensate processing should
always occur in a product-importing location rather than a product-exporting
location. Typically, condensate from the
Middle East is transported to markets in
Asia as part cargoes on very-large crude
carriers (VLCCs), whereas products
from refining and condensate processing operations are typically transported
in smaller ships, normally long-range
(LR-1; Panamax) and medium-range
tankers.
In 2006, for example, transportation
in a VLCC was cheaper than transportation in an LR-1 by as much as $1.50/
bbl and cheaper than transportation in
a medium-range tanker by as much as
$2/bbl.

are important. Timing is also important—general levels of refining margins,
which will affect condensate refining
or processing margins, also vary with
time, as do condensate market discounts
and processing facility investment costs.
Investment costs are currently
extremely high as a result of supply
tightness for construction materials,
equipment, and engineering and construction services.
A condensate producer may find
local processing strategically desirable,
particularly where it is important to
guarantee the offtake of condensate. Although marketing condensate is not unduly difficult, selling finished products
into deep, liquid product markets will
be easier. In any case, a careful evaluation of project economics is clearly
essential.
Finally, a conundrum related to condensate discounts must be recognized.
If all produced condensate is sold into
the market, discounts will occur at a
certain level. If producers instead invest
in a certain amount of condensateprocessing capacity, discounts for the
remaining condensate will be reduced.
The resulting smaller discounts would
then result in reduced returns on the
investments made.
The optimum solution may be to encourage others to invest in condensate
processing capacity, then to continue to

sell condensate at close to its full refining value. ✦

S AMPLE COLLECTION LOCATIONS

Pauley defines
foaming as “a result of a mechaniSour feed gas
cal incorporation
of a gas into a
liquid, where the
liquid film surrounds a volume
of gas creating a
bubble.”2 Two key
characteristics are
needed to present
a foaming concern:
1. Solution tendency to foam—the
ease with which a solution forms a
foam bubble.
2. Foam stability—foam resistance
to break into continuous liquid phase.
The higher the foam tendency and
stability, the higher the possibility of a
foaming problem.
Surface tension is the primary
indication of foaming tendency. Lower
surface tension leads to more solution
susceptibility to foam. The major source
of reduced surface tension of an amine
solution is solution contamination with
surface-active agents, which include
liquid hydrocarbons.
Surface tension is also affected by
operating conditions; higher temperature and pressure tend to reduce surface
tension. Temperature has the upper
hand in impacting surface tension of an
aqueous amine solution.
Higher pressure, to a lesser extent,
affects solution-foaming tendency. At
higher pressures, the solubility of liquid
hydrocarbons in the amine solution
increases, thereby changing the surface
structure of the aqueous solution and
rendering a lower surface tension and
hence increased system tendency to
foam.3
That is exactly what has been observed in Saudi Aramco’s gas processing facilities where most of the current
foaming concerns are in the amine
plants that are operating at high pressures. Having a low surface tension does
not indicate a stable foam and hence a

products. Here are the most common
causes of foaming:5-8
1. Liquid hydrocarbon introduced
by sour feed gas is the primary cause
of foaming problems in gas-sweetening plants. Liquids can be introduced
as mist entrainment or carryover or can
be formed inside the column if the lean
amine entering the column is cooler
than the sour-gas dewpoint.
The impact of liquid hydrocarbon
comes from its solubility in the aqueous amine solution, which therefore
reduces its surface tension. Secondary
and tertiary amines, more than primary
amines, tend to foam in the presence of
liquid hydrocarbons due to the higher
solubility of liquid hydrocarbon in
secondary and tertiary amines.
One of the tasks is the removal of
liquid hydrocarbon droplets of aerosol
size. Droplet sizes greater than 3μ are
generally controllable; smaller sizes
require careful filter-separator and coalescer design. Some plants were able to
reduce the liquid carryover by installing
0.3μ coalescers upstream of the amine
absorber columns.9
2. Solid particulate contamination,
especially iron sulfide, is one of the
major causes of foaming. Iron sulfides,

foaming problem.
Stability, related to the nature of the
surface layer, is the other key factor of
having a foaming concern. Foam stability depends on three characteristics:
elasticity, gelatinous layer formation,
and film drainage.4
• Having higher elasticity, and therefore resistance to thinning, generates
lower foaming stability. The major function of most antifoam is to increase the
solution elasticity and hence reduce the
foam stability.
• Gelatinous or plastic layer is a
surface structure related to the nature of
molecular composition of the aqueous solution; solutions that are prone
to form gelatinous layers tend to have
higher foaming stability.4 Secondary
(DEA) and tertiary (MDEA) amines
form this layer more easily than primary (MEA and DGA) amines. They are,
therefore, more susceptible to foam.
Contaminants, such as amine degradation products, induce the formation of
the gelatinous layer.
• Faster film drainage reduces foam
stability. Fine particulates, however, such
as iron sulfide, tend to retard film drainage and hence increase foam stability.

such reasons as high solution acid-gas
loading, high velocities, and formation
of acidic degradation products.
3. Water-soluble surfactants such
as corrosion inhibitors, well-treating
compounds, and excessive antifoam
agent tend to dissolve in aqueous solutions and reduce surface tension. Such
contaminants are often much more
problematic than liquid hydrocarbons,
if an appreciable amount exists in the
sour gas, due to their higher solubility
in amine solution.

foaming stability and tendency, respectively.
Because heat-stable salts are not thermally regenerable, they accumulate in
and contaminate the circulating amine
solution. Such heavy salts are products
of amine reaction with other anionic
species or stronger acidic components
(other than H2S and CO2) present in the
sour feed gas.
6. Oxygen ingress in the feed or
amine solution, even at parts-per-million levels, leads to the formation of
carboxylic acids that react with amine
to form heat-stable salts and hence
increases the system’s tendency to foam.
Positive pressure is always required to
avoid any accidental oxygen leakage to
the system. One area that needs to be
monitored is the amine storage tank
that should normally be protected by an
inert-gas blanket, usually of nitrogen.
7. Makeup water could be another
source of introducing various contaminants to the system. The main source
of the makeup water is the utility plant
where various chemical additives are
introduced to treat it before it is fed
to the steam boilers. Such chemicals
include corrosion inhibitors and boilerfeed-water chemicals. Demineralized
water could provide a very safe source
of makeup.

speculated that hydrocarbons were in an
appreciable amount due to the amine

activated-carbon beds.
Existing filtration consists of precoat
filter (1μ rating) and a mechanical cotton-fiber filter (5μ rating) designed to
process 10% of the circulating amine

Therefore, it was decided to stop the
continuous antifoam injection practice.
It was found that the most cost-effective method to abate foaming is to
have better coordination between the
upstream facilities and the gas processing plant. Producing facilities should
alarm the gas plant to take the proper
action whenever upsets occur in any of
the following systems: gas refrigeration,
gas dehydration, and gas compression.
Implementing this practice will allow gas-treatment operations personnel
to inject antifoam (batch) to the amine
solution and closely monitor plant
operation. In addition, added benefits
could be attained by installing a gapaction control valve in the slug catcher
liquid drainage system to prevent high
liquid build up.
Effective troubleshooting of foaming is vital in achieving a resolution to
amine foaming. Operations engineers
should be aware of several things in order to do an effective trouble shooting:
• Understand the foaming concept,
symptoms, and potential causes.
• Check amine quality and treatment methods that include filtration or
reclamation.
• Examine sour-gas quality and pretreatment equipment.
• Review operational practices of the
amine sweetening plant.
• Respond proactively to the activities in upstream facilities that have the
potential to cause problems in the
amine system. ✦

Ghana also must finalize commercial

and clean alternative to current fuels,
especially for power generation and industrial purposes. The ability to absorb
foundation volumes when the pipeline
starts operating is important in keeping
down the cost of natural gas for all users. No incentives, however, are necessary to induce industrial users in Tema
and Takoradi to switch to natural gas
from oil products, so long as oil prices
stay greater than $30/bbl.
In addition to the typical industrial uses of generating heat or steam,
natural gas also opens up the possibility
of economically competitive cogeneration of electricity, helping Ghana meet
its electrification goals more quickly,
reliably, and cheaply. Reduced demand
for oil products will also help equalize
Ghana’s trade balance, as payments for
oil imports go down, and, in the longrun, may even help Ghana become an
exporter of oil products if its refining
capacity is expanded.
This article examines the factors affecting natural gas’ large-scale introduction to the Ghanian energy market both
in preparation for and upon WAGP’s
entering service.

Background
Natural gas is to start flowing from
Nigeria through WAGP to Benin, Togo,
and Ghana later this year. Ghana will
buy 75% of the line’s 134 MMcfd
start-up volume and initially use the gas
primarily as feedstock for the Takoradi
thermal power plant in the country’s
western region (Fig. 1). The 550-Mw
plant will provide a foundation market
for Nigerian gas in the region. Initial demand from the plant will total
100-110 MMcfd, enough to generate 5
Tw-hr of electricity at 85% utilization.
Plans call for the plant to be upgraded
to 660 Mw.
Other industries in Tema and Takoradi, Ghana, are early candidates for
switching to natural gas from oil products. As elsewhere in the world, natural
gas provides a fuel that is cleaner, more
efficient, and more stable in pricing
than oil products, allowing its use not
only for typical industrial purposes but

times, when the electricity from the
grid is reliable, industry might use no
natural gas at all for power generation.
This fluctuation in load may cause
problems for the natural gas distribution company. Demand for storage
could emerge, increasing the cost of
gas. Industrial facilities could also retrofit their backup systems to be able to
switch between diesel and natural gas,
depending on the relative costs of each.
The best long-term option for
industry, however, may be ongoing
natural gas-fueled self-generation, or
cogeneration, which would allow it to
take advantage of cleaner, more efficient
gas turbines for power while meeting
heat and steam needs at the same time.
Excess power could be sold back to the
national grid, once Ghana fully implements electricity unbundling, easing the
urgency of expanding generation capacity in the rest of the country.

Transportation
A city like Accra would need at least
5-10 CNG filling stations to make CNGfuelled vehicles practical. Regulated
vehicle conversion shops would also be
needed.
The cost of 5-10 filling stations
would total $5-10 million. Placing
these stations efficiently along the roads
would require expansion of the gas
pipeline network as well, increasing
initial investment and hence the cost of
natural gas to everyone.
Private investors are unlikely to take
such risks in the absence of a CNG fleet.
Even assuming low-cost gas ($3-3.5/

MMbtu) and high-cost oil ($50+/bbl),
it would take 3-4 years for individuals
to recover the cost of converting their
vehicles to CNG.
Per capita income in Ghana ranges
$450-600. The average Ghanian citizen
is therefore unlikely to spend the $700
or more required to make the CNG
conversion. Even those who can afford
it would have to find the surrounding
infrastructure convenient enough to
make the change worthwhile. The likelihood of any large increase in demand
for natural gas from the transportation
sector is therefore low.

Secondary system
Addressing the demand potential
described in this article requires timely
development of pipeline systems in
Tema and Takoradi and a low final cost
of delivered gas to industrial users.
Given the compactness of the distribution areas and proximity of most major
potential customers, the local pipeline
systems would be fairly short, consisting of a main trunk linking WAGP to a
larger diameter backbone pipeline and
smaller laterals feeding end users.
Major customers in the Tema and Takoradi areas would require two pipeline
networks of roughly 20-25 km each in
the early stages. These systems would be
fairly quick and inexpensive to build.
A discounted cash flow model using
sensitivity analyses can calculate the
per-unit cost impact of building distribution systems in Tema and Takoradi.

Economic assumptions
A system including all necessary
pipelines to take natural gas from WAGP
and deliver it to customers will most
likely include a combination of steel
and plastic pipes. Steel pipelines of 8-in.
OD and greater are most appropriate for
the section taking the gas from WAGP
and bringing it to the service area, since
the volumes will be relatively large and
pressure will be high.
High-density polyethylene pipe of
4-6 in. OD will be most appropriate
for laterals because it is far cheaper and
easier and faster to lay. HDPE pipes have
Oil & Gas Journal / Aug. 27, 2007

proven effective and durable for pressures less than 100 psi.
Steel pipes cost about $25,000/OD
in./km. Value-added tax (12.5%),
import duty (~10%) and port handling
and haulage fees (~3.5%) will increase
this cost by roughly 26%, to $31,500.
HDPE pipes cost about $3,100 and
$4,200/OD in./km for 4 and 6-in. OD
pipes, respectively. Including various
taxes and fees, the total imported cost
per inch becomes $4,000 and $5,300
for 4 and 6-in. pipelines, respectively.
The local distribution companies that
this article assumes will be licensed to
operate the Tema and Takoradi franchises will most likely generate revenues
through charging tariffs to carry natural
gas in their distribution networks to
end users, rather than through sale of
gas itself. The LDCs’ revenues will therefore depend heavily on the volume of
gas they distribute.
A discounted cash flow model
yields an optimum return on distribution tariff of 15% for each LDC. LDCs
around the world are typically regulated
and return 8-12%; but a higher rate in
Ghana will make investment in these
small systems attractive.
Several scenarios of various pipeline
OD and lengths yielded a distribution
tariff of similar magnitude. Only a summary of the results follows.
The base assumption for Tema
includes a 22-km pipeline network
consisting of 15 km of 6-in. HDPE pipe
and 7 km of 12-in. steel pipe. The base
assumption for Takoradi includes a 20km pipeline network consisting of 5 km
of 12-in. steel pipe and 15 km of 6-in.
HDPE pipe.
These assumptions yield total costs
of almost $2.4 million for Takoradi and
$3.1 million for Tema. The estimate for
Takoradi, however, does not include the
cost of extending WAGP from the power
plant to downtown Takoradi, about 15
km away. Building the additional 12-in.
steel pipeline could double or even
triple distribution tariffs unless demand
for gas in Takoradi is much larger than
initial estimates of 4-7 MMcfd.
Both networks can be constructed

Worldwide, well over 50% of all pipelines use
coatings which shield (block) cathodic
protection currents if disbondment occurs.
Even the best corrosion coatings develop
disbonded areas over time. Solid film backed
polymeric coatings (shrink sleeves, tapes, and
multilayer systems) can perform well as
coatings, but when they disbond, they are
proven to prevent your cathodic protection
system from working.
Cathodic shielding is a serious problem and a
documented problem. Since the late 80’s there
is a large body of published research on
shielding. Much of this research can be seen on
our website.
Corrosion coatings which permit the passage
of cathodic protection currents to water under
disbonded areas are called “fail/safe” coatings.
In other words, if the coating fails, your
cathodic protection current can keep your
pipeline safe.
Two types of corrosion coatings are proven to
allow the passage of protective CP currents.
One of these proven “fail/safe” coatings is FBE.
The other proven “fail/safe” corrosion coating
is Polyguard RD-6. We have sold RD-6 since
1988, so there are thousands of installations.
We know of no project where serious
corrosion or SCC has been found under the
rarely seen disbonded areas of RD-6.

specifications with our corrosion expert,

12-in. pipelines, as opposed to 4-in.
HDPE and 8-in. steel pipes, will lead to
pipeline capacities that may not initially
be supported by the market, increasing
the capital cost of the infrastructure and
leading to a higher distribution tariff
for the same target rate of return of
15%.
Oversizing the pipelines makes sense
on both engineering grounds and an
optimistic view of future demand. Increasing size only adds incrementally to
cost, as most other variables (rights of
way, labor, equipment, etc.) are already
covered, and adds the ability to accommodate future increases in load.
Calculating an upper limit for the
distribution tariff is also desirable. If
natural gas is competitive at this upper limit, it will also be competitive at
lower cost. A 15% return requirement
also helps establish this upper limit.
Tema network calculations assume
initial natural gas delivery rates of 7
MMcfd, increasing 5%/year. The growth
rate equals Ghana’s industrial growth
rate since 2000.
Takoradi system calculations assume
initial natural gas delivery rates of 4
MMcfd in 2007 and the same annual
growth rate. These assumptions are
fairly conservative, given initial demand
estimates of 18-26 MMcfd. This analysis
uses lower demand values to help establish the upper limits of the distribution
tariff, so that improvements in switching and penetration rates will lead to
declines in the tariff and make natural
gas more attractive.
This analysis also calculates the cost
incurred by new users of natural gas in
installing or retrofitting the necessary
equipment (burners, boilers, furnaces,
etc.). Uniform average annualized cost

March 3 – 5, 2008 / Moody Gardens Hotel & Convention Center, Galveston, Texas

SUBSEA TIEBACK
Forum & Exhibition

PennWell invites you back to the 8th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition.
SSTB has become the premier event for one of the fastest growing field
development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March 3 – 5, 2008 in
Galveston, TX at the Moody Gardens Hotel & Conference Center. Over 2,000
people and 150 exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference.You can’t
afford to miss it.
As our industry confronts new challenges, it has never been more important
to submerse yourself in them. This year’s theme is “Subsea is here, the game
is changing.” As our game changes, the sharing of knowledge and collective
experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety,
and economics of the subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by
industry leaders. As in the past, only by participating in this conference will you
be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will not be published and no
Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room
stays inside the conference room. We hope you will join us.

From the Subscribers Only area of

Chavez wrong
on price path,
cutoff threat
Hugo Chavez says the darnedest things.
At a meeting of Caribbean government
leaders in Caracas Aug. 11, the Venezuelan
president ﬁrst observed that oil prices “are
headed straight to $100/bbl.” Then he repeated a threat to cut oil supplies to the US.
He’s wrong on both counts.
The day before he spoke, the spot
price of Brent crude was $69.57/bbl, nearly
$10/bbl below its peak of the prior month

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

and more than $5/bbl below its level of
the same time a year earlier. This is not the
trajectory Chavez described.
Someday, the crude price might reach
$100/bbl. But to say it’s “headed straight”
to triple digits is incorrect.
It’s also untrue that Venezuela will cut oil
ﬂow to the US.
For starters, the condition Chavez speciﬁed—“if they attack us again like they did in
April of 2002”—won’t materialize.
The US didn’t attack Venezuela in 2002.
Yes, discerning Americans cheered that
year’s coup attempt against Chavez, which,
alas, ultimately failed. But attack? Please.
And the US wouldn’t attack a country just
for having a president given to shrill utterance.
What’s more, cutting oil sales would further squeeze a state oil company on which
Venezuela’s economy depends. Petroleos
de Venezuela, increasingly forced to sell
oil cheap to satisfy presidential promises,
would have to ﬁnd new buyers for heavy
crude. And its Citgo subsidiary would have
to scramble for alternative feedstock for its
reﬁneries on the US Gulf Coast.
While PDVSA and crude buyers in the
US could adjust to a Chavez cutoff, PDVSA
would have the harder time of it. Venezuela
needs US sales more than the US needs
Venezuelan oil.
In fact, the Venezuelan need for oil
sales to nearby buyers paying full price
grows with each soft deal Chavez makes
to ingratiate a neighboring government.
His audience for the $100/bbl forecast, for
example, was in Caracas for a meeting of
Petrocaribe, the group of nations to which
Venezuela supplies oil under conciliatory
credit terms.
High oil prices paint over serious corrosion at work in the Venezuelan oil industry.
As damage spreads, it’s perversely amusing to wonder what darned thing its cause
will say next.

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

It’s just Erin and Dean, not Katrina and Rita
On Aug. 19 as Dean, the ﬁrst hurricane of the 2007 season, pounded Jamaica’s
south coast, residents of Houston some 1,427 miles away were emptying grocery
shelves of bread, bottled water, and other essentials on the remote chance that the
storm might come ashore in their vicinity.
E-mails were circulating in the city warning recipients to “ﬁll up your car tanks
and keep them topped off” because gasoline prices might spike to $6/gal if Dean hit
the Texas Gulf Coast. A run on gasoline in the country’s fourth-largest urban area just
2 weeks before the long Labor Day weekend that historically marks the end of the
summer driving season could do more to drive up gasoline prices than some distant
storm.
Meanwhile, most computer weather models showed Dean, then a Category 4 hurricane, would hit Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula Aug. 21. Most forecasters expected it to
make landfall in north-central Mexico on Aug. 22. However, government ofﬁcials in
Texas and Louisiana were preparing in case Dean turned north.
Ofﬁcials in Cameron County, Tex., were urging residents to evacuate “out of the
kill zone” ahead of the storm. State ofﬁcials gathered 1,300 school and commercial
buses in San Antonio, as Texas Gov. Rick Perry activated a plan to evacuate elderly
and special-needs residents from the Rio Grande Valley if Dean veered northward.
The Texas National Guard already had deployed water rescue teams along the
coast before Tropical Storm Erin—downgraded to a tropical depression—made
landfall Aug. 16, 25 miles northeast of Corpus Christi. A ﬂashﬂood watch was issued
for 33 Texas counties through Aug. 17 as that storm dumped 4-10 in. of rain along a
corridor between San Antonio and Austin. Remnants of Erin poured 7 in. of rain on
parts of Houston, causing some ﬂooding and triggering 70 high-water rescues.
David Paulison, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, activated that agency’s hurricane-response plan, with disaster teams set in San Antonio
and more standing by. FEMA and Louisiana ofﬁcials were sharply criticized for the
haphazard initial government response to Hurricane Katrina, which ﬂooded New
Orleans in August 2005. Determined to avoid such condemnation when Hurricane
Rita threatened the Texas Coast in September 2005, state and local ofﬁcials triggered
a massive evacuation that produced gridlock on Houston area freeways; people were
stranded in summer heat with no water, no food, and no gasoline as the hurricane
came ashore more than 100 miles to the east, leaving Houston untouched.
Industry planning
Meanwhile, oil and gas companies have stuck to their long-proven strategy of
evaluating risks before reacting to storms. As Erin approached Texas, Shell Oil Co.
evacuated 188 workers from offshore facilities and shut in 5 MMcfd of natural gas
production from the North Padre Island 927 ﬁeld. Valero Energy Corp.’s 340,000 b/d
reﬁnery in Corpus Christi continued operations “as planned,” with no disruption.
On Aug. 20, the US Minerals Management Service said personnel were evacuated
from 10 of the 834 manned production platforms and 24 of the 101 rigs in the US
sector of the gulf. Ofﬁcials said 41,967 b/d of oil (3.2% of normal gulf crude production) and 100 MMcfd of natural gas (1.3% of normal production) were shut in.
Analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc. said, “Most of
the majors are not evacuating platform workers, and others are keeping all essential
employees in the gulf. The forecasts now suggest that the US oil and gas infrastructure in the gulf are safe as the Category 4 storm heads towards Mexico.”
Shell ofﬁcials evacuated 380 offshore workers on Aug. 18, and were scheduled
to bring ashore another 200 on Aug. 19. However, a company spokesman said Aug.
20, “Due to high conﬁdence in the Hurricane Dean storm track over the next several
days, we are suspending any further personnel evacuations at this time.”
Shell shut in gulf production of 39,000 b/d of crude and 97.5MMcfd of gas. However, Shell said no additional shut-ins were expected. Meanwhile, ofﬁcials would
continue monitoring Dean, as well as Tropical Disturbance No. 37 that “may potentially impact portions of the eastern Gulf of Mexico late this week into next week.”
On the other hand, the storm forced Petroleos Mexicanos, Mexico’s national oil
company, to shut down 140 offshore units and move 1,300 workers to land. “It is
expected to move towards the Bay of Campeche, where 66% of Pemex’s oil production is located,” said Raymond James analysts Aug. 20.

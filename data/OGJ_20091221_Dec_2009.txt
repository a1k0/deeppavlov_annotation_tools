COVER
In September, ExxonMobil Production Co. reported progress at its
Point Thomson gas-condensate field on the Alaska North Slope
(right image, cover), 60 miles east of Prudhoe Bay.The first two
wells are to be completed to their final depths by yearend 2010.
OGJ’s Worldwide Report, which starts on p. 18, updates global oil
and gas reserves and 2008 oil production by country. New process
columns (left image) were part of a 180,000-b/d expansion at
Marathon Oil’s Garyville, La., that came on line earlier this year,
boosting the refinery’s crude oil capacity to 436,000 b/d.This
was one of the major developments during 2009 in global refining
that is reported (beginning on p. 46) in OGJ’s Worldwide Report.

a climb upward again. Slow and
difficult though the journey may
be, the ones who start to climb
first will also be the first to benefit in whatever form the new
world economy will take.

Sunrise or
Sunset?
There is no doubt that while
sea surface temperatures are rising and glaciers around the world
are receding, as far as the global
economy is concerned, the sun is
setting and we are all in for a big
chill. And while the atmosphere
is heating, industry is putting
plans for growth in the deep
freeze but the more you freeze
assets, the less chance there is of
protecting—much less increasing—their value.
Whether you believe in what
scientists say or you dispute
global warming, it’s certain that

the sun will rise again but it’s up
to us to determine when it will
happen. Well, how many motivational speakers have we paid
to convince our employees not
to wring their hands about
problems but view them instead
as opportunities challenging their
creativity, innovative skills and
productivity. Isn’t it time to take
our own advice?
To stop this self-destructive
downward spiral we should now
be thawing those plans for
improvement that we’ve been
squirreling away in the freezer
and—yes!—be drawing up bold
new ones too. Even the worst
depression will inevitably bottom
out, and there will ultimately be

Those who look to government
instead of industry to remedy our
current ills will be disappointed.
Democracies, well-meaning and
well-directed though they may
be, are hamstrung by the vagaries
of free elections: good administrations as well as bad can be
voted out of office, and with
them whatever good government-sponsored projects have
been begun. And authoritarian
states will never make real
progress but only batten on that
made in democratic societies.
Industry must do as much or
more than government. And it is
up to us, the petroleum industry,
as the only one with the proven
experience in mounting massive
long-term projects and the vision
and courage to take on work of
truly global scope, to lead such a
huge undertaking. We don’t have
to come hat in hand begging for
bailouts. We should still have the
strength, self-reliance and sheer
guts of the original oil patch to
turn hopes into reality.
Let’s show the world we’re ready
to do it!

Chevron announces $21.6 billion capital budget
Chevron Corp. announced a $21.6 billion capital and exploratory spending program for 2010, down 5% from projected 2009
spending.
Included in the 2010 budget are $1.6 billion of expenditures
by affiliates, which do not require cash outlays by Chevron’s consolidated companies. Dave O’Reilly, chairman and chief executive
officer, said 80% of the 2010 spending program is for upstream
exploration and production projects worldwide. Another 16% is
earmarked for the company’s downstream businesses that manufacture, transport, and sell gasoline, diesel fuel, and other refined
products.
“Much of our 2010 spending continues to be on large, multiyear projects consistent with our upstream growth strategies and
on improving operating efficiency and reliability,” O’Reilly said.
A total $17.3 billion is budgeted for upstream operations including $4.1 billion US and the rest international. Downstream
will total $3.4 billion, including $1.6 billion US and $1.8 billion
international. Chemicals, technology, power generation, and other corporate activities are budgeted at $900 million.
Major capital projects include development of the Gorgon
natural gas project in Western Australia and opportunities in the
deepwater US Gulf of Mexico, offshore western Africa, and the
Gulf of Thailand. Funding is also planned for focused appraisal in
core hydrocarbon basins.
Downstream outlays will include projects in the company’s refineries in Mississippi and California. The company’s 50%-owned
GS Caltex affiliate also is to continue upgrading of its Yeosu refining complex in South Korea. In support of projects to commercialize the company’s large natural gas resource base, downstream
expenditures will be made in 2010 on gas-to-liquids manufacturing facilities.

Hess sets spending at $3.9 billion for 2010
Hess Corp. has budgeted $3.9 billion in capital and exploratory
spending for 2010, $700 million more than it budgeted for 2009.
In 2010 it plans to spend $2.4 billion for production, $600 million for development, and $850 million for exploration.
Key targets of the production expending include the Bakken
shale in North Dakota, where Hess plans to increase its rig count
to eight from three and to expand facilities; drilling at the Okume
complex off Equatorial Guinea; and drilling in deepwater Shenzi
oil and gas field in the Gulf of Mexico, Beryl oil field off the UK,
and Valhall oil field off Norway.
Development spending mentioned by Hess includes Valhall redevelopment, work on the oil rim of Ujung Pahgkah gas field off
Indonesia, and Pony oil field in the Gulf of Mexico.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Hess plans to fund five exploratory wells on Permit WA-390-P
and eight on Permit WA-404-P on the North West Shelf off Australia and one exploratory well on BM-S-22 in the Santos basin
off Brazil. Other exploratory spending will include projects in the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Ghana, and Indonesia.

Husky Energy unveils $3.1 billion budget for 2010
Husky Energy Inc., Calgary, has set a capital budget of $3.1 billion for 2010, up 20% from 2009 and focused on areas with the
highest potential returns, particularly Western Canada heavy oil
and oil sands, Eastern Canada offshore developments, and Southeast Asia developments.
“The company is poised to take advantage of the forecast economic cycle and to pursue business growth,” said John C.S. Lau,
president and chief executive officer.
Capital investments allocated in 2010 will enable Husky to
position its medium and long-term growth while maintaining
Canadian upstream production, officials said. The increase in annual oil production is expected to offset the reduction in natural
gas production due to low gas prices. Husky is ready to increase
gas tie-ins and production if commodity prices strengthen.
Meanwhile, the North Amethyst subsea tie-back work is complete, and drilling of development wells will be a major focus in
2010. Production from North Amethyst is expected in the first
quarter and will ramp up during the year as new wells are tied-in.
Engineering and construction contracts will be placed to advance the Liwan gas project on Block 29/26 in the South China
Sea, with project sanction expected in early 2010. The West Hercules deepwater rig will drill 6-8 exploration, delineation, and
development wells during 2010. The recently discovered LiuHua
gas field will be developed in conjunction with Liwan gas field,
realizing synergies by sharing development facilities.
Husky holds a significant land position in Western Canada. The
company’s capital program is focused on growth of the upstream
production through the use and application of enhanced oil recovery technology. In 2010, Husky plans to increase capital spending
by over 65% to $1.2 billion focused on its heavy oil properties,
EOR projects, and unconventional gas holdings.
Significant progress on the Sunrise Oil Sands Project has been
made, officials said. A review of the project achieved material reductions in capital costs and improved project efficiencies. Frontend engineering and design work will be completed in the first
quarter, targeting first production in 2014.
Midstream, Husky will spend $170 million largely on plant
maintenance, pipelines, infrastructure, and related operations.
The Lloydminster upgrader is planned to have a 45-day maintenance turnaround in the third quarter.
Capital expenditure for downstream is forecast at $465 mil-

Development

Shell, CNPC groups win Iraqi oil deals
The Iraqi oil ministry awarded service contracts for development of giant Majnoon and Halfaya oil fields in the first of 2 days
of bidding by 45 companies.
Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Petronas won the contract for Majnoon field in southern Iraq.
The combine—Shell 60% and Petronas 40%—bid plateau production of 1.8 million b/d of oil and a fee of $1.39/bbl of increased production. The field now produces about 45,000 b/d.
The Iraqi government retains 25% participating interests in all
licenses.
In 2003, former Iraqi Oil Minister Issam Al-Chalabi estimated
original oil in place for Majnoon at 38 billion bbl and original
reserves at 12 billion bbl (OGJ, Mar. 24, 2003, p. 42). The field is
north of Basra near the Iranian border.
The contract for Halfaya field, between Majnoon and the city
of Amara, went to a consortium led by China National Petroleum
Corp. bidding plateau production of 535,000 b/d and a fee of
$1.40/bbl. Current production is 3,000 b/d.
Combine interests are CNPC 50% and Total SA and Petronas,
25% each.
For Halfaya, Al-Chalabi estimated original oil in place of 16
billion bbl and original reserves of 4.6 billion bbl.
Six fields drew no bids during the first day, possibly due to
insecurity or proximity to residential areas.
Fifteen fields were open for bidding.

New Brunswick Frederick Brook well is discovery
Corridor Resources Inc., Halifax, NS, pronounced its Green
Road well in New Brunswick, Canada, as a new field discovery
after it tested gas from two shaly intervals.
The Green Road G-41 well, 4 km north of Elgin, NB, stabilized at 430 Mscfd of gas at 147 psi final flowing wellhead pres-

Range Resources Corp., Fort Worth, one of the top operators in
the Devonian Marcellus shale gas play, said it expects to end 2010
at a net 180-200 MMcfd of gas equivalent from the formation and
believes drilling so far has derisked 390,000 acres in southwestern
Pennsylvania.
The operator also said its net production has reached a net 100
MMcfd of gas equivalent from the formation and forecast that to
rise to 360-400 MMcfd of gas equivalent by yearend 2011. The
current output figure is a fourfold increase since late 2008.
Range is ending 2009 with 11 horizontal and vertical rigs
working compared with 4 rigs last January. The count will climb

sure after an 83-hr flow period from a black shale at 2,000-2,050
m.
Final stabilized rate from a silty, sandy shale interval at 1,8501,900 m was 3 MMscfd at a final flowing wellhead pressure of
699 psi. That zone produced 42.4 MMscf of gas in 184-hr at a peak
rate of 11.7 MMscfd.
Both zones had been fractured with propane at the vertical
well (OGJ Online, Nov. 25, 2009).
The Green Road well has been shut in as a future producer,
awaiting further exploration and development in the area and a
potential pipeline connection to Corridor’s McCully gas plant located 20 km west.
Apache Canada Ltd. signed a farmout and option agreement
with Corridor Resources to pursue gas in Frederick Brook shale in
southern New Brunswick (OGJ Online, Dec. 8, 2009).

Chevron-led group makes gas find off W. Australia
A group led by Chevron Australia has made another natural
gas find in its exploration permit WA-374-P off Western Australia.
The company reported that its Satyr-1 wildcat, drilled in 1,070
m of water, intersected 130 m of net gas pay.
The discovery, which is yet to be tested, follows that of the
group’s Achilles-1 find in October in the same permit that intersected a 100-m net gas pay zone in the Triassic-age Mungaroo
sandstone reservoir target.
Both finds are south of Io-Jansz field and west of Gorgon field
and are expected to provide additional gas supplies to underpin
the $43 billion (Aus.) Gorgon domestic gas and LNG project.
Satyr-1 was drilled with the Ensco 7500 semisubmersible rig.
It is part of a 10-well campaign being carried out by the group in
Australia this year.
Chevron has a 50% interest in the permit, which lies 160 km
northwest of Onslow in the Greater Gorgon Area. ExxonMobil
Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC each have 25%. ✦

to 24 rigs by the end of 2011. Production rates are rising and costs
are falling, the company said.
The company also said it has drilled two horizontal wells in
Lycoming County, northeastern Pennsylvania, one of which is in
completion.
Range also is testing other shale formations above and below
the Marcellus.
John Pinkerton, chairman and chief executive officer, said,
“All of us at Range are proud to have pioneered the Marcellus shale
and believe it is a shining example of the private sector working together with public agencies to create a long-lasting stimulus.

The Gulf of Mexico, 29 43.25 N, 88 47.49 W, 1:47 PM

With sour crude constantly flowing through his
manifolds 6,500 feet down, Marc Costa can hardly
stand the tension.

Engineered materials.
Sandvik specializes in duplex, super-duplex,
hyper-duplex steels and other advanced
alloys. They are extremely resistant to corrosion caused by salt and aggressive chemicals
otherwise threatening oil and gas operations.
The remarkable mechanical strength of these
materials also allows more compact system
designs, lighter yet tougher tube installations
and more versatile wirelines.

What sour oil and biting chemicals do to destroy any piece of subsea hardware is not difficult to imagine. Especially if it’s a 100-ton
manifold moving over 3,000 gallons of that oil every minute.
On platforms throughout the Gulf of Mexico, this is a clear and
present danger that many people are quite concerned about, to say
the least.
Others aren’t losing sleep over it at all.
Their secret? Manifold components made of engineered materials
from Sandvik. These materials resist corrosion like nothing else. No
matter how sour the crude or how aggressive the chemicals.
Sandvik uses powder-metal HIP technology to manufacture
huge and complex offshore components with a minimum of welds.
This makes them not only corrosion-resistant, but remarkably

strong and reliable as well. They can take just about any kind of
beating down there.
As the oil and gas industry goes up against more hostile operating
conditions, Sandvik’s cure is more innovative metallurgical technology
and more advanced materials.
We continuously develop new, higher grades of these materials,
along with new manufacturing processes. The result is equipment
that withstands corrosion, pressure, high temperatures and mechanical stress better than ever before.
Engineered materials from Sandvik. Possibly your best insurance
against bad news.

Husky agrees to acquire Suncor outlets
Husky Energy Inc., Calgary, entered an agreement with Suncor Energy Inc. and Suncor Energy Products Inc. to purchase
98 retail gasoline outlets in the competitive Southern Ontario
market, subject to approval by the Canadian Commissioner of
Competition.
Suncor agreed with the commissioner to divest the retail outlets in July as part of its merger with Petro-Canada. Successful
completion of the deal would increase to 571 Husky’s total network of Canadian retail outlets, establishing its position as one of
the leading gas retailers in the country. Terms of the acquisition
were not revealed.
“These facilities are in proximity to our US refining assets, and
the downstream integration grows our presence in the highly urbanized and densely populated Ontario market from 30 stations
to 128,” said John C.S. Lau, Husky Energy’s president and chief
executive. It also strengthens the company’s position as one of
Canada’s largest fully integrated energy companies.

Decision due for Total’s Dunkirk refinery
The future is in question for Total SA’s 137,000 b/d Dunkirk
refinery, also called the Flanders refinery, in northern France.
Shut down since mid-September because of a product surplus
in France, the refinery was to have been reopened 3 months later
when its inventories had been drawn down if the market strengthened, Total spokesman Michael Crochet-Voure told OGJ.
With French refining capacity still underutilized, the refinery has now come under review. A decision must be made before
a planned turnaround in March. Total’s options are to sell, shut
down, transform, or mothball the refinery.
Crochet-Voure said no decision has been made. The facility’s
370 workers are still on the site.

Caltex Australia to close lube plant at Kurnell
Citing global refinery margins “remaining under pressure”
in this year’s second half from depressed demand and “expected
growth in global surplus refinery capacity,” Caltex Australia announced Dec. 9 it will close its 3,300 b/d lube plant at Kurnell in
Sydney.
The closing is part of a “major cost efficiency drive” in which

the company will recognize “significant items totaling approximately $170 million (before tax).” The company expects a savings
of $93 million (Aus) “for asset impairment and redundancies relating to the planned closure.”
The plant, said the company, is not “viable” because it manufactures “outmoded lubricant products and faces declining feedstock sources.” The announcement did not set a date for the closure, citing “further detailed work to be done.” ✦

Turkmenistan-China gas line to be commissioned
Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow said his
country plans to commission the newly constructed Turkmenistan-China natural gas pipeline on Dec. 14 to coincide with a state
visit by Chinese President Hu Jintao.
Berdimuhamedow said the line will supply China with 40 billion cu m/year of gas for 30 years.
According to China’s vice-foreign minister Wang Guangya, the
pipeline will transport 30 billion cu m of gas more than 1,800 km
from Turkmenistan via neighboring Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to
China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.
“Such a project is a model of mutually beneficial cooperation
between the four states, and displays our desire to bolster economic cooperation and realize common development,” Wang
said.
“The construction started in July 2008 and one of the two lines
of the project will be completed in mid-December this year,” said
Wang ahead of Hu’s Central Asia visit, which will begin in Kazakhstan on Dec. 12, followed by his stay in Turkmenistan on
Dec. 13-14.
Earlier this month, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said
the new Turkmen-Chinese gas line would not endanger energy
cooperation between his country and China.
“We are aware of the Chinese gas needs and have close contact
with our Chinese colleagues. We also offer to expand cooperation
with them. We do not think that the prospective gas pipeline from
Turkmenistan to China will damage our plans,” the Russian leader
said (OGJ Online, Dec. 7, 2009).

Export pipeline routes considered for Uganda
Uganda’s government, concerned by delays over a proposed
oil export pipeline through neighboring Kenya, is considering
construction of an oil pipeline to Tanzania’s Port of Dar es Salaam.
However, Ben Twado, Uganda’s commissioner for petroleum
supplies, said it is still too early to discuss the matter in detail.
The Ugandan and Kenyan governments have been negotiating
extending and upgrading the pipeline that transports oil northward in Kenya from the Port of Mombassa to Eldoret. Uganda
wants to reverse the flow of the Mombassa-Eldoret line so crude
can be transported southward, but Kenya is said to oppose redesigning the pipeline.
Tamoil East Africa, a unit of the Libyan state-owned oil com-

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

pany Tamoil Holdings, was contracted last year to extend the
pipeline 351 km from Eldoret to Kampala. However, work on the
proposed extension—due to begin in April and last 15 months—
has not yet started.
BMI analysts said Tullow Oil PLC and Heritage Oil PLC favor
construction of a new oil export pipeline to Mombasa and have
discussed possible funding with financial investors.
Eni SPA, which may acquire a share in the licenses from Heritage Oil, proposed constructing a 100,000 b/d refinery in Uganda
that would be connected to a new export pipeline to Mombasa.
“This would allow the government to maximize its revenues by
keeping all of the refining operations domestically, while letting
producers sell most of Lake Albert’s oil internationally at market
prices,” BMI said.
Eni’s purchase of a 50% interest in Uganda’s Blocks 1 and 3A
from Heritage Oil for $1.5 billion is expected to be completed in
the first quarter. Eni said the blocks in the Lake Albert basin have
resources for more than 1 billion boe and that 700 million bbl
have already been discovered (OGJ Online, Nov. 24, 2009).
“We’re hoping that within 2 years they should be able to start
production,” Ugnada’s energy minister Hilary Onek told Reuters.
Uganda wants to build a refinery with 100,000-200,000 b/d capacity to process the crude.
“Our policy is to refine domestically all oil produced in Uganda. However, depending really on the production, some excess of
crude oil may be exported,” Onek said.

Nippon to lease domestic oil tanks to ADNOC
Nippon Oil Corp. has reached a final agreement with Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. (ADNOC) for the UAE firm to store oil in an
effort to bolster Japan’s national reserves.
Under the agreement, ADNOC will store 3.9 million bbl of
crude for 3 years starting this month at a reserve base in Kagoshima Prefecture in southern Japan.
The basic agreement, which will allow storage equal to a day’s
consumption for Japan, initially was announced in June and is
expected to help improve the Asian nation’s energy security.
At the time, Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry
said the agreement also would give Japan a preferential right to
purchase the stored oil reserves there in times of emergency.
The scheme will also allow Abu Dhabi to sell its oil in other
East Asian countries, such as South Korea and Taiwan, by using the
Japanese base as a distribution terminal. According to METI, Abu
Dhabi supplies nearly 40% of Japan’s oil imports. ✦

Widely held delusion

________________

12

Al Gore’s recent well intentioned
challenge that we produce “100% of our
electricity from renewable energy and
truly clean carbon-free sources within
10 years” represents a widely held delusion that we can’t afford to harbor.
One of the most frequently ignored
energy issues is the time required to
bring forth a major new fuel to the
world’s energy supply. Until the mid19th Century, wood-burning powered
the world. Then coal gradually surpassed wood on into the first part of
the 20th Century. Oil was discovered in
the 1860s, but it was a century before it
surpassed coal as our largest energy fuel.
Trillions of dollars are now invested in
the world’s infrastructure to mine, process, and deliver coal, oil, and natural
gas.
As Distinguished Professor Vaclav
Smil of the University of Manitoba
recently put it, “It is delusional to think
that the United States can install in
a decade wind and solar generating
capacity equivalent to that of thermal
power plants that took nearly 60 years
to construct.”
Texas has three times the nameplate
wind capacity of any other state-8,000+
Mw. The Electric Reliability Council
of Texas (ERCOT) manages the Texas
electric grids. ERCOT reports that its unpredictable wind farms actually supply
just a little over 700 Mw during summer
power demand and provide just 1% of

energy-efficient public transport.
We do have serious issues with fossil fuel burning. Coal is an increasing
environmental problem, and oil supplies

need to improve energy efficiency with
upgraded buildings, high-mileage vehicles, and electric public transport. The

have to be recast to avoid transporting
so much of it for great distances. Funding and encouraging these efforts will
likely require unpopular but affordable
energy taxes, especially on gasoline and
coal production.
Above all we need more realism and
less political dreaming as we approach

Chad’s resource curse
An assessment of the World Bank’s failed Chadian
experiment confirms the intuition that poor countries with dodgy governments remain doomed to the
resource curse. In Chad and neighboring Cameroon,
the bank wove extraordinary financial and transparency controls into loans for a major energy project. It
wanted development to proceed with minimum social
and environmental disruption and maximum development and alleviation of poverty. Against the first two
standards the experiment seems to have succeeded.
Against the latter standard—the bank’s priority—it did
not.
The effort was noble. Too frequently, resource
development does more economic harm than good in
poor countries. In too many cases, a rush for riches
crushes traditional economic activities, trade reversals
sink local currencies, corruption dissipates wealth,
and living conditions deteriorate. This is the curse, a
nagging question about the social acceptability—as

New estimates for Australia, China,
and Turkmenistan have resulted in an
increase in reported worldwide oil
and gas reserves, according to Oil &
Gas Journal’s annual survey of proved
reserves.
The world’s oil reserves total 1.35
trillion bbl, up from 1.34 trillion in last
year’s survey (OGJ, Dec. 22, 2008, p.
20). Total gas reserves are 6.6 quadrillion cu ft, up almost 355 tcf
from those reported a year ago.
The recession-driven drop
in global oil demand in 2008
and 2009 led to a decline
in this year’s worldwide oil
production. OGJ estimates that
worldwide oil production this
year will fall 3% from 2008 to average
70.5 million b/d.
In 2008, global oil production averaged 72.8 million b/d, climbing from
72.16 million b/d a year earlier. This
increase was spurred by strong oil
demand in the first half of 2008, which
led to record oil prices.

Reserves changes
The region with the largest percentage changes in oil and gas reserves is
Asia-Pacific, where total reserves of
oil are up 18% from a year ago and
gas reserves are up 25%. New reserves
estimates for Australia peg economic
oil reserves at 3.318 billion bbl and gas
reserves at 110 tcf. These figures, obtained from Geoscience Australia, were
derived under the McKelvey classification system.
China’s reserves also jumped. The
new figure for oil reserves is 20.35 billion bbl, while China’s gas reserves are
now pegged at 107 tcf.
Gas reserves in Turkmenistan are
now estimated at 265 tcf, up from 90
tcf in the previous survey. The country’s giant gas field, South Yolotan,
was discovered in 2006 and drove this
increase, which helped boost total gas
reserves in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union by 8.5%. The region’s
oil reserves are unchanged from a year
ago.

Canada and Mexico such that overall
output in the Western Hemisphere will
post an increase of almost 1% to average an estimated 16.78 million b/d.
US crude and condensate production in 2009 will average 5.337 million
b/d, up from last year’s 4.95 million

will fall 7% from 2008 to an average
of 2.6 million b/d. Mexico has not

Stanislaw: Shift energy focus from ‘green’ to ‘clean’
A global low-carbon future is possible if policymakers and economic
leaders—including the oil and gas
industry—shift focus from “green
energy” to “clean energy,” said energy
expert Joseph A. Stanislaw Dec. 9 at the
Deloitte LLP Oil & Gas conference in
Houston.
“It is now clear that the all-consuming global obsession with anything
green has subsided” as the world moves
“from breathless anticipation of a
green dawn, to the more sober work of
systematically and thoughtfully building toward a low-carbon future,” said
Stanislaw, who heads the JA Stanislaw
Group LLC and is a senior advisor to
Deloitte. He is also cofounder and
former president and chief executive
officer of Cambridge Energy Research
Associates.
There has been growing public
recognition in recent years that oil,
natural gas, and coal have the potential
to be clean fuels, Stanislaw said. Fossil
fuels, previously the black sheep of the
new renewable energy era, “are easing
their way back into the conversation as
the essential bridge to a cleaner age,” he
said. “There is a growing understanding that this bridge to the future will be
longer than has been widely acknowledged. And there is a realization that
the pylons of this bridge—oil, natural
gas, and coal—are at risk.”
An October survey by the Pew Research Center showed 57% of Americans polled see “solid evidence” the
earth is warming. While still a strong
majority, that’s down 14% from April
2008 and an even sharper fall from
77% acceptance in 2006 and 2007.
The poll was taken prior to the current “Climategate” scandal surrounding leaked e-mails from the University
of East Anglia indicating some key
scientists fudged scientific data to support evidence of anthropogenic global
warming.
“It does not necessarily reflect a
22

more benighted public—just one that
has more immediate existential concerns. It also might indicate that the
public became skeptical about climate
change because, despite the overheated
rhetoric, they did not see politicians
taking concrete actions,” Stanislaw said.
“The principle goal of policymakers
should be to establish a level playing
field that makes it easier to identify the
cleanest fuels producible at the lowest
cost, while also reducing energy use
through efficiency and other technologies,” he said.
Moreover, Stanislaw said, “The current schism between the old and new
energy industries—wherein the green
evangelists mock the traditional fuels
and the oil and gas crowd reciprocate—should end. This transformation
also could be led by policymakers who
admit there is no silver bullet in our
common effort to build a low-carbon
future. All energy forms, provided they
can meet standards for being clean and
cost-effective, should be able to compete for market share and funding.

He called on oil and gas companies
to commit “to developing carbonneutral technology. The top goal could
be to produce ever-cleaner oil, natural
gas, and coal. Within a generation, we
could well be talking about clean oil,
clean natural gas, and clean coal.”
For industry, he said, “Moving to a
clean energy world represents the largest economic opportunity of the 21st
century. The Chinese market alone for
clean technology is expected to reach
$1 trillion annually.”
He predicted, “There will probably
be more money spent in the energy
sector in a broad sense in the next 50
years than has been invested in the past
100 years, if not in the history of mankind. Channeling these investments
well, into an era of clean energy, is the
challenge that policymakers, the private
sector, and the public all face together.
The bridge to tomorrow’s energy future
depends on a sensible transition plan—
one that takes advantage of all of the
clean fuel sources available to us.” ✦

IEA medium-term update hikes oil demand projection
The International Energy Agency has
raised its projection for average global
oil consumption during 2009-14 by 1.9
million b/d in an update to the medium-term market forecast it published
last June.
The update appeared in IEA’s December Oil Market Report.
The increase in projected demand
from the June forecast reflects stronger economic growth in 2009-10 than
was assumed in June plus the effects of
economic and fiscal stimulus programs,
especially among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development.
In IEA’s high-growth scenario, with
global gross domestic product increasing at an average rate of 3.2%/year,

worldwide oil demand rises to 90.9
million b/d in 2014 from 86.2 million
b/d in 2008.
In a lower-growth case, in which
GDP rises 2.2%/year, global oil demand
reaches 87 million b/d in 2014.
IEA’s updated oil-supply projection
for 2008-14 is an average 1.1 million
b/d higher than in June, with more
crude and NGL expected from members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries than in the earlier
forecast. Much of the increase occurs
late in the forecast period as previously
deferred projects are revived and come
on stream.
In the higher-GDP scenario, global
non-OPEC supply plus OPEC production
capacity rises from 90.94 million b/d in

2009 to 95.6 million b/d in 2014, with
implied spare capacity among OPEC
members of 6.08 million b/d in 2009
and 4.74 million b/d in 2014.
The non-OPEC global supply numbers include NGL production by OPEC
members of 4.86 million b/d in 2009,
rising to 7.35 million b/d in 2014.
They also include biofuels supply
expectations raised by an average of
35,000 b/d over 2008-14 from the June
projection. IEA expects global biofuels
production to rise from 1.6 million b/d
in 2009 to 2.2 million b/d in 2014.
IEA hiked its projection for refining capacity growth by 1.1 million b/d
from the June report to 8.7 million b/d
for 2008-14.
Dominating growth are China, 2.9
million b/d; other Asia, 2.1 million
b/d; and the Middle East, 1.5 million
b/d.
IEA said delays on some large refining projects proved shorter than it
originally assumed. ✦

CERA Chairman Daniel Yergin. “But we
are still a ways off from a return to the
rapid price escalation that preceded the
decline.”
IHS CERA said the index turned
up because of a 5% increase in construction labor costs, which resulted
exclusively from conversion of local ex-

change rates into a weakened US dollar.
Without the currency translation,
the downstream construction cost index would have fallen by 2% instead of
rising by 1.5%.
The weak dollar also caused a “modest gain” in engineering and project
management costs, IHS CERA said.

IHS CERA: Downstream
capital costs turn upward
Costs of designing and building refineries and petrochemical plants have
ended a brief decline, according to IHS
Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
An IHS CERA downstream capital
costs index, which assigns 2000 costs
a value of 100, rose to 172.5 for the
6 months ending in the third quarter of 2009 from 170 in the previous
6-month period.
The first-quarter index was down
9% from the 2008 peak. The index
provides a benchmark for comparing
global costs. It is based on proprietary
databases and analytical tools.
“Just as we saw the beginnings of
a downturn cost trend after the third
quarter of 2008, we are now seeing
the beginnings of a turnaround as the
return to economic growth in most regions of the world in 2010 increases the
demand for commodities and materials for general construction,” said IHS

the use of less carbon-intensive fuels,
the forecast said.
The company believes a revenueneutral carbon tax would have advantages over a cap-and-trade system
in curbing carbon emissions. It said
a carbon tax would create “a clear
and uniform cost for emissions in all
economic decisions.” Such an approach
would avoid the costs and complexities of having to build a new emissions allowances market and the need
for new regulators and administrators
to manage it. It also would not create
market manipulation opportunities or
require complex and costly enforcement systems.
“Returning the tax revenue to
consumers through reductions in
other taxes–payroll taxes or a simple
dividend–reduces the burden on the
economy and ensures that government policy is specifically focused on
reducing emissions, not on becoming a
revenue stream for other purposes,” the
forecast said. “Because global participation is so important to controlling
emissions, a carbon tax may be a more
viable framework for engaging participation by other nations.”

Transportation fuels
ExxonMobil expects the global
vehicle fleet’s composition to change
through 2030. Although conventional
gasoline vehicles will remain in the
majority, followed by diesel-fueled
vehicles, hybrids and other advanced
vehicles will grow rapidly, reaching
about 15% of the world’s total personal
vehicle fleet compared to about 1%
currently.
“ExxonMobil believes that biofuels from photosynthetic algae could
someday play an important role in
meeting the world’s growing need for
transportation fuels, while also reducing CO2 emissions,” the forecast said.
“Scientists already know that certain
algae naturally produce oils similar to
the petroleum products we use today.
If commercial quantities of these
algae-based oils could be developed,
they could avoid the need to build the

wo leading US House Republicans asked the Government
Accountability Office to explore the
impact of allowing more ethanol to
be used in gasoline.
Joe Barton (Tex.), the Energy and
Commerce Committee’s ranking
minority member, and Greg Walden
(Ore.), who fills that post on the
Oversight and Investigations Committee, made their request in a Dec.
9 letter to Gene Dodaro, the US Environmental Protection Agency’s acting
comptroller general.
EPA said on Dec. 1 that it expects,
sometime in mid-2010, to finally
determine whether to raise the allowable ethanol content in gasoline
to 15% from 10% in response to a request from Growth Energy, a biofuels
industry association.
Barton and Walden said an August
GAO report, “Biofuels: Potential
Effects and Challenges of Required
Increases in Production and Use,”
identified many challenges already.
“Current automaker warranties
on vehicles are voided if ethanol exceeds 10% of motor fuel,” they told
Dodaro. “There are also concerns
that higher blends, or even E10, as
the GAO noted, could damage nonauto engines...,” they said.

[ethanol content] fuel blends.”
Barton and Walden said another
strategy that GAO identified was
greater use of vehicles running on
fuels with 85% ethanol and the development of related infrastructure,
such as dedicated ethanol pipelines to transport ethanol from the
Midwest to the East and West coasts,
dedicated tank system for storing
E85, and specialized pumps and
equipments to dispense it.
“As with increasing ethanol blend
percentages, this strategy also may
involve substantial costs and liabilities that have not yet been fully
assessed or estimated,” they said.

Study areas

They suggested that GAO investigate the extent of the federal government’s risk and associated liability
if it allowed the use of intermediate ethanol blends which damaged
vehicles and other equipment and
systems, the key components of the
nation’s motor vehicle and equipment fleets most at risk, durability
and performance of vehicles and
equipment with intermediate ethanol
blends, and economic challenges to
using dedicated ethanol pipelines.

up a climate auction to sell “carbon

directly to consumers (an estimated
average $1,100/year for a family of

“clean-energy” research and development, regionally specific assistance for
communities and workers making the
transition to a “clean-energy” economy,
energy efficiency programs, and reductions in non-CO2 greenhouse gases,
they said.
It also would establish GHG reduction goals of 20% by 2020 (compared
to 17% in the Kerry-Lieberman-Graham
framework and the other major climate
change bills) and 83% by 2050. Several

environmental leaders and organizations endorsed it immediately.

“EPA has taken these actions despite

highly counterproductive, especially
as our nation struggles to regain its
economic footing,” Murkowski maintained.
She said she would file the resolution under provisions of the Congressional Review Act, which Congress

was signed into law by President Bill
Clinton. In this instance, a disapproval

seriously about including oil and gas as

which would be the first in nearly 2
years within the National Petroleum
Reserve-Alaska, Salazar said. The sale
will offer available tracts in the northeast and a portion of the reserve’s
northwest areas, he said.

IPAMS said in a statement, “It’s
important to recognize that developing
American clean energy requires a partnership with government and community stakeholders. We are all accountable to the American public to ensure
that responsible development occurs. As
such, we don’t believe it’s unreasonable
to ask [DOI] to explain the rationale
for its decisions and express concern
when trends are not headed in the right
direction.”

‘Spurious argument’

API’s Gerard: Staff cuts part
of broader reorganization

Attacks on Salazar’s onshore leasing record have no basis, a Wilderness
Society official said following the teleconference. “According to DOI’s own
data for fiscal 2008, there were over 48
million onshore acres under lease, with
less than 14 million acres actually in
development. The industry has a stockpile of nearly 35 million acres which
have been issued, but not developed,”
said Dave Albersworth, a senior advisor
at the environmental organization and
also a DOI official during the Clinton
administration. “For it to complain
that it’s not getting enough acreage is
a spurious argument. It has had lots of
opportunities on federal lands.”
Albersworth told OGJ that he appreciated Salazar’s statement that the
secretary intends to take control of BLM
back from the oil and gas industry. “We
haven’t seen any proposals. There’s a
clear recognition of the problems of
the previous administration’s policies. I
think they’re committed to having a robust oil and gas program while protecting the nation’s resources. That’s what
we’re looking forward to,” Albersworth
said.
The American Petroleum Institute
and IPAMS also issued statements following Salazar’s press conference.
“While we appreciate the already
anticipated lease sale announcement for
2010, the oil and natural gas industry,
which supports 9.2 million American
jobs, believes more can be done to
expand the economy and create new
jobs,” API Pres. Jack N. Gerard said.

Nick Snow
Washington Editor

Federal resource management has
profound implications for the cost of
energy, job creation, revenue growth,
and economic activity, the statement
continued. “We were very encouraged
to hear that Secretary Salazar believes
‘…it is important for the oil and gas
industry to have certainty.’ We look forward to meeting with [DOI] to explore
ideas about how America can more
responsibly develop its federal energy
resources,” it said. ✦

the industry’s workers and be able to

“Today, we directly and indirectly

API’s standards and practices program will continue

“The standards-setting

what it represents. When

told OGJ.

A 15% reduction in its work force
is only part of a major reorganization

Gerard said.
“We will achieve some
savings, but the reorganization was not driven

and efficient can be different from
what the companies face,” Gerard said.
One aspect of API which hasn’t
changed is the challenge of developing a consensus from a wide range of
opinions.
“I think we’re doing much better
developing consensus positions, and we
continue to move forward. I think it’s
all about how you develop those positions. Since I’ve come here, we actually
try to talk about the issues at board
meetings and share ideas to fill opportunities we have in the current political
climate,” Gerard said.
“We’re no different from any other
industry. You’re always going to have
differing opinions. When they are
shared, it helps us refine our thinking

and come to a good resolution. So we
welcome those views from the seniormost leaders of our member companies,” he said.
Political issues can become opportunities, he noted.
“We see those opportunities today
in discussions over climate. We’ve had
a great opportunity to talk about the oil
and gas industry as a major job creator
in the US economy,” the API president said. “People are starting to pay
attention. Democrats and Republicans
alike are saying they probably should
look to oil and gas to help bring the US
economy back to health.”

positions as part of the restructuring. ✦

Japan cheers
Iraq deal

H

as Japan really succeeded in
its long-term effort to secure a
foothold in Iraq’s oil and gas industry? Apparently so, especially after a
consortium led by Japan Petroleum
Exploration Co. (Japex) won the
rights to develop Gharaf oil field.
In Japan, the news was met with
elation. The Nikkei Business Daily
(NBD) said the deal gives Japex the
chance to become “a player to be
reckoned with in an industry that has
been dominated by Western energy
giants.”
NBD said the prize is a result of 10
years of effort led by Japex Chairman
Yuji Tanahashi that may lay the foundation for the formation of a Japanese major and make Japex a driving
force of industry consolidation.
“We have built strong ties based
on mutual trust with Iraq,” said
Tanahashi, whose effort to win oil
rights in Iraq started soon after he assumed the Japex presidency in 2001.
Tanahashi first visited Iraq to
seek cooperation from the regime
of Saddam Hussein. Then, following
the end of the US-led war on Iraq,
Tanahashi started contacting the new
Iraqi government.

Despite the estimated investment of about $7 billion needed to
develop the field, the business will
be adequately profitable, according
to one Japex official. Under the 20year service contract, up to 60% of
produced oil will be used to recoup
the investment.
Altogether, Japex and its partner
Petronas will receive a fee of $1.49/
bbl of produced oil, adding up to
$2.5 billion of income for the two
firms in 20 years—assuming no
problems in the development.

Problems ahead?

But there could indeed be problems, as pointed out by Moody’s
Investors Service, which placed the
A1 long-term issuer ratings of Japex
under review for possible downgrade
after the Gharraf announcement.
Compared to Japex’s average
production of 42,000 boe/d for
the fiscal year ending March 2009,
Moody’s said, “the initial investment
will have a significant impact on the
company’s financial metrics.”

Sept. 21, 2009, p. 22). The ranking was
one position below Chesapeake Energy
Corp. and a position above Devon Energy Corp.

XTO’s production
In this year’s third quarter, XTO
produced 2.42 bcfd of gas, 65,822 b/d
of oil, and 22,010 b/d of natural gas
liquids. It reported reserves on Dec. 31,
2008, of 13.86 tcf of gas equivalent, of
which 85% was gas and 15% liquids,
64% proved developed producing and
36% proved undeveloped.
About 30% of XTO’s gas production comes from shales. The company’s
net land positions in major shale plays
are Barnett, 277,000 acres; Marcellus,
280,000 acres; Fayetteville, 380,000
acres; Woodford, 160,000 acres; and
Haynesville, 100,000 acres.
Its Bakken oil shale position is
450,000 net acres.
About 45% of the company’s gas
production is from tight gas basins, including Williston, Green River, Uinta,
Piceance, San Juan, Permian, Anadarko,
Arkoma, East Texas, Arkla, Gulf Coast,
and Appalachian.
One of the company’s key plays
is the Freestone trend of East Texas,
where it holds 381,000 net acres and
produced an average 816 MMcfd of
gas, 598 MMcfd net to XTO, in the
third quarter.
XTO’s position there and elsewhere
expanded with its September 2008
merger of Hunt Petroleum Co. in a
cash and stock acquisition worth $4.2
billion.
The ExxonMobil acquisition remains
subject to approvals by regulators and
XTO shareholders. The boards of both
companies have approved the deal.
About $10 billion of the acquisition
value represents assumption of XTO

In the final part of this series, we estimate the number of committed assets
in the Gulf of Mexico that are expected
to be marginal over a 60-year horizon.
Our sample set includes all producing structures in shallow water circa
January 2007. Structures installed after
January 2007, as well as deepwater
structures, are not part of the assessment.
We compute the expected quantity
and value of production and gross
revenue streams using the probabilistic
framework and model assumptions
outlined in Part 2 (OGJ, Dec. 14, 2009,
p. 33). The cumulative hydrocarbon
production from the inventory of producing assets is estimated to be 1.056
billion bbl of oil and 13.3 tcf of gas.
Marginal production from the committed asset inventory is expected to
contribute 4.1% of total oil production
and 5.4% of gas production in the gulf.
A meta-evaluation procedure is adopted
to present the results of sensitivity
analysis.

Economic structures transition
through a marginal classification, and
operate as marginal producers until
revenue falls below their economic
limit. The size of the marginal subcategory can therefore increase or decrease over time, depending upon the
number of structures entering the class
(as economic producers) and structures
departing (to abandonment).
The absolute size of the marginal
class is relatively constant over the first
two decades of the forecast horizon. On
a percent basis, as the number of economic structures declines, the inventory of marginal structures represents
an increasing share of the committed
asset inventory (Fig. 2).

and marginal structures each year for

their respective distributions. The total
number of committed assets is denoted
σ(d, Po, Pg, m, a), and the number of
economic and marginal structures is
denoted σe(d, Po, Pg, m, a) and σm(d, Po,
Pg, m, a).
In Figs. 3-5, average counting functions are graphed with a one standard
deviation envelope for the total number of structures and the number of
economic and marginal producers. It
is useful to consider the envelope as
bounding the path trajectories that arise
from selecting different points (d, Po,
Pg, m, a) in the design space.
Each point (d, Po, Pg, m, a) is associated with one path trajectory, and as
points are sampled within the design
space, individual trajectories will
change. If Normality conditions are
assumed for the parameters, the actual
path realized would be expected to be
bound within the envelope about two
thirds of the time.
Structure counts are observed to
be strictly decreasing functions for
producing and economic structures
(Figs. 3 and 4). Because the number of
economic structures initially dominates
the total structure count, the behavior
of the composite trajectory (Fig. 3) is
expected to closely follow the economic path (Fig. 4). The marginal structure
count increases and plateaus for several
years before declining (Fig. 5), and
because the number of structures classified as marginal are small relative to
the economic structure count, the total
path trajectory is dominated by the economic class behavior.
During the period of time in which
structure production is marginal,
new structures enter the class (from
economic producers) and marginal
structures leave (for abandonment). The
relative number of arrivals and departures impact the length of the plateau.
The shape of the marginal trajectory
would be expected to play a dominant
role when the number of economic
structures decline, but at this time,
since the shape of the two trajectories are similar and the counts are of
similar magnitude, the influence of the

Production envelopes for economic
and marginal structures are shown in
Figs. 8-10. In Figs. 8 and 9, the average
production profile for all producing
and economic structures is depicted
with a two standard deviation envelope. Near the beginning and end
of the production forecast for these
asset classes the envelopes tend to be
very tight, due in part to the relative
insensitivity of the total production to
parameter variation at these points in
time.
As structures age and production
transfers to the marginal categorization,
the impact of changes in input variables
becomes more pronounced. The production envelope of marginal structures
maintains a wide interval at the start of
the horizon but converges near the end
of the forecast (Fig. 10).

The average annual production from

The production profile parallels the
general shape of the structure count
and illustrates the relative contribution
provided by economic and marginal
assets for each year of the forecast.
Marginal assets produce a fraction
of the total production, although over
time its relative contribution increases
(Fig. 7), as dictated by the model
framework (since the committed asset
inventory is fixed). In total, production
from shallow water marginal structures
is expected to contribute less than 5%
of the total shallow water production
from the structure set.

tive economic, marginal, and total
production are given by Equations 1-3.
The coefficients of the regression
models are of the expected sign and
statistically significant for most of the
variables, and the model fits are relatively high (Tables 2-4). For any input
parameters selected within the design
space, the output for cumulative BOE
production will vary in accord with the
regression models shown.
In Table 2, model results for total
(cumulative) production are depicted.
In Tables 3 and 4, regression results
for gas and oil streams are depicted.
The model fits in Tables 3 and 4 are
improved somewhat over their BOE
counterpart due in part to the more
homogeneous nature of the production
stream. An example is illustrated in the
following box.
Regression functions are useful
to estimate total hydrocarbon production for user-defined variables and to
investigate parameter sensitivities. From
Table 2, selecting the point (d, Po, Pg, m,
α) = (0.10, 120, 10, 4, 1) in the design
space yields the cumulative production
from marginal assets as Qm (0.10, 120,
10, 4, 1) = –1.8E7 + 5.04E7 + 1.1E7 +
3.08E8 – 9.1E7 = 2.60E8 boe = 260 million boe. Similarly, Q e (0.10, 120, 10, 4)
= 3.09 billion boe and QT (0.10, 120, 10,
1) = 3.14 billion boe. Cumulative oil and
gas production estimates are computed
similarly using the results in Tables 3
and 4.

discount rates, and economic and marginal thresholds. We do not consider
capital or operating expenditures, or
the impact of tax, royalty, or depreciation schedules in the assessment.
The model results for total boe, gas,
and oil production for the economic,
marginal, and combined asset classes
are shown in Tables 5-7. Equations
for the total hydrocarbon production
stream are described in $1,000 and
given by Equations 4-6.
The use of a fixed-term coefficient is
optional and the model results are presented with and without this term. The
coefficients of the regression models
are of the expected sign and statistically
significant for most of the variables,
and the model fits are reasonably high.
The most important components of
marginal production are the values of
m, a, and D; the decline parameter and
hydrocarbon prices are less significant.
This is not surprising considering the
nature of the producing assets. The
decline parameter only contributes to
the portion of total production due to
latecomer structures and is not expected to be a significant model driver.
If latecomer structures contributed a
larger portion of total GOM production, the significance of the decline

parameter would increase. An example
of the revenue models is illustrated in
the box below.
The present value of economic
production for a 10% decline rate, $100/
bbl oil, $10/Mcf gas, and a 15% discount
rate is computed to be PVe (0.1, 100, 10,
4, 0.15) = $147 billion. For economic assets, the abandonment threshold does
not play a role in determining value, and
thus a term for the parameter a is not
included in the model. The discounted
value and gross revenue for marginal
producing assets is computed to be PVm
(0 0.1, 100, 10, 4, 1, 0.15) = $3 billion.

Summary

When the revenue from an offshore
structure’s production stream approaches its cost of operations, the structure is
said to be marginal and its production
is classified as marginal.
We operationalized the definition of
marginal production based on revenue

Allocation
The oil industry reconciles fiscally
measured hydrocarbon production
with estimated production from associated wells. This process, known as allocation, is important for several reasons
including accounting for field production to owners and governments, field
surveillance, and volumetric input to
reservoir simulators.
Traditionally companies perform
allocation monthly, reconciling the less
accurate sum of the well tests adjusted
by well uptimes with the more accurate
fiscal measurements. This process has
several inherent inaccuracies including less-than-perfect well tests, lack of
precisely knowing when wells were
off production, unknown well flow
changes, and the methods for allocating
the difference between fiscal and well
test measurements.
Ineffective allocation can lead to
financial consequences because of
inaccuracies in volumes allocated between multiple owners and various tax
regimes.
Inaccuracies can also feed through

decline, especially during later stages of
the life cycle.
• Well stream composition can
suddenly change, for example from
increasing water cut or increasing GOR.
• Production rates of artificially
lifted wells can vary between well tests
due to the effects of variables such as
backpressure (gas lift) and pump speed
and efficiency (electric submersible
pumps, progressing cavity pumps,
beam pumps, and hydraulic lift).
• Production from wells in enhanced oil recovery can change
unpredictably due to changes in gas,
water, steam, or polymer flows in the
reservoir.
• Variable periodic production in
wells that are on intermittent gas lift
and gas wells subject to periodic liquid
loading;
• Produced wax, ashphaltines, or
scale that foul production lines, which
need to be cleaned often.
All of the above unpredictable instabilities are aggravated by flaws in the
basic well test process such as:2
• Wrong well put on test.
• Wrong instrumentation used, such
as improperly sized or damaged orifice
plate.
• Inaccuracies in well test instrumentation due to improper calibration
or lack of maintenance.

Hydrocarbon accounting systems
prepare and store reconciled production and injection data on a well at the
conduit, reservoir, block, and zone level
with the following objectives to:
• Account for fluid volumes transported in production systems from the
source (reservoir) to the point of sale.
• Differentiate the ownership of
hydrocarbon fluids.
• Assist production planners regarding hydrocarbon offtake schedules.
• Inform operations and petroleum
engineering staff regarding reservoir,
well, and production facility behavior.
• Maximize the validity and integrity of hydrocarbon accounting data for
report, audit, and review purposes.
Hydrocarbon accounting culminates
in a monthly report of producing wells.
The MRPW is the official production record used for fiscal, audit, and
reporting purposes.
MRPW data provide volumetric input to reservoir simulators that in turn
help make decisions regarding future
field developments. The data also provide a way to track and record reservoir
reserves.
Shell calls the concept of adjusting
individual conduit volumes such that
their sum equals the related fiscal measurements as reconciliation. The term
allocation is the calculation whereby
the official conduit volumes (produced
or injected) are assigned to the related
reservoir units.
A flaw in the traditional hydrocarbon accounting process is the assumption that the flow during a well test
(about 1% of the time) equals the flow
of when the well is not on test (about
99% of the time). This assumption is
questionable because:
• Well rates can vary unpredictably between well tests due to natural

to reservoir simulators that assist in
decision making such as where to drill
the next well. These inaccuracies often
compound with time, as monthly allocation occurs during the field’s life
cycle.

• Improperly ranged well test
instrumentation such as testing a well
producing at low rates with instrumentation sized for wells producing at high
rates.
• Testing wells at flow and pressure
conditions that differ from normal flow
conditions, especially for wells with
high backpressure such as step outs and
subsea wells with long flowlines.
• Commingled subsea wells without
a dedicated test line, forcing testing by
difference at test conditions that may
vary from normal flowing conditions.
Operators can mitigate the effects of
these flaws with techniques that continuously estimate well flow rates.
They can also use continuous estimation of well flow rates to produce
automatic daily reports of key performance indicators such as daily well oil,
gas, and water production and deferment rates.

Shell’s estimation technique
Shell developed the FieldWare Production Universe data-driven modeling
application for continuously estimating
well production. References 3-7 describe the development background and
Shell’s early operational experiences
with the application.
Data-driven models provide a virtual
continuous three-phase meter for all
wells.

The data-driven approach takes full
advantage of the well test and available real-time production metering in
conventional production operations,
particularly with regard to changing
well conditions and instrumentation

The technique requires an abbreviated multirate well test along with
historic well-test results as input for
the modeling process that generates
data-driven well models. These models relate the three-phase flow from
the well on test with signals from the
wellhead instrumentation, such as
tubinghead pressures and temperatures,
lift-gas injection rates, and production
choke openings.
The software application automatically retrieves well test and instrumentation signals from associated production data systems such as supervisory
control and data acquisition systems,
distributed control systems, or historian
systems.

a model for each well, the software application uses the model to automatically compute oil, gas, and water rates for
each well. The application also retrieves
bulk, fiscal station oil, gas, and water
signals from production data systems
and then performs a continuous material balance in which the well flow’s
estimates provide the flow in and the
bulk measurement gives the flow out.
The ratio of total well-flow estimate
to total measured bulk/fiscal flow
equals the allocation factor.
The software application has an
intuitive graphical user interface for operator data load/display and well-model
configuration and validation. The process automatically uploads subsequent
well tests into the application for model
validation or updating. Algorithms
within the application automatically
indicate when a model requires updating (retesting).

number of advantages, such as simplicity of the approach and how it incorporates and extends the conventional well
testing process. The process requires
no numerical assumptions about the
underlying physics of the well.
In an operational environment with
limited engineering resources, the process does not require frequent wellhead
instrumentation calibration. The application only requires repeatable well
measurements; within limits. Absolute
measurement accuracy is not critical.
To ensure robustness, the application
creates several independent data driven
models for each well using different
inputs such as multiple fallback models
based on some or all of the following
parameters: wellhead pressure, wellhead temperature, manifold pressure,
bottomhole pressure. This allows
well estimates to continue should an
individual instrument fail. This also
allows the model to identify and report
malfunctioning instrumentation.

tion capacity can produce 50,000 bo/d

capacity can inject 70,000 b/d.
The wells are on five subsea manifolds each with two flowlines to the
FPSO. The production risers, connecting the flowlines to the FPSO, include
an option for gas lift if required.
The operation initially used the
traditional hydrocarbon accounting and
allocation approach. In this case, the
operators obtained well-interrupt times
from real-time pressure readings at the
subsea and FPSO DCS control systems
and hence these times were accurate
within reason.
Fig. 2 compares the traditional allocation approach with the continuous
flow estimation of oil, gas, and water.
As can be seen in this case, the old
method gave allocation factors which
erred 4% on the high side, whereas the
new method averaged 0.05% on the
low side.
The field operator subsequently
adopted continuous allocation.

O D U C T I O N

During the second and third years of
production, however, signals from the
other downhole flowmeters stopped or
became unreliable. The subsea venturis
also proved unreliable due to blocked
impulse lines, inadequate density measurement, and faulty associated instrumentation (tubinghead pressure and
temperature).
The combination of no data with
inaccurate data affected the understanding of the production from the field
and impeded allocating and optimizing
production.
Consequently the operator deployed
the FW PU to estimate continually the
highly variable production behavior of
each well’s oil, gas, and water flow.
Although the application had previous successes in subsea fields, this
subsea cluster required a new approach.
The 60-km long flowline resulted in a
time delay between the changes in bulk
meter and well variations, making it
difficult to effectively test wells.
As such, the challenge was to use the

This led to a recommendation to use
FW PU as a basis for production reporting and allocation for the field.

Multizonal smart wells.
The last example is from multizonal
smart wells. In this case, the application
uses the mechanical configuration, annulus and tubing downhole pressures,
and the associated inflow control valve
openings, for generating data-driven
models for individual zones in the
wells.
The zonal models then provide
production estimates for the individual
zones in real time, working from the
real-time downhole pressure gauge
readings and inflow-control-valve settings.
These zonal flow estimates are the
basis for the continuous allocation. The
software continuously compares the
sum of the allocation flows with the
total well production that may be measured with a multiphase flowmeter.
If a MFM is not installed, the operation assumes that total well flow is the
sum of the individual zonal flows and
then the process continuously compares
this sum along with FW PU-derived
flows for all other wells in a given field
with the measured total flows for that
field.
The building of the FW PU datadriven models for the zones requires a
series of specifically designed tests in
which test flows of individual zones
and combinations of zones of the smart
well flow to a surface test separator
or MFM. The test includes varying the
zonal ICV settings and recording the
downhole and surface pressures and
temperatures.
In general, well tests of zones flowing one zone at a time are inadequate
because the pressure regimes will be
different when all zones flow together.
The zones also interact with one another. It is therefore desirable to have
the zones flow together for at least part
of the test.
From the tests, the application can
derive models for estimating individual
zonal production for oil, gas, and water

On completion of the well testing and modeling, the models are
put online. Based on real-time data
on ICV positions as well as downhole
pressures, the zonal models estimate
production from each zone in real
time and report and allocate produced
volumes daily.
Fig. 4 illustrates the individual zonal
liquid flow continuously estimated by
the application. The figure shows well
flow estimate as the numeric sum of
the individual zonal estimate and the
total well flow periodically measured
by the test separator. As can be seen,
the FW PU estimated total of the zonal
flows matches well with the test separator measured flow. ✦

that results from new data received for

agreed on details for expanding the
Refiniaria Potiguar Clara Camarao to
boost its installed capacity and deploy a
gasoline production unit (OGJ Online,
Nov. 19, 2009).
The 30,000-b/d refinery, which
already produces LPG, diesel fuel, and
aviation kerosine, will also produce
petrochemical naphtha and other
products, along with enough gasoline
to make Rio Grande do Norte selfsufficient.
The upgrade will allow the refin-

ery to produce 21,000 cu m/month of
gasoline, 45,000 cu m/month of diesel,
7,500 cu m/month of aviation kerosine,
11,700 cu m/month of LPG, and 3,000
cu m/month of chemical naphtha.
• In the Middle East, Kuwait reported an increase in capacity at its
three refineries, to 936,000 b/cd for
2009, up by 46,800 b/cd over 2008.
That increase also represents the total
net increase for the Middle East.
• In Asia, new data for two refineries in South Korea—Yeosu and
Onsan—and Taiwan, at Mailiao, added
a net increase for the region of 115,000
b/cd.
And more Asian capacity is in the
works.

Special Report

Climate change efforts to hit US industry hard
Trends noted in this report—recently
falling US capacity and utilization and
rising Asian and Middle Eastern capacity—come at a difficult time for US
refiners, as the US Congress prepares
to craft climate-change legislation for
debate in 2010.
A recent analysis by industry consultancy Wood Mackenzie, Edinburgh,
compared the impact on the US refining industry of the US House of Representatives’ HR2454 (Waxman-Markey)
with the impact starting in 2013 of
Phase III of the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme (OGJ, Nov. 2,
2009, p. 30).
Key conclusions of the study are the
following:
• The US allocation of free credits is
much less generous than its European
counterpart, which is the primary driver
for the US industry being “materially
disadvantaged.”
• Higher fuel costs (projected for
the near term) will not materially affect
oil-product demand; other legislative
measures (auto fleet efficiency and
low-carbon fuels standards) will be
much more significant.

• Waxman-Markey threatens to disrupt the US refining industry through
its provisions on intrastate trade. This
could offer significant advantages to
long-haul gasoline exporters and thus
prompt rationalization in the US refining industry. “That would be contrary
to US interests of improving its security of supply,” said the report.
Even if this intrastate provision in
the bill is removed, said Wood Mackenzie, the “costs of carbon increase
overall operating costs and thus
significantly reduce future cash flows
and hence enterprise value” of the US
refining industry.

Allocation effects
The analysis further noted that the
proposed Waxman-Markey bill allocates the refining industry 2% of total
emission credits for the entire US
economy. The refining allocation thus
equates to “about 100 million tons in
2015, less than 5% of carbon emissions
from the production and consumption
of transportation fuels” in the US.

The legislation makes the refiner
responsible for buying the additional
credits associated with the stationary (refinery) sources and also “the
emissions associated with consumption of the various transportation and
commercial fuels by end-users (vehicle
drivers, residential consumers, industry, etc.).”
Moreover, emissions allocated to US
refining only provide around 30% of its
stationary emissions, if the additional
burden of credits on transportation
fuels is entirely passed to the end-user.
Wood Mackenzie concluded,
therefore, that US refiners will need to
purchase more than 2 billion tonnes of
credits in 2015, based on expectations
of US oil-product demand and refinery
utilization.
The report correctly cautions that
US climate legislation has a long road
ahead of it and will be taken up only
after contentious health-care and
financial regulations debates. Nonetheless, the report also correctly notes the
US Environmental Protection Agency
is moving ahead with regulations
governing CO2 emissions from mobile
sources, soon to be followed by rules
for stationary sources.

Last month, Pakistan Minister for Petroleum and Natural Resources Naveed
Qamar told the country’s National Assembly that three refineries with a total
capacity of 465,000 b/d “are in the
pipeline” (OGJ, Nov. 16, 2009, p. 12).
Included are the 250,000-b/d Khalifa
Coastal refinery and the 115,000-b/d
Bosicor Oil Pakistan Ltd. plant, both
in Hub, Balochistan Province; and the
100,000-b/d Trans-Asia Refinery Ltd.
plant at Port Qasim in Karachi.

Refinery closures, delistings
As the global recession took hold
during 2009, oil demand fell and crude
inventories expanded. With the year
winding to its end, refinery curtailments and shutdowns became more
and more likely.

The only shutdown OGJ’s survey
reflects this year was in March by
Nihonkai Oil Co. Ltd. at its 57,000-b/cd
50

Toyama, Japan, refinery. The company
plans to convert the plant to an oil
terminal. It was the smallest refinery

owned by the Nippon Oil group (OGJ,
Aug. 3, 2009, p. 44).
Several refiners, mainly among
hard-hit US operators, have announced
reduced utilization, periodic idling of
units, planned temporary shutdowns,
and one permanent closing.
In March of this year, Motiva Enterprises LLC announced it was delaying
for more than 2 years the completion
target for addition of a single-train
crude distillation unit that will add
325,000 b/cd of capacity to its Port Arthur, Tex., refinery. Added to its current
capacity of 285,000 b/d, the project
will make the refinery the largest in the
US.
A joint venture of Shell Oil Co. and
Saudi Refining Inc., Motiva originally
planned to complete the $7 billion
expansion late next year.
In June, Valero Energy Corp. announced suspension of plans to add
hydrocrackers at its 250,000-b/d Port
Arthur refinery and its 310,000-b/d St.
Charles, La., refinery. At Port Arthur,
plans were to add a 50,000-b/d hydrocracker for an estimated $1.7 billion.
At St. Charles, Valero planned a new
50,000-b/d hydrocracker to cost $1.25
billion (OGJ Online, June 4, 2009).
In September, the company also
announced it was shutting down the
coker and gasifier complex at the
210,000-b/cd refinery at Delaware City,
Del., operated by its Premcor Refining Group Inc. subsidiary. This step
followed an earlier shut down of the
coker and fluid catalytic cracking unit
at its 315,000-b/d Corpus Christi, Tex.,
refinery (OGJ Online, Sept. 9, 2009).
But the moves at the Delaware City
refinery proved insufficient, and last
month Valero Energy permanently
closed the plant, citing financial losses
caused by “very poor economic conditions, significant capital spending requirements, and high operating costs”
(OGJ Online, Nov. 20, 2009). The
closure will be reflected in OGJ’s 2010
survey results.
In fourth-quarter 2009, the company
said, it will report a pretax charge of
$1.7-1.8 billion, related primarily to

“asset impairment,” employee severance, and other shutdown costs.
Valero estimates the shutdown will
reduce pretax operating expenses by
about $450 million in 2010, including
$125 million of noncash costs, and will
reduce capital spending and turnaround
costs by about $200 million through
2010.
Shutting down the refinery’s gasifier
and coking operations to improve reliability and financial performance did
not sufficiently improve profitability,
said Valero Chairman and CEO Bill
Klesse last month.
In October, Sunoco Inc., Philadelphia, announced it was idling its
150,000-b/d Eagle Point refinery at
Westville, NJ. The refinery is interconnected with Sunoco’s refineries at Philadelphia and Marcus Hook, Pa., which
form a complex capable of processing
655,000 b/d of crude oil (OGJ Online,
Oct. 6, 2009).
Last month, Western Refining Inc.,
El Paso, announced plans to consolidate
two small refineries in New Mexico to
reduce operating costs. At Gallup, Western will consolidate the 23,000-b/d refinery there and the 17,000-b/d facility
at Bloomfield, which will be idled.
Elsewhere, earlier this year, Kuwait
canceled plans to build a 630,000-b/d
fourth refinery at Al Jour on the Persian
Gulf coast near the Saudi Arabia border.
The refinery, earlier expected to cost
$10 billion but later raised to $15 billion and rebid, had been scheduled to
start in 2013 (OGJ, Nov. 12, 2007, p. 32;
OGJ Online, Mar. 23, 2009).
And last month, in Germany, ConocoPhillips confirmed plans to delay
an upgrade at its 260,000-b/d Wilhelmshaven refinery. The company had
planned to add a coker, hydrocracker,
and hydrogen units to the refinery,
which it acquired in 2006 from Louis
Dreyfus Refining & Marketing Ltd.
(OGJ Online, Nov. 18, 2009).

literature,1 2 the method proposed here
provides simple rules for welders with
little background in magnetism.
Technicians measured residual magnetic field levels of different pipelines
in southern Mexico in the gap following girth-cut of damaged sections and
in the V-groove following insertion of
the new sections. FEMM3 performed
54

magnetic finite element simulations
for residual magnetic field compensation using real-life pipeline dimensions and field parameters. Simulations used variables such as residual
magnetic field in the groove, number
of coil turns required for the residual
magnetic field compensation, DC current flowing through the coil and the
electrode, position of the coil relative
to the groove, and pipeline WT and
OD. Results allowed development of an
empirical predictive equation for the
magnetic field required to compensate
for the residual magnetic field in the
weld groove.
Most of the procedures developed
in the past adjusted current in order to
compensate for the magnetic field in
the groove, a disadvantage during DC
arc welding since the electrodes’ specifications do not cover a wide range of
current values. The method proposed
here supersedes this disadvantage by
making it possible to properly select the
number of coil turns and the position
of the coil relative to the groove to
compensate for residual magnetic field
in the groove.

explains the influence of each variable
in the compensation process. The applied magnetic field Ha (nI) necessary
for compensation is inversely proportional to WT (t) and OD (D) of the
pipeline and directly proportional to
the position of the coil x0.
Equation 1 reduces to a simple expression when real-life conditions are
taken into account. The compensation
procedure aims to apply a magnetic
field (Ha) counteracting the
residual magnetic field (Hg)
to obtain a resultant mag(1)

fixed parameters for each
particular case. Operators
generally intend to optimize system
performance by wrapping the coil as
closely as possible to the groove. Bearing these parameters and intents in
mind, Equation 1 turns into Equation
2, where A (Equation 3) is a constant
dependent on actual field parameters.
Equation 2 is a simple relationship
between the residual magnetic field
(Hg) in the groove and the amount of
energy (nI) required to avoid arc blow.
Equation 2 yields graphs with sets
of curves for the compensation of any
value of the residual magnetic field in
the groove. Fig. 5, for example, shows
two sets of curves obtained for different pipeline WT, OD, and compensation coil position. Applying Equation
1 to all possible ranges of the variables
considered in the model would yield
a complete set of such graphs making
graphs similar to those shown in Fig. 5
for different combinations of the field
parameters (t, D, I) and variables (n,
x0) available to operators and providing

New natural gas engine for pumping use
The new AJAX E-565 natural gas engine
is a rugged one cylinder, two-cycle version that’s suited for pumping applications
in a variety of different operating conditions.
The company says the engine can operate efficiently using a range of fuel gas
including H2S warranted up to 2.5%. The
E-565 meets all current federal US emissions standards, the firm points out.
This 40 hp unit is rated at 56 braked
mean effective pressure at 525 rpm with
a 6:1 compression ratio. It comes with an
automotive starter, a Ringfeder Corp. flywheel to crankshaft locking device, which
the firm says provides an easier, safer way
to remove the flywheel during maintenance, an Altronic Inc. I ignition system,
and a standard “dry” type air filter.

New software aids oil company planning
Newly released of Merak enterprise

planning (MEP) software is a next-generation technology that enables dynamic
oil and gas business planning, including
event-driven or evergreen plans.
The firm says, “With MEP, oil and gas
companies can get fast answers to complex business questions for improved decision making. This software helps clients
to proactively respond to changing market
and operational conditions to achieve
growth objectives.”
In a preliminary field test with a
large integrated, independent oil and gas
company, MEP demonstrated 50% reduction in project processing time, increased
confidence in results, and 75% reduction
in analysis time, the firm noted.
MEP uses an oil and gas data management cube to align strategy with plans
and budgets—simultaneously integrating
reserves, production, and financial data—
to reveal business insights for timely
decisions based on continually updated
business plans.
MEP leverages Microsoft Corp. technol-

ogies to provide a collaborative platform
for oil and gas business applications to
generate valuable information in context
using a calculation engine. Its data aggregation and mining capabilities deliver
business intelligence and performance
analytics in the context of an oil and gas
enterprise.

Software update aids reservoir estimates
EnABLE 2.3 estimation software promises to provide a better understanding and
measurement of uncertainty in reservoir
production performance estimates.
Using an advanced statistical framework and proxy model, based on conventional reservoir simulations, EnABLE
provides E&P companies with a rapid
understanding of production behavior and
the creation of uncertainty forecasts, the
company says.

Superior communication and interpersonal skills, demonstrated leadership capabilities, the ability to engage in collaborative research, and the ability to motivate and
inspire students and colleagues are required attributes. The successful candidate will strengthen, and capitalize on, Missouri S&T’s strong ties with industry, educational
institutions, and federal and state agencies and build relationships with each.

Iranian political
mood swings back
toward the brink
Since the revolution of 1979, Iran’s
political mood has cycled several times
toward and away from upheaval. Now, the
Islamic republic finds itself yet again on
the brink.
Pressure on the mullahs who run the
country comes from several directions.
Increasingly alarmed by Iranian efforts
to develop nuclear weapons, external
powers threaten to tighten trade sanctions

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

against the defiant theocracy. France, in
particular, has hardened its position.
“There is no longer any reason to wait,”
the country’s ambassador to the United
Nations, Gerard Araud, told the Security
Council this month.
His country, the US, and Great Britain
have met resistance to toughened sanctions from the other permanent Security
Council members, Russia and China,
which say they want to persuade Iran by
other means to quit enriching uranium.
Inside Iran, meanwhile, protests have
spread and intensified—along with reprisals from the government and the thugs
who enforce its oppression.
The Iranian citizenry is clearly tired of
tyranny, rigged elections, and economic
hardship. Protests have begun to target
the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rather than political figures.
Iranians also seem to have had enough
of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and
his claims to be preparing for return of the
12th Imam, a messianic figure of Shi’ite
Islam. For doubters, those preparations
too frequently involve violent encounters
with the Revolutionary Guard and “basij”
militia, sometimes ending in notoriously
cruel prisons.
Fractures, meanwhile, have widened
in the power structure. No less a figure
than former President Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani, who backed a challenger to
Ahmadinejad in disputed June elections,
has spoken against the regime of which he
remains an important part, lately declaring
it to be in crisis. For that, he provoked an
ominous rebuke from Intelligence Minister
Heydar Moslehi, who said this week,
“Those who themselves are in crisis think
the country is in crisis.” He went on to declare, as “an informed official,” that “there
is no crisis in the country.”
Such heavy-handedness probably plays
well among the powerful mullahs in Qom.
Other citizens of Iran, where oil production averaged 3.7 million b/d in November,
probably see things differently.

Iraq, Nigeria oil output increasing
After years of losses because of war and revolution, oil production in Iraq and
Nigeria is starting to increase. “Although we see the potential for the sharpest
near-term gains in Nigeria, Iraq is making significant progress on deals with international oil companies that could double production there over the next 5 years,”
said Adam Sieminski, chief energy economist, Deutsche Bank AG, Washington,
DC.
“Geologists have long believed that Iraq’s reserves could rival those of Saudi
Arabia (where production could easily go to 11 million b/d from today’s 8.5 million
b/d),” Sieminski said. “We believe Iraq could be producing 2.5 million b/d in 2010,
but it could be more than twice that by 2016. Fields in Iraq like West Qurna and
Majnoon are world-class, and they are undeveloped. As [analysts at Wood Mackenzie Ltd., Edinburgh,] observed, Iraq remains among the most challenging places
in the world to do business—logistically, operationally, legally, and politically. But
the potential returns are huge, if the companies can manage the risks.”
Iraq has not yet regained its production level previous to the US-led invasion
in 2003. In June, however, BP PLC teamed with China National Petroleum Corp.
in a successful bid for Rumaila oil field with 17.8 billion bbl in oil reserves and the
potential to hike Iraqi production past 4 million b/d within a few years, WoodMac
analysts said.
Earlier this month, Royal Dutch Shell PLC joined with Malaysia’s Petronas to
secure rights to Manjoon field in the Basra region, one of the largest oil fields in
the world, beating out a consortium of France’s Total SA and CNPC. However, a
consortium of CNPC, Total, and Petronas won a deal to develop Iraq’s giant Halfaya
oil field in the country’s second bidding round since 2003.
In April, the Centre for Global Energy Studies in London said Iraq would need to
invest $28-43 billion in order to raise its oil production capacity to 6 million b/d.
Nigeria rebounds
The International Energy Agency earlier reported Nigerian production fell to
1.68 million b/d in July, its lowest level in 2 decades and well below its hypothetical
capacity of 3 million b/d.
By the end of summer, however, the Movement for the Emancipation of the
Niger Delta agreed to a cease-fire under the Nigerian government’s amnesty offer
to militants. Production responded quickly, with November output estimated at 2
million b/d. “With natural gas liquids output at close to 400,000 b/d and also growing, Nigeria seems set for a period of relatively strong growth,” Sieminski said.
“Total Nigerian oil production could come in at 2.5 million b/d in 2010 in our
view,” he said. “Although we harbor some concerns about the ability of the government and MEND to stick to maintaining the cease-fire, the agreement is already
beating skeptics’ estimates for duration.” WoodMac, a former Deutsche Bank subsidiary, assumes there will be some easing of funding constraints but operational
delays on certain projects will continue. “Furthermore, it seems likely that Shell’s
shut-in fields in the Forcados region will only reach around two thirds of its previous output. Nevertheless, WoodMac believes that total oil, condensate, and LPG
production could reach circa 3 million b/d in 2016,” said Sieminski.
Biofuel expansion
Meanwhile, the US government’s strategic decision to increase the role of
biofuels—“specifically ethanol”—in the country’s energy mix has had “a powerful
effect on demand side fundamentals” in corn and soybean markets, said Deutsche
Bank analysts. According to the US Department of Agriculture, the US ethanol
industry will be responsible for just over 50% of global corn consumption growth
in 2009. “Today more than 30% of the US corn harvest is used for ethanol production. Given US Federal government targets, this could rise to as high as 40% by
2015, or 5.5 billion bushels,” analysts said.
To achieve the targets for US ethanol production, they said, “We expect the US
Environmental Protection Agency will increase the current 10% blend of ethanol
in gasoline use by 5 percentage points from the middle of next year. This would
not only increase ethanol consumption by approximately 7 billion gal, but it would
also avert the US ethanol industry from hitting the ‘blend wall’…when ethanol
production and use is equal to 10% of the country’s gasoline supply. We believe
the increasing use of corn for ethanol production will sustain corn inventories at
critically low levels and consequently sustain the price spike risk in this market.”

Exhibit Today
Expanding Sustainably
Growth requires the oil sands and heavy oil industry to make steady, long-term
progress along a narrow road for which no map exists.
On one side loom the high costs of extracting, processing, and transporting
unconventional hydrocarbons.
On the other side are environmental performance standards that toughen with
time and that the industry never must fail to meet.
Each step along this road requires innovation. Each must withstand
unpredictable economic changes. Each must uphold eternal values of nature
and society.

On this road, the beacon for progress is technology, advances in which will
control the costs, improve the environmental performance, and assure the
sustainability of an industry crucial to oil supplies – now and in the future.
The Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition is the
premier showcase for the knowledge and methods of this fascinating business.
Take this opportunity to present your product or service to a powerful, influential
audience. Join PennWell Petroleum Events in this fourth year conference and
exhibition.

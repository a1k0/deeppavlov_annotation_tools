Arbitration move called ‘forum shopping’
Lawyers for Ecuadorian plaintiffs in an environmental lawsuit
against Chevron Corp. have dismissed the company’s filing of an
international arbitration claim as “forum shopping” (OGJ Online,
Sept. 24, 2009).
Steven Dozinger, a New York lawyer representing the Amazon
communities suing Chevron, made the statement while calling
the company’s move “one of Chevron’s last cards to avoid paying
for a half-century of environmental contamination in Ecuador’s
Amazon.”
The lawsuit started in 1993, targeting Texaco Petroleum (Texpet), a member of a consortium that had produced oil under a
concession that ended in 1992. State-owned Petroecuador replaced
Texpet as operator in 1990.
Chevron, which took over Texpet’s parent Texaco Inc. in 2001,
says it is being held accountable for environmental damaged
caused by Petroecuador. It says Texpet spent $40 million on environmental clean-up and received a release of liability from the
Ecuadorian government before leaving the country.
It further alleges corruption of the Ecuadorian judicial system.
The lawsuit will be decided in a court in the small town of Lago
Agrio.
Damage claims, based on estimates by a court appointee, exceed $27 billion.
Dozinger, a law school friend of and fund-raiser for US President Barack Obama, said Chevron’s filing for international arbitration will not affect the legal case.
He listed legal decisions against Chevron, saying they “help
explain the company’s timing in filing the arbitration claim.”
And he said outcome of the arbitration move won’t affect plans
to seize Chevron’s assets if the company loses the lawsuit.
“This could end up being one of the biggest forced asset seizures in history, and it could have a significant disruptive impact
on the company’s operations,” he said.

companies with stock traded on US exchanges to report payments
to foreign governments for oil, gas, and mineral extraction in
their regular Securities and Exchange Commission filings.
The measure is designed to prevent governments in countries
rich with natural resources from hiding payments they receive
from energy and mineral producers to finance corrupt activities,
the lawmakers said.
“History shows that oil and gas reserves and minerals can be
a bane, not a blessing, for poor countries, leading to corruption,
wasteful spending, military adventurism, and instability,” said
Richard P. Lugar (R-Ind.), ranking minority member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee and the bill’s primary sponsor.
“Too often, oil money intended for a nation’s poor lines the
pockets of the rich or is squandered on showcase projects instead
of productive investments,” he continued.
Sens. Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.), Russell J. Feingold (D-Wis.),
Charles E. Schumer (D-NY), and Roger F. Wicker (R-Miss.) cosponsored the measure.

Comments on 5-year OCS plan surpass 530,000

The number of public comments on the US Minerals Management Service’s evolving 5-year Outer Continental Shelf plan has
surpassed 530,000, MMS Director S. Elizabeth Birnbaum said on
Sept. 25.
The US Department of the Interior agency received the comments after Interior Secretary Ken Salazar added 6 months on Feb.
10 to obtain additional input on a draft proposed plan that his
predecessor, Dirk A. Kempthorne, launched in late summer 2008.
MMS had counted more than 350,000 submissions after the extended comment period expired on Sept. 21, Birnbaum said (OGJ
Online, Sept. 24, 2009). The total passed 530,000 after the agency
reviewed more submissions, including several which had been
mailed at the last minute, she indicated.
She said it will probably take several weeks to review and analyze the comments. After that time, the agency will initiate enviBill seeks disclosure of foreign payments

Five US senators have introduced a bill which would require proposed plan, Birnbaum said. ✦

Montana’s Elm Coulee to top 200 million bbl
Elm Coulee field, Montana’s primary Bakken shale oil producing field discovered in 2000, is a giant that is expected to recover
more than 200 million bbl.
The field has more than 600 wells that produce primarily from
the middle Bakken, Stephen Sonnenberg and Aris Pramudito of
the Colorado School of Mines wrote in the American Association
of Petroleum Geologists Bulletin.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Elm Coulee has produced 78.4 million bbl of 42° gravity oil
and 55.7 bcf of gas through December 2008. Oil in place is estimated at 5 million bbl/sq mile.
The Bakken total interval, consisting of an upper shale, middle
silty dolostone, and lower siltstone, is 10-50 ft thick with 8-14
ft of vertical pay, and the field covers 450 sq miles in Richland
County.
Initial production is 200-1,900 b/d at horizontal wells and

Weatherford’s downhole multiphase ﬂowmeters allow full through-bore access

Unique measurement
principle enables
bidirectional ﬂow and

without modiﬁcation
to the meter or surface
acquisition systems
to measure interzonal
crossﬂow in multizonal
completions and detect
water and/or gas in wateralternating-gas injectors.

using 100 percent optical technology. That means no ﬂowing pressure loss and
a high resilience to erosion and corrosion. Our ﬂowmeters are intrinsically safe,
with no electrical energy downhole or at the wellhead. The result is the most
reliable, accurate, real-time measurement of downhole liquid and gas ﬂow rate.
You’ll save time and money and build better production over the life of your well.
Now that’s ﬂow measurement. That’s Weatherford.

“The Elm Coulee field illustrates that the Bakken petroleum
system has enormous potential for future oil discoveries in the
Williston basin,” the authors wrote.
Bakken oil production predated Elm Coulee at Antelope field
in 1953 and Elkhorn Ranch field in 1961, both in North Dakota.
Elkhorn Ranch field had the play’s first horizontal well, in the upper Bakken in 1987.

BLM seeks views on Tumbleweed II gas project
The US Bureau of Land Management will open a public comment period on Sept. 30 on an environmental analysis of the proposed Tumbleweed II natural gas project in eastern Utah, BLM’s
Vernal, Utah, field office announced.
It said that the project area contains 7,655 acres 32 miles south
of Ouray, Utah, about 45 acres of which would be disturbed by
the proposed development.
The applicant, Denver-based Stewart Petroleum Corp., plans to
construct six well pads, drill eight gas wells, and construct 4.2
miles of new or upgraded road and 12.3 miles of pipelines, according to the BLM field office.
It said that it will accept comments on the EA, which it will
post online, through Oct. 16.

Cabot ordered to cease Marcellus fracs
State regulators ordered Cabot Oil & Gas Corp., Houston, to
cease hydraulic fracturing in northeastern Pennsylvania in connection with surface spills.
After three spills in one week, the Pennsylvania Department
of Environmental Protection ordered Cabot to develop within 14
days an updated and accurate Pollution Prevention and Contingency Plan and Control and Disposal Plan for all permitted well
pad sites in Susquehanna County.
The department required Cabot to perform an engineering
study of all equipment and work practices associated with hydraulic fracturing at all wellsites in the county within 21 days. The
study must include a detailed evaluation and explanation of the
causes of the three spills and establish corrective measures.
Cabot is required to implement within 21 days recommendations and requirements contained in DEP’s approved Pollution
Prevention and Contingency Plan, the Control and Disposal Plan,
and the engineering study.
The company also must place the approved Pollution Prevention and Contingency Plan and Control and Disposal Plan in a
conspicuous location at each permitted wellsite and provide a
copy to each contractor and subcontractor working at any wellsite.

(Area A in the Gulf of Suez and the East Ras Qattara and Burg el
Arab concessions, both in the Western Desert), one development
asset (Abu Sennan in the Western Desert), and an early exploration
asset (Block 6 in Southern Egypt).
In Yemen, KEC has one producing asset (Block 43, onshore,
Central Yemen) and interests in six exploration assets, all onshore
in Central Yemen with the exception of Block 15 (off Al Mukalla
in the Gulf of Aden). Block 43 is expected to cease production
shortly.
The company recently announced oil discoveries at Shukheir
Northwest in Area A along the Gulf of Suez coast and Shahd Southeast and Rana Southeast in the East Ras Qattara south of Alexandria. It plans to drill five exploration wells and five development
wells before yearend.
In August, the company reported a new oil field, Al Zahraa,
in East Ras Qattara. It was KEC’s fourth discovery in the country,
producing 2,615 b/d of oil, and is operated by Sipetrol. KEC has a
49.5% working interest.
According to the company’s second quarter results, it was producing an average of 1,120 boe/d of oil in Yemen.
The IFC and Kuwait Energy have drafted a detailed environmental and social action plan for Egypt and Yemen. “The environmental and social management plan will be implemented over the
next year in a series of gradual steps starting this month, September 2009,” an IFC spokesman told OGJ.
The bank will also assist with a potential listing on an international stock exchange in 2010 by carrying out an in-depth corporate governance assessment of Kuwait Energy.
Established in Kuwait in August 2005, Kuwait Energy is an independent petroleum company with operations across the Middle
East, North Africa, Eastern Europe, and Pakistan. ✦

Contractors and subcontractors cannot begin work at any wellsite
until they receive the two plans.
Cabot is cooperating with the agency, said Dan O. Dinges,
chairman, president, and chief executive officer.
“The only acceptable practice for Cabot is to be in full compliance with all environmental and regulatory policy; therefore, we
are working cooperatively with the regulators,” Dinges said.
Cabot, which said its drilling and production operations aren’t
affected, said its Marcellus production reached a high of 52 MMcfd
at the end of last week. The company is drilling seven wells.
“Contributing to the increase was our most recent horizontal completion which experienced a 24-hr initial production rate
greater than 10 MMcfd and a 30-day average rate of 10.8 MMcfd,”
said Dinges. The well is making 11.1 MMcfd.
The combination of this well, other primarily vertical completions, and initial production streams from two horizontal wells
that are cleaning up led to the 52 MMcfd rate.
From the first seven horizontal wells that have been producing
for varying time frames, two have produced more than 1 bcf, and
combined those two wells have a 90-day production average of 6
MMcfd.
Separately, DEP issued a notice of violation to Cabot for the

Tesoro reports fire knocked out at refinery
A fire that erupted early Sept. 28 in the coking unit of Tesoro
Corp.’s 100,000-b/cd Wilmington, Calif., refinery, has been extinguished, the San Antonio-based company reported.
No injuries have been reported, Tesoro said, adding that the
cause of this incident is under investigation and the amount of
damage to the affected unit is unknown at this time. “Other units
at the refinery are currently operating but at reduced rates,” the
company said. Tesoro acquired the refinery from Shell Oil Products US in early 2007 (OGJ Online, Jan. 29, 2007). ✦

AIPN publishes model form for LNG sales
Publication of a new model form master LNG sale and purchase agreement by the nonprofit Association of International Petroleum Negotiators aims at creation of a secondary market for
LNG that will “facilitate trading and arbitrage of LNG cargoes.”
The agreement form helps the industry establish a “uniform
short-term and spot sales agreement,…thereby reducing transaction time, cost, and uncertainty,” said the announcement.
Publication concludes an effort to “create a model contract
that balances the interests of sellers and buyers, is geographically
neutral, and contains all of the provisions that most parties will
require” in a master LNG sale and purchase agreement. It includes
alternatives and options as well as guidance notes for users.
The move caps 3 years of effort by AIPN’s drafting committee
that consisted of more than 150 industry representatives, including members from many of the major LNG sellers, buyers, transporters, and traders worldwide, according to the announcement
of the association’s board of directors. The committee, cochaired
by Steven Miles of Baker Botts LLP, Houston, and Harry W. Sullivan Jr., ConocoPhillips, Houston, held more than 15 meetings and
five workshops in seven countries on five continents.
According to the association, this form is the latest in a “series
of hydrocarbon-related model contracts” it has published to “facilitate the negotiation of energy transactions around the globe.”
Founded in 1981, AIPN has 2,600 members in more than 80
countries, representing international oil and gas companies, governments, law firms, multilateral organizations, and academic
institutions.

million (Aus.). The contract is a critical component in the GorgonJansz construction phase and will require complex engineering to
meet the environmental challenges of the project.
The $43 billion (Aus.) Gorgon-Jansz development on Barrow
consists of a three-train LNG plant producing a total of 15 million
tonnes/year of LNG as well as a 300-TJ/day domestic gas plant.
First LNG is due in 2014 and domestic gas by the end of 2015.

Pemex lets contract for Chicontepec pipeline
Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) awarded a $12.4 million contract
to Insituform Technologies Inc.’s Mexican joint venture United
Pipeline de Mexico de CV (UPM) for construction, replacement,
and rehabilitation of about 40 km of pipelines in Mexico’s Chicontepec oil region. Insituform subsidiaries Corrpro Cos. Inc. and
Bayou Co. Inc. will provide cathodic protection and field joint
coating services for the project.
Insituform expects work on this project to begin in November
and to take about 16 months to complete. UPM will oversee new
construction, including corrosion protection services, and rehabilitation of more than 24 km of pipeline using Insituform’s proprietary Tite Liner polyethylene lining system. The new and rehabilitated pipelines will transfer Chicontepec oil from wellheads to
production facilities. Insituform acquired Bayou and Corrpro in
February and March, respectively.
Analysts previously reported Mexico’s Energy Minister Georgina Kessel saying the country would have to reevaluate its strategy for Chicontepec given production shortfalls. Reports indicated
Chicontepec would produce 60,000 b/d of oil by yearend against a
previous forecast of 72,000 b/d (OGJ Online, Sept. 8, 2009). ✦

LNG power contract let to Tag Pacific
Tag Pacific Ltd., Sydney, through its subsidiary MPower, has

and commissioning of a 28-Mw electric power generation plant
to be used for the construction and commissioning phase of the
megaproject. TAG says it is possible the Gorgon joint venture will
increase the scope of the contract, bumping the value up to $40

In other words, an engineer is first

one, especially an engineer, can simply

ethically, she would say, that engineer
must at all times be aware of the ethical
implications of that job.

And media?
Equally as professionals, journalists have ethical guidelines. Foremost
among them is to let facts tell the story
and to prevent one’s prejudices or
opinions from dictating what facts are
relevant.
Trade publications, such as OGJ,
that serve specific industries—they’re
known as “business-to-business” communications—have additional ethical
worries: Editors must resist commercial
efforts to influence what material is
selected or what topics are covered.
But, as for engineers, periods of contracting markets and intensified competition bring temptation with them. For
far too many publications, that slope is
simply far too slippery.
OGJ is different.
OGJ’s coverage of a topic or acceptance of an article is based solely on
the topic’s news or technical value, as
dictated by an editor’s understanding of
what OGJ’s readers expect.
OGJ editors take their responsibility to readers as seriously as any
professionals anywhere, and the
magazine’s management fully supports them. ✦

Confusion over subsidies
US President Barack Obama summoned the oil
and gas industry to two tasks when he called last
month for an end to subsidies for fossil energy.
One is to address confusion over the meaning
of “subsidy.” The other is to force attention to a
central motive of Obama’s appeal.
Subsidies take many forms. The US government
provides a subsidy when it suspends royalty for
initial production of oil and gas from deep waters
of the Gulf of Mexico. The Iranian government
provides a subsidy when it caps the price of gasoline. Economically, these two types of subsidy are
poles apart. One encourages production; the other
encourages consumption.

Shunning distinctions
Many other methods of subsidization are in
place worldwide, not all of them as clearly definable as royalty relief and price controls. Their
effects vary. In the US, for example, percentage
depletion represents a subsidy to the extent it
enables an independent producer ultimately to
charge to depletion more than total spending on
a property. It’s vital to capital formation for small
producers. But the accounting method represents
much less subsidization of oil production, for
example, than a direct tax credit does of ethanol
blended into gasoline.
Politics shuns these distinctions. In his statement on ending fossil energy subsidies after the
G-20 summit in Pittsburgh last month, Obama
mentioned only one example: Indonesia’s politically difficult dismantling of fuel price caps. His
analysis seemed to aim at consumption subsidies
of that type. But then he cited US efforts, all of
which target production. The view thus seems
to be developing that all subsidies are alike, and
those applying to fossil energy must cease.
The oil and gas industry can’t let this confusion dominate political debate. If it does, any tax
measure that applies to oil and gas and that can be
branded a subsidy will be in jeopardy.
An example of the confusion that can arise on
this subject appeared in a September report on US
fuel subsidies by the Environmental Law Institute.
The report’s headline conclusion is that during
2002-08, subsidies to fossil fuels totaled $72 billion while subsidies to renewable energy amount24

ed to only $29 billion. The report’s authors regret
this disparity as contradictory to policy aspirations
on climate change and energy security.
Promoters of renewable energy will pounce
on the findings to seek more government help,
arguing that an increase in aid will be only fair in
view of what fossil-energy producers receive. The
study, however, doesn’t address what producers
receive. Instead, it assesses “subsidy value through
the cost of a subsidy to the government, rather
than through its value to the recipient.”
So $6.4 billion of the total fossil-energy “subsidy” represents block grants to states under the
Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.
And $6.2 billion of it is for the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve. The biggest single chunk is a $15.3 billion estimate of what the US government doesn’t
collect because of royalty payments to foreign
governments accounted for as income taxes and
therefore creditable against US taxes. Another major category is $14.1 billion in credits for production of nonconventional fuels, which mainly help
coal producers.
Much of that $72 billion subsidy total thus does
little for producers of oil and gas. The producing
industry, though, can expect to be bludgeoned
with the number in discussions about tax policy.
It will have to address exaggerations about timing
preferences, such as the ability to charge intangible drilling costs immediately to expense rather
than amortizing them over asset lives, the “subsidy” value of which relates mainly to the time
value of money.

Poisonous campaign
While seeking perspective in the subsidy
debate, producers also must confront the stated
reason Obama wants to press the issue. His
administration sees merit in cutting domestic production of oil and gas. It has adopted an extreme
environmental assertion that lowering production
ultimately lowers consumption of fuels that emit
greenhouse gases and thus should be a policy
goal.
An assault on vaguely defined subsidies
threatens to become a tool of that economically
poisonous campaign. Producers must not let it
happen. ✦

Knowledge is power.
At URS, we believe that the more involved you are with
a process from beginning to end, the better equipped you
are to provide solutions. So when it comes to meeting
today’s increasing demand for oil and gas, we bring proven
experience with us — from oil sands, gas production, and
petroleum reﬁning to constructing a facility, maintaining
one, or developing an expansion plan. Which is why, in the
Industrial & Commercial sector, more people are turning
to us to get it done. We are URS.

ment and quasigovernment entities.
While not always feasible, limit direct
reliance for services on government
entities or regimes with reputations for
human rights abuses. That is especially
true for security services, as corporate
ATS and other human rights cases—
as with Chevron, Shell, Occidental,
Unocal, and others—frequently arise
based on actions committed by police,
military, or paramilitary units actually
or allegedly operating on a company’s
behalf.
For companies that have no choice
but to rely on foreign governments
for various services that create human
rights concerns, strive to enter into
contracts or memorandums of understanding with relevant government
entities. Those agreements should delineate respective roles and responsibilities. If the company lacks the authority
to supervise or direct government
employees, or the selection or assignments of government personnel, make
that explicit.
Include, if possible, provisions stating clearly that all parties will comply
with pertinent domestic and international human rights laws and conventions, violations of those laws will be
investigated and reported to appropriate
authorities, and suspected wrongdoers
will be suspended from performing
work for the company pending the outcome of those inquiries. If government
entities will agree to provide relevant
employees with human rights training,
that is even better.
4. Watch for consolidations. The need
to carefully scrutinize third parties
extends in particular to consolidations. Far too often in the oil and gas
industry, human rights problems are
inherited from others. Given the state
of economy, mergers and partnerships
are increasing in frequency. Companies
with good balance sheets have started
to take advantage of the current situation to make acquisitions, which may
continue throughout the year.
Conducting effective due diligence
in those consolidation efforts is a
strategic necessity. A failure to include
30

human rights issues within the scope
of that review, particularly for partnerships with, or acquisitions of, companies without strong compliance programs or who operate in jurisdictions
without strong regulatory regimes,
is potentially catastrophic. It can lead
to a multimillion-dollar problem and
deeply tarnish reputations for problems
not of your making.
Just as with a third-party agent,
include human rights issues within the
scope of due diligence during the acquisition or investment process. Review
public materials for potential human
rights red flags. Determine whether
lawsuits have been filed against other
companies based on operations in the
region. Ask basic questions of management and local residents about conflicts, lawsuits, and incidents. Request
documents reflecting complaints, on or
near-site injuries, or company internal
or external investigations. A few simple
inquiries might help prevent a major
headache.
5. Be prepared for rapid response. Although some ATS cases are premised
on a pattern of conduct over a lengthy
period, most involve rapid responses to
pressure-filled situations.
To minimize potential exposure, it
is vital to be able to identify red flag
circumstances in their nascent state
and have a defined plan in place. That
plan should include a coordinated
effort between trained personnel at
the relevant location, informed public
relations staff, and knowledgeable legal
personnel. Include immediate notification requirements to this core group
and perhaps others when a red flag
situation erupts. Consider requiring
immediate investigations and, where
appropriate, recording known facts to
ensure an accurate record is made for
possible later use.
While many such inquiries may
be probed and handled internally, for
more serious matters, independent
external inspections may be warranted.
And of course, where actual misdeeds
are suspected, make sure to take immediate action.

Escalating hazard
Though the risk of a human rights
lawsuit will not disappear, particularly
in light of the growing litigation trend,
these steps, beyond corporate responsibility programs, will help you reduce
the likelihood of encountering this
escalating hazard. And where litigation
does occur, the possibility can be increased of obtaining an early dismissal
or a positive jury decision and countering the wave of negative publicity.
In other words, while ATS lawsuits
may continue to flow against multinational companies, responsible companies can mitigate their risks and work
proactively to avoid falling prey to the
trend. ✦

Boxer-Kerry climate bill arrives amid praise, criticism
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The US Senate’s latest effort to address global climate change emerged
after several weeks of anticipation as
Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and John F.
Kerry (D-Mass.) introduced their bill
on Sept. 30.
The measure immediately drew applause from environmental and other
organizations, and fire from oil and gas
associations and other business groups.
It also provided a basis for the Senate
to begin serious work in the next few
weeks to create a final bill, which probably will have to go to conference. The
House passed its own bill, HR 2454, by
seven votes on June 26.
“This bill addresses major challenges of our generation: protecting our
children and the Earth from dangerous pollution; putting America back in
control of our energy future; creating
the policies that will lead to millions
of new jobs; and through our example,
inspiring similar actions around the
world to avoid an unstable and dangerous future,” said Boxer, who chairs the
Senate Environment and Public Works
Committee.
“Global warming is our challenge,”
she urged during a press briefing with
Kerry, adding, “Economic recovery is
our challenge. American leadership is
our challenge. Let’s step up right now.
Let’s not quit until we have fulfilled our
responsibility to our children and our
grandchildren.”
Kerry said, “Our health, our security, our economy, our environment all demand we reinvent the way
America uses energy. Our addiction to
foreign oil hurts our economy, helps
our enemies, and risks our security. By
taking decisive action, we can and will
stop climate change from becoming a
‘threat multiplier’ that makes an already
dangerous world staggeringly more so.”

Party-line responses
Congressional responses generally
followed party lines on both sides of
the Capitol. US House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi (D-Calif.) called the bill “a strong
foundation for Senate action on our
clean-energy future.” Senate Republican
Conference Chairman LaMar Alexander
(Tenn.) called it “fancy, complicated
words for high-cost energy that sends
jobs overseas looking for cheap energy”
and suggested that Congress take “practical steps to produce low-cost, clean,
carbon-free energy and create jobs”
instead.
James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), the
Environment and Public Works Committee’s ranking minority member,
said that hearings on the bill should
be fair and open because the measure,
as introduced, lacks several important details. “While I’ve noted that the
Democrats have the votes to pass this
bill through the committee, that does
not mean Republicans will stand down.
We will expose this bill and its contents
throughout every step of this process,”
he said.
In her remarks to reporters, Boxer
said the first major part of the bill, formally known as Clean Energy Jobs and
American Power Act, includes authorizations, all of which would be eligible
for appropriations and some which are
eligible for both appropriations and
allowances.
“Some of these are enhanced from
the Waxman-Markey bill; some are
new,” Boxer said, referring to the
House’s bill which was cosponsored
by Energy and Commerce Committee
Chairman Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.)
and Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), who
chairs the committee’s Energy and
Environment Subcommittee.
Authorizations in the Senate bill
include investments in natural gas, new
electricity transmission infrastructure,
nuclear research and development and
worker training, and “green economic

development; agricultural and forestry offset opportunities; investments
in transit systems and incentives for
efficient hybrid and electric motor
vehicles; and “adaptation authorizations that include wildfire prevention,
flood control, water infrastructure, and
investments in coastal communities and
wildlife protection,” Boxer said.
“Our bill gives a much stronger role
to mayors and local governments,” she
added.

Allowances, incentives
The bill’s second major section
would set up what Boxer called “pollution reduction and investment incentives” containing “strong principles for
market transparency and oversight” and
setting up an offsets integrity office,
she continued. “Allowances in this section will be detailed in the chairman’s
mark,” she said.
“We have put into this section a
soft collar to address cost containment
and limit speculation while maintaining the environmental integrity of the
pollution cap. And our bill does not add
one penny to the deficit,” Boxer added.
Several witnesses at a Sept. 16 Senate
Energy and Natural Resources hearing
on a carbon cap-and-trade system’s potential economic impacts suggested that
a ceiling, or collar, would be needed as
well as a floor to price carbon credits
for trading.
The incentives are designed to keep
US businesses competitive as the country pursues the bill’s pollution reduction goals, the sponsors said. It would
mandate carbon emission cuts of 20%
by 2020 and 50% by 2050 from 2005
levels, according to an overview at the
Environment and Public Works Committee’s web site. It said that the system
would apply only to major polluters,
initially about 7,500 facilities which account for nearly 75% of total US carbon
emissions. “Over 98% of American

Environmental leaders applauded
the bill. Sierra Club Executive Director
Carl Pope called it an important step
forward, adding that he was pleased the
measure would set a strong, short-term
carbon reduction target and retain the
US Environmental Protection Agency
authority to regulate global warming
emissions. Natural Resources Defense
Council Pres. Frances Beineke said the
goal of a 20% cut in carbon emissions
by 2020 was “strong and achievable.”
American Petroleum Institute Pres.
Jack N. Gerard was more critical.
“Boxer-Kerry leaves unaddressed key
elements of how it intends to constrain
carbon emissions,” he said on Sept. 29
after examining an early copy of the
measure. “Unfortunately, it appears
to be following the pattern the House
followed, which resulted in a political
bidding process that picked winners
and losers.”

‘Goes further’
National Petrochemical & Refiners Association Pres. Charles T. Drevna
noted, “While the bill passed in the
House was controversial enough given
its ambitious reduction targets, the
Senate bill goes even further in seeking
more unrealistic reductions that will
impose onerous regulatory burdens on
domestic refiners amidst fierce global
competition and increased costs on the
driving public, farmers, and truckers.”
Drevna added, “The Senate proposal
also fails to harmonize existing federal
laws specifically by removing the preemption of New Source Performance
Standards for capped sources, which
means that large facilities will be subject to both the emissions cap and EPA
[New Source Performance Standard]
regulations. Like its House counterpart,
this bill will only further weaken our
nation’s energy security.”
America’s Natural Gas Alliance,
which represents 28 of the country’s

leading independent producers representing more than 40% of the nation’s
total gas supply, took a more positive
view. “The Clean Energy Jobs and
American Power Act provides a starting point with ‘natural gas placeholder’
language. The placeholder establishes a
new EPA program to provide financial
incentives to power projects that reduce
greenhouse gas emissions that are not
otherwise eligible for tax credits,” explained ANGA Pres. Rod Lowman.
Lowman said the bill includes provisions that will let ANGA help develop
language that effectively promotes gas
as part of the national climate solution.
“With the right policy incentives, natural gas can and should be the foundation of the solution for our energy future. Natural gas can provide dramatic
decreases in greenhouse gas emissions
and do so more quickly than any other
currently viable options. Natural gas
can also enhance our nation’s energy
security through increased use of natu-

‘Thinly veiled threat’
In floor remarks on Sept. 24 following a vote to refer proposed US Department of the Interior and EPA budgets,
which did not include her amendment
to the full Senate, Murkowski described
regulating GHG emissions under the
CAA as a “thinly veiled threat” against
the Senate to force climate legislation
action “regardless of where we are in
what remains an ongoing and incredibly important debate.”
She disputed charges by some environmental and other groups that she
was trying to keep EPA from fully using
its authority to regulate GHG emissions.
“Anyone who reads my amendment
will see that I went to great lengths to
ensure it does not lead to any unintended or adverse consequences,” she
said. “It has been drafted and redrafted
to limit one action by EPA, for one year,
and nothing else. I’ve been responsive
to bipartisan requests, even from members who I knew wouldn’t support this
amendment, because I am committed
to avoiding an overreach.”
But Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.),
who chairs the Senate Appropriations
Committee’s Interior, Environment, and
Related Agencies Subcommittee, responded that the proposal would have
created serious problems. “Many of us
viewed her amendment with substantial alarm,” she said, adding that EPA
Administrator Lisa P. Jackson sent her
a letter the night before indicating that
it would keep the agency from promulgated light-duty vehicle emission
standards if adopted.
“We can’t bury our heads in the
sand when it comes to climate change,”
Feinstein continued. “It makes no sense
to put an amendment on the floor
which would devastate EPA’s authority
to regulate [GHG] emissions while the
Environment and Public Works Committee is working on its own cap-andtrade bill.”
Murkowski said she offered her
amendment because a finding of significant deterioration under one CAA
section could be applied to others.

California’s
carbon fee

A

s federal lawmakers discussed
the mechanics of a proposed
federal greenhouse gas emissions
control program, the California Air
Resources Board (CARB) imposed the
nation’s first statewide carbon fee on
some 350 businesses.
Its purpose is to pay for implementing a program required under
a 2006 law to bring GHG emissions
within the state back to estimated
1990 levels by 2020. Part of the
initial collections will repay loans
incurred to get the GHG reduction
program going.
The targeted businesses represent
85% of the state’s total GHG emissions, CARB indicated. Estimated
costs would be $120/year for a fullservice grocery store, $17/year for
a family restaurant, and $9/year for
a 100-person office. Households
would pay another 77¢/year for gas
and electricity and 80¢/year for a car
driven 15,000 miles and getting 30
mpg.
The plan, which CARB adopted
at its Sept. 25 meeting, anticipates

US Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) to develop the Chemical Facility
Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) and
are working to implement them, the
letter continued. But the groups also
expressed “significant concerns” about
the three HR 2868 provisions.

Preemption removal
They said that Section 3109, which
would let state and local governments
adopt or enforce more-stringent standards than the federal government’s,
would increase companies’ financial
burdens without any significant increase in public safety.
“Federal preemption is critical to
the legislation’s overarching goals,” the
letter said. “Absent uniform national
standards, businesses will be subject to
a patchwork of differing and possibly
conflicting resolutions.”
It said Section 2116, which would
allow anyone to sue regulated facilities
or DHS to enforce compliance with the
act, unsuitably applies private rights
which are common in environmental
challenges to CFATS’s performanceoriented requirements.
“Furthermore, we share DHS’s
concerns that broad discovery rights in
federal lawsuits could lead to public disclosure of classified or highly
sensitive information that could assist
terrorists,” it indicated. “Such information likely would include the types and
amounts of chemicals stored at a facility, the specific locations of the chemicals, and the security measures in place
to protect the chemicals.”

IST provision
Finally, said the groups, they oppose
Section 2111 which would require
facilities covered under the bill to assess
so-called ISTs and to require chemical plants assigned to specific tiers to
implement these technologies if DHS
orders them to do so.
“This provision essentially provides

Brazil’s brave

razil’s oil and gas industry is
looking at some highly significant changes following what officials
call the world’s largest oil discovery
in 30 years—the famed presalt layer.
Dilma Rousseff, chief of staff to
Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula
da Silva and chairman of the board
of state-owned Petroleo Brasileiro
SA (Petrobras), said her country will
exploit the presalt layer for social
betterment.
“With the creation of the New Social Fund, Brazil will create a public
savings account that funnels presalt
revenue into education, science,
and technology as part of our fight
against poverty,” Rousseff said.
Does that sound a little ominous?
One thinks immediately of the problems now arising in nearby Venezuela where President Hugo Chavez
has turned state-owned Petroleos
de Venezuela SA into a cash cow for
social development.
Unfortunately, that cash cow is
getting leaner all the time, while its
milk is on the verge of drying up.
Are we going to see the same thing

resources and use their revenues to
“fuel our fight against poverty and
improve social equality.”
She said, “What’s proposed is
a New Social Fund that not only
would keep these efforts on track for
generations to come, but would help
shield the economy from the potentially destructive impact of a resource
windfall.”
She added, “Also helping to fend
off the ‘curse’ is the hard-earned
fact that the oil bonanza arrives at a
diverse economy and a land rich in
many natural resources.”

Booming economy

Rousseff said, “Brazil’s booming economy, expected to grow
about 4% next year, was attractive
to foreign investors well before the
discovery of the massive pre-salt oil
reserves.”
Not least, she claimed, “The new
legal and regulatory framework submitted to the National Congress aims
to preserve this allure.”
In the newly outlined productionsharing system, according to Rousseff, “foreigners will remain welcome to bid for contracts to explore

uted $385 billion to the domestic economy in 2008 and more than $180 billion
in labor income alone, they noted.
“The influence of the natural gas
industry on the economy is spread
throughout the continental United
States,” the report said. “In 2008, more
than 30 states had at least 10,000 direct,
indirect, and induced jobs related to
natural gas.”
It said that 2.8 million jobs could
be attributed to the gas industry, more
than 622,000 of the directly, while
another 2.2 million positions were
either indirectly related or induced by
the industry’s economic impact. The
number of jobs increased 17% from
2006 to 2008, with direct employment
climbing by more than 100,000 jobs
and total employment increase by more
than 400,000, it said.
The American Petroleum Institute released a study by PriceWaterhouseCoopers on Sept. 9 which found
that the US oil and gas industry supports more than 9 million American
jobs and contributed more than $1
trillion, or 7.5%, to the gross domestic
product in 2007, the most recent year
for which data were available.
By comparison, an October 2008
report which Global Insight produced
for the US Conference of Mayors found
a total of 127,246 US renewable power
generation jobs, ANGA indicated. It
said that a February 2009 report by
the National Mining Association found
that the coal industry employs 122,930
people directly and supports 555,650
other jobs, while the Clean and Safe
Energy Coalition has said that there are
100,000 nuclear jobs in the country.
“The natural gas industry already
provides millions of jobs to Americans, and as Congress seeks solutions to
climate change and energy security, it
is critical to [provide further incentives
for gas], a low-emission fuel source of
which the US has a 100-year supply, to
help carry America into a new, green,
energy independent future,” ANGA
Chairman David A. Trice said. The
group represents 28 of the leading US
independent gas producers. ✦

Work flow reveals
fault complexity
Jonathan C. Evenick
BP America Inc.

& DEVE

L O P M E N T

An effective quality control work
flow using basic fault scaling relationships and distributions can help interrogate mapped prospects or appraised
fields.
Using displacement-length and
cumulative frequency plots, in conjunction with fault seal information, it is
possible to rapidly determine if an appropriate level and amount of plausible
faults have been mapped in an area of
interest. Plotting fault attributes for a
field may reveal anonymous curves or
gaps that can signify missing faults,
noncritical fault mapping, inappropriate fault linking, or interpreters mapping at different scales.
The advantages of this work flow
are that it will reduce the time required to effectively map the structural
complexity needed to appraise a target,
provide an estimate of total number of
mappable faults, assess the quality of
currently mapped faults, and approximate the number of unmapped faults in
areas of poor data.

Fault-size distribution and scaling relationships, therefore, have been thoroughly documented over many orders
of magnitude1 in different rheologies2
and faults types,3 but no definitive correlations have been established. Recent
studies have accounted for scaling
relationship discrepancies and noted
mechanical stratigraphy, seismic resolution, fault linkage, and fault reactivation
as sources of potential error.3-5
The general fault scaling relationship
is D = cLn, where D is maximum displacement, c is a constant that is related
to rock strength, L is length, and n is a
scaling factor.
Most studies have concluded n is
between 0.5 and 2. The exact value is
not considered significant to the work
flow proposed because the resolution
and uncertainty involved with mapping faults in seismic data will produce
a certain amount of data scattering.
As long as the fault data plot is within
general scaling relationships (Fig. 2)
the fault is considered possible, but not
necessarily correctly mapped.

display of anomalous faults or distributions.
Interpreting these plots, along with
fault length-displacement plots, has significant quality control potential even if
there are not enough faults mapped to
derive reliable missing fault complexity
or estimates.

Work-flow methodology
Faults and key horizons in a given
seismic volume or dataset must first be
mapped as accurately as possible, and
particular attention must be paid to
how faults linked. If faults are hard-

are not deﬁned.

linked then it may be appropriate to
signify those planes as one fault even
though it would be more geologically
accurate to have two faults represented.3-5
Fault linkage has important implications on fault seal and seal capacity
studies, and from these studies the
minimum throw of a fault with sealing
potential can be estimated and noted.
The seismic volume or datasets resolution should be also represented on the
fault attribute plots in order to convey
quality data and the amount of complexity captured in an interpretation.
Ideally, the majority of mapped
faults would not be laterally restricted,5

whereas their length-displacement relationship would be skewed. Other fault
displacement assumptions must also be
made in order to derive fault lengthdisplacement relationships.
Since fault throw is easier to quantity
than fault length, and maximum displacement rarely is captured in a given
horizon map, the maximum throw at a
particular horizon will be used in this
work flow.
Given fault length is less constrainable due to the inability to accurately
map fault tips,9 there will be a tendency for the data to have some spread.
Therefore, fault length-displacements
plots should use scaling brackets to

Mapped faults fall within typical scaling relationships and an appropriate level of mapping has been achieved as indicated in the cumulative frequency plot. A fault density map was then created using
only faults with sealing potential. An interpolated fault density map was then generated to approximate the number of faults with sealing potential in an area of poorer data.

the mapping of smaller faults can be
concluded.
Flow baffles or smaller faults are
important to model and capture but are
not critical at this stage of exploration.
To make reservoir modeling programs
work faster, small faults are commonly
removed and transmissibility factors are
incorporated into the geocellular grids
to capture these heterogeneities.
All the mappable faults with sealing
potential are commonly not captured
because it is difficult to decide how
small of a fault is significant (Fig. 3).
If the cumulative frequency line starts
to flatten out before crossing the
estimated throw of faults with seal-

ing potential, then mapping should be
continued.
Using attribute plots iteratively while
mapping will help address this issue
and also designate anomalous faults
that ought to be revisited and potentially revised (Figs. 4 and 5).
Another utility of characterizing
the potential amount of complexity
missing in a given interpretation is the
areal density of significant faults can
be interpolated9 across areas of poorer
data quality (Fig. 6). Using a moving
window, it is possible to estimate the
number of faults that intersect that
window.
The number of faults is then as-

signed to corresponding node in the
middle of the moving window. The
nodes in the area with poorer data can
then be omitted and an interpolated
grid can estimate the number of faults
that may be present in this area as long
as there are no gridding problems or
artifacts (i.e., the node spacing is too
spaced or the poor data area is on a grid
edge).
Further estimates can be made from
a fault density map if the cumulative
frequency plot denotes a certain number of faults are missing from an interpretation. The number of missing faults
can be applied or added to the density
map to help assign the risk associ-

The test requires collecting a series of
composite samples during several days.
The test dilutes the subject water
with synthetic lab water to evaluate the
degree of toxicity as compared to the
lab control sample.

First plant
The first CBM treatment plant
installed by Siemens for Petro-Canada
Resources (USA) was at the company’s
Wild Turkey operations near Gillette, Wyo. The plant, commissioned
in 2006, has a design for processing
120,000 b/d of produced water at peak
production and discharging treated
water to a Powder River tributary.
The plant’s design allows for the
discharge to have a blended sodium
level and to meet WET standards. Fig. 4
shows a schematic of the plant.
Because Petro-Canada was eager to
start processing the produced water as
soon as possible, the project involved
placing a temporary mobile treatment
system online during the installation of
the permanent system.
The mobile system components
included media filtration and RO skids.
The skids were contained in fully automated trailers that included instrumentation and climate control. Siemens

Turkey plant. As
Waste brine
stated previously,
the process typically feeds acid to
a neutral or slightly acidic pH range to
control hardness scale. Without acid
feed, the bicarbonate alkalinity concentration increases, resulting in an
alkaline feedwater condition.
The higher pH offers preferred operating parameters that increase the solubility of residual organics, thus reducing the potential for organic fouling on
the membrane surface. The higher pH
shifts the boric acid to borate equilibrium so that the membrane more easily
rejects the boron, resulting in lower
boron concentrations in the effluent
water. The higher pH increases silica
solubility, thus lowering the potential
for silica fouling.

Second plant
In 2008, Petro-Canada awarded
Siemens a second operating contract
for the treatment of Powder River basin
CBM water at Mitchell Draw, also near
Gillette. As of the date of article, the
company has not commissioned the
plant. The plant has a design for treating 72,000 b/d.
The Siemens engineers wanted to
advance the Wild Turkey plant design
by focusing on hardness and silica scale
formation and acid feed.
Borrowing on capabilities introduced by DOW in 1983,1 Siemens
added ion exchange softening into the
process flow as a key innovation over
the Wild Turkey design. Ion exchange
removes polyvalent cations from the
feedwater. The process removes constituents such as calcium, magnesium,
barium, and soluble iron to very low
levels by exchanging them for sodium
on the ion exchange resin.
On first review, adding a strong acid
cation sodium-form softener may not
be an obvious addition because sodium
is a strictly controlled effluent contaminant. The amount of calcium and
magnesium in the CBM water relative
to the amount of sodium, however, is
low, so that the percentage increase in
the amount of sodium is low.
The softener provides several advantages. First, it reduces the potential for
scale formation by removing dissolved
cations such as calcium, magnesium,
and barium. This reduces the antiscalant and acid chemical requirement

Lessons learned
The Wild Turkey treatment system
was a success because it provided the
intended recovery rate, was reliable,
and handled changing effluent water
standards. The system design followed
a conventional approach including
influent settling, media filtration-iron
removal, acid feed, and RO.
Because disposal cost is a primary
driver for produced water projects, the
process met this objective by maximizing system recovery to minimize brine
disposal costs.
Managing the soluble iron was
one of the challenges addressed by
the design engineers. Iron and other
soluble metals can oxidize within the
membrane modules and foul the memOil & Gas Journal / Oct. 5, 2009

on membrane systems. For instance,
there was a period in which changing
influent conditions resulted in scale
formation on piping and the valves
between the primary RO and the recovery RO. Increasing the acid dosage
to reduce the pH reversed the scaling
process.

Mitchell Draw improvements
Siemens expects the following benefits from the Mitchell plant, after it is
commissioned.
CBM water is characteristically high
in sodium and low in calcium and
magnesium hardness. The low hardness
concentration makes it an ideal application for sodium-form ion exchange.
Removal of the hardness ions reduces
the risk of hardness scale formation and
the need for acid.
CBM water contains relatively high
concentrations of bicarbonate alkalinity.
Given the concentration effect across
a membrane system, the pH of the
feedwater will increase to increase the
solubility of silica and residual organics
and improve the rejection of boron.
The process eliminates acid for scale
control, resulting in improved plant
safety and system reliability. The plant

does not need trucks hauling acid,
thereby removing them from public
highways and reducing risks to the
plant and personnel.
The new design removes acid feed
equipment and controls from the system because pH control is no longer a
primary concern to system operation.
In addition, it improves system reliability because inventory control is less
vulnerable to delivery interruptions.

Water analysis comparison
The table above illustrates the
changes to feedwater quality while
applying each scale control technique.
The feedwater data are approximated
from actual Powder River basin produced water analyses. The analyses are
then modeled using the Dow Chemical
Co.’s Reverse Osmosis System Analysis (ROSA) program to illustrate the
changing conditions.
In the pH-adjusted feedwater case
(Wild Turkey plant), the process reduces the pH to 7.0 from 8.2 with hydrochloric acid as compared with sulfuric
acid, since the sulfate in sulfuric acid
can cause scaling as it bonds with divalent cations present in the feedwater.
Acid addition changes the character-

istics of the water as hydrogen neutralizes bicarbonate to form carbon dioxide
and chloride. This results in a marked
increase in chloride concentration from
the contribution of hydrochloric acid
and a reduction in raw water LSI to
–0.1 from 1.2.
In the softened feedwater case
(Mitchell Draw plant), the plant reduces
the divalent cations calcium, magnesium, strontium and barium to less
than 0.3 ppm in the adjusted feedwater.
There is a corresponding increase in sodium content as an equivalent amount
of sodium is exchanged into the water.
Unlike the acid feed case (Wild Turkey plant), the pH and total dissolved
solids (TDS) stay about the same. The
LSI scaling calculation shows –1.3 in
the adjusted feedwater. Furthermore,
the barium sulfate and calcium fluoride
scaling calculations also show reduced
scaling potential with the softened
feedwater case (Mitchell Draw). ✦

Exploring for resource
quality, building advanced technological capability, pursuing improved performance and cost
efficiencies, and adopting high-value
entry strategies are some factors leading
to successful exploitation of gas shales.
Our first article on gas shales (OGJ,
Sept. 28, 2009, p. 39) introduced the
numerous geological, engineering, and
economic challenges facing optimum
exploration and development of gas
shales, including how operators have
addressed and learned from these
challenges. This second article pursues
these important topics in more depth.
The third and final article in this series will examine emerging shale plays

in North America
and other settings,
as well as environmental challenges facing shale
development.

3. Extensive fringe area, often called

Resource settings
High resource quality for gas shales
requires the convergence of a series of
favorable reservoir properties beyond
thick net pay. These include adequate
porosity, greater than 3%, and high reservoir pressure, ideally overpressured,
to pack more gas into a given volume
of shale and keep natural and induced
fractures open during early production.
High-quality shale properties also
include favorable thermal maturity—
vitrinite reflectance (Ro) of 1.5% or
greater—to place the shales in the dry
gas window and avoid unfavorable
relative permeability effects caused by
oil blocking the small pore throats and
permeability pathways common to
many of the gas shale plays. A few combination oil-gas shale plays with higher
permeability intervals embedded in the
shale matrix do exist, however, such as
in the northern portion of the Barnett
shale gas play.
The shales require a sufficiently high
organic richness (TOC greater than 2
wt %) for generating abundant volumes
of gas, some of which is adsorbed by
the thermally mature organics.
As introduced in Part 1, adsorptive
capacity is most important for shallow
gas shales, while porosity becomes the
dominant gas storage mechanism in
deep gas shales (Fig. 2). While TOC decreases with thermal maturity, the remaining higher maturity organics have
high adsorptive capacity, contributing
to higher gas in-place concentrations.
In addition, higher thermal maturity shrinks the in-place organics and
helps create more pore space for storing
gas (Fig. 3). The presence of preserved
diatoms in the shale formation also
can provide enhanced storage space,
accounting for the higher porosity
volumes reported for gas shale deposits
such as the Haynesville.
An often-overlooked high quality shale property is favorable in situ

stress. The in situ tectonic stress of the
shale formation influences both the
permeability of the formation as well
as its response to hydraulic stimulation.
Areas with lower and relatively equal
horizontal stresses will have higher reservoir flow capacities and will achieve
more effective multibranched hydraulic
stimulations.

Assessing mineralogy
The mineral composition of the

shale becomes important when one
evaluates gas shale reservoir properties for quality. While ordinary shales
consist predominately of various clays,
the deep reservoir-quality shales are
dominated by brittle minerals such as
quartz, carbonates, and feldspars and
are relatively low in clay (<50%). Such
silicic shales are brittle and shatter
when stressed, providing multiple dendritic fracture swarms.
In contrast, shales with a high clay

small-scale natural fractures.
Considerable discussion has centered
on the importance of natural fractures
for providing economically viable flow
paths in gas shales. Our view is that
small-scale natural fractures, essentially
microscale, grain-to-grain planes of
weakness in the shale matrix, provide
enhanced permeability and help create
multibranched, orthogonal hydraulic
fractures.
In contrast, large-scale natural
fractures and faults are, in general,
detrimental because they can limit effective horizontal lateral lengths, absorb
hydraulic fracture energy and, at times,
serve as conduits for water.
Gas shale formations such as the Fayetteville that have been deeply buried
and then uplifted, tend to have more
microscale planes of weakness due to

Efficiently pursuing gas shales is
a high-tech undertaking, involving
production of hydrocarbons that the
industry traditionally has viewed as
an essentially impermeable source or
cap rock. The technological leap that
cracked the technological code was
the introduction of horizontal drilling
supplemented by intensive hydraulic
stimulation.
The permeability of the gas shale
matrix is low, about a few hundred
nanodarcies. Achieving economically attractive flow rates requires drilling long
horizontal wells in extensively fractured
rock by hydraulics or by nature. As such,
the operator is either creating permeability by shattering the shale or linking
up native permeability in the rock from

Today’s best practices for effective hydraulic stimulation of gas shale

energy using large volumes of water

A longer effective horizontal lateral,

Rigs, multiwell pads
Fit-for-purpose rigs, with automation and mobility, can reduce the time
to drill shale wells. The new generation
of gas shale rigs needs:
• Sufficient horsepower (typically
1,000-2,000 hp) to drill long horizontal
laterals.
• A compact design for easy mobilization and demobilization, particularly
in areas with narrow roads and challenging terrain such as the Marcellus
shale.
• Increasingly, a skid-mounting
capability.
We have seen instances in which
the use of fit-for-purpose rigs, an
increasingly experienced crew, and the
introduction of performance incentives
have cut in half the drilling time of a
shale well. Some operators, who have
established in-house drilling and other
service capabilities, report closer alignment of goals and better control over
the quality of operations.
Multiwell pads also can save
demobilization-remobilization time
and greatly reduce land disturbance.
As operators drill gas shale wells on
closer spacings, it becomes increasingly
efficient to drill multiple wells from a
single well pad. This also will reduce
land disturbance and access issues in
rugged, environmentally sensitive terrain.

must get it right the first time.
While the large acreage underlain
by gas shale play leads itself to manufacturing style efficiencies, it is important to establish first the most efficient
manufacturing design before putting it
into large-scale use.

Continuous learning, including
learning from the successful and less
successful experiences of other gas
shale operators, can and has led to
steadily improving results, such as
fewer mechanical well failures, more
effective well stimulations, and more
optimum well spacing. Some of the
better performing gas shale companies
have set quantitative expectations, in
considerable detail, for learning-based
performance improvements.

Special Report

One example of the benefits of
rigorously pursuing learning was
gained from the insight that restimulating older hydraulically fraced wells to
contact and shatter more of the shale
matrix would result in higher well
performance. Much of the foundation
for pursuing higher gas shale flow rates
and enhanced reservoir permeability
with intensively stimulated horizontal wells derived from this important
insight.
The Denton Creek Trading No. 1
well in the Barnett shale illustrated how
an operator converted an initial 1-bcf
estimated ultimate recovery well to a
2.9 bcf EUR well with restimulation
(Fig. 5). Importantly, this vertical well,
as of mid-2009, already has produced
2.2 bcf.
One key aspect of gas shale well
performance remains a puzzle, namely
the significant variability in well performance, even when the underlying,
readily measureable geological reservoir properties appear to be the same
or similar.
One example of this is the repeated
anomalous presence of side-by-side
high and low performing wells. The
core area (Wise, Denton, and Tarrant
counties) of the Barnett shale provides a
larger example of this phenomenon.
This area had more than 1,000 horizontal wells drilled between 2001 and
2006. The best 10% of the wells average
about 8 bcf/well while the lowest 30%
of the wells average about 1 bcf/well
(Fig. 6).
A detailed plot of these wells vs.
reservoir properties such as net pay,
thermal maturity, and depth provides
no clear trends, even for wells drilled
and stimulated in a similar manner and
at a similar time.
A possible explanation is the complex 3D distribution of small-scale
natural fractures and in situ stress, a
puzzle that remains tantalizingly below
the resolution ability of current seismic
and logging tools to unravel.

Entry strategies
Several successful strategies exist

for entering a high quality gas shale
play, ranging from aggressive leasing of
emerging basins to entering into a joint
venture with early-mover operators
already holding core area acreage.
Gas shale plays with good market access and low transportation tariffs command a premium over gas shale plays
and basins with less favorable access to
markets. For example, a close-to-market
gas shale play such as the Marcellus can
have a transportation and market advantage of nearly $2/Mcf compared to a
far-from-market Rockies gas shale play.
Sometimes, to counter high transportation cost disadvantages offered by
traditional markets, the operator needs
to step outside the box. For example,
the operators of the northern British
Columbia gas shale plays, notably in the
Horn River basin, have begun to pursue
alternative, higher value markets.
One of these is for shipping the
produced gas to nearby Fort McMurray,
Alta., to use in production and upgrading of oil sands. The other is for providing the shale gas to the planned LNG
export plant at Kitimat, BC, for delivery
to higher value Asia-Pacific markets.
In general, the well-prepared earlyentry gas shale operator will be able
to capture substantial acreage in the
core area and gain leases with considerably lower lease bonuses and royalties. This strategy will provide lower
breakeven cost opportunities, enabling
the company to be one of the low-cost
operators, as shown for an early entry
operator in the Barnett shale gas play
(Fig. 7).
When early-leasing entry is no
longer available, the next favorable
strategy is to form a joint venture with
or acquire one of the early-entry competitors with high resource quality core
area acreage.
This is the strategy followed by
Shell Canada Ltd. and its acquisition
of Duvernay Oil Corp. in the Montney
resource play in Canada (OGJ, Sept. 8,
2008, p. 31) and by the BG Group in its
joint venture with EXCO Resources Inc.
for the Haynesville gas shale play (OGJ,
Online, July 2, 2009). ✦

An energy-assessment
team for Saudi Aramco
has systematically analyzed the interaction between process and utility
systems at the company’s Gas Processing
Berri gas plant and
identified realistic and
achievable energy-saving opportunities
for the plant.
This effort resulted in a number of
energy-saving initiatives, which the team
prioritized for implementation with a
“road-map” strategy.

As part of a long-term commitment
by Saudi Aramco to energy conservation throughout its operating facilities,
Saudi Aramco’s Berri gas plant embarked on a strategic plan to improve
energy efficiency. A complete energy
assessment in 2006 yielded specific

recommendations.
Nonetheless, changes in operating
regime and different process and economic scenarios within the subsequent
period prompted BGP to reexamine the
energy assessment findings that were
produced earlier. Hence in April 2008,
BGP requested that Saudi Aramco’s
central energy engineering team, the
energy systems unit, reevaluate BGP’s
energy efficiency performance.
Unlike the earlier studies, BGP had
expressed interest in having the team
focus only on its NGL-recovery facility, rather than on the entire plant. The
NGL-recovery facility contributes significantly to the high energy consumption in the entire plant.
Since BGP involves close interaction
between process and utility systems,
it is imperative that the plant’s utility
system be incorporated in this study as
a means accurately to quantify energysaving opportunities from the NGL-recovery plant. The utility system consists
of cogeneration, the sulfur plant’s steam
system, and associated steam system,
together with the propane refrigeration
system.
By focusing on a specific facility,

This is a typical snapshot of the in-house utility system model developed in an Excel based spreadsheet (Fig. 1).

plant engineers looked forward to seeing recommendations that could be
implemented cost effectively.
The assessment or study phase is the
most important aspect of any energy
saving project. Its objective is simple
and clear, i.e., to identify cost-effective
energy saving opportunities while
considering operability and safety in
implementation. Meeting this objective
required multidisciplinary technical
support. In this case, several process
and operation engineers from the Berri
plant were involved in the study.
The screening process involved
assessing the economic incentive of
implementing such an initiative. It is
important to note that the criterion
used in economic incentive assessment
is based on simple payback and the
cost estimate used in this work is not
rigorous but allows reasonable assessment effectively to identify or screen
cost-effective energy saving opportunities. In addition, during screening,
each initiative must also consider safety,

First, we may end up of having this

off unnecessarily, making the actual
value of the energy saving zero. Or we
simply lose the opportunity to take advantage of the excess steam to generate
more power from our steam turbines,
provided that we have additional capacity to do so. This in essence reduces our
demand for external power requirements, and hence an actual value of
energy saving could have been realized.
Secondly, one may reduce the fuel
consumption in the boiler to reflect
the reduction in steam demand. Even
though intuitively this is the logical
thing to do, in many cases, this approach reduces the steam turbines’
capacities to sustain their power generation. The worst part is that we have
to resort to external power, which is
relatively costly, to make up the loss of
power generation from these turbines.
This obviously defeats the purpose of
the energy-saving initiative.

this utility model is that it allows us to
maximize the actual value of energy
saving in monetary form. The approach
we adopted here was somewhat similar
to the one used to determine the marginal utility cost.3 5 We instead use the
utility model to link to the potential
energy savings from the process, as we
determined earlier in terms of either
MMbtu/hr or ton of steam.
Since the savings from the process
reflect the utility imbalance throughout
the utility system, the utility model
is then used to correct the imbalance,
by optimizing the system, taking into
account all physical and capacity constraints of the utility system.

Application
Here’s a specific example of how
the concept is applied to determine
the actual value of energy savings in a
condensate stripper system of Berri’s
NGL-recovery plant.
Fig. 2 shows the processing area
covering the condensate strippers (C1
62

and C201) and the associated heat exchangers surrounding these strippers.
The liquid feeds, which are predominantly hydrocarbon liquids recovered
from the slug catchers, have to be
stripped to remove any light hydrocarbons until the liquid outlet streams
achieve specifications as NGL products
(stabilized NGL).
Currently, the existing heat exchangers, involving feed preheating and
product rundown cooling, use steam
and air cooling, respectively. As such,
a potential heat recovery between feed
preheating and product rundown could
provide an opportunity to reduce energy consumption in this area.
Pinch analysis identified the scope
for heat recovery for the entire condensate stripper area. Fig. 3 shows a
relevant composite curve from pinch
analysis software6 that demonstrates
that the condensate stripper area requires only a minimum hot utility of 6
Mw and no cold utility.
To achieve the target of 6 Mw, two

possible heat-recovery opportunities
can be identified from C1 and C201,
respectively. Fig. 4 shows the schematic
of these two opportunities that highlights the heat recovery between the
NGL product rundown and the preheating within C1 and C201, respectively.
Furthermore, the illustration highlights
new pipe work and heat exchanger
requirements.
Based on the proposed opportunities, the 60-lb steam savings are estimated to be 4,000 lb/hr and 28,000 lb/
hr for E16 and E201, respectively. The
savings, quoted in terms of pounds of
steam use, are then to be quantified in
monetary terms using the rigorous inhouse utility modeling tools.
These energy savings were determined to be worth $830,000/year in
E201 unit and $133,000/year in E16
unit. Eliminating air cooler E203 led
to electricity savings valued around
$30,000/year. Thus the total energy
saving at C201 area alone is around
$860,000/year.

While this task is being performed,
the team deliberated the pros and cons
of the proposed opportunities. The operation engineer stressed that stripper
C1 is not normally used, as the incoming feeds to C1 are normally in a batch
form.
In a year, the frequency of using
C1 stripper is rather small, and based
on this argument the team decided to
focus on the stripper C201 area instead, where exchanger E201 consumes
significant amounts of steam. In addition, the team briefly assessed the pipe
work requirement from the site layout
perspective, together with the potential
hydraulic requirement.
The cost estimate for the new heat
exchanger NEWHXB (for stripper C201
area; Fig. 4) was determined. The cost
did not include the piping cost, as
the heat exchanger cost is used here
to screen the energy saving initiative.

CYBER SECURITY—
Conclusion

A risk assessment,
combined with a vulnerability assessment and
threat scenario analysis,
specifically identifies
cyber vulnerabilities that
Pipelines
may require elimination
from a pipeline system.
Elimination of vulnerabilities isn’t always possible, however, especially with
little control
over the operating system and
networking
software used
as the basis of
supervisory
control and data
acquisition systems.
Relying on the various vendors to
identify vulnerabilities and supply
patches eliminating them is a neverending process. The only solution is to
place independent barriers and protections (technical countermeasures)
around a SCADA system to try to keep
its communication paths secure.
The first article in this series (OGJ,
Sept. 28, 2009, p. 62) described a risk
assessment for cyber attack before detailing a number of potential attack avenues. This concluding part will detail
the application of a particular approach
to vulnerability assessment.1

ing the connections between various
segments, the cyber assets present on
each segment, and the communication
interfaces into each of those segments.
DNSAM then presumes the worst-case
scenario (total loss) for all of the assets
on each local segment and determines
the consequences.
If a local segment has a dangerous
communications interface (dial-in telephone, wireless, or Internet), DNSAM
assumes an attack against the assets on
that segment is highly likely. If a local
segment is isolated (no interconnections or only via a protective firewall),
DNSAM classifies an attack against assets on that segment as unlikely.
In between those extremes lie segments with external WAN connectivity
(attacks being likely) and connectivity
with internal LAN/WAN networks (attacks being somewhat likely).
Evaluating interfaces into a given
network segment requires remembering the possibility of alternate communication interfaces. Fig. 1 provides a
representative example of determining
network segmentation. Segments end
at a filtering device (a firewall or other
device with user-definable access control list rules). A simple Layer 2 switch
doesn’t terminate a segment.

unlikely to be attacked.
DNSAM assumes physical and operational security is being addressed separately and doesn’t specifically address
the evil-insider threat agent. It therefore
doesn’t consider the manual delivery
of malware, which is either forbidden by policies (operational security)
or blocked by disabling those drives,
ports, and interfaces as part of baseline
configuration-setting procedures (operational security).
DNSAM also ignores non TCP/IP
communication interfaces, such as serial communication channels used for
RTU polling. DNSAM, finally, considers
only firewalls as a suitable countermeasure. Its focus on communication
interfaces creates this approach, but
other countermeasures could also be
employed.

Variation
A variation of the DNSAM approach
is probably an acceptable methodology
for conducting a pipeline SCADA system risk assessment. Considering only

IP-based communication interfaces fails
to address the situation adequately, nor
can operational security be ignored as
a necessary component of overall cyber
security. Addressing intolerable vulnerabilities—those enabling an attack
resulting in unacceptable consequences—also requires examining the full
spectrum of available countermeasures.
Hacker conferences have hosted
numerous papers and presentations
on industrial automation systems and
the communication protocols used in
them. An attacker could attack field
sites by accessing the serial communications to those sites and simulating
control command messages. Several
suppliers offer protocol test sets simulating almost any SCADA/RTU protocol
and generating a full range of RTU
commands.
A pure DNSAM assessment approach
usually ignores communication channels not supporting routable protocols
(such as the TCP/IP suite), allowing
intermediate computers to receive messages addressed to other computers and

attempt to pass them along to the actual
addressee.
Typical SCADA serial protocols for
RTU polling and supervisory control
are not routing protocols, and there is
no way for an attacker to hack into a
computer and access the operating system, plant malware, and alter software
by sending messages back along a polling channel.
RTU serial protocols have a fixed set
of predefined commands and message
types and well-defined responses to
each. Any variation from that welldefined structure will cause a message
or response to be rejected.
But it would be possible for an attacker to send false data back to the
SCADA system by sending forged pollresponse messages, causing the SCADA
system see what the attacker wants it to
see (open valves looking closed, running pumps appearing to be stopped,
pressure and flow measurements apparently stable, etc.).
An attacker with access to RTU polling channels can also send supervisory

control messages out to the RTUs and
cause them to start-stop and open-close
field devices or issue any other supported supervisory command (such
as changing set points, alarm limits,
tuning constants, etc.). The degree of
possible damage this could generate
depends on the intelligence level of the
RTU (how much local, semi-autonomous regulatory control and sequencesafety logic it performs), the types of
equipment it directly operates (valves,
pumps, motors, etc.), and the presence
(or lack) of hard-wired safety logic capable of overriding the RTU’s controls.
Installation and commissioning of a
SCADA system or a new RTU often uses
protocol test sets when one or the other
is unavailable and something is needed
to simulate the missing component,
making it quite within the capabilities
of a commercially available test set to
simulate field conditions or act in the
role of the SCADA system.

Vulnerability assessment
One typical approach used in a vul70

Table 1

nerability assessment examines various
scenarios in which an asset could be attacked, identifies the real consequences
of a successful attack, and then reviews
the difficulty involved in staging such
an attack. A table of scenarios can
document this process (Table 1).
It is important to state accurately
the consequences of having a cyber
asset compromised, altered, deleted,
or disabled. A cyber attack can disable
computers and overload communication networks. A cyber attack can delete
or alter data or insert malware, providing an attacker with remote access to
critical systems. But completely reformatting hard drives and reloading the
affected computers (and other infected
network components) from “clean”
backup media, usually puts things back
as they were before the attack.
This takes time (once it is actually
realized an attack is in progress) and
requires thoroughly tested, well-documented, and well-rehearsed procedures
for performing a system restoration.
SCADA systems used for supervising

critical processes (such as pipeline transportation) almost always have full (or
as near as is possible) redundancy. For
very critical pipelines there might even
be a backup operating site with another
complete SCADA system sitting ready.
An assessment of attack consequences must remember these factors, although a serious attacker would
probably be aware of them and take
them into account. In an assessment of
attack-scenario success likelihood, the
more things needing happen in parallel
or sequence for success, the lower the
likelihood. If an attack-scenario, therefore, only results in dire consequences
if the attacker can take out the primary
and redundant backup SCADA system at
both the main and alternate operating
sites, the success likelihood is low.
Redundancy usually requires sharing
a common LAN and updating communication processes between the redundant equipment and the primary and
backup sites. Failure to protect these
communication links adequately offers
a path for an attacker to get to the full

production work along the Amazon River
that Chevron never conducted.
It’s 31% of Chevron’s total shareholders’ equity. It’s more than half of Ecuador’s
gross domestic product.
Chevron inherited the fight when it
acquired Texaco in 2001. Texaco had
participated in a consortium that produced
oil in Ecuador until its concession ended
in 1992. A Texaco unit had been operator until the state-owned oil company
replaced it in 1990. Chevron says Texaco
spent $40 million for its share of environmental clean-up and was released from
liability by the government. It also says the
state company, Petroecuador, created the
environmental problems evident now.
Alleging corruption of Ecuadorian
courts and prejudice of the country’s president, Chevron has filed for international
arbitration (OGJ Online, Sept. 25, 2009).
Lawyers for the Ecuadorian plaintiffs
say outcome of the arbitration, related to a
treaty between governments, won’t affect
the legal case, which involves individuals
and a company. In public, Chevron has
steadfastly defended its position, dedicating part of its web site to reports of developments and not mincing words.
Plaintiffs’ attorneys and the allied
activist group Amazon Watch snipe at
every move Chevron makes, of course.
The spearhead is New York lawyer Steven
Donzinger, a law school friend of US
President Barack Obama who helped raise
funds for his old buddy’s political campaign. So this isn’t quite David vs. Goliath.
Donzinger threatens to seize Chevron
assets if plaintiffs prevail. If damages
approach their potential, logistics of that
maneuver would be interesting.
A better word than “interesting” in this
case, however, is “unreal.”
Twenty-seven billion dollars at stake in
a tiny court in Ecuador. From shareholders
of a company that never worked there.
In fact, “unreal” doesn’t do justice to
this exercise in gold-digging. “Preposterous” seems more appropriate.

Horsnell: US policy will shift oil markets
Commodities market regulation in the US seems to be moving towards higher
capital requirements and bureaucratization with relatively little impact on prices
in the long run, said Paul Horsnell, managing director and head of commodities
research at Barclays Capital in London. However, he warned, “Expect the center of
gravity of world oil trading to move further away from US markets.”
After a long period of regulatory fog and uncertainty, more clarity may be about
to emerge as to the revised regulatory backdrop for US commodities markets.
“The main impact, in our view, is more likely to be on the structure, location, and
composition of and the hedging costs in markets rather than…any lasting impact
on the price levels those markets generate,” Horsnell said. “Whether or not there
are short-term price effects within temporarily disorderly markets depends in large
part on how the changes are presented and announced.” It is still “a bit early” to
tell “which style of announcement will be applied to regulatory changes in commodities and, hence, whether there will be any short-term price distortions.”
However, he said, the nature of the regulatory and bureaucratic structures likely
to be imposed on US commodities markets is becoming clearer. Recent testimony
by Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Gary Gensler in Washington seems “to involve higher margining requirements, a broadening of the
regulatory ambit across over-the-counter markets, and a bureaucraticization and
centralization of those markets.” Horsnell noted, “Gensler’s testimony did not link
change in any way to the operation, participants, or performance of commodities
markets. Instead, he linked change to the overhaul of the US financial system as
a whole and in its entirety after what he described as its failing of the American
people 1 year ago. The arguments based on specific commodities-based criteria
have then, it seems, been abandoned in favor of arguments drawn from a generalized approach to greater regulation of financial markets in their entirety.”
A ‘philosophic mutation’
Horsnell said, “In other words, this seems to have mutated into regulation born
of a general regulatory philosophy rather than being driven by the identification
and attempted correction of specific market failures or distortions in specific commodities markets. The danger in that evolution is that the move to a more dogmabased motivation means that the regulatory process in the future may be less
concerned by the nature of the distortions it throws up, given that it is the imposition of the regulation itself rather the correction of any specific distortion that has
now become the main objective. That would imply regulation with limited marketbased benchmarks to judge its own effectiveness or need, and that would not be a
recipe for any flexible, pragmatic, or volatility-reducing regime.”
He said, “Other than the danger of a short-term disorderly market should implementation prove unexpectedly clumsy, we would not expect to see steady-state
oil prices change as a result of the new regulation. In an industry that now needs
more than $60/bbl to operate with any sustainability, prices cannot stay too much
lower than current levels without stoking future price shocks.”
Meanwhile, Horsnell said, “We would expect some changes to the structure of
the oil market. We would expect to see a degree of liquidity migrate away from
US exchanges. We expect to see increasing costs for some hedging operations,
potentially leaving commercial operations more exposed as they face a new and
less favorable trade-off between risk reduction and its cost. Indeed, the scope for
some types of risk management in US markets is likely to be truncated by cost and
by transparency obligations, especially those with longer execution times in less
liquid parts of the curve. Transparency is not necessarily a good objective to have
in low volume areas of the market, if it means that even less volume can be traded
before markets move severely against those engaged in the execution of risk management.”
Horsnell said, “The drive towards greater transparency of transactions does not
always provide a benefit in those circumstances, and in those less liquid areas the
danger is that liquidity will die away completely, leaving the market and commercial companies to carry a greater degree of time and basis risks.”
In other news, the latest statement of Saudi Arabia’s short and medium-term
policies provides “a further signal” that $70-80/bbl for crude is considered a
comfortable range for now, Horsnell said. Ali al-Naimi, Saudi Arabia Minister of
Petroleum, indicated prices above $70/bbl are necessary to maintain investment
and keep the oil market balanced over the longer term.

Advancing Reservoir Performance

Plugging and Abandoning
Hurricane-Damaged Wells
Vented Inﬂatable System Eliminates Gas
Bubbles, Enables Successful Cement Plugs
Many hurricane-damaged wells in the Gulf of Mexico have to be
permanently plugged and abandoned. Operators have discovered
that many of these wells are bubbling, which creates challenges
when placing cement barriers in the wells.

Gas Bubbles Passing Through Microannuli
Inflatable packers such as Baker Oil Tools’ Production Injection Packer
(PIP), deployed as a pressure sealing base on which a cement plug is
placed, is often a suitable fix for this problem. However, gas bubbles
sometimes find a way around the PIP and work their way through the
cement, creating microannuli even after the cement sets up. These
bubbles travel through microscopic pits or fissures in the old casing.
This was the challenge an operator faced in a High Island well with
26-in., 125 lbf casing.
Vented PIP System
To solve this problem reliably and economically, Baker Hughes developed
the Vented PIP System, a new method of stopping the flow of bubbles.
The system consists of a PIP (with a ball on seat below it), a length of
vent tubing above it, and a mechanical disconnect on top of that.
Bubbles in Well Stopped Immediately
Once the system was set at depth, bubbles in the well stopped
immediately. Simultaneously, a substantial flow of gas was observed
through the work string at surface. The operator then ran a grout string
(small work string) beside the primary work string to a depth just above
the inflated element. Cement was then pumped through the grout string
on top of the PIP. A cement volume was pumped that equaled about
50 ft in the annulus between the 26-in. casing ID and the OD of the
2 7/8-in. tubing. While this cement cured, the vent tubing and work
string were kept open to vent the gas to surface. This prevented gas
buildup below the PIP and kept bubbles from affecting the cement job.
Once the cement had completely cured, a cast iron bridge plug was run
through the primary work string and set in the vent tubing above the
PIP. This resulted in a permanently plugged well.

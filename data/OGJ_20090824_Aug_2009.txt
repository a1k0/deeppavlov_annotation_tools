Venture dismisses Centrica’s final offer deadline

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Santos sells down Bonaparte gas fields

Venture Production PLC again rejected the £1.3 billion cash
takeover bid from Centrica Ltd., despite a deadline extension to
Aug. 28 to buy shares in the company.
Venture said the offer undervalued the company and urged
shareholders not to sign any documentation relating to Centrica’s
deal. It called on Centrica to offer a “fair price” for its unique portfolio in the UK North Sea.
Centrica received valid acceptances representing 40.8% of the
issued share capital of Venture. It has shown an interest in the company for months and has obtained 29.9% of it.
A report compiled by Resource Investment Strategy Consultants
pegged Venture’s worth at 1,066-1,385 pence/share, much more
than the 845 pence/share submitted by Centrica.
But Centrica dismissed the report commissioned by Venture,
arguing it was highly optimistic and lacked credibility. “The offer
represents a compelling opportunity for Venture shareholders to
realize the value of their shares in cash at a time of continued economic uncertainty and market volatility,” it added.
Venture also insisted it has the “financial strength” and technical
expertise to implement its projects in the UK North Sea.
The European Commission is reviewing the merger process and
is to be finished by Aug. 26. Centrica said it believes “no material
antitrust issues are likely to arise in relation to the offer.”

Santos has sold 60% of its interests in the Petrel, Tern, and Frigate gas fields in the Bonaparte Gulf straddling the Western Australian and Northern Territory offshore border to GDF Suez for $200
million.
Santos previously held 100% interest in the fields. GDF Suez will
gain operatorship in 2011.
The two companies also have formed a joint venture called
Bonaparte LNG to develop the fields via a floating LNG facility capable of producing 2 million tonnes/year of LNG as well as market
the gas. GDF Suez will lift all the LNG production and ship it to the
Asia-Pacific region.
GDF Suez will carry Santos’s share of pre-FEED and FEED costs
and make an additional payment to Santos of $170 million once a
final investment decision is reached.
The deal is conditional on Australian Foreign Investment Review
Board approval.
Contingent reserves in the fields total 220 million boe, although
much of this is dry gas with estimated reserves of 1.5 tcf.
The fields were discovered by ARCO about 30-40 years ago—
Petrel with a spectacular blow-out and rig fire in 1969, Tern in
1971, and Frigate in 1978. Santos drilled Frigate Deep-1 to confirm that discovery in 2008.
They lie 250-300 km west of Darwin.
Numerous plans for their development over the years, usually

The majority state-owned firm expects to boost its worldwide close of the acquisition at the end of this month.

Development

BLM seeks comments on Colorado project
The US Bureau of Land Management is seeking public comments on an oil and natural gas development proposal on federal
leases near Silt, Colo., BLM’s field office in Glenwood Springs announced.
It said on Aug. 18 that Bill Barrett Corp. submitted a master development plan for the Gibson Gulch area with plans to drill as
many as 136 new wells from 10 proposed well pads over 5 years,
starting this fall.
The proposed development area covers 2,700 acres, 1,867 of
which are federal surface and minerals, 40 of which are private
surface and federal minerals, and 793 acres are private surface and
minerals, according to the BLM field office. County Roads 311 and
335 would provide primary access, it indicated.
The Denver independent’s proposal calls for construction of 4.2
miles of access roads and 4.3 miles of pipelines, the BLM field office said. Most of the wells would use directional drilling technology, it added.
BLM plans to prepare an environmental assessment of the plan
and would like to hear any specific issues, concerns, and comments
the public would like to see addressed in it by Sept. 18, the field
office said.

The well, which was drilled to the Lockhart limestone formation, flowed from the uppermost reservoir section. Drilling continues to penetrate and test the potentially prospective lower zones.
The full extent of the discovery will be known once the well
reaches the planned total depth during the next few months.

Beach makes oil find in Eromanga basin

Beach Petroleum NL, Adelaide, and its joint venture partner,
Drillsearch Energy Ltd., Sydney, have made an oil discovery in permit PEL91 in the South Australian part of the Eromanga basin.
The Chiton-1 wildcat well found a 5.5-m oil interval in the
primary Mesozoic-age Namur sandstone target.
It is the first oil discovery in the permit and, although at a P50
estimate of 120,000 bbl of reserves, it is relatively close to existing
infrastructure and will be completed for future production.
Chiton-1 is the first of two wells planned in PEL91 along the oil

Chevron advances Minas chemical flood

Maersk Oil starts production from Affleck

Chevron Pacific Indonesia is moving ahead with its pilot chemical injection project in giant Minas oil field in Sumatra, Indonesia
(OGJ, Apr. 21, 2008, p. 41).
The company let contract to Technip for detail engineering,
project management, procurement assistance, and construction
management for water treatment and cooling facilities and a polymer and surfactant mixing plant, including chemical injection
packages and production facilities.
Chevron began chemical injection last year. It hopes the project
will boost recovery at Minas and surrounding fields. The Minas resource has been estimated at 4 billion bbl of oil initially in place.

Maersk Oil UK Ltd. has brought Affleck field on stream in the
central UK North Sea, adding potentially 8,000 b/d of oil to its
portfolio when it reaches full capacity.
The field was originally scheduled to start production in July
2007, but was delayed due to the Janice floating production unit
(FPU) had two lengthly shutdown periods after being given prohibition orders by safety watchdog Health & Safety Executive.
A company spokesman told OGJ that it had initially started at
2,000 b/d through two subsea horizontal production wells tied
back via a 28-km production flow line to the Janice FPU on Block
30/17a, also operated by Maersk Oil.
The Affleck subsea manifold, umbilical, and control systems
could utilize up to four production wells for future upside potential. Hydrocarbons are being produced from a chalk formation
and Maersk Oil used the Noble TVL rig to complete development
drilling.
Maersk constructed a new gas export spurline to the Clyde platform, which is operated by partner Talisman North Sea Ltd. “We
have also undertaken a significant modification program on Janice to process and export Affleck production fluids, said Tom Van
Leenen, Maersk Oil managing director. “In addition Clyde has also
undergone topside modifications,” he said.
Affleck was first discovered by Royal Dutch Shell PLC in 1974.
Oil is being exported through the existing Janice pipeline into
Norpipe, and then to Teeside. Gas is being routed through existing
ties on the Janice and Judy export pipeline to SEGAL, via the Clyde
and Fulmar facilities, and onward to the St. Fergus terminal. ✦

Production increase planned for Bongkot field
The consortium led by Thailand’s PTT Exploration & Production
PLC (PTTEP) is set to ramp up production from its greater Bongkot
field off Thailand by 58% to 870 MMcfd of gas in the next 2-3
years. The incremental delivery of 320 MMcfd will come from the
major sister field in the Gulf of Thailand, Bongkot South, which is
slated to come on stream between mid-2012 and mid-2013, behind the previous schedule of 2011.
The Bongkot partnership recently finalized an agreement to sell
Bongkot South gas to PTT PLC, Thailand’s biggest energy firm. PTTEP
operates Bongkot with a 44.4445% share with France’s Total E&P
and BG Group holding 33.3333% and 22.2222%, respectively.
The main Bongkot field 600 km south of Bangkok has been in
production since July 1993 and at its peak in 2007 produced an
average of 629 MMcfd of gas and 17,870 b/d of condensate, more
than the 550 MMcfd contractual rate agreed with PTT.

Pemex settles on new refinery site
Mexico’s Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) said it has settled on a
site at Tula in Hidalgo state to construct a $9-billion refinery, and
will modernize another facility at Salamanca in nearby Guanajuato
state for $3 billion.
According to Pemex Chief Executive Officer Jesus Reyes Heroles, Hidalgo was the first of the two states to acquire the 700
hectares the firm needed for the refinery, ending a contest between
the two over which would host the new facility.
The contest began shortly after mid-April when Pemex announced plans to build the refinery in Tula while simultaneously
carrying out a reconfiguration of the Salamanca refinery in Guanajuato state (OGJ Online, Apr. 16, 2009).

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
But Hidalgo failed to produce the needed 700 hectares within
100 days of the original announcement, and Pemex then said the
new refinery would go to whichever state acquired the land first,
while the other state would have its existing refinery reconfigured.
According to Heroles, the Hidalgo government was the first
of the two states to complete “all the necessary requirements to
guarantee legal certainty on land ownership that the state company
requires.”
The 300,000 b/d facility to be built in Tula is expected to come
on stream in 2015, while the expansion of the Guanajuato facility
will be ready by yearend 2014.
Reyes said it will cost $673 million less for Pemex to build the

refinery in Tula than in Salamanca, largely because of lower costs
for pipelines and transport.
“The crude for the new refinery, which comes from the south
of the country, will (travel a shorter distance to reach) Tula, and
therefore the amount to be invested in pipelines and transport will
be less,” he said.
Detailing figures, Reyes said that a total of $859 million will be
invested in pipelines for the Tula refinery, compared with $1.28
billion if the Salamanca site had been chosen.
Reyes said Tula was chosen also because it can use 70,000 b/d
of residual fuels produced at existing refineries in the area, compared with just 50,000 b/d at the Guanajuato facility.

Biodiesel plant starts up at Finland refinery
Neste Oil Corp. began operating its second plant to produce
renewable diesel in late July at the company’s main refinery at Porvoo, Finland. The new plant can produce 170,000 tonnes/year of
NExBTL renewable diesel. It uses a proprietary technology that
converts bio-based inputs into a fuel that closely resembles fossil
diesel in chemical composition.
Neste Oil commissioned its first 170,000 tpy NExBTL plant,
also in Porvoo, in summer 2007 and is building two worldscale
plants in Singapore and Rotterdam capable of producing 800,000
tpy each. They are due to be completed in 2010 and 2011, repectively. Neste Oil has refineries in Porvoo and Naantali with combined refining capacity of about 260,000 b/d. In 2008, according
to the company, it had net sales of €15 billion. ✦

PNSC updates oil tanker fleet
Pakistan National Shipping Corp. (PNSC) has short-listed two
Japanese-built oil tankers for acquisition at a cost of $60 million.
PNSC said it could make the acquisitions after the finance ministry gave permission to convert its rupees into dollars.
The two vessels with twin-hulls are anchored off Turkey and
Spain. One was built in 1997 and the other in 2003. PNSC declined
to identify the vessels further. The company will proceed with the
bidding process following successful completion of inspections.
The proposed acquisitions are part of PNSC’s plan to update its
ageing tanker fleet. Except the recently acquired M/T Quetta oil
tanker, built in 2005, its other vessels have an average age of 28
years. Pakistan currently has three oil tankers, of which only the
M/T Quetta has a twin-hull. The other two, M/T Swat and M/T
Jauhar, will not be seaworthy after the 2011 deadline imposed by
the International Maritime Organization for retiring single-hull
tankers, officials said.

ExxonMobil secures Gorgon-Jansz LNG contract
ExxonMobil Corp. has secured another customer to complete its
share of LNG from the Gorgon-Jansz project by signing up PetroChina for a 20-year supply deal.
ExxonMobil will supply the Chinese company with 2.25 million
tonnes/year of LNG for 20 years. The deal is worth an estimated
$50 billion (Aus.) and comes on the heels of last week’s finalization of an agreement to supply Petronet of India with 2 million tpy
from Gorgon-Jansz (OGJ Online, Aug. 12, 2009).
The project has now received environmental approval from the
Western Australian government for the three-train 15 million tpy
liquefaction plant to be constructed on Barrow Island and is expecting word on the federal government’s environmental stance
by early September. If this is positive the way will be clear for the
Chevron Australia-led joint venture to make its final investment decision on the development within the next few months.

its proposed LNG plant. The plant will be fed by coalseam methane from the Surat and Bowen basins. The 50-50 JV secured the
230-hectare site from the Queensland government. The LNG project is scheduled to sell its first shipment to international markets
in 2014.
The companies say the project will create 10,300 jobs during
the construction period with 18,600 direct and indirect jobs created
nationally during the peak years from 2012-15. The JV intends to
lodge its environmental impact statement for the project early next
year with a final investment decision timed for the end of 2010.
Overall plans are to develop the JV’s vast CSM reserves base into
a 14-16 million tonne/year LNG plant at the Curtis Island site.

Petrobras gets license for LNG terminal
Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) has received an operating license for its 14 cu m/day LNG regasification terminal at
Guanabara Bay in Rio de Janeiro state.
Rio de Janeiro’s Environmental Institute Inea issued the license,
which also includes approval for a pipeline connecting the terminal and the future compression station in Campos Eliseos, also in
Guanabara Bay.
The license, which will be valid until July 29, 2014, enables
Petrobras subsidiary Transportadora Associada de Gas SA to operate
the facility—Brazil’s second after Pecem Port in Ceara state.
Petrobras’s Golar Spirit floating regasification plant concluded
initial tests at Guanabara Bay in April, with deliveries made via
pipeline to two gas-fired power plants in southeast Brazil.
Testing at Guanabara Bay started on Mar. 26, with regasified
LNG delivered to the two gas-fired power plants which generated
average daily output of 435 Mw and 215 Mw, respectively.
Petrobras last year completed construction and testing of the
terminal at Pecem, which has installed capacity to produce 7 million cu m/day of gas. Last month, Royal Dutch Shell PLC delivered
the first LNG to Petrobras, supplying 135,000 cu m to the Pecem
terminal under an agreement signed in 2008.
In May, Maria das Gracas Silva Foster, Petrobras gas and energy
director, said the firm plans to complete the construction of its
third LNG terminal by January 2013, adding that its capacity could
reach 20 million cu m/day of gas. ✦

We put our drives through the most grueling
tests imaginable. And then things got really bad.
In 2005 Hurricane Katrina battered the Gulf, unleashing a
relentless torrent on the platform. The equipment room that
housed TMEIC GE’s Dura-Bilt5i™ Medium Voltage drives was
ﬂooded and abandoned.
When engineers reopened the platform
in 2006, the Dura-Bilt5i drives started up
without incident. While it was an
extraordinary situation, it underscores
the reliability of our drives, even in the
world’s most demanding environments,
conditions, and climates.

Industry safety record improving

Leena Koottungal
Survey Editor/News
Writer
While researching health and safety
information on the American Petroleum
Institute’s web site, this editor found an
annual survey of nonfatal injuries and
illnesses in the workplace. According to
API’s Workplace Safety Report, the number of oil and natural gas industry jobrelated nonfatal injuries and illnesses
has decreased. In 1998 the number of
nonfatal injuries and illnesses was 4.4
per 100 fulltime workers. In 2007, that
statistic decreased to 3 per 100 fulltime
workers.
This report compares the rates
of job-related nonfatal injuries and
illnesses within the US oil and gas
industry with comparable US industries.
The oil and gas industry’s safety record
has consistently improved, reflecting its
commitment to health and safety.

Personal protective equipment
As part of the commitment to improving the safety of the industry, Red
Wing Shoe Co. announced in May the
expansion of its existing line of workwear garments to include a complete
offering of personal protective equipment for the global oil and gas industry.
Red Wing has designed a full line of
work boots specifically for oil and gas
workers.
The leather is oil-tanned, which
presaturates it and prevents it from
absorbing contaminants encountered at
drillings sites. It also makes it long-lasting. The leathers also resist many caustic
materials, which can cause work boots
to break down prematurely.
Red Wing soles are also rated for
resistance to oil and gas based upon the
16

“oil swell” test. This test measures the
percentage of how much a sole swells
when submerged in oil (the less swell
the better). This ensures that the sole
isn’t absorbing too much oil and gas,
resulting in excessive wear.

ExxonMobil is working toward a
goal of zero safety and health incidents.
By using specially tailored tools and
techniques, including ergonomics,
the number of accidents and cases of
illness at work can be reduced. Many

Unsound energy thinking
Tax torpedoes in the budget proposed by US
President Barack Obama have vital significance to
the oil and gas industry regardless of their political
fate. They indicate how the administration thinks
about energy in general and oil and gas in particular. In a word, the administration’s thinking on
these subjects is unsound.
A new study by the Energy Policy Research
Foundation Inc. (EPRINC), Washington, DC,
challenges the rationale offered by the Treasury
Department for tax changes that would hurt small
producers and major companies alike. In fact,
EPRINC says, the changes would have costly effects

Beyond the security and environmental drawbacks, a rise in imports would aggravate US fiscal
problems. EPRINC cites a 2006 study by the Oak
Ridge National Laboratory estimating the cost
of imported oil to the US economy, beyond the
market price, at $13.58/bbl in 2004 dollars. In
2009 dollars, the cost is $14.70/bbl. At that level,

Investors in the upstream oil and gas
industry have been on a roller coaster
ride for the past 5 years, with prices
reaching dizzying heights and then
plummeting. The latest twist on the roller
coaster leaves operators with a cost base
and tax rates reflecting a price environment that seems to have disappeared.
Consequently, company profits are
evaporating, and there is huge pressure
on future investment plans.
Governments of oil-producing countries are hurting,
too. With the oil price dropping (and operators’ costs
increasing), governments’ tax
margins have been squeezed
dramatically. Some governments have reduced their projected
levels of oil revenue, impacting the
budgets that they established during the
previous fiscal year.
With the added shadow of global
credit restriction, governments and
investors face tough decisions as they
prepare for the next twists on the
roller coaster. Which fiscal measures are
governments likely to consider in dealing with the unexpected dip in their
oil revenues? What impacts are these
measures likely to have on investor and
government revenues? And which fiscal
regimes are most likely to produce a
more stable outlook for governments
and investors alike during the present
downturn and beyond?

such a way that tax rates reduce automatically when prices fall. These levies
are generating much less revenue at
current prices (Fig. 1).
Another feature of recent increases in
the government take, however, was for
governments to target revenues rather
than profits by increasing royalty rates,
increasing export duties, or lowering
cost-recovery ceilings. These measures
can raise the percentage of government
take from the gross operating margin
(Fig. 2).
Following the oil price crash in
1986, many governments responded
by reducing or even abolishing royalty
rates and other regressive fiscal terms.
This response will once again be a focus
for investors in discussions with governments during the current downturn.
But because royalty is based on revenue
rather than profit, some governments
may actually be tempted to increase
rates rather than reduce them. US Interior Sec. Ken Salazar, for example, has
recently announced a review of federal
royalty rates, noting that other countries
charge higher royalty rates than the current US range of 12.5-18.5%.1
Another feature of the government
response to the mid-1980s price crash
was the reconfiguration of several fiscal
regimes to make the level of fiscal take
more sensitive to project profitability
than to revenues. Regimes following this
strategy have proven to be quite responsive during recent price increases. But, as

And that is the crux of the matter:
Can governments afford to increase
taxes on existing production, gaining
short-term revenue but running the risk
of reduced investment and reduced revenue in the future? On the other hand,
can they afford to reduce taxes now to
stimulate investment?

Fiscal twists…

Thus, governments of all oil and gas

dilemma with long-term implications:

stand in the way of this process in the
near future:
• Citizens and politicians had just
become accustomed to being resource
owners and minimizing the role of the
private sector. It is too soon to begin to
climb down from that position.
• The number of private investors
with access to capital to fund the investments has fallen dramatically.
• Those companies that remain well
funded will view any opportunities

years.
Thus, inviting the companies back in

the opportunity to create incentives for
local content by restricting deductions
to costs incurred outside the country.
Nigeria’s 2008 Petroleum Industry Bill,
for example, proposes the restriction of
deductible overseas expenditure to 80%
of the total amount spent. Kazakhstan
has also proposed updating existing
contracts to make purchasing from local
suppliers mandatory rather than simply
allowing oil companies to purchase locally when they can.
This fiscal targeting of costs adds to
operators’ need to take back control of
the supply chain and reduce costs. The
message that operators are sending to
suppliers is quite clear: “The price has
gone back down to 2004 levels, and
so should your rates.” But how quickly
they can achieve their goal remains to
be seen. Many current contracts have
been signed on a multiyear basis, based
on rates that were at an all-time high.
Companies trying to renegotiate or
simply reneging on these contracts will
be guilty of the same charge they have
made of some governments in recent
years: disregarding the sanctity of contract terms.
Is stability achievable on the fiscal
roller coaster?
Any fiscal system needs to cater to a
wide array of project economics, from
existing production in legacy fields and
incremental investment in these fields
to maintaining production through to
wildcat exploration in frontier areas.
Even without a volatile price and cost
environment, the range of risk-reward
profiles in most countries is vast.
Consequently, trying to apply one set
of fiscal rules to all projects is unlikely
to succeed, as is any attempt to apply
lower or higher taxes across the board.
Governments and investors seeking
to achieve stability on the fiscal roller
coaster will need a flexible set of terms
that acknowledge (a) the government’s
demand for a high share of profits
when economics are robust and (b)
the investor’s need for incentives to
maintain investment in more difficult
situations.

Key principles

References

Some of the key principles that governments should consider when revising fiscal regimes are as follows:
• Tax rates that respond automatically to price changes—such as pricelinked windfall levies—are far more
likely to create an investment environment without ad hoc fiscal changes
than flat tax rates.
• Fiscal terms levied on project
profits rather than on revenues are
less likely to result in developments
being postponed or production being
brought to a premature end on marginal fields.
• Focusing fiscal incentives (such
as capital allowances) on incremental
investment in older, producing fields
for tax purposes provides an incentive
to continue investing in these legacy
assets. Producers which are not reinvesting profits from such production will
then be subject to higher effective tax
rates than those which are continuing
to invest.
• Increasing local content could be
helped by adding an uplift allowance to
these costs but not by disallowing costs
spent overseas, which may be the only
source of appropriate equipment.
There are many peaks, troughs, dips,
and twists yet to come on the fiscal roller coaster. It remains to be seen which
governments will work with investors
to keep investment on the track. ✦

majority of reserves.”
The report, entitled “Thirst for African Oil,” concludes that neither Nigeria
nor Angola fits the stereotype of weak
African states being ruthlessly exploited
by resource-hungry Asian tigers.
In Nigeria’s case, a cash-hungry
political class sought to profit from its
Asian partners’ thirst for oil, while in
Angola the relationship with China was
nurtured in a pragmatic, disciplined
way to the mutual advantage of both
countries.
The report also compares the experiences of Chinese companies with
those of India, South Korea, and Japan
and assesses the growing competition
between China and India where China’s
deeper pockets have put a brake on
India’s ambitions.
Some of the report’s other key points
include:
• Neither Nigeria nor Angola has relations with Asian countries that fit the
stereotype of weak African states being
ruthlessly exploited by resource-hungry
Asian tigers. In Nigeria’s case, the
Asian-tiger stereotype was turned on
its head as a cash-hungry political class
sought to profit from its Asian partners’
thirst for oil. In Angola, by contrast, the
relationship with China was nurtured
with care and grew steadily in a pragmatic but disciplined way to the mutual
advantage of both countries.
• It is not possible to generalize
about the impact of Asian oil companies
in Africa, but it is clear that vastly different political cultures and practices have
a strong bearing on determining impact
and outcomes. While Nigeria was
playing politics with its Asian partners,
Angola was driven by economic necessity to quickly access funds to finance
its post-war recovery. Nigeria simply
lacked the imperative. As a result, the
oil-for-infrastructure concept worked in
Angola but not in Nigeria.
• Many of the general assumptions about Asian involvement in Africa
need to be revisited. The failure of the
oil-for-infrastructure deals in Nigeria
was not due to chicanery by the Asian
oil companies but rather to the failure

Coalition planning rallies against cap-and-trade program
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
A coalition of more than 100 organizations, including at least 15 oil and gas
groups, plans to hold rallies in about 20
states to express concerns about proposed federal clean air legislation before
Congress returns from its August recess.
The group’s plans, which were initially reported in an Aug. 16 Washington
Post article, were contained in an e-mail
message from American Petroleum
26

Institute Pres. Jack N. Gerard to chief
executives of API’s member companies
that environmental organization Greenpeace distributed on Aug. 17.
An API spokeswoman verified that
the document was genuine but said that
the organization was not sponsoring
the effort known as Energy Citizens.
“It’s a number of organizations including trucking, seniors, farmers, and
other groups which agrees that we need
affordable energy and we can’t lose
American jobs,” Cathy Landry told OGJ.

Gerard’s e-mail revealed how seriously the oil and gas industry is taking
the possibility that the US might adopt
a carbon cap-and-trade program to address global climate change, however.
“The objective of these rallies is to put
a human face on the impacts of unsound energy policy and to aim a loud
message at those states’ US senators to
avoid the mistakes embodied the House
climate bill and the Obama administration’s tax increases on our industry,” it
said.

An anomaly
among indicators

W

ith Congress in recess and the
Obama administration concentrating on other issues, late summer
is a good time to sample some oil
and gas statistics.
From the latest US Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index,
released Aug. 14: After rising 4.2%
in June, the transportation index
increased 0.2% in July. Most of the
moderation was due to the motor
fuel index, which fell 0.4% in July
after jumping 17.2% the previous
month, the US Department of Labor’s
statistical service said.
Petroleum import prices fell 2.8%
during July after climbing 66.6%
the previous 5 months, BLS said in
another report. “Despite the jump
between February and June, petroleum prices fell 49.9% over the past
year,” it added.
BLS’s oil import price index fell
1.6% last month from June’s level
and came in 51.1% lower than the
July 2008 figure, while its oil product price index was down 1.6% and
49.9%, respectively, for the same
periods. Its natural gas import price
index plunged 9.4% from June’s level
and was 68.8% lower than in July
2008.

WTI spot prices
How does that fit with the US
Energy Information Administration’s
latest short-term energy outlook? It
reported on Aug. 11 that the West
Texas Intermediate oil spot price
fell from $71.47/bbl on June 29 to
$59.62/bbl on July 14 before rebounding to $71.59/bbl on Aug. 3.
In its monthly statistical bulletin
for June, the American Petroleum
Institute reported on July 16 that
28

US petroleum product demand
plunged to its lowest first-half level
in more than a decade as the sluggish
economy continued to squeeze oil
consumption.
Domestic crude and condensate
production, meanwhile, grew 3.4% in
2009’s first half from the comparable
period a year earlier, it added. Crude
and product imports during 2009’s
first half were 7.6% lower year-to-year
and 12% less than the comparable
period 3 years ago, API said.
In a separate report on July 15, API
said the number of US oil wells, gas
wells, and dry holes drilled during
the second quarter fell 46% year-toyear.

Growth area
Oil and gas extraction employment within the BLS employment
survey’s construction and extraction occupation sector in July was
an estimated seasonally adjusted
169,600 jobs, 500 more than June’s
169,100 jobs and 6,900 more than
July 2008’s 162,700 jobs.
It was the 67th consecutive month
of employment growth in the subsector since December 2003, when BLS
listed 118,400 oil and gas extraction
jobs.
The subsector does not cover the
entire oil and gas industry: Gas plant
operators and refinery employees are
part of the production sector, and
wellhead pumpers and gas compressor and pumping station operators
come under BLS’s transportation
and material moving sector. But the
continuing oil and gas extraction
job growth is curiously at odds with
other government and industry statistical indicators. ✦

Red Cavaney, senior vice-president for
government affairs at ConocoPhillips.
“At the end of the day, companies
should protect the interest of their consumers and shareholders. We expect that
the bill which will come out of the Senate will look very different from what
came out of the House. From feedback
we’ve been hearing, people recognize
some of the imbalances in the House
legislation,” he told OGJ on Aug. 18. ✦

Magellan settles
charges stemming from
2004 ammonia spills
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Magellan Ammonia Pipeline Co. and
two of its former affiliates agreed to pay
a $3.65 million civil fine to resolve federal water pollution charges stemming
from two 2004 ammonia spills, the US
Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency jointly
announced.
DOJ and EPA said the company,
which is part of Magellan Midstream
Partners LP of Tulsa, and the two former
operating units, Enterprise Products
Operating and Mid-America Pipeline
Co. (Mapco), both based in Houston,
agreed to the settlement in a consent
decree filed in US District Court in Kansas City, Kan.
In a complaint filed jointly with the
consent decree, the federal government
alleged Magellan, which owned the
pipeline, and operating firms Enterprise and Mapco were responsible for
an anhydrous ammonia spill on Sept.
27, 2004, near Blair, Neb., which killed
1,000 fish along North Creek and a golf
course pond, and a second spill on Oct.
27, 2004, near Kingman, Kan., which
killed 20,000 fish along a 12.5-mile
section of Smoots Creek.

others were evacuated following the

United States, it noted. Since the US Environmental Protection Agency oversees
regulation of pollutants, it can grant
waivers to allow product markets to be
more quickly supplied during emergencies. EPA also oversees the reformulated gasoline program and the federal
renewable fuel standards.
The US Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration deals with
pipeline safety and establishes standards
for crude oil and product transportation
by pipeline, while the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission monitors energy markets and regulates interstate oil
pipelines’ rates and practices, according
to the report.
“In some cases, the individual agency efforts have resulted in the collection
of information that does not necessarily
meet the data needs of other agencies
or analysts who monitor petroleum
product markets,” it said. “For example,
federal reporting efforts have evolved
such that EIA maintain primary responsibility for collecting information on
total gasoline supply, including gasoline blendstocks, while EPA maintains
primary responsibility for capturing
another characteristic, RVP, of certain
gasoline blendstocks.”

said. “Continued and improved coordination between such agencies, including EIA, EPA, DOT, and FERC, could
improve the collective understanding
and oversight of the refining industry
and petroleum product markets,” it suggested.
The report recommended that the
EIA’s administrator assemble a panel of
representatives from these and other
federal agencies, the oil industry, public
stakeholders, and other analysts and
data users to develop a coordinated interagency strategy for closing data gaps.

systematic information about which
refiners serve which cities, and more
discrete information about petroleum
products’ entry, flow, and exit through
the US pipeline infrastructure.

Other areas of inquiry
Such a panel also could identify
additional data that could be used to
track emerging market trends, such
as the proliferation of biofuels and
special blends, and assess the costs
and benefits of collecting the information. It could identify opportunities
to coordinate federal data collection
efforts, and areas where data collection
is fragmented, such as multiple survey
instruments collecting similar information, to determine if these efforts could
be consolidated and modified to make
the information more useful and more
efficiently collected, according to the
report.
It said that EIA, after reviewing a
draft of the report, supported the recommendations, including suggestions
to review data adequacy, strengthen
interagency coordination, and fully
engage government, industry, and
public stakeholders. EIA also indicated
that it believes it has a strong program
to address all those suggestions and is
working with other agencies through
established joint programs as well as
informally to coordinate data collection.
The national energy statistical and
analysis service also issued public
notices on Dec. 9, 2008, and Feb. 28,
2009, that it would review refinery outage data, a task it expects to complete
this fall. At that time, said GAO, EIA
plans to publish its analysts’ assessments
and recommendations for possible additional data and seek further comment,
and would consider using a panel along
the lines GAO suggested in its report to
determine future steps.
Asked for his initial reactions to the
report, American Petroleum Institute
Chief Economist John C. Felmy said on
Aug. 4 that much of what GAO found
was a function of what API, which
compiles its own data, has been talking
about for some time.

“When a refinery outage involves
a specialized formula produced for a
limited area, the price impact obviously
is larger, for example,” he explained.
“Also, the relationship of suppliers with
branded and unbranded marketers is
well known. Obviously, they would give
preference to someone flying the company’s flag at retail outlets than some-

one selling under his own brand. These
conclusions are not at all surprising.
“We’re willing to talk about it. The
devil in the details is how much you
can get at, what it would cost, and any
additional burdens that would be created. But there’s a new EIA administrator, and we’d be willing to discuss it,”
Felmy told OGJ. ✦

(OGJ, Aug. 18, 2008, p. 46).
The 6 months of analysis will involve
integrating information from cuttings,
well logs, and core samples and calibrating it to 3D seismic data, said Jeff
Greenblum, chairman and chief executive officer of Energulf.
Other interests in the block are
Sintezneftegaz 70%, PetroSA 10%, and
Namibia’s state Namcor 7% carried.
Vanco Energy Co., Houston, originally shot 2,000 km of 2D seismic and
685 sq km of 3D seismic on the block
before relinquishing its interests.
The ministry said, “Seismic reinterpretation and reprocessing over the
Kunene and Hartmann prospects have
demonstrated that both these structures
can be correlated with the Apto-Albian
sediments of the South West African
margin.
“There were gas shows in the Albian
and Aptian sediments, confirmed by
wireline logging. It was not possible to
fully evaluate the hydrocarbon potential
of the penetrated section due to operational problems during testing. However, seismic interpretation suggests that
alteration of the sediments by igneous
activity may be localized to an area near
the borehole, and therefore both the
tested zones and some untested zones
have great potential.”
EnerGulf said it looks forward to
continuing the exploration program on
the remote block, 800 miles northwest
of Kudu gas field and several hundred
miles south of the nearest production
off Angola.

Flamingo Trough, Timor Sea
A two-well exploration program
could start as soon as late 2009 subject
to rig availability on Block JPDA 06-103
in the Timor Sea between northwestern
Australia and Timor-Leste.
Japan Energy Corp. took a farmout
from Oilex Ltd., Perth, to earn an interest in the large Block JPDA 06-103
production sharing contract. Oilex will
remain operator of the PSC.
The block is replete with large structures off the northeast flank of oil fields
in the Flamingo Trough (see map, OGJ,

35%, and Talisman Resources Pty. Ltd.
25% (OGJ, Mar. 17, 2008, Newsletter).
Kitan-2, 1.6 km east, went to TD 3,540
m. Early estimates are that 30-40 million
bbl of oil are recoverable from Kitan.
Eni’s proposed development area
encompasses Kitan field and a satellite
closure, Kitan South, 1.5 to 2 km south.
A development plan calls for producing
three wells through an FPSO and possibly tieing in the 1996 Jahal and 2001
Kuda Tasi marginal discoveries (OGJ
Online, July 23, 2008). Jahal and Kuda
Tasi hold a combined 10 million bbl
recoverable.
Oilex’s agreement with Japan Energy
is conditioned on the JPDA Designated
Authority extending the contract which
ends in January 2010 and approval by
the authority and other participants
who have preemption rights of the
transfer of interest to Japan Energy.
After the conditions are satisfied,
interests will be Oilex (JPDA 06-103)

The first two targets and their mean

Oilex noted that the area’s prospectivity is implied by the discovery of

western Greenland has begun to attract
exploration companies as deepwater
drilling technology has emerged.
Cairn Energy PLC, Edinburgh, said,
“The results of these wells, together
with more recent onshore geological
mapping over the past 15 years, have
confirmed the presence of all the essential elements required for the generation and trapping of hydrocarbons.”
The Bureau of Mineral Resources
points out that two breakthroughs in
the late 1980s and early 1990s changed
industry’s appreciation of the area’s
hydrocarbon prospectivity.

than was believed through the 1970s.
The other was the discovery of extensive oil seeps in the onshore Nuussuaq

The wildcat was designed to test
the Caliph 3D seismic prospect that
has several geological objectives to its
planned total depth of 4,700 m. The
license, which was awarded in 2005
and expires in 2010, is in 300-700 m

in the hole to drill ahead in sidetrack
No. 2 from a depth of 2,603 m after
having encountered hole problems in a
first sidetrack.
Besides proven oil plays in Eocene
and Cretaceous carbonates, the well
targets new gas plays in Jurassic and
Triassic clastics.
A second large lead is being worked
up on reprocessed seismic and could

The effects, however, only lasted 2
weeks, and the other two treated wells
showed no significant response.

US

Operators in the US have reported
very few MEOR field cases in the past
10 years, possibly because they have
been reluctant to reveal their production data.
In one reported project in Alabama, the operator injected only

KNO3, and NaH2PO4) into the target reservoirs to feed indigenous

The treatment increased oil production rates (Fig. 1), decreased water cut,
and decreased crude viscosity.
The estimated cost per incremental
barrel was $5.10.
Another Argentina MEOR was a
bacteria flood of the Papagayos reservoir
in Vizcacheras field.4 The top of reservoir is at 1,850 m. The reservoir has a

The project successfully controlled the
decline in oil rate (Fig. 4).
By the end of July 2004, all seven
production wells showed positive
responses to microbial treatments, and
the project had recovered about 8,700
tons of additional oil.

China, Daqing
The Daqing oil field from 2002 to
2005 had a huff-and-puff project and
microbial flooding project in the Chaoyanggou block. The project injected
bacillus cereus and brevibacillus brevis
bacteria.20
The formation has a low 55° C. tem-

perature and low 2-30 md permeability.
The treatments, conducted in 60 wells,
showed significant oil production rate
increases in 43 wells.
The project divided the wells into
three categories based on reservoir
permeability. Among the 28 wells in
the Class I reservoir with permeability
higher than 15 md, 22 wells increased
oil production.
Among the 22 Type II wells with reservoir permeability from 5 to 15 md,
15 wells increased oil production.
Of the 10 Type III wells with reservoir permeability less than 5 md, 6
wells showed a positive response.
The cumulative incremental oil pro-

duction was 9,175 tons.
Fig. 5 charts a well’s production
history in which liquid output and oil
production increased after bacterial
treatment.
For another huff-and-puff project
in the nearby Pubei block, 8 out of 10
wells increased fluid and oil production
while water cut decreased.9
Fig. 5 also shows the production history of well 7P-2.
The cumulative incremental oil
production was 1,873 tons. The block
has a low 50° C. temperature and low
103-md permeability.

of the Chao-50 unit in Chaoyanggou
field.9 The project involved 2 injectors
and 10 producers.
Seven of the 10 producers had a positive response. The oil production for
the unit increased to 700 tons/month
from 300 tons/month (Fig. 5). Water
cut decreased to about 40 from 47%.
The effect of treatment lasted 3 years.
On the other hand, the wells’ injection pressures started to decline after
bacteria treatment. This indicated the
lowering of interfacial tension and oil
viscosity were the mechanisms for enhancing production. Moreover, previous
laboratory tests also proved that bacteria
treatments lowered interfacial tension
and oil viscosity reductions under the
reservoir conditions.

China, Fuyu
Fuyu field had both huff-and-puff
and microbial flooding projects.10 The
target reservoir was shallow sandstone
with a low 30° C. temperature and relatively low 240-md permeability.
Before bacteria treatment, most wells
had high, more than 90%, water cuts.
The first attempt injected 10%
molasses solution into the reservoir to
stimulate the indigenous bacteria. The
operator, however, did not observe an
increase in oil production, indicating
that the favorable bacteria for MEOR

The fourth
attempt modified
the injection. The
attempt injected
the strain and
nutrient simultaneously with an
increased 10%
molasses concentration. Injection
of the CFJ-002
lasted for 1 week
to maximize its dominance.
As a result, the oil production
doubled for more than 1 year after
bacteria flooding (Fig. 6). Total water
cut decreased to 65% from 88% and
incremental oil recovery reached 3,392
tons.
The long-term effect of bacteria
treatment indicated that the strain
generated insoluble polymers to seal the
high-permeability channels.
The microbial treatment also shifted
the crude carbon number (Fig. 6). The
produced oil became lighter than before, which indicated that the produced
oil was from a previously unswept zone.

under sole nutrition injection.
The second attempt screened the
indigenous bacteria from reservoir
rocks to determine the strain that could
produce insoluble polymer. The screening identified a strain of CJF-002 as a
promising microbe for field trial. Based
on rDNA sequences, CJF-002 belonged
to 13 enterobacter species.
The operator tested the huff-andpuff method with CJF-002 strain in six
producing wells. After a shut-in of 10
days, four of six wells showed significant increases in oil production rate
(Fig. 10). Moreover, tests detected high
concentration of CJF-002 in the produced fluid, indicating that the selected
strain was prospering in the target
reservoir.
A third attempt applied bacteria
flooding to 2 injection wells connected
to 10 production wells. The attempt
injected a strain of CJF-002 for 2 weeks,
followed by a 1-week injection of 0.1%
molasses solution. In addition, injected
was 1, 5, and 20% molasses solutions
subsequent to bacteria injection. Waterflooding resumed after the injections.
Produced water analysis, however,
showed the concentration of CJF-002
was much lower than other species.
Moreover, the operator did not observed an increase in oil production.
This pilot test concluded that the
project should have a higher concentra-

Analysis
Most microorganisms cannot survive
high temperatures. It is thus believed
that temperature has the most significant effect on the success of MEOR
applications. In the table, of the total of
221 producers treated with bacteria,
about 76% have reservoir temperatures
below 55° C. (Fig. 7).
For the cases summarized in the
table, two projects (30 producers) did
not report the number of wells with
positive responses.
A total of 119 of the 191 producers
treated with 15 bacteria reported positive responses, which is a 62% overall
success rate.
Fig. 7 also gives the relationship

between temperature and wells with
positive responses. About 60% of the
wells with positive responses have temperatures below 55° C., and almost all
successful cases had temperatures below
85° C.
Based on the field data, one should
apply MEOR methods to formations
under 85° C., preferably below 55° C.
Bacteria also are sensitive to water
salinity. Formation water generally has
high salinity. Unfortunately, most of
the field cases reviewed did not report
water salinity.
Based on limited information, salinity less than 100,000 ppm seems a
reasonable criterion.
The permeabilities in the treated
reservoirs range from less than 1 md to
4,000 md, so that the success of MEOR
projects does not seem to depend on
reservoir permeabilities.
The treated wells often had high,
more the 75%, water cuts and low producing rates.
Another important consideration
is the mechanisms contributing to a
success MEOR applications. Some field
cases reported reductions in interfacial
tension, which indicates generation
of biosurfactant by microbes. Moreover, some cases reported an increase
in injection pressure and alteration of
injection profile. This indicates some
formations’ plugging and injected water
entering a new interval.
No field case reported a significant
increase in gas production. Gas production, therefore, is unlikely a major
contributor to enhanced oil recovery.
Another proposed MEOR mechanism
is wettability change. Core measurements in the laboratory are the bases
of wettability values. These measurements are taken normally in the early
stage of field development. Wettability
change, therefore, is almost impossible
to monitor or verify after the field is on
production.
The dominant MEOR mechanisms
may be interfacial tension reduction
and selective plugging. As stated in Part
1 of this series, most interfacial tension
measurements in the reservoir with

biosurfactant were above 1 mN/m. This
value is not low enough to mobilize
residual oil, and the biosurfactants in
reservoirs are much more diluted than
in the laboratory. The effectiveness of
interfacial tension reduction is, therefore, limited.
Porous rock contains large pores
(pore bodies) and small pores (pore
throats). Pore throats often have sizes
in the micron range. The microbes for
MEOR often are about 1 μm in size.
While flowing in porous rock, pore
throats can easily capture the microbes.
After the bacteria plugs the small pores,
injected water may divert to new intervals. This can explain the changes in
oil properties and the water injection
profile.
The reduction in interfacial tension
may not be less effective than selective
plugging in improving recovery. ✦

forecasts of US gasoline
demand for the most
part relate to predicting

industry fundamentals.
Further complicating the
forecasting exercise are the initiatives
of the administration of US President
Barack Obama. Generally designed to
reduce greenhouse gas
emissions, these initiatives result in reduced
motor-fuel demand and
a greater reliance on
biofuels.
Exacerbating these demand-side
pressures will be completion in the next
few years of several refinery expansions developed in response to expected
shortfalls in US gasoline supply. These
developments lead to a growing likelihood that petroleum-based gasoline demand may have peaked in the US at the
same time that domestic and offshore
supply increases—adding pressure on
margins and prices and seriously challenging US refiners.
To quantify these challenges, Turner,
Mason & Co., Dallas, developed five cases with varying assumptions related to
implementation of the biofuels mandate
and corporate average fuel economy

All cases show long-haul imports
will continue to be required to meet US
gasoline demand for the next 4 years.
By 2014, however, these imports begin
to fall, and by 2017 all cases but one
show long-haul imports no longer necessary to meet projected US demand.
As gasoline demand continues to
lag projected US production (including
short-haul imports), capacity rationalization will be required among refineries making up the US domestic and
short-haul systems.

CAFE; RFS2
Spurred by rising energy prices,
the US Congress in 2007 passed the
Energy Security and Independence Act
that raised the automotive fleet target
for CAFE to 35 mpg in 2020. Recent
new-car production has been around
25 mpg, according to calculations by
Turner, Mason.
In May 2009, President Obama
increased the target to 35.5 mpg and
advanced the target date 4 years to
2016. In the same month, he reaffirmed
support for renewable fuels and the US
Environmental Protection Agency offered clarifying language to the previous but less-defined 2007 program
(renewable fuel standard; RFS1).
The current program mandates a
total of 36 billion gal of renewable
fuels in 2022 with graduated targets

scenarios. Table 1 details the assumptions of the five cases and Table 2 their
results. All of the cases assume full
implementation of CAFE; and:
• Case I: Full implementation of
RFS2, VMT growth rate at the average of
the last 10 years, and constant median
age of the auto fleet.
• Case II: Case I with higher VMT
basis by excluding 2008 and shifting
the 10-year average to 1998-2007.
• Case III: Case I with no cellulosic
volume (16 billion gal) in RFS2.
• Case IV: Case I with higher median
age of auto fleet to reflect customer
resistance to higher mileage but smaller
vehicles.
• Case V: Case II (higher VMT basis)
with no cellulosic volume.
The critical component in the results
is the level of US gasoline production
and the required imports necessary to
balance.
Gasoline imports averaged
1,091,000 b/d in 2008, according to
EIA. These imports fall into two distinct
classifications: short haul and long haul.
Short-haul imports are produced
close to the US (Virgin Islands, Caribbean, Canada, etc.) and can be viewed
as an extension of the US domestic
refining system. They comprise about
33% (358,000 b/d) of the total.
Long-haul imports are generally

surplus gasoline capacity will exist by
2020. Cases III (elimination of cellulosic ethanol) and IV (slower auto fleet
turnover) both result in the need for
long-haul imports going away by 2015,
although Case IV results in a much
higher level of surplus gasoline in 2020
(891,000 b/d vs. 491,000 b/d).
The effects of reducing US gasoline
demand are multifaceted. As demand
declines, long-haul imports are the first
to be reduced. This occurs when the
over supply of gasoline depresses prices
and margins to a level that will no lon-

be supported by a necessary location
differential to justify their movement.
If long-haul imports (733,000 b/d)
are eliminated and do not figure the
incremental price for gasoline, refining
margins would likely narrow.

Model results
All the cases result in declining
petroleum-based gasoline demand
during the phase-in periods for CAFE
and biofuels (through at least 2022).
This is a result of a decline in consumer
demand brought on either by CAFE
increases more than offsetting VMT
gains or by the substitution of ethanol
for neat gasoline.
In the first four cases, imports (both
long haul and short haul) are eliminated and surplus gasoline capacity is
created by 2017 at the latest. Only in
Case V, which assumes more bullish
growth in VMT along with no production of cellulosic ethanol, does demand
continue to exceed total domestic production (including short-haul imports).
If RFS2 and CAFE are fully implemented and VMT matches the last 10
years (Case I), long-haul imports will
be eliminated by 2014 and 943,000
b/d of surplus gasoline capacity will
exist by 2020.
A more robust VMT growth assumption (Case II) eliminates long-haul
imports by 2017, and 330,000 b/d of

ger justify their movement.
This level may be deceptively low
in that European refiners may prefer to
sell gasoline at a loss in the US (large
gasoline market) than to distress-sell
the product in Europe (smaller gasoline market). This forces prices steadily
lower and, if unabated, to a point the
European refiner must either cut runs
or completely shut down.
This condition illustrates how declining gasoline demand in the US will
most likely be felt first in Europe due to
its refining-complexity disadvantage vs.
the US.
If over-supply grows more acute
and all long-haul imports have been
eliminated, margins will decline even
further as the US refining industry (and
short-haul suppliers) must rationalize
the imbalance.
To do this, new export markets can
be developed, domestic throughput can
be reduced, refineries can be closed,
or more likely a combination of these
actions will be taken to bring supply
into balance with the reduced level of
demand.
In any case, lower refining margins
will likely result in this environment, in
which the US moves from being a net
importer to a net exporter of gasoline. ✦

New sand screen
Here’s the ASW/CT premium screen, which has been
developed specifically for
through tubing completion
applications.
Its manufacturing technology has resulted in a close
tolerance method of construction that produces a slim
hole screen.
This new design involves
the use of diffusion-bonded
sintered-laminate woven
wire mesh combined with an
outer perforated protective
shroud over a perforated base
tube. The maker has developed a process to weld the media flush-on
directly to the inner perforated tube of the
screen assembly. This integrated process
helps enhance the screen’s strength.

Hazards linger
as the Obama
agenda stalls
Those raucous outbursts against healthcare reform legislation mean more than
what US President Barack Obama and his
Democratic Party stalwarts want to believe.
Americans correctly sense that their
stylish and articulate president has been
railroading them—and not just on health
care.
Attempts to discredit the backlash as
misapprehension wrought by right-wing

T h e

scaremongering look foolish.
In fact, the Congressional Budget Ofﬁce
wrecked the Obama program when it estimated that health bills written to the president’s prescription would add at least $1
trillion to the federal deﬁcit over 10 years.
CBO thus punctured Obama’s core
argument: that health-care costs will lead
to ﬁscal ruin if the government doesn’t take
control of the system and promise insurance coverage to everyone.
Rising US health costs remain a problem, of course. But Obama’s lots-for-all
solution is collapsing under the weight of
its own impossible economics.
Democrats now can hope only to pass
some light version of health-care reform
and declare victory. But the damage is
done, and Obama’s credibility has suffered.
The president similarly jumped overboard with energy and climate change
provisions of his budget proposal.
Obama wanted to raise tens of billions
of dollars from the oil and gas industry,
with tax changes, and hundreds of billions
from emitters of greenhouse gases, with
auctions of emission credits. He aimed
proceeds at renewable energy and relief for
families hurt by recession.
In Congress, however, tax changes
that would have stymied US drilling have
stalled. And the emission-credit auction has
given way to a politically malleable allocation system providing few of the front-end
dollars crucial to Obama’s wealth transfers.
These are fundamental defeats for a
president who tried to change too much
of the national economy too radically and
too quickly. American wariness of heedless liberalism is evident in recent slides in
Obama’s approval ratings.
Yet the oil and gas industry can take
no comfort in the unraveling of his hostile
political agenda. Hazards persist.
Democrats will feel obliged to rescue
their fading hero. They need a dragon to
slay. They need tax revenue. For the industry, these are reasons to worry.

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

A century of speculation
For more than 100 years, US legislators have passed laws to reduce price volatility and prevent manipulation of commodity markets. So why should today’s “new
wave of regulation” prove any better than those in the past? asks Adam Sieminski,
chief energy economist, Deutsche Bank, Washington, DC.
The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission proposes to extend to energy
futures the regulation and supervision that already exists for agricultural markets.
“But if legislation has not been able to curb excessive price moves in agricultural
prices, why should its extension to energy markets be any different?” Sieminski
asked in a recent report.
“In the past, measures to control commodity prices have ranged from raising margin requirements, increasing position limits, introducing trader reporting
requirements, naming and shaming market positions of large traders, introducing price controls, banning exports, prohibiting trading in a particular commodity
futures contract or, in the extreme, an outright ban of trading a particular commodity
future,” Sieminski reported. “With politicians and regulators appearing to downplay
the signiﬁcant mismatch between commodity supply and demand as the primary
factor driving many commodity prices, we are once again embarking on another
confrontation between regulators and speculators,” he said.
In the late 19th Century, the government introduced the ﬁrst of many bills to
regulate, ban, or tax commodity trading in the US. But legislation to curb perceived
excesses of speculation began to accelerate in the early 20th Century.
In 1921, legislation was introduced to conﬁne trade of grain futures to regulated
exchanges that allowed federal scrutiny. During the Great Depression, the Commodity Exchange Act was introduced to combat excessive declines in grain and cotton
prices, which were blamed on speculators. In 1947 as commodity prices rose during
the postwar boom, there was legislation permitting the US Secretary of Agriculture
to publish the names, addresses, and market positions of 35,000 traders. In 1973,
the US government introduced price controls, banned export of soybeans, and
increased futures margin requirements in an attempt “to reverse a trebling in many
commodity prices,” Sieminski said.
The Hunt brothers’ case
And then there was the case of oilmen Nelson Bunker and William Herbert Hunt,
sons of legendary H.L. Hunt, who were accused of attempting to corner the silver
market. The elder brother, Bunker Hunt, an extreme conservative, saw silver as a
stable commodity in a ﬁnancially unstable world—a hedge against inﬂation. So in
the 1970s, he and brother Herbert began buying silver.
According to one version of this story, the Hunts accumulated 10% of the known
world supply of silver by the mid-1970s. Another source estimated the brothers
at one time held a third of the world’s privately owned silver. In the process, they
drove up the price. After investing most of their own capital, the Hunts teamed with
wealthy Arabs to buy more silver, which in turn increased the value of their own
holdings. Others got in the game. In less than 10 years, the price of silver climbed
from $2/oz to a record $50/oz. And Bunker expected it to go higher.
In time, a worried Chicago Board of Trade and COMEX, a division of the New York
Mercantile Exchange originally known as Commodity Exchange Inc., changed their
rules, heavily restricting purchases of commodities on the margin and limiting the
size of silver contracts held by any one trader. All excess contracts were to be liquidated by February. According to sources, the Hunts’ silver position was worth $4.5
billion when the price peaked in January.
The Hunts had borrowed heavily to buy silver and were unable to satisfy ﬁnancial
obligations as the price began to fall. Facing a potential loss of $1.7 billion, the Hunts
couldn’t meet a margin call for $100 million. On Mar. 27, 1980—“Silver Thursday”—
a steep drop in silver prices sparked a panic that rocked ﬁnancial markets beyond
silver commodities and forced the sale of Hunt positions.
Fearing collapse of large Wall Street ﬁrms, a consortium of US banks provided
a $1.1 billion line of credit to the brothers so they could repay—and thus save—the
brokerage ﬁrm Bache Halsey Stuart Shields, now Prudential-Bache Securities LLC.
The Hunts pledged most of their assets, including their stake in Placid Oil, as collateral for the rescue loan, but the value of their holdings in oil, sugar, and real estate
fell steadily in the 1980s, leading to bankruptcy ﬁlings by the brothers and Placid Oil
and eventual sale of the company. In a 1989 settlement, Bunker Hunt agreed to pay
$10 million, the largest ﬁne then ever levied by the CFTC.

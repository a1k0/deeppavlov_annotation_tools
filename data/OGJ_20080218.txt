1. Practical: Specially designed high resolution MFL tools inspect non-piggable pipelines
with or without pig traps. V-LINE tools are bi-directional and allow for a single point of
entry into difficult-to-access pipeline segments.

2. Thorough: V-LINE Services offer a full picture of the pipeline’s internal and external
metal loss. Our complete, quantified assessment allows integrity decision-making with
confidence, promotes pipeline safety, and facilitates regulatory compliance.

3. Non-destructive: V-LINE Inspection Services is the lower cost, comprehensive
alternative to hydrostatic testing. Costly environmental issues and integrity-affecting
pressure cycles are eliminated. And your pipeline stays dry!

4. Precise application: Target the inspection where you need it! Critical crossings,
short segment HCAs, transfer lines, lines with non-passable fittings, lines with no traps.
And V-LINE inspection tools are great for direct assessment validation.
Contact Baker Hughes PMG and take your integrity program in new directions.

COVER
Southeast Directional Drilling performed a 5,636-ft pull of
42-in. pipe under the Mississippi River south of Vicksburg, Miss.,
for Willbros Construction.The pull was part of Willbros’s work on
the 105-mile Spread 1 of Spectra Energy and CenterPoint Energy’s
Southeast Supply Header. SESH begins at the Perryville hub in
northeast Louisiana and ends at an interconnection with the
Gulfstream Natural Gas System pipeline in Mobile County, Ala.,
connecting the Florida market with new gas production in the
Barnett Shale in East Texas and Bossier Sands in North Louisiana.
Such expansions have led to continued growth in proposed pipeline
construction projects in North America and around the world. Oil

Is CP worthless?
What kind of question is this?
Most in the pipeline industry
agree that cathodic protection
(CP) is the smart way to provide
backup corrosion protection on
underground pipelines.
But consider: If you use solid film
backed corrosion coatings, you may
be wasting money by adding CP to
the pipeline.
There is a common sense reason for
this statement. CP systems protect
pipelines by delivering electrical
current to the steel surface. Solid
film back corrosion coatings have
the property of resistivity, which
means they block electrical current.
This blocking effect is called
cathodic shielding.
The phenomenon of cathodic
shielding, or blocking of protective
CP current, has been the subject of
dozens of technical papers since the
mid 1980’s. You can review a cross
section of these papers on
Polyguard’s website.You can also

Phone: (1) 214.515.5000
www.polyguardproducts.com

view a 10 minute explanation of the
cathodic shielding process.
Worldwide, we estimate that over
half of pipelines are being coated
with solid film back coatings, such as
shrink sleeves, tapes, and 2 or 3 layer
systems. Most of these lines have CP
systems. These are the operators who
may be wasting their money on CP.
Moreover, many install shielding
coatings on girth welds, the most
vulnerable area for corrosion.
Two corrosion coatings are proven
to be non-shielding, and allow
passage of protective CP currents.
One of these coatings is FBE. The
other is Polyguard RD-6.
NACE SP0169-2007 states: “Materials
… that create electrical shielding
should not be used on the pipeline” 1.
49 CFR §192.461 states:
“External protective coating …must
…have properties compatible with any
supplemental cathodic protection.” 2

If you are concerned that your
organization is behind this curve, we
recommend:
1. Visit
polyguardproducts.com/failsafecoating.htm
and review the large body of information
about shielding problems.
2. Talk to operators who have used
Polyguard’s RD-6 system. (There are
many) Ask them if they know of any
serious corrosion or SCC ever found
under RD-6. (We don’t, even after 19
years and thousands of installations).
3. Have someone in your organization attend
the NACE course “Coatings in Conjunction
with Cathodic Protection”.

1. NACE SP0169-2007 “Control of External
Corrosion on Underground or Submergeed
Metallic Piping Systems”.

EIA: OPEC oil export revenues climbed 10% in 2007

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
earned an estimated $674.7 billion in net oil export revenues during 2007, 10% more than in 2006 when revenues totaled $612.7
billion, the US Energy Information Administration said on Feb.
12.
Saudi Arabia had the biggest share, $193.8 billion, or 29% of
the 2007 total, it indicated. That was $11 million, or 6%, more
than its $182.8 billion of oil export revenues in 2006.
On a per capita basis, OPEC’s net oil export revenues rose 8%
year-to-year to $1,147 from $1,059, according to EIA. Qatar had
the largest share of 2007’s total, $29,235, followed by the UAE
with $23,817 and Qatar with $21,619.
EIA bases its figures on estimates of countries’ production and
consumption in its latest short-term energy outlook and assumes
that exports are sold at prevailing spot prices. When a country exports several different crude grades, EIA assumes that the proportion of total net exports represented by each grade represents its
share of total domestic production.
The federal energy forecasting and analysis service predicted
that OPEC’s total oil export revenues could reach $863 billion in
2008 and $797 billion in 2009, based on its latest short-term energy outlook. In that forecast, EIA said it expects global oil markets
to ease as production increases outside OPEC and planned capacity
additions within the cartel more than offset expected moderate
world demand growth.

fractured-carbonate reservoirs will require more gas reinjection
than that, Adibi says, noting that the overall decline rate for Iranian
oil fields is 9-11%/year.
“Many industrial projects such as gas-based petrochemical
plants at Assaluyeh have no production because gas supply has
been temporarily halted to meet the increased demand from the
residential and commercial sector,” Adibi says. “NIOC has also cut
LPG supply to petrochemical projects.”
Gas processing plants fed by gas from Phases 4 and 5 of giant
offshore South Pars gas field have cut LPG exports and moved the
gas into the national grid.
Iran has halted pipeline gas exports to Turkey, to which it had
committed 970 MMscfd. Late last year it trimmed the exports to
140-180 MMscfd.
“Turkey will have a serious gas shortage if the Iranian supplies
are not resumed,” Adibi says.
The Iranian government has blamed the gas shortage on a reduction in imports from Turkmenistan related to price disputes.
But Adibi notes that the Turkem problem should have affected
only northeastern cities in Iran and says, “This shortage, which has
covered the whole country, has been caused by a failure in network
management.”
Adibi attributes the problem to conflicting gas requirements for
gas reinjection in projects managed by NIOC and for rapidly developing downstream uses in projects managed by National Iranian
Gas Co.

Cold winter trims Iranian oil, petrochem output

Nigeria’s new gas policy favors domestic market

An unusually cold winter has cut production of crude oil and
petrochemicals in Iran, reports FACTS Global Energy, Honolulu.
The chill has raised residential and commercial use of natural
gas, diverting supplies away from gas-lift operations in Iranian oil
fields and from petrochemical manufacture, says FACTS analyst Siamak Adibi.
Since early January, Adibi says, residential and commercial demand has represented 90% of total Iranian gas consumption of
15.67 bscfd and has been 18% higher than its level of a year earlier.
Gas has been cut off to reinjection projects in Parsi, Karang,
and Kupal oil fields. Reinjection at Maroon oil field has dropped to
200-300 MMscfd from 900 MMscfd, Adibi reports.
Together, those fields had been producing 930,000 b/d of
crude, about 512,000 b/d of it from Maroon field alone.
National Iranian Oil Co. (NIOC) had planned to raise gas reinjection in all of Iran’s oil fields to 7.9 bscfd in 2010 and to 10.9
bscfd by 2015.
Some Iranian engineers believe the country’s predominantly

Producers of natural gas in Nigeria will be expected to sell gas
at an affordable price to the domestic market under a new pricing
policy approved by Nigerian President Umaru Musa Yar’adua.
Gas producers also will allocate a share of their production and
resources to the domestic market rather than export it. No details
were given on what this quantity would be.
The plan underpins Yar’adua’s commitment to ensure that Nigeria develops its gas reserves for domestic use focusing in particular on electric power generation. Industries such as fertilizer
and methanol that require gas as feedstock will be able to compete
with their counterparts in other low-cost gas producing countries,
according to presidential spokesman Olusegun Adeniyi.
Adeniyi said the amount of gas reserved for domestic consumption will be periodically determined by the Minister of State (Gas)
in the Federal Ministry of Energy. Also, a new gas department will
be established in the federal energy ministry to implement the gas
policy and regulations.
Nigeria’s proved gas reserves are estimated at 184 tcf, but it has
struggled to attract investment in the electric power sector because
of low prices and a lack of regulations, leaving investors to prefer

exporting gas as LNG. Nigeria’s gas flaring has amounted to 3.5
billion boe over the past 26 years because it does not have the infrastructure to distribute gas locally (OGJ Online, Jan. 29, 2008).
Experts said that the challenge for any projects in Nigeria would
be to strike the right balance between selling gas domestically and
selling more profitably in the international LNG market.

Iraq, Kurdistan continue row over oil contracts
Disagreement over the development of Iraq’s oil and gas persists between the country’s central government in Baghdad and the
Kurdish Regional Government (KRG), as both sides continue to
insist on their respective rights.
Kurdistan Region Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani said he will
lead a delegation to Baghdad in the next 2 days for talks with the
central government over the country’s draft oil law, among other
topics.
Mahmud Uthman of the Kurdistan Alliance said the delegation
will hold talks with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on the status of the Oil and Gas Law, as well as recent and pending contracts
KRG signed with international oil companies.

KRG Oil Minister Ashti Hawrami told an oil conference in London that the Kurds have not made any decision to stop signing
new contracts with foreign firms, despite threats from the central
government to block oil exports as a result of disputes over the
legality of KRG contracts.
“Talks with other firms are still under way,” said Hawrami.
Meanwhile, reaffirming that the KRG oil contracts are illegal,
Iraqi Oil Minister Husayn al-Shahrastani has threatened to blacklist
international oil firms if they sign them.
In a published interview, Al-Shahrastani dismissed Kurdish aspirations by saying Iraq has lost decades of opportunities and wasted
a year discussing the draft Oil and Gas law.
He noted that the government has decided to expedite the rehabilitation of oil wells, adding that the exact specifications required for developing oil wells in the long run have not yet been
approved.
Al-Shahrastani also said a good contract that would give the Iraqi
government full ownership and control over the country’s oil will
be designed to encourage international oil companies to introduce
technology and provide financial resources to his country. ✦

MMS expects $362.5 million in latest RIK oil sale
The US Minerals Management Service expects to gross $362.5
million from its latest royalty-in-kind crude oil sale from federal
offshore leases in the Gulf of Mexico and Pacific Ocean, the Department of the Interior agency reported.
Six companies submitted winning bids for the 4,264,500 bbl
of crude in the January sale, or 29,050 b/d over the terms of the
contracts, MMS said Feb. 12. Delivery is scheduled to begin Apr. 1
and to conclude June 30, with the exception of one Pacific Ocean
package that was awarded for 1 year.
MMS based its estimated revenue from the sale on the current
$85/bbl for oil of this quality. It periodically conducts such sales
as part of a program which allows it to take some crude in kind
instead of receiving a cash payment. MMS then competitively sells
this royalty crude on the open market.
Chevron Products Co., ConocoPhillips Co., Exxon Mobil Oil
Corp., Sempra Trading Co., Shell Trading, and Plains Marketing LP
submitted the winning bids in the latest RIK oil sale, MMS said.

The offshore installation work is planned for 2009.
The Troll C platform is one of the assets included in Aker
Kvaerner’s long-term maintenance and modification contract
with StatoilHydro.
Troll C was installed on Troll West in 1999, and also handles
production from Fram West and East fields.
Partners in Troll West are Petoro AS 56, StatoiHydro 30.58%,
Norske Shell 8.1%, and Norske ConocoPhillips AS 1.62%.

Kvitebjorn gas, condensate production resumed
StatoilHydro AS has restarted gas and condensate production
from Kvitebjorn field in the Norwegian North Sea after repairs were
identified for the pipeline from the field to the Kollsnes processing
plant on the west coast. The line was damaged by a ship’s anchor
last fall. Gas exports from Visund, which uses the same pipeline,
also have resumed to Kollsnes.
This summer StatoilHydro will repair the pipeline, which suffered damage to its weight coating. However, in the meantime internal experts and consultants said it has “sufficient technical integrity” for temporary operation.
Kvitebjorn was scheduled to start up again in November after
production was temporarily stopped in May to stem falling reservoir pressure during its complex drilling program (OGJ Online,
May 5, 2007). The field had operated at about 50% of its 190,000
boe/d capacity since December 2006.
Production problems with this field, which started in 2004 and
came to 11 million cu m/day, was one of the reasons StatoilHydro
missed its 2007 production target. “There are no capacity restraints
now,” a company spokesman told OGJ.
Kvitebjorn is on Block 34/11, east of Gullfaks field in the North

Shell lets contract for Perdido oil ﬁeld
Royal Dutch Shell PLC has let to Technip an engineering, fabrication, and installation contract for a flowline and riser on ultradeepwater Perdido oil field in the Gulf of Mexico.
Together the flowline and steel riser will cover 8.24 miles and
the pipelines will extend 9,700 ft along the route. Technip will
weld the pipelines in Mobile, Ala., and will install them with its
Deep Blue deepwater pipelay vessel.
In November, Shell awarded Technip an EPC contract for the
Perdido umbilicals, spar hull, and mooring system (OGJ Online,
Nov. 27, 2007). Moored in about 8,000 ft of water, the spar will be
the world’s deepest spar production facility and the first with direct
vertical access, Technip said.
Perdido is 200 miles south of Freeport, Tex. Shell is the operator
with a 35% interest. Other partners include Chevron Corp. 37.5%
and BP PLC 27.5%.

Aker Clean Carbon plans Karsto CO2 capture unit
Aker Clean Carbon and the Norwegian government will establish a 725 million kroner carbon dioxide capture and sequestration unit at Karsto on the west coast of Norway. Operations are

sequestration to be cheaper than releasing emissions.
“The plant will have a capacity to remove 100,000 tonnes/year
of CO2 from exhaust gasses. Operating costs are estimated at 150
million kroner over a 3-year period,” Aker said.
Parent company Aker Kvaerner will design and construct the

Queensland Gas, BG plan Queensland LNG plant
Brisbane coal seam methane producer Queensland Gas Co. and
BG Group are proposing construction of a 3-4 million tonne/year
gas liquefaction plant on the east coast of Queensland.
This makes the fourth proposal for LNG from coal seam methane in Queensland over the past 12 months following similar plans
from Santos, Arrow Energy, and Sunshine Gas.
Queensland Gas says its facility will use a feedstock of 190 petajoules/year from its Surat basin fields in the State’s southeast.
The $8 billion (Aus.) project will require construction of the
LNG facility, to begin production in 2013, and a 380 km pipeline.
The company has not specified a location for the plant, but it is
likely to be near the port of Gladstone, which is the chosen location of the other three LNG hopefuls.
The BG Group will pay $250 million to purchase 9.8% of
Queensland Gas’ issued shares. In addition it will pay an additional
$415 million in cash for 20% of Queensland Gas’ interests in the
Surat coal seam methane acreage.
Queensland Gas will receive a further $207 million cash for the
sale of an additional 10% stake when a final investment decision
is made on the construction of the LNG plant and certification of
7,000 petajoules of 2P gas reserves.
Finally, BG Group has agreed to buy the whole of the planned
LNG production under a 20-year contract.
To prove up sufficient reserves for the deal Queensland Gas is
planning a $230 million exploration program to increase the current level of its certified 2P gas reserves (1,317 petajoules) to the
required 7,000 petajoules.
At the moment the company has more than 7,255 petajoules
of reserves and contingent resources as assessed by independent
consultants Netherland Sewell & Associates.

The Russian government will hold a meeting next week to discuss postponement of the commissioning date for the ESPO pipeline from East Siberia to the Pacific Ocean.
“I will call a meeting on the ESPO project to discuss this issue,”
said Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Naryshkin, who is responsible for the project to build the pipeline.
The announcement follows a public disagreement that took
place in late January over the pipeline’s commissioning date.
No official proposals to postpone dates of the construction of
the ESPO line had been submitted to the Industry and Energy Ministry, according to Sergei Mikhailov, director of the ministry’s department for state energy policies.
“There has been no talk about any postponement,” said Mikhailov
on Jan. 31. “Slight adjustments could be made in the construction
schedule. No one has cancelled the agreed timeframe.”
But on the same day, Andrei Sharonov, a member of the board
of directors of state pipeline monopoly Transneft, said the company
had established new deadlines for the launch of the first ESPO section, adding that letters had been sent regarding the changes.
Transneft Vice-Pres. Mikhail Barkov has since said the new dates
were to be confirmed before mid-February by a commission of
industry and energy ministry officials.
In late November 2007, Transneft’s board reported a more than
25% backlog in welding and assembly work by contractor firms.
That resulted in the pipeline’s becoming some 700 km shorter
than originally planned.
Due to that shortfall, Transneft reportedly sought to delay the
FERC issues draft EIS for Midcontinent Express
launch of the first section until September 2009.

Sasol to expand Mozambique gas pipeline
The Republic of Mozambique Pipeline Investments Co. (Pty.)
Ltd. (Rompco) has awarded Foster Wheeler South Africa (Pty.) Ltd.
an engineering, procurement, and construction contract to increase
to 147 megajoules the capacity of Rompco’s 120-megajoule pipeline between Temane gas field in Mozambique and a Sasol coalto-liquids complex in Secunda, South Africa. Initial plans for the
pipeline called for an eventual capacity of 240 megajoules.
The 26-in. pipeline, which began operations in 2004, extends
for 865 km, including 340 km in South Africa. The capacity expansion involves adding a new compressor station, including two gas
turbine-driven compressors units, at Komatipoort, South Africa,
near the border with Mozambique.
Mozambique’s Instituto Nacional de Petroleos estimates Temane’s reserves at 1 tcf, with a planned 25-year production life
from initial start-up in early 2004. Temane is held by Sasol 70%
and the Mozambican government 30%.

The proposed Midcontinent Express natural gas pipeline
would have minimal environmental impact under recommended mitigation measures, the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission concluded in a draft environmental impact
statement Feb. 8.
The 500-mile system will be developed by Midcontinent
Express Pipeline LLC, a joint venture of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP and Energy Transfer Partners LP. It will extend
from southeastern Oklahoma across Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, to Alabama.
The system would have 1.4-1.5 bcfd of gas capacity, which
could be expanded to 1.8 bcfd of gas with compression. It is
planned to go into service on Mar. 1, 2009, assuming regulatory approvals.
The project also would include a 4.1-mile lateral pipeline
in Louisiana, 111,720 hp of compression at one booster station and four mainline compressor stations, and associated
ancillary facilities, FERC said. ✦

Key preliminary results from this

quality of fuel-grade ethanol affect SCC

content of fuel-grade ethanol reduces
SCC development, and that fuel-grade
ethanol contains natural SCC inhibitors
that degrade with time. CC Technologies is also testing identified means of

Beyond the AOPL-sponsored research, both Colonial Pipeline and
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP
are working to determine the terms
under which fuel-grade ethanol can be
transported through existing pipelines
without inducing SCC. Both companies
plan to conduct tests along parts of
their respective operating clean products’ systems this year.
The cumulative results of these
efforts will go some way toward
determining the true feasibility of
economically transporting ethanol via
pipeline. ✦

March 3 – 5, 2008 / Moody Gardens Hotel & Convention Center, Galveston, Texas

SUBSEA TIEBACK
Forum & Exhibition

PennWell invites you back to the 8th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition.
SSTB has become the premier event for one of the fastest growing field
development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March 3 – 5, 2008 in
Galveston, TX at the Moody Gardens Hotel & Conference Center. Over 2,000
people and 150 exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference.You can’t
afford to miss it.
As our industry confronts new challenges, it has never been more important
to submerse yourself in them. This year’s theme is “Subsea is here, the game
is changing.” As our game changes, the sharing of knowledge and collective
experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety,
and economics of the subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by
industry leaders. As in the past, only by participating in this conference will you
be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will not be published and no
Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room
stays inside the conference room. We hope you will join us.

The empty Chavez blather
Threats by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
to stop oil sales to the US amount to empty
blather. How clarifying it would be, however, if he
tried to act on them!
The Venezuelan economy and government
depend on oil revenue. Chavez needs Petroleos de
Venezuela SA to produce and sell as much oil as
it can at prices as high as possible. He adds to the
pressure by wooing Venezuela’s neighbors with
cut-rate oil deals, placating Venezuelans with oil
and food subsidies, and channeling PDVSA’s revenue into social programs instead of investments it
should be making.
The US is Venezuela’s biggest oil customer,
absorbing in 2006 about 1.4 million b/d of its
crude and product exports of 2.2 million b/d,
according to the US Energy Information Administration. High-conversion refineries on the US
Gulf Coast can run Venezuela’s mostly heavy and
sour crude. Selling the oil in less hospitable and
more-distant markets would require steep price
discounts. And halting crude sales to the US would
divert heavy feed from Citgo, which PDVSA owns
and which has a total of 756,000 b/cd of deepconversion capacity in three wholly owned US
refineries—597,000 b/d of it on the Gulf Coast.

Moderating the threat
So Chavez, unless he has lost all judgment, will
not make PDVSA quit selling oil in the US. In fact,
he quickly moderated the threat, which came
when a British court froze as much as $12 billion
in PDVSA assets in a case brought by ExxonMobil.
The US company seeks reparation for Venezuelan
properties nationalized by the Chavez government.
“If you end up freezing and it harms us, we’re going to harm you,” Chavez blustered initially. “We
aren’t going to send oil to the United States (OGJ
Online, Feb. 12, 2008).” Later, he talked only of
suspending oil sales to ExxonMobil.
Oil serves Chavez better as a charade than as a
weapon in international affairs, which can only
backfire. His bluster, though, typifies the geopolitical mischief that US politicians seem to have in
mind when they hold up “energy independence”

as a policy goal. Promoters of energy independence seek either to eliminate importation of oil,
which is impossible, or to slash the import rate by
replacing oil with other energy forms, which is
expensive. They forget that in an interdependent
world independence comes not from zeroing out
specified imports but from economic strength.
Spending large amounts of money on noncommercial energy sources in pursuit of impossible
goals, while refusing to produce as much commercial energy as possible domestically, is no way
to stay economically strong.
Oil-exporting antagonists like Hugo Chavez are
poor reasons to throw money at energy independence. The threat doesn’t warrant the sacrifice.
If Chavez did lose his senses and halt sales of
Venezuelan oil in the US, crude prices might
jump in a trading panic but would quickly resettle
as US refiners found new sellers—probably the
traders moving in to buy from PDVSA. The move
would hurt Citgo more than other US refiners
and consumers hardly at all. Supply from outside
Venezuela quickly would fill whatever logistical
voids appeared. And the adjustment would remind
worried Americans that exporters need to sell oil
as much as importers need to buy it and thus give
the independence issue perspective it now lacks.

The SPR option
A crazy move by Chavez also would provide an
excuse—though not a justification—for the US to
tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The US could
withdraw enough oil from the SPR to cover lost
Venezuelan supply for longer than the Venezuelan
economy could endure reduced PDVSA sales volumes and—more importantly—crude prices. The
Chavez government wouldn’t last.
US retaliation of that type would of course
alarm other oil exporters, although some of them
might consider a softened oil market a price worth
paying to silence a reckless mouth that brings
undue discredit to them and the commodity they

Global oil refining capacity is set to
expand by more than 10 million b/d
over the next 7 years, with new refinery
projects in Asia accounting for roughly
40% of this total.1 New Asian refining
projects include Indian and SE Asian
export refineries, but are dominated by
expansions and greenfield projects in
China.
Driven by rapid oil product demand
growth and a desire to
slash feedstock costs,
China’s oil refining sector is expanding rapidly
and augmenting its
ability to refine a wider
variety of crude oils.
This will have geopolitical implications as China becomes able
to use more crude from a wider range
of suppliers. China’s growing ability
to refine lower quality sour and acidic
crudes may also reduce large price
differentials between these and higher
quality light, sweet crudes.
Additionally, if Beijing continues
to control Chinese oil product prices
and restrict exports of refined products
from China, Chinese refiners may face
increasing pressure to invest in refining
projects abroad as a way of escaping
price controls and enhancing share-

holder returns. PetroChina and other
major Chinese oil producers and refiners are now partially owned by private
investors, who likely will emphasize
profit before politics. Fig. 1 shows key
motivations for the participants in
China’s refining sector modernization.
China’s rising motor vehicle ownership, plans to double the size of its
road network, and its domestic firms’
huge fixed investments in steel, petrochemicals, and other energy-intensive
basic industries could drive oil imports to 7 million b/d of crude oil by
2020—double today’s imports.2 Fig.
2 shows an approximation of China’s
current oil demand structure based on
2005 data.

China’s reﬁning sector
China currently has more than 6.3
million b/d of domestic refining capacity and imports products such as fuel
oil to meet its total demand of 7.4 million b/d of crude and products. Because
the Chinese refining industry was built
around light, sweet crude supplies from
Daqing and other Chinese fields, it lags
international refiners’ ability to process
lower quality, high-sulfur and highacidic crudes, which raises feedstock
costs and narrows the list of potential
crude suppliers. Some Chinese sources
estimate that crude oil acquisition can
account for 90% of a refinery’s operating cost. Thus, being able to process a
wider variety of crudes can have a positive impact on a refiner’s profitability.
China National Petroleum Corp.
(CNPC) and Sinopec are China’s two
chief refiners, but the Chinese refining
industry counts more than 120 individual refining enterprises. One byproduct
of the large number of small refiners is
that Chinese refineries are much smaller
than the international average, processing
52,000 b/d of crude oil, compared with
the international average throughput of
114, 400 b/d. The Chinese refining sector’s relative lack of consolidation hurts
efficiency, as indicated by its high energy
consumption per ton of oil refined compared with the rest of the world.
Thus, consolidation and overall

Chinese analysts state that their
country’s oil refining sector needs reforms, including:
• Increased refinery flexibility to
reduce feedstock cost.
• Enhanced capacity for deep processing of heavy oils.
• Increased process efficiency.4
• Tighter integration between refineries, petrochemical producers, oil
ports, pipelines, and commercial and
strategic oil storage.
Chinese refining capacity will expand overall by 3.3 million b/d during
2006-11. Roughly 2.55 million b/d of
this will come from building new refineries, while the remaining 651,000 b/d
will consist of refinery expansions and
additions of hydrocrackers to enable
refineries to maximize high-value product outputs and hydrotreaters to allow

refining capacity expansion will be
major future trends. The National
Development and Reform Commission
(NDRC), China’s main energy planner,
forecasts that China will add 1.8 million
b/d of refining capacity by 2010 while
shuttering 400,000 b/d of old capacity
at small, uncompetitive plants.3 NDRC
notes that, as part of the country’s11th
5-Year Plan, Chinese firms are slated to
build at least eight 200,000 b/d refineries. Much of the new capacity will
be intended to refine heavy, sour, and
high-acid crude oils, which are more
plentiful and often cheaper than the
light, sweet crudes existing refineries
handle (Fig. 3).
NDRC also notes that Chinese refiners’ product outputs do not match the
country’s demand needs, triggering
demand for product imports to offset
this imbalance (Fig. 4). Product imbalances are particularly acute with
respect to gas oil and naptha, which are
key feedstocks for ethylene and other
petrochemicals. These factors will create
business opportunities for engineering and construction firms, technology
suppliers, and international producers
and refiners who are nimble and have
high risk appetites.

If Chinese refiners
cannot meet the bulk
of product demand,
international oil
companies will balk
at selling refined
products at a loss to China and Chinese
product importers will have to bear the
cost difference. Third, Chinese refiners
are burdened by the social demand of
keeping farmers, fisherman, car owners,
truckers, shippers, and other constituencies satisfied. Indeed, one Chinese energy analyst characterizes the situation
as: “If you wish to discuss economics,
you must also discuss politics.”
Finally, Chinese refiners must deal
with an increasingly competitive market
in which they face both domestic competition and foreign refiners as China
opens its internal oil and products
markets as stipulated by the World Trade
Organization. China’s oil wholesale
market was opened to domestic and
foreign investors in January 2007.
There are catches, however, as oil
wholesale licenses are not useful unless
accompanied by oil import and export
licenses, which typically are controlled
by CNPC, Sinopec, and affiliated operators and are tough to acquire. Companies wishing to engage in the oil
wholesale business in China must also
maintain at least 1.25 million bbl of
storage capacity, posing another barrier
to entry.10
Some Chinese analysts fear product market liberalization because they
believe stronger foreign firms might
displace Chinese companies and that
foreign ownership might rise in the
Fig. 6

*Saudi Arab medium discount to Bonny.

As Fig. 7 shows, China is drawing
its crude oil supply from an increasingly diverse array of sources. Many are
heavy, sour, or acidic. A large proportion
of Chinese offshore production from
Penglai and other fields is acidic—15%
of total domestic production— while
African crude streams also are increasingly acidic. China takes roughly one
third of its crude imports from Africa
as it works to diversify away from the
Middle East.
China’s primary Latin American oil
suppliers, Venezuela and Brazil, are also
“complex” crude suppliers. Brazilian
offshore production is predominantly
acidic, while Venezuelan oil is often
simultaneously heavy, sour, and acidic.
Venezuela wants to boost its crude
exports to China, but the transportation
economics remain uncertain. However,
a study by Roy Nersesian of Columbia
University and Poten & Partners notes
that the economics of using very large
crude carriers that offloaded in the
US Gulf of Mexico to carry Venezuelan crude on their “backhaul” voyage
compares very favorably to the costs per
barrel of carrying Venezuelan crude to
US Gulf refineries on smaller Aframax
tankers, as done in the current trade.9
Thus, if China continues to expand
its heavy and sour refining capacity, it
would become economically feasible to
greatly expand the Sino-Venezuelan oil

trade, should both sides agree to do so.
Finally, Middle Eastern supplies are
likely to occupy an increasing percentage of the global oil supply in coming years, and these barrels are almost
unanimously sour and relatively heavy.
As Chinese refiners enhance their ability
to deal with high-acid, sour, and heavy
oils, it is likely that China’s commercial
and geopolitical oil relationships with
complex crude producers in Africa and
the Middle East, as well as Venezuela
and possibly Canada, will deepen.

Product price reform
Domestic oil product pricing reforms will have a major influence on
Chinese refining development. Chinese
refiners are trapped in a tough situation,
as they must pay international prices for
imported crude oil, but must sell diesel,
gasoline, and other products at government controlled prices within China.
China’s largest refiner, Sinopec,
has a small crude oil production of
its own relative to its refining capacity and is thus particularly exposed to
high international crude prices, causing
it to lose an average of $1.09/bbl of
crude refined in 2006. In contrast, US
Gulf Coast refiners enjoyed margins of
$10-16/bbl during that time (the long
term global average is closer to $5/bbl).
Chinese refiners are torn between
several critical demands, each of which

That said, as Chinese oil
demand grows, the government’s insistence on subsidizing oil product prices could
become increasingly unsustainable, causing powerful
economic forces to drive Chinese product price liberalization, although perhaps not to
full international parity in the
near-term.
First, Chinese refiners may
shift some operations overseas
to escape price controls and
enhance shareholder returns.
This could take the form of
joint investment in overseas
projects, which would reduce
capital available for projects
desired by state regulators in
China. Or, Chinese refiners
could build wholly owned
plants abroad, which would
have an even more pronounced impact on refining
project capital availability in
China. Such moves have not
yet occurred on a large scale,
but it will be interesting to
see how Beijing reacts if refiners look to shift operations
outside of China. One possibility is that the government
might force them to import
product equal to that which they would
have produced, which would erase
most economic gains from investing in
overseas refining projects.
Second, the Chinese government will
face spiraling subsidy cost increases.
In 2005, with oil prices lower than
today’s and Chinese refiners processing
roughly 5.72 million b/d, the government had to reimburse refiners 104
yuan/bbl of oil processed, at a total cost
of 30 billion yuan ($3.7 billion).14 By
2012, China likely will be refining and
consuming as much as 9 million b/d
of oil. This means that conservatively

‘Confusing’ policies
However, Jum‘ah warned, “If
conventional and nonconventional oil
resources fall victim to well-intentioned
but ultimately flawed or confusing energy policies, then the necessary investment of time, toil, and treasure may not
materialize, and a significant proportion
of these precious resources might not

Jum‘ah acknowledged the need to
draw on alternative energy sources
to help meet future demand. “Yet a
number of well-intentioned strategies
call for a much more aggressive displacement of fossil fuels, despite major
technological, economic, infrastructure,
and public acceptance hurdles remaining in the way of achieving such targets.
That has led to considerable confusion
over what is realistic when it comes to
alternatives and what the future call on
alternatives and conventional sources
will actually be,” he said.
Market confusion and uncertainty
about the future energy mix make the
oil and gas industry’s investment decisions “more difficult than they should
be, instead of reinforcing our ability
to meet future energy demand in a
responsible, responsive manner,” said
Jum‘ah. Nonetheless, he noted that
the US Department of Energy and the
International Energy Agency in Paris
predict fossil fuels will continue to
meet 82-87% of total energy demand
through 2030.

Environmental issues
Environmental issues—“particularly
reducing greenhouse gas emissions”—
are important and pressing imperatives, “though the methods by which
they can be achieved while minimizing damage to the world’s economies
and societies, particularly in developing countries, remain divisive,” said
Jum‘ah. “Alternatives are simply not
ready to shoulder the load [from fossil
fuels], nor will they be in a position to
do so anytime soon.”
Therefore, he said, the world community must reach a consensus on
protecting the environment while at the
same time delivering the energy necessary to sustain the world’s economic
and social development.
“First, agree that we should continue
to develop fossil energy resources while
making their utilization cleaner and
more efficient. Second, craft a consensus on energy strategies that devote sufficient attention to the rational development of alternative sources of energy
and technologies, so that the level of
their contributions can be increased at a
realistic pace,” Jum‘ah recommended.
“Third, enhance the efficiency of
energy use and conservation to the
greatest extent possible; and finally,
emphasize a range of both natural
and technological solutions to carbon
sequestration based on their economics and practicality,” he said. “There is a
vast unrealized potential when it comes
to applying futuristic technological
solutions to carbon sequestration, and
the world may have just scratched the
surface on this issue.” ✦

Fresh questions
about biofuels

T

wo separate scientific studies released on Feb. 7 asked if converting forests to farm land for ethanol
crops will do more environmental
harm than good. They emerged as a
US Senate committee held a hearing on the new Renewable Fuels
Standard’s (RFS) impact on energy
markets.
“Homegrown biofuels are good
energy policy, good environmental
policy, and good national security
policy. However, there is some concern that the RFS, as enacted, risks
taking the biofuels industry backward rather than pushing it ahead,”
Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman
(D-NM) said as he opened the hearing.
He expressed particular concern
that early-year biofuel requirements
could be too aggressive, mandates for
specific technologies and feedstock
could be overly prescriptive, and environmental restrictions could be too
narrow. Congress as well as the Bush
administration continue to support
biofuels. But the studies, which came
out after the hearing, questioned the
assumption that substituting biofuels
for gasoline will reduce greenhouse
gases.

“Using a worldwide agricultural model to estimate emissions
from land use change, we found
that corn-based ethanol, instead of
producing a 20% savings, nearly
doubles greenhouse emissions over
30 years and increases greenhouse
gases for 167 years. Biofuels from
switchgrass, if grown on US corn
lands, increase emissions by 50%,”
the report said.
The second study, by the Nature
Conservancy and the University of
Minnesota, raised the issue of “carbon
debts” that could result from clearing land to plant crops for biofuels.
“Analysis suggests that biofuels produced on converted lands could, for
long periods of time, be greater net
emitters of greenhouse gases than the
fossil fuels they typically displace,”
the study continued.

‘Ignores key factors’

One leading biofuels advocate
responded promptly. “Assigning the
blame for rain forest deforestation

that play a greater role,” Renewable

tion is expected to begin ramping up in
late 2011, with full production capacity
slated for 2012 if all regulatory approvals are received promptly.
About $9 billion will be invested to
construct four stages of in situ bitumen
production. Each stage will produce
about 68,000 b/d of bitumen. Depending on operational and market conditions, excess bitumen may be sold as a
heavy crude blend, Suncor said.
About $11.6 billion will fund construction of the upgrader to process
245,000 b/d of bitumen into 200,000
b/d of crude oil. The product slate is
expected to consist of 85% sweet crude
and diesel and 15% sour crude. Oil
products will be shipped via third-party

and Suncor-owned pipelines.
Ancillary facilities include pipelines, camps, administration facilities,
cogeneration, tank farms, and a highway interchange. Another $800 million
is being spent to reduce sulfur dioxide
emissions through the construction of
a new sulfur plant. Commissioning and
start-up are expected to cost another
$820 million.
Suncor said the project is designed to
mitigate many environmental impacts
of oil sands development, particularly
water management. The company said
more than 90% of the water needed for
the in situ process is recycled. Suncor
has reduced water use per barrel by
nearly 50% during the past 5 years

and will spend $225 million to further
improve water management.
The project also calls for emissions
abatement equipment and sulfur handling systems to improve air quality and
reduce odors, while new equipment
and processes will improve energy efficiency. Suncor has reduced greenhouse
gas emission intensity at its oil sands
plant by about 50% from 1990 levels
and is investigating carbon capture and
storage to reduce absolute emissions in
the longer term.
Improvements in emissions of nitrogen oxides are expected, and Suncor
will investigate gasification options that
could turn the byproduct petroleum
coke into a clean energy source. ✦

ExxonMobil drills record extended-reach well at Sakhalin-1
Eric Watkins
Senior Correspondent
ExxonMobil Corp. has surpassed its
own world record for reaching offshore
deposits with land-based extendedreach technology, drilling from an
onshore well at its Sakhalin-1 project in
eastern Russian to a target area 7 miles
offshore.
The project team at Sakhalin-1,
which is operated by the company’s
Russian subsidiary Exxon Neftegas Ltd.,
used what ExxonMobil calls “leadingedge technologies” to drill the record
Z-12 well in half the time needed by
conventional technology.
The Z-12 well was drilled to Chayvo
field, which contains 17 of the world’s
30 longest extended-reach-drilling
wells, and set a record by achieving a
measured depth of 11,680 m.
The record exceeds by 398 m the
prior world record set in 2007 by
Exxon Neftegas’s Z-11 well, also at the
Sakhalin-1 project.
The process has been beneficial in
terms of production and environmental
safety, according to Morris Foster, president, ExxonMobil Production Co.
“This drilling success has contribut-

production 5 years after the project was
declared commercial and 100 marine
tanker shipments in the first year of
export operations,” said Foster.
“Employing extended-reach technology to drill onshore beneath the
seafloor to offshore oil and gas deposits

eliminates the need for additional offshore structures, pipelines, and associated activities.”
ExxonMobil said its “Integrated
Hole Quality” technology was used to
manage a broad range of well variables,
including rock strength and stresses and
well-bore hydraulics. It also managed
the Fast Drill optimization process that

The new oil

ell, it seems the US Department of State has decided to
start watching the world of oil and
gas on an official basis. So says US
Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice,
who plans to appoint a special envoy
for energy issues to deal with the use
of oil and gas for political means.
“It is a really important part of
diplomacy, in fact, I think I would
go so far as to say that some of the
politics of energy is warping diplomacy in certain parts of the world,”
Rice told the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee on Feb. 12.
“I do intend to appoint, and we
are looking for, a special energy
coordinator who could especially
spend time on the Central Asian and
Caspian region,” she said.
She was making her pitch on
Capitol Hill in response to questions
from Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.,
who asked about progress made on
establishing such a post as called for
in legislation approved last year.

Russia’s extortion
Lugar was especially vexed about
Russia’s use of oil and gas as a political weapon, saying among other
things that, “Moscow continues to
use energy to extort its neighbors.”
In fact, Lugar went on to explain,
“Russian foreign policy is now largely based on maximizing the political
leverage and financial earnings of its
energy supplies and dominating the
transport of energy in Eurasia.”
Lugar’s interest in this issue follows his recent journey to Azerbaijan
where he met with senior government officials and opposition leaders
in Baku. There, Lugar reaffirmed his
call for President Bush to appoint a
34

special representative for energy in
the greater Caspian region.
“Appointment of a special representative for energy would be a clear
statement of high-level US priority
for this strategically critical region.
Failure to demonstrate US commitment will jeopardize progress on
trans-Caspian energy cooperation,
with potentially devastating impacts
on long-term US security and economic interests in the region,” Lugar
said.

Big wide world
In a letter to Sec. Rice on Oct. 4,
2007, Lugar joined with Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman
Joe Biden in calling for such a position, stating that, “further opening of
the East-West energy corridor from
Central Asia through the Caucuses
and on to Western markets should
have the full backing of US diplomacy.”
Lugar praised the Baku-TbilisiCeyhan pipeline effort, saying it is
“a bold strategic initiative that today
reaps tremendous benefits…. We
must not lose sight of our long-term
interest in preventing Russian domination of energy in the Southern
Caucasus and Central Asia.”
We applaud the desire of Sen.
Lugar to keep watching the world, as
well as Sec. Rice for finally getting on
the bandwagon for oil and gas diplomacy. But let’s not forget: The world
needs diplomatic backing far beyond
confrontation with Russia.
It’s a big wide world out there,
and wherever oil and gas is to be
found, there is need for diplomacy. ✦

analyzes the amount of energy used
to make the drilling process faster and
more efficient.
The firm’s announcement coincided
with reports that OAO Gazprom plans
to sign an agreement in April or May
to buy all natural gas produced at the
Sakhalin-1 project.
“We hope that in April-May we will
be able to sign a binding agreement
with Exxon to buy 11 billion cu m[/
year] of gas,” said Gazprom’s Deputy
CEO Alexander Ananenkov at a meeting on the development of the Far East
chaired by Russia’s First Deputy Prime
Minister Dmitry Medvedev.
According to Ananenkov, gas reserves
of Sakhalin-1 fields total 500 billion cu
m, and annual production is expected
to reach 11 billion cu m.
He said the gas would be supplied
to consumers in the far eastern regions
of Russia, as well as the Far East, where
demand is expected to reach 25 billion
cu m/year by 2020.
According to the consortium partners, Sakhalin-1 comprises the Chayvo,
Odoptu, and Arkutun-Dagi field blocks,
which contain potential reserves of
about 2.3 billion bbl of oil and 485 billion cu m of gas.
Exxon Neftegas, holding 30% interest, is operator for the Sakhalin-1 group.
Partners include Japan’s Sakhalin Oil &
Gas Development Co. Ltd. 30%; RNAstra 8.5% and SakhalinmorneftegasShelf 11.5%, both affiliates of Russia’s
Rosneft; and India’s ONGC Videsh Ltd.

sets owned by state firm Petroleos de
Venezuela SA (PDVSA).
“If you end up freezing (Venezuelan
assets) and it harms us, we’re going to
harm you,” Chavez threatened, adding, “We aren’t going to send oil to the
United States.” The Venezuelan leader
also warned that US “aggression” could
cause world oil prices to spike to $200/
bbl.
While some traders dismissed
Chavez words as inconsequential, others were said to be worried about the
potential cutoff of Venezuelan oil. Light,
sweet crude for March delivery jumped
$1.64 to $93.41/bbl on the New York
Mercantile Exchange after spiking to
$94.72/bbl earlier, a 1-month high.
Chavez’s comments followed what
one commentator called “a blitz on
state television” of programs and advertisements denouncing ExxonMobil as a
predator seeking to plunder Venezuela.
The blitz came after the US firm

launched a series of lawsuits in US,
British, and Dutch courts, all aimed at
challenging Chavez’s nationalization of
a multibillion-dollar oil project formerly owned by ExxonMobil in Venezuela’s
Orinoco belt.
Last week’s court rulings in the US
and UK mean that PDVSA, Venezuela’s
main source of income, cannot sell certain assets or move some funds while
the compensation case is reviewed.
Rafael Ramirez, PDVSA president and
Venezuela’s oil minister, told a press
conference at PDVSA headquarters in
Caracas that appeals would be filed next
week in British and US courts seeking
to reverse the order.
Meanwhile, Ramirez launched into
a tirade of his own against ExxonMobil, saying, “They are the typical North
American transnational company. They
want to take [Venezuela] hostage.”
However, Bernie Picchi, an analyst
with Wall Street Access, said in a note

to clients: “Exxon is finally standing up
to a regional bully, and has shown that
it can inflict a punch at least as severe
to Venezuela than the one Venezuela
inflicted on [ExxonMobil].”
While ExxonMobil refused to participate any further in the Orinoco project,
PDVSA recently agreed to pay qualified
compensation to two of its partners,
Total SA and Statoil AS, for their reduced
stakes in the nationalized developments

An international team led by the US
Geological Survey (USGS) and India’s
Directorate General of Hydrocarbons
released the results Feb. 7 of what they
describe as the world’s most comprehensive gas hydrate field venture to
date.
In the Krishna-Godavari basin,
India’s National Gas Hydrate Program
(NGHP) Expedition 01 in 2006 delineated and sampled
one of the richest
marine gas hydrate
accumulations ever
discovered. The report said one of the
thickest and deepest
gas hydrate occurrences yet known was discovered off
the Andaman Islands, with gas hydratebearing volcanic ash layers as deep as
600 m below the seafloor. It also said,

“For the first time, a fully developed gas
hydrate system was established in the
Mahanadi basin.”
NGHP Expedition 01 was the first
modern study of gas hydrates off the
Indian peninsula and along the Andaman convergent margin with special
emphasis on the geologic and geochemical controls on the occurrence
of gas hydrate in these two diverse
settings. It was planned to explore 10
sites in four areas: the Kerala-Konkan
basin in the Arabian Sea on India’s western continental shelf; the petroliferous
Krishna-Godawari basin and Mahanadi
basin in the Bay of Bengal; and the previously unexplored Andaman Islands.
Scientists conducted ocean drilling,
coring, logging, and analytical activities to assess the geologic occurrence,
regional context, and characteristics of
gas hydrate deposits along India.
Gas hydrates are a naturally occurring, ice-like
combination of natural gas
and water formed by high
pressure and low temperatures in the world’s oceans
and polar regions. In the
1990s, the USGS made the
first systematic assessment of the volume of gas
stored in gas hydrates. Estimates range from 2,800
to 8,000,000 trillion cu
m of gas. Conventional
natural gas accumulations
(reserves and technically
recoverable undiscovered
resources) for the world
are estimated at 440 trillion cu m, USGS reported.
Proponents speculate
that this unconventional
resource could be developed in conjunction with
conventional gas fields.
However, the technical
challenges are substantial.
Proposed methods of gas
recovery from hydrates

Contact signed a joint-venture agreement
with Toreador Hungary Ltd. to drill the
exploration wells and acquire 170 sq. km
of 3D seismic in the 262,000-hectacre
Szolnok exploration licence area in eastcentral Hungary. The total cost of the two
wells and seismic is €6.7 million ($9.67
million), of which Contact will pay €1.4
million. Toreador Hungary, a subsidiary
of Dallas-based Toreador Resources Corp.
(formerly Toreador Royalty Corp.), will
operate the two drillsites.
Toreador also has operations in Turkey, Romania, and France, with a total
of 4.3 million net acres in Europe. The
company holds nearly 3.5 million acres
under license in Turkey, and discovered
gas in its Ayazli-1 exploratory well in
the western Black Sea, September 2004.
It then drilled 15 wells in the area,
dubbed the South Akcakoca subbasin
project (SASB), during 2005-07; 13

gas sales were in May 2007, and three
shallow-water platforms (Dogu Ayazli,
Ayazli, and Akkaya) began production
in 2007, according to the company.
However, a vessel damaged the pipeline
spur running to the Akkaya platform
in late November, causing a temporary
shutdown.
TPAO (the Turkish national oil company) has a 51% interest in the permit
area, Toreador has 36.75%, and Calgary’s Stratic Energy Corp. has 12.25%.
In August 2007, Toreador sold all its
US properties (interest in about 700
wells in five states) to RTF Realty Inc.
for $19.1 million (OGJ, Aug. 27, 2007,
p. 33) in order to concentrate on the
Black Sea.
According to a presentation at the
NYSSA Conf. in November, Toreador’s
first priority is continued develop-

ment of the SASB project off Turkey. It
will provide $44 million of the $120
development costs, including $2 million already spent in 2007, $27 million
budgeted for 2008, and $15 million
budgeted for 2009. This will include
drilling as many as four additional
development wells by 2009. Toreador

Global pipeline

Survey Editor

Planned pipeline construction to be completed in 2008 rose by more
than one-third from the
previous year, driven by
large crude oil transporPipelines
tation projects in both
the US and Asia-Pacific.
Plans for 2008 construction of both
natural gas and products pipelines also
expanded from those for 2007.
Operators plan to install nearly
13,500 miles in 2008 alone (Table 1),
with natural gas construction making
up 56% (more than 7,500 miles) of
the plans, based on reports from the
world’s pipeline operating companies
and data collected by Oil & Gas Journal.
Looking forward to 2008 and
beyond, greater mileage is planned for
both natural gas and products pipelines
than had been the case a year ago, with
a slight downturn in crude lines stemming from the large quantity of mileage
expected to be completed this year.
US demand for natural gas continued
to drive large infrastructure projects
such as pipelines in 2008, with a
growth of planned construction for the

seen in planned miles.
Large expansions in crude systems
in both the US and Asia-Pacific keyed a
nearly four-fold 2008 increase in miles
expected to be completed in that sector
from global totals the previous year.
Plans for construction of product
pipelines in 2008 were nearly flat globally, with a large increase in US construction expected to be completed this
year making up for steep declines in
both the Asia-Pacific and Europe.
As 2008 began, operators had announced plans to build more than
85,500 miles of crude oil, product, and
natural gas pipelines beginning this
year and extending into the next decade
(Fig. 1), a substantial increase over data
reported last year (OGJ, Feb. 19, 2007,
p. 48) in this report. Most (nearly
72%) of these plans are for natural gas
pipelines, an increase from the previous
year.

led by non-OECD Asia, which includes
China and India, where demand will
grow more than 3.2%/year.
Fueling this energy demand growth
is an acceleration of projected gross
domestic product growth in non-OECD
Asia to 5.8%/year through 2030—led
by China at 6.5%/year, the highest
projected growth rate in the world—
compared with 4.1% worldwide. EIA
ascribed the stronger global growth
projection (up from 3.0/year projected
in 2006) to more optimistic assumptions of growth in China and India.
Structural issues that have implications for medium to long-term growth
in China include the pace of reform
affecting inefficient state-owned
companies and a banking system that
is carrying a large number of nonperforming loans, according to the EIA.
The development of domestic capital
markets to help macroeconomic stability and ensure China’s large savings are
used efficiently supports the mediumterm growth projections, according to
the EIA.
In December 2007, the EIA reduced
projected US energy consumption in
2030 to 123.8 quadrillion btu, 7.4
quadrillion btu lower than the previous
year’s projection. Even with this nearly
6% drop, however, energy consumption
is still likely to increase more rapidly
than energy production. Projections
for imports’ share of consumption in
2030 slipped to 29% from 30%, with
rising fuel prices expected to both spur
domestic production and moderate
demand growth.
EIA projects domestic natural gas
production in 2030 of 19.9 tcf/year,
compared with the 21.15 tcf/year projected for 2030 in the prior year’s report. After a 2019 peak at 4.5 tcf/year,
EIA sees Lower 48 offshore production
declining to 3.5 tcf/year in 2030, as
investment is inadequate to maintain
production levels. This is both a later
peak and larger 2030 production level
than the EIA projected the previous year.
EIA, however, made a large downward revision in its projections of
natural gas consumption in 2030, now

pegged at 23.4 tcf/year vs. the 26.9 tcf/
year projected a year earlier. Expected
consumption is lower in all sectors,
particularly industrial and electric
power, which will be slowed by higher
natural gas prices and slower growth in
electricity demand.
Net pipeline imports of natural gas
from Canada and Mexico will fall from
2.9 tcf in 2006 to 0.5 tcf in 2030,
according to the EIA, which last year
pegged 2030 net pipeline imports at
0.9 tcf. EIA ascribed the difference to
both increased exports to Mexico as
the growth rate of Mexican production sinks and decreased imports from
Canada due to resource depletion in
Alberta and Canada’s growing domestic
demand.
EIA also sharply reduced the amount
of LNG it expects the US to be importing annually in 2030, from 4.5 tcf in its
2007 annual outlook to 2.9 tcf in this
year’s publication, ascribing the lower
projection to higher costs, especially of
liquefaction capacity, and decreased US

consumption due to higher natural gas
prices, slower economic growth, and
expected global competition for available LNG supplies.
Even these smaller projected volumes, however, will have to be brought
to the end-user market via pipeline, as
will future unconventional domestic
production and any new supplies from
Alaska.
OGJ has for more than 50 years
tracked applications for gas pipeline
construction to what is now called the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
Applications filed in the 12 months
ending June 30, 2007 (the most recent
1-year period surveyed), suggest continued strength in US interstate pipeline
construction.
• Some 2,032 miles of pipeline
were proposed for land construction,
but only 18 miles were proposed for
offshore work. For the earlier 12-month
period ending June 30, 2006, more
than 1,450 miles were proposed for
land construction.

Imperial Oil Ltd. 34.4%, ConocoPhillips
Canada 15.7%, Shell Canada 11.4%, and
ExxonMobil Canada 5.2%
The partners updated cost estimates
in March 2007 to $16.2 billion (Can.)
from the $7 billion (Can.) filed by
Imperial just 3 years ago. Costs include
$7.8 billion for the Mackenzie Valley mainline, $3.5 billion for the gas

pipe from Cheyenne, Wyo., and Colorado to Clarington, Ohio, is the largest
new US pipeline project undertaken in
20 years (Fig. 2). The 1.8 bcfd, $3 billion line has firm commitments in place
for 900 MMcfd, including a binding
500 MMcfd by EnCana Corp. and a conditional 400 MMcfd from the Wyoming
Natural Gas Pipeline Authority.
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP
will operate the pipeline and owns two
thirds of the project. Sempra Pipelines
& Storage holds one third of it. In
exchange for capacity commitments,
some shippers may exercise options for
equity in the project, which could give
KMP a minimum of 50% and Sempra
25% after construction.
The pipeline, which KMP expects
to be completed by June 2009, will be
brought on line in three segments.
REX-Entrega, running from Greasewood, Kanda, and Wamsutter to the
Cheyenne Hub in Colorado is already
in service. REX-West, covering the next
710 miles from the Cheyenne Hub in
Colorado to Audrain County, Mo., and
interconnecting with five other interstate pipelines, is scheduled to be in
service this month.
The 639-mile REX-East segment
from Missouri to Ohio received its
draft environmental impact statement
in November 2007. In addition to the
42-in pipeline, FERC’s REX-East draft
EIS covered the possible environmental

impacts of 20 metering stations and 7
new compressor stations, including 2 to
be built along the REX-West in Wyoming and Nebraska.
FERC noted that the REX-East project
would follow existing rights-of-way for
more than 59% of its route and would
be consistent with or conform to federal resource management plans.
Construction is scheduled to begin
in summer 2008, with targeted partial
service of the pipeline, meter stations,
and most compressor stations by the
following December. Full service is
expected by June 2009.
Kinder Morgan and Energy Transfer Partners LP will jointly develop the
Midcontinent Express Pipeline. The
1.4-bcfd pipeline will be about 500
miles long, originating near Bennington, Okla. It will run through Perryville,
La., and terminate at an interconnect
with Transco in Butler, Ala.
Pending regulatory approvals, the
$1.25 billion project will be in service
by February 2009. MEP has prearranged
binding commitments for 800 MMcfd,
including a commitment from Chesapeake Energy Marketing Inc. for 500
MMcfd.
MEP filed with FERC requesting a
certificate of public convenience and
necessity in October 2007 that would
authorize construction and operation of
the system. Construction on the pipeline is to begin this August.
Spectra Energy Transmission plans
another capacity expansion of its
9,040-mile Texas Eastern pipeline
system connecting Texas and the Gulf
Coast to the US Northeast. The project,
designated Time 3, involves expanding
the pipeline system from Oakford, Pa.,
through addition of compression and
pipeline looping. Existing rights of way
will be used where possible. At an estimated $300 million, the Time 3 project
is to enter service in late 2010.
ONEOK Partners LP and a subsidiary
of Williams Cos. Inc. have formed a
joint venture to construct and operate the 760-mile Overland Pass NGL
pipeline from Wyoming to Kansas.
The 110,000-b/d pipeline, consist-

service by the middle of this year, with
a 150 mile, 14-in. lateral from the
Piceance basin entering service in 2009.
When combined with its 440 mile,
160,000-b/d Arbuckle pipeline, from
southern Oklahoma through the Barnett
Shale to Mont Belvieu, Tex., and also set
for 2009 completion, ONEOK will have
more than 1,300 miles of NGL line in
service by then.

Canadian oil sands will surpass deepwater wells as the single largest global
source of new oil exports by the end
of this decade, according to Jeff Rubin,
chief market strategist and economist
at CIBC World Markets, the wholesale
and corporate banking arm of Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce. Rubin also
stated that Canada’s oil sands represent
50-70% of the world’s oil reserves open
to private investment, depending on
the investment climate in Nigeria and
Kazakhstan (OGJ Online, Oct. 8, 2007).
This supply’s proximity to US
demand has helped make export lines
for Canadian crude a large portion of
the work to be completed in the US
for 2008. TransCanada Corp. is preparing to begin construction this spring
on the 1,379-mile US portion of its
Keystone oil pipeline project, which
will transport oil from Canada to the US
Midwest.
Keystone will total 3,456 km, including additions to existing Canadian
pipelines and mainline flow reversals. It
is to start up in late 2009 with capacity to deliver 435,000 b/d of crude oil
from Hardisty, Alta., to the US at Wood
River and Patoka, Ill.
The company has entered into contracts or conditionally awarded about
$3 billion for major materials and pipeline construction.
TransCanada applied to Canada’s
National Energy Board in November for
additional pumping facilities to expand
Keystone’s capacity to 590,000 b/d
and extend the line to Cushing, Okla.,
starting in 2010. Based on the increased
size and scope of the project and the

executed material and service construction contracts, the Keystone project cost
is now estimated at $5.2 billion.
The plans to expand Keystone follow
successful completion of an open season that secured an additional 155,000
b/d of firm contracts for oil delivery
from Hardisty to Cushing (OGJ, July
16, 2007, p. 10).
The project has secured firm longterm contracts totaling 495,000 b/d for
an average of 18 years.
Keystone received NEB approval this
year for two major applications to construct and operate the Canadian portion
of the project. Keystone received its
final EIS from FERC in January.
The Keystone project is one of two
currently progressing systems planned
to deliver crude oil from Hardisty to the
US Midwest. Enbridge Energy Partners
LP, also of Calgary, plans its own pipeline expansion to deliver 400,000 b/d
of crude oil to the US.
The Southern Access system expansion will use 42-in. pipe to allow
for future expansions of as much as
800,000 b/d on its Canadian mainline from Hardisty to the international
border near Neche, ND, and new pipeline construction in the US. The new
pipeline will be added between Superior, Wis., and Flanagan, Ill., just west
of Chicago, on Enbridge’s Lakehead
system.
The US portion of the expansion will
cost about $1 billion and will take place
in the three stages. The first stage added
44,000 b/d of capacity in 2007 and is
52

to begin operations this year. An additional 146,000 b/d will be constructed
this year and enter service in spring
2009, with the final 210,000 b/d also
to be built in 2008 and enter service
in 2009, bringing the system up to its
400,000 b/d capacity.
The final stage will run 286 miles
of 36-in. pipe from Flanagan south to
Patoka and can be expanded to 800,000
b/d by adding pumps.
At Flanagan, the new line will also
have access to Chicago and will interconnect with Enbridge Inc.’s Spearhead
pipeline, which began deliveries to
Cushing Mar. 1, 2006.
Accompanying the Southern Access
expansion is Enbridge’s Southern Lights
180,000-b/d Chicago-to-Edmonton diluent pipeline. Shippers have committed
to 162,000 b/d, with the balance retained for spot suppliers. Enbridge will
build 674 miles of 16 or 20-in. pipe
from the Chicago area to Clearbrook,
Minn. About 442 miles of this construction uses the same right of way as the
Southern Access expansion. Enbridge
will reverse the flow of its existing Line
13 to carry the diluent from Clearbrook
to Edmonton, replacing this volume
with a new 20-in 185,000 b/d pipeline
from Cromer, Man., to Clearbrook and
an expansion of its existing Line 2.
Beyond these two projects, Enbridge
intends to build the Alberta Clipper
crude pipeline between Hardisty and
Superior, Wis. This 1,000-mile segment
is designed to resolve expected capacity constraints and to be in service by

mid-2010, after the Southern Access
program is completed and as crude oil
supplies from Western Canada continue to increase. Initial capacity will be
450,000 b/d, with ultimate capacity of
up to 800,000 b/d available.
Enbridge expects supply from Western Canada oil sands developments to
grow by as much as 1.8 million b/d by
2015.
Enbridge and ExxonMobil Pipeline
Co. also announced in December that
they will conduct commitment solicitation for a proposed new pipeline
system to transport crude from Patoka
to the Texas Gulf Coast. The new Texas
Access Pipeline would transport crude
oil sourced from the Canadian oil sands
region in Alberta and from the upper
US Midwest to refiners in Nederland
and Houston.
The proposed project consists of
construction of a 768 mile, 30-in.
pipeline to Nederland and an 88 mile,
24-in. pipeline from Nederland to a
delivery point in east Houston.
The commitment solicitation is to
secure shipper interest in executing
binding commitments to transport
specified volumes of crude oil on the
new pipeline, expected to be completed
in 2011. Its results will guide and determine further development.
Minnesota Pipe Line Co. is expanding its pipeline system to transport
additional Canadian crude to Minneapolis-St. Paul-area refiners. The company’s MinnCan Project will add a new
300 mile, 24-in. pipeline to its existing

menistan agreed to accelerate development of the proposed Caspian Gas
Pipeline. The decision followed agreement the prior month on amendments
to the gas supply contract governing
the export of Turkmen gas to Russia. On
completion in 2012, the pipeline will
extend 510 km along the coast of the
Caspian Sea—360 km through Turkmenistan and another 150 km through
Kazakhstan—before connecting with
the existing Central Asia-Center gas
pipeline network at the Russian-Kazakh
border.
Turkmen gas will also be moving
east to China. Kazakhstan and China
agreed in August 2005 to build a 40
to 48-in. natural gas pipeline running
from western Kazakhstan to China.
Now extended into Turkmenistan, the
4,350-mile pipeline is scheduled to
deliver 30 billion cu m/year by 2012.
Construction began on the Turkmen
section in August 2007. About 117
miles will be laid in Turkmenistan, 329
miles through Uzbekistan, 803 miles
through Kazakhstan, and 2,796 miles in
China as that country’s second West-East
Gas Pipeline, terminating in Guangzhou.
China plans more that 20,000 km of
domestic pipeline construction, more
than 15,000 km of which will be built
by the end of 2010, a large portion
consisting of this system.
The first West-East Gas Pipeline,
running 4,000 km from the Xinjiang
Uygar Autonomous region to Shanghai
and other eastern provinces, entered
service in 2004. It is being expanded to
17 billion cu m/year from 12 billion
cu m/year. Construction on the second
line is scheduled to start next year. It
will parallel the first line until Gansu
before separating to reach Guangzhou.
The project will comprise more than
8,500 km of line when eight branch
lines are included, at an estimated cost
of nearly $20 billion. Construction is
expected to begin this year.

construction of a pipeline link between
Skovorodino and Perevoznaya on Russia’s Pacific Coast.
China looks to import as much as
30 million tonnes/year of crude if a
pipeline spur is built from Skovorodino
to Daquing. In November 2007 the
premiers of both countries agreed that
the spur would be built and the entire
line placed in service by the end of this
year, but progress has slowed since,
Transneft cautioning that completion
of the first stage could be delayed by
several months.
Supplies along the Skovorodino-Perevoznaya route would total 50 million
tonnes/year, the bulk of which would
be exported to Japan, but hinge entirely
on a combination of continued development of the Siberian fields, other
fields, and Russia’s continued desire to
export to Japan.
Urals Energy in October 2007 received approval from Transneft to build
a pipeline tie-in from its Dulisminskoye
field to ESPO. First oil from the field is
expected to flow into ESPO during the
first half of 2009.
In December 2006, OAO Gazprom
agreed to acquire, for $7.45 billion, a
50%-plus-one share stake from Sakhalin-2 project operator Sakhalin Energy
Investment Co. Ltd.—Royal Dutch Shell
PLC, Mitsui & Co., and Mitsubishi Corp.
Construction of one onshore pipeline
section halted in July 2007 due to safety
and environmental concerns, even as
the rest of construction activity continued pace.
The total pipeline project comprises
two 800-km systems (one gas, one
oil) running from production at the
northeastern edge of Sakhalin Island to

billion, with Gazprom investing an
additional €1.3 billion in the onshore
section.
Gaz de France, and Finland have also
voiced interest in participating in the
project.
Russia began production at the
825.2 billion cu m Yuzhno Russkoye
oil and gas condensate field in December 2007. Gas from this field will be
shipped through Nord Stream once it is
completed.
Gazprom and Eni SPA agreed in
December 2007 to build the 560-mile
South Stream gas pipeline under the
Black Sea and through Bulgaria. Bulgaria and Russia reached agreement last
month. On completion, the $10 billion
line could distribute gas to northern
and southern Europe, with an estimated
capacity of 30 billion cu m/year. A feasibility study is set to be completed by
the end of this year. Participants plan to
deliver first gas through South Stream
by 2013.

New girth weld pipeline inspection system
Newly released Weldstar is a complete,
automated ultrasonic girth weld inspection
system for transmission pipelines.
The company says the system promises
gains in productivity and probability of
detection—without the hazards associated
with ionizing radiation—when compared
with traditional film-based radiographic
nondestructive testing.
The system incorporates automated
tools to set up, conduct, and report a weld
inspection. With Weldstar’s ability to size
and locate a weld defect, pipeline contractors can implement engineering methods
to assess the strength of a weld.
The product uses ultrasonic technology,
as opposed to radiography, making inspection possible immediately following the
welding process. This provides the operator with near real-time process control, the
firm points out.

New 3D laser designed to help offshore operations
This new 3D laser measurement system
is designed for use in shipbuilding and
offshore platform environments.
The FX scanner is specifically designed
to capture data to create as-built digital
drawings for existing structures. With a
360° by 270° field of view and data capture rates that can exceed 175,000 points/
sec, accurate data can be quickly captured
on a project, the firm notes.
The scanner allows users to measure
existing conditions quickly and accurately,
creating a high-resolution 3D image. Each
pixel in the image represents a 3D point in

space that can be used for virtual surveying, locating interferences, and connection
points or to create 2D and 3D computeraided drawing shapes for use with AVEVA,
Intergraph, Autodesk, Bentley, and other
design software systems.
Used in conjunction with this firm’s
FX controller software, the scanner offers
users a flexible 3D imaging solution by
providing the ability to create a low or
high-resolution data set. The scanner can
be mounted on tripods, brackets, columns,
decking, or ceiling joists.
Weighing about 22 lb, the unit allows
for easy movement on a project. Using the
company’s SceneManager software, users
are able to locate and transform the setup
locations of the scanner to known positions. The scanner supports flat targets and
spheres, depending on the needs of the
project.

Energy in need
of politically
popular change
A political campaign with “change” as a
rallying call should be good for energy policy in the US. But don’t count on anything.
Because “change” can mean whatever
anyone wants it to mean that suggests
departure from some perceived norm, it’s a
marvelously useful political word.
Early in the presidential primary season,
incantation of change galvanized the campaign of Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.). Now all

candidates of both political parties promise
to be ﬁrst-order changers.
So far, particulars don’t seem to matter
much. Change in general will do for now.
That this is so testiﬁes to widespread
American discontent.
Protracted war in Iraq no doubt explains
much about the dour US mood. And abysmal approval ratings for not only a wartime
president but also congressional leaders
from the opposition political party hint at
general disdain for Washington, DC.
There can be little doubt, too, that the
US is politically polarized. A large part of
the population craves change in the liberal
direction. Another part clamors for a conservative turn.
Now, after withdrawal of former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney from the Republican race, staunch conservatives will be seeking change from the now-likely nominee,
Sen. John McCain of Arizona, whom they
see as too liberal.
Or maybe McCain’s success means that
the Republican Party already has changed
and that orthodox conservatives haven’t yet
gotten the message.
Whatever, McCain, unless something
now unseen derails his candidacy, will effuse “change” through November. In this
wild political year, he’ll have to.
The Arizona senator might strengthen
his standing with conservatives by taking
change to where the US needs it: an energy
policy needing a strong dose of realism.
Chasing impossible dreams like energy
independence and a carbon-free energy
economy, the US is undermining its prosperity with one costly mistake after another.
Change is surely in order. A candidate
willing to resist popular but self-sacriﬁcial
energy fantasies, as McCain stood up to the
party faithful on key issues in the Senate,
would be impressive.
Alas, the senator’s voting record indicates that when he trumpets “change,”
constructive action on energy won’t be
what he has in mind.

Crude market lacks direction
Crude futures prices ﬂuctuated sharply within a $5/bbl range in a directionless
market in early February, with traders torn between fears of an economic recession
and potential threats to oil supplies.
Energy prices fell heavily Feb. 1, with the front-month crude contract dropping
$2.79 to $88.96/bbl on the New York Mercantile Exchange after the US Department of
Labor reported nonfarm payrolls fell by 17,000 in January, marking the ﬁrst monthly
decline since August 2003. However, the market was unaffected by an earlier decision that day by ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
to make no production changes. The general assumption that OPEC would take no
action had already been priced into the market, analysts said (OGJ Online, Feb. 1,
2008). The front-month crude contract rebounded above $90/bbl Feb. 4 as reports
of weekend battles in Nigeria and Iraq reminded traders of the vulnerability of oil
supplies from those regions. Analysts also said the market had gone too far with a
3% drop in the contract price Feb. 1, resulting in readjustments (OGJ Online, Feb.4,
2008). Soleil-Back Bay Research analyst Jacques H. Rousseau said US petroleum inventories should be starting a seasonal decline after rising 7% since mid-November.
“We upgraded the reﬁning sector due to our view that seasonally rising demand
and falling supply should result in a 10% decrease to reﬁned product inventories
(gasoline, distillate, and jet fuel) by the end of the ﬁrst quarter. We believe that falling
inventory levels are the key leading indicator for improvements in reﬁning margins
and stock prices,” he said.
The crude contract dipped below $89/bbl Feb. 5, wiping out the previous day’s
gains in the New York futures market, when the Institute for Supply Management’s
nonmanufacturing index fell to a reading of 41.9% for January, down from 54.4% in
December and well below the 53% reading that many economists had expected. That
was both the largest single-month drop and the second-lowest reading ever in the
index’s history. It also was the ﬁrst reading since March 2003 that dipped below 50%,
indicating that most services sector ﬁrms are contracting.
Inventories increase
Crude prices continued to fall, closing at $87.14/bbl Feb. 6 on NYMEX after the US
Energy Information Administration reported the largest 1-week gain in commercial
US inventories since March 2004 as reﬁners slowed operations in the face of weak
margins and oil imports climbed. Commercial US crude inventories rose by 7 million
bbl to 300 million bbl in the week ended Feb. 1 (OGJ Online, Feb. 6, 2008). Gasoline stocks increased by 3.6 million bbl to 227.5 million bbl—the highest level since
February 1999—while distillate fuel inventories gained 100,000 bbl to 127.1 million
bbl. “Both heating oil and diesel inventories should be drawing fast at this point, but
they have instead risen,” said Paul Horsnell at Barclays Capital Inc., London.
Imports of crude into the US increased by 458,000 b/d to 10.5 million b/d in the
week ended Feb. 1. However, the input of crude into US reﬁneries declined by 126,000
b/d to 14.5 million b/d with reﬁneries operating at 84.3% of capacity. Gasoline production decreased to 8.7 million b/d as distillate fuel production increased to 4 million b/d.
Analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc. reported, “Reﬁnery utilization continues to decrease and has now reached levels not seen since March
of 2006. Rousseau said, “Reﬁned product inventories increased more than expected…
due to lower demand and higher imports. However, the average reﬁnery utilization
rate continued to fall, suggesting lower production in the coming weeks.”
Price rises
On Feb. 7, however, crude futures prices increased modestly $88.11/bbl, ending
a sharp 2-day decline on NYMEX. The turnaround came after Royal Dutch Shell PLC
curtailed 130,000 b/d of crude exports from Nigeria, pending repair of a pipeline
damaged by rebel forces. A day earlier, Total SA was reported to have shut in production of 280,000 boe/d from the North Sea.
Crude traded at $88-91.98/bbl Feb. 8 on NYMEX before settling at $91.77/bbl, the
highest closing in more than a week, as Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez threatened to cut off exports to the US over a legal battle with ExxonMobil Corp. Courts in
the US and the UK granted ExxonMobil’s requests to freeze more than $12 billion in
assets of Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) to ensure payment for the nationalization of two Venezuelan oil projects in which the US company was involved. ExxonMobil said it also obtained attachment orders against PDVSA assets in the Netherlands and Netherlands Antilles.

Q: With the increasing concern about CO2
emissions, is the Ministry considering measures to
address this issue?

Q: Are any significant changes anticipated in
the short-term in concession agreements, or in
Egypt’s legal and tax framework as it affects the
petroleum sector?

countries to reduce the effect of green house gases
(GHG). Two of our technical staff at the ministry
participated in the former UN climate change
conference held in Nairobi in November 2006.
The Egyptian ministry of petroleum has
exerted several efforts in order to reduce the CO2
emissions such as:
• Continuing the expansion and use of natural
gas in the commercial and residential sector,
for example, during the period 1981/1982 –
2006/2007 we supplied natural gas connections
to about 2.553 million residential consumers,
and our plan is to extend natural gas to another 6
million residential consumers during the next
five years.
• Encouraging the use of natural gas instead of
liquid fuels in the transportation sector, currently
81 thousand cars have been converted to work
with natural gas; also 114 natural gas supply
stations have been established.
• Utilizing natural gas in new applications,
such as using it in air conditioning equipment,
and so we have established a specialized company
in that field.
• Applying energy conservation programs in
our refineries.

A: To answer this question it should be
noticed that most of the existing production
sharing agreement models were implemented in
the 60’s and 70’s, and although there were no
serious problems experienced in applying these
agreements, there has been a major evolution in oil
and gas technology and consequent industry
advancements, along with higher exploration and
development costs, especially in deep waters and
frontier areas, and with the recent changes in world
market prices. We found that it is time to find areas
for improvement that could lead to a better utilization
of the assets and economical environment that
would encourage more investments and lead to
further discoveries and increased production.
Development of the concession agreements is
always required to cope with changes and
challenges facing the exploration for the oil and gas
business. We are keen to introduce the necessary
changes in the model and the whole process to
reduce the cycle time and to achieve a balance in
benefit for the contractors and on the national side.
Expert committees with highly qualified staff
from different disciplines have been formed in
order to accomplish these tasks and several models
and scenarios are being evaluated currently to
modify and recommend the best models and
processes to attract more FDI and to extend the
exploration activities in new frontier areas.
Q: How do you see energy consumption
patterns changing in Egypt over the longer term?
A: I believe that for the foreseeable future, oil
and natural gas will continue to play their vital
role as main sources of energy in Egypt. Today the
petroleum energy represents 96% of the country’s
primary energy supply. The total petroleum
products and natural gas consumption increased
from 27 million tones in 1990/1991 to 54.7
million tones in 2006/2007. The electricity sector
had the largest rate of natural gas consumption and
its share represented 58%, followed by industrial
sector with share of about 26%.

A: Of course, we are concerned with the global
warming phenomenon, we are part of that world
and we are doing our best in cooperation with other

Q: In view of the capital requirements for
deepwater development and downstream
expansion, what special financial challenges do
these plans pose?
A: As you know deep water development
requires a large amount of capital as the initial
investment, and that this is directly related to the
over all economic value of the discovered reserves.
We always cooperate with the contractors and
investors to reach “a win-win” agreement especially
with gas pricing and open areas for export.
Our plan is to continue attracting international
companies to explore for oil and gas to maximize
reserves and production. Special attention will be
given to exploring resources in deeper horizons
and new areas such as Upper Egypt, the Red Sea,
and the western part of the Mediterranean.
Q: Does the Ministry contemplate new
indicatives in training and safety, or to increase
the Egyptian content in the sector’s work force?

A: Recognizing the importance of human
resources, the Ministry of Petroleum has already
begun a remarkable initiative by establishing a new
specialized company “Oil & Gas Skills”, to deliver
and organize the training and HR development
according to the international industry standard for
the petroleum sector in Egypt.
Another effort being exerted by the Ministry of
Petroleum is to establish a mining college with the
cooperation of a number of internationally recognized
universities, to upgrade the capabilities of fresh
graduates and new generations of the oil industry.
As for the health and safety domain, we strictly
monitor the adoption of new codes and ensure
the compliance of our operations to international
standards. The procedures for industrial safety are
applied in all oil, gas, petrochemical and transport
of oil goods. This is due to the involvement of
international partners and companies working in
Egypt through updating safety procedures, training
courses and strict implementations of safety
regulations in different work locations.

Interview with the Minister of Petroleum

cooperation in the oil and gas industry as a whole.
There are presently more than 50 international
companies working in the field of exploration for
oil and gas in Egypt, with investments estimated
at about $2 billion annually. While Egypt for its
part, has committed about $3 billion of its own
money to upgrade infrastructure within the sector.

Q: What is the most daunting single challenge
facing Egypt’s oil sector – technical, financial, social –
in the next decade and what will the Ministry’s role
be in meeting that challenge?
A: The major challenges facing the Egyptian
petroleum sectors are:
• The huge and continuous increase in the local
consumption of petroleum products and natural gas.
• Most current petroleum agreements are
approaching their end.
• Emergence of new regions for foreign
investments such as Libya, Iraq, Sudan and
Western Africa.
• The lack of oil rigs on the world level.
• The fast development of the specifications of
fuel petroleum products.
• The rapid increase of prices for raw materials
and equipment worldwide, which cause the increase
in the investment and operating costs leading to an
increase in the final products prices.
• Scarcity of qualified contractors for oil and
gas projects.
To confront these challenges, the Ministry of
Petroleum is applying a flexible strategy to assure
the rational use of our petroleum wealth and to
guarantee the continuation of assuring its role to
achieve the goals of the Egyptian economic
development plans.
This strategy includes the following:
• Increasing and developing the crude oil and
natural gas reserves;
• Satisfying the local demand for the petroleum
products, natural gas and petrochemicals;
• Increasing the petroleum exports, and
consequently increasing Egypt’s revenues from
foreign currency;
• Attraction from FDI to the petroleum sector
projects;
• Environment preservation;
• Increasing job opportunities, and improving
the performance of the petroleum employees;
• International cooperation with different
technological institutes and adopting the most up
to date international technology.

Egypt’s Petroleum Future

Egypt’s Petroleum Future:
Adding value to natural gas, developing
deepwater prospects are key goals

E

gypt began the ascent to its position as
a leading global energy player by
leveraging its strategic location. Building the
Suez Mediterranean (Sumed) pipeline to
augment the Suez Canal, the country put
together a critical transportation infrastructure
that linked large oil reserves to world markets.
It was an auspicious beginning. But it was
only the first step towards optimizing the value
of Egypt’s own petroleum resources. Next, a
long-term strategy was developed to accelerate
reserves and production growth, and to
expand the capabilities of Egyptian companies
to drive that growth well into the future.
An important goal of that strategy is to
realize the full potential of Egypt’s natural gas
resource, much of which lies in the deep water
of the Mediterranean. In addition, a master
plan will help wring the most value from that
resource by expanding petrochemical,
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and liquefied
natural gas (LNG) capacity to serve domestic
demand and capitalize on export markets.
Together, its history and its energy
strategy promise a bright future for Egypt’s
petroleum industry. To help reach that future,
the country offers:
• Tempting oil and gas prospects;
• Political, financial and legal stability;
• Established international relationships;
• A skilled, educated, enthusiastic workforce;
• Keen environmental responsibility.

Deep water and gas
Along with its other natural and human
resources and its physical assets, natural
gas—especially that which lies in deep
water—is critical to Egypt’s energy future.
As of June 30, 2007, Egyptian Natural
Gas Holding Co. (EGAS) estimated Egypt’s
gas reserves at 72.3 trillion cubic feet (tcf).
An estimated 78% of this resource is in the
Mediterranean, 4% in the Nile Delta onshore,
10% in the Western Desert area and 8% in
the Gulf of Suez.

Labouring in the oil and gas sector.

Rashpetco’s P1 unmanned platform, Rosetta.

Yet-to-find reserves may total as much as
120 tcf, according to EGAS.
Other reports are even more optimistic.
One estimate puts ultimate reserves in the
ultra-deep water alone at 70 tcf. Another
report puts total reserves at 128 tcf, including
80 tcf in the Mediterranean deep water and
28 tcf in shallow water; 9 tcf in the Nile Delta
onshore; and 11 tcf in the Western Desert.

Badr El-Din
Formed to develop and explore for oil and
associated gas in Egypt’s Western Desert,
Badr El-Din Petroleum Co. (Bapetco)—a 5050 joint venture between Shell Egypt N.V.
and Egyptian General Petroleum Corp.
(EGPC)—has played a significant role in the

launch of Egypt’s growing gas industry.
Currently one of the country’s largest gas
producers, Bapetco was established in 1983
after the Badr El-Din (BED) field in the
Western Desert about 130 km (81 miles)
southwest of Alexandria was declared
commercial. Now the company operates in
other areas of the Western Desert on behalf of
EGPC and Shell Egypt.
Bapetco’s in-place gas reserves were 2,935
billion cu ft (bcf) at the beginning of fiscal
2007; ultimate recoverable reserves were
estimated at 1,882 bcf. Bulk of the company’s
220 bcf of remaining reserve is in three fields
in the Badr El-Din concession—BED-2 (88
bcf), BED-3 (72 bcf) and BED-15 (43 bcf).
Its first gas sales, from the BED-3 field,
were in 1990; in 1999, it delivered first gas
from the Obaiyed field to the Obaiyed gas
plant. Bapetco gas production during fiscal
2005-2006 averaged 223 MMcfd.
Bapetco also held about 121 million bbl
of recoverable oil reserves and 40 million bbl
of recoverable condensate at the end of last
fiscal year.
With a focus on exploration, spending
during 2005/2006 fiscal year was US$171
million, including exploration cost of about
US$28 million and development expense
of US$89 million. Operating cost was
US$25 million.

HSE performance
The record tells the story of Bapetco’s intense,
continuous focus on improving health, safety,
and environmental (HSE) performance. After
its formation in 1983, the company achieved
3 million man hours without a lost time
incident (LTI) in 1993; 5 million man hours
without LTI for staff and contractors in 1998;
and 12 million LTI-free man hours for Bapetco
and contractors in 2000.
There were no fatalities during last fiscal
year, and staff achieved 2.6 million hours free
of a lost time incident on 31st of January 2006.

Other metrics also highlight Bapetco’s
HSE performance:
• The BED area project team reached six
years without an LTI in August 2005;
• In April 2006, Al Hamra area
completed 19 years free of LTIs, and;
• In December 2005, Al Amereya
achieved 15 LTI-free years.
The corporate HSE plan issued in February
2006 achieved more than 40% of its objectives
by June, meeting its target.
Bapetco’s HSE policy includes a biodiversity
standard and road transport safety guidelines;
it also covers issues of smoking and alcohol/
drug abuse. Training sessions are continuous,
evacuation drills are conducted, health and
medical audits are performed and radiation
surveys are conducted.
In 2006 the company passed the inspection
for IS014001 for the eighth year in a row,
and OHSAS 18001 was renewed for the
second time.

WDDM development
Burullus Gas Co., responsible for developing
the West Delta Deep Marine (WDDM)
concession, has completed Phase I of the
development, the Scarab/Saffron project.
And Rashid Petroleum Co., formed following
the signature of the gas sales agreement and
sanction of the Rosetta Phase I project to
develop the concession, is in the process of
implementing the next phases of the field’s

development. Partners in Rashpetco are
EGPC, BG Egypt S.A., Shell Egypt and
Edison Gas International.
The Scarab/Saffron concession, about 90
km (56 miles) from the Nile Delta shoreline in
the Eastern Mediterranean is in water depths
ranging from 250 m to 850 m (about 8002,800 ft). The Scarab/Saffron development
area is located in the Western half of the
concession about 100 km (62 miles) offshore
Idku, near Alexandria.
The two main structures in the Phase I
area—Scarab and Saffron—hold natural gas
that contains a very small amount of
condensate, no hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and
little carbon dioxide (CO2). The Simian,
Sienna and Sapphire fields, in water depths
of 900-1,100 m (about 2,950-3,610 ft),
comprise Phases II and III of the concession
development. Simian/Sienna and Sapphire
were commissioned in 2005.
The next development phase will involve
a new field, Sequoia, scheduled to be on
stream by 2009. It will produce dry gas through
subsea completions. Since it extends into both
the WDDM and Rosetta concessions, North
Sequoia will be tied to WDDM facilities and
south Sequoia to the Rosetta facilities.

Commercial oil in the south
Established in 2003, Ganoub El Wadi Petroleum
Holding Co. (Ganope) made its first oil discovery
in the southern part of Egypt. Proving the

presence of oil source rocks system in the
Upper Egypt, the discovery will play a major
role in changing the geological theories
applied to the southern part of the country,
according to Ganope.
The Al-Baraka-1 well was drilled by Dana
Petroleum (E&P) Ltd. to a total depth of
2,655 m (8,712 ft), penetrating several oil
bearing zones. Testing of the early Cretaceous
Abu Ballas sandstone indicated proven
reserves of about 8 million bbl of oil and
produced approximately 150 b/d of oil from
a 12-m (39-ft) perforated interval. The oil has
a specific gravity of 37.3º API and wax content
similar to the oil being produced in Sudan.
Oil shows while drilling also came from
three additional zones in the upper and
lower Cretaceous and Jurassic formations.
The development plan called for putting
Al-Baraka discovery in production by the
end of 2007, making it the first commercial
oil well in southern Egypt.
The Komombo concession, 700 km (435
miles) from Cairo and 320 km (199 miles)
from the nearest refinery at Assiut, is one of
ten concession areas Ganope has been
awarded in Upper Egypt, the western desert
and the Red Sea. Agreements for seven are
signed; three are pending.
Total area of the ten concessions is 219,000
sq km (84,556 sq miles). The agreements call
for the company to spend a total of US$282
million and drill 46 exploratory wells.

Development:
Technology will aid recovery from complex

t its most fundamental, deepwater
exploration and development is
about cost and risk. In the past two decades,
advancing technology has made it possible to
dramatically reduce both. The result is increased
exploration success and a lower commercial
threshold that makes more discoveries—in
ever deeper water—commercially viable.
Petroleum demand will continue to grow
and deep water fields will be increasingly
important in meeting that demand.
In late 2007, Douglas-Westwood updated
its World Deepwater Market Report to cover
2008-2012. The report, for water depths of
500 m (1,640 ft) and more, forecasts annual
worldwide capital spending will reach nearly
$25 billion over the period. “The deepwater oil
and gas industry is set for continued growth
through to 2012, with over 30% growth
forecast for 2008-2012, compared with the
previous five years,” said John Westwood,
Managing Director, at PennWell’s Deep
Offshore Technology International Conference
and Exhibition in Stavanger.
Deepwater oil production currently accounts
for almost 15% of total offshore production,
but deep water will represent about 20% of
offshore production by 2011, he said. Together,
Africa, the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil will
account for 84% of global deepwater spending
over the period, said Westwood.
Advancing technology continues to bring
new discoveries in Egypt’s existing concessions.
And it enhances interest in prospects in even
deeper water, as evidenced by the results of a
recent bidding round.
But executing Egypt’s deepwater projects pose
a wide variety of technical challenges, including a
difficult geo-technical environment, a variety of
reservoir pressures and fluid compositions,
and high temperature/high pressure conditions.
Besides meeting these immediate challenges in
each development project, the high cost of
deepwater operations makes it important to
provide for future growth and expansion.

THE INJAZ PROJECT
BP Egypt has been always a strong
supporter of the local Injaz project. Injaz
Egypt was originally implemented by
Save the Children Federation Inc. and is
contributing to Egypt’s drive to promote
a private sector based economy by
teaching young public school children
the basics of economics.
Injaz Egypt aims to help young people
gain an understanding of: the importance
of personal strategic planning; marketdriven economies; business in a global
economy; business commitment in
environmental and social issues; education
in the workplace; and the impact of
economics on their future.
BP Egypt employees have been very
dedicated over the years and even
volunteer teaching preparatory public
school children (age group 13-15) an
Injaz pre-designed curriculum called
“Success Skills” by donating one hour per
week for a period of 10 weeks.

In Egypt’s prospective deepwater areas, the
spectrum of technology available today to
understand and optimize the life cycle value of
a discovery is especially important because of
the complexity of many of the productive zones.
The main producing reservoirs in the
western part of the Nile Delta deep water are
mostly submarine channel features, with
extended submarine fans farther north. Sealing
rocks are provided by the intra-formational
Pliocene-Pleistocene mud stone.
Gas comes from both thermogenic and
biogenic sources and includes some condensate.
Only shallow reservoirs in one or two fields
contain gas entirely from a biogenic origin; the
majority of discoveries suggests a predominantly
thermogenic origin.
Migration of hydrocarbons from OligoceneMiocene source rocks probably occurred along
the active faults. Currently, evidence of the preTertiary sources is proven by carbon isotopes.
The major structural elements are the
southwest/northeast trending Rosetta fault and
the east-northeast/west-southwest trending
Nile Delta offshore anticline (NDOA) high.
Both of these were active at various periods
during the Pliocene-Pleistocene periods. But
they have not had a major impact on the
depositional geometries of the Upper Pliocene
channels, which when traced in map and
seismic sections, show no significant thickening
or change in style across the features.
The crestal part of the east-northeast
trending NDOA is collapsed by a tectonic listric
fan developed in response to a cycle of negative
tectonic inversion where the extensional regime
dominated in the Upper Early Pliocene. This
indicates that the time of the tectonic inversion
along the east-northeast trend is younger than
that on the northeast-trending Rosetta belt.

Applying technology
Using up-to-date techniques enhances reservoir
understanding, leading to a more accurate

estimate of reserves, and better well and
reservoir optimization. Rashpetco uses the
latest technology to maximize hydrocarbon
productivity and reduce development risk in
the offshore deltaic area.
Seismic inversion is used to calculate the
relative and absolute acoustic impedance to
discriminate between the hydrocarbon bearing
sands and non-reservoir zones. However, this
technology may fail to discriminate between
shale and water-bearing sand, according to the
company, and pre-stack amplitude variation
with offset (AVO) inversion was used
successfully as a lithology and fluid indicator.
The technique reduces drilling risk and
improves static and dynamic reservoir models.
The rock physics model is also essential in
offshore deltaic sequences, according to
Rashpetco.
In addition to defining lithology and fluid
content, parallel multiple 3D seismic attributes
are used to define the stratigraphic and
structural setting of the area. Long offset

seismic re-processing trials reduce risk by
enhancing the horizontal and vertical
resolutions of reservoir sequences.
Thin bedded intervals containing
significant amounts of net pay identified in the
Mediterranean are considered by Rashpetco
as potential development targets. These thin
bed successions are often less than 10 cm
thick, sandstone and siltstone sheets deposited
from sediment gravity flows and inter-bedded
with shale.
Lateral continuity, connectivity and bed
lengths are important influences on reservoir
performance and recovery that cannot be
deduced from seismic and conventional well
log data. Rashpetco used combinations of tools
in different fields to image these unconventional
pays and quantify hydrocarbon pore volume.
Reservoir modeling was used to test the
impact of these unconventional pays on gasin-place calculations.
Hardware upgrades are also necessary to be
able to use the latest modeling and analysis

Late last year, Statoil ASA was awarded two
deepwater blocks in Egypt’s most recent
bidding round in water depths between 1,000
and 3,000 m (3,280-9,840 ft).
Statoil is operator and an 80% working
interest owner in Block 10, the second award
of exploration acreage secured by the group
late last year. Sonatrach International Petroleum
Exploration & Production (Sipex), a whollyowned subsidiary of Algerian state oil and gas
company Sonatrach, owns a 20% working
interest. The block will be operated under a
production sharing agreement.
Earlier, Statoil was awarded an 80%
working interest in block 9 in the area and will
be the operator of the block. Blocks 9 and 10
are west of the Nile Delta, and cover areas of
8,368 sq km (3,231 sq miles) and 9,802 sq km
(3,785 sq miles) respectively.
Shell Egypt, too, has a long history of
investment in oil and gas exploration in Egypt. In
recent years, the company has increasingly
targeted gas exploration, in line with Egypt’s drive
to develop its gas resources. Shell Egypt won the
Northeast Mediterranean Deepwater Concession
in 1998, a large concession north of the Nile
Delta in water depths between 800 and 2,800 m
(2,625-9,185 ft). The company committed $150
million to a preliminary five-year exploration
period, and two of these exploration wells were
completed in 2000/2001.
Shell Egypt’s reservoir modeling expertise
has been useful in the complex geology of the
Western Desert, as well as in the North East
Mediterranean deepwater concession.
Shell Egypt is a 40% equity owner in the
Rosetta field, which came on stream in
January 2001.
Operated by Rashpetco, Phases I and II of the
concession development is complete. Rosetta
Phase II includes four development wells on an
unmanned offshore platform producing about
230 MMcfd for the domestic market. Rosetta
Phase III was under way at mid 2007.

Development:
Work continues in existing fields, new
discoveries await plans

ith the bulk of its natural gas resource
in the Mediterranean—some studies
estimate ultimate recovery from deepwater gas
reserves at up to 70 tcf—and a strategic focus
on optimizing the value of its natural gas
supply, meeting deepwater challenges will be
vital to Egypt’s energy future.
As development continues in the West
Delta Deep Marine and Rosetta concessions,
new deepwater discoveries also continue to
be made. Recent discoveries in the Rosetta
concession area, for example, include Mina,
Silva, Saurus and Sienna. Development plans
for those fields are in progress.
The Mina-1 well indicated a reservoir
pressure of about 6,100 psia and a reservoir
temperature of 201 °F (94 °C). Silva reservoir
pressure is about 4,900 psia and temperature is
162 °F (72 °C). And the Sienna UP-2 well
measured reservoir pressure of more than
3,300 psia and a temperature of 129 °F (53 °C).

The export pipelines were initially sized
as 20 in. and 22 in., but were subsequently
increased to 24 in. and 36 in. to accommodate
additional wells.
Wells are controlled from shore using a
multiplexed electro-hydraulic control system
and umbilical control lines. A 4-in. pipeline
from shore to the field delivers monoethylene
glycol (MEG) for hydrate inhibition and
remediation in the wells and flow lines.
The onshore processing plant was designed
for a maximum capacity of up to 600 MMcfd
of gas and 3,000 b/d of condensate. But since

Scarab/Saffron details
Burullus Gas Co., responsible for developing
the West Delta Deep Marine concession, has
completed the Scarab/Saffron project, Phase I
in the development of the area.
In water depths ranging from 250 m to
850 m (820-2789 ft), the two main structures
in the area—Scarab and Saffron—hold
natural gas that contains a very small volume
of condensate, and a negligible amount of
carbon dioxide (CO2). Reservoir pressure in
the zones is about 3,500 psia and reservoir
temperature is about 150 °F (66 °C).
In mid 2003, eight wells were capable of
producing up to 150 MMcfd of dry gas
from the project for Egypt’s domestic
market. Those eight subsea wells in the
initial development are tied back to two
manifolds. The manifolds are connected to
shore via two export pipelines that
terminate at new onshore facilities adjacent
to the Rosetta onshore processing plant in
Idku, east of Alexandria.

startup in early 2003, debottlenecking has
boosted deliverability to 800 MMcfd.
The plant separates the well stream into
gas, condensate and water. Following treatment,
the gas is exported via a new pipeline and
metered at the tie-in to the Egyptian National

Transmission System. Condensate is stabilized
and stored on site prior to export through the
existing Rosetta condensate pipeline to the
Wepco Gas Treatment and LPG facilities at
Abu Qir, east of Alexandria.
Produced water is cleaned to recover the
MEG for re-use and to extract a salt sludge
prior to discharge to the sea. The salt sludge
is disposed in a landfill.

Phases II and III
Simian, Sienna and Sapphire fields, in water
depths of 900-1,100 m (2,953-3,609 ft),
comprise Phases II and III of the WDDM
concession development. Simian/Sienna and
Sapphire were commissioned in 2005.
The three fields are produced via a
subsea tie-back to the existing Scarab/Saffron
export pipeline. Offshore elements of the
project included the design, installation and
commissioning of flow lines, manifolds,
pipelines, subsea distribution assembly,
umbilicals, a control system and the control
platform.
Also during the expansion, the existing
Scarab/Saffron terminal was expanded to
provide a separate gas feed to the liquefaction
plant at Damietta. Modifications included a
new slug catcher, high pressure separation,
condensate treatment, vent lines, and the
pipeline to the LNG plant’s Train 2.
In Sapphire, a field in 400-550 m (1,3121,804 ft) of water, eight new development
wells will be drilled and completed using
multi-zone smart completion technology.
The producing zone, the pre-Pliocene Kafer
El-Sheikh, consists of five stacked reservoirs
of very loose sand with a shale cap rock.
Reservoir pressure is about 4,500 psia
and reservoir temperature is 180 °F (82 °C).
In mid 2007, eight wells were producing up
to 120 MMcfd/well of wet gas containing
about 25 bbl of condensate/MMcf.
Two exploration/appraisal wells in both
Simian and Sienna were re-entered and

completed, and two new development wells
drilled and completed in Simian. Reservoir
pressure in the two fields is about 3,600 psia
and reservoir temperature is 130 °F (54 °C).
The producing formation is the Pliocene ElWestani, a channel sand with some interbedded shale and a shale cap rock.
Several advanced technologies and design
innovations played a key role in completing
the Simian wells, including:
• Wells are completed with an open-hole
gravel pack to maximize production, although
there is very active shale between the reservoir
sands;
• A smart completion technology with
down-hole control valves makes it possible to
produce the five stacked reservoir sands
through the same well bore without the zones
interfering with each other;
• All the wells are completed with 7-in.
tubing and permanent down-hole gauges to
monitor reservoir pressure, temperature and
flow rate;

• The wells are designed to avoid the
high cost of subsea intervention;
• A regeneration unit saves the high cost of
replacing the MEG and is more environmentally
friendly.
A small Burullus project management
team executed the work in cooperation with
other Rashpetco departments. Major contracts
included a tendered lump sum deepwater
Engineering Procurement Installation and
Commissioning (EPIC) contract for the total
offshore facilities, and a negotiated lump sum
Engineering Procurement and Construction
(EPC) contract for the onshore terminal
expansion. A lump sum EPC contract was
also negotiated for the condensate export
pipeline.

WDDM Phase IV
The West Delta Deep Marine Phase IV comprises
eight additional wells in the existing Scarab/
Saffron and Simian developments. Five of
these wells are in the Scarab/Saffron area, two

wells develop the Serpent field and one well
develops the Sinbad field. The Scarab/Saffron
and Serpent wells tie into the Scarab/Saffron
manifolds and the Sinbad well ties into the
southern Simian manifold.
This phase is essentially an infill of the
existing Scarab/Saffron and Simian deepwater
gas and condensate subsea production
complex. Existing offshore pipelines move the
product from the subsea system to the onshore
gas plant at Idku.
Burullus is responsible for all drilling
operations, the completion of the offshore
wells and the management of the drilling
contracts. A key to achieving the fast-track
development schedule is to order longdelivery-time items such as subsea trees,
connectors and control systems well in
advance.
Key drivers for implementing WDDM
Phase IV include:
• Meet the aggressive first gas date
requirements;
• Fulfill the safety and environmental
objectives;
• Provide infill gas capacity to enhance
security of supply for the Idku hub;
• Optimize economics, in particular by
incorporating the experience of Scarab/
Saffron and the Simian/Sienna and Sapphire
developments;
• Leverage opportunities for synergy
between Phase IV and the Scarab/Saffron
development and the Simian/Sienna and
Sapphire development, optimizing the
overall controls configuration.

Rosetta details
In Rashpetco’s Rosetta concession, the Phase I
area is located about 65 km (40 miles) from
the Nile Delta shoreline in the Eastern
Mediterranean. One main structure contains
relatively dry gas with a very small amount of
condensate, no hydrogen sulfide, and little
carbon dioxide. The reservoir pressure is
about 2,000 psia and reservoir temperature is
about 150 °F (66 °C). The initial phase includes
six producing wells drilled and completed
from an unmanned platform.
Rosetta Phase II includes four development
wells on another small unmanned offshore
platform producing about 230 MMcfd for the
domestic market. The wells were completed
with a 7-in. tubing string using “smart well”
completion technology.
Rosetta Phase III consists of five development
wells and all the wells in this phase will be
subsea completions tied to the existing Rosetta
facilities. Three will be completed using a
jack up drilling rig; the other two wells are
in significantly deeper water and will be
completed using a semisubmersible rig.

Egypt’s Natural Gas Operations
and Plans:
New discoveries, more liquids recovery
both serve natural gas strategy

T

he world’s energy future—at least a big
part of it—belongs to natural gas.
Globally, the resource is very large, and
countries and consumers increasingly choose
clean burning natural gas when possible.
Egypt is fortunate to have two key benefits
as this future unfolds: A significant gas resource
and a well-defined strategy to optimize the
value of that resource, both at home and via
exports. That strategy includes finding and
producing more, and processing to recover
liquids with high value as fuel and
petrochemical feedstock.
Successes achieved by the Egyptian Natural
Gas Holding Company (EGAS) in recent years
attest to the wisdom of an expansion strategy
for natural gas adopted by the Ministry of
Petroleum, said Minister of Petroleum Eng.
Sameh Fahmy recently.
During the General Assembly meeting of
EGAS in September, the Minister called the
expansion of the natural gas sector a corner
stone in Egypt’s energy strategy.
Total natural gas reserve by end of fiscal year
2006-2007 stood at 72.3 tcf. And new finds
continue to add to that reserve. For example, in
mid 2007, Dana Gas (PSJC) announced a new
gas and condensate discovery in its Dabayaa-1
exploration well in the West Manzala
exploration concession. The well penetrated a
gas-bearing interval in the Lower Abu Madi
sandstone where an extensive drill stem test
produced at a rate of 16.5 MMcfd and 330 b/d
of condensate through a 32/64-in. choke.
Centurion Petroleum Corp., the upstream
division of Dana Gas, drilled the well to a total
depth of 3,001 m (9,846 ft) and encountered a
hydrocarbon-bearing interval that extends
over a 10 sq km (3.9 sq mile) area, according to
the company.
“We are very excited about this gas
discovery which confirms our high expectations
for the hydrocarbon potential of the Abu Madi
Formation in our concession,” said Mr. Rashid
Saif Al-Jarwan, General Manager of Dana Gas.

Focus on processing
A variety of companies explore for and develop
Egypt’s natural gas reserves, and Egyptian
Natural Gas Co. (Gasco) is responsible for
gathering, processing and transporting natural
gas and gas products to a wide range of
consumers.
Gasco received natural gas from production
companies during 2005 totaling 38.1 billion
cu m (bcm) of gas, distributed 31.6 bcm for
local consumption, and exported 6.5 bcm.

New natural gas discoveries have been
made in the Western Desert area. And demand
for propane and ethane/propane mix to supply
feedstock for expansions and future projects in
the ethylene and polyethylene industry is
expected to grow rapidly. With the prospect of
both new supply and increased demand for
high-value natural gas products, Gasco began
in 2006 to implement a project to maximize
production of ethane/propane mix in the
Western Desert Gas Complex and the Amereya
LPG recovery plant.
Mechanical works are expected to be
complete by late 2008, with commissioning
and start up scheduled for February 2009.
Estimated total cost of the project is about
US$218 million.

UGDC: A world class plant

UGDC plant, Port Said.

Gas treatment station at Rashid Area.

Established in October 2001, United Gas
Derivatives Co. (UGDC) is a response to the
increasing international demand for natural
gas. It is a result of the policy and economic
model implemented by the Ministry of Petroleum
for attracting foreign investments to increase
production and exports. The program also will
return foreign currency, helping to fund
projects without burdening Egypt’s economy.
UGDC receives the gas produced from
North Port Said, Temsah and Ras El-Bar
concessions through the gas treatment plants
of El-Gamil and Ha’py, and produces propane,
LPG and condensate.
Company owners are Gasco, BP Global
Investments Ltd. (BP) and ENI International
B.V. (ENI), each with a one-third share.
“The relationship between the shareholders
is very healthy,” said Ibrahim Ahmed, UGDC
Chairman and Managing Director. “All are
working towards the success of the company
as most of the gas fed to the plants comes from
the shareholders’ concessions.”
The goal is to meet the needs of these
multinationals investors while still achieving
UGDC’s corporate objectives.

Egypt’s Natural Gas Operations and Plans

A big part of world’s energy future belongs to natural gas. View of LNG plant in Mubarak Complex for Natural Gas and Petrochemicals, Damietta .

“I do not see a conflict of interest between
the multinational investors and our own
corporate objectives,” said Mr. Ahmed. “The
company works on behalf of all the
shareholders to maximize revenue through
safe and reliable operations.”
And safety is top priority. Since its inception
in 2005, the company as accumulated 2.5
million man hours without accidents while
handling about 1.1 bcfd of natural gas. “This is
a world class NGL plant,” said Mr. Ahmed.
To achieve such a safety record requires
keeping track of all activities, major and minor,
said Mr. Ahmed, with well established and
monitored procedures. For example, a tracking
system monitors every car 24 hour/day to
ensure compliance with speed limits.
Within the plant, there are different levels of
approval both for cold and hot work. Every
procedure is closely scrutinized and monitored
by staff from the foremen to the plant manager.

Exports important
One of UGDC’s objectives is to produce
propane for export at the international market
price, as well as satisfying the national demand
for LPG and condensate, which is used in
gasoline production. Domestic sales are at a
price agreed with the government, which is
lower than the international price.
Over the next 20 years, as gas replaces oil as
the world’s largest energy source, Egypt’s
strategic location gives UGDC an advantage as
a global supplier.
“Egypt enjoys close proximity to large
European and Mediterranean markets,” said
Mr. Ahmed. “Our product can be moved easily

to countries such as Italy, Spain, the UK and to
the eastern Mediterranean because we are able
minimize the shipping cost and get a good price.”
Maximizing liquids production must be
done without jeopardizing the heating value of
the natural gas supplied to consumers,
according to Mr. Ahmed. UGDC works within
the constraints dictated by EGAS or EGPC.
“We extract (liquids) up to the limit dictated by
the national grade specifications and are well
within them.”
The company uses the latest technology
and designs for maximum processing
flexibility. For example, the plant is designed to
be able to recover ethane in the future, if
market conditions dictate. “If ethane recovery
materializes, it will generate additional revenue
for the shareholders,” said Mr. Ahmed.
UGDC’s production of 800 tons of LPG per
day helps offset imports, which are more than
1.5 million tons per year. Production of 1
million bbl/year of high quality condensate
helps reduce crude imports.
“UGDC is a good example of how Egypt
can attract foreign investment,” said Mr.
Ahmed. “We have a $400 million plant that
will expand. We want to maximize the value of
investment both for the government of Egypt
and for our foreign partners.”

Advanced process
UGDC uses natural gas liquids recovery
technology supplied by Ortloff Engineers Ltd.
Expansion turbines, a key feature of the
process, help recover over 99% of the propane
in the gas feed, a very high recovery rate
compared to other NGL plants.

According to UGDC, Ortloff’s technology
offers these significant advantages over
conventional technology:
• Greater tolerance to carbon dioxide in
the feed;
• Higher liquids recovery or higher
throughput capacity for the same amount of
compression horsepower;
• Lower propane loss while operating in
the ethane rejection mode;

“We want to maximize the value of
investment both for the government
of Egypt and for our foreign partners.”
Mr. Ibrahim Ahmed, UGDC Chairman and Managing
Director

• Operating flexibility that allows maximum
profit under all market conditions.
The carbon dioxide (CO2) tolerance of the
Ortloff process can frequently eliminate the
need for installing a treating unit to remove
CO2 from the feed gas, resulting in both capital
cost and operating cost savings.
A lower compression horsepower requirement
can boost the capacity of an existing plant by
retrofitting Ortloff technology without adding
compression equipment. If added capacity is not
needed, a simple process retrofit can significantly
improve the liquids recovery efficiency of an
existing plant without adding compression.
If ethane is to be recovered, the Ortloff
process can respond to changing ethane
markets. Ethane recovery is maximized when
it is profitable to sell ethane as a liquid; if ethane
is more valuable for its fuel value, ethane can be
rejected into the residue gas.

Egypt’s Natural Gas Operations
and Plans:
EGAS guides strategy, Gasco’s expanding
grid supplies gas, gas liquids

A

s the potential of Egypt’s gas resources
became well defined and the benefits
of clean burning fuel more important, the
Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Co. (EGAS)
was formed in 1991 by the Ministry of
Petroleum to assume the responsibilities of
the Egyptian General Petroleum Co. (EGPC)
related to natural gas. Now, EGAS supervises
and monitors companies involved in gas
transmission, distribution and marketing.
Egyptian Natural Gas Co. (Gasco) was born
in 1997 to manage, operate and maintain the
national gas grid and its facilities, a system that
has expanded at a healthy pace. A link between
producers and consumers, Gasco is present at
every point in the Egyptian gas chain, including
transmission, distribution, processing and
marketing.

EGAS projects
At mid 2007, EGAS had five projects
scheduled for completion in 2007 and 2008 to
boost production and reserves in producing
fields. Two projects were for the next phases in
the ongoing development of the Rosetta and
WDDM concessions; the other three fields
have total proved reserves of about 2,600 bcf.
With startup dates as far ahead as 2017,
development of new discoveries with total
reserves of about 3,630 bcf is also underway at
an estimated cost of almost US$2 billion.
Additional projects will be contracted to others.

and will produce 70 MMcfd.
Two new discoveries went on stream in
the Nile Delta in 2007: Merion-operated
West Dikirnis field in the Elmansoura
concession, with 137 bcf of gas and 15
million bbl of oil; and Centurion-operated
Luzi field in the West Elmanzala concession,
with reserves of 30 bcf.
Key projects due for completion will
develop total reserves of about 3,630 bcf at an
estimated cost of almost US$2 billion. Among
those projects are:
• North Sinai—Fayrouz field, with 42 bcf,

Production and consumption
Egypt’s proved natural gas reserves of 72.3 tcf
are up from 53 tcf in 2001, according to
EGAS. Consumption has climbed from 17.2
million ton/year in 2001 to 30 million tons in
fiscal year 2007. About 60% of the country’s
gas is used for power generation, 28% for
industry and 10% is recovered as gas liquids.
About 3% is used for domestic fuel and to
provide compressed natural gas (CNG) for
transportation fuel.
Gas exported through the Arab Gas
Pipeline totaled about 68 bcf during fiscal
2006, up from 8 bcf in 2003. In 2006, 67
cargos of LNG totaling 3.95 million tons were
shipped from Damietta LNG plant. From both
trains at the Idku plant, 131 cargos totaling
7.2 million tons were exported. Total LNG
exports in 2006 almost doubled from the
previous year.
In the Mediterranean, the West Delta Deep
Marine (WDDM) fields produce 100-120
MMcfd. Other Mediterranean fields produce a
total of 20-50 MMcfd. Nile Delta fields
contribute 5-20 MMcfd. And the Western
Desert fields produce 10-40 MMcfd.

In 2006, 67 cargos of LNG totaling 3.95 million tons were shipped from Damietta.

In the Rosetta concession, the third phase
will raise production by 150 MMcfd at a cost of
US$365 million; a fourth phase will boost gas
output by 300 MMcfd when it comes on stream
in early 2008 at a cost of US$864 million.
Two fields in the Ras El-Bar/Temsah
concession in the Mediterranean will also come
on stream in early 2008. Taurt, with reserves of
980 bcf is expected to produce 210 MMcfd
and Denis, with reserves of 1,193 bcf will
produce 250 MMcfd. Taurt will cost US$729
million; Denis will cost US$504 million.
In the Gulf of Suez concession, the Aml
field gas cap is estimated to contain 400 bcf

both operated by BG Group plc, will start up in
2017/2018.
Other projects include the 630-bcf North
Idco field, operated by RWE Dea AG, and
scheduled for startup in mid 2009. Several
fields will be developed in the North Alex/West
Mid Mediterranean concession operated by BP
plc, where reserves are estimated at 5,000 bcf.
Start up of first phase is set for 2009. And in the
East Deep Marine concession, Tennin field
reserves are estimated at 800 bcf. Operated by
IEOC, start up is scheduled for early 2010.

Building infrastructure
Gasco’s mission is to apply the latest
technologies to the construction, operation,
management and maintenance of the country’s
gas grid and gas processing operations. A core
responsibility is to encourage the use of natural
gas in industry to improve air quality.
The company’s expansion of the gas grid
and its projects to upgrade the grid to meet
international standards, will help increase the
use of natural gas in the domestic and
industrial markets.
Gasco also is supplying gas to a growing
petrochemical industry and encouraging the
use of natural gas in transportation by building
CNG pipelines and reduction stations. By the
end of fiscal year 2008, it expects to have 140
CNG filling stations in place, up from 46 in
2001. It expects to convert 12,800 cars to CNG
in the current fiscal year.
The company controls and monitors the
grid with the latest supervisory control and
data acquisition (SCADA) system through the
National Advanced Control Center (NATA). To
enhance its capability, Gasco will establish a
Piping Integrity Management Center in
cooperation with an international company
specializing in oil and gas pipelines inspection

and rehabilitation.
While meeting its operating and development
responsibilities, Gasco has two other top
priorities:
• Build a workforce capable of meeting the
challenges of the future;
• Achieve an accident free workplace and
healthy staff, and continue to fulfill its
responsibility to the environment.

Serving customers
Gasco has a broad range of customers with a
variety of requirements. What they all have in
common is the need for smooth, reliable,
cost-effective and uninterrupted gas and
product supply.
The largest user is power generation. Gasco
supplies gas to 27 power stations producing
80% of the thermal electric power in Egypt.
Other natural gas-fueled power stations are

planned over the next few years.
Fertilizer manufacturing and iron and steel
factories are also large gas users. Gasco supplies
gas to six industrial zones in Egypt where it
serves more than 250 factories and is considering
dozens of new applications for service.
To serve domestic customers, it supplies gas
to local distribution companies.
Gasco’s Western Desert Gas Complex, treats
up to 550 MMcfd to extract 400 million
tons/year of ethane/propane mixture to be used
in the petrochemical industry; 220 million
tons/year of commercial propane for export;
about 280 million tons/year of LPG for local
consumption; and 360 million bbl/year that is
used by refineries.
At the Amerya plant, 330 MMcfd of feed
gas is processed to produce 160 million
tons/year of LPG for local market consumption
and 260 million bbl/year of condensate for
refinery use.

Extending the Arab pipeline

Extending Arab gas pipeline.

The Minister visits new petroleum projects.

Under an agreement with East Gas Co., Gasco
undertook the operation and maintenance of the
Arab gas pipeline extending from Arish to Aqaba.
Driven by a vision of the opportunities that
would result from moving Egyptian gas further
into the Middle East and beyond, the EGAS-led
consortium was awarded the second phase of
the Arab gas pipeline from Aqaba to the city of
Rehab in Jordan. That extension, reaching to 24
km (15 miles) from the Jordanian/Syrian border,
is a total length of 390 km (242 miles) of 36 in.
The pipeline was put in operation in early
2006 and two weeks later, began to fuel both
the Rehab and Samra power stations. Along
the pipeline route covering Aqaba port and
the cities of Rashiedia, Safy, Samara and
Rehab, gas will be supplied to power stations,
the domestic sector and CNG stations.

Egypt’s Natural Gas Operations
and Plans:
PICO moves beyond Egypt and ‘leftover’
fields; new lines expand the grid

N

atural gas discoveries like those in
the Obaiyed and Khalda concessions
will be important to the growth of Egypt’s
energy sector and the country’s economy.
There will be plenty of demand for Egypt’s
growing gas supply, and many opportunities
for investment, said Eng. Salah Diab,
Chairman, PICO Corp.
“We have enough proven gas resources to
support growth for the next 30 years or so.
Based on forecasts, there will be no need to
begin importing gas,” he said.
Mr. Diab also would like to see Egypt
becoming a regional hub for gas processing
and liquefaction. “We have a large population
to supply, but if there is gas to spare, it makes
sense to encourage people to come to Egypt
and invest.”
Though Egypt’s political stability has
historically drawn foreign investors, increasing
tensions in the region threaten to erode the
confidence of those considering investment in
the wider Middle East.
“But Egypt has long been very stable and
we see no evidence that this will change,” said
Mr. Diab.

to become one,” said Mr. Diab. “We have the
equipment, technology and staff to achieve
that goal.”
Pico also plans to put forward an initial
private offering (IPO) as soon as possible.
With an increasingly intense focus on
offshore and deep water development, the
company’s history of increasing production
levels in the fields it operates will serve the
company well.

Pico strategy
In 1978, PICO Petroleum Services (PPS)
became the first private Egyptian enterprise to
offer oilfield services for the local oil and gas
market. In 1991, PICO Oil was established as
the first Egyptian company to own and operate
oil fields. A decade later, PICO launched its
newest unit, PICO Research and Analysis
(R&A). PICO Energy was established in 2002
as a holding company for the existing
subsidiaries and to explore the promise of
alternative energy sources.
Because Pico is well funded, it is actively
seeking investment opportunities in North
Africa, the Caspian and other areas in the
Middle East.
“We would like to be a regional player and
I think we have all the qualifications needed

Midor Refinery.

PICO began life by “picking up the
leftovers” of major international operators as
they moved on to frontier areas, said Mr. Diab.
“Those leftovers kept us busy trying to produce
whatever we could, and I think we have had
significant success.”
Rather than take properties from EGPC,
PICO acquired concessions that did not fit in
the portfolios of international operators.
“Since those concessions were all we had,
we spared no effort to maximize their potential
and I think we have succeeded. What was left
behind as having little potential is now
producing more than 25,000 b/d.”
And in 2004, a technical review confirmed
that substantial value remained in all of Pico’s
fields.
That success is due in a large part to PICO’s
ability to apply fit-for-purpose solutions to
the development of its assets. Low operating
cost is another advantage. “We don’t do any
unnecessary spending,” said Mr. Diab. “For
example, we might use an old drilling rig as a
water injection platform.”
Now, the company is moving to take
advantage of potential exploration opportunities
in Egypt and elsewhere. “We expect to move
into Iraq and Sudan as soon as conditions
warrant, and to Algeria,” he said.
As the first Egyptian petroleum services
contractor, PICO quickly became a capable
oil and gas service provider in Egypt. The
company’s joint-venture agreements, however,
did not permit it to operate outside Egypt.
“Now we are releasing ourselves from this
restriction, and I think we have accumulated
the know-how to take our services to other
countries,” said Mr. Diab.
He also sees other companies with
extensive technical expertise moving beyond
being subcontractors to become operators.
There is “a very thin line between the
integrated services provided by the large
international service companies and the way
the large operators develop an oil or gas field,”

Pipelines expand grid

South Valley

Enhancing the capacity of Egypt’s gas grid and
upgrading its infrastructure will accommodate
growing demand for natural gas and help serve
new domestic and export markets.
Progress in the execution of many Gasco
projects accelerated in 2006 as several pipeline
projects moved ahead.
The El-Tina/Abu Sultan pipeline, a 62-km
(37-mile), 32-in. line capable of moving 16
MMcfd of gas was built to support the eastern
flank of the national gas grid. Started up in
early 2007, it uses gas supplied by Port Fouad
and northern Port Said fields to meet the

Within the framework of the Ministry of
Petroleum’s plan to develop the south of the
valley, and Gasco’s plan to supply the South
Valley governorates, Gasco began the first
section of the South Valley pipeline in early
2006. The Beni-Suef/Abu Qorqas line is 150
km (93 miles) of 32 in. with a capacity of 16
MMcfd. It was completed in mid 2007 at a
cost of about L.E 545 million.
The second phase, from Menya to Assiut,
is 136 km (85 miles) of 32 in. Estimated to
cost about L.E 520 million, it is scheduled for
startup in second quarter 2008.

By the third quarter of 2007, after completing
the pipelines supplying gas to the cities of
Sharm El-Sheikh, Hurgada and Beni-Suef,
total length of the south valley grid reached
about 800 km. Grid transmission capacity
was 166 MMcfd.

El-Qasr tie in
Gas production from El-Qasr field in the
Khalda concession began in 1998 and by the
end of 2006 was averaging almost 500 MMcfd.
Oil production began in the concession in
the mid 1980s and now averages 80,000 b/d.
By the end of 2006, cumulative gas production
was 782 bcf. The field has also produced 47
million bbl of condensate and 284 million
bbl of oil.

Cooling and heating station, Gas Cool Co.

The project involves two phases: El-Qasr
Early (capacity up to 150 MMcfd of gas plus
associated liquids) and El-Qasr Permanent.
Capacity of the first phase, completed in 2005,
is expected to increase to 210 MMcfd after the
commissioning of a pre-compression project
in early 2008.
By tying the El-Qasr field into the Obaiyed
gas processing facilities, it was not necessary to
build a new gas processing plant in Khalda.

Egypt’s Downstream Operations and Opportunities

Egypt’s Downstream
Operations and Opportunities:
Three-phase plan will create a world-class
petrochemical industry

R

ising oil and gas prices have made
those basic commodities increasingly
valuable to countries with substantial proven
reserves and attractive exploration prospects.
Even more value is added when a portion of
those national resources can be used to
manufacture petrochemical “building blocks”
and finished products.
Not all countries are equipped to make the
investment needed to build a petrochemical
industry; Egypt is fortunate to have that
capability. In addition, it has a petrochemical
master plan that will increase the value of its
petroleum reserves, serve a growing domestic
market for petrochemical products, and
provide new export revenue.
The same advantages that have helped
build its oil and gas industry—strategic
location, economic and political stability, a
skilled workforce—will benefit Egypt’s
developing petrochemical industry.

Plan summary
The Egyptian Petrochemicals Master Plan
will be executed in three phases over 20 years
at a total estimated cost of US$10 billion.
Responsibility for implementing the
development plan will fall to the Egyptian
Petrochemicals Holding Co. (Echem),
established in 2002 to carry out the Master
Plan, and to encourage investment in the
petrochemical industry.
Though the overall objectives are clear, two
decades can see significant change in markets
and in feedstock supply, so the plan is designed
with the flexibility needed to accommodate
those changes.
It will be continuously updated to reflect
conditions in local and international markets
and to ensure that execution of the plan is
responding to real world situations. But as the
plan stood in mid 2007, it included 24
projects and 50 production units, and will
create almost 100,000 direct and indirect
employment opportunities.

The first phase is on track to be completed
in 2008. Phase II will continue through about
2015 and the final phase of the current plan
will be complete in 2022.

Product slate
Products to be produced by Phase I of the plan
include methanol, ammonia/urea, polystyrene,
propylene/polypropylene, linear alkyl benzene
and acrylic fiber. The first of three olefins
complexes—one to be built in each phase—is
also part of the initial phase.
Most Phase I projects were on schedule in
mid 2007. The acrylic fiber project at Alexandria
went on stream in February 2006 with a
capacity to produce up to 18,000 tons/year
using polymerization technology. Total cost of
the project was US$70 million. The plant is
owned by the Birla Group, (60%); Sidi Kerir
Petrochemicals Co. (Sidpec), 20%; Apicorp,
10% and Egyptian Saudi for Investment, 10%.
Other projects are under construction,
including methanol, ammonia/urea, polystyrene,

propylene/polypropylene, and linear alkyl
benzene units. The olefin complex and a
planned polyvinyl chloride expansion are still
under development.
Phase II of the plan calls for units to produce
terephthalic acid (TPA), polyester, ethoxylates,
styrene and latex; and includes another methanol
unit, the second olefins complex and an aromatics
complex. Three Phase II projects were under
development at mid 2007—a polyester unit, the
aromatics complex and the styrene unit.
Phase III plants will include a vinyl complex;
additional capacity for styrene and latex; and
expansion of the propylene/ polypropylene and
linear alkyl benzene capacity.

Project activity
In late 2007, the linear alkyl benzene plant
capable of producing up to 100,000 tons/year
was nearing completion near Alexandria.
Using the process supplied by UOP LLC, the
plant is scheduled for startup in early 2008 at a
total cost of about US$492 million.

The Petrochemicals Master Plan will increase the value of egyptian petroleum reserves.

Egypt’s Downstream Operations and Opportunities

Egypt intends to invest in new downstream projects, including an integrated oil refinery and petrochemical complex.

Major shareholders in the project are
National Investment Bank with 34%, and
Echem and EGAS, each with about 21%.
Other owners include EGPC, the Ministry of
Finance and UniChema Group.
The propylene/polypropylene plant now
under construction at Port Said will have a
capacity of 400,000 tons/year of polypropylene
when it comes on stream in the third quarter of
2009. The plant uses the Uhde GmbH process
for high density polypropylene and a process
from Basell AF for polypropylene.
Arab and private investors account for
the largest ownership share at 48%. Other
shareholders include Echem and Gasco, each
with a 13% share and Oriental Petrochemicals
Co./Oriental Weavers with a 26% share. Cost
of the plant is estimated at US$750 million.
A new US$950 million methanol plant at
Damietta will have a capacity to produce 1.3
million tons/year when it is completed in the
first quarter of 2010. Shareholders include
Methanex Corp., 60%; Echem, 12%; EGAS,
12%; Gasco, 9% and Apicorp, 7%.
Starting up at about the same time at
Damietta will be an ammonia/urea plant now
under construction with a capacity to produce
1.4 million tons/year of urea. Cost of the unit
is about US$1.4 billion. The Uhde ammonia
process is combined with a UOP carbon
dioxide removal process. Both urea synthesis
and urea granulation are done with a process
supplied by Stamicarbon BV. Ownership of
the project is shared by Agrium (60%), Echem
(24%) and private investors.
At mid 2007, basic engineering was under
way at Alexandria for a polystyrene plant that
will produce up to 200,000 tons/year after it
starts up in third quarter 2009. Feedstock for
the plant, styrene monomer, will be imported

during Phase I of the Master Plan but styrene
capacity built in Phases II and III will eliminate
the need for imports.
Shareholders in the US$150 million plant
include Echem, 35%; Ministry of Finance,
20%; National Investment Bank, 20%;
Petrojet, 15% and Enppi, 10%.
Construction of a polyester unit at Damietta
with a capacity of 315,000 tons/year of
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has been
approved by the joint venture shareholders.
Startup is scheduled for fourth quarter 2009.
Owners are South Asian Petrochemicals Ltd.
(SAPL), 70%; Echem, 23%; and Enppi, 7%.
Under study is an aromatic complex that
would be built at Suez or Alexandria to
produce 500,000 tons/year of gasoline and
500,000 tons/year of paraxylene. Total
investment would be about US$2 billion.
The ethane cracker under consideration for
Damietta would produce 300,000 tons/year
followed by ethylene processes. UGDC would
provide the ethane feedstock for the plant,
which is estimated to cost US$925 million. If
the project goes ahead, it would begin
operation in 2011.
At mid 2007, the feasibility study for the
ethane cracker in Alexandria was being prepared.
With a planned capacity of 400,000 tons/year, the
cracker would be followed by polyethylene,
styrene and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) production.

Refining/petrochemicals complex
In addition to the master petrochemical plan,
Egypt intends to invest in other new
downstream projects, including an integrated oil
refinery and petrochemical complex. Also on
the drawing board are dimethyl ether (DME)
capacity of 200,000 tons/year at Damietta and
bio-diesel manufacturing capability.

A feasibility study was in progress in mid
2007 for the refining and petrochemical
complex project that would be built in three
phases. The gas-to-propylene (GTP) plant
would come first, followed by the oil refinery,
then the petrochemicals units.
Adding value to Egypt’s natural gas resource
by using it to produce propylene is the aim of
the GTP plant. Design capacities are 470,000
tons/year of polypropylene, 185,000 tons/year
of gasoline and 40,000 tons/year of LPG.
Processes from Lurgi AG would convert gas to
methanol, then convert methanol to propylene.
A Basell process would convert propylene to
polypropylene.
Total cost of the GTP plant is estimated at
US$2.2 billion, with start up planned for 2010.
Phase two of the project under consideration
is a 400,000-b/d refinery designed to produce
3.5 million tons of gasoline, 5.1 million tons of
low sulfur diesel and 520 million tons of
kerosene and jet fuel. Total investment is
estimated to be US$8 billion and if sanctioned,
the project would start up in 2012-2013.
The petrochemicals phase is aimed at
producing basic and intermediate petrochemicals,
including polyethylene, polypropylene, butene
and its derivatives, butadiene and its derivatives,
benzene and paraxylene. Feedstock would
come from the units built in phase two.
Estimated cost is US$6 billion.
Design capacities of the complex include:
• 1.2 million tons/year polyethylene;
• 810,000 tons/year polypropylene;
• 130,000 tons/year butene and its
derivatives;
• 205,000 tons/year butadiene and its
derivatives;
• 730,000 tons/year benzene;
• 1.2 million tons/year paraxylene.

Egypt’s Downstream
Operations and Opportunities:
Sidpec growth strategy built on product
quality, export experience

T

urning crude oil and natural gas
components into basic and intermediate
petrochemicals adds significant value to
petroleum reserves. The country that produces
these products from its raw materials best serves
its economy and its citizens’ long term interests.
With significant natural petroleum resources
to serve as feedstock, growing domestic product
demand and expanding export market
opportunities, Egypt has a promising future
in petrochemical manufacturing.
Considered the first integral step towards
realizing this bright future was the formation of
Sidi Kerir Petrochemicals Co. (Sidpec) as an
Egyptian joint stock company in November
1997. Privatization of the company in 2005
through a successful initial public offering
positioned Sidpec for continued growth.
The company supplies all the domestic
demand for polyethylene raw material with a
polymer portfolio that includes linear low
density polyethylene (LLDPE) and high
density polyethylene (HDPE).
Throughout its operations, the company
applies the latest available technology and
state-of-the-art process design to meet Egyptian
environmental regulations and requirements.
As it marks its tenth anniversary this year,
Sidpec can count significant accomplishments,
as it contributed significantly to the economy of
Egypt. For example, this year Sidpec became the
first company to win the National Award for
Excellence in Exportation. Sidpec has exported
its products to more than 60 countries around
the world and has distributors in more than 25
of the world’s largest markets.
In the years ahead, the company hopes to
double its capacity, as well as produce new
products.
It all will be done with a focus on benefiting
the Egyptian economy, as well as the environment,
both in Egypt and wherever Sidpec’s products
are sold. The company’s products are well
known all over Europe because they are
environmentally friendly.

Expansion strategy
In many ways, natural gas will be a leading
driver of Egypt’s energy sector for the
foreseeable future. Two of the most important
contributions will be natural gas exports and
natural gas used as raw material for the
petrochemical industry.
Converting natural gas to methanol and
then to ethylene and propylene will provide

feedstock for petrochemical manufacturing.
Natural gas for export will continue to come
from new discoveries being made in the deep
water of the Mediterranean and elsewhere.
Sidpec’s strategy is to split these discoveries
into three categories. One will serve the local
domestic market, the second is for export and
the third will be for future generations. By
applying this strategy, it can be good steward
of this very valuable natural gas resource.
As commodity prices and environmental
concerns increase, LNG is enjoying renewed
interest around the world. And Egypt is
prepared to participate in this growing market
with liquefaction facilities.
Besides natural resources, Egypt offers
another key to growth: Political and financial
stability and a long history of attracting
foreign investors.
Though tensions in the wider region of the
Middle East continue to concern international
companies, Egypt still offers stability, and
systems and programs that are sustainable.
Adding value to Egypt’s locally available
feedstock represents an important potential
revenue stream and employment platform.
And Sidpec’s success is important in developing
Egypt’s petrochemical industry.
As the first company to produce ethylene
to provide raw material for polyethylene and
many other products. The first step had been
taken towards Egypt’s petrochemical future.
Attention to safety and the environment,
and the continuous development of staff
expertise, are critical elements of Sidpec’s longterm strategy.
Sidpec’s plants are running according to
plan, without mishap and with attention to
the environment. And one of the most
important assets is the relatively young, but
knowledgeable staff.
About 90% of the company’s employees
are below the age of 40. In providing the
support and training they need, many are sent
abroad to gain new and broader experience.

Egypt’s Downstream Operations and Opportunities

Sidpec ethylene and polyethylene plant. The company supplies all the domestic demand for polyethylene raw material.

Customers and shareholders
Following the spirit of its vision “to be a leader
in providing innovative, value added and
highest quality petrochemical products
worldwide while creating superior shareholder
value” has made Sidpec quality internationally
respected.
The company’s products couldn’t be
distributed to more than 62 countries if those
products were not of good quality. Customer
satisfaction has been the main goal. And with
continuity, products will be improved.
One measure of Sidpec quality is that its
polyethylene grades (high and linear low
density) fully meet the requirements of EC
Directive 2002/72/EC and UK statutory
instrument 1376 (1998), as amended, for use
with all classes of foodstuff. Sidpec’s Egyptene
polymer is used to produce film for shopping
and grocery bags, heavy duty film and
agricultural film.
Sidpec also produces blow-molded
containers; injection-molded pallets, boxes,
pails, toys and house wares; and roto-molded
tanks and other items.

New capacity and markets
Sidpec shareholders have indicated their
satisfaction with the company’s performance
by encouraging it to expand its capacity and
initiate new projects. They accept the studies
that the company present to them and are
willing to finance expansion.

A new polyethylene project was announced
by Sidpec in mid 2006 to produce plastic
pipe that will be part of the effort to make
natural gas available to all homes in Egypt.
One of Sidpec’s objectives is to leverage
the image of quality that has made its products
available in scores of countries around the world
to further penetrate the international markets.
First and foremost, the aim is to maintain a
good relationship with the customers all over
the world. In addition, Sidpec would like to
penetrate new markets such as Africa and
Latin America. The company already has
support in America.
To maintain its relationships, the company
takes the feedback it gets from customers and
foreign distributors about packaging and
other issues very seriously.

HSE and training
Sidpec’s focus on safety, on the health of its
workers and of citizens both at home and
abroad—and on reducing the company’s
environmental footprint—is guided by a
carefully thought out, detailed program.
The effort has paid off in many ways,
including a significant reduction in accident
rate. The company had no lost time incidents
in 2003 and 2004; only one in 2005.
Sidpec’s industry is a clean industry,
following all the standards—both international
and Egyptian—related to air, and liquid and
solid waste. And trying to reverse any negative

impact that has occurred.
In November 2003, Sidpec became the first
petrochemical company in Egypt to be
certified as meeting the requirements of both
the ISO14001 and OHSAS 18001 standards.
All employees have access to policies and
procedures of a hazard commutation program,
respiratory protection, hearing protection,
safe work practices, emergency action plans
and work permits.
Sidpec’s training and development
department is committed to the development
of each employee. And management has
placed a strong emphasis on implementation
of new managerial systems. These initiatives
include several important programs.
A training center established in 2001 helps
the company carry out these and other
activities:
• New employee training;
• Training and seminars in ISO,
management, safety and occupational health
for related companies;
• Joint meetings with related companies
on environment protection and anti-pollution
initiatives;
• Training courses prepared by the company’s
professional instructors, and by international
companies for specific training needs.
The training department also organizes
summer training for Egyptian university
students in science, engineering, commerce
and other disciplines.

Egypt’s Downstream
Operations and Opportunities:
A capital-friendly environment will fuel
downstream growth

G

rowing demand for fuel, petrochemical
feedstock and petrochemical products
—both at home and in global markets—
combined with Egypt’s petrochemical master plan
offers attractive investment opportunities that
will also speed the country’s downstream growth.
Evidence of international interest in these
opportunities comes from a number of recent
agreements between Egypt and international
companies.
World refining capacity is stretched thin
and growing economies will demand more

petroleum-derived products, from gasoline
to grocery bags. Many of the same advantages
that draw exploration and development
companies to Egypt also help attract investors
to these emerging downstream opportunities:
• Freedom to choose the field of investment;
• No restrictions on the nationality of the
capital;
• Owners can determine the amount of
capital based on project size capacity, and
there is no limit;
• Choice of legal form for the project;

• Ability to transfer and re-export profits
and invested capital;
• Freedom to turn operations over to others;
• Ability to determine product prices and
margins;
• Residence licenses and facilities for
foreign investors upon request.

A sampling of investment plans
A number of recent announcements confirm
the interest of international companies in
developing petrochemical projects in Egypt.

NEXT DEVELOPMENT PHASE UNDER WAY AT SOKHNA POR T

The strategic location of Sokhna Port south of the Suez Canal on
the Red Sea makes it the ideal port of call for maritime trade into
and out of Egypt. As a joint venture between government and
private investors, Sokhna Port is a pioneering model for publicprivate partnerships in Egypt. The Sokhna Port Development Co.,
part of Egypt-based Amiral Holdings Ltd., holds the concession for
developing and managing the port for 25 years.
The next phase of development officially began in February
2007 when Prime Minister H.E. Dr. Ahmed Nazif laid the
foundation stones for a new basin estimated to cost US$36 million.
Covering an area of 150,000 sq m (1.615 million sq ft), it will
have a 420-m (1,378-ft) long jetty with a water depth alongside of
17 m (56 ft). Also included will be a liquid bulk terminal for product
storage and handling, and to provide bunkering service.
The first phase of a livestock project at the port, which began

operation at the end of 2006, includes a terminal and holding pens
for up to 24,000 head of livestock. A slaughterhouse and meat
processing plant will comprise phase two of the project. When
complete, the US$90 million project can process between 250,000
to 350,000 head of livestock annually, primarily for the domestic
market.
A sugar refinery at the port was scheduled to start production in
late 2007. A joint venture between the Saudi-based Savola and
British sugar pioneers Tate and Lyle, the US$120 million refinery
will produce 1 million tons/year and include storage facilities.
Additional development includes a magnesium refinery, an
ammonia project and a methanol plant.
“We are continuing to extend our efforts to attract more foreign
investment and large scale projects to the port,” said Capt. Ossama
Al Sharif, President and CEO, Sokhna Port Development Co.

Fahmy visits the Petroleum’s aircraft fleet.

Investments (Apicorp) owns the remaining 7%.
The project aims at meeting the local demand
for urea used as a fertilizer and exporting the
surplus. It is expected to begin commercial
production in the first quarter of 2010.
Financing for the project will include
US$380 million from local banks, including
National Bank of Egypt, Banque Misr,
Commercial International Bank CIB, Al Ahly
Societe Generale Bank and the Arab Bank.
Remainder of the investment will be financed
by international banks. The loan period is 15
years; it will be repaid from the cash flows
generated by the project.

New petrochemicals and refining projects
also involve Kuwaiti, Bahraini and Egyptian
investments in Suez. Two new refining and
petrochemical projects there that are expected
to require an investment of about US$3 billion
are underway.
The first project, costing about US$1.8
billion, will initially produce 100,000 b/d of
petroleum products; then a second phase will
boost capacity to 150,000 b/d. Another project
will produce 130,000 b/d of petroleum and
petrochemical products after an investment of
$1.2 billion.

Facilitating new projects
Eng. Fahmy, also met recently with a delegation
of group leaders from the U.S. contractor Kellogg
Brown and Root (KBR) to discuss ways KBR
might increase its investment and activity in
Egypt in light of the accelerated development
of the country’s oil, gas and petrochemicals
industry.
KBR cooperated with Enppi and Petrojet
and served as general contractor in executing
the gas liquefaction and export complex in
Damietta. KBR companies are interested in
expanding their presence in Egypt to execute
development projects including petrochemicals.

Egypt’s Downstream Operations and Opportunities

According to the website oilegypt.com, a
delegation from India’s Reliance Group recently
met with Egyptian Minister of Petroleum, Eng.
Sameh Fahmy, to discuss possible new projects
in refining and petrochemicals, as well as in oil
and gas exploration and marketing.
According to the report, the Reliance Group
is considering the investment of as much as
US$10 billion in various petroleum operations,
especially in petrochemicals. The Group is
interested in establishing an integrated
complex for manufacturing plastics for use in
industrial, agricultural, food and infrastructure
products. Capacity of the complex is expected
to be about 1.3 million tons/year. Investment is
estimated at US$1.5 billion. The project would
serve domestic demand, as well as provide
exports to Europe, Africa and Arab regions.
In mid 2007, Eng. Fahmy witnessed the
signing of a financing agreement for the main
loan of about US$950 million for the Egyptian
Agrium Co. for Nitrogenous Products project
to produce ammonia/urea. Capacity of the
facility would be about 1.3 million tons with
an investment of about US$1.5 billion.
Contribution of the Egyptian petroleum sector
to the project is 33%, the Canadian Agrium Co.
has 60%, and the Arab Company for Petroleum

EGYPT’S GAS AND BIOFUELS PLANS FIT WELL WITH “GREEN REVOLUTION”

The effort to reduce the impact of energy consumption on air and
water quality has accelerated in recent years as more companies,
countries and consumers take measures to “go green.”

200,000 tons/year of synthetic diesel. Estimated cost of the biodiesel
plant is US$600 million; the synthetic diesel project would cost an
estimated US$500 million.

The solution is not to abandon hydrocarbons, but to use lighter
hydrocarbons where possible and complement them with nonhydrocarbon energy sources. Egypt’s innovative strategy to use
compressed natural gas (CNG) for transportation, for example,
addresses a large source of emissions.

A wide range of experiments, technologies, plans and projects make
up the world of biofuels:

Recently, Oil & Gas Journal cited an Accenture report that concluded
“diversity of transportation fuels will be a fundamental change…in the
coming decade.” The International Energy Agency forecasts a four-fold
growth in ethanol and biodiesel production by 2020. It estimated 2006
global production of crop based ethanol at 13.5 billion gal, but the
biodiesel market at only 1 billion gal in 2005.
Egypt has taken the initial step towards developing its biofuel
industry. In mid 2007, a biodiesel production project was under study
that would produce 1 million tons/year of biodiesel, along with

• India plans to replace 10% of its transport fuels with biofuels by
2017, according to the web site Biofuels International;
• Biofuels International also reported that U.S.-based Blue Sun
Biodiesel has proposed a $42 million four-year jatropha biodiesel project
to the US Department of Energy;
• In Japan, Toyo Engineering completed a feasibility study for an
integrated coco methyl-ester (CME) biodiesel plant in the Philippines’ to
produce a CME blend of 5%;
• German-based Petrotec’s multi-feedstock technology to treat
yellow grease and animal fats as well as virgin vegetable oils produced
85,000 tons of biodiesel in 2006.

Egypt and Tomorrow’s Energy Markets

Egypt and Tomorrow’s
Energy Markets:
Comprehensive strategy equips Egypt
for a competitive energy world

I

f there is a single word that defines every
facet of tomorrow’s energy markets, it is
competition—for resources, for opportunities,
for customers, for qualified employees and
for capital.
Beginning with significant petroleum
resources of its own, Egypt’s government and
private companies have developed the
strategies and capabilities to grow and prosper
in this competitive environment.
A capital-friendly investment tradition
has opened opportunities to Egyptian and
international companies, both upstream and
downstream. A trading culture and high quality
products have helped penetrate a wide range of
export markets. And Egyptian companies and
agencies have well-defined programs to develop
the workforce and meet health, safety and
environmental responsibilities.
All these advantages will be critically
important as world market trends unfold.

A global context
According to the U.S. Energy Information
Administration (EIA) International Energy
Outlook 2007, world marketed energy
consumption will grow by 57% between 2004
and 2030. And this growth will occur even
with continued high oil and gas prices.
Liquids will supply the largest share of
world energy consumption over the period,
but their share falls from 38% in 2004 to 34%
in 2030, largely because oil prices remain high,
according to EIA. World liquids consumption
in the report’s reference case increases from 83
million b/d in 2004 to 118 million b/d in 2030.
Two-thirds of the growth will be in the
transportation sector.
Rising world oil prices after 2015 will
increase gas demand, said the agency. And
world natural gas consumption will grow by
1.9%/year from about 100 tcf in 2004 to 129
tcf in 2015 and 163 tcf in 2030. In both total
energy and natural gas, the fastest growth is in
non-OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-

Global Energy Roundtable Conference in Cairo, November 30, 2006.

operation and Development) countries, where
natural gas consumption increases more than
twice as fast as in the OECD countries.
The good news is that global petroleum
resources are very large. As of January 1, 2007,
proved conventional world oil reserves were
1,317 billion bbl, according to Oil & Gas
Journal—24 billion bbl higher than in 2006.
Heavy oil resources around the world are
several times as much.
Proved world natural gas reserves are 6,183
tcf—71 tcf higher than in 2006, according to
the Journal report.
And then there are undiscovered reserves.
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) estimates
global undiscovered natural gas reserves at
4,136 tcf. Of that total, an estimated 3,000 tcf
is “stranded” reserves.
Oil and gas prices are expected to remain
high, but costs will continue to increase, too.
Meeting that challenge will require new
technology, more efficient work processes and
innovative partnership arrangements.

On the right track
There are two important ways a country can
ensure a successful energy future: diversify
supply, both geographically and by source; and
optimize the value of natural resources. With a
strategy that includes energy sources and

markets from crude oil, to petrochemicals, to
biodiesel, Egypt has a clear focus on these goals.
Egypt has properly made the development
of natural gas and the exploitation of its
deepwater Mediterranean discoveries and
prospects top priorities. World gas markets will
be strong for the foreseeable future, and
technology and price will continue to lower the
economic threshold for deepwater development.
The petrochemical master plan is also a
critical element in optimizing the value of
Egypt’s oil and gas resource. With Egyptian
companies playing an important role in the
industry, the country can guide the direction of
its future and benefit from its success.
Beyond the traditional responses to energy
needs, Egypt is “ahead of the curve” in several areas,
including the development of compressed natural
gas and biofuels for the transportation sector.
In all industry segments, Egypt’s own
companies are increasing capability and
expertise to compete. And whether oil, gas, or
petrochemicals, Egypt’s strategic location will
continue to be an advantage.
Whatever the details of a strategy, the
foundation is capital. Egypt’s petroleum
development strategy recognizes the importance
of an investment environment that will
attract companies that can help it achieve its
energy goals.

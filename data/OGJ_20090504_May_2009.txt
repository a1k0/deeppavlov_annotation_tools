COVER
In March, Heerema DCV Thialf installed the topsides and living
quarters for the Shell-operated Perdido project in the US Gulf
of Mexico. Shell operates Perdido on behalf of partners BP and
Chevron. Peridido is the deepest spar yet installed (7,817 ft seawater) and includes the deepest producing subsea well (9,627 ft),
pumping 130,000 boe/d.This issue’s special report on Offshore
Petroleum Operations, beginning on p. 58, looks at Vietnam’s Su Tu
Vang project as an example of overcoming current difficult economics in completing a new development, presents the first part of a
study on using real-time data and models to optimize production
off Trinidad and Tobago, and details a new offshore one-call system
for the US Gulf of Mexico. Photo by Jan Berghuis Terschelling,

In January, Petrobras installed the P-51 semisubmersible production unit (see photo above) in Marlim Sul field off Brazil.The unit, the first built entirely in Brazil, is
moored in 1,255 m of water and can process up to 180,000 bo/d. Photo from Petrobras.

Ex-Im Bank approves $900 million in loans to Pemex
The US Export-Import Bank has approved $900 million worth
of 10-year direct loans to Mexico’s state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos to support purchase of US goods.
The official US government export credit agency said the loans
consisted of $600 million for purchases to be used in the new
projects of PEP, formerly known as the New Pidiregas Projects,
which are 18 onshore and offshore oil and gas exploration sites,
and $300 million for the Canterelli oil fields. Both activities involve
work in and around the Bay of Campeche off the northern Yucutan
coast, it noted.
Ex-Im Bank said its financing will help assure that US products
would be competitive, adding that exports of engineering services, oil field equipment, offshore platforms, drilling and upgrade
services, and upgrade and rehabilitation services are expected to
come from suppliers in Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and other states.
Pemex is its largest borrower, the bank noted. Since 1998, it
has approved $8.3 billion of financing for the company to buy US
goods and services for its oil and gas exploration, development,
and processing projects. This included a $150 million small business facility in August supporting Pemex’s purchases of equipment
and services from US companies with 100 or fewer employees, the
export credit agency said.
It noted that it authorized $1.5 billion of loans to support foreign purchases of US goods and services for oil and gas projects in
fiscal 2008. During that year, the bank authorized a total of $14.4
billion in loans to support the purchase of $19.6 billion of US
exports worldwide, it said.

EU parliament approves energy compromise
The European Union’s Parliament approved by a large majority
the energy market liberalization compromise reached in October
2008 by the Energy Council.
Parliament earlier rejected the compromise in its first reading
and insisted that integrated companies fully unbundle production
and sale of natural gas and electricity, while the council battled for

Exploration

&

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

the choice among three options for separating supply and production activities from network operators.
Brokered by the current Czech presidency of the EU, full acceptance by the Council of Ministers and parliament was reached
on the third legislative package on energy aimed at bolstering the
internal gas and electricity markets. But the parliamentary vote has
strengthened the role of both national and transmission system
regulators and put citizens at the center of the market through a
protective energy consumer checklist and special attention to vulnerable clients.
Both European Commission Pres. Jose Manuel Barroso and Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs welcomed the vote, which
they said ensures more effective regulatory oversight “from truly
independent and competent national energy regulators” and “facilitates crossborder collaboration and investment with a new European Network for Transmission System Operators.”
They said grid operators will cooperate and develop common
commercial and technical codes and security standards, as well
as plan and coordinate the investments needed for the EU, easing
crossborder trade and creating a level playing field.
“By bringing national markets together, member states will be
better able to assist one another to face energy supply threats,” they
added. The main objective of the energy package is to put in place
the regulatory framework to make the market fully effective and
create a single EU gas and electricity market to achieve the lowest
possible energy prices and better security.
The legislative package includes provisions to prevent control of
transmission systems by companies from non-EU countries until
they fulfill certain conditions. A national regulator could refuse certification of a transmission system operator controlled by “a person
or persons from a third country” if the company does not comply
with the unbundling requirements, and its market entry would
jeopardize supply security for one or more EU members.
EU countries have 31⁄2 years to implement these provisions.
The council is expected to formally endorse the legislative text
within the next few months. The legislation seems sure to be implemented as specified in 2011. ✦

ConocoPhillips ﬁnds gas with Poseidon-1
ConocoPhillips made an apparent natural gas discovery in the
Browse basin off Western Australia during the drilling of its Poseidon-1 wildcat in permit WA-315-P about 480 km north of
Broome.
The company intersected a 10 m hydrocarbon-bearing sand at a
depth of 4,796 m just below the top of the Mid-Jurassic Plover formation, followed by two additional hydrocarbon-bearing intervals

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

of 67 m and 114 m deeper in the stratigraphic section. Mud logs
and logging-while-drilling equipment indicated hydrocarbons are
present. The shows have yet to be fully evaluated but will be analyzed on completion of drilling and wireline logging operations.
The find, which is likely to be gas and condensate, lies just to
the north of Woodside Energy Ltd.’s giant Torosa gas-condensate
field and northwest of Inpex Corp.’s Ichthys gas-condensate field.
The well is being drilled by semisubmersible Sedco 703 and

Africa Oil gets blocks in Ethiopia, Kenya
Africa Oil Corp., Vancouver, BC, acquired Lundin Petroleum AB’s
portfolio of exploration block interests in Ethiopia and Kenya for
$23.7 million.
The blocks are in the underexplored East African rift basin petroleum system.
The acquisition included an 85% working interest in Blocks 2,
6, 7, and 8 and a 50% working interest in the Adigala block in
Ethiopia and a 100% interest in Block 10A and a 30% interest in
Block 9 in Kenya (see map, OGJ, Apr. 14, 2008, p. 40). Africa Oil
will become operator except on Block 9.
The deal brings Africa Oil’s total holding to more than 200,000
sq km. Good quality seismic data show robust leads and prospects
throughout the blocks, Africa Oil said.
The exploration program for the next 2 years includes seismic
and drilling in both countries. Africa Oil also plans to drill in Puntland, Somalia.

ENH, Kalila Energy sign gas exploration deal
Mozambique’s state-owned Empresa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos de Mocambique has sold Indonesia’s PT Kalila Energy Ltd.
a 75% stake in the Buzi Block for $30 million.
The partners will undertake natural gas exploration in the central Sofala province for the next 8 years and will drill two exploration and two appraisal wells.
The contract also provides for funding for social responsibility
and staff-training programs.
According to reports, Buzi holds estimated reserves of 10-17
bcf of gas.

Drilling

&

Trinidad and Tobago’s state-owned Petrotrin LLC signed an exploration and production contract with Bayfield Energy (Galeota)
Ltd. for exploration of Galeota block and revitalization of Trintes
oil field.
Malcolm Jones, Petrotrin executive chairman, said Bayfield will
pay all of Petrotrin’s capital investment and operating expenses in
respect of the minimum work obligations for the first 4 years.
“This work obligation consists of both seismic and exploration wells together with production enhancement facilities,” Jones
said. He said Trintes oil field, which was discovered in the 1960s
and had so far produced 22 million bbl of oil, will be revitalized
and that recent seismic surveys had revealed the real possibility of
another Trintes look-alike field in the southwest quadrant of the
block.
“There is a high probability of finding additional hydrocarbons
in commercial quantities,” Jones said. Burren Energy won the bid
to explore Galeota block, but UK-based oil company was sold in
2007 to the Italy’s ENI SPA for $3.5 billion. Burren Energy’s operations include oil fields in Turkmenistan, Congo, Egypt, and Yemen.
Burren’s shareholders then invested in Bayfield.
Jones said the exploration program will involve the acquisition
of 120 sq km of full-fold 3D seismic and drilling of at least seven
exploration wells to depths ranging 6,500-12,000 ft. “Through
this aggressive exploration development program, both Petrotrin
and Bayfield remain hopeful that production can be optimised and
that there will be major successes in Galeota.
Bayfield Chief Operating Officer Simon Gill said, “By that time,
we think the world economy should be improving and the oil
price should improve. Now is a good time for us to get in and do
the work. Hopefully, we’ll get good prices for doing the work and
you get your reserves in the future.”
Galeota block lies 6 nautical miles east of Galeota Point in southeastern Trinidad. Bayfield will hold a 65% working interest in the
new licence and be the operator of the asset and Petrotrin will hold
a 35% nonoperating interest.
Bayfield plans to spend $110 million on the project. ✦

Kentucky sets CO2 EOR, sequestration projects
Projects to sequester carbon dioxide and test its use in enhanced
oil recovery are under way in western Kentucky.
As much as 8,000 tons of CO2 is to be injected for 6 months
into the Mississippian Jackson sandstone at 1,870 ft in a well in
Sugar Creek field in Hopkins County.
Three producing wells operated by Gallagher Drilling Inc.,
Evansville, Ind., will be monitored for changes in production as
the result of the CO2 injection, which is to start in mid-May. The
geological surveys of Kentucky and Illinois are cooperating in the
project.
Meanwhile, the Kentucky Geological Survey spud a well Apr. 23
in southeastern Hancock County, Ky., 8 miles southeast of Hawesville,

PTT could buy gas from Natuna D Alpha block
Indonesia is negotiating with Thailand’s PTT PLC for the purchase of undisclosed volumes of natural gas from the Natuna D
Alpha block, according to a senior government official.
“We are currently still negotiating the gas price and the possibility of transporting it to Rayong, [Thailand,]” said Indonesia’s
Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Purnomo Yusigantoro.
Purnomo, speaking before the Indonesian Association of Petroleum Engineers, said PTT had earlier been in talks with Indonesia
to buy gas from other blocks, but at that time the company decided
to obtain its gas supply from Myanmar instead.

“The gas supply [from Myanmar] now seems to be declining,
so the company is looking for gas from other sources,” said Purnomo, who did not detail how much gas PTT might buy, saying the
volume was still under negotiation, along with pricing.
Meanwhile, state-owned PT Pertamina has still not decided on
its new partner for the development of Natuna D Alpha’s reserves,
but Purnomo said the state firm and the Indonesian government
would offer the block’s natural gas to potential buyers anyway.
“We are always looking for the market, because we don’t want
to be too late,” said Purnomo, who added that buyers must be
found before the block enters production, which may begin in
2017.
Initially, Pertamina and ExxonMobil Corp. had rights over the
Natuna D Alpha block, but the government decided in 2005 not
to extend the US firm’s contract, saying it had failed to submit the
results of a feasibility study.
In June 2008, the Indonesian government appointed Pertamina
to develop the block, and the state firm shortlisted eight potential
partners: ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Chevron Corp., Eni
SPA, Total SA, StatoilHydro, China National Petroleum Corp., and
Petronas.

BP: End US import tax on Brazilian ethanol
BP PLC has sent a letter to the California Air Resources Board
(CARB), calling for its support in ending US import duties on Brazil’s sugarcane-based ethanol.
According to the letter, seen by Brazil’s state news agency, BP
“believes sugarcane-based ethanol will be the lowest-carbon biofuel available in the first years of the Low-Carbon Fuel Standard.”
By supporting the end of import taxes on Brazil’s ethanol, the
letter says, California would send a strong sign to lawmakers in
Washington, DC, that the state is seriously committed to meeting
emission targets.
The agency said BP is the only oil company in the world that
invests in Brazil’s ethanol, holding a 50% stake in Tropical Bioenergia, located in Goias state, which started operations in September
2008.
The stake resulted from $683 million investments made jointly
with the Maeda Group and SantelisaVale, now controlled by Louis
Dreyfus Commodities.
BP Chief Executive Officer Tony Wayward recently said the company will invest $6 million in Brazil’s sugarcane-based ethanol over
the next 10 years.
CARB was to vote on Apr. 30 regarding new regulations to re10

StatoillHydro will finish the turnarounds by Oct. 1 to meet gas
delivery commitments and avoid poor weather.
The company has shut down LNG production from Snohvit
following problems with its seawater heat exchangers. Two of the
seven were replaced last autumn, and four more are due to go during a lengthy turnaround after the summer.
Many installations on the NCS will be upgraded, the company
said. “Compared with 2008, when 26 shutdowns involved 270,000
work-hr in all, this year’s program involves fewer but larger operations. Some 313,000 hr are due to be worked.”
The first shutdown began Apr. 2 on Statfjord B and is a major
program that will be the last on the platform to extend the field’s
production life.
Oseberg also will be refurbished in June, which includes repairing the flare system at the field center and implementing part of the
low-pressure project.
Capacity upgrades are planned for Snorre A, while work on Troll
A includes preparations for a new gas pipeline to Kollsnes and expansion of the living quarters.
Statfjord field’s life has been extended beyond 2020. This project is estimated at 23 billion kroner, including the Tampen Link
pipeline, which delivers Statfjord gas to the UK, and the submersible pumps for Statfjord B and C. But this is higher than the original
estimate of 15 billion kroner.
StatoilHydro and its partners are to invest in eight new electrical
submersible pumps on the Statfjord C platform, and they are considering adding four pumps on the Statfjord B platform.
Total investment for the submersible pumps on Statfjord B and
C is in the range of 3.5 billion kroner, and is subject to approval by
the partners. ✦

The changes fall into three separate areas, it said. FTC’s guide
would adopt EPA’s revised fuel economy labeling requirements. It
would be modified to expand the scope of existing guidelines to
include new vehicle types that run on fuels other than gasoline,

such as natural gas and electricity. And it would include guidance
related to cruising range information in advertisements for vehicles
that run on alternative fuels.
FTC said it would publish a notice about the proposed changes

Mitsubishi-led LNG project may be shelved
The Japanese-led consortium seeking to build the Senoro LNG
plant in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, may have to delay its plans due
to lower reserves of natural gas in the Senoro and Matindok fields
than earlier estimated.
“We are now waiting for the operators to decide whether they
still want to develop the project with the lower proven reserve,” said
Indonesia’s Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro, in reference to the consortium comprised of state-owned
PT Pertamina (Persero), PT Medco E&P, and Mitsubishi Corp.
Purnomo, who said upstream oil and gas regulator BPMigas
also would discuss the matter with the consortium, announced Indonesia’s state-owned oil and gas research and development center
(Lemigas) had found reserves in the fields to be lower than the
consortium’s estimate of 2.4 tcf.
The minister did not detail Lemigas’ findings, saying the institution
“might” publish its results later on. But ministry adviser and former
BPMigas chairman Kardaya Warnika said the lower proven gas reserves
meant the LNG plant could not meet its initial production target.
“Lower proven gas reserves means less LNG production,” said
Kardaya. “Thus the plant may not be able to meet its initial production target of 2 million tonnes/year of LNG.”
The Senoro LNG project came under public scrutiny when PT
LNG Energi Utama (LEU) last August filed a lawsuit against Mitsubishi over claims the Japanese firm had unfairly won the project.
LEU, which claims exclusive rights to be involved in the Senoro
LNG project, filed its lawsuit with Indonesia’s Business Competition Supervisory Agency, which still has the case under review.
Mitsubishi holds a 51% stake in the Senoro LNG project, while
Pertamina holds 29% and Medco E&P holds 20%.

Indonesian ﬁrms need $6.5 billion for tanker ﬂeet
Indonesian shipping firms, eyeing favorable new legislation,
need $6.5 billion to purchase 127 ships to replace foreign-flagged
tankers currently carrying oil and gas in that country’s waters.
“We need around 5-year $6.5 billion loans to build new ships to
substitute for the foreign ships,” said Johnson W. Sutjipto, chairperson of the Indonesian National Ship-owners’ Association (INSA).
According to Johnson, who spoke before a conference on ship finance, foreign shipping firms earn $1.385 billion/year from the operation of 127 ships for oil and gas transport, as well as offshore activities.
Johnson spoke about changes in Indonesian law regarding the transport of oil and gas in domestic waters. Under the new legislation, which
comes into effect in January 2010, foreign ships will not be able to operate
in Indonesian waters and must be replaced by Indonesian-flagged ships.
“This offers opportunities for national banks to finance new
ship procurement for oil and gas transportation,” said Johnson,

who also noted key difficulties for local shipbuilders.
“The problem is the national shipping industry still faces difficulty in getting domestic financing since the banking industry
demands a long-term transportation contract and a 30% equity
financing from a shipyard company,” he said.
While foreign banks are ready to finance the ship procurement,
Johnson said they are hesitant because Indonesia has not yet ratified international legislation that would enable them to recover
their investment through the arrest of ships.
Meanwhile, the state Bank of Indonesia released data showing that
shipping loans as of February still represented just 2% of the bank’s
total loans, despite an 80% increase in shipping loans year-on-year.
BI Deputy Governor Muliaman D. Hadad said the small loan
percentage was due to uncertainty in the banking sector over the
lack of transparency in the shipping industry. “If there is no transparency regarding the business risk, it will be difficult for banks to
give loans,” Muliaman said.

Ice-breaker tugs for Kashagan planned
Kazakhstan’s JSC Circle Marine Invest has awarded a $113 million contract to STX Europe ASA, the Norwegian unit of South Korea’s STX Group, for the construction of three ice-breaker tugs for
use in the Kashagan offshore oil field development.
STX Europe’s subsidiary Aker Arctic will design the three ice-breakers, which will be built largely in the STX RO Offshore shipyard based in
Braila, eastern Romania, with delivery scheduled for 2010 and 2011.
JSC Circle Marine Invest subsidiary Caspian Offshore Construction will
operate the vessels, which have a length of 65 meters and a beam of 16.4
meters.The tugs will be equipped and designed for other operations such
as fire fighting, rescue operation, and towing in shallow waters.
According to Mikko Niini, President of Aker Arctic Technology
Inc., the Caspian icebreaker tugs are based on the technology used
in the first Aker Arctic DAS icebreakers which have operated for
more than 10 years in the Kashagan oil development.
The Kashagan field holds recoverable oil reserves estimated at
13 billion bbl, and is expected to produce as much as 1.5 million
b/d of oil at its peak in the next decade.
However, the field’s development has been hindered with delays
due to technical difficulties and disputes between the government
and foreign firms over costs and profit distribution.
One of the Kashagan consortium partners last month gave assurances that the global economic crisis would not hinder the development of the offshore oilfield and may even help reduce costs.
“The plan is still to have first production as announced, in the
fourth quarter of 2012,” said Campbell Keir, Royal Dutch Shell
manager for the Caspian region. “The economic situation and the
low oil price should allow us to bring the cost down.” ✦

MANAGING THE DIGITAL TIDAL WAVE WITH PETRIS

Today’s exploration and production
(E&P) professionals are ﬂooded with what
often seems like a tidal wave of digital
information.
We are in an unprecedented time in
our history with the amount of data that
the oil and gas industry collects, stores,
accesses and interprets. The accumulation
of all this digital information translates
into an annual growth of approximately
60 percent each year, according to leading
industry estimates.
Data, in all its forms, has truly become
the lifeblood of E&P organizations. The
entire corporation and every department
use data associated with all aspects of
exploration, drilling, production, and
delivery. Due to this, data in different and
incompatible formats, of differing quality
and integrity, multiplies explosively and
often becomes scattered around the entire
organization into an ever-growing and
increasing number of datasets and point
solutions.
With this volume comes tremendous
uncertainty. The lack of accuracy,
consistency and completeness of large
datasets reduces user conﬁdence and trust
in the data that is delivered to the desktop.
Data quality issues that were formerly
isolated in a functional group can now
cause havoc department and companywide, as the poor data is integrated and
propagated across the enterprise. This
is why there is such increasing emphasis
upon enterprise-wide data quality and
integration solutions.
Petris has been at the forefront of data
management innovations over the years
and has become a leading technology
provider, with a proven track record across
the globe. The company understands the
trend in juxtaposing technical processes
and business processes to help E&P
organizations better manage and know
their data. Over the years, Petris has
actively researched data management and
data integration approaches and has taken
a leadership role in providing solutions.

ECONOMIC REALITIES
Compared to the past,
more companies struggle
to manage the large wave
of data required to make
critical decisions, whether
it is planning a new well
or assigning resources to
different projects. An E&P
company’s success is not
proven by the amount
of data a company has at
its ﬁngertips, but by the
manner in which the data is
used to add value.
This becomes even more challenging
in a volatile economic climate when the
survival of E&P companies is highly
dependent on how their data can be
used to ﬁnd and produce more, with
a lower margin for error. IT budgets
are under greater scrutiny and less
capital is available to take on optional
or “experimental” data management

and processes, oil company physical
assets, such as reservoir and equipment,
need to be combined to support the
business and decision-making within
energy companies. IT will likely be
expected to become the ‘glue’ to facilitate
this transition, while ensuring proper
collaboration in data sharing across
the enterprise.

An E&P’s success is not proven by the amount
of data a company has at its ﬁngertips, but by the
manner in which the data is used to add value.
initiatives – it is now universal in
operations and management functions
that every dollar invested in IT and data
management be justiﬁed and proven.
Another difﬁcult reality E&P’s face is
managing the workforce crew change.
A large percentage of the industry is
expected to retire over the next decade.
The next-generation technologists have
raw skills, but not the same level of
E&P-speciﬁc experience and insight of
the people they replace. In addition, this
“Google generation” will want accurate
and trustworthy information with only
a few clicks. This means better business
processes, workﬂows, and practices
need to be developed in real-time to
capture and pass along the institutional
knowledge. In addition to the people

EMERGING TRENDS
The good news is that because the
industry has become a leader in stretching
the limits of technology, there is
tremendous innovation being developed,
which is driving:
• More pro-active technology providers to
deliver much more value for less cost;
• Advances in master data management
and authoritative data stores;
• Increasing integration between technical
processes with e-business processes,
leading technology providers, to build
solutions based on the latest and most
ﬂexible technology, such as Java,
.NET, Microsoft Ofﬁce SharePoint
Software (MOSS), and service oriented
architecture (SOA);

It is also important that E&P companies
choose a partner who is not exclusive
and can interoperate with any technology
solution. Biggest is not better, as most
innovation comes from companies that
are cost-effective, dynamic, agile, and
able to work with energy organizations
as a partner. Flexibility, know-how, and
reliability are key.

FINDING THE RIGHT
TECHNOLOGY PARTNER

quality of the analysis. Petris provides the
oil and gas industry with:
• Industry-leading level of domain
knowledge required to tackle difﬁcult
data challenges;
• Signiﬁcant research and development
focused around ways to identify,
aggregate, review, clean, and manage
data over its life cycle;
• A more effective way to trust and know
the quality of data, automate workﬂows,
track information heritage, recall and
integrate borehole data, plan and model
drilling data, and access operational
information in real-time; and,
• Visualization tools, montaging and

Repository, and Master Hub.
Well MDM is an evolving approach to
E&P enterprise data management. It is
not another repository of well information
only used by part of an organization. For
example, a well database for geological and
geophysical (G&G) data is not considered
to be MDM. Nor is MDM a data mart,
warehouse of well information or an
enterprise-wide, single source repository.
In other words, just because you have a list
of wells, it does not mean you have Master
Data Management.
Well MDM is a cross-functional, time
dimensional approach to managing well
data across the entire life cycle. It has to
embrace the whole organization and all
its functions, not just one part of it. It has
to link those estimating the future with
those planning the present, in engineering,
production, reservoir estimating,
accounting and even HR. Once this is
achieved, the operational systems in the
enterprise can share this master data and
deliver harmonized business intelligence.
In other words, users can then access
master data as a trusted source of truth,
knowing that the linked cross references
are correct and accurate.
The PetrisWINDS DataVera™ suite
of data quality and MDM tools helps
E&P experts implement infrastructures
to maintain only one well master registry
and retain conﬁdence in the master list
through ongoing data quality governance.
In addition, DataVera automates arduous
tasks that are often performed manually
through a repeatable and automated
repository of business rules.

Manage Master List with DataVera™

BUILDING AN AUTHORITATIVE
DATA SOLUTION
In addition to MDM implementations,
today’s oil and gas companies experience the
pressures of having enterprise-wide data right
now, in real time. The company has developed
the “Petris OneSource” product and service
line to help clients better manage E&P data
during the whole interpretation process.
OneSource leverages the power of Petris’
SOA solution, PetrisWINDS Enterprise®,
to provide an open, readily accessible and
fully reliable source of information for users,
leveraging a wide variety of applications across
the enterprise. An authoritative data solution
can help users from different departments
and functions discover, browse, and access
the one source of deﬁnitive data, without
additional engineering.
Petris has helped clients embark on
initiatives to deploy an authoritative data
store. The goal of such projects is to create a single repository where users can go
to ﬁnd trustworthy data. Creating simply
another database isn’t the answer. Petris’
solutions provide users with a trusted source
of information that is scalable and can accommodate change without modifying the
underlying technology infrastructures. This
has already proven value in reducing project
turnaround time to weeks instead of months.
As a prime technology partner, Petris
provides ongoing value-added solutions by
quickly responding to changing requirements and specialized client requests. By
collaborating on successful projects and
documenting the learnings, Petris continuously applies pertinent industry-focused
practices into the full technology portfolio,
available to the global customer base.

SOLUTIONS COME AND GO,
BUT DATA IS FOREVER
The productive life of oil and gas assets
often spans decades. Newly acquired
assets will likely have years’ worth of
supporting data. Even if a company owns
an asset for only a short time, managing
it for the long term is the best way to
increase its value. To do this requires
access to various types of data - typically
held in many formats - to help the owners
best decide what to do today.
Geoscientists require complete access
to a broad range of well bore data - including petrophysical logs, dip meter and
core data - to make informed decisions.
PetrisWINDS Recall, the world-standard
for well bore data management, coupled
with its broad array of petrophysical logs,
dip, and image processing tools makes it
the fastest and easiest way to quality control, store, analyze, and provide access to
wellbore data.
Recall leverages a powerful and extensive data dictionary along with a robust
and scalable architecture to support all
types of borehole data. Recall’s petrophysical interpretation and visualization
applications are sophisticated tools for
imaging and understanding the subsurface on the basis of wellbore data. This
understanding is a keystone for building
the earth models used to plan drilling and

production programs and to stretch every
budget dollar to its best outcome.

OPTIMIZING OPERATIONS–
GETTING TO THE LAST
RECOVERABLE DOLLAR

CONTROLLING THE DELUGE OF
CRUCIAL DRILLING DATA

Accessing and understanding the volumes
of information derived from drilling,
completion, well servicing and production
activities are signiﬁcant challenges for
energy companies. How you manage
the workﬂow process is increasingly
important to overall productivity.

Of all the processes in the lifecycle for an
oil and gas asset, drilling is one of the most
expensive and certainly one of the most
critical. Companies drill exploration wells
to deﬁne prospects. These wells also provide
information, such as logs or core samples,
used in conjunction with seismic and other
data to better understand the subsurface
for optimal placement of production wells.
PetrisWINDS DrillNET provides a single,
uniﬁed environment across a broad range of
drilling applications to deliver effective well
planning and analysis.
The DrillNET drilling program includes
carefully designed well plans that beneﬁt
from a sound understanding of the geology,
geophysics and ﬂuid ﬂow characteristics
of the asset to be produced. Increasingly
complex earth models - which incorporate
all the data known about the prospect - form
the basis of the drilling program. Integration
of information and models form a variety of
sources and are the basis of the earth models
that are drilled ‘electronically’ prior to, or in
conjunction with, drilling operations. Not
to be left out, conventional wells can beneﬁt
from the same up-front planning as do more
complex deep water or non-vertical wells.

OpCenter Wellbore Viewer
Operational and business data are often
gathered from widely dispersed and
rapidly changing sources. Financial
managers require faster and more accurate
reporting than ever before; management
criteria and strategies can ﬂuctuate
dramatically with changing market
conditions and business drivers. As a
result, your decision making process must
be reliable, ﬂexible and responsive to your
company’s business workﬂow cycle.
Petris has designed the industry’s ﬁrst
integrated, enterprise solution for optimizing operational real time and near-real time
dataﬂows to enable the digital oilﬁeld. Its
foundation is a data management layer that
links task-speciﬁc centers and user work
processes together. The Operations Center
(OpCenter) suite of software captures all
the detailed information involved in drilling a well, from planning to the last bit
run and produces the drilling reports that
engineers and managers need.

RIDING THE NEW WAVE: “PETRIS’
ONE TOUCH” E&P PORTAL
With of the huge deluge of global
information ﬂowing 24 hours a day, 7
days a week, 365 days per year, today’s

In troubled times fierce global
competition for premium crudes
means that refinery units must
have the flexibility to handle
heavy, viscous, dirty crudes that
increasingly threaten to dominate
markets. And flexibility must
extend to products as well as
crudes, for refinery product
demand has become more and
more subject to violent economic
and political swings. Thus refiners must have the greatest flexibility in determining yields of
naphtha, jet fuel, diesel and vacuum gas oil products.

Why Do Many
Crude/Vacuum
Units Perform
Poorly?
In many cases it’s because the
original design was based more
on virtual than actual reality.
There is no question: computer
simulations have a key role
to play but it’s equally true
that process design needs to be
based on what works in the field
and not on the ideals of the
process simulator. Nor should the
designer simply base the equipment selection on vendor-stated
performance. The design engineer needs to have actual refinery
process engineering experience,
not just expertise in office-based

modeling. Refinery hands-on
experience teaches that fouling,
corrosion, asphaltene precipitation, crude variability, and crude
thermal instability, and many
other non-ideals are the reality.
Theoretical outputs of process or
equipment models are not. In this
era of slick colorful PowerPoint®
presentations by well-spoken
engineers in Saville Row suits,
it’s no wonder that units don’t
work. Shouldn’t engineers wearing Nomex® coveralls who have
worked with operators and taken
field measurements be accorded
greater credibility?
Today more than ever before this
is important. Gone are the days
when a refiner could rely on
uninterrupted supplies of light,
sweet, easy-to-process crudes.

Suite 130
Houston, Texas 77005
USA

Rather than a single point process
model, the crude/vacuum unit
design must provide continuous
flexibility to operate reliably over
long periods of time. Simply
meeting the process guarantee 90
days after start-up is very different than having a unit still operating well after 5 years. Sadly few
refiners actually achieve this—no
matter all the slick presentations
by engineers in business suits!

If you want to explore these issues
in technical detail ask for
Technical Papers 267 and 268.

Dollars and energy
Because the US government plans to spend
heavily on energy over the next decade, taxpayers
have reason to wonder what they’ll get for their
money. Answers won’t come easily. The spending
will take many forms, from direct payments on activities such as clean-coal research to tax incentives
for renewable energy and conservation. No simple
accounting will be available.
A new report from the US Energy Information
Administration nevertheless suggests where the
country is heading in its latest experiment with
governmental fuel selection. According to EIA, the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(ARRA)—the stimulus bill signed by President
Barack Obama on Feb. 17—definitely will change
patterns of energy use and production in the next
2 decades. But it won’t meet ambitious goals by
which the spending and market intrusions have
been marketed.
What ARRA will do is cost money. The administration estimates ARRA spending on energy will
total $65 billion through 2019. Against that cost,
the EIA report holds up important performance
metrics.

Important changes
The report updates EIA’s Annual Energy
Outlook 2009 to accommodate two important
changes: deterioration of the global economy and
enactment of ARRA. EIA compares the new projection to 2030 not only with the original report but
also with a forecast predicated on new economic
conditions without ARRA. “The effect of ARRA
alone, including its energy-related provisions and
its stimulative impact on the economy, can be
roughly estimated by comparing the no-stimulus
case to the updated reference case,” EIA says.
Relative to the no-stimulus case, the updated
forecast incorporating ARRA changes sees major
expansion of renewable energy for power generation, of wind generation, and of geothermal and
biomass capacities. It also expects lower energy
use for buildings and lower household and commercial spending for nontransportation energy.
Total energy consumption in 2020, the outer limit
for ARRA spending, will be 104.67 quadrillion
BTUs (quads), EIA now predicts. That’s 0.54 quads
higher than in the no-stimulus case—up in all
28

categories except natural gas and nuclear.
ARRA lifts total US energy production by 0.49
quads to 81.88 quads in 2020 from the no-stimulus
level, with increases confined to coal, biomass, and
other renewables—the big beneficiaries of spending under the stimulus bill. The measure pushes up
the combined contribution to 2020 energy supply
of those sources by 1.91 quads. If half the federal
energy spending under ARRA relates to supply, the
US will have spent $17/MMbtu to achieve an annual
boost from favored energy forms representing 2.3%
of total domestic production. For perspective, natural
gas is now worth about $3.30/MMbtu crude oil
about $8.60/MMbtu. The total supply increment for
coal, biomass, and other renewable energy is only
fractionally greater in 2030 against the no-stimulus
assumption than it is in 2020.
US import dependency declines over the course
of the study period in all cases, but differences between the no-stimulus case and new projection are
negligible. In 2030, the US still relies on foreign
sources for 22-23% of its energy in the EIA forecast. This is not energy independence, a prominent
goal of energy policy-making.
Oil as a share of total consumption also falls
slightly—from 40% in 2007 to 37% in 2020 and
36-37% in 2030. Again, differences in specific
years with and without ARRA are slight. So the
new law advances the US very little toward the
goal enunciated by Obama in February to “begin
to end the tyranny of oil in our time.” The decline
was going to happen anyway.

Emission changes
Differences are bigger for energy-related emissions
of carbon dioxide, another driver of energy policy.
They’re 1.3% lower with ARRA than without it in
2013 and 0.6% lower in 2030. But those differences
are inconsequential to global average temperature.
The ARRA commits Americans to major expenditure on energy behavior that few would choose
for themselves. It does so in service to energy
goals—supply independence, greatly diminished
reliance on oil, moderation of observed warming—that it will not attain.
Major spending on minor achievements is
a poor deal in any system of economics. Some
might call it senseless. ✦

A proposal to allow work by US oil
and gas companies off Cuba appears in
a broad set of recommendations made
before President Barack Obama on Apr.
13 eased travel and financial restrictions
on the island nation.
A group of former ambassadors,
foreign policy specialists, and professors
working in a Brookings Institution project on Feb. 26 published
33 steps toward renewal
of relations between the
two countries in Miami, Fla., home to many
Cuban-Americans and the
center of opposition to
restoration of relations.
A step allowing licenses for US
companies to develop offshore oil,
gas, and renewable energy is one of
10 “medium-term initiatives” recommended by the 19-member group in its
Roadmap for Critical and Constructive
Engagement (see table, opposite page).
The group’s project is called US Policy
toward a Cuba in Transition.
Obama’s move represents a tentative
loosening of the trade embargo that
the US imposed in 1962 after breaking diplomatic relations with Cuba a
year earlier. The US took those steps in
response to Fidel Castro’s revolutionary assumption of power in 1959 and
alignment with the old Soviet Union.
The US president’s measured overture partly reflects concerns in the US
about the power void that will develop
when 78-year-old Raul Castro, who
succeeded his brother as the Cuban
president in February 2008, becomes
unable to govern.
Foreign policy officials fear that
Cuba without either Castro brother
in firm command will become an
unstable prize sought by Venezuela’s
anti-US President Hugo Chavez, slide
back into the orbit of Russian influence,
or degenerate into lawlessness subject
to exploitation by terrorists and drug
cartels (see Comment).

Oil linked to US move
toward thaw with Cuba

A member of Petrocaribe, the alliance of Caribbean countries that buy
oil from Venezuela under preferential
terms, Cuba receives 94,000-96,000
b/d from the South American exporter.
That’s more than all the other 17 members combined.
Cuba consumes about 150,000 b/d
of oil and produces 54,000 b/d of
crude oil and natural gas liquids. Gas
production is 20,000-22,000 boed.
According to Jorge Pinon, energy
fellow at the Center for Hemispheric
Policy at the University of Miami and
author of the Comment on p. 32, Cuba
hasn’t paid for the Venezuelan oil since
2003. The Chavez regime thus holds
great leverage over the Cuban government not only as a principal supplier of
oil but as a creditor as well.
Pinon points out that worry about
Venezuelan influence explains Raul
Castro’s recent visits to capitals of other
major oil exporters.
Cuba has offered onshore and
offshore exploration and production
rights to international operators in
recent years under production-sharing
contracts. Some of the blocks cover
deep water of the southeastern Gulf of
Mexico (see map, OGJ, Dec. 11, 2000,
p. 42).
Repsol YPF in 2004 drilled a deepwater well, the Yamagua-1, in 1,660 m
of water that was reported to have indicated oil generation in the basin. Norsk
Hydro and ONGC Videsh of India later
acquired interests in the block.
Cuba’s existing production comes
from onshore and near-shore fields. The
oil is heavy—10-15° gravity—and high
in sulfur.
Sherritt International, Toronto, is the
major non-Cuban producer, accounting for
about 30,000 b/d of gross production.

Reﬁning a question

A question for Cuba is what to do
with any increase that develops in crude
oil production. Its domestic refining
capacity is limited, and US sanctions

But they don’t achieve operating rates
anywhere near nameplate levels.
The Havana refinery, formerly ShellEsso, has capacity of 121,000 b/d but
operates at only about 20,000 b/d and
probably will be closed. The refinery
formerly owned by Texaco at Santiago
de Cuba has capacity of 101,000 b/d
but operates at about 22,000 b/d.
The 66,000-b/d Cienfuegos refinery has been operating at 53,000 b/d.
It has 8,000 b/d of hydrotreating,
8,000 b/d of catalytic reforming, and
10,0000 b/d of light ends fractionation

According to Oil & Gas Journal’s
Worldwide Refining survey, the Havana
facility is the only one of the three

refineries with significant conversion

Venezuela has asserted plans to invest
$10 billion in downstream projects
in Cuba by 2015 through a unit of
state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA
working with its Cuban counterpart,
Cubapetroleo SA (Cupet). With oil
prices low, however, there are questions
whether all or any of the projects will
be funded (see map).
At Cienfuegos, the Venezuelan
government proposes to spend $3.7
billion to expand crude oil distillation
capacity to 150,000 b/d and add a
delayed coker. The completion target is
2012.
Also at Cienfuegos, Venezuela pro-

poses to build an LNG terminal with
two 1 million-tonne/year trains at an
estimated cost of $440 million. The
terminal would start up in 2013.
It plans to expand the Santiago de
Cuba refinery to 50,000 b/d of crude
capacity and add heavy bottoms conversion capacity by 2013.
Venezuela proposes to build a
150,000 b/d refinery at Matanzas with
75,000 b/d of upgrading capacity for
heavy Cuban crudes. The refinery, estimated to cost $4.3 billion, would start
up in 2015.
Other proposals include improvements to the Matanzas and Cienfuegos
harbors, reactivation of a crude oil
pipeline between the cities, and new
crude and products storage. Those

Oil work can be part of US-Cuban rapprochement
Jorge R. Pinon
Center for Hemispheric Policy
University of Miami
Two thirds of Cuba’s petroleum
demand currently relies on imports,
and Venezuela is the single source of
these imports under heavily subsidized
payment terms.
This petroleum dependency, valued
at over $3 billion in 2008, could be
used by Venezuela as a tool to inﬂuence a future Cuban government in
maintaining a politically antagonistic
and belligerent position
toward the US.
Cuba has learned
from experiences and is
very much aware of the political and
economic risks and consequences
of depending on a single source for
imported oil. The collapse of the Soviet
Union and the 2003 Venezuelan oil
strike taught Cuba very expensive lessons.
President Raul Castro understands
the risks; his recent visits to major oil
exporters such as Brazil, Russia, Angola, and Algeria underscore his concerns. A relationship with Brazil would
provide a balance to Cuba’s current
dependency, while others could bring
with it corrupt and unsavory business
practices.
Only when Cuba diversiﬁes suppliers and develops its offshore resources, estimated by the US Geological
Survey to be at 5.5 billion bbl of oil
and 9.8 tcf of natural gas undiscovered

projects, estimated to cost $1.6 billion,
would be completed by 2012.

Obama’s move

13 included nothing directly related to
oil and gas.

want no warming of US relations at all
with Cuba, the move implemented only

reserves, will it have the economic
independence needed to consider a
political and economic evolution.

US restrictions
Although Cuban authorities have
invited US oil companies to participate
in developing their offshore oil and
natural gas resources, US law does not
allow it.
American oil and oil equipment and
service companies have the capital,
technology, and operational know-how

COMMENT
to explore, produce, and reﬁne in a
safe and responsible manner Cuba’s
potential oil and natural gas reserves.
Yet they remain on the sidelines
because of the almost 5-decade-old
unilateral political and economic embargo.
The president can end this impasse
by licensing American companies
to participate in developing Cuba’s
offshore oil and gas. Embargo regulations speciﬁcally give the secretary of
the treasury the authority to license
prohibited activities. The Helms-Burton
law codiﬁed the embargo regulations as well as the secretary’s power,
embedded in the codiﬁed regulations,
to rescind, modify, or amend them. The
proof of this is that several years after
the Helms-Burton law was enacted,
former President Bill Clinton expanded

a handful of the recommendations put
forward by the Brookings project.
Here are elements of Obama’s latest
initiative:
• Lift all restrictions on transactions
related to the travel of family members
to Cuba.
• Remove restrictions on remittances
to family members in Cuba.

travel and money transfers to the Cuban people and civil society.

Cuba’s future
By seizing the initiative on Cuba
policy, the president could claim an early
and relatively easy policy success. Critically, he would position the US to play
a role in Cuba’s future, thereby giving
Cubans a better chance for a stable and
democratic future.
A future Cuban government inﬂuenced by its energy benefactors would
most likely result in a continuation of the
current political and economic model.
If Cuba’s new leaders are unable to ﬁll
the power vacuum left by the departure
of the old cadre, they could
become pawns of illicit business activities and drug cartels,
and the US could face a mass
illegal immigration by hundreds of thousands of Cubans.
If US companies were allowed to
contribute in developing Cuba’s hydrocarbon reserves, as well as renewable
energy such as solar, wind, and sugarcane ethanol, the change would reduce
the inﬂuence of autocratic and corrupt
governments. Most importantly, it would
provide the US and other democratic
countries with a better chance of working with Cuba’s future leaders to carry
out reforms that would lead to a more
open and representative society.

of its Energy and Environment Subcommittee, introduced on Mar. 31.
Cavaney said when the hearing
recessed that the measure also doesn’t
consider the impacts of the federal
Renewable Fuel Standard, changing
blends, growing overseas competition
and falling demand on US refiners. The
bill also doesn’t recognize contributions
from renewable fuels actions that have
already occurred or domestic refiners
processing heavier grades of crude than
their non-US competitors.
“It is vital that the mechanisms for
allowance allocation to trade-exposed
energy-intensive industries are applied
fairly and in a way that comprehends
the fundamentals of how these markets
work. We are deeply concerned about
our ability to fully pass on these costs of

Cavaney testified that ConocoPhillips
believes that a mandatory US national
climate protection program linked
to other national and international
programs offers the best approach for
achieving meaningful global greenhouse gas emissions reductions.
“First, we believe that a welldesigned federal climate protection
program, as opposed to multiple state/
regional initiatives and other alternatives, would result in a more efficient
and less costly approach. Second, industry needs a consistent and enduring
climate change program to provide the
regulatory certainty necessary to make
informed, long-term investment decisions,” he said.

ConocoPhillips also claims there is

wholesaler, in his written statement.
The group said that the period
before the proposed cap-and-trade
program took effect in 2012 would be
critical. “One of the areas to watch is
the price of natural gas. US industries
would be placed at a further disadvantage to overseas competitors if it goes
too high,” said Chad Holliday, who
retired from DuPont Co. Jan. 1 after 10
years as its chairman.
Duke Energy Corp. Chief Executive James R. Rogers said the proposed
legislation recommends an economywide cap-and-trade program, which
falls within the recommendations of
USCAP’s Blueprint for Legislative Action. “It also proposes a greenhouse
gas registry and acknowledges the
need for significant cost-containment
mechanisms, including allowance
banking and borrowing, multiyear
compliance and the use of offsets as a
low-cost carbon emissions reduction
strategy,” he noted.

‘Good foundation’
The bill also allows for a periodic
assessment of the science behind it and
has provisions to implement a strategic reserve pool while accelerating
development, deployment, and commercialization of carbon capture and
storage and other zero- and low-carbon
technologies, Rogers continued. “There
is a good foundation here to build
upon and the draft’s 648 pages present
enough material to start lively conversations about a proposal that isn’t just
about climate change but, in fact, proposes a fundamental shift in US energy
policy,” he said.
“Then there is the case of the missing pages. These are the ones that contain the critical decision on how allowances will be distributed. Those pages,
for Duke Energy and its customers, are
the key to that third tenet of sound climate policy: protecting customers from

not burdened with unnecessary cost
increases is a mission from which I will
not retreat,” Rogers said.
Meg McDonald, global issues director at Alcoa Inc., said,“During the evolution toward a comprehensive global
emissions trading regime, transitional
arrangements for energy-intensive,
trade-exposed sectors will be necessary
to protect our competitiveness. This will
be essential to protect the employment
and contribution to the US economy
that industries such as aluminum, steel,
chemicals, glass and paper represent.”
When he testified as part of another
panel later in the day, Paul N. Cicio,
president of the Industrial Energy
Consumers of America, warned that
reducing US GHG emissions from about
7 billion to 5 billion tons in a relatively
short period without a readily available
supply of low-cost and low-carbon energy would raise energy prices significantly.
“Energy efficiency and renewable
energy will help, but will not close the
gap. CCS and nuclear will not be contributors over the next 10 years, which
means the power sector will be dependent on natural gas for power generation. Expansion of renewable energy
means electric utilities will be required
to build gas-fired back-up plants,” Cicio
said.

‘Signiﬁcant implications’
Cicio observed: “It is extremely
important to note that gas-fired power
generation sets the marginal price for
electricity. The implications are significant. As demand for gas goes up, prices
will go up, which will also increase the
price of electricity across the country, a
double-hit to consumers. Gas demand
by the power sector has grown by 28%
since 2000 while domestic gas production has increased only 7%.”
Others agreed that gas prices during
the transition need to be considered
more carefully. “US chemical makers
and other manufacturers simply cannot
compete effectively in a global market
with such high and volatile costs for a
key input. Congress can level the global

air pollutants, the threat to the ozone
layer, and other controversial issues. “I
believe the committee can make history
again this year, and this draft bill is a
good start,” she testified.
“Now, the ‘no, we can’t’ crowd will
spin out doomsday scenarios about
runaway costs. We do not claim to be
able to do something for nothing. But
EPA’s available economic modeling
indicates that the investment Americans
would make to implement the capand-trade program [under this bill]
would be very modest compared to the
benefits that science and plain common
sense tell us a comprehensive energy
and climate policy will deliver,” Jackson
maintained.
EPA distributed a preliminary analysis of the bill as she testified. It said that
the legislation would cost the average
US household an additional $98140/year before appliance efficiency,
weatherization, and other cost-saving
measures are taken. Its model projected
allowance prices of $13-17 in 2015
and $17-22 in 2020, adding that these
prices “would be over 96% higher if
the discussion draft did not allow substantial use of cost-saving offsets.”
Committee Republicans who had
expressed concern that the bill before them contained no cost estimates
pressed her for details. Jackson conceded that EPA’s analysis of costs involved
only part of the programs in the bill.
She said that the agency could provide
more comprehensive estimates with additional study.
GOP committee members primarily
objected to the missing cost estimates.

The bill also needs a feedstock credit,
Dooley maintained. “Slightly more than

feedstock, and those purchases account
for 70% of industry spending on energy inputs. When used as a feedstock,
most of these fossil fuels are converted
into products and do not emit greenhouse gases,” he said.
Three prominent Obama administration officials applauded the committee’s
efforts to develop cap-and-trade legislation in the hearing’s first panel. “While
we are still reviewing the details, it is
clear that Chairman Waxman’s legislation would advance the president’s
goals of launching a new sector of clean

and Commerce Committee announced
former Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.)
would follow former Vice-President Al
Gore (D) and former US Sen. John W.
Warner (R-Va.) during the third full
day of hearings Apr. 24 on proposed
climate change legislation.
A Republican committee source
told me negotiations began more than
a week earlier to bring more balance
to the hearings led by committee
chairman Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.)
and Edward J. Markey (D-Mass), who
chairs the committee’s Energy and
Environment Subcommittee.
“It was especially obvious with the
Gore-Warner panel. So the majority
agreed to invite Gingrich,” she told
me Apr. 27. The source didn’t say it,
but the majority made the former
speaker a solo witness instead of having him testify with Gore and Warner.

US taxpayers foot the bill.
“Now the bill before you would create a multi-billion dollar artificial market
for carbon, regulated and managed by
the US government, paid for by taxing
every American who uses energy,” Gingrich told committee members.
“With $2 trillion up for grabs, the
environmental pieties begin to be a
little difficult to take seriously. Lobbyists have not been hired for good citizenship and idealism. Lobbyists have
been hired to ensure their clients get
rich off this new government-managed flow of cash,” he observed.
The Waxman-Markey draft got a
few things right, he conceded. It restricts the US Environmental Protection Agency from regulating carbon.
It supports technologies to use more
coal in ways less damaging to the environment. And it promotes development of a smart electrical grid.

‘Intellectually dishonest’

But the bill provides more carbon
reduction punishments than incentives,
he continued. “This is simply an intellectually dishonest bill. It promises what
it cannot deliver and then punishes what
currently exists,” Gingrich declared.

there’s ever a good time to burden
American consumers with extra costs,
but I believe that now is probably the
worst time to implement an energy
program that will pass the costs directly
to the consumer every time we flip on a
light switch, turn up the thermostat, fill
up our [gasoline] tank, or purchase an
American-made product.
But the committee’s Democratic
leaders said that it was time to move
ahead on global climate change legislation. “We have reached a crossroads
where inaction is simply not an option,” said Markey, the chairman of the
committee’s Energy and Environment
Subcommittee. He said, “Our economy
cannot continue to depend heavily on
foreign oil. We cannot continue energy policies that look to last century’s
energy sources while other nations race
ahead to take the lead in developing and
marketing clean energy technologies
and green jobs.”
Waxman said committee members
from both parties and their staffs have
made a major commitment of their time,
which has been crucially important.
“I also want to warn you that as
hard as we have been working, the pace
is going to accelerate over the next 4
weeks. There are many issues that we
need to discuss and resolve between
now and Memorial Day. We will be
working hard because the goals are so
important. The energy legislation we
are considering will create millions of
jobs, revive our economy, and secure
our energy independence. It will also
protect our environment,” he said in his
opening statement.

NPRA’s stance
A law to address climate change,
according to National Petrochemical
& Refiners Association Pres. Charles T.
Drevna, should set a realistic carbon reduction target without political preconceptions or punitive provisions. Speaking Apr. 24 before the House Energy
and Commerce Committee, Drevna said
such a law also should protect affected

employees from foreign competition in
countries whose governments do not
constrain carbon dioxide emissions; not
mandate contradictory or redundant
policies; not establish a single federal
program that supersedes other federal,
state, and local programs and statutes;
and not give any form of energy an
advantage over others with respect to
carbon constraints, Drevna testified
during the third full day of hearings on
proposed cap-and-trade legislation.
“A rather rudimentary description
of the petroleum refining process, but
one that must be achieved in order to
facilitate technological and commercial
success, is the rearrangement of the links
between and among hydrocarbon molecules…. There are more consequential
links, as well: the link between energy
and economic strength for the entire
nation, and the link between energy and
American security,” Drevna said.
He said the essential question is
whether the Waxman-Markey proposal
will strengthen those links or create
adverse impacts not just for refiners but
the general economy.

‘One chance’
“The answer to this question must
be fully investigated, understood, and
documented before enactment of any
legislation. Most likely, we have but
one chance to get it right. The nation
simply cannot afford anything short of
complete understanding,” Drevna told
committee members.
International participation also is
critical to ensure that any US carbon reduction program actually reduces global
emissions while protecting the domestic
economy’s competitiveness, Drevna said.
“One ton of carbon dioxide emitted
in Columbus, Ohio, is indistinguishable from one ton emitted in Beijing,
Mumbai, or Moscow. Any legislation
enacted must contain robust provisions to prevent leakages of both jobs
and emissions. Without international
participation, any US carbon control
measures would have little or no impact
on global greenhouse gas emissions,”
Drevna said.

Another witness said the Alliance
of Automobile Manufacturers, which
represents 11 car and light-truck producers accounting for 80% of annual
US vehicle sales, was still analyzing the
Waxman-Markey legislative draft. But
Dave McCurdy, the group’s chief executive, said it lays out a basic framework
to address climate change which aligns
with the alliance’s core principles for
such a program.
“The long-term viability of any program will depend on a technologically
and economically sustainable transition

market-based measures to the greatest
extent possible. Such a program should

transparency to the consumer, who in

He said the proposed transition from
some free allowances to a full auction
addresses political issues associated with
the move to a carbon-capped world
while establishing a clear path to a
system where incremental carbon costs
are passed through. The transparency
of these costs is particularly important
in transportation, where manufacturers
expect energy providers to pass through
the market price of carbon, he said.
McCurdy said while scheduled

increase in [gasoline] prices last summer.
Just wait until they get their hands on

Rep. Fred Upton (Mich.), the Energy and
Environment Subcommittee’s ranking
minority member.
Approximately 21% of all US utility accounts were overdue in 2008 as
end-users carried past-due balances
averaging $160 for electricity and $360

the EPA administrator replied: “One

EPA’s release of preliminary cost estimates for the Waxman-Markey working draft during the Apr. 22 hearing
caused a mild stir. Republican committee members had complained that
the proposal said nothing about costs.
Rep. John M. Shimkus (R-Ill.) called
the omission “a big, gaping hole.” They
said the committee’s Democratic leaders
were moving it through so quickly that
the Congressional Budget Office, which
provides nonpartisan objective economic analyses for federal lawmakers, had
not had time to fully examine the draft.
Jackson emphasized that EPA’s
estimates were preliminary. They did
not consider the massive economic
recovery bill, with billions of dollars in
renewable energy and energy efficiency
investments, which Congress passed and
Obama signed earlier this year. They also
did not include significant provisions of
the Waxman-Markey working draft such
as the renewable electricity standard and
the energy efficiency standards.
The estimates found that costs under
the working draft would be low for the
average US household (27-38¢/day or
$98-140/year before appliance efficiency, weatherization, and other cost-saving measures were applied). Allowance
prices would be $13-17 in 2015 and
$17-22 in 2020. These would be 96%
higher if substantial use of cost-saving
offsets was not allowed, according to an
EPA handout distributed in the hearing
room as Jackson testified.

EPA asked to set new drillsite discharge standards
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Activist organizations are urging the
US Environmental Protection Agency
to expand regulation of wastewater
discharges from the oil and gas drilling
industry to cover a host of exploration,
stimulation, and extraction activities,
according to Water Policy Report.
Arguing that expanded development
and increased use of chemicals during
extraction are raising new concerns for
water quality, the activists say emerging water pollution problems associated
with these activities, especially horizontal
hydraulic fracturing for natural gas, have
revealed significant shortcomings in EPA’s

effluent limitations guidelines (ELGs) for
the oil and gas extraction sector.
However, industry sources told
WPR—a Washington publication covering EPA’s water quality and drinking
water programs—that new standards
would be unnecessary and ineffective.
New national standards are unsuitable because wastewater varies greatly
depending on regional geology, and
permit writers would have to revert to
their current case-by-case analysis anyway, one industry source said.

mental groups, including the Natural
Resources Defense Council and Waterkeeper Alliance, are urging the EPA to
set new wastewater discharge standards
for oil and gas development, according
to early April comments on the agency’s
final 2008 ELG program plan.
EPA is considering creation of a
new ELG for wastewater from coalbed
methane extraction and is collecting information on so-called produced water
discharges and treatment technologies.

The activists recommend:
• Setting a pretreatment standard
banning wastewater discharges to publicly owned treatment works (POTWs).
• Creating a new subcategory in the
centralized wastewater treatment plant
ELG to address oil or gas-related wastewaters with a zero discharge limit for
the subcategory.
• Regulating the storage of effluents
kept near the wellhead.
Environmentalists say new standards
are necessary because oil and gas development is expanding rapidly and because
the sector is developing previously uneconomic resources, which may require
more aggressive extraction practices.
The groups are especially concerned
about the practice of hydraulic fracturing,
where water and chemicals are forced into
the ground to crack shale formations and
release natural gas so it can be extracted.

The environmentalists say banning
wastewater discharges to POTWs is necessary because the treatment plants simply
dilute the wastewater, rather than treat for
the salts, minerals, and fracturing chemicals that may be in the wastewater.
As an example, the groups cite contamination of the Monongahela River in
Pennsylvania in late 2008. The river was
impaired by total dissolved solids such as
chlorides and sulfates, and activists say the
state environment department blamed the
contamination on the discharge of oil and
gas wastewater to POTWs.
Activists are urging EPA to gather and
publish information about the chemicals used in fracturing fluid and provide
toxicological, epidemiological, and fate
and transport data for the chemicals. The
groups also seek an ELG to set enforceable best management practices for storage of wastewater near the wellhead.

New standards necessary?
But industry sources say new standards are not necessary and would not
be effective. ELGs are technology-based
and are best suited to water treatment
systems where the contamination is
predictable, one industry source said.
Produced water from oil and gas
development, however, varies widely
depending on regional geology, the
source told WPR. So permit writers
would likely have to depart from the
ELG technology requirements and use
their best professional judgment, which
is the standard that permit-writers currently use, the source said.
There is also no need to ban discharges to POTWs, the industry source said.
Instead, water treatment plants should
determine whether their treatment is
adequate to deal with oil and gas wastewater and meet their standards.

A local industry source also raised
concerns with the environmentalists’
comments, WPR said.
Of the more than 7,000 drilling
permits issued by Pennsylvania in 2008,
fewer than 300 use hydraulic fracturing, the source said. And the water
quality incident in Pennsylvania, which
activists say proves POTW treatment is
inadequate for drilling wastewater, was

actually caused by runoff from abandoned coal mines, the source said.
Hydraulic fracturing has been used
since the 1950s, and new ELGs are not
necessary because oil and gas wastewater has been handled very well under
the current water permitting program,
the source said.
Because states like Pennsylvania have
been effective in dealing with unique
contents of wastewater from the region,

the source said, “We don’t believe EPA
needs to get involved at that level.”

DOE shale gas report
Meanwhile, the Department of Energy in April released a report examining the scope of regulatory oversight
for shale gas. It commissioned the
report from the Ground Water Protection Council, a group representing state
regulators of underground injection
wells and oil and gas interests.
The report, Modern Shale Gas
Development in the United States: A
Primer, downplays the potential for
environmental harm from increased use
of hydraulic fracturing, as well as from
extensive horizontal drilling. The report
said the latter “has not introduced any
new environmental concerns.”
Hydraulic fracturing, the report
argues, is a “key technology” for the
nation’s energy supply. There are some
challenges for water availability and
management, but “innovative regional
solutions are emerging that allow shale
gas development…while ensuring that
the water needs of other users are not
affected and that surface and ground
water quality is protected,” it said.
Rather than encourage new regulation or retraction of the exemptions
for hydraulic fracturing under the Safe
Drinking Water Act, the report deems
the current regulatory structure overseeing the environmental safety of
natural gas drilling to be largely safe.
The report notes repeatedly that
states, local governments, and tribes
may in many instances create more
stringent regulations than those federally mandated and examines requirements under the Clean Water Act, the
Clean Air Act, Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act, the Endangered
Species Act, and the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act.
Further, the report said, “Natural
gas will continue to play a significant
role in the US energy picture for some
time to come,” providing around 22%
of the nation’s energy over the next 20
years. ✦

Argentina, UK
eye Falklands oil

T

he Falkland Islands are in the
news again, a matter of interest
to the oil and gas industry given the
reserves under the region’s waters,
estimated at 18 billion bbl.
Last week, the Argentine foreign
ministry presented the UN with 40
volumes of documentation staking
the country’s claim to 1.7 million sq
km of seabed, including the UK overseas territories of the Falklands, South
Georgia, and South Sandwich Islands,
and a largish chunk of Antarctica.
Argentina’s claim, submitted under
Article 76 of the 1994 UN Convention
on the Law of the Sea, aims to expand
its maritime territory by 35% to 370
nautical miles from the shore on the
basis of a claimed extension of the
Argentine continental shelf.
According to Buenos Aires, the
submission represents the culmination of 11 years of research and 12
maritime expeditions. But a skeptical
UK Foreign Office said it will present
a counter-claim by the UN’s May 13
deadline.

On the attack
Meanwhile, members of the British press are doing their level best to
scotch the Argentinean claims.
“Sneaky Argentina is trying to
grab the Falklands back from Britain
to steal the oil-rich seabed around
the islands,” writes a columnist for
the UK’s Express Newspapers.
“The Argies are begging the UN
to help them in their political bid,”
he said, adding that “Argentina were
sent packing from the British islands
in 1982 after first invading South
Georgia.”
The jingoism is apparent when
we are reminded “Prime Minister
50

Maggie Thatcher’s Task Force defeated
their forces and kicked them out.”
The columnist has no problem
dismissing new claims by the Argentinean government, which says “12
years of research proves their continental shelf in Antarctica goes 150
miles beyond the 200-mile limit.”
The writer also has no trouble
summing up the evident greed of
the Argentine government saying its
demands “would increase the area
of South Atlantic they own by up to
three times the size of France—taking all 778 islands.”

Argentina dismissed
Worse, he says, “the Argies want
Britain’s South Georgia and South
Sandwich Islands—an area of ocean
rich with oil.” Still, the Latin American country is probably not going to
prevail as “British Embassy authorities in Buenos Aires vowed to block
any moves by Argentina.”
The column even cited a British
Embassy spokesman who said: “We
do not accept that there is any basis
for the Argentine submission.”
Of course the British don’t accept
the Argentinean claim. After all, that’s
why they will submit a counter-claim
by May 13.
And what will that do?
Well, under UN laws, submission
of the counter-claim would prevent
either nation from exploiting the
contested seabed until a diplomatic
agreement is reached.
Given the drawn-out nature of the
UN’s territorial resolutions, the UK’s
counter-claim would spell the end
of any drilling activity in the area for
the foreseeable future.
Game, set, and match. ✦

however, offered a somewhat contrarian
viewpoint. Price is not the key issue, he
said. In summer 2008, when US prices
were $8-13/MMbtu, no LNG cargoes
arrived at US terminals. In 2009, with
US prices near $3.50/MMbtu, “lots of
cargoes” are arriving or en route to the
US.

Competition
A panel discussion of fuel alternatives to natural gas and LNG not
surprisingly found formidable problems
with major renewables—wind and
solar—as well as with coal and nuclear.
This discussion was conducted with
repeated reference to the policies of US
President Barack Obama’s administration and likely climate change legislation currently being debated in the
US Congress. All panelists agreed that
whatever legislation made it into law
would favor renewables.
Repsol Energy North America’s
Pres. Phil Ribbeck reminded attendees
that natural gas should be viewed as
complementary to renewables, not in
competition, as the nation moves away
from a carbon-intensive economy.
Addressing the major fuel with
which natural gas completes—coal—
Ribbeck said current prices in the East
have already forced the equivalent of
1.7 bcfd of coal out of markets there.
“The breakeven price for coal is above
$4/MMbtu,” he said.
Poten & Partners’ Fisoye Delano, who
chaired the discussion, was skeptical
about the reputed benefits of nuclear
power, noting its huge costs not only to
build but also to operate. ✦

2009.

Blocks and ﬁelds
Detail is sparse on previous Soviet
exploration in the Afghan oil and gas
fields.
The Jangalikolon block is the largest at 493,952 acres, Juma-Bashikurd
covers 459,853 acres, and Kashkari is
425,753 acres.
The ministry estimated that Jangalikolon has 671 bcf of recoverable gas,
Juma-Bashikurd 1.2 tcf, and Kashkari
64.4 million bbl of oil. It also estimated
143.8 million bbl of possible reserves
in Kashkari.

Most of Afghanistan’s producing
reservoirs are of Cretaceous and Jurassic
age, and the bulk of the gas is sour and
resides in the Jurassic.
The ministry said the Soviets drilled
four wells and started but did not complete another five wells at Jangalikolon,
35 km north of Sheberghan. Well No. 4
went to TD 4,222 m in Upper Jurassic
sandstone and tested 35 MMcfd of sour
gas at 600 atm bottomhole pressure
from a 20-m perforated interval. The
gas was 0.035% hydrogen sulfide.
Field size is 7 by 13 km.
The ministry said Juma-Bashikurd
field, 25 km northwest of Sheberghan,
covers 36 sq km and has seven wells.
The ministry said Angot field, 12 km
south of Sari Pol, has produced from
four of 10 wells drilled. The field produced an unknown volume for about 6
months in 1988-89, and the produced
oil was trucked to Kabul and used to
heat water. The reservoir is a Hauterivian limestone at 1,800-1,950 m, and the
block contains several smaller oil fields.

Meanwhile, Peruvian officials said an
auction for an additional 12 lots for oil
and gas will be held in July.
“I’d like to take this opportunity...to
announce the start of the 2009 selection process, which will officially begin
in July and include 12 or 13 lots that
may contain petroleum,” said Perupetro
Pres. Daniel Saba.

The auction will be Peru’s first since
last year, when several top government
officials were fired or forced to resign
after being accused of steering concessions to favored bidders.
At the time, Peru’s former mines and
energy minister, Juan Valdivia, resigned,
while Perupetro board member Alberto
Quimper and Perupetro Pres. Cesar
Gutierrez were fired.
The scandal was exposed when an
audio tape surfaced on an investigative
television news show that included a
conversation between Quimper and
Romulo Leon, a prominent member of
President Garcia’s APRA party, in which
they apparently agreed to favor Discover
Petroleum of Norway in a round of
energy auctions.
The Norwegian company, which
partnered with Petroperu, was later
awarded five blocks: four of them off
the country’s central Pacific coast and
the fifth onshore near Peru’s borders
with Brazil and Bolivia.
Peru’s justice ministry said it would
investigate the banking records of the
Peruvian executives and suspend the
contracts awarded to Discover. ✦

SPONSORED FEATURES

OFFSHORE ASSETS – HSE PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
CULTURE – THE KEY TO SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE
WHAT IS CULTURE?
Some companies wonder why they keep
experiencing the same process safety
problems. Others wonder why they seem
to have plateaued in health, safety and
environmental (HSE) performance.
Culture is KEY. It is the individual and
organizational “DNA” that represents our
tendency to want to do (1) the right thing in
(2) the right way at (3) the right time, (4) ALL
the time – even when if no one is looking.
The HSE culture that exists on an
offshore asset or in a company is the
result of all the actions - and inactions - in
institutional/workforce memory.
Many facilities use management
systems to help control risks of hazardous
processes. These management systems
are operated by people – people whose
inherent attitudes about safety can affect
the choices they make in operating these
systems and, thus, the overall safety
performance of the facility.

ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF A
GOOD CULTURE
Industry has established attributes of a
good process safety culture. Focusing on
these features allows a company to evaluate
existing safety culture and determine how
best to improve it.
1. Establish HSE as a core value
2. Provide strong leadership
3. Establish and enforce high standards of
performance
4. Formalize the HSE culture approach
5. Maintain a sense of vulnerability
6. Empower individuals to successfully
fulﬁll their HSE responsibilities
7. Defer to expertise
8. Ensure open and effective
communications
9. Establish a questioning/learning
environment
10. Foster mutual trust
11. Provide timely response to HSE issues
and concerns
12. Provide continuous monitoring of
performance
These essential features can be used to
both evaluate HSE culture and used as a

point of comparison for HSE performance
outcomes.

HOW TO EVALUATE CULTURE
Process safety and HSE are hard to measure
and more difﬁcult to change. There are
few direct indicators of process safety and
HSE culture, and because of its nature,
it cannot be evaluated very frequently.

• Mapping these results to the 12 culture
features
• Addressing technical, management
system and underlying cultural issues
to create sustainable, improved process
safety performance
Companies can perform a PAR at a
single facility, but the results will be more
robust if the evaluation is done at multiple

In 2007, the Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS) published its next generation
process safety management (PSM) system called Risk Based Process Safety (RBPS).
The RBPS framework has 20 elements grouped into four accident prevention pillars
and is being applied to HSE for offshore assets.

Learn from Experience
• Incident Investigation
• Measurement and Metrics
• Auditing
• Management Review and Continuous
Improvement

Learning from all process safety sources of experience is vital for sustainable process
safety performance and continuous improvement. Plus, we need to expand our
sources of learning to those available outside our plant, company, and even industry
because we cannot “afford” to learn only learn from our own mistakes. We cannot
learn quickly enough using only our own mistakes and incidents.
Typical ways to get a handle on process
safety and HSE culture are:
• Employee surveys
• Interviews
• Work observations
• HSE leading indicator metrics
Based on lessons from conducting the
Baker Panel evaluation, we have devised
a formal approach for connecting process
safety and HSE performance outcomes
to culture. This performance assurance
review (PAR) approach consists of the
following steps at a facility:
• Developing a current “HSE
performance picture” and assessing the
“historical performance movie”
• Understanding employee opinions about
safety culture issues

representative facilities, business divisions,
and corporate ofﬁces.

PATH FORWARD
Some predict that future major incidents
will all have poor HSE culture as a
contributing factor. Culture will be the
“root cause” of the next decade. Industry

organizational and culture causes of major

Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition
July 14 – 16, 2009
Calgary TELUS Convention Centre, Calgary, Alberta, Canada

REGISTER TODAY!

Oil for tomorrow
THE PROMISE. THE PRACTICE.
Technologies developed for the oil sands and heavy oil resources of Alberta are vital to more than tomorrow’s oil supply.
They represent solutions to problems encountered throughout the oil industry.
Problems like managing costs during periods of lower oil prices, dealing with labor shortages, handling sulfur, controlling
air emissions, producing oil under difficult conditions, mitigating surface impacts, recycling produced water, capturing and
sequestering carbon dioxide, and more.
While it finds solutions to these challenges, the oil sands and heavy oil industry continues to develop unconventional
resources that are critical to meeting the world’s long-term needs for reliable hydrocarbon supplies.
Continued progress in oil sands and heavy oil producing technologies means progress in ensuring a dependable supply of
petroleum products at a time when traditional recovery methods are strained by additional demand from rapidly developing
industrial nations.
The Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition is the premier forum for the people who make this
innovation and progress possible.
Don’t miss this opportunity to present your product or service to a powerful, influential audience. Join the Oil & Gas
Journal and our conference attendees in Calgary this summer for the third annual Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies
Conference and Exhibition.

TFO description

This screen shows the type of information available from the BPTT optimizer interface (TFOI) that acts
as the human interface between the optimizer end users and the linked simulation model and databases
(Fig. 2).
changes that affect normal operating
conditions.
BPTT formed a production optimization team (POT) 3 years ago primarily to manage daily optimization. The
team requests inputs from petroleum
engineers from each processing hub,
gas dispatch team, and market representatives in a daily forum.
The inputs include installed platform capacity (IPC) data, schedules for
planned downtimes for both offshore,
market activities, and production adding opportunities. By carefully analyzing the data inputs, the team reschedules events affecting production to
ensure that BPTT met market demand
for any specific day.
BPTT emphasizes maximizing revenues by producing wells with greater
condensate to gas ratios. From this,
BPTT developed a well priority shut-in
list to manage all wells. This list advises
operators on which wells to open and
close to maintain integrity and maximize crude and condensate production.

62

The petroleum engineers update the
list monthly. Once the personnel reach
agreement on the new work schedule
and supply profiles, the gas dispatch
team works with the well priority shutin list as a guide to supply demand.
The tedious work flow between the
POT, asset engineers, and gas dispatchers requires constant communication to
develop a solution to different scenarios. The implementation of the TFO tool
simplifies the process for certain issues.
It was equally important to integrate
the needs of the shareholders to ensure
that the tool is robust so that it satisfies
the scenario requests with respect to
system optimization.
BPTT’s implementation of the TFO
tool required the collaboration of the
following technologies:3 4
• Fast running modeling and simulation tools.
• Fast running optimization tools.
• Digitally enabled metering systems.
• Communication systems.
• Real-time databases, process historians.

The TFO is a model-based off-line
advisory system that uses historical process data and an ad-hoc HYSYS steadystate model to find the values of key
process variables that render an optimum production situation that typically
leads to meeting a certain gas nomination while maximizing the condensate
recovery.
TFO has the following software
components (Fig. 1):
• Library of well models—PROSPER
from Petroleum Experts Ltd.
• Steady-state field model and
optimizer—Aspen HYSYS from Aspen
Technology Inc. (TFO model—TFOM).
• Excel executive work-flow managing application (TFO interface—TFOI).
• Data historian—PI from OSI Software Inc.
• MIRS production database—BPTT
proprietary implementation.
TFOI acts as the human interface
between the optimizer end users and
the linked simulation model and databases (Fig. 2). It handles the data traffic
between the various system components and, among others, performs the
following actions:
• Sensitivity analysis of the individual well models to generate a parametric characterization of the wellhead
pressure-flow behavior.
• Retrieval and validation of field
data
• Field-model validation against field
data including comparison of snapshot
model predictions with historic process
data.
• Field-model calibration to match
actual process conditions.
• Configuration of specific optimization scenarios.
• Presentation of results in terms of
potential extra revenues and required
actions to achieve them.

off-line studies because it is calibrated
already against field data.
A key element of the design of field
optimizers such as TFO is the ability
automatically to activate and deactivate
blocks and subsystems. A gas asset such
as BPTT is a continuous moving target
(Fig. 4). Wells and platforms are shut
down and brought on line regularly
for such reasons as controlling and
adjusting gas productions to demand,
performing well tests, and fixing flowassurance problems.
An optimizer that is unable automatically to detect and react to this dynamic
nature of the asset has little value.
The TFOM:
• Allows switching from a validation-calibration mode to optimization
mode with a simple flag change.
• Allows activating-deactivating
wells, platforms, pipelines, and separation trains through on-off status
indicators, with some of them directly
retrieved from data historians.
The model has a robustness consid64

erably higher than a standard process
simulation typically requires. The
model must protect individual pieces of
equipment against unfeasible operating regions or provide extrapolation
mechanisms to avoid model failures
during optimization.
The small inefficiencies and short
cuts that will never manifest in a standard simulation model tend to pop up
quickly when the optimization engine
controls the model.
Some areas that need special attention during construction of the model
include:
• Avoiding recycle loops whenever
possible. These loops solved in an iterative manner in sequential modular flow
sheets are a sink of simulation time and
a source of noise.
• Allowing the configuration of
certain unit operation blocks in different ways. The preference is for direct
calculations instead of iterative loops
inside individual units. These loops

are converged as part of the optimizer
problem configuration.

TFOI
The Excel-based executive TFO application (TFOI) handles the connectivity of the model with the required data
sources and with the library of validated
PROSPER well models, which production and allocation engineers typically
update. TFO uses a centralized OSI PI
server that receives real-time data from
the various Honeywell Uniformance
PHD servers installed in each platform
or terminal.
The PI server also receives cumulative production data from the BPTT
proprietary MIRS production database.
TFOI performs the following functions:
• Data retrieval from the PI server.
This includes well data such as well
status, wellhead pressure, and choke
opening. Also included are plant data
such as platform separator pressures,
gas and condensate pipeline pressures

and flow rates, platform daily productions, redelivery points flow rates (at
Altantic, NGC, Atlas, Picton, etc.). Other
gas and crude oil plant process variables
retrieved include separator pressures
and temperatures, and stabilization
columns flow rates.
• Gross error detection of bad PI
readings and option for the users to
validate and correct individual data
pieces.
• Sensitivity analysis of PROSPER
well models including generation of
wellhead parametric models, supplied
to the HYSYS field model as a way of
characterizing well behavior, such as
flow rate, as a function of wellhead
pressure. In addition, it compares the
latest well test data with PROSPER model predictions and tunes the PROSPER
models to best match well test data.
• Model validation and calibration
for comparing field data with model
predictions and reporting deviations as
a means of deciding the need for model
calibration. Execution of TFOM in parameter estimation mode minimizes the
differences between model predictions
and the corresponding field data. The
scope of the parameter estimation mode
includes gas and liquid pipelines pressure drops, platform productions, gas
calorific values in gas delivery points,
condensate quality indicators (rvp, and
water content), separator temperature
differences, and overall asset gas balance
(gas produced vs. gas sold).
• Configuration of the optimization problem includes selecting decision variables and their minimum and
maximum bounds, including swing and
fixed wells. The process also allows editing maximum and minimum bounds of
system constraints such as separator gas
rates and allowed platform productions.
In addition, one can specify the commercial targets that typically consist of a
certain gas nomination value for the day
as well as the gas and condensate prices
for the various revenue streams.

The process also requires specifying the optimization problem to solve
by selecting among a list of possible
business situations such as meeting gas
nominations and maximizing condensates production, operation revenue,
and capacity utilization.
• Reporting optimization results
that are in the form of detailed optimizer output sheets including decision
variable values, constraints status, and
objective function value; and optimizer
executive summary sheets that highlight
well ranking (before and after optimization), gas and condensate productions
(before and after optimization). ✦

FOURTH QUARTER 2008
FIRST QUARTER 2009

Weather is always an important
influence on propane supply-demand
trends during the winter heating season, but the financial crisis and ensuing
economic recession had substantial and
overriding impact on supply-demand
trends during winter 2008-09.
Late last year, we highlighted the
impact of Gustav and Ike on gas plants,
refineries, and petrochemical plants

(OGJ, Nov. 3, 2008, p. 54). We did not
know in fall 2008 that the financial
crisis would dwarf Gustav and Ike as the
most important influence on supplydemand trends for the winter heating
season 2008-09. Furthermore, the
financial crisis pushed a normal crude
oil price correction in July into hypercollapse during the fourth quarter.
This collapse prompted OPEC producers (Saudi Arabia in particular) to
make major cuts in crude production.
Production cuts in Saudi Arabia reduced
associated-gas production and gas plant
propane-butane recovery volumes.
As the international propane supplydemand balance tightened, waterborne
imports into the US became much
more expensive.
At the end of September, the US had
a propane inventory deficit of more
than 10 million bbl relative to 2006.
Despite this deficit and strong retail
demand, inventory levels ended the

Propane feedstock demand is an important balancing element for
the overall propane market in North America. When colder weather
pushes sales and consumption in the retail markets steadily higher,
ethylene producers in the Gulf Coast have substantial capability to
reduce their consumption and effectively offset some or all of the
impact of a colder than normal winter. Historically most of the seasonal
decline in ethylene feedstock demand has occurred during fourth quarter. Frequently, feedstock demand for propane rebounds during ﬁrst

winter heating season with a year-toyear gain of about 8 million bbl. The
sharp decline in feedstock demand
was the major factor that catalyzed the
swing of 18 million bbl in inventory
levels relative to 2006.

Feedstock demand
During fourth-quarter 2008, feedstock demand for propane declined by
118,000 b/d vs. consumption during third-quarter 2008 and averaged
only 194,000 b/d. While a decline in
feedstock demand in the fourth quarter
is consistent with seasonal patterns, the
decline in 2008 was double the typical
decline of 50,000-70,000 b/d. Feedstock demand during fourth-quarter
2008 was 9.7 million bbl less than
during fourth-quarter 2007. Propane’s
share of fresh feed averaged 14.9%
during fourth-quarter 2008 vs. 21.9%
during third-quarter 2008 and 17.8%
during fourth-quarter 2007.
From a low point of 130,000 b/d
in December 2008, feedstock demand
for propane rebounded in first-quarter
2009. Demand averaged 165,000175,000 b/d in January and 225,000235,000 b/d in February. For full firstquarter 2009, we estimate that demand

2009 compared with those for thirdquarter 2008. Propane recovery, however, remained very profitable. In most
regions, propane recovery margins were
double the prevailing levels of 2003-05.
For refineries, economic incentives
to move propane into the merchant
market also remained strong. Propane
prices averaged $8.00-8.75/MMbtu,
or $3-5/MMbtu higher than natural
gas prices during fourth-quarter 2008.
Refineries had no incentive to burn
propane instead of natural gas during
the winter heating season. Refineries
in the upper Texas Coast, however, did
not fully recover from hurricane-related
downtime until late in fourth-quarter
2008. This factor limited refinery propane supply.

Inventories of purity propane fell to
a seasonal low of 1.1-1.3 million bbl at
the end of March 2008. Purity propane
inventories in Canada were 2.0 million

Regional inventory trends
Propane inventory in primary storage in US Petroleum Administration
for Defense District (PADD) II peaked
during the second week of October
2008 and totaled 25.3 million bbl, or
1.7 million bbl more than peak inventory in 2007 and 1.3 million bbl higher
than the average for 2002-06. By the
end of February 2009, inventory in
primary storage in PADD II declined to
12.5 million bbl and was 3.3 million
bbl lower than the 5-year average.
During March 2009, however, EIA’s
weekly reports indicate that inventories in PADD II increased by 300,000500,000 bbl and ended the winter
heating season at about 13.0 million
bbl, or about 2 million bbl higher than
the 5-year average.
Propane inventory in primary storage in PADD III (excluding nonfuel
propylene) reached its peak during the
first week of December 2008 (about
2 months later than in PADD II) and
totaled 29.7 million bbl, or 1 million
bbl more than the peak inventory level
of 2008. The record high inventory for
PADD III for the first week of December
was 36.6 million bbl (December 2005).
By the end of January 2009, inventory in primary storage in PADD III
declined to 24.1 million bbl, or 7 million bbl higher than in 2008. Withdrawals of inventory remained at typical
levels during February and March,
and inventories fell to a seasonal low
of 17.0-17.5 million bbl at the end of
March 2009—a year-to-year increase of
5.0-5.5 million bbl.

Pricing, economics
Although the hypercollapse in crude

oil prices was the dominant influence
on propane price trends, ethylene feedstock parity values and unusually weak
feedstock demand were the dominant
influence on propane price relationships vs. other NGLs during fourthquarter 2008.
At the beginning of the heating
season, propane prices in Mont Belvieu

ene feedstock demand reinforced the
generally bearish impact of the collapse in West Texas Intermediate prices
on propane prices as well as prices for
other ethylene feedstocks during third
and fourth quarters 2008.
The decline in WTI prices accelerated
during November and December 2008.
Propane prices fell more sharply than

September 2008.
For third-quarter 2008, propane

average temperatures and the surge in
propane transfers from Mont Belvieu

WTI. Average postings in the Northeast,
however, jumped to 87-88¢/gal in
January. In view of the 8¢/gal pipeline
tariff from Mont Belvieu to Selkirk, NY,
prices in Mont Belvieu could have been
even higher in January, but weak feedstock demand counterbalanced strong
demand in the Northeast retail heating
market.
In February 2008, supply concerns
in the Northeast retail markets began to

abate. As a result, spot prices in Mont
Belvieu declined by 7.2¢/gal and the
propane-WTI price ratio declined to
70.2%. An overdue rally in WTI prices
began in late February and extended
through the end of March. Despite the
rally in crude oil prices, spot propane
prices in Mont Belvieu averaged only
65¢/gal in March and were equal to
57.8% of WTI.

Spring, summer prices
We view the crude oil price rally
during February-March 2009 to be an
overdue correction. As a result, WTI
prices will average $45-55/bbl during
second and third quarters 2009. Spot
ethane prices, however, are likely to remain relatively weak and will continue
to undermine propane’s value in at least
40% of the ethylene feedstock market.
Spot propane prices in Mont Belvieu
will weaken during second quarter and
will average 62-64¢/gal. Prices will remain in this range during third-quarter
2009. Feedstock parity values vs. ethane
will decline to 52-55¢/gal during second and third quarters 2009. Feedstock
parity values vs. light naphthas will
average 65-75¢/gal during second and
third quarters 2009.
The economic incentive to crack
propane rather than light naphthas
will average 4-8¢/gal. The disincentive to crack propane relative to ethane,
however, will average 8-10¢/gal. The
propane-WTI ratio will average 56-60%
during second and third quarters
2009. ✦

Background
All states have some form of one-call
system excavators and the operators of
buried facilities can use to avoid excavation damage. These systems provide a
centralized communications platform
connecting excavators with the operators of buried facilities in the planned
excavation area. State and federal laws
and regulations codify
the requirements
governing
these sysOffshore Petroleum Operations
tems. While
these systems have
proven
their worth
in preventing excavation damage and
incidents,
until recently a notification system addressing offshore excavation activities
has not been available.
In February 2009 GulfSafe LLC, Dallas, a wholly owned subsidiary of Texas
Excavation Safety System Inc. (TESS),
started a web site addressing offshore
damage prevention and notification
with the goal of eliminating preventable

damage to subsurface infrastructure
in the Gulf of Mexico and Straits of
Florida. TESS operates one of the largest
one-call centers in the US, processing
more than 2 million incoming notifications/year, and has more than 20 years
of notification system experience.
RCP Inc., Houston, provided appropriate GIS datasets for development of
the Gulf of Mexico one-call notification
system. This article discusses how the
databases were acquired and prepared
for implementation into GulfSafe’s
system and describes how the system
functions.

Increasingly crowded
America’s critical infrastructure,
including energy and communication
systems, is expanding offshore, with
the Gulf of Mexico one of the most active locations. Innovative technology is
required to address the potential threats
from this rapid development. Protection
of this crucial energy source is a matter
of economic and national security.
The roughly 43 million leased OCS
acres in the Gulf of Mexico account for
about 15% of US domestic natural gas
production and 27% of domestic oil
production.1 More than 33,000 miles
of pipelines crisscross the bottom of
the gulf, connecting more than 4,000
platforms to the coast.2 These production platforms range in size from single
well caissons in 10-ft water depths to
large complex facilities in water depths
greater than 7,000 ft.3
Leases for wind farms and wind-produced electrical energy are under development in the shallow waters of the
gulf. The first wind farm agreement in
the GOM with the Texas General Land
Office and wind developer GalvestonOffshore Wind LLC to construct a wind
farm about 7 miles off Galveston Island
was signed in October 2005.4 Leases
will likely expand into deeper waters.
StatoilHydro recently allocated 400
million NOK ($78 million) to floating

Texas has 16 gulf-front counties, and
a plethora of information was available
from the TRRC and Texas Land Office
for building the databases. Louisiana
accounts for about 90% of the nation’s
offshore oil and gas production and
has land and water interstate gas and
liquid pipelines totaling 32,514 miles
and intrastate pipelines totaling 11,267
miles.7
Mississippi has three counties, Hancock, Harrison, and Jackson, bordering
the gulf. The state’s oil and gas board
has stated no oil and gas production or
pipelines requiring permitting are allowed in near-shore waters, but several
OCS pipelines come ashore in Mississippi. The state has since delegated
oil and gas activity to the Mississippi
Development Authority.
Alabama has two counties, Mobile
and Baldwin, bordering the gulf. NPMS
says ExxonMobil, Shell, Legacy, and others own the offshore assets that include
9,424 miles of onshore and offshore

hazardous liquid, gas transmission, and
gas gathering pipelines. Alabama’s oil
and gas board said these pipeline data
were proprietary.
Florida has 13 counties adjacent to
the Gulf of Mexico with only one offshore pipeline so far entering the state
landing in Manatee County. Owned by
Gulfstream Natural Gas System LLC, the
line connects south Alabama to Tampa
Bay, Fla., covering 419 offshore miles.
No oil and gas wells exist in Florida’s
state waters and all oil and gas leases
have been purchased by the state.

Standardizing data
Checking acquired data ensured
consistency and accuracy. Sources often
provided data in multiple tables that
were combined into one. Importing
the resulting files into Environmental
Systems Research Institute Inc’s. (ESRI)
ArcInfo as coverage files and converting
them into shape files, allowed them to
be viewed and checked in GIS.

Tables with X and Y coordinates were
standardized and screened for corrupt
data. Data with errors that could not
be corrected were eliminated. Converting X and Y coordinates into decimal
degrees and storing them in numeric
fields with Y data (longitude) changed
to negative values allowed importing
the data into GIS as an event layer on a
map. Viewing finished data projected
and defined in the proper geographic
coordinate system on the map provided
additional quality control.
Placing all data into a geodatabase
format created a base map of the Gulf
of Mexico with layers designed to be
easily turned on and off in the table of
contents. Layers linked the path to the
data within the geodatabase and provided labeling and symbology information.
A contracted commercial source
provided pipeline, platform, and interconnect information for the system,
updated every 6 months. When database

Flowmeter comes in high temperature version
The Steel-Trak Model 640S immersible
thermal mass flowmeter now comes in a
special high-temperature option capable
of trouble-free operation
in process temperatures as
high as 750° F.
Suited for uses in petrochemical plant operations and constructed of
heavy-duty 316 stainless
steel wetted materials, this
high-temperature version
includes remote-mounted
electronics and mineralinsulated cabling.
The maker says the
instrument promises accuracy, easy installation, and
low maintenance in an
explosionproof package.
Featuring direct gas mass flow measurement, units use the firm’s patented
Dry-Sense technology for drift-free performance. The meter also features the Smart

Interface package for field programming
and meter validation and diagnostics.
All meters are calibrated to customer
specifications at this company’s calibration
laboratories and are directly traceable to
NIST and compliant to ANSI/NCSL Z540
and MIL-STD-45662A and certified to ISO
9001 standards.
The company’s Steel-Mass Model 640S
is hazardous area approved by CSA and
CRN (Canada), FM (US), ATEX, CE and
PED (EU), IEC Ex (Australia), and Chinese
Pattern Approval (China). Meter accuracy
is ±1% of reading plus ±0.5% of full scale
with repeatability of ±0.2% of full scale.
The 3⁄4 in. diameter sensor probe inserts
easily into ducts and pipes up to 72 in. in
size and is offered with a range of process
connections (including hot tap). Probes
may easily be removed for cleaning or the
optional built-in purge cleaning system
(using external high pressure air) may be
used.

New chemical cost performance program
Newly launched SafeSpend is an oil
field production chemical cost performance program.
It gives operators the option to work
with the source shown below to review
and personalize their account for maximum cost effectiveness.
SafeSpend reflects the commitment to
flexible pricing incentives that can include
tiered discounts, rebates, early pay discounts, and price protection indexing to
customize each chemical program.
SafeSpend is also designed to help operators maintain more predictable operating
costs by approaching chemicals in terms
of the cost per barrel of production instead
of the cost per gallon of chemical and by
adapting chemical programs to changes in
production needs.

Shock in Canada:
Alberta not worst
on environment
In Canada, calling Alberta green—even
brownish green—can cause a ruckus.
As home to the huge and important oil
sands industry, Alberta faces big environmental problems: requirements for water
and energy, emissions of air pollution and
greenhouse gases, surface disturbance, and
the need to handle wastewater and other
byproducts, to name a few.
Alberta also is Canada’s third largest

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

provincial economy and its leader in revenue per person. It thus contributes mightily
to a Canadian program for interprovincial
wealth-sharing.
As production of bitumen from Alberta’s
oil sands has grown, so has criticism—
mostly from other provinces—about the environmental consequences. Many Albertans
ﬁnd the scorn ungrateful.
Into this bubbling stew on Apr. 22
plopped a report ranking Alberta well above
bottom in provincial greenitude.
Corporate Knights, a quarterly magazine
published in Toronto, assigned Alberta sixth
position among 13 provinces and territories
in an environmental assessment. British
Columbia came in ﬁrst, followed by Ontario
and sparsely populated Northwest Territories, Yukon Territory, and Nunavut.
A Globe and Mail (Toronto) article
about the report drew contentious online
response.
“Pure malarky [sic],” declared one of 154
comments posted as of Apr. 24. Another:
“Ontario would deﬁnitely have come in ﬁrst
had it not been polluted by the presence of
Corporate Knights.”
Albertans had their say, too. “So Alberta
isn’t so bad after all,” wrote one. “Time for
all you bigots to apologize. While you’re
at it, you can also thank Alberta for all the
transfer payments that pay your welfare
checks.”
Corporate Knights came in for grave
suspicion for daring to suggest Alberta isn’t
Canada’s worst environmental nightmare.
The magazine in fact claims as part of its
mission “to humanize the marketplace” and
as a goal “to jumpstart Canada to become
the world leader in responsible commerce.”
That doesn’t sound sympathetic to
whatever impulses may lurk in Canadian
industry to bulldoze ﬁrst and ask why later.
Indeed, if the Globe and Mail comments accurately reﬂect the Canadian
mood, a stronger proclivity where Alberta
is concerned may be to bite the hand that
not only feeds but also invents solutions to
environmental problems.

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

Tax hike sends wrong signal
The push by consumer nations for lower oil prices to help spark an economic
recovery may be undermined when crude-producing nations see those governments take advantage of oil price reductions to ratchet up taxes on reﬁned products,
particularly in Europe.
Changes in the UK’s taxation policy indicate the producers have grounds for
such suspicions, said Paul Horsnell, a managing director and head of commodities
research at Barclays Capital in London. “Last November, the duty on gasoline in the
UK stood at 50.35 pence/l. Changes in December and earlier this month brought it up
to 54.19 pence/l. as of [Apr. 19], which at current exchange rates is the equivalent of
$125/bbl [of gasoline] or $153/bbl including the indirect tax element of retail prices.”
Prior to the latest increase, he said, “Taxation already made up 73% of the average UK retail gasoline price, which is the equivalent of $4.80/gal.”
Moreover, the UK budget statement on Apr. 22 announced “a further increase of
2 pence/l. to be made in September, plus an additional penny per liter above inﬂation in April for the next 4 years,” Horsnell reported. “In just 10 months starting last
November, the UK will have increased fuel duty by 5.84 pence/l., the equivalent of
$13.50/bbl, with changes in indirect taxation bringing the overall increase in the tax
take to at least $11/bbl.”
Horsnell said, “Given that this rapid ramping up of the direct tax element (by
11.6% in just 10 months) had previously been stalled by high prices, producers might
be forgiven for seeing this as an extra $10/bbl or so that has gone into consumer
tax revenue simply because prices are lower. With European governments signaling
that retail prices will be kept high regardless of the level of crude prices, it also gives
producers an impetus to want to get $20/bbl or so back on the upstream price relatively quickly, before that amount is expropriated instead by European governments
through downstream taxation.” Overall, he said, “It appears to us that producerconsumer relations are deteriorating again, with some old wounds being reopened.
Through opportunistic taxation policies, in our view, European governments in
particular are pushing producers into a more hawkish stand on prices.”
On Apr. 23 in London, the June IPE contract for North Sea Brent crude gained 30¢
to $50.11/bbl, selling at a premium over the June contract for benchmark US light,
sweet crudes that closed at $49.62/bbl on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Flu affects energy market
After climbing more than 12% in a 4-day rally through Apr. 24 in the New York
market, crude prices were down in early trading Apr. 27 amid concerns that the
swine ﬂu outbreak will further reduce air travel.
In Houston, however, analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc. reported, “The US has already declared a public health emergency, and the
European Union’s health commissioner recently advised against any nonessential
travel to the US and Mexico. Regardless of a potential decrease in air travel, crude
stockpiles are at their highest level since 1990, and speculators are net-short oil for
the ﬁrst time in 6 weeks.”
‘Coal ﬂoor’ slips
With the supply cost curve falling and inventories increasing, the coal price
“ﬂoor” for natural gas may not provide much protection for gas producers, said
Adam Sieminski, chief energy economist, Deutsche Bank, Washington, DC.
The switch to gas from coal among customers able to do so has been concentrated on the US East Coast, “where coal prices are substantially higher than in the West
and gas prices are more marginally so,” Sieminski said.
Citing a recent report by Wood Mackenzie Ltd., a former Deutsche Bank subsidiary, Sieminski said, “While break-even costs on these gas plays are high, cash costs
are very low—less than $1/MMbtu in almost every play.” With coal mining costs running much higher, he said, “Coal shut-ins are much more likely, meaning those costs
will set both base case coal and gas prices.” Sustained gas prices of $3.50-4/MMbtu
will cause a drop in North American gas drilling “beyond what we have seen to
date,” Sieminski said. “But rig lay-downs do not ﬁlter through to production declines
for 3-6 months, so they do not provide short-term price support.”
According to the WoodMac study, there is some risk that the entire coal supply
curve could fall as materials costs decline due to weaker worldwide demand. “There
may be a coal ﬂoor,” Sieminski said, “but in our view, it is too low to do gas producers much good.”

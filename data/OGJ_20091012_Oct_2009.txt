In troubled times fierce global
competition for premium crudes
means that refinery units must
have the flexibility to handle
heavy, viscous, dirty crudes that
increasingly threaten to dominate
markets. And flexibility must
extend to products as well as
crudes, for refinery product
demand has become more and
more subject to violent economic
and political swings. Thus refiners must have the greatest flexibility in determining yields of
naphtha, jet fuel, diesel and vacuum gas oil products.

Why Do Many
Crude/Vacuum
Units Perform
Poorly?
In many cases it’s because the
original design was based more
on virtual than actual reality.
There is no question: computer
simulations have a key role
to play but it’s equally true
that process design needs to be
based on what works in the field
and not on the ideals of the
process simulator. Nor should the
designer simply base the equipment selection on vendor-stated
performance. The design engineer needs to have actual refinery
process engineering experience,
not just expertise in office-based

modeling. Refinery hands-on
experience teaches that fouling,
corrosion, asphaltene precipitation, crude variability, and crude
thermal instability, and many
other non-ideals are the reality.
Theoretical outputs of process or
equipment models are not. In this
era of slick colorful PowerPoint®
presentations by well-spoken
engineers in Saville Row suits,
it’s no wonder that units don’t
work. Shouldn’t engineers wearing Nomex® coveralls who have
worked with operators and taken
field measurements be accorded
greater credibility?
Today more than ever before this
is important. Gone are the days
when a refiner could rely on
uninterrupted supplies of light,
sweet, easy-to-process crudes.

USA

Rather than a single point process
model, the crude/vacuum unit
design must provide continuous
flexibility to operate reliably over
long periods of time. Simply
meeting the process guarantee 90
days after start-up is very different than having a unit still operating well after 5 years. Sadly few
refiners actually achieve this—no
matter all the slick presentations
by engineers in business suits!

in technical detail ask for
Technical Papers 267 and 268.

COVER
In 2003,Valero Energy Corp. installed this 50,000-b/d gasoline
hydrotreater, designed and built by CB&I, Houston, at its Port
Arthur,Tex., refinery to produce low-sulfur gasoline, as required by
US Environmental Protection Agency’s Tier II regulations.The most
recent expansions of the crude and vacuum units have increased the
refinery’s ability to process lower-cost, heavy sour crude oil and
increased total throughput capacity to 310,000 b/d. For more
on current refinery-sulfur issues and operations, see Oil & Gas
Journal’s exclusive special report that begins on p. 44. Photo from

Shell settles EPA chemical reporting allegation
Shell Guam Inc. agreed to pay $30,590 to settle charges that it
violated a federal environmental law by not submitting required
toxic chemical reports, the US Environmental Protection Agency
said on Oct. 5.
The Royal Dutch Shell PLC subsidiary agreed to pay a $7,950
fine as part of the settlement, and to donate $28,300 to the US
territory’s fire department for personal protective equipment, EPA
said.
EPA said Shell Guam regularly uses polycylic aromatic compounds, naphthalene, and other toxic chemicals as components of
fuel that it repackages at its facility. The company allegedly failed
to submit toxic release inventory reports to EPA of the amounts of
chemicals it processed in 2007, as required under the Emergency
Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act.
Facilities that process more than 25,000 lb/year of the chemicals cited in this case must report releases of these chemicals annually to EPA and the state or territory in which the plant is located, the federal environmental regulator said.
EPA said it compiles toxic chemical information annually from
the previous year to produce a publicly available toxics release inventory. It said this database estimates the amounts of each toxic
chemical released into the environment; treated or recycled onsite; or transferred off-site for waste management, and also provides a trend analysis of toxic chemical releases.

EPA said other violations of the federal Resource and Conservation Recovery Act that it found during a March inspection related to closing the pond and providing financial assurance for its
proper closure.
EPA sought nearly $7 million in fines from Frontier for operating an unauthorized hazardous waste unit.
The order also requires the refiner to take the pond out of
service, remove wastewater and sludge, determine whether the
wastes leak into groundwater or soils, remove the existing pond
structure and contaminated soils, and cap the area in accordance
with RCRA requirements for closing a surface impoundment, EPA
said.

Gazprom enters US gas trading, marketing market

Gazprom Marketing & Trading USA Inc. has begun trading and
marketing of natural gas, marking the US entry by a unit of Russia’s OAO Gazprom.
“We look forward to significant growth and profitability from
our expanding geographical base,” said Vitaly Vasiliev, chief executive officer of the UK’s Gazprom Marketing & Trading Ltd.
Gazprom’s US trading and marketing unit has acquired more
than 350 MMcfd of physical gas supplies at several sites across the
US for the next 3-7 years through long-term gas swaps.
The company also will market LNG exported to North America.
This includes long-term agreements enabling it to buy LNG from

BP reports Tebe oil discovery off Angola
A BP PLC subsidiary said test results show its Tebe oil discovery
on ultradeepwater Block 31 off Angola has the reservoir capacity
to flow more than 5,000 b/d “under production conditions.”
The well was drilled in 1,752 m of water to 3,325 m TD in
the southern portion of the block about 12 km southeast of the
October 2005 Hebe discovery and 350 km northwest of Luanda,
Angola’s capital and largest city.
Company officials said Oct. 1 it is BP’s 19th discovery on Block
31. BP Exploration (Angola) Ltd. is operator with 26.67% interest.
Sonangol is concessionaire of Block 31, with Sonangol P&P holding 20%.

Consortium officials said development of their deepwater Pluto, Saturn, Venus, and Mars oil fields in the northeast sector of
Block 31 is proceeding with first production targeted in 2012.

Maari field partners confirm additional reserves
The OMV-led joint venture at Maari oil field in the Taranaki
basin off New Zealand has confirmed additional produceable oil
reserves are contained within a separate reservoir, designated
M2A, about 50 m above the main Moki formation.
It lies in the main Maari mining licence PMP 38160.

The bottom of the barrel: on the road or in the tank?
Conventionally, heavy reﬁnery residues are used as asphalt pavement or combusted
as fuel oil in power plants. This represents a waste of valuable resources, on the one
hand, and causes serious pollution, on the other.
Lurgi has engineered processes to convert these reﬁnery heavies into synthetic gas.
This gas can in turn be used as a feedstock for petrochemical products or synthetic
fuels. Such designer fuels reduce the greenhouse effect and are free from benzene,
nitrogen and sulfur.
It is thus up to you to make more out of the increasingly scarce valuable oil reserves.
To your beneﬁt. And to that of our environment.

Waste no more time and resources.

The group has now completed a horizontal well into this reservoir that encountered 660 m of net pay zone. OMV estimates
the in-situ oil reserves to be 30-40 million bbl, or about a quarter
of the volume of the in-situ reserves figure placed on the Moki
formation reservoir.
However an estimate of recoverable reserves in the new zone
will not be available until production data from the M2A well has
been obtained and a development plan established.
The joint venture wants to produce from the M2A well only
intermittently when there is available spare capacity in the Maari
production facilities.
At the moment, the field’s five Moki production wells are producing at close to 40,000 b/d of oil, which is 10% more than the
35,000 b/d design capacity of the Raora floating production, storage, and offloading vessel now stationed in the field.
The field, which is New Zealand’s largest oil field, has produced
more than 3 million bbl since it came on stream in February.
OMV now plans to return to the Manaia-1 extended reach well,
which has targeted and found hydrocarbons within the Mangahewa sandstone in a structure about 10 km southwest of Maari
field. This well was suspended in mid-September so the M2A well
could be drilled at Maari. The plan is to reenter the well to drill a
horizontal section through the reservoir to determine the viability
of the find. The Ensco 7 jack up drilling rig is being used for the
program.
If Manaia is commercial, the production will be tied back to
the Maari facilities.
Manaia-1 is an appraisal of the Mangahewa Sand reservoir
found back in 1970 by the Shell-BP-Todd group with the Maui-4
vertical well which tested oil at 575 b/d, but was not commercial
at that time. The structure now lies in the greater Maari exploration licence PEP 38413.
OMV is operator of both licences with 69% interest. New Zealand’s Todd Energy has 16%, Sydney’s Horizon Oil has 10%, and
Cue Energy Resources, Melbourne, holds 5%.

Drilling

&

Eni Ghana Exploration & Production Ltd. will operate the Offshore Cape Three Points (OCTP) and Offshore Cape Three Points
South (OCTPS) exploration licenses in Ghana after acquiring a
major interest from Vitol Upstream Ghana Ltd.
Eni will hold a 47.22% interest in both blocks while Vitol will
take a 37.78% interest. State company Ghana National Petroleum
Corp., meanwhile, will hold 15%. GNPC will have a back-in option for an additional 5% in OCTP and 10% in OCTPS.
The consortium this summer drilled the Sankofa-1 well on
the OCTP block in 850 m of water. “The well encountered highquality reservoir sands containing 36 m (net) of oil and gas. Both
blocks lie in the prolific Tano-Cape Three Points oil basin, which
has recently yielded some of the biggest offshore discoveries yet
made in Africa,” said Eni. The Sankofa is a significant hydrocarbon discovery that is 35 km east of Jubilee field, which will start
production next year.
This deal marks the reentry of Eni in Ghana where it was present until the 1970s.
Eni has been present in Sub-Saharan Africa since the early
1960s. Its operated production in the area is 450,000 boe/d.

Southwestern Campos basin well finds oil
An exploratory well in the southwestern Campos basin has cut
an oil column of more than 100 m with about 40 m of highly
porous and permeable sandy reservoirs, said OGX Petroleo e Gas
Participacoes SA, Rio de Janeiro.
The 1-OGX-1-RJS well, in 140 m of water 85 km off Rio de
Janeiro in the BM-C-43 block, is still drilling toward deeper objectives using the Diamond Offshore Ocean Ambassador semisubmersible. OGX, which gave no depths or other details, holds 100%
interest in the block.
The block is southwest of Maromba oil field, which Petroleo
Brasileiro SA declared commercial in late 2006. ✦

Apache to tap Argentina unconventional gas
Argentina’s secretary of energy has approved the first contract
under an incentive program to encourage development of unconventional natural gas reservoirs.
Under the contract, Apache Corp., Houston, will drill as many
as 48 wells in two Neuquen basin fields in the next 4 years and
supply 50 MMcfd of gas at a price of $5/MMbtu. The contracts
take effect in January 2011, but the power plant customer has indicated it may begin taking gas in mid-2010.
The expected reserves would not be developed without Argentina’s Gas Plus program, said Jon Graham, president of Apache Argentina. Apache has submitted five more development projects in
the same basin with different geological parameters for approval
under Gas Plus.
At Anticlinal Campamento field in Neuquen Province, Apache
will drill as many as 12 wells to tap dry gas in Jurassic Pre-Cuyo
fractured volcanics and basement reservoirs as deep as 10,500 ft.
Apache describes the reservoirs as unconventional and said it will

apply multiple hydraulic fracs in the highly deviated lower part of
the wells.
Meanwhile, Apache will drill as many as 36 wells in Estacion
Fernandez Oro field in Rio Negro Province. These wells involve
drilling to 12,500 ft true vertical depth with as much as 20° of
deviation and conducting multiple fracs in tight Jurassic Lower
Lajas sandstone. Expected recovery is rich gas and 50° gravity condensate.
Apache will provide measurement and production facilities for
the Gas Plus volumes separate from the rest of the fields’ production facilities.
Apache produced 193 MMcfd of gas in Argentina at an average
$1.89/Mcf in the quarter ended June 30. That included sales to
regulated residential and power generation markets and deregulated industrial markets.
Regulators recently approved price increases in the residential
and power generation sectors, Apache said.

Oyong gas field off Indonesia comes on stream

SPE: Chemistry scoring index proposed

Santos Group’s Oyong natural gas field off Indonesia has been
brought on stream as part of the field’s Phase 2 development.
Gas is being transported from the field via a 60-km subsea
pipeline to an onshore processing plant at Grati in East Java.
Oyong lies in the Sampang production-sharing contract area in
the Straits of Madura and contains both oil and gas reserves in the
Mundu formation carbonate reservoir of Pliocene age.
Discovery well Oyong-1 was drilled in 2001 and Phase 1 oil
development began in September 2007.
Phase 2 has been to recover the field’s estimated 103 bcf of
gas reserves. Gas is contracted to PT Indonesia Power to use as an
electric power generation fuel under a deal signed in 2003.
Santos Ltd., Adelaide, is operator with 40%. Cue Energy Ltd.,
Melbourne, has 15% and Singapore Sampan has 40%.

A chemistry scoring index may help address the recent controversy on assessing the hazards of chemicals used in stimulating wells, according to Ron Hyden, strategic business manager
for Halliburton’s production enhancement product service line in
Houston.
Hyden made his remarks Oct. 5 at the SPE Annual Conference
& Exhibition in New Orleans.
He said Halliburton has developed an index that currently a
third party is assessing. Upon finalizing the index, Halliburton
plans to release it for use in the industry, Hyden said.
The index addresses the ability of chemicals to be health, physical, and environment hazards.
Concerns related to heath include chemical toxicity and whether the chemicals are carcinogens and mutagens as well as if they
affect reproduction and organs. Another health concern is whether the chemicals are corrosive or irritant substances.
Physical hazards relate to chemical properties such as explosiveness, flammability, oxidization, and corrosiveness.
Environment hazards include whether the chemicals produce
acute-chronic aquatic toxicity, hazardous air pollution, and water
pollution, as well as if the chemicals bioaccumulate, biodegrade,
and are sustainable.
The index expresses the constituent concentration and health,
safety, and environmental effect as a numerical aggregated score,
Hyden said. He noted that the aggregated score allows companies
to select chemical formulations that have the lowest score for their
application.

Apache, Santos let Reindeer field contract
Apache Energy Corp. and Santos Ltd.—partners in the Reindeer
field-Devil Creek natural gas project in Western Australia—have
let a $195 million (Aus.) contract to a joint venture of Malaysia’s
Sapura Crest Petroleum and Norway’s Acergy for the installation of
a suite of pipelines and offshore production facilities.
The work involves the transport and installation of 91 km of
rigid pipeline including offshore pipeline and a shallow-water
beach approach, subsea tie-in and stabilization works, as well
as a wellhead platform at the Reindeer gas field comprised of a
1,700-tonne four-leg steel jacket and a 450 tonne topside processing module.
Engineering and preparatory work will begin immediately in
Kuala Lumpur and Perth. Offshore installation is scheduled to
begin late next year using the Sapura 3000 dynamic positioning
heavy lift and pipelay vessel.
The Devil Creek gas plant is about 50 km south of Karratha and
will supply as much as 220 TJ/day of sales gas into the DampierBunbury trunkline. There will also be an associated production of
up to 500 b/d of condensate stripped from the gas stream.
Work at Devil Creek began in September and the plant is scheduled to come on stream at the end of 2011.

SPE: Oil recovery takes collaboration
Recovering the world’s remaining oil resources will require
a collaborative effort of national oil companies, international oil
companies, and service companies, according to Mohammed AlQahtani, executive director, petroleum engineering and development of Saudi Aramco.
Al-Qahtani made his comments Oct. 5 at the SPE Annual Conference & Exhibition in New Orleans.
Al-Qahtani said the world still had considerable amounts of oil
to recover. His estimate was that about 4.7 trillion bbl remained
to be produced. This includes about 2 trillion bbl from reserves
additions and exploration, 1.5 trillion bbl from nonconventional
resources, and 1.2 trillion from new technology, he said.
In addition, he noted that the world would need an additional
90 million b/d to offset declines in existing oil fields to reach a
125 million b/d level by 2030. Current world production is about
80 million b/d.

SPE: Pemex aspires for 60% Cantarell recovery
Pemex Exporation & Production is studying new ways for recovering more oil from the tight reservoir matrix of Cantarell field
off Mexico.
Speaking Oct. 7 at the SPE Annual Conference & Exhibition in
New Orleans, Carlos Morales Gil, Pemex E&P director general,
said carbon dioxide injection might provide the means to produce
additional oil from the field that originally contained about 35
billion bbl of oil in place, making it the third largest oil field in
the world. Steam injection is another possibility for improving
recovery of the field’s 22° gravity oil, he said.
Gil said Pemex now targets a 60% oil recovery from the field.
To date, Pemex has produced about 12.2 billion bbl and has obtained a 41% recovery for the Akal portion of the field, he noted.
The Chac 1 well, drilled from June 1974 to July 1976, discovered the field. First production started in 1979 and Pemex maintained about a 1 million bo/d production level until 1996. An infill drilling program, additional platforms, and a 1.2 bcfd nitrogen
injection scheme increased production in the field to more than
2 million bo/d in 2001. Since then, production has declined and
currently is about 600,000 bo/d, Gil said.
One obstacle for carbon dioxide injection is to find a large
source of carbon dioxide. Gil said that the field would need a carbon dioxide supply of about 1.2 bcfd, the same as the nitrogen
injection rate. ✦

Processing
Sunoco idles Eagle Point refinery in New Jersey
Another US independent refiner is slashing operations in response to low refining margins.
Sunoco Inc., Philadelphia, is idling its 150,000-b/d Eagle Point
refinery at Westville, NJ, citing “a recessionary economy, weak
demand for refined products, and increased global refining capacity.”
The refinery is interconnected with Sunoco’s refineries at Philadelphia and Marcus Hook, Pa., which form a complex with crude
capacity totaling 655,000 b/d.
Sunoco said Eagle Point is the least integrated of the three refineries. The closure will enable the company to increase capacity
utilization at the other two facilities and to keep total output by
the complex essentially unchanged.
Another independent refiner that has made deep cuts in its operations is Valero Energy Corp., which has shut major units at its
Delaware City, Del., and Corpus Christi, Tex., refineries and shut
down its refinery in Aruba (OGJ, Sept. 14, 2009, Newsletter).
Sunoco said it will keep the Eagle Point refinery closed until
market conditions improve or until it implements other options,
which might include using the facility to produce alternative fuels.
In June the company bought a 100 million gal/year ethanol
plant at Volney, NY, from bankrupt Northeast Biofuels LP for $8.5
million (OGJ Online, June 18, 2009).
At Eagle Point it will furlough about 400 employees, who will
have the option of returning to work if the refinery resumes operation. It will offer the workers a voluntary severance package.
Product storage and handling work will continue at the site,

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
and the Sunoco Logistics Partners LP products rack will remain
open.
Sunoco’s 170,000-b/d Toledo, Ohio, refinery is unaffected by
the move.
Sunoco estimated that idling the Eagle Point refinery will reduce pretax expenses by $250 million/year. It expects to incur
pretax charges of $475-550 million, mostly noncash, from asset
impairment and idling costs.
The company already had in place an effort to cut costs by $300
million/year by the end of 2009. In its announcement of the Eagle
Point closure, it said it would cut its dividend in half to save about
$70 million/year.

Murphy Oil acquires ethanol plant
A subsidiary of Murphy Oil Corp. has purchased a corn-based
ethanol plant in Hankinson, ND, for $92 million.
Additionally, an estimated $15 million in working capital will
be invested into the facility, Murphy Oil said. The plant’s production capacity was 110 million gal/year before it was idled in
October 2008.
David M. Wood, Murphy Oil president and chief executive officer, said the acquisition will supplement Murphy Oil’s growing
fuels business.
“It also marks our initial entry into the manufacture of biofuels,” Wood said. He cited current ethanol mandates and the
company’s subsequent blending needs as the reason for Murphy to
want “a presence in the supply chain.”
Wood said he expects to see ethanol production “shortly,” noting that the plant is near a feedstock supply and has accessible rail
service for carrying the finished product. ✦

LNG project weathers Indonesian earthquake

Enbridge, Chevron to bring Big Foot oil ashore

Operator BP PLC said that its Tangguh LNG project, which lies
in the Bintuni Bay area, is operating normally despite a 6.1-magnitude earthquake that hit West Papua, Indonesia, on Oct 4.
“The earthquake in Manokwari was not felt at the LNG project
location. The operation is running normally,” said BP Indonesia
country head Nico Kanter.
Indonesia’s Geophysics, Climatology, and Meteorology Agency
said the epicenter of the quake was 123 km northwest of Manokwari, West Papua, at a depth of 56 km.
The announcement follows reports last week that piped supplies of Indonesian gas from South Sumatra to Singapore—which
account for more than a third of the city-state’s needs—were not
disrupted by a 7.6-magnitude earthquake in West Sumatra on
Sept. 30.
The report followed checks by the Singapore importer, Gas
Supply Pte. Ltd. (GSPL), with ConocoPhilips, the field operator.
GSPL, a subsidiary of Temasek Holdings, imports 350 MMscfd
of gas from Grissik, South Sumatra, representing 37% of total Singapore imports of 940 MMscfd currently.

Enbridge Inc. has signed a letter of intent with Chevron USA
Inc., Statoil Gulf of Mexico LLC, and Marubeni Oil & Gas (USA)
Inc. to construct and operate a 40-mile, 20-in. OD oil pipeline
from the proposed Big Foot ultradeepwater development in the
Gulf of Mexico.
Enbridge has already announced plans to construct the Walker Ridge Gathering System, providing natural gas transportation
for the proposed Chevron-operated Jack, St. Malo, and Big Foot
fields.
The Big Foot Oil Pipeline will reach depths of up to 5,900 ft,
transporting as much as 100,000 b/d to a subsea connection on
existing deepwater pipeline infrastructure.
Chevron initiated front-end engineering and design in March
of a hub to develop Jack and St. Malo fields. The production facility would have capacity of 120,000-150,000 boe/d. Chevron estimates combined recoverable liquids reserves of the two fields at
more than 500 million bbl (OGJ Online, Aug. 1, 2009).
Enbridge estimates the cost of the Big Foot Oil Pipeline, about
170 miles south of the Louisiana coast, at about $250 million.
Combined with the Walker Ridge Gathering System project, ✦

The qualified recovery
Bob Tippee
Editor
Call it the qualified recovery.
It’s the resumption of global economic growth that seems to have
begun but that cannot be discussed
without a host of qualifications.
Markets show signs of life. But unemployment lingers. Expansion is slow.
Risks abound. So far, qualifications outnumber hopeful signs. After the crash
of 2008, any improvement is welcome.
Instead of “hip-hip-hooray,” however, the more reasonable response is
“hip-hip, and get back to work.” Or the
job search.
Oil markets have been anticipating recovery since the price of crude
scraped bottom at the turn of the year.
Traders, when they’re not arbitraging
oil against the dollar, seem to be using
equity prices as heralds of rebounds in
economies and oil consumption.
They’ll be right someday. For now,
demand’s still down from last year, and
inventories and idle production capacity
remain high. Until those relationships
change, the crude price will be shaky.
And they won’t change until the global
economy regains health.

Intensive care
If the economy isn’t yet out of the
hospital, it’s at least sitting up in bed,
according to the International Monetary
Fund’s new World Economic Outlook.
But it still needs intensive care.
“The global economy is expanding again, and financial conditions
have improved markedly,” say IMF
Economic Counselor Olivier Blanchard
and Financial Counselor Jose Vinals.
“It will take some time, however, until
14

the outlook for employment improves
significantly.”
IMF expects the global economy to
expand by 3% next year, well below
preslump growth rates. Last year the
economy contracted by 1%. Manufacturing and inventory rebuilding lead
the upturn. Other bright spots are gradually stabilizing retail sales, reviving
consumer confidence, and strengthening housing markets, IMF says.
Growth is strongest in the developing world. Real growth in gross domestic product will approach 5% in 2010
for the group of countries IMF calls
emerging economies. Last year, GDP for
this group grew by 1.75%.
For advanced economies, IMF says,
expansion will remain “sluggish,” with
unemployment rising, through much of
next year. The year’s GDP expansion for
this group will be about 1.25%, compared with contraction of 3.5% in 2009.
IMF credits central banks and governments for triggering the rebound
and suppressing fears about a worldwide depression.
Central banks slashed interest rates
and took “unconventional measures” to
inject liquidity and sustain credit. Governments launched stimulus programs
and supported banks with guarantees
and capital injections.
“Together, these measures reduced
uncertainty and increased confidence,
fostering an improvement in financial
conditions, as evidenced by strong rallies across many markets and a rebound
of international cash flows,” IMF says.
The group points out, however, that
“lower-tier borrowers” remain stressed
and that “the risk of a reversal is a significant market concern.”
Eventually, fiscal stimulus will subside, and inventory rebuilding will lose
influence. Consumption and investment will have to sustain economic
momentum, but they’re slow coming
back. So the recovery might stall, IMF
concedes.

Also, governments might abandon
accommodative monetary and fiscal
policies—economic intensive care—
“because the policy-induced rebound
might be mistaken for the beginning of
a strong recovery in private demand.”
In fact, IMF warns, the “fragile
global economy still seems vulnerable
to a range of shocks.” Risks include
rising oil prices, a resurgence of H1N1
flu, geopolitical events, and resurgent
protectionism.
While surprisingly rapid improvement in financial conditions raises
hope that consumption and investment
might recover faster than expected, the
agency says, a longer term risk looms.
It’s that public skepticism about
bailouts of financial firms might limit
support for financial restructuring and
foster prolonged stagnation. What’s
more, the cure may yet poison the
patient. “The greatest risk,” IMF says,
“revolves around deteriorating fiscal
positions, including as a result of measures to support the financial sector.”

Oil markets
IMF isn’t the only group publishing
forecasts about the global economy, of
course. But its outlook drives oil market
forecasts by widely watched analysts such as the International Energy
Agency.
Last January IEA said it bases oil
demand projections on demand forecasts by IMF, the intergovernmental
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and Consensus
Economics, a London-based survey of
700 economists.
In September, IEA added 500,000
b/d to its demand outlooks for this year
to 84.4 million b/d and for next year to
85.7 million b/d.
Both levels of consumption would
fall below those of 2007 (86.5 million
b/d) and 2008 (86.3 million b/d).
Hooray still must wait. ✦

The deepwater royalty win
A Supreme Court decision upholding the

malfunction in need of repair. Oil and gas producers, however, might yet have to argue the point.

downs mitigate the economic damage
of a disruption in oil supply in four
basic ways. Drawdowns, according to
Beaubouef:
• Help stabilize and lower oil prices
by discouraging excessive speculation,
panic buying, and hoarding.
• Reduce inflation, wealth transfers,
loss of industrial output, and “consequential economical damage” by
mitigating price increases.
• Play a key role in mitigating and
reducing,
and perhaps
preventing,
the type of
socioeconomic damage that occurred
in the 1970s by alleviating oil shocks.
• Allow the US economy time to adjust, recover, and operate more closely
to predisruption levels by helping to
replace lost supply.

SPR issues

the reserves could confirm oil traders’
fears of a major crisis, causing prices to
increase rather than decrease.
There was broad agreement, however, that SPR could help the US response
to an oil shortage by offering some
short-term relief. An overall lack of
experience in the use of SPR makes a
drawdown imperfect and uncertain.
That oil is a global commodity sold
on an international market also creates
problems for the SPR. Supply disruptions anywhere raise prices everywhere.
Therefore, there is concern that unilateral US action, by drawing upon SPR to
reduce prices, would benefit consumers worldwide but would be paid for
largely by American taxpayers.
Like events after Hurricane Katrina,
any use of SPR would have to be coordinated with similar actions by other
consuming countries. Still, the effects
of globally coordinated inventory withdrawals might be offset by output cuts
by producing nations. And there is no
guarantee that SPR oil made available
will find buyers.
The Congressional Research Service reports there are too many factors
involved to predict the effect of an SPR
drawdown would have on oil prices.
Oil quality is another issue. According to the Government Accountability
Office (GAO), 40% of the oil in SPR is
classified as “light sweet crude,” and
60% is classified as “light sour crude.”
These oil grades are not optimum feedstocks for the many US refineries that
have been upgraded to process heavy
oil.
GAO concluded SPR use could
decrease domestic gasoline production
by as much as 11% and diesel production by 35%. Of the approximately 5.6
billion bbl of oil that US refiners ran to
distillation units in 2006, GAO reports
an estimated 2.24 billion bbl (40%) was
heavier than that stored in SPR.

The SPR, however, faces several issues, some of which have been in effect
since the program’s inception.
One of those issues is uncertainty.
Oil ShockWave, a scenario exercise
developed by Securing America’s Future
Energy Future and the National Commission on Energy Policy, in 2005 examined the implications of and possible
responses to an oil shortfall, finding
that SPR offers “some protection against
a major supply disruption.” But it said
the protection is “limited in both scope
and duration.”
Participants, a group of formerly
high-ranking federal officials, verified that it was “extremely difficult”
to reach consensus on when SPR is
appropriate for use. The decision to
withdraw crude from strategic storage
is difficult and somewhat controversial,
as the inventory is ambiguously meant
to be tapped during a “severe energy
supply interruption.”
For example, Oil ShockWave participants were uncertain as to whether Recommendations
These issues suggest recommendahigh prices by themselves constituted
the type of emergency SPR is intended tions for managing the SPR.
• Store heavier oil. To ameliorate probto help assuage. Further, the use of
lems of compatibility with US refiner-

ies, a DOE study indicated that SPR
should have at least 10% heavy oil. An
added benefit of increasing the heavyoil share of the storage volume would
be lower per-barrel costs of purchased
crude.
• Base SPR purchases on dollar-cost averaging.
GAO suggests “filling SPR by acquiring
a steady dollar value of oil over time
rather than a steady volume of oil over
time as has occurred in recent years.”
The constant-quantity path of repeatedly purchasing the same monthly
amount is a detriment in times of high
prices and makes SPR filling more vulnerable to market volatility. Dollar-cost
averaging, on the other hand, offers
DOE a monthly allowance, meaning
more oil can be bought when prices are
low and less when they are high.
• Reexamine procurement. Oil companies
participating in the RIK program, until
it phases out, should be given more
flexibility to defer their SPR deliveries when filling would substantially
tighten the market or when a price decline is expected. The companies could
then provide additional barrels when
deliveries resume (DOE has permitted
some delivery deferments in the past).
Further, GAO notes the evaluation of
bids has been more adequate for cash
purchases than for RIK exchanges. Cash
purchases are generally seen as more
transparent and cost-effective.

Pivotal role
SPR drawdowns will continue to
play a pivotal role in protecting America’s national security. In fact, SPR is
the most functional energy security
policy tool at hand in the US. It helps
maintain the country’s petroleum-based
economy by making an oil crisis a
short-term phenomenon.

WGC09: Gas, LNG making inroads despite global recession

self-sufficient in gas supply and joins
the world’s LNG exporting nations.

Speakers on the first day of the 24th
World Gas Conference in Buenos Aires
consistently noted developments in the
past 3 years few had anticipated at the
last event in 2006.
The most obvious certainly has been
the 2008-09 global financial crisis, immediately depressing energy demand
with the worst contraction of business
activity since the 1930s.
The two major forces in the evolution of natural gas trade in the past 3
years have been a decisive transformation to a global gas trade and development of North America’s unconventional gas supply.
Expanding gas trade, pushed by the
growth of LNG production and proliferation of LNG regasification terminals,
has moved the gas industry closer to
its dream of breaking out of regional
geographic restrictions.
Combined with the growth in LNG
supply, however, has come the unexpected resurgence of gas supply in
North America from unconventional
sources. This surge in volume coupled
with depressed demand due to the
recession prompted some speakers here
to forecast a time in the not-too-distant
future when North America becomes

Gas demand growth

In his opening keynote address,
Antonio Brufau, Repsol chairman and
chief executive officer, addressed the
competition for markets between gas
and coal. He said gas demand will increase “more than what was expected,

to the detriment of coal [demand for
which] will recede.”
Brufau was one of several speakers
who cited coal’s problem with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS)
“plagued with unproven large-scale
technologies.”
Echoing his viewpoint later was
the International Energy Agency’s Ian
Cronshaw. Contrary to his and others’

WGC09: IGU issues gas industry study to 2030
Warren R. True
Chief Technology Editor-LNG/Gas Processing
Results of a major study by the
International Gas Union of natural gas
demand out to 2030 formed the basis
for an extended panel on the first day
of the 24th World Gas Conference in
Buenos Aires.
The study’s main conclusion was
that economic and environmental factors should push global gas demand to
more than 4 trillion cu m/year (about
141.2 tcf) by 2030, from about 3 trillion
cu m currently.
The study also concluded that a
global political agreement to put a high
cost on carbon dioxide emissions and
to encourage renewable energy “would
only be economically successful” in

combination with an increased share of
natural gas. “The right policies” would
boost gas to 28% of the global fuel mix
by 2030 from 21% today.
The study compared two 2030
scenarios: one from IGU experts that
represents a continuation of current
policy trends and another IGU “greenpolicy” scenario.
Primary energy demand under continued policies would reach 16.5 billion
tonnes/year of oil equivalent in 2030.
Of this, natural gas would represent
23%, or 4.3 trillion cu m. Carbon dioxide emissions from all fuels under this
scenario would reach 41.6 billion tpy.
Under the green-policy scenario,
however, primary energy demand
would reach 15 billion toe/year in 2030.
Of this, natural gas would represent

projections, he said, gas demand during
the current recession has increased, not
lost ground, in competition with coal.
CCS, on which coal depends for it to
compete in current and future environmentally conscious marketplaces,
is “at minimum 10 years away,” said
Cronshaw.
J. Mark Robinson, formerly a commissioner with the US Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission and currently
president of JMR Energy Infra LLC,
also said coal depends on CCS, and CCS
depends on the capacity of industry to
build dedicated pipelines for carbon
dioxide, something he calls an “asphyxia,” for which political concerns will
likely preclude siting permits.
Nuclear power, said Robinson, is
also problematic because final project
costs cannot adequately be estimated at
the first of the project.
Renewables, yet another competitor
with gas, require land and transmission
lines. Again, said Robinson, the public
does not want large areas of empty land
used as sites for wind or solar facilities
nor does it want an extensive growth in
electricity transmission lines.

28%, or 4.8 trillion cu m. Carbon
dioxide emissions from all fuels under
the “green policy” would reach only
27.7 billion toe/year, compared with 30
billion toe/year currently. The greenpolicy scenario envisions an agreement
in Copenhagen later this year and
reinforcement around 2020 of global
climate-change policy that leads to
further change as 2030 approaches.
The report shows, said its announcement, that combining a global agreement that “sustains a high cost of
carbon” with policies that continue to
“promote IGU sustainability principles”
can lead to a “dramatic improvement”
in carbon emissions.
“Governments would need to acknowledge that such a policy must be
consistent with the maintenance of energy security and the encouragement
of optimum economic choice,” it said.

Brufau said, independent of whatever energy policies are implemented,
the “weight of primary gas consumption will be stable or grow,” adding,
“This viewpoint is based on one of the
historically most stable long-term patterns: the ratio between gas consumption and per-capita income is stable or
upward with the economic growth of
countries.”
Brufau also noted that countries expected to have rapid economic growth
are emerging countries with low and
medium per-capita income, “representing two thirds of the world’s population.
“If we believe in the economic
growth of these countries, then we
must believe in the growth of gas
demand. If we expect China and India
to continue the patterns of per-capita
gas consumption seen in other more
advanced countries we should bet on
steady gas demand.”
The sector accounting for the
largest gas demand
growth has been
and will continue
to be electricity. He

people lack access

to break out of the historical regional
constrictions on its trade.
Brufau called attention to the “historical pattern in the industry that is
the growing weight of the international
gas trade and the increasing share of
LNG in it.” And he said this pattern will
be “projected into the future.”
The reasons for it are well-known:
Conventional reserves exist for more
than 60 years and the geographical distribution of reserves among the main
global regions implies that “future
regional interdependence and international gas trade will both increase.”
Brufau said, “In this context of globalization, …recent developments will
favor a bias towards geopolitical considerations and towards policies geared
to ensuring the security of supply.”
More than one speaker or panelist
called attention to the other significant
event in the last 3 years: the growth of

supplies in North America for unconventional gas developments.
Robinson noted how estimates of gas
reserves in the Marcellus shale alone
have increased by orders of magnitude;
we “don’t know how much gas is really
in the shale,” he said.
The “real question,” according to
Robinson, is whether the US will join
the group of gas-exporting countries in
the near future.
Brufau said unconventional gas, as
shown in North America, “is a new
variable” that will have to be taken into
account for any long-term view.
“From now on we will have to bear
in mind the relative cost of developing unconventional gas and the fact

T E R E S T
that unconventional gas production
responds very rapidly to changing demand and price conditions,” he said.
Will any of the large LNG producers
restrict their production in response to
markets, such as the US, where prices
are soft and supply is ample? That question was addressed by another keynote
speaker, Qatargas Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Faisal al-Suwaidi.
“I doubt that will happen,” alSuwaidi said, noting that overall, LNG
demand is growing. “Prices in some
markets, especially the mature ones,
may be down but [natural gas demand]
in the newer markets, especially China
and India will balance the more mature
markets, especially the US,” he said.

With its large trains and vessels,
Qatargas is in LNG trade for the long
term, he said; LNG is “a long-term
business,” adding, “People in this business shouldn’t watch the prices daily.
Over the next several years, prices will
fluctuate.”
Noting that both Qatargas and
RasGas remain under a LNG production
capacity ceiling of 77 million tones/
year, Suwaidi nonetheless believes each
of the 6 megatrains (at 7.8 million tpy/
train) could “easily be increased” by 2
million tpy after Qatar Petroleum lifts
its moratorium on new gas production from North field and, thereby, its
restriction on the two LNG companies. ✦

‘Not isolated’
The proposal illustrated the perils of
forcing GHG regulations into the CAA,
NPRA Pres. Charles T. Drevna observed
in a separate statement. “This proposal
incorrectly assumes that one industry’s
greenhouse gas emissions are worse
than another’s,” he said. “Greenhouse
gas emissions are global in nature, and
are not isolated to a few select industries.”
The CAA “stipulates unequivocally”
that the major sources’ permitting
threshold is 250 tons for criteria pollutants, Drevna noted. “EPA lacks the
legal authority to categorically exempt
sources that exceed the [CAA’s] major
source threshold from permitting requirements, and this creates a troubling
precedent for any agency actions in the
future,” he said.
Referring to the proposed regulation’s exemption of smaller businesses
and farms, “common sense prevailed
at EPA and we are thankful,” said Bill
Kovacs, senior vice-president of environment, technology, and regulatory
affairs at the US Chamber of Commerce. “However, we fear this proposal
rests on shaky legal ground,” he said,
adding, “As a result, EPA may have only
kicked the problem down the road,
or into the courthouse, and may have
to regulate all small businesses should
some environmental groups prevail in
likely lawsuits.”
In a statement, the chamber said the
proposal’s provision requiring plants
emitting 25,000 tons or more of GHGs
annually to get preconstruction permits, which could cost hundreds of
thousands of dollars and take from 8
months to more than a year to obtain.
This would put major roadblocks in
domestic efforts to build new major facilities and projects as the country tries
to work its way out of the recession and
provide affordable and reliable energy

organization warned.

few Republicans on the House Natural Resources Committee spoke up
instead on Sept. 16 at the first day of
hearings on chairman Nick J. Rahall’s

Mike Coffman (R-Colo.) confronted US Sec. of the Interior Ken Salazar,

Salazar whether DOI had determined
what constitutes diligent development of a federal lease.
Then there was Bill Cassidy (La.),

“creates contradictions in calling for
more expeditious production while it
increases bureaucratic delays.”

for blue-collar workers in the recent
economic downturn,” he said.

When he visited a rig in Pointe

GAO assesses impacts, challenges
of mandated biofuels increases
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
A federal tax credit of 45¢/gal established to help the domestic ethanol
industry probably won’t stimulate production beyond levels that new renewable fuels standards specify for this year
unless oil prices climb significantly, the
Government Accountability Office said.
The Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax
Credit also may no longer be needed
to stimulate US corn-based ethanol
production because the industry has
matured, its processing is well understood, and its production capacity is
already near the effective RFS limit of
15 billion gal/year, GAO said in a report issued on Oct. 2. A separate $1.01
tax credit is available for producing
advanced cellulosic biofuels, it noted.
It noted that in December 2007 Congress passed the Energy Independence
and Security Act (EISA), which requires
the use of ethanol and other biofuels
to rise from 9 billion gal in 2008 to 36
billion gal in 2022. “To meet the RFS,
domestic biofuels production must
increase significantly, with uncertain
effects to agriculture and the environment,” it said.
The report said to meet the RFS, the
US Departments of Agriculture (USDA)
and Energy (DOE) are developing
advanced biofuels that use switchgrass,
corn stover, and other cellulosic biofuels. The US Environmental Protection
Agency administers the RFS, it added.
GAO said it extensively reviewed scientific studies, interviewed experts and
24

agency officials, and visited five DOE
and USDA laboratories as it prepared
the report.

Higher prices
GAO said for agriculture, many
experts believe biofuel production has
contributed to crop increases as well as
higher prices for livestock, poultry, and,
to a lesser extent, food. “They believe
that this trend may continue as the RFS
expands,” it said.
“For the environment, many experts
believe that increase biofuels production could impair water quality by
increasing fertilizer runoff, and also
reduce water availability, degrade air
and soil quality, and adversely affect
wildlife habitat,” the report said.
“However, the extent of these effects
is uncertain and could be mitigated by
such factors as improved crop yields,
feedstock selection, use of conservation, and improvements in biorefinery
processing,” it added.
GAO said except for greenhouse gas
emissions, EPA currently is not required
by law to assess environmental effects
to determine which biofuels are eligible
for inclusion in the RFS.
GAO said many researchers interviewed for the report suggested there is
general agreement on the approach for
measuring biofuels production’s direct
effects on lifecycle GHG emissions but
disagreement about how to estimate
the indirect effects on global land use
change, which EPA is required to assess
in determining RFS compliance.
“In particular, researchers disagree

about what nonagricultural lands will
be converted to sustain world food production to replace land used to grow
biofuels crops,” GAO said.

Challenges loom
The US will face several key challenges in expanding biofuels production
to achieve the standard’s 36 billion gal
requirement in 2022, the report said.
“For example, farmers face risks
in transitioning to cellulosic biofuels
production and are uncertain whether
growing switchgrass will eventually
be profitable,” it said, adding, “USDA’s
new Biomass Crop Assistance Program may help mitigate these risks by
providing payments to farmers through
multiyear contracts.” US ethanol use
also is approaching the so-called “blend
wall”—the amount of ethanol that
most vehicles in the country can use—
given EPA’s 10% limit on gasoline’s
ethanol content, the report said.
“Research has been initiated on the
long-term effects of using 15% or 20%
ethanol blends, but expanding the use
of 85% ethanol blends will require
substantial new investment because
ethanol is too corrosive for the petroleum distribution infrastructure and
most pipelines,” it said.
“Alternatively, further R&D on
biorefinery processing technologies
might lead to price-competitive biofuels
that are compatible with the existing
petroleum distribution and storage infrastructure and the current fleet of US
vehicles,” it added.
The report recommended that in
addition to the GHG emissions analysis
required under EISA, Congress may
want to consider requiring the EPA
administrator to develop a strategy assessing the effects of increased biofuels
environment on all stages of the lifecycle (cultivation, harvest, transportation,
conversion, storage, and use) and to
use this assessment to determine which
biofuels are eligible for consideration
under the RFS. “This would ensure that
all relevant environmental effects are
considered concurrently with lifecycle
[GHG] emissions,” GAO said. ✦

between the offshore Kashagan oil field
and Baku that will enable oil to be carried to Europe.
“This is an exceptionally important
project, which forms the base of the

Kazakh gas and oil to Europe,” Nazarbayev said.
Sarkozy agreed, saying, “This oil
pipeline is going to create many jobs
here and in France” and “will furthermore guarantee the security of our
energy supply.”

As one observer noted: “Kazakhstan has long been courted by Western
governments for its energy wealth and

The pipeline agreement, one of
several between the two countries involving oil and gas, will bypass Russia

diversifying its markets.

f there is anything the oil and gas
industry has learned in Romania
recently, it’s that Europe and Central
Asia are determined to establish an
energy bridge that bypasses Russia.
That was the resounding message
that emerged from the Black Sea Energy & Economic Forum, organized
in Bucharest over Sept. 30-Oct. 2 by
the Atlantic Council.
The message was underscored
by many speakers, but none more
clearly than in a reminder by Fabrizio Barbaso, deputy director general,

“The gas crisis in January 2009
between Ukraine and Russia was

“One of the EU’s greatest challenges is to ensure that growing
energy dependence does not become
a risk to wider economic or international security,” Barbosa said.

Yet, even as the EU and the US
develop an energy strategy that
bypasses Russia, no one doubts the
consequences of shutting the door
completely on the Russians. Conference participants needed no reminder of Russia’s incursion into Georgia
last year, and its disruption of world
energy supplies.

KMG-SOCAR agreements
Meanwhile, Turganov’s announcement coincided with reports that
Kazakhstan’s state-owned KazMunaiGaz
and State Oil Co. of the Azerbaijani
Republic (SOCAR) have reached several
agreements to ensure that the rising
volumes of Kazakh oil will reach world
markets.
The agreements, signed during a
visit to Baku by Kazakhstan President
Nursultan Nazarbayev, envisage shipments of Kazakh crude by tanker across
the Caspian Sea and then by rail from
to Georgia’s Black Sea ports of Batumi
and Kulevi, as well as through the existing Baku-Supsa pipeline.
According to KazMunaiGaz, the
agreements cover “joint work on the
technical and economic feasibility study
for the TransCaspian project, a memorandum of understanding about cooperating in the oil pipeline Baku-Black
Sea; and a memorandum about the
joint use of gas and oil infrastructure
that belongs to SOCAR for the development of Kazakhstan’s hydrocarbon

“These documents are the next step

The TransCaspian project will include oil loading terminals on the Kazakh shore of the Caspian Sea, tankers and
vessels, offloading terminals on the Azerbaijan coast of the
Caspian Sea and equipment to link into the Baku-TbilisiCeyhan line, KazMunaiGaz said.
Depending on the results of the feasibility study, the parties “will as soon as possible plan to create a project company to realize the TransCaspian project,” KazMunaiGaz said.
According to analyst IHS Global Insight, “The agreements
between the two state-owned oil and gas firms should serve
both countries’ interests, giving Kazakhstan additional clarity on exports of future oil production from the Kashagan
and Tengiz fields while ensuring Azerbaijan’s prime transit
role in the export of this growing output.”

New York releases Marcellus
shale drilling proposal
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) released a draft proposal to govern potential
natural gas drilling activities in the Marcellus shale, specifically horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing.
The Supplemental Generic Environmental Impact Statement (SGEIS) outlines safety measures, protection standards,
and mitigation strategies that operators would have to follow
to obtain permits.
New York Gov. David A. Paterson directed DEC to prepare
the SGEIS. The state has not yet allowed any horizontal development of the Marcellus shale.
A public comment period on the draft is open until Nov.
30. DEC will accept comments in writing, either via e-mail,
regular mail, direct online submissions, or delivered at
public information sessions. Those sessions have yet to be
scheduled.
“Well permitting and drilling is expected to be more
onerous in New York,” than in some other states, Raymond
James & Associates Inc. analyst John Freeman of Houston
said in an Oct. 1 research note.
“While the rules have not been set in stone, New York
has provided a path in which operators could develop the
Marcellus shale,” Freeman said. “Still it is too early to tell if

In the struggle with climate change,
“gas comes off better than alternatives
because the latter are less proven and

Two patterns in natural gas demand
are evident in the near future, he said:
demand for electric power generation has been cut in half, and demand
among non-OECD nations has increased.
As a result, investments in the near
future will slow, which will in turn
delay final investment decisions for
projects needed to meet growing global
energy demands.
With demand likely to recover more
quickly than investments, that will put
a squeeze on supply. ✦

The silent majority of British Columbians is the most potent force to unlock
the province’s rich offshore basins to
oil exploration.
Public demand for oil jobs and
revenues, coupled with clear evidence of the operators’ environmental
responsibility, will create the political
will to lift the moratorium that blocks
exploration today. On a sustained basis,
exploration proponents need to provide
the public with honest, factual information about the enormous benefits of oil
development.
Faced with overcautious provincial
and federal governments and noisy
environmental and anticapitalist lobbies whose stridency conceals a limited
weight of numbers, proponents of offshore exploration have a natural ally in
the working British Columbians. With
the employment uncertainties of the
current recession, investment and jobcreation potential offshore makes obvious partners of business and workers.
Geological studies conducted so far
indicate that the best oil prospects off
BC exist in Mesozoic rocks in western
Queen Charlotte Sound,1-3 perhaps with
additional oil and gas targets in other
areas and rock formations.4 Though
potential oil and gas traps exist in
various offshore BC basins, a major
limiting factor is the presence of petroleum source rocks at required levels of
organic maturation.
Favorably, the prospective western
Queen Charlotte Sound area lies in
relatively shallow water on the continental shelf, in a sea free of pack ice or
icebergs (Fig. 1).
Oil seeps have been known in the

Vancouver Island have so far proved
nonprospective, largely due to lack of
impermeable cap rock.
The government moratorium imposed in the early 1970s ended exploration offshore, except for a marine
seismic reflection survey in Hecate
Strait and Queen Charlotte Sound in
1988. Other impediments to exploration arise from environmental concerns

Earthquake risk will affect oil-infrastructure development. The BC coastal
region is part of the circum-Pacific
“Ring of Fire” characterized by greatly
elevated earthquake activity.
Tremors are frequently felt along the
BC coast. Yet, some geological studies
indicate the BC coast region is tectonically anomalous in the circum-Pacific
ring, and its earthquake risk may be
lower than sometimes estimated:3 5
while earthquakes large and small are
many, a city-flattening “Big One” seems
less likely than is commonly supposed.
An estimate by Hannigan et al.4 is
that the offshore BC basins contain
some 9.8 billion bbl of oil and 43.4 tcf
of natural gas.
Such reserve estimates in underexplored frontier basins are fashionable
but also usually unreliable and dependent on many loose assumptions.
With their somewhat different geologic
model, Lyatsky and Haggart1 abstained
from numerical predictions. Regardless,
BC boasts a rich and ill-explored oil
and gas province off its Pacific coast.

to sea the Alaska-to-California tankers.
In 1972, Pierre Trudeau’s federal government made a “policy decision” to
approve no new exploration programs
and permits off BC and to suspend all
obligations under existing ones.6 7
Subsequent complications were
many. Federal-provincial disputes about
offshore jurisdiction wound their way
to the Supreme Court of Canada.
After 1984, provincial efforts to lift
the moratorium, with public hearings
and federal-provincial discussions, continued until the Exxon Valdez oil spill
in Alaska in 1989. Then, in the face of
real concerns and much hysteria, BC
reaffirmed its moratorium. The federal
government said it would lift its own
moratorium only at BC’s request.
After a decade or so of leftish NDP
provincial governments that succeeded
the business-minded Social Credit, a
new BC Liberal government announced
early in this decade that it would like
to see offshore oil exploration by 2010.
There followed a flurry of report writing and task-force discussions, but BC
did ask Ottawa to remove the moratorium.
Then came federal reports and
reviews, including one by no less than
the Royal Society of Canada. Worded
cautiously, these reports generally
found no compelling reasons to prevent
offshore exploration.
But the BC Liberals’ offshore enthusiasm waned as they faced reelection
against left-wing opposition. Climatechange concerns have also developed
an antioil tinge.
Meanwhile, Ottawa acquired a
minority Conservative government in
2006, which survives in office at the
pleasure of leftist opposition. Split three
ways between the Tories, Liberals, and
NDP, many federal ridings in BC are
sensitive to even small vote swings,
leaving the Tories reluctant to rock the
boat by raising sensitive local issues.
Federal ministers grow visibly annoyed when questioned about the BC
offshore moratorium, and the current
federal priority in Canada’s offshore oil
supply seems to be ensuring national

many ordinary British Columbians.
Very notable are groups and individuals variously concerned about environmental degradation, ideologically
opposed to resource extraction, hostile
to capitalism, suspicious of oil companies or of any large-scale corporate
activities, or even nihilists who regard
the modern industrial civilization as an
unnatural parasite load on the planet.
Such groups and persons tend to congregate around the Lower Mainland
and southern Vancouver Island, but are
found also in the BC interior and up the
coast.
Loathing of offshore drilling among
such groups can be talismanic. Private
statements are often unprintable.
Public and media statements tend to
be exaggerated, even fantastic, claims
about environmental damage supposedly caused by marine oil development
and geophysical surveys, ignoring the
ever-diminishing environmental footprint of exploration and drilling and
the many decades of environmentally

In their heart of hearts, both levels
of government probably want the moratorium lifted, but neither wants the
hot potato. Neither side wishes to get
“blamed” for taking a definitive step,
and each would like to shift the public
blame to the other. The safest option is
to do nothing.
The political scene is now becoming
cloudy. The oil-skeptical Obama administration and Democrat-controlled
Congress have arisen in Washington,
DC, although continuing US thirst for
oil is imposing its own sobering inevitability.
The BC Liberal government is in its
third consecutive term, with an eventual prospect of return to office of the
left-wing NDP. The federal Tories are
in their second term of precarious minority, and the thinking of the federal
Liberals on offshore oil exploration is a
question mark.

side, like many other British Columbians and aboriginal communities
elsewhere in Canada, First Nations may
conceivably grow to favor oil development if provided with sufficient
revenue shares and employment opportunities.
For now, coastal First Nations in BC
mostly oppose offshore oil exploration,
citing environmental concerns, unresolved land claims, and lack of clarity
about aboriginal rights if exploration
went ahead.
The Haida Nation of the Queen
Charlotte Islands in its constitution
claims for itself “the entire Dixon
Entrance, half of the Hecate Straits,
halfway to Vancouver Island and Westward into the abyssal ocean depths.”6
The rigidity of this ambitious claim in
the face of serious negotiations remains
to be tested.

The way forward
Latent public sympathy among ordinary British Columbians is the offshore
oilmen’s strongest weapon.
It persists despite shrill opposition
and in the absence of sustained pro-exploration publicity. This sympathy will
become broader and deeper if antioil
propaganda is countered by honest, balanced, and factual information aimed at
the general public.
Investors and operators are well
placed to provide the public with honest information about environmentally
responsible offshore oil development,
as well as about the job opportunities
and revenues that would benefit local
workers, families, and communities.
Oil industry associations and corporations have a strong track record
of winning public support in other
Canadian jurisdictions. Lobbying the
governments has its place, but in a
democracy the general public calls the
shots. ✦

wells may have experienced early water
breakthroughs.
Staatsolie Maatschappij Suriname
NV operates the field in which wells
produce heavy 16° gravity oil. The
wells are in shallow, high permeability,
low-dipping, and very unconsolidated
reservoirs that experienced early water
breakthrough, short-circuiting significant reserve potential.
The vertical, openhole gravel pack
completions produced water-free at
150-300 bo/d for a few months and
then plummeted to 25-50 bo/d when
water broke through.
Progressing cavity pumps (PCPs)
were the primary artificial lift method
in the 5.5-in. casing completions.
The company first attempted to
install high-volume PCPs to reduce the
flowing bottomhole pressure (FBHP)
to restore some lost oil production after
water breakthrough. Fluid withdrawal
rates increased to ±700 b/d from ±350
b/d with no significant change in fluid
level, water cut, or oil production.
At second attempt with an electrical submersible pump (ESP) did reduce
the FBHP and increased oil production.
Fluid withdrawal rates increased to
±2,200 b/d and reduced FBHP by about
100 psi.
The ESPs realized sustained oil
production increases of between 100%
and 400%. Water cuts increased by no
more than 3%. Dynamic fluid levels in
surrounding wells showed a temporary
reduction, but increased and stabilized
at original levels after 2-3 months, indicating a very active edge-water drive
mechanism.
The company plans to add infill

also has not observed any sand production to date, indicating no deterioration of the gravel pack at these elevated

The company considered edge-water
underrunning the oil leg as the primary mechanism responsible for the
water breakthrough. To a lesser, but
still significant extent, is the contribution of water from the underlying,
relatively low-permeability Cretaceous
beds across the unconformity (Fig. 4).
It decided to increase the drawdown
in these wells with appropriate highvolume pumps to allow the bypassed
oil to move towards the wellbore.
Due to the limited ID of the field’s
standard 5.5-in. casing, the company
considered PCPs inadequate to achieve
the required high water-cut fluid extraction rates.

Well selection
One criterion for selecting wells
that could have larger pumps was their
ability to produce more than 500 b/d
of fluid.
The PCP with largest production
volume, at that time, able to fit comfortably in 5.5-in. casing could produce
2 b/d/rpm. At the maximum recommended speed (400 rpm) and at 80%
efficiency, the pump could attain
maximum rates of ±650 b/d. This rate
would reduce the FBHP only marginally.
Another criterion was to have an
FBHP greater than 450 psi. At the minimum ESP rate of 1,500 b/d, each well
would be required to deliver an additional 1,000 b/d. This only would be
possible if there was sufficient reservoir
pressure capacity for this extra production without pumping off the well.
A third criterion was to have a water
cut between 90 and 96%. Wells with
FBHP >450 psi and producing at rates
exceeding 500 b/d were inevitably high
water-cut wells (>80% water cut).
The lower limit of 90% was picked
to avoid selecting well candidates for
this project from the existing wells
with greater oil production. The upper
limit of 96% was selected, so that at
the maximum designed extraction rate

of 2,200 b/d, the well would produce
sufficient oil production to justify
the investment should the water cut
increase to 98%.
A fourth criterion was for the wateroil ratio to range from 9 to 24 (90-96%
water cut) and have remained stable for
the last 2 years.
At water cuts >90%, small changes
in water cut are visible more readily
when displayed as a water-oil ratio
rather than percent water cut. For
example, a 95% water cut corresponds
with a water-oil ratio of 19 and 96%
water cut corresponds with a water
oil-ratio of 24. The criterion, therefore,
was that the trend of the water-oil ratio
during the past 2-3 years should not be
increasing significantly with time.
A fifth criterion was that the well’s
productivity index (PI) was greater
than 5. A 200-psi pump intake pressure
was recommended for securing longevity in ESP operation at maximum rates.
The selected wells, therefore, should
have a reasonably high PI to reach the
1,500 b/d minimum before the target
pump intake pressure reaches 200 psi.
For a minimum additional flow rate
of 1,000 b/d, the PI required to reduce

the FBHP from 450 psi to 200 psi is
4. A PI of at least 5 includes a safety
margin.
The last criterion was for the wells
to have a recovery greater than 20%.
Even though wells with low ultimate
recoveries indicate significant remaining oil in place, they also have a low
recovery rate. These conditions could
result from formation damage, early
water break through, or high in situ
oil viscosity. Wells with a high recovery percentage, on the contrary, show
a high potential for favorable oil flow
rates to the wellbore.
Due to the pressure support from the
edge-water drive in the region under
consideration, recoveries greater than
20% within 4-5 years of production
were common. This confirms greater
potential for higher recovery with additional drawdown than wells with lower
recoveries in the same period. These
lower recoveries with similar original
oil in place indicate wells with formation damage or those too close to the
oil-water contact.
From all the wells fitted with the
large volume PCP pumps (about 20
wells), 5 wells met all the criteria listed
previously. Since budget allocation lim-

2009, the wells have produced a combined incremental 40,500 bbl of oil.

higher sulfur crude oils.
Elemental sulfur itself
has gyrated through a wild price cycle
over the past 2 years.
More changes to US refinedproduct sulfur qualities are coming on the heels of gasoline and
transportation diesel fuel improvements already implemented.
The largest impact will be in
the marine sector, in which portions of traditional high-sulfur
residual bunker will be replaced with
distillate. More reductions are likely for
Northeast US heating oil markets.

Sulfur pricing
Sulfur is considered a by-product of
refining and not generally a valuable
product. It is costly to remove from
crude oil and certainly not sought after.

SPECIAL

Refinery Sulfur Issues

Sulfur supply is relatively inelastic with most on-purpose production
shutdown long ago and by-product
sulfur accounting for the majority of
supply. Historically, surplus sulfur was
stockpiled in remote locations, such as
Alberta, as the cost of transportation
was more than the end-market value.
Through midyear 2008, demand for
sulfur rose steadily, driven by increased
sulfuric acid and fertilizer demand in
both the developed and developing
markets.
Ethanol and biodiesel production
accounted for part of the increase, but
higher protein diets in developing markets form the primary driver. Increased
demand reduced sulfur inventories, and
remote stockpiles were depleted rapidly.
In response, sulfur prices rose quickly through 2007 and into 2008. The
financial crisis in late 2008, however,
pushed down sulfur prices sharply.
The product now has little value and
some refiners are paying to have sulfur
removed from their plants.
Once the economy recovers, higher
costs in the sulfur industry are likely
to keep prices higher than
historical levels, although
lower than recent peaks.
New supplies of sulfur
from sour gas fields in
Abu Dhabi and other
Middle East locations could
add major new supplies
that would restrain any
long-term price increases
even as demand for sulfur
remains strong.

From a refiner’s perspective, the location of
sulfur in the crude oil is
important.
In most cases, sulfur is
concentrated in the heavier distillations.
Sulfur removal by hydroprocessing becomes increasingly difficult as boiling
point increases, requiring higher pressure, temperature, and residence time.

for several benchmark crude oil grades.

of the fuel delivered.
Subsequently, major amendments
to Annex IV were ratified in October
2008 that will dramatically impact the
refining and shipping industries. The
amendments call for the reduction of
sulfur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides
(NOx), and particulate matters (PM)
from ships. The sulfur reduction will
have the greatest impact on refining but
the shipping industry will need to address the other emissions limits as well.
Separately, there are discussions on
ways to reduce ship’s CO2 emissions,
but no formal action has been proposed
as of this writing. The amendments call
for reductions in two geographic areas:
1. Emissions control areas (ECA
or originally SECA for SOx Emissions
Control Area).
2. The rest of the globe.
Emissions reductions in ECAs are
more immediate and severe with the
global requirement coming later. ECAs
can specify regulations of SOx, NOx,
PM, or a combination. Environmental
justification is necessary for the IMO
to agree to an ECA adoption. There are
two SOx ECAs (SECAs) today, one in
the Baltic Sea and the other covering
the North Sea-English Channel.
Annex VI calls for substantial reduction in sulfur levels in the ECA and in
the broader global market, as illustrated
in Fig. 5.
Currently, the ECA requirement
specifies that bunker fuel with a maximum sulfur of 1.5% be consumed in
the ECA. The sulfur level is reduced to

1.0% in 2010 and 0.1% in 2015. Outside the ECAs, the bunker-sulfur limit
is reduced to a maximum of 3.5% in
2012 and to 0.5% in 2020, subject to a
study on the supply availability in 2018
that could result in the deadline being
moved to 2025.
The US Senate ratified the IMO
Annex VI treaty following the new
amendments added last year. The EPA
along with Canada has submitted a proposal for an ECA (SOx, PM, and NOx)
that would essentially extended 200
miles off both coast lines and Hawaii. If
approved by the IMO’s Marine Environmental Protection Committee, expected
to be voted on at a March 2010 meeting, the ECA could come into force
around 2012.
Mexico has stated it will also seek
an ECA soon. California has advanced
separate regulations and issued a Marine Notice that only distillate fuels can
be used within 24 nautical miles of its
shore from July 2009.
Both the IMO Annex VI and the EPA
proposed regulations allow for “Equivalents” technologies to be used in lieu
of low-sulfur fuels. This opens the possibility that a seawater or closed water/
caustic “scrubbing” approach or other
technology could be employed.
While this technology is proven
commercially in a number of onshore facilities, the application aboard
operating vessels is mostly in a pilottesting stage at present. The pilot results
generally appear favorable and Wartsila,
a marine engine manufacturer, has

feedstock markets.
The total US residual fuel market as defined in Fig. 6 is
about 1.35 million b/d, of which more
than half consists of refinery feedstocks
including vacuum gas oil and straightrun residues.
The bunker market (international
plus domestic supplies) varies from
year-to-year, averaging about 400,000
b/d over the past 5 years. High-sulfur
residual bunker fuel (Fig. 6) for 2008
was 415,000 b/d, not including another
125,000 b/d of marine distillates.
While demand for ECA fuels varies
by coastal Petroleum Administration
for Defense District (PADD), Purvin
& Gertz’s analysis of the US vessel
port calls, routing of trade goods, and
bunker supplied concludes that a sizable portion of the bunker supplied is
consumed in the proposed ECA area.
The most immediate question facing
US refiners on this topic is how this
ECA requirement affects demand and
the type of fuel required. Our work
supports the idea that nearly all of this
demand shifts to distillate fuels by
2015, based on two key factors.
First, the timing of the regulation
and the status of the ship-scrubbing
technology will probably not allow for
a significant number of scrubbers to be
installed on the vast number of vessels
that call on US ports.
Second, the scrubbing economics
are not supported on a vessel that only
spends a limited portion of a global
voyage in an ECA, based on Purvin &
Gertz’s forecast. Even a vessel sailing

Successful production of ultralow

a proper catalyst selection, a modern
reactor distribution tray that guarantees
even distribution of feed and hydrogen
across the catalyst bed, and reliable
hydrotreater equipment operation.
Failure of one of these areas can
lead to failure in the production of

TK-576 Brim catalyst charge into both

diesel hydrotreater and some adjustment of the operation, a performance
test was carried out. Table 1 summarizes the operating conditions of the
hydrotreater under study.
Fig. 1 presents a simplified diagram
of feed charging to the heavy diesel
hydrotreater, the reactors, and available
sampling points for process control. Fig.
2 presents the results of this test.
The data in Fig. 2 show that the sulfur in the product fluctuated in a wide
range (40-80 ppm) with no dependence of hydrogenate sulfur on reactor
temperature found. Sulfur hydrogenate
was falling to less than 50 ppm, when
95% distillation point was reduced to
340° C. from 355° C. or when feed
charging was reduced by 10% (Fig. 3).
The need to explain this unsatisfactory operation of this heavy diesel

This is a chromatogram of sulfur specification of
the LNB heavy diesel hydrotreating unit feed and
product obtained during testing with SRGO feed
(Fig. 7).
Research Laboratory pilot unit. The
pilot plant’s operating test conditions
were identical with those of the commercial unit.
Two catalyst samples were examined: the TK-576 Brim test sample, provided by Haldor Topsoe a year before
the catalyst commercial application,
and the TK-576 Brim catalyst sample
from the charge loaded in the commercial unit reactors.
Two feeds of straight-run gas oil
SRGO 240-360° C. from the crude
distillation unit and the hydrotreater
feed (blend of SRGO 240-360° C. and
LVGO) were tested. Table 2 presents
the properties of SRGO 240-36° C.,
LVGO, and the commercial hydrotreater
feed. Considering the content of total
sulfur, nitrogen, and dibenzotiophenes
in SRGO from crude unit and LVGO allows calculation that LVGO in the commercial hydrotreater feed was 35%.
The refinery operating data, however, indicated that
this hydrotreater
feed LVGO content
should have been
no higher than 10%.
This discrepancy
could be explained
by the scheme of
charging feed to
the heavy diesel
hydrotreater, i.e.
blend of SRGO and
LVGO plus a certain
amount from tank
farm (Fig. 1).
Fig. 4 (pilot plant
test results) indicates
that the catalyst
TK-576 Brim qual-

ity from test sample and from reactor
charge was identical. The observed
deviations between sulfur content in
hydrogenate from both catalyst samples
in HDS of SRGO were within the repeatability of the method used for sulfur determination in this study, ASTM
D-3120 (repeatability of 28%).

Fig. 4 also shows that feed quality
has considerable effect on hydrogenate
sulfur. For example, the 50-ppm sulfur
level in hydrogenate was achieved at
WABT of 355° C. when the SRGO was
treated, while WABT of 367° C. was
required to reach the same product
sulfur level when the commercial feed

on reactor temperature. The reason for
these results could be the bypass of
catalyst bed in reactors or leakage and
mixing of feed with product in heat
exchangers. Fig. 6 illustrates dependency of hydrogenate sulfur from LHSV
at constant WABT of 365° C. These data
show that hydrogenate sulfur fell with
a reduction of LHSV.
This refuted the hypothesis of the
catalyst bed bypass. In case of bypass,
the reduction of LHSV would not cause
sulfur reduction in the product. Analysis of feed and product, made during
the test showed presence of benzotiophenes in hydrogenate (Fig. 7). These
benzotiophenes are 20 times as reactive
as substituted dibenzotiophenes and
should not be present in hydrogenate at
sulfur levels of 40-80 ppm.
These facts indicated the most probThe red arrow indicates the crack in the heat exchanger’s compensator (Fig. 9).
able reason for unsatisfactory operation of the heavy diesel hydrotreater
was a leakage in heat exchanger block
after reactors where feed is heated by
hydrotreated product. Shutdown of the
unit and opening of heat exchanger
block revealed that there was a leak in
one of the six heat exchanger bodies
(Fig. 8). A crack in the compensator of
the heat exchanger body was detected
(Figs. 9-10).
This finding gave reasonable explanation of observed strange results.
Obviously the extent of leakage has
been changing during the unit’s operation because the place of the detected
crack should allow opening and closing

Background
To date CO2 is the largest single contributor to the greenhouse-gas buildup
in the atmosphere. The US Energy Information Administration reported the
US emitted more than 5.75 billion tons
of CO2 in 2008,1 an increase of more
than 20% over 1990 emissions (Fig. 1).
These factors have prompted a growing
concern over greenhouse gas emissions
from sources such as power generation,
the number one source of CO2 emissions worldwide.2
In order to help meet strict future
environmental requirements, existing
CCS technologies will be borrowed,
enhanced, and reapplied. Sequestration
can occur by either directly sequester-

Industrial sources
The National Carbon Sequestration
Database and Geographic Information System (NATCARB) served as the
primary source of emission data for
source-to-sink analysis. NATCARB
is a unified database, funded by the
National Energy Technology Laboratory
and maintained by the Kansas Geological Survey. It contains several regional
databases on carbon sources and sinks.
INTEK analyzed these databases to provide unique subsets for analysis.5
The NATCARB database includes
source data for industrial CO2 emissions
totaling 56.5 tcf/year. Data include utilities, ethanol, gas processing, concrete,
steel, refineries, ammonia, and other
industrial sources. Potential sources
include fossil fuel plants, refineries, cement plants, hydrogen plants, ammonia
plants, and ethanol plants. Fig. 2 maps
the industrial sources considered in the
study.6
Fossil fuel plants and refineries represent more than 90% of the capturable
CO2 emitted. Emissions from ethanol
plants will grow steadily in the near
future. Data from the Renewable Fuels
Assocation supplemented the location
and emission data of ethanol plants.7
Capture from these industrial sources
can provide up to 25 tcf/year of industrial CO2 (Table 1).8

Fig. 3 shows the distances between
four refineries and a large number of
candidate fields in the Illinois basin.
The tariff used would be for the average distance of 158 miles.
Pipeline cost depends on the distance the CO2 is transported, the capacity of the pipeline, and the compression
equipment required. Fig. 4 provides example costs for two pipeline scenarios,
with transportation costs ranging from
<$8/ton to >$9/ton depending on volume and distance of CO2 transported.

compressed, and transported, it must
be sequestered. A company can either
directly sequester the CO2 or treat it as
a commodity for industrial use (Fig.
5). The CO2’s value depends on its level
of contamination and the purpose
for which it is intended. This section
describes key sequestration and value
options.
• Depleted oil and gas reservoirs. Carbon
dioxide can be injected into depleted
or abandoned reservoirs. The National
Energy Technology Laboratory conducted a CO2 sequestration pilot test in
2008 at the depleted West Pearl Queen
field in New Mexico, injecting 2,100
tons of CO2.12
• Deep saline aquifers. Another sequestration option uses saline aquifers,
composed of porous rock containing
brine. An extensive impenetrable rock

layer caps these aquifers—widespread
throughout the US and Canada—allowing trapping of the injected CO2.12
Several aquifers with large storage
potential lie in Utah, Wyoming, and
Colorado, including the Farnham dome
along the southwestern edge of the
Uinta basin, the target site of a planned
field test of the effectiveness of carbon
sequestration in deep saline aquifers
NETL reports injection wells will be
drilled in 2009 and CO2 injection will
continue through 2012. Up to 1 million
tons/year of CO2 will enter the dome
during the test phase, followed by several years of monitoring.
An NETL assessment of deep saline
formations found
a combined storFig. 7

between 219 and

• Ocean beds.
Sequestration of
CO2 in the ocean

bed is an experimental technology
and is not currently in use. Under this
option, if sequestration is occurring at
up to 1,000 m water depth, it will be
transported by pipeline; otherwise, a
ship will be required.
• Food and industrial-grade CO2. If a company purifies the CO2 sufficiently, it
can be sold as either industrial or foodgrade. Preparing CO2 for an industrial
or food purpose is more costly than
sequestration, however, as it must meet
purity standards. Industrial CO2 must
be at least 99.5% pure, while the food
grade CO2 is required to be 99.9% pure.
• Enhanced oil recovery. CO2 EOR technology has been profitable in commercial applications for nearly 30 years.
As of 2008 there were 100 CO2 EOR
projects in the US, with a combined
crude oil production of 240,000 b/d.

the relationship between the increase
in the number of active projects and the
increase in production (OGJ, Apr. 21,
2008, p. 42).
There are nearly 2,100 reservoirs in
the onshore Lower 48 states that are
candidates for CO2 miscible flooding
(Fig. 8) and would present a market
for produced CO2. Indentifying these
potential reservoirs used the following
criteria:
1. API gravity >22°.
2. Reservoir pressure greater than
the minimum miscibility pressure.
3. Depth >2,500 ft.
4. Oil viscosity <10 cp.
5. Current oil saturation >20% of
pore volume.
6. Sandstone or carbonate rock.
• Gas bearing sandstone. CO2 injected
into gas bearing sandstone can maintain pressure and produce the methane
contained in the reservoir. Gas reservoirs in sandstones have ideal porosity
for CO2 injection. Injection is continued
until the CO2 breaks through. This process may require installation of additional injection wells and compressors
to increase reservoir pressure.
• Gas bearing shale. CO2 maintains reservoir pressure and produces methane
through natural fractures in the reservoir. This process continues until CO2
breaks through to the production well.
• Coalbed methane. CO2 can also recover gas from

GIS Energy Data for M&A Analysis
The most trusted and utilized provider of GIS data to the pipeline
industry for M&A and asset valuation analysis.
MAPSearch® provides detailed pipeline and pipeline facility information for use in Merger and
Acquisition Analysis such as:
•
•
•
•

What pipeline assets does company “A” now own?
What gathering, processing, and storage facilities do they operate?
What local pipeline company owns assets that would be a complimentary acquisition?
If these midstream assets were acquired:
• What would the combined assets look like?
• What new markets could they reach?
• Who would the new competitors be?
• How might the locally proposed LNG facility construction impact the value of the assets?
MAPSearch tracks interstate, intrastate, and gathering system pipelines and pipeline facilities
for all of North America and provides this information in a format for users to conduct their
own analysis. By staying abreast of developments in the pipeline industry, MAPSearch provides
buyers, sellers, ﬁnancers, and analysts with the information necessary to identify and evaluate
acquisition candidates.

and transportation. The capture costs
are applied to all sequestration and
value options. Food grade and industrial grade CO2 also require liquefaction
and transportation. Cost data for CO2
used for enhanced oil and gas recovery
or gas storage do not include transportation. The operator of the reservoir
typically pays these costs.
The final cost of sequestration, including capture is $43-117/ton of CO2,
depending on the sequestration technology applied. Food-grade, industrial
grade, and other value options are profitable, valued between $5 and $45/ton
of CO2 captured and sold. Costs do not

From the Subscribers Only area of

Gas-price relief,
if not reshaping,
seen at meeting
Setting offers important context to
predictions of near-term gains for recently
abysmal gas prices in the US.
Such a message naturally receives a
warm greeting from struggling developers
of unconventional gas resources. But the
greeting comes with irony.
Success of those developers is part of
the problem. At PennWell Corp.’s Unconventional Gas International Conference

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

& Exhibition in Fort Worth, Advanced Resources International Pres. Vello Kuuskraa
showed why this is so.
Development of gas-bearing coalbeds,
tight sands, and shales has put US production capacity on a strong growth trend for
the first time in a decade.
While tight sands still dominate unconventional gas production, the main
growth is in shales, output from which has
quadrupled in 5 years, Kuuskraa said.
The supply surge coincides with a
demand decline occasioned by economic
recession, pushing average wellhead
prices to $3.43/Mcf in July from more than
$10/Mcf a year earlier, according to the Energy Information Administration. But two
analysts at the conference offered comfort.
David Pursell, managing director and
head of macro research at Tudor, Pickering & Holt, predicted the gas price will
rebound to $7.50/Mcf next year and settle
into a longer-term range of $6-6.50/Mcf.
And Don Warlick, president of Warlick
International, said demand recovery will
move gas prices back to the $6/Mcf neighborhood by the end of first-quarter 2010.
An audience member offered the intuition that, just as nature abhors a vacuum,
economic laws won’t allow gas to trade
indefinitely at a steep energy-equivalent
discount to oil.
And during a panel discussion, Harvey
Klingensmith, president of Stone Mountain
Resources, a private producer active in the
Horn River shale play of British Columbia,
opined about a new price band for gas.
This might occur, he said, as decisionmaking about drilling into aerially extensive unconventional reservoirs comes to
resemble that of manufacturing.
If he’s right, unconventional gas will
have reshaped more than development
technologies for hydrocarbon resources.
And if the new shape means an end to
300% price swings, who’s to argue?
For most producers in a tough year,
though, predictions about $6-7/Mcf gas
sometime in 2010 may feel like hope
enough for now.

M a r k e t

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

Deutsche Bank alters popular commodity fund
In a recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Deutsche
Bank AG said it will change the composition of its $3.3 billion PowerShares DB
Commodity Index Tracking Fund (DBC) to become more diversified and to comply
with position limits imposed by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
That includes reducing some of its previous exposure on West Texas Intermediate on the New York Mercantile Exchange and adding North Sea Brent crude
on the IntercontinentalExchange Inc. to the six commodities it currently tracks.
That will be its first investment in a non-US energy commodity. DBC also will add
natural gas and reformulated blend stock for oxygenate blending (RBOB) while
reducing its exposure to heating oil. The changes should be effective Oct. 30.
“This should translate in the liquidation of about 8,000 WTI contracts and the
buying of about 6,000 Brent contracts, the liquidation of about 3,000 heating oil
contracts and the buying of about 5,000 gasoline contracts,” said Olivier Jakob at
Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland. He expects Deutsche Bank to effect the changes by
Oct. 19 or earlier “through its trading desks.” The fund currently owns November
contracts for WTI and heating oil.
“These changes are provoked by the CFTC revocation (effective at the end of
October) of the position exemption previously given to Deutsche. The Deutsche
move to a broader composition however means that its commodity index is losing
some of the traits that made it different [from] other indices as it becomes just another very broad index (up to now it was concentrated in only six commodities),”
Jakob said.
He said, “We are approaching the time where more commodity indices will
announce their commodity weights for 2010, and it will be interesting to see if
they follow Deutsche in moving more of the crude weights towards the Brent ICE
contract.”
The flagship of Deutsche Banks commodity services family of funds, the DBC
enters into long futures contracts and collateralizes those contracts with US
3-month Treasury bills. It provides investors with broadly diversified exposure to
the returns of the commodities markets, which have historically allowed investors
to diversify their stock and bond portfolios.
The CFTC earlier instructed Deutsche Bank to reduce positions in corn and
wheat futures through its $2.2 billion PowerShares DB Agriculture Fund (DBA). It
also revoked previous exemptions allowing the two funds to exceed position limits
on agricultural products.
War with Iran?
Analysts in the Houston office of Raymond James & Associates Inc. said Oct.
5, “Based upon the recent political rhetoric, we now think the risk of an Iranian oil
supply interruption is meaningfully higher than it was a few months ago. In fact,
we now believe there is better than a 50% probability that some type of military
confrontation with Iran will occur in the course of the next 12 months.”
The analysts noted an Oct. 3 article in the New York Times citing “a leaked
internal report from the International Atomic Energy Agency that says Iran has
essentially worked out all of its technical issues to build a nuclear weapon.” The
only remaining step, it said, is enriching a sufficient quantity of weapons-grade
uranium, which Western intelligence sources speculate could be just a matter of
months if enrichment continues at the current pace.
The Times article said conclusions of the report by IAEA experts are tentative
but go “well beyond the public positions” taken by the US and others. Earlier US
President Barack Obama joined representatives from Russia, China, France, the
UK, and Germany in talks with Iranian officials in Geneva, where he said: “We have
made it clear that we will do our part to engage the Iranian government on the
basis of mutual interests and mutual respect, but our patience is not unlimited.”
Raymond James analysts said, “In the past 2 weeks, the risk of an Iranian oil
supply disruption has increased sharply while the oil markets seem to have completely ignored the potential change to the global oil supply-demand equation.
Normally during geopolitical crises involving the Middle East, oil prices take notice
well before military action actually begins.
“This was the case, for example, in the run-up to war with Iraq in 2003. In fact,
the same was true in early 2006, when Iran announced the end of its moratorium
on nuclear enrichment. But here we are, in the midst of what some are calling ‘a
Cuban Missile Crisis in slow motion,’ with the Iranian regime playing hardball and
tensions palpably rising in the region and the oil market just yawns,” they said.

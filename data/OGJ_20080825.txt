COVER
Saudi Arabian Basic Industries Corp.’s (SABIC) Ibn Rushd plant,
Yanbu, produces aromatics, purified terephthalic acid, and other
petrochemicals from ethylene glycol and butane. Ibn Rushd, a joint
venture of SABIC (47%) and regional private investors, started
up in 1995.The Middle East, in the next few years, will add
considerable refining and petrochemical capacity. A special report
on Middle East processing begins on p. 42 with an analysis of how
rising gasoline demand will justify grassroots refineries being built
there.The second article, p. 48, describes the unprecedented wave
of petrochemical capacity that will start up in the Middle East by
year 2012. Photo from SABIC.

Enterprise, partners outline Texas port system
Enterprise Products Partners LP, Teppco Partners LP, and Oiltanking Holding Americas Inc. have formed a joint venture to design,
construct, own, and operate a Texas offshore oil port and pipeline
system to move waterborne oil to refining centers along the upper
Texas Gulf Coast. Subject to regulatory approvals and permitting,
the partners intend to have the system in service by fourth-quarter
2010.
The Texas Offshore Port System (TOPS) project would include
an offshore port about 36 miles from Freeport, Tex., a subsea export pipeline landing near Freeport, two onshore storage facilities
with capacity for 5.1 million bbl of oil, and an onshore distribution system.
Plans include a total of 160 miles of pipeline capable of moving
1.8 million b/d. The partners will be able to expand the system
with construction of additional offshore facilities.
TOPS initial design calls for two single-point mooring buoys in
about 115 ft of water capable of offloading 100,000 bbl/hr.
The TOPS pipeline system would extend from the offshore port
to Freeport 49 miles along the Texas Gulf Coast to a planned 3.9
million bbl oil storage facility in Texas City, Tex. From there, the
pipeline would connect to existing oil pipeline systems serving
Texas City and Houston Ship Channel refineries.
A separate but complementary component of TOPS involves
construction of a 75-mile pipeline extending from Texas City to a
1.2-million bbl storage facility near Port Arthur, Tex. (bringing the
system to its 5.1 million bbl storage capacity).
This storage facility would connect to area refineries and other
facilities via pipeline and would also be able to deliver crude from
existing Texas City docks and storage facilities to Port Arthur-Beaumont refineries.
Long-term supply contracts with Motiva Enterprises LLC and an
affiliate of ExxonMobil Corp. total about 725,000 b/d and provide
the financial underpinning for the project.
Enterprise ascribes demand for TOPS to planned refinery expansions along the upper Texas Gulf Coast expected to add about
425,000 b/d of capacity beginning in 2010, as well as expected
increases in general ship traffic at onshore ports. Among current
expansion projects is Motiva’s Port Arthur refinery expansion,
which will add 325,000 b/d of capacity in 2010 (OGJ, Apr. 28,
2008, p. 20) and Valero’s 90,000 b/d expansion, also in Port Arthur, and expected to be complete by second-quarter 2011 (OGJ,
Aug. 18, 2008, Newsletter).
Enterprise sees TOPS as offering an economic and safe alternative to increased lightering or ship channel transits as this increased
demand is met. TOPS would be able to accommodate ultralarge

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

crude carriers (ULCCs) transporting as much as 3 million bbl of
crude.
Affiliates of Enterprise, Teppco, and Oiltanking each have one
-third ownership in the joint venture and expect to invest about
$600 million each in the project.
Petroport Inc., Corpus Christi, Tex., proposed an offshore crude
port near Freeport in 1993 (OGJ, Sept. 27, 1993, p. 32), but this
project never came to fruition. The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, 18
miles south of Grand Isle, La., in 110 ft of water uses three singlepoint mooring buoys and is the only US port currently capable of
offloading ULCCs.

Nigeria relinquishes Bakassi to Cameroon
Nigeria has ceded control over the potentially oil-rich Bakassi
Peninsula to Cameroon amid threats from armed groups protesting
the transfer.
The handover ceremony in Nigeria’s Calabar, marked by ceremonial flag swapping, ends a territorial dispute that has almost
triggered war in the past. The event was relocated from the peninsula’s main town because of security concerns.
Bakassi is a 1,600 km border area that juts into the Gulf of
Guinea (OGJ, Sept. 13, 2004, Newsletter). The majority of the population living in the peninsula are Nigerian fishermen and their
families.
In 2002, the International Court of Justice ruled that Nigeria
should relinquish control following the border dispute between
the countries. According to Nigerian press reports, a spokesman
for Nigeria’s President Umaru Yar’Adua said that although the handover was painful, Nigeria was bound by international commitments to keep its promise to hand back the peninsula in the name
of peace.
However, legal fighting, political disputes, and gunfire have delayed the process. Opponents in Nigeria argued that parliament, as
required by the constitution, never ratified the agreement to hand
over the territory. About 50 people died last year in clashes related
to this issue, according to Nigerian reports.
Analysts say that Cameroon will need to stabilize security before
it can begin oil exploration.
United Nations Chief Ban Ki-moon described the transfer as a
triumph for the rule of law. “Beginning with the withdrawal of
Nigerian troops from Bakassi 2 years ago and culminating in this
ceremony, the case of the Bakassi Peninsula has proven the viability of a peaceful and legal settlement of border disputes when it
is done with the full support of the international community and
in a spirit of mutual respect, good neighborliness, and cooperation.” ✦

Nexen to fast-track Blackbird oil development

Petrobank eyes Muskwa-Evie, Montney shale gas

Nexen Petroleum Inc., Calgary, has suspended its Blackbrid well
as a future producer in the UK North Sea after a drillstem test indicated an average of 3,800 b/d of oil production potential, with the
oil flowing through a 34⁄64-in. choke.
The well, drilled on Block 20/2a, 6 km south of Nexen-operated Ettrick field, struck 111 ft of net pay in multiple zones.
Nexen described the oil as being high quality in good quality
reservoir sands. It plans to fast-track the development as a subsea
tieback to the nearby Ettrick floating production, storage, and offloading vessel.
Charlie Fischer, Nexen’s president and chief executive, said:
“Satellite discoveries such as Blackbird allow for quick and cost
effective tie-backs to existing infrastructure, which generates incremental value.”
Nexen is operator of the Blackbird well with a 79.73% working
interest. Other coventurers include Bow Valley Energy Ltd. 12% and
Atlantic Petroleum 8.27%.

Petrobank Energy & Resources Ltd., Calgary, has acquired 25
sections of land in Northeast British Columbia to pursue gas in
the Devonian Muskwa and Evie shales of the Horn River basin and
plans to drill its first vertical well in early 2009.
Petrobank also signed a definitive agreement to buy for $53 million an undisclosed private company that owns 15 sections with
strong horizontal development potential in the Triassic Montney formation in the Monias area northwest of Dawson Creek. Consulting
engineers assessed the recoverable potential at 148 bcf. Two vertical
wells produce 150 Mcfd, and the properties include a 5 MMcfd gas
plant. Petrobank plans to complete the acquisition by Oct. 2 and drill
two horizontal Montney wells on the lands in 2008.

Bankers eyes higher Ardmore Woodford gas ﬂow
The newly separated US unit of Bankers Petroleum Ltd., Calgary,
reported a sharply higher flow rate at its fifth horizontal well in
Tishomingo field in the Ardmore basin in southern Oklahoma.
The company is making several efforts to increase capacity for
its gas sales from the area.
Initial test rate at the Dunn 2-1H well was 4.8 MMcfd of gas
equivalent in what the company supposed is the result of an unspecified modified hydraulic fracturing technique. The wells produce gas-condensate and oil from Mississippian-Devonian Woodford shale.
BNK Petroleum Inc., the US subsidiary, drilled and cased eight
wells in the quarter ended June 30 and spud four others. The company, whose 4 MMcfd of gas equivalent of output from the play is
limited by facilities constraints, plans to stimulate more wells as it
obtains more gas processing capacity.
It installed a gathering system to connect the Brock wells to a
processing plant that was completed in late March and is waiting
on parts for a tap upgrade to remove throughput restrictions into a
pipeline operated by Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America.
Other work includes laying of gathering lines and addition of
two compressors.
A temporary plant is being set up that will allow the company
to hike production to as much as 20 MMcfd of gas equivalent, and
processing agreements are complete with Atlas Pipeline and pending with Chesapeake Energy Corp.
Bankers’ leasehold is in Carter, Murray, and Johnston counties
(OGJ, May 26, 2008, p. 34).

Canadian Superior’s Bounty ﬁnds gas off Trinidad
Canadian Superior has reported a major natural gas discovery
on Intrepid Block 5(c) off eastern Trinidad and Tobago. The company said the discovery, which it said has the potential for as much
as 2.6 tcf of natural gas in place, was made by the Bounty exploration well.
Bounty was drilled to 17,360 ft TD, encountering gas-bearing
horizons, with the main targeted zone in the well encountering
about 200 ft of pay. According to the company, initial test results
indicate that Bounty is capable of producing 200 MMcfd from
this high-pressure zone. Production testing equipment capacity
was maximized during testing, restricting flow to a stabilized 60
MMcfd of gas, with a flowing bottomhole pressure of 7,186 psi.
The Bounty find is the second gas discovery Canadian Superior
and its partners have made this year on Intrepid Block 5(c), which
lies 60 miles off eastern Trinidad. The first discovery, by the Victory
well, was estimated to contain 600 bcf-1.2 tcf of gas.
Canadian Superior Chief Executive Craig McKenzie said the
Bounty discovery “in combination with our extensive 3D seismic
data in the area, appears to exceed 7,000 acres in size.”
Production potential, he said, “compares favorably with production from the nearest analogous field, Dolphin Deep,” where each
of the two wells produce at about 150 MMcfd, he said. “We plan
to move forward expeditiously with appraisal and development
drilling and production.” Operations are under way to demobilize
the testing equipment and move the Kan Tan IV semisubmersible
drilling rig to spud a third exploration well, the Endeavour, on the
block by the end of August.
Canadian Superior is paying 262⁄3% of the Block 5(c) exploration program costs to maintain a 45% working interest in the
block, with partners BG International Ltd. paying 40% for a 30%
working interest and Challenger Energy Corp. paying 331⁄3% for a
25% working interest. ✦

start its offshore installation in mid-2010 using the deepwater
construction vessel “Balder.” The welding technology will be supported by Pipeline Technique Ltd., HMC’s recently acquired welding specialist in Scotland.
This contract is the largest in HMC’s history and covers engineering, procurement, construction, installation, and the testing
of pipe-in-pipe production flowlines, service flowlines as well as
vertical riser systems. The award is the first of possibly four similar
projects off Angola.
HMC will move its deepwater construction vessel to West Africa
and expects to develop other projects in this region. The company
will establish local offices, an Angolan Marine Transport Co., and an
integrated marine construction support base and multijoint yard to
contribute to sustainable Angolan development.
The majority of the onshore fabrication work will be performed
by Angolan yards, said Steve Preston, an HMC executive vice-president.

Queensland oil shale project still in the wings
Brisbane-based oil shale hopeful Queensland Energy Resources
Ltd. (QER) has shunned the Alberta-Taciuk Processor (ATP) revolving kiln oil shale processing technology in favor of the Paraho II
technology to develop its vast oil shale deposits along Queensland’s
east coast.
The company chose Paraho II following assessment of 63 other possible technologies and noting the lessons learned from the
company’s now decommissioned ATP demonstration plant on the
Stuart deposit near Gladstone. This plant is being dismantled, and
obsolete components are being sold.
QER acquired most of the assets of the original operator Southern Pacific Petroleum (SPP) from the liquidator in 2004 and shut
down the Stuart plant because it did not meet environmental and
operating performance standards despite SPP’s having produced
and sold more than 1 million bbl of shale oil from the deposit
during 2000-03.
QER decided the ATP could not be scaled up to commercial
scale production, whereas it believes the Paraho II technology can
be a commercial proposition.
Paraho II technology has been tested with more than 8,000

NPRA releases reﬁning, storage capacity report
US refiners have continued to add capacity despite soaring oil
prices and shrinking margins, the National Petrochemical & Refiners Association said as it released its annual refining and storage
capacity report.
Domestic refining capacity increased 0.86% during 2007, 4.1%
over the last 5 years and 8.2% over the last 9 years, NPRA said, citing data compiled by the US Energy Information Administration.
“Refiners have continued to increase capacity to help meet consumer demand for a reliable supply of fuels and other petroleumbased products,” NPRA Pres. Charles T. Drevna said.
The report indicated that as of Jan. 1 there were 149 operable
US refineries, excluding Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, with

tonnes of samples of Queensland oil shale (which is mined by
open cut methods).
QER says the deposits, collectively known as the McFarlane oil
shale after the original and long-time chairman and champion of
the SPP attempts to commercialize them, have the potential to produce 1.6 billion bbl of shale oil over the next 40 years.
If the shale oil is produced, it will supplement Australia’s fast
depleting deposits of conventional oil reserves.

Ascent Resources begins gas output in Hungary
Ascent Resources PLC, London, has begun natural gas production from its PEN-104 well in the Peneszlek area of the Nyirseg
permits in eastern Hungary.
Initial production of 48,000 cu m/day was increased over a few
days to a target of 85,000 cu m/day.
PetroHungaria KFT originally drilled the PEN-104 discovery
well in 2006. Gas production, following metering at the newly
constructed PEN-104 facility, is transported by pipeline to the MOL
gas processing facility at Hajduszoboszlo, 50 km from the well,
Ascent said.
The company will shoot 3D seismic over the permits to delineate other gas reservoirs within the vicinity. Two wells in the
survey area previously tested gas but have not been put into production.
Ascent also is investigating whether it should redevelop Peneszlek field, which produced gas during 1983-91.
The company has a 45.23% stake in Peneszlek through its equity interest in PetroHungaria KFT. Other partners are DualEx 37.5%,
Geomega 8%, Leni Gas & Oil 7.27%, and Swede Resources 2%.
Ascent managing director Jeremy Eng said the gas would help
to meet demand “on the domestic market where over 70% of gas
consumed is imported.”
Ascent Resources has sold a 15% stake in the Szolnok gas exploration project to existing partner Rohol-Aufsuchungs Aktiengesellschaft, which now holds 59.5% interest from purchases of interests from other partners. Following the sale Ascent’s interest in the
Szolnok project has dropped to 12.5% from 27.5%.
The partners will drill two exploration wells in the Kunstmarten
3D seismic acquisition area, and they will shoot additional 3D seismic nearby. ✦

million b/sd.
“To continue to meet consumer demand, we must be assured
of an adequate, affordable supply of crude oil, and that means expanding domestic exploration and production,” Drevna said. “The
American public overwhelmingly supports domestic production
given the great strides the oil and gas community has made over
the last several decades in the way of cleaner, safer technologies,”
he said.
“Ours is a modern, innovative industry prepared to meet tomorrow’s challenges, and policymakers should understand the
implications for the consumer in restricting domestic production

Gate LNG terminal adds supplier, plans to expand
E.On Ruhrgas AG has agreed to send 3 billion cu m/year of regasified LNG through the Gate LNG terminal in the Netherlands starting
in second-half 2011 and will acquire a stake in the facility.
E.On will market the gas in northwest Europe. This is the fourth
supply agreement that the Gate LNG project partners have secured;
others include Dong Energy, EconGas, and Essent, which have committed to a total throughput of 12 billion cu m/year.
As part of its agreement, E.On Ruhrgas will acquire a 5% equity
stake in the Gate facility, which is the first LNG import terminal
under construction in the Netherlands.
“With the supply of LNG by E.On Ruhrgas, the total capacity
of 540,000 cu m of the three envisaged tanks has been fully contracted,” said Vopak NV, a Gate LNG terminal partner. “To accommodate the additional incoming LNG carriers, Gate terminal will

build a second jetty and install the required additional equipment,”
Vopak reported. It will pay for the new terminal facilities by raising
additional external financing within the coming months. With the
expansion, total throughput capacity would rise to 16 billion cu
m/year from its initial capacity of 12 billion cu m/year.
Gasunie and Vopak together hold an 80% stake in the terminal,
with each of the four supply partners holding 5%.

Gorgon JV plans Barrow Island gas plant
The Chevron Australia-led Gorgon Joint Venture, now developing the vast Gorgon area gas fields off Western Australia for LNG
exports, has committed to including a 300 terajoules/day domestic gas processing plant alongside the LNG facilities planned for
Barrow Island.
Chevron says the JV will carry out final investment decision for
the plant with the LNG project. Plans call for gas to be brought on
stream for domestic use about the time the JV commissions the
LNG project’s third (of three) 5 million tonnes/year LNG train.
The JV brought the plant proposal to the table earlier than expected and says this will increase the number of supply points for
domestic gas into Western Australia.
In response, the Western Australian government has welcomed
the move and says Gorgon gas will increase the state’s gas supply by
30% and provide further supply diversity to the local gas market,
which has been sorely tested by disruptions caused by the explosion and fire at Apache Energy’s facilities on Varanus Island June 3.
The Gorgon JV comprises Chevron Corp., Royal Dutch Shell
PLC, and ExxonMobil Corp. ✦

EITI reporting
The advice of Mara V.J. Senn and
Rachel Frankel in “Firms can avoid EITI,
FCPA pitfalls” (OGJ, July 21, 2008,
p. 20) gives short shrift to the legitimate concerns of the citizens of many
resource-rich countries and runs counter
to evolving practice among countries
and companies to use more disaggregated reporting under the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
(EITI). While it is true that EITI does
not require disaggregated reporting,
disaggregation prevents free-riding and
improves the climate of accountability
in the extractive sector—a chief goal
of EITI and other efforts to address the
so-called “paradox of plenty.” Countries
such as Nigeria and Mongolia are already requiring disaggregated reporting
under EITI, and a number of extractive
companies already unilaterally report
their payments to governments, country
by country and broken down by type of
payment. Apparently, these companies
have concluded that the benefits of such
disclosure outweigh any perceived risks,
legal or otherwise.
Obviously, the authors write with
the lawyerly objective of helping clients
minimize legal risk. But even from this
narrow perspective, we question some
of their conclusions. The authors argue
that disaggregated reporting could give
rise to heightened Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA) scrutiny in the case
of discrepancies between reported company payments and country receipts but
then acknowledge that FCPA investigations of large international companies
are still possible with aggregated reporting in the case of significant discrepancies. Where a company makes no improper payments and accurately reports,
disaggregated reporting offers the best
protection from FCPA scrutiny; with aggregated reporting, a large international
company could more easily be swept up
into an investigation simply because of
the actions of less-scrupulous companies
in the same aggregated reporting pool.
Disaggregated reporting is thus preferable not only from an economic development and accountability perspective but
from a legal risk perspective as well.

Although the oil market has lost nearly 1
million b/d of strategic transportation capacity,
the price of crude oil is falling. Something has
changed.
Only a few months ago, a mere rumor about
disruption to that much oil movement would have
panicked traders and sent the crude price upward.

Since the early 2000s oil prices have
more than tripled (Fig. 1). Prices reflect
not only increasing demand and decreasing supply but broader macroeconomic and geopolitical changes such as
rising exploration and production costs,
the falling value of the US dollar, the
reemergence of “resource nationalism,”
inadequate refining capacity, and an aging labor force.
In addition, another issue has become apparent:
The world likely will grow
more, not less dependent
on oil supplies from the
Middle East.
Because high oil prices
have posed serious financial challenges to many people in consuming countries, some policymakers
and analysts have blamed oil companies
and producing countries for the current
economic slowdown.
A confrontational approach arising from these circumstances is not a
beneficial tactic for dealing with high
prices, however. Rather than portraying oil producers as scapegoats for the
global economic malaise, policymakers can better achieve stable oil prices
and markets by directing international

efforts towards promoting transparency
and consolidating cooperation between
producers and consumers.

Supply-demand imbalance

The imbalance between supply and
demand has been the driving force
behind the soaring oil prices. Unlike
the supply-interruption oil shocks of
1973-74 and 1979-80, the current one
is a demand-driven surge, fueled by
strong Asian consumption.
In 2008 crude oil prices exceeded
the all-time inflation-adjusted high of
$99.04/bbl reached in April 1980 (see
table).1 The oil market has been moving
away from an almost 2-decade equilibrium into uncharted territory. A close

According to BP PLC’s most recent
report, oil prices have been on an upward path for more than 6 years.2 Even
if prices drop back somewhat in the
coming months and years, they are not
likely to go back to the $20s or $30s
levels. More realistically, there is a new
“floor” or “plateau” that has yet to be
determined.

factors have contributed, in different
degrees, to the surge in oil prices:
• Oil companies have had to contend with
rising costs across the industry. Costs for
developing a new oil field have more
than doubled since the early 2000s. For
example, a deepwater drillship might
have cost $125,000/day to rent in
2004. In 2008, it commands more than
$600,000/day.10
• Refining historically has not been very
profitable. The recent oil costs to refiners
are shown in Fig. 2. Through much of
the 1990s, refining profit margins were
not sufficiently large to generate much
interest in the construction of new
facilities. Instead, efforts were made in
the US to expand the capacity of existing refineries, a phenomenon known
as “capacity creep,” which contributed
an additional 1.5 million b/d capacity
since the early 1990s.7
Europe has a mixed refinery outlook.
Although Europe overall is relatively
balanced in total oil products, there is a
chronic imbalance between the supply
and demand of individual products.8
In Asia, major new refineries are being
built or are in the planning stage.
Several oil-producing countries
recently have sought to expand their
refining capacity. In 2006 Saudi Aramco
announced plans to build two major
refineries, one in a joint venture with
Total SA in Jubail and the other with
ConocoPhillips at Yanbu.9
• The “missing generation” or aging work force
will retire, resulting in a shortage of knowledgeable
personnel.11 The period of low oil prices
that lasted from the mid-1980s to the
early 2000s provided few incentives for
professionals and workers, at almost
all levels, to enter the oil industry. The
shortage of a young, dynamic, and
experienced labor force is not likely to
abate in a few months or a few years.
The oil industry needs to remain competitive with other industries to attract
qualified engineers, geologists, and
other workers and to replace the retiring generation with a new one.
• Over the last several years the value of the
US dollar has deteriorated relative to other currencies. Concern over the future of the US

economy and the long-term sustainability of the US fiscal and trade deficits
all contributed to this depreciation.
The weakening dollar, in conjunction
with rising inflation and concern over
a possible collapse in the value of other
financial investment vehicles related to
real estate and other markets, has compelled investors seeking refuge to move
their financial assets to oil and other
commodities funds, thereby boosting
prices further. The steady decline of the
US dollar means a similar decline in the
purchasing power of oil exporters.
• Resource nationalism is on the rise, affecting the internal structure of the oil industry.
In OPEC countries and elsewhere, oil
production was wholly or mainly taken
over by state-owned companies in the
1970s and 1980s.12 Today these national
companies continue to dominate the
industry, holding nearly 80% of global
oil reserves and providing the bulk of
world production. Their performance
in exploration and production has
been generally affected by civil unrest,
government interference, corruption,
inefficiency, and the diversion of capital
to social welfare.13
Petroleum demand is relatively price
inelastic, particularly in the short term.
Changes in energy consumption patterns do not occur easily, and it takes
a long time and sustained high prices
to persuade energy consumers to alter
22

the way they use oil and other sources
of energy. The experience of the last several years suggests that where markets
are allowed to operate, they do work.
Demand for oil has declined or slowed
in response to high prices.

The supply side
A key factor contributing to high
prices has been the inability of producers, particularly non-OPEC ones, to
keep pace with growth in global oil
consumption. Despite soaring oil prices, crude output from nations outside
OPEC has remained essentially flat since
the mid-2000s, defying the normal link
between high prices and increased production. Sluggish investment and aging
fields have crimped crude production in
the North Sea, Russia, and Mexico.
The long period of low prices (mid1980s-early 2000s) contributed to a
broad underinvestment in both upstream
and downstream sectors. When prices
started the upward trend, some oil
companies were more willing to return
money to the shareholders than to invest
in new opportunities. Meanwhile OPEC
producers were initially hesitant to commit substantial investments before being
assured that the growth in demand and
rise in prices were sustainable.14
Russia, the world’s second largest
oil producer and exporter, has faced
tremendous problems maintaining its

production level since the mid-2000s.
Massive development in Western Siberia
allowed Soviet oil production to peak
(about 12.5 million b/d) in the late
1980s.
Economic and political turmoil that
accompanied the collapse of the Soviet
Union led to the fall of production to
about 6 million b/d in 1996. Since
then, privatization of the oil industry
and utilization of foreign investment
and technology have contributed to a
steady rise of the country’s oil production. This massive production, however,
has slowed since 2005.15
Several factors contributed to this
stagnation, including restrictions on
foreign investment (the renationalization or deprivatization of the oil industry) and the aging Siberian fields.
Mexico, another major non-OPEC
producer and exporter, has experienced
a steady decline of its oil production
in recent years. This decline is due
largely to the peak of production from
supergiant Cantarell field. State-owned
Petroleos Mexicano (Pemex) holds a
monopoly on oil production in the
country and lacks the necessary funding for exploration and investment to
reverse the production decline.16
The Russian and Mexican outlooks
underscore IEA’s forecast that non-OPEC
production will likely level off by the
middle of the 2010s. Meanwhile, the
agency projects that OPEC’s share of
world oil supply will jump to 52% by
2030 from 42% in 2007.17
IEA also underscores the significance
of the Middle East and North Africa
(MENA) region in meeting the world’s
growing demand for oil. It forecasts
that MENA’s share of world oil production will rise to 44% in 2030 from 35%
in 2004.18
OPEC members’ contributions to
world production and the challenges
they face vary from one case to another.
For example, Indonesia, a member since
1962, decided to terminate its membership in the organization by yearend.19
The country’s production has fallen
to less than half the peak it reached in
the early 1990s because of aging oil

fields. Indeed, Jakarta has been a net oil
importer since 2004.
Another two members, Iraq and Nigeria, face domestic security challenges.
Their future production depends to a
great extent on overcoming these challenges and to their ability to improve
political stability.
Thus, the MENA region has been and
is projected to continue to be the most
influential player on the production
side of the oil equation. In addition, the
fact that oil revenues represent the main
source of income for most MENA producers has underscored their interests
in the stability of the global oil market.
While MENA producers are reaping
record profits, they are concerned that
soaring prices might eventually dampen
economic growth and lead to global
recession, which would, in time, reduce
demand. (Signs of this scenario are already in place in several major consuming markets.)
Furthermore, skyrocketing oil prices
make alternative fuels more attractive,
threatening the long-term prospects of
the oil-based economy. Thus, supporting high prices would be like “killing
the goose that lays the golden egg.” In
short, excessively high oil prices are
likely to harm the long-term interests
of major producers as much as those of
major consumers. Little wonder the two
sides share a common interest in restoring a sense of stability in the global oil
market and in containing the volatility
of prices.

Confrontation vs. teamwork
In May 2008 the US House of Representative passed HR 6074 bill, which
would have created a new oil antitrust
task force within the Department of
Justice and would have given the DOJ
authority to sue foreign oil cartels for
violating US antitrust laws. The Senate,
however, rejected the bill a few weeks
later. These actions by the US Congress
highlight the deep uncertainty in the
US and around the world on the right
approach to address soaring oil prices.
Instead of this confrontational approach, major producers, consumers,

and oil companies have sought to lay
the foundation for transparency and
cooperation among all players in the industry. The move to establish a dialogue
between consumers and producers
gained momentum in the early 1990s.
At the initiative of Presidents
Francois Mitterand of France and
Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela,
major producers from OPEC and major
consumers from IEA held a seminar
in Paris in 1991. In this initial meeting, representatives from the two sides
discussed issues of mutual concern such
as economic and industrial cooperation.
Their discussion helped to alleviate earlier mistrust that had characterized the
global oil market in previous decades.
Since then, meetings between the two
sides have been held on a regular basis.20 These meetings, known as International Energy Forums (IEF), developed
from a ministerial seminar and workshop to become the largest recurring
global gathering of energy ministers.21
When Saudi Arabia hosted the
seventh IEF meeting, in 2000, thenCrown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abd al-Aziz
proposed to establish a secretariat
in Riyadh for the IEF. The proposed
International Energy Forum Secretariat
(IEFS) was officially endorsed by the
eighth ministerial meeting in Japan in
2002 and started working in Riyadh in
December 2003.
IEFS’s executive board consists
of representatives from producing
and consuming countries, as well as
both IEA and OPEC. IEF and IEFS have
contributed to a growing awareness of
long-term common interests among all
major parties in the oil industry.
The Joint Oil-Data Transparency
Initiative (JODI) was launched in June
2001 to assess the quantity, quality,
and timeliness of basic monthly oil
data. Currently, more than 90 countries
representing more than 90% of global
oil supply and demand are submitting
data to JODI. The data cover production,
demand, and stocks of seven categories: crude oil, liquefied petroleum gas,
gasoline, kerosine, diesel oil, fuel oil,
and total oil.22

Parallel to the IEF gatherings, IEA
and OPEC have held a series of joint
workshops since the early 2000s, which
demonstrates a further strengthening in
the dialogue and cooperation between
the two organizations. The first two
workshops concentrated on oil investment prospects. The third one, held in
Kuwait City in May 2005, focused on
the economic prospects for the MENA
region and its energy supply and demand prospects. In May 2006 a fourth
joint workshop was organized in Oslo,
where participants discussed global oil
demand.23
The steady rise in oil prices since the
early 2000s has further intensified the
efforts for transparency and cooperation. Heads of state and government
of OPEC members held a third summit in Riyadh in November 2007. In
the Riyadh Declaration, OPEC members agreed on three themes: stability
of global energy markets; energy for
sustainable development; and energy
and environment. They underscored
the interrelationships between global
security of petroleum supply and the
security and predictability of demand.
They also pledged to renew efforts to
bridge the development gap and make
energy accessible to the world’s poor
while protecting the environment.24
In June of this year all major players in the oil industry held a meeting
in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to address
rising oil prices. The joint communiqué underscored several themes, most
notably the importance of improving
the state of transparency and improving
the standards relating to the market’s
data and information quality based on
the JODI.25
Seeking to address rising fears that
future world supplies may not match
rising demand, Saudi Arabia promised
an aggressive campaign to push its
overall output capability to as much as
15 million b/d by 2018 from about
11.4 million b/d in 2008.26

of investment and production increases
will be completely fulfilled. Still, a
major achievement is that the dynamics
of global oil markets at the end of the
2000s are fundamentally different from
those of the 1970s. The underlying
consensus is that soaring oil prices are
destabilizing global energy markets and
the global economy. Ultrahigh prices
are not serving the interests of either
producers or consumers. They need to
be vigorously addressed by joint efforts
between the two sides. For the foreseeable future, the following trends are
likely to prevail:
• Oil prices are not likely to keep rising
forever. Since July oil prices have been
declining. However, the days of cheap
oil are over. Prices are highly unlikely
to go back to the $20 and $30 levels.
For oil prices to fall significantly, either
the world economy has to experience a
deep and sustained economic recession
or alternative sources have to become
commercially and environmentally
viable in a timely fashion; neither development is likely to take place in the
near future. Major industry organizations such as IEA and EIA project high
prices for the next few decades.

T E R E S T
• The energy future is not completely bleak.
There are some grounds for optimism.
At today’s prices, investment in marginal oil fields becomes attractive, as does
the development of alternative energy
sources. Prospects of expanding production in the Caspian Sea, deepwater fields
off Australia and Brazil, and in the Gulf
of Mexico are promising. Meanwhile,
global oil consumption is slowing and
in some major markets, declining. In
short, market laws are working—production, consumption, and investment
are responding to price signals.
• Alternative sources have recently proven
competitive in the industrial, commercial, and
residential sectors. In the transportation
sector, however, oil remains and is projected to continue to be the dominant
fuel. Furthermore, the MENA region’s
substantial geological and geographical advantages suggest that the world is
likely to grow more dependent on oil
supplies from the region.
Concentrated efforts to address the
region’s geopolitical issues such as terrorism and instability in Iran and Iraq
would alleviate the so-called “fear premium” and further stabilize oil markets
and prices. ✦

BP suspends Azeri oil shipments via rail to Georgia
Eric Watkins
Senior Correspondent
BP PLC has been forced to suspend
shipments of 50,000-70,000 b/d of oil
from Azerbaijan to Georgia following
the destruction of a key railroad bridge,
severing the main east-west train link
between the two countries.
“Rail exports have stopped from
Azerbaijan to Georgia,” said BP spokesman Robert Wine, adding, “There’s
been some damage along the line in
Georgia.”
Destruction of the rail link, regardless of the cause, reduced BP’s three
possible oil export routes to just one
alternative route: via the Russiandominated 100,000 b/d line extending
24

from Baku to Russia’s Black Sea port of
Novorossiisk.
Georgian officials accused Russian troops of blowing up the railway
bridge, but Russian officials denied any
involvement in the explosion, which
collapsed a 45-m section of the 220-m
bridge.
The railway line extends from Tbilisi,
through the Georgian town of Gori,
before splitting into three offshoots that
extend to the Black Sea ports of Poti and
Batumi and southwest to a point just
short of the Turkish border.

Repairs should be swift
Destruction of the line, which BP
said can carry 50,000-70,000 b/d of
Azeri oil to the port of Batumi, means

at least a temporary disruption of supplies sent to Georgia’s Black Sea terminals.
But a shipping agent in the port of
Batumi said exports of Azeri oil from
the port are unlikely to be delayed by
damage to the railway line, saying there
was just one tanker in port which could
be loaded with oil already on hand.
By the time a new tanker arrives to
be loaded, he said, the railway bridge
will be repaired and the railway line
will receive railcars with additional
cargo from Azerbaijan.
A spokesperson for Georgian Railways estimated that the key rail bridge
would be rebuilt within a week or
sooner. She said engineers, workers, and
materials have arrived from Armenia

A failure
of oil diplomacy

US

Sen. John McCain, the Republican Party’s presidential
hopeful, has underscored concerns in
the country about the viability of the
Caucasus as a secure transit corridor
for oil and gas.
Last week McCain noted that
Russia has become more aggressive
toward the now-democratic nations
that broke free of the old Soviet
empire—aggression that became
most evident with Moscow’s recent
attack on Georgia.
Georgia now stands at a strategic
crossroads, McCain said, which are
traversed in particular by the key
Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline. “If
that pipeline were destroyed or controlled by Russia,” he said, “European
energy supplies would be even more
vulnerable to Russian influence.”
McCain is doubtlessly correct in
his estimation of the situation but is
hardly the first to note the importance of the Caucasus as an energy
bridge or the potential for Russian
mischief there.

Deja vu
In February, as OGJ reported at
the time, it seemed that Washington
had finally awakened to the need for
a special kind of diplomacy in the
region—a kind of diplomacy that
would be devoted to oil.
Remember? US Secretary of State
Condoleeza Rice announced plans to
appoint a special envoy for energy
issues to deal with the use of oil and
gas for political means.
“It is a really important part of
diplomacy, in fact, I think I would
go so far as to say that some of the
politics of energy is warping diplomacy in certain parts of the world,”
26

Rice told the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee on Feb. 12.
“I do intend to appoint, and we
are looking for, a special energy
coordinator who could especially
spend time on the Central Asian and
Caspian region,” she said.
Rice was making her pitch on
Capitol Hill in response to questions
from Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.),
who asked about progress made on
establishing such a post as called for
in legislation approved in 2007.

Oil as a weapon
Lugar was especially vexed about
Russia’s use of oil and gas as a political weapon, saying among other
things that, “Moscow continues to
use energy to extort its neighbors.”
Lugar went on to explain: “Russian foreign policy is now largely
based on maximizing the political
leverage and financial earnings of its
energy supplies and dominating the
transport of energy in Eurasia.
“Appointment of a special representative for energy would be a clear
statement of high-level US priority
for this strategically critical region,”
he said.
“Failure to demonstrate US commitment will jeopardize progress on
trans-Caspian energy cooperation,
with potentially devastating impacts on long-term US security and
economic interests in the region,”
Lugar said. Could any man or woman
sound more like a prophet than Sen.
Lugar? It seems he had a vision of the
future in describing the need for the
US to undertake serious oil diplomacy in the region.
Very clearly, it is a vision that
Washington has yet to embrace. ✦

BP’s only other export alternative
currently, the Baku-Novorossiisk line,
leaves the British company with an “unattractive option,” according to analysts,
as it requires the mixing of Azeri oil
with lower-quality Russian Urals crude.
Due to the hostilities in Georgia,
however, it remains to be seen how
soon BP will be able to lift its shutdown
of the WREP, while no definite date
has been given for the completion of
repairs on the BTC line.

BTC line repairs slow
Repairs to the BTC line in Turkey
began over the weekend, but a spokesman for Botas International Ltd., which
operates the Turkish sector of the line,
said, “It’s a step-by-step process.... We
don’t know just yet how long it will
take.”
Turkey’s energy minister Hilmi Guler
said Aug. 18 that oil transport along the
BTC might resume “in a few days” as
repairs on the line were under way, but
that view was not shared by BP spokesman Murat Lecompte, who said it is too
early to say when the pipeline could be
operational again.
Because of the disruption to its
export routes, the BP-led Azeri-ChiragGunashli oil fields in the Caspian have
cut production to about 250,000 b/d
from about 800,000 b/d.
Of more concern, however, closure
of the export routes has raised worries of Russia attempting to reassert its

control over the region, as took place
in the Soviet era. In Georgia, that would
mean Russian control of the existing
pipelines, rail routes, and ports.
The Republican presidential candidate, US Senator John McCain underlined those worries over the weekend,
saying that if the BTC line “were destroyed or controlled by Russia, Europe-

T E R E S T
an energy supplies would be even more
vulnerable to Russian influence.”
That view is partially supported by
independent analysts. According to
Simon Wardell of analyst Global Insight,
Russia is not likely to close or destroy
the existing oil export routes across the
Caucasus. To the contrary, Wardell said,
control of the existing export routes

would give Russia more power in the
negotiation of prices.
With Russian troops showing no
haste to withdraw from Georgia, despite
both sides signing a ceasefire agreement, it is too soon to tell precisely
what sorts of control, if any, Russia will
attempt to impose on the region’s oil
and gas export flows and revenues. ✦

of its electricity generation from coal
to diesel. China is also thought to have
stockpiled oil and diesel in advance of
the games to ensure there are no shortages due to the influx of participants
and spectators.” Brown and Thies said,
“Upon completion of the Olympic
Games, it is expected that the Chinese
will continue to phase out their subsidies, with the goal of eliminating them
by the end of 2009. If there is a drop in
Chinese demand following the Olympics, there will most likely be further
downward pressure on oil prices.”

Diesel, gasoline
The analysts said diesel fuel prices
came down in tandem with oil, but
strong demand from China and India
kept them solid. “One factor contributing to the strength of diesel is that refineries are configured to produce more
gasoline than diesel fuel. This configuration is based on past consumption
patterns and is making it difficult to get
enough diesel out of each barrel of oil,”
they observed.
US retail gasoline prices have hovered at a national average of $3.90/gal
after peaking at $4.12/gal in mid-July,
Brown and Thies continued. But they
added that domestic gasoline prices
haven’t kept their normal pace with
crude oil because US motorists are
driving less. “Gasoline inventories are
above seasonal norms, which is depressing refiners’ margins and holding
down capacity utilization. Some of the
downward pressure is the result of
high diesel margins. With diesel in high
demand, more barrels of oil have to
be processed, which increases gasoline
production,” they said.
Assuming that margins recover and
crude prices are steady, they suggested
that spot gasoline prices would be
around $3.13/gal by Labor Day. “However, the futures market is not showing a recovery in refiners’ margins
and currently projects spot prices at
$2.94[/gal] by Labor Day. This translates to a national average pump price
of about $3.70/gal for regular unleaded,” Brown and Thies said. ✦

A possible path
to a compromise

T

he single biggest question this
August congressional recess
remains whether compromise energy
legislation that includes opening
more of the US Outer Continental
Shelf to leasing will be seriously considered in September.
Washington observers generally
agreed by mid-August that US House
Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)
remained adamant that the OCS
question wouldn’t come to the floor
despite dropping some tantalizing
hints that it might.
They even suggested that Pelosi
told other House Democrats that
she’d take any heat for not bringing the question to a vote so they’d
be free to say what they wanted if it
would help them get reelected.
Pelosi stuck to her guns as other
House members proposed at least
two bipartisan compromises. HR
6709, which Reps. John E. Peterson (R-Pa.) and Neil Abercrombie
(D-Ha.) introduced, has more cosponsors but takes a more aggressive
approach to opening additional OCS
areas than HR 6817, which Rep. Jim
Matheson (D-Utah) offered with six
cosponsors.

Reid’s responses
Energy legislation compromise
prospects looked somewhat better in
the US Senate when Majority Leader
Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) commended
the so-called “Gang of 10” for developing their proposal and agreed to
the bipartisan group’s earlier request for a day-long energy summit.
Reid also asked Energy and Natural
Resources Committee Chairman Jeff
Bingaman (D-NM), who ran a daylong forum on oil prices on July 17,

to lead the energy summit.
When Bingaman accepted the
assignment on Aug. 4, however, he
added energy commodities regulation (which the Gang of 10 had
sidestepped) to the agenda. “We must
ensure the proper functioning of
markets for oil and gas so that prices
are not artificially high because of
excessive speculation,” he said.
Other federal lawmakers are
ready to bring up their own ideas to
modify the Gang of 10’s proposal.
Two Colorado Democrats, Sen. Ken
Salazar and Rep. Mark Udall want to
add provisions that would develop
additional domestic energy resources
much more gradually. Still, its prospects look better than either House
bill, at least initially.

Additional taxes
For industry, the Senate plan’s
biggest problem is the $30 billion of
taxes that would be used to help finance the $84 billion of investments
for new energy programs. The plan’s
approach to opening more OCS acreage is so modest that the proposal is
“light on new production and heavy
on new taxes,” the American Petroleum Institute said on Aug. 13.
“Leasing in the North Atlantic
and off the Pacific Coast would be
banned, and plentiful hydrocarbon
resources in Alaska would remain offlimits,” API Pres. Red Cavaney said.
The idea could still move forward
if new OCS activity is limited to tracts
off Virginia, North Carolina, South
Carolina, and Georgia, one lobbyist
told me, adding that it would then
need to become part of a major appropriations bill before being sent to
the House. ✦

Record-breaking Colorado lease sale still falls short
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The long-anticipated Roan Plateau lease sale netted $113.9 million,
a record for the US Bureau of Land
Management in the Lower 48, the US
Department of the Interior agency said
on Aug. 14. But the amount fell short
of what many politicians and groups in
Colorado anticipated, and they quickly
blamed each other for the results.
“For more than a year, the oil and
gas industry and some politicians have
claimed that a Roan Plateau lease sale
would generate proceeds of up to $2
billion. Today, when the bids came in
at only $114 million, we learned just
how wrong and over-exaggerated those
claims were,” Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter
said following the sale.
He and other Colorado Democrats,
including Sen. Ken Salazar and Reps.
John Salazar and Mark Udall, advocated
leasing federal land on the western
Colorado plateau in phases instead of
holding a full lease sale. “We warned
that an all-at-once lease sale would result in vastly undervalued bids. Unfortunately, these predictions turned out to
be true,” Ritter said.
But others blamed Democrats’ opposition to the sale for the lower-than-expected bids. “The efforts of antienergy
politicians took their toll in the form of
lower bids than we expected and cost
Coloradans millions of dollars by pandering to the extreme environmentalists,” said Sen. Wayne Allard (R-Colo.).
“Development on top of the plateau
is the result of a lengthy and thoughtful
planning process that has put the needs
of Colorado first,” Allard said. “It is one
of the most environmentally conscious
plans ever created, representing over 7
years of collaboration between local,
state, and federal officials. It will be
conducted in a staged, ridge-by-ridge
approach, and minimize wildlife habitat
fragmentation,” he said.

‘Dark cloud of uncertainty’
Colorado Oil & Gas Association
Pres. Meg Collins said actions by Ritter,
Udall, and Sen. Salazar were responsible
for the “disappointingly low” bonus
bids. “The dark cloud of uncertainty
cast by these elected officials and environmental groups through their lease
sale protests, lawsuits, and rulemaking
efforts grossly impact the value of the
Roan,” she said. Collins compared the
Aug. 14 sale’s average parcel price of
$2,083/acre with the $40,690/acre
paid by Marathon Oil Corp. when it
leased 8,700 acres for nearly $354 million in May 2007. “If industry believed
it could produce the full volume of
natural gas present beneath the Roan
anytime soon, values much closer to the
market comparables would have been
obtained,” she said.
BLM said 54,631 acres in 31 parcels
were leased in the latest sale. It also
broke the record for a federal oil and
gas lease sale in Colorado of $11.8 million, which was set in February 2006.
Sellmar Co., Denver, submitted the
single highest bid, nearly $25.3 million, or $11,800/acre. Vantage Energy
Piceance LLC, Englewood, Colo., won
20 of the leases with bids totaling about
$57.6 million, followed by Meadow
Ridge LLC, Denver, which won eight

leases, and Oxy USA Inc., Houston,
which won two.
The sale culminated 8 years of public
planning which involved state and local
governments, constituent groups, and
the general public in developing what
BLM said is one of the most environmentally sensitive resource management plans connected with oil and gas
leasing in the DOI agency’s history.
BLM noted that the plan confines
development at the top of the plateau
to existing road corridors, with disturbance limited to 350 acres or about
1% of the total surface there. More than
50%, or 38,470 acres, of the planning
area is stipulated for no surface occupancy. Development on top of the
plateau will occur in a staged, ridgeby-ridge process with well pads more
than a half-mile apart. Leases there will
require operators to enter into a single
federal unit, with consolidation of planning and operations under a single unit
operator.
Colorado will receive 49% of the
lease sale proceeds as well as 49% of future royalties from oil and gas production on the plateau. BLM said no money
will be dispersed until its Colorado state
office resolves protests to the sale, including those from the state and various
environmental groups. ✦

Freeport LNG applies to export gas imports
Freeport LNG Development LP is the
first US firm to request permission to
export LNG imported into its Freeport,
Tex., terminal.
It applied this month to the Department of Energy’s Office of Fossil Energy
for “blanket authorization” for shortterm exports of LNG totaling 24 bcf, or
about eight tanker cargoes, over 2 years.
Freeport LNG Vice-Pres. Bill Henry told
OGJ, “We need to do this to keep the
equipment cold and sell the excess LNG
either into the US market or export the
LNG into the [higher priced] international market.”
Due to lower prices for gas in the
US and increased domestic production
from the shale gas plays, Henry said,
“There is very little LNG scheduled into
the US for the next 12 months.” Moreover, capacity holders at the 1.5 bcfd
Freeport LNG terminal, which came
online in June, do not have a dedicated
source of supplies. Yet the terminal
still must import a minimal amount of
LNG to keep its storage and regasification equipment cooled to the proper
temperature.

With an export permit, Henry said,
imported LNG would be stored at the
terminal until a market develops either
in the US or abroad. The company emphasized it has no plans to export gas
produced in the US. The terminal has
two 3.4 bcf storage tanks.
According to Freeport LNG’s application, a minimum of 4-7 MMcfd
of natural gas from LNG imports into
the Freeport terminal would be sold
into US markets “as a result of boil-off
and other maintenance and operational
requirements at the terminal.”
Henry said upgrades, including
replacement of a check valve with a
short spool required for loading LNG
onto vessels, would be “minor” at an
estimated cost of less than $10,000 and
could be completed within weeks. The
company has not let contracts for the
project, pending DOE approval, Henry
said. It’s not yet known if other terminals
have similar plans. The Zeebrugge LNG
import terminal in Belgium recently offered to load LNG tankers, and the Kenai
LNG liquefaction plant in Alaska has a
permit to export US produced LNG. ✦

Several operators stand to benefit if
early gas flow rates from a horizontal
Cretaceous Pearsall shale well in the
Southwest Texas Maverick basin hold up.
The Pearsall shale, for decades a marginal producer in vertical wells, flowed
gas at the rate of 3.5 MMcfd with 2,500
b/d of frac fluid after a five-stage frac
job at a horizontal well in the Maverick
basin, said TXCO Resources Inc., San
Antonio.
Flowing tubing pressure
is 3,875 psi, and the flow
rates continued to rise as
the frac fluid returned, the
company said. The company
pumped 750,000 lb of sand
and 59,000 bbl of frac fluid
and had recovered only
15% of the fluid as of Aug. 7.
The gas rate later impoved to 3.8
MMcfd.
Myers 2-683H is the company’s
third horizontal Pearsall well to be frac
treated this year and the first to be successfully treated with five stages. It is
also the first Pearsall well in which the

horizontal lateral, 3,000 ft long, was
fully cased, cemented, and perforated
for limited entry, TXCO Resources said.
Two earlier horizontal wells gave up
about 1 MMcfd each after open hole
completions with multistage packers
and sleeves (see map).
The company, which has 100%
working interest in the Myers well
through completion, conducted microseismic monitoring from an offset well
during the treatment, allowing it to
observe and modify the stimulation in
real time.
The $5 million well cost included
a vertical pilot hole and the five frac
stages, and the company still plans to
run production logs.
The Myers well provided the company with valuable data that will be
used to improve frac designs on other
Pearsall wells to be drilled and fracstimulated in the future.
It was also welcome news to others
who had tried to extract commercial
gas flows from the Pearsall through
vertical wells for decades, such as in Los

They also offer some potential for increased oil production due to improved

To complete this
study, Noble and
Trimeric engineers
worked closely with production personnel, emission-control equipment vendors, environmental staff, and others to
carefully collect and analyze data on the
operations of several types of separators,
flare systems, vapor-recovery units, and
associated strategies for reducing peak
emission rates.
The work demonstrates that significant opportunities exist for improving
and optimizing VOC emission controls,
while in some cases even increasing
revenue. The valuable lessons learned
can serve as a useful resource for others
with similar needs.
Noble’s operations in the Wattenberg
field northeast of Denver are typical
of exploration and production facilities in the area. The operations produce
sweet natural gas and condensate. The
condensate’s API gravity typically ranges
from the mid-40s to the low 50s. This
article refers to condensate as oil.
The wells typically have low average
flow rates. The average production rate
from all producers in Weld County in
November 2006 was 36 Mscfd of gas
and 2.6 bo/d. Production facilities only
include separators, tanks, and emission controls. Wells at many of Noble’s
sites flow intermittently with the aid of
wellbore plunger lift. A control valve
shuts in the plunger downhole between cycles, allowing reservoir fluids
to enter the tubing above the plunger.

Steadily rising refined product

significant refinery investments in the

Iran and Saudi Arabia have substantial indigenous populations and low

basis; for these countries, the creation
of employment and supply of low-cost
energy have been priorities.
Most Middle East countries are rich
in oil or natural gas resources and are
benefiting from currently high prices;
Jordan, Lebanon, and Israel are exceptions. For Qatar and UAE, substantial
natural gas resources have displaced oil
products in the power and industrial
sectors. Iran, however, with the world’s
second-largest natural gas reserves, has
been unable to produce sufficient natural gas to satisfy internal demand.
Wars and sanctions have also shaped
the region’s refining industries. Iran and
Iraq particularly have suffered from the
limited availability of foreign technology and expertise; Iraq’s oil industry
is currently struggling to recover from

Whilst the world discusses the climate change and its consequences,
Linde has been developing concepts to significantly reduce energy
consumption and greenhouse gas emission in existing ethylene plants.
One of Linde’s innovative solutions is to replace the furnace section of a
cracker during a turnaround and thus install state-of-the-art technology in
an existing plant without any production loss.
This new Linde furnace technology reduces greenhouse gas emissions
while increasing yields and substantially improving reliability and economic efficiency.
Other innovative concepts customized to individual plant requirements are
available from Linde, the leading ethylene technology contractor.

prices in 2004 also tightened refining

Product supply tightened and refining margins increased. In particular,
increased production of heavy, sour
crudes found the refining industry with
insufficient fuel oil conversion capacity and, in some cases, desulfurization
capacity. Light product supply tightened, heavy fuel oil supply increased
and price differentials between light

between light and heavy refinery feedstocks, increased.

not occur. Investment cost inflation has
slowed the pace of capacity additions
to some extent, and demand for refined
products will continue to grow.
A key variable will be the future cost
of refining industry investments. The
refining industry is an essential part of
the world’s energy supply and, assuming that oil demand growth continues,
new investments in refining capacity
will be needed.
In most cases, these investments will
be made only if supported by adequate
returns. Poor returns would lead to a
slowdown in investment, new capacity
shortages, and an upward correction in
margins and returns. In the longer term,
high investment costs would not lead to
a lack of investment, they would simply
mean that margins had to be higher to
generate adequate returns.
This is where uncertainty about future investment costs becomes an issue.
If future investment costs were lower
than recent levels, margins needed to
support new investments would also
be lower. An investment made in a
high-cost environment could generate
disappointing returns if future investment costs were lower. In refining, as
in so many capital intensive industries,
timing can be crucial.
Regional developments will also
influence the economics of Middle East
refining investments. On the supply
side, rehabilitation and upgrading of
Iraq’s refining industry could have a significant effect, although timing is difficult to assess. Iranian refinery projects,
if implemented as announced, would
also have a major effect, particularly
with regard to the region’s gasoline
balances.
The start-up later this year of Reliance’s refinery expansion at Jamnagar in
northwest India will increase regional
gasoline supply substantially. Before
2005, Persian Gulf gasoline prices and
trade data indicated that India was the
region’s marginal supply source, but
during 2005-06 this position changed.
When Middle East import requirements increased, cost-insurance-freight
prices strengthened and Asia and Medi-

terranean Europe became the region’s
marginal suppliers. The Reliance startup will inject a large new gasoline supply stream into the region and may well
reverse the changes seen since 2005.
Overall, the Middle East refining
outlook appears sound, provided that
capacity additions are not excessive.
Global and regional growth in product
demand will support new investments,
although project timing will be important if returns are to be maximized.
The region’s current gasoline supply
deficit may encourage the development
of gasoline-oriented projects. Gasoline
market softness, however, could develop
rather quickly as a result of demand and
refining developments in Iran and India
and more widely. This suggests that
gasoline-oriented projects should be
analyzed particularly carefully. ✦

CMAI: Wave of new Mideast oleﬁns capacity coming on line
An “unprecedented” wave
of new olefins capacity is
starting up in the Middle
East, according to Chemical Market Associates Inc.
(CMAI), Houston.
“An additional 20 million tonnes of new ethylene
capacity is expected by 2012,
more than doubling current
capacity in this region,” according to Tony Potter, director of olefins studies, Europe,
Middle East, and Africa,
speaking at CMAI’s World Petrochemical
Conference in March.
Potter said that 2008 would be a
pivotal year because 9 million tonnes
of capacity will start up; this will lower
global operating rates towards bottomof-cycle conditions in 2009 (Fig. 1).
“A staggering 9 million tpy of new

In Iran, new propylene capacity is

which is designed to process a mixed

Egypt’s Oriental Petrochemicals is

scheduled to start up in 2010.

Post-2012 forecast
After 2012, Saudi Arabia will have
fewer new ethane projects. The recovery
of NGLs from Shaybah field could produce enough ethane to produce another
1 million tpy of ethylene, which, if
spread over two or three feed-flexible
crackers with ethane as a minority feedstock, could yield several million tons
of additional production, according to
Potter.
Qatar’s progress depends on the rate
of development of North field. There is
the potential for an additional ethane
cracker in Kuwait if and when its own
North field is developed. In Abu Dhabi,
there could be a Borouge 3.
In North Africa, there could be new
crackers in each of Algeria, Libya, and
Egypt.
In Iran, Olefins 11, 12, 14, 15, and
16 are planned. And in Iraq, Potter assumes that any new capacity will start
up after 2020. ✦

Outlook
Only 26% of internationally traded
gas moved as LNG in 2005 despite
worldwide LNG trade expanding at an
average 7.3%/year between 1995 and
2005.6 Eight countries exported LNG
in 1995; 13 in 2005. The number of
LNG importing countries increased to
15 from 9 during the same period. The
International Energy Agency expects
LNG trade to continue to grow by
6.6%/year, with LNG making up 50%
of internationally traded gas by 2030.7
Countries currently supplying LNG
have large gas reserves relative to current production rates, supporting the
projected expansion of LNG supply over
the next 25 years.7 The world fleet of
LNG carriers will grow to 350 ships in

New drive for well pumping operations
A new Vector drive, designed specifically for pumping applications, features
an easy-to-use operator control panel that
includes a large, high-resolution, full-color
graphics display that
is easy to read in
bright light.
The Vector VII’s
software integrates
operating information, downhole well
parameters, and
graphical data into
a common display,
eliminating the time
it takes to scroll
through several screens to retrieve data. A
digital circular ammeter is displayed on
the operator panel; therefore, the use of
a mechanical circular ammeter for chart
recording is no longer needed, the firm
notes. Twenty operating parameters are periodically sampled and stored in memory

and can be shown graphically on the
operator panel or downloaded and saved
for future analysis. Remote user interface
and monitoring and control functions are
also supported.
In addition, the Vector VII comes in
a Nema 3R-rated outdoor enclosure. All
electronic components are located inside
a sealed (Nema 4) section of the drive
enclosure with no exchange of outside
cooling air. Vector VII is suitable for arctic,
desert, and rain forest climates, operating
in temperature ranges of –40° C. to +50°

Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition
July 14 – 16, 2009
Calgary TELUS Convention Centre, Calgary, Alberta, Canada

Call for Abstracts

P R E S E N TAT I O N S S O U G H T F O R P R E M I E R I N D U S T R Y E V E N T.
Organizers of the Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference believe practices developed for Alberta’s
unconventional hydrocarbon resources help solve problems throughout the oil and gas industry.
Their commitment to advancing technology has turned the event into an inﬂuential forum for industry professionals
from a variety of operations around the world.
The conference addresses the challenges of producing, upgrading, and transporting bitumen; drilling; managing
costs; generating electricity and steam while lowering energy and water needs; controlling air and water
emissions; mitigating surface impacts; handling sulfur; recycling wastewater; capturing and sequestering carbon
dioxide; and many others.
If you have an innovation to share with a distinguished audience, the Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies
Conference would like to hear from you.
Conference organizers are accepting 150-400-word abstracts online at www.oilsandstechnologies.com.
Your abstract should summarize a non-commercial, technical presentation offering practical solutions to a problem
or set of related problems encountered by oil sands and heavy oil operators and electricity providers.
Guidelines are available at www.oilsandstechnologies.com.
Please send your abstract by October 17, 2008.

Energy backﬁres
again as tool
of foreign policy
As Arab oil exporters learned after their
targeted embargo of 1973-74, energy has its
drawbacks as a tool of foreign policy.
The US must take that point now as
it reacts to Russia’s bloody bullying of
Georgia.
No one should forget the maneuvering behind the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC)
oil pipeline and South Caucasus gas line,
which parallels BTC as far west as Erzurum,

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

Turkey.
The BTC route was not the most economical outlet for Caspian production.
But it had a geopolitical advantage: It
didn’t transit Russia, which controls other
Caspian pipelines; Iran, with which the
US for long has been at odds; or Armenia,
which has longstanding animosities with
Azerbaijan and Turkey.
The US government promoted the
pipeline aggressively, often touting the
beneﬁts of a route that avoided troublesome territory.
By that it meant Iran. The cheerleading
occurred in the early years of this decade, when the US thought it had cordial
relations with Moscow. From the US
perspective, it was easy to see avoidance
of Russian transit as an appeal mostly to
the Caspian’s formerly Soviet, non-Russian
producers.
Russia, then still economically wobbly, was powerless to stop the BTC and
South Caucasus projects, the strategically
signiﬁcant geography of which is their arc
through Georgia.
Today, only Prime Minister Vladimir Putin knows the extent to which the pipelines
motivated Russia’s march into Georgia.
But BTC has represented a palpable
rebuke to Russia since the starts of construction in 2003 and of operations in 2006.
Its role as a token of independence by formerly Soviet countries and of US inﬂuence
in what Russia calls its near-abroad must be
a long-festering irritation to the Kremlin.
And if Russia, as many expect it to do,
replaces Georgia’s West-leaning government with one that will do its bidding,
it gains control of pipelines built with something quite different in mind.
None of this excuses Russian brutality. But it would be a mistake to pretend
that the Georgian segment of the BTC
and parallel gas pipelines didn’t work as
a provocation to an authoritarian regime
newly fortiﬁed by oil money—if not an
outright prize.

OPEC cuts demand growth estimate
In its August report, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries reduced
its 2008 estimate of global economic growth to 3.9%, down from 4% from the previous month and one percentage point lower than the same period in 2007. It lowered
its 2009 estimate by 0.1 of a percentage point to 3.8%, due primarily to downward
revisions in all major regions of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development.
In contrast, the expected 2009 growth rate for developing countries was unchanged at 5.6%. India’s growth was revised up to 7.7% while China’s was unchanged
at 9.2%. “US economic expansion next year is now projected at 1.3%, down 0.3 percentage points from the previous month, but still higher than the prospect of 1.1%
growth in Japan and the Eurozone,” OPEC said.
“The dollar strengthened on the perception that the rest of the world—mainly
other OECD regions—were facing increasing headwinds and were slowing down
fast, while the US is seen to have been more proactive in resolving economic and ﬁnancial sector problems. Japan is on the brink of recession after second quarter real
gross domestic product fell at an annualized rate of 2.4%,” said OPEC ofﬁcials.
OPEC’s basket of 13 reference crudes peaked at $140.73/bbl July 4 on a weak dollar and geopolitical tensions. But later in the month, the basket price fell $13.55 or
almost 10%.
Reduced demand, increased OPEC oil exports, and a recovering dollar helped
calm the market in August, said cartel ofﬁcials. “Although the uptrend revived following recent supply disruptions in the Caucasus, the momentum was short-lived
as speculative funds continued to exit the crude oil futures market,” they said. As a
result, OPEC’s basket price plunged to a 3-month low of $109/bbl Aug. 12.
Seven-year low
In the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc., analysts said, “OPEC
has left its forecast for 2009 demand growth at its lowest levels in 7 years and has
warned that consumption could fall further. Obviously, we’ve found a price that
slows oil demand, but in our view, long-term oil fundamentals remain strong.”
A slowing economy and high oil prices have cut US oil demand this summer.
Transport and industrial fuels declined the most, pushing total US oil demand down
by 3.8% or 800,000 b/d in the ﬁrst 7 months. US gasoline has been on the decline all
year, and strong summer demand, and growth in China, the Middle East, and Asia
has not been enough to offset the huge decline in OECD oil demand in the second
quarter.
The recent sharp fall in crude prices may improve reﬁning economics and cap
discretionary cuts by reﬁners. The only major risk for product markets would be possible reﬁnery outages due to hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico, OPEC said.
“Deteriorating demand in the OECD countries, particularly in the US, along with
costly crude oil signiﬁcantly undermined reﬁning economics across the world in
July,” said OPEC ofﬁcials. That may be exacerbated with the approaching end of driving season. “This weaker trend is likely to be enhanced by new reﬁnery capacities
coming onstream in coming months,” they said.
“World oil demand in 2008 is forecast to grow by 1 million b/d with a slight
30,000 b/d revision from the previous forecast. In 2009, world oil demand is forecast to grow by 9 million b/d, unchanged from the previous forecast and 100,000
b/d lower than demand growth in 2008,” OPEC said. “With growth expected at 1.2
million b/d, non-OECD countries will account for all of the world oil demand growth
next year. Due to a major slowdown in transport and industrial fuel consumption not
only North America but also in OECD Europe and Paciﬁc, oil demand growth will be
on the decline in 2009, which will take the world oil demand growth the lowest since
2002,” OPEC said.
OPEC expects non-OPEC oil supply to increase by 580,000 b/d in 2008, unchanged
from the previous outlook, with upward supply revisions in the US, Mexico, UK, and
China generally offsetting downward adjustments for Canada, Norway, Australia,
India, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brazil, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan.
In July, total OPEC crude output averaged 32.6 million b/d, representing a gain of
235,800 b/d over the previous month due to higher production from Saudi Arabia,
Iraq, Nigeria, Kuwait and the UAE. Preliminary global oil supply ﬁgures—combining
non-OPEC supply, OPEC production, and OPEC NGLs and non-conventional oils—
indicate a July increase of 600,000 b/d in world oil supply from June. In 2009, nonOPEC oil supply is expected to grow steadily by 900,000 b/d.

Upstream IT advances enabling
‘digital oil field’ of future to
become reality today
Satellite technology advances key
to progress toward ‘digital oil field’

Continuing progress in data management and utilization and communications
technologies marks the oil and gas industry’s relentless march toward the “digital oil
field of the future.” The satellite photo shows a view of Saudi Aramco’s Khursaniyah
oil field development project facilities near Jubail on Saudi Arabia’s Persian Gulf
coast. The field will eventually produce 500,000 b/d of oil and 300 MMcfd of natural
gas. The satellite image is courtesy of DigitalGlobe. The 3-D computer model, which
represents cell geometry inside a geologic grid and fault throw, was generated by
Paradigm’s SKUA 2008 3-D geology-driven modeling software. The computer image is

Upstream IT advances enabling ‘digital oil
field’ of future to become reality today

T

he “digital oil ﬁeld” of the future is fast becoming a
reality today, even if industry experts can’t agree on
what the term really means.
Whatever the deﬁnition, it’s spurring a massive
amount of spending in the information technology (IT) sector
and creating a new way of working in the oil and gas industry.
Achieving the digital oil ﬁeld requires innovation in computer
software and hardware and in telecommunications to effectively “smarten up” and “wire” almost every aspect of upstream
oil and gas activity into an integrated, real-time operation.
“The digital oil ﬁeld is taking on an immense investment
for the industry, and every major private sector oil company
has a digital oil ﬁeld initiative to achieve total asset awareness
and maximize automated performance,” notes Marc Tremblay,
general manager of Digital Globe’s commercial business unit.
“The expected cost to achieve ‘nirvana’ will reach $1 billion
over the next 5 years in technology investment in hardware,
software, and services alone.”

What is the digital oil field?
The digital oil ﬁeld is a strategy for improving a speciﬁc area of an oil company’s business by deploying people, technology, and knowledge effectively, says
Barry Irani, president and CEO of The
Information Store.
“It is, in essence, a vision of how the
company wants to optimize a particular
business process, such as managing
Irani
operations of a mature ﬁeld, discovering
new reserves, developing an offshore deepwater discovery,
or coordinating a joint venture project,” he explains. “The digital oil ﬁeld initiative, however, is transforming the way people
work.” A key ingredient of the digital oil ﬁeld is quick, easy,
and timely access to quality data, Irani notes.
“To achieve a truly effective digital oil ﬁeld, companies
must shift the burden of orchestrating
data from people to systems,” he contends. “Even today, most geoscientists
and engineers spend over 50% of their
time simply handling data, keeping them
from activities they specialize in to generate business value.”
The biggest hurdle that Mayank Mehta
sees in achieving the digital oil ﬁeld of the Mehta
future is effective integration of emerging
| 4 |

technologies that help E&P companies gain business insight
from ﬁeld data in real time.
“They need technologies that enable real-time decision
support, continuous yield tracking, and enhancing ROI,” says
Mehta, global industry manager for oil and gas for GE Fanuc
Intelligent Platforms.
Another area confronting many E&P companies is the ability
to track changes on critical control and software assets, primarily as part of the ever-increasing requirement for regulatory
compliance, he adds.
For Tremblay, in order to achieve the true digital oil ﬁeld
threshold, “IT has to take on the complete centralization of information sources and content—and automation—into a central hub of global connectivity and knowledge to manage the
technical foundation.”
Complete process reengineering and labor transition come
along with the technical hurdles, he adds.
Concurs Ray Simonson, Software Innovation Inc. CEO: “It isn’t enough to focus
on technology in achieving the true digital
oil ﬁeld—industry needs to get the people
and processes right too.”
The end goal of the digital oil ﬁeld should
be to improve reservoir recovery, lower
costs, and increase production, he adds.
“Much has been said about personnel
Simonson
shortages, e.g., the graying workforce in
oil and gas, which means more must come out of the processes and technology,” Simonson says.
“On the technology side, vendors should focus on a
services-oriented design and adhere to interoperability standards so as to avoid creating digital silos of information.
Data should go in once and be usable throughout the asset’s lifecycle and by various applications. Customers should
be freed from older enterprise software approaches that
required standardization on a single vendor just to make everything work.
“On the processes side, players should not be afraid to beneﬁt from the past experiences of innovative companies that
have the budgets to experiment. The ﬁrst stages of oil ﬁeld
digitization have involved the generation and capture of massive amounts of data. The challenge is now in managing it effectively. We’ve seen projects that generate 100,000-500,000
engineering documents and another 1 million administrative
documents, each undergoing ﬁve revisions as it is updated,
reviewed, and improved.”

Management challenges
Oil and gas company senior management faces serious challenges in moving to a digital oil ﬁeld model, not the least of
which is their own sometimes archaic approaches to managing
the process of change itself.
“Many oil companies are impeded in implementing their digital oil ﬁeld strategies by a cumbersome deployment approach,”
Irani contends. “In other words, progressing through phases of
requirements analysis, testing, and deployment is time-consuming, often requiring years to complete, and ultimately falls short

the ease of integrating new people, devices, and applications
onto the network, Miller points out: “In the digital oil ﬁeld,
the network is the platform that connects all three—people,
devices, and applications.”
Finally, security, both physical and virtual, is an essential
element of digitizing the oil ﬁeld and remains a hurdle today,
Miller contends.
“There remains a perception that security through obscure
communication protocols is a desired path,” he suggests. “Yet
study after study conﬁrms that security through obscurity is a
myth. Too many old process control networks have insecure
designs that allow intrusion, obstruction, and corruption of essential operating systems.”

Workflow hurdles
Education, standards, and security are three
major hurdles to achieving the true digital oil
ﬁeld, according to Mark Miller, Cisco Systems director of enterprise operations.
“Redesigning workﬂows is a fairly
rigorous paper exercise, and putting it
into practice is even more challenging,”
he says. “Educating the work teams on
new technological capabilities is one of Miller
the ﬁrst steps of change management.
With the speed of technology development, education plays
an even more critical role to accelerate technology adoption
that creates value.”
Meanwhile, there is no shortage of standards in the industry, as getting to a common communications infrastructure
that runs on standard internet protocol (IP) vastly improves

O



While the digital oil ﬁeld concept has enormous appeal in an industry faced with an
ever-tightening labor pool, the issue of its
cost-effectiveness remains critical.
“First and foremost, there is the obstacle of translating the current business and
operational model to a digital form at a reasonable cost, and whereas many ideas and
applications are commendable, production Stack
considerations are paramount, and all innovation must pass the litmus test of practicality,” says Larry Stack,
president of Telvent’s energy division. “Seeking the beneﬁts of
technology will forever be weighed against their costs, and these
are challenges managers the world over face.”
Having said that, Stack avers, “Still,
information management, in real time,
clearly allows for business processes to
evolve or be created that capitalize on optimization gains from that information. For
example, a full information set will allow a
more optimized asset utilization scheme.
“Primarily, the immediate beneﬁt of
‘digitizing’ the oil ﬁeld is largely based in
Perlbach
the optimization of reservoir production.
At the hands of an experienced engineer, the beneﬁt of realtime feedback is nearly instantaneous.”
Then again, optimizing reservoir production via digitization and automation can in itself be a signiﬁcant opportunity
to cut costs.
Karen Perlbach, marketing communications manager for Data-Linc Inc., posits a more speciﬁc operations ﬁx: “There exists
a need for real-time remote monitoring and control of pump,
pump activity, and production data to decrease downtown and
unnecessary travel to remote sites, thus reducing costs and
increasing productivity.”

of fulﬁlling ongoing business needs as the underlying requirements change over time.
“The digital oil ﬁeld is an evolving process in itself. Often, an
organization cannot at the outset deﬁne all its needs. We have
found that the best approach is one that embraces the digital
oil ﬁeld as an iterative process. This approach is agile, iterative,
and emphasizes face-to-face involvement of solution developers,
data users, and decision makers. Requirements are identiﬁed
through the process, and new solutions quickly implemented
to meet the current needs of the organization. Doing so also
requires intimate knowledge of the E&P business. As such, delivering ﬁt-for-purpose digital oil ﬁeld solutions entails drawing on
the synergy of process iteration and domain expertise.”
Jorge Machnizh, Paradigm COO, sees
a signiﬁcant hurdle in the integration of all
available data and workﬂow, at the right
time, with appropriate analysis, in order to
support a decision and improve results.
“The industry has made signiﬁcant
progress in the advancement of communication systems that enable real-time data
ﬂow,” he notes. “However, due to the vast
Machnizh
amount of data types and the continued increase in data volumes, scalability becomes a challenge.”
In addition, IT leadership at oil and gas companies must overcome the myriad technical analytical applications and operating
systems to support the business, Machnizh says.
“The digital oil ﬁeld has different meanings depending on the
desired result; a solution needs to be crafted depending on the
situation, and I believe that starting from the desired outcome
and architecting a decision support system with clear objectives
becomes critical,” he adds.
However, the biggest hurdle continues to be people and
their ability to change, Machnizh contends: “The industry will
have to rely more and more on digital systems to accomplish
its goals, and over the next few years, productivity gains are
going to be achieved by improvements in system automation
and multidisciplinary workﬂow integration, leveraging all data
types into the workﬂow.”
One change in managing personnel that will expedite the
transition to the digital oil ﬁeld is to emulate the younger generation by embracing
advanced collaborative networking tools,
suggests Arshad Matin, Seismic MicroTechnology Inc. president and CEO.
“Our industry needs to learn from and
leverage the incredible growth of social networking websites,” he says. “The younger
generation probably spends more time on Matin
their computers interacting with each other than in person. We need to consider technologies that make
collaboration in the oil and gas arena easier. We still have companies where geoscientists are unable to collaborate with the
engineers, and each of them does his/her work in a silo.
| 6 |

“Our challenge is to build workﬂows where the interpreters and engineers can collaborate and reiterate their workﬂow
easily and effectively.”
Essentially, the technology to deliver the digital oil ﬁeld is
already at hand—the challenges that remain are in integrating
the technologies with workﬂow processes.
“The bottom line is that we are not too far away from an
integrated, digital oil ﬁeld—a world where
reservoir models are kept evergreen as
production data arrives, with the models
being rapidly updated in real time,” notes
Dr. Steve Webb, Roxar AS principal advisor for integrated reservoir and production
management. “New production data can
then be quickly assimilated into the reservoir model through continuous, computerWebb
assisted history matching. The result is
that the most updated information is available for making important decisions about the reservoir.”
The technology is now available, he points out, but probably
the single biggest obstacle remains the aligning of the technologies with the people using them.
“It is my belief that the most successful oil and gas companies of the future will be those that maintain a balance over the
development of both their physical and people assets facilitated
through the adoption of advanced technology solutions,” Webb
says. “This will require a streamlining and simplifying of operations with greater automation; more usable, right-time technology; a streamlined and integrated workﬂow; and the deploying
of new technologies that can lead to a greater simpliﬁcation of
operations and a change in traditional ways of working.”

Seismic challenges
A true digital oil ﬁeld will involve the integrated use of data obtained and analyzed in as near real time
as possible, says Geoffrey Dorn, CEO of
TerraSpark. These data include production
data, a wide variety of measurements in
the borehole, and 4-D seismic data.
“The one portion of this suite of data
that is the farthest from being real time is
the acquisition, processing, and analysis of
4-D seismic—both repeated 3-D seismic Dorn
surveys and repeated 3-D VSP surveys,”
he contends. “For these surveys to be useful in active reservoir
management, the data must be acquired, processed, and interpreted in as short a time as possible.”
Acquisition of seismic data has been substantially improved,
both in quality and in the speed of acquisition by moving to the
use of permanently emplaced receivers over the surface of the
reservoir, Dorn notes, adding that processing throughput can be
improved by improved algorithmic efﬁciency and by advances in
computational speed made possible through the use of multicore processors and programmable GPUs.

“Substantial improvements are necessary in the efﬁciency
and speed of interpretation and analysis,” he says. “Interpretation remains a very human-time-intensive process, where
most of the approach to interpretation of the seismic data is
based on approaches to interpreting horizons, faults, depositional systems, etc., that have not changed signiﬁcantly in the
last 10–20 years.
“Techniques such as horizon autotracking from seed points,
manual interpretation of fault cuts to create a fault surface, and
even less advanced approaches to interpreting depositional elements are fundamentally 2-D or 2½-D approaches to interpretation and are simply not efﬁcient enough to produce results in the
timeframe needed for real-time reservoir management.
“New approaches based on the interpretation, manipulation,
and editing of complete 3-D surfaces through the entire interpretation workﬂow (such as those being developed by TerraSpark
Geosciences) will be necessary to produce results needed from
repeated 3-D seismic and 3-D VSP surveys in the time needed to
have an impact on the management of the digital oil ﬁeld.”

Hardware, software needs
Successfully achieving the digital oil ﬁeld
also means that it is necessary for hardware to keep pace with software advances, says Mike Odell, CEO, Geomodeling
Technology Corp.
“In order for software to be used to
its full potential, it is absolutely necessary
for companies to ensure their hardware
can properly support the applications,” he
Odell
contends. “A key component is the inclusion of high-performance, high-resolution graphics cards for
advanced visualization usage. These cards often come standard with home-based gaming systems, and it continues to
amaze me that large energy companies don’t make it a standard practice to order them when they buy new high-performance PCs for their users.”
Odell notes that, with respect to processors, “we are seeing a major movement toward Linux 64-bit platforms and even
large Linux clusters for advanced simulation and visualization
applications.
“ As disk space continues to become less expensive, these
systems are being conﬁgured with the larger amounts of memory needed for advanced applications,” he adds.
It all adds up to an overarching need to make the process of
ﬁnding oil and gas automated, Odell continues: “It is important
to continue the process of developing more ‘expert’ systems—
systems designed to ask the right questions in order to provide
the user with the most relevant information more quickly (e.g.,
What area are you in? What workﬂows do you need?).
“Ideally, the software should recognize which workﬂow the
user is attempting to follow, and, as will soon be the case with
Geomodeling’s product, present the interpreter with the top
three attributes most appropriate for use in his or her speciﬁc

workﬂow and geographic/geologic problem.
“Furthermore, the software should be smart enough to understand when certain attributes or tools are not appropriate for
the current interpretation (e.g., X attribute cannot be used on
a carbonate ﬁeld) and inform the user. In this way, the application can help those geophysicists who may not necessarily know
what all attributes (or other tools) are used for.”
The integration of data between vendors is the key to improving the whole process of data loading and data management for
the interpreter, Odell says.
“The interpreter should not have to spend 30% to 40% of
his time moving data and reformatting it for each application,”
he explains. “Fortunately, the market is responding to this problem by creating tight integration between the tools that an interpreter uses daily. Geomodeling is currently working to provide
improved data loading for interpreters by more tightly integrating
our advanced attribute analysis tools with
popular seismic interpretation systems.”
Outsourcing some IT functions is one
solution to the challenge of how to invest
in hardware and software, according to
Xvand Pres. and Managing Partner Victor
Grinshtein.
“Increasing demand for oil has produced an ultracompetitive marketplace,” Grinshtein
he says. “This makes it imperative for
organizations in the oil and gas sector to have the ability to
increase their IT infrastructure capabilities on-demand, instead
of overinvesting to meet it.
“Fortunately, IT has evolved to the point to which investing
in and managing complex onsite infrastructures is no longer
necessary. Innovations such as utility computing or on-demand
computing allow for oil and gas companies to transfer the onus
of IT responsibility to the utility computing provider. Termed for
its parallels to the delivery model of standard utilities such as
electricity, utility computing is the packaging of computing resources, such as computation and storage. This system has the
advantage of a low or no capital cost to make use of hardware.
Client companies with very large computations or a sudden peak
in demand can also avoid the delays that would result from physically acquiring and integrating a large number of computers.”

Data concerns
Another concern for observers of the industry’s evolution to IT-dominated workﬂows is managing the volume and quality
of the massive amounts of data involved.
“The upstream oil and gas sector has
some of the largest unmanaged repositories of vertically specialized data of any
industry,” notes Paul Gregory, president
and managing partner of Intervera. “ImGregory
proving access to and conﬁdence in these
data is a key concern for CIOs. According to a survey of CIOs

conducted by Deloitte Consulting—regardless of business strategy, i.e., whether growth came from acquisition, exploration, or
development—CIOs in the upstream E&P
sector are recognizing that data accuracy
and quality is one of the most critical pain
points hampering movement to the digital
oil ﬁeld of the future.
“Other signiﬁcant impediments included the ability to accommodate the need for
M&A integration, work process complexity, authentication and audit tracking, and Farid
regulatory constraints. In addition, aging
demographics of oil ﬁeld workers and professionals indicates
that much of the domain knowledge will be lost within the next
10 years as senior G&G professionals retire.”
The major IT hurdles E&P companies face en route to the
digital oil ﬁeld are the integration and validation of data, according
to Merrick Systems Inc. Pres. and CEO Kemal Farid.
“Whereas in previous years companies were challenged to
gather enough data to track and understand their operations,
today there is a great deal of data available,” he notes. “In fact,
there is so much data that the challenge is how to handle all
this massive data and make use of it. Companies have at their
disposal a plethora of data sources, variety of different computing applications and systems, and numerous engineering
applications that can all contribute valuable information to help
accomplish better surveillance and visibility into the company’s
operations and assets and allow for optimization of operations.
Searching the various separate data sources, locating and gathering the relevant data, compiling it to a workable source, then
validating it and utilizing it for optimization is
very time-consuming and labor-intensive.
“With little time and staff available,
there is a critical need for applications
that will help with locating, gathering,
and validating data and assumptions and
alert the user of exceptions so that users
will use their scarce time effectively, dealing with real issues and not with routine
Wee
data management.”
Reuben Wee, IDS chief technology ofﬁcer, cites ﬁve main
hurdles to overcome in data management in order to achieve the
true digital oil ﬁeld of the future:
• Data availability. “Satellite communications have come
a long way; however, their reliability and availability will
need to be improved to ensure that the ‘digital oil ﬁeld’
can maintain its heterogeneous levels of use.”
• Accessibility. “Ease of use—in most cases, very few
people actually send out data entry personnel to the rigs;
the system has to be user-friendly to the operators.”
• Information aggregation. This is “to ensure that the
global situation awareness is provided, for the operator to facilitate proper ﬂow of information so as to allow the service companies to work closer and thus to
| 8 |

•

•

reduce human data entry where possible.”
Information availability. “Users may be geographically
dispersed and will require remote delivery methods
(web technology) to get at the data they will need to
make decisions or to report on.”
Flexibility. “The oil ﬁeld operates with many variables
that affect the operational progress for each project.
The IT system has to deal with changes from the ﬁeld
without losing its place on the map. It’s a well known
grunt that a 7-day look-ahead plan is only good for the
next 24 hr at best.”

Grinshtein cites a handful of obstacles to achieving the true
digital oil ﬁeld of the future, chief among them handling the
nearly overwhelming volume of datasets resulting from the
drive to digitize itself:
• “Data storage. The oil and gas sector is one of most
capital-intensive on the planet, and the stakes are high
to produce quicker and more accurate data sets. Each
new technological advancement prompts the need for
organizations to overinvest in computer hardware to
meet the growing demand for data storage. This hardware must also be backed, veriﬁed, and managed, exponentially increasing the capital investment.”
• “Data management. All the data in the world is useless if not properly managed. Organizations must create processes for managing their data, or they run the
risk of having it misplaced or lost. In a world of realtime accessibility, inaccessibility of any magnitude can
cause great damage. The damage is compounded if
the data is corrupt or falls into the wrong hands. This
leads to a third issue: federal legislation.”
• “Federal legislation: Many organizations are mandated
by law to report to federal organizations, such as the
Minerals Management Service. If data is compromised or lost, this can result in serious complications.
Furthermore, publicly traded companies or those that
conduct business with them have the added responsibility of complying with legislation such as SarbanesOxley, further increasing the risk.”
In the end, adds Grinshtein, IT infrastructure is at the core of
the digital paradigm shift in the oil and gas industry.
“For example, the increased demand for oil has organizations
scrambling to redevelop old oil ﬁelds,” he notes. “This can comprise years’ worth of data. Companies are now housing thousands of different datasets, exponentially more than any other
time in history. Each discipline within the organization—whether
it’s a geophysicist or a drilling engineer—must have easy access
to the data to efﬁciently process, manage, and optimize it. The
systemization of the data management process is crucial and
requires a sound IT infrastructure. In addition, improved communication between remote drilling locations and the ofﬁce allow
companies to more efﬁciently ﬁx problems as they arise.” ]

THE REMAINDER

September 30 – October 2, 2008
Hilton Fort Worth
Fort Worth, Texas USA

UNCONVENTIONAL GAS EXTRACTION BECOMING VIABLE
Production from unconventional reservoirs — tight gas sands, shales, and coalbeds--accounts for a large and growing share of total gas
supply. But the reservoirs are complex. The costs of drilling into and completing wells in them are continually rising while presenting unique
environmental problems. Producing gas from unconventional reserves proﬁtably, safely, and in amounts demanded by the market requires
increasingly sophisticated recovery methods.
Gas recovery from unconventional reserves will be explored on September 30 – October 2, 2008 at the
Unconventional Gas International Conference & Exhibition to be held at the Hilton Fort Worth, in Fort Worth,
Texas. Planned by the editors of Oil & Gas Journal and an Advisory Board of industry experts, the event will

Satellite technology advances key to
progress toward ‘digital oil field’

A

ll of the advances in data management, processing,
and utilization solutions would be of limited impact in
the march to the digital oil ﬁeld of the future if they
weren’t accompanied by equally powerful progress
in telecommunications technology, chief among them satellite
communications technologies and the tools that they support.
Yet hurdles remain in this area as well,
notes Bob Baker, COO Vizada Americas.
“The biggest hurdle to overcome has
to do with bandwidth,” he contends. “In
the past few years, bandwidth signiﬁcant enough to support the extension of
the home ofﬁce network to the ﬁeld ofﬁce could be provided only by terrestrial
connections or VSAT technology. This Baker
meant that smaller or remote ﬁelds or
sites, as well as vehicles and vessels, were excluded from
‘the digital ofﬁce.’
“With the advent of Inmarsat BGAN and Fleet Broadband,
mobile terminals are able to bring full network connectivity to
almost any location.”

LEO vs. GEO
Don Thoma, executive vice–president, marketing, Iridium Satellite, however, points to
the advantages of communications solutions via low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites vs.
geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellites
such as Inmarsat’s.
“While a GEO satellite offers obvious
advantages for ﬁxed antenna sites, there
are tradeoffs in terms of latency, coverage,
Thoma
and size of user equipment for mobile communications. Since Iridium is a LEO satellite system, voice delays
are typically unnoticeable, whereas with GEO systems, latency
can be quite high, causing speakers to have to wait for each other to ﬁnish. Importantly, the footprint of the GEO satellites does
not cover the high-latitude arctic…regions (a major area of focus
in today’s oil and gas industry) because the curvature of the Earth
disrupts message transmission when attempted at the edge of
a GEO satellite’s footprint. Further, due to the fact that GEO systems are so much further away from the Earth, they generally
require larger antennas in order to receive the satellite signals.”
Iridium uses a constellation of 66 operational satellites and
several in-orbit spares, notes Thoma. A single satellite completely circles the Earth once every 100 minutes, traveling at a rate
| 10 |

of 16,832 mph and crossing from horizon to horizon in about
10 minutes. The orbital paths of the satellites intersect over the
North and South poles, and each Iridium satellite is cross-linked
to four other satellites—two satellites in the same orbital plane
and two in an adjacent plane.
“These links create a dynamic network in space, so that calls
and data are routed among Iridium satellites without touching
the ground, creating a highly secure and reliable connection,”
Thoma says. “When you place a call, whether voice or data, the
call is uploaded to a satellite passing overhead, and then, as a
satellite moves out of reach, the call is seamlessly handed over
to the next satellite coming into view. The result is virtual realtime connections with extremely low latency. The network architecture provides seamless, gap-free coverage over the entire
surface of the globe, including the polar regions.”
While mobile telephony remains an important part of Iridium’s service offerings, the M2M (machine-to-machine) mobile data sector is Iridium’s fastest growing market, driven by
emerging requirements for remote asset tracking and monitoring, says Thoma.
“Major oil and gas producers, as well as their contractors and
suppliers, are increasingly turning to Iridium to provide low-cost
standardized solutions for applications such as equipment tracking, pipeline telemetry, and worker safety.”
Oil producers and contractors are now using Iridium-enabled
tracking devices to provide a critical safety lifeline for lone workers in Canada’s oil ﬁelds.
“An Iridium VAR [value-added reseller] developed the system
to meet Canadian Occupational Health and Safety Laws requiring lone workers to be monitored when working in potentially
hazardous locations,” Thoma explains. “The worker wears a
small, brightly colored fob on a lanyard. The fob communicates
wirelessly with a vehicle-mounted base station, which contains
a GPS receiver and Iridium data modem. If the worker remains
motionless for more than 3 minutes, the fob sends a signal asking the worker to press a reset button. If the reset button is not
activated within a preset time limit, the Iridium modem sends an
alert to the company of a possible ‘man-down’ situation.”
In addition, a number of Iridium VARs have developed blackbox devices with embedded GPS and Iridium SBD modems for
vehicle and heavy equipment tracking, typically using IP-based
infrastructure for map-based monitoring. One of the VAR systems is being used by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to
facilitate recovery of stolen vehicles and equipment in the oil and
gas ﬁelds of Alberta and British Columbia. Another Iridium VAR
recently validated its all-satellite mobile resource management

systems with a major provider of geophysical services on the
North Slope of Alaska.
“This system transmits engine and asset trouble codes,
fuel consumption, hard-braking, power take-offs, engine
RPMs, oil pressure, engine and coolant temperatures, and
other parameters through the Iridium satellite modem, and
also uses geofencing technology to provide alarms whenever
a vehicle tries to enter a prohibited area, such as a pipeline
right-of-way or well pad.”
Thoma also notes that large corporations in the oil and gas
sector are deploying Iridium satellite phones at global crisis centers around the world under their enterprise-wide emergency
preparedness plans.
“These contingency plans typically include redundant layers
of public and mobile communication systems, voice-over-IP systems, and satellite communications to ensure key staff can be
located and contacted across the global supply chain,” he adds.
Thoma also cites the growing demand for his company’s
products from helicopter ﬂeets serving offshore and onshore oil
and gas facilities: “A number of VARs have developed Iridiumenabled devices for voice communications and automatic ﬂight
following (AFF). In many cases, these devices can also be used
for transmitting standard messages and ﬂight plans as well as
AFF position data.”

Geospatial/GIS opportunities
There are also opportunities for utilizing satellite-supported
geospatial and related GIS (geographic information system)
technologies effectively if an oil and gas company wants to create a real-world perspective for upstream assets, prospects,
and operations as it seeks to achieve a digital oil ﬁeld status.
“Much of the IT initiative is currently
focusing on how to automate, monitor,
and connect data models into a centralized knowledge hub,” points out Marc
Tremblay, general manager of Digital
Globe’s commercial business unit. “One
key component not readily addressed by
IT is the role of geospatial imagery. Yet it
is the most readily available and tangible Tremblay
data asset that can reduce the operational
start-up and monitoring costs for keeping old reserves operational while searching for new reserves, especially as those
new reserves are springing up from some of the world’s most
remote and physically restrictive areas.”
He contends that an E&P company’s IT efforts should include geospatial imagery layers as the base context for any
digital oil ﬁeld initiative.
“If you look at the subsea operations in the North Sea, with
wells that sprawl over hundreds of square miles of seabed,
linked by pipelines and ﬁber optic cables to a single platform
buffeted by severe weather, the most accessible way to monitor the condition of corresponding assets from the external
view is from a high-resolution, sub-meter satellite orbiting the

earth,” Tremblay says. “With the clarity to pinpoint critical subsea operational assets, companies have a key tool within their
grasp to automate the external monitoring and control for any
eventuality for risk management, leak detections, or preventative operational maintenance. The ground-truth of satellite
imagery increases operational outcomes by providing real-time
accurate information to facilitate decision-making.”
Many IT organizations are still novices at the purchase and
integration of geospatial imagery, Tremblay notes, because it
has tended to be a project-based purchase and has not been
seen as an interactive landscape for operational planning.
“Over recent years, the satellite imagery market has shifted to wider accessibility and availability,” he says. “Some of this
is driven by the Virtual Globe (Google Earth
and Microsoft Virtual Earth) entry into the
marketplace, but also by new satellites,
such as Worldview-1, with faster, greater
collection capabilities dramatically changing the amount of current high-resolution
Wade
imagery immediately available from digital
content stores at far lower economic terms.
“With reduced economic terms and wider accessibility, satellite imagery has shifted from a higher-cost, annual or 2-year
pictorial review into the potential for real-time perspectives
within digital oil ﬁeld initiatives.”
Tremblay contends that since much of the surface cultural,
land, and production data is extracted from optical imagery,
“it beneﬁts oil and gas IT departments to leverage a consistent worldwide imagery source for these data, such as DigitalGlobe’s world imagery solutions, and which are now easily
integrated into current [digital oil ﬁeld] initiatives through web
services and online imagery platforms.
“Ultimately, if imagery and other geospatial data can be
used to model the physical environment more thoroughly, then
more of the early-stage planning and design can be done within
the conﬁnes of the ofﬁce environment—a key goal of the digital
oil ﬁeld. This saves time and money and limits the need to send
ﬁeld crews out to remote and or dangerous areas.”
One of the greatest challenges of managing the digital oil
ﬁeld of the future is dealing with the complexities of the ﬁeld
infrastructure and information overload of real-time data feeds
in an appropriate context of whole-ﬁeld management, asserts
Geoff Wade, ESRI petroleum industry manager.
“Many companies are discovering that GIS technology can
help manage, model, and reduce the overwhelming data volumes and provide an intuitive context for critical workﬂows that
have a signiﬁcant positive effect on whole-ﬁeld management efﬁciency,” he says. “Some of the greatest beneﬁts are currently
being realized in injection modeling, electrical supply optimization, gathering system design improvement, ﬁeld logistics and
maintenance scheduling, and real-time information management
dashboards, such that operations management can view the
whole system as a working machine in a true spatial context.” ]

SUCCEEDING In A Changing Environment
As the industry shifts to deeper water, the environment in
which we work becomes more complex, hazardous and
expensive. Successful companies recognize early the
changing conditions and environmental challenges facing
the industry. At the Deepwater Operations Conference &
Exhibition in 2008, participants and attendees will discuss
how to succeed under these extreme conditions.
The seventh Deepwater Operations Conference & Exhibition
will be held on November 4 – 6, 2008 in Galveston, Texas

and will see a return to the luxurious Moody Gardens Hotel
and Conference Center.
Plan to attend, sponsor and exhibit at the 2008 conference
and exhibition as the technical focus shifts to “Succeeding
in a Changing Environment.” As with our past conferences,
proceedings will not be published and the press will not be
invited to assure conﬁdentiality between the attendees and
the speakers allowing the most up–to–date information to
be shared.

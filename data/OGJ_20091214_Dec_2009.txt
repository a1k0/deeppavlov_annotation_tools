Advancing Reservoir Performance

Plugging and Abandoning
Hurricane-Damaged Wells
Vented Inﬂatable System Eliminates Gas
Bubbles, Enables Successful Cement Plugs
Many hurricane-damaged wells in the Gulf of Mexico have to be
permanently plugged and abandoned. Operators have discovered
that many of these wells are bubbling, which creates challenges
when placing cement barriers in the wells.

Gas Bubbles Passing Through Microannuli
Inflatable packers such as Baker Oil Tools’ Production Injection Packer
(PIP), deployed as a pressure sealing base on which a cement plug is
placed, is often a suitable fix for this problem. However, gas bubbles
sometimes find a way around the PIP and work their way through the
cement, creating microannuli even after the cement sets up. These
bubbles travel through microscopic pits or fissures in the old casing.
This was the challenge an operator faced in a High Island well with
26-in., 125 lbf casing.

Vented PIP System
To solve this problem reliably and economically, Baker Hughes developed
the Vented PIP System, a new method of stopping the flow of bubbles.
The system consists of a PIP (with a ball on seat below it), a length of
vent tubing above it, and a mechanical disconnect on top of that.

Bubbles in Well Stopped Immediately
Once the system was set at depth, bubbles in the well stopped
immediately. Simultaneously, a substantial flow of gas was observed
through the work string at surface. The operator then ran a grout string
(small work string) beside the primary work string to a depth just above
the inflated element. Cement was then pumped through the grout string
on top of the PIP. A cement volume was pumped that equaled about
50 ft in the annulus between the 26-in. casing ID and the OD of the
2 7/8-in. tubing. While this cement cured, the vent tubing and work
string were kept open to vent the gas to surface. This prevented gas
buildup below the PIP and kept bubbles from affecting the cement job.
Once the cement had completely cured, a cast iron bridge plug was run
through the primary work string and set in the vent tubing above the
PIP. This resulted in a permanently plugged well.

COVER
Production of natural gas from shale is expected to grow in Canada
as conventional production declines (see special report, p. 18). One
emerging play is the Triassic Montney shale of British Columbia
and Alberta. Shown here is the Portage 8-23-81-26 well drilled
by Triumph Pacific Oil & Gas in 2007 near Hudson’s Hope, BC,
and deepened into Montney shale in 2008 by Crew Energy Inc.
and Canada Energy Partners Inc. In August, CEP reported the
vertical hole encountered porosities exceeding 3% in 114 m of the
Montney and Triassic Doig formations. After a slick-water frac,
the Doig tested 946 Mcfd intermittently.The Upper Montney had
characteristics similar to productive Montney wells nearby and
wasn’t tested. Crew suspended the well pending drilling of another
test. Photo courtesy of Canadian Energy Partners.

NGSA, AXPC chime in on OTC market reform
US House floor action to reform over-the-counter derivatives
markets could increase commercial hedging and risk-management
costs enormously unless it includes language specifically excluding
these activities, two oil and gas association executives warned.
Mandatory clearing of all OTC derivatives could remove as
much as $900 billion from a fragile US economy, the presidents of
the Natural Gas Supply Association and the American Exploration
& Production Council said in a Dec. 4 letter to US House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and the Agriculture, Energy and Commerce, and Financial Services committees’ chairmen and ranking
minority members.
“Mandating centralized clearing and margins is a recipe for
unintended negative economic consequences,” NGSA Pres. R. Skip
Horvath said in a separate statement. “If all estimated hedging
transactions are forced into clearing, it could either cost the US
economy an estimated $900 billion—the price tag of the entire
2009 economic stimulus package and then some—or force many
companies to scale back their hedging, exposing customers to increased commodity and financial risk,” Horvath said.
He added, “It would cost the energy industry alone tens of
billions of dollars, effectively drive smaller participants out of
the market and centralize risk, all at a time when dollars are instead needed to create energy jobs, build infrastructure, and meet
environmental goals. That’s the exact opposite of the effect that
policymakers intend and couldn’t come at a worse time for the
struggling economy.”
An OTC derivatives regulation provision is part of a financial
reform bill sponsored by Financial Services Committee Chairman
Barney Frank (D-Mass.) that the House was scheduled to consider
on Dec. 9.
In their letter, Horvath and AXPC Pres. Bruce Thompson said
there needed to be an exemption for energy derivatives used for
hedging. Without a clear exclusion, physical natural gas supply
agreements risk being defined as swaps and included in a clearing
mandate, they indicated.
“Mandatory clearing is too high a price for energy derivatives
transactions that do not contribute to systemic risk,” Horvath
maintained.

DOE’s CCS funding includes project in W. Texas
The US Department of Energy will provide $350 million to
support a project designed to capture carbon from a proposed
electric power plant near Midland-Odessa, Tex., and transport it
to the Permian basin where it will be used in enhanced oil recovery, US Energy Secretary Steven Chu announced.
The Texas Clean Energy Project, which will be led by Sum-

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

mit Texas Clean Energy LLC (STCE) of Bainbridge Island, Wash.,
was one of three efforts receiving $979 million of federal support
under the third round of DOE’s Clean Coal Initiative. The other
two will involve carbon capture from existing coal-fired power
plants and storage in deep saline formations in West Virginia and
Alabama.
“By harnessing the power of science and technology, we can
reduce carbon emissions and create new clean energy jobs,” Chu
said Dec. 4 as he announced the funding. “This investment is part
of our commitment to advancing carbon capture and storage technologies to the point that widespread, affordable deployment can
begin in 8-10 years.”
The award came nearly 2 years after the Midland-Odessa area
lost its bid to become the site of Future Gen, the country’s first
fully integrated commercial power plant and CCS system, to Matoon, Ill.
STCE plans to integrate Siemens’ gasification and power generating technology with carbon capture technologies to effective
capture 90% of the carbon dioxide (2.7 million tonnes/year) at
the planned 400-Mw plant near Midland-Odessa, DOE’s Fossil Energy office said.
The captured carbon dioxide will be treated and compressed,
then transported by pipeline to Permian basin oil fields in West
Texas for use in EOR operations, it said. The University of Texas’s
Bureau of Economic Geology will design and assure compliance
with a state-of-the-art sequestration monitoring, verification, and
accounting program, DOE said. The project is expected to take 8
years.
A second project, led by Southern Co. Services Inc., will receive
$295 million of federal funding over 11 years to retrofit CO2 capture equipment on an existing Alabama Power Co. plant north of
Mobile for ultimate sequestration in deep saline formations. SCS
also plans to explore potentially using this captured CO2 in EOR
applications, DOE said.

Sudan seeks police withdrawal from oil regions
A leading member of Sudan People’s Liberation Movement has
called for immediate withdrawal of Sudan’s national police from
areas around oil fields in the southern region of the country.
Edward Lino, SPLM chairman in Abyei, told members of the
group’s liberation council that the presence of Sudanese national
police inside Abyei territory violates the so-called Abyei road
map and protocols, which aim at securing peace in the region.
Lion said the road map and the protocols state that security of
the region will be strictly controlled by joint integrated units
[JIU] and joint integrated police units [JIPU] and not by one side
alone.
“Why are these police forces still deployed around oil installa-

“In the light of this clear provision, I call upon the central government to immediately consider withdrawal of the national police still in Abyei territory so that security of the oil companies,
their personnel and assets remains under the control of the JIUs
and JIPUs,” he said.
Lino’s call coincided with a renewed announcement by the
semiautonomous government of southern Sudan that it plans to
construct a 50,000-b/d refinery in Warap state that will serve the
needs of other states west of the Nile River.
The facility will require $2 billion of investment and will take
36 months to complete, said southern Sudan’s Energy Minister
John Luk, while Minister of Information and Broadcasting Paul
Mayom Akech said oil for the refinery will be sourced Block 5A

Husky adds S. China Sea gas find at Liwan
A unit of Husky Energy Inc., Calgary, gauged another large gascondensate discovery on deepwater Block 29/26 in the eastern
South China Sea, near the company’s 2006 Liwan discovery from
which it hopes to begin gas production in 2013.
Deliverability from the LH 34-2-1 discovery could exceed 140
MMcfd of gas, similar in character to the Liwan 3-1 wells, Husky
said.
LH34-2-1, in 1,145 m of water 23 km northeast of Liwan 3-1
gas-condensate field, cut a “significant thickness” of excellent
quality, gas-charged reservoir, Husky said. It tested gas with a high
liquids content at an equipment-restricted rate of 55 MMcfd.
Excited that its drilling program is validating the company’s
geological predictions in the little-drilled area, Husky noted that
front-end engineering and design for the Liwan 3-1 field development, to which the LH 34-2-1 discovery will be tied in, is at an
advanced stage. The company expects to submit a development
plan to regulatory authorities in early 2010.
Meanwhile, the West Hercules semisubmersible is preparing
to spud another exploratory well on the 551,000-acre block, and
Husky plans to appraise LH 34-2 in early 2010. CNOOC Ltd. has
the right to participate for up to 51% working interest in the Liwan
development.

PetroKamchatka drilling in Far East Russia
PetroKamchatka PLC, Jersey, Channel Islands, UK, is drilling
its first exploration well on the Tigil block on Far East Russia’s
Kamchatka Peninsula and plans to begin trading this month on
Canada’s Toronto Stock Exchange.
Incorporated in December 2008, PetroKamchatka has secured
seven onshore exploration licenses that total 8.1 million acres
onshore on Kamchatka Island. It has identified numerous prospects and leads on modern 2D seismic on the Tigil and Icha
blocks.
KNOC Kamchatka Petroleum Ltd., owned 55% by Korea
National Oil Corp., and the Koryakia Property Fund, an investment agency of the Koryakia Okrug Administration, Kamchatka, have 50% and 5% interests, respectively, in the Tigil
and Icha blocks.

in Unity state.
Luk’s announcement repeats statements he made in October,
when the government of southern Sudan approved plans to build
a $2 billion refinery in Akon, Warap state that would serve all
seven states west of the Nile (OGJ Online, Oct. 19, 2009).
Last month, China National Petroleum Corp., apparently
shrugging off environmentalists’ concerns, signed three oil and
gas cooperation agreements of its own with the government of
Sudan.
The agreements consist of a memorandum of understanding
on the second phase expansion of Khartoum refinery, advance
payment for crude trading and an agreement to swap equity between CNPC’s Block 6 and Malaysia State Oil’s Block 5A (OGJ Online, Nov. 20, 2009). ✦

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

PetroKamchatka, through its indirect interest in CJSC Tigil Exploration, is drilling below intermediate casing set at 1,519 m at
its first well on the Tigil block.
CJSC Tigil is required to drill two wells on Tigil, one in calendar 2009 and one calendar 2010. The second well is to spud in
spring 2010.
The 2010-11 work programs and budgets on the two blocks are
subject to the approvals of the joint venture partner, KKPL, and
PetroKamchatka’s ability to obtain adequate financing.

Kosmos confirms Odum oil find off Ghana
Kosmos Energy, private Dallas operator, confirmed its 2008
Odum discovery off Ghana, proving the potential of the Campanian play on the West Cape Three Points Block east of giant Jubilee
oil field.
The company’s Odum-2 appraisal well cut 66 ft of net hydrocarbon-bearing pay in high-quality stacked sandstone reservoirs
over a 597-ft gross interval about 4 km northeast of the Odum1 discovery well. The Odum discovery is 18 km east of Kosmos
Energy’s Mahogany-1 exploration well and Jubilee field (see map,
OGJ, Dec. 8, 2008, p. 40).
Odum-2’s 66 ft of net oil pay is in two intervals that appear to
be in static pressure communication with the Odum-1 well, Kosmos Energy said. Odum-2 encountered an oil-water contact 190
ft below lowest known oil in Odum-1, extending the known oil
column beyond the deepest oil seen in Odum-1.
Reservoir fluid samples recovered indicate the crude to be
of 18-19° gravity. The Atwood Hunter semisubmersible drilled
Odum-2 to 8,222 ft in 2,677 ft of water.
Odum-2 confirms the second of Kosmos Energy’s four oil and
gas discoveries off Ghana, where the company has drilled nine
consecutive successful exploration and appraisal wells.
The Atwood Hunter will move to the adjacent Deepwater Tano
Block to drill the Tweneboa-2 appraisal well that will evaluate the
most recent oil find made by Kosmos Energy and partners. That
group is drilling the Mahogany Deep-2 appraisal well using the
Aban Abraham drillship. ✦

Production

Aramco targets Manifa start-up in 2013
Saudi Aramco says it has finished 60% of the causeway and
drilling island system and installed all offshore jackets in its shallow-water Manifa heavy-oil development project.
The project, which a company newsletter article calls “the largest single offshore crude oil project in Saudi Aramco’s history,”
came under review when oil prices fell last year but is proceeding
with start-up delayed by 2 years (OGJ, Nov. 24, 2008, Newsletter). Now scheduled on stream in 2013, the field will be able to
produce 900,000 b/d of Arabian Heavy crude, 90 MMscfd of associated gas, and 65,000 b/d of condensate. Project completion is
projected for 2015.
The Manifa project includes 27 man-made islands connected by
41 km of causeway in a bay that contains intensive algal habitats
and dense beds of sea grass. Marine life in the bay includes pearl
oysters, hamour fish, crabs, dolphins, shrimp, and sea turtles.
Aramco said it originally thought 30% of the causeway would
have to be open for seawater circulation. Research determined
that nearly natural circulation could be achieved with only about
10% of the causeway open, which lowered project costs.
In a Dec. 4 speech in Bangalore, India, Aramco Pres. and Chief
Executive Officer Khalid A. Al-Falih said that when Aramco made
the decision to develop Manifa field the price of oil was $70/bbl.
After the award of initial contracts, the crude price fell to $35/
bbl, but costs didn’t fall proportionately, and projections for global
oil demand were trimmed. “We reviewed the program, and with
some execution plan modifications, including deferring completion by 2 years, decided to continue,” he said.

Colombia’s Rancho Hermoso adds two new pays
Canacol Energy Ltd., Calgary, said its third and last development well of 2009 at Rancho Hermoso field in Colombia’s Llanos
basin found oil in two previously nonproducing formations and
flowed 33° gravity oil at the rate of 3,944 b/d from one of the
new pays.
Canacol Energy has 100% operated working interest in the
field, and the Rancho Hermosa-5 well is in a southern extension
area of the field that has remained undrilled since Colombia’s state
Ecopetrol discovered Rancho Hermoso in 1984.
The well found oil in Upper Cretaceous Guadalupe and Paleocene Los Cuervos in addition to Eocene Mirador, the regular field
pay. TD is 9,578 ft measured depth.
RH-5 penetrated Mirador 40 ft high to prognosis. It found oil
pay in Mirador at 8,939-74 ft true vertical depth with 7 ft of net interpreted oil pay thickness and average porosity of 26%, Los Cuervos at 8,990-9,020 ft with 9 ft of net interpreted oil pay thickness
and average porosity of 27%, and Guadalupe at 9,037-69 ft with 24
ft of interpreted oil pay thickness and average porosity of 28%.

Processing

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Guadalupe perforations at 9,042-50 ft flowed at a final rate of
3,944 b/d and 318 Mcfd of gas, natural, with water cut decreasing to 6%, on a ¾-in. choke at 145 psi bottomhole flowing pressure. The interval was tested 24 hr with rate increasing steadily
throughout the test. Canacol Energy believes that the produced
water is completion fluid.
Unlike production from the Mirador reservoir, for which it receives a tariff for each barrel of oil produced, production from
the Guadalupe and the Los Cuervos reservoirs will bring Canacol Energy 25% of gross oil production under the terms of the
production-sharing agreement with Ecopetrol.

Libya delays plans to boost oil output
The Libyan government, hit by budget constraints and by current market conditions, has announced a delay of up to 5 years in
its previously released plans to raise its oil output capacity.
“Our plan was to reach 3 million b/d by 2012, but because of
the market conditions, as well as budget constraints,” we delayed
it to 2017, said Shokri Ghanem, chief executive officer of Libya’s
state-owned National Oil Corp. (NOC).
“By 2016-17, we can reach the 3 million b/d target, but we
need more budget allocations,” Ghanem said on the sidelines of
a meeting of oil ministers of Arab countries belonging to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Ghanem said
Libya’s present production capacity is “almost 2 million b/d” and
that his country is meeting its OPEC quota of 1.5 million b/d.
Meanwhile, Ghanem confirmed earlier reports that Hess Corp.
has discovered “quite a big filed” of natural gas in the Gulf of
Sirte, where it operates together with NOC.
According to Hess, its fully owned subsidiary Hess Libya Exploration Ltd. carried out a successful test of its discovery well
A1-54/01 in the Mediterranean off Libya.
It said the A1-54/01 well was originally drilled in the Arous
Al-Bahar prospect in 2008 and found hydrocarbons in several intervals with a combined gross section of about 500 ft.
Hess recently reentered and perforated the well over a 300-ft
carbonate interval and performed a drill stem test.
The well flowed 27 MMscfd of “good quality” gas and 533 b/d
of condensate through a 52⁄64-in. choke, Hess said, adding that the
test was performed using the sixth-generation dynamically positioned Stena Forth drillship.
After operations on this well, Hess said the Stena Forth will
return to complete the drilling of an appraisal well, A2-54/01,
which lies 7 miles northwest of the discovery well.
Well A1-54/01 was drilled in 2,807 ft of water in Area 54,
which is 35 miles offshore in the Sirte basin. The Hess unit holds
a 100% working interest in Area 54, which it operates under an
exploration and production-sharing agreement with NOC. ✦

Shell pulls out of Chinese refinery plans

Kupe gas project off New Zealand starts up

Royal Dutch Shell PLC reported last week it has withdrawn
from talks with China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (Sinopec) and
Kuwait Petroleum Corp. that were to lead to construction of a $9
billion, 300,000-b/d refinery in China’s Guongdong province.
A Shell spokesperson told OGJ that, due to “strategic and commercial considerations, Shell has decided not to pursue the downstream opportunity currently in discussion between KPC and
Sinopec.”
Regional media speculation agreed that the move opens the
way for other international oil companies to join the joint venture.
In its quoted comments, Sinopec made clear it would retain a 50%
interest, leaving any other party to carve out a stake from KPC’s
50% interest.
Shell is seen as pulling away from new downstream ventures in
favor of more oil and natural gas exploration and production.
A memorandum of understanding is in force between state-run
KPC and Sinopec to build the refinery and petrochemical complex

Origin Energy New Zealand Ltd. has begun commissioning the
offshore Kupe field with initial production, moving natural gas
and liquids ashore via pipeline to a gas processing plant at Hawera
(see map, OGJ, July 16, 2001, p. 38).
Full start-up is likely within 2 months, said Andrew Stock, Origin’s executive general manager of major development projects.
Kupe gas project participants are Origin (50%, operator), a
wholly owned subsidiary of Origin Energy Ltd.; Genesis Energy

oil and gas, said once Kupe was in full operations, it would provide 10-15%/year of the country’s gas demand for 15-20 years.
Kupe will produce up to 90,000 tonnes/year of LPG, more than
50% of the country’s demand, he said.
Over the project life, Kupe is expected to provide 6.6 billion cu
m of gas, 1.1 million tonnes of LPG, and 14.7 million bbl of light
crude. ✦

Two more firms join Santos basin LNG scheme
Repsol YPF SA and Galp Energia have joined Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) and BG Group to develop front-end engineering and design for the construction of an onboard natural
gas liquefaction unit that will operate 300 km off Brazil. The
planned site is on Blocks BM-S-9 and BM-S-11 in Santos basin’s
presalt pole.
The unit is one of the transportation technologies being considered to flow gas produced in the presalt layers, according to
Petrobras.
Stakes in the expanded joint venture are now Petrobras holding
51.1%, while BG, Repsol YPF, and Galp each hold 16.3% interests.
The JV partners also are partners in Blocks BM-S-9 (Petrobras, BG,
and Repsol YPF) and BM-S-11 (Petrobras, BG, and Galp).
The tender for preparation of the FEED for the unit was started
last August (OGJ Online, Nov. 18, 2009). Planned installation of
the unit will be near the floating oil and gas production units and
receive, process, and liquefy as much as 14 million cu m/day of
associated gas.
Petrobras also said the unit will store and transfer processed
products (LNG, propane, and butane) to vessels, which, in turn,
will then transport them to market. The LNG, the company said,
will be delivered to regasification terminals, which will vaporize
it and inject it into the gas pipeline network.
Petrobras operates LNG regasification terminals in Brazil: in
Pecem, state of Ceara, and in the Guanabara Bay, state of Rio de
Janeiro (OGJ, July 27, 2009, p. 33).
Petrobras said the unit will allow Santos basin’s presalt pole

segment is low.

Chevron signs deal for Wheatstone project
Chevron Australia has signed an offtake agreement with Tokyo
Electric Power Co. (Tepco) to sell 4.1 million tonnes/year of LNG
from the Wheatstone project over a 20-year term.
The heads of agreement is believed to be worth about $90 billion (Aus.).
In addition, Tepco is planning to acquire a 15% interest in the
Wheatstone field licenses along with an 11.25% interest in the
proposed gas processing facilities planned for Ashburton North
near Onslow on the Western Australian coast.
Western Australian Premier Colin Barnett hailed the agreement
by noting that his State will benefit from significant new export
earnings and from an additional 200 terajoules of domestic gas,
which is part of the project program.
Barnett said the Wheatstone project also would bring new development to Onslow in the form of a deepwater port and the
establishment of an 8,000 hectare strategic industrial park at the
Ashburton North site.
The initial stage for Wheatstone will have a capacity to produce
8.6 million tonnes/year of LNG and will also include the domestic
gas plant.
Chevron expects to make a final investment decision on the
project in 2011. ✦

Climate feedbacks
Regarding the editorial “Climate
change twists”, you refer to the assumption by climate change alarmists that
there is a positive feedback magnifying
the minuscule direct effect of additional
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (OGJ,
Nov. 2, 2009, p. 18). However, data
trump assumptions and the data show
a negative feedback, not the assumed
positive feedback (see “Climate Feedback” by Lindzen and Choi, Geophysical
Research Letters 36, L161705, Aug. 26,
2009).
Other information plus common
sense tells us that nature, not human
activity, controls climate. There has been
an increase in temperature as the earth
recovers from the Little Ice Age. The
warmest year during this period was
1934, well before our use of fossil fuels
took off, about 1950. Superimposed on
the long-term warming period there
have been shorter-term warming and
cooling periods which are correlated
with the activity of the sun.
Before the Little Ice Age, there was
a medieval warm period, warmer than
today. It was a good time for human
beings, without catastrophic climate
effects.
The argument that carbon dioxide
intensified Katrina doesn’t hold water.
While carbon dioxide concentration
continues to increase, there have been
no serious hurricanes reaching the US
this season. A simplistic look at this fact
could lead to an argument that carbon
dioxide protects us from hurricanes.

Make a Global Impact in Carbon Capture and Storage

Two Key Senior Executive Roles – Australia
The Global Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Institute
is a bold new initiative aimed at accelerating worldwide
commercial deployment of at-scale CCS. Please refer to
www.globalccsinstitute.com for more information.
The Senior Executive Projects (QC194-O) will facilitate the
establishment of a portfolio of projects aimed at assisting
in the acceleration of commercially viable CCS technology.
Experience in developing and leading infrastructure projects
from concept through to implementation in the energy and/
or resource sector is essential, as is exposure to CCS.
The Senior Executive Knowledge Management (QC193-O)
will lead the selection, centralisation and dissemination of
CCS knowledge to benefit the organisation, its members
and stakeholders. Executive level capabilities in knowledge
management within a global context, a socio-technical
perspective, and an understanding of CCS concepts
are required.
Both roles will have global reach from Canberra, Australia
and will be part of the executive team reporting to the CEO.
Both roles require international experience.
Further enquiries to Liz Crawford on +61 7 3233 3262 or
by email to lizcrawford@kpmg.com.au, quoting relevant

EPA upstages conference

Sam Fletcher
Senior Writer
The Environmental Protection
Agency upstaged the opening of the
Copenhagen climate conference by
formalizing on Dec. 7 its finding that
carbon dioxide—the fifth most common gas in the Earth’s atmosphere—is
a “pollutant” that threatens life on this
planet through global warming.
EPA’s decision was generally expected following its preliminary finding
against the gas in April as the result of
a study it undertook after the 2007 US
Supreme Court ruling that greenhouse
gases (GHG)—including CO2—are
within the federal Clean Air Act’s definition of pollutants. That opens the way
for the EPA to regulate CO2 emissions
under the Clean Air Act. “In practical
terms, though, the EPA isn’t about to
start regulating carbon. And if it tries to
do that without Congressional backing,
expect a flood of litigation,” said analysts in the Houston office of Raymond
James & Associates Inc.
Like many skeptics, Raymond James
analysts suspect the timing of the EPA’s
announcement was “designed as a way
for President [Barrack] Obama to claim
credit for something when he goes to
Copenhagen” to speak at the climate
conference. “Since the Waxman-Markey bill is not going anywhere in the
Senate, the EPA ruling is probably the
only source of leverage he can bring
with him to the negotiating table,”
they said.

the defining factor. One key to moving
legislation in the Senate is the extent
to which China and India appear ready
to take on binding, absolute emissions
caps in coordination with US reductions (rather than intensity reductions).”
Obama earlier proposed a 17% US
reduction in GHG and $7-10 billion
in mitigation funding for developing
nations. But any agreement reached
at Copenhagen “will be contingent
on Congress passing climate legislation,” FBR analysts said. Congress also
controls funding mechanisms. “Thus,

on his way to Oslo to pick up his Nobel
Prize. However, his appearance at the
conference was pushed back to the Dec.
18 closing when 65 other heads of state
and government are expected to attend.
The White House said the visit was rescheduled after recent pledges by China
and India to reduce GHG emissions.
Proponents hope it will give Obama
the opportunity to charm other heads
of state into some climate agreement.
But several energy analysts remained
skeptical that any major agreement will
result from the meeting.

Deconstructing endangerment
With the US Environmental Protection Agency’s “endangerment finding” on greenhouse-gas
emissions (GHGs), the politics of global warming
reveals its tyrannical core.
EPA obviously scheduled its Dec. 7 announcement for maximum coercive effect. International
leaders were meeting in Copenhagen to negotiate an agreement to follow the Kyoto Treaty. And
the US Senate had delayed into 2010 its work on
legislation to limit GHG emissions. By assuming
responsibility for GHG regulation, the EPA scored
diplomatic points in Denmark and raised pressure
on Congress.

wouldn’t have been filed if no one feared that a
buildup of GHGs in the atmosphere threatened
the planet with disastrous warming. But the fear
is widespread. It results from relentless propagation of the message that observed warming is
unprecedented and destined to become extreme,
that it comes mainly from human activity, and
that humans need to change behavior radically to
prevent catastrophe.
That message grounds itself in predictions of

its high silt and silica content—had
reached what he described as the commercial stage. The US plays he judged
to be at that stage were the Marcellus,
Barnett, Haynesville, Fayetteville, and
Woodford shales.
Speaking at the National Bank
Financial Energy Services Conference,
Dawson assigned the Horn River basin
play in part to the pilot productiontesting phase, where it aligned with
newer projects in the Marcellus shale,
and in part to the pilot-project drilling
stage, aligned with the Eagle Ford play
in the US.
Shales in the Quebec lowlands, Nova
Scotia, and New Brunswick, Dawson
said, remain at a stage he described as
early evaluation drilling.
As in the US, shales in Canada differ
greatly—shale versus shale and location versus location within a single
shale—and require tailored completions and various fracturing methods.
According to Dawson,

Columbian data, NEB said operators
had spent $2.4 billion for Montney gas
rights in government auctions in 200508, $1.3 billion in 2008 alone.
As of last July, NEB said, 234
horizontal wells were producing 376
MMcfd from the Montney shale, mostly
from the Heritage pool of British Columbia.
Individual wells produce 3-5 MMcfd
generally, occasionally more than 10
MMcfd, at start-up, followed by rapid
declines. The wells usually have 7 to 9
and as many as 12 100-tonne carbon
dioxide or water frac stages over 2-km
horizontal legs.
• In the Horn River basin, shales rich
in silica lie at the foot of the Devonian Slave Point carbonate platform,
which has long produced gas from
conventional reservoirs. Operators have
drilled, hydraulically fractured, and
placed on production about 20 horizontal Horn River wells.
Before starting their steep declines,
wells in the area produce at start-up at
rates as high as 16 MMcfd. Production
data in the Horn River basin remain
confidential.
Associated with the Horn River
basin play and to the east is the Cordova

embayment, which has an estimated
200 tcf of gas in place but remains at a
much earlier stage of evaluation.
NEB said that as of May operators
had spent more than $2 billion in
British Columbia government auctions
for resource rights in the Horn River
basin and less than $40 million in the
Cordova embayment.
• The Colorado Group comprises shaley strata deposited in southern Alberta
and Saskatchewan in the Middle Cretaceous. It includes the Medicine Hat and
Milk River shaley sandstones, which
have produced gas for more than 100
years, and the Second White Speckled
shale.
Colorado Group shale, like the
Montney, is a hybrid, producing
through thin sand beds and laminae.
It’s underpressured, sensitive to water,
and therefore difficult to frac. Operators are testing the use of nitrogen and
mixtures of propane and butane as frac
fluid.
More than 3 MMcfd is flowing from
“a few dozen” shallow vertical wells in
the Wildmere area of Alberta, where
the Colorado shale is about 200 m thick
and has potential to produce from five
intervals. Wells cost $350,000 each

from drilling through connection with
pipelines.
Noting the difficulty of estimation
given the shale’s great lateral extent and
reservoir variability, NEB said the Colorado Group might hold at least 1 tcf of
gas in place.
• The Utica shale was deposited in
deep waters at the foot of the Trenton
carbonate platform. Caught later in
early Appalachian Mountain growth, it
became faulted and folded to the southeast. It’s the source rock for conventional oil reservoirs.
The Utica shale has higher concentrations of calcite, which is less brittle
than the silica it displaces, than other
Canadian gas shales. It contains biogenic gas in shallow areas and thermogenic
gas at greater depths.
Vertical wells after fracing in the
Utica shale are reported to have produced 1 MMcfd of gas. Three hydraulically fraced horizontal wells are
reported to have tested 100-800 Mcfd
of gas from medium-deep shales.
The overlying Lorraine shale might
have potential but is richer in clay and
therefore difficult to frac.
• In the Canadian Maritimes, the
Horton Bluff Group contains lacustrine

The average silica content of the
group’s Frederick Brook shale is 38% in
New Brunswick, but the clay content
also is high at 42%. In Nova Scotia,
the Frederick Brook member has an
organic content of 10%, much higher
than other Canadian gas shales.
Frederick Brook thickness may
be greater than 150 m, NEB said,
sometimes exceeding 1 km in New
Brunswick. Flow testing is in progress.
Although hydraulic fracing has been
less successful than in western Canada,
two vertical Frederick Brook wells in
New Brunswick have flowed 150 Mcfd
after small fracs.

their own. We also have to continue
economic growth to provide jobs for
people already on this planet by 2030.
That means providing more energy.”
Actions are necessary despite a likely
decline in global energy use in 2009 as
a result of the financial and economic
crisis, IEA Chief Economist Fatih Birol
said. This has led to a plunge in energy
investment because of a tougher financing environment, weaker demand, and
reduced cash flows, he indicated. For
oil and gas companies, this has meant
delayed and canceled projects as well as
capital spending cuts.
“Global upstream spending is expected to fall by more than $90 billion,
or 19%, the first fall in a decade,” he
told his audience at CSIS. “If this trend
continues and merges with a strong
rebound in demand as the world’s
economies recover, it poses price implications.”

Forecast outlays
Under the WEO’s reference scenario,
where major climate change policies
aren’t adopted, $26 trillion in 2008 dollars would be required to meet projected energy demand from 2010 through
2030, equal to $1.1 trillion/year (or
1.4% of global gross domestic product).
More than half of that would be needed
in countries outside the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development, where demand and production
are expected to increase fastest.
“With little prospect of a quick return to the days of cheap and easy credit, financing energy investment will, in
most cases, be more difficult and costly
than it was before the [financial and
economic] crisis,” the report says.
Under the 450 Scenario, another
$10.5 trillion would be needed. “But
investments in industry, transport, and
buildings are more than offset by fuel
cost savings, which in the transport
sector alone amount to over $6.2 trillion [during] the period,” the report
continues. The scenario also offers environmental and security benefits, with

Biofuels’ water
impacts

T

he US government is encouraging the use of biofuels in
response to concerns about the
country’s dependence on imported
oil, climate change, and other issues. Water plays a crucial part in all
stages of biofuels production, and the
Government Accountability Office is
studying implications of expanded
biofuels production’s water use.
The extent to which more biofuels
production affects US water resources will depend on the feedstock type
selected and how and where it is
grown, GAO said in a Nov. 30 report.
It said experts believe that if corn
or other conventional feedstocks are
used extensively, the impact would
be greater than if next generation
feedstocks, such as perennial grasses
and woody biomass, are used.
“This is because corn is a relatively resource-intensive crop, and in
certain parts of the country requires
considerable irrigated water as well
as fertilizer and pesticide application,” GAO said.
The same experts and officials
noted that next generation feedstocks’ impact on water resources
aren’t fully known yet because they
haven’t been grown commercially.

which feedstocks to grow and where
to expand their production,” GAO
said.
Using certain agricultural practices, alternative water sources, and
technologies could mitigate biofuels
production impacts on water, GAO
said, but it also found barriers to
their widespread adoption.
For example, it noted that brackish water or other alternative sources
might work for some biofuel conversion phases and reduce refineries’
reliance on fresh water.

‘Remain untested’

Similarly, innovations such as dry
cooling systems and thermomechanical processes could reduce water
demand, “but many of these innovations are currently not economically
feasible or remain untested at the
commercial scale,” it said.
GAO said many experts identified
two main areas where additional
research is needed: feedstock cultivation and biofuel conversion, and data
on water resources. “For example,
some experts noted the need for
further research into improved crop
varieties, which could help reduce
water and fertilizer needs,” it said.
It said that several mentioned

and 30% lower in China and India in
2030 than in the reference scenario.
Both scenarios assume that energy
prices will rise through 2030. “Consumers will need to recognize that the
cheap energy era is over,” said Tanaka.
“We think that the $147/bbl oil price
last year began to change the structure
of demand. Two major US automakers
went into bankruptcy. The consumer is
learning.”
In the reference scenario, the average IEA crude oil import price (a proxy
for international prices which in 2008
averaged around $3/bbl less than
West Texas Intermediate crude, the US
benchmark) is assumed in real terms
to reach $87/bbl in 2015, $100/bbl by
2020, and $115/bbl by 2030 (in 2008
dollars).

Lower demand
Under the 450 Scenario, oil prices
are assumed to follow the same upward
path until 2015 but remain flat from
then until 2030 because demand would
be weaker. “The oil price is assumed
to plateau at $90/bbl in real terms in
2020. Gas prices are correspondingly
lower. Coal prices are reduced even
more, as demand falls much more than
for oil or gas,” the report says.
These prices also take into account
carbon prices under cap-and-trade
systems which are assumed to be
introduced in many parts of the world.
Under this scenario, the CO2 price
within the OECD reaches $50/tonne
in 2020 (which increases the cost of a
barrel of oil by $21) and $100/tonne in
2030 (which increases oil costs $46/
bbl), according to the WEO.
“If there’s a financial signal, habits
will change. We need a carbon price,”
Birol said. “The bulk of the discussion
now centers on which country reduces
CO2 emissions by how much. I think
that’s wrong. The focus should be on
investments and who pays for them.”
Manufacturers in industrialized nations
might want to consider cofinancing reductions in developing countries where
they would cost less, he suggested.
Both scenarios forecast long-term

Gas demand would grow 17% under

“The good news is that there’s a

States. There’s a boom in shale gas

which poses implications elsewhere,”
said Birol. “Many companies and countries thought they could sell LNG to the
US, which doesn’t need it now. They’ll

GHG health-threat finding sets stage for regulations
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Greenhouse gases threaten the public’s health and should be regulated, the
US Environmental Protection Agency
said on Dec. 7. GHG emissions from
on-road vehicles contribute to that
threat, it added.
“Today’s finding is based on decades
of research by hundreds of researchers,” EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson
said. “The vast body of evidence not
only remains unassailable; it’s grown
strong, and it points to one conclusion:
Greenhouse gases from human activity
are increasing at unprecedented rates
and are adversely affecting our environment and threatening our health.”
The finding follows a study that EPA
undertook after the US Supreme Court
ruled in 2007 that GHGs fit within the
federal Clean Air Act’s definition of
pollutants. It covers emissions of six
gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous
oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride,
according to Jackson.
It does not impose new requirements itself but allows the agency to finalize GHG standards proposed earlier
this year as part of a joint rulemaking
with the US Department of Transportation, Jackson continued. On-road vehicles contribute more than 23% of total
US GHG emissions, and EPA’s proposed
standards for light-duty vehicles, an onroad vehicle subset, would reduce GHG
emissions by nearly 950 million tonnes
and conserve 1.8 billion bbl of oil over
the lifetime of model year 2012-16

vehicles, Jackson said.
She noted that both she and US President Barack Obama support reaching
a legislative solution to global climate
change, but added that it’s critical for
EPA to respond to the Supreme Court’s
ruling and begin to regulate GHG
emissions because they threaten public
health. The agency issued proposed
findings in April and received more
than 360,000 comments during the
60-day comment period that followed,
she said.

‘Politically motivated’
Oil and gas industry groups immediately criticized EPA’s action. “There
was no compelling deadline that forced
EPA’s hand on this decision,” said
American Petroleum Institute Pres. Jack
N. Gerard. “It is a decision that is clearly politically motivated to coincide with
the start of the Copenhagen climate
summit. EPA’s finding is inadequate,
unsupported by the record, and fails to
demonstrate a significant risk of harm
to public health or welfare.”
National Petrochemical & Refiners
Association Pres. Charles T. Drevna,
meanwhile, commented, “Individual
American consumers and businesses
alike will be dramatically affected by
this decision that, frankly, is based
on selective science, a weak legal and
policy foundation, and a failure to account for numerous uncertainties and
assumptions in the models it relies on.”
Drevna added, “This is yet another
example of federal policymakers failing
to consider the long-term consequences
of a regulatory action for consumers

and the economy as a whole.”
Congressional Democratic leaders said EPA’s finding makes it that
much more urgent for Congress to pass
climate-change legislation. “Those who
fear EPA regulation of global warming
pollution will find the answer in the
American Clean Energy and Security
Act passed by the House this year,” said
US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.).
“Now that the US government
has officially ended its era of climate
denial, the real endangerment to our
planet comes from those who continue
to deny the science and delay taking
any action,” said Rep. Edward J. Markey
(Mass.), who cosponsored with Energy
and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry J. Waxman (Calif.) the bill
which the House passed by seven votes
on June 26.

Key milestone
US Environment and Public Works
Committee Chairwoman Barbara Boxer
(Calif.), who cosponsored the Senate’s
current primary climate-change bill
with John F. Kerry (Mass.)—which the
committee approved despite a boycott
by Republican members—said the
endangerment finding was a key milestone in EPA’s efforts to address global
warming under CAA. “It is now clear
that if we take our responsibility seriously to protect and defend our people
from this threat, the Senate has a duty
to act on climate-change legislation that
includes major components of the work
done by the Energy and Environment
committees,” Boxer said.
Republicans were more critical.

“With more than 15 million Americans unemployed, obviously creating

“We take this work seriously. And
we stand ready and willing to put that
work to use, in service of the goals and
objectives identified by your jobs panel
this afternoon,” Vincent said in his letter to Obama.
Vincent said he was pleased when
the president released a position statement during his recent China trip
hailing the US as a leader in shale gas
technology and developing the resource
in ways which mitigate environmental
risks.
“May we add ‘creating new jobs’ to
that list as well?” Vincent said, adding,
“Only a couple of years back, analysts
predicted that shale gas production in
Texas’s Barnett shale would create $6.5
billion in economic output and 70,000
jobs. Nice try. In 2008, the Barnett
generated more than 111,000 permanent jobs and $11 billion in economic
activity—and the expectation is for

those numbers to climb dramatically in
the years to come.”
He and Nichols each cited a recent
Penn State University report on the
Marcellus shale that found that 29,000
jobs were created along the formation
in three US Mid-Atlantic states last year,
and that more than 50,000 jobs are
expected to be created there by yearend. The study also found that Marcellus development has been responsible
for more than $2.3 billion of economic
development in the area, Vincent said.

“The first thing this administration
needs to do is stop doing things [that]
have a chilling impact on job creation,”
said Nichols. “The cap-and-trade bill
would impose a huge new tax on industries. The president’s budget would
impose new taxes on our own industry,” he said, adding that opening more
federal acreage to leasing would be a
good second step.

The third-quarter
capital-cost index showed

down costs of drilling rigs
and yards and fabrication.

for offshore rigs fell 3.1%
because of weak demand for

Cost of yards and fabrication, already hurt by a slump

as new orders declined and
equipment operators faced

IHS CERA’s upstream operating costs index rose 1%
between the first and third
quarters of 2009 to 168. The
firm attributed the increase
to operating personnel costs
and increases in the market
for consumable materials.
It said a 6% increase in
operating personnel costs
resulted largely from foreign

The consumables-cost

Study says oil speculation not ‘excessive’
As the US Congress and Commodity
Futures Trading Commission consider
tighter regulation of derivatives trading,
a new study suggests excessive speculation wasn’t to blame for a record-breaking surge in oil prices in first-half 2008
(OGJ Online, Nov. 24, 2009).
The study by Hilary Till, research
associate of the EDHEC-Risk Institute
in Nice, France, uses newly detailed
data from the CFTC and a traditional
standard for assessing speculative activity in relation to hedging in agricultural
derivatives markets.
“We can say that, based on traditional speculative metrics, the balance
of outright speculators in the US oil
futures and options markets was not
excessive relative to hedging activity
in those same markets from June 13,
2006, to Oct. 20, 2009,” concludes Till,
a principal and cofounder of Premia
Capital Management LLC based in
Chicago.
She says her study became possible
when the CFTC in October launched
the Disaggregated Commitments of
Traders report, which provided more
detailed categorization of large traders than previously was available. The
move relieved some of the ambiguity

in the older reporting regime, which
treated swaps dealers hedging their positions in futures markets as nonspeculative traders.
Because those dealers “are not
hedging in the traditional sense of the
word,” Till says, “it became difficult,
strictly speaking, to understand the
balance between (physical) commercial
hedging in the futures markets and participation by those not involved in the
handling of the physical commodity.”

“The question now, especially in the
oil markets, is whether the scales have
not been tipped the other way,” she
says. “If there is more speculation than
is required for commercial hedging
needs, a futures market becomes one of
speculators trading with other speculators.”

Record Barnett HC content seen in combo play

the formation contains 70 million bbl

November.
“Hydrocarbons in place [are] more

charge so rich, Leiker said in describing
EOG as the only material participant in

EOG has drilled 100 wells in 3 years
in the combo play, with initial potential
rates at 300-1,000 b/d of oil, 130 b/d of

H

ere’s a first for the oil and gas
industry: Venezuela’s stateowned Petroleos de Venezuela SA
(PDVSA) plans to launch the country’s first plant to produce energysaving light bulbs.
The $280-million plant will produce 15 million bulbs the first year
and as many as 74 million units/year
during its first 5 years of operations.
The plant will be built in the
Paraguana free-trade zone by a joint
company of PDVSA subsidiary PDVSA
Industrial and Vietnam’s Dien Quang
Lamp JSC, which will provide the
technology and raw materials.
The announcement coincided
with reports that Venezuela has just
140 oil rigs in operation, down 36%
from the 222 rigs operating 2 years
ago—a drop in activity that raises
question marks.

that all goes well.

But all is not going well as a restart of Venezuela’s 165,000-b/d Petrocedeno heavy oil upgrader failed to

The facility, which upgrades
heavy oil from the country’s Orinoco
belt, remains shut for unscheduled
maintenance, while the 135,000-b/d
Petroanzoategui upgrader remains
shut due to boiler problems.
According to analyst IHS Global Insight, Venezuela has just four heavy oil

of two represents “a notable blow” to

All producing properties are unique
and have costs and benefits specific to
each stage of its life cycle.
As fields mature and operations
transition into the later stages of their
production cycle, decreasing revenue
streams, higher operating costs, and
fewer upside opportunities lead to declining profitability. Eventually, properties are abandoned when marginal
cost exceeds the marginal revenue of
production.
In Part 2 of this three-part series,
we categorize the inventory of committed assets in the shallow water Gulf
of Mexico and introduce the model
framework used to identify marginal
structures and the level of their future
production.

Model framework
The number of committed shallow
water structures classified as economic or marginal and the quantity and
value of their production is forecast
as follows:
• Initialization. Determine the production class of each structure, select the
model input variables, and quantify the
manner in which the input parameters
are expected to vary.
• Production forecast. Forecast future
production based on model parameters
assuming stable reservoir and investment conditions.
• Revenue forecast. Forecast future
revenue for assumed hydrocarbon
prices and marginal and abandonment
thresholds.
• Structure classification. Classify a structure as economic and its production
as economic when generated revenue
falls above the marginal threshold, and
a structure as marginal and its production as marginal when its gross revenue
falls above its abandonment threshold
but below its marginal threshold.
• Categorization. Categorize and count
the structure count, annual production,
and discounted future revenue from the
collection of economic and marginal
structures.

by a distribution function f i, i = 1, …,
6. The specification of each function
is determined by empirical analysis or
user preference.
For example, if the historic price of
oil is determined to follow a Lognormal distribution according to the parameters μ and σ2, Po ~ LN(μ, σ2), the
user may model future prices according
to this specification or may prefer to assume another distribution type, such as
the uniform distribution U(a, b) with
end points (a, b). Model variables are
held fixed for all structures across time
for each iteration of the simulation.

the parameters are already defined
through reasonably large intervals and
perturbations near the endpoints of the
interval in either direction (e.g., changing d ~ U(0.05, 0.30) to d ~ U(0.08,
0.25)) will only make an incremental
change in the design volume.
Changes in the dimensionality of the
design space, however, which would
occur by adding or deleting one or
more variables, will have a significant
impact since in this case the structural
aspects of the model have been modified.

Methodology

Design space
Variable selection
The user selects the input set depending upon the objectives of the
problem. The variables employed in
this analysis include: the price of oil
and gas (Po, Pg), the marginal and abandonment threshold multipliers (m, a),
and the discount rate (D).
An exponential model with decline
parameter d is associated with those
structures that do not have a sufficient
production history to perform regression analysis. The input parameters of
the model are denoted by the vector (d,
Po, Pg, m, a, D).

Parameter distribution
Each system parameter is governed

The distribution functions of the
model variables that are employed in
the simulation are shown in Table 3.
We refer to the collection of input variables and the intervals of their distributions as the design space ∑ shown by
Equation 1.
The design space serves to represent
reasonable bounds on the model parameters to help ensure that we encompass user beliefs in future scenarios. If
the distribution type or any parameter
interval of the design space changes,
output values and the coefficients of
the regression model will also change.
Fortunately, small perturbations in
∑ along one or more directions do not
change the output significantly, because

Production forecast
For each structure, the best-fit
production curve is used to forecast
future oil and gas production under the
assumption that production will not be
altered in the future due to reservoirproduction problems or additional
investment.
Extrapolating the results of an empirically derived equation to the future
assumes that all the factors affecting
performance in the past have exactly
the same cumulative effect in the
future. This is a strong assumption,
referred to as “stable reservoir and
investment conditions,” and the ability of our model to accurately reflect
future production is highly dependent

The value of τm(s) is fixed at a multiple

The discounted revenue of the
economic and marginal production
streams are computed utilizing an
industry-wide discount rate D. The
values of the economic, marginal, and
combined valuations—Ve(s), Vm(s), and
VT(s)—are given by Equations 17-19.

Simulation-regression analysis
The input parameters for each loop
of the simulation include (d, Po, Pg, m,
a, D) and the output include {σe(Γ),
σm(Γ), QoT(Γ), QTg(Γ), Ve(Γ), Vm(Γ),
VT(Γ)}, where Γ represents the aggregate of the five production classes
described previously (young, normal,
chaotic, latecomer, unknown).
The model curves used to forecast
production is fixed, with the exception of structures in the latecomer class
where a subset of profiles is modeled
with an assumed decline parameter.
The values of (d, Po, Pg, m, a, D) are
sampled from their respective distribution functions for each loop of the
simulation, the output metrics are computed, and after a sufficient number of
computations, the model outputs are
regressed against the input parameters.

Model structure
Model specification
A linear model is specified in Equation 20 that relates the output measures
to the input parameters. The value of
the output functions f are selected from
the set {Qie, Qim, QiT, Ve, Vm, VT} while
the input parameters (X1, X2, X3, X4, X5,
X6) = (d, Po, Pg, m, a, D).
A linear model is specified for ease
in interpretation; if model results turn
out to be unacceptable, or if significant
interaction effects are expected, it is
straightforward to apply a nonlinear
specification. The model coefficients
αi, i = 0, …, 6 are unique to f and will
vary with the size, shape, and dimension of the design space.

Expected signs
The signs of the model coefficients
are expected to follow certain values.
The coefficient α0 represents the

Tm

The cumulative production proﬁle evaluated at Tm(s) yields the economic production, Qe, and at abandonment Ta(s), the structure
has produced all of its reserves, QT. The quantity of marginal production is computed as Qm = QT – Qm.

fixed term (intercept) of the functional and its sign is indeterminate. The
inclusion/exclusion of the fixed term
coefficient in the formulation is user
dependent.
The coefficient α1 is associated with
d, which as discussed previously, defines the rate of decline for a subset of
latecomer structures (those structures
that did not yield best-fit curves or have
enough data to perform a forecast). The
magnitude of the coefficient α1 relative
to the other model coefficients depends
upon the proportion of total production
controlled by this subset of assets.
If d increases, and all other model
parameters are held fixed, structure
production will decline faster and reach
its economic limit sooner, and so the
quantity of reserves and its value will
decline. We would thus expect α1 < 0
for the functionals Qie, Qim, QiT, as well
as Vm, Ve, VT, since increasing d will
lead to declining cumulative production and value.
The coefficients α2 and α3 are associated with the price of oil and gas,
respectively. As Po and Pg increase, revenue streams for all assets will increase,
delaying the onset of the economic
limit. This will allow the production of
additional reserves, which at elevated
prices, will lead to a greater discounted
cash flow. Thus, increases (decreases)
in Po and Pg will lead to increases (decreases) of α2 and α3, and so we would

expect α2, α3 > 0 across all the functional outputs Qij and Vij (i = oil, gas; j
= m, e, T).
We expect differences to exist in the
relative magnitude of oil and gas price for
a particular asset (depending, say, if it is
primarily an oil or gas producer) and on
the stage of its life cycle; e.g., if it is economic or marginal. Because the value of
economic production is expected to be at
least an order-of-magnitude larger than a
marginal producer, oil and gas prices are
expected to play a more significant role
for economic production.
The coefficient α4 is associated with
the multiplier m, and the coefficient
α5 is associated with the multiplier a.
Recall that m and a are used to vary the
marginal and economic thresholds τm
and τa. The impact of the variation in
the multipliers varies depending upon
the functional under consideration.
The value of m ranges over a positive interval bounded below by a and
above by twice the upper limit of the
economic threshold interval. As m
increases, m·τm(s) will increase, and
production will become marginal at an
earlier time, decreasing the amount of
economic production (Qe) and its value
(Ve). Since marginal production occurs
at an earlier time and at a higher rate,
the amount of production that is classified as marginal (Qm) will subsequently
increase along with its value (Vm).
The value of the coefficient α4 is

thus expected to be negative for the
functionals Qe and Ve, and positive for
Qm and Vm. For the composite functionals QT and VT, coefficient α4 will
not enter into the model formulation
because there is no need to segment the
production and revenue streams.
The variable a ranges over a positive interval, and as a increases, a·τa(s)
will increase, forcing production out
of profitability at an earlier time. This
should not have a measurable impact
on Qe and Ve, but the change will reduce marginal production (Qm) and its
value (Vm). Thus, the coefficient α5 will
not enter into the economic production
model but is expected to be negative for
the functionals Qm and Vm. By linearity, QT and VT should also be negative.
Coefficient α5 will not enter into the Qe
and Ve functional since the amount and
value of economic production is not
influenced by what happens at the end
of the life of the structure.
The coefficient α6 is associated with
the discount rate D used to compute
present value, and thus, will only influence the valuation estimates Vm, Ve,
and VT. The manner in which discount
rate varies with present value is well
known: as D increases, the value of future revenue declines, and so we expect
the sign of coefficient α6 to be negative
for all three valuation functionals.
Further, since changes in discount
rate have a greater impact on early cash
flows, we would expect that the magnitude of α6 would be greater for Ve than
Vm since it is defined earlier in the life
of cycle of the asset. Coefficient α6 is not
included in the model specification for
cumulative production since it is only
relevant in the valuation estimate.

The work involved running a simulation that used the Peng Robinson Sour

the simulation obtained the match,
the next step entered the maximum

a process simulation.
The maximum PRS simulated flows
provided the basis for sizing the equipment for the upgrade.

EnCana Corp.’s Weyburn Saskatchewan oil battery reinjects dense-phase
CO2 for enhancing oil recovery. The
battery separates produced gas from
the oil and then compresses the gas
for recycling it back into the reservoir
together with CO2 obtained from the

Because the associated and produced

that includes:
• Two 10,000-bbl and one 33,000bbl custom built water tanks.
• Two 10,000-bbl oil tanks.
• One 5,000-bbl slop tank.

The objective of the process design
was to debottleneck the tank’s vaporhandling equipment. The steps involved
were:
1. Build a model of the Weyburn
battery and vapor-handling unit. Note,
the Oil & Gas Journal article (Nov. 16,
2006, p. 43) gave the composition of
the oil and gas for the restaged compression and new pump installation.
2. Compare actual operating conditions (Tables 4 and 5), mainly the flow
to the VRU, with the battery model in
Step 1.
3. Match the battery model with the

This article is the third and final
in a series (OGJ, Nov. 23, 2009, p. 50;
Dec. 7, 2009, p. 48) on the effects of
recent developments on refineries and
their use of gases to meet new regulatory and legislative requirements while
avoiding major investments.
This article addresses refineries’ use
of specialty gases, which are used in
small quantities but are nevertheless of
high value for refineries.
These gases especially help the refinery to ensure the correct product quality and meet regulations with respect to
emissions into the environment.
Gas production plants are also discussed.

Specialty gases in
refineries
Specialty gases are either very pure
gases, rare gases, or gas mixtures of
very high mixing accuracy used in such
demanding applications as quality measurement for products and off-streams
in the field and in the labs. Besides
calibration purposes, this includes
application as utilities for operation of
such analytical devices as gas chromatographs.
These gases play an important,
though not easily visible part in refineries, contributing to the optimum
economy of a refinery.
Major specialty-gas companies can
provide the complete range of specialty
gases, both standard and tailored products, plus the services and equipment
necessary for efficient use. In large
companies, specialty gases are based on
a long history of expertise and performance. These companies generally
know or can determine what refiners
need.

For instance, measuring gasoline
quality checks the result with the help
of instruments calibrated with specialty gas mixtures. Carrier gases in
gas chromatography are high-purity
specialty gases. In emission control,
specialty gases help to detect hazardous
materials. During a turnaround of, for
example, a distillation tower, one needs
a specialty gas mixture for leak detection.
Following are some
examples
of application fields in
which specialty gases
and expertise in refining processes can
make a big difference in economy.

ply of gases as utilities. For example,
flame ionization detectors in refineries
analyze hydrocarbons that are burned
in these detectors by addition of fuels,
such as H2 and an oxidant, typically
artificial air. Even traces of hydrocarbons in this air stream would disturb
the readings of the FID.
Controlling the quality of a product,
especially concentration, involves comparing it with a specified gas mixture,
the calibration gas. Such highly defined gases are needed not only for gas
chromatography but also for calibration
of other analytical instruments as, for
example, ultraviolet or infrared spectrometers. Tailored gas mixtures are
provided according to the specifications
of the refinery, especially mixtures of
hydrocarbons in H2, H2S in N2, hydrocarbons in butane, a specified amount
(in parts per million) of CO in helium,
mercaptans in helium, hydrocarbon
mixtures in CO, and hydrocarbon mixtures in propane.
In addition, gases are provided for
measurement during production, as
in process control. These include, for
example, mixtures of hydrocarbons in
methane or in H2, methane in CO2, a
specified amount (ppm) of O2 in N2, a
specified amount (ppm) of CO in N2,
and SO2 in N2.

Leak detection
Many systems in a refinery are
checked for leaks with helium or
helium mixtures. Tight systems are essential in any refinery section, whether
piping in a sulfur-recovery unit or
fractionator column of a fluid catalytic
cracker. A leak of poisonous gas from a
Claus plant or an explosive gas from a
FCC unit can be disastrous.
Leak-testing procedures often use a
gas mixture of helium in nitrogen. The
helium passes through any leaks and is
detected on the outside by a “sniffer,” a
mass spectrometer.

Stack control
Refineries must strictly control their
emissions to the atmosphere. Chief
among the toxic and hazardous pollutants are SO2, CO2, H2S, and NOx; but
also CO must not be neglected.
The concentration of this highly
toxic compound is always of concern
when hydrocarbons are burnt, as in
boilers. For example, when the regenerator of an FCC unit is operated in
partial-burn mode and corresponding
effluent gas is heavily loaded with CO,
the efficiency of its combustion to CO2
is especially important. For incinerator systems generally, a certain surplus
of oxidation air is a precondition for

proper operation and therefore must be
controlled.
For example gases containing appreciable amounts of so-called “totally
reduced sulfur compounds,” such as
COS, CS2, and especially H2S—typically
stemming from Claus units—are not
only toxic but also prone to cause
odors. Therefore such gases must be
incinerated to gain exclusively SO2 as a
sulfur-bearing emission component.
Correspondingly, for control of
stack-gas quality, not only H2S and SO2
are measured but also oxygen content.
Corresponding O2 on line analyzer—
often on the basis of a paramagnetic
measuring principle—for the sake
of precision must be calibrated with
a gas mixture of O2 in nitrogen that
resembles the expected composition of
the required O2 content of the emission
stream, that is, only a few percent of O2
per volume.
Sometimes analysis of emissions
takes place at the top of a stack requiring calibration at that point. As climbing a stack carrying a bulky and heavy
gas bottle is hard and risky, a small and
easily portable calibration gas cylinder
was developed for that purpose.
One widely used technique for measuring gaseous emissions is gas chromatography with a suitable detector, as
the FID described previously.
Another type of detector for
monitoring hydrocarbons is the photoionization detector. The PID has the
advantage of requiring no fuel gas, such
as hydrogen. But the disadvantage is
that it is insensitive to C1-C3 saturated
hydrocarbons because these are quite
stable compounds that are not easily
ionized. When looking for traces of
sulfur-containing compounds, for example, a flame photometric detector is
suitable. The electron-capture detector
is particularly sensitive to halogenated
compounds, which in general are easily
charged by electron addition.
A gas chromatograph plus mass
spectrometer as a detection system is
frequently used for identifying compounds in exhaust gases because this
combination is not only capable of

On site supply
Refiners have several options to
fulfill higher industrial gas needs. Of
course, gas production plants can be
bought from competent suppliers. That
necessarily means that the complete investment shows up in the balance sheet
of the refinery. In addition, operation
and maintenance costs have to be borne
by the refinery.
All this is conventional procedure
with advantages and disadvantages.
The main disadvantage certainly is that
refiners are not specialized in gas plant
operation. Therefore reliability of the
plants tends to be lower than optimum
and the cost higher. But there is an
alternative which gains more and more
friends among the refining community: “on site supply.”
The basic idea behind on site supply
is that a gas company builds, owns, and
operates the gas production plant for
the refinery and the refiner receives the
gas as a utility so that it can concentrate
on its core business, making fuel.
For on site supply of industrial gases,
the gas supplier takes on the investment
for the plant and the operating risks.
The refineries provide the necessary
working materials, such as methane for
a steam methane reformer or cooling
water for heat exchangers. The result is
that the refinery receives the required
gases and bears no obligation for the
operation of the gas generation facility.
This arrangement affords the refinery several advantages:
• The gas plant is operated by a gas
company for which this is core busi50

ness. The gas companies have experience from operating many such plants.
The on site concept secures this experience for the refinery, and as a result the
refinery has a reliable gas supply and
can concentrate on its own operations.
• The gas supplier takes on the investment in the gas plant. The refinery
has less capital tied up for industrial
gases.
• The gas company can build the
gas plant according to its standards, allowing repeat engineering, which saves
money. In addition spare parts can be
standardized and stored centrally for
specific types of gas plants. This also
reduces cost so that gas from an on site
plant is usually cheaper compared with
a gas plant owned by the refinery.
• With on site supply, the gas operation is usually not part of the refinery balance sheet. Thus the refinery’s
equity ratio improves and can foster a
better rating. In turn the refinery may
enjoy improving financial flexibility
for this site.
The proper contractual arrangement
is critical of course. The accounting
practices that apply at the refinery location, such as Generally Accepted Accounting Practices in the US or International Accounting Standards in the EU,
have a major influence. This point can
only be mentioned here, not discussed
in detail, as conditions depend on each
location.
The gas company owning the on site
plant takes on the risk of a high capital
investment. The term of the contract
with the refinery will be based on the
expected service life of the gas plant,

usually 15 years. That time frame can
be calculated shorter for small, standardized units, such as containerized
nitrogen plants. These units can be
reused more easily for other customers
after the contract expires.
Because oxygen and nitrogen are
usually not required in liquid form, on
site plants do not involve expensive liquefaction energy for production. Without truck shipment, costs are lower and
the operation is “greener.” Hydrogen,
too, is used only as a gas in refining applications so that expensive liquefaction
is not required in an on site plant.
Beginning in the 1980s, the concept
of on site supply began to spread. It
succeeded especially in the industrialized countries where it largely displaced the old regional gas distributors
in many areas.
Under favorable conditions, conversion to on site supply can reduce gas
costs, often by more than 10%. ✦

tion, particularly in bedded (vs. domed) salt deposits. The rapid solution-mining tool
can increase salt production sharply
compared with conventional solution
mining, accelerating storage construction. The tool also reduces debris settling in the bottom of a cavern.

Background
China’s second West-East natural gas
pipeline is under construction. Work
includes associated underground gas
storage salt caverns. Construction of salt
caverns requires finding an appropriate salt dome or salt bed, drilling a well
into the formation, and injecting fresh
water to dissolve and extract a certain
amount of salt to get a specified volume
and shape.1 Bedded salt deposits are
widespread and used as much or more
than diapiric salt bodies to host storage
facilities. These deposits are layered and
interspersed with non-salt sedimentary materials such as anhydrite, shale,
dolomite, and limestone.2
Solution mining bedded-salt formations by conventional methods is
difficult. Dissolving and shear stress of
circulated fluid break thin, weak interlayers, but thick and hard interlayers are
difficult to break efficiently, slowing the
dissolution rate and changing the salt
cavern’s shape. The erosion of interlayers
also generates insoluble debris that settle
at the bottom of salt cavern.
Too many interlayers will deposit
much of the debris at the bottom, reducing the effective dissolution volume
of the salt cavern, especially in the
pocket construction stage, forcing relocation of the mining pipe to a higher
position to achieve rapid solution mining and optimal cavern shape.
This article details a new method of
rapid solution mining via numerical
simulation and field testing of a new
self-resonated cavitation jet.

cavitation jet can also produce high
frequency, high-radiation supersonic
waves, creating lower brine viscosity,
better flow ability, and a higher masstransfer rate.9 The noise wave impact on
the salt rock surface also causes fatigue
fracture which can enhance the salt
dissolution rate. The energy from the
noise transferring to the salt surface can
also potentially create severe vibration
and accelerate salt diffusion.
• Helical flow. The action of the lateral
water jets rotating as four agitator arms
(Fig. 4) rotates the fluid in the cavern
as a helical flow with a vertical rotation
axis. The fluid velocity on the surface
of the salt rock increases and the flow
direction can be changed, enhancing the mass transfer of salt molecules
near the wall. The process also changes
the brine’s flow pattern in the cavern,
increasing the convective diffusion of
saturated brine.
The rotation jets and helical flow
also improve efficiency of debris cleanout and reduce settlement in the bottom of the cavern. Debris broken from
the interlayers suspends and moves out
with the circulated fluid immediately,
and debris settled in the bottom is lifted and suspended by the rotary impact
of the three downward directional jets,
moving out with the helical fluid.
• Forced circulation. The high-pressure
water jets force fresh water to the rock
surface quickly. This forced circulation changes the horizontal and vertical
distribution of concentration of brine
and enhances the convective diffusion of
saturated brine near the wall, improving
the salt-dissolution rate dramatically.

Numerical simulation
A numerical simulation carried out
with a 3D cylinder model (5 m high by
2 m diameter) researched the helical
flow and efficiency of debris cleanout
on the basis of two-fluid Euler-Euler
model and RNG κ – ε model. Field

Responses reveal
more than e-mails
in ‘Climategate’
In the controversy known as “Climategate,” responses by chagrined climate
activists reveal even more than embarrassing e-mails.
“There is no alternative theory that
the minority is proposing,” declared Rep.
Ed Markey (D-Mass.), at a hearing of the
House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming. “The deniers have decided to use a small number

of e-mails as a way to cast doubt.”
False. There is indeed an alternative
theory. It is that natural forces contribute
far more than human emissions of greenhouse gases do to global warming.
But that theory, like any refinement that
doesn’t support imposition of martial law
on energy markets, has been systematically derided as unserious science.
Now, however, e-mails leaked or stolen
from the University of East Anglia in
the UK show scientists important to the
urgent-response agenda distorting data
and gaming academic journals to marginalize opponents.
The e-mails uphold suspicions that the
campaign to engineer climate feeds more
off propaganda than science, that it depends on the immunization of a questionable theory against question.
With shameful help from the popular
media, activists have successfully depicted questioners as corrupt loons. After
East Anglia, the ploy won’t work.
So overextended politicians like Markey
resort to falsehood as their exertions to
suppress debate become desperate.
Equally appalling is the statement of
Nicholas Stern, a professor at the London
School of Economics and Political Science
who, while working in the UK government, led a 2006 study that said benefits
of strong warming precautions outweigh
costs.
“People have the right to speak up,”
Stern said after the East Anglia dust-up,
according to the Telegraph newspaper
of London. “But if they are muddled and
confused then they do not have the right
to be described as anything other than
muddled and confused on the basis of the
arguments they set out and what is wrong
with them.”
Stern’s argument by characterization is
typical, and his assertion is false. The case
against precipitous response to warming
is as clear and unconfused as any on the
other side.
That it hasn’t received a fair hearing is
the biggest part of the scandal.

Gas oil market out to sea
Barring an extremely cold winter and stronger-than-expected economic recovery, the phenomenon of gas oil inventories stored at sea in transport vessels will
continue next year, said analysts at Deutsche Bank AG.
Best estimates indicate nearly 100 million bbl of gas oil are now in floating storage around the globe, much of it off Europe. However, weather forecasters expect
above-normal temperatures in northern Europe through much of December.
“While floating gas oil has been symptomatic of the global downturn, it’s now
become a fundamental overhang on the market as industry participants struggle
to make sense of this phenomenon in oil supply-demand balances,” Deutsche
Bank analysts reported Dec. 4. “This will continue to weigh on the gas oil complex
and margins next year at a time when refiners, particularly in the US and Europe,
are struggling to cope with the rapid increase in new refinery capacity in China
and India.”
Because there is no official reporting system, it’s difficult to say how much
gas oil is stored in vessels at sea. The International Energy Agency estimated
60 million bbl of oil and 80 million bbl of distillates were in floating storage at
the end of October. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries put the
numbers at 40 million bbl of crude and 90 million bbl of distillates. ICAP Shipping
International Ltd. projected 90 million bbl of distillates in floating storage by the
end of November. That is expected to grow to 97 million bbl in December—a fivefold increase in floating distillate stocks within 9 months. Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland, earlier said, “If the current rate of increase in distillate
floating stocks continues, we would have at the end of March 2010 more distillate
stocks on water than we had in March 2008 in the total onshore US (OGJ Online,
Nov. 30, 2009).”
Based on their reading of industry surveys and media reports, Deutsche Bank
analysts estimate global gas oil inventories on the water has grown to 100 million
bbl, up from estimates of 24 million bbl as of last April.
Converging factors
The highly unusual buildup of seaborne inventories of gas oil (diesel and heating oil) began early this year as the result of a combination of factors. Deutsche
Bank analysts said, “Shipping rates were crushed due to the recessionary impact
on oil flows and that coincided with the completion of a significant number of
new vessels that were added to the global fleet. The recessionary impact on
diesel demand was global, but more pronounced in the US and Europe, and
also resulted in a persistent and deep contango…as wide as $3.15/bbl in June
this year, on a monthly average basis.” With onshore inventories already near
capacity, it became economic for the first time to store gas oil on vessels for an
extended period.
Some portion of floating gas oil, albeit not the dominant share, is stored on very
large crude carriers, each of which can hold up to 2 million bbl, Deutsche Bank reported. “The use of VLCCs to transport clean products such as gasoline or gas oil
is hardly if ever done given contamination issues. Transporting gas oil in a vessel
that had been carrying crude oil likely will result in gas oil product that is off-specification and unmarketable,” analysts said. “The VLCCs being used to store gas oil
are brand new to the fleet; hence their holds have not been coated with crude so
they can carry clean products without resulting in off-spec product.”
Meanwhile, refinery runs have remained low so far this year, down 540,000 b/d
on average from a year ago. Deutsche Bank analysts reported gas oil production is
sharply lower at an average 300,000 b/d. They estimated 4% of US refinery capacity was idled this year because of unprofitable margins. In Europe, at least 8% of
capacity was idled “either permanently or for an extended period of time due to
poor margins,” they said.
Bank analysts foresee three possible scenarios for heating oil:
• An average winter would result in lowering heating oil demand by 8.6% for
October 2009 through March 2010. “This is exaggerated due to a very cold winter…that boosted demand by 14% October 2008 to March 2009,” they said.
• If this winter proves to be the coldest in 5 years, analysts said, heating oil demand would climb 120,000 b/d above the baseline but still down 3.7% for the year.
• The warmest winter in 5 years would slash demand 170,000 b/d below the
baseline, down 15% on a year-on-year basis.

Advancing Reservoir Performance

Plugging and Abandoning
Hurricane-Damaged Wells
Vented Inﬂatable System Eliminates Gas
Bubbles, Enables Successful Cement Plugs
Many hurricane-damaged wells in the Gulf of Mexico have to be
permanently plugged and abandoned. Operators have discovered
that many of these wells are bubbling, which creates challenges
when placing cement barriers in the wells.

Gas Bubbles Passing Through Microannuli
Inflatable packers such as Baker Oil Tools’ Production Injection Packer
(PIP), deployed as a pressure sealing base on which a cement plug is
placed, is often a suitable fix for this problem. However, gas bubbles
sometimes find a way around the PIP and work their way through the
cement, creating microannuli even after the cement sets up. These
bubbles travel through microscopic pits or fissures in the old casing.
This was the challenge an operator faced in a High Island well with
26-in., 125 lbf casing.

Vented PIP System
To solve this problem reliably and economically, Baker Hughes developed
the Vented PIP System, a new method of stopping the flow of bubbles.
The system consists of a PIP (with a ball on seat below it), a length of
vent tubing above it, and a mechanical disconnect on top of that.

Bubbles in Well Stopped Immediately
Once the system was set at depth, bubbles in the well stopped
immediately. Simultaneously, a substantial flow of gas was observed
through the work string at surface. The operator then ran a grout string
(small work string) beside the primary work string to a depth just above
the inflated element. Cement was then pumped through the grout string
on top of the PIP. A cement volume was pumped that equaled about
50 ft in the annulus between the 26-in. casing ID and the OD of the
2 7/8-in. tubing. While this cement cured, the vent tubing and work
string were kept open to vent the gas to surface. This prevented gas
buildup below the PIP and kept bubbles from affecting the cement job.
Once the cement had completely cured, a cast iron bridge plug was run
through the primary work string and set in the vent tubing above the
PIP. This resulted in a permanently plugged well.

Leaders in Renewable Energy

A New Power
In the last decade, Spain has emerged
as a world leader in renewable energy
production and technology

S

pain’s abundant natural resources
have long been celebrated – it is the
sunniest and also one of the windiest countries
in Europe. But it is only in recent years that the
technology and the regulatory framework have
been developed which have meant that these
resources can now be harnessed.
The results have been dramatic. For the
last five years, Spain has been installing on
average 2000MW per year of wind capacity
alone. Wind energy has now overtaken
hydroelectricity as a contributor to Spain’s
total energy, with installed wind power
capacity rising to 16,740MW at the end of
2008, from 2,198MW in 2000, and is
heading for a target of 20,155MW in 2010.

20% target for the share of renewables in total
energy consumption and a 10% share in
transport fuels in 2020.
“The Renewable Energy Plan set a
photovoltaic target of under 400MW for 2010,
and we are already at around 3,500MW, while
we had a 500MW target for solar thermal, and
with the requests that we are seeing we could
easily reach 1,000MW,” says Spain’s Secretary
of State for Energy, Pedro Marín Uribe. “We
are clearly going to meet our targets for 2010
in terms of electricity generation, and we will
probably beat them easily.”
Motivated partly by concerns over security

needs coming from imports, successive

energy as bringing environmental and energy
security benefits, as well as enhancing local
employment and economic development.”
And not only has this policy resulted in a
securer, more diversified and cleaner energy
mix, but it has also spawned a group of world
leading companies in the sector, including
Iberdrola, the largest renewable energy
producer in the world, Acciona and turbine
manufacturer Gamesa, and solar and biofuels
leader Abengoa. According to Spanish wind
power association, AEE, Spanish companies
have now installed over 8000MW of wind
power worldwide.
“I think that first of all the fact that in Spain
regulations have been stable, and returns have
been predictable and sufficient, has led to the
right conditions needed for the sector to
develop,” says Xabier Viteri, CEO of Iberdrola
Renovables, the renewable energy arm of
Iberdrola. “Spain also has the renewable
resources available, and it has invested in
improving infrastructure, particularly in
electricity, which has enabled the sector
to grow. Companies such as ours
are now a source of job
creation and of innovation,
and I think that Spain can
be a good example for
other countries.”
“Other countries have
chosen different policies,
such as waiting for renewable
energy to be cheaper, before
incorporating it in their energy
system,” Pedro Marín Uribe
explains. “But we have chosen to
invest in technology. I think that
this is one of the only times in the
history of Spain that we have made such a
strong commitment to a new technology. We
are investing in a technology which is still
expensive….so that our companies can be
well positioned and competitive in the
international market.”

“During 2008, we installed an additional
1.8GW in Spain, which represents about 2-3%
of the global market, a huge proportion of
the global market,” says Alfonso Faubel, vice
president of Alstom Wind. “I think this has
been possible due to the Spanish government’s
policy, as they really have a clear renewable
energy policy that is good for climate change
and good for creating jobs.”
Juan Araluce, President of rival Vestas
Mediterranean, agrees with that assessment.
“The level of activity in Spain has been such
that we have four manufacturing facilities in
Spain, he says. “Our annual exports from
Spain now represent two billion euros, and we
have 1800 workers in Spain in factories,
maintenance, etc. We hope that this figure
reaches 2500 people by 2012.”
The renewable energy sector has not been
immune to the global economic slowdown,
in Spain or elsewhere. Spain has been hit
particularly hard by the downturn, and by the
collapse of its own housing and construction
boom, with the European Commission
expecting a 3.7% fall in GDP in 2009.
With the government’s fiscal position
under pressure, its assistance to the renewable
energy sector has come under scrutiny from
some quarters, and it has slashed subsidies to
the solar sector and is tightening up its

requirements for support to wind power. But
Enrique Díaz-Tejeiro, chairman of Solaria, the
only solar power company that is listed on the
Spanish stock exchange, believes that cutting
subsidies will serve as a strong incentive to the
sector. “A subsidy is always a kind of smoke.
It is an interesting way to help but only for
short-term purposes…we believe that
subsidies should always have been less than
what they have been up till now, and it’s up to
the companies, by setting a good example in
reducing costs, to see that the photovoltaic
industry becomes competitive.”
And Rafael Gimeno, who runs the Madrid
Renewable Energy cluster, is also upbeat on
the future of the industry in Spain: “of course
the current economic climate will lead to
slower growth rates than in the past, but a lot
of countries, and Spain is one of them, have
made a major political commitment to the
development of green energy. I think that once
we get through this crisis, we will again see job
creation in the sector, and even at a higher
rate than before.”
With continued political and regulatory
support, and with nearly unrivalled experience
and know-how across the country, Spain seems
set to remain in the vanguard of the global
renewable energy industry.

Leaders in Renewable Energy

Spanish energy policy has also transformed
the landscapes of historic regions such as
Andalusia and Castilla La Mancha, bringing
state of the art technology and innovation
across the country, and has turned
cities such as Madrid and Barcelona
into world leading centers for
research and development into
renewable energy.
“In terms of megawattage in
renewable energy, Catalonia has
practically 18 times the MW that Provence
has installed, and Provence is the most
advanced region in France in photovoltaic
energy and renewable energy,” says Josep
Huguet i Biosca, the Regional Minister for
Innovation, Universities and Companies of
Catalonia. “In the Mediterranean region, Spain
is by far the most advanced country in the
region, whether it be in photovoltaic, or thermo
solar or wind.”
The rapid growth of the market in Spain,
and the accompanying increase in industry
know-how, is also attracting significant levels
of foreign investment from the likes of
Vestas of Denmark and Alstom of France,
which in 2007 acquired wind turbine
manufacturer Ecotècnia for 350 million
euros, and which now runs its wind turbine
business out of Barcelona.

Windmill Giants
Wind: Main Players

It is Don Quixote’s worst nightmare. Companies such
as Iberdrola, Acciona and Gamesa have become major
players in the global wind energy market.

R

Privileged position
The Spanish wind power sector has become a
major contributor to national exports and GDP:
according to a Deloitte study for Spanish wind
power association AEE, the Spanish sector is
now composed of over 700 companies, which
are active in 27 countries, employing 37,730
people and contributing 0.35% of GDP. In
2008, the sector supplied 11.5% of Spain’s
electricity needs, after adding 10,532MW of
capacity in the last five years.

egulatory support for wind energy
from the government, including
favorable feed-in tariffs, and private sector
investment have not only helped to diversify
and secure Spain’s energy supply, but have
also turned Spanish wind farm developers
and technology suppliers into global leaders
in the sector.
“The support of the Spanish government
has not only helped our company within
Spanish boundaries, but it has helped Spain
expand its business to new markets,” says
Alfonso Faubel, Vice President of turbine
manufacturer Alstom Wind.
And with growth in Spain now under
pressure from controversial new legislation,
the local wind power sector is increasingly
focused on overseas opportunities, particularly
in the United States.
“The US is the leading country in terms of
installed wind power capacity, but as a
percentage of electricity generation it is still
very limited compared to some European
countries, such as Spain,” says Xabier Viteri,
chief executive officer of Iberdrola Renovables,
“there is still a lot of room to grow.”
“The US government has also demonstrated
a clear will to commit to our sector, and we
think that we are now in the position where
we can invest more than 6 billion dollars in
the US from 2009-2012.”

ALSTOM ECOTÈCNIA 100
Alstom has always been at the forefront of innovation in wind power – its subsidiary Ecotècnia
installed the first wind turbine in Spain – and in
October 2009 the company inaugurated the first
wind farm to be equipped with the world’s most
powerful wind turbine, the ecotècnia 100.
The giant 140 metre high turbines are the highest capacity production line onshore turbines in
the world, with a nominal power of 3MW each.
Because of the size of each turbine, less land area
is required by the generator.
The scale and design of the ecotècnia 100 means
that maximum benefit can be achieved from the
wind; each turbine has a rotor diameter of 100
metres and a blade length of 48.8 metres.
In terms of reliability, the turbine has a unique
stress-reducing design which protects the gearbox
and increases the longevity of the equipment,
while the design of the nacelle enables easier
equipment maintenance.
The milestone was achieved at the opening of the
Vieux Moulin wind farm, near Pithiviers in the
Essonne valley in France. The operator of the wind
farm is Energias de Portugal Renovaveis.

sets to the US in 2007 and 2008, with overall
exports rising from just $45.8 million in 2003
to $467.7 million in 2008.
“The effort that we have made as a country
in wind energy means that we are now in a
privileged position,” says José Javier Armendáriz,
director general of CENER, the National
Renewable Energy Centre, “we are in a leading
position in Europe and in the US.”
And with President Obama saying that he
aims to follow the Spanish lead in renewable
energy, the presence of Spanish companies in
the US wind power sector now seems set to rise.
“It is clearly great news that President Obama
has cited Spain as an example in renewable
energy,” says Spain’s Secretary of State for Energy
Pedro Marín Uribe. “I believe that our companies
can play a major role in this area in the US. So
far the experience of our companies in the US
has been very positive…our companies and
our government are interested in working with
the US on making the development of
renewable energy in the world a reality.”
In the global equipment market, Spain’s
Gamesa is the world’s number three producer
of wind turbines, with 10.8% market share in
2008, behind Vestas and GE, while Acciona
had 4.1% of the market.
“On a global scale, Spain represents 12%
of all Vestas sales, which is extremely high for
one country and for a country that is so
relatively small,” says Juan Araluce, President
of Vestas Mediterranean.
Meanwhile, according to BTM Consult’s
World Market Update 2008, in terms of
installed wind power capacity Iberdrola
Renovables is the world number one, with
8,960MW installed, while Acciona is at
number four with 4,566MW and Endesa is
eighth with 1,925MW.
“This is probably the first time that Spain is
leading the world,” says Juan Verde, President
of the Climate Project Spain, the local branch
of the organisation founded by Al Gore which
aims to raise public awareness about climate

change. “Spain missed the boat in the industrial
revolution and then in the IT revolution of the
1980s and 1990s, but now the companies will
be able to grow internationally and lead the
transformation in the US.”
In Spain itself, Iberdrola Renovables has
27% of installed wind power capacity, ahead
of Acciona, with 16%, Endesa with 10%, and
Eufer, a joint venture between Union Fenosa
and Italy’s Enel, on 4%.
In the Spanish wind turbine market,
Gamesa has a 49% share, ahead of Vestas on
14.7%, while number three player Alstom
Wind is now expanding rapidly in the Spanish
market, with share of 13.7% in 2008.
And in addition to the economic impact of
wind energy, the environmental consequences
of the sector’s expansion have also been
significant: in 2008, wind power in Spain
avoided 18 million tons of CO2 emissions.

Climate Project Spain’s President Juan Verde.

being so dependent on the tourism and
construction sectors and be more sustainable
in the long term. Spain really has a story to tell
other nations.”

New legislation
However, new legislation published in May
2009 has served to dampen some enthusiasm
in the sector.
In an attempt to reduce subsidy payments
at a time of rising budget deficits, and to
increase its control over the energy sector, the
government has established a pre-registration
condition for wind power developers,
imposing a series of financial and operating

requirements on the developers before they
can benefit from the special tariffs for wind
power. These pre-qualification requirements,
which include making a financial deposit,
have added a new layer of red tape and have
led to a slowdown in the market.
“Recently the legislation has become a lot
tougher for our customers”, says Alstom
Wind’s Mr. Faubel. “We are seeing that this is
creating a bit of stagnation in the market…It is
similar to what has happened in the USA,
where until the stimulus package was
published there was a total stagnation in the
industry. The Royal Decree has created a
similar situation, but of course not as serious.”

also voice their concern: “while we have this
uncertainty, the banks are not providing
finance, and the whole industry is in a stagnant
state,” says Juan Araluce of Vestas.
“For the wind industry in Spain, it is
fundamental to have a stable legislation which
supports the development of this sector,” says
Javier Perea, Managing Director, Commercial
Construction and Services at Gamesa.
Regional politicians are also opposed to
the law. “We need the legislative crisis to be
sorted out at national level,” says Salvador
Marín, the Minister for Universities, Enterprise
and Research in the region of Murcia. “For an
investment to be made, it needs to have clarity,
stability, and security.”
“We don’t like the new legislation because
it was approved by the cabinet without
consulting either the sector or the regions,”
says Antonio Cejalvo Lapeña of Aven, the
Valencia Energy Agency. “The law doesn’t
endanger investments that have already been
made, as they have guaranteed sale prices for
electricity, but it could threaten future
developments.”
The result of this slowdown in the domestic
market is that Spanish wind power companies
are now focused on overseas markets.
“Because of the situation that has been
created in Spain, all of the companies in the
sector are looking to the exterior,” says José
Maria González Pérez, chairman of renewable

Wind: Main Players

Klondike, in Portland, Oregon (US), is the biggest windfarm owned by Iberdrola Renovables with 400MW.

Setting the Pace
It was back in 2001, long before the start of the
global renewable energy boom, that Ignacio
Galán, then the newly appointed chief
executive officer of Iberdrola and now also the
company’s chairman, decided that renewable
energy would be one of the cornerstones of
Iberdrola’s new growth strategy.
The implementation of that strategy has
seen Iberdrola, from its base in Bilbao in the
Basque Country, grow into what is now the
world’s largest producer of renewable energy,
after investing an unrivalled 10 billion euros
in installing almost 10,500MW of renewable
energy capacity. For 2010, the company has
a target of raising that level to about
12,500MW of installed capacity.
It is its continuing ability to seize on
market opportunities early in the day that
time and time again has seen Iberdrola
consolidate its leadership of the global
renewable energy sector. Recent proof of this
has been its acquisition of Scottish Power in
2007 and of Energy East in the US in 2008,
just as the UK and the US were embarking
on a major drive in renewable energy.
Again with perfect timing, in December
2007 Iberdrola sold a 20% stake of its
renewable energy subsidiary Iberdrola
Renovables, in a $6 billion initial public
offering. The company is now the tenth
largest in the blue chip IBEX-35 index and
has a presence in 23 countries.
And although Iberdrola Renovables is

US entry by 2011. Faubel says that the company
is currently preparing the ECO100 to the US
specifications, “for customers who want larger
turbines to maximize yield on their terrain.”
The high reliability and high energy yield
of the new platforms will be critical as Alstom
turns its attentions to the markets of China and
the US. “Because of the availability of sites with
less wind, you need to have a product that will
function in these conditions, so the Eco 100 and

Regions Transformed

Regions

The Spanish industrial landscape is being transformed,
as regional governments look to leverage their natural
resources and diversify their economies

T

he town of Puertollano lies at the edge
of the central Spanish plain of Castilla
La Mancha, right before the frontier with the
rolling mountains of Andalusia, and was once
nothing but a sleepy agricultural village, until
the discovery of extensive coal deposits and
the construction of a petrochemical complex
and oil refinery turned it into the industrial
heart of the region.
Now Puertollano is undergoing its second
transformation, with the coal mines replaced
by factories producing solar panels and
wafers, by wind farms and by research centers
into hydrogen cells and concentrated solar
power. Iberdrola Renovables opened its first
solar thermal plant here in May 2009, while
leading solar player Solaria produces solar
modules from its factory in Puertollano.
Puertollano is just the clearest example of
how the Spanish industrial landscape is being
transformed by renewable energy, as across Spain,
regional governments aggressively support the
sector, in order to bring added value and high
technology to their economies, and to diversify
away from construction and tourism.
That Puertollano is located in Castilla La
Mancha is no coincidence. It was in the blazing
heat and windswept plains of this region that
Don Quixote set off on his quests, and today
the region has more wind power than any other
in Spain, with over 3,500MW installed, and
over 800MW of photovoltaic solar.
The wind and the sun by themselves have
not engineered this boom in renewable energy:
in 1998, Paula Fernández Pareja, Minister for
Industry, Energy and Environment in the region,
explains, the regional government made a strategic
commitment to renewable energy, and since then
has prioritized renewable energy investments in
local legislation and in infrastructure development.
Other Spanish regions have been slower to
support the development of wind energy. The
IEA noted in its September 2009 survey of Spain
that one specific area for improvement is the large
discrepancy in permitting and siting procedures
that exist in different autonomous regions.

Iberdrola Renovables’ first solar thermal plant.

This issue is being addressed by Catalonia,
which plans to increase wind power capacity
from 86.7MW in 2003 to 3500MW in 2015,
according to Mr Antoni Castells, Minister of
Finance, Economy and Energy. In order to
meet this target, Castells explains, the regional
government is streamlining the permit process:
“we have just signed a new decree for wind
power in Catalonia, whereby we can approve
wind power plants in a much easier and more
efficient manner.”
Within Catalonia’s Energy
Plan 2006-2015, Catalonia
has set ambitious targets to
quadruple consumption of
renewable energy, reaching a
total of 11% of total energy
consumption by 2015. As Castells explains “we
are certainly on the right path towards achieving
our objectives for 2015. When we came into
government in 2003, in wind power alone we
were producing only 86.7MW and today we are
producing 496MW. The economic recession is
opening up a whole new industrial sector of
renewable energy, we believe that it will be one

of the fastest growing sectors of the future and in
Catalonia we are prepared for this.”
Meanwhile, the capital Madrid, which has
less wind and solar resources than other regions
in Spain, is investing heavily in turning the city
into a hub for research and development and
high added value activities. Here, IMADE, the
Madrid Institute for Development, is playing a
leading role; it has already invested 1.1 billion
euros since 2007 in setting up clusters and science
parks with over three hundred companies and
institutions, as part of its goal of seeing Madrid
take its place among the top ten advanced
regions in the world in 2020.
IMADE has also established a specific
cluster for the sustainability and renewable
energy sector in Madrid which is focused on
encouraging innovation, sharing know-how
and accessing financing.
Madrid is the main motor of the Spanish
economy, and will have a major part to play in
its recovery and diversification. The efforts
being made by IMADE and the clusters look
like ensuring that Madrid will consolidate its
role in the forefront of the renewable energy
sector that will be at the heart of Spain’s new
economic model.
The greater economic strength of Madrid,
and the strong commitment of the regional
government to the development of renewable
energy, means that the impact of the crisis in

“The recession has affected neither our priorities nor
the pace of our work.”
Aurelio García de Sola, Manager of IMADE

Madrid is much less than in the rest of the country,
says the cluster’s manager, Rafael Gimeno.
“The recession has affected neither our priorities
nor the pace of our work, we are continuing to
work on the projects”, agrees Aurelio García de
Sola, the manager of IMADE. “The renewable
energy sector has all the ingredients to help to
renew the Spanish economy”.

In recent years, the region of Madrid has
emerged as the epicentre of Spain’s dynamic
renewable energy sector, and it is also now
increasingly recognized as a leading location
for research and development and as a
strategic hub for European and global
business operations.
Nearly 500 companies, employing over
44,000 people, are active in the sector in
Madrid, over half of whom have set up in
the region since 2000. In addition to the
leading Spanish wind energy company,
Iberdrola, standout names in the solar PV
sector who have based themselves in
Madrid include Suntech, Yingli, Sunpower,
Conergy and First Solar, while solar
thermal companies Viessmann, Wagner
Solar, Tisun and Bosch and Schüco are all
present in the region. In the concentrating
solar power sub sector, Madrid is home to
players such as Solfocus, Infinia Solar and
Solar Reserve.
In addition, oil major Repsol has based
its R&D centre for biofuels in Madrid, and
Abengoa, Alfa Laval, and Gea Group all
have significant biofuel operations in the
region, while in the bioenergy area German
multinational RWE Innogy is developing
projects across Spain from its bases in Madrid.
PromoMadrid, the regional government
company that promotes Madrid as a base
for foreign investment and supports the
internationalisation of local companies,
calculates that the renewable industry
contributes over EUR10 billion to the GDP
of the Madrid region. That figure should
rise to over EUR20 billion in 2020,
PromoMadrid estimates. It is not only the
abundant natural resources and attractive
regulatory framework in Spain, or the know-

how that has come with the growth of the
market, that are drawing these companies
to Madrid. Costs are also more competitive
than in other major European regions, while
companies have easy access to a highly
qualified, multilingual labour pool, with
over 64,000 engineering students at the
fourteen universities in Madrid.

Madrid, an innovation hub.

Crucially, the regional government has
also made a concerted effort to support the
development of the sector and attract foreign
investment. The government has established
the Madrid Cluster for Renewable Energy
and Sustainability, which serves as a platform
for the sector that brings together companies,
universities, R&D centres and the regional
administration, so that they can pool interests
and develop specific projects together.
Madrid is particularly focused on
moving up the value chain in the
renewable industry, by encouraging more
investment in research and development in
the region. To this end, in 2008 the
regional government created the Madrid
Institute for Advance Research in Energy
(IMDEA Energy), which is designed to
concentrate resources and talent in the field
of innovation in renewable energy.
Other leading R&D centres in the Madrid
region include the prestigious Solar Energy
Institute (IES), the National Centre for
Research in Technology, Environment and
Energy (CIEMAT), and the National Institute
for Energy Saving and Diversification.
All of these initiatives are serving to
consolidate and increase the level of
research and development in the sector,
and to raise the Madrid region’s stock of
renewable energy know-how, which will
help Madrid to attract more companies to
invest in the sector.
And in addition, because of its strategic
geographical location right at the heart of
the Iberian Peninsula, coupled with state of
the art logistics, such as brand new
Terminal 4 at Barajas airport, Madrid has
also become a popular and attractive base
for companies looking well beyond just the
Spanish market.
Danish wind turbine giant Vestas now
runs all of its sales business for the
Mediterranean, Middle East, North Africa,
Latin America and the Caribbean from its
headquarters in Madrid.
And as well as its geographic position,
which makes it a natural gateway to the
wider European and Mediterranean markets,
Madrid also has unrivalled economic and
cultural connections to Latin America.
“We want also to continue being the
epicentre in Europe of the relationship with
Latin America, which will allow renewable
energy companies based in the Madrid
Region to develop their activities in this new
and very promising market, particularly
when they near grid parity” said Mr Jesús
Sainz, President of PromoMadrid.

Ambitious biofuels targets
New government targets should
help the biofuels market
ollowing the establishment of
mandatory biofuels quotas by the
Spanish government, there has been a surge in
biofuels consumption in Spain, providing the
sector with a platform to be at the forefront of
the development of second generation biofuels.
According to renewable energy association
APPA, Spain is the number three European
producer of bioethanol and the number
seven producer of biodiesel. In July 2007, the
government set mandatory quotas for biofuel
content in gasoline of 3.4% in 2009 and
5.83% in 2010, and according to APPA in
the first half of 2009 the market share of
biofuels had risen to 2.97%, up from a level of
just 1.15% in 2007.
In order to help Spain meet its targets, in
September 2009 Abengoa Bioenergy acquired
the 50% it did not already own in the 200
million liter ethanol plant Biocarburantes
de Castilla y León, in Salamanca. Abengoa
Bioenergy now has combined installed
capacity of over 1.5 billion liters of bioethanol
in the US, Europe and Brazil and is the
leading producer in Europe.
The Salamanca acquisition also positions

biofuels, with the commercialisation of second
generation biofuels, based not on food crops
such as sugar cane and oil seeds but on nonfood materials, which are more competitive
with fossil fuels in terms of cost and which
have a higher energy yield. The Salamanca
complex includes a five million liter pilot plant
for producing bioethanol from cereal straw.
“We want experience in all kinds of raw
materials, so that we can develop them with
new technologies and make more sustainable
products,” says Abengoa Bioenergy CEO
Javier Salgado.

“Only with new technologies can we hope
in the long term to have biofuel products that
are economically competitive,” says Luis
Cabra, a corporate director at Spanish oil giant
Repsol, which each year blends 300,000 tons
of bioethanol derivative ETBE with gasoline in
its refineries. “We need a new generation of
biofuels derived from other raw materials.”
And it is a Spanish company, Bio Fuel
Systems, established in 2006, that says it has
developed one of the keys to the biofuels of
the future and which has caught the attention
of the world’s energy industry. The company
says it can make fuel out of microalgae in the
sea and has established the world’s first
production plant of what it calls biopetroleum,
in Alicante. BFS says its system will be able to
produce 1,400 times more energy than any
other source of biodiesel.
“We are in negotiations with a major oil
company,” says Bio Fuel Systems chairman
Bernard A.J Stroïazzo-Mougin, “and we have
signed an agreement with them on technology
development…in two or three years we plan
to invest two billion euros in constructing
twenty plants. Our target is to achieve in a ten
year period a 10% share of the world market.”

A Case of Sunstroke

Solar Energy

A government crackdown on subsidies has halted
the solar boom. The sector is now looking ahead
to achieving grid parity by cutting costs.

T

he Spanish solar power sector has
enjoyed an unprecedented expansion
in recent years, culminating in 2008, when
solar photovoltaic capacity increased by over
400% to 3,120MW, the highest amount per
capita in the world, and the 50MW Andasol
1 plant, the largest solar thermal power plant
in Europe, was inaugurated in Andalusia.
This surge in photovoltaic and solar
thermal capacity, triggered largely by the very
attractive feed-in tariffs set by the government,
has seen Spain consolidate its position as a
global leader in the solar power industry: 7%
of the world’s production of photovoltaic
generators are now manufactured here.
Acciona 46MW PV plant in Portugal.

Leading the Way
Solaria Energia y Medio Ambiente is one of
the most prominent solar photovoltaic
companies in Spain, and is well known for
its focus on reducing generation costs in
this sector. The relatively young company
has enjoyed rapid growth in Spain, and is
now increasing its international profile, in
Europe and beyond.
Solaria manufactures crystalline silicon cells
and modules, develops turnkey projects, and
also operates solar photovoltaic plants which
are owned by Solaria and by third parties.
The company has a strong commitment
to developing solutions that will reduce the
final production cost of solar photovoltaic
electricity, and it is targeting grid parity for
southern and central Europe, and competitive
system costs in other regions.
Outside of Spain, Solaria already has trade
offices in Germany, Italy and France, and it
has a global pipeline of projects that include
activities in every major region.
In Spain, Solaria is focusing on implementing
a strategy of vertical integration, and it has
recently added state-of-the-art cell manufacturing

lines to its existing module manufacturing
sites. This addition to its business has provided
Solaria with a competitive advantage, by
reducing its dependence on external
suppliers, which means that it can now
better ensure that products are available,
and that it can also improve its quality
control over the entire value chain and
rationalise its end product costs.
In terms of quality control, Solaria uses
manufacturing and testing standards which
are sometimes even more stringent than
the sector’s mandatory quality standard
certifications. In order to meet its extensive
pipeline of projects and committed purchase
orders, Solaria is currently investing in
increasing its production facilities.
The Solaria Research & Development
Centre, located in Puertollano, Spain is now
developing new technologies in partnership
with some of the country’s most prestigious
universities. Some of the areas where Solaria
is working to make the costs of solar energy
competitive with conventional electricity
include the reduction of material costs,
increased scale, and improvement in cell

efficiency and manufacturing techniques.
Thanks to the efforts of companies like Solaria,
solar photovoltaic energy in matured and
regulated markets is becoming more and
more competitive, leading to a reduction of
generation costs, with grid parity set to be
achieved in the next few years. In some
countries, Solaria estimates that this may even
occur as early as 2010, confirming that solar
photovoltaic energy will have a major role to
play in addressing the two global challenges
of climate change and energy security.

A halt in the solar boom
But the fiesta came to a sudden end with the
announcement by the government in
September 2008 that it was cutting the feedin tariffs, and setting a 500MW ceiling on
photovoltaic projects, in a bid to restore a
degree of control over the renewable energy
sector and to reduce spending on subsidies at
a time of pressure on public finances.
“Spain has had runaway growth, the growth
has been so tremendous that it just wasn’t
sustainable,” says Ben Hill, VP of Sales and
Marketing Europe for Chinese photovoltaic

Solaria modules manufacturing plant, Puertollano.

“We have created a structure that focuses
on the optimization of our costs, on the
internationalization of the company, on
entering mature and emerging markets, and
on vertical integration.”
That is the path that successful Spanish
companies in the photovoltaic sector will now
have to pursue, in order to remain competitive,
says José Javier Armendáriz, director general
of CENER, the National Renewable Energy
Center. “I think the sector has to have a
transition to adapt to the new regime, and
develop technologies and processes that serve
to reduce the cost of solar panels.”
Meanwhile, landmark solar thermal
developments are continuing apace. Torresol

Energy, jointly owned by Spanish engineering
group Sener, which designed the Andasol
plant, and by the state of Abu Dhabi, is
constructing the world’s first plant to use
central tower and salt receiver technology.
Construction on the 17MW plant near Seville
started in November 2008, and it should be
operational in 2012.
And there is little doubt that the
development of the new industrial sector of
solar power remains a strategic objective for
the Spanish government.
“The government of Spain has always said
that the development of renewable energy in
Spain reflects an industrial plan, not just an
energy plan,” says Álvaro Llorente, director
general of Torresol Energy. “The state is investing
heavily in the sector for energy reasons and also
to enable industrial development in technology
and components, so that Spain can be a leader
in the market and export this technology.”
“The financial assistance that renewable
energy enjoys now will not last forever and it
will have to fall,” Llorente adds, “but we have
to be able to accompany that fall in tariffs
with more efficient technology…in these
first few years we will have to be patient and
constantly reduce costs.”

module producer Trina Solar. “Spain at the
height of last year represented 30% of our
global sales”. Hill estimates that only
250MW will be installed in Spain this year,
compared to 2,400MW in 2008.
Combined with the financial crisis in Spain,
the sudden collapse of the photovoltaic bubble
and the drop in demand have resulted in tough
times for Spanish manufacturers this year.
But after initial protests, voices from some
of the stronger companies and institutions in
the Spanish solar power sector say that the
clampdown on subsidies may be just what the
sector needed, so that it can now focus on the
two major challenges of internationalization and
achieving competitive costs with conventional
energy, or grid parity.
“Governments will have increasingly fewer
resources for subsidies, and we were certain
that the subsidies that the photovoltaic
industry received would not last forever,” says
Enrique Díaz-Tejeiro, chairman of leading
solar panel manufacturer Solaria.
In response to the crisis, Solaria has started
to make its own solar cells, in order to better
control costs, and to step up expansion overseas.
“The company has changed tremendously
in the last 6 months,” Díaz-Tejeiro says.

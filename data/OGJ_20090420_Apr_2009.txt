INTEQ

Advancing Reservoir Performance

Critical Answers. Delivered While Drilling.
The signs were there. But only Baker Hughes could read them.
Objective:

To achieve what the competition could not— accurately identify tar located directly below
an oil reservoir so injector wells could be optimally placed to stimulate oil production.

Environment:

Manifa Field, Saudi Arabia

Technology:

A combination of INTEQ LWD services: MagTrak™, the industry’s only 4 3/4 -in. magnetic
resonance tool; TesTrak™, real-time formation pressure service that achieved 95%
seal efficiency; and LithoTrak™ density and porosity logging.

Answers:

Baker Hughes delivered answers the client needed for accurate formation evaluation
and optimum wellbore placement. The tar location was confirmed, and Baker Hughes
drilled the injection well more than 30,000 ft (9,144 m), precisely and efficiently.

IEA slashes worldwide oil demand forecast
The International Energy Agency in its April oil market report
revised down by 1 million b/d its outlook for 2009 worldwide oil
demand.
IEA cited a reassessment of global economic assumptions and
much lower-than-expected first quarter demand data as the drivers
of this revision. IEA went on to say it believes that economic and
oil demand recovery will be deferred to 2010. With the expectation that global GDP will contract 1.4% this year, the agency now
forecasts that worldwide oil demand will average 83.4 million b/d,
which is 2.4 million b/d below 2008 demand.
In its previous monthly oil market reports, Paris-based IEA expected that global GDP would grow modestly in 2009 and that oil
demand would recover in the second half of the year.
The bulk of the latest forecast cut for this year’s oil demand is
for the first quarter. IEA revised lower its estimate of first quarter
2009 demand by 700,000 b/d. Demand for middle distillates suffered despite spells of colder northern hemisphere weather, and
industrial activity indicators remain universally weak, IEA said.
Forecast oil demand in countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been adjusted down for
2009 on the basis of much lower economic assumptions. IEA reports that OECD countries are set to face an unusually severe recession, with overall GDP contracting 3.9%.
Consequently, the agency now forecasts 2009 OECD oil demand at 45.2 million b/d, down 2.4 million b/d from last year
and 760,000 b/d lower than previously estimated.
Meanwhile, IEA also cut its forecast for non-OECD oil demand,
as economies in emerging countries are now expected to grow just
1.9% this year. Non-OECD oil demand will average 38.3 million
b/d in 2009, almost 230,000 b/d lower than previously expected.
Although small, this will be the first contraction in non-OECD demand since 1994, IEA said.

EPA cleared to issue climate endangerment ﬁnding
The White House has cleared the way for the US Environmental
Protection Agency to issue an endangerment finding that greenhouse gases pose a danger to public health and welfare.
EPA officials said there is no timetable for when the endangerment finding might be issued. The US Supreme Court on Apr. 2,
2007, ordered EPA to determine whether carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles threaten public health and welfare (OGJ, Apr.
9, 2007, p. 33).
Under the administration of US President Barack H. Obama, the
EPA moved forward on an endangerment announcement. Such an
official announcement would enable the regulation of GHGs under
the Clean Air Act.
EPA submitted its proposed finding in March to the White

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

House Office of Management and Budget as part of the normal
interagency review process.
“OMB has concluded their review, and we will determine what
further action to take,” EPA spokeswoman Adora Andy said in an
Apr. 15 e-mail to OGJ.
The OMB clearance falls short of the White House’s directing
EPA to proceed with the regulatory process.
Meanwhile, a subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee expects next week to discuss proposed energy
and climate legislation entitled the 2009 American Clean Energy
and Security Act.
The Obama administration has suggested it would like to have
Congress deal with climate change regulation through a cap-andtrade system.
Separately, the Center for Biological Diversity filed a petition
with the federal government to protect US waters from ocean
acidification, which results from oceans absorbing CO2. The EPA
on Apr. 15 said it will review whether those emissions should be
regulated under the Clean Water Act.

OCS oil, gas support Louisiana jobs
About 154,000 high-paying manufacturing jobs in Louisiana
depend on access to oil and natural gas on the US Outer Continental Shelf, federal officials were told at the second of four public
hearings on Apr. 8.
Louisiana industries use oil and gas not only as energy but also
as feedstocks for a wide variety of petrochemicals, testified Virginia
Sawyer, vice-president of the Louisiana Association of Business and
Industry, at the US Department of the Interior’s hearing on a draft
proposed 5-year OCS plan in New Orleans.
While Louisiana accounts for 13% of the total energy exported
from oil and gas-producing states, industries use almost 77% of
the gas consumed in the state, she said.
“Almost 58% of petroleum produced in Louisiana is consumed
by the state’s industrial sector, which employs 154,000 Louisianans, who have an average annual wage of $52,000. This average
manufacturing wage is 40% higher than Louisiana’s statewide average wage,” said Sawyer, who also testified on behalf of the National
Association of Manufacturers.
The potential for generating electricity from renewable and alternative sources does not mean federal policy should focus on it
at the expense of oil and gas, she continued.
“While tens of thousands of jobs may be created by the development of alternative energy sources, hundreds of thousands of
jobs in Louisiana and along the Gulf Coast will be negatively affected if OCS oil and gas production is not aggressively continued.
Orderly development of energy should be as fuel-neutral as possible,” Sawyer said. ✦

Petrobras, Repsol YPF claim Piracuca ﬁnd ‘viable’
Brazil’s Petroleo Brasilerio SA (Petrobras) and partner Repsol
YPF SA said a light oil and natural gas find in Piracuca field off
Brazil is commercially viable.
The partners said the find was made in reservoirs in the presalt
layer on Block BM-S-7 in the Santos basin.
The companies presented a declaration of commercial viability
to Brazil’s energy regulatory agency, ANP, based on the “intense
exploratory activity” the companies have carried out on the block,
Petrobras said.
“With the new field, it will be possible to increase the potential
for light oil and gas production in shallow waters,” Petrobras said.
Earlier, the Brazilian firm estimated that the field contained nearly
550 million boe.
Petrobras and Repsol YPF originally announced their discovery
in January, saying that the find was made in214 m of water and a
total depth of 3,970 m, above the region’s subsalt layer.
“This discovery is of great importance because of the potential
production of gas in shallow waters in the southern Santos basin,”
said Petrobras, operator of the block with a 63% stake. Repsol YPF
holds the remaining 37%.

StatoilHydro acquires interest in DeSoto Canyon
BHP Billiton has granted a 40% interest to StatoilHydro in 50
frontier blocks in the DeSoto Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico.
The DeSoto Canyon area lies east of Independence Hub in 1,000
m of water. StatoilHydro hopes to secure early access to new plays.
StatoilHydro conducted a similar early-access deal with ExxonMobil Corp. in 2005 in the Walker Ridge area of the gulf, according

Ziff Energy Group forecasts unconventional gas production will
supply 53% of US gas needs by 2020, up from 30% in 2000.
Ziff Energy’s Shale Gas Outlook to 2020 says shale gas production in 2008 was more than 5 bcfd (8% of North American gas
production), with 70% coming from the Barnett shale in the Fort
Worth basin of Texas.
In the future, the report sees increased gas coming from the
Barnett, Fayetteville, and Woodford shales as well as many other
plays such as the Haynesville, Marcellus, Horn River, Utica, and
Gothic.
The report expects in 2020 that North America will produce 87
bcfd compared with 70 bcfd in 2000.

Dana Gas starts output from Egyptian discoveries
Dana Gas, Sharjah, announced earlier this month it had started
production from its recent Al Basant gas-condensate discovery on
the West Manzala concession in Egypt’s Nile Delta.
The company also began producing from its El Wastani East-2
sidetrack well, Dana Gas Egypt’s first highly deviated, horizontal
well in Egypt.

to Tony Dore, StatoilHydro vice-president of exploration for North
America.
StatoilHydro and BHP Billiton bid successfully on 14 additional
blocks within this same trend at the Central Gulf Lease Sale 208
held in New Orleans last month (OGJ Online, Mar. 18, 2009). Together, the two companies were the apparent high bidder on all
blocks.
The partners are awaiting final approval from the US Minerals
Management Service for the leases on those blocks.

Israel’s Dalit discovery given 500 bcf
A group led by Noble Energy Inc., Houston, reported a flow
of 33 MMcfd of natural gas from its Dalit deepwater discovery in
the Mediterranean off Israel and said the well appears capable of
achieving 200 MMcfd.
Noble estimated Dalit’s gross mean resource at 500 bcf of gas
from log and test results. The well is on the Michal license.
The 33-MMcfd flow, limited by test equipment capacity, came
from 43 ft of the previously reported 110 ft of identified net pay.
Noble said the well improves confidence in its geological model
for the region, and that it will begin shooting 3D seismic in the
next few months to supplement that understanding of the basin
and various leads on its acreage.
The rig will return to the Tamar discovery on the Matan license
to drill an appraisal well. Tamar’s estimated gross mean resource
potential is 5 tcf (OGJ Online, Feb. 10, 2009).
Noble operates both licenses and holds 36% working interest.
Other interest owners are Isramco Negev 2 with 28.75%, Delek
Drilling 15.625%, Avner Oil Exploration 15.625%, and Dor Gas
Exploration 4%. ✦

Dana drilled the Al Basant-1 well in October 2008 and tested
it at 23.5 MMscfd and 1,027 b/d of condensate. The Al Basant-2
appraisal well was subsequently drilled, completed, and tested in
December 2008. It yielded additional gas in a new zone that tested
at 10.5 MMscfd gas and 150 b/d of condensate.
A third well in the field is to reach estimated target production
of 45 MMscfd before yearend. Dana said that Al Basant field gas
reserves are estimated to exceed 123 bcf.
The Al Basant discovery was developed on fast track, said the
company, with two 17-km pipelines, one 6 in. OD and 12 in.,
to transport Al Basant production to the El Wastani integrated gas
plant.
The plant has design capacity of 160 MMscfd and 7,500 b/d of
condensate and LPG, but is currently operating at 153 MMscfd gas
and 5,400 b/d.
Dana said the new gas production from Al Basant will “allow
testing the plant beyond its full design capacity and identifying
components that require modification, or upgrading.” It will also
maximize throughput, while targeting production levels of 170
MMscfd.
The company said the El Wastani East-2 sidetrack well was

drilled and completed in March in the East El Wastani development
lease in the Nile Delta region. Gas production from EWE-2 started
on Mar. 30, said the company, initially at 4.5 MMscfd gas, which
will increase “after the well has been cleaned up.” EWE-2 production is being processed in the company’s El Wastani plant.
Ahmed Al-Arbeed, Dana Gas upstream executive director, said
the company will continue its efforts to develop and produce the
remaining three discoveries: Salma, Azhar, and Sondos (Haggag)
in 2009-10.
In its announcement, the company claimed it is the Middle East’s
“first and largest regional private sector natural gas company.”

RAK buys Heritage’s interest in West Bukha
RAK Petroleum PCL has purchased a 10% interest in Block 8 in
the Strait of Hormuz off Oman from a subsidiary of Heritage Oil
Ltd. of the UK, bringing RAK’s interest to 50%.
RAK operates Block 8, where it brought West Bukha field on
production in February 2009 at 10,000 b/d of 42° gravity oil and
30 MMcfd of associated gas from two wells. The wells are on a
six-slot, unmanned platform in 90 m of water 25 km off the Musandam Peninsula.

Processing

Discovered in 1976, West Bukha was believed to be a gas-condensate field and was abandoned as noncommercial.
Appraisal drilling by RAK Petroleum in 2006-08, including
an extended horizontal section, demonstrated oil potential in the
Mishriff-Maudud and Thamama reservoirs, said Bijan MossavarRahmani, RAK Petroleum managing director and chairman of the
executive committee.
A 12-in. multiphase flow line connects West Bukha to the nearby Bukha field production platform. Bukha field, also on Block 8,
was developed in 1994 and can flow 10-15 MMcfd of nonassociated gas.
Output from both fields moves through a 16-in., 33-km multiphase flow line to shore for processing at the Khor Khwair plant in
Ras Al Khaimah. Oil and condensate are slated for export, while gas
is delivered to industrial and commercial users in Ras Al Khaimah.
LG International Corp., Seoul, holds the other 50% interest in
Block 8.
RAK Petroleum, registered in Ras Al Khaiman’s free trade zone,
operates nine blocks in Oman and the UAE, of which six are in the
exploration phase and two are undergoing appraisal for possible
redevelopment. ✦

Holly to buy, upgrade reﬁnery in Tulsa

Faisal Al Suwaidi, chief executive officer of Qatargas Operating
Co. Ltd. (Qatargas), told OGJ that the refinery is 99% complete.
“We still have a few things to do,” he said. “Commissioning activities have already started. It is the largest single condensate refinery
in the world.” Products will be used internally and exported.
The project has cost $800 million, instead of the $668.7 million originally expected in 2005, and was expected to start by the
third quarter of 2008. The delay occurred because of a shortage
of skilled labor and materials following the construction boom of
the industry over the last 3-4 years. The capacity of the condensate
refinery will be doubled by 2014.
Qatargas and its partners, including ExxonMobil Corp. and Total
SA, have built process units including utility systems, distillation
units, naphtha and kerosine hydrotreaters, a hydrogen unit, and a
saturated gas plant producing hydrotreated naphtha, hydrotreated
kerosine, gas oil, and LPG for export.
A consortium of GS Engineering & Construction Corp. and Daewoo Engineering & Construction Co. hold the engineering, procurement, and construction contract. Technip SA handled frontend engineering and design.
Qatargas will operate the refinery and provide feedstock for it
along with RasGas, a joint venture between Qatar Petroleum and
ExxonMobil, and Al-Khaleej Gas.

Holly Refining & Marketing has agreed to buy and plans to add
diesel desulfurization capacity at Sunoco’s 85,000-b/cd refinery
in Tulsa.
The companies have signed a definitive agreement with a purchase price of $65 million. Closing of the deal is set for June 1.
Sunoco had announced last November that it was canceling plans
to upgrade the refinery and that it would seek a buyer or operate the
facility as a terminal. According to Oil & Gas Journal’s 2008 Worldwide Refining Report, the refinery has 8,500 b/cd of delayed coking
capacity, 17,500 b/cd of catalytic reforming capacity, and 24,000 b/
cd of catalytic hydrotreating capacity for reformer feeds.
In addition to fuels, the refinery produces 8,500 b/cd of lubes
and 350 tons/day of coke. It yields about 40% diesel and jet fuel.
Holly Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Matt Clifton
said the buyer will install a diesel desulfurization unit by 2011 at
an expected cost of $150 million.
Holly operates the 85,000-b/cd Navajo refinery in Artesia, NM,
and a 26,400-b/cd refinery in Woods Cross, Utah.
Sunoco’s other refinery locations and capacities are Philadelphia, 330,000 b/cd; Marcus Hook, Pa., 175,000 b/cd; Eagle Point,
NJ, 150,000 b/cd; and Toledo, Ohio, 140,000 b/cd.

Excluding science
Your Newsletter section contained an
ironic statement by Rep. Edward Markey
(D-Mass.): “Instead of allowing political
interference in scientific…decisions…
the Obama administration is letting the
sun shine in on the dangerous realities
of global warming (OGJ, Apr. 6, 2009,
Newsletter).”
The truth of course is exactly the opposite. Science is now excluded from the
decision process. First, note that Markey
is a lawyer and presumably a little weak
on the meaning of science. The earth
may have warmed a bit over the last 100
years, but government action is only
rational if such warming could be tied
to human activity.
I have heard that there is strong disagreement about whether such causality
exists. So where is the science? Sounds
like another spotted owl hoax.

Oil opportunity in Oklahoma
Alan Petzet
Chief EditorExploration
The chance to recover billions of
barrels of oil that remain in Oklahoma
fields represents geological, engineering, and statistical challenges to oilmen
willing to take risks.
Most emphasis in the state the
past 20 years has been on natural gas,
especially in shales, but the oil is still
there, somewhere, writes Dan T. Boyd, a
geologist with the Oklahoma Geological Survey.
The prize: Boyd estimates the state’s
thousands of oil fields will ultimately
yield only 19% of the more than 84
billion bbl of original oil in place at
present decline rates.
“Every 1% of the remaining oil in
place represents a staggering 680 million bbl of incremental recovery,” Boyd
wrote. Indications are that a lot of the
oil is in reservoirs from which recovery
factors can be increased.
Boyd describes the potential in the
February issue of the quarterly publication of the Society of Independent
Professional Earth Scientists, based in
Dallas.
A new effort called Energy Libraries
Online could help by improving access
to previously scattered, inaccessible, and
incomplete well and production data
(OGJ, Feb. 23, 2009, p. 34).

1960s when Tulsa newspapers still had
oil departments and this editor broke
into oil journalism. Tulsa was also Oil &
Gas Journal headquarters for most of its
existence until the 1990s.
Oklahoma got its last 100 million
bbl oil field, Postle in the Panhandle, in
1958 and its last 10 million bbl field,
Wheatland just west of Oklahoma City,
in 1981, when this editor joined OGJ.
Most of the state’s oil wells average
2 b/d, oil drilling is down to 1,000
wells/year, and without large discoveries “future reserve additions must come
from improvements to the recovery in
existing fields,” Boyd wrote.
Oil drilling is sparse despite recent
high oil prices. Economics of gas are
better, and operators are concerned
whether prices will be sufficient to
recoup large initial investments and
whether enough producible oil remains
to justify large-scale improved recovery.

ery work done so far has been piecemeal,” Boyd found. Except in the largest
fields, many waterflood units have been
subdivided and are operated in isolation
or at cross purposes, and units operated
since 1979 cover less than half of the
state’s currently producing oil leases.

Modern examples

Boyd cited instances in which
operators have improved recoveries by
innovative means.
In West Carney field in Lincoln
County, a dewatering technique elevated
a Hunton carbonate shelf reservoir with
cumulative production of 38,000 bbl
and 500 MMcf to one with reserves of
2.2 million bbl and 16 bcf.
Dewatering involved pumping and
disposing of water at rates sufficient
to “reduce the reservoir pressure until
the associated gas in the unproduced
oil expands.” Boyd wrote, “This oil can
then be pushed into the fracture system
The oil is there
and ultimately the wellbore.”

More ethanol distortion
In the competition of ideas that is so vital to
democracy, studies by supposed experts, preferably disinterested, figure prominently. So does the
selective use of facts from these studies by groups
less disinterested.
As the US systematically suppresses market influence in energy choice, deception born of selectivity increasingly distorts policy discussions. This
is because suppliers of energy unable to compete
in markets must compete instead in the political
arena for tax favors and mandates. Without rival
in this practice is the politically triumphant but
economically beleaguered ethanol industry.

2008, “certain other factors—for example, higher
energy costs—had a greater effect on food prices
than did the use of ethanol as a motor fuel.” This
finding, RFA argues, shows that “ethanol’s role in
food price increases is minimal.”
How minimal? “The CBO report finds that
ethanol contributed just ‘0.5 and 0.8 percentage
points of the 5.1% increase in food prices’ from
April 2007 to April 2008,” RFA says. That certainly
sounds minimal.
But the quote lifted by RFA had more context

CBO said, “the increasing demand for corn to produce ethanol contributed, in CBO’s estimation, beFood and fuel

Since 2004, private Russian oil and
gas companies’ exploration expenses,
in nominal terms, increased 4.4 times,
reaching 165 billion rubles in 2008
($6.7 billion; Fig. 1). Despite this major
inflation of costs—more than 30%
in 2008—actual work accomplished
remained almost flat. This is explained
partly by the rapid decline in the price
of crude oil and the expansion of
the global financial crisis.
However, the major reasons
for decreasing exploration
attractiveness are an unfavorable fiscal system and the
absence of stimulus for the
regions to finance exploration activities.
The Russian Federation’s Ministry
of Natural Resources and Environment
(MNR&E) is paying close attention to
these conditions and is developing and
implementing economic instruments to
stimulate activities in the industry.
Among the ministry’s major responsibilities, it ensures rational subsoil use,

This article is the second of two parts addressing
the challenges facing Russia’s oil and gas industry.
In Part 1, executives from Rosneft, Lukoil, and
Gazprom Neft outlined the excessive taxes and
duties that eat into operating expenses and obviate
exploration efforts (OGJ, Mar. 9, 2009, p. 27).
This article explains the actions the government is
taking to address those problems and to encourage
exploration and production.

allocates mineral rights, classifies new
oil and gas reserves, conducts geological studies, and provides oversight for
exploration efforts and oil and gas
production.
Since 2005 the ministry has revised
and approved a long-term program of
geological study and mineral resourcebase restoration to 2020. According to
the program, during 2005-20, Russian
exploration expenditures should reach
about 4.5 trillion rubles (more than
$180 billion), from which oil and gas
would account for 88%.
The ministry believes that about 90%
of total expenditures should be private,
and it is keen to stimulate these companies’ exploration activity. To stimulate
exploration, MNR&E proposes several
actions:
• It proposes introduction of tax
credits or deductions for exploration
expenses against the mineral extraction
tax (MET).
• It proposes to allow regions to collect a share of auction revenues for areas
explored at their own expense.
The first measure, a direct stimulus
for private investments, is new for Russian tax legislation and may sufficiently
increase exploration attractiveness. The
other, in addition to generating higher
spending, may improve exploration efficiency as knowledge of local geology
may be better at the regional level.
Amendments to the Subsoil Law in
2008 define “strategic oil fields” as oil
fields containing reserves of more than
70 million tonnes and strategic gas
fields as having reserves above 50 billion cu m or that are located offshore.
If foreign investors discover strategic
reserves and the Russian government
decides to withdraw the license, the investor will get full cost recovery (bonus
and exploration expenditures) plus a
reward.
Foreign investors may further participate in the development of strategic
fields through joint ventures as minority stakeholders while operatorship is
granted to state-controlled companies.
From the ministry’s prospective, clear
rules and fair rewards should compenOil & Gas Journal / Apr. 20, 2009

classification should be implemented in
2012. The idea is to harmonize the existing system inherited from the Soviet
era with internationally accepted standards. The major reason for modifying
the current classification is to introduce
economic principles into the methodology of recoverable reserves calculation.
Since the beginning of the work
on new classification, one of the most
popular questions was whether Russia
should modify its existing system or
just switch to some widespread standard such as is used by the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) or
the Society of Professional Engineers’
Petroleum Resources Management
System (SPE PRMS). While very tempting, the latter seems inappropriate for
Russia, mainly because of the difference in its purpose. Classifications for
financial markets (e.g., that used by
SEC) is designed to improve the quality
of financial reporting, help raise capital,
and create fair market value. International classifications such as SPE PRMS
are used by oil companies for investment planning, portfolio management,
development plans, raising capital, and
in mergers and acquisition activity.
Governmental classification should
serve the following, somewhat different
purposes:
• Accounting for the country’s reserves balance.
• Managing an efficient resource
base.
• Controlling and stimulating rational subsoil usage.
• Developing oil and gas industry
infrastructure.
• Improving subsoil and tax legislation.
• Promoting market capitalization
growth of domestic companies.
Although hundreds of different
classifications exist simultaneously in
the world, the general trend is a global
unification. Thus SEC will adopt most

taxation became essentially revenuebased. Export duties and MET account
for about 95% of total tax payments

exceeding 68% of gross revenue. The

structure and true project economics.
Another challenging task is stimulating enhanced oil recovery techniques
through deduction of investments in
improved oil recovery against MET.
Such an instrument may be implemented only if companies prove the efficiency of their applied methods. MET
redemption for production of idle wells
may be used if separate metering exists
for those wells.

Flaring solutions
Gas flaring is a well-known problem
for Russia. According to official estimates, annual flaring exceeds 17 billion
cu m/year, but this number is not very
accurate due to poor associated gas
production measurement. For example,
fewer than 50% of flares are equipped
with flowmeters.
To decrease emissions and use the
components of gas that otherwise
would be flared, the Russian government established a goal of achieving a

95% utilization level for associated gas
by 2012 (Fig. 4). To stimulate investments in gas utilization programs, the
government will impose penalties on
emissions caused by flaring volumes
exceeding the limit after 2012. Higher
rates will be levied if direct measurement systems are absent.
However, this may not work for
small oil fields due to the high cost of
implementation and resulting poor
economics. To solve that particular
problem, it is suggested that several
companies pool utilization programs on
a regional basis.
All additional economic instruments
proposed for fine-tuning the current tax
system impose strict requirements on
tax administration, metering, control,
and financial transparency. The efficiency of their implementation will
depend strongly on the trustworthiness
between business and government.
That’s why MNR&E works closely with
oil companies while creating a favorable

environment for exploration, development, and production in a rational and
mutually beneficial manner. ✦

Learning from the past

The encouraging news from the
summit was the broad consensus—
among both national and international
oil companies, major service and construction companies, and international
energy organizations—that the mistakes made during past crises should
not be repeated this time: short-term
uncertainties must be managed while
pursuing the development of long-term
potential.
This reference to the past was
made at the start of proceedings in the
introductory statement of Nordine AitLaoussine, president of Geneva-based
Nalcosa. He said that “when the idea of

Maintaining investments
The two keynote speakers, Total’s
Chief Executive Officer Christophe de
Margerie and Royal Dutch Shell’s Chief
Executive Jeroen van de Veer set an upbeat tone as they indicated they would
maintain their investments in 2009.
“Last year’s profits,” said De Margerie, “are helping us maintain business
in a low-priced environment.” At the
same time, he echoed the general feeling of summit participants that “the
long-term view is easy; more difficult
is the short-term view.” He said, “The
long-term view is good, the short-term
not so good.” While Total’s strategy and
its long-term vision have not changed,
it is adjusting to short-term constraints

by keeping a strict hold on costs.
Van de Veer expects short-term oil
overcapacity until the economy picks
up, “and then energy demand will
come back,” he said, predicting that
“long-term energy demand will double
between now and 2060 because of
population growth.” Classic oil and gas
will not supply all the energy demand,
he said, so coal and renewables will also
be needed. But renewables will have to
be geared to lower costs with no subsidies, he added.
Most of Shell’s investments, however,
will remain in oil and gas, Van de Veer
said, adding that the group has abandoned none of its long-term projects
and is preparing to bid for Arctic oil
and gas resources when the time comes.
International oil companies, national
oil companies, and service companies
are complementary, he concluded:
“NOCs own the land, IOCs design and
build the house, service companies’
role is [installing] the scaffolding and
plumbing. Moral: you need one another,” said Van de Veer.
While Repsol YPF SA Chief Operating Officer Mighel Martinez wondered
how long it would take the economy
to adjust supply to demand, he said the
current situation allows his group to
renegotiate some contracts and to continue with its investment commitments,
despite a capex reduction to €29 billion
from €33 billion.

Saudi Arabia building
Joining forces with the IOCs, Saudi
Arabia also is “taking a longer-term
view of oil market trends and is staying
the course when it comes to its program and investments,” said Ibrahim A.
Al-Muhanna, advisor to Saudi Arabia’s
Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral
Resources.
Saying oil demand will rise as soon
as the economic crisis abates, perhaps
later this year, he said if global production capacity is unable to meet demand
at that time because of underinvestment, “Saudi Arabia is capable and willing” to meet any demand growth.

The conventional wisdom that heavy
commodities trading causes volatile
prices is driven more by intuition than
facts or systematic analysis, according to
Robert J. Weiner, an international business professor at George Washington
University. “Over a time period where
trading increased significantly, aggregate
statistics did not show a corresponding
increase in volatility,” he said.
Weiner said traders adopting a herd
mentality, where they made decisions
by copying other market participants
instead of examining fundamental
influences, is a likelier force. “If lots
of people try to get into or out of a
position at the same time, volatility can
result,” he said.
Investigations have not found evidence of parallel trading among commercial market participants or financial
speculators, although there were some
apparent cases of what Weiner termed
“flocking.”
He said that scarcity of data and lack
of market transparency serve traders
and the public poorly. “We need to examine fundamentals to understand why
oil markets change,” he said. ✦

Tax proposals
still lurk

T

he oil and gas tax increases that
were part of the Obama administration’s fiscal 2010 budget request
did not make it into either the US
Senate or House’s broad reconciliation proposals in early April. That
doesn’t mean that they won’t be
considered.
Industry observers told me the
taxes and fees could show up in other
legislation, possibly the energy bill
being developed by the Senate Energy
and Natural Resources Committee.
The proposals would exclude
refiners from a tax credit other domestic manufacturers use to compete
against overseas firms that receive
subsidies from their governments.
“US refiners are closely connected
to the world oil market,” said Lou
Pugliaresi, president of Energy Policy
Research Foundation Inc. “Removing
this tax credit would simply move
more refining out of the country.”
Independent producers have been
among the most active groups against
the proposals. “It will be Issue No. 1
for us when we come back there on
Apr. 20,” said Rock Zierman, president of the California Independent
Petroleum Association.

Shares goal, but…
“We share the president’s goal of
wanting to wean the United States
off foreign oil, but you can’t do it by
killing domestic production. That’s
what his tax proposals would do,”
Zierman continued.

more natural gas will be needed to
achieve clean energy goals which

White House have set, according to
Jon Bargas, public affairs director
for IPAMS. “We were encouraged by
most of our meetings. We tried to
concentrate on members who would
understand the adverse impacts these
proposed tax increases would have,
particularly on small, independent
producers,” he told me.

Freshman Democrats
IPAMS members, during their
Washington callup, visited members of Congress from the Rocky
Mountains and freshman Democrats
from previously Republican districts,
Bargas said. “A lot of them hadn’t
realized how harmful and extensive
these tax increases would be to small
independent producers or how much
of our national gas comes from the
Intermountain West,” he said.
The upstream independents from
the Rockies also explained that
they’re feeling the economic recession too, and that their industry is
responsible for about 150,000 jobs
in the region.
“With low commodity prices
and shortage of capital—and our
industry’s high reinvestment rate—it
made our message clear that increasing taxes could hurt our industry
and make it more difficult for us to
help achieve reduced greenhouse gas
emissions and other environmental
goals,” Bargas said.
“We face a struggle based on the
economic cycle and the reality of
energy prices today,” said Zierman.
“The number of active drilling rigs
across the country has fallen by half
the past few months. Throwing in
more taxes now would be a serious
mistake.” ✦

Ranking minority members of two
US House committees expressed concern Apr. 7 that the US Department of
Interior is limiting public comments as
it considers a comprehensive 5-year US
Outer Continental Shelf leasing plan.
“The system currently in place fails
to meet a simple standard of inclusion to promote and facilitate an open
exchange of public opinion,” said Doc
Hastings (R-Wash.) of the Natural
Resources Committee and Darrell E. Issa
(R-Calif.) of the Oversight and Investigations Committee, in a letter to US
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar.
Persons wishing to submit comments must either mail or hand-deliver
them to DOI headquarters in Washington, or “attempt to navigate the
sprawling online database known as
Regulations.gov, where users must first
successfully input ‘docket IDs,’ ‘legacy
numbers,’ and an ‘RIN’ before they have
any chance of advancing to the main
comment submission page,’” the two
House members said.
They called the new policy “an
unconstructive change” from the previous system. “The department’s public
comment process was especially userfriendly under the Bush administration,
enabling Americans to easily submit
their comments through a simple email address. The department should
immediately reinstate the user-friendly
e-mail public comment system,” they
said.

Japan wising
up to Russia

T

he oil and gas industry has read
much recently about the difficulties of dealing with Russia. But now,
it seems, someone has finally gotten
Moscow’s number.
That view emerged last week with
reports that the Russian government would be seeking financial and
technological assistance from Japan
to build a pipeline and LNG export
terminal for its Sakhalin-1 project.
An official at Japan’s ministry of
foreign affairs confirmed that Russia is seeking help in constructing a
pipeline from Sakhalin to Vladivostok,
site of a future LNG export terminal.
Total costs for construction of
the pipeline and export terminal are
estimated at 500 billion yen, and
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin is expected to propose launching
full-scale talks for assistance when he
visits Japan in May.

Sakhalin-2’s output is likely to be
shipped to Japan, supplying some 8%
of the nation’s needs.
Another 8% from Sakhlain-1
would be tempting.
At the moment, however, Russia
plans to purchase all the gas produced from the Sakhalin 1 project, in
which Japanese trading house Itochu
Corp. and US oil major Exxon Mobil
Corp. own stakes, and export it to
Japan and elsewhere.

Japanese wary

That could be tempting to Japan,
except for that tiny reference to “elsewhere.” Where could that be? Well, as
you might imagine, the most likely

rival and current chief competitor for

launch of a joint venture for oil transport, and construction of a Venezuelan
refinery in China.
“Those three top strategic objectives already justify the working visit to
China, but we have other political and
geo-political interests to discuss with
President Hu Jintao,” Chavez said after
arriving in Beijing.
According to Chavez, the goal of
shipping 1 million b/d to China is
reachable because his country plans to
divert much of the current 1.5 million
b/d it sends to the US.
“We’re diversifying our oil business,” Chavez said. “Even though we’re
a small country, we’re an oil giant and
China doesn’t have the reserves necessary to meet its needs,” he said, adding
that “God put the oil that China needs
for the next 200 years in Venezuela.”
During the visit, Venezuela’s Energy
and Mines Minister Rafael Ramirez,
along with top executives of stateowned Petroleos de Venezuela SA, met
with leaders of Chinese state-owned
China National Petroleum Corp. and
Sinopec to discuss current and future
cooperation.
Venezuelan officials said the talks
also took up the idea of a joint refinery
project on Chinese territory capable of
processing Venezuelan heavy crude into
fuel and other products.
Following the Venezuelan leader’s
visit, CNPC Pres. Jiang Jiemin said the
state firm would submit a plan to set
up joint venture refinery with PDVSA
in Guangdong province. Jiang said the
refinery, which will process 20 million
tonnes/year of oil, will be owned 51%
by CNPC and 49% by PDVSA.
The talks between the two leaders
largely reiterated discussions the two
sides have been having for some time
on the ways they can cooperate on a
variety of oil developments.
In September 2008, Venezuela and
China signed several accords, including
one agreement for a joint study with
Sinopec for construction of a refinery in
Cabruta, northern Venezuela, to process
heavy crude from the Orinoco heavy oil
belt.

Morales Gil said Pemex is working
on a “model contract” to govern Chicontepec development.
Meanwhile, Morales Gil said the current production schedule for Chicontepec calls for the conventional drilling
of more than 17,000 wells in 29 fields
with the eventual goal of producing
around 100 b/d oil from each one of
them. ✦

Western Siberia’s supergiant Samotlor field should continue to produce
until the year 2099, said the TNK-BP
Russian amalgam, which plans to invest
$1 billion/year through 2011 to sustain
it.
Samotlor, discovered in 1965, on
marshlands and taiga in the KhantyMansi Autonomous area just north of
Nizhnevartovsk in the Tyumen region,
has produced
19.2 billion
bbl of oil since
development
began in 1969,
TNK-BP said.
The latest
study found
remaining recoverable volumes of more
than 7 billion bbl of oil and 3.53 tcf of
gas. Samotlor is one of the world’s five
largest oil fields, TNK-BP said.
Apr. 3, the 40th anniversary of
Samotlor’s commercial development,
found the field producing 582,750 b/d.
TNK-BP said its efforts should maintain
production at or slightly above this level
at least until 2012 even though decline
rates are accelerating in the field’s most
mature parts.
Production peaked in 1980 at nearly

3.2 million b/d, almost half of Russia’s
output, and had fallen to 400,000 b/d
by 1999. Samotlor has 13,400 oil wells
and 4,500 injection wells.
Under a development plan approved
in 2005 by Rosnedra, Russia’s agency
for subsoil use, the existing well stock
and certain specific exploration and
technological activities will account
for just over 70% of production in
the next 90 years. The rest will come
from access to new reserves in field
extensions and application of advanced
technologies.
Samotlorneftegaz and TNK-Nizhnevartovsk, incorporated into TNKBP, took over operation of the field
in 2003. TNK-BP’s license runs until
2038.
Since 2003, it has reactivated more
than 1,250 idle wells, pumped hydrofracs at workovers, run electric submersible pumps, and drilled sidetracks.
It is near completion of 4,000 sq km
of 3D seismic from which it has identified numerous satellite structures, five
of which are under development with
extended reach drilling. One satellite,
Ust-Vakh, has yielded more than 46.5

Petrobras, Repsol YPF make large
oil discovery in Brazil’s Santos basin
Brazil’s state-run Petroleo Brasileiro
SA and partner Repsol YPF SA filed a
declaration of commercial viability
with the country’s Agencia Nacional do
Petroleo (ANP) for a light oil and gas
discovery made on Block BM-S-7 in the
Santos basin.
Piracuca field lies in 200 m of water
off Sao Paulo state, 200 km southeast of
Santos. The partners, Petrobras 63% and
Repsol YPF 37%, estimate recoverable
volumes at 88.5 million cu m or “about
550 million boe.”
The declaration of commercial
viability is the outcome of “intense
exploratory activity” carried out on this
block, the partners said, adding, “With
the new field, it will be possible to increase the potential for light oil and gas
production in shallow waters.”
The announcement coincided with
reports that Petrobras notified ANP on
Apr. 6 that it found traces of oil in a
test well drilled on the CM-401 Block
offshore in the Campos basin. Petrobras
holds a 100% stake in the block.

Petrobras reported that data from
early March showed that the Peregrine
1 drillship was drilling at the site in
977 m of water and targeting a depth
of 3,333 m.
Meanwhile, ANP said ExxonMobil
Brazilian subsidiary Esso Santos is drilling a second well on Brazil’s Santos basin Block BM-S-22 to a depth of 5,404
m in 24 m of water.
ExxonMobil Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Rex Tillerson said the
second well is designed in part to give
ExxonMobil a “better understanding”
of BM-S-22, but he declined to confirm
what the firm expects to discover.
While the block is close to major
finds in Santos’s presalt layer, Tillerson
played down projections of discoveries
at BM-S-22, saying, “We have one well,”
and “it’s just too early” to predict what
will be found on it.
ExxonMobil is operator of the block
with a 40% stake. Hess Corp. also holds
a 40% interest, while Petrobras owns
the remaining 20%. ✦

Firm plans work on four blocks in Ecuador
Ecuador’s state-owned Petroamazonas, a subsidiary of national oil company Petroecuador that operates oil
assets previously owned by Occidental
Petroleum Corp., expects to develop oil
fields on four oil blocks this year.
Reiterating plans announced in February, Petroamazonas General Manager
Wilson Pastor said his firm would aim
at drilling 14 wells in Panacocha field,
with initial production set at 5,000
b/d from the second quarter of 2010,
eventually rising to 25,000 b/d.
Pastor said 13 wells would be drilled
in Panayacu-Quinde field, with output
potential of 10,000 b/d. Four wells will
be drilled in Paka Sur field, with initial
output of 3,000 b/d possibly online by

see the drilling of 14 wells with output
scheduled to start in January 2011. Peak
production will reach 33,400 b/d.

Budget cut
Prior to Correa’s statement, Ecuador’s
El Universal newspaper reported that
Petroecuador’s budget for 2009 had
been ratified at $3.002 billion, a drop
of 38% from 2008. It said that Petroamazonas’s share would be $967.8 million
and that its developmental priorities
would include Panacocha and Block 31.
In January, Petroamazonas announced plans to produce an average of
100,600 b/d in 2009, compared with
95,000 b/d in 2008.
Petroamazonas said the production
would come from Block 15: 60,400
b/d from Eden-Yuturi field and 40,200
b/d from Indillana.
To output targets under budgetary
constraints, Pastor told Ecuador’s El Comercio newspaper in February, Petroamazonas would seek alliances to secure
investments.
He said the company needed to
invest $509 million in order to meet
its output target for 2009, although
the government budgeted only $359
million.
Pastor said the outstanding $150
million would be financed through association contracts which would be put
out to tender.
For Block 31, formerly operated
by Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Pastor said
Petroamazonas would consider a joint
venture partnership to help with the
planned $300 million of needed investment for development.

yearend 2009.
Petroamazonas also hopes to develop
Block 31, where it wants to drill 14
wells, but financing remains a problem.
Pastor said the firm wants to start work
on Block 31 this year.
Pastor was reiterating plans that had
been announced in February following
a meeting between Petroamazonas and
Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa.
At the time, Correa’s office issued a
statement saying Petroamazonas would

Several fields in Russia
have installed a downhole cable that heats high
viscosity and high-paraffin crude, according to
Nefteservis-NN LLC.
Production
Nefteservis-NN developed and sells the cable
and associated equipment. Development
of the well heating unit, called Fontan,
started 5 years ago.

Beneﬁts
Nefteservis-NN says the cable heats
fluid flowing in the tubing to a temperature exceeding the wax dropout point.
Some benefits of the system include:
• Ensures walls inside the wellbore,
x-mas tree, and adjacent flowlines remain clean at all times.
• Prevents hydrate, asphaltine, and
paraffin buildup.
• Increases well production rate,
especially for high-viscosity crude oil.
• Improves electric submersible
pump (ESP) performance and service
life, because of a lower fluid viscosity.
• Reduces well downtime by increasing time between well repairs.

O D U C T I O N

• Eliminates the use of other paraffin
removal methods.
• Liquefies hydrate accumulations in
gas wells.
• Heats water wells located in permafrost regions.
• Heats pipelines.
The company says operators can
adjust the unit for the best temperature
and power-saving operations, as well
as for intermittent
use.

wells, the cable is within the interval of
wax crystallization.
Nefteservis-NN says production in
wells equipped with the cable increased
from 10-30% and uptime of wells with
ESPs has increased to 700 or more days
from 365 days.
It estimates that for wells producing
150-220 bo/d with continuous operation of the cable at 50 kw, the unit will
pay out in about 60 days.
The standard set of equipment for
the unit includes heating cable, control
desk with spare parts, wellhead packer,
connection terminal, wellhead wired
temperature gauge, flash memory
(MMS-card), and software. Fig. 1
shows one installation on a well in
Russia.
Additional equipment includes well-

head running in hole and pulling out
of hole device, step-up transformer (if
cable length is greater than 1,150 m),
and drawworks.
Fig. 2 shows workers installing the
cable.
The automatic controls allow for:
• Switching on and off the cable
heating.
• Controlling cable voltage and load
current.
• Controlling temperature change.
• Decreasing heat when pump unit
is off.
• Protecting the cable from short
circuits.
• Switching on after power interruption or when temperature drops
below the wax crystallization point.
• Monitoring operation parameters.
• Recording operations.

• Data transmission for remote
monitoring and control from a distant
control room or personal computer. The
sites in Russia use wire-linked modems
or cellular communication with GSMmodems.
The cable except for the load-bearing
wireline has armored polymeric skin.
For lengths greater than 2,000 m, the
cable has a central load-bearing wireline (Figs. 3 and 4).
To obtain greater cable reliability,
Nefteservis-NN connects the heating
conductors to various poles of a feed
supply by dividing them into groups
through isolating wire bundles.
Nefteservis-NN says that since 2004
no well equipment with the cable has
ceased production or needed repair
because of wax accumulation.

Petrobras’s 5-year plan targets large production expansion
unit in Baleia Azul in fourth-quarter
2012.
In the Baleia Franca, Petrobras said
it has found about a 400-m oil column
similar to the column found in Iara, a
discovery in the Santos basin that is 600
km from Baleia Franca.
It now estimates that its presalt area
has a similar size to the entire US Gulf
of Mexico area.
The figure below does not include
projects operated by other companies,
such as Chevron’s Frade and Shell’s
Parque das Conchas and Parque da Baleia. Frade and Parque das Conchas are
expected to start production in 2009.
Petrobras has five large gas projects
starting in 2009. Camarupim includes
an FPSO for producing 6 million cu
m/day, Canapu is a pipe-in-pipe system that produces 2 million cu m/day,
Lagosta produces 1.5 million cu m/
day, Manati expansion produces 2 million cu m/day, and the Urucu system
brings about 6 million cu m/day of
gas from the middle of Amazonas to
Manaus.
During 2009-13, Petrobras expects
to start production from 10 large oil
projects and 3 large gas projects.

The Tupi pilot will produce to a
100,000-b/d FPSO, with production
starting in December 2010. Cachalote,
Baleia Franca, and Baleia Ana will produce to an FPSO moved from Golfinho
to accelerate presalt production. Jubarte
presalt development includes installation of the P-57 FPSO in 2011. Also in
2011, Petrobras plans to install the P-56
FPSO in Marlim Sul.
In 2013, it expects to install five
offshore facilities, with three producing
180,000 b/d each. Guara or Iara will
have a 100,000-b/d FPSO for producing the presalt in the Santos Basin.
Mexilhao is an offshore gas field
with a fixed platform expected to produce 15 million cu m/day, starting in
2010.
In 2009, Petrobras expects to add
seven rigs to the two drilling in the
presalt in 2008. It will increase the rig
count to six more in 2010 and one
more in 2011, for 16 drilling rigs for
the presalt below 2,000 m of water.
The company estimates the production from the presalt will reach
219,000 b/d of oil and 7 million cu
m/day of gas in 2013, increasing to
582,000 b/d of oil in 2015 and 1.8
million b/d in 2020. The discovered
presalt oil has 28-31° gravity. ✦

Petroleo Brasilerio
SA (Petrobras) in its
2010-13 strategic plan,
released in January, included the development
of presalt discoveries as
Production
well as continued development of discovered
heavy oil and gas accumulations.
The figure below shows the timetable for its operated fields that sees
its oil production increasing to 2.68
million b/d in 2013 from 2.05 million b/d in 2009. Combined gas and
oil production increases to 3.32 million boe/d in 2013 from 2.51 million
boe/d in 2009.
Its assessment is that by 2020, its
share of presalt production will reach
1.8 million bo/d. Announced producible oil estimates in subsalt discoveries
include 5-8 billion bbl in Tupi, 3-4
billion bbl in Iara, and 1.5-2 billion bbl
in Jubarte, for a total of 9.5-14 billion
bbl. When added to its booked reserves,
these estimated will nearly double
Petrobras’s proved reserves.
Jubarte is in the Espirito Santo portion of the Campos basin and was the
first presalt find to begin production.
The field produces a 30° oil to the
P-34 floating production, storage, and
offloading (FPSO) vessel. Petrobras
estimates that with the subsalt finds in
the Jubarte and Parque das Baleias area,
total volumes discovered including the
heavy oil above the salt is about 3.5 billion boe.
Other activity in the Jubarte presalt
area includes:
• Starting pilot production from
Cachalote field to the Seillean FPSO in
December 2008.
• Moving the Capixaba FPSO from
Golfinho field to Cachalote-Beleia
Franca in the first-half 2010.
• Starting pilot production of Baleia
Azul to the Pipa II FPSO in second-half
2010.
• Installing a permanent production

Although digital control systems—distributed

equipment—are present Gas Processing
in practically every process safety management

facilities in the midstream oil and gas
industry, the use
of the automatic

continues to be
lower than it
could be.
Many issues
contribute to the large number of control loops that can be found in manual
mode at most facilities, and most control strategies employed in today’s midstream processes simply mimic designs

deliver substantial operating benefits
over the long term.
Control systems seem to be regarded
in many operations as more a necessary
evil than a benefit, and the choice of
control equipment, the execution of the
programming tasks, and the theoretical
knowledge of many of the designers of
complex controls reflect this attitude.
Even though control systems can
have a major impact on operations
for good or ill, much more time and
energy are spent on the maintenance of
rotating machinery and other process
equipment run by the control system
than on the most essential components
of the control system—the engineering and design of the software included
in the system that converts it from a
collection of parts into a purpose-built
system tailored to control a specific
facility.
Yet control systems can play just as
beneficial a role in successful processing operations as a well-maintained
6,000-hp compressor or a modern
cryogenic demethanizer.

include the following:

control strategy to ensure the chiller
tubes are always operated at efficient
refrigerant levels. Refrigeration horsepower and heat exchanger surface
area are used to process the maximum
achievable capacity of gas with the
most effective temperature control of
processed gas.
• Lean oil plants. There are still many
refrigerated absorption (lean oil)
facilities operating in which additional
ethane recovery is insufficient to justify
the capital cost of replacement with a
turboexpander plant or the gas composition is not well suited for turboexpander processing. Opportunities exist
to implement enhanced control strategies at many such plants, including:
—Lean oil/inlet ratio controls to
compensate for inlet composition
and tower loading. The ratio strategy
includes constraints to ensure adequate
contactor liquid loading, deethanizer
operation performance, and NGL fractionation.
—Refrigeration load management
and refrigerant level optimization for
chiller efficiency and stable operation.
—Predictive control of de-ethanizer
feed composition for enhanced response to load changes and upsets.
—Composition control for the lean
oil still for consistent absorber performance and NGL quality control.
—Enhanced steam boiler (where
used) firing rate control to stabilize
steam-driven equipment operation during upsets and large load start-ups and
shutdowns.
• Cryogenic turboexpander plants. Turboexpander plants for deep cut NGL
recovery typically operate with a basic
control strategy. A pressure controller
regulates the expander vanes, while
a temperature controller maintains
bottoms composition. The majority of
these plants do not employ any sort of
composition control on the demethanizer, and the processing rate is typically determined either by an operator
readjusting the speed of recompressors
or, in more automated instances, by
a simple pressure controller regulat-

ing the speed or recycle valve on the

Yet with a small investment, most
turboexpander plants can reliably incorporate both demethanizer composition control and enhanced processing
rate control in the basic process control
system.
Field-proven strategies have been
successfully implemented and operated
over long periods on cryogenic turboexpander plants, including:
—Turboexpander plant processing
rate control. Processing rates are determined by the supply of available inlet
gas or by setting of a desired rate for
a straddle plant, subject to equipment
limits such as demethanizers maximum
allowable operating pressure (MAOP)
or recompressor differential pressure or
rod loading.
Coordinated manipulation of expander vanes and recompressor capacity
continuously readjusts conditions in the
direction of the highest recovery possible for a given rate and feed composi-

tion. This design has been used in single
and parallel train sites. This strategy
has been operated reliably for up to 15
years at several sites (Fig. 2).
—Demethanizer bottoms composition control (Fig. 3). This strategy continuously corrects tower boil-up based
upon changes in bottoms temperature,
tower pressure, expander discharge
temperature, and other relevant conditions. Paired with rate control to eliminate the need for operator adjustments
whenever the demethanizer pressure
changes (Fig. 4), it can employ a typical
existing multistream analyzer to reduce
capital costs.
Analysis data are tested before use
each time a sample is received, and this
has proven effective in maintaining the
strategy in long-term service. Operators
are unlikely to return untrustworthy
strategies to automatic after repeated
failures. This composition control
strategy has been in use as long as the
rate-management strategy.

cause control problems.
And because analyzer samples are
used periodically to correct the model
rather than in closed-loop control, analyzer failures can usually be corrected
without causing composition control
problems. Several sites have operated
reliably for years with this type of DCSbased control.

When automatically corrected with
validated on stream analyzer data,
composition models are reliable and
accurate for advanced control strategies.
Performance of automatic tests on the
reasonability of new analysis data typically catch analyzer failures before they

Most gas and NGL treating, recovery,
and fractionation plants use some form
of heating system, such as steam from
boilers and waste-heat boilers or heatmedium circulation from direct-fired
heaters and waste-heat recovery units.
Because there are usually multiple heat
sources in parallel and multiple heat
users also in parallel, however, heating systems frequently cause process
cycling and upsets.
A disturbance in one tower can cause
the heating system to cycle in reaction, thus upsetting all the other heat
supply and heat-consuming equipment.
Frequently a few flow and temperature controllers are the only automatic
controls, with the operator setting a
significant amount of excess recycle
heat medium flow or waste steam to
the deaerator to handle surges in self
defense. Without an overall strategy to
balance the supply of heating fluid with
the demand, each change in supply or
demand causes an upset in the other
side of the equation.
Although “advanced” control is not
typically required here, the arrangement of control loops can make major
differences determining whether the
heating system is a tool for maintaining
stable control or is another contributor
to upsets and quality variation in Amine
stills, demethanizers, and fractionators.
And if properly designed, the control
strategy can prevent heat-medium
breakdown (a common problem) due
to overheating.
It can also be designed to ensure that

required is a few carefully arranged PID
loops with effective tuning to maintain
a balance between heating fluid supply
and demand.

Executing a successful project
Like all successful projects, an advanced control project requires certain
steps in its execution to achieve the de-

sired results and to ensure that it delivers long-term benefits. To be successful,
an APC project needs:
• Clear objectives (scope).
• Adequate resources in terms of
instrumentation and DCS or PLC equipment as well as skilled personnel for
implementation.
• Committed management support.

Example ‘dashboard’ indicators
1. For all APC/ARC strategies:
• % time in automatic for previous 30 days (or other interval).
• Number of times placed in manual for previous 30 days (or other
interval).
• Number of analyzer or other instrument failure alarms previous
30 days (or other interval).
2. For compressor control performance:
• Average compression ratio each stage.
• Speciﬁc fuel consumption, btu/hp-hr.
• Fuel consumption, btu/MMscf of throughput.
3. For plant control performance:
• Number off-spec events for previous 30 days (or other interval).
• Average C1/C2 ratio.
• Average recovery of C3+.
• Average btu/bbl of NGL.
• Average volume processed.

• Proper precommissioning
preparation.
• Effective
commissioning.
• Thorough
operator training.
• Monitoring

tools (“dashboards”) to verify
effective use.
• Periodic
maintenance and
operator refresher
training.
APC projects
are typically initiated based either
upon a process
study that has
determined that
the achievable
benefits justify the
investment and are
sustainable or upon the need to manage a known performance issue such
as product specifications in which the
cause of off-specification product has
been determined to be control-related.
The first step is to survey available
information, control system capacity,
operator familiarity with advanced controls and with the process, and condition of instrumentation and control
devices such as valves. Of particular
significance is the condition of any on
stream analyzers and the maintenance
support that is available to deal with any
issues that may be identified with the
quality of on stream analysis.
Although APC and ARC controls can
be engineered to be reliable during
analyzer failures, on stream analyzers
must provide accurate data when they
are functioning correctly. Lack of skilled
analyzer support staff will severely impair the ability to execute a successful
APC project.
Another important step in building
a successful APC project is in the testing, repairing, and tuning of the basic
control loops that already exist in the
plant or that will be added to support
the APC or ARC strategy. Many of the

Special Report

benefits of an advanced control project
accrue from this first step, and it is an
important one, whether the project is
to implement a DCS-based APC/ARC
upgrade or to install advanced multivariable control software for a complex
process.
Too much focus on the advanced aspects of the project can result in missed
opportunities to gain improved control
benefits by ensuring that all instruments
and valves are working properly and all
major loops are controlling as well as
possible at the lowest level.
Commissioning is another major
step. It is important to stress test the
APC/ARC strategy under real-world
conditions. All constraints and alarms
should be verified, and any special
event logic or override loops should be
triggered or forced into action to verify
stability.
Operator familiarization and training may be the single most important
aspect of an APC/ARC project. If any
of the operators lack confidence or
familiarity with the use of and expected
behavior of the controls, additional
training and “go-by” documentation
needs to be provided. If the APC/ARC
controls at times make process changes
that are counter intuitive or go against
prevailing beliefs about how the process
should be operated, their performance
needs to be demonstrated to each operator until the confidence to trust the
controls is developed.
It is also true that operators are
often aware of equipment constraints
or process events that are infrequent
enough that the APC/ARC engineer
may be unaware of them. Having all the
operators undergo first-hand controller operation in training (as opposed
to classroom training) can provide
additional design feedback that can be
used to make the strategy more reliable.
Make no bones about it: Reliability is
a primary requirement of a successful
APC/ARC strategy.
To ensure that the strategies are used
by operations and to provide management and maintenance with adequate
feedback about the successful operation

of the controls, each project should
include automatic reporting and the
configuration of a display “dashboard”
that provides readily understood
performance measurements, or key
performance indicators (KPIs). An accompanying box presents an example
of “dashboard” indicators.
Finally, to provide sustained performance and true justification for investment, the successful APC/ARC project
must include adequate documentation
to permit the operating staff to perform
routine troubleshooting and maintenance. It is also important to incorporate periodic site visits of a few days or
remote PC access by APC/ARC support
engineers to verify tuning, address
issues that have arisen, and perform
refresher training for previous and
replacement operators. The periodic site
visits should be scheduled at least annually, if not more often. This continued
investment will be a small cost compared with the annual returns the APC/
ARC strategies typically achieve. ✦

The factor of safety (FP/MAOP)
reflects the severity of damage to cased
pipe integrity by corrosion anomalies
independent of an individual pipe’s
nominal WT, OD, and steel properties
characterized by the specified minimum
yield strength (SMYS) because both
failure pressure (FP) and maximum
allowable operating pressure (MAOP)
are proportional to the term SMYS (2
× WT/OD), based on the original or
modified ASME B31G. FP/MAOP thus
can give an unbiased estimate of the
threat of corrosion anomalies for different pipe sections (with different WT or
OD) from different operators.
Fig. 1 shows a plot of the number
and cumulative percentage of anomalies
vs. FP/MAOP. Only five peak anomalies of the total 272 have FP/MAOP
less than 1.39 (requiring a scheduled
response action following Modified
B31G). These do not, however, include
the deepest anomaly (84% WT) whose
FP/MAOP is rather large, 1.64, due to
its small length (0.79 in.).
Following modified ASME B31G criteria, the pipe segment containing this
deepest anomaly (>80% WT) requires
replacement to prevent a leak. The lowest FP/MAOP for all peak anomalies is
1.28.
Excluding this deepest anomaly,
98.2% of the remaining peak anomalies
require no response action according to
modified B31G for carrier pipes with a
design factor of 0.72. For crossings of
roads or railroads with casings, ASME
B31.8 recommends a design factor of
0.72 (1/1.39) for both Division 1 and
Division 2 of Class 1, except for private
roads of Division 1 where the recommended design factor is 0.8.
Of all cased pipe segments studied

Fig. 1 also shows 46% of all
anomalies as having FP/MAOP falling
between 1.7 and 2.1, inclusive. The
average is 2.1 and the median is 2.0.
This high average ratio reinforces the
idea that cased crossings are in excellent condition overall.
FP/MAOP can help determine if

the severity of an individual anomaly
is preferentially located near the ends
of cased pipe segments, similar to the
preferential location of anomalies along
cased pipe segments discussed in Part 1.

each figure. Since the difference in
the distribution for the five different
distance ranges reflects levels of the
corrosion damage severity along cased
pipe segments, the similarity of the five
distributions (representing different
distances along the cased pipe segments) indicates the damage severity of
individual anomalies does not depend
on locations.
A simple example is given here to
explain the nonpreferential location
of damage severity of peak anomalies

casings on one pipeline with the same

The 1988 OPS
report2 under the

US Department
of Transportation
stated, based on a
casing study, that
“a shorted casing
does not enhance
or reduce corrosion activity on carrier pipe.” This statement seems to contradict the normal
understanding that a metallic short can
increase the chances of carrier pipe corrosion because of its possible elimination of CP benefits.
Fig. 3 summarizes the ILI data for
cased pipe segments in this OPS report
following reexamination and new
analysis in the current study. Among the
total 1,043 casings, the nonshorted casings (a subtotal of 862 casings or 83%
of total casings) are four times more
numerous than the shorted casings (a
subtotal of 181 casings or 17% of total
casings).
Although the number of cased pipe
segments with corrosion anomalies
(anomaly depth was not specified in
the report) for nonshorted casings (21)
is slightly less than for shorted casings
(23), the percentage of nonshorted
cased pipe segments with anomalies
among its subtotal (2.4%, or 21 of
862) is much smaller than the percentage of shorted casings (12.7%, 23 of
181), suggesting shorted casings are
more susceptible to corrosion than
nonshorted casings.

Only four companies provided data
for this study with shorted and nonshorted casings labeled. But data from
only two of these four companies
included corrosion peak anomalies of
any depth, information sufficient to
determine the effect of metallic short
on external corrosion.
Table 1 summarizes data from
these two companies, for which both
total casings, including those without
anomalies on the carrier pipe, and casings with a peak anomaly depth of 20%

Eastern ruptured under Kentucky State
Highway 90.
The escaping gas ignited and burned
an area about 700 ft long and 500 ft
wide. Five persons in one house were
killed and three others burned as they
ran from their mobile home. There was
extensive damage to buildings, construction equipment, and other property.
The NTSB report stated the probable
cause of the accident was “unsuspected
and undetected atmospheric corrosion.” Atmospheric corrosion occurs on
a pipeline when moisture from the air,
along with contaminates, comes into
contact with the exposed metal.6
This casing was located about 2
miles downstream of a compressor
station with line temperatures of 140160° F. High heat had badly damaged
the coating. The presence of vents and
the line temperatures consistently
higher than local temperature caused
cyclic water condensation on the carrier
pipe, providing electrolyte necessary for
the atmospheric corrosion.
Reviewing the DOT reportable incident database for the period between
Aug. 7, 1984, and Nov. 8, 2006, provided an understanding of the number
of incidents involving cased crossings
and the number caused by external corrosion.
A search of the DOT reportable-incident database related to casings turned
up a total of 11 incidents involving
cased crossings. Table 2 summarizes
these incidents.
Among the 11 known incidents, corrosion caused 5 (highlighted in red on
the table). Excavation damage accounted
for 3. Reports noted the causes of the
other 3 incidents as either unknown
or miscellaneous. These results point to
corrosion and excavation as the primary
causes of failures in cased crossings.
Of the 5 corrosion incidents, 3
resulted from atmospheric corrosion
(Texas Eastern Pipeline Co., 1985;
Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America,
1992; and Columbia Gulf Transmission,
2006).

Investigators do not know the exact
cause of the failure, but a preliminary
visual examination suggested external
corrosion to be the cause. Investigators suspect corrosion inside the casing
caused the explosion, but are not certain whether the failure actually initiated inside or outside the casing.

Relative safety
The casing length distribution
determines total mileage of the 2,733
casings surveyed for this study (Fig.
5). Actual casing data determined the
values in the blocks with solid edges;
values in blocks with broken edges
were calculated.
Of the 2,733 casings, known lengths
existed for 1,357 with a total mileage of 26.815. This mileage consists of
7.031 miles of 272 casings containing
a peak anomaly ≥20% WT and 19.785
miles of the remaining 1,085 casings
that either do not have an anomaly or
have a peak anomaly depth <20% WT.

The average length of the latter casings
is 96.36 ft.
This average can be used to derive
the mileage of the 2,461 (2,733 minus
272) casings that either do not have an
anomaly or have a peak anomaly depth
<20% WT. The mileage of these 2,461
casings equals 44.916. Adding this to
mileage of the 272 casings with peak
anomaly depth ≥ 20% WT yields a total
mileage for 2,733 casings of 51.947.
Of the estimated 51.947 miles of
casings surveyed, 5 peak anomalies have
FP/MAOP <1.39. These anomalies do
not include the anomaly with depth
of 84% WT. Using 5 as the number for
scheduled responses yields a response
rate of 0.0963 scheduled response/
mile.
Since no anomaly has an FP/
MAOP <1.1, no immediate response is
required. The anomaly of 84% WT in
depth requires replacement of the pipe
section, a rate of 0.019 replacement/
mile. Including this deepest anomaly
in the scheduled response yields a
scheduled response and replacement
response/mile of 0.115.
The exclusion of one casing with
nonpeak anomalies in a casing limits
this safety analysis. Including nonpeak
anomalies in this analysis requires
excluding Companies B and G because
they did not provide nonpeak anomaly
data.
The casings of A, C, D, E, and F
total 1,185. Of these 108 had a peak
anomaly ≥20% WT. Of the 108 casings,
5 peak anomalies were recorded with
FP/MAOP <1.39, requiring scheduled response per ASME B31G. For the
1,185 casings, anomalies <20% WT in
depth totaled 2,553 (minimum depth
recorded 5% WT), averaging roughly
2.15 anomalies per casing. Of the 2,553
anomalies, 38 were recorded with FP/
MAOP <1.39 and none with FP/MAOP
<1.1.

Studies challenge
job creation via
overhaul of energy
A centerpiece of the Obama administration’s proposal to overhaul US energy
markets—the promise of an employment
surge from “green jobs”—has come under
attack.
Two recent studies strengthen doubt
that wasteful spending is a way to bolster employment. A study published by
University Rey Juan Carlos of Madrid
examines the experience of Spain, which

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

has followed the European Union pattern
of subsidizing renewable energy in quest
of green jobs. The Obama administration’s
aggressive energy initiatives emulate that
model. Results aren’t encouraging, say
authors Gabriel Calzada Alvarez, Raquel
Merino Jara, Juan Ramon Rallo Julian, and
Jose Ignacio Garcia Bielsa.
They don’t hesitate to relate Spain’s
experience to the US initiative. “The study’s
results demonstrate how such ‘green jobs’
policy clearly hinders Spain’s way out of
the current economic crisis, even while
US politicians insist that rushing into such
a scheme will ease their own emergence
from the turmoil,” the authors say.
From an analysis of data for Spain
generated by the Monitoring and Modeling
Initiative on Targets for Renewable Energy,
partly funded by the European Commission, the study draws this conclusion:
“For every renewable-energy job that
the state manages to ﬁnance…the US
should expect a loss of at least 2.2 jobs on
average, or about 9 jobs for every 4 created, to which we have to add those jobs
that nonsubsidized investments with the
same resources would have created.”
A University of Illinois paper, meanwhile, examines literature projecting
massive creation of high-quality green jobs
via government subsidization of renewable
energy and concludes that it’s “built on
mythologies about economics, forecasting,
and technology.” Authors are Andrew P.
Morriss of the University of Illinois College
of Law, William T. Bogart of York College
of Pennsylvania, Andrew Dorchak of Case
Western Reserve University Law Library,
and Roger E. Meiners of the University of
Texas at Arlington.

which the lead author is director, at www.

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

Oil prices climbed in March, April
After trading at lower levels for 4 months, benchmark oil prices climbed above
$50/bbl in late March and early April, exceeding $52/bbl in light trading Apr. 9 ahead
of commodity markets closing for the Good Friday holiday in New York and London.
For 4 weeks through Apr. 9, the May crude contract ﬁnished each week on the
New York Mercantile Exchange at virtually the same price as the previous week, said
Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland.
Oil prices, however, fell below $50/bbl in early trading Apr. 13 amid negative economical indicators after the Paris-based International Energy Agency again reduced
its 2009 estimate of world demand for oil. Based on its reassessment of world gross
domestic product and lower-than-expected ﬁrst quarter demand data, IEA lowered
its outlook by 1 million b/d to 83.4 million b/d—the lowest level in 5 years and 2.4
million b/d below the 2008 level.
“The pace of contraction is close to early 1980s levels, with a growing consensus
that economic and oil demand recovery will be deferred to 2010,” said IEA ofﬁcials. It
was the eighth consecutive month IEA reduced its original forecast of 2009 demand.
Oil supplies decline
IEA reported global oil supplies fell 400,000 b/d to 83.4 million b/d in March.
Oil produced by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries declined by
235,0000 b/d from February to 27.8 million b/d in March. Among OPEC members
other than Iraq, production was up 720,000 b/d above their 24.9 million b/d target
quota.
“Supplies stand at 5-year lows amid exceptionally weak demand, with [OPEC]
ministers meeting again May 28. Effective spare capacity is around 5.5 million b/d.
The call on OPEC crude and stock change is 28.2 million b/d for 2009, 2.6 million b/d
below 2008 levels,” said IEA. Non-OPEC supplies fell 170,000 b/d, with a 220,000 b/d
dip among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development partly offset by higher non-OECD output. IEA reduced its 2009 estimate of nonOPEC supplies by 320,000 b/d, largely due to lower biofuels production and weaker
ﬁrst quarter crude production in Asia. “Non-OPEC output now falls from 50.6 million
b/d in 2008 to 50.3 million b/d in 2009,” IEA said.
In Houston, analysts at Raymond James & Associates Inc. noted, “The agency
also said that February 2009 oil inventories in developed nations grew to the highest
levels recorded since 1993. The IEA revision occurred despite Chinese data showing
increasing crude oil imports and industrial output growth. Preliminary trade data revealed that China imported 16.3 million [tonnes] of crude oil in March, up 33% from
11.7 million [tonnes] in February, as industrial output growth grew to 8.3% in March
after a record low of 3.8% in the ﬁrst 2 months of 2009.”
OECD industry stocks increased 7.5 million bbl in February to 2.74 billion bbl, 7.2%
above year-ago levels. Lower North American products only partially offset a rise
in Paciﬁc crude stocks. An upward revision to January inventories, plus increasing
February stocks and weaker forward demand, pushed stock cover to 61.6 days by the
end of February, 7.9 days above a year ago.
IEA expects lower global crude runs to persist through into the third quarter.
“Demand revisions, weak middle distillate cracks and reports of bulging product
inventories in several markets, suggest a further painful period of weak margins as
reﬁners adjust operating rates to the 2.8% decline in demand now expected for this
year,” ofﬁcials said.
Coal-to-gas switching
Meanwhile, Raymond James analysts reported, “Over the past 6 months, natural
gas and coal prices have plummeted, dropping 50% and 60%, respectively.” Under
current conditions, they said, the market price that most likely would encourage
customers to switch from coal to gas is “near $3.25/Mcf.” They added, “This is just a
theoretical guess given that the actual price band using the full range of gas and coal
plant efﬁciencies could be as low as $2/Mcf and as high as $4/Mcf.”
The analysts said, “Despite the persistent talk of coal-to-gas switching, it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd evidence to support such claims on a massive scale.” They anticipate an
average 500 MMcfd of coal-to-gas switching in the period of Nov. 1-Oct. 31. “At most,
we wouldn’t expect more than 1.5 bcfd of coal-to-gas fuel switching to actually occur,
and that would only last for a few months in the spring. The bottom line is that coalto-gas fuel switching would not appear to be the savior of the summer gas market,
nor the death knell for the coal markets,” said Raymond James ofﬁcials.

Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition
July 14 – 16, 2009
Calgary TELUS Convention Centre, Calgary, Alberta, Canada

REGISTER TODAY!

Oil for tomorrow
THE PROMISE. THE PRACTICE.
Technologies developed for the oil sands and heavy oil resources of Alberta are vital to more than tomorrow’s oil supply.
They represent solutions to problems encountered throughout the oil industry.
Problems like managing costs during periods of lower oil prices, dealing with labor shortages, handling sulfur, controlling
air emissions, producing oil under difficult conditions, mitigating surface impacts, recycling produced water, capturing and
sequestering carbon dioxide, and more.
While it finds solutions to these challenges, the oil sands and heavy oil industry continues to develop unconventional
resources that are critical to meeting the world’s long-term needs for reliable hydrocarbon supplies.
Continued progress in oil sands and heavy oil producing technologies means progress in ensuring a dependable supply of
petroleum products at a time when traditional recovery methods are strained by additional demand from rapidly developing
industrial nations.
The Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition is the premier forum for the people who make this
innovation and progress possible.
Don’t miss this opportunity to present your product or service to a powerful, influential audience. Join the Oil & Gas
Journal and our conference attendees in Calgary this summer for the third annual Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies
Conference and Exhibition.

INTEQ

Advancing Reservoir Performance

Critical Answers. Delivered While Drilling.
The signs were there. But only Baker Hughes could read them.
Objective:

To achieve what the competition could not— accurately identify tar located directly below
an oil reservoir so injector wells could be optimally placed to stimulate oil production.

Environment:

Manifa Field, Saudi Arabia

Technology:

A combination of INTEQ LWD services: MagTrak™, the industry’s only 4 3/4 -in. magnetic
resonance tool; TesTrak™, real-time formation pressure service that achieved 95%
seal efficiency; and LithoTrak™ density and porosity logging.

Answers:

Baker Hughes delivered answers the client needed for accurate formation evaluation
and optimum wellbore placement. The tar location was confirmed, and Baker Hughes
drilled the injection well more than 30,000 ft (9,144 m), precisely and efficiently.

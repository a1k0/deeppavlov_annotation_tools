COVER
Shown is Technip’s CSO Apache in Evanton, Scotland, as pipe is
being spooled onto the vessel using the reeling method prior to deployment in the UK North Sea’s Forties field.The vessel laid 5.25
km of 14-in. OD, high-frequency induction welded, coated steel
line pipe with a 16 mm WT between Charlie and Bravo platforms
in the Forties.The pipe replaced the same length of internally
corroded 20-in. OD pipe laid in 1975. Corus Tubes manufactured
the pipe for Apache North Seas on a 9-week turnaround requested
by the latter to meet the lay vessel’s window of opportunity and
minimize pipeline downtime. Oil & Gas Journal’s special Pipeline
Report, which begins on p. 50, examines efforts under way in both
arctic and deepwater environments to maximize pipelines’ usable
life by effectively addressing potential environmental problems during a project’s design and planning stages. Photo from Corus Tubes.

Speed:
it’s genetic
It starts with the right people and it ends with the
right solution. Riser technologies from GE’s VetcoGray
business have a long and successful heritage and the
latest generation is our new MR-6H SE riser coupling –
rated for 3.5 million pounds. The traditional make-up
process involves two 3,000 lb ﬂanges being joined by
the brute force of several crew members on deck. But
the MR-6H SE is fully automated – removing crew from
this hazardous setting – and doing in 60 seconds what
would otherwise take 20 minutes. The award-winning
technology’s time and cost savings are revolutionary.
Make-up speed – it’s in our DNA.

The Next Generation of Deepwater Challenges
Plan now to join industry colleagues and conference host
Woodside Petroleum for the 20th Deep Offshore Technology (DOT)

International Conference & Exhibition 3 – 5 December 2008 in
Perth, Australia.
E&P operations offshore Australia encounter the full scope
of technology challenges – deepwater conditions, remote
ﬁeld locations, deep gas development challenges, hostile
environments, seaﬂoor issues, difﬁcult currents, ﬂow assurance
issues, long distances from infrastructure, logistical challenges,
isolation from heavy lift and installation vessels – you name it
and Australia has it all.
This year’s DOT addresses virtually every technology issue that any
deepwater operator will ever have to face. Plan today to exhibit,
sponsor and attend this exciting event, along with the industry’s
leaders and brightest minds in this unique technology showcase.

EU-Russia summit delegates look to next meeting
A summit between Russia and members of the European Union,
held Nov. 14 in Nice, France, was seen as an opportunity for EU
members to resume negotiations on furthering EU-Russia pacts on
economic, energy, and security issues.
Talks occurred despite Russia’s not fully complying with its
commitment to fully restore the territorial integrity of Georgia following its August attack on that country. The EU had postponed
negotiations when the conflict in Georgia broke out. Negotiations,
in fact, had not resumed at the summit but are slated to begin again
Dec. 2.
The summit talks mostly were used by delegates for what French
President Nicolas Sarkozy referred to as “pan-European security” as
well as for smoothing out the many “irritants” that have recently
cropped up.
These irritants included Russia’s threat to deploy missiles in
Kaliningrad, a Russian enclave between Lithuania and Poland, to
counter the US antimissile sytem in countries bordering Russia,
Poland, and the Czech Republic.
Also attending the summit with President Sarkozy, who also
serves as EU president until yearend, were Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, Commissioner for External Relations and European
Neighborhood Policy Benita Ferrero-Waldner, and Trade Commissioner Catherine Ashton.
European security matters would be discussed further at a meeting in mid-2009 within the framework of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe.

House Dems won’t try to restore OCS moratoriums
US House Democratic leaders will not try to reimpose offshore
oil and gas leasing moratoriums that expired at the end of September, Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) said on Nov. 18.
There probably will be attempts to delineate where leasing will
take place, he told an audience at the National Press Club. “I do
not believe at this point that there are any proposals being made to
reinstate the moratoriums across the board,” Hoyer said.
His remarks came a day after US Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) said the US
needs an intelligent policy to promote more domestic oil and gas
production, both onshore and offshore.
“That production has to be undertaken in an environmentally responsible way, and with recognition that multiple users and
stakeholders are involved,” Bingaman said in remarks at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies on Nov. 17.
Bingaman suggested that congressional moratoriums on Outer
Continental Shelf leasing began in the early 1980s as a reaction to
what he described as “a large and ill-conceived offshore leasing

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

effort” by James G. Watt, former US President Ronald Reagan’s first
Interior secretary. “I hope that we are smarter and more strategic
this time in how we go about dealing with offshore oil and gas
resources,” he said.
Bingaman said the next step might be “a serious and expeditious inventory” of OCS energy resources. Congress called for an
OCS inventory in the 2005 Energy Policy Act but never provided
funding to carry it out, he noted.
“Major energy development projects require a steady strategy
and steady investments over the long term, so they need to be
based on a stable political consensus that isn’t reversed every few
years. That means that our energy decision-making on the [OCS],
as well as onshore, needs to be based on the best data we can collect on both the energy and environmental characteristics of potential areas for production. Getting that data on a priority basis
will greatly increase the chances that we will make energy supply
choices that will be sustainable economically, environmentally, and
politically,” Bingaman said.
Responding to Hoyer’s comment, the American Petroleum Institute said that it is the right approach. “Neither Congress nor the
next administration should set unreasonable, arbitrary limits on
leasing because such restrictions could remove some of the nation’s most promising oil and gas prospects for development, and
the industry has proven it can develop these resources in an environmentally safe manner,” it said in a Nov. 18 statement.
In his prepared remarks, Hoyer said the first focus of the next
Congress will be to restore US economic health by rebuilding
worn-out infrastructure, helping hard-pressed states and demonstrating fiscal responsibility.

IOGCC chair calls for bipartisan efforts
Oklahoma Gov. Brad Henry assumed the chairmanship of the
Interstate Oil & Gas Compact Commission by calling upon US
lawmakers to work together toward providing policies to ensure
stable, sustainable energy supplies.
“It’s more critical now than ever before that we work together
in a bipartisan manner,” Henry said in addressing the IOGCC annual meeting Nov. 17 in Santa Fe, NM. He took over as chairman
when Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin’s term as IOGCC chair ended. Palin,
formerly the Republican vice-presidential candidate, did not attend
the meeting.
Henry noted how public clamor about energy dies when oil
and gasoline prices decline as they have in recent weeks. But he
said energy still needs to be a national priority, and that energyproducing states should help steer the direction of energy policy.
“Nearly 70% of our nation’s oil comes from foreign sources,”
Henry said. “The goal of energy independence is too complex to
believe that renewables alone will be the solution.”

Marathon Oil Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Clarence Cazalot said the world faces an energy transition in learning
how to deal with the long-term fundamentals of growing global
energy demand in the face of constrained energy supplies.
Cazalot called for the US to develop “a comprehensive, factbased energy plan integrated with climate change” concerns. “All
energy sources are going to become increasingly important components of any energy plan,” Cazalot said. Nonetheless, he said fossil fuels will dominate world energy supplies through 2030.
The energy plan needs to include efficiency and conservation,
diversified energy supply, and the development of new technology,
he said.

EIA: OPEC production dropped in October
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries produced
a total of 32.3 million b/d of crude oil in October, down 100,000
b/d on month, according to the US Energy Information Administration.
EIA estimated OPEC’s production capacity to be 34.24 million
b/d and its spare production capacity to be 1.93 million b/d.
It said OPEC’s 12 producers, excluding Iraq and Indonesia, pro-

duced 29.13 million b/d in October, and exceeded the organization’s output target of 28.8 million b/d by 330,000 b/d.
Although Angola increased production, Indonesia, Nigeria,
Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela all saw declines. Production remained steady in Algeria, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, and
the UAE.
EIA projects that OPEC crude production will drop even further
to 31.3 million b/d in first quarter 2009, where it will remain
relatively stable through yearend 2009.
In terms of revenues, EIA said OPEC could earn $979 billion
of net oil export revenues in 2008, and $595 billion in 2009. EIA
did not explain the substantially reduced earnings projection for
2009.
Through October, OPEC has earned an estimated $884 billion
in net oil export earnings in 2008, while in 2007 it earned $671
billion in net oil export revenues, a 10% increase over 2006.
Saudi Arabia earned the largest share of these earnings, $194
billion, representing 29% of total OPEC revenues. On a per capita
basis, OPEC net oil export earnings increased by 8% over 2006,
reaching $1,137. ✦

ExxonMobil signs Black Sea exploration deal
An ExxonMobil Corp. affiliate signed an agreement with Turkey’s
state oil company TPAO to explore two large deepwater blocks off
Turkey, marking ExxonMobil’s entry into Black Sea exploration.
ExxonMobil Exploration & Production Turkey BV will be operator in the initial exploration phase and earn a 50% interest in the
8,500 sq km Samsun Block and the 21,000 sq km eastern portion
of the 3921 Block, which lie in 2,000 m of water. The two blocks
are in the Black Sea basin and are separated by a lease held by TPAO
and Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA.
TPAO and ExxonMobil will merge skills and operational abilities during the development and production phases scheduled for
completion in 2009. Assignment of the interest to ExxonMobil by
TPAO is subject to Turkish government approval.
“ExxonMobil is pleased to team up with TPAO to explore the
hydrocarbon potential of these deepwater Black Sea blocks,” said
Tim Cejka, president of ExxonMobil E&P. “We look forward to
bringing our global deepwater experience to this prospective unexplored area.”
Mehmet Uysal, TPAO president and chief executive officer, said
the two companies “have all the tools required” to evaluate and develop a discovery and plan an “aggressive” exploration program.
ExxonMobil affiliates or predecessor companies have been operating in Turkey for more than 100 years. It has a lubes blending
plant in Istanbul as well as finished lubricants, aviation fuels, and
marine fuels sales throughout the country.

Yousefieh-1, 3 km from Khurbet East production facilities, cut
63 m of net oil pay in the target Cretaceous formations and flowed
900 b/d without treatment from the shallowest 19-m interval. Porosity averaged 18.6%. TD is 2,139 m.
While preparing for the natural flow test, the well flowed at

reservoir was cored.
A smaller workover rig may be brought in to run further tests.
The companies, which identified the new play on 2007 3D seismic, plan to shoot more 3D to identify other prospects and leads
nearby.
Meanwhile, cumulative production has exceeded 1 million bbl

total measured depth of 9,735 ft.
“Although the well will not be flow-tested, an extensive pressure test measurement program and the collection of oil samples
through a modular formation tester logging tool, suggest good
reservoir mobility and therefore promising productive potential,”
Sterling said.
David Findlater, Sterling’s vice-president for exploration, said,
“This wildcat well has met all expectations and confirmed the presence of a hydrocarbon bearing stratigraphic trap. Our immediate
plan is to integrate the well results with the seismic data and to
determine the size of the oil accumulation before submitting our

Fort Hills Energy defers oil sands project decision
Officials of Fort Hills Energy LP said they will defer until 2009
a final investment decision on a bitumen upgrader and will focus
instead on developing the mine and bitumen production facilities
of that integrated oil sands project near Fort McMurray, Alta.
A decision will be made later whether to proceed with an upgrader to be located 300 miles south in Sturgeon County east of
Edmonton.
“We’re giving ourselves some breathing room on the project
schedule, so we can take advantage of a softening market to reduce
costs,” said Ron A. Brenneman, president and chief executive officer of Petro-Canada. “Given cost pressures, lower crude oil prices,
and uncertainty in the financial markets, it’s important to scale our
efforts to focus on the mine first.”
The partnership will use the extra time to evaluate cost reductions, efficiencies, and the overall project schedule. It remains com-

AGL starts work on salt-dome gas storage cavern
AGL Resources’ Golden Triangle Storage has started construction of a 12-bcf working gas capacity salt dome natural gas storage
facility at Spindletop in Beaumont, Tex.
About 7.5 miles of dual 24-in. OD pipelines and 1.5 miles of
single 24-in. line will connect the facility to six interstate and intrastate transmission pipelines: Florida Gas Transmission (downstream of Station 6), Texas Eastern Transmission, Centana Pipeline,
Energy Tranfer Co.’s Texoma line, Kinder Morgan Texas, and ExxonMobil’s Golden Pass Pipeline. The storage site will be able to receive
onshore, offshore, and LNG deliveries.
The project will offer 600 MMcfd of deliverable capacity and
300 MMcfd of injection capacity, serving local petrochemical facilities and the Houston Ship Channel through the intrastate pipelines
as well as markets in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Southeast via
the interstate lines.
Golden Triangle says the first storage cavern will be ready for
operation in 2010 or early 2011, with the second cavern following
roughly 2 years later. Capacity can be expanded to as much as 28
bcf. The company expects a third 6-bcf cavern to be added shortly
after completion of the second. Five brine-disposal caverns are also
being drilled on Golden Triangle’s site.

Shanghai receives ﬁrst spot cargo of Petronas LNG

Group, has received its first spot cargo of LNG from Malaysia’s Petronas.
SGG said a 20,000 cu m LNG carrier from Malaysia arrived at
Shanghai’s 120,000 cu m capacity Wuhaogou terminal Nov. 15.
The terminal, the smaller of the two LNG terminals being developed in Shanghai, receives only spot cargoes.
In October, Shenergy Group completed construction of two
50,000 cu m LNG steel storage tanks at the Wuhaogou terminal after 2 years of construction. The tanks were scheduled to
start receiving LNG supplies from Malaysia beginning in midNovember.
Petronas subsidiary Malaysia LNG Tiga Sdn. Bhd. is scheduled
to supply Shanghai’s other regasification facility, which is comprised of three 165,000 cu m LNG storage tanks. It is a joint
venture project of Shenergy Group and China National Offshore
Oil Corp.
The Malaysian firm will begin LNG deliveries in February 2009
under a 25-year contract. First-phase receiving capacity will be 3
million tonnes/year building to 3.03 million tonnes/year of LNG
in 2012. The terminal will enter a trial run in April and will come
online in July.
The Chinese joint venture company also aims to construct an
additional 3 million tonnes of LNG receiving capacity for its second phase by 2015, depending on the future gas market. ✦

Is CP worthless?
What kind of question is this?
Most in the pipeline industry
agree that cathodic protection
(CP) is the smart way to provide
backup corrosion protection on
underground pipelines.
But consider: If you use solid film
backed corrosion coatings, you may
be wasting money by adding CP to
the pipeline.
There is a common sense reason for
this statement. CP systems protect
pipelines by delivering electrical
current to the steel surface. Solid
film back corrosion coatings have
the property of resistivity, which
means they block electrical current.
This blocking effect is called
cathodic shielding.
The phenomenon of cathodic
shielding, or blocking of protective
CP current, has been the subject of
dozens of technical papers since the
mid 1980’s. You can review a cross
section of these papers on
Polyguard’s website.You can also

Phone: (1) 214.515.5000
www.polyguardproducts.com

view a 10 minute explanation of the
cathodic shielding process.
Worldwide, we estimate that over
half of pipelines are being coated
with solid film back coatings, such as
shrink sleeves, tapes, and 2 or 3 layer
systems. Most of these lines have CP
systems. These are the operators who
may be wasting their money on CP.
Moreover, many install shielding
coatings on girth welds, the most
vulnerable area for corrosion.
Two corrosion coatings are proven
to be non-shielding, and allow
passage of protective CP currents.
One of these coatings is FBE. The
other is Polyguard RD-6.
NACE SP0169-2007 states: “Materials
… that create electrical shielding
should not be used on the pipeline” 1.
49 CFR §192.461 states:
“External protective coating …must
…have properties compatible with any
supplemental cathodic protection.” 2

If you are concerned that your
organization is behind this curve, we
recommend:
1. Visit
polyguardproducts.com/failsafecoating.htm
and review the large body of information
about shielding problems.
2. Talk to operators who have used
Polyguard’s RD-6 system. (There are
many) Ask them if they know of any
serious corrosion or SCC ever found
under RD-6. (We don’t, even after 19
years and thousands of installations).
3. Have someone in your organization attend
the NACE course “Coatings in Conjunction
with Cathodic Protection”.

1. NACE SP0169-2007 “Control of External
Corrosion on Underground or Submergeed
Metallic Piping Systems”.

A chance to play offense
The US oil and gas industry will enter 2009
needing to play hard political defense. With
Democrats in charge of both Congress and the
White House and the public largely unhinged
about energy, the industry will fall under assault
on many fronts, including taxation and access to
federal land. Opportunities to take the offense will
be rare. The industry must take advantage of every
one that arises.
An offensive move the industry can seize now
relates to energy independence. The industry
should start an immediate campaign to repudiate this chimera, which has seduced the US into
too many mistakes already and promises to open
an entire catalog of horrors next year. Before the
damage gets any worse, the US public must know

that only spreads a new burden over all taxpayers.
Either way, the practice is wasteful. If undertaken
massively while the economy is imploding, it
could be ruinous.
The blind pursuit of energy independence is
wasteful, too, because it diverts money the government needs for other activities into nonproductive uses. And it would not, as popularly argued,
boost employment. Jobs created by government
handouts to “green” energy would be more than
offset by jobs lost in parts of the economy forced
to absorb the new cost.
For the US economy, futility and waste, bad
as they are, don’t represent the biggest problems
associated with America’s lunge for energy independence. The goal’s evident popularity bespeaks
a xenophobic tendency that policy-makers should
find alarming. Prosperity, American no less or

The launch in 2007 of an elaborate
gasoline rationing system by Iranian
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s cabinet to help stem that country’s gasoline
consumption was initially met with both
skepticism and discontent. However,
the system, which was subsequently
extended into 2008, has helped the
country reduce its gasoline consumption
dramatically, according to a report released in
August
by FACTS
Global
Energy
(FGE),
Honolulu.
Although Iran has faced difficulties
in its struggle to supplement its vehicle
fuel base with alternatives such as compressed natural gas (CNG), FGE said, “It
is expected that after the completion of
current projects for the upgrading and
expansion of existing refineries, Iran
will be able to become a net [gasoline]
exporter in 2012-13.”

Iran’s rationing system working
to control gasoline consumption

Gasoline imports
Although one of the world’s largest oil producers, Iran imports roughly
40% of its gasoline due to limited
refining capacity as well as rapidly
rising domestic demand. The Iranian
government also has heavily subsidized
the fuel, selling it domestically at about
one fifth of real cost. Since late March,
according to FGE’s August report,
Iran’s gasoline consumption stood at
396,000-409,000 b/d, while gasoline
imports averaged 94,000-107,000 b/d
during the same period.

FGE reported that even with the rationing system in effect, Iranian officials
have stated that providing gasoline price
subsidies is not sustainable in the long
run. However, FGE noted that the issue
of raising gasoline prices “remains politically sensitive and unpopular.”
Before the start of the rationing system, FGE said, Iran’s gasoline imports
were estimated at 223,000 b/d.
“Despite the turbulence throughout
Iran in its first few days of implementation, rationing did have a major impact
on gasoline consumption and imports,”
FGE said, adding, “Imports dropped
from an average of 204,000 b/d in May
2007 to an average of 94,000 b/d for
the rest of that year,” FGE said.

New rationing system
FGE said the Iranian government’s
current approach to the gasoline crisis
seems targeted at phasing out the quota
system and eventually abolishing the
rationing system.
“Selling gasoline in the free market is how Iran is introducing higher
prices within the country. Currently,
Iran is selling premium gasoline in the
free market at [prices] about five times
higher than the previous regulated
prices,” FGE said. Gasoline sales in the
free market have been reported to be at
an average of 4,400-6,300 b/d.
The Iranian government intends to
cut subsidies for gasoline in a “step-bystep approach by 2011 and eventually
eliminate it,” FGE said.
Although the original rationing
system was extended from 2007 into
2008, the government later amended
the quotas. Beginning June 21, FGE
said, the Iranian government revised the
quotas “to further control consumption
and reduce the subsidies paid out for
gasoline imports.” Table 1 highlights
the rationing system in 2007-08.
FGE said the new rationing system,
which is expected to be extended until
March 2009, specifies the following:
• All premium gasoline is now
outside the quota and not qualified for
subsidized fuel.
• All regular gasoline of foreign cars

Reﬁnery expansions
FGE forecasts that Iran should have

despite “some hiccups” in plans to
expand and upgrade current refineries
and construct new facilities. However
the following plans, FGE said, must be
completed:

by 4,500 b/d, is expected to be completed in 2012.

Chegalesh, Petrolinvest, and Iran’s Radira
are working to upgrade and expand the
Tehran refinery. The project is expected
to be completed in 2010, adding 11,200
b/d to total gasoline production.
• Bandar Abbas condensate splitters (Persian
Gulf Star condensate splitters). Design of the
Bandar Abbas condensate splitters is
based on a 63% gasoline and 25% gas
oil yield. This project would be the
most important project for increasing
gasoline production in Iran.
FGE said, however, this project is
faced with several challenges, such as
the withdrawal of Snamprogetti SPA as
engineering, procurement, and construction contractor (perhaps due to
US pressure) and the lack of financial
resources.
“So far nothing has been done for this
project, and it is unlikely to be completed before 2013 or later,” FGE said.
“It should be noted that even without the splitters, Iran will be a gasoline
exporter,” FGE said, adding that total
upgrades to Iran’s refineries will add at
least 94,000-119,000 b/d of gasoline
to the market, which would be more
than the demand growth, projected
to be 70,000-100,000 b/d during
2008-13. ✦

Emboldened Somali pirates
hijack Saudi Aramco tanker
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
In a clear sign of their determination to escalate attacks on international
oil shipping, Somali pirates operating
on the high seas southeast of Mombassa, Kenya, Nov. 15, have hijacked the
Liberian-flagged Sirius Star, a very large

crude carrier owned by Saudi Aramco
and operated by Vela International.
The attack coincided with a second
hijacking the same day as well as the
release of a ship taken earlier this year.
Lt. Nathan Christensen, a spokesman
for the US Navy’s 5th Fleet, which oversees the region, said the pirates hijacked
the Sirius Star about 450 nautical miles

comforting news from the election
of Barack Obama as US president, it
may need a rethink—especially when
it comes to the al-Qaeda terrorist
organization.
In fact, al-Qaeda No. 2 leader
Ayman Zawahiri ridiculed Obama
last week and warned him against
sending more troops to Afghanistan.
Worse, using racist language, Zawahiri even insulted Obama and other
African American leaders.
“It is true about you and people
like you…what Malcolm X said about

naming former Sec. of State Colin
Powell and the current secretary,
Condoleezza Rice.
Zawahiri’s remarks followed an interview given by Obama in which he
vowed no retreat from his campaign

to Afghanistan.
But what certainly raised Zawahiri’s dander was Obama’s statement
of plans to renew the US commitment to tracking down the al-Qaeda
leader, Osama bin Laden.

on a plan to draw down US troops in
Iraq and increase the number of US
troops in Afghanistan.
Capturing or killing the al-Qaeda
leader will no doubt be a significant step forward in the worldwide
war on terrorism, and it may well
represent an equally significant step
forward for the oil and gas industry—long a key al-Qaeda target.

The ‘arc of instability’

But, as a leading intelligence
analyst has warned, the future will
not be fully secured even with bin
Laden’s capture or death. Indeed,
according to Thomas Fingar, deputy
director of national intelligence, the
appeal of al-Qaeda-like terrorism is
waning in the greater Middle East.
That may sound like the good
news, but according to Fingar it does
not mean that the greater Middle
East—which extends from North
Africa to Central Asia—is going to
see peace any time soon.
To the contrary, the greater Middle
East will still be “at the center of an

off Kenya—the farthest out to sea that
pirates have ever struck. That distance,
according to Christensen, makes them
“a threat to many more vessels.”
According to Christensen, the attack
shows that the pirates are “changing
the way they’re doing business” in the
region. Normally they attack within
200 miles of the shoreline and go after
smaller prey.
“What this represents is a fundamental ability of pirates to be able to operate
off the coast to an extent we have not
seen before,” said Christensen. “It’s the
largest ship we’ve seen attacked.”

Pirates adapt
To a certain extent, the attack off Kenya is the result of antipiracy activities
of Coalition naval forces off Somalia, according to naval officials.
“Our presence in the region is helping deter and disrupt criminal attacks
off the Somali coast, but the situation
with the Sirius Star clearly indicates
the pirates’ ability to adapt their tactics
and methods of attack,” Vice Adm. Bill
Gortney, commander of the Combined
Maritime Forces.
Graeme Gibbon Brooks, managing director of British company Dryad
Maritime Intelligence Service Ltd, said
the increased international presence
trying to prevent attacks is simply not
enough.
“The coalition has suppressed a
number of attacks—but there will never
be enough warships,” Brooks said, adding that coalition warships will have
to be “one step ahead of the pirates.
The difficulty here is that the ship was
beyond the area where the Coalition
[forces] were currently acting.”
Naval officials themselves underscored the difficulty of patrolling the
region’s waters.
“To put the challenge into geographic perspective, the area involved
off the coast of Somalia and Kenya as
well as the Gulf of Aden equals more
than 1.1 million sq miles. That is
roughly four times the size of the US
state of Texas or the size of the Medi-

Turkey pipeline blast rekindles security concerns
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Oil has resumed flowing through
one of the twin Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipelines following an explosion on one of
the lines near the town of Bozova, in
the mainly Kurdish province of Sanliurfa in southeastern Turkey.
The announcement, which came
just as European energy officials were
in the country discussing plans for the
proposed Nabucco gas pipeline, made
no mention of foul play.
“There is currently oil flowing through the pipeline at about
300,000-350,000 b/d,” said an official
of pipeline operator Botas. “We had to
cut the flow after the explosion, but
then diverted the oil to the other line,

so it is flowing again,” he said.
“We expect that the repair won’t take
more than 3 days, it depends also on
the availability of pipe for the line,” the
Botas official said.

Sabotage downplayed
Iraq’s northern crude oil export
system, which runs from the northern
Kirkuk oil fields to the Turkish Mediterranean export terminal at Ceyhan,
is comprised of two parallel pipelines
with a nominal capacity of 1.5 million
b/d.
Since the US-led war of 2003, the
line has been running at a reduced
capacity due to attacks by insurgents as
well as erratic production from Iraq’s
northern oil fields.
In September, the privately-owned

Sbay media website cited an official
from Iraq’s North Oil Co. who said the
Kirkuk-Ceyhan line had been attacked
by armed men near Mosul and that exports would be suspended for 3 days.
In this week’s shutdown, Turkish
officials downplayed the possibility of
sabotage.
“Valves on the double line were
closed on Nov. 5 when Botas officials
noticed a sharp change in pressure
resulting from the explosion. The cause
of the blast has yet to be determined,”
the official said.
Earlier, local officials in the province
of Sanliurfa said the explosion had
resulted from high pressure within the
pipeline and not from sabotage.
“Thank goodness it’s not sabotage,”
said Sanliurfa governor Yusuf Yavas-

“It’s perfectly possible to exploit

this week telling the Estado news
agency that the ongoing global financial
crisis will not cause delays to the development of the subsalt oil reserves.
“The subsalt layer will not suffer any
delays,” said Lobao, who earlier in the
week had said, “We are not going to
stop spending” and that, “All these investments will be fully accomplished.”
Estimates vary on development costs
for Brazil’s subsalt oil and gas reserves,
with one Brazilian official saying up to
$400 billion in investment could be
required over the next 10 years.
Haroldo Lima, director of Brazil’s
hydrocarbons regulator Agencia Nacional do Petroleo (ANP), also said that
his $400 billion estimate was not very
precise and that subsalt reserves should
be at least 50 billion bbl of oil, possibly
reaching 80 billion bbl.
Estimates of the subsalt layer’s reserves also have varied among Brazilian
officials.

Demuring on estimates
On Nov. 13, Petrobras said it was
premature to speculate on the size of
the subsalt oil reserves, a statement that
came just a day after Lobao told analysts
and investors at a luncheon in New
York that the subsalt reserves could hold
“50-150 billion bbl of oil of the finest
kind.”
At the time, Lobao observed that
estimated recoverable reserves of 12 billion boe had been confirmed so far, but
that, on the basis of reports by analysts
and experts, “a much larger number
would not surprise us.”
Petrobras responded that estimates of
reserves are possible only after declarations of commerciality. Refuting Lobao,
the Brazilian firm said, “In light of the
articles published in the press about
estimates in the subsalt, Petrobras reaffirms the figures it has already given.”
Petrobras and its partners have announced discoveries estimated at 8-12
billion boe at the Tupi and Iara prospects in the Santos basin in the past
year, while several other new subsalt
prospects are said to have potentially
large reserves.

Bodman: Caspian remains vital
to global energy security
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
US Secretary of Energy Samuel W.
Bodman, recalling the recent conflict
between Russia and Georgia, reaffirmed
the need for Europe to diversify its
sources of energy and stressed the role
of the Caspian region in promoting
energy security.
“The Russia-Georgia conflict underscored how important it is for Europe
to diversify sources of energy supply,”
Bodman told delegates at the Baku Energy Summit.
“The good news is that the pipelines operating on Georgian territory
through what is emerging as the Southern Corridor were not affected by the
brief war in Georgia,” Bodman said.
Further Bodman said these southern

corridor routes “will enable the transport of competitively priced Caspian
energy resources to European and
world markets, thereby furthering global energy security,” adding, “It is our
hope that this will bring willing sellers
and potential new buyers together.”
Bodman called the summit the latest
in a series of beneficial outcomes that
began with the 1994 signing of the
“Contract of the Century,” which began
movement of Azerbaijani oil resources
to the global market.
Bodman said that contract was the
first step “toward the development, processing and deployment of this region’s
vast energy resources in successful ways
to the benefit of producers and consumers alike.”
Stating that the Caspian region “will
be a priority for the next administra-

tion,” Bodman said, adding that oil
production from the Caspian states is
already a significant source of supply to
world markets outside of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
“We expect it to continue to play a
vital role as oil production continues to
increase over the next decade,” he said.
Bodman said the US has been working with Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey for 15 years to ensure that Caspian
oil and gas can reach European and
global markets through commercially
viable and secure export routes.
“We are now building on the success
of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan [oil pipeline] and South Caucasus gas pipelines
to develop a new generation of export
routes known as the Southern Corridor,” he said.

“The US is committed to working
with Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, Turkey, and our European partners
to realize the Turkey-Greece-Italy and
Nabucco pipelines that will form the
foundation of the Southern Corridor,”
he said.
However, he noted, “It remains crucial that gas producers and consumers
put in place the framework agreements
required to ensure these projects will be
commercially viable.”
“If we continue to promote a strong
investment climate—including transparency and the rule of law—we can
look forward to additional energy projects that will bring great benefits to the
citizens and economies of this region
and, as a result, the entire world,” Bodman said. ✦

The new oil shale leasing regulations were delayed when members

on the PEIS on Nov. 17. The agency also
has issued research, development, and
demonstration leases for five oil shale
leases in Colorado’s Piceance basin and
one in Utah.
Allred said the regulations are
necessary to accommodate such commitments, which involve proprietary
technologies. “The companies involved
are going to spend hundreds of millions

of dollars. They, as well as the general
public, need rules of the road to make
sure the development occurs properly.
[The rules] bring certainty not only to
those companies that are going to invest
the money but also to those who want
to make sure there’s due diligence and
that environmental impacts are fully
considered,” he said.

Other companies are working on
privately-held land, but the DOI official said he is not aware of the extent
of their efforts. Leasing could proceed
if a state supported it, but that would
depend on technologies that were developed, and projects would still have to
fully comply with NEPA and other applicable federal, state, and local requirements, he said. ✦

Slump’s varied effects present mixed opportunities
The varying effects of economic
troubles on exporting countries and
national oil companies present a mixed
slate of opportunities to international
oil companies with cash to invest.
Lew Watts, chief executive officer
of PFC Energy, told the RMI Oilfield
Breakfast Forum in Houston Nov. 12
that most Persian Gulf members of the

Countries can weather the slump in the
price of crude oil.
National “break-even” West Texas
Intermediate crude prices in 2010 are
$54.26/bbl in Saudi Arabia, $52.07/
bbl in Kuwait, and $45.59/bbl in the
UAE, Watts estimated.
By contrast, in Venezuela, where the
government has spent heavily on social
and international projects and subsidizes domestic oil products, the break-even
crude price in 2010 is $102.68/bbl. In
Iran, another high-subsidy country, it’s
$83.31/bbl.
The financial crisis contributing to
the oil price slump has mixed effects.

Cazalot: US at risk of losing energy security race
Judy R. Clark
Senior Associate Editor
The US is running the risk of losing
the global race for energy, said Marathon Oil Corp. Chief Executive Officer
Clarence Cazalot at a recent American
Petroleum Institute meeting in Houston.
Cazalot said it is crucial that US
government officials and the public be
educated to the energy challenges facing the nation and its energy providers,
along with the most effective solutions,
because some proposed governmental
policies could result in unintended consequences that exacerbate the situation
rather than remedy it.
“‘Energy security’ isn’t just some
glib phrase” that is used by the energy
industry, Cazalot said. “It’s what our
work is all about. Few industries have
contributed more to the well-being of
the world than ours.”
But increasing global energy demand, driven by explosive population growth and rapidly developing
economies, is intensifying competition
for energy worldwide. “The 6.5 billion people today will be 8 billion by
2030,” he said. And although today’s
difficult global economic situation is
impacting demand, “the fundamentals
haven’t changed, and this is really just
a temporary phenomena. The prognosticators say 2009-10 will be a time of
economic downturn, but we need to
stay the course because we are already
seeing, in our service stations, demand
coming back.”
Meeting demand will require a substantial increase in all forms of energy,
he said, to ensure security of supply,
while guarding the environment and
maintaining economic competitiveness.
“Not letting [the US] standard of living
slip will take a strategy fully consistent
with the climate change plan,” Cazalot
insisted.
What is needed, he said, is “a ratio30

nal, fact-based approach that taps the
leadership and finest thinking of people
across the entire spectrum” to solve the
energy problem.
“President-elect [Barack] Obama
and all of us must join together to find
solutions to the global challenges,” he
urged. “It doesn’t matter what your
ideology or political affiliation is; the
time is now to tackle our energy issues together. If we fail to do so now,
America is at the very real risk of losing
the global race for energy.”

Competition for energy
The US Energy Information Administration projects energy demand
will increase more than 50% during
2005-30, with 70% of that from developing countries relying primarily on
fossil fuels.
The demand growth is not unconstrained. In making the projections, EIA
built in efficiency improvements and a
reduction in energy intensity.
Meeting this demand will require
a substantial increase in all forms of
energy.
Fossil fuels comprise 80% of global
usage and will continue to do so until
2030, Cazalot said, mainly because of
the infrastructure advantage. Of that
supply, oil and gas are 55%, and coal is
25%.
All other forms of energy such as
nuclear power, biofuels, hydroelectric
power, geothermal, and wind, represent
the remaining 20% of global energy
consumption.
Coal and gas consumption are growing the fastest, driven by rising demand
for electricity. Coal demand rose by
35% during 2000-06. “China builds
two new coal-fired 500-Mw power
plants every 7-10 days,” Cazalot said.

Energy security strategy
Cazalot outlined a three-pronged
strategy for addressing the energy challenge:

• Initiating energy efficiency and
conservation.
• Developing supply diversity.
• Investing in technology to ensure
environmental protection and sustainability.
Energy security does not mean
energy independence, “which is neither
possible nor desirable,” he said. “Calling
for energy independence creates uncertainty in our global trading partners
around the world and hinders both
their investment and ours.”
He defined energy security as “having an adequate, reliable, and sustainable supply of energy to meet the needs
and aspirations of private citizens, commercial enterprises, and public sector
functions while ensuring environmental
protection and sustainability.
“Secondly the cost of our energy
must be comparable to that of other nations, so we can maintain our economic
competitiveness, growth, and stability,”
he said.

Conservation
Energy efficiency and conservation
are the quickest and cheapest forms of
demand reduction, Cazalot said. “A 6%
reduction in energy use over all [of the]
petroleum base, would reduce US crude
oil imports by 29%.” Efficiencies should
focus on key areas such as improving
fuel economy, reducing energy consumption in residential and commercial
venues by applying new building codes
and appliance standards, and increasing
efficiency of the industrial sector.
He said US oil and gas firms are
making solid progress toward a pledge
made in 2002 to the government to
improve energy efficiency by 10% over
10 years.
In 2006 alone, US refineries saved
the energy equivalent of taking
528,000 vehicles off the road. Marathon estimates that “over the last 5 years
our seven refineries have improved

Japan ‘unlikely’ to buy on LNG spot market this winter
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Japan is unlikely to purchase further
cargoes of LNG on the spot market this
winter, according to Akio Nomura,
chairman of Osaka Gas Co. Ltd. and the
Japan Gas Association.
“I do not foresee further spot purchases unless the electricity market
experiences dramatic changes,” Nomura
told reporters on the sidelines of the Gas
Information Exchange for the Western Pacific (GASEX) 2008 conference in Hanoi.
Nomura added that such a change
might be something like a nuclear plant
outage, but otherwise, in the longer
term, Japan’s demand for gas is likely
to fall given the impact of the financial
crisis on the economy.
“We have not yet seen the direct
impact from the crisis as well as wide
variations in oil prices and LNG prices,”
he said. “However, although we have
not yet seen the impact, over the long
term we will see it.”

He said investment decisions in Nigeria were difficult with OPEC production cuts and low oil prices. “For us in

SandRidge Energy Inc., Oklahoma
City, expects to be operating 20 rigs in
the West Texas Overthrust by the end
of 2008, down from 27 rigs in early
November and a third quarter average
of 34.
The company has halved its planned
2009 capital budget from the $2 billion
previously anticipated. It is also selling
its East Texas assets.
SandRidge continues to exploit and
expand Pinon field
using 3D seismic and
well control to identify
new reservoirs in the
three primary thrusts:
Dugout Creek, Warwick, and Frog Creek. More than 600
wells have been drilled at Pinon since
the 1980s.
The company still doesn’t know how
large Pinon field will become.

West Texas Overthrust
outlook expands with 3D

WTO thrusts
Pinon and other fields associated
with the thrusts are spread across Pecos
and Terrell counties 20 miles north of
Sanderson, Tex. (Figs. 1 and 2).
SandRidge holds more than 650,000
net acres in the area and has acquired

virtually all of the leases in the WTO.
The 5.1 tcf of net proved, possible,
and probable reserves identified in the
72,000-acre Pinon field are almost
exclusively in the Dugout Creek and
Warwick thrusts.
The Frog Creek thrust is the most
recent of the three thrusts discovered
in the Pinon field to have commercial
production, SandRidge said. SandRidge
hasn’t booked reserves from Frog Creek
and hasn’t yet drilled the Haymond
thrust.
The Frog Creek thrust provides
drilling opportunities in the Caballos
chert at 3,500-5,500 ft. The thrust as
interpreted from 3D data appears to be
similar in size to the Dugout Creek and
Warwick thrusts.
“We have started to drill wells targeting specifically the Frog Creek Caballos
and have very encouraging results,”
SandRidge said. “We are in the process
of mapping this thrust with geological
information from the few penetrations
we have and tying into 3D seismic data
to high-grade locations as we prepare
to drill more Frog Creek Caballos wells
in 2009.”
Recent production tests from Frog
Creek analyzed methane with less than

The World Onshore Pipelines Report 2008-2012

This new report examines the current and future prospects,
technologies and markets for the Liqueﬁed Natural Gas
sector. Gas currently accounts for nearly a quarter of all
energy consumption, and the IEA have forecast that gas
demand will grow at a faster rate than oil over the ﬁrst
quarter of this century. With many regions facing future gas
shortages, LNG offers an increasingly important method of
bringing gas from remote reserves to the market.

This report presents a comprehensive view of the historic market from 2003-2007 and forecast period from
2008-2012. The report also reviews all aspects of onshore
oil & gas pipelines from design, materials, techniques and
components through to construction, operations and maintenance and transportation. Geared to the needs of the
senior executive and assumes no previous reader knowledge of the subject area.

New wireless sensor network monitors

Abu Dhabi Marine and Operating
Co. (ADMA-OPCO) has embarked on a
project with vMonitor to deploy a new
generation wireless-sensor-network
technology for monitoring continu-

ously injection well surface pressure
and flow rates.
These sensors, installed on each
water-injection wellhead, are demonstrating substantial well operation and
reservoir management benefits.
Water injection is common in many
oil fields worldwide. The injected water
can have two functions for improving
recovery from oil reservoirs:
1. Maintain reservoir pressure, allowing longer natural flow from wells.
2. Displace oil in the reservoir and
push oil towards producing wells.
Managing water injection, however,
is important to ensure that the reservoir

is not damaged. If unclean water enters
the reservoir, particles can bridge off
in the reservoir impairing injectivity
and causing increased injection pressures. These pressures can fracture the
reservoir, allowing injected water to
enter unwanted zones. Or, if wells are
offline, it can alter the sweep pattern of
fluid flow and push oil in the wrong
direction.
Successful injection management
can provide 15-25% more oil recovery
from the reservoir, providing the operator with much economic value.
Keys to successfully managing the
injection include:
• Knowing when injection is shutdown (downtime tracking).
• Measuring the injection rate in
each well.
• Monitoring (increasing) injection
pressure.
• Immediate notifying when pressures are high enough to cause fracturing.
• Knowing when pressures drop
below normal pressures (may indicate
a leak).

ADMA operations

Lower Zakum field off Abu Dhabi has more than 110 water-injection wells on about 26 platforms (Fig.

Today operators do not monitor
continuously most water-injection
wells. Monitoring requires wellhead
instrumentation and remote connectivity to the office so that production and
reservoir engineers can evaluate data
continuously.
ADMA’s operations are entirely
offshore. The company has more than
110 water-injection wells on about 26
platforms in Lower Zakum field (Fig.

chart recorders (Fig. 2). To collect and
replace the charts and forward them
to headquarters, operations personnel
make weekly helicopter trips. This operational process has several problems.
Weekly trips to about 26 platforms
with helicopters are complex and
expensive logistically. Also, data from
these chart recorders require manual
input before production and reservoir
engineers can evaluate the data.
As a result, the current system has
many limitations:
• Data are error prone because of
manual evaluation of charts associated
with manual data entry.
• Real-time data are unavailable to
petroleum and reservoir engineers. This
time delay can cause major well and
reservoir problems.
• Operating expenses for monitoring and maintaining wells and collecting data are high.

Such systems are bulky for installation on platforms with limited topsides
space. Also laying new cables on existing offshore platforms to connect the
various sensors and instruments is complex and expensive.
Another cost prohibitive and timeconsuming factor for installing SCADA
is the running of subsea cables to facilitate data transmission between various
platforms.
Providing power for a SCADA
monitoring system on remote platforms is also problematic. Solar panels
can provide power but require constant
cleaning of bird excrement.

Fig. 3 shows the system architecture.
These new generation wireless sensors (Fig. 4) have the advantages of:
• Long range (up to 10 km) communication, even when running on
battery power. This allows the units
to transmit data from the wells to a
central gateway on a platform several
kilometers away, where in turn another
installed long-range radio transmits the
data back to the main platform.
• High accuracy compared to
mechanical chart recorders. The data
measured and benchmarked against
high-accuracy instruments (for pressure
and flow) showed that these wireless
sensors have more accuracy than conventional equipment, in many cases.
• The system demonstrated high degree or data transmission reliability and
availability, even during adverse weather
conditions.

Data reliability, accuracy
Main criteria for any system performance are data reliability and accuracy.
A wireless sensor network involves
relatively new technology. For this new
technology to replace existing mechanical chart recorders, the system must
demonstrate that it can deliver highly
accurate measurements.
Before installation of the system, a
benchmarking effort tested and validated the system’s reliability and accuracy.
The validation monitored measurements during 3 months. During that
period, operations personnel collected
data manually from mechanical chart

cause refiners to invest in
more desulfurization and
conversion capacity. In the past, refiners
have traditionally used the unregulated

as a way to dispose of
bottom-of-the-barrel
streams high in sulfur.
This article reviews the
current and future regulations for bunker fuel and
the effect they will have
on the global refining industry.

have had a good record of success. Now,
however, the principal focus of new
marine regulations is for air quality.
MARPOL Annex VI governs air pollution aspects of marine shipping. The
original Annex VI introduced global
bunker fuel sulfur limits at 4.5%.
MARPOL’s Annex VI Amendments
were adopted by the IMO’s Marine
Environment Protection Committee
(MEPC) in April 2008 and ratified at
the MEPC 58 meeting in October 2008.
The Annex VI Amendments represent a
step forward in controlling air pollution from marine sources. National
legislation of maritime governments
is needed to implement the Annex VI
Amendments.

Bunker fuel

Controlling sulfur is a key feature
of the Annex VI amendments. Annex VI
Amendments incorporate two features
of bunker-fuel sulfur control.
First, Annex VI Amendments call for
Emissions Control Areas (ECAs). The
ECA feature can apply to either SOx or
NOx. Thus far, ECAs have been designated only for SOx. The current SOx ECAs
are the Baltic Sea Area and the North
Sea-English Channel area.
The US, a signatory of MARPOL
and Annex VI, proposes an SOx ECA
for California, the Pacific Coast, and
possibly other areas. Considerable work
is required to fulfill all the IMO’s data
requirements for the ECA program. The
US Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) and the California Air Resources
Board (CARB) are taking the lead in that
process.
Until 2010, SOx emissions within
the ECAs are limited to the level that
would come from burning fuel at 1.5%
sulfur. After 2010, the limit is 1.0% sulfur, until 2015 when the required level
becomes 0.1% sulfur.
Annex VI Amendments provide for
alternative means of meeting sulfur
emissions requirements. Effective
emissions scrubbing technology may
allow shippers to use bunker fuels with
higher sulfur levels.
The basic technology takes advantage

New regs require lower

Marine bunker fuel comprises only
about 5% or less of total global petroleum consumption. The product, however, has been an important outlet for
difficult-to-handle, high sulfur residues
as well as other undesirable streams
such as slurry oils, low-quality distillates, and others.
Historically, bunker fuel quality
was lightly regulated. The IMO historically did not regulate bunker fuel for
emissions; instead regulations were to
ensure ship and crew safety and operability of the ship’s engines.
Regulation of marine fuel quality
for environmental reasons is currently
being adopted.
Since the 1970s, the IMO has
controlled and sought to reduce the environmental impact from international
shipping. The overall program comes
under the International Convention on
the Reduction of Pollution from Ships
(MARPOL). That treaty has been in
force for decades and has been effective
in reducing waterborne pollution arising from oily water wastes, bilge-water
disposal, tank-cleaning emissions, and
others.
MARPOL has progressed despite the
fact that the principal goal of shipping
regulation has been safety. Measures
intended to avoid disastrous accidents

of naturally occurring calcium carbonate dissolved in seawater to remove
SOx emissions. As part of the scrubbing
process, soot, unburned fuel, and other
particulates such as fuel-derived metals
are also recovered in a waste material
that can be disposed of onshore.
Formal approval of scrubbing technology has not occurred and ultimately
may depend on approval of the maritime states’ environmental and marine
safety regulators.
Outside the ECAs, sulfur in bunker
fuel is more tightly controlled than in
the past.
The figure shows that the current
limit is 4.5% globally. This will fall to
3.5% by 2012 and then to 0.5% in
either 2020 or 2025. By 2018, a feasibility review will determine whether
sufficient low-sulfur fuel will be available by 2020. If that review finds that
insufficient fuel will be available, then
the compliance data can be delayed to
2025.
Annex VI Amendments also call for
the control of NOx (see table). NOx
controls apply to large marine engines
with power output of as little as 130
kw, about 175.
Unlike SOx, marine NOx emissions
are only partly a function of fuel quality. Although bound nitrogen in fuel
contributes to NOx, emissions originate
also with atmospheric nitrogen. Controlling NOx emissions is more obviously related to the combustion process
than SOx emissions and the engines are
the focus of NOx emissions standards.
MARPOL Annex VI Amendment program anticipates new standards for ship
efficiency and CO2 emissions. Thus far,
however, those efficiency standards have
not been set. Several possible formats of
greenhouse gas regulation and compliance are possible.
Regulating engine efficiency may
seem like an obvious step. Opportunities for reducing maritime CO2 emissions, however, go far beyond engine
efficiency. Considerable CO2 gains are
possible with improvements in hull
form, propeller design, hull and propeller coatings, vessel routing and speed

optimization, and engine exhaust-heat
recovery. Notwithstanding a lack of
greenhouse gas regulation currently,
ship operators have experienced a
powerful incentive to minimize fuel
consumption due to high prices alone.
In the US, bunker fuel regulation is
moving as fast as it is internationally.
The US is a signatory to the MARPOL
treaty and in 2008 ratified Annex VI.
Regulation is moving forward on
parallel state and federal paths. CARB
adopted a new marine engine emissions regulation. That regulation would
govern emissions in the offshore airshed areas of the South Coast air basin.
Within 24 miles of the coast, ships are
forbidden from using intermediate fuel
oil (IFO) bunker fuel entirely and must
burn solely marine gas oil or marine
diesel. Sulfur content is limited to 0.1%.
CARB, regulator of mobile emissions sources in California, is preparing
a submission to EPA and IMO to have
the Pacific Coast designated a SOx ECA
under MARPOL Annex VI Amendments.
The US Congress has several bills before it to establish a nationwide sulfur
emissions control area. The bills would
control emissions from marine vessels
entering US ports or offshore terminals.
House Resolution 2548 and companion Senate Bill S1499 would provide
for low-sulfur fuels within 200 miles
of the West Coast and also within an asyet-undetermined distance from the US
Gulf Coast and East Coast. The requirements of either bill could be met by use
of alternative control technologies such

as sulfur scrubbers.
Cleaner fuels could be required as
early as 2011. Both bills would require
“greatest degree of emissions reductions available” through available technologies for NOx and particulate matter
among other air contaminants.

Key uncertainties
The effect of these regulations on the
refining industry is still uncertain. Several key factors remain undetermined.
The SOx ECA program could expand
considerably. SOx ECAs could be established in various areas around the world
where ship-derived emissions contribute to onshore pollution problems.
Such areas may include most of North
America and European waters, including the Mediterranean and Straits of
Malacca, and seas off Northeast Asia.
Nations will establish NOx ECAs. The
areas likely to incorporate NOx ECAs
are basically the same as the areas probable for SOx ECAs.
Suitability of scrubbing technology for both SOx and NOx must be
established. Widespread application of
scrubbing technology may limit the
amount of low-sulfur fuel that needs to
be manufactured while at the same time
cap the price premium that might be
paid for it.
Extent of greenhouse gas or CO2
controls and interaction with other
pollutants are as yet unknown. Production of low-sulfur fuels contributes CO2
emissions at the refinery level, which
must be accounted for and balanced

against gains in shipping. It is possible
that more-efficient marine engines can
be designed that burn higher-quality
fuels.
Marine fuel quality requirements
will change. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is
undertaking that effort. Sulfur grades
will be added and the detail of viscosity
regulation will be simplified. More importantly, other aspects of fuel quality
will be reevaluated.
New limits may be adopted for
organic acid content (total acid number,
TAN) in lieu of, or in addition to, the
current limit on strong acid content. Introducing such limits may affect the use
of high-TAN crude oils as convenient,
low-priced feedstock for manufacturing
low-sulfur marine fuels.
Nitrogen content may be regulated.

A current problem for refiners is
blending FCC slurry oils to bunker
fuels. Slurry oils are attractive to bunker
fuel suppliers partly because they usually are relatively low-sulfur stocks.
Alumina and silica derived from the
FCC catalyst in the slurry oils, however,
creates problems with current bunker
fuel requirements. The catalyst particles
contribute to erosivity of the bunker
fuel and increased stringency in that
area may compound refiners’ difficulties
in this area.

Reﬁning industry
The refining industry faces major
obstacles in producing higher-quality
marine fuels. The average sulfur content
of IFO-grade marine fuels is currently
more than 2.5%. Refiners may need to
reduce the sulfur level to 0.5%.
In the short term, many refiners can

or California grades commonly contain considerable nitrogen. Using those
crudes to manufacture marine fuels may
be affected depending on the stringency of any nitrogen specification that
is adopted.
More-stringent standards on ignition characteristics may be adopted.
Improving these characteristics may
contribute to improved emissions levels.
Fuel stability is important and improved
stability standards are expected.
Possible new standards will more
carefully regulate the use of nonrefinery-derived blendstocks used for
marine fuels. The marine fuels market
long has been in part a disposal opportunity for unattractive stocks such
as petrochemical wastes, oleochemical
or biofuels wastes, recycled lube oil
components, and others. The new ISO
standards may directly ban some of
these components.

blend acceptable fuels for the SOx ECAs.
SOx ECAs comprise only a small portion of marine fuels burned currently.
A typical container ship traveling
from Singapore to Rotterdam will burn
about 7,500 tonnes of bunker fuel in
24 days. Only the last 400 miles of that
journey are in SOx ECA waters. A cargo
ship traveling from Shanghai to Los
Angeles travels about 5,800 nautical
miles, of which the last 24 miles are in
the sulfur-control area.
Although problems of fuel availability and segregation must be resolved for
such vessels, the refining industry faces
only a minor obstacle to produce small
fractions of bunker fuel at current or
2010 ECA-quality levels. The new global
bunker sulfur specification of 3.5% in
2012 will affect about 15% of bunker fuel from high-sulfur crudes. The
preponderance of fuel already meets the
requirement.

The longer term difficulties are
greater. Less than 5% of current bunker
fuel production meets the 0.5% sulfur
level. Producing SOx ECA fuel to a 0.1%
sulfur level will be quite difficult. Will
low sulfur IFO be produced or will
marine gas oil-type distillate materials
largely displace IFO fuels?
Although running lower-sulfur
crudes can help some refiners ease
some refining difficulties, crude slate
will not be a major contributor to solving marine fuels quality issues in the
long term. Unlike diesel, gasoline, or
stationary-application fuel oil, marine
fuels are global. The same set of regulations is governing quality all around the
world at the same time. When the 0.5%
global specification comes into force,
all bunker fuel producers will face the
same problem at the same time and
crude selection will play only a minor
role.
Desulfurizing fuel oil components
to the levels required is problematic.
Capital and operating costs for desulfurization are high.
Although the technology exists to
desulfurize residual fuels to low levels,
it is not practiced to these levels in ordinary commercial fuel oil practice. It is
an open question what role desulfurization may play to help produce needed
fuel qualities.
The shipping industry understands
that fuel quality in the 0.1-0.5% range
probably implies refiners using conversion technology, not just desulfurization. Marine engines run effectively on
marine gas oil as an alternative to IFOgrade residual fuels. Such fuels now are
used for a minor fraction of ship fuels.
Will ship owners be willing to pay the
higher cost of marine gas oil fuels in
such large quantities?
Of the conversion technology
families available to refiners, coking and
hydrocracking have the most obvious
application to the marine fuels problem.
It is the nature of bunker fuels that the
lowest-quality conversion feedstocks
often are directed to bunker fuels to
preserve higher-quality resids and gas
oils for conversion processing in existOil & Gas Journal / Nov. 24, 2008

ing equipment. As compared to desirable resid FCC feedstock, typical bunker
fuel is high sulfur, high asphaltene, and
high metals.
Coking technology often is found
most applicable to low-quality feedstocks. Coking is tolerant of the lowest
quality ranges and can solve a refiner’s
requirement of residue destruction effectively.
Hydrocracking technology offers
the needed flexibility of products that
is more difficult to achieve with FCCbased technologies. Global demand
growth patterns have increased demand
for distillate fuels and lowered gasoline demand. Consequently, the typical
gasoline-heavy product pattern for FCC
technology is not highly oriented to the
refinery output required. Indeed, converting marine IFO fuels to low-sulfur
fuels could add as much as 200 million
tonnes/year to distillate fuel demand at
the expense of residual fuel.

Outlook
Refiners require a clear signal from
the shipping industry as to the quality of fuel required. The schedule is
the most daunting obstacle, providing
11-16 years for the refining industry to
respond. Still, only limited progress is
possible until key decisions are made.
Regulators must come to a decision on the detailed acceptability of all
the various scrubbing technologies for
NOx and SOx. Rapid determination of
the boundaries and any tighter national
requirements for NOx ECAs and SOx
ECAs would be helpful to all parties to
resolve the optimal means of meeting
regulatory requirements while still providing cost-effective fuels and shipping
services.
Ship owners must determine the
extent to which they will install such
technologies and what types of fuel
they will require for the fleet. Of course
that decision depends on the costs of
the various fuels from the refining
industry.
Refiners must enter into a dialogue
with the shipping industry. IMO and
ship owners need information on the

costs of alternatives in order to make
beneficial decisions.
The IMO program for a “feasibility”
review in 2018 is too late to constitute
the signal the refining industry requires.
Whenever the IMO undertakes its review, the purpose will be to confirm for
the shipping industry that enough fuel
is ensured, not to confirm for the refining industry that enough demand exists.
The US refining industry must undertake its own review of marine fuels
requirements to determine how these
programs will affect US refiners and the
best position for the refining industry
to take on this global issue. ✦

necessary as interest in transporting
natural gas from northern energy fields
has grown. Natural gas transported via
pipeline from these fields will encounter both continuous and discontinuous
permafrost regions. Chilled gas pipelines prevent permafrost thawing. A new
problem, however, arises: the freezing
of previously unfrozen soil and associated frost heave (Fig. 1).

chilled pipelines.1-6 The literature generally accepts that natural gas would be
chilled through continuous and discontinuous permafrost zones.
Continuous permafrost zones would
have little effect on a chilled pipeline.
But operating a chilled pipeline in the
transition zone between soils with different frost-heave susceptibilities poses
problems. These transition zones often
lead to pronounced differential heave in
the pipeline, inducing stresses.
Differential heave also leads to questions regarding how much frost heave
may occur over the design life of a
pipeline and whether it will be within
allowable ranges for pipe deformation.
These questions in turn govern many
design and operational considerations.
This article addresses thermal patterns and pipeline-ground movements
found by placing a 105-m long, 0.9-m
OD steel pipeline across a transition
zone between thawed and permafrost
soils, typical of discontinuous permafrost regions. This article also analyzes
pipeline deformational behavior and
strain induced by soil heave.

The experimental pipeline rests
about 1.8 m below the surface, with
backfill of dry sand around and on top
of the pipe, including an additional
0.9 m of crushed in situ soil and a thin
crown of uncrushed in situ soil. The
first 30 m of the pipeline cross shallow
permafrost and the remaining section is
in unfrozen ground (Fig. 3).

One hundred thermistors located in
two of the three thermal fences monitored changes in the soil system (Figs.
5-6). Thermal fence A ran through the
initially unfrozen zone and thermal
fence C ran through the shallower permafrost region.
Thermal fence A, 58 m from the inlet riser, contains six thermistor strings
with depths ranging from 0.14 to
8.14 m (elevation of 1.13 to –6.87 m)
beneath the surface. Thermistor spacing ranged from 0.25 to 1.0 m with
the closer spacing occurring near the

ran along the outside of the pipeline to
monitor temperature variation of the
pipeline itself.

Monitoring vertical displacement
of the ground surface required placing six heave plates on the ground.
Twenty-four heave rods (HR) welded
directly to the top outer surface of the
pipeline between 0 and 52.7 m from
the inlet riser monitored movement
of the pipeline. The highest concentration of heave rods lay near the assumed
transition zone.
Two independent benchmarks
referenced elevation. Each consisted of
7.6-m long, 16 mm steel rebar. Benchmark installation in permafrost to the
south of the pipe placed about 6.6 m
underground and about 1 m above
ground. A 50-mm OD PVC pipe surrounded the upper 3 m of each benchmark to reduce active layer effects. A
150-mm OD PVC pipe placed over the
above-grade portion of each benchmark served as a protective casing. The
assumed reference elevation for analysis
purposes was 1 m.
Monitoring induced strain used
40 strain gauges attached to the pipe
surface.

Thermal analysis
In the permafrost zone (TFC), soil
remains frozen through the year, except for the top 1 m, which becomes
unfrozen in the summer. In the nonpermafrost zone (TFA) the thaw depth
extends deeper in the summer but all
soil remains frozen in winter.
A 2D thermal simulation model
conducted numerical simulation for the
full-scale experiment. Before the 2D
thermal simulation, simplified 1D simulation determined adequate parameters
for thermal simulation.
Field data matched well with both
the simulation results and analytical solution, implying that these methods of
simulation or analysis could be applied
to design. The parameters used (Table
2) provide a good reference for the
actual design stage.

pipeline movement. HR-1 stood 8.5 m
from the inlet riser and HR-24 52.7 m

relatively large in the nonpermafrost
zone. The largest displacement occurred
at HR-22 (45 m from the riser), with
an incremental displacement during
3 years monitoring of about 0.2 m.
The minimum movement within the
permafrost section measured 0.049 m,
resulting in a differential heave of 0.148
m. Maximum heave occurred next to
the permafrost-unfrozen transition
and not solely in the deep permafrost
zone. Pipe-bending stress assumed an
S-shaped distribution, with a maximum
stress measuring 50 Newton/sq mm.

The field experiment showed greater
upward displacement in the nonpermafrost sections than in the permafrost
section, causing an S-curve shaped
pipeline deformation near the boundary between the two. Chilled-pipeline
design requires analyzing pipeline
deformation and induced stress near
permafrost and nonpermafrost boundary using the proper structural mode.
Common practice models a pipeline
as a beam supported by elastic springs.
A similar approach allows analysis of
pipeline deformation near the permafrost and nonpermafrost boundary.
Fig. 9 shows the structural model of
chilled pipeline near a permafrost and
nonpermafrost boundary. In the model,
δ1 and δ2 represent upward displacement at permafrost section and nonpermafrost boundary section respectively.
Greater frost heaving increases δ2.
Pipe-soil interaction is modeled by
elastic springs (Es). The accompanying
equations calculate chilled gas pipeline
deformation due to frost heave. Applying the structural model to an actual

Three in-line structures placed along
the pipeline between P-52 and PRA-1
provide contingency relief.
• PLEM Y, to make a direct connection from P-52 to the pipeline through
a flexible riser.
• Rigid jumper, providing an additional entrance to allow future development.
• PLEM T, for use as an entrance flow
for future pipeline installations.

Analysis, design
Pipeline analysis and design requires
definition of the route, including soil
and stability evaluations, to find the best
route for keeping risks minimal while
also reducing constraints on the lay
vessel’s capabilities. Petrobras chose the
general route used to avoid both natural
obstacles and existing or to-be-installed
Roncador subsea structures. Route
optimization focused on minimizing material and resource use through
assessment of free spans, on-bottom
stability, crossings, and slope. Results
showed minimum curve radius and
other installation restrictions to be met
by the pipelay vessel.
Fig. 1 shows the pipeline route.
Project engineering addressed stability
of both equipment and pipeline, taking estimated friction coefficients into
account to evaluate risks and optimize
routing. Bottom roughness analysis

showed 21 free spans requiring remediation; 5 with mechanical supports and
16 with grout bags. Sensitivity analysis
on design parameters along the pipeline
route included uncertainties regarding
soil parameters and lay conditions along
different paths inside the pipeline corridor. Results showed a greater number
of free span corrections for any of the
other possible routes, concluding the
selected route was the best option.
WT calculations accounted for internal pressure and potential collapse,
checking results for buckling propagation. Local buckling limits determined
the maximum bending moments and
strains to which the pipe could be
subjected. Selected thicknesses address
internal pressure and collapse, but not
buckle propagation, making buckle ar-

restors mandatory.
Fig. 2 shows mechanical design and
route profile.

Thermomechanical analysis
High temperature-high pressure
pipelines may face high loads-strains
due to the thermomechanical behavior.
Moreover, issues like end expansion,
thermal cycle fatigue, ratcheting, and
longitudinal walking, among others,
can cause severe damage to the entire
flow system if it is not properly designed.
Soil-pipeline interaction, pipeline expansion, maximum stresses and strains,
girth-weld fatigue, pipeline axial-lateral
ratcheting, free-span assessment, buckling initiation, pipeline crossings, and
FEA model details provide the primary

Buckle initiation and mitigation applied along the route (across each of the
four segments) absorb midline thermal
expansion in a controllable manner by
applying buoyancy modules and dual
sleepers at discrete locations to work
as planned points for global buckle
initiation. Detailed FEA assessed midline
expansion in global buckles, whether
planned or unplanned, and determined
if project requirements were met.
The first approach used standard
single sleepers, but these did not meet
fatigue acceptance criteria due to in-line
and cross-flow vortex-induced vibration effects. The dual sleeper configuration met acceptance criteria (Fig. 3).
The pipes are about 30-m long with
a vertical upset of about 1 m. Ten dual
sleeper sets previously laid and six distributed buoyancy sections (Fig. 4) are
the mitigation devices. The distributed
buoyancy makes the line almost neutral
buoyant; reducing lateral friction and
permitting lateral buckle initiation.

assembled pipe length is deployed into
the sea. The process results in a freehanging catenary from seafloor to the
vessel.
The hang-off module supports the
pipeline during J-lay operations and is
the final attachment point before the
line moves into free-catenary suspension. Vessel crew can move the module fore and aft, adding the flexibility
needed to deploy such structures as
in-line bases.
Pipelay took place with the line
empty from 1,800 m to about 760
m. Stability issues prompted a flooded
lay from 760 m to 100 m. Shallower
depths required adjustments to the J-lay
tower angle to avoid excessive loads
potentially hazardous to the pipeline.
Angles varied from 83° to 61º.

New four-gas detector
The GX-2009, which measures 2.75 in.
high by 2.95 in. long by 0.98 in. deep, is a
lightweight four-gas monitor that weighs
4.6 oz and fits in the palm of your hand.
It simultaneously monitors and displays
combustibles, oxygen, carbon monoxide,
and hydrogen sulfide. Features include
dual audible alarm ports and alarm LEDs
on three sides of the instrument so that
alarm conditions are obvious from multiple perspectives, especially in high noise
environments. Other features include a waterproof and dustproof design with an IP
67 rating, an impact resistant rubber overmold body that is RFI resistant, and a large
capacity data logging system included as
standard.
Other standard items are vibration
alarm, autocalibration, calibration lock out
or reminder control, STEL/TWA readings,
peak hold, and autobacklighting at alarm
on a large LCD display. These controls and
features are operated through two glowin-the dark, glove friendly buttons. The

battery set will operate for 20 hr and will
fully charge in 3 hr.
A large capacity data logging function is
a standard feature on all GX-2009 instruments, and ubnits will store as many as
eight alarm trend sessions where readings
are recorded 30 min before and after an
alarm event. The data logging has a 3,600
data point capacity with a log time range
of 10-300 hr based on programmable interval times. The data logging software will
also store up to 100 calibration records
and is Windows XP and Vista compatible.
The GX-2009 is designed around this
firm’s sensors utilizing catalytic combustion, electrochemical, and galvanic sensor
technologies.

Data sheet discusses new water frac service
A new data sheet, yours free for the
asking, features new AquaStim UR water
frac service.
The service uses a fracturing fluid pack-

age that contains no hydrocarbons. The
system is designed to help reduce fracture
face damage, improve load recovery, and
boost production from coal formations
and other unconventional formations such
as shale and tight gas.
The service includes:
1. New water-based friction reducer.
2. Microemulsion additive to minimize
phase trapping.
3. Viscosity reducing agent to help
return the viscosity of solutions containing
treating agents, such as friction reducer, to
that of water.
The system can be easily foamed.
A conductivity-enhancing proppant
coating specially formulated for water frac
treatments can be effective when used
with AquaStim UR service to help maintain long-term conductivity and control
formation fines production, the data sheet
points out.

The bright side
of bankruptcy: a
political fantasy
In the rush to make ﬁnancially troubled
companies wards of the US government,
a strange misconception seems to be at
work: that bankrupt entities cease to exist.
That’s not so. Bankruptcy enables the
hopelessly indebted to continue to function
economically.
It’s a drastic step. It shouldn’t be taken
casually.
Sometimes, though, it’s inevitable. But

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

the people involved don’t vaporize. They
get a chance to start over.
Imagine a politically implausible but
possibly illuminating scenario in which
the government rescued just one of the
three big US automakers now pleading for
bailout.
Politics would steer aid to the weakest.
The move would force the second-weakest
automaker into bankruptcy, leaving the
other—presumably the strongest at the
beginning of all this—to slog on unaided.
Creditors and shareholders of the bankrupt automaker would sustain varying degrees of ﬁnancial loss. Depending on how
serious the court proved to be about making the emergent company competitive,
labor contracts would change, and there
would be fewer levels of management, less
lavishly compensated than before.
So there’d be hardship. But that word
doesn’t apply to the new inability of “workers” to claim wages for doing nothing
under a job-bank program or managerial
salaries with only six ﬁgures.
If everything went as it should, the US
would have one more major automobile
manufacturer able to compete than apparently it has now.
The new competition would be tough on
the other two companies—toughest, probably, on the one that missed out on the ﬁrst
dole, formerly the strongest.
By then, the rescued manufacturer
would have its own problems, such as
abysmal sales of the unpopular “green” vehicles it had to make as a condition of aid.
So the government still would have to
deal with automakers forced into jeopardy
by chronic competitive disadvantages.
It would, in other words, face the same
problems it has now, notwithstanding the
expenditure of tens of billions of dollars or
assumption of equivalent risk, but with two
troubled automakers rather than three.
It’s not hard to guess which of the original trio investors would, at that stage of the
cycle, like best.

Outlooks differ on slack demand, tight supplies
Financial analysts differ in expectations for a continuing fall in world demand for
energy or a tightening of supplies as demand revives in 2009.
The average price for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ basket
of 13 reference crudes dropped to a 42-month low of $47.73/bbl Nov. 13, prompting
OPEC Pres. Chakib Khelil to invite non-Arab members for sideline discussions at the
Nov. 29 meeting of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries in Cairo,
ahead of the scheduled OPEC meeting Dec. 17 in Oran, Algeria.
The November session would mark the third meeting of OPEC ministers over
market issues in as many months. They agreed Sept. 10 to “strictly comply” with
the ofﬁcial 28.8 million b/d production quota adopted in September 2007, which
would have eliminated more than 500,000 b/d of overproduction. They voted Oct. 4
to reduce that quota by 1.5 million b/d effective Nov. 1. Less than 2 weeks after that
effective date, they were signaling another probable cut.
“It really is primarily about sending signals,” said Paul Horsnell, Barclays Capital
Inc., London. “In reality the 2 million b/d cut [as] already agreed left quite a bit in
hand to cover further demand weakness. Further, it seems that OPEC supply may
well have contracted sharply even before the cut became effective.” The Middle
East Economic Survey estimated Saudi Arabian output at 9.1 million b/d in October,
400,000 b/d less than in September and 600.000 b/d lower than in July.
With non-OPEC supply “looking dead in the water” and OPEC supply already
coming off market, the cartel’s next cut is likely to be “more than necessary” and will
contribute to an over-tightening of the market in the ﬁrst quarter of 2009, Horsnell
said.
Economy ‘worsening’
On the other hand, Adam Sieminski, chief energy economist, Deutsche Bank,
Washington, DC, sees global oil demand falling 500,000 b/d in 2009, pulling down
crude prices perhaps to $30-35/bbl “at the lower end.” However, Deutsche Bank expects West Texas Intermediate to average $60/bbl in 2009 and $57.50/bbl in 2010.
In a Nov. 14 report, Deutsche Bank analysts said they expect in 2009 the worst
economic performance among industrialized countries “since the Great Depression.”
They said, “We forecast global growth rising 1.2%, its weakest performance since the
early 1980s, as economic weakness spreads to the emerging markets.”
Both the US Energy Information Administration and the International Energy
Agency in Paris have sharply reduced their estimates of oil demand growth in
2009, citing a weaker world economy. Taking into account lower 2008 estimates,
IEA cut its 2009 demand forecast by 670,000 b/d to a growth of 350,000 b/d, while
EIA reduced its earlier outlook by 1 million b/d to virtually no growth at all next
year. “OPEC, which early in 2008 used to have one of the comparatively lowest demand growth forecasts, was [at this point] still using a ﬁgure of 760,000 b/d growth
for 2009. We are nearly certain this will be reduced with their November report,”
Sieminski said.
He expects the call on OPEC crude to decline by 2 million b/d in 2009, roughly the
same amount as the reductions the cartel indicated in its September and October
meetings. Supply growth outside of OPEC lagged behind industry expectations in
2008 as a result of project delays and because of hurricane damage in the US in the
second half of the year. “We expect non-OPEC supply growth will disappoint again
in 2009 after falling in 2008. However, we envisage some production growth supplemented by 600,000 b/d of OPEC natural gas liquids,” said Sieminski.
Meanwhile, the forward cover for member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development could reach 57 days by third quarter 2009, up
by 1 day from Deutsche Bank’s October forecast. “We expect this will put even more
pressure on OPEC to trim production,” Sieminski said.
Still, he said, OPEC will have to struggle to cut its production as fast as world demand is expected to drop during the next 12 months. According to a Deutsche Bank
study of past production reduction cycles by OPEC, such cuts often take 3-6 months
to affect crude markets.
“Since we expect the current quota reduction cycle to persist until the fourth
quarter of 2009, it implies any sustained rally in crude oil will have to wait until
sometime in 2010,” Sieminski said. “On all counts we view the chances of a rebound
in energy and industrial metal prices as a remote possibility in 2009, but the likelihood of price recovery taking hold in 2010 are slightly more compelling.”

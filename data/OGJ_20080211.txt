COVER
While the decommissioning of oil and gas platforms in the mature
UK North Sea remains an issue for producers, improved technology
and high oil and gas prices are extending the lives of some equipment. Numerous operators have in effect delayed decommissioning
in many cases because continuing production makes economic
sense.The special report beginning on p. 22 profiles platform retirement in the North Sea. Cover photo from Oil & Gas UK.

Enbridge to lead industry CCS project
Enbridge Inc. plans to lead a group of 19 oil companies and
electric utilities in the Alberta Saline Aquifer Project (ASAP), a carbon capture and storage (CCS) research and pilot sequestration
project.
Other companies involved include BP Canada Energy Co., Chevron Canada Resources, ConocoPhillips, EnCana Corp., Penn West
Energy Trust, and TransCanada.
Initially, ASAP will identify deep saline aquifers suitable for
long-term storage of carbon dioxide in Canada. The first phase is
expected to be completed by yearend.
A second phase calls for designing sequestration sites to receive
injected carbon dioxide. Later phases could involve large-scale,
long-term commercial sequestration.
On Feb. 1, a joint federal-provincial government panel recommended that Canadian governments invest $2 billion (Can.), to be
matched by energy industry funding, toward CCS research with
the goal of sequestering 5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide by
2015.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

• The impact of the French biofuels plan, which since Jan.1 has
jumped to a 5.75% incorporation into motor fuels. That goal was
set by the European Union for 2010, but France anticipated it earlier, leading to logistic adaptations and costlier supply.
• The turnaround of a number of refineries, the reduction in
product sulfur content, and the railway strikes that resulted in
higher costs in late November.
• The increase in the internal oil products tax, which the government had transferred to the regions.
Jean-Louis Schilansky, delegate general of the oil companies’
trade group UFIP, told OGJ that the price of gasoline and diesel
fuel increased by some €0.02/l. compared with what it should
have been.
Schilansky said, “What we really appreciate is the rational analysis of the situation by the government. The price of motor fuels is
now being discussed at an economic level and no longer in a political and polemical way.”

Finance minister lauds French industry fuel prices 65.7 million tonnes of LNG, up 5.7% over 2006, according to Pan
In an unprecedented move, French Finance and Economy Minister Christine Lagarde commended oil companies and distributors
for keeping a promise made at the Nov. 10, 2007, roundtable she
chaired, that they would address oil price peaks and pass along
price drops as quickly as possible at service stations.
She noted in a press release that the price of motor fuels had returned in late January to the preround table level following heights
reached in early January. She said three factors explained variations
in the price of motor fuels over the last few weeks in France, pushing up prices:

EurAsian Enterprises. South Korea remained the world’s second
largest LNG importer at 25.6 million tonnes, up 1.2% over 2006.
Pan EurAsian cited the next six largest global LNG importers in
2007, in millions of tonnes of LNG, as: Spain 19.1; US 17; France
10.2; Taiwan 8.3; India 6.2; and Turkey (with only one terminal)
3.5.
Taiwan’s LNG imports were up 6.8% over 2006, Pan EurAsian
reported, and China appeared in the reckoning—with imports
of 2.9 million tonnes, up from less than 10% of that amount in
2006. ✦

Chukchi Sea sale draws $2.66 billion in high bids
Oil and gas producers submitted $2.66 billion in apparent high
bids in a record-breaking offshore federal lease sale in Alaska, the
US Minerals Management Service said Feb. 6.
The 677 bids on 488 blocks in the first Chukchi Sea lease sale
since 1991 made it the most successful Outer Continental Shelf
lease sale in Alaska’s history, MMS said. Shell Gulf of Mexico Inc.
submitted the single largest bid—more than $105.3 million. Shell
also led in total bids, with 302 totaling nearly $2.2 billion, 275 of
them high bids for nearly $2.12 billion.
ConocoPhillips was the second most active bidder, submitting
145 bids for $1.1 billion, including 98 high bids for more than
$506.4 million. Other participants included Repsol E&P USA Inc.
with 104 total bids for $15.6 million, 93 of which were high bids

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

for more than $14.4 million and Eni Petroleum US Inc. with 74
total bids for nearly $35 million, 17 of which were high bids for
nearly $8.9 million.
StatoilHydro USA E&P Inc., Iona Energy Co. (US) Ltd., and
North American Civil Recoveries Arbitrage Corp. also submitted
high bids, according to MMS.
The US Department of Interior agency received nearly $3.39
billion in bids from the seven companies for 2,304-acre tracts
spread over more than 29 million acres. It said that each high bid
now will be evaluated to assure that it represents a fair market value
before a lease is issued. The closest awarded tract to land is 54 miles
offshore, MMS said.
The sale took place despite protests that oil and gas activity could
pose a threat to polar bears, which another DOI agency, the US Fish

have said that the threat comes from melting sea ice and that the
bears already have strong safeguards under the Marine Mammal
Protection Act. Lease terms will include stringent environmental
provisions, MMS Director Randall L. Luthi noted.
Oil industry and other groups expressed their support for the
sale on Feb. 6. The American Petroleum Institute called it “a welcome first step toward increasing much-needed energy supplies
for US consumers and the US economy.”
Meanwhile, National Association of Manufacturers Pres. John
Engler said production from the Chukchi Sea would reduce US
dependence on foreign sources.
The US Oil & Gas Association said the area’s oil and gas resources represent an important domestic energy opportunity that
should not be ignored.

The well lies 7 km north of the Titania discovery and 10.5 km
southwest of Plutao field. Portia is the 15th discovery BP has drilled
on Block 31. Portia was drilled in 2,012 m of water 386 km northwest of Luanda. It reached 5,678 m TVD subsea. This is the fourth
discovery on Block 31 in which the exploration well was drilled
through salt to access an oil-bearing sandstone reservoir beneath.
Although oil deposits are commonly associated with salt, salt
distorts seismic images, so salt-affected areas require additional
seismic processing and interpretation prior to drilling.
Sonangol is the concessionaire of Block 31, which covers 5,349
sq km and lies in 1,500-2,500 m of water. BP holds 26.67%. Other

International Petroleum Angola Block 31 Ltd. 10%, and Total Group
subsidiary Tepa Block 31 Ltd. 5%.

Shell makes oil ﬁnd at Vicksburg in eastern gulf

Chevron completes Big Foot in deepwater gulf

Shell Oil Co. has made an oil discovery at the Vicksburg prospect
in 7,500 ft of water on DeSoto Canyon Blocks 353 and 397 and
Mississippi Canyon Block 393, in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
The well was drilled to a depth of 25,400 ft and found a 300-ft
hydrocarbon column. Transocean’s semisubmersible Deepwater
Nautilus, on contract to Shell, drilled the well.
Shell is operator of Vicksburg with a 57.5% interest. Vicksburg
partners are Nexen Inc. 25% and Plains Exploration & Production
Co. 17.5%.

Chevron Corp. reported the successful completion of an appraisal well at its Big Foot prospect in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Big
Foot lies in more than 5,000 ft of water on Walker Ridge Block 29,
about 225 miles south of New Orleans and 180 miles offshore.
The appraisal well, Big Foot No. 3, Sidetrack No. 2, confirmed
the same pay intervals of the previously announced discovery and
sidetrack wells, and found the main pay sand full of oil to the base,
Chevron said.
Operated by a Chevron subsidiary, the appraisal well reached a

PDVSA pays Total, StatoilHydro for Orinoco items
Venezuela will pay $1.1 billion in compensation to StatoilHydro
AS and France’s Total SA for its nationalization of an oil project they
previously controlled.
State-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) agreed to pay
its partners for their reduced stakes in the Sincor heavy oil venture
with a combination of crude oil and cash.
However, Total and StatoilHydro must pay some $130 million
of their compensation as a “bonus” to fund the new Sincor joint
venture company.
After that deduction, Total will receive $735 million in the form
of quarterly crude oil shipments, while Statoil will receive $235
million in cash.
President Hugo Chavez’s government last May took over majority stakes in heavy oil upgrading projects located along the Orinoco
River basin operated by four international oil companies.
While StatoilHydro and Total agreed to remain as minority
partners under new arrangements with the government, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil Corp. declined to accept the government offer.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

PDVSA has not announced any results of its compensation talks
with the two US firms, but reports suggest that the Venezuelan
firm is exploring all forms of compensation including payment
in crude.
Meanwhile, StatoilHydro signed an agreement with Venezuela
to quantify the reserves of the Junin 10 block in the Orinoco belt
with a view to developing them.
A local StatoilHydro official said the firm sees enormous reserves potential in the country.
Chavez wants the Orinoco belt reserves certification process
completed by 2010. He hopes that certification will boost his
country’s reserves to more than 300 billion bbl from the current
100 billion bbl.
Regardless of the amount of reserves, however, Orinoco oil will
be a boost to the country’s output potential and earnings.
Falling outside of the quota system of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, to which Venezuela belongs, Orinoco’s heavy oil reserves would enable Chavez to ramp up production and sales without the need for any authorization from
OPEC.

BPZ Energy-chartered tanker sinks off Peru
A Peruvian Navy tanker chartered by BPZ Energy Inc. of Houston caught fire and sank on Jan. 30. The tanker, Supe, which was
moored near the Corvina CX-11 platform in Corvina field off Peru,
was being used for oil storage.
At the time of the accident, it held 1,300 bbl of oil, most of
which is believed to have burned in the fire. The tanker had a capacity of 7,500 bbl.
“Initial assessments show that environmental issues have been
adequately controlled,” BPZ said. A full investigation is under way,
the company said.
The Supe tanker sank about 11⁄2 miles from the platform, which

Processing
Sinopec, Sabic plan petrochemical plant in China
China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (Sinopec) and Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (Sabic) have signed a nonbinding document
outlining the main issues for a tentative 50-50 joint venture
to build a $1.7 billion ethylene derivatives complex in Tianjin,
China.
The proposed complex would produce 1 million tonnes/year
of ethylene derivatives—600,000 tonnes/year of polyethylene
and 400,000 tonnes/year of ethylene glycol—and is proposed
to be completed by September 2009. All of its ethylene feedstock would be supplied by Tianjin Petrochemical Co., a branch
of Sinopec.
This would be Sabic’s first JV in China. Company officials said
China is an important market for Sabic, which hopes to become
one of the world’s top petrochemical companies by 2020.

Petroecuador, PDVSA plan reﬁnery in Ecuador
Ecuador and Venezuela plan to jointly finance and build a
300,000 b/d refinery in Ecuador’s coastal province of Manabi, according to Ecuador’s Mines and Oil Ministry.
The ministry said representatives of state oil companies Petroecuador of Ecuador and PDVSA of Venezuela met in Quito, Ecuador,
to discuss project details.
“The group analyzed the legal aspects to constitute the mixed
economies enterprise and drafted the schedule for preparing the
documents,” to ensure that the representatives of both companies
could sign the contract in March, the ministry said.
Plans call for the completion of a feasibility study for the project
in June, with construction to be completed within 4 years. No date
for the start of construction was provided.
Ecuador’s oil minister Galo Chiriboga Zambrano said the refinery will be financed equally by the two countries and supplied
largely with crude from Ecuador. “But later on, it would (use) Venezuelan oil when ours is depleted,” the minister said.

Sinopec to upgrade Changling, Baling reﬁneries
China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (Sinopec) will invest about
$2.2 billion to raise the production capacity of two domestic refineries.
The announcement came as Chinese officials, who have pledged

started production Nov. 1, 2007 (OGJ, Dec. 10, 2007, p. 22).
The tanker stored oil produced from the 21XD and 14D wells.
Current production, 4,200 b/d of oil, and the testing operations
on the 18XD well were temporarily suspended.
Initial reported indicated no damage to the platform, barges,
drilling, and well-testing equipment.
BPZ said damage appears to have been limited mostly to the
tanker, which was moved farther away from the platform after
catching fire.
Twelve Peruvian Navy sailors working aboard the tanker were
injured and evacuated to area hospitals. Two sailors were treated
and released while 10 sailors were evacuated to Lima via a Peruvian
Navy hospital plane. ✦

a better system of supply, scrambled to meet growing domestic
demand in the face of a particularly cold winter.
Sinopec will spend about $1.4 billion in expanding its Changling
refinery in central China’s Hunan province, by doubling its production capacity to 10 million tonnes/year.
It will spend an additional $834.3 million to upgrade its Baling
plant, which processes oil from Changling into chemicals.
The move follows the central government’s pledge to meet rising domestic fuel demand. The Chinese state-owned refiners are
required to ensure the supply after transportation systems in many
provinces were disrupted by the snowstorms.
The upgrade announcement came as Chinese officials struggled
to cope with their country’s worst winter storms in decades.
The China Meteorological Administration said the bad weather,
including more snow, was expected to continue for at least the next
3 days in parts of eastern and southern China.
“Guizhou, Jiangsu, and Shandong have suffered their worst
snowfalls in 50 years,” the administration said. For Hunan and
Shaanxi provinces, it was the worst in 20 years.
Sinopec’s upgrade also coincided with reports that China
reached new highs for oil production, imports, and consumption
in 2007.
In 2007 China produced 186.7 million tonnes of crude, up
1.6% from 2006, while its net oil imports were 159.28 million
tonnes, up 14.7%.
The country’s oil consumption, representing the sum of net
imports plus output, rose 7.3% to 346 million tonnes in 2007,
meaning that that imports account for about 46% of China’s oil
consumption.
China refined 326.79 million tonnes of crude in 2007, representing a growth of 6.4%—about the same as the 6.3% recorded
in 2006.
The output of refined oil products, comprised of gasoline, diesel, and kerosine, stood at 195 million tonnes, up 7.2% year-onyear or about 2.5% higher than in 2006.
Officials said that the diesel shortage that occurred in the country in second half 2007 led to an especially sharp rise in diesel
imports, rising by 130.1% to 1.62 million tonnes, while diesel
exports fell by 14.9% to 660,000 tonnes. ✦

Bechtel to build Angola’s ﬁrst LNG plant
Angola LNG Ltd. is planning Angola’s first gas liquefaction facility near Soyo in Zaire Province. The LNG plant will have a nominal
capacity of 5.2 million tonnes/year of LNG and will include storage for LNG, LPG, and condensate; and a loading jetty sized to
accommodate ships as large as 210,000 cu m. A subsidiary of the
Bechtel group will construct the plant.
The project is an integrated gas utilization project encompassing offshore and onshore operations monetizing gas from blocks
off Angola. First LNG from the project is expected by early 2012
(OGJ, Jan. 7, 2008, p. 21).
Angola LNG Ltd. has licensed ConocoPhillips’s proprietary natural gas liquefaction technology. “The Bechtel-ConocoPhillips proposal was selected as the successful bid following a comprehensive
evaluation of two competitive proposals submitted following the
front-end engineering design (FEED) competition for the LNG facility,” said Ken Marrs, Angola LNG Ltd. project manager.
Angola LNG Ltd. shareholders are affiliates of Sonangol 22.8%,
Chevron Corp. 36.4%, BP PLC 13.6%, Total SA 13.6%, and Eni SPA
13.6%.

Singapore to build LNG terminal by early 2009
Construction of a planned $1 billion LNG regasification terminal in Singapore is expected to begin by late this year or early 2009
to enable the city-state to begin importing LNG by late 2011-early
2012, according to a senior official (OGJ, Oct. 1, 2007, Newsletter).
S. Iswaran, Minister of State for Trade and Industry, said Singapore needs to move forward with LNG as an important part of its
policy to diversify energy sources. Currently, Singapore depends on
natural gas piped in from neighboring Malaysia and Indonesia.
Iswaran said PowerGas, the wholly owned subsidiary of Singapore Power, has made good progress toward the construction start
and should be able to make some critical decisions shortly.
PowerGas has been identifying core capabilities needed for the
expansion, Iswaran added, and they are assessing partnerships to
enhance expertise within the consortia in order to develop the terminal. “After selecting partners and completing the complex design process...they will need to start actual work by the end of this
year or early next year,” to meet the import target, he said.
Iswaran’s remarks came after an announcement by the country’s Energy Market Authority that it had short-listed five groups
competing to be the sole LNG importer-consortium from a total of
18 proposals involving 22 companies. EMA did not disclose their
identities due to requests for confidentiality. Selection is slated for
the second quarter.
The market response was promising, Iswaran said, and Singapore had “very strong” proposals from the diverse organizations.

gional activities to serve proposed gas fields to be developed in the
offshore Browse basin.
Their aim is to prevent piecemeal development following an
environmentalist outcry in 2007 at proposals by Woodside Petroleum, Inpex, and others to establish LNG plants at several locations
on the Kimberley coast or on offshore islands. The region is regarded as a pristine wilderness, and public opinion is that it should
be kept that way.
Industry sources appear relatively comfortable with the government initiative as long as the companies concerned are involved in
the consultation process.
The Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association
said the industry would like a list of potential sites by mid-2008
and a final decision by yearend. APPEA does not want to see the
process stalled by “green politics.”
The companies involved are aware of the pristine nature of the
environment but know that differing distances of the offshore gas
fields from the coast will mean that each company will prefer different sites. None wants to see a competitive advantage given to
another. The single hub plan also raises the question of potentially
massive public infrastructure investment to ensure that facilities
such as ports, roads, and other access resources remain available
to all users.
The single hub proposal will build on work already performed
by Western Australia’s Northern Development Taskforce, which has
been attempting to achieve a balance between Browse basin development and environmental and heritage interests.

NNPC sets up shipping ﬁrm for Nigerian LNG
Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. has established a new shipping company, Nikorma Shipping Services Ltd., to handle the additional volume of Nigerian LNG exports expected in the coming
years.
NNPC, which has taken a 51% holding in the venture, plans
to reduce this to 30%, offering the remaining shares to private
Nigerian investors.
NNPC established Nikorma Shipping with shareholder participation from MISC Bhd., Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd., and local shipping and logistics firm Deepwater Shipping & Maritime Co.
Ltd. MISC will have a 30% holding, HHI 11.5%, and DSMC 7.5%.
Nigeria’s LNG exports are projected to rise to 60 million
tonnes/year from a current level of 17.9 million tonnes/year over
the next 5 years.

Enbridge’s N. Dakota line expansion in service

Enbridge Energy Partners LP has begun service on its recently

Request For Expressions of Interest
Contract: 08RFIN26 Due Date: 2/25/08 Title:
Purchase & delivery of Ultra Low Sulfur #2 Ultra
Low Diesel Fuel (ULSD) to NYC Transit Authority
and MTA Bus Locations. Description: NYCT
recently published an RFI to determine if parties
were interested in supplying ULSK#1. Currently,
NYCT uses approx 55 million gal of ULSK #1
at depots throughout NYC. Several responses
were received with respect to ULSK #1.
However, in a further attempt to identify firms
that can furnish & deliver diesel fuel, NYCT &
MTA Bus are strongly considering the
substitution of a more fungible, widely used
fuel, Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel #2 (ULSD#2)
at some or all of its depots. Consequently, NYCT
& MTA Bus are seeking expressions of interest
from firms interested in supplying & delivering
Ultra Low Sulfur #2 Diesel Fuel (ULSD#2) for
all or a portion of the 55 million gal annual bulk
fuel requirement for NYCT & MTA Bus fleets.
This Request for an expression of interest is
not a solicitation of actual proposals, which
may be solicited by means of a formal
solicitation at a later date.
For more information,
visit our website at
www.mta.info/nyct/procure/rfipage.htm

Alberta’s economic realism
Environmental imperative has arrived once
more at its inevitable intersection with economic
realism. For the rest of the world, navigation
through the impasse in Canada will be instructive.
Canada’s federal government has set ambitious
targets for lowering emissions of greenhouse gases
(GHGs). In a policy statement called “Turning
the Corner,” it pursues cuts during 2006-20 of
20% and through 2050 of 60-70%. The program
requires emission reductions at the company level.
Companies can lower emissions at their facilities,
invest in emission-reducing technology, trade
emission allowances, and use the Kyoto Treaty’s
“clean development mechanism,” which credits a
company in one country for lowering emissions in
another.

‘Low-emissions society’
The National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy recently elaborated on this
federally specified “transition to a low-emissions
society.” It recommends that the government
“implement a strong, clear, consistent, and certain
GHG emission price signal across the entire Canadian economy as soon as possible.” It calls for
an emission tax or cap-and-trade system or both.
For parts of the economy that don’t respond to
the price signal or “where market failures exist,” it
suggests “complementary regulatory policies.”
Governments proceed this way when they let
the environmental imperative of GHG reduction
supersede other interests. The approach follows
that of the Kyoto Treaty, embraced most enthusiastically in Europe. Its emission targets are aggressive, as they must be for any program trying to
stabilize atmospheric concentrations of GHGs. In
fact, as the Kyoto experiment shows, they’re futile.
When the high costs of aggressive emission cuts
become clear, economic realism awakens to breed
political resistance. A lurking political complication is the lack of assurance that lowering human emissions of GHGs can alter global average
temperature.
The conflict is fully developed in Alberta, where
GHG regulation falls heavily on an eminent generator of wealth. The oil sands industry already faces
a full menu of problems, including leaping costs,
Alberta’s newly increased royalty rate, labor and
material shortages, questions about fuels and electric power, limits on water supply, and a range of

environmental issues other than GHG emissions.
Even with crude oil prices high, profit margins of
the oil sands industry remain under pressure. New
costs from toughened GHG regulation can’t help.
Refusing to let environmental imperative supersede provincial interests, Alberta’s government
recently steered away from the federal path on
GHG policy. It calls for a 14% cut in emissions of
carbon dioxide against 2005 levels by 2050, with
all reductions coming after 2020. Allowing emissions to rise until then accommodates expected
increases in production of bitumen and heavy oil.
It also angers all-or-nothing environmentalists.
But Alberta’s modified approach makes room for
economic realism. In January, Alberta Premier Ed
Stelmach told reporters, “It would be very difficult
to bring in real reductions, immediate reductions,
without devastating the economy and the quality
of life of Albertans.”
Alberta’s GHG program further differs from
its federal counterpart by eschewing new emission targets for companies and concentrating
instead on CO2 capture and storage. Critics of the
approach naturally argue that the method hasn’t
been widely employed. That’s true. But the technology is at hand. A task force with representatives
from the Albertan and federal governments has
just published a program for using it.

Capture and storage
The EcoEnergy Carbon Capture and Storage Task
Force calls for total cuts in GHG emissions of 5
megatonnes/year from three to five capture-andstorage projects by 2015. Oil sands projects are
obvious candidates. The task force further recommends that federal and provincial governments
supplement industry investments in the initial
projects with funding of as much as $2 billion.
And it calls for follow-up work and funding for
subsequent capture-and-storage initiatives. Ultimately, it says, projects of that type might reduce
Canadian CO2 emissions by 600 megatonnes/
year—40% of the projected cuts for 2050.
CO2 capture and storage can’t eliminate the
costs of GHG reduction. They do, however, represent a high-volume option that might keep costs
under control and align environmental imperatives
with economic realism. Alberta and Canada have
a chance to show the world how to make such an
option work. ✦

North Sea requirements for total removal of offshore structures represent a

Three major North Sea decommissioning projects under way
There are a number of decommissioning projects currently under way
in the North Sea. Three major projects are BP PLC’s North West Hutton
platform in the UK sector, Total SA’s
Frigg platforms, which straddle the UKNorwegian boundary, and ConocoPhillips’s Ekoﬁsk-1 platform in Norwegian
waters.

North West Hutton
BP’s North West Hutton platform
produced 125 million bbl of oil between
1983 and January 2003. A heavy-lift
vessel will remove the 20,000-tonne
topsides and the 17,000-tonne steel
jacket down to the tops of the footings
(OGJ, June 20, 2005, p. 51). The units
will be moved to the Able yard on Teesside for recycling and disposal and the
decommissioning work will be completed next year.
This decommissioning project will
use new cutting tool technology to
remove a steel jacket structure of this
weight, which sits in 140 m of water.
After this work is ﬁnished, Heerema
and subcontractors will decommission
the pipeline, clear debris, and inspect
the platform site.
A BP spokesman told OGJ that it will
start decommissioning in the second
quarter. “We did the well abandonment
phase some years back when the ﬁeld
was still operational. We cleaned up the
topsides to make them hydrocarbon

“There should be sufficient profit for
companies to get increased tax relief,
and this change will become effective
in relation to losses incurred in accounting periods on or after Budget
Day 2008,” Leith said.
Last October, Oil & Gas UK launched
the Decommissioning Cost Provision
Deed (DCPD) following 2 years of
intense negotiations with PILOT, the
industry and government forum for
the oil industry (OGJ, Oct. 22, 2007, p.

free. This project has never been done
before and we have estimated £169
million; we haven’t revised it and we’ll
have a better idea of costs once we
ﬁnish it.”

The DCPD aims to clarify decommissioning liabilities by offering different
options for joint-venture partners in
their plans for offshore assets. The government will review DCPDs approved
by asset buyers on a case-by-case basis.
When satisfied, it will release sellers
from decommissioning liability. It will
measure the program’s success by how
many companies take up the DCPD.

lifting, transporting, and disposal.
Damage from hurricanes in 2004
and 2005 brought new attention to
decommissioning in the gulf.
Steve Trammel, senior product
manager for new product development
at IHS Inc., told OGJ: “Key difficulties
seem to be the number of platforms
damaged and the fact that a damaged
platform could be twisted, bent, toppled and sunk by the storms, making
the removal more problematic, dangerous, and costly.”

Costs of decommissioning damaged
platforms and pipelines can be 15 times
those of conventional abandonment,
according to some estimates.
The US Minerals Management
Service expects decommissioning of
hurricane-ravaged platforms to continue until 2013 because of equipment
scarcity and delays.
BJ Kruise, petroleum engineer for
the field operations office at MMS, said,
“The timetable for decommissioning
depends on whether the lease is on production, and operators have a year to do
the work if the lease has expired.”
Kruise said issues raised by platform
destruction include hazards to marine
traffic and the obligations of lessees to
return the seafloor to its condition prior
to oil and gas activities. Environmental
safeguards in place at the time of the
hurricanes reduced pollution risks.
“Wells that were sheared off at the
mudline had their subsurface safety
valves shut in as the platforms were
destroyed because of the force of the
waves,” Kruise said.
Beyond decommissioning associated
with hurricanes, the MMS official said,

“The major challenge will be handling
the decommissioning of deepwater
platforms as more operators move to
develop deeper prospects.”
Techniques for decommissioning
could be improved if contractors were
better at sharing information about
their practices, according to Kruise.
“We also need industry [professionals] to share their experience with each
other through the American Petroleum
Institute and the Society of Petroleum
Engineers and open dialogue with their
experiences all over the world,” he said.
The gulf has pursued a “rigs-to-reef”
program since the mid-1980s—an approach blocked in the UK North Sea by
environmental protests. The program
creates a habitat for fish.
“Studies as to the effectiveness and
safety of rigs to reefs are still under way
in both the gulf and the North Sea,”
said Trammel of IHS. “Both areas have a
similar mud-bottom environment that
can apparently benefit from manmade
structures being put in place to generate
coral growth and more marine life as a
result.” ✦

Femi Aisida, chief office manager for
Shell Nigeria Exploration & Production
Co. Following a Nigerian directive for
front-end engineering design (FEED)
work to be performed in Nigeria from
2006, Shell developed a Nigerian team
to carry out the FEED for the deepwater
Bonga NorthWest field, a subsea tieback
to an existing manifold.
“An economic challenge is the cost

of establishing the expertise in addition
to executing the FEED,” he added. Mistakes on technical work are extremely
expensive to rectify, so Shell trained
the staff by bringing in experienced
engineers from overseas to monitor the
work. “Coordinating expertise from
diverse locations was difficult,” Aisida
said. The company is keen to retain the
Nigerian team and develop its expertise
beyond FEED work to support its other

business units, provided that the quality
of work is sound and performed within
a competitive timeframe.
Next month Bonga will be shut in
for routine maintenance for 10 days
with a loss of 225,000 b/d to the
market. Attacks on oil and gas pipelines
in the Delta have reduced supplies by
an average of 850,000 b/d, leading to a
fall in investor confidence and a loss of
income for the country. ✦

OWA: Pressure increases for Niger Delta peace
Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
The $4 billion Nigeria allocated to
the Niger Delta for its development
over the last 4-5 years has been swallowed up by increased governmental
staff wages, security, and corruption, a
senior official has said.
Speaking at the Offshore West Africa
conference, Delta State Deputy Governor E. Utuama said staff numbers in
government posts have risen because
there weren’t any jobs in the private
sector. “Everyone is looking for a job.”
But Nigeria should form an Inspector General’s office to monitor sustainable development projects in the Niger
Delta and help quell the unrest that is
blocking oil and gas production, suggested a Niger Delta community relations advisor at the conference session
looking at sustainable development in
the Niger Delta.

Stephen Benstowe, who has provided
advice to the Bonny Island community
that hosts the Nigeria LNG plant, said
timely release of funds for development in the Niger Delta was critical.
The problems in the region can be
blamed upon government inaction and
the insincerity of oil companies with
their sustainable development policies.
Operators are failing to integrate with
and engage the communities.
“Who is responsible for sustainable
development in Nigeria? It has earned
$20 billion/year over the last 4 years
from oil, and there are 20 million inhabitants in the Niger Delta who live in
abject poverty and are grossly neglected,” Benstowe charged.
The government has formulated
a Niger Delta master plan to reduce
poverty, diversify the economy, improve
health, and develop new transport,
communications, and waste management facilities. So far, militants and resi-

dents from the region have complained
bitterly about its poor implementation.
Community Development Foundations, where communities and oil
companies work together to address
community needs, have had some
success, said Anthony Bolarin, general
manager of sustainable development at
Elf Petroleum Nigeria Ltd. But he cautioned against creating projects doomed
to failure: “There have been lots of
national development plans proposed
before, and if we’re not careful there
will be another one. Things have started
to be built, but haven’t [been] finished,
or those that have finished have been
grassed up.”
He said global memorandums of
understanding have been a failure in
spearheading development in the Niger
Delta. “We need to let the community
come back to the center and ask them
what they want; we must stop dictating
to them.” ✦

DOI’s $10.7 billion budget has environmental emphasis

The US Department of the Interior’s proposed budget for fiscal year

tat sits atop world-class energy resources,” he observed, adding that planning
“ridge top-to-ridge top instead of acreto-acre” is required in such cases.
Following the formal budget presentation, BLM Director James L. Caswell
confirmed that his agency has adopted
more deliberate planning for oil and gas
projects in response to greater public
interest. “We can make better decisions
if we look across broader areas,” he told
OGJ.
Species do not respect boundaries,
he explained. They may return once oil
and gas operations are complete, but
BLM also needs to determine where
wildlife would relocate during the
interim, he said.
“Will it reduce lawsuits later on?
For the people interested in achieving a
solution, yes. For those who aren’t, no.
But the fact is that we need to take this
more thorough approach because it’s
the right thing to do,” Caswell said.

Drilling permit charge
The proposed budget also notes that
BLM will continue charging $4,000 for
each onshore drilling permit application that it processes. It began collecting these fees on Jan. 2 after the charge
became a part of DOI’s FY 2008 budget
during congressional negotiations in
December.
The agency estimates that the fee will
raise $22.5 million before its authorization expires on Sept. 30. BLM not only
seeks repeal of the 2005 Energy Policy
Act (EPACT) provision that bans this
charge, but also requests authorization
to increase it to $4,150 while the rulemaking is developed.
The agency has identified other areas
where it can use such charges to reduce
costs, but none of them involve oil and
gas, Caswell said. It intends to continue
the permit processing program under the energy pilot office project that
EPACT authorized because it is working
very well, he indicated.
The budget request also includes an
$11.2 million increase to $17.1 million
for BLM’s well remediation program on
Alaska’s North Slope and a $2 million

reduction in the oil shale management
program because most of its environmental impact statement activities will
be completed this year. It proposes
redirecting $400,000 from the oil
shale program to oil and gas inspections to build on a $2 million increase
for FY 2008. Funding for natural gas
hydrates research would be reduced by
$425,000.
BLM’s budget request also assumes
congressional authorization of oil and
gas leasing within the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge during FY 2009, which
would generate an estimated $7 billion
of bonus receipts from an initial lease
sale in 2010. Kempthorne said this
merely moves ANWR leasing back by a
year and continues administration support for opening the area.
Asked about other opportunities
to increase access to domestic energy
resources, the secretary mentioned
reduced environmental impacts from
operations. “We’ve learned a lot about
oil and gas development onshore,
particularly reducing the footprint per
well from 8-10 acres to about a half
acre. Also, we’ve learned techniques in
Alaska to apply onshore in the Lower
48 states, such as using wooden pallets
for roads. Interestingly, these pallets do
not require extensive land restoration
but retain moisture which encourage
sagebrush growth,” he said.

MMS budget highlights
The $307 million that DOI is requesting for MMS in FY 2009 includes
$160.4 million in current appropriations ($660,000 less than in FY 2008)
and $146.7 million in offsetting collections from rental receipts and cost
recovery fees. For the first time, the
budget would separate offsetting collections (comprised of $133.7 million in
rental receipts) from the estimated $13
million of cost recoveries, which would
no longer be capped so MMS can retain
all of the collected fees.
The proposed budget seeks $8.5
million more to implement the agency’s
5-year OCS oil and gas leasing program,
which went into effect on July 1, 2007;
$1.1 million more to acquire and maintain geoscientific interpretive tools; and
$8.6 million less for the OCS Connect
System, which provides an electronic
interface between MMS and its customers because the system will be largely
improved by FY 2009.
MMS also would receive $2 million
to improve its compliance and audit
program by implementing recommendations from DOI’s Office of Inspector
General. Of that amount, $1.5 million
would be used to develop a risk-based
compliance tool that would select
properties to be reviewed based on
additional risk factors such as chronic

erroneous reporting or possible fraudulent reporting. Oil spill research funding
would be reduced by $180,000 to $6.1
million because of operating efficiency
improvements.
Kempthorne said he saw no conflict
between MMS’s Chukchi Sea lease sale,
which was scheduled for Feb. 6, and
the US Fish and Wildlife Service’s decision whether to list the polar bear as
an endangered species, which has been
delayed until later this month. When
FWS began to examine the situation, it
identified melting sea ice as the primary
threat and not oil and gas operations,
he said.
Leases would be at least 25 miles
offshore, he noted. “The initial production, in all likelihood, would be 10-15
years from now during which there
would be extensive public comment,”
the secretary said.
DOI’s Ocean and Coastal Frontiers
Initiative also includes a $4 million
component to assist in mapping and
defining US jurisdiction of the extended
OCS.
The US Geological Survey would
work with the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration to map the
sea bed. Kempthorne said this will occur even if the Senate does not ratify US
participation in the international Law of
the Sea treaty, but added that talks are
continuing to make this happen. ✦

US MMS director defends leasing in Chukchi Sea
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Oil and gas activity in Alaska’s
Chukchi Sea can occur without threatening polar bears, US Minerals Management Service Director Randall B. Luthi
said just a day after environmental and
Alaska Native groups sued to block a
Feb. 6 lease sale.
“The two activities are compatible.
Energy production can occur while
maintaining strong polar bear populations,” Luthi said in an op-ed article

posted Feb. 1 on the US Department of
Interior agency’s web site. The groups
sued in federal district court in Alaska
on Jan. 31.
Exploration and initial development
will occur only with the approval of the
US Fish and Wildlife Service, another
DOI agency, and must be in open water
at least 25 miles from shore, he continued. Although a spill is unlikely, MMS
recognizes that the potential for such
an event exists and would require lessees to have containment and recovery
equipment available, Luthi said.

“Leasing is just a first step in the
energy development process. Actual
production in the Chukchi Sea realistically is 10-15 years in the future, and
will not occur without many environmental reviews, public commentary and
application of environmental protections,” he indicated.
The record of MMS in protecting the
environment while providing access to
the nation’s offshore energy resources is
good, Luthi continued. A 2002 National
Academy of Sciences study found that

0.001% of oil produced in US waters
was spilled, he said. “The same study
reported that 150 times more oil enters
the ocean every day from natural cracks
in the ocean floor than through oil and
gas activities,” Luthi said.

Sale timing questioned
Luthi reiterated several points he
made when he testified Jan. 17 before
the US House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming
(OGJ, Jan. 28, 2008, p. 26). The chairman of that committee, Rep. Edward J.
Markey (D-Mass.), questioned whether
MMS should proceed with the Chukchi
Sea sale before FWS decided whether to
list the polar bear as an endangered species. US Senate Environment and Public
Works Committee Chairwoman Barbara
Boxer (D-Calif.) raised the same point
in a Jan. 30 hearing of that committee
(OGJ Online, Feb. 1, 2008).
Luthi noted in his Feb. 1 article that
the polar bear already is subject to
stricter regulation under the Marine
Mammal Protection Act than it would
receive under the Endangered Species
Act. Bear dens must be protected, and
no action is allowed that would have
more than a negligible impact. If FWS
decides to list the animal as threatened,
energy exploration and other potential
activities would occur only after requirements of an ESA listing were met,
the MMS director said.
“Over the past 30 years, MMS has
funded nearly $300 million for environmental studies in Alaska waters and
scientific research of marine mammals,
including the polar bear. Annually since
2000, we have benefited from 30-40
environmental studies, some focused
specifically on polar bears. We now
know more about the bear and its habitat requirements, which will help in the
long-term survival of the species,” Luthi
said.
A Chukchi Sea lease sale was included in both the 2002-07 and 2007-12
US Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas
leasing program, which were subject
to rigorous congressional and public
scrutiny, he continued. “Congress did

not take action to disapprove either
program,” he said.
“Our decision comes down to the
bare necessities: Where do we want to
get our energy? Having a domestic supply is far more reliable and secure than
relying upon foreign sources. Can we
develop domestic supplies and provide
protection for the environment and

wildlife, including polar bears? Yes, we
can and should,” Luthi maintained.

Native village impacts
But the 10 environmental organizations and three Alaska Native villages
said in their lawsuit that MMS failed to
adequately consider leasing impacts not
only on polar bears but also on North

UK lawmakers call for moratorium on biofuel targets
Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
The UK should impose a moratorium on its biofuels targets because they
are jeopardizing reliable food supply in
developing countries and harming the
environment, a group of UK parliament
members has recommended.
In a report analyzing government
policy, the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) said not all biofuels are
sustainable, and targets should not be
implemented at a national and European level if this contributes to rainforest
destruction and competition for land
use.
“Biofuels are generally an expensive
and ineffective way to cut greenhouse
gas emissions when compared to other
policies,” EAC said. “Emissions from
road transport can be cut cost-effectively and with lower environmental
risk by implementing a range of other
policies.”
The committee recommended that
the government focus on sustainable

biofuels such as waste vegetable oil and
improving sustainable biofuels technologies.
The report also found that increasing
biofuels use in the energy mix as “an
environmentally sound” solution posed
a conflict because biofuels require fossil
fuels for their production.
“Advanced second generation biofuels may have an important role in the
future, but these technologies are some
years away.” said Tim Yeo, chairman of
EAC. “The government should support
their development by creating a stable
investment climate out to 2020.”
By April, the UK wants 2.5% of
gasoline and diesel to be drawn from
biofuels—rising to 5% by 2010. The
EU wants to raise this to 10% by 2020.
Presently, biofuels account for 1% of
transport fuel in the UK.
BP PLC, DuPont, and Associated British Foods have proposed the construction of a 420 million l./year bioethanol
plant using wheat as feedstock at Saltend, Hull, UK. Operations are to begin
late 2009.

The analysis is a dampener in the
government’s approach to find alternate
sources of energy as demand soars and
greenhouse gases rise due to the burning of fossil fuels. The report follows
recent similar criticisms from the European Commission’s scientific community, which has questioned the impact
on the environment of producing crops
for energy use.
As competition from overseas
producers rises, however, any delay in
supporting the fledgling industry could
be damaging, critics said. The National
Farmers Union stressed that biofuels
represent the only renewable alternative
for replacing fossil fuel in transport and
tackling one quarter of the UK’s carbon
emissions.
BP also has teamed with UK-based
D1 Oils to launch a global joint venture
to plant, over 4 years, 1 million hectares of jatropha curcas, an oilseed tree
that grows in tropical and subtropical
regions and produces inedible vegetable
oil for biodiesel. ✦

Shell Oil’s Hofmeister calls for US cap on CO2 emissions
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
Shell has implemented voluntary reductions on emissions from its refineries, said Shell Oil Co. Pres. John Hofmeister, who is calling for governments
to set mandatory limits on greenhouse
gas emissions.

Speaking at a Rice University forum
on carbon dioxide in Houston Jan. 31,
Hofmeister said governments must
take the lead in establishing regulatory
frameworks within which companies
can compete equally.
“And we don’t have that yet today
in the United States of America and
in many countries around the world,”

he said. “Government leadership is
necessary to establish what those
standards should be. This is one reason
why Shell is publicly, nationally calling
for a United States cap on all sorts of
emissions, but primarily CO2, so that
companies have to work in harmony to
achieve that.”

Iraq to beneﬁt from higher oil revenues, report says
Eric Watkins
Senior Correspondent
The Iraqi government could earn an
extra $19.2 billion in revenues this year
because of higher oil prices and the
revival of the country’s oil industry, according to a US government report.
The increased revenues are supported
by figures set out in the latest quarterly
report from Stuart Bowen, the special
inspector general for Iraq reconstruction, who is accountable to the US
Congress.
Bowen’s report says Iraq’s budget
plans are being drawn up on the assumption of an average international
crude price of $64/bbl in 2008 but that
the actual figure likely will be $85/bbl.
Concerning Iraq’s rise in revenues,
Bowen’s report says the country’s average oil production this past quarter
reached a postwar quarterly record of
2.38 million b/d, while average exports
maintained the previous quarter’s 1.94
million b/d record.
“Taken together, these developments
could cause a significant rise in available
revenue for [Iraq] in 2008 and further
underscore the need for [Iraq’s government] to pass the pending hydrocarbon
law,” the report said.
Iraq’s 2008 budget is about $48
billion, an increase of 18% over 2007,

32

with more than 84% funded by oil
revenues.
The potential increase in revenues
brought by higher oil prices could
generate a national income windfall
for Iraq, providing new funds for Iraq’s
relief and reconstruction.

Postwar output record
The report said Iraq’s record quarter
oil production was tied to increases in
output in northern Iraq. Production
from this region reached its highest
level since the start of the war, averaging
492,000 b/d, a rise of more than 123%
from the same period in 2006.
The record exports during the most
recent quarter virtually matched last
quarter’s postwar high, and was 31%
higher than the quarterly average for
the same time in 2006, the report said.
Iraqi exports through the Ceyhan
pipeline, averaging 360,000 b/d,
were the highest for any quarter in the
postwar period. “Increased security,
more effective repair efforts, and added
redundancy have increased export
capabilities from the northern pipeline
system,” the report said.
Exports from the Al Basrah oil terminal in southern Iraq remained relatively
steady last year, with the 2007 average
increasing by 3% from 2006.
Iraq lacks the domestic refining
infrastructure to supply its population

with refined fuels such as gasoline,
kerosene, and diesel. Moreover, current
storage levels of refined fuels are insufficient to meet the estimated winter
demand.
The US and Iraq have thus taken
some steps to increase supply, planning to install two 70,000 b/d refining
units at the Doura refinery, which could
increase daily refinery production by
156%.

Pipeline security
Pipeline security programs are
boosting the country’s oil exports and
its income. The Infrastructure Security
Protection (ISP) Program, funded by
the Economic Support Fund, provided
$110 million for oil pipeline exclusion
zones (PEZ) to prevent the illegal tapping and attacks on pipelines.
Oil PEZ projects are under way from
Baiji to Kirkuk, Baghdad to Kerbala,
and Baiji to Baghdad, the report said.
“When completed next spring, the
80-km PEZ from Kirkuk to the Baiji oil
refinery will potentially save the GOI
more than $30 million/day and ensure
the delivery of 700,000 b/d to the
market.”
This PEZ project, which was started in mid-July 2007, appears to be
facilitating the consistent export of
oil through Turkey. The reduction in
interdictions has helped contribute to

the rise in exported oil; similar results
are expected when the Baghdad-to-Baiji
PEZ is completed.
Iraq has yet to implement hydrocarbon legislation, which, among
other things, would define rules for
oil revenue distribution and foreign
investment. The legislation was originally slated for adoption in 2006, but
the legislative timetable has repeatedly
slipped since then.
The framework law is currently with
the Council of Representatives, but no
action had occurred as of the end of
2007, and the three supporting laws
have yet to be submitted for parliamentary approval.
The Kurdistan Regional Government
(KRG) passed its own law in August
2007, which the GOI declared illegal,
stating that companies conducting business with the KRG may face legal action

RECOVERY METHODS

™

September 30 – October 2, 2008
Hilton Fort Worth
Fort Worth, Texas USA

THE RETHINKING CONTINUES
By rethinking recovery methods, producers have brought to a hungry market gas from reservoirs once considered economically and
technically impossible. Tight sands, shales, and coalbeds now represent large and growing sources of an essential form of clean energy.
But they’re still unconventional. The reservoirs are complex. The costs of drilling into and completing
wells in them are high and rising. They present unique environmental problems.
Producing gas from unconventional reservoirs proﬁtably, safely, and in amounts demanded by the
market requires continuous rethinking – the kind of thinking that shoves back limits on what’s possible
with gas supply.
Rethinking of recovery methods will continue Sept. 30 – Oct. 2, 2008, at the Unconventional Gas
International Conference & Exhibition at the Hilton Fort Worth in Fort Worth, Texas. Planned by editors
of Oil & Gas Journal and an advisory board of industry experts, the event will highlight innovation
from unconventional gas plays around the world. It will be your chance to meet and learn from other
professionals in the fastest-growing sector of the gas-producing industry.
So mark your calendar.

Heritage Oil Corp., Calgary, and
Tullow Oil PLC are attempting to tap
Uganda’s first oil discoveries in what
could become Africa’s next oil production megaproject.
Seismic and drilling are ramping up
in the Lake Albert rift basin with expectations of reaching commercial status
and identifying sufficient reserves to
support construction of a pipeline some
1,300 km to the Indian Ocean.
The currently drilling
exploration well is expected to
reach its primary target in late
March 2008, and the outlook
for the first oil production is
in 2009.

Tullow, operator of Block 2 with
100% interest, plans to invest more
than $200 million—double its 2007
outlay—in 2008 in Uganda.
Both Tullow and Heritage hold
interests in blocks on both sides of
the lake in Uganda and remote eastern
Congo (former Zaire). Oil discoveries
so far include Kingfisher, Nzizi, Mputa,
Waraga, and Turaco, and eight wells
have been successful (OGJ, June 10,

Heritage’s Kingfisher discovery well,

A shallower 10-m interval at 1,783

objectives not penetrated by the Kingfisher discovery well.
Interpretation of the Pelican prospect, in Lake Albert off Kaiso town,

One recent announcement on enhanced oil
recovery activity is Rex
Energy’s plan for starting
two alkali-surfactantpolymer (ASP) flood
Production
pilots in an old oil field
in the Illinois basin.
Benjamin Hulburt, CEO of Rex
Energy Corp., State College, Pa., said
during a presentation to BMO Capital
Markets Corp.’s Fourth Annual Appalachian E&P Forum, Jan. 10, 2008, New
York City, that the company plans to
start ASP injection in the pilots in early
second-quarter 2008.
The pilots will be on 1-acre spacing
in Lawrence field, near Bridgeport, Ill.
(Fig. 1).
Discovered in 1906, Lawrence field
still produces about 1,800 bo/d from
1,000 wells. Hulburt said that initial oil
in place in the field, the largest in the
Illinois basin, is an estimated 1 billion
bbl of which about 400 million bbl has
been produced.

ASP process
Hulburt explained that in the ASP
process the injectant alkali reduces the
needed amount of surfactant to recover
the remaining oil in place by interacting with the injected surfactant and
rock to form additional surfactant in
the reservoir (Fig. 2). The alkali is either

O D U C T I O N

sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or soda ash
(Na2CO3) and the polymer is a polyacrylamide.
Rex Energy notes that the alkali
(1-2%) and surfactant (0.1-0.4%)
combination washes residual oil from
the reservoir mainly by reducing
interfacial tension between the oil and
the water. The polymer (800-1,400
ppm) improves sweep displacement
efficiency.
The alkali is less costly than surfactant; and therefore, using ASP reduces
the injectant costs compared with
earlier field pilots that used surfactant
and polymer without the alkali. Hulburt
said about 90% less surfactant is needed
because of the alkali injection.
He said that seven field pilots with
surfactant-polymer flooding in sands
such as in Lawrence field all had good
technical results in the 1960s and
1980s.
In the case of Marathon Oil Corp.’s
Robins lease Maraflood surfactantpolymer flood in Lawrence field, about
1 mile from the proposed pilots, the
25-acre pilot recovered 459,000 bbl
of incremental oil from 1982 to 1998
(Fig. 3). The production peaked at 370
bo/d in 1988 with the oil cut increasing to 21% up from the 1% oil cut
produced prior to the Maraflood.
Although the flood was a technical success, Hulburt said that that the
injectant cost $35/incremental bbl

successful surfactant-polymer flooding
by producing 15-25% of the incremental original oil in place; however, the
projects were not economical because
the chemical cost per incremental barrel
of oil ranged from $10-35. The high
cost was because of the large surfactant
amounts used, he said.
Rex Energy estimates that ASP flooding in the two sands could recover 84
million bbl of oil. Hulburt said the
estimate was based on 16 laboratoryrun radial core floods in each sand that
showed ASP flooding could recover
20.9% more oil from the Cypress and
24% more oil from the Bridgeport
sands.
Because of the small size of the
pilots, Hulburt noted that the pilots
should respond to the injectant in 3-4
months with peak production occurring in 6-8 months. This compares
with the 31⁄2 years that it took the larger
25-acre Marathon pilot to show a response, he said.
Hulburt estimated that the finding
and development costs for the project
will be $11/bbl with the lifting costs
being $3-4/bbl.
For the full field project, Hulburt
said Rex Energy plans to develop the
flood on 10-acre well spacing in 640
acre increments/year. He expects 12-15
months’ response times for the flooded
areas. ✦

each of the cones. Equal or nearly equal
Z’a and Nk + Δk values point to the socalled “leading” cone. If, for the leading
cone, Nk + Δk = Z’a, then iak = i, as i =
(Nk + Δk)/Zk and iak = Z’a/Zk.
If the leading cone has Nk + Δk <Z’a,
then iak >i. At Nk + Δk >Z’a, the leading
cone will have iak <i. In other words,
the leading cone may have a gear
ratio corresponding to pure rolling or
slightly more or less than that.
The term “leading” cone and the
technique used to calculate the cone
skidding rate were introduced in technical literature nearly 50 years ago. A
commonly held opinion is that during
use of a three-cone bit, the bottom-well
rack is formed by a leading cone that
controls the motion and cutting of the
other cones.1
The lead cone is usually the one that
rolls over the well bottom almost without skidding2 or the one with the least
number of the teeth on the heel row.3

This choice of leading cone is made
without ascertaining the real nature of
its destination2 3 or based upon the assumption that the heel row teeth with
maximum pitch display the highest
kinetic energy and, consequently, they
should form the deeper rack.4
Such assumption can hardly be admitted because the difference between
the maximum and minimum pitch of
the bit cone heel teeth is only 2-3 mm
and therefore the difference cannot, to
any significant extent, affect the value of
the kinetic energy of the teeth.
In addition, even if there exists some
difference in the kinetic energy of the
teeth, the intensity of the grinding, and
the depth of the bottom rack craters
will be determined by the cone with
the lowest kinetic energy.

but that does not correspond either to
theory or experiment. Consequently, it
is reasonable to assert that the shortened
length of the crater does not impede the
teeth skidding because of the additional
destruction that enlarges the crater. It is
unlikely that a tooth capable of forming a crater might not partially destroy
a crater weakened from residual stresses
and strains.
Actually, the reason for the “leading”
features displayed by one or another
cone is seen by comparing the estimated number of the rack teeth for a 120º
rotation with the estimated number of
teeth for the same rack which might
be individually formed by each of the

= ((ΣNk) –5)/3), the leading cone
becomes the one with the lowest estimated number of rack teeth, Nk + Δk,
i.e., the cone with the maximum heel
teeth pitch.
At Z’a = ((ΣNk) –1)/3, the “leading” cone may be the one that has the
maximum heel teeth pitch or that with
the mean pitch size, depending upon
which of them corresponds to the Nk +
Δk value closest to Z’a.
At Z’a max = Z’a6 = ((ΣNk) +1)/3, the
“leading” role will always be taken by
the cone with the mean value of the
heel teeth pitch.
Consequently, the most probable
candidate for the “leading” role is the
cone with the maximum heel teeth
pitch size. The cone with minimum
heel teeth pitch size may never be the
lead. It will always rotate at a slowing
speed.
Here, it needs to be emphasized that
for a single bit, depending upon the
number of the rack teeth, Z’a, formed
in the given conditions (which may
vary, as shown later), the leading role
will be taken by the cone with either
maximum or medium heel teeth pitch.
Besides, change in Z’a value may result
in transformation of the “leading” cone,
i.e., for one Z’a value the “leading” role
may be taken, e.g., by the first cone
while for another Z’a value the “leading” role may be taken by the second
cone, or vice versa.

Apparent skidding
We need to explain the reason for
the term “apparent cone skidding” per
revolution of the bit, as used previously.
Since the well-bottom rack consists
of three different sections, rotational
speed of each cone per revolution of
the bit will change three times.
Actually, when the cone rolls in its
own sector, there is zero or minimal
skidding.
In the other two sectors, which have
been rolled by the other two cones,
some slowing or acceleration of the
cone rotation takes place. This means

row with the pitch tk rolls over the
“alien” sector at a slowed-down rate,
then Equation 20 may written slightly
differently, as shown by Equation 21.
Let’s verify the validity of these
equalities that reflect the actual slide
path of the heel row of the cone when
it moves along the “alien” sector, proceeding from the apparent values of the
slide path.
As we proceed from Equations 15
and 16, we follow the analysis shown in
Box 2 and reach Equation 22.
A comparison of Equation 22 with
Equations 21 and 20 makes their complete identity obvious, the only difference being that the actual slide path
for the heel row of the cone along the
“alien” sector is found as the arithmetic sum of the completing tooth’s slide
path while the apparent value of the
same path is the algebraic sum of the
same components.
It means that if the direction of slide
for the row and the completing tooth
in the given sector is the same (both for
slow-down and acceleration), then the
apparent slide path will correspond to
the actual path. Otherwise, the apparent
value of the slide path for the heel row
of the cone along the “alien” sector will
be less than that of the actual path.

Actual slide path
In the general form, the apparent
slide path value for the heel row of the
cone per revolution of the bit should be
put down as S*k–n = ± Sk + S*k–m + S*k-n,
while the actual value should be S = Sk
+ Sk–m + Sk–n, where: S*k–m = ±Smk, S*k–n
= ±Snk ±Snz, Sk–m = Smk +Smz, and Sk–n =
Snk + Snz, i.e., S* is shown by Equation
23, and consequently, S*≤S.
Equation 23 shows that the slide
path for the heel rows of the cones per
revolution of the bit (with different
pitch of the heel teeth for all cones)
changes five times. Consequently, to calculate the slide path for a single tooth
of the given row of the cone, a differentiating approach should be used. There
is no sense in determining the value of
a single tooth slide dividing the row’s
slide path per revolution of the cone by
the number of the teeth in the given
row. So, the slide path for the heel row
of the cone during its movement along
its “own” sector, as mentioned above,
would fall at the completing tooth. It
means that the slide path of this tooth
would be equal to the value Sk, as
shown in Equation 24.
The other teeth, (Zrk – 1), would
move along their “own” sector without
any skidding.

When the cone moves along the
“alien” sectors, the slide paths of individual teeth would be expressed as
shown in Equation 25.
Thus, per revolution of the bit (Zrk
– 2), the teeth of the given cone’s row
would skid on the alien sectors of the
rack due to the difference in the pitch
values of the heel teeth of the cones.
If the apparent gear ratio for the
given cone is equal or close to 1.5, then
any two of its diametrically opposed
heel teeth will constantly perform as
the completing teeth, differing in that
at each revolution of the bit, one of the
teeth would slip on its own and alien
sectors of the rack, while the others
would slip only on the alien sector. The
roles of the cones will change at each
revolution of the bit. In this case, similarly to the case considering the cones
with equal number of the heel teeth,
wear of the teeth rows of the given
cone will be uneven.
Yet, if the apparent value of the gear
ratio for the given cone differs to a sufficient extent from 1.5, then its completing teeth would change after each
revolution of the cone, and that would
promote uniform wear of the cone’s
teeth.
However, the bit performance data

will be predominantly determined
rather by the actual value of the teeth
slide path than by the extent of wear
uniformity.
Table 1 represents the estimated data
for such values as actual number of the
rack teeth Z’a, the apparent and actual
gear ratios for the cones iak, ik–k, ik–m, and
ik-n, the apparent and actual slide paths
of the heel rows Sk, S*k–m, S*k–n, Sk–m,
Sk–n, S*, and S, the actual slide paths for
individual heel teeth Skz, Sk–mz, Smz, Sk–nz,
and Snz calculated for commercial bits
B-151T, B-190T, K-190T, and K-214T,
according to the Equations 7, 9, 10, 19,
20, and 22-25. The validity of Equations
9 and 10 may be verified by the equivalent Equations 11-14, 17, 18a, and 18b.
The same table presents, for comparison, values of the teeth row slide paths
per revolution of the bit Sx, the specific
slide of the row S’x, and the slide paths
of a single tooth SZx calculated by the
known formulas6 shown in Equations
26-28.
Following the above-mentioned
and analyzing the data from Table 1,
we come to the conclusion that Equations 26-28 are not quite acceptable for
toothed cone bits because they do not
give the sought true values.
Actually, as we have found, the slide
path of the toothed heel rows of each
of the three cones changes five times
per revolution of the bit, but taking
into account that in their “own” sector
(Zrk – 1) the teeth are rolling without
skidding (i.e., ia = i and S = 0), the gear
ratio for the cone per revolution of the
bit will change six times. Consequently,
the position of the instantaneous axis of
the cone rotation will change the same
six times.
However, Equations 26-28 include
the apparent value of the cone’s gear
ratio which does not take into consideration the multiple changes in its rotational speed, i.e., the formulas consider
even rotation of the cones per revolution of the bit and a constant position
of their instantaneous axes of rotation.
Consequently, the presented known correlations, excluding the expression of a
single tooth slide path (Equation 28),

are acceptable, strictly speaking, only
for bits with smooth-tapered cones.
In the next part of this series, to be
published Feb. 25, 2008, we’ll discuss
one more aspect of the rock bit kinematics. ✦

the motivating and initial goal of this
study, the real economic incentive is
savings in refinery fuel burned. We estimated this at roughly 6 times the value
of CO2 emissions saved based on $15/
ton CO2 and $68/bbl of crude.
The upper sedimentary layer in the
West Netherlands basin is not thermally
or geomechanically interesting for
creating a geothermal heat exchanger;
however, the underlying deformed
sediment layer and expected depth to
basement of 8-10 km are favorable for
the required temperatures, fracturing,
and drilling prospects.
Considerable savings are possible if
low-enthalpy waste water was injected
for geothermal recovery. This makes
most efficient use for obtaining highquality heat, as compared to a previous
EOR water-flooding proposal.
The combination of favorable geothermal gradient, large petrochemical
plant or refinery, and the subsurface
uncertainties means that the risks are
considerable although the rewards are
potentially high. The proposed scheme
thus requires considerable research and
development before it is an economically viable process.

Geothermal energy
Heat obtained from geothermal energy is more efficiently used for directly
powering petrochemical and refining
processes rather than for electricity
48

generation. Significant reductions in
CO2 emissions from burning fuel are
possible. The savings, however, from not
burning refinery fuel are even greater.
If refinery waste water is injected,
then the subsurface geothermal heat
exchanger fracture network is more
efficient.
The relatively low temperatures that
are obtained and, therefore, the low
efficiency thermal-to-electric energy
conversion hampers use of geothermal energy for electricity generation.1
Recently, a study proposed using EOR
flooding water (OGJ, Sept. 5, 2005, p.
34) to generate electrical power. The
process is still relatively inefficient. It is
more efficient to use this water directly
to power chemical conversion processes
because this can reduce fuel burned.
Such a direct integration of an
upstream and downstream process has
not, to our knowledge, been proposed
within the oil and gas industry. One
can remove the inefficiencies associated
with electricity generation by applying
the heat obtained from geothermal operations directly to downstream oil and
gas processing on a refinery scale.

CO2 reduction

To reduce CO2 emissions from a
refinery means reducing hydrocarbons
burned.2 Biofuels, for example, is a step

ues range from a standard $15/ton to
the high values maintained in countries
like Norway. Assuming that 1 bbl of
oil roughly yields 0.4 tons of CO2, in
a high CO2-tariff ($50/ton) country
like Norway, if the oil price is $50/bbl,
then the associated CO2 penalty is $20,
which is 40% of the value of the crude.
There are some scenarios in which
the value of CO2 saved exceeds fuel
savings. Given higher crude prices, all
except the most extreme CO2 valuations

unknown.7 8 The thickness of the upper
nondeformed sandstone sedimentary
layer is about 4 km. We therefore estimate the lower deformed sedimentary
carbonate at about 4-km thick.
For heat-recovery purposes we focus
on these deeper deformed carbonates.
These folded, faulted, and fractured carbonate rocks are the target for drilling
geothermal wells and represent many
opportunities that have not been investigated. They might have pre-existing
fracture networks that can be used for
circulating between wells.
The main costs associated with
geothermal programs are drilling, but
we are considering pre-existing oil
production facilities. It is, however, easy
to drill through sedimentary rock. The
sandstone and underlying carbonates in
the West Netherlands basin have much
higher permeabilities than the sedimentary layer above traditional geothermal
operations. This leads to higher rates
of penetration that will reduce drilling
costs.
Although granite has a very low
permeability, the candidate sedimentary region we have identified has a
higher permeability than granite. The
undeformed sedimentary layer on top
is principally sandstone, which shows
decreasing permeability with depth.
The underlying deformed sediment,
however, consists mostly of fractured
carbonates with a higher porosity and
should be easier to drill.
We compared the extra cost of drilling fewer wells to a greater depth with
the costs of more shallow wells. A recent study provides an estimate of well
costs using a polynomial (Equation 4).9
When we combine this with the
number of wells required (Fig. 3) and
the corresponding depths from Fig. 1,
there is a slight decrease in well costs,
to 6 from 4, but after that it gets rapidly
more expensive.
Estimated well cost is $70 million.
Assuming the normal 25 years life with
a 25% operational cost add-on we obtain $3.1/Mwth-hr.
This compares favorably with classic
combustion-generated heating. The cost
52

of refinery fuel is typically about 10%
of the oil price ($68/bbl) so that current combustion-based heating costs are
around $3.7/Mwth-hr.
There are therefore too many uncertainties to make a clear-cut basis for
applying geothermal heat for refinery
power. Oil prices would have to be
stable at higher prices to justify wholesale refinery plant modifications. ✦

The second model considers a
100-m imperfection caused by the high
bending stiffness of the pipes, using
the same imperfection heights used in
the first model. Fig. 4 shows the critical temperatures from both numerical
and analytical approaches. As shown in
Figs. 3 and 4, the critical temperature
increased due to the high bending stiffness of the PIP system in comparison
with the single pipe, and the analytical
solutions match reasonably well with
the numerical solutions.

Limitations
Equation 4 requires an initial deformation of the pipeline in a PIP system
comparable to the initial imperfection
of the seabed. A short imperfection
combined with bending stiffness, however, causes suspension of the pipeline
around its toes to deviate from the
shape of the seabed.
A given lifting height off a flat seabed requires the pipeline be suspended

under its submerged weight. Equation
6 estimates the suspended pipe length
corresponding to height, δ.
Numerical models developed for an
imperfection height of 0.8 m verified the minimum length of the initial
imperfection applicable for Equation 4.
Both the numerical model and analytical help calculate the critical temperature under the submerged weight of
pipes. Figs. 5a and b show the results
for the first and second models, respectively.
The minimum length from Equation
6 can act as a cut-off point for Equation 4, below which the shape of pipe
is dominated by its bending stiffness

and the critical temperatures are more
or less the same. Equation 7 calculates
the critical compressive load leading to
upheaval buckling under a given initial
imperfection in these circumstances.
Equations 6 and 7 apply to partially
or fully buried offshore pipelines. They
also apply to a single pipe in which
only the bending stiffness of the pipe
is considered. Pipelines laid on seabed,
however, are likely to experience lateral
buckling, making these equations not
applicable.

mal stresses in the inner pipe of a PIP
system with high design temperatures.
Expansion loops place the outer casing
pipe segments between the loops under
tension during operation. These tension forces tend to increase the critical
temperature and reduce the buckling
potential of the PIP system. Equation
8 provides the maximum compressive
load of a PIP system with intermediate
spools.
A bulkhead typically installed in the
straight segment near the spool connects the inner and outer pipes. Equation 9 provides the bulkhead’s equilibrium.
Soil restraints in the axial direction
also control the outer pipe’s end displacement at the spool (Equation 10).
The effective length, LE, in Equation
10 represents no more than the half
spacing of intermediate spools (Equation 11).
A PIP system designed for high temperatures functions best when the outer
pipe is put in tension (i.e., P2 > 0) by
choosing a relatively short interval for
intermediate spools (Le = 0.5Ls).
Pipeline engineering casts the axial
resistance from the expansion loop,
Rspool, as negligible, simplifying Equation 8 as Equation 12.
Equation 12 calculates the maximum
compressive force, Pmax, for a selected
spacing, Ls, in the PIP system. A maximum force larger than the critical load,
Pcr, from Equation 7, requires reduction
of the spacing between the spools. Fig.
6 shows the maximum compressive

force in the PIP system from the simplified and numerical approaches. Neglecting the resistance from the spool makes
the maximum compressive force from
the simplified approach slightly less
than from the numerical.
Equations 8-12 also apply to a PIP
system with a dogleg; spacing Ls acting
as the distance between the dogleg and
adjacent expansion loop or another
dogleg in a short PIP system without an
intermediate spool.

Design example
Engineering offshore pipelines without intermediate spools uses a given
temperature of the medium and a seabed profile derived from a site survey.
Equation 5 can calculate the maximum
compressive force, while Equation 6
calculates the minimum length for the
pipeline in conformance with the hilltype seabed. Equation 7 calculates the
downward restraints required for the
system to avoid upheaval buckling.
Partially exposed pipelines on the
seabed use the submerged weight of
the pipe and medium as the downward
restraint. Buried pipelines use the submerged weight of the pipe and medium
as well as the soil over the pipe.
Model 1 in Table 1 represents pipelines crossing a 70-m imperfection on
the seabed with 0.5 m and 1.0 m soil
covers, respectively. Equation 7 calculates the critical temperatures, shown in
Fig. 7 for three heights of imperfection
along with results from the finiteelement approach. The results show the

PIP system can transport oil at a temperature up to 120° C., a typical burial
depth of 1.0 m, and a corresponding
slope of imperfection is 0.011 (0.38-m
high and 35-m long).
If the slope of the imperfection is
more than 0.011, burying the pipeline
deep into the seabed around the hill
top (overbend of the pipeline) provides
the most effective means of preventing
bucking. Doing so not only reduces the
height of the initial imperfection, but
also increases the downward restraints.
Concrete mats, sand bags, or cobbles
placed on top of the pipeline at the
hilltop can also act as restraining means.
A very hard seabed where hydraulic
jetting is not possible might use preplough or trenching equipments to
reduce the imperfection.
Equation 7 verifies the effectiveness
of the chosen means. ✦

March 3 – 5, 2008 / Moody Gardens Hotel & Convention Center, Galveston, Texas

SUBSEA TIEBACK
Forum & Exhibition

PennWell invites you back to the 8th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition.
SSTB has become the premier event for one of the fastest growing field
development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March 3 – 5, 2008 in
Galveston, TX at the Moody Gardens Hotel & Conference Center. Over 2,000
people and 150 exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference.You can’t
afford to miss it.
As our industry confronts new challenges, it has never been more important
to submerse yourself in them. This year’s theme is “Subsea is here, the game
is changing.” As our game changes, the sharing of knowledge and collective
experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety,
and economics of the subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by
industry leaders. As in the past, only by participating in this conference will you
be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will not be published and no
Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room
stays inside the conference room. We hope you will join us.

Like energy bill,
stimulus package
misses the target
The economic stimulus initiative pushing its way through the US Congress has
much in common with last year’s energy
bill. It’s superﬁcial and insufﬁcient, probably
harmful.
The Energy Independence and Security
Act of 2007 hiked the mandate for renewable vehicle fuel and raised fuel-economy
standards for new cars and trucks.
The worst part of the new law isn’t that

it will raise vehicle prices; there’s at least
compensation in the hope for improved
mileage. The worst part isn’t even that an
elevated ethanol mandate will boost prices
of food and fuel, aggravate air pollution
in some areas, and sap federal and state
treasuries without delivering on promises
about extending energy supply.
The worst part of the new energy law
is how the US has heaved off its freemarket moorings, resorted to government
remedies with demonstrable ﬂaws, and
congratulated itself for acting on energy
without meaningfully and affordably enhancing supply.
The stimulus package looks like smoke
from the same ﬁre.
At this writing, the Senate was deliberating legislation passed by the House that
would inject $160 billion into the stuttering
US economy with tax rebates and temporary tax cuts.
That’s $160 billion in a $14 trillion
economy.
If a sudden slug of dollars really can
turn the US economy away from jeopardy,
timing is surely important.
Yet the president and lawmakers seem
to care only about paying out the cash as
quickly as possible. By the time the checks
arrive, the economy could look much different—maybe, for example, more vulnerable
to inﬂation—than it does now.
With the federal budget in deﬁcit, the
dollars will represent debt, not new wealth.
When all is said and done, the deﬁcit will
linger, fuel and food prices still will be high,
and individuals and businesses will remain
fretful about a huge tax increase in 2010
unless Congress makes permanent the rate
cuts of 2001 and 2003.
Like the energy bill, the stimulus package represents dangerous tokenism.
It’s the product of a government that
should quit posing as the solution to all
economic problems and start addressing the problems its own mistakes have
caused.

Mideast demand up as OPEC holds output
As expected, ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
made no production changes at their Feb. 1 meeting in Vienna, despite pressure
from the US and other large consuming countries to increase output.
OPEC ministers repeated their frequent assertion that current production is sufﬁcient to satisfy demand through the ﬁrst quarter of 2008 and promised to monitor
markets until their next meeting Mar. 5. The assumption they would take no action
was already priced into the market prior to the meeting. OPEC’s inaction could offset
recent reports of US crude inventories steadily building above consensus expectations, and crude may continue to hover in the $90/bbl range, said analysts in the
Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc. However, they said, “We expect
incremental Middle Eastern cargoes to hit the market over the remainder of the ﬁrst
quarter, potentially causing further crude weakness in the short term.”
Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland, noted Nigeria’s export
program for March will be constrained by maintenance, but Iraq has resumed oil
exports via its Kirkuk pipeline. “Saudi Arabia has conﬁrmed to be leaking above
quota, and [very large crude carrier] activity and freight rates have started this week
to rebound in the Arabian Gulf,” he said Feb. 1.
In a 2008 commodities report by Barclays Capital, the investment banking division of Barclays Bank PLC, analysts said, “We expect OPEC policy to remain cautious, and we expect non-OPEC supply to again disappoint relative to consensus
expectations. ...We expect prices to move up signiﬁcantly in the second half of the
year, with economic pessimism providing more of a brake earlier in the year.”
Middle East demand
While the lion’s share of OPEC’s production is from its Middle East members, economic development in that area and Asia also has escalated world demand for crude.
“In 2007, the three countries with the greatest absolute increase in oil demand were,
in order, China, Saudi Arabia, and India. We expect the same three countries to be the
main sources of demand growth in 2008. Indeed, China, India and the Middle East as a
whole were responsible for virtually all net global oil demand growth in 2007, and we
would expect that pattern to also continue into 2008,” said Barclays Capital analysts.
They see global demand growth accelerating to 1.7% in 2008 from 1.2% in 2007.
“A visible weakening of oil demand growth relative to the pattern of the past 3 years
does seem to require...an economic discontinuity larger than anything that is currently envisaged,” analysts said.
Middle East demand is growing because of high oil prices funneling cash into
that area where government subsidies reduce domestic costs of petroleum products.
Demand growth in that region could fall if there were a large drop in international oil
prices. “However, in that case, one would expect increased demand from elsewhere
to compensate for the decline in growth in the Middle East,” Barclays Capital said.
“In other words, almost half of global growth in 2007 came from a region where the
direct short-term linkages to the Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development members’ economic performance can be expected to be rather weak.”
Barclays Capital analysts said, “OECD demand is expected to remain weak for the
fourth straight year, but it has lost virtually all of its ability to occupy the margin of
the market and to be a signiﬁcant price driver.”
A fundamental rut
The world oil market has “settled into a fairly comfortable and well-worn groove
over the past 3 years in terms of its fundamental balances,” said Barclays Capital
analysts. “Indeed, the key dynamics on both the supply and the demand side of the
market have scarcely changed at all across 2005-2007. It has been that constancy and
the associated failure to generate any additional headroom within the short-term
market or any additional level of comfort about longer-term balances that has helped
prices to continue their drift upwards at all points along the curve.”
Therefore, they said, “The rise in prices has been less about anything happening in a dynamic fashion to push prices up and has been more to do with things not
happening. The failure of rising prices to loosen global balances in any signiﬁcant
way has been a key component of reducing resistance to the gradual and concerted
move up. The key question for 2008 is, then, whether any of the key trends that have
continued so stubbornly over the past 3 years are likely to show signs of losing
purchases.”

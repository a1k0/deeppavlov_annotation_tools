COVER
A rig operated by Chesapeake Energy Corp. drills near downtown
Fort Worth. Some of the Barnett shale lies beneath urban Tarrant
County, home to more than 60 municipalities and 1.7 million people. Hydraulic fracturing, traditionally a state-regulated
practice, is under intensifying scrutiny by several federal legislators.
The Drilling and the Environment special report, starting on p. 18,
opens with an article about the need for communication of accurate information on drilling-related topics. A second article discusses ongoing research to treat and recycle frac water. And a third
article covers testimony of industry officials stating that individual
states are already sufficiently regulating hydraulic fracturing. Photo

Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition
July 14 – 16, 2009
Calgary TELUS Convention Centre, Calgary, Alberta, Canada

REGISTER TODAY!

Oil for tomorrow
THE PROMISE. THE PRACTICE.
Technologies developed for the oil sands and heavy oil resources of Alberta are vital to more than tomorrow’s oil supply.
They represent solutions to problems encountered throughout the oil industry.
Problems like managing costs during periods of lower oil prices, dealing with labor shortages, handling sulfur, controlling
air emissions, producing oil under difficult conditions, mitigating surface impacts, recycling produced water, capturing and
sequestering carbon dioxide, and more.
While it finds solutions to these challenges, the oil sands and heavy oil industry continues to develop unconventional
resources that are critical to meeting the world’s long-term needs for reliable hydrocarbon supplies.
Continued progress in oil sands and heavy oil producing technologies means progress in ensuring a dependable supply of
petroleum products at a time when traditional recovery methods are strained by additional demand from rapidly developing
industrial nations.
The Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition is the premier forum for the people who make this
innovation and progress possible.
Don’t miss this opportunity to present your product or service to a powerful, influential audience. Join the Oil & Gas
Journal and our conference attendees in Calgary this summer for the third annual Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies
Conference and Exhibition.

BP reports fastest oil demand fall since 1982

Enterprise, TEPPCO reach merger agreement

Worldwide oil demand has fallen at its fastest rate since 1982,
according to BP PLC’s statistical review of world energy.
Tony Hayward, chief executive officer of the company, said
global oil production will fall because of dwindling demand and
improvements in energy efficiency. Last year, oil consumption in
the developed world fell by 1.6%—the largest decline since 1982.
This trend is expected to continue.
For the first time, the developing world led by China consumed
more energy than OECD countries: China represented nearly three
quarters of global growth and its energy usage was 17.7%. This was
the slowest rate for 5 years.
“This is not a temporary phenomenon but one that I believe
will only increase still more over time,” Hayward said. “It will continue to affect prices and bring with it new challenges over economic growth, energy security, and climate change.”
Oil demand dropped by 1.5 million b/d in the developed
world, spurred first by record oil prices and the global economy
collapsing. Non-OECD countries also registered slower growth in
demand at just 1.1 million b/d.
Hayward said he believes oil prices will hit $60-90/bbl in the
future, arguing that oil producers need at least $60/bbl to underpin investment and consumers appeared comfortable with prices
beneath $90.
“In the OPEC world, most OPEC countries need prices north of
$60-70/bbl to be able to invest in today’s capacity, to invest in their
social government programs and to invest in tomorrow’s capacity.
If that price isn’t realized, then the first thing that gets cut is tomorrow’s capacity.”
According to the energy review, worldwide oil production
climbed by 0.4% last year.
In 2008, gas consumption crept along, below the decade average at 2.5%. China experienced the fastest rise in gas consumption,
reaching a level of 15.8% while US gas consumption rose 0.6%
and the UK 3%.
BP said: “Globally, gas production rose 3.8%, above the 10-year
trend of 3%. This was driven strongly by the US, which recorded
its highest ever annual increase in gas production as strong activity
in the development of unconventional gas resources raised output
by 7.5%.”
Coal continued for the sixth year as the fastest-growing fuel.
“Our data confirms that the world has enough proved reserves
of oil, natural gas, and coal to meet the world’s needs for decades
to come,” Hayward said. “The challenges the world faces in growing supplies to meet future demand are not below ground; they are
above ground. They are human, not geological.”

Enterprise Products Partners LP and TEPPCO Partners LP have
agreed to a major merger of US pipeline, storage, and gas processing systems.
The combined entity will retain the Enterprise Products Partners
name. It will own more than 22,000 miles of NGL, oil product,
and petrochemical pipelines; 20,000 miles of natural gas pipelines;
and 5,000 miles of crude oil pipelines.
Combined storage capacities will be 200 million bbl of NGL,
products, and crude oil and 27 bcf of natural gas. The partnership will own one of the largest NGL terminals in the US, on the
Houston Ship Channel; 60 NGL, product, and petrochemical terminals throughout the US; and crude oil terminals on the Texas
Gulf Coast.
The postmerger partnership will own interests in 17 fractionation plants with more than 600,000 b/d of net capacity, 25 gas
processing plants with net capacity of about 9 bcfd, and 3 butane
isomerization facilities with capacity of 116,000 b/d.
Enterprise and TEPPCO have entered into definitive agreements
to enact the merger. The new partnership will have an enterprise
value exceeding $26 billion.
TEPPCO and its general partner, Texas Eastern Products Pipeline
Co. LLC, are to become subsidiaries of Enterprise.
Parties to the agreement agreed to settle lawsuits filed after Enterprise made its initial offer in March.

EU group prepares for possible Ukraine gas shortage
At a meeting scheduled for July 2, the European Union’s Gas
Coordination Group is to prepare for the possibility of another
gas shortage in case Russia again shuts down the flow of its gas
through Ukraine to the EU.
Ukraine is still looking for a $4.2 billion loan to pay for Russian gas deliveries. About 80% of Russia’s gas supplies to Europe
pass through Ukraine and accounts for one third of the EU’s gas
imports.
The directive that established the Gas Coordination Group in
2006 includes a three-step approach in dealing with a supply crisis.
The first calls for the industry to take measures to resolve the emergency. If that fails, national programs are activated. If those fail and
20% of gas imports are curtailed, the coordination group provides
assistance to countries in difficulty.
The January crisis showed a more coordinated approach is
needed at EU level, and the commission suggested emergency
plans be activated automatically in the event of supply disruption.
It suggested the commission should have the authority to force
member states to provide gas from their strategic stocks. These new
measures should be proposed to the council and parliament before
the end of summer. ✦

Norwegian parliament approves Goliat ﬁeld plan
The Norwegian parliament has given the go ahead for Eni Norge
AS to develop Goliat field in the Barents Sea with a circular floating
production platform.
Sevan Marine ASA has designed the Sevan 1000 floating production, storage, and offloading vessel and has signed an engineering
contract and a technology license with Eni (OGJ Online, Apr. 24,
2009). Production from the field, which lies in 400 m of water, is
scheduled to start in fourth quarter 2013.
“Use of the circular FPSO makes it possible to utilize electricity
supplied from shore combined with a gas turbine for power and
heat on the offshore facility. This will result in significantly lower
levels of [carbon dioxide] emissions,” said Eni.
Meanwhile, a consortium led by Aker Solutions AS pulled out of
competition for the engineering, procurement, and construction
contract for the Goliat FPSO.
Aker Solutions said Eni Norge would not prequalify the group
for the field development.
Aker and its partners, Aibel and Samsung Heavy Industries, had
suggested a floating production platform with production capacities of 100,000 b/d and 3.9 million cu m/day gas and storage
capacity of 950,000 bbl.
The Sevan Marine Services circular floating production platform
design calls for those production capacities and 1 million bbl of
oil storage.
The field, which holds reserves of 180 million boe, is the first
oil development in its area. Environmentalists are worried about
its impact.
Total Goliat investments are estimated at 28 billion kroner ($4.4
billion) in 2008 money.
Goliat field, on Blocks 7122/7,8,9,10 and 7123/7, was discovered in 2000.
Eni is operator of Goliat with a 65% stake. StatoilHydro holds
35%.

tion, and both have been subject to extensive data gathering and
coring, the company said.
Well 13 A reached a TVD of 3,108 m subsea and terminated in
the Statfjord formation. Well 13 S reached a TVD of 3,258 m subsea
and ended in the Hegre group.
StatoilHydro used the Scarabeo 5 semisubmersible rig to drill
the wells in 381 m of water. The rig has moved to PL 199 for a
workover of production well 6406/2-S-4 H.
Both wells have been plugged and abandoned.
Operator StatoilHydro has 59.06% of PL 120, where its partners
are Petoro with 16.94%, ConocoPhillips 13%, and Total E&P Norge
11%.

Seychelles prepares for offshore licensing round

Seychelles Petroleum Co. (Seypec) completed an oil-slick mapping and interpretation project off Seychelles in partnership with
Infoterra Ltd. to prepare for a licensing round later this year.
The companies have gathered more than 150 radar satellite
scenes across 500,000 sq km—making it the largest slick-mapping
project ever done off Seychelles.
The data will be used to identify mature source rocks and a
petroleum system. “We will use this data to support the planning
of seismic projects and subsequent geochemical programs,” said
Patrick Joseph, Seypec exploration manager.
Infoterra ranked all oil slicks as probable natural seepage or
manmade pollution and mapped the location and movement of all
shipping visible in the area to give a more complete picture.
According to reports, the Seychelles will offer 70,000 sq km of
offshore acreage in the licensing round.
One operating company in the nation is East African Exploration Ltd., which signed a production-sharing agreement last year
with the government covering 15,000 sq km.
The two larger tranches, Area A (7,510 sq km) and Area B
(6,808 sq km) lie in shallow water in the northern half of the
Seychelles plateau. Area C (680 km) is in the south.

BLM signs decision record on Rocktober gas project
The US Bureau of Land Management’s Cody, Wyo., field manager signed a decision record on June 29 for seven proposed natural
gas wells in the McCullough Peaks area east of Cody.
The action by Michael P. Stewart followed a 30-day review of a
BLM environmental assessment (EA) of a proposal by Denver independent producer Bill Barrett Corp. for the wells and associated
facilities in the Rocktober Natural Gas Unit.
The analysis determined that no significant long-term impacts
would occur as a result of the project, BLM said. It also addressed
issues raised during the EA’s public comment and review periods
including impacts on wild horses, sage grouse, and other wildlife;
visual intrusions, and air and water quality, BLM said. It received 55
comments on the proposed project.
One of the comments came from the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, an environmental organization based in Bozeman, Mont.
It said that Bill Barrett already has drilled two wells on state land
in the McCullough Peaks area. It asked BLM to delay its final decision on the company’s application until the federal agency’s new
resource management plan for the area is completed.
It also urged BLM to require Bill Barrett to use closed-loop drilling on the project, which the group said “eliminates massive pits
filled with contaminates that pose a threat to wildlife and groundwater.”
In an errata to the EA, BLM said that there is no reason to use
a closed-loop system in drilling the Rocktober wells because reserve pits would be lined if required by BLM. “Standard drilling
techniques (including isolating all water-bearing formations in the
well bore with pipe and cement) will adequately protect water
aquifers,” it maintained.
All groundwater resources in the area are 600-700 ft deep and
there are no water wells near the project area, it continued. The
nearest water wells are more than 2 miles away and in a hydraulically up-gradiant direction “and therefore have little to no risk
from project operations,” the EA’s errata said.
It also said that the EA follows the existing resource manage-

Bidding will resume on the second of two major refineries in
Saudi Arabia for which work was delayed late last year.
Saudi Aramco and ConocoPhillips have reinstated preconstruction work on the 400,000-b/d refinery they plan at Yanbu, Saudi
Arabia.
The full-conversion export refinery will process Arabian heavy
crude. Willie C. Chiang, ConocoPhillips senior vice-president, refining, marketing, and transportation, said bidding had resumed
“now that markets are more favorable.”

Chevron begins injecting steam in PNZ pilot
Saudi Arabian Chevron initiated steam injection in its large-scale
pilot steamflood project at Wafra field, an Eocene heavy-oil carbonate reservoir in the Partitioned Neutral Zone (PNZ) between
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
Chevron said the $340 million pilot is the final test phase for
steamflooding the reservoir, and it expects the pilot to lead to fullfield steamflooding, which would make the project the world’s first
commercial conventional steamflood in a carbonate reservoir.
“Full-field deployment of steamflood technology in the PNZ
would significantly increase recovery of crude oil reserves, confirm
the technology’s potential applicability in other carbonate oil fields
and build on Chevron’s steamflood capabilities that date back 5
decades,” said George Kirkland, executive vice-president, Chevron
Global Upstream & Gas.
The large-scale pilot is the third in a series of staged tests for
validating the feasibility of steamflooding at Wafra. Previous tests
included the small-scale test completed in 2008 and simple steam
stimulation in the late 1990s.
Steamflooding involves injecting steam into heavy-oil reservoirs
to heat the crude oil underground, reducing its viscosity and allowing its extraction through wells. Chevron has employed steamflooding to produce heavy oil from sandstone reservoirs at Kern
River, Calif. for more than 40 years and at Duri in Sumatra, Indonesia, for 25 years.
Saudi Arabian Chevron operates on behalf of Saudi Arabia that
has a 50% interest in the onshore PNZ petroleum resources. Saudi
recently amended and extended Chevron’s operating agreement
until February 2039.
The company’s operations in the PNZ include four fields: Wafra, South Umm Gudair, South Fuwaris, and Humma. The fields
produce mainly heavy crude from 10 reservoirs. In 2004, onshore
PNZ produced its 3 billionth bbl of oil, according to Chevron. ✦

Borouge to expand Abu Dhabi oleﬁns complex
Borouge, a joint venture of Borealis AS of Vienna and Abu Dhabi
National Oil Co., plans to make its already expanding ethane-cracking complex in Ruwais, Abu Dhabi, the world’s largest.
It has let a $1.075 billion contract to Linde Group, Munich,
for a third ethane cracker at Ruwais with capacity of 1.5 million
tonnes/year (tpy).
The project will increase total polyolefins capacity of the complex to 4.5 million tpy by the end of 2013. In addition to the
ethane cracker, it includes construction of second-generation polypropylene and polyethylene units based on Borealis’s Borstar technology, a low-density polyethylene unit, and a butene unit, plus
offsite utilities and marine facilities.
The new ethane cracker will add to an existing 600,000 tpy
ethane cracker and a 1.5 million tpy unit under construction.
The world’s largest olefins complex in terms of ethylene capacity now is Nova Chemicals Corp.’s 2.8 million tpy facility at Joffre,
Alta.
The cracker under construction at Ruwais is part of a project
to increase Borouge polyolefins capacity to 2 million tpy by mid2010. Net ethylene output from that plant will be 600,000 tpy,
according to Chemical Market Associates Inc., Houston, because
some of the product will be dimerized to butene, and butene and

more ethylene will be metathesized to propylene (OGJ, Aug. 25,
2008, p. 48).
In that project, Borouge is adding a 752,000-tpy olefins conversion unit, a 540,000-tpy polyethylene plant, and two 400,000-tpy
polypropylene plants.

Total resolves Lindsey reﬁnery dispute
Total SA has settled a dispute with hundreds of contract workers that were fired from constructing a hydrodesulfurization unit
(HDS) at its 200,000 b/d Lindsey refinery in the UK.
The employees will vote on the measures to be reinstated to
work on June 29, unions said. They were fired after embarking on
unofficial strikes about 51 planned redundancies by the sub contractor while another employer on the site was hiring people.
Their actions triggered sympathy strikes at other construction
and energy sites around the country.
The HDS unit is already 6 months behind schedule and €100
million over budget. It is meant to be ready before the end of the
year, but this is the second strike this year that has derailed its
progress. Total said it was pleased that “a positive conclusion” had
been reached. “We expect this means that the contractors will be
able to get back to work as soon as possible and get the project
completed on time and with no further disruption or additional
costs.” ✦

Gorgon-Jansz gas gets interim marketing nod
The three joint venturers in the Gorgon-Jansz gas and LNG project in Western Australia have been given conditional interim authorization from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to market gas in the state.
The approval enables Chevron Corp., ExxonMobil Corp., and
Royal Dutch Shell PLC to talk to potential customers and obtain
information relevant to the project’s final investment decision expected later this year.
ACCC Chairman Graeme Samuel said authorization was unlikely
to result in irreversible changes to the market because any gas sales
agreements reached during this period would be conditional on
final authorization.
The move has disappointed the so-called DomGas Alliance,
which represents Western Australia’s largest customers and which
told the ACCC in early June that it opposed the request for joint
marketing.
Alliance Chairman Stuart Hohnen pointed out that vigorous gas
competition was important for businesses and households. He said
a lack of competition had resulted in gas prices recently four or five
times those in eastern Australia on a delivered basis.
The ACC has addressed this issue by only allowing the interim
authorization to take place after the Gorgon partners had their
ring-fencing arrangements independently audited, and any changes required to make them effective had been implemented.
The commission will make a draft determination by September
following a public comment period.
The Gorgon-Jansz project includes a three-train LNG plant with

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

total capacity of 15 million tonnes/year alongside a domestic gas
plant capable of supplying 300 terajoules/day of gas to the Western
Australian grid. Gas is scheduled to come on stream in 2014.
Chevron is operator with 50%. ExxonMobil and Shell have 25%
each.

Qatar, Poland sign 20-year LNG contract
Qatar Liquefied Gas Co. III (Qatargas) has signed a 20-year
agreement to sell Poland 1 million tonnes/year of LNG.
Poland’s Treasury Ministry said value of the contract is about
$550 million/year.
Poland will receive the LNG at a terminal under construction at
Swinoujscie, scheduled for completion in 2015.
Qatargas expects its LNG production to rise to 42 million
tonnes/year by the end of the decade from 10 million tonnes/
year in 2008. ✦

Correction
A recent story about a ramp-up in production from BP
PLC’s Thunder Horse project incorrectly attributed Thunder
Horse as solely accounting for 1 of every 6 bbl of oil produced
in the US (OGJ Online, Apr. 17, 2009). The statement should
have read: “Offshore deepwater developments like Thunder
Horse now account for 1 of every 6 bbl of oil produced in the
US.”

Part of the story
Whilst I agree with the thrust of
your editorial entitled “‘Pollutant’s’ new
meaning threatens hydrogen vehicles”—
that is, governments really have no
clue what they are talking about when
it comes to greenhouse gases, climate
change, and so forth, to say that hydrogen vehicles produce water vapor, which
is a more powerful greenhouse gas than
CO2, is only part of the story (OGJ Online, May 1, 2009).
The more damaging problem with
hydrogen fuel usage is where does one
get hydrogen from? The inconvenient
truth, which BP, the politicians, and other agents of disinformation will not tell
you, is that you have to burn coal, oil,
or gas to produce the energy to create
hydrogen. The energy needed to drive
a hydrogen-based car is obtained in a
two-stage process and is therefore inherently even more inefficient that simply
burning natural gas or oil to provide the
necessary energy.

Jeroen van der Veer, Royal Dutch

this type of gas-building hasn’t been

other places successive governments
could block previous policies and delay

Groningen has become a landmark

a net exporter of gas in 15 years, the
Dutch government is keen to position
the nation as the gas hub of northwest
Europe with gas storage capacity, transport capacity, and trading facilities. This
will ensure that the Dutch gas industry
will be a prominent force for many
decades to come. ✦

Climate bill misinformation
The American rush toward economic peril
continues.
“Don’t believe the misinformation out there
that suggests there is somehow a contradiction
between investing in clean energy and economic
growth,” commanded President Barack Obama
while praising a monstrous climate bill passed by
the House of Representatives. “It’s just not true.”
As always, Obama sounded totally sure of himself.
But being sure and being right aren’t the same thing.
Without the context of the American Clean
Energy and Security Act, the president’s statement
would be true enough. Clean energy and economic growth don’t have to be contradictory. Nobody’s
saying they are.
The bill in question, however, goes beyond
simply investing in clean energy. It establishes an
already corrupt cap-and-trade system for emissions of greenhouse gases. It also fosters governmental fuel choice by setting a renewable-energy
standard for electric utilities and committing the
federal government to spending of $190 billion
on the energy technologies politicians like.

Massive intrusion
The bill represents a massive intrusion by
government into energy markets. It can’t achieve
its goal of lowering emissions of carbon dioxide
except by painfully raising the costs of hydrocarbon fuels. To insist, as Obama does, that this won’t
create hardship is to overlook much.
But glib claims and propaganda tricks—such as
assertions about climactic “tipping points” and “scientific consensus”—are what pushed the US to this
economic precipice. Days before the vote on the
climate bill, supporters of the legislation trumpeted
a Congressional Budget Office report estimating
that costs to the average household would be just
$175 in 2020. That seems like a small price to pay
for saving the planet, even to those who believe the
planet’s need for rescue isn’t all that dire.
Again, however, things aren’t so simple. CBO’s
analysis came under immediate criticism from
economists who said that the agency didn’t fully
account for economic responses to elevated energy
costs and that it spotlighted a year in which emissions allowances still will be relatively cheap.
16

The conservative Heritage Foundation, moreover, said CBO’s numbers simply don’t add up.
CBO estimates the gross cost of emission allowances at $91.4 billion in 2020. But projected
emissions times the assumed price of $28/ton of
CO2 imply a cost of $141 billion, which is more
in line with CBO’s projections of allowance revenues in 2015-19.
The Heritage Foundation critique, by David W.
Kreutzer, Karen Campbell, and Nicolas D. Loris,
further criticizes the CBO for treating government
spending and distribution of allowance revenue as
a direct cash rebate to energy consumers—“that is,
that the carbon tax is not a tax if the government
spends the money, which is simply preposterous.”
And the analysts call “most problematic” CBO’s
acknowledged omission of general economic
damage resulting from restricted energy use.
The high probability of serious economic
damage doesn’t faze Obama, who while disparaging observers who worry about cost resorted to
his standard invocation of green jobs. “Make no
mistake,” he said, “this is a jobs bill.” Amazingly,
one of his cheery examples was California, where
“3,000 people will be employed to build a new
solar plant that will create 1,000 permanent jobs.”

Little help
A thousand jobs won’t much help a state already
leading the nation in economic self-destruction
through governmental mischief in energy markets.
In May alone, reports the California Employment
Development Department, nonfarm payroll jobs
declined by 68,900 from the same month a year
earlier. The number of people unemployed in California in May was 2.138 million—885,000 more
than a year earlier. Putting them all to work would
require construction of 716 solar plants of the size
Obama mentioned. And, oh yes, the state’s broke.
The rest of the country should in fact treat California as an example but draw conclusions quite
different from those intended by the president.
The state is reeling from, among other things,
egregious energy governance. It shows where the
whole country will be headed if the Senate, encouraged by a self-assured president on a spending
binge, upholds the House’s mistake. ✦

The need for communication of
accurate information to the public, lawmakers, and regulators is imperative on
various drilling-related topics, including hydraulic fracturing, water use and
supply, and surface use. This is especially
the case given active development of
massive US natural gas shale plays in
regions of the country less accustomed
to oil and gas development.

Hydraulic fracturing, water use issues
under congressional, public scrutiny
Paul Hagemeier

Jason Hutt
Bracewell & Giuliani LLP
Washington, DC

Hydraulic fracturing, traditionally
a state-regulated practice, has been
targeted for intensifying scrutiny by
several federal legislators and possibly
by the US Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA). In June, representatives
in Congress introduced legislation that
would give the EPA authority to regu-

Drilling and the Environment

late hydraulic fracturing under the Safe
Drinking Water Act. This would reverse
the explicit exemption for fracturing
contained in the Energy Policy Act of
2005 and introduce a new requirement
that the ingredients used in proprietary
fracing fluids be disclosed and made
available to the public (OGJ, June 15,
18

2009, p. 30).
Furthermore, EPA Administrator Lisa
Jackson has testified that the increased
use of hydraulic fracturing is “well
worth looking into,” suggesting that
EPA may reexamine its established position that federal regulation of fracing is
not warranted.
If past is prologue, however, the
historic innovation and entrepreneurial
spirit of America’s gas industry bodes
well for what lies ahead. This special
report outlines examples of Chesapeake
Energy Corp.’s attention to environmental issues in its Barnett shale operations.

Fracing gets attention
Hydraulic fracturing increasingly is
being used in the development of shale
gas plays. A quick internet search reveals
the attention that fracturing is receiving
as well as a number of misguided allegations about the associated environmental impacts of fracturing.
Before the introduction of any
chemicals used in the drilling process,
engineers, geologists, and geophysicists
(and other specialists) collaborate to
develop a fracturing program tailored
to the specific characteristics of the
formation and the well. A well-designed
and installed casing program, combined
with proper cementing, provides the
first layer of protection and groundwater isolation from an oil- or gas-bearing
formation.
States traditionally rely on casing
and cement regulations as a primary
means of protecting subsurface water.
The typical state-mandated program requires steel casing that meets a specific
standard (usually American Petroleum
Institute Spec. 5CT), as well as the use
of specific cement and cementing techniques.
By requiring compliance with API
recommendations, each casing string
effectively is ensured to meet or surpass a multitude of strength, pressure,
and corrosion tests. Engineers design
meticulous protective casing programs
to prevent pressure collapse, burst
pressure, corrosion, and joint failure—
all while maintaining isolation from

environmentally protective practices.
In addition to protecting water resources, many operators work proactively with state regulators on collecting
predrilling water samples from public
and private wells. These samples are
analyzed by the state and independent
laboratories to provide a better understanding of local water quality before
drilling. This effort insulates companies
from frivolous litigation by establishing
baseline conditions and, perhaps more
importantly, educates the public about
groundwater quality. It is incumbent
upon the industry to champion the
development and implementation of
sampling and analytical standards.
Industry efforts such as additional

sediment runoff control demonstrate
a proactive approach to environmental

protection. By further educating the
general public on industry’s efforts,
false allegations can be defused, and
the industry can continue to serve as a
leader in developing sound, environmentally responsible practices.

Water use issues
Water use is another issue receiving
increasing attention. Oil and gas wells
cannot be drilled or completed without
using water. A typical deep shale gas
well requires a total of 3 million gal
of water for the drilling and hydraulic
fracturing processes.
To put that in context, 3 million gal
of water is the amount used by:
• A city with a population of more
than 8 million people in 4 min.
• A 1,000-Mw coal-fired electric
power plant in 71⁄2 hr.

Special Report

• A typical golf course in 1 week.
• Irrigating a 5-acre corn field for
one season.
Unlike drilling and hydraulic fracturing, these examples are ongoing,
constant uses.
The amount of water used to produce 1 million MMbtu of natural gas is
about 10% of the amount required to
produce 1 MMbtu of coal and onetenth of 1% of the water it takes to
produce that amount of energy from
ethanol.
Water use for oil and gas drilling
and completion is temporary. Drilling
and hydraulic fracturing generally are
completed within weeks. A gas well
provides clean-burning energy for years
without requiring additional water.
Availability of water resource is
inseparable from the issue of water use.
Currently, water resources are protected
through a set of stringent federal, state,
and local permitting processes that
assure water quality and availability.
Permits and contracts must be obtained
before an operator takes water.
For now, industry obtains water
from a variety of sources, typically rivers, creeks, lakes, wastewater treatment
discharge facilities and groundwater.
In addition to these protected sources,
many companies heavily invest in
research and development to develop
best management practices and new
technologies for water recycling, water
reconditioning, and high-flow diversion
ponds.
In areas such as Pennsylvania and
Arkansas, high-flow diversion ponds are
being constructed (often by the state)
for water collection during high-flow
events. The ponds are constructed in
accordance with regulations to maintain
environmental sensitivity. The diversionary mechanism operates only when the
river or creek is in “high-flow,” thereby
minimizing impact on aquatic resources. By diverting water flow to these
ponds, the potential for flood damage is
reduced. Diversion ponds also provide
an alternate water source for drilling
and completion.
As is the case with virtually every

Researchers develop ways to treat, recycle frac water

transporting waste water and also to
provide water for more fracturing. He
has worked for 10 years on using membrane ﬁlters to treat frac water.
Frac water is a mixture of chemical additives and sand to prop open
fractures. About 75% of injected frac
water is recovered. The ﬂowback water
contains traces of barium, calcium
bicarbonate, iron, magnesium sulfate,
sodium chloride, and strontium that it
picked up while passing through the
rock formation.
A petroleum engineer, Burnett has
discovered that more than 12,000

commercial quantities. He works to ﬁnd

the ﬂowback water can be recycled,
and the rest must be reinjected into
saltwater disposal wells, he said.
“We know the technology works. We
need to show that the technology works
for long periods of time, like 1-2 years,
and make sure it’s cost effective.”

The use of membrane ﬁltration to

floor. Drilling rigs are compelled to go
where the science and geology direct,
although industry seeks to avoid wetlands and riparian areas, sensitive species and habitat, and densely populated
areas. Considerable efforts are made to
avoid sensitive areas.
In practice, this means increasing
efficiency while also reducing the geographic footprint. For example, improvements in seismic technology and
its increased use have enabled Chesapeake Energy to drill with a success rate
of over 95% (and even the industry
average as a whole is over 90%). Successful drilling rates help companies
avoid drilling dry holes and the accompanying surface disturbance.
In addition, the increased use of horizontal drilling allows for more source
rock exposure while requiring fewer
surface locations. Industry also has
reduced its surface footprint by drilling
and completing multiple wells from a
single pad. While the pad is larger than
a traditional pad, it drastically reduces
the amount of disturbed surface acreage
necessary to produce the same volume
of gas. By drilling multiple big stepout
wells, field development is maximized,
which allows more gas to flow from
fewer wells.
The surface area used by these larger
pads can be reduced when the right
geology, surface area, equipment, and
a host of other factors come together.
Reducing pad size requires specially
designed top-drive rigs with highcapacity pumps, a high derrick load
rating, complete solids control equipment, and skid packages—all features of
a smaller yet more powerful rig. These
built-for-purpose rigs can be combined with a closed loop system and
dewatering unit, eliminating the need
for reserve pits and reducing water use
requirements.
Prudent and responsible operations require that surface locations be
selected based on environmental and
social stewardship considerations, not
just upon economic return on investment. This is particularly important in

metropolitan settings and environmentally sensitive areas.
In both instances, industry can tap
into valuable natural resources while
preserving the character of the surrounding area. This is done using
specialty rigs, equipment, and platforms that reduce noise, power use, and
emissions. For example, drilling rigs
can be fitted (when appropriate) with
sound-deadening barriers to reduce
the amount of noise, a tactic that has
allowed industry to successfully operate
in urban settings.

Industry faces constant pressure to
innovate, comply, and educate—while,
of course, demonstrating value to shareholders. Additional pressures stem from
coordinated efforts by well-funded and
organized non-governmental organizations that have set their sights and public relations machines on the industry.
Their efforts are producing results. The
challenge is to navigate the laws and
regulations while developing better
practices and technologies that provide
solutions for oil and gas production in
an environmentally sound manner. ✦

Personnel, public relations
While policies and regulations are
designed to minimize the environmental impact of gas drilling, history
demonstrates that it is industry’s people
who make the greatest difference.
As with all industries, it is incumbent upon the “old guard,” including
management, to demand environmental
prudence in operations. This requires
unflinching dedication to hiring good
people, and more importantly, educating and training them on how to “do
things the right way.”
The gas industry is made up of
thousands of companies and individuals with specialized functions spanning
the exploration and production value
chain. As a result, it often is not well
understood to those outside its ranks.
Clear and accurate communication with
regulators, legislators, and the public is
essential to addressing misconceptions
about environmental impacts and formulating sensible policies that balance
environmental protection and America’s
goal of greater energy independence.
Energy companies and energyrelated service and supply vendors are
being called upon to know the business
and its practices, comply with governing rules and regulations, participate
meaningfully in trade groups, and
engage policymakers and the public.
As an illustration of success, industry’s
outreach efforts led to the development
of the Department of Energy’s recently
published Shale Gas Primer. These outreach efforts must continue.

Another subcommittee member,
Maurice D. Hinchey (D-NY), disagreed,
saying, “This is not an issue that’s newly
important. It’s been around for a long
time.” Congress dealt with it when it
passed the Safe Drinking Water Act in
1974, but a later group of federal lawmakers exempted oil and gas drilling
under the 2005 Energy Policy Act, an
action which needs to be reversed, he
said.

Will reintroduce bill
Hinchey and Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) said following the hearing that they
plan soon to reintroduce a bill that they
initially offered in 2008, which would
bring oil and gas drilling back under
the SDWA. “This bill would make
drillers subject to the same reporting requirements as any other
industry under the SDWA. They
would have to file reports about
what chemicals are in the fracing
fluid,” DeGette told reporters during an afternoon teleconference.
Hinchey, who also participated,
said, “We are being contacted by
people from around the country
who report bad experiences from
drilling near their property. We’re not
trying to do anything revolutionary.
We’re trying to restore a safe, solid
piece of legislation that was passed back
in 1974.”
But Kell noted that reports of problems have been exaggerated. “In recent
months, the states have become aware
of press reports and websites alleging that six states have documented
over 1,000 incidents of groundwater
contamination from the practice of hydraulic fracturing. Such reports are not
accurate,” he said.
Officials from Ohio, Pennsylvania,
New Mexico, Alabama, and Texas wrote
letters to GWPC Executive Director Mike
Paque disproving the reports, Kell continued. A sixth official, from Colorado,
did not respond because he had not been

on the job long enough, he added.
In his May 29 letter to Paque, Texas
Railroad Commission Chairman Victor
G. Carillo said a majority of 354 active
groundwater cases associated with the
oil and gas which were reported in
the state in 2007 involved “previous
practices that are no longer allowed or
result from activity now prohibited by
our existing regulations.” He said, “A
few cases were due to blowouts that
primarily occur during drilling activity.
Not one of these cases was caused by
hydraulic fracturing activity.”

Safely used since ‘40s
Mike John of Chesapeake Energy
acknowledged that hydraulic fracturing
has become somewhat controversial,
but added that it has been safely used
since the 1940s. “It is very important to
reiterate that these deep shale formations exist thousands of feet below the
land surface and are separated from
freshwater supplies by layers of steel
casing, protected by concrete barriers as
well as millions of tons of hard, dense
solid rock geologic formations,” he said
in his written statement.
John also submitted a fact sheet that
listed fracturing fluid additives, main
compounds, and purposes, including
hydrochloric or muriatic acid, borate
salts (which maintain fluid viscosity as
temperatures rise), petroleum distillate
(to “slick” the water to minimize friction), and ethylene glycol (to prevent
scale deposits in the pipe). “Additives
used in hydraulic fracturing fluids include a number of compounds found in
common consumer products,” the fact
sheet said.
But Appleton characterized fracturing fluid ingredients as “a witch’s
brew of toxic chemicals, nearly all of
which are intrinsically hazardous to the
environment.” They are dangerous, he
maintained, because they don’t biodegrade: “Once in the environment, they
stay there. Most of them bioaccumulate.
The remainder volatize, removing them
from water and land, but adding them
to the atmosphere where they become
contributors to global warming.”

Protesting
BLM lease sales

T

he US Department of the Interior
has made progress in the last 6
months in responsibly developing
oil and gas on public land, Interior
Secretary Ken Salazar said on June
24. It has offered 2.5 million acres,
and companies have paid $60 billion
in bonus bids and leasing fees for
782,280 acres, he reported.
“We have held 17 oil and gas
lease sales since January and plan
to hold another 20 sales in the
next 6 months,” Salazar said. So far
this year, BLM has offered 1,749
parcels totaling 2,261,854 acres
and has sold leases on 866 parcels
totaling 782,280 acres, collecting
$60,108,904 in revenue.
Salazar’s statements came a day
after Utah’s BLM office held its
second lease sale for 2009. It was
quieter than one that took place Dec.
18, 2008, when conservation groups
sued because they felt the tracts
were too close to national parks and
monuments. Salazar agreed soon after
becoming secretary and ordered BLM
to reject the 77 successful bids.
But the June 23 sale still generated
comment. Utah’s BLM office delayed
issuing the 31 sold leases until protests
arriving after the deadline are resolved.

Hydraulic fracturing introduces these
chemicals into the environment by leaving a significant portion of the fluid underground, where it is free to migrate
into groundwater, he continued. More
oversight is needed to assure that wells
are properly drilled so their integrity is
not breached, that the fracing fluids are
properly handled and not spilled, and
the liquids are properly disposed, he
said in his written statement.
Appleton said shale-gas drilling is
inappropriate in any area that is a major
drinking water source, that zoning
is essential particularly in rural areas
to minimize impacts of incompatible
land uses, and that a system of impact

will be needed to deal with community

When Cynthia M. Lummis (R-Wyo.)
asked what impacts federal hydraulic

Alabama spent 2 years rewriting its
regulations in the 1990s after losing a
lawsuit brought by an environmental
organization. “We’re also concerned
that requiring additional regulations
will divert states’ resources from other
higher priority programs,” Kell said.
When she was asked about this during her teleconference, DeGette replied:
“The reason we passed the [SDWA]
to begin with is that we decided safe
drinking water is a national priority.
Also, water like any resources crosses
state lines. I’m very proud of Colorado
for passing new stringent regulations,
but other states haven’t followed it. Further, the SDWA is being administered

NPRA’s Drevna said, “Despite the

since the Energy and Commerce Committee passed it, the American Clean Energy and Security Act still fails domestic
refiners and consumers alike. It dismisses the real concerns Americans have
over rising energy costs and the adverse
effect those costs will have on our nation’s economic recovery.”
Rep. Gene Green (D-Tex.), who voted for the bill, conceded during floor
debate that domestic refiners would be
at a competitive disadvantage despite
HR 2454’s giving them 2% of available
allowances of emissions credits from
2014 to 2016, plus another 0.25% for
smaller refiners. “To level the playing

“While I believe the refining industry could use additional assistance, and

Green, whose Houston area district includes several refineries and petrochemical plants. “These proposals, however,
cannot substitute the need for a strong
international agreement with binding

American Gas Association Pres. David
N. Parker cited the bill’s benefits to
residential and commercial gas customers, who would not be covered under
a carbon cap until 2016. Gas utilities
would receive 9% of emissions allowances until 2025, when they would
begin to reduce their allowances to zero
by 2030, he said.

is clear that we are not appropriately
regulating this market today, we should
also avoid gutting the market altogether,” Matheson said. “I think there is
a reasonable way to structure the new
carbon market and to address deficiencies in the commodity markets. The
provisions in the bill are not the right
approach, and these provisions were
never really debated in a House committee hearing.”
Harry Mitchell (D-Ariz.) also voted
no. “This bill literally recommits the
United States to coal, a step backwards
at a time when it is vitally important for
us to move forward. Clean, renewable
energy should be our chief priority, not
fossil fuels. In Arizona, this bill asks us
to pay more for our energy but fails to
deliver what is necessary to help us grow
our emerging solar industry,” he said.
Dennis C. Kucinich (D-Ohio), who
is not a Blue Dog Democrat, also voted
against HR 2454 because he believed its
offsets favor coal-fired power plants.

T E R E S T
Republicans object
House Republicans continued to
condemn the measure because it would
impose new taxes and costs without
taking direct steps to increase domestic
production of energy from traditional
sources.
“Instead of the Democrats’ highpriced gourmet plan that cherry-picks
what types of energy Americans are
allowed to use, our nation needs a plan
that includes all types of energy,” said
Doc Hastings (R-Wash.), the Natural
Resources Committee’s ranking minority member. “The American Energy Act,
a Republican alternative, does this by
encouraging the development of renewable energy sources like nuclear, wind,
solar, hydropower, and biomass while
increasing production of Americanmade oil and natural gas.”
Tim Murphy (R-Pa.) said, “Democrats and Republicans alike want to

make sure that we reduce pollution
in our country and clean up our land
and water. But we need to find a way
of doing this without shutting down
coal, increasing family electric bills, or
losing manufacturing jobs.” He said HR
2227, which he cosponsored with Neil
Abercrombie (D-Ha.), not only would
encourage more domestic oil and gas
exploration and production but also
would dedicate much of the revenue
to environmental cleanups and alternative and renewable energy research and
development. Abercrombie voted for
HR 2454 on June 26, however.

2050, building a long bridge to an era
when alternatives can take over. A growing population and higher standards
of living for billions of people in the
developing world will mean we need all
available sources of energy to keep the
world’s economies humming. So while
the world races to build up alternative
fuels, it must also find new sources of
fossil fuels, including unconventional
ones like oil sands. And we must accelerate efforts to make fossil fuels cleaner,
by reducing the CO2 emitted in their
production and use.
None of this will be easy or cheap.
Industry and government regulations
must change on a huge scale, at an
unprecedented pace.
According to the International
Energy Agency, by 2030 we will need
to invest $5.5 trillion just in renewable
energy. That’s like buying more than
18,000 Boeing 747 jumbo jets at $300
million apiece (only about 14,000
have been built since its introduction
in 1970). Billions more must go into
upgrading electricity transmission
networks to handle increased demand
and the on-and-off power generated by
wind and solar.
Much of this money will come from
private companies, but governments
will need to continue using tax credits
and other incentives to encourage the
growth of renewables. They are still
small, relative to the world’s overall
energy needs. Including hydropower,
renewables account for about 7% of
global energy. Wind today supplies
about 1%, with approximately 70,000
turbines. Biofuels, thanks partly to billions of dollars in government subsidies, now also supply about 1%.
Judging from society’s experience
with nuclear power and other technologies, new energy sources take at least
25 years to reach significant scale. To
illustrate the challenge, in the case of
wind the world will need another 1-1.5
million turbines covering an area nearly
the size of France in order to reach 10%
of the electricity generated by 2030.
That means expanding today’s worldwide turbine production of around

“Despite the massive

15,000 a year to just under 100,000 a
year by 2030.
Energy companies are already
preparing for the future, increasing
production of natural gas, the cleanest
fossil fuel, investing in renewables such
as sustainable biofuels, and researching
ways to capture CO2 and store it safely
underground. But the enormity of the
challenge means government should do
its part to encourage society’s shift to a
new energy system. For instance, new
technologies with great promise to reduce CO2 emissions will require initial
government support to quickly achieve
the scale necessary to have real impact.
One critical step is to put a price on
greenhouse gas emissions—doing so
in all major countries, not just a few. I
prefer a system that caps emissions and
allows companies to trade emission
allowances, as Europe’s already does.
Judiciously limiting the number of allowances should encourage a relatively
steady CO2 price, which will have the
strongest influence on energy consumers’ behavior and on the efficiency
designed into factories, homes, and
offices. It will also harness the ingenuity
of industry and channel investment to
the most efficient emission reductions.
While energy policy can drive technology, it may ultimately raise costs and
be politically unpopular. As society and
political leaders face difficult choices,
they should remember that failure to act

now could force us into more painful choices down the road. Influencing
consumer behavior may prove toughest
of all. While technology will give society greater energy choices, it remains
unclear whether people are willing to
become better users of energy.
Despite the massive hurdles, the
push to create a new energy system
for the future will benefit us all. It will
reverse the rapid rise in the greenhouse
gas emissions responsible for global
warming. It will provide new business opportunities for companies and
entrepreneurs. It will create well-paid
jobs in a thriving new industry. Competition among energy sources will drive
innovation, keep energy affordable and
increase global energy security.
The race is on; may the best companies and technologies win. ✦

Production
Sources for China’s LPG output in
2008 were Sinopec refineries (50%),
PetroChina refineries (30%), and local
refineries (20%). Supply from these
sources made up 87.3% of China’s total
LPG; the remaining 12.7% came from
the Middle East, Australia, Asia, and
other countries.
Domestic output last year reached
589,400 b/d, down 4.1% from 2007,
said the report (Fig. 1), the “first time
that China [had ever seen] a decrease
in LPG output.” Two factors lie behind
the decline: Local refineries increased
production of both gasoline and diesel
through the first three quarters of 2008
to supply the Beijing 2008 Olympics; and weak domestic LPG demand
pushed output lower in final quarter.
China’s LPG production profile

Chinese refinery production of LPG
fell for the first time in history last
year. At the same time, the country’s
imports of LPG continued in 2008 a
decline begun in 2005 and Chinese LPG
consumption fell for the first time since
2000.
These are the major conclusions of a
report by Lijuan Wang and Kang Wu of
FACTS Global Energy, Singapore, issued
June 9.
For 2009, the authors forecast that
China’s LPG output will recover as a
result of expected higher refinery crude
runs when a couple of local refineries
come online. Imports, however, will
continue their slide, while exports will
“increase moderately.”
LPG consumption in 2009 will recover only slightly, as markets continue
to suffer from the global economic
slump and natural gas makes inroads
into traditional LPG demand.

average comes about 60% from gas processing with the great majority of the

According to OGJ data for 2008,
China operated only two gas processing

increase in international prices during
first-half 2008 combined with weaker
demand during second half were behind the decline.

Most of the LPG in China is consumed as fuel by the residential sector
accounting for 65% of the total, said
the FGE report. Another 25% is consumed by the industrial sector, 2% for
vehicle use, and 8% for other uses.
By region, South China and East
China are main consumers of LPG.
Guangdong Province is the largest
importer of LPG in China, according to
the report, “even as imports declined
in recent years.” Guangdong’s in 2008,
however, dropped to 56,000 b/d from
92,600 b/d in 2007 and 121,300 b/d
in 2006.

800 b/d in 2005.
Again, a major explanation can be
found in the higher international prices,
while Chinese refineries faced negative
margins overall in domestic markets last
year. China’s LPG prices are controlled
by its government.
The report’s authors also explained
that the geographical differences “for
this huge country is another reason

why China exports LPG, while importing it.”
Yet another explanation for imports
and for Chinese producers’ looking last
year to international markets is the drop
in domestic consumption. In a reversal
of a steady increase 2002-07, Chinese
consumption of LPG in 2008 dropped
to an average 652,200 b/d, down 11%
from 2007 (Fig. 3).

Of China’s 82,400 b/d imports in
2008, 70,500 b/d (85.6%) came from
Middle East countries: 17,000 b/d from
the UAE, 16,100 b/d from Kuwait,
15,100 b/d from Saudi Arabia, 14,100
b/d from Iran, and 8,200 b/d from
Qatar.
About 80% of LPG imports was imported by foreign-owned companies or
joint-venture companies with a foreign
base, said the report. ✦

Recent reports reveal shifting LNG trends in 2009

LNG demand “remain bleak,” according the first 6 months forced regional prices

to converge, said the report.
With demand deteriorating sharply
in Asia, spot prices for most Pacific basin collapsed to below those in Europe
and the US.

Canaport LNG LP officially opened Canada’s first LNG terminal at St. John, NB, on June 18.The terminal, jointly owned by Repsol (75%) and Irving Oil
(25%), has vaporized LNG storage equivalent of 9.9 bcf and sendout capacity of 1.2 bcfd. On June 27, the new terminal accepted delivery of its first shipment, discharged from the 138,000-cu m LNG tanker Bilbao Knutsen, which had lifted its cargo from Atlantic LNG in Trinidad and Tobago.

Major Asian economies that import
LNG—Japan and Korea, primarily—
continue to struggle, and “emerging
market participants”—mainly China—
are only partially offsetting the slowing
demand, says the report.
In the Atlantic Basin market, relative
weakness in US gas prices compared
with European benchmarks is “proving to be a limiting factor for US LNG
imports.” Europe, however, continues to
unload record LNG cargoes, its natural
gas prices maintaining relative strength.
Given these global supply-demand
trends, LNG imports to the US will
grow only modestly for the rest of the
year, averaging 1.6 bcfd for all of 2009.
Barclays said European storage levels

and transatlantic price differentials
are the leading indicators for US LNG
import trends.

Asian patterns
Earlier in June, Houston-based
Waterborne reported that continuing
recession and decline in demand for
natural gas had pulled down Asian LNG
imports by more than 12% in May,
compared with May 2008.
It was the fifth consecutive month in
2009 that levels had fallen below those
of 2008, said Waterborne Pres. Steve
Johnson. And it explains why US LNG
imports at that point in 2009 were up
36%.

Johnson said, “There is very limited
capacity for LNG storage in the global
market today besides the US, and we
have yet to feel the effect of incremental
supply.”
According to Waterborne, decreased
demand and recession had depressed
May LNG imports for Japan and South
Korea, compared with 2008. Japan’s
LNG imports dropped 11%; South
Korea’s 17%.
Taiwan, on the other hand, imported
5% more LNG in May, said the Waterborne report. China, taking advantage
of relatively low spot prices, imported a
record 576,000 tonnes of LNG, pushing up its May imports by 59% over
2008. ✦

Will UK’s Brown
act swiftly?

B

ritish Prime Minister Gordon
Brown, as we have said before,
has very rarely been viewed as a
friend of the oil and gas industry. But
the time has come for that to change.
According to reports coming our
way, Brown has not done enough to
encourage investment in the country’s offshore oil and gas sector, with
the result that thousands of jobs
could be at risk.
In fact, Parliament members issued a report last week warning that
urgent government action is needed
to prevent a decline in North Sea oil
and gas revenue that could lead to the
loss of 50,000 jobs.
“The difficulties currently faced
by oil and gas companies in accessing affordable lending and the bleak
prospects this heralds for investment
in the oil and gas industry pose an
issue of grave concern,” said Parliament’s Energy and Climate Change
Committee.
Committee members called for
more effective tax breaks, action over
the credit crunch, and moves to ensure new developers can access existing platforms and pipeline to get oil
ashore from fields too small to justify
building their own facilities.

50,000 jobs
“We have learned a lack of affordable lending and bleak investment
prospects could wipe out 50,000
jobs and lead to a significant fall in
production,” said committee chairman Paddy Tipping.
“If the government does not
respond to this problem by giving
better fiscal and regulatory signals
then we may never recover any-

34

thing like as much of our domestic
reserve as would be desirable,” Tipping said.
The report follows demands from
the industry for urgent action by the
British government to help maintain
vital exploration and development,
especially after the Department of
Energy and Climate Change said
exploration had decreased by 75% in
this year’s first quarter.
The British government last year
introduced a supplementary tax of
10% over the standard rate of corporation tax to raise revenues, a tax hike
that occurred when international
prices for oil and gas were high and
going higher.

Windfall tax
Since then—in the wake of falling oil and gas prices—the government has moved to reduce the
windfall tax burden, in the unlikely
hope that would spur production of
an additional 2 billion bbl of North
Sea oil.
But the committee clearly feels
that has not worked and it wants
more action taken.
It is not clear what will move
Brown to act. Without doubt, being a
tax and spend man, he would like to
see increased production as a means
of generating more tax revenues for
his government to spend.
But with a general election due in
Britain next year, we suspect it is the
figure of 50,000 jobs on the line that
will resonate most roundly at Number 10 Downing Street.
Be that as it may, whatever moves
Brown to act will be welcomed by
the oil and gas industry—and the
sooner the better. ✦

yet reached a “tipping point,” however,
after which the trade more resembles
the oil trade. But he thinks that point is
near.
There has been a “deepening of
markets,” he said, that is good for the
industry and good for the natural gas
consumer.
This state of the global industry, currently moderate prices, and prospects
for their continuing at that level ensure
natural gas availability and affordability,
said Cooper.

US picture
Two effects of industry’s evolution, at
least in the US, said Cooper, are that:
• The industry will not again see
LNG terminals being mothballed as
they were in the 1980s.
• The time has passed when LNG
developers plan terminals along the
US Gulf Coast to use the extensive gas
pipeline network to reach major markets in the Midwest and Northeast.
Must surplus global supply come to
the US because of its greater liquidity
and storage capacity? Not necessarily,
Cooper said. For one thing, US storage
is closing in on full with levels well
ahead of their 5-year average for June.
And Cooper again cites the greater trade
flexibility.
He also believes that, after the current crop of LNG terminals is completed and commissioned, the US market
will likely enter a flat period when no
new terminals will be built. Permitted
projects that continue to fight through
local resistance toward fruition can continue that effort so long as the sponsors
are willing to pay the legal and other
costs. He cited the Sparrows Point, Md.,
project as an example of one that seems
to be making headway against stiff opposition.
This month, OGJ data show, two
North American terminals are being
commissioned: Canaport LNG’s St. John,
NB, site and Sempra’s Cameron terminal
near Hackberry, La., just downstream
from Trunkline LNG’s Lake Charles
terminal.

of 1.3 bcfd from two full-containment

Gazprom seeks to rattle EU with Azerbaijan gas agreement
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Russia’s OAO Gazprom, in an apparent effort to exert greater control over
the European Union’s energy supplies,
signed an agreement to import natural
gas from Azerbaijan and transport it to
Europe.
Under its agreement with State Oil
Co. of the Azerbaijan Republic, Gazprom has secured the supply of 500
million cu m/year of gas starting Jan.
1, 2010.
Gazprom Chief Executive Officer
Alexei Miller, who this week accompanied Russia’s President Dmitry Medvedev on a flying visit to Baku, acknowledged the amount of gas as small but,
eyeing future growth potential, said,
“Well begun is half done.”
That view was apparently endorsed
by Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev
who said, “We plan in the future to
increase supplies as the volume of
Azerbaijani natural gas production
goes up.”
Aliyev noted the “commercial character” of the contract and played down
any political overtones that might
be read into it. “It is very important
because the theme of gas relations has
been groundlessly politicized lately,”
said Aliyev.
“For us this is an opportunity to enter a new market. The agreement fully
meets our interests and has a good
future,” Aliyev said.
The Russian president also played
down the political dimensions of the
agreement, saying it was necessitated
by the need to develop bilateral cooperation between the countries and to

ensure energy supplies.
Medvedev said it was “extremely
important” that “the two countries
that consider energy resources as one
of the main riches have not only come
to agreement but see big prospects not
for political reasons but out of mutual
benefit.”
Medvedev said, “This is the energy
security we have been talking about so
much lately,” adding, “Such exemplary
agreements can serve as an example for
others to follow.”

European unease
Despite the assurances of both
presidents, the agreement between
them is likely to stir some unease in
Europe—especially following Gazprom’s agreement with Nigeria last
week, also regarding gas supplies.
In fact, the formation of the 50-50
joint venture of Gazprom and Nigerian
National Petroleum Corp. (Nigaz) has
caused concerns in Europe’s capitals
which see Nigerian gas as a way of
reducing their dependence on Russia,
which already supplies up to half the
gas consumed by the EU.
Nigaz intends to explore for gas and
to develop infrastructure for its development and transport—even including
a section of pipeline that could form
part of a proposed trans-Sahara pipeline to export gas directly to Europe.
The EU even has pledged political
and economic backing for the transSahara pipeline, but in the absence of a
Western consortium to emerge to fund
and build the project, Gazprom looks
to step into the gap.
Boris Ivanov, head of Gazprom
International, played on Europe’s

concerns, saying, “We will take part
in building the first segment of gas
pipeline from southwestern Nigeria
northwards.”
Underlining Gazprom’s determination to be Europe’s supplier, regardless
of European sentiments, he said, “If
[the] trans-Sahara pipeline is realized,
it [the Gazprom segment] will be its
first segment.”
Meanwhile, concerns in Europe
over the agreement between Moscow
and Baku will be focused on supplies
for the Nabucco pipeline, which is
designed to bolster the EU’s energy
security by circumventing Russia and
carrying gas directly to Europe from
Azerbaijan’s Shah Deniz field in the
Caspian Sea.
However, according to Miller, also
in words calculated to cause concern
in the capitals of Europe, Gazprom
has been promised priority in buying
gas from the second phase of the Shah
Deniz field—the very source Europe is
counting on as a main point of supply
for the Nabucco line.
Azerbaijan expects to reach production of 9 billion cu m/year by 2010
within the first stage of Shah Deniz
1, while Shah Deniz 2—expected to
come online in 2014—might produce
10-15 billion cu m/year according to
state officials.
How much of that will go to Russia
remains to be seen. While the Russians appear eager to play on European
anxieties, independent analysts suggest
that Baku is unlikely to jeopardize its
independence from Moscow by supplying Russia with large amounts of
gas, especially at the expense of its
political allies in the EU. ✦

Shale plays push up US gas resource estimate
Reevaluation of shale plays has
pushed the Potential Gas Committee’s assessment of the US natural gas
resource to its highest level ever.
The PGC, guided by the Potential
Gas Agency of the Colorado School of
Mines, raised its biennial assessment to
1,836 tcf at yearend 2008 from 1,321
tcf at yearend 2006.
The committee has been reporting
resource estimates for 44 years.
The 2008 assessment ascribes 1,673
tcf of gas to traditional reservoirs, up
45% from the 2006 report, and 163 tcf
to coalbed methane reservoirs, down
1.9%.
The technically recoverable resource
in the new assessment combines with
the US Department of Energy’s gas
reserves estimate of 238 tcf to project
total future supply of 2,074 tcf. That’s

542 tcf above the 2006 total.
“Our knowledge of the geological
endowment of technically recoverable
gas continues to improve with each assessment,” said John B. Curtis, professor
of geology and geological engineering
and director of the Potential Gas Agency.
“Furthermore, new and advanced exploration, well drilling, and completion
technologies are allowing us increasingly better access to domestic gas
resources—especially ‘unconventional’
gas—which not all that long ago were
considered impractical or uneconomical
to pursue.”
Shale gas accounts for 616 tcf of the
new estimate of technically recoverable
gas.
The richest US resource area remains
the Gulf Coast, including the continental shelf and slope and deep water. Next

richest is the Rocky Mountain region,
followed by the Atlantic and Midcontinent areas. Those areas account for 87%
of the resource total.
The largest volumetric and percentage increases over the 2006 report
resulted from reassessment of shale
plays in the Appalachian, Arkoma, Forth
Worth, and Uinta basins and in several
basins of the Gulf Coast.
The 2008 assessment of traditional
resources includes mean values (not
arithmetically additive to subtotals) of
441.4 tcf of probable resources (current
fields), 736.9 tcf of possible resources
(new fields), and 500.7 tcf of speculative resources (frontiers).
The coalbed gas assessment includes 14.2 tcf of probable, 49.8 tcf
of possible, and 98.9 tcf of speculative
resources. ✦

A/S Norske Shell has drilled a
potentially large gas discovery in the
Norwegian Sea in the deepest water
of any find there, said the Norwegian
Petroleum Directorate.
The 6603/12-1 well on the Gro
prospect in 1,376 m of water cut a
16-m gas column in a reservoir of varying quality of Upper Cretaceous age.
In light of the variations in reservoir
quality, the NPD estimated the range
of recoverable gas at between 353 bcf
and 3.5 tcf. The well was not formation tested, but the operator performed
extensive sampling and data acquisition.
“Further delineation drilling is
needed in order to clarify the resource
potential, including the possibility of
additional volumes,” the NPD said, and
may indicate a petroleum system that
extends farther to the west where no
drilling has taken place.

In the Neuquen basin, Apache
finalized the extension of eight federal
development blocks that cover 590,000
acres and produce 7,000 b/d of oil and
100 MMcfd of gas. The government
extended the lease 10 years to 2027.
Apache has a capital commitment of
$320 million on the lease.
Apache drilled nine wells in Ranquil

3-7 MMcfd/well in the quarter ended
Mar. 31.
In the Austral basin, Apache plans
to drill two development wells near
its Bajo Guadaloso X-2001 discovery,
which tested 2.4 MMcfd of gas and 300

Production
produced-water surface
disposal facilities, using
evaporation ponds, are raising regulatory and public concerns in the Western
US. Various studies have identified
VOC emissions as contributors to
ground-level ozone formation.
Currently the US Environmental
Protection Agency regulates VOC
under the Clean Air Act (CAA).
VOC and HAP emission odors and
vapors may raise health concerns for
operators and the public, especially
near populated areas.
Increasing urbanization and more
stringent state and federal regulations
aimed at protecting human health and
the environment from harmful HAP is
making it more difficult for owners and
operators of produced-water disposal facilities using evaporation ponds to meet
VOC and HAP emission limitations.
Current VOC and HAP estimation
methods required by regulators in Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, New Mexico,
and Montana may overestimate VOC and
HAP emission levels. This overestimation creates a controversy among regulators, concerned public, environmentalists, and owners of produced-water
facilities over the continued viability of
evaporation ponds as a produced-water
disposal method.
Existing and emerging engineering
controls may reduce or destroy VOC and
HAP before their release into the ambient air. These control technologies could
increase produced-water disposal facility profitability and potentially generate
sufficient revenue to cover or at least
help defray their capital cost.

Produced water
Produced water represents the largest
waste stream volume generated by the
oil and gas industry during exploration and production. Each year the US
generates about 20 billion bbl of pro-

duced water.1 The Western US, including Wyoming, New Mexico, Colorado,
Utah, and Montana (Fig. 1), produced
2.6 billion bbl in 2002.1 This volume
is about four times the yearly culinary

metropolitan area.

and analyze water samples for TPHGRO, TPH-DRO, BTEX, and methanol.
Required sampling frequency could
be up to a sample every 2,000 bbl of
produced water accepted by the facility
for disposal.
Potential emission estimates are
based on the assumption that 100% of
the TPH, BTEX, and methanol volatilize.

Rules in New Mexico
New Mexico MAC Title 20, Chapter
2, Parts 70, 72, and 74 (NMAC 2009),
establishes limits for existing and new
facilities. New stationary sources of VOC
need a permit if the emission rates are
greater than 10 lb/hr or 25 tons/year.
It bases VOC emission estimates on
water concentrations of TPH and HAP
and 100% volatilization of hydrocarbons from the water.

Rules in Montana
The Montana Department of Environmental Quality regulates and enforces major and minor sources of HAP
under the federal Title V program.
Title V bases limits on major sources
as those emitting 10 tons/year of any

may require a Title V permit without
first obtaining a Montana Air Quality
Permit if the calculated potential to emit
is between 10 and 25 tons/year.
In general, most major sources require both an MAQP and a Title V permit.

knowledge is
Technologies developed for the offshore exploration and production
industry represent years of accumulated knowledge, then applying that
knowledge as the industry continually goes into deeper water.

Knowledge is YOUR EDGE in taking what others
have learned and applying it to your next project
In 2010, Deep Offshore Technology (DOT) returns to Houston, Texas,
February 2 - 4. Make plans now to exhibit your company’s solutions,
innovations, lessons learned, and new technologies with industry
colleagues. You will not want to miss the networking opportunities as we
bring you this extremely focused, international event.

Practical Experience, not Theories!
For over 29 years, DOT has attracted a select group of conference
delegates who thirst for knowledge of lessons learned versus the
theoretical, scientific papers of other conferences. Those delegates
want to know what technologies and solutions work today in some of the
harshest drilling environments known to the industry. They might be ready
to put your solutions into practice on their next project tomorrow and not
wait for the theoretical solutions that may take years to refine.

Flagship Media Sponsors:

Supporting Organization:

If your company wants to reach decision makers in the
deepwater E&P industry, then exhibiting at DOT is essential.

FIRST-HALF 2009

While economic activity in North
America remained weak during first
and second-quarters of 2009, petrochemical industry developments call
into question the most bearish views of
a protracted global economic recession
for 2009-10.
Specifically, ethylene production
began to rebound during first-quarter
2009, and the rebound was stronger
than forecast in fourthquarter 2008. Exports
of all major ethylene
derivatives rebounded
in first-quarter 2009.
These trends indicate
that worst-case scenarios need to be replaced
with moderately optimistic and more
realistic forecasts for third and fourthquarters 2009.

LPG feeds accounted for only 67% of

Ethylene producers began to swing
back to lighter feeds in January 2009
and continued to increase LPG feeds
through April. LPG feeds accounted for
71% of total fresh feed in first-quarter

9.3% lower than year-earlier levels during fourth-quarter 2008.
EIA reported that refinery-grade propylene sales during fourth-quarter 2008
averaged 36.0 million lb/day and were
43 million lb more than in third-quarter 2008 (about 1.2 days’ production).
Refinery-grade propylene sales averaged
34.7 million lb/day during first-quarter
2009 and were 186 million lb less than
in fourth-quarter 2008 (about 5.2 days’
production).
Domestic propylene supply from
both sources totaled 5.66 billion lb in
fourth-quarter 2008 and was 182.5
million lb less than in third-quarter
2008. Domestic production declined
again in first-quarter 2009 and totaled

less than in fourth-quarter 2008 and
1.38 billion lb less than year-earlier
volumes.

and refinery merchant propylene sales.

Ethylene production costs
Consistent with the accelerating
decline in crude oil prices during
fourth-quarter 2008, production costs
for ethylene in the Houston Ship Channel (based on full spot prices for all
coproducts) declined by 55-65% during fourth-quarter 2008. Production

costs for ethane averaged 15-16¢/lb
during fourth-quarter 2008 vs. 41-42¢/
lb in third-quarter 2008. Production
costs for propane declined to 18-19¢/
lb in fourth-quarter 2008 vs. 42-43¢/lb
in third-quarter 2008. Production costs
for natural gasoline posted the largest
decline during fourth-quarter 2008 and
averaged 17-18¢/lb vs. 49-51¢/lb in
third-quarter 2008.
Feedstock prices continued to decline during first-quarter 2009 but the
rate of decline was measurably slower
than during fourth-quarter 2008. ProFeedstock prices, coproduct
values, and ethylene plant yields
determine ethylene production costs.
Petral maintains direct contact with
the oleﬁn industry and tracks historic
trends in spot prices for ethylene
and propylene. We use a variety of
sources to track trends in feedstock
prices.
Some ethylene plants have the
necessary process units to convert all
coproducts to purity streams. Some
ethylene plants, however, do not have
the capability to upgrade mixed or
crude streams of various coproducts
and sell some or all their coproducts
at discounted prices. We evaluate
ethylene production costs in this
article based on all coproducts valued
at spot prices.

duction costs averaged 13.5-14.5¢/lb
for ethane, 19-20¢/lb for propane and
22.5-23.5¢/lb for natural gasoline.
Average production costs for natural gasoline during fourth-quarter
2008 were only 1.5¢/lb higher than
ethane and were 1¢/lb lower than for
propane. However, prices for natural
gasoline were depressed because prices
for unleaded regular were unusually
weak throughout the fourth-quarter.
Prices for unleaded regular gasoline
rebounded during first-quarter 2009
but coproduct prices remained relatively weak. Average production costs
for natural gasoline during first-quarter
2009 were 9¢/lb higher than for ethane
and 3¢/lb higher than for propane.
Crude oil production cuts by OPEC
began to have their full impact during second-quarter 2009. Prices for
crude oil and unleaded regular gasoline increased by 30-35% Prices for all
ethylene feedstocks were also higher in
second-quarter 2009. Ethylene production costs increased to 15-17¢/lb based
on ethane and 16-18¢/lb based on propane. Variable production costs based
on light naphthas and natural gasoline
increased to 23-26¢/lb.
Ethane again benefited from strong
economic support in both LPG plants
and multifeed crackers during first and
second-quarter 2009. Ethane’s share of
fresh feed to LPG plants increased to

84% in March and averaged 82% during first-quarter 2009 vs. the historic
norm of 74-78%. Ethane’s share of
fresh feed to multifeed crackers increased to 38% in first-quarter 2009 vs.
34% during fourth-quarter 2008.

Ethylene pricing, margins
Contract prices for ethylene averaged
38.9¢/lb in fourth-quarter 2008, or
28.9¢/lb (42.6%) lower than in thirdquarter 2008. During fourth-quarter
2008, contract prices fell to 28.25¢/
lb in December from 50.75¢/lb in
October.
After the extraordinary volatility of
2008, contract prices varied by fewer
than 2¢/lb during first-quarter 2009
and averaged 31.3¢/lb. The industry
most often negotiates contract prices
for ethylene retroactively, usually 30 to
60 days after the end of the contract
month. Contract prices for April and
May settled at 30.25¢/lb for May.
Spot prices for ethylene averaged
23.3¢/lb for fourth-quarter 2008 and
were 32.2¢/lb, or 58.2% lower than
third-quarter average. During fourthquarter 2008, spot prices averaged
33.5¢/lb in October but fell to 17.2¢/lb
in December.
Spot prices began to rebound from
the December low and averaged 25.0¢/
lb in January 2009 and 28.4¢/lb in
February 2009. Spot prices slipped in
March and averaged 25.7¢/lb. For the
full quarter, spot ethylene prices averaged 26.4¢/lb, or 9.2¢/lb higher than
in December 2008.
The increase in ethylene production
in April and May ended the rally in spot
prices. These averaged 21-22¢/lb in
May, but rising feedstock prices pushed
them to 26-27¢/lb in June. We estimate

We determine the incremental
value of octane by tracking the differential between unleaded premium
unleaded regular gasoline prices
divided by the difference in octane
(87 octane for unleaded regular
gasoline and 93 octane for unleaded
premium gasoline). Octane values are
a primary economic inﬂuence on spot
prices for reﬁnery-grade propylene
and toluene. Trends in spot prices for
these two coproducts tend to drive
prices for other coproducts.

fourth-quarter 2008, however, averaged
2.06¢/octane-gal and were almost unchanged from average of 2.07¢/octanegal for third-quarter 2008.
During first-quarter 2009, octane
values varied from 2.0¢/octane-gal in
February to 1.5¢/octane-gal in March
and averaged 1.7¢/octane-gal for the
quarter. Octane values rebounded to
2.03¢/octane-gal in April and 2.33¢/
octane-gal in May.
Fig. 6 illustrates trends in octane
values

Spot prices for refinery-grade
propylene averaged 22.2¢/lb during
fourth-quarter 2008 and were 42.1¢/

third-quarter 2008. Spot prices fell to
a low of 12.8¢/lb in December 2008
from 36.9¢/lb in October 2008. Refinery-grade propylene prices averaged
only 0.75¢/lb higher than unleaded

than unleaded regular gasoline prices in
November/December 2008.
Spot prices for refinery-grade propylene increased to 19.3¢/lb in January
and 24.6¢/lb in February. For full firstquarter 2009, spot RGP prices averaged
21.5¢/lb and were 1.7¢/lb higher than
unleaded regular gasoline. Spot prices
remained within the first-quarter range
in April but jumped to 33-35¢/lb in
May. Spot prices for the second quarter
were an estimated 30¢/lb.
From the October settlement of
60¢/lb, contract prices for polymergrade propylene collapsed during
fourth-quarter 2008 and settled at 20¢/
lb in December. For the fourth quarter,
contract prices for polymer-grade propylene averaged 36.7¢/lb, or 14.5¢/lb
higher than spot refinery-grade propylene prices.
Contract prices increased to 22¢/lb
in January and 29¢/lb for March and
April. Contract prices increased again in
May and settled at 31.5¢/lb.

Summer-fall 2009 outlook
Spot prices for West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell to a monthly average
of $39.15 in February 2009 but rallied
to $49.82/bbl in April and $59.00/
bbl in May. Following the historic
collapse in prices during third and
fourth-quarter 2008, the rebound in
crude oil prices during March was not
surprising. The shift to sharply higher
prices during April/May, however, was
unexpected.
We reviewed trends in pricing
for other benchmarks such as dated
Brent and Dubai/Oman and trends in
differentials between WTI and other
benchmarks. This review suggested
that production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
and slower but continued growth in
demand in Asia and other economies
of countries outside the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (non-OECD) were sufficient
to reverse the collapse in prices during third and fourth quarters 2008.
We also note, however, that demand in
OECD countries remains weak. OPEC

has achieved better compliance with its
series of production quota agreements
than expected early in fourth-quarter
2008.
We revised our price forecast to
$50/bbl in late April. Escalation of
tensions in Nigeria, however, increased
the supply risk to Nigeria’s crude oil
production of 2 million b/d. Threats
to Nigerian crude oil production will
reinforce bullish influences of OPEC
production curtailments and demand
growth in non-OECD economies.
Forecasts are now based on WTI prices
of $55-65/bbl for third and fourth
quarters 2009.
Ethylene production costs (full cash
costs) are likely to be in the range of
18-24¢/lb for third and fourth quarters
for ethane and propane and 30-33¢/
lb for natural gasoline. Spot ethylene
prices are to average 22-24¢/lb. Profit
margins are to average 2-4¢/lb for
purity ethane and break even for purity
propane. Profit margins for natural
gasoline are to average 7-10¢/lb below
break-even. ✦

occurs when NORM enter the body,
which poses a far greater concern than
external radiation exposure because
radioactive isotopes that enter the body
may not be eliminated from the body
for several decades and result in a cumulative dose build up.
There are three possible internal
exposure pathways:
• Inhalation of NORM-contaminated
dust or radon gas.
• Ingestion of NORM-contaminated
particulates or liquids.
• Absorption of NORM-contaminated particulates or liquids through open
cuts on the skin.
Long-term exposure to NORM can
lead to increased risk of cancer, just as
similar exposure to asbestos, coal dust,
and cigarette smoke can cause lung
cancer.2

Guidelines in Alberta
In Canada, working with man-made
radioactive sources falls under federal
jurisdiction and is regulated by the
Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission.
NORM are exempt from CNSC legislation except for the import, export,
and transportation of the material. The
jurisdiction over radiation exposure
to NORM is thus the responsibility of
each Canadian province and territory. To
date, the province of Alberta has not yet
implemented NORM-specific legislation
or regulations.
In 2000, Health Canada published
the Canadian Guidelines for the Management of NORM, prepared by the
Federal Provincial Territorial Radiation
Protection Committee. These guidelines
establish safe practices for management
of NORM in Canada to protect workers
and the public from situations in which
NORM have been concentrated as a
result of industrial activities.
The guidelines establish four NORM
thresholds; natural background radiation is excluded from the dose limitations.
• Investigation threshold: A sitespecific assessment should be carried
out where doses exceed an incremental
dose of 0.3 millisievert/year.

• NORM management threshold:
an assessed incremental dose of greater
than 0.3 millisievert/year.
• Dose management threshold: an
assessed incremental dose of 1 millisievert/year.
• Radiation protection management
threshold: an assessed or measured incremental dose of 5 millisievert/year.
(Sievert is an SI unit measuring the
extent of tissue damage resulting from
radiation adsorption. In the US, it is
measured in units of millirem; 1 mSv =
100 mrem.)
The guidelines also address management of NORM-contaminated waste.
The unconditional derived release limit
(UDRL) for fixed surface contamination
is 1 Bq/sq cm averaged over a 100 sq
cm area. NORM-contaminated scales,
sludges, and waste above the UDRL of
0.3 Bq/g must be sent to a licensed
NORM disposal site.
(A Becquerel, Bq, is an SI unit of
radioactivity; 1 Bq = the activity of

In Alberta, typical average background radiation is in the range of 60120 millisievert/hr (60e-6 to 120e-6
millisievert/hr) according to Normcan,
Calgary.

NORM survey
In September 2005 and July 2006, a
certified radiation safety officer conducted a NORM gamma screening
survey at Jumping Pound. The officer
used a calibrated Ludlum 3-97 General
Purpose Survey Meter that incorporates
both an internal 1-in. by 1-in. sodium
iodide (Na-I) scintillator and an external 44-9 Geiger-Mueller pancake probe
(Fig. 4).
The survey entailed data logging
gamma radiation levels on the exterior
of piping, vessels, and equipment. Measurements were taken within 1 to 3 cm
from external surfaces and at a distance
of 0.5 m. Gamma scintillation surveys
provide a rapid and efficient means of
screening a facility for the presence of
NORM, allowing for an evaluation of
the presence of NORM from the exte62

rior of operating equipment without
taking the equipment out of service.
The survey revealed that NORM
were present within the Deepcut unit,
LPG loading areas, propane storage
bullets, sour-water slop tank, and inlet
slug catcher. The highest readings were
found on the downstream propane
treater filter.
While the vessels and equipment are
in operation and sealed, the exposure
levels to incidental workers were determined to be less than the dose-management threshold of 1.0 millisievert/year.

ment (PPE) when blinding the treaters
and entering the vessels. The regular PPE
would include boots, gloves, hardhat,
and safety glasses.
Dust control would not be a major
issue to address throughout the removal
procedure. Workers around the perimeter of the job site, for example, would
not wear additional respiratory protection, and sealed storage bins would not
be required to control any dust generated during removal of spent molecular
sieve. Finally, spent molecular sieve that
is not NORM-contaminated would be
sent to a regular industrial landfill.
The presence of NORM in the propane treaters required additional health
and safety and waste-management
measures. With no plan for dust suppression, NORM-contaminated dust
would be deposited around the job
site during removal of spent molecular
sieve. Moreover, without disposable PPE,
NORM-contaminated dust may remain
on workers’ coveralls, boots, and gloves,
creating a potential for inhalation or
ingestion of the dust.
Extensive planning started about 1
year before execution of the project.
Due to the collective lack of experience on site with NORM, many of the
planning meetings were focused on
NORM handling. The planners of the
job were unsure how the presence of
NORM would affect safe work practices
at Jumping Pound. Thus, Normcan, a
contractor with experience handling
NORM, was brought on site.

tion to regular PPE. Once the task was
completed, they went into a disposal
area, where each worker was measured
for NORM contamination with Ludlum
44-9 Geiger-Mueller pancake probe.
Once proven clear of contamination,
workers were then directed to remove
and dispose of all disposable PPE.
Once the treaters were opened to the
atmosphere, the manways, mesh screen,
molecular sieve, and inner surface of
the vessels were tested for NORM readings by the radiation safety officer, who
obtained measurements from within
1-3 cm from the surface.
NORM contamination above the
UDRL was found on the manways, grating, mesh screen, and interior surface
of the treaters that were not in contact
with the molecular sieve. The molecular
sieve and interior surface of the treaters
that came in contact with the molecular
sieve, however, had readings below the
UDRL limit.
During removal of the spent molecular sieve, workers wore the appropriate
PPE and SABA. Once the molecular sieve
was removed, inspectors who entered
the vessels wore HEPA P-100 filters
in addition to the appropriate PPE, as
specified by the plan. Once the job was
completed, all personnel were measured
for surface contamination on their PPE
and then disposed of all disposable PPE.
Throughout the job, readings taken
on all workers’ regular PPE, disposable
PPE, HEPA P-100 filters, and SABA were
below the UDRL.

filled, a dedicated operator diverted excess water and gasses to the sealed bins
provided by Normcan.
It took 9 hr to fill the treater, which
included the holding duration. Once
the tower was completely flooded, it
was drained. Nitrogen was introduced
at the top of the tower to force the
water out and into the sealed bin. That
process took 1.75 hr.
The second treater, V-3020B, was
filled at a slower but continuous rate in
6 hr at 33 cu m/day. This treater was
also allowed to overflow to the storage
bins, before filling was stopped. The
drain process was the same as for treater
V-3020A.
During the job execution, two aspects did not proceed as planned:
• Although the operations engineer
had calculated a flow rate for flooding, the rate could not be maintained
because it was too low to control with
a ball valve. The calculated flooding rate
based on the contractor’s recommendation may not have been the preferred
flow rate for this job.
• Much time and energy was invested in installing temporary piping
and hose connection to flare to accommodate the substantial exothermic
reaction that had been anticipated. The
temporary 50.8 mm piping and hose
connection were not used to direct
steam generated to flare. Instead, the
existing 25.4 mm piping was used to
route expelled gasses and steam to flare.
After further discussion, it was believed
that the waterflood rate was sufficient to
dampen the exothermic reaction.

Ludlum 3-97 scintillator. Absence of
readings above the background radiation allowed for the disposal of the
water into Jumping Pound’s sour-water
disposal well.
Spent molecular sieve was vacuumed from the vessels to the sealed
bins, which were transported away
by Normcan. Although field readings
measured on the spent molecular sieve
were below the UDRL, it was suspected
that the molecular-sieve pellets might
not meet the limit. The radiation safety
officer suspected field readings below
the UDRL due to the geometric shape
of the pellets, absorption of the particles
into the molecular sieve itself, and potential shielding of beta particles from
the field detector due to other contaminates surrounding the pellets.
Thus, a laboratory analysis verified
the contamination levels, confirming
that the spent molecular sieve exceeded
the UDRL threshold requiring NORMspecific waste-management practices
as outlined by Health Canada’s NORM
Guidelines. Two samples of spent molecular sieve that were analyzed showed
1.0 Bq/g and 2.1 Bq/g of Lead 210.
Since the samples showed readings
greater than the unrestricted release
limit of 0.3 Bq/g, the spent molecular
sieve was not sent to an industrial landfill but to a salt cavern in Unity, Sask.

used throughout the job worked well in
terms of:
—Eliminating workers’ contact with
NORM-contaminated dust and equipment.
—Workers feeling comfortable with
their tasks.
—Providing confidence to workers
to perform the job.
—The deactivation method of
waterflooding had proven to minimize
personnel exposure to NORM-contaminated dust. The continuous fill method
of treater V-3020B proved to be more
successful than the fill and hold method
of treater V-3020A.
On V-3020A, spent molecular sieve
in the upper layers of the bed was easily
removed. The pellets, however, were
progressively wetter down the vessel.
Towards its bottom, the pellets were
stuck together and had hardened to
a consistency similar to wet clay. This
prevented use of a vacuum and led
workers to resort to jackhammers. As a
result, the job fell behind schedule by a
few hours.
On the other hand, the spent molecular sieve in V-3020B was not soggy
and thus was easily removed. Because
water was immediately drained as soon
as the vessel was fully flooded, however,
the bed did not have sufficient time to
cool.
Its top was too hot for workers to
stand on in order to insert the vacuum
hose for removal. A Raytek temperature
gun measured the top layer of the bed
at 95° C. The temperature subsided
progressively down the vessel. The high
temperature also resulted in a delay of a
few hours.
It was hence determined a combination of the two flooding methods
would have achieved greater success:
continuous fill and a short hold once
the vessel was fully flooded before
draining the vessel.

The costs of two important chemicals used in crude-oil refining changed
very little during 2006-08, while the
costs of three others varied significantly.
The two stable chemicals were hydrofluoric acid with an index constant
of 414.9 and sulfuric acid with an
index average of 397.4.
Platinum rose significantly to
1,768.7 from 762.1 in the first quarter
of 2006 before falling back to 1,114 in

the last quarter of 2008. However, the
average for 2006 was 1,344.4 vs. the
1,524.5 average for 2008.
Sodium hydroxide rose to 1,054.4
in fourth-quarter 2008 from 586.2 in

response times, even
with existing field equipment. Wingas undertook such upgrades
on the largest underground gas storage
site in Europe: Rehden in
Lower Saxony, Germany
(Fig. 1).

Bertrand Viala

Background

Until recently storage
facilities acted purely as
a compensating buffer between producer and consumer,
making up for seasonal fluctuations in
demand for natural gas. During cold
months of the year, European demand
can rise to 10-15 times its summer
level. Extraction of natural gas, however,
is a continuous process, transport via
high-pressure pipelines is more efficient
without interruption, and import quantities are often agreed for long terms.

German domestic production of
natural gas barely covers one-fifth of
its demand, which continues to rise,
increasing dependence on imported
gas. In this context, natural gas storage
facilities help ensure a permanent supply of energy. The ongoing liberalization of Europe’s natural gas market has
heightened the role of storage facilities
in terms of energy policy; non-discriminating access to the gas supply network
requiring access to storage facilities.
Free access for third parties and
increased natural gas spot and futures
trading require the supply of large
amounts of natural gas at short notice,
creating a new situation for storage
operators and requiring increasingly
flexible approaches in running their
facilities.

Rehden

More than 600 operational natural
gas storage facilities operate worldwide,
with a working capacity of about 340
bcm.1 Roughly 25% of the storage facilities are in Europe, storing more than
60% of the world’s total working gas.1
Germany is the
largest storage nation in Europe and
the fourth largest
in the world. The
Rehden natural gas
facility is about 60
km south of Bremen. Wintershall
AG discovered
and developed the
original field in
the 1950s.

2 weeks conversion time in situ and a
4-week total shutdown of the natural gas
storage facility. At an early stage Rosberg
said it could shorten the shutdown by
at least 2 weeks, persuading Wingas that
PCS 7 AS-417 controllers would result in
greater economic efficiency and a more
capable system. The 16 new automation
systems replaced various subsystems,
lowering both preventive and corrective maintenance costs and total cost of
ownership (TCO).

Maximum natural pressure of
the Rehden gas reservoir is 280 bar.

Proprietary programmable

When changes in the gas
market required more flexible operations management,
Wingas hired automation
specialists Rosberg Engineering GMBH to modernize
instrumentation and control
systems. Besides meeting its
general future needs, Wingas
sought a system with short

Rosberg rejected both approaches,
relying instead on presentations to
show the framework Simatic PCS 7

technique increased comfort and enabled standardization of user interfaces,
offering the same control facilities for
operator control, visualization, alarm
displaying, etc., in respect to components of the same type.

team to access remotely followed initial

Knowledge gained flowed
back into engineering planning for the new system.
This process and the use
of extensive software-aided
simulation shortened the
time needed on site for adaptation to the dynamic processes. The entire operating
team also became familiar
with the new operator control system well in advance,
allowing personnel to start
working immediately on it
without additional training.

Implementation
Cooperation between
operating personnel, project
management, and project
engineers allowed Rosberg
to get even further ahead of
schedule. IT specialists linked
the new process control
system to existing doubly redundant bus systems. Switches allowed
building different logical networks by
way of the same physical layer. Reuse of
both the system bus and the terminal
bus occurred despite the change in systems and temporary joint use of both at
the same time.

Wingas into 3 days of restricted opera-

New system provides oil ﬁeld rescue
Here’s the new Rollgliss R500 rescue
and escape device, a system that offers
controlled descent, self-rescue, emergency
evacuation, and assisted rescue with lifting
capabilities.
To ensure quick and
safe rescue, the R500
features controlled
descent speeds of 2-3
fps. Its bidirectional design allows one end of
the lifeline to descend
while the other ascends
to prepare for another
rescue. The compact
and lightweight device
can be positioned and
installed quickly, and
easy operation enables
efficient and effective
rescue, the firm notes.
The system is suited
for self-rescue, multiple evacuations, and

assisted rescue on offshore and onshore oil
field locations.
For maximum durability and performance, the device is designed with highquality and corrosion resistant materials,
as well as 9.5 mm superstatic kernmantle
rope available in 25 ft increments between
50 and 1,000 ft in length. The rope is configured with connecting hardware at each
end of the lifeline for bidirectional rescue.
The system can be used at heights of as
much as 1,000 ft for a single user weighing 310 lb or less or 330 ft for two users
totaling 550 lb or less.
The R500 meets all applicable industry standards, including OSHA and ANSI
Z359.4-2007, and is available in five models. Each model includes the Rollgliss R500
descender, rope, three anchoring slings,
three carabiners, pulley, edge protector,
rope grab, and carrying bag. Additional options are a rescue hub, ladder bracket, and
humidity-resistant case.

New oil ﬁeld seal
This new seal is designed to help
increase uptime and efficiency by as
much 150% in oil field
equipment.
The seal consists
of a spring-energized,
graphite-reinforced
PTFE sealing ring
coupled with a hightemperature engineered
thermoplastic antiextrusion element and a metal locking ring.
The maker says the seal has been successfully tested and proved to deliver superior
performance in progressive cavity pumps.
Other potential applications include top
drives, mud pumps, downhole tools, and
high-speed rotary devices.
Its all-in-one configuration protects it
against wear and extrusion and helps make
it resistant to oil field fluids and gases, the
firm points out.

From the Subscribers Only area of

A new government
foray: commerce in
highway rest areas
Government is encroaching into private
affairs in ways other than the big-headline
issues like automaker takeovers and fuel
selection. It’s even sneaking up on interstate highways. Businesses that sell fuel,
food, and services along US highways
worry about pressure to commercialize
interstate rights-of-way.
When Congress created the interstate
highway system in 1956, local communities

naturally worried about harm to commerce.
So lawmakers prohibited the offer of commercial services in rest areas built on interstate highways after Jan. 1, 1960. Some
states want that to change. This year a
transportation agency in Virginia approved
a resolution supporting sales of food and
fuel at rest areas.
California, Oregon, and Washington, are
considering an “alternative-fuels corridor”
along Interstate 5 and want to be able dispense fuel from government-run facilities
in rest areas. And past highway bills have
contained proposals for a pilot program
allowing as many as 10 states to test commercial activities in rest areas.
Existing businesses adjacent to interstate highways oppose these initiatives, of
course. They’d suffer competitive disadvantages from fuel and food stops more easily
accessible by motorists than their own. And
they know their new competitors would
extract other favors from state patrons.
One idea for the alternative-fuel corridor,
for example, is to excuse state-sponsored
rest-area businesses from rent payments
until they’re proﬁtable.
A group called Partnership to Save
Highway Communities is working to keep
rest-area commercialization out of highway
reauthorization legislation being drafted
by the House Committee on Transportation
and Infrastructure.
Another group opposed to commercialization, NATSO, representing travel plazas
and truckstops, estimates that more than
60,000 businesses, employing at least 2
million people, have developed along interstate highways. It cites a 2003 University
of Maryland study estimating commercialization would close as many as half those
businesses. To anyone conﬁdent about free
markets, commercialization is repugnant.
As they appeal for public support,
though, opponents would help their cause
by encouraging roadside businesses to
perform better than many of them do at
keeping restrooms clean, windshield rinses
clear, and towel dispensers full.

Lack of peace boosts prices
Crude prices are sure to rise since “world peace isn’t breaking out,” said analysts
in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc.
They said, “A geopolitical risk premium of some magnitude looks set to remain
in oil prices on a permanent basis. As the market comes to recognize this reality,
combined with improving visibility on global oil demand, we look for oil prices to
continue drifting higher to the $80-plus level towards the end of 2010. And if war
with Iran becomes inevitable, then oil goes a lot higher.”
The near-month price for benchmark US crude occasionally bobbed above $70/
bbl on the New York Mercantile Exchange in late June due to disruptions of oil exports from Nigeria. Oil was up in early trading June 29 on reports Royal Dutch Shell
PLC closed a major oil ﬁeld in Nigeria after several production wells were attacked,
following earlier claims by the rebel Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger
Delta of wellheads being bombed in Shell’s Afremo oil ﬁeld. Even earlier, Shell conﬁrmed militant attacks damaged a pipeline carrying benchmark Bonny crude to the
key export terminal in Nigeria.
Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland, said attacks on oil facilities in the
delta have likely reduced Nigeria’s current production to 1.3-1.4 million b/d, down
from 1.9 million last July and 1.8 million in the ﬁrst quarter of this year. “The attacks
on the pipeline infrastructure are also having an impact on the running of the local
reﬁneries; Warri and Port Harcourt are said to be shut, and Kanuda [is reported]
running on stocks, which will run out in…weeks and provide some support to the
Atlantic Basin light-end products,” he said.
He questioned if the market has priced enough of a risk premium on Nigeria. He
said, “If you are a reﬁner on the US East Coast running on Nigeria light crude oil,
you do not change your slate overnight to Arabian Heavy, and Saudi Arabia will anyway not move [to increase production] before global stocks have been reduced. One
way or another, Nigerian disruptions should lead to an acceleration in the reduction of light, sweet crude oil stock, and this provides a risk for an acceleration in the
reduction of the futures contango” (OGJ Online, June 26, 2009).
Jakob is “cautious” in his outlook for the Nigerian government’s offer of amnesty
to militants. “There is money involved, hence some militants might go for that; but
the ones that lay down their arms only leave the territory and its associated business
to the ones that don’t, so we will remain skeptical about the whole deal,” he said.
Iranian discord
Raymond James analysts also noted continuing discord in Iran. “There are two
roads ahead for the Iranian nuclear standoff. One road leads to a peaceful solution, a
diplomatic compromise under which Iran fully complies with its obligations, presumably in exchange for some ‘carrots’ from Europe or others. The second road leads
to higher oil prices. At best, this second road includes the imposition of meaningful
economic sanctions, and if that doesn’t work, potentially, military action,” they said.
“If President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stays in ofﬁce, Iran is clearly set to continue
heading down the second road, but even if he is replaced by a more moderate ﬁgure
like Mir Hossein Mousavi, that route remains a real possibility. Assuming we are
already headed down the second road, the question then shifts to timing. We think
the odds of imminent military action are slim as President Barack Obama struggles
to ﬁnd his place as a world leader. That said, we think the odds of an Iranian oil problem begin to rise rapidly through 2010 as Iran presumably approaches the ‘point of
no return’ for nuclear weapons capability.”
As for other disruptions, Raymond James analysts said, “Russia has long been
playing hardball with international oil companies. Venezuela has expropriated
foreign-owned oil properties (and, more recently, oil service equipment).”
In New Orleans, analysts at Pritchard Capital Partners LLC noted China’s push
to build crude reserves through loans to Petroleo Brasilerio SA in Brazil and OAO
Rosneft in Russia, as well as its purchase of Addax Petroleum Corp. “The Chinese
are aggressively increasing the size of their energy footprint in order to meet future
demand growth. China also plans to increase its strategic crude oil reserves by 160%
to 270 million bbl over the next 5 years, and will begin building a second group of
stockpiling bases as early as this year, at a cost of $4.39 billion,” they said.

House members plan bill to expand NGV use
Legislation to greatly expand the use of natural gas as an alternative to conventional transportation fuel will be introduced in the
US House, three members said on Apr. 1.
The measure’s provisions will include an 18-year extension of
three critical tax incentives that focus on natural gas as a transportation fuel, the purchase of natural gas vehicles (NGVs), and
the installation of commercial and residential natural gas refueling
pumps, according to Reps. Dan Boren (D-Okla.), John B. Larson
(D-Conn.), and John Sullivan (R-Okla.).
Currently, the alternative fuel credit expires at the end of 2009,
and the vehicle and refueling pump credits expire at the end of
2010, they noted.
Known as the New Alternative Transportation to Give Americans
Solutions (NAT GAS) Act, the bill also would create a new tax credit
for automakers producing natural gas and bi-fueled vehicles, the
three federal lawmakers said. Currently, all major automakers manufacture NGVs for overseas markets, and this provision is critical to
encourage them to begin offering NGVs in the US, they said.
The bill also would require that at least 50% of new vehicles
placed into service by the federal government be capable of operating on compressed natural gas or LNG by the end of 2014,
they added. The legislation also would provide grants for light and
heavy-duty gas vehicle and engine development.
“We are at a crossroads, and the decisions we make today in
Congress will determine the stability of our future energy industry, our domestic supply, and the daily cost of energy for millions
of consumers and businesses across the nation. With natural gas
vehicles, we have a real opportunity to establish a cleaner, cheaper
fuel alternative that will provide an independent energy future
for America,” said Boren, who has introduced similar bills in the
past.
Energy investor T. Boone Pickens applauded the measure.
“America’s national and economic security depends on moving off
foreign oil as quickly as possible. Natural gas is the cleanest, most
abundant, most economic fuel to replace imported diesel fuel. The
US has enough natural gas to last more than 118 years; we should
turn to it as an immediate replacement for foreign oil in fleets and
heavy-duty vehicles,” he said.

Western climate plan would cost jobs, study says
A new study finds that a carbon cap-and-trade plan in the western US could slow investment, cost the region hundreds of thousands of jobs, and cut personal income for millions of workers.
The analysis, conducted by economists at the Beacon Hill Institute (BHI) of Suffolk University in Boston, also found that the
proposed Western Climate Initiative (WCI) would require Western

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

states to dramatically increase their number of government employees.
The BHI study reconfirms many of the findings of a study released last month by the Western Business Roundtable (WBR).
That study concluded that the WCI plan could seriously damage
the West’s economy if implemented in its present form.
The carbon cap-and-trade scheme is being pushed by a handful of western governors, the Western Governors’ Association, and
some environmental groups, according to WBR.
In its September 2008 report, WCI released its research on capand-trade policy, which is intended by 2020 to reduce the amount
of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to 15% below 2005 emission
levels.
But BHI finds that due to an inadequate cost and benefit review,
the WCI’s results show tens of billions of dollars of savings annually.
Using the WCI projections of increases in fuel costs, the BHI
study authors concluded that the policies will decrease employment, investment, personal income, and disposable income.
None of the seven WCI states—California, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, and Montana—would escape
economic harm should cap-and-trade be imposed, the new study
found. Four Canadian provinces—British Columbia, Manitoba,
Ontario, and Quebec—also signed the Western Regional Climate
Action Initiative Agreement.
The BHI study found that under a scenario of a broad policy
with no offsets, in which 100% of GHG emission permits would
be auctioned off to emitters, the seven western states would lose
as many as 251,674 private sector jobs, while the permit revenue
would allow the states to hire as many as 142,241 state employees.
The plan also would put investment by firms at serious risk by
slowing investment in the region by as much as $1.448 billion,
and the plan would diminish total personal income by $6.35 billion to $18.31 billion/year.
Under a scenario where states auction the minimum of 25% of
the permits issued, the West would suffer even greater losses, according to the study.
“If state governors and provincial premiers seek to truly meet
the goals underscored in the WCI proposals, they should require
a complete and thorough cost-benefit analysis,” BHI said. “This
consortium of state and provincial governments should understand that, whatever the benefits of the proposals, they will place
the state and regional economies at a competitive disadvantage to
other regions through higher prices for energy and transportation, and [will] exert measurable, negative effects on their economies.” ✦

Development

Large Caguan basin ﬁnd shapes up in Colombia
Emerald Energy PLC and Canacol Energy Ltd., Calgary, are delineating what appears to be a large heavy oil discovery in Colombia’s
Caguan basin 200 miles south of Bogota.
Five wells have been drilled, a sixth is drilling, and a seventh is
planned in the southern part of Capella, an accumulation of 9-11°
gravity oil in the Eocene Mirador formation that appears from 2D
seismic to cover 22,000 acres on the Ombu E&P contract area.
Delineation drilling is planned on the northern half of the
structure later in 2009 after environmental permitting.
Emerald Energy said gross proved and probable reserves are 14.8
million bbl from estimated initial oil in place of 245 million to 1.1
billion bbl. The six existing wells are on the southern 7,400 acres
of the structure. The first five wells found oil in both intervals.
Emerald Energy and Canacol hold 90% and 10% interest, respectively, in the 74,130-acre Ombu contract area, and Emerald
Energy holds 100% working interest in the 27,181-acre Durillo
contract area adjacent to and southwest of Ombu. Emerald Energy
said Durillo may have potential in the same exploration play as
Capella.
The vertical Capella-1 went to a total depth of 3,802 ft in
mid-2008 and found 189 ft of potential hydrocarbon-bearing interval in two Mirador sandstones. The two tested at a combined
240 b/d oil progressive cavity pumps.
Emerald Energy plans a cyclic steam injection pilot in one well
this year. The field production rate is constrained by oil trucking
and sales capacity. The individual intervals tested at initial rates of
26-240 b/d of oil and stabilized at as much as 400 b/d on extended tests, with water cut steadily declining to 6%.

Afghanistan launches ﬁrst-ever bidding round
Afghanistan’s Ministry of Mines said it “has initiated the process
that will lead to the bidding round for the award of exploration
and production-sharing contracts for hydrocarbon operations.”
The ministry reported that the two gas blocks and one oil block
to be auctioned lie in the northern part of the country where most
oil and gas fields were discovered in the 1970s.
It said the Jangalikalan and Juma-Bashikurd gas blocks together

Brazil’s state-run Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) and partner
Repsol YFP SA made a declaration of commercial viability to the
country’s Agencia Nacional do Petroleo (ANP) for a light oil and
gas discovery made on Block BM-S-7 in the Santos basin.
Piracuca field lies in 200 m of water off Sao Paulo state, 200
km from Santos. The partners, Petrobras 63% and Repsol YPF 37%,
estimate in-place reserves at 88.5 million cu m or “about 550 million boe.”
The declaration of commercial viability is the outcome of “intense exploratory activity” carried out on this block, the partners
said, adding, “With the new field, it will be possible to increase the
potential for light oil and gas production in shallow waters.”

hold recoverable reserves of 52 billion cu m, while the Kashkari oil
block has recoverable reserves of 64.4 million bbl.
Two years ago, after completing a multiyear study, the US Geological Survey estimated Afghanistan’s mean undiscovered resources at 15.7 tcf of gas, 1.6 billion bbl of oil, and 562 million bbl of
natural gas liquids (OGJ Online, Mar. 27, 2006).
USGS said much of Afghanistan’s petroleum resource potential
and all the known oil and gas reserves are in the north. It said most
of the undiscovered oil is in the Afghan-Tajik basin, while most of
the undiscovered gas is in the Amu Darya basin.
A road show for the Afghan licensing round will be launched
in Kabul on Apr. 26 before it travels on to Dubai, London, Calgary,
Houston, and Singapore (OGJ Online, Mar. 19, 2009).
London-based consultant Exclusive Analysis recently predicted:
“In the coming year, core al-Qaeda is...likely to focus on the military jihad in Afghanistan as the primary means of draining the US
economy (OGJ Online, Apr. 3, 2009).”

Flemish Pass off Newfoundland gets discovery
StatoilHydro Canada Ltd. will apply for a Significant Discovery
License for an indicated deepwater discovery in the frontier Flemish Pass basin in the Atlantic Ocean off eastern Canada.
The company didn’t disclose the hydrocarbon type and said it
will file for the SDL even though further analysis is needed to determine the well’s potential.
The discovery came at Mizzen O-16 in 1,100 m of water on EL
1049 some 500 km east-northeast of St. John’s and 180 km east of
Whiterose oil and gas field in the Jeanne d’Arc basin.
The wellsite is 6 miles north of a well that PetroCanada drilled
on the Mizzen prospect that found noncommercial oil. The Mizzen
L-11 and Tuckamore B-27 wells were drilled in the Flemish Pass
basin in the winter-spring of 2003 (OGJ, Aug. 15, 2005, p. 34).
StatoilHydro Canada praised the crew of the Henry Goodrich
semisubmersible, which spud the well Dec. 21, 2008, and support
contractors for carrying out the drilling in the heart of the North
Atlantic winter storm season (OGJ, Oct. 27, 2008, p. 56).
Interests in the license are StatoilHydro 65% and Husky Energy
Inc. 35%. ✦

The announcement coincided with reports that Petrobras notified ANP on Apr. 6 that it found traces of oil in a test well drilled on
the C-M-401 Block offshore in the Campos basin. Petrobras holds
a 100% stake in the block.
Petrobras reported that data from early March showed that the
Peregrine 1 rig was drilling at the site in 977 m of water and targeting a depth of 3,333 m.
Meanwhile, ANP said ExxonMobil Brazilian subsidiary Esso Santos is drilling a second well on Brazil’s Santos basin Block BM-S-22
to a depth of 5,404 m in 24 m of water.
ExxonMobil Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson said the second well is designed in part to give ExxonMobil
a “better understanding” of BM-S-22, but he declined to discuss

what the firm expects to discover.
While the block is close to major finds in Santos’ presalt layer,
Tillerson played down projections of discoveries at BM-S-22, saying, “We have one well” and “it’s just too early” to predict what
will be found on it.
ExxonMobil is operator of the block with a 40% stake. Hess
Corp. also holds a 40% interest while Petrobras owns the remaining 20%.

CGES: Iraqi output target needs $28-43 billion
The Center for Global Energy Studies, London, in an Apr. 2 publication estimates that Iraq will need to invest $28-43 billion for
raising its oil production capacity to 6 million b/d, a goal set during the regime of former President Saddam Hussein.
Besides the investment in fields, the estimate includes repair and
refurbishment of pipelines, storage, and loading facilities to return
capacity to 3.5-4 million b/d .
For the fields, CGES estimates that Iraq requires $9.6-13.6 billion for restoring production to the 3.8 million b/d produced before the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. Current production capacity is 2.7
million b/d.
To raise production to 6 million b/d would require an additional $18.6-26.9 billion, CGES says.

Burullus Gas extends rig contract
Burullus Gas Co. has extended its chartering of third-generation
semisubmersible rig Scarabeo 6 from Saipem SPA under a $400
million contract.
The new contract will last until fourth-quarter 2014. The rig
will remain in Egyptian waters.
Scarabeo 6’s operating capacity is to be upgraded to 1,100 m
from 780 m of water in 6 months in late 2011 or early 2012.

Processing
Axens lets contract for Kremenchug reﬁnery
Ukrainian holding company Ukrtatnafta has awarded Axens SA
of Paris a contract for upgrading the gasoline pool at the 360,000
b/d Kremenchug refinery. The Kremenchung facility has the largest throughput capacity in the Ukraine.
The upgrading project, the first of its kind in the Ukraine, will
enable the production of Euro V gasoline grade in the 2011 timeframe. The project involves the addition of Prime-G+, naphtha hydrotreating, and DIH isomerization units.
The combined naphtha fractions from the two existing fluidized catalytic crackers will be fed to a 610,000 tonne/year PrimeG+ unit, where the product sulfur content will be lowered to 20
ppm. The C5-C6 straight-run and catalytic reforming fractions will
be processed in a 380,000 tonne/year hydrotreater then isomerized in a deisohexanizer-type isomerization unit to produce an 88
RON (research octane number), light gasoline cut.
Ukrneftekhimproekt, Kiev, will perform the detailed engineering.

No new ﬂoater orders placed last quarter
The market for floating production systems has frozen as a result of the abrupt downturn in the global economy with no orders
for production floaters placed in the last quarter, according to International Maritime Associates Inc., Washington, DC.
IMA says this is the first time since 1996 when it began tracking
floating production units (FPUs) that no companies have placed
orders during a reporting quarter. As a result, order backlog for
production floaters has dropped 30% from the same time last year,
it says.
Its latest report notes that companies have delayed several orders
for production floaters including three floating production, storage, and offloading vessels and a MinDoc, which is a deep-draft
floating production unit for supporting dry-tree completions in
deep water.
IMA said one FPSO operator has filed for bankruptcy and a second has sold its interest in an FPSO under construction. At least one
other FPSO operator looks in tenuous condition, IMA added.
On the other hand, its long-term outlook for FPUs remains
strong because of the number of development projects at various
stages of planning that will need floating production or storage
systems.
In its latest report, IMA identifies more than 155 projects that
will require floating production systems. About one third of these
are at an advanced stage of bidding or final design, IMA said.
Because of these projects and an anticipated recovery in the oil
price, it forecasts that companies will order 93-141 production
floaters in the next 5 years. ✦

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
tomo Chemical Co. to develop Phase 2 of its refinery and chemicals
complex in the port city of Rabigh on the Red Sea.
Aramco Pres. and Chief Executive Khalid A. Al-Falih said his firm
would “soon” sign a memorandum of understanding with Sumitomo to further develop the $10 billion Petro Rabigh complex.
Al-Falih’s statement confirmed an earlier press report saying
Sumitomo Chemical planned to build another large petrochemical
complex in Saudi Arabia adjacent to one scheduled to come on line
at the end of this month.
That first phase of the project involved upgrading the 400,000
b/d Rabigh refinery to produce higher-quality products, including
petrochemical units to produce 900,000 tonnes/year of polyethylene, 700,000 tpy of polypropylene, 600,000 tpy of monoethylene
glycol, and 200,000 tpy of propylene oxide.
To implement the project’s first phase, Aramco and Sumitomo
Chemical formed the joint venture Rabigh Refining & Petrochemical (Petro Rabigh).
The Saudi government recently approved investment plans for
the second project, and the Nikkei Business Daily (NBD) on Mar.
12 reported that Petro Rabigh would soon conduct a feasibility
study to identify investment amounts, output, and other details.

Construction could start as early as yearend, with the complex
targeted to come online sometime in 2013-14.
Although yet to be determined, total investments are forecast
at ¥300-500 billion. Both Sumitomo Chemical and Aramco will
inject additional funds into the joint venture, and they plan to request financing from a banking consortium.
“The facility will be positioned as a second-phase project, but
will be a huge…complex with cracking furnaces for naphtha and
ethane gas,” NBD said.
Despite the ongoing slump in the world economy, Sumitomo
Chemical sees demand for petrochemical products rising over the
long term in emerging markets and plans to market value-added
products from the second complex to China and India as well as to
Europe, NBD said.
The complex will mass-produce 20-30 high-function products
such as autoparts-grade plastics and materials for LCD televisions.
A total investment of ¥500 billion was planned when Petro Rabigh was formed in 2004, but ballooning prices for resources and
other factors swelled outlays for the first complex to ¥1 trillion.
“This time around,” NBD said, “the downward trend in materials prices and construction costs due to the weak economy spurred

the decision to make an additional investment.”
Prior to this week’s announcement, Sumitomo Chemical chose
to have its petrochemicals business in Tokyo manage the Rabigh
project, considered one of the world’s largest integrated complexes
for petroleum refining and petrochemical manufacture.
Petro Rabigh will independently operate the complex, while
Sumitomo Chemical will be responsible for the sale of produced
petrochemical derivatives.

Placid Reﬁning completes hydrotreater
Placid Refining Co. LLC completed its 20,000 b/d fluidized catalytic cracker gasoline hydrotreater at its refinery in Port Allen, La.
The new unit, along with other improvements, will enable the
refinery to meet all applicable clean fuel standards for its products.
The $63 million project, the largest single capital project in
Placid’s history, is part of the refinery’s $300 million upgrade and
expansion to increase capacity to 80,000 b/d from 55,000 b/d
while reducing total air emissions by 50%.
Mustang, a subsidiary of international energy services company
John Wood Group PLC, provided the engineering, design, procurement, and construction management for the project. ✦

Qatargas charters LNG ships
Qatargas Operating Co. Ltd. chartered the Q-Flex and Q-Max
LNG carriers delivered to Nakilat, the Qatari-listed shipping company from shipyards in South Korea. Both ships will transport LNG
produced by Qatargas 3 to the US.
The Al Sadd carrier Q-Flex carrier is one of the world’s largest
with a capacity of 210,000 cu m and is under a long-term contract. It was delivered from the Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine
Engineering Co. Ltd., Okpo shipyard on Geoje Island. The Mekaines
Q-Max LNG Carrier has a capacity of 266,000 cu m, and it too is
under a long-term charter. It was delivered to Nakilat at Samsung
Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. shipyard on Geoje Island.
Nakilat said the Q-Flex carrier has 50% more capacity than conventional LNG carriers with about 40% lower energy requirements
because it has maximized economies of scale and efficient engines.
Q-Max has 80% more capacity. Both are unique and purposebuilt for Nakilat to send efficiently Qatar’s natural gas to markets
throughout the world, the company added. Qatargas 3 shareholders are Qatar Petroleum, ConocoPhillips, and Mitsui & Co. Ltd.

Qatargas inaugurates delayed, two-train project
Qatargas has inaugurated its much-delayed 15.6 tonne/year
Qatargas 2 in a ceremony in Ras Laffan City, the industrial complex
north of Doha that has grown up around the country’s LNG export
industry.
The inauguration follows delivery last month of the project’s
first cargo, carried by the 210,000-cu m Q-Flex vessel Tembek, to
the new South Hook terminal at Milford Haven, UK.
Qatargas 2 originally was to have produced its first cargo in late
2007, but mechanical problems and labor difficulties slowed its
progress, according to press reports.
The project, according to Qatargas, is the world’s “first fully
10

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

integrated value chain LNG venture.” It consists of three offshore
unmanned platforms, two of the world’s largest LNG trains, each
capable of producing 7.8 million tonnes/year, 850,000 tpy of LPG,
140,000 b/d of condensate, five 145,000 cu m storage tanks, and
a fleet of 14 Q-Flex and Q-Max ships. Vessels in the latter category
can carry upwards of 266,000 cu m of LNG.
Qatargas 2 consists of Trains 4 and 5; each employs Air Product’s proprietary APX process technology. It was LNG produced
from Train 4 that arrived at the South Hook for use in commissioning the terminal. Ownership in Train 4 is split between Qatar
Petroleum 70% and ExxonMobil Corp. 30%. Train 5 is owned by
Qatar Petroleum 65%, ExxonMobil 18.3%, and Total SA 16.7%.
Total was a late comer to the project, buying into the project
in late 2006. Total also holds 8.35% in the South Hook. QP holds
67.5% and ExxonMobil 24.15%.
Located in West Pembrokeshire in Wales, the terminal is the
largest LNG receiving terminal in Europe, according to Qatargas,
with capacity of 15.6 million tpy and employing the largest diameter storage tanks in the world. South Hook’s sendout will be able
to meet up to 20% of current UK natural gas demand, according
to project sponsors.

NWS group marks LNG production milestone
The Woodside Petroleum Ltd.-operated North West Shelf joint
venture’s LNG plant on the Burrup Peninsula near Karratha in
Western Australia marks its 20th anniversary this month of LNG
production coming on stream. The first shipment of LNG left for
Japan in late July 1989.
North West Shelf Australia LNG Pres. Peter Cleary said the original 20-year contracts signed in 1985 with the Japanese had underpinned the development of the LNG production and export facilities. ✦

Missed an argument
The editorial “Oppose cap-and-trade”
missed a vital part of the argument to
stop cap-and-trade (OGJ, Mar. 9, 2009,
p. 16).
A tax is a simple matter to stop. Putting a cap-and-trade system into place
is creating another bureaucracy. As all
should know, a bureaucracy never gets
undone. It only grows.
Neither system would do anything
for climate change. Either of them
would be an expensive waste.

Platform ﬂyways
The industry cannot thank you too
much for publishing “Oil and aviation
safety” (OGJ, Mar. 16, 2009, p. 20).
Hopefully, responsible parties will buy
reprints and circulate them to vital news
media worldwide. This would update
and support such previous documentaries as the API’s “Steel Reefs” film
that showed huge fish swarms around
marine offshore petroleum drilling and
production platforms.
Particular interest should exist, too,
in long-distance bird migration across
the Gulf of Mexico. Surely there are
instances of exhausted birds resting
on such platforms, drinking rainwater
collected thereon, and doing their own
replenishment fishing before proceeding
to their destinations. Perhaps intelligent
estimates are published of the number of
birds with prolonged lives because these
platforms exist.
Since air traffic is now monitored
on these installations, they might also
monitor migratory bird traffic if so
instrumented. Such data should be of
interest to a big variety of entities—e.g.,
the Audubon and National Geographic
societies—and might be further documented from various other discrete
sources.

The voles of Hoo Pen
Warren R.True
Chief Technology
Editor-LNG/Gas
Processing
As industrial facilities go, LNG terminals are generally among the cleanest
and quietest to be found. But every terminal has to start somewhere. And that
starting place comes with a history.
It may be the pristine coastal forests
of Oregon or Maine. Or, as in the case
of the UK’s Isle of Grain LNG terminal,
it may be a site where earlier industrial
activity—and nature—have left footprints.
Beneath the gleaming, visually impressive terminal on the Thames estuary
in north Kent lie some legacy effects
of the previous tenant, the BP Kent oil
refinery. And before even that, some
furrier tenants called the site home.
Building the terminal there had to
contend with both realities.

What’s there
The site of the current terminal
began modern (i.e., post-World War
II) industrial life as BP’s Kent refinery,
built in the early 1950s and closed as a
refinery in 1983.
Also, the site was home to one of the
UK’s five LNG peak-shaving plants operated since 1981 by Transco Ltd., part
of what then was British Gas, which
purchased the refinery land to build an
LNG terminal. But increased North Sea
gas production torpedoed those earlier
terminal plans.
Transco became part of Lattice Group
PLC, which in 2002 merged with National Grid Group PLC to form National
16

Grid Transco, parent of Grain LNG. But
in late 2000, plans were already forming to build the Grain LNG terminal to
address declining natural gas supplies
to the UK. That project started up in late
2005.
Grain LNG declined to specify
to OGJ what its own environmental
surveys found other than to call them
“legacy contamination issues” and
frequently to note its efforts to “protect
ecology” during site development. The
company did admit that site access “to
protect ecology…was often limited by
the presence of asbestos.”
Anyone familiar with refinery sites
even in environmentally conscious Britain can imagine what else lay on and
beneath the surface.
But Grain also cited its efforts in
another environmental issue that came
with the site.
The Isle of Grain (from Old English greon meaning “gravel”) is not an
island at all but the north end of the
Hoo (OE for “spur of land”) Peninsula.
A line of sand and clay hills dominates
its landscape surrounded by extensive
marshland consisting of alluvial silt.
In addition to the anticipated contamination problems Grain LNG faced,
it turns out that Hoo Peninsula is,
according to the company, one of the
“few remaining strongholds in Britain”
for water voles.
A water vole, according to the BBC
website, is a small mammal that grows
to a body length of 5-8 in. and has dark
fur, a round body, a short, fat face, and a
long, fur-covered tail. Anyone fortunate
enough to grow up in the UK since
1908 probably knows something about
water voles: A main character in Kenneth Grahame’s famous children’s book
Wind in the Willows is a water vole
named Ratty.

Protecting ‘Ratty’
But water voles are not rats. More
to the point, these mammals’ numbers
in the UK have been in near freefall
for decades. Intrusions of agricultural,
industrial, and residential development
into their marshy habitats have combined with predation by the American
mink (Of course, the culprit has to be
American.) to shrink the water vole
population to a few 100,000 recently,
from an estimated 2 million in 1990,
according to several websites that track
Ratty’s descendants.
The Grain LNG terminal cannot be
blamed for being the first industrial
intruder on the water vole’s habitat,
but it has nonetheless taken on responsibility not to aggravate the decline.
The company says it has embarked on
a coordinated “mink strategy” that
involves landowners and statutory authorities working together. “The aim is
to maintain the current distribution and
numbers of water vole on the Isle of
Grain by controlling mink” before they
reach the site.
This requires close communication
with landowners and other organizations, interested in conserving the
creature, about any occurrences of
mink within Hoo Peninsula. Efforts also
include monthly checks of rafts on site
for evidence of mink and prompt trapping if such is reported.
Other environmental sensibilities
probably prevent Grain from turning
this trapping effort into another profitable sideline. A modern dilemma if
there ever was one.
But LNG is a modern commodity—
and a clean one. And natural gas can
warm almost as well as a mink coat. ✦

Recruiting problems ahead
The oil and gas industry fretted about recruitment of engineers and scientists while it was
scrambling to hire them in the boom years that
now are history. Now it’s fretting about the future
supply of engineers and scientists as it lays them
off by the thousands.
At the RMI Oilfield Breakfast Forum in Houston Apr. 8, RMI Pres. Steve Jacobs asked speakers to
identify their greatest immediate worry. Three of
the four—chief or high-ranking executives of an
oil company, a service firm, and a drilling contractor—responded with, as one of them worded
the answer, “keeping talented people.” The fourth
speaker, an investment analyst, said his main concern was the economy. When business conditions
were opposite those of the present, speakers at
industry functions routinely said the same thing.

Talent pool
This is no surprise. In good times and bad, the
oil and gas industry depends on its talent pool.
That it can’t keep the pool full when commodity prices crash is a painful business imperative.
Managers making layoff decisions don’t need to
be reminded how much the industry’s oscillating
employment record hurts.
But a reputation for cyclicality isn’t the only
obstacle companies will face when they resume
hiring, especially for entry-level positions, when
the business recovers. The industry’s chronic unpopularity is another. And related to that problem
is the supposition that oil and gas are yesterday’s
fuels. Why would anyone contemplating a career
or job change stake his or her future on substances
thought to be in their dying years?
In the premise of that question, people knowledgeable about oil and gas markets see fatal flaws.
But most people in the US, especially young people who haven’t studied the subject, do not. They
read that the world is running out of oil. They
hear government officials talk about switching to
renewable fuels to cure a national “addiction” to
petroleum. The younger ones have been told since
grade school that the use of fossil energy warms
the planet dangerously, so any alternative must be
superior.
18

The problem has intensified with a recent onslaught of legislative, regulatory, and budget proposals that seem designed to drive oil and gas out
of the energy mix and the industry that supplies
fluid hydrocarbons out of the country. Denials by
the Obama administration that this is the intention
don’t align with what’s happening. The plan seems
to be to shrink access by producers to hydrocarbon resources on federal land and to sap cash from
oil and gas companies to fund initiatives in other
areas, including heavy subsidization of noncommercial energy.
As has been argued here frequently, the industry has good reason to resist policy errors like
these as the threats to national prosperity that they
are. But it has a further reason, related to staffing,
to fight the notion underlying these moves that
the US can afford to treat oil and gas as fuels approaching extinction: No one wants to feel like a
dinosaur at work.
Expectations about the death of oil and gas,
deliberate or otherwise, are unreasonable. In its
Annual Energy Outlook published last month, the
Energy Information Administration projects big
changes in the US oil market, most related to conservation and renewable fuel. One major change is
the cessation of growth in consumption of oil as
use of liquid fuels increases by only 1 million b/d
between 2007 and 2030 and as ethanol and other
biofuels make up the difference.

Course correction
That’s a noteworthy course correction. It’s also
inevitable: Oil consumption can’t climb forever. In
EIA’s reference-case forecast, however, the industry
still supplies 14.32 million b/d of crude oil to
the US in 2030, including 7.37 million b/d from
domestic fields.
These numbers do not indicate an industry likely to disappear any time soon. And future policies
can’t change them much except at untenable cost.
Finding, producing, transporting, and processing
the oil and gas that the US will continue to need,
no matter what its government does, will require
much work for many years. That work, lest anyone
forget, must be done by people. ✦

T E R E S T
Oil and gas producing countries
in Latin America have adopted diverse
approaches to energy policy and the
extent to which international companies are allowed to invest or operate in
conjunction with the various national
oil companies.
Rice University’s James Baker
Institute hosted a Feb. 26 conference
in which speakers discussed Latin
America’s changing energy
landscape, which continues
to be heavily influenced by
economics, geopolitics, and
sometimes very localized
politics.
Privatization and deregulation were common in the
early 1990s as Latin America governments tended to allow increased participation by international oil and gas
companies.
Bolivia and Argentina sold their
state-owned oil companies while Brazil
broke its monopoly. Venezuela shifted
toward privatization and deregulation
before reverting to resource nationalism—meaning the government sets
exploration and production terms.
Mexico is the only country that remains closed to outside oil companies,
although it established service contracts
in recent years. Recent legal reforms
might set the stage to eventually enable
international operators to explore and
produce in Mexico.
This article provides a brief country-by-county review and examines
possible scenarios for energy policy in
Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, and Argentina.

Latin American oil, gas

Mexico production dips
Mexico needs to offset declining
production in Cantarell field and elsewhere.
Recent energy reform legislation
reportedly broadens the flexibility with
which state-run Petroleos Mexicanos
can arrange contracts.
Contractors and international oil
companies are waiting to see what
future relationships with Pemex might
emerge. Pemex was created after
20

President Lazaro Cardenas nationalized
the oil industry in 1938. It remains a
monopoly today.
Increases from Chicontepec oil and
gas field and Mexico’s eventual first
forays in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico
are expected to help build production. Pemex officials cite Chicontepec
as a stop-gap measure pending future
deepwater production. The field is in
Veracruz and Puebla states.
Total Mexican oil production fell
to an average 2.8 million b/d in
2008—the lowest level in 13 years. Pemex expects that 2009 production will
average 2.85 million b/d and will return to 3 million b/d in 2015. Mexico’s
production peaked at 3.4 million b/d
in 2004.
Pemex expects to see deepwater
production around 2015. It anticipates
92,000 b/d from deep water in 2017,
Pemex Chief Executive Jesus Reyes Heroles told reporters in Houston during
the Cambridge Energy Research Associates conference.
Reyes Heroles said Pemex plans to
drill 27 wells in more than 1,640 ft of
water in 2008-12 compared with having drilled six deepwater wells during
2004-07.
In February, Pemex announced a
170-well tender for Chicontepec. The
tender’s winning bid is expected to be
announced in April with work scheduled to start in May.
Chicontepec is a complicated basin
where production has been slower than
expected, Reyes Heroles and Veracruz
Gov. Fidel Herrera Beltran both told
reporters in separate visits to Houston.
Beltran spoke at Rice University’s Latin
American energy conference.
Chicontepec pay is an Eocene turbidite with three zones. Wells in the
widespread sand are less prolific than
wells elsewhere in Mexico, although
researchers hope that technology can
improve production rates.
Pemex said this month that Chicontepec averaged 707 operating wells in
2008 and 35 drilling rigs as of January
2009. The field’s fourth-quarter 2008
production was 30,000 b/d.

companies had to convert contracts into
PDVSA joint ventures in which PDVSA
takes more than 50% interest and acquires all production.
Ramon Espinasa, a consultant for
the Inter-American Development Bank,
told the Baker Institute’s Latin America
conference that Venezuela’s production
has fallen steadily since 2005.
“That is a consequence of the massive loss of knowledge stemming from
the strike,” Espinasa said, noting that he
spoke only on behalf of himself rather
than as a bank representative.

“PDVSA as it was cannot be recreated,” Espinasa said. He suggested PDVSA
needs a different regulatory model,
perhaps one patterned after Norway’s.

Argentina’s energy reforms
Energy policy reforms were part of
a broader overall reform that Argentina
launched in 1990 when most state

until reaching a total of 15,000-17,000
wells.
For comparison, Pemex drilled an
average 675 wells/year during the last 5
years across all its basins.
Becnel compares the geology of
Chicontepec with the Denver basin
in the US. He noted that the 17,000
wells Pemex plans to drill in Chicontepec represent the largest integrated
project worldwide today of which he
is aware.
Weatherford and other contractors
are helping accelerate the pace of
drilling and production. Weatherford
moved 20 rigs into Mexico within 6
months and had to build a new, 50,000
sq ft base to service the project. Roads
and drilling sites must be built in many
circumstances to get the rigs into
place.
“By the end of this year, Weatherford
should have more than 30 rigs running
in the ﬁeld,” Becnel said. Each Weatherford rig is expected to drill on average
2.5 wells/month for a total peak run
rate of about 70 wells/month.
A typical pad has 10-18 wells. A few
wells will be vertical or horizontal, but
most will be directional in an S pattern
with vertical upper and lower sections
to achieve 4- to 8-acre spacing in the
reservoir. Bottomhole locations are

In an interview with Caracas’s El

former minister of oil for Venezuela—
said the country’s projected revenues
have been adjusted to 156.38 billion

Rodriguez said the main variable in

its much-maligned exchange controls,
has a sort of wall that the strong waves

“So far the measures that OPEC has

of a recovery, and it is still too soon to

As for the oil price necessary for the
government to meet expenses, Rodriguez said, “We have already implemented a cut to $40/bbl, and we need
to maintain a minimum of $40 for the
Venezuelan basket. For the moment we
would like to reach an average of $60
for the year, but it all depends on how
things go.”
The price of Venezuela’s gasoline,
which is scheduled to rise, was a sore

point with the minister. “Over here we
are paying for people to consume gasoline, which is a brutal waste,” he said.
“Those prices do not cover the cost of
extraction, transportation, refining, and
the distribution of the gasoline in gas
stations.”
Continuing about gasoline, Rodriguez said that Venezuela’s “domestic
market is already 650,000 bbl, which is
brutal, and it goes without saying that
an adjustment will have to be made,

Putin: OAO Transneft
to complete ESPO’s ﬁrst
phase ‘within weeks’
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Russia’s Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Apr. 7 said state-owned pipeline
operator OAO Transneft will complete
construction of the first phase of the
East Siberia-Pacific Ocean (ESPO) oil
pipeline “within weeks.”
“In just a few weeks, the phase during which the pipeline will reach the
Chinese border will be over and we will
go further to the Pacific Ocean,” Putin
told Russia’s parliament.
The news will be welcomed in China, which recently completed negotiations with Russia for a 67-km pipeline
spur to run from the line’s Phase 1
endpoint at Skovorodino to the Chinese
border (OGJ Online, Mar. 9, 2009).
From the border, the Chinese also plan
to construct a 960-km pipeline link to
Daqing.
Putin’s remarks echoed statements
last week that construction of an oil
railway terminal in Skovorodino will be
completed by this August.
Officials said the first test trains will
begin running in October to Primorye
from the Skovorodino station, which
initially is designed to pump 15 million
tonnes/year of oil, eventually increasing
to 30 million tonnes.
The officials said that 11 sets of
railway tracks will be laid at the station
for pumping oil into tank cars, maneuvering in dispatching loaded trains, and
other technical purposes.
Under construction also are an automated oil delivery and receiving point
along with related transport facilities. As
many as 10 trains/day will depart from
Skovorodino to deliver oil to the export
terminal at Kozmino on Russia’s Pacific
Coast. Meanwhile, OAO Rosneft last
week said it will finish building a pipeline from its giant, newly developed

Showdown
in Uganda?

I

s a showdown looming in Uganda? The oil and gas industry has
heard much recently of developments
in the country, not least the desire on
the part of Ugandan officials to develop a refinery instead of an export
pipeline.
Well, it seems things are coming
to a head as the country considers
ways of taking more control over its
budding oil and gas industry with
the establishment of an oil and gas
policy, to say nothing of a national oil
company.
According to consultant IHS
Global Insight, Uganda’s Energy and
Mineral Development permanent
secretary Fred Kabagambe-Kaliisa last
week announced the government’s
intentions with an overhaul of the
oil and gas policy to be implemented
before the end of the year. The pending Resource Management Law and
Revenue Management Law would see
the establishment of a new institutional framework separating policy
from regulation and commercial activities. It would also see the creation
of a state-owned Uganda Oil Co.

Apparently the Ugandans are
emboldened by the results of a 2007
study conducted by the East African
Community that identified regional
demand of about 150,000 b/d of
petroleum products, a figure that is
growing at 5%/year. While IHS Global Insight sees some merit in the idea
of a Ugandan refinery, it nonetheless
points out that any commercial-scale
refinery would cost billions of dollars
and would take many years to pay
back the investment.

Key concern

As a result, it says, “this strategy
would not benefit Uganda in the
short term as the country’s key concern is to monetize its assets in order
for the country to make progress as
quickly as possible.”
Another vital issue is the actual
size of Uganda’s crude reserves, an
answer that will not be known until
considerable further exploration has
taken place over the next few years.
Enter the international oil company.
“We can’t just go with a ‘big bang’
solution,” said Ian Cloke, exploration

Sergei Bogdanchikov. “We’ve literally 6

will be a key event because it means
the project is going well,” he said.
Vankor field, which will be the
main source of oil for the ESPO line,
has estimated reserves of 200.4 million
tonnes and probable reserves of 233.7
million tonnes.
“This is the biggest field in Russian

T E R E S T
history, and its launch will be a massive
event,” said Bogdanchikov, who noted
that production from the field will begin in the third quarter.
He also said Rosneft and Transneft
will sign an oil-trading contract by Apr.
10, under which Rosneft plans to sell
the crude to Transneft, which will then
repay China’s loan.
In February, Russia and China initialed an agreement on building the
ESPO pipeline spur, with China granting
loans of $10 billion and $15 billion to
Transneft and Rosneft respectively for

15 million tonnes/year of oil for 20
years (OGJ Online, Feb. 17, 2009).
Half of the planned 30 million
tonnes of oil shipped to Skovorodino
will be diverted to China along the
67-km pipeline spur and the other half
will be moved by rail on to Kozmino
until Phase 2 of the line is completed.
ESPO’s first phase—2,700 km from
Taishet to Skovorodino—is scheduled to start operating late this year,
while ESPO’s second phase, extending
another 2,000 km from Skovorodino
to Kozmino, is due to be completed by
2015. ✦

American is thankful that energy prices

still wonder: What happened?” Cantwell
said.

Two views
of line proposal

Close correlation
She said another of the witnesses
at the hearing, Robert F. McCullough
Jr., managing partner at McCullough
Research in Portland, Ore., detected a
close correlation between financial and
physical oil markets last year, in contrast
to the US Energy Information Administration, which based its conclusions on
factors influencing supply and demand.
“Thanks to his work, and several
hearings this committee has held in
previous years, we have learned that we
don’t have the necessary data collection or focus to understand what really
drives oil market prices. All we really
know now is that supply-and-demand
is only part of the equation,” she said.
Cantwell said the second legislation the hearing would examine would
establish an office within EIA to collect
and analyze information from physical and paper oil markets. This would
improve EIA’s ability to predict future
energy prices and help regulators police
markets more effectively, she said.
In his written testimony, McCullough
said no federal agency has been directed
to investigate and explain last year’s
extraordinary crude oil price changes
despite oil’s arguably being the US
economy’s most important commodity.
“The inability of the federal government to fully investigate oil price behavior in 2008 is fundamentally a data
problem. Perhaps it is not a coincidence
that oil is the most opaque of our nation’s energy supplies. The transparency
legislation that you are discussing today
is a step in the right direction because
it will expand EIA’s ability to track oil
inventories within the US by owner,”
he said.

proposal by US Sen. Maria
Cantwell (D-Wash.) to amend
a section of the Natural Gas Act so
interstate gas pipelines would be subject to the same refund procedures as
electricity suppliers has drawn differing reactions.
“Simply put, the current system is
broken. It favors pipelines over consumers by allowing pipelines to keep
overcharges rather than giving consumers their money back when their
rates are shown to be excessive,” said
the American Public Gas Association
and 19 other groups in an Apr. 6 letter
to Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman.
The issue is much more complex,
the Interstate Natural Gas Association
of America said on Apr. 2. It goes to
the core of the relationship between
gas pipelines and federal regulators,
the ability to raise private capital to
expand systems, and the importance
of such investments to US energy,
environmental, and economic goals,
said INGAA Pres. Donald F. Santa Jr.
“The natural gas model of regulation embodied in the NGA is not
broken.... The current regulatory
system for natural gas pipelines
works well,” he said in his own letter
to Bingaman.

“It makes no sense to allow
pipelines to continue to keep billions of dollars of consumers’ money,
especially in the current economic
climate. Instead of going to the
pipelines’ shareholders, these dollars
should be rightfully returned to consumers,” they argued.
Santa pointed out that the refund
authority, which was added to the
FPA in 1988 and amended in 2005,
was a direct response to complaints
about wholesale electricity prices,
which can increase dramatically and
fluctuate due to market volatility.

‘Largest portion’

Interstate gas pipeline rates reflect
only the cost of transporting the gas,
he said. “The largest portion of the
consumer bill is the unregulated cost
of the gas itself, which would be
unaffected by the results of a complaint against an interstate pipeline,”
he said.
While overall gas pipeline transportation costs are low, delivery
system bottlenecks can significantly
affect prices and volatility, Santa continued. Interstate gas pipelines are,
by their very nature, capital-intensive
projects where investors depend on
rate certainty to recover their financial commitments, he said.

demand. He also warned that adopting procedures outlined in the market
transparency bill could prove to be both
difficult and expensive.
He said that earlier in March EIA
held a workshop on the relationship
between futures and financial market
activity and the underlying physical
market for crude oil with staff members
from the CFTC, Federal Reserve Board,
Government Accountability Office, and
International Monetary Fund. Presentations and discussions highlighted
several points, including the need for
better and more accessible data on
trader activity, the need to examine
alternative theories of trader behavior,

T E R E S T
and the need to continue examining the
role of fundamentals with better and
more accurate data.
“Looking ahead based on our current understanding, EIA staff believe
that effective analysis of the effects of
trading on resulting prices will require
not only better data, but a much stronger theoretical approach as well. Analysts within and outside EIA continue
to grapple with understanding the gap
between very short-term and longerterm price formation. A comprehensive
theory of how trader behavior affects
longer-term prices is simply not well
developed. Without a well-developed
theory, analysts are reduced to data

mining and testing unformed hypotheses,” Gruenspecht said.
Limited availability of aggregate
data which can be used to track trader
strategy and behavior compounds the
challenge, he continued. “In the most
obvious example, the position information that the CFTC publishes is separated into categories of commercial
and noncommercial traders, categories
that do not map cleanly to hedgers and
speculators. Without a way of identifying trades and positions taken for
speculative purposes, direct analysis
of the effects of speculation on price
formation is not really possible,” he
said. ✦

technology constraints are potentially
significant,” the report said.
Alaska also has ocean areas with
outstanding renewable energy resource
potential, but they are not expected to
be developed in the near term because
of harsh weather and their distance
from high-energy demand centers, the
report added.
It also identified several safety and
environmental factors that could restrict
OCS energy development. Oil spills
were cited as a major concern but spillprevention efforts are believed effective.
Understanding sea floor habitats will
be important in leasing decisions for renewable and traditional energy resource
development, the report said. Some
information already has been gathered,
but there are significant data gaps for a
number of areas, it indicated.
“In some cases, exploration seismic
surveys for oil and gas production,
followed by required site-specific,
high-resolution hazard surveys, could
provide detailed information about the
seabed with regard to drilling hazards
as well as for evaluating benthic habitats.”

habitat alterations, and seismic surveys.
“Key challenges for renewable
energy development common to all
OCS areas include offshore space-use
conflicts, artificial reef effects, habitat
alteration, noise from pile driving, and
effects from electromagnetic fields,” the
report said.
In addition to seismic surveys that
will be necessary to close gaps in OCS
oil and gas resource evaluation, the
report said offshore renewable energy
technologies are still developing, so
standardized protocols and technical
design criteria are needed.

“The experience, knowledge, and
tools exist to ensure that offshore
energy development is developed in a
comprehensive and environmentally
sound manner. By obtaining stakeholder
input (locally and nationally), compiling existing information, and acquiring
new data where needed, conducting
objective analyses using monitoring
data to manage adaptively, and applying
the necessary mitigations and safeguards along the way, we can achieve
our national energy, economic, and environmental goals,” the report said. ✦

Marathon-Petro-Canada and ConocoPhillips GTL proposal, have been put on
hold pending the study’s results.
North field, off Qatar in the Persian
Gulf, holds an estimated 900 tcf of gas,
making it the world’s largest gas deposit. The Qatari authorities are determined
to implement a production strategy that
will deliver gas for its people now without compromising future generations.
High costs have been a major barrier
for project development, forcing ExxonMobil in 2007 to cancel its Palm GTL
plant, which had a proposed capacity of
154,000 b/d.
Qatar is on track to develop an LNG
capacity of 77 million tonnes/year
within the next 2 years.

South Hook project
Despite weak gas demand amid
the global recession, Al-Attiyah said
Qatargas, now the world’s largest LNG
exporter, would proceed with projects
underpinned by long-term commitments. Its first commissioning cargo
from Qatargas 2 arrived Mar. 20 at the
South Hook regasification terminal in
Wales (OGJ Online, Mar. 23, 2009).
South Hook will deliver as much as 2
bcfd into the UK natural gas grid when
it reaches full operational capacity later
this year.
South Hook LNG Terminal Co. Ltd.
is owned 67.5% by Qatar Petroleum,
24.15% by ExxonMobil Corp., and
8.35% by Total SA. The terminal forms
part of the wider Qatargas 2 joint venture, which will supply gas to the UK. It
is the world’s first full LNG value chain
investment. The terminal, which is being completed in two phases, includes
five LNG storage tanks, a regasification
plant, ship unloading systems, and a
jetty to allow berthing of the world’s
largest LNG vessels.
However, Train 4, with a capacity of
7.8 million tonnes/year at the Qatargas
2 facility, has suffered technical problems at the commissioning stage with
key machinery and equipment, and it
had been difficult to find the skilled labor to build it. The Qatargas 2 partners
previously had said the mega trains

would reduce cost because of economies of scale and advanced technologies. Commercial LNG production is
expected to start any time now.
RasGas is preparing to deliver its first
cargo to Italy in the summer from its
newly completed, 7.8 million tonnes/
year Train 6. India’s Petronet also will
take LNG in the fourth quarter of this
year. “People are still asking for gas. We
have to keep the world supplied and
our customers happy,” Al-Attiyah added.

More research
Qatargas and Shell have committed
to work closely together on researching
LNG logistics under a memorandum
of understanding. The companies will
focus on optimizing supply chains to

deliver to LNG global markets. Research
will take place at the Qatar Shell Research & Technology Centre at the Qatar
Science & Technology Park.
Al-Attiyah said no capacity had yet
been set for the proposed refinery and
petrochemical complex under study
in China. Last June, Qatar Petroleum
International (QPI) signed a letter of
intent with PetroChina Co. Ltd. and
Shell (China) Ltd. to assess the viability
of the project.
“We hope to have a complex refinery
in 2013,” he told OGJ. “It will be world
scale and will produce refined fuels and
petrochemical products.”

Because primary infrastructure was not designed to handle

executives were assigned the task. And
a general reluctance surrounded the
whole issue.
Lately, however, corporate image

New “grassroots” thinking is paving the

to the fore.
Effective waste management actually

Industry has learned the hard way

to adopt acceptable

Waste management evolving
With the right approach, it’s feasible to meet the spirit of UK, US, and
European Union regulations worldwide.
Formerly, contractors dealt with waste
by digging a large hole and burying
it, but now viable
means have been developed to minimize
construction refuse
and to turn seismic

resources through
recycling initiatives
with zero waste going to a landfill.
A BP PLC-Sonatrach project in the
mid-1990s needed to establish water
services and waste management for

Algeria.

MRF can be moved to the next project.
Similarly, the safe storage and transportation of chemicals from rig to rig
can be handled with specially adapted
ISO containers that can be moved with
24 cu m of chemicals in place. With
packaging integrity protected, chemicals last longer, and the site is made
safer with less danger of wind-blown
contamination.

Assigning responsibilities
The question of who manages the
waste on any site is a key factor. The
assignment of responsibility to individuals is essential for segregation of
waste at source because if wastes are
mixed, the battle is partly lost. Conflicts
of interest will arise if the catering
contractor (who also produces waste)
is solely assigned the task because the
contractor’s waste operatives inevitably
are coerced into taking mixed waste.
Outside contractors are easier to manage, especially when it comes to transporting recyclates from the site.
Ideally, a qualified consultant instigates a system tailor-made for each
project covering the following key
aspects:
• Drafting the relevant parts of the
tender documents and contracts to
tackle waste from the beginning.
• Calculating the amount of waste
expected based on manpower and project type.
• Analysis of local recyclers and
waste methodologies.
• Producing a holistic waste management plan.
• Recommending equipment.
• Assisting with equipment installation.
• Training personnel on the use and
maintenance of equipment.
• Providing specialist advice and
solutions for handling hazardous waste.
• Incorporating waste into existing
environmental management systems.

• Training engineers to become environmentally aware.
Handled well, waste management
provides not so much a chore as a
chance to excel, and a great advantage
when a company is being audited for
ISO 14001, for example, with certification process auditors increasingly looking at waste management as an indicator of overall performance. ✦

THE PROFITABLE SOLUTION TO YOUR DIFFICULT LOCATION.
SYNFUELS INTERNATIONAL. Synfuels plants operate upstream at the wellhead to
process natural gas into liquid fuel you can pipe, truck, barge or transport by rail to market. Synfuels
International has developed and patented an alternative to the conventional methods which are
cost-prohibitive for upstream conversion. Our proven process significantly reduces capital and
process costs and is environmentally friendly. By directly converting natural gas into a high-octane
gasoline at the wellhead, the Synfuels technology alleviates the necessity for a natural gas pipeline
and will produce superior end products at a cost below conventional technology. The Synfuels
technology is the ideal solution for remote and stranded as well as associated flared natural gas
worldwide and will bring a much more cost-effective, cleaner-burning fuel to market.

The LNG industry in the past year
has passed more technology milestones in its rapidly evolving recent
history.
Offshore-based discharge of LNG

again in early 2009. The world’s ﬁrst

In June 2008, the company announced delivery of Argentina’s ﬁrst
LNG cargo to the newly constructed

The small amount of LNG produced by
Libya is sold into Spain under a longterm agreement, while BG, as sole lifter
of LNG from Equatorial Guinea, has
either sold its entitlement to higher
priced Asian markets or retained it
for direct sale to its own downstream
customers.

Since start-up of the Snohvit LNG

Of the main suppliers, Algeria is the

of total Atlantic Basin supply to Europe,
although Algerian exports have fallen
to 15.8-15.9 million tonnes in the last
2 years from 16.6 million tonnes in

2006. In part this drop has been due to
some Algerian output being sold into
Asian markets but also because of technical problems with the country’s gas
liquefaction plants that restricted output

and the latter to 4.4 million tonnes
from 3.1 million tonnes.
Flexible supply from Trinidad has
proven to be responsive to regional
price variations, the price premium
over Henry Hub in both Asia and

Europe from the middle of 2007 being
sufficient to draw cargoes away from
the “natural” outlet for Trinidadian
exports, i.e., the US.
One of the emerging characteristics
of the global LNG market has been an
increase in the amount of supply that
has a degree of diversion capability
or destination flexibility. While most
global LNG trade continues to occur as
dedicated or fixed-destination supply
governed by long sales-and-purchase
agreements that prevent diversion, an
increasing number of contracts have
come into force in recent years that
contain provisions to enable diversion.
These may either come in the form
of larger credit-worthy companies willing to take total market and price risk
or sales-and-purchase agreements that
allow the offtaker to seek the market
of highest return with some form of
profit-sharing mechanism contained in
the pricing provisions.
The quantity of LNG supply imported into Europe as dedicated or fixed
supply has increased to 29-30 million tonnes in each of the last 2 years
from an estimated 26.7 million tonnes
in 2006, and its share of total supply
increased to 73% in 2007 from 63%
but declined back to 65% in 2008 (Fig.
3). By comparison, the share of dedicated or fixed trade on a global basis
has declined to 70% in 2008 from an

estimated 75% of the total in 2006.
Flexible trade into Europe has experienced considerable volatility over the
last 2-3 years. In 2006, flexible trade
amounted to an estimated 13.5 million tonnes accounting for 32% of total
European imports, but both share and
absolute volumes declined in 2007 to
8.9 million tonnes and 22%, respectively, only to rebound in 2008 to 13.2
million tonnes and nearly 30%, respectively.
By comparison, the share of flexible
trade on a global basis has increased to
25% in 2008 from an estimated 20% in
2006. Spot LNG imports have remained
around an estimated 5% of total supply
over the last 3 years, which is comparable with the global average.

exists from power generation. Consequently, there are likely to be different
factors to influence future gas demand
in these countries.
Over the longer term, economic
and population growth as well as the
relative price of gas to the end-user
compared with such competing fuels as
oil and coal will mainly drive demand.
These factors will tend to affect demand
from the industrial and power generation sectors.

capacity in these Mediterranean European countries with the result that LNG
is often the source of balancing supply
during times of crisis. This was evident
in the early part of 2009 when both
Greece and Turkey sought additional
supply from the flexible, spot market
as pipeline supply from Russia was
curtailed as a result of its dispute with
the Ukraine.
Another major factor that will impact
future European LNG imports is the
hydropower reserve in Spain. Because
hydropower contributes to around 15%
of Spanish power supply, during times
of low rainfall thermal, mainly gasfired, power is called upon to make up
the deficit.
With very limited storage capacity,
Spain has limited ability to meet such
demand shortfalls. It therefore tends to
make up any shortfall with increased
purchases of LNG. This was evident
in the early part of 2008 as precipitation in second-half 2007 had been
well below average with the result that
hydropower availability was severely
restricted in the early part of the following year.

and Balgzand Bacton Line (BBL) pipeline from Norway and the Netherlands,
respectively. The Langeled pipeline gives
Norway considerable influence over
gas prices at the UK’s gas trading hub,
the National Balancing Point (NBP), as
the existence of this pipeline and other
pipelines to continental Europe enables
it to exploit any arbitrage opportunities between prices in the UK and the
continent.
Thus far, the Norwegian strategy
appears, in the summer months, to be
to push gas into the NBP market that is
then reexported to continental Europe
for injection into storage and, in the
winter months, to keep supply at levels
that prevent imports from continental
Europe via the UK Interconnector pipeline. Thus, NBP tends to be at a discount
to continental European prices in the
summer months and at a premium in
the winter.

contracts are priced by indexation to
heating oil and residual fuel oil with
a 6-9 month time lag. This provides a
certain degree of predictability over the
near-term price of future pipeline gas
supply.
With gas trading hubs starting to
emerge throughout Europe and a futures market developing, those traders
who have access to LNG supply have
the opportunity to arbitrage between
imported pipeline and LNG supply.
Furthermore, with a spot LNG market
starting to emerge in Asia with prices
that are compared with either crude oil
or refined products, these traders can
also exploit any regional prices difference that may emerge.

It should also be noted that the LNG
import requirement into the UK will
grow strongly from 2010. The main
contributing factors to this forecast are
a continuation in decline of UK North
Sea production and increased utilization of capacity in the Langeled and BBL
pipelines.
The capacity of these pipelines has
yet to be tested fully, but in all likelihood there will be times during winter
months when they and the UK Interconnector are operating at or near full
capacity with the result that there will
be an increased pull on LNG imports.
Currently, several LNG import
and regasification facilities are under
construction that will come on stream
over the next few years (Table 2). These
projects will add more than 50% to
existing LNG import capacity. The good
news is that development of this capacity appears to be keeping pace with the
expected increase in LNG imports into
Europe, and it is not expected that LNG
import capacity will be a limiting factor
on future imports into Europe.

Asian LNG demand

average 50% of global

incremental demand growth in Asia
was substantially higher than in other
regions, as imports of key consumers such as Japan and Korea pushed up
regional growth.
Europe’s marginal consumption
growth coupled with Asia helped offset
a massive decline in LNG imports into
the Americas, specifically the US. While
global LNG demand has grown by an
average 8%/year since 2000, preliminary estimates for 2008 indicate essentially no growth. This was partly due to
project delays and will certainly change
this year as new projects push LNG into
the market.
There are questions, however, about
just how much LNG the market can absorb. Significant uncertainty surrounds
prospects for the next few years as the
depth of the current global financial
crisis has yet fully to reveal itself.

for the global LNG market.
This article will look at demand
among Asian LNG importers over the
next few years.
It must be noted that while the term
LNG “demand” is commonly used, it
is a bit of a misnomer. A more accurate
term would be “likely imports.” Even if
an economy slows or contracts sharply
(as we expect
to see in
2009), LNG
imports can
increase with
the delivery of new
contracted
volumes.
Of course, this does not necessarily indicate strong demand but rather
a supply push. This would likely be
accompanied by price weakness and
reduced demand for spot cargoes. For
the purpose of this piece, we stick with
convention and refer to “demand.”

sector’s demand started to weaken in
the third quarter.
By December 2008, city gas demand
by the industrial sector fell significantly in the Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka
regions, as Japanese economic activities
had been hit by global economic recession. Japan’s economic growth is led
mainly by external demand; demand
contraction of automobile, electronics
goods, and other machinery products
in overseas markets are directly hurting
manufacturing industries.
Even Toyota, one of Japan’s leading manufacturers, is struggling with
sagging demand for automobiles in
domestic and overseas markets. Reducing exports, restricted corporate investments, and dull consumer spending
will put further downward pressure on
the Japanese economy.
Japan’s economic growth rates for
2009 will be in a range of –2.6% and
–3.5% from the previous year. We
believe that power and city gas demand
from the industrial sector (especially in
Nagoya, which hosts Japan’s mainstay
export manufacturers, including Toyota)
in 2009 will decline significantly from
2008. Toyota’s domestic production for
February-April 2009 will be half of the
same period last year (i.e., 9,000 cars/
day). This marks the lowest production
level in the past 30 years.
Looking ahead, we expect Japan’s
LNG imports for 2009 to decline by 5.9
million tonnes from 2008. Power sector
demand will decline by 5% because
some troubled nuclear units (at least
two units) at TEPCO’s KashiwazakiKariwa nuclear power plant will resume
operation this year. Industrial demand
in 2009 will fall by 15% and residential-commercial demand will increase
by a mere 0.3% y-o-y.
In 2010, the industrial sector’s demand will increase by 3% y-o-y and the
power sector by 3.7%. Still, total LNG
imports in 2010 (65.3 million tonnes)
will be lower than the 2008 level. By
2011, we believe demand will come
back to 2007 levels at about 66.8 million tonnes.

Korea
Korean imports of LNG posted a
healthy growth of 6.6% in 2008 vs.
2007, primarily due to higher imports
in the early part of the year. LNG was
favored over oil products in the industrial and power sectors due to lower
unit cost when compared with competing oil products. In addition, the start of
a new long-term contract with MLNG
Tiga in 2008 increased available supplies.
Looking ahead, we forecast LNG
imports in 2009 will contract by about
6%, as gas demand in the industrial and
power sectors weakens due to slowing economies. In 2010, we expect the
Korean economy will begin to show
signs of recovery and corresponding
gas demand will grow by 5%, driven
primarily by the city gas sector, while
imports will increase by roughly 7%.
By 2011, LNG imports will reach 29.2
million tonnes, an increase of 6.6%
over 2010 levels.

Taiwan
With an estimated 79% of gas supply allocated to the power sector, the
outlook for Taiwan’s LNG demand in
the next 3 years greatly depends on de-

velopments in this sector. The downturn
in global economies has hit Taiwan hard
as domestic electricity sales sank due to
lackluster performance from, especially,
the industrial sector. In 2008, preliminary estimates were for lower electricity
sales (–2%) y-o-y from a weakening
global economy and the hike in domestic electricity prices.
For 2009, it is likely that overall
growth in electricity sales will slow further along with gross domestic product
growth. Lackluster demand from the
industrial sector will bear the brunt of
weak external markets, reducing overall
power needs. Although this will slow
overall growth of LNG demand for the
nation, the delays in additional nuclear
power generation capacity (nuclear
power plant No. 4) will cushion the
contraction in LNG demand.
Overall, the Taiwanese market seems
well supplied for 2009, reducing the
need for any spot purchases for the year.
LNG demand will be around 8.6 million tonnes for the year, rising to some
9.8 million tonnes by 2011.

short run. Compared with oil, coal, and
electric power, however, natural gas
demand is growing much faster, thanks
mainly to higher domestic production.
For 2008, China imported 3.3 million
tonnes of LNG, up from 2.9 million
tonnes in 2007.
In 2009, we project that China will
import 5.4 million tonnes of LNG. The
higher imports of 2009 over 2008 are
boosted by a number of factors, such
as completion of new terminals (Fujian
and Shanghai) and start-up of new
supply contracts from Tangguh, MLNG
Tiga, and Qatargas II.
Despite the increase, however, 2009
imports are still lower than previously
anticipated due to the slowing economy, which heavily depends on exports.
In 2010-11, imports will continue to
grow robustly primarily due to the
ramp up of contractual volumes from
Tangguh, MLNG Tiga, and Qatargas II,
as well as a new supply contract with
Total, which is slated to commence in
2010. China will account for more than
45% of the Asia-Pacific’s incremental
demand growth from 2008-11.

volumes to feed the power and industrial sectors as copper exports slow on
the back of a global economic recession and reduced construction activity. (Chile is the world’s largest copper
producer.)
Another terminal aims to start up
in 2010 and may come on line amid a
relatively weak economic environment.
Since the economic crisis is global and
not just US focused, we do not anticipate a significant drop (vs. our previous projections) in LNG flowing into
the terminals on the West Coast of the
Americas as exemplified by our basecase scenario.
Wild cards that may affect the
amount of LNG heading to Mexico’s
Energia Costa Azul terminal include,
among others, the pace and breath of
economic recovery, LNG demand in
alternative markets such as Asia, and the
price of natural gas in the US relative to
prices Asian buyers are willing to pay
to secure non-long-term cargoes. These
factors will determine in part whether
diversions will take place.

Observations
Perhaps surprisingly, given the poor
near-term economic outlook, the AsiaPacific region will experience relatively
strong growth in LNG imports through
2011. In nominal terms, the largest
growth in imports will be in China, the
West Coast of Americas, and India.
That being said, however, most of
this demand growth will be filled by
existing or upcoming LNG supply
contracts. If we look at uncontracted
LNG demand in the Fig. 3, showing the
difference between committed supply
and forecast demand, we can see that
the real opportunities for suppliers are
in India, followed by Taiwan and Japan.
Uncontracted demand for the region
stands at about 1.9 million tonnes in
2009, 4.2 million tonnes in 2010, and
12.2 million tonnes in 2011. India
alone accounts for more than onethird of the total uncontracted demand
through 2011.
The limited amount of room for
incremental LNG supplies to go to the

Asia-Pacific market in the next few years
will surely lead to higher imports to
markets such as the US, which has a
large liquid gas market, in addition to
substantial storage capacity.
Moreover, given the significant
amount of liquefaction capacity coming
on stream for the period, coupled with
the fact that US gas prices are expected
to remain $3-4.5/MMbtu in 2009, we
expect to see continued weakness in
spot and short-term LNG prices, at least
for the next couple of years.

Suppliers are mistaken if they believe
they can place substantial volumes into
the Asia-Pacific market over the next
few years, as there simply is not enough
demand given existing commitments,
even at relatively lower prices. The end
result is likely to be a continuation of
relatively weak LNG prices (compared
with the last couple of years) as supply
is plentiful and uncontracted demand in
one of the key markets remains relatively soft until supply growth begins to
curtail in 2012. ✦

New rupture disks feature 95% operating ratio

New disk based tape replacement storage solution

New versions of the STAR X and ULTRX
rupture disks each feature a 95% operating
ratio. The company’s reverse acting family of disks now includes the ULTRX HP
and STAR X HP, which utilize a precision
manufacturing technology to achieve and
control burst pressures at tight tolerances.
This high precision version of these products allows them to be pressurized up to
95% of the rated (marked) burst pressure
under normal operating conditions for ratings above 40 psig.
The maker says that this increased operating ratio performance results in lower
maintenance costs, increased productivity,
and reduced material loss by improving
performance and production and maintenance flexibility. The ULTRX HP is suited
for fully liquid systems as well as gaseous
or partial gas-liquid systems. The STAR X
HP is designed to provide protection at
burst pressures as low as 13 psig.

PetroStor, a new scalable disk storage
platform, provides users with petabytes of
on line capacity.
Tested and qualified with this firm’s
exploration and production software, the
solution is suited for companies that need
fast access to seismic files and archived
project data.
Unlike traditional tape alternatives,
the firm points out, the PetroStor storage
solution provides upstream users instant
access to all their seismic files and project
data archives. Combining enterpriseclass storage from NetApp with real-time
compression from Storwize, the PetroStor storage solution lowers storage costs
to less than $1,000/terabyte. It enables
storage administrators to increase their
storage capacity, along with data reliability
and performance, while reducing associated infrastructure footprint, cooling, and
power costs, as well as administrative costs

associated with tape transcription and remastering.
The company says that lower disk-storage costs help increase the volume of data
that can be kept at hand. Analysis can be
performed more efficiently when data are
readily available, resulting in more timely
decisions and lower overall exploration
costs, the firm adds.
Also the company says it already has
multiple deployments using Storwize realtime compression because its customers
are generating high volumes of businesscritical data. Based upon strategic alliances
with NetApp and Storwize, the company
is offering a solution that provides users
cost-effective on line access to all their
current and archived data. Their data are
now not only more available but also
more secure because users no longer need
to worry about physical deterioration of
tapes, the firm notes.

Prophecy fulﬁlled:
Democracy stalls
climate sacriﬁce
A prominent prophet of climate doom
appears, after all, to be prophetic.
No, James Hansen of the NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies hasn’t been
proven right about a perilously warming Earth. For that to happen, something
will have to change a temperature record
that shows no warming trend in the past
decade.
Where Hansen has been validated is in a

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

recent jeremiad about political responses to
his warnings of climatic catastrophe.
“The democratic process doesn’t quite
seem to be working,” he told The Guardian
of London. “Peaceful demonstrations,” he
said, might be in order.
Hansen, of course, is the scientist on
call to Nobel Propagandist Al Gore. In fact,
he was the voice of science allowed to be
heard in the 1988 Senate hearing chaired by
Gore that started the global warming panic.
Now governments are on the verge of
sacriﬁcing their countries’ economies to
warming precautions that may have negligible effect on global average temperature.
And Hansen’s complaining about democracy? Well, this is the celebrity scientist, easily
NASA’s most recognizable ofﬁcial, who
once fussed about having been muzzled by
an administration unwilling to let him set
economic policy.
He’s the scientist who, according to
John Theon, a former supervisor, “embarrassed NASA” with his fearful forecasts.
And he’s the scientist who declared in
congressional testimony last year that chief
executives of fossil energy companies who
question his theories “should be tried for
high crimes against humanity and nature.”
Now the crisis is democracy itself.
Sure enough, American democracy
hasn’t quite prostrated itself to let a ruinously expensive climate program pass into
effect without question.
The Senate on Apr. 1 defeated a move
that would have let a simple majority pass
the cap-and-trade system favored by the
Obama administration and congressional
leadership.
Apparently, there are senators who want
to think twice about jettisoning whatever
hope remains for American prosperity
in deference to questionable fears about
the climate. Some of them might even
think alarmism is wobbling off its axle and
wonder what that says about its scientiﬁc

Volatile second quarter prices
Oil prices were sharply volatile entering the second quarter of 2009 and are likely
to remain “within a rising trend,” said Paul Horsnell, managing director and head of
commodities research at Barclays Capital Inc. in London.
In an Apr. 1 report, Horsnell said after 5 successive days in which front-month
benchmark US light, sweet crudes hit intraday highs of $54-55/bbl, prices then
retrenched over the next 3 days to lows some $7/bbl below that. “That pattern has
been symptomatic of trading over the past 4 months,” he said, “with cycles of higher
prices being sold into on recurrent macroeconomic worries and weak data. Throughout those cycles, the tension between the short term and the medium term has
been a signiﬁcant source of volatility. During periods of calmer or more constructive
macroeconomic data ﬂow, the widespread view that supply-side damage means
that prices are too low on medium- and long-term supply grounds gains footing,
but when the fear returns, the view that prices are too high on short-term demand
grounds motivates further selling.”
Horsnell said, “The strong volatility associated with that tension seems unlikely
to disappear in the current quarter, and we would expect to see several more of
these episodes of 10%-plus up and down moves over very compressed time periods.
Rather than the swings themselves, the more important feature is whether there is
any trend in the mid-ground for this particular tug-of-war.”
Horsnell said, “The question is whether prices [are] oscillating within a tunnel
that is heading upwards, is ﬂat, or is heading lower. In other words, will the quarter
see in broad terms higher highs, lower lows, or a ﬂat trend?”
In terms of the average price for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ basket of 12 reference crudes, Horsnell said, “The low for the current cycle is
$33.36/bbl set in December, the high is $50.77/bbl set last week, and the latest value
is $46.65/bbl. We would doubt that there is another $13 of downside for the OPEC
basket this quarter, while we would expect to see the value exceed $50.77 during the
quarter; hence, on balance, we would see the pattern as being one of sharp swings
within an upwards sloping tunnel.” As of Apr. 3, the 2009 OPEC basket price averaged $43.27/bbl.
Rig market falters
The jack up rig market is in serious trouble, with day rates down 40% from a peak
over the past 6 months to a current rate of $100,000/day, said analysts Apr. 6 in the
Houston ofﬁces of Raymond James & Associates Inc. “In addition to rapidly declining demand, over 50 new builds are set to hit the water by the end of 2010, boosting
supply by 15%,” they said.
Raymond James analysts said, “We model jack up day rates falling as low as
$55,000 (or 60-70% below the peak), though still well above cost-breakeven day
rates of $40,000/day. Our outlook for the jack up market is now substantially worse
than Wall Street’s view.”
They said, “Day rates will continue to fall unless a record number of jack ups are
stacked. If the market is unwilling to stack the necessary amount, rates could reach
cost-breakeven levels.” They expect per-share earnings among “ﬂoater-oriented
drilling contractors” to fall 15% in 2010, with the “more jack up-centric” contractors
down more than 30%.
As a result, they said, “Several jack up contract options are being declined, and
even some exercised options are in danger of being reduced or cancelled.” The
downturn will affect every offshore driller, “but some more than others,” they said.
“Given that we have seen a material rebound in energy equities off the bottom,
thanks to the recent broader market rally, we advise taking proﬁts (or selling into
current strength) on the more jack up-driven names.”
In New York, analysts at Barclays Capital reported the US rig count continued
its steep descent during March, falling 54% below the peaks of the third quarter of
2008. They reduced the US rig count forecast to an average 975 for 2009 and 925
for 2010. A second-half recovery in 2010 should take the US rig count to 1,125 by
yearend.
“Stimulation prices have dropped sharply in the US in recent weeks, with some
larger jobs going for 40% less than late 2008 levels,” said Barclays Capital analysts.
“The Baker Hughes international rig count fell by 24 rigs in February, led by Europe
and the Middle East. We continue to forecast a 12% decline in non-North American
exploration and production spending in 2009 and a ﬂat outlook in 2010.”

COVER
Boutique fuels, such as those produced in Tesoro Corp.’s 115,000
b/d Anacortes,Wash., refinery and for use in California and other
areas of the US West Coast, represent added complexity for refiners
worldwide.The first article in this week’s special report, p. 18,
outlines opportunities for refiners and ethanol blenders while the
nation’s ethanol production capacity and imports are expected to
exceed blenders’ ability to blend ethanol into gasoline.The second
article, p. 44, discusses the shifting global refined product specifications and how they are forcing increased investments in refining
capacity.The third article, p. 49, covers the expected supply of clean
diesel and naphtha from gas-to-liquids plants and how it will affect the global marketplace.The photo above shows Tesoro’s 58,000

US, Brazil take steps toward ethanol partnership
During a recent visit to Brazil, US President George W. Bush announced a new energy partnership with Brazil to promote wider
production of ethanol throughout the region as an alternative to
oil.
The agreement was crafted to expand research, share technology, stimulate investment, and develop common international standards for biofuels. The US and Brazil, which together make 70%
of the world’s ethanol, will team up to encourage other nations to
produce and consume alternative fuels, starting in Central America
and the Caribbean.
Bush and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said increasing alternative fuel use will lead to more jobs, a cleaner environment, and greater independence from the whims of the oil
market. In Brazil, nearly eight in 10 new cars already run on fuel
made from sugar cane.
Under a memorandum of understanding signed by US Sec. of
State Condoleezza Rice and Brazil Foreign Minister Celso Amorim,
the two nations pledged closer cooperation on researching alternative energy production, promoting alternative fuels in the region
and developing industry-wide standards and codes that could lay
the groundwork for a global biofuels market.
The agreement entails cooperation in research and development
of next-generation biofuel technology, such as ethanol production
from cellulose.
In January Bush called on Congress to require the use of 35 billion gal/year of ethanol and other alternative fuels such as biodiesel by 2017. To help meet the goal, the president also is pushing
research to make ethanol from material such as wood chips and
switchgrass.

WoodMac expects increasing non-OPEC oil supply
Last year’s fourth-quarter momentum for oil supply from outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is expected to be maintained during 2007, said Edinburgh consultant Wood
Mackenzie Ltd.
WoodMac’s forecast came in a report entitled “Outlook for Supply in 2007: Non-OPEC Increases to Continue,” in which analysts
present a global project-by-project oil supply picture for 2007.
Total non-OPEC oil and natural gas liquids production, including Angola, is forecast to average 50.2 million b/d in 2007, up 1.5
million b/d from 2006, WoodMac said. Although Angola recently
joined OPEC, WoodMac included Angola in the non-OPEC countries for the purposes of comparison with 2006.
Patrick Gibson, WoodMac principal oil supply analyst, said,
“Our analysis shows that there will be significant increases in the
[Former Soviet Union] states, North America, and Africa. The main

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

areas that will experience decline are the North Sea and the AsiaPacific region.”
Gibson said WoodMac identified seven projects, led by BP PLC’s
Azeri Chirag Guneshli development in Azerbaijan, that will add an
average of over 100,000 b/d each. Six of those projects already are
on stream.
“With the top 25 projects adding an aggregate 2.1 million b/d
of capacity, there is a broad base to the production growth expected,” Gibson said. “The bulk of the additional supply in 2007 will
consist of light and medium-grade crudes.”
The forecast is based upon a risked approach that takes into
account average levels of supply losses, Gibson said. Unexpected
geopolitical events and technical failures could affect the forecast.
Ann-Louise Hittle, WoodMac head of oil market analysis, said
there is little room in the market for OPEC member states to increase production.
“The non-OPEC supply serves to keep the pressure on OPEC
to defend prices,” Hittle said. “This points towards more OPEC
10 production restraint during 2007, which serves to increase
the group’s spare productive capacity. During 2007 this could be
a source of downward price pressure, although the tension over
Iran’s nuclear enrichment program is an offsetting factor.”

Iraq faces decisions about oil future, study says
Iraq’s decisions about the future organization of its oil sector
will have major implications for future oil market trends and global oil prices, said a Rice University Baker Institute study on national
oil companies.
In a case study entitled “Iraq’s Oil Sector: Past, Present, and Future,” Baker Institute researcher Amy Myers Jaffe said the manner
of Iraq’s participation in oil markets will be a major factor of the
next decade and beyond.
If Iraq reconstitutes its NOC under strategies similar to the manner it participated in international oil trade during the 1960-70s,
it could become a leader working with other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to restrain future investment in oil resources and to limit output to achieve high oil
prices, Jaffe said.
“If on the other hand, Iraq were to restructure its industry to
allow foreign direct investment or to privatize its oil sector, fostering increased competition among domestic operations inside the
country’s oil sector, the consequences are likely to lead to more
competitive structures for global oil markets in general and thereby
lower energy prices over time,” she said.
Iraq’s oil sector needs several billion dollars worth of investment just to restore oil production and more than an estimated
$20 billion to raise output to 5 million b/d, she said.
“The question of how to raise such sums has to be addressed,”

Jaffe said. “If it is decided that higher levels of production are desired, it is inevitable that the potential role of outside investors and
lenders will loom large.”
Jaffe concluded, “Improved national oil company management
will have to serve as a basis for any program to expand production.
Issues related to the role of the existing oil company subsidiaries
such as South Oil Co. and North Oil Co. will have to be tackled
head on.”

Talisman makes gas ﬁnd in British Columbia

Well off Peru ﬂows oil, gas at hefty rates

Talisman Energy Inc. and Husky Oil Operations Ltd. have drilled
a successful natural gas exploration well in the foothills area of
northeastern British Columbia. The companies are equal partners
in the discovery.
The well, designated Talisman Husky Federal d-28-H/94-B-7,
tested at restricted rates of 21-25 MMcfd of gross raw gas. Its flowing wellhead pressure was 2,300 psi.
Production from the well is expected to start by November. It
was drilled along a new exploration fairway, about 100 km north
of Talisman’s Monkman area. Talisman holds rights to about 10,000
gross hectares in the region.
Talisman said it has identified two 100% opportunities on the
structure, which it expects to drill during this year and in 2008.

A well in Corvina field off northwestern Peru has flowed at rates
of 40 MMcfd of gas and 3,150 b/d of crude oil from separate intervals, exceeding expectations, said BPZ Energy Inc., Houston.
BPZ ran four drillstem tests at the CX11-21XD well that covered
a total of 413 ft in the Miocene Lower and Upper Zorritos formations.
DST-4 over 130 ft of pay in the top of Upper Zorritos flowed 40
MMcfd with 1,500 psia wellhead pressure. The nearly pure methane is ideal for the proposed 160-MW, 40 MMcfd power plant at
Nueva Esperanza.
DST-3 of 45 ft in the middle of Upper Zorritos made 3,150 b/d
of 22° gravity sweet crude, no water, with 1,000 psia wellhead
pressure. BPZ may later test other intervals that appear to contain
crude oil.
DST-2 on 138 ft of lowermost Upper Zorritos was inclusive due
to mechanical problems and may be retested later as the company
feels the zone may still contain commercial hydrocarbons.
DST-1 over 100 ft of Lower Zorritos produced gas and so much
formation water that the zone is deemed noncommercial in this
part of the field. BPZ is optimistic that this formerly untested formation contains commercial gas as evidenced on logs from three
other Corvina field wells.
The well is strikingly similar to the 8X-2 well that the former
Tenneco drilled decades ago in Albacora field, which BPZ plans
to redevelop soon. The 8X-2 well tested 4,365 b/d of oil and 21
MMcfd of gas with 893 b/d of condensate.
BPZ plans to rework the shut-in CX-11-16X well that previously
tested 16.6 MMcfd and then drill a second new well in Corvina
field to prove up more gas reserves and appraise the oil discovery.

Louisiana well tab $60 million to 30,000 ft
Meridian Resource Corp., Houston, and others are gearing up
to drill an ultradeep wildcat near New Orleans for which the dry
hole cost is an estimated $60 million.
The well is projected to 30,000 ft to test a Jurassic Cotton Valley
four-way closure in the Biloxi Marshlands area. It is to spud in early
second quarter 2008 on the Deep Archtop Prospect in St. Bernard
Parish. Meridian generated the prospect and began marketing it in
January.
The prospect, imaged by 3D seismic surveys, has more than 14,400
acres of closure and potential recovery of as much as 5 tcf of gas.
“The shallow marshlands water location provides the potential
for significant savings in drilling the test well and post development infrastructure,” the company said.
Meridian said it will spend the coming year in predrill work,
followed by 300-plus days to drill the well.
Offshore projects of similar size typically cost much more and
require longer periods of time to construct the necessary pipelines
and production facilities, the company noted. Meridian owns production facilities and pipelines in the immediate area.
Meridian intends to retain and pay its share of 20% working
interest to casing point in this well. It did not disclose the other
participants.

Toreador ﬁnds more gas off Turkey
Toreador Resources Corp. and partners have made two additional gas discoveries in the South Akcakoca subbasin in the Black
Sea off Turkey.
The Atwood Oceanics Inc. Southern Cross semisubmersible

cakoca East discoveries (OGJ Online, Feb. 8, 2007).
Guluc-1 encountered gas-bearing sands in six zones between
1,226 m and 1,453 m TVD in the same Eocene-age Kusuri formation as in the other wells in the South Akcakoca subbasin. The well
tested 17 MMcfd of gas from 37 m of perforations across all six
zones on a 48⁄64-in. choke with flowing pressure of 1,180 psi.
The Alapli-1 exploration well, drilled using the Prometheus jack
up, is on a separate structure to the northeast of Akkaya field currently under development. Alapli-1 encountered gas-bearing sands
in three zones between 1,068 m and 1,242 m TVD. The two lower
zones, with 12 m of net pay, tested 6.8 MMcfd of gas on a 32⁄64-in.

choke with a flowing pressure of 1,064 psi. The upper zone at
1,239 to 1,242 m TVD will be tested soon.
The Atwood Southern Cross rig, having completed its initial
three-well program in the South Akcakoca subbasin, will now be
released to work for another operator off Bulgaria. And the Prometheus jack up will drill a well for one of the partners in another
permit area before coming back to the South Akcakoca subbasin to
set the Ayazli tripod and topsides in late April.
The topsides for the Akkaya production tripod already have been
set and secured. ✦

Production

Statoil to continue production from Norne ﬁeld
The Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority has granted Statoil
ASA consent to employ Transocean Offshore’s Polar Pioneer semisubmersible drilling rig to continue oil production in Norne oil
and gas field in the Norwegian Sea.
PSA said the Polar Pioneer would help Statoil, which operates
the field, to drill an additional production well, complete two subsea wells on Block 6608/10, and sidetrack an injector well to improve pressure support on Svale.
Norne, which lies in 380 m of water, is part of Production License 128. Statoil said last year that it plans to improve recovery from
Norne and reach a plateau of 1 million boe/d by 2015. It installed a
subsea template to increase production by 10 million b/d of oil.
The other Norne licensees are Eni Norge AS, Norsk Hydro
Produksjon AS, and Petoro AS.

BPTT expects Mango-Cashima ﬁelds output in fall
BP Trinidad & Tobago LLC is moving to bring online 800 MMcfd
of natural gas from its Mango and Cashima fields off eastern Trinidad and Tobago this year.
“This production level will give BPTT the capacity to sustain its
gas production at the level of 400,000 boe/d of oil,” BPTT Chairman and Chief Executive Robert Riley said. He said the production
would go towards meeting the company’s commitments to Atlantic LNG and the National Gas Co. of Trinidad and Tobago LLC.
Reserves in Mango and Cashima are estimated at 2 tcf.
The first gas output from Mango is expected by September and
from Cashima by October. The Constellation and Monitor contract
rigs will drill six developmental wells in Mango and Cashima respectively. Gas from Cashima would be sent to a new hub at BPTT’s
Amherstia field.
BPTT has had a single processing hub, but Riley said that had to
change. “Centering gas production around a single processing hub has
always had its risks,” he said. “With Amherstia joining the Cassia B as
an additional 1 bcfd hub, we will now have much greater flexibility to

manage any operational hiccups that may develop in the future.”
The platforms would have a combined processing capacity of
1.5 bscfd of gas.

Callon plans to produce Entrada by 2009
Callon Petroleum Co., Natchez, Miss., plans to take a development partner and has set a goal of starting production from Entrada
field in the Gulf of Mexico by 2009.
The planned $190 million purchase of BP Exploration & Production Co.’s 80% interest, to close within 45 days, is the largest
transaction in Callon’s history, said Fred Callon, chairman and chief
executive officer (OGJ Online, Mar. 9, 2007).
Callon has been a partner in the field, a 2003 discovery in 4,690
ft of water on Garden Banks Block 782. The company has a good
technical and operational understanding of the field, which has
compelling economics, Callon said.
Callon, which at closing will own a 100% working interest and
become operator, is well along in negotiations with ConocoPhillips, operator of the Magnolia tension leg platform on adjacent
Block 783, to produce Entrada through the Magnolia facilities.
Callon’s initial development plan is to drill and equip two wells
as subsea tiebacks to Magnolia and make provision for similar linkups of future wells. Expected capability is 15,000 b/d/well of oil
and 50 MMcfd/well of gas, subject to capacity on Magnolia. Callon
expects to have some level of firm capacity at Magnolia and anticipates some rate limitation initially.
The first two wells should begin producing in 2009.
Callon is seeking a deepwater rig to drill the wells in 2008.
Despite rig market tightness, a rig could become available from
another operator whose plans changed or from a potential Entrada
partner that has a rig under contract, Callon said.
Total additional development cost is $200 million, bringing
Entrada’s fully developed cost to $15.60/bbl, Callon said.
The company also intends to explore other potential it sees on
the five blocks being acquired, he said. ✦

The JBIC assistance will help Petrobras expand output and sales
to Japan, with financing to cover ethanol plants, storage tanks,
pipelines, and ports, according to a Mar. 4 report in Brazil’s largest
newspaper, Folha de S. Paulo, which quoted Petrobras executive
Paulo Roberto Costa. Projects to be evaluated include the production and sale of ethanol and biodiesel, electric power plants using
sugar cane bagasse as raw material, and carbon credit opportunities.
On Feb. 26, it was announced that Japan’s Marubeni Corp. and
Dutch grain trader Agrenco Group in 2008 plan jointly to start
producing biodiesel from Brazilian soybean oil (OGJ Online, Feb.
26, 2007).
And on Feb. 27 Petrobras announced an MOU with Japan’s Mitsui & Co. and Brazilian Construces e Comercio Camargo Correa SA
to study the construction of pipelines for exporting ethanol (OGJ

IOC’s Gujarat reﬁnery due delayed coker
Indian Oil Corp. Ltd. (IOC) plans to add a 3.7 million tonne/
year delayed coker at its 185,100 b/cd refinery in Gujarat, India, as
part of a residue-upgrading project.
IOC has selected Foster Wheeler USA Corp. to provide a license
and basic engineering package for the coker. Terms of the contract
were not disclosed.
The coker will be based on Foster Wheeler’s selective yield de-

layed coking (Sydec) technology, which is a thermal process that
converts heavy-residue feed into transportation fuels. The Sydec
process achieves maximum clean-liquid yields and minimum fuelcoke yields from high-sulfur residues, Foster Wheeler said.

Hydrocracker to be installed at Holly reﬁnery
Process Dynamics Inc. has been awarded a contract to provide
licensing, a process design package, and reactor internals for a
grassroots gas-oil mild hydrocracker at Holly Corp.’s 26,000 b/cd
refinery in Woods Cross, Utah.
The unit can process as much as 15,000 b/d of mixed feed and
will use Process Dynamic’s IsoTherming hydrocracking technology.
Mustang Engineers & Constructors Inc. assisted in the development of the process design package.
The unit is scheduled for startup in 2008.

Dolphin gets QP gas; prepares for UAE imports

MacKenzie Valley line cost estimates updated

Dolphin Energy Ltd., Abu Dhabi, has received its first supplies
of natural gas through a pipeline from Qatar and is testing its import facilities ahead of the project’s planned commercial launch
this summer.
“Gas is being received from Qatar Petroleum (QP) for Dolphin’s
export pipeline connecting Qatar with the UAE,” Dolphin said
without detailing the quantity of gas received.
The $3.5 billion pipeline initially is planned to carry 2 bcfd,
but the pipeline has a design capacity of 3.5 bcfd to accommodate
expected later demand. Qatar plans to export 200 MMcfd to Oman
starting in 2008 (OGJ, Feb. 19, 2007, p. 48).
Two weeks after completion of testing, the Taweelah import
and distribution terminal in Abu Dhabi will begin supplying up
to 400 MMcfd to Dubai under a preliminary supply agreement
with QP.
Once Dolphin’s own gas begins arriving from Qatar in midsummer for UAE customers, the arrangement for the early gas deliveries with QP will end. Full commercial operations will start in
midsummer, when Dolphin will send as much as 3.5 bcfd of gas
to the UAE.
Abu Dhabi government-run Mubadala Development Co. owns
51% of Dolphin, while the remaining 49% is shared 50:50 by Total
SA and Occidental Petroleum Corp.

Mackenzie Valley Pipeline sponsors have updated the cost estimates for the Mackenzie natural gas transportation project to $16.2
billion (Can.) and delayed the expected completion date by 3 years,
operator Imperial Oil Ltd. said.
The changes were outlined in updated information Imperial
filed with Canada’s National Energy Board and Joint Review Panel,
the Calgary-based firm said Mar. 12.
Project costs are now estimated at $7.8 billion for the Mackenzie Valley mainline and $3.5 billion for the gas gathering system. In
addition, the estimated cost of anchor fields development is $4.9
billion.
The 1,200-km pipeline, previously pegged at $6.5 billion,
would link Beaufort Sea fields to the Alberta border. Project timing is uncertain, but production start-up is expected no sooner
than 2014, Imperial said. Previously, the anticipated construction
completion was 2011(OGJ Online, Feb. 23, 2007).
The Mackenzie gas project would include development of 6 tcf
of gas in three onshore fields in the Mackenzie Delta and construction of a gas and natural gas liquids gathering system, gas pipeline,
and related facilities.
The Mackenzie Valley gas pipeline would have 1.2 bcfd of
throughput capacity, and would be expandable to accommodate
gas from other fields. ✦

‘Flimsy’ energy policy
Congratulations you for “hitting the
nail squarely on the head” by pointing
out the hypocrisy of the federal government and their flimsy energy policy (Editor’s Perspective, OGJ Online, Feb. 23,
2007). We need to cut our dependency
on foreign energy sources back to less
than we were in 1973. The marketplace
should be the dictator of the viability
of renewable energy more than government tax abatements and tariffs.
I am a farmer, and this year I will
benefit greatly from the governmental
policies on ethanol and biofuels that are
enhancing the prices I will receive for
my grains and oilseeds.
Dependence on foreign energy and
the politics thereof that fuel the speculation in the marketplace drive up the cost
of energy for all of us. My expenses for
my farming operation that are derived
from energy usage, i.e. diesel, gasoline,
electricity, fertilizer, chemicals, tires,
shipping, raised my total operational
expenses 10% last year. The profit margin from better commodity prices is
surely to be taken away by the gouging
manipulation of foreign oil and government manipulation.
Again, I say, you made a very good
statement.

vapor, such as ammonia or propylene.
The heat-transfer fluid is then pumped
through a second heat exchanger,
where it is vaporized with the warmer
surface seawater. The expanding vapor
turns a turbine, which generates electricity.
In an open-cycle system, warm
seawater is boiled in a low-pressure
container. The steam expands in a lowpressure turbine to generate electricity. The steam, now nearly pure water,
is condensed with the cold deep-sea
water.
The hybrid system combines features
of the closed and open-cycle systems.
Steam is still generated at low pressure,
but in this system it is used to vaporize
the fluid, which is in a closed loop.

Future work
A company called Sea Solar Power
Inc. in Pennsylvania is currently developing plants based on OTEC technology.
The company has two models in development: a 10-Mw, land-based plant and
a 100-Mw floating plantship.
The company reports that the landbased plant is specifically designed for
small tropical islands and that the plantship is suited for continental applications. The company has recognized that
conventional heat exchangers and turbomachinery are inefficient for OTEC
plants and is designing those units to be
most efficient for their specific application.
Sea Solar Power says the land-based
plant should cost $45-50 million, for
which the company already has financing. The first plantship should cost
about $250 million.
Indeed, it will be interesting to see
if OTEC can take advantage of further
technological advancements to someday
compete with conventional oil-based
electricity generation. ✦

Today many refinery engineers
charged with responsibility for
managing both revamps and
grass root projects have signed on
to a protocol that spells out what
questions to have an outside
reviewer ask in the early design
phases of a project. This makes
sense. Getting a second opinion
is as important for plant design as
it is for major surgery. One
caveat, however. While the
reviewer should not have any
commercial connection with the
project, the person should have
intimate knowledge and expertise
in the engineering involved.

PROCESS

SERVICES,INC.

Dry or wet? Is there really any
choice?
Nowhere in the whole project
plan is this more important than
in process design. The fate of an
entire project depends on its
process design, because although
it is responsible for only 8-12%
of engineering cost it can influence 60% or more of downstream
project cost. A good process
design is one that controls scope
growth, an inevitable consequence of insufficient or inexpert
process work carried out in early
project stages. Competent design
eliminates the need for value
engineering, scope rationalization or other measures that just
run up billable hours. It results in
a unit with no more or less of
the right equipment needed to
3400 Bissonnet
Suite 130
Houston, Texas 77005
USA

Unfortunately, today it is often
assumed that to guarantee such
process reliability, it is necessary
only to develop a process flow
sheet model or review the design
basis simulation. This is wrong.
For the review to be worthwhile
the reviewer must have experience with the process being
revamped or designed and understand the specific equipment
involved. For example, the
reviewer may need to know
whether a dry or wet vacuum unit
is appropriate for the type of
crude being processed. This
experience does not come from a
process model.
What is clear is this: No one is
more expert than the project
manager himself* in evaluating
both the skills and limitations
of his process contractor, but
when he wants to augment his
own knowledge and verify his
decisions he is best advised to
choose cold eyes that are clear
eyes too.

Ethanol’s global politics
Live by politics, die by politics. No one escapes
the rule. But some live by politics better than others do.
As a vehicle fuel, ethanol lives by politics. Relatively little of the material would enter US gasoline
streams if not for state and federal tax credits and
a volumetric mandate. But a subsidized, growing
market for ethanol enriches corn growers and distillers and thus finds political favor among agricultural interests. For others, ethanol can be made to
seem like a way for the US to grow its way out of
dependency on foreign oil.
US President George W. Bush took ethanol
politics abroad this month in his swing through
Latin America. Amid much local hoopla, he signed
a memorandum of understanding with Brazilian
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on cooperation
in research on renewable energy. Brazil has been
using ethanol as a vehicle fuel since the mid1980s and now basks in the glory of showing the
world how it’s done.

Bush made clear that the tariff wasn’t something
he wanted to discuss with Lula. This diplomatic
equivalent of an invitation to dance without
touching represents the “die by” aspect of politics.
In US farm country, the hollow overture still
stirred up worry.
“Transferring the United States’ addiction
to foreign oil to foreign biofuels doesn’t make
sense,” declared National Farmers Union Pres. Tom
Buis in a press statement. Buis complained about
press reports that the Bush-Lula agreement might
enable Brazil to ship sugar cane to processors in
the Caribbean that are exempt from the tariff. “The
current tariff,” he said, “ensures US taxpayer dollars do not subsidize foreign-produced ethanol.”
What a distressing prospect! It’s only patriotic
to prefer that taxpayer dollars subsidize US-produced ethanol made from corn, which even before
distillation receives various subsidies that the

This spring, US ethanol production
capacity and imports are expected to
exceed blenders’ current ability to blend
ethanol into gasoline. During the next
2 years, new plants and expansions of
existing plants will come on stream,
creating by the end of 2008 an 8-10

ethanol production capacity. Only in
2009 will production capability finally

In the

ethanol supplies for both current and

Demand increase forecast
The HBC-forecast increase in ethanol
demand from today’s 5.9 billion gal/
year (385,000 b/d) level is predicated on discretionary blending taking
place—that is, additional blending beyond the amounts mandated by EPACT.
Ethanol producers will offer economic
inducements sufficient to overcome the
blenders’ capital and switching costs,
so they will blend more ethanol than
required by EPACT.
The forecast includes an additional
300 million gal/year (20,000 b/d)
of demand in California, starting in
the second half of 2008. HBC believes
changes in the state’s predictive model

this increase.

plant owners will decide to exit.
Ethanol production assets should be
available at prices better than today’s,
reflecting lower valuations because of
the low-margin environment (lower
free cash flows).
Another opportunity and alternative
to investing directly is toll processing. Refiners should find some ethanol
producers receptive to toll processing
arrangements that will provide producers with reliable outlet channels for
their production and enable them to
increase capacity utilization rates. The
producer will have to provide economic
incentive for the refiner to assume the
offtake commitment and commodity

price exposure, but this may seem like a
bargain to the producer whose alternative is to shut down or sell out.
Relationships between blenders and
producers will strengthen from cooperation in tolling and other long-term
arrangements. In addition, blenders
will gain understanding of the ethanol
industry, including the corn market,
and the stage will be set to forge more
permanent arrangements with producers, including joint ventures.
Refiners, marketers, and ethanol producers all have the opportunity to profit
by recognizing the coming changes and
opportunities and acting on them in a
timely fashion. ✦

US group earnings up in 2006, down in year’s fourth quarter
Marilyn Radler
Senior Editor-Economics
Laura Bell
Statistics Editor
Fourth-quarter and full-year 2006
earnings results were mixed for oil and
gas firms based in the US and Canada.
Factors cited by companies reporting
earnings declines included lower production volumes, increased expenses,
and lower refining margins.
A group of US-based oil and gas
producers and refiners reported lower
collective earnings for the final 2006
quarter, but each group’s combined net
income for the year climbed.
For a sample of service and supply
companies, most based in the US, earnings made sharp gains for 2006 and for
the fourth quarter. These firms benefited
from strong demand for equipment
and supplies, and drilling contractors
reported increased day rates and utilization.

Prices, margins
Average oil prices in the fourth
quarter of 2006 were little changed
from the fourth quarter of 2005. On
the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
24

near-month futures price of crude averaged $60.21/bbl during the final 2006
quarter, compared with $60.02/bbl a
year earlier.
Natural gas prices, however, were
much lower in the fourth quarter of
2006 than a year earlier. On the NYMEX,
the average front-month price during
the recent quarter was $7.263/MMbtu
vs. $12.861/MMbtu in the final 2005
quarter.
Refining margins dropped sharply
as well. For the fourth quarter of 2006,
the US Gulf Coast cash refining margin
declined 41% from a year earlier, while
the US West Coast margin moved 26%
lower, according to Muse, Stancil & Co.

US-based ﬁrms
Collectively, a sample of oil and gas
producers and refiners based in the US
recorded a 10% decline in earnings for
the fourth quarter of 2006. Revenues of
the firms declined 12% for the period.
Full-year 2006 earnings for this
sample of companies climbed 19%,
though, on 6% stronger revenues.
One of the biggest gainers for the
fourth quarter and for the full year
was Anadarko Petroleum Corp., while
ExxonMobil Corp. reported a 9% gain
in annual earnings to a record $39.5

billion. Meanwhile, Cheniere Energy
Inc. posted a loss for the fourth quarter
and for the year.
Following the acquisitions of KerrMcGee Corp. and Western Gas Resources Inc. in the third quarter of 2006,
Anadarko posted 96% stronger earnings
for the year and 119% higher earnings
for the final quarter of 2006.
Anadarko reported that its sales volumes of gas, oil, and natural gas liquids
for 2006 totaled 178 million boe, up
from 2005 volumes of 138 million boe.
And for the fourth quarter, sales volumes were up from the third quarter of
2006, due to a full quarter of production related to acquisitions and record
production rates from the company’s
Greater Natural Buttes and Powder River
basin properties in the Rocky Mountain
region and Haley gas field in West Texas.
Strong upstream and chemicals earnings drove the fourth-quarter results of
ExxonMobil. Still, net income declined
4% from the fourth quarter of 2005.
ExxonMobil’s upstream earnings of
$6.22 billion were down $818 million from the fourth quarter of 2005,
primarily on lower natural gas realizations and lower gas production volumes
driven by lower European demand.
Chemical earnings were $1.24 bilOil & Gas Journal / Mar. 19, 2007

lion, up $407 million from the fourth
quarter of 2005 due to improved margins and higher volumes. Downstream
earnings were $1.96 billion, down
$430 million from the fourth quarter of
2005 due to lower refining and marketing margins.
For the year, ExxonMobil’s spending on capital and exploration projects
was $19.9 billion, up 12% over 2005.

Cheniere Energy Inc. reported a net
loss of $93.3 million for the fourth
quarter of 2006 compared with a net
loss of $18.5 million during the corresponding period in 2005. The primary
reasons for the increase in net loss are
related to the early extinguishment of
debt, termination of interest rate swaps
associated with the early termination
of debt, and an increase in general and
administrative expenses mostly related
to increased personnel costs.
These same factors were behind the
company’s results for the full year. And

in 2005, Cheniere recorded a $20.2
million gain on the sale of its investment in Gryphon Exploration Co.
Without the losses related to the
early extinguishment of debt and termination of interest rate swaps, Cheniere
said it would have reported a net loss of
$30.1 million for the fourth quarter of
2006.

net income for the fourth quarter and
for the year. Their combined full-year
2006 earnings climbed 77%, while
quarterly earnings were up 41% from a
year earlier.
The companies in this group benefited from continued strong demand for
drilling rigs, equipment, and services
that accompany increased exploration
and drilling activity. At the same time,
these firms have been hit with higher
operating and labor costs.
Six of the firms reported lower earnings for the quarter, including DrillQuip Inc., Halliburton Co., and Rowan
Cos. Inc., but none of the companies in
the sample recorded a loss for the last 3
months of 2006 or for the year.
Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. announced strong gains in net income
for the fourth quarter and for 2006.
For the quarter, Diamond Offshore
reported higher day rates and utilization
for its high-specification floating rigs
compared with the final 2005 quarter. Meanwhile, day rates for its other
semisubmersibles and jack ups were
higher than a year earlier, but utilization
declined slightly.
Rowan reported a 39% increase in
earnings for the year and a 10% decline
in fourth quarter earnings. Rowan’s
land rig utilization was 95% during the
fourth quarter of 2006, up from 89%
in the comparable 2005 period.
Meanwhile, the company said its
offshore rig utilization decreased to
81% during the fourth quarter from
93% during the comparable 2005

earnings gains.
For the final quarter of 2006, the
group of Canadian firms posted a combined 46% decline in net income, while
their collective revenues were down
14% from a year earlier.

Talisman Energy Inc. is the only
company in the group that recorded a
gain for the quarter. The Calgary oil and
gas producer reported $598 million
(Can.) in earnings for the fourth quarter of 2006, up 12% year-on-year.
Talisman’s production volumes were

lower for the fourth quarter but higher
for 2006 compared with the prior
year’s volumes. In addition, the company’s revenues for the quarter declined,
and its expenses rose. But Talisman paid
less tax in the recent quarter: $156 million vs. $439 million a year earlier. ✦

FTC: US energy markets kept competitive in 2006
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
The US Federal Trade Commission
aggressively used its authority during
2006 to keep US retail energy markets
competitive, FTC Chairwoman Deborah
Platt Majoras told a US Senate subcommittee Mar. 7.
An investigation kept Chevron Corp.
from acquiring most of California’s
largest remaining chain of independently owned retail gasoline outlets.
The oil major and USA Petroleum on
28

Nov. 17, 2006, terminated Chevron’s
planned purchase of 122 of the independent gasoline retailer’s California
outlets.
“The FTC was concluding its
investigation of the proposed acquisition at the time, and USA Petroleum’s
president acknowledged that the parties
abandoned the transaction because of
resistance from the FTC,” Majoras said
in written testimony submitted to the
Senate Judiciary Committee’s Antitrust,
Competition, and Business and Consumer Rights Subcommittee.

She said FTC also required Texas
Eastern Products Pipeline Co. LLC in
November to sell its interests in a natural gas liquids storage facility at Mont
Belvieu, Tex., to a buyer approved by
the government competition regulator
as a condition of clearing EPCO Inc.’s
proposed $1.1 billion acquisition of
TEPPCO’s gas liquids storage business.
On Feb. 23 the commission approved
the proposed divestiture to Louis Dreyfus Energy Services LP.

cities and wholesale prices in 20 major
markets across the country to determine if a law enforcement investigation is warranted, Majoras said. “If FTC
staff members detect unusual price
movements in an area, they research
the possible causes and consult, where
appropriate, with state attorneys
general, state energy agencies, and the
federal Energy Information Administration. If evidence of anticompetitive
conduct is found, the commission will
open an investigation and pursue all
appropriate law enforcement action,”
she added.
Majoras noted that FTC found no
evidence of illegal market manipulation
of gasoline prices in the months following Hurricane Katrina’s landfall in 2005
but did find 15 examples of pricing at
the refining, wholesale, or retail level
that fit relevant federal legislation’s
definition of price gouging. “Other
factors, such as regional or local market
trends, however, appeared to explain
these firms’ prices in nearly all cases,”
she said.
FTC in December issued its second
annual report on US ethanol protection
and the current market, which concluded that market concentration decreased
by 21-35% during 2006, Majoras said.
The study also examined possible
concentration effects resulting from

agreements between ethanol producers
and third-party marketers and estimated market concentration, using
both capacity and production data,
she said.
“The study concluded that the level
of concentration in ethanol production would justify a presumption

that a single firm, or a small group of
firms, could wield sufficient market power to set or coordinate price
or output levels. The report notes,
however, that staff cannot rule out the
possibility that future mergers within
the industry may raise competitive
concerns,” Majoras said. ✦

Budgets snub
oil, gas R&D

BLM revises onshore
public land regulations
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent

O

nce considered a national investment, federal support for oil
and gas research and development
has fallen out of political favor. The
R&D emphasis now is on alternative and renewable energy sources.
Oil and gas programs are zeroed out
when US President George W. Bush’s
administration prepares budget requests for the Department of Energy.
Oil and gas projects within DOE’s
Office of Fossil Energy (OFE) continue because Congress each year has
restored much of the funding. That did
not happen during 2006 because Congress did not approve a federal budget
for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. It
simply passed continuing resolutions
through the end of the calendar year.
Soon after the new Congress
arrived in January, its leadership
decided to pass another continuing
resolution for the rest of fiscal 2007
and concentrate on preparing fiscal
2008’s final budget. Oil and gas R&D
programs within OFE have been operating at fiscal 2005 funding levels
in the meantime.
Passage of the latest continuing
resolution did not make federal oil
and gas R&D funding more certain.
The White House’s Office of Management and Budget demanded a new
breakout of DOE’s entire budget for a
new report to Congress, OFE Budget Director Chuck Roy told me. He
would not disclose how much of the
approximately $592 million for OFE
would go to oil and gas R&D because
DOE’s full budget has not been finally
approved.

No shutdowns yet
“There’s definitely uncertainty
about continuation of the oil and gas
30

R&D program,” confirmed Guido DeHoratiis, who has charge of it within
OFE. Congress’s failure in 2006 to
specify amounts for it didn’t help,
but minimal funds went into projects
so they didn’t have to shut down immediately, he said.
Progress continues to be made despite this uncertainty, DeHoratiis said.
He cited research into recovering energy from methane hydrates, microhole
and other new drilling technologies,
and increasing enhanced recovery’s role
in carbon sequestration.
A former DOE official says many
policymakers don’t realize that DOE’s
participation has a major impact on
oil and gas R&D. “The microhole
drilling program is a good example.
Coiled tubing orders are taking off,”
said Tom Williams, a special assistant
to the assistant secretary for fossil energy at DOE during the presidency of
George H.W. Bush. Williams is now
with Noble Corp.

Congressional stirrings
Several US House and Senate members are paying attention. “We have
been working diligently to raise the issue with as many of them as we can,”
said Lee O. Fuller, vice-president, government relations, at the Independent
Petroleum Association of America.
Congress and the administration
are hearing how independent producers and universities’ petroleum engineering programs—and not major
oil companies—directly benefit from
federal oil and gas R&D support.
“We’re making inroads. The
question is what will happen once
Congress starts pushing the final DOE
budget through the final appropriations process,” Fuller said. ✦

The US Bureau of Land Management
has published final revised regulations
for oil and gas activity on onshore public lands. The revised rule, effective Apr.
6, establishes requirements all companies must meet to operate on federal
and Native American lands, except land
held by the Osage Tribe.

No. 1 incorporates changes resulting from the 2005 Energy Policy Act
(EPACT), the 1987 Federal Onshore
Oil and Gas Leasing Act, legal opinions,
court cases, and changes in policies and
procedures since the order was last revised in October 1983, the US Department of the Interior agency said.
Major changes involve procedures
for processing drilling permit applications, use of best-management practices
in developing leases, and regulations
and procedures for operating in split
estate situations.
The revised order contains a complete
drilling permit application package that
establishes as a regulation the definition
already commonly used in many BLM
field offices, according to the agency. It
also codifies the current BLM practice
requiring joint on-site inspection by the
agency and operator before a drilling
permit application is considered complete. In addition, it ensures that drilling
permit application processing will take
place within the timeframes contained in
Section 386 of the 2005 EPACT.
It also codifies the current BLM
policy of encouraging lease operators
to use best management practices as
they develop their leases, clarifying
that such practices may be included as
conditions for drilling permit approval.
The revision reorganizes the order so
that permit processing requirements
and timeframes now are found in one
section because several conditions,

policies, procedures, regulations, and
requirements have changed since the
order was last revised more than 23
years ago, BLM said.
Regulations and procedures used
when operating in split estate situations
also are clarified in the revision, which
requires subsurface leaseholders to
make good faith efforts to reach surface
access agreements with private surface
owners. Where such efforts fail and
an agreement cannot be reached, the
revised order provides for a bond to be

posted against damages to the surface.
In addition, said BLM, the order
provides opportunities for private
surface owners to participate in on-site
inspection meetings. It said this change
resulted from comments surface owners
made at public hearings in four western cities and Washington, DC, during 2006. Split estate lands where the
surface is owned by Native Americans
will be subject to the same provisions
applying to private surface owners.
The revised order incorporates a

1988 opinion by the DOI solicitor that
on split estate lands, BLM must comply
with cultural and endangered species
regulations in essentially the same manner it uses when the surface is federally
owned. A more recent opinion from the
solicitor, in 2004, allows clarification in
the updated rule that BLM has authority to require bonding for additional
off-lease facilities that are necessary to
develop a lease, such as impoundments
for water produced from coalbed methane wells, the agency said. ✦

Spending rising for Canadian oil sands projects
Canadian oil sands projects recently
have seen a major increase in capital
costs per peak flowing barrel, which is
putting pressure on returns on investment in an area where project economics are already considered relatively marginal, said Wood Mackenzie in its report,
“The Cost of Playing in the Oil Sands.”
The report shows that since 2005
overall costs per peak flowing barrel
have increased by about 55%.
Additionally, in 2006, many of the
main oil sands companies announced
either changes to their original development plans or cost increases, resulting in
an average rise of 32% in outlays per peak
flowing barrel over the year for integrated
mining projects. For in situ developments,
the average rise in cost was 26%.
Conor Bint, WoodMac upstream research analyst, Canada and Alaska, said,
“Entrance into the highly competitive
oil sands market does not come cheap.
Despite rocketing land prices, the cost
of acquiring acreage is negligible compared to the investment required for a
commercial development.”
He said, “Marginal economics have
always been a concern for companies
operating in the oil sands,” adding that
breakeven prices are high and rates of
return relatively low compared with
conventional projects, “particularly for
mining projects.”
WoodMac estimates that mining
projects have an average breakeven

price of $28/bbl and an internal rate of
return of just 16%. Rates of return are
more favorable at the less capital intensive in-situ projects, averaging 22%.
WoodMac expects some $125 billion (Can.) to be spent in oil sands by
2015. This represents a 42% increase
on its early 2006 forecast of $88 billion
(Can.) for the same period. The significant cost increase is due largely to labor
shortages and increased material costs,
which have created a hyper-inflationary environment within the oil and gas
industry in Alberta.
Oil sands projects are relatively laborintensive, requiring as many as 5,000
workers to bring a project to peak production. “With the sheer number of oil
sands projects, together with the future
arctic pipelines and conventional oil
and gas developments in Alberta, labor
demands in Canada will be pushed to
their limits,” Bint said.
Cost increases are also linked to the
immaturity of oil sands developments,
according to the report, which points
out that companies are learning best
practices during development phases
and still gaining experience in managing large scale projects.
Costs are set to continue increasing,
the report concludes. And to sustain the
current pace of development, Bint said,
“Companies in the oil sands will have
to control capital expenditures going
forward to ensure that project break-

even prices do not exceed current levels
in order to remain profitable.” WoodMac suggests this may point to project
management and contractor scheduling
as key factors in oil sands success. ✦

Sugar in the
ethanol bank

MMS proposes revisions
in its OCS requirements
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent

T

hese days, everyone’s getting on
the bandwagon for increased
production of ethanol, from World
Bank Pres. Paul Wolfowitz to US corn
farmers.
Just last week, as US President
George W. Bush toured Latin America,
Wolfowitz said the US should lower
or even remove its trade tariffs from
Brazil, until recently the world leader
in the production of ethanol.
“Barriers to the international trade
in ethanol need to be examined,” said
Wolfowitz at a conference in London
on financing low-carbon energy. And
he made no bones about saying the
Bush administration should take part
in that examination.

Not listening
Asked by one reporter whether
his remark meant that the US should
lower or remove its import tariff of
54¢/gal on ethanol from Brazil, the
World Bank president—never known
for mincing his words—snapped
back: “That’s what I said. Weren’t you
listening?”
But the Bush administration may
not have been listening, even though
it reportedly wants the US to increase
the use of biofuels in order to reduce
its dependence on imported oil. The
problem?
Despite research from the Energy
Information Administration showing that Bush’s target of reducing US
consumption of gasoline by 20%
in 10 years cannot be met from US
farms alone, the US president has
refused to countenance tariff changes
that might be unpopular with his
country’s farmers.
And the Wolfowitz proposal might
indeed upset those farmers quite a lot.
32

Unlike Brazilian ethanol, which
is made from sugar cane, US ethanol comes from grain, mostly corn.
Indeed, thanks to booming ethanol
production, corn prices have risen to
10-year highs and turned around the
financial fortunes of many US corn
farmers.
That’s based on current usage. But
farmers are also looking to projections that suggest their corn may
become even more lucrative.

Sweet projections
The US is phasing in a federal
mandate for sale of 7.5 billion gal/
year of renewable vehicle fuel by
2012. Most such fuel now is ethanol
blended with gasoline to a concentration up to 10%. Bush wants to
raise the mandate for renewable and
alternative fuel to 35 billion gal/year
by 2017.
Automotive engineers say they
eventually will be able to build car
engines superior to gasoline engines
thanks to ethanol’s high octane.
For farmers, the results are predictable.
The US Department of Agriculture forecasts that the US, already the
world’s largest producer of corn, will
boost land dedicated to the crop by
8.7 million acres in the year to Aug.
31, 2008, to 87 million acres. Some
expect land committed to corn to rise
to as high as 90 million acres.
That may mean a lot of sugar
in the bank for US corn farmers,
but some other US businesses have
complaints. As crop prices soar due
to the increased demand for ethanol,
US soft-drink makers say they soon
may not be able to afford sweeteners
made from corn. ✦

Offshore lessees would be required
to measure all flared and vented natural
gas on facilities producing more than
2,000 b/d of oil under changes the US
Minerals Management Service proposed
to its Outer Continental Shelf production
requirements.
The proposals, “Oil and Gas Production Requirements, 1010-AD 12,” would
also eliminate unnecessary production
rate restrictions and clarify requirements
for documents that must be submitted to
MMS. It said the proposed requirement
for operators to install meters to measure
flared or vented gas is based on a recommendation contained in a July 2004
Government Accountability Office report,
“Natural Gas Flaring and Venting—Opportunities to Improve Data and Reduce
Emissions” (GAO-04-809).
The report recommended that more
accurate records were needed to determine
the amount of flared and vented gas, and
the volume of greenhouse gas such releases contribute to the atmosphere. MMS
said it currently collects information on the
total gas flared and vented, but operators
are not required to differentiate between
the two categories. To improve data collection, the proposed rule would require
operators to report flaring and venting
volumes separately to MMS.
The proposals also would eliminate
some previous requirements that MMS
considers unnecessary in today’s petroleum industry. For example, in 1974, the
federal government required operators
to establish maximum production rates
(MPRs) for producing well completions,
and maximum efficient rates (MERs) for
producing reservoirs, in OCS Order No.
11. This was during a period of oil shortages and energy crises, MMS observed.
In 1988, the agency reduced the MER requirement. Currently, MMS requires MERs
only on sensitive reservoirs. ✦

Millions of dollars are spent drilling
and completing Gulf Coast and Gulf of
Mexico wells that have no chance for
commercial hydrocarbon recovery.
Knowing the maximum depth from
which commercial production is possible would be invaluable, particularly in
deepwater areas. This article points out
a technique that can be used to establish
these maximum depths for commercial

production using a relatively simple
petrophysical approach.
The author has been defining and
refining the technique for the past 40
years. All previously published work
was initiated before deepwater drilling
began, so the emphasis of this article
will be to apply these techniques to
deepwater prospect areas.
The author’s attention has been
piqued recently as to why much deeper
commercial production is possible in
deepwater areas than is possible in shelf
and onshore areas.
The commerciality of oil and gas
production along the Gulf Coast, both
onshore and offshore, can be deter-

mined using petrophysical data in
a nonconventional manner. In fact,
conventional log analysis and associated
data can lead to erroneous conclusions
regarding the quality of production.
Reservoirs that look exceptionally
good from log analysis sometimes don’t
produce as expected and cause disastrous financial results. In other words,
we need to include readily available
formation pressure and temperature
data to assist in determining reservoir
quality.

Commercial envelope
Fig. 1 is a plot of formation pore
pressure gradient vs. formation temperature as derived from wireline logs.
With few exceptions, the expected
quality of production can be determined from the plot. All commercial
production must fall within the bellshaped curve envelope.
Using this pressure/temperature
relationship, we can actually quantify
expected hydrocarbon recoveries as
indicated on the figure. Note that commercial volumes of oil are limited to
areas where formation temperatures do
not exceed 270° F. and formation pressure gradients do not exceed 0.7 psi/ft.
Commercial gas, however, can be
found in most all pressure/temperature
environments. The majority of fields are
limited to areas where the temperatures

Fig. 2 is an example of a typical Gulf
Coast shale resistivity versus depth plot
for onshore and shelf wells. Usually, the
top of the abnormal pressure transition
is encountered between 6,000 ft and
10,000 ft. With surface pipe normally
set at around 3,000 ft, the intermediate string is set in the pressure transition zone in a pore pressure gradient of
about 12.5 ppg mud weight equivalent.
It should be noted that 90% of Gulf
Coast commercial oil is found above
this intermediate pipe-setting depth.

There are exceptions to this rule, as

however, are recognizable using petrophysical data in the manner discussed

and gas-condensate reservoirs
are present. Shale
resistivities will
generally continue
to decrease with
increasing depth
and formation
pore pressure.
If the shale resistivities decrease
to a value where
the extrapolated
normal trend value
is 3.5 times greater
than the actual
value, commercial
production below
this point cannot
be encountered.
This cutoff point
is usually at a reservoir temperature
near 300° F. and a
pore pressure gradient equivalent to

a 17 ppg mud weight as determined by
well logs. Any gas reservoir found below
this 3.5 ratio cutoff will be breached, as
the formation fracture gradient at one
time in the past has exceeded the overburden stress and gas has been lost.
With deeper drilling, the shale ratio
usually decreases (shale resistivities
increase) below the 3.5 ratio cutoff,
giving the appearance of a pore pressure regression.
Quality looking gas sands, as indicated by mud logs, wireline logs,
and such predrill data as geophysical
“bright spots,” will be in error regarding expected recoveries. When put on
production, these zones will deplete in
a short time without having produced
commercial volumes of gas.
Gas recovery is almost always less
than 1 bcf/zone, and exploration people are prone to say that engineers have
“messed up the well.” Unfortunately,
subsequent wells get drilled based on
these “excellent shows,” and further
dollars are spent needlessly.

pore pressure is
erroneous and is
one of the pitfalls
in using well logs
to accurately determine formation
pore pressure.
Fig. 4 is the
profile of a highly
commercial South
Texas Eocene producer in a HP/HT
environment to 17,200 ft. This well
finished with 18.5 ppg mud weight and
log measured temperature exceeding
400° F. The well was completed with
perforations at 16,937-17,064 ft and
produced 27.6 bcf of gas from 1985
to 1998. Note that the shale resistivity
ratio never reached 3.5.
This well is also an example of the
condition that commercial reservoirs,
as in this case, are most always sandwiched between shales that from logs
indicate pore pressures less than 14
ppg gradients. This again fits within the
commercial envelope of Fig. 1. These

Figs. 3 and 4 are examples of shale
resistivity plots in extremely high pressure and temperature environments.
Superimposed on these figures is the
bell shaped P/T curve envelope from
Fig. 1. This curve is easily included once
we have determined the temperature
gradient from the log-measured bottomhole temperature. The maximum
pressure gradient, in terms of mud
weight, for any temperature can be
included.
Fig. 3 is the shale resistivity of a shelf
well from South Marsh Island Block
223. This well encountered thick commercial pays below 19,000 ft in a very
high P/T environment. Note that the
3.5 shale ratio value (17 ppg gradient)
was never reached in the shallower part
of the well. Any gas reservoirs, therefore, found in this well down to 22,000
ft are potentially commercial, although
commercial oil is not possible.
This is a good example of “nonbreached reservoirs.” Also note that the
shale resistivity values in the vicinity
of the pay sands fall within the commercial envelope of Fig. 1, indicating
pore pressures of 14 ppg equivalent or

the case in Fandango gas field, Zapata

Jackson County, Tex., that is potentially

geophysical data could possibly indicate
otherwise.

83 has no potential for commercial
production below 14,200 ft. At this
depth, the shale resistivity ratio reached
and exceeded 3.5. This is the maximum
depth in this area for commercial production.
Even if pore pressure did appear to
decrease with depth, it would make no
difference once the shale ratio cutoff
value has been encountered at a shallower depth, as in this well at 14,200 ft.
Any gas sands found in this well below
14,200 ft would deplete before producing commercial volumes, less than 1 bcf
as indicated by Fig. 1.
The lesson learned here is that the
money spent drilling from 14,200 ft to
TD at 19,500 ft could be better spent
on another prospect.

An example of the above is Fig. 7,
which is the log section of the pay interval of a well drilled in East Cameron
Block 378. By conventional log analysis
and wireline formation tests, the well
looks exceptionally good. Unfortunately, the shale resistivity profile indicates
this pay at 12,265-299 ft TVD (14,328365 ft MD) is well below the 3.5 shale
resistivity cutoff depth at 11,400 ft TVD
(Fig. 8).
As expected, this well depleted after
producing about 1 bcf in 4 months. Fig.
8 is a plot from an LWD log. Temperature data were not available. The shale
resistivity data alone, however, are sufficient to make our conclusion.

The deeper sand was perforated at

18,086-260 ft and produced a total of
3.08 bcf, which at best is borderline
commercial. The upper zone was perforated at 17,476-684 ft and produced
only 130 MMcf.
Quantitative interpretation of the
logs indicates a maximum porosity of
16% and water saturation of 30% with
a log-estimated permeability of less
than 1 md.
This well performed poorly because
of the low porosity and permeability,
even though it is in a good P/T environment. Many onshore fields along the
Gulf Coast exhibit the same reservoir
characteristics and produce at commercial rates and volumes only after
fracture stimulation. This well, therefore, would be such a candidate.

Deepwater attributes
Recently, the industry has uncovered the fact that in deepwater drilling
areas commercial oil and gas can be
found in reservoirs much deeper than
on the shelf or onshore areas. The basic

reason for this is that lower pressure
and temperature gradients are present at
comparable depths to shelf and onshore
areas. To date, although data are limited,
the author has not found a well that

It is expected that commercial production can be achieved to ±30,000 ft
before reaching cutoff P/T levels. Also,
commercial oil zones can be achieved

Brazil.

Petroleo Brasileiro SA
(Petrobras) plans to install the 230-m tall PMXL-1 platform in
172 m of water (Fig. 1). The platform
has a 182-m jacket.
The company expects the field to go
on stream in 2009, with full production
starting in 2010 or 2011. The platform
will have a capacity to produce and treat
about 15 million cu m/day of gas and
3,200 cu m/day of condensate.
Petrobras plans to market the gas
in southern and southeastern Brazil,
regions that have the largest industrial
parks in the country.

Mexilhao ﬁeld
Mexilhao field is in Block BS-400 of
the Santos basin, about 140-km from
the coast. Petrobras discovered the field
in 2003.
Petrobras says the reservoirs in
Mexilhao field are different from those
encountered in the Campos basin. The
reservoirs have high temperatures and
pressures, are at 5,000-6,000 m depths,
and have low permeability.
Field development includes subseacompleted gas wells drilled in 320-550
m of water and tied back about 20 km
to the platform (Fig. 2).
Development calls for installing subsea production systems that
separate produced water at the seafloor
and reinject it into nearby reservoirs.
Another feature of the development
plan is the injection of monoethylene
glycol (MEG) into the wells to prevent
formation of hydrates that could block
flow lines.
The development also will process
the gas at high pressure on the platform, thereby eliminating the need for
installing export compressors.
A 145-km, 34-in. pipeline will
transport the produced gas to a gas processing plant in Caraguatatuba, in the
Brazilian state of Sao Paulo. From there,

O D U C T I O N

another 100-km pipeline will move the
gas to Taubate, where the pipeline connects to the Campinas-Rio de Janeiro
pipeline.
Petrobras estimates that the Mexilhao
project will require an investment of
more than $2 billion.

for clam, is a type of mussel served as

10 years (OGJ, Nov. 20, 2006, p. 43).
The company’s forecast shows that gas
production from the basin may reach
30 million cu m/day by 2011 and oil
production may increase in the next 4-5
years to 100,000 b/d from the current
10,000 b/d.
Petrobras plans to integrate the
Mexilhao development with currently
producing Merluza and Coral fields.
This plan includes the building of a
gas-treatment plant in Caraguatatuba.
It initially will have two modules, each
capable of processing 7.5 million cu
m/day of gas produced from Mexilhao,
Cedro, and other Santos basin fields.
From the Merluza area Petrobras
expects additional gas production of 8
million cu m/day of gas and 25,000
b/d of oil and condensate after installation of the Merluza-2 platform. This
additional gas production will require
expansion of the Caraguatatuba gas
processing capacity to 22.5 million cu
m/day.
Another expected production increase from the Santos basin is from
the interlinking of Lagosta field and the
SPS-25 area with the Merluza system.
This work will increase natural gas production to 2.5 million cu m/day from
the basin by 2008.
Petrobras also estimates discoveries
in the BS-500 development, including
Urugua and Tambau fields, may produce
42

20 million cu m/day and 150,000200,000 bo/d.
Another region from which Petrobras expects additional production is
the Southern area that includes the
Coral platform, in Parana. The field currently produces about 9,000 bo/d.
In the Southern area, Petrobras expects Cavalo-Marinho field to go on line
in 2008 with production similar to the
Coral platform and other new projects
eventually producing 140,000 bo/d
and 3 million cu m/day of gas. ✦

Refiners throughout the world are
increasing investments to deal with
changing specifications for gasoline and
diesel fuel.
The global refining sector has begun

the world. After a year of remarkably
profitable margins, refiners are facing
a somewhat

The most important developments
on the demand side are in the three
main consuming regions—the US,
Europe, and Asia.

Gasoline
US demand will continue to
dominate the global gasoline market,
representing slightly more than 40%
of global demand through 2020. The
region with the fastest growth will be
Asia, but because this region is starting from a much smaller base, Asian
demand will still be less than half of
US demand by the end of the forecast
period. Finally, Europe will continue to
see gasoline demand erode, with 2020
demand just 70% of its current level.
For all three regions combined,
demand should grow by 5 million b/d

1.4%/year.

demand into four different categories
based on sulfur content.

spectrum, demand for low-sulfur gasoline (Category 4—less than 30 ppm) is
rising quickly, reaching 15 million b/d
by the end of the decade.
The significant shift in gasoline
volumes from Category 2 (200-1,000
ppm) to Category 4 is largely due to the
mandated reduction in gasoline sulfur
content in the US in 2005. Another shift
in demand by quality is anticipated in
2014-15 when China and a number of
African and Asian developing countries
are expected to move from Category 2
(200-1,000 ppm) to Category 3 (30200 ppm).
Fig. 1 shows that, after representing
100% of demand in 2001, Categories 1
and 2 fall to less than 10% by 2020.

Demand, million b/d

For the global diesel markets, demand growth will be even stronger
than for gasoline. In fact, global diesel
demand will exceed global gasoline demand by 2020, whereas in the current
market, diesel demand is more than 2
million b/d less than gasoline demand.
Diesel demand will likely grow in
every region during the forecast period.
The fastest growth will be in Asia,
which will see demand rise by 150,000
b/d/year through 2020. The next
fastest growth will be in North America, which should see yearly demand
growth of roughly 125,000 b/d.
Even the slowest growing regions
such as the FSU and Africa will experience average growth of more than
25,000 b/d/year. Altogether, global
diesel demand will likely rise to 26.25
million b/d by 2020.
Like gasoline, diesel is in the midst
of a worldwide shift to primarily lowsulfur specifications, though not as
completely as in the gasoline market.
Fig. 2 shows, with the US shifting to
15 ppm ultralow-sulfur diesel (ULSD)
this year, and the EU following by the
end of the decade, diesel demand in
the lowest-sulfur category (Category
4—less than 15 ppm) will climb to
nearly 12 million b/d by 2020, becoming the largest category.
Demand for the next cleanest cat-

egory (Category 3—15-50 ppm) has
risen to nearly 5 million b/d, but when
Europe moves to ULSD it will drop off
sharply. Demand for Category 2 (50500 ppm) diesel has dropped sharply
in recent years and will remain near
current levels of 4 million b/d through
the forecast period.
Demand for Category 1 (500-3,000
ppm) diesel will remain the second
largest, between 7 and 8 million b/d.
Many large consumers in Asia and Latin
America will remain in this less stringent group.
Finally, demand for the highest-sulfur diesel (Category 0—greater than

2010

2012

to be demand for a variety of diesel
qualities, even as the largest category of
demand becomes ULSD.

Required reﬁning investment
After several decades of structural
overcapacity, the recent tightness in
global refining capacity, combined with
healthy demand for cleaner fuels, has
led to strong refining margins in recent
years. This, in turn, has triggered a
surge in investment.
ESAI estimates that global distillation
capacity rose by about 2 million b/d in

regional specifications. In addition, Europe moved to a tighter diesel specification; hydrotreating capacity there rose
by more than 450,000 b/d in 2005
and nearly half that pace last year.
Globally, hydrotreating capacity
should rise at least 500,000 b/d/year
during the next several years, when
refiners continue to invest to produce
ULSD from high-sulfur crudes.
Finally, with gasoline demand rising more slowly than diesel and with
Europe’s gasoline surplus growing,
investment in coking and catalytic
cracking should be much lower than for
hydrocracking or hydrotreating. Coking
capacity will likely rise by an average
of 200,000 b/d/year through the end
of the decade, while catalytic cracking
capacity will rise by roughly 225,000
b/d/year.
This growth will largely be in Asia
and North America, although Latin
America will see some increase in coking as well. This will largely occur in
Mexico and Brazil in response to heavy
domestic crude production and also target the growing US gasoline market. An
increase in catalytic cracking will take
place in the Middle East, primarily due
to the runaway gasoline deficit in Iran.
Although the pace of expansion
in these various downstream units is
impressive, it is clearly dwarfed by the
pace of growth in distillation capacity.
Fig. 3 clearly shows this imbalance.
Although more investment will
likely be announced for complex units,
investment currently appears quite
skewed to crude distillation. This is surprising considering the continuing shift
to light clean products.

will encourage the premium valuation
of light sweet crudes, although not to
the same extent as experienced during
2003-06 when distillation capacity was
in short supply.
On the other side is the significant
growth in medium, light, and heavy
sour crude production capacity (Fig. 4).
This will also encourage a higher valuation of sweet crude relative to sour.
In sum, the quality spreads of the last
few years were extraordinary but due to
tight distillation capacity relative to demand growth as much as to petroleum
product specifications.
In the next decade, distillation
constraint will be largely eliminated,
which should ease the light-product
crunch and weaken the premium of
light crudes. In the meantime, however,
investment in upgrading and desulfurization capacity in refining is lagging
tremendous investment in distillation.
The quality spreads, therefore, will not
collapse as sweet crude retains some,
but certainly not all, of the premium of
recent years. ✦

The potential 3 million tpy of product
from Qatar and Australia, however,
which is likely to be exported to Asia
will make minimal impression on the
large deficit.

Why GTL?
GTL technology has been in development since the start of the 1900s,
but its large-scale, worldwide application remains limited to only a handful
of plants. The past decade, however,
has brought renewed vigor to the field
and several commercial fuels-oriented
projects will come on stream during the
next decade.
Some of the main forces for GTL as a
gas-monetization strategy are:
• Large, liquid markets for products.
The two key products from a GTL plant
are diesel and naphtha. Global diesel
and gas oil demand is currently more
than 1.1 billion tpy (22 million b/d).
With global demand currently growing at around 3%/year, it is the fastest
growing part of the demand barrel.
Naphtha demand is more than 200
million tpy (4.7 million b/d), most of
which is due to increasing demand for
basic petrochemicals.
• High-quality products. Diesel,
naphtha, and lubricant basestocks
produced using GTL technology exhibit
unique high-quality characteristics. Diesel produced is low in sulfur, has a very
high cetane number, and low aromatics
content. The naphtha is highly paraffinic, giving higher ethylene yields when
cracked vs. typical refinery naphthas.
• Potentially higher value. GTL
investment returns are more strongly
influenced by the prevailing crude oil
price than LNG; therefore, it can achieve
a higher return in a high oil price environment.

Nigeria, under construction. Sasol
formed another joint venture with
Qatar Petroleum in 2001 called Oryx
GTL for the construction of a GTL plant
at Ras Laffan, Qatar. This 34,000-b/d
plant, currently in the commissioning
phase, will be the first of a new wave of
commercial GTL plants. In conjunction
with Qatar Petroleum, SasolChevron has
announced plans to expand this plant
to 100,000 b/d and is also pursuing
the potential for another 130,000-b/d
integrated plant in Qatar.
ExxonMobil had signed an agreement with Qatar’s government to build
a 154,000-b/d plant at Ras Laffan by
2011. In February 2007, however, both
companies decided not to progress the
GTL project in favor of pursuing the development of the Barzan project in the

Almost all of the world’s major
international oil and gas companies
now have some interest in GTL through
demonstration plants or projects at various stages of commercialization. There
remain, however, only two examples
of GTL plants producing commercial
products—those of Shell at Bintulu,
Malaysia, and PetroSA at Mossel Bay,
South Africa. The long-term future of
the current plant at Mossel Bay is in
some doubt due to a potential lack of
gas supplies.
Shell’s plant at Bintulu has a capacity
of 14,700 b/d and produces a range
of specialty products. Having gained
invaluable experience in the operation
of a commercial GTL plant and in the
marketing of the products produced,
Shell is embarking on the next stage of
its GTL strategy through the launch of
the Pearl GTL project in Qatar. The first
70,000 b/d of GTL capacity at this integrated upstream and downstream project should be commissioned towards
the end of the decade with 70,000 b/d
of additional capacity coming on stream
about a year later.
Sasol has developed great expertise
in the production of synthetic fuels
through its coal-to-liquids (CTL) plants
in South Africa. It formed a joint venture with Chevron Corp. (SasolChevron)
in 1999 to help globalize the application of its technologies. Both companies
have GTL projects at advanced stages of
development.

Who is active?

Marathon Oil Corp. is planning to
build a 120,000-b/d GTL plant in Qatar, possibly in conjunction with partners including Petro-Canada, although
this project has currently been put on
hold by the Qatari government.
ConocoPhillips Co. is planning a
two-phase project in Qatar to produce
a total of 160,000 b/d of products,
although this also has been put on hold
by the Qatari government.
BP PLC has evaluated several potential sites for a commercial plant but
has yet to make any positive project
announcements.

of likely freight costs for the movement
of clean products from the country of
production to target markets.
GTL products can potentially command price premiums vs. traditional
diesel and naphtha produced from
crude refining due to their better properties. GTL naphtha commands a price
premium due to its favorable properties
for ethylene production.
GTL diesel, however, is less straightforward. The low specific gravity means
that it does not meet current diesel fuel
specifications and cannot be used directly as a transport fuel. Its low sulfur
content, high cetane number, and low
poly-aromatic content, however, make it
a valuable blendstock.
Table 2 illustrates the properties of
GTL diesel compared to conventional
ultralow-sulfur diesel.
GTL diesel’s value as a blendstock
in Europe will be limited, however,
because most refineries have already invested to produce low-sulfur fuels and
many will not be cetane constrained or
have problems meeting poly-aromatic
specifications. In Asia-Pacific, however,
where fuel-quality specifications are
starting to move towards European
standards, the influence of GTL diesel
quality could be greater.
A further application for GTL diesel
is in fuels marketing; GTL diesel can
be blended with conventional diesel
to produce premium-priced products
marketed as high-performance fuels.
Shell has pioneered this approach, using
product from its Bintulu facility.
Wood Mackenzie has performed netback analysis for most of the proposed
GTL sites in the world. Fig. 3 shows our
view of the likely trade flow for GTL
products.
Based on netback pricing, the most
likely destination for GTL diesel produced in Qatar, Nigeria, and Algeria is
Europe. There will be greater variations
in the destination for GTL naphtha;
product from Qatar and Australia is likely to be exported to Asia. The US will
be the target market for Nigerian GTL
naphtha, and Algerian GTL naphtha will
likely flow to Mediterranean Europe.

Global oil product balances
Global diesel demand is expanding
faster than total oil demand, driven
primarily by the road freight sector and
from passenger vehicles switching from
gasoline, particularly in Europe. Current global diesel and gas oil demand is
around 1.1 billion tpy (22 million b/d)
and is projected to grow at an average
rate of around 2.7%/year through to
2015 to reach 1.5 billion tpy (30 million b/d).
Our forecast for GTL capacity development shows that about 11 million
tpy (0.25 million b/d) of GTL diesel
could hit the market, less than 1% of
total demand. All three of the major
demand regions should develop large
diesel deficits by 2015. In Europe and
North America, the diesel deficits will
be 54 million tpy and 14 million tpy,
respectively (Fig. 1).
In Asia, the combined diesel plus
gas-oil deficit could reach nearly 23
million tpy. The planned production of
GTL diesel should therefore readily find
a market.
Based on netback pricing, the most
likely destination for GTL diesel produced in Qatar, Nigeria, and Algeria is
Europe. The planned GTL plants in those
countries would produce just more
than 8 million tpy of diesel, potentially
lowering Europe’s diesel deficit in 2015
by 15% to around 46 million tpy. The
remaining 3 million tpy of GTL supply
would have a lesser impact on the deficit in Asia-Pacific.
Global naphtha demand is also
increasing due to growing demand
for basic petrochemicals. Demand is
currently more than 220 million tpy
(5 million b/d) and will grow to more
than 310 million tpy (78 million b/d)
by 2015. The projected GTL naphtha
supply of 4 million tpy (0.1 million
b/d) would meet less than 2% of total
global demand.
The key demand region for naphtha is Asia-Pacific, which already has a
growing deficit. This deficit will reach
nearly 90 million tpy by 2015. North
America and Europe will remain broadly balanced in naphtha at that time.

Based on the resulting netback price
forecasts, we expect greater variations
in the destination for GTL naphtha than
for diesel. The potential 3 million tpy
of product from Qatar and Australia
will likely be exported to Asia, making
a small dent in the huge deficit there.
The US will be the target market for
Nigerian GTL naphtha, and Algerian
GTL naphtha will likely flow to Mediterranean Europe.
In summary, GTL products will meet
a small percentage of global oil product demand in the next decade. The
influence of GTL diesel and naphtha on
regional supply-demand balances will
be small.
The effect of GTL diesel imported to
Europe is the most significant, potentially reducing the forecast deficit of 54
million tpy by about 15%. The relevance
of naphtha supply into Asia, however, is
negligible. ✦

Pipelines

Three pipe features determine maximum pipeline
operating pressure: OD, WT,
and metallurgy (SMYS). Adjusting this calculation to account
for one (or more) safety factors
yields maximum allowable operating
pressure (MAOP):
MAOP = (2t × SMYS × SF) / OD
Where:
MAOP = Maximum allowable operating pressure
t = Wall thickness
SMYS = Specified minimum yield
strength
SF = Safety factor
OD = Outside diameter
OD, WT, and metallurgy are all set
when the pipe is produced, so that
the only remaining variables affecting
MAOP are safety factors. WT, however,
can change in areas, primarily as a
result of corrosion or third-party dam-

age. Sleeves (steel as well as composite
wraps) and liners (primarily plastics)
were developed to restore wall thickness
or reinforce pipe in isolated locations.
Few options existed for increasing
MAOP outside of replacing, sleeving,
lining, or wrapping the entire pipeline.
The pipeline could be hydrostatically
tested to higher pressures, but stressing
the pipe carries its own set of problems.
Decreasing safety factors is the final
solution but is likely to be seen as a
higher risk than use of more conservative safety factors and will require
expensive risk remediation.
Local distribution companies (LDCs)
have used lining technology extensively
in settings where lines operate at much
lower pressure than most transmission
lines.
Steel lining, however, is new. The
concept is simple: insert a smaller pipe
inside a larger pipe and, using pressure, drive a specially designed mandrel
through the smaller pipe to accomplish
a controlled expansion to fill the annular space between the two (Fig. 1).
But the expansion process is difficult. Driving the mandrel through the
pipe cold works the steel, increasing
its strength while decreasing its ductility. Extensive metallurgy, joining (girth
weld), and expansion research have
overcome these problems. Pipe joints,
produced to rigid metallurgical speci-

filled during the cold-drawing radial enlargement process (Fig. 2).This side view (photo on right) of an end of pipe treated by SET technology shows how ID is

fications, can be welded together using
qualified welding processes, tested,
inserted, and expanded such that they
meet API 5L and 1104 specifications
after expansion (Figs. 2-3).

The market
Market research shows this technology has ideal applications in areas
where traditional excavate-and-repair
techniques are impossible to use, cost
prohibitive, or would attract significant public attention (Fig. 4). In such
settings, the two broad categories SET
technology would address most effectively are capacity restoration and
anomaly repair.
Capacity restoration includes areas
that would be difficult or expensive to
excavate.
Natural gas transmission lines in the
US possess a class location (1, 2, 3, or
4) based on criteria established by the
Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS). The
class location assigned is essentially a
function of nearby buildings and occupation levels.
Class location dictates the safety
factor used to calculate the MAOP of a
given section of natural gas pipeline.
When class locations change—usually due to population encroachment—
the operator must use a more conservative safety factor, and unless it can take

other measures to reduce the likelihood
of pipeline failure, the operator must
accordingly lower the MAOP of the
pipeline.
Lower MAOP leads to lower capacity and therefore lower revenues for the
operator. SET can restore MAOP and,
through this, revenues (Figs. 5-6).
Current industry options for maintaining capacity (and revenues) at the

SET REPAIRS, DIFFICULT EXCAVATION SITE

lower MAOP include looping the line
or replacing it with a larger line or one
with a greater WT or higher grade steel.
Operators may also request a waiver
from the OPS to continue operating at
the current MAOP. When such waivers
are granted, however, the OPS requires
the operator take additional protective
measures to reduce the likelihood of a
failure.

organizational meetings are under way
between the expandables supplier and
pipeline operators, aimed at addressing
such key pipeline engineering issues
as cathodic protection, annulus space
treatment, hot tapping, piggability, and
inline inspection.
The objectives of the JIP are to further develop, engineer, design, test, and
deploy SET pipeline repair and construction technology, which is regulatory and code-compliant, providing
the means to repair pipelines from the
inside with steel tubulars. The JIP schedule consists of three phases: development; system design and proof testing; and field appraisal testing, which
would initially involve installation in an
abandoned pipeline, followed by field
appraisals by participating operators in
multiple operating pipelines. ✦

Political culture
mangles energy
and ruins lives
Who in the oil and gas industry has
never marveled at the ability of high-voltage politics in Washington, DC, to mangle
energy issues?
An energy-hungry country gulls itself
with fantasies about price-gouging and
energy independence when its political
culture craves power more than truth.
The distorting potential of this culture
has been on ugly display recently in a con-

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

troversy unrelated to energy.
Political reaction was shrill to the Mar.
6 conviction of I. Lewis Libby, former chief
of staff of Vice-President Dick Cheney, for
perjury and obstruction.
“It’s about time someone in the Bush Administration has been held accountable for
the campaign to manipulate intelligence and
discredit war critics,” said Senate Majority
Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) after the verdict.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)
declared, “The testimony unmistakably
revealed—at the highest levels of the Bush
Administration—a callous disregard in handling sensitive national security information and a disposition to smear critics of the
war in Iraq.”
Politics is politics. But these statements
are delusional.
Reid and Pelosi want to make the
conviction serve prejudgment that Libby
retaliated against Bush administration critic
Joseph Wilson by telling reporters that
Wilson’s wife worked at the Central Intelligence Agency. In this view, Libby’s trial
conﬁrms suspicion—important to Democratic ambitions about the White House—
that the administration tricked the US into
an unpopular war with lies.
Facts from the trial refute the retaliation
scenario. Partly because the supposedly
retaliatory disclosure came from the State
Department, Libby wasn’t even charged
with divulging CIA secrets, if there were
any. He faced ﬁve counts of lying to leak
investigators and was convicted on four.
He might simply have remembered
trivial events of a busy past differently from
journalists whom jurors found more persuasive—and faces prison because of it.
But a ruined life matters no more than
relevancy does when Washington has a
conviction that half-truths and lies can spin
into political advantage.
When a culture in which this can happen
takes up a subject like gasoline prices, it
has no use for real market analysis, which
lacks political potency. But price-gouging?
Now there’s something.

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

Energy prices seesaw in early March
Energy prices dipped in proﬁt taking Mar. 2, ending a stretch of consecutive gains
over the seven previous trading sessions that pushed the April contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes to a closing of $62/bbl Mar. 1 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Such a long stretch of consecutive gains previously had not occurred “since last
year early in the summer,” said Olivier Jakob, managing director of Petromatrix
GMBH, Zug, Switzerland. Although market fundamentals remained strong with rising
demand for gasoline and continued geopolitical concerns about Iran’s nuclear program, a slide in Asian and European equity markets triggered a steeper drop in crude
prices Mar. 5 to a near 2-week low of $60.07/bbl. Coming on the heels of the Mar. 1
fall in equity prices on the Shanghai Composite Exchange, the later market losses
increased fears of a global economic weakness that could adversely affect oil demand.
However, energy prices rebounded Mar. 6, regaining some of the losses over the
two prior sessions, as global stock markets partially recovered from their weeklong
declines. The April crude contract climbed to $62.10/bbl in intraday trading Mar. 7 before closing at $61.82/bbl, up $1.13 for the day, following reports of unexpected large
drops in US crude and gasoline inventories.
Energy inventories
Gasoline inventories fell by 3.75 million bbl to 216.4 million bbl in the week ended
Mar. 2, vs. industry expectations of a 1.5 million bbl draw. Crude stocks dropped 4.85
million bbl to 324.2 million bbl vs. an anticipated build of 1.8 million bbl. The Energy
Information Administration said commercial US distillate fuel inventories declined
by 1.3 million bbl to 123.2 million bbl, with a drop in heating oil more than compensating an increase in diesel. Propane and propylene inventories dropped by 3.2
million bbl to 28.7 million bbl (OGJ Online, Mar. 7, 2007).
Imports of crude into the US fell by 650,000 b/d to less than 8.9 million b/d during
that period, due in part to fog delays along the Houston Ship Channel. Yet the input
of crude into US reﬁneries increased by 141,000 b/d to nearly 14.8 million b/d, with
units operating at 85.8% of capacity. Gasoline production declined slightly to 8.6 million b/d, while distillate production increased above 4 million b/d.
“Total inventories, adjusted for demand, are below the 3-year average. In total, reﬁned product inventories declined by 5.4 million bbl last week and are now at 25.2 days
of forward demand cover, below the 3-year average of 25.9 days,” said Jacques Rousseau, senior energy analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group Inc., Arlington, Va.
The fall of crude inventories was counter-seasonal and primarily the result of a
540,000 b/d decline in imports along the Gulf Coast, due to weather-related delays
in lightering operations in the Houston Ship Channel. “But there is also a genuine
compression of imports in progress. On a 4-week average, US crude oil imports are
now down to what is a 2-year low outside of hurricane–affected weeks [in 2005],”
said Paul Horsnell at Barclays Capital Inc., London. “Much of the latest draw in crude
might work its way back into the data, [although] inventories have never recovered
even close to their levels before the Houston Ship Channel delays of December,” he
said.
“The larger-than-expected draw in gasoline inventories, with motor gasoline demand above 5-year highs, stoked investor concerns surrounding supplies as we approach the summer driving season,” said analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond
James & Associates.
“The latest US weekly data have now shown product inventories falling by 5 million bbl or more relative to their 5-year average for 3 straight weeks. Initial ﬁgures
for the whole of February show demand growing at the fastest rate for more than 10
years,” Horsnell said. “The overall level of inventories has over the past 4 weeks now
drawn by 28.2 million bbl faster than the normal seasonal pattern, (i.e., at a rate of 1
million b/d). This has taken the total of US commercial inventories down to its lowest
level since May 2005.”
EIA subsequently reported the withdrawal of 102 bcf of natural gas from US underground storage in the week ended Mar. 2. That was within the consensus of Wall
Street analysts and compared with withdrawals of 132 bcf the previous week and
85 bcf during the same period a year ago. It reduced US gas storage to 1.6 tcf, down
by 268 bcf from year-ago levels but 194 bcf above the 5-year average. However,
Raymond James analysts expect gas storage to end the winter season at 1.3-1.4 tcf
despite moderate temperatures.

COVER
Steam injection in Phase 1 of the Long Lake integrated steamassisted gravity drainage and upgrading project began in April
2007, with the upgrader starting to produce light crude in January 2009.When fully operational, Phase 1 is slated to produce
72,000 b/d of bitumen that will be upgraded to 58,500 b/d of
39° gravity sweet crude.The cover photo shows the OrCrude unit
of the upgrader while the photo above shows part of the SAGD
portion of the project.The project is in the Athabasca oil sands
region, 42 km southeast of Fort McMurray, Alta.The special report,
which starts on p. 38, lists many of the other major oil and gas
upstream and integrated projects in the world that will be coming
on stream in the next few years. Photos from Nexen Inc.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

ConocoPhillips asks to amend propane agreement coastal communities pursue leasing and responsible development
ConocoPhillips Co. has petitioned the Federal Trade Commission for approval to amend its propane supply agreement with
NGL Supply Inc., the FTC announced.
The agreement is part of the antitrust regulator’s consent order issued to resolve concerns stemming from the 2002 merger
of Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Co. That order required the
combined companies to divest propane business assets and supply
propane to the purchaser, the FTC said on Aug. 5. ConocoPhillips
sold the Phillips propane business to NGL to comply with the order.
ConocoPhillips now wants to amend the supply agreement to
ensure that it has enough propane stocks at relevant times of the
year, and that it is able to continuing supplying the product to its
own customers and to NGL, according to the FTC. It said that the
proposed amendments govern the summer supply of propane to
NGL when ConocoPhillips’s supplies drop below certain levels.
The commission said it would accept public comments on the
request through Sept. 8. Copies of the petition can be found at its
web site at www.ftc.gov.

Texas receiving grant to plug GOM wells
The Texas General Land Office will receive a nearly $1.4 million
grant to seal abandoned Gulf of Mexico oil and gas wells in state
waters, US Interior Sec. Ken Salazar announced.
The funding through the US Minerals Management Service’s
Coastal Impact Assistance Program will plug abandoned wells in
bays and offshore waters to eliminate potential pollution threats to
natural resources on the Texas Gulf Coast, he said Aug. 5.
The latest funding for Texas includes $48.6 million for each of
fiscal years 2007 and 2008, and $35.6 million for 2009 and 2010,
according to the US Department of the Interior. Eighteen coastal
counties will share the funding of projects outlined in the state’s
approved plan, it said.
CIAP was created under the 2005 Energy Policy Act, according
to DOI. It said that through the program, MMS provides $250 million in grants annually to six eligible Outer Continental Shelf oil
and gas producing states: Alabama, Alaska, California, Louisiana,
Mississippi, and Texas.

House GOP leaders urge to end OCS delay
Ninety-eight US House Republicans urged Interior Sec. Ken
Salazar to end a 6-month delay early and move ahead with a 201015 federal offshore oil and gas leasing plan he halted on Feb. 10.
“By offering new leasing opportunities in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as well as in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico, the proposed
plan is appropriately expansive, provides maximum flexibility to
properly utilize all of our nation’s domestic resources, and helps

in the deep waters off their coastlines,” the House Republican
members said in a July 31 letter to Salazar.
“Important offshore areas, like those in Alaska, offer tremendous natural gas and oil resources. By some estimates the Chukchi
Sea, off Alaska’s coast, contains as much natural gas and oil as the
country has produced in the Gulf of Mexico since 1942. The administration should not continue to stand in the way of American
energy development,” the letter said.
Salazar announced the delay to obtain more public comment
and to broaden the plan to include alternative and renewable energy sources. His predecessor, Dirk A. Kempthorne, launched the
lease plan earlier than scheduled last summer in response to record
high crude oil and gasoline prices.
The letter said that the lawmakers also hoped the US Minerals
Management Service maintains the current 2007-12 Outer Continental Shelf leasing plan for all available areas, including the Gulf
of Mexico, Mid-Atlantic Coast, and Alaska.

Russians sign accords in Nicaragua, Venezuela
The Nicaraguan government, following the lead of Venezuela,
has signed an agreement allowing exploration by a Russian consortium.
“The concessions include the Caribbean and Pacific, both offshore and on land,” said Francisco Lopez, president of the Nicaraguan Petroleum Enterprise. He said a technical board would be
installed to analyze implementation of the agreement.
Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin said the proposed
exploration in Nicaragua would be carried out by the Russian National Oil Consortium, created on Oct. 8, 2008, and comprising
Rosneft, Gazprom, Lukoil, TNK-BP, and Surgutneftegaz.
Sechin did not say how much Russia could invest in Nicaraguan
exploration, saying only, “We must first carry out in-depth studies
to calculate the investments.”
Nicaragua last September became the only country to join Russia in recognizing the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia
from the small Caucasus state of Georgia.
A month earlier, Russian military forces had invaded Georgia, a
former Soviet republic, and forced the shutdown of major international oil and gas pipeline operations.
Prior to his visit to Nicaragua, Sechin also met with Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez and signed a range of economic agreements
including one between OAO Gazprom and Petroleos de Venezuela
on a joint venture in oil and gas services.
The Venezuelan newspaper El Universal reported the joint firm
will take over some gas compression plants formerly operated by
Exterran Holdings Inc.
Earlier this year, according to El Universal, PDVSA nationalized

Development

Development advances at East Siberian ﬁeld
Verkhnechonskneftegas (VCNG), an affiliate of TNK-BP, has let a
contract to KBR for front-end engineering and design of a production facility at giant Verkhnechonskoye oil field in Eastern Siberia.
The contract covers a single facility to handle 140,000 b/d of
crude oil to be tied into a new 85-km link to the Eastern Siberian
Pacific Ocean (ESPO) pipeline.
The remote field, 4,000 km from Moscow and 1,100 km north
of the regional capital of Irkutsk, holds reserves of about 1.4 million bbl, development of which will require investment of $4-5
billion, according to TNK-BP. It was discovered in 1978.
VCNG, in which TNK-BP holds a 68.5% interest, completed a
pilot development phase in 2007 and began an “early oil” project
last year. That work included construction of the pipeline link to
ESPO and a road to neighboring Talakan field. Deliveries into the
ESPO line began last October.
Target flow from the early-oil project is 20,000-30,000 b/d by
the end of this year. TNK-BP hopes to achieve plateau production
of 140,000 b/d by 2014.
KBR said the field will produce at the plateau level through 430
production wells and have 215 water-injection wells. It will have
75 well pads.
The reservoir is about 1,700 m deep and has initial reservoir
pressure of about 2,250 psia and temperature of 12°-20° C.
Rosneft is another major shareholder in VCNG.

100 MMcfe/d gross operated by the end of 2009 and 80 MMcfe/d
net or 110 MMcfe/d gross operated by the end of 2010.
The company will average two rigs in the second half of 2009
and in 2010 to drill 10 and 20 net wells, respectively.

Dana Petroleum plugs Tafejjart-1 well
Dana Petroleum (E&P) Ltd. plugged the onshore Tafejjart-1 well
(TAJ-1) in Morocco because it has not discovered commercial
quantities of gas.
A 2,000 HP rig provided by Aladdin Middle East Ltd. drilled a
TD of 3,274 m on the Bouanane license and targeted Ordovician
sandstone. “However, cuttings information and wireline log data
indicated poor reservoir quality with low porosity,” said Tethys Oil
AB, a partner in the well.
“This wildcat came in very close to prognosis. Several of the
necessary criteria for a successful exploration well were fulfilled,
and with better porosity in the reservoir it would have been a success,” said Magnus Nordin, managing director of Tethys Oil.
The company will withdraw from the 2,000 sq km license to
focus on projects in Oman.
Dana Petroleum has a 50% interest in the license, with its partners Moroccan state oil and mining company, ONHYM, holding
25%, Eastern Petroleum (Cyprus) Ltd. with 12.5%, and Tethys Oil
AB with 12.5%. Tethys has a share of 16.66% of all expenditures on
the license above $12 million.

Chesapeake adds volume in Granite Wash
The western Oklahoma Colony and Texas Panhandle Granite
Wash oil and gas-condensate plays are delivering exceptional rates
of return even in the current low commodity price environment,
said Chesapeake Energy Corp.
The Colony play, in Custer and Washita counties, Okla., and the
Texas Panhandle play in Hemphill and Wheeler counties, Tex., are
Chesapeake’s highest rate of return play due to high oil and natural
gas liquids content. Pretax rates of return are 135-140% based on
$7/Mcf gas and $70/bbl oil from a 4.75-5.7 bcfe horizontal well
drilled and completed for $5.5-6.25 million.
Chesapeake holds 60,000 net acres in Colony and 40,000 net
acres in Texas Panhandle. It is the largest leaseholder, most active
driller, and largest producer in Colony.
In Colony, Chesapeake averages 90 MMcfe/d net or 165 MMcfe/d
gross operated and plans to raise that to 105 MMcfe.d net or 190
MMcfe/d gross operated by the end of 2009 and 140 MMcfe/d net
or 250 MMcfe/d gross operated by the end of 2010.
The company plans to average four rigs in the second half of
2009 to drill 10 net wells and seven rigs in 2010 for 40 net wells.
Three recent completions in Washita County averaged initial 30-day
rates of 17.1 MMcfe/d including 1,300 b/d of oil, 16 MMcfe/d
including 900 b/d of oil, and 15.4 MMcfe/d including 1,100 b/d
of oil.
In the Texas Panhandle play, Chesapeake produces 70 MMcfe/d

Santos awards contract for Gladstone LNG
Santos Ltd. let a front-end engineering design contract to Foster
Wheeler to determine how it should extract and transport coalseam gas for the upstream phase of its Gladstone LNG project in
Queensland, Australia. The value of the deal was not disclosed.
Foster Wheeler will focus on delivering coal-seam gas to the
transmission pipeline and associated infrastructure and services,
including power generation and water treatment facilities. The
work is scheduled to be finished in the first quarter of 2010.
Santos will source 170-220 petajoules/year of coal-seam gas
from Fairview, Roma, and Arcadia fields in Central Queensland to a
planned single train onshore LNG facility. Gladstone LNG Pty. Ltd.
(GLNG) will have a 3-4 million tonnes/year LNG processing train
and associated infrastructure.
In June, Santos said Petronas of Malaysia was willing to buy 2
million tonnes/year of LNG starting from 2014 with an option of
an additional 1 million tonnes/year under a heads of agreement.
However, this was conditional only on the GLNG project’s receiving final approval to proceed (OGJ Online, June 18).
Santos is the operator with a 60% stake in the project with Petronas holding 40%. The project is expected to cost $7.7 billion

The Middle East, 28 1.40 N, 48 45.48 E, 7:25 PM

The many dangers facing Tony Sala’s wireline loads
10,490 feet down a sour well, are really haunting him.

Engineered materials.
Sandvik specializes in duplex, super-duplex,
hyper-duplex steels and other advanced
alloys. They are extremely resistant to corrosion caused by salt and aggressive chemicals
otherwise threatening oil and gas operations.
The remarkable mechanical strength of these
materials also allows more compact system
designs, lighter yet tougher tube installations
and more versatile wirelines.

Invaluable instruments lost in the deep.
A 430-lb tool string stuck halfway down – shutting down production for days.
When you’re a wireline supervisor on a busy platform in the
Middle East, you know all about deep, hot, sour wells. And the
damage they’re capable of inflicting on your equipment.
The risks and stakes involved are making a lot of people quite
concerned, to say the least.
Others stay perfectly calm, cool and collected.
Their secret? Wirelines made of engineered materials from Sandvik.
These materials cope with corrosion and mechanical stress like
nothing else. No matter how deep the well or how sour the crude.
Sandvik makes several of the world’s toughest wireline qualities.

They include duplex and high-alloy austenitic stainless steels with
astonishing corrosion resistance. And whose breaking loads equal
– or even surpass – carbon steel.
As the oil and gas industry goes up against more hostile operating conditions, Sandvik’s cure is more innovative metallurgical
technology and more advanced materials.
We continuously develop new, improved grades of these materials, along with better manufacturing processes. The result is
equipment that withstands corrosion, pressure, high temperatures
and mechanical stress better than ever before.
Engineered materials from Sandvik. Possibly your best insurance
against bad news.

Aramco: 400 wells prepped for Khurais start
Saudi Aramco said its Southern Area Production Engineering
and Production Services Departments prepared more than 400
wells for completion before supergiant Khurais oil field came on
stream in June (OGJ, July 20, 2009, p. 34).
The units managed 232 oil-production, 119 water-injection,
and 58 observation wells, as well as stimulation work and the installation and testing of electrical submersible pumps.
The stimulation work covered 118 power-water injectors and
14 oil producers. It included the pumping of 12 million gal of
fluid.
Aramco said the use of rigless coiled-tubing technology tripled
injection rates in comparison with conventional methods using
drill pipe in a rig.
At Khurais, which added 1.2 million b/d to Saudi production
capacity, the company made its first use of distributed temperature
sensors combined with multilateral tools in a number of reservoir
access wells.
Khurais development made heavy use of permanent downhole
monitoring sensors, remote-control chokes, and multiphase flowmeters. Data flow through a remote terminal unit at wellsites to
field control rooms and eventually to ’Udhailiyah and Abqaiq for
validation and interpretation.

Bolivia’s Itau ﬁeld declared commercial
France’s Total declared Bolivia’s giant Itau gas-condensate field
commercial, 10 years after its discovery in Tarija Department.
Itau, discovered in 1999 in Block XX Tarija West, is scheduled
to start production in mid-2010 at an initial 50 MMcfd of gas, the
company said.
Gas is to be processed at Petrobras Bolivia’s 210 MMcfd plant in
adjacent San Alberto field just north of the border with Argentina
and less than 100 miles west of the border with Paraguay. Total
operates Itau with 75% equity.
The Itau X-1A discovery well tested gas-condensate from the
Devonian Huamampampa formation. TD is 18,917 ft.
San Alberto was discovered in 1998 and began producing in
early 2001. Itau’s development has been delayed until its supply
was needed for throughput in the Bolivia-Brazil gas pipeline.
The Total Group plans to spud an appraisal well by the end of
2009 at Incahuasi gas-condensate field found in 2004 on the Ipati
block 80 miles north of Itau in Chuquisaca Department. It will drill
the appraisal well on the adjacent Aquio license. Total owns 80%

mixed company.

TAQA to operate Dutch gas ﬁeld platform
TAQA Energy BV (TAQA Energy) will operate the L11b-A platform in the Dutch North Sea, which will start production from the
southern part of L8-D gas field later this year.
The Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. subsidiary has acquired
a 15% interest in the license, platform, and connection to the
Noordgastransport (NGT) pipeline. TAQA’s partner, Cirrus Energy
Nederland BV, will operate the L11b license, which is 50 km north
of Den Helder.
The L11b Group, comprising Chevron Exploration & Production Netherlands BV, DSM Energie BV, and EBN, sold the assets to
the L8-D Field Group for an undisclosed amount.
The L8-D Group includes TAQA Energy, Cirrus Energy Nederland, DSM Energie, Energy Investments BV, EWE AG, and EBN.
The L8-D structure holds an estimated 323 bcf of gas in place,
according to a report compiled by GLJ Petroleum Consultants Ltd.
In February, the L11b-A06 appraisal well (previously called
L11-13) tested gas at a maximum stabilized flow rate of 30.6
MMscfd on a 48/64 in. choke at a flowing wellhead pressure of
200 bar (OGJ Online, Apr. 1, 2009). The group used the Noble
Lynda Bossler jack up to reach a TVD of 4,200 m.
“Production from the nearly depleted L11b-A field has been
shut-in, and modifications to the existing process equipment are
under way to allow for the tie-in of the L11b-A06 well,” said Cirrus Energy. “This is expected to be completed in the fourth calendar
quarter of 2009, at which time L8-D field production is expected
to commence from the L11b-A06 well.”
A second L8-D field appraisal-development well is to be drilled
from the L11b-A platform later this year, which, if successful, is
expected to be on production during early 2010.
TAQA also will take over DSM Energy’s share in the L8-D Group
following its acquisition of the company. The deal is expected to
close in the third quarter of this year, subject to regulatory approvals and notifications.
TAQA has a 15% share in the LD-8 Group. Cirrus Energy Nederland has 25.479%, DSM Energie has 2.88%, EBN holds 41.9%, Energy06 Investments BV has 1.341%, and EWE AG has 13.4%. ✦

Technip’s initial work will be at Wesseling. It includes modification of desulfurization and hydrogen units and construction of
new facilities. Wesseling will desulfurize gas oil from Godorf.
Technip handled basic design for the first phase of the integration project, called Connect, and is working on basic design packages for later phases.

Midcontinent Express begins full operation
Natural gas service on the roughly 500-mile Midcontinent Express Pipeline (MEP) began Aug. 1 between Delhi, La., and Transcontinental Pipe Line’s Station 85 in Butler, Ala. Interim service
from Bennington, Okla., to Delhi began in April.
Completion of the final segment of MEP connects production
from the Barnett shale, Bossier sands, and other plays in the region
to the eastern US.
MEP has multiple receipt and delivery points along its length,
crossing northeastern Texas, northern Louisiana, and central Mississippi between Oklahoma and Alabama.
Capacity is currently 1.25 bcfd in Zone 1, which interconnects
with the Columbia Gulf Transmission system in Delhi and up to
0.84 bcfd in Zone 2, which interconnects with the Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line system in Butler. An expected 2010 expansion of
the pipeline will further increase MEP’s capacity to about 1.8 bcfd
in Zone 1 and 1.2 bcfd in Zone 2. The pipeline’s capacity, including
the expansion capacity, is fully subscribed by long-term binding
commitments.
Construction of two additional compression stations, one in
Cass County, Tex., and a second in Hinds County, Miss., will start in
fall 2009 to meet this expansion timeline.
MEP is a joint venture of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP and
Energy Transfer Partners LP. Kinder Morgan constructed and will
operate the pipeline.

Dolphin Energy announces ﬁnancing
The Dolphin Energy consortium raised $4.1 billion to refinance
debt, help fund construction of a gas pipeline, and pay for the
refinancing fees.
Dolphin said the $4.1 billion will be used to repay a $3.45
billion loan secured in 2005, to provide 70% of the construction
costs of the 244-km, 48-in. Taweelah-Fujairah pipeline, and to pay
for fees related to the refinancing.
Dolphin’s majority shareholder, the Abu Dhabi government’s
investment firm Mubadala Development Co. (51%), reportedly
played a key role in raising the financing, while partners Total SA
and Occidental Petroleum (24.5% each) are lending the project
$1.2 billion.
Last month, Australia’s export credit agency EFIC said it was
guaranteeing Gasco’s $6.5 million contract to supply and supervise
installation of two heaters for the pipeline.
Gasco’s client is Russia’s Stroytransgaz, which was awarded a
$418 million engineering, procurement, and construction contract for the pipeline in June 2008.

TAQA Bratani operates Brent pipeline system
TAQA Bratani Ltd. assumed operatorship from Shell UK Exploration & Production for the Brent System pipeline in the UK North
Sea, marking a change in management for the first time in almost
30 years.
The pipeline delivers 100,000 b/d of oil from 20 North
Sea fields and constitutes around 8% of offshore oil production. It accounts for almost 60% of the input at the Sullom Voe
terminal in the Shetland Islands, in which the company has a
24% stake.
TAQA will have a 16% interest in the system and has invested
in experienced staff and first class IT and systems infrastructure to
work with its other Brent partners, such as ExxonMobil Exploration & Production Norway AS and Lundin Thistle Ltd.
TAQA will focus on its operated Cormorant Alpha platform as
well as the 150 km pipeline connecting Cormorant Alpha to the BP
PLC operated Sullom Voe terminal.
Leo Koot, TAQA Bratani’s managing director, said: “This is the
latest step in our North Sea activity program, which this year already has seen TAQA increase production from our operated assets,
initiate drilling, and near-field exploration.”
In December, TAQA completed the $631 million purchase of
assets in the UK North Sea from Shell UK Ltd. and ExxonMobil
Corp. (OGJ Online, Dec. 7, 2008) TAQA operates Tjern, Kestrel, Eider, Pelican, Cormorant North, and Cormorant South fields and
related assets. They lie in 150-167 m of water northeast of Lerwick
in Shetland.
TAQA is the UK arm of the Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. ✦

Politics and fuel choice
The folly of governmental fuel choice is playing
out vividly in the shadowed margins of fiscal politics.
Hydrogen, everyone’s favorite vehicle fuel a few years
ago, has fallen from grace—at least in some quarters.
Who can forget the hydrogen hooplah that
gripped the US Department of Energy during the
administration of George W. Bush? According to
DOE’s press notices, a “hydrogen economy” loomed.
There, vehicles would emit nothing more than water.
Global warming would cease. The country would
quit importing oil. All that stood between the US
and hydrutopia was reversal of a chicken-and-egg
problem: Build a hydrogen distribution system, and
the rest would take care of itself. It was only a matter
of political will.
Of course, political will tends to change with inconvenient frequency. It’s doing so now with hydrogen.

Nothing for hydrogen
In its federal budget proposal for fiscal 2010, the
administration of President Barack Obama requested
nothing for hydrogen research. Some of the reason no doubt reflects the administration’s revulsion
toward anything associated with the former president. But some, too, shows a measure of welcome
pragmatism. The hydrogen fad, based though it was
on genuine fuel advantages, overlooked huge commercial problems, most of them tied to the energy
needed to isolate the hydrogen atom.
Explaining to Congress his department’s loss of
appetite for hydrogen research, Energy Sec. Stephen
Chu in May said the government had better uses for
the money. He, for one, sees greater potential in electric plug-in cars and biofuels, at least over the next
20-30 years. As a Nobel Prize-winning physicist and
former director of DOE’s Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory, Chu brings impressive scientific authority
to these judgments.
Yet it’s not difficult to find similarly qualified
scientists who think the government is foolish to
abandon hydrogen research. Many of them work for
the automakers that have committed themselves to
commercialization of hydrogen vehicles or for universities hoping to soak up some of the $1.2 billion
Bush channeled toward hydrogen.
Research funding notwithstanding, knowledgeable
people can disagree honestly over the merits of one
18

fuel in relation to others. Without question, upperlevel disagreement such as this generates insights
enlightening to energy choices. But it can’t efficiently
make those choices. If it’s to produce policy, academic argument must yield to the clanking machinations
of politics, with all its deal-making and insidious
influences. Ultimately, the laboratory’s soaring truth
becomes the cloakroom’s squirming compromise.
Energy choices are best left to free markets, fully
informed. This historic verity, which tends these days
to be dismissed as quaint ideology, has received no
clearer or more immediate demonstration than with
the national calamity developing from biofuels.
Now and even more so in the future, biofuels
surely must contribute to total energy supply. They
will do so only if the government confines itself to
conducting research and disseminating the results.
Instead, lawmakers and presidents of both major
political parties have seen fit to push fuel ethanol
and biodiesel into the market with mandates and
generous subsidization. For the fuels themselves, the
consequences are disastrous.
Overbuilding—encouraged in part by state-guaranteed loans—and market surprises have crushed the
economics of ethanol manufacture. A rushed conversion of soybean agriculture into corn has raised the
price of biodiesel’s main feedstock while the product’s price has sunk. Bankruptcy courts are selling
distressed plants at dimes on the dollar.
Congressional mandates for biofuels, which rise
each year through 2022, probably are futile. Because
the gasoline market soon won’t be able to absorb
ethanol at mandated rates, the ethanol lobby wants
increased blending levels. But that’s just the immediate problem. Satisfying future mandates depends on
the development and implementation of technology
that’s not yet commercial and on a delivered supply
of plant waste that probably won’t materialize.

Program fails
Biofuels haven’t failed. The failure is an ill-considered program to rush them to market.
Renewable and other unconventional fuels have an
important and growing role to play in energy supply.
Governments have roles to play in stimulating their
growth. Ultimately, however, fuels need solid commercial grounding, which never results from political
caprice. ✦

T E R E S T
Russia has historically exported
medium sour crude, but over the next
decade there will be more than a 2 million b/d increase in light sweet exports.
Several developments will bring about
this transformation.
A geographic redistribution of Russian crude output, with new growth
coming in such areas as East Siberia and
Timan-Pechora, will reshape Russian
output. Much of the
new supply will be
light sweet, while output of medium sour
will decline.
Meanwhile, Russian export infrastructure will continue to
develop in line with these internal shifts
and Russian foreign economic objectives. Changes to the export infrastructure will enable more light sweet to
reach the market without commingling
with medium sour crude in the main
pipeline system.
Growth of exports from Kazakhstan
via Russia will also be significant. The
transformation of Russian crude exports
is already under way. The approaching
launch of the East Siberia-Pacific Ocean
(ESPO) pipeline and development of
East Siberian fields will boost light
sweet supply to Asia in 2010.

exports by Energy Security Analysis Inc.,

Russian crude oil output is projected
to grow at an average rate of 0.3%/
year through 2020, bringing output to
nearly 10.2 million b/d.
The Russian government seeks to
increase throughput of domestic refineries, which would undermine future
crude exports. But there are reasons
to believe that by 2020 throughput
levels will actually decline. Based on
an analysis of foreign and Russian fuel
specifications, ESAI projects that lack of
investment to equip refineries to supply
quality products will force some Russian refiners to shut down. Russian oil
product exports, mostly high-sulfur fuel
oil and gas oil, will continue to become
less competitive in traditional foreign
markets.
European Union countries will continue to reduce Russian gas oil imports
as their regional deficit declines and
the availability of higher quality gas oil
from the US increases. If there is a proliferation of emissions control areas for
bunker fuel, exports of high-sulfur fuel
oil will also become less competitive.
Russia is slowly moving to improve
fuel quality on the domestic market,
which will also reduce the viability
of refineries that do not modernize.
Russian and Commonwealth of Independent States refineries consumed 5.5
million b/d of Russian crude in 2008.
ESAI presumes that number will fall to
4.6 million b/d in 2020, enabling Russia to export more
crude oil.

Russia will have on that market. ESPO
Blend may become an important
regional price benchmark. Buyers in
Asia, eager to have an alternative price
benchmark to Dubai, will support the
establishment of independent price discovery and the creation of a spot market
for ESPO Blend. Consequently, Russian exports to Asia may also influence
regional pricing.

flexibility in its export targets, reach
new markets, and expand economic
influence. Exports to Asia will soar
to at least 1.5 million b/d from less
than 400,000 b/d in 2008. In Europe,
growth of exports will be mainly associated with increased transit volumes
from Kazakhstan.
Russia’s growth of light sweet
production and the commingling of
growing volumes of light sweet from
Kazakhstan in the Russian export infrastructure will transform the quality of
crude exports, making Russia a key supplier of both light sweet and medium
sour qualities.

China, Petroecuador sign agreement on oil supply
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Ecuador’s state-owned Petroecuador,
eyeing an advance payment of $1 billion, has signed an agreement to sell 3
million bbl/month of oil to PetroChina
International Co. Ltd. over a 2-year
period.
Ecuador agreed to export 2.88 million bbl/month of Oriente and Napo
crude, with the $1 billion—representing 28% of the total value of the oil
PetroEcuador will export—serving as an
initial payment.
Altogether, the contract envisages
sales of 2.16 million bbl/month of Oriente crude and 720,000 bbl/month of
Napo crude, with a further option that
allows Petroecuador to deliver 5% more
or less than the stipulated amount.
Petroecuador said revenues from the
prepayment will be used for investment
in the oil industry and for public works.
The state firm also said the price of each
oil shipment will be decided according
to market conditions.
Diego Borja, Ecuador’s minister of
economic policy coordination, last
24

week said Ecuador had asked China not
to resell the oil to either Peru or Chile,
which already buy much of Ecuador’s
exported oil.
However, Borja said China has not
been restricted from selling the oil anywhere else, including California, long a
market for Ecuadoran crude.

China’s deals
The agreement is one of several in
recent months in which China has
extended loans in exchange for secure
supplies of crude oil. The country has
signed half a dozen such agreements
since February, for a total of $46 billion,
to secure long-term energy supplies.
Here are the recent agreements:
• Feb. 17—China Development Bank
(CDB) lends $15 billion to Russia’s
OAO Rosneft and $10 billion to OAO
Transneft in return for supplies from
East Siberian oil fields over 20 years.
• Feb. 18—CDB finalizes an agreement to extend a $10 billion line of
credit to Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) for 100,000-160,000 b/d of oil
to be sold at market prices.
• Feb. 21—China gives $4 billion

in financing to Venezuela’s Petroleos
de Venezuela SA, which has increased
shipments to China to reduce the country’s traditional reliance on sales to US
markets.
• Mar. 13—Angola confirms receiving another $1 billion loan from
Beijing, bringing its total to $5 billion
in oil-backed loans since 2002.
• Apr. 17—China National Petroleum Corp. enters into a $5 billion
financing deal with Kazakhstan’s KazMunaiGaz and also will jointly buy oil
company MangistauMunaiGas.

Favorable conditions
Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa
said that the negotiation with Petrochina will have favorable conditions for his
country and that the advance payment
will help to ease liquidity problems. In
a television interview, Correa said his
country experienced liquidity problems
in June and July after repurchasing 91%
of its 2012 and 2030 global bonds.
In addition to the $1 billion advance,
Quito is also negotiating with Beijing
on a separate $1 billion credit with a
4-year maturity.

While the financial terms of the agreement are considered generally favorable to Ecuador given its economic
circumstances, analyst BMI said “the country might yet
struggle to meet its supply obligations” since the agreement has taken Petroecuador’s contracted commitments to
nearly 100% of its output.
Ecuador, which is the fifth-largest producer of oil in
South America after Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia, produced 486,000 b/d of oil in May. Petroecuador produces 280,000 b/d, or just over half of Ecuador’s
total output of 485,000 b/d. ✦

A masterpiece

Oil companies slap Nigeria’s
petroleum reform legislation
Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
Nigeria’s Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) will substantially increase taxation for operators and discourage
investment, companies complained last month at a public
forum in Abuja.
The companies are unhappy that their contracts could
be renegotiated, particularly those covering deepwater
projects, with higher costs under the draft legislation that
would allow the government to seize blocks that remained unexplored.
The PIB has received first and second readings in the
Senate, but observers have alleged that different versions
have been circulated among the National Assembly and
other industry officials.
Minister of State for Petroleum Resources Odein Ajumogobia said that there was only one version of the PIB
before the National Assembly and that this one had been
approved by the Federal Executive Council.
Nigeria’s petroleum industry provides more than 80%
of the country’s federal revenues, and the PIB, which has
taken almost 10 years to reach this stage, has been touted
as major reform that would address funding shortfalls,
domestic gas shortages, and crippling fuel subsidies.

Legislation’s objectives
Stakeholders were invited to present comments at hearings organized by the Senate and House of Representatives, which are debating the bill.
The legislation aims to introduce transparency through
publication of all licenses, leases, and contracts, along
with payments to the government.
The PIB will create new regulatory agencies, simplify
the industry’s structure, and transform Nigerian National

N

o one in the oil and gas industry
is immune to extravagant allegations, as evidenced by one court case
after another. This time, China National Petroleum Corp. is the target.
CNPC helicopters visited camps of
the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias
de Colombia (FARC) to provide logistical and medical support, according to a former hostage who escaped
from the guerrillas.
The CNPC helicopters transported
“doctors, medicine, provisions, and
even guerrillas,” according to former
Sen. Oscar Tulio Lizcano, who was
kidnapped on Aug. 5, 2000, and
escaped in 2008.
Tulio Lizcaino told Spanish news
agency EFE that the CNPC helicopters visited FARC camps seven times
in 2006 “paradoxically, when the
area was under military siege and
President (Alvaro) Uribe’s democratic
security (policy) was in full force.”

ONGC Videsh Ltd. to acquire US oil
firm Ominex De Columbia and began
actively exploring the country with
helicopters in June that year.
That August, rebels of FARC’s rival,
the Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional
(ELN), kidnapped a helicopter pilot
and two local workers from CNPC’s
exploration unit, the Bureau of Geological Prospecting (BGP).

BGP targeted

It marked the second time that
BGP contract workers had been kidnapped since the company began exploring for oil in Colombia earlier in
the year. In June 2006, FARC rebels
kidnapped two other BGP workers.
Did CNPC do a helicopter deal
with FARC in order to keep exploring
for oil? Or is Tulio Lizcaino making
unfounded allegations?
Western firms have long had to

Petroleum Corp. (NNPC) into an international oil company on a model similar to those of Petrobras or StatoilHydro
(OGJ Online, May 6, 2009). Oil workers, however, have raised fears about
whether their employment contracts
would be changed under these new arrangements and what would happen if
they lost jobs.
NNPC, which suffers from conflicting interests because it has operating, national assets management, and
regulatory roles, has been unable to
meet its financial obligations under
joint ventures with foreign companies.
In its new structure, Nigerian National
Petroleum Co. Ltd. would be able to
raise money in markets rather than rely
on the government for funding.
According to the PIB, NNPC’s joint
ventures with Royal Dutch Shell PLC,
Total SA, Chevron Corp., and ExxonMobil Corp. would be transformed into
independent companies led by a new
management team. But there are worries about who would manage them,
how these firms would function, and
how profits would be used.
Operators have welcomed the benefits of reform but urged the government to consider the effects on present
and future work programs. International oil companies (IOCs) said in a
joint presentation that their returns
on investment would fall to below 8%
from more than 15% if the bill passed.
Shell Nigeria Managing Director Mutiu Sunmonu said gas exploration in the
country would become uneconomic.
“The existing fiscal legislation recognizes the fundamental difference between
oil and gas, but the proposed PIB treats
oil and gas fiscals equally, making all gas
projects uneconomic,” he said.
The IOCs noted that the new law
would affect returns on wet gas investments, leaving 65% of new gas production at risk.
They raised concerns about the fiscal
terms for their joint ventures with the
introduction of a multiplicity of taxes.
The Indigenous and Marginal Field
Operators’ group demanded that the
fiscal regime be changed to recognize

Gas hydrate assessment needed, House panel told
Nick Snow
OGJ Washington Editor
Natural gas hydrates are a potentially
significant energy source, but more
work needs to be done to determine
if they can be economically produced,
three experts told a US House subcommittee late last month.
“Estimates from the US Geological Survey peg the amount of gas in
hydrate form in the US to be more than
200,000 tcf. That sounds large by itself
but is even more impressive when the
total amount of conventional natural
gas in the US is estimated to be around
1,700 tcf,” said US Rep. Jim Costa (DCalif.), chairman of the House Energy
28

and Natural Resources Committee’s
Energy and Mineral Resources Committee, in opening statement at the subcommittee’s second 2009 hearing on
unconventional fuels, which focused on
gas hydrates.
USGS made the first systematic assessment of US in-place gas hydrate
resources in 1995 and found that the
amount of gas in those accumulations
was estimated to greatly exceed known
conventional gas resources volumes,
according to the first witness, Timothy
S. Collett, a research geologist in the
US Department of the Interior agency.
However, gas hydrates represent both
a scientific and technologic challenge,
and much remains to be learned about

their characteristics, he said.
While a huge amount of gas apparently is stored in hydrates and its
production is technically feasible with
existing technology, production of gas
from hydrates also potentially could
create hazards associated with seabed
stability and release of methane into the
oceans and atmosphere, Collett said.
The National Energy Technology
Laboratory in the US Department of Energy’s Fossil Fuels Office has researched
gas hydrates since 2000, reported a
second witness, Ray Boswell, an NETL
senior energy advisor.

relatively recent recognition that gas
hydrates represent a significant global
storehouse of methane, a fact with farreach implications for the environment
and for the nation’s, and the world’s future energy supplies,” he said. DOE has
begun a series of field and modeling
studies of gas hydrates’ links to climate
and carbon cycling, which it hopes will
show the role gas hydrates could play in
climate change, Boswell said.
Primary field efforts in DOE’s
research program have confirmed accumulations of the most promising gas
hydrate resource targets, he continued.
“We continue to prepare for the next
stage of research and development,
which will include extended testing of
alternative production methods, as well
as comprehensive resource confirmation and sample collection,” he said.
But a third witness suggested that
gas hydrate wells will be more complex
than most conventional and unconventional gas wells. Steven H. Hancock,
well engineering manager at RPS Energy
Canada, said that technical challenges
include maintaining commercial gas
flows with high water production rates,
operating with low temperatures and
low pressures in the well bore, controlling formation sand production into the
wellbore, and ensuring well structural
integrity with reservoir subsidence.
“Technologies exist to address all of
these issues, but they will add to development costs. Gas hydrate production
also has one distinct challenge compared to other unconventional resources, and that is the high cost of transportation to market,” Hancock said.
Collett said that while USGS’s 1995
study found US in-place gas hydrate
resources ranging from 113,000 to
676,000 tcf, an evaluation of technically recoverable amounts in 2008
found an estimated 25.2-157.8 tcf on
Alaska’s North Slope. That same year, the
USGS official continued, the US Minerals Management Service assessed gas
hydrate resources in the Gulf of Mexico
and found a mean volume estimate of
21,436 tcf.

Uinta basin’s
air assessed

A

new air quality study of eastern
Utah’s Uinta basin was released
on July 31, not by a government
agency or academic researchers but
by the Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States.
IPAMS released the Uinta Basin Air
Quality Study (UBAQS) by Environ
Corp. a week after the US Department of Justice and Environmental
Protection Agency announced that
Colorado Interstate Gas Co. resolved
federal air pollution charges involving its operations on the Uinta-Ouray
Indian Reservation.
The settlement was 2009’s fourth
involving the oil and gas industry in
the area. Six independent producers settled three federal air pollution
complaints on the reservation on Apr.
17. The timing of IPAMS’s release of
the 394-page study was coincidental,
an association officials told me. “We
started this project in the summer of
2007. It took us about a year and a
half to do the study,” said Kathleen

director.
“We noticed there was a lack of
data, and UBAQS provides comprehensive regional analysis of air

standards through 2012.
It used conservative modeling assumptions which overstated impacts
from oil and gas activities to provide public land regulators with a
worst-case scenario. Even with that
scenario, UBAQS results showed that
the basin would satisfy air quality
standards, IPAMS said.
“It’s unprecedented. I don’t think
there’s another comprehensive, basinwide study that has been conducted
anywhere else in the West,” Sgamma
said.

Better understanding

IPAMS hopes the study will help
regulators understand the cumulative
impacts of producers’ activities, she
said. “It’s going to take government
agencies some time to digest this.
Obviously, they’ll want to make sure
that they understand the results and
the scientific basis is sound,” she said.
“But it was done with the input of
all managing governmental agencies
by a respected third-party contractor
with a stellar reputation and an interest in making sure it was a scientific
study,” Sgamma continued.
The study’s executive summary
suggests that these results should not

‘Not created equal’
“A key development in gas hydrates
research in recent years is the realization, based on the findings of a series
of recent scientific drilling programs
around the world, that all gas hydrates
accumulations are not created equal,”
Boswell said in his written testimony.
“They range from large, diffuse accumulations in clay sediments to small,
discrete, high-concentration accumulations in sand reservoirs. They occur
both on the sea floor as solid massive
mounds, as well as buried several thousands of feet below the sea floor.”
Hancock said that stand-alone
developments could be economic for
onshore gas hydrate production with a
gas price in the upper range of historic
North American prices. For deepwater
gas hydrates, developments could be
economic with a gas price in the upper
range of what India has paid for LNG
imports on the spot market, he said in
his written statement.
“As with all hydrocarbon developments, the economics of gas hydrates
will be highly variable, depending
upon such factors as well performance,
sediment type, gas-in-place, thermodynamic conditions of a reservoir and access to existing infrastructure,” he told

T E R E S T
the subcommittee. “It is also clear that
comparable conventional gas reservoirs
will be economically more attractive than gas hydrate-only reservoirs,
suggesting that the production of gas
hydrates on a large commercial scale
may be delayed.”
Collett said that the arrival at a technically recoverable estimate of US gas
hydrate resources in 2008 was significant. “We have focused on concentrated
reservoirs recently to work on resources
which are more likely to be produced,”
he said.
The witnesses agreed that US gas
hydrate production will likely occur
first in Alaska. “The next big step is to
conduct an extended production test.
We are working with BP, ExxonMobil,
and ConocoPhillips to do that, and we
expect it to take a year,” Boswell said.
“From an engineering standpoint,
the next step will be to prove we can
produce commercial amounts of gas
from hydrates with technologies we
have. We think we can,” said Hancock.
“In economic terms, each gas hydrate
field is unique and will rise or fall based
on its own characteristics. The price is
only a few dollars more than conventional production, but as average prices
rise, other unconventional sources
become competitive too.” ✦

Timothy F. Geithner expressed on July

reform proposals.

OTC derivatives

These included regulation of OTC
derivative dealers, exchanges, and clearinghouses; mandatory clearing of OTC
derivatives with a few exceptions; and
stronger capital and margin requirements to strongly encourage dealers
and customers to trade on regulated
exchanges or have transactions cleared
wherever possible.

The second approach, which the
paper said is designed to enhance
speculative position oversight, would
require OTC derivatives dealers, investment advisors managing more than
$100 million, and other entities that are
deemed major market participants to
report all short interests in CDS contracts to the appropriate regulator. To
prevent abuse, regulators would have
authority to impose position limits and
to ban the purchase of credit protection
using CDSs by any nondealer which is
not hedging a risk.
Peterson and Frank also proposed
in their paper protecting US financial
institutions from lesser regulatory regimes in other countries by having US
regulators coordinate with their foreign
counterparts to harmonize OTC derivative market regulation, including establishing international standards covering

clearinghouses. The US Department of
the Treasury would be authorized to
restrict access to the US banking system
for institutions of any jurisdiction the
US Treasury determines permits lower
capital-related standards or promotes
reckless market activity.
The concept paper suggested that
members of the two committees will be
asked to determine whether the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the
CFTC, or both should regulate an OTC
derivative dealer, exchange, or clearinghouse. A financial services oversight
council would be established to resolve
disputes between the two agencies
within 180 days regarding authority
over new products or joint regulation of
derivatives products.

exchange traders of West Texas Intermediate crude oil contracts in its weekly
Commitments of Traders (COT) reports.
It said that the first publication of this
data will be in the July 28 COT report,
to be released on July 31.
US Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.),
who has frequently criticized the
agency for not moving to regulate foreign exchanges’ commodities trading in
the US, said that the CFTC needs to do
more. “It needs to realize that it is the
regulator and fully regulate the dark ICE
market,” she said on July 30. “Oil prices
are far too high and apparently have
been driven by unchecked speculation,
according to the new CFTC. So I hope it
will act to bring ICE into total compliance.” ✦

MMS data on OCS safety
highlight the risks of lifting
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
US Minerals Management Service statistics show a total
of 2,724 safety incidents were reported during 2005-08 on
the Outer Continental Shelf, of which 506 incidents involved
lifting operations.
MMS spokesmen outlined the statistics during an Offshore
Safe Lifting Conference last month in Houston sponsored by
the American Petroleum Institute.
Phil Smith, manager of regulatory affairs for Shell Exploration & Production Co., helped organize the conference.
“Lifting operations offshore do not come without risk,”
Smith said. “It is one of the most dangerous things we do.
We have to move heavy things around in difficult conditions.”
Joe Levine, senior engineer with the MMS office in
Herndon, Va., said that 351 lifting incidents stemmed from
production activities, while 155 incidents stemmed from
drilling activities.
These figures came from information that companies
reported to the MMS for 2005-08.
Cranes were involved in 411 of the 506 total lifting incidents, while devices other than a crane accounted for the
rest. Levine said devices other than a crane include air hoists,
tuggers, winches, chainfalls, and come-a-longs.
During 2005-08, 1,128 injuries were reported on the
OCS, of which 153 were lifting injuries. Of the lifting injuries, 105 were associated with cranes, and 48 were associated
with other lifting devices.
Thirty fatalities were reported on the OCS, of which
13.3% were associated with lifting. There were two fatalities associated with cranes and two fatalities associated with
other lifting devices, Levine said.
Consequently, MMS issued 337 total lifting incidents of
noncompliance (INCs). MMS issues an INC to an operator
upon identifying an infraction from an approved permit,
plan, or regulation.
Ninety of the INCs were associated with slings either not
correctly identified or improperly stored when not in use.
Other common lifting INCs issued by the agency included:
• The crane not being taken out of service when deficiencies were known or failure to restrict the crane’s activities to
eliminate unsafe conditions.
• Repairs or replacements of critical components not being made promptly.
• Not having an annual inspection performed by qualified
inspectors with records readily available for 4 years. ✦

The Mexican Competitiveness Institute, known by its acronym IMCO,
released in mid-July its 2009 report on
the state of the Mexican economy.
Patterned after the Global Competitiveness Report issued by the World
Economic Forum (WEF), the Mexican
report examined a diverse set of 137
variables and chose 48 countries where
a useful comparison with Mexico might
be made. In
the statistical appendix,
these countries
are scored in
relation to
some 70 variables.
The variables are as diverse as “Liberalization of energy policy”—where,
alone among all countries, Mexico (using 2007 data for all variables) scored
a zero (0)—to “Talent”—where the
variable refers to the ability of a country
to produce and attract globally competitive skills—Mexico scored 38.8 on a
scale of 100.
When it came to recommendations
regarding oil policy, two were offered:
the upstream should be opened to competition from private investment, and
the restrictions on payments to Petroleos Mexicanos SA contractors should
be liberalized.
“Energy reform that permits competition in the exploration and extraction
of oil and gas, as well as in the liberalization of the regulation of the energy
sector, is what all countries have done
who are oil producers”—except for
Mexico, the report adds.

on July 22, 2008.
Both in the report, and in off-line
discussions with IMCO officials, the
two countries that are recommended
as ones that Mexico should emulate in
upstream policy are Brazil and Norway.
The report says little about Mexico’s
institutional, legal, and political readiness to carry out such reforms even on
paper—to say nothing of putting them
into practice.
How prepared is Mexico to undergo
the chemotherapy, as it were, of an
upstream liberalization in a body politic
that suffers from the cancerous growths
of 70 years of a government monopoly?
And what clues—if any—are to be
found in the voluminous statistics about
how Brazil and Norway were ready for
an upstream opening?
As a matter of curiosity, we also
wanted to see how a few other countries, some oil producers, others not,
scored on the same variables.
We want to see if any of the data
suggest insights as to how both Norway
and Brazil have world-class national
oil companies that operate in deepwater environments, while Mexico has a
regional-class national oil company that
operates in shallow water (and, for decades, has been the world’s top offshore
oil producer).

Reform discussions
For most of 2008 Mexico was the
battleground of ideas, proposals, and
back-room negotiations regarding the
reform of the oil sector.
What came out when a reform package was finally passed by congress in
October 2008 was one in which a new
Pemex Law created a stronger system of
corporate governance, including four
independent board members, plus the
flexibility to devise new contractual
models that fit the special needs for
the oil industry. Of special concern in
Pemex was the need to be able to incorporate new technology and innovations
in management and field operations,
especially in the upstream.

The reform package also had the intent of strengthening the government’s
ability to guide and monitor Pemex and
the oil industry more broadly speaking.
We then looked at the data sets to see
what could be learned about government effectiveness, corporate governance, and innovation, areas of special
concern in the upstream.

Other comparisons
Looking at the data compiled by
IMCO that bear on government effectiveness, we selected five oil producers,
noted their individual scores across
nine variables, then took the average of
the oil companies and compared those
scores with Mexico’s.

Regarding the quality of regulation, IMCO gave Mexico a score of
56, Brazil 44, and Norway 89, but
something here is also not right: Brazil
has an upstream regulator that makes
international tenders practically, legally,
and philosophically workable; Mexico,
however, has none.
Regarding the variable concerning
liberalization of the energy sector, all
countries under review scored 100,
except China which scored 66.7 and
Mexico, which, as mentioned, scored 0
(Table 1).
Turning to the WEF dataset, a promising variable concerns the efficacy of
corporate boards. Here we find that
Mexico’s ranking is 82 of 134, while

those of Brazil, Norway, and the US are
42, 9, and 12, respectively. In terms of
percentile rankings, Mexico ranked in
the 39th percentile, while Brazil was in
the 69th and Norway and the US above
the 90th (Table 2).
Looking at innovation, the WEF offers seven variables, including a general
one for capacity for innovation, where
Mexico was ranked 67th out of 134,
Brazil 27th, Norway 13th, and the US
6th. Here we start to see Brazil pulling
away from Mexico as would be expected by the upstream performance of the
two national oil companies.
Taking the average of the variables
for innovation, Mexico would be
ranked 81st, Brazil 50th, Norway 18th,
and the US 3rd. The more telling,
nonparametric statistic is the percentile rankings: Mexico ranks in the 40th
percentile, while Brazil is in the 63rd,
Norway the 87th, and the US the 98th

Alaska
Rampart Energy Co., Denver, is
drilling an exploratory test in interior
Alaska’s Nenana basin.
The well on the Nunivak prospect
3 miles west of Nenana and 55 miles
southwest of Fairbanks is projected to
about 12,000 ft. Drilling and testing are
to be completed by September 2009.
Rampart said the well is part of a
regional, multiyear onshore oil and gas
exploration drilling program in the
summer months.

Utah
Pacific Energy & Mining Co., Reno,
Nev., signed a farmout agreement with
Mar/Reg Oil Co. for the drilling of a
horizontal leg in an existing well in Tin
Cup Mesa oil field, San Juan County,
Utah.
The field, discovered in 1981 by
Marathon Oil Co. in the Paradox basin
21 miles southeast of Blanding, has
produced more than 2.6 million bbl of
oil and 3 bcf of gas from a 120-ft thick
carbonate buildup in the Pennsylvanian
Upper Ismay formation.
PEMC plans to spud a 2,500-ft

second half of August 2009. Geological and engineering analysis indicates
that a horizontal well drilled in Sec. 26
would intersect the fracture system that
has not been drained by the vertically
drilled wells.
The vertical 4-26 well has produced
more than 156,000 bbl of oil and 355
MMcf of gas, and engineering analysis
shows it did not efficiently drain the
northern part of the oil field.

Many oil and gas
development projects
remain on schedule, but
companies also have deferred many projects so
that start-up and compleProduction
tion dates have become
less certain.
The accompanying table lists projects
in 45 countries that may proceed.
Expected peak production from these
projects will occur
in 2009 or after.
If all the projects’ peak production rates occurred
in the same year,
world production capacity would increase by 30 million b/d of liquids and
70.5 bcfd of gas.
The list includes both individual
fields and in some cases, the accompanying infrastructure. Listed are:
• Discoveries that have announced

• Heavy-oil projects that may
include new infrastructure such as pipelines, crude oil upgraders, and mines.
• Deepwater projects, some of
which rely on long flowline tiebacks
and hub facilities.
• Unconventional resources such
as tight sands, shale gas, and coalbed
methane.
Although joint ventures operate
some projects listed in the table, for
simplification, the table only lists the
name of one company in each joint
venture (see accompanying table listing
the parent companies’ full names).
The year shown in the project list
reflects when production may peak or
enter a peak production plateau that
could last for several years. The + after
the year indicates that the year of peak
production is uncertain and may occur
later than the year shown.

Asia-Paciﬁc

LNG projects continue to dominate
the Asia-Pacific region with Australia
having several.
Greater Gorgon will develop fields
containing about 40 tcf of gas. The proposed Gorgon project will have three
5-million tonne/year LNG trains on
Barrow Island and will also supply gas
to the domestic market. The project also
Major Upstream Projects
involves reinjection and sequestration of
carbon dioxide on Barrow Island. Gorgon may start shipping LNG in 2014.
Development of the Sunrise and
Troubadour projects off East Timor and
Australia remain in the planning stages.
The projects would involve development of about 8 tcf of gas that an
expansion of the Bayu Udan LNG plant
at Darwin would process.

Western Europe
The UK and Norway offshore holds
the main fields under development in
Western Europe. Most of these fields
are small and will tie into the extensive
existing infrastructure in the area.
In Italy, the onshore Tempa Rossa
project will develop an estimated 200
million bbl of heavy oil reserves.

Eastern Europe, FSU

Petrobras, in September 2008, started a long-term production test of a subsea completed presalt well in
the Jubarte field, off Brazil.The presalt 30° oil flows to the P-34 floating production, storage, and offloading vessel that also processes production from wells completed in a Jubarte heavy oil reservoir above
the salt layer. Photo from Petrobras.
develop 14 tcf gas and 37 million bbl of
condensate from Torosa, Brechnock, and
Calliance fields.
In Indonesia, several new fields will
supply gas to existing and new LNG
plants and power stations. The largest
new LNG project is Tangguh that started
shipping LNG in June of this year. The
gas is from fields in Papua Bintuni Bay.
Indonesia's largest new oil development is Banyu Urip field in the Cepu
block on Java. The field may go on
stream in August at an initial 15,00020,000 bo/d. The project includes a
floating storage vessel moored off Tuban
in the Java Sea for oil export.
Development of Natuna D-Alpha
field in South China Sea remains in question because
ExxonMobil Corp. and the
government of Indonesia
failed to reach an agreement on the project. The
field, discovered several
decades ago, contains about
40 tcf of gas. Complicating field development is
the large amount of carbon
dioxide present in the gas.
India has both onshore
oil and gas discoveries. The
40

gas off the eastern coast will be produced through subsea-completed wells
brought ashore with long flowlines.
New projects will develop fields off
China in both the South China Sea and
Bohai Bay.
Development of gas fields in the
Southern Highlands of Papua New
Guinea includes construction of a 960
MMcfd gas conditioning plant and a
440-mile gas pipeline to a new 6.3
million tonnes/year, two-train LNG
liquefaction and storage facility near
Port Moresby. The gas would come
from Hides, Angore, Juha, Gobe, Moran, and Kutubu fields.

Major Upstream Projects

Phased development of Tengiz field,
in Kazakhstan, continues with a $9.5
expansion project that will increase oil
production by 260,000 b/d after 2010.
Also in Kazakhstan, an expansion of Karachaganak field will increase production by 1.6 bcfd in 2012.
Because of delays, the first phase of
the 13-billion-bbl Kashagan field, off
Kazakhstan, is now slated to start producing after 2012. With future phases,
the field's production may surpass 1
million b/d.
The largest proposed development
in Russia is the 130-tcf Shtockman
field in the Barents Sea. The first phase
of Shtockman may start producing gas
in 2013 at 2.4 bcfd with LNG exports
starting in 2014. Subsequent phases
may increase production to 8.7 bcfd.
The 70-tcf Kovykta is another large
field under development in eastern Russia. Gazprom now operates the field that
will require new pipelines for moving
the gas to potential users, such as in
China.

Middle East
Iran continues to develop light and
heavy oil resources, including the phased development of offshore South Pars
gas field, which is an extension of Qatar's giant North
field.
International oil companies largely rejected Iraq's
terms for developing its
many oil fields with only
BP PLC and China's CNPC
International Ltd. accepting a $2/bbl agreement to
work in Rumaila oil field,

which has reserves of 17.7 billion bbl
of oil. The table lists some potential
fields that might be developed to allow
Iraq in the next 5 years to increase oil
production to 4 million b/d from the
current 2.4 million b/d.
Kuwait continues to redevelop several fields that will increase its production capacity by 450,000 bo/d in 2012.
In Oman, several enhanced oil recovery projects are planned for several
fields. The main processes include steam
injection and sour-gas injection.
Phased development of 900-tcf
North field off Qatar continues with
additional LNG trains and a GTL plant.
Saudi Arabia is adding production
capacity, such as the Khurais expansion
with a designed 1.2 million bo/d peak
production capacity.
ADCO in Abu Dhabi is expanding
production capacity in various fields
by 560,000 b/d. Also ExxonMobil is
involved in the Upper Zakum redevelopment that will increase production by
about 250,000 b/d from the field.
ConocoPhillips is also involved in
developing the Shah sour gas field in
Abu Dhabi.

Africa
Activity levels remain high in
deepwater Angola and Nigeria. Projects
mostly involve installation of floating
production, storage, and offloading
(FPSO) vessels and subsea wells.
Also being built in Angola is a onetrain LNG plant that will receive associated as well as nonassociated gas.
Nigeria also has several new LNG
projects that will monetize primarily
associated gas, some of which is now
flared.
Jubilee is a 300 million bbl deepwater development off Ghana. Production will flow to a leased FPSO that can
process 120,000 bo/d

Western Hemisphere
Petrobras, besides its phased development of several giant fields in
the Campos basin, also has substantial
discoveries in the deeper presalt layer
in both the Santos and Campos basins.

Although companies have deferred,
many Canadian oil sands projects, most
likely will be developed but timing is
uncertain. In its June report on Alberta's 2008 reserves and supply-demand
outlook for 2009-18, Alberta's Energy
Resources Conservation Board lowered
its forecast of bitumen production to
2.7 million b/d in 2018. Last year's
report showed production reaching

oil sands.
Operators and the Canadian government are still negotiating an agreement
for the proposed $6-billion (Can.),
760-mile Mackenzie Delta pipeline
that would allow for producing the
large stranded gas resources in the
Northwest Territories. First gas seems
farther off and production may not be
realized until later in the decade. The
large amounts of unconventional gas
discovered in the US and British Colombia have lessened the importance of
developing Northwest Territory gas.
The large unconventional gas
discoveries also may delay construction of a gas pipeline from the Alaska
North Slope, with its estimated 40 tcf of
stranded gas.
The undelineated projects in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska
may contain an estimated 10 billion
bbl. These prospects could produce up 1
million bo/d if the US congress allows
drilling in ANWR.
Deepwater developments in the Gulf
of Mexico will continue to add substantial new production capacity. Chevron’s
Tahiti, Shell's Perdido, and BHP's Shenzi
are three of the largest deepwater fields
to start producing in 2009.
Technological advances as well as
higher gas prices have made feasible
many tight gas, shale gas, and coalbed
gas developments, such as the Piceance
tight-gas projects in Colorado, the coalbed methane in the San Juan basin, and
the Barnett shales of Texas.
Venezuela has many potential development projects, but its government's
actions have created uncertainty as to
their completion. ✦

O C E S S I N G
In the last 15 years,
overall crude oil imports
to the US have grown
at 3%/year. During this
time, the sources of
these imports and their
Refining
proportional shares have
changed significantly,
with a corresponding movement toward crudes that are heavier and more
sour in average
quality.
The steady
growth in crude
oil imports to the
US from Canada
has been accompanied by significant investments in oil sands production in Canada, development of pipeline
infrastructure to transport these crudes
to the US, and refinery expansions in
the US to enable processing of heavy
crudes. These modifications to refining
infrastructure, which result in increased
requirements for hydrogen, steam, and
power, are opportunities for gasification
and cogeneration projects.

Changing US crude imports
are driving reﬁnery upgrades

This article discusses historical
trends in US crude oil imports with an
emphasis on synthetic Canadian heavy
crudes and examines their impact on
the configuration and profitability of US
refineries.

Import trends
Since 1994, imports of foreign crude
oil to the US have consistently exceeded
its domestic oil production with a rapidly increasing margin (Fig. 1). A study
of data compiled by the US Energy
Information Administration shows that
during this period, imports of foreign
crude oil have increased at 3%/year
to more than 10 million b/d in 2007
from 7 million b/d in 1994.1
This timeframe has also seen the
steady rise of Canada to the largest
country of origin for imported crude
oil to the US in 2007 (19% of total
imports) from the third largest in 1994
(14%).2 EIA data also show that the
imports from such other large suppliers as Saudi Arabia and Venezuela have
stayed relatively flat during this period,
while imports of North Sea crude have
decreased steadily.
Since 2000, crude oil imports from
Nigeria have been on the rise, while
imports from Mexico peaked in 2004
and have begun trending down since.
These trends underlie a remarkable
growth in the share of total crude imports: The US imported about 66% of
its crude feedstock in 2007 in contrast
to about 25% in the mid-1980s.3
These trends in the quantity and
origin of imported crude oil to the
US have been accompanied by a trend
of deteriorating quality of the crude
oil processed in US refineries (Fig. 2),
namely toward heavier crude oil with
a greater sulfur content. This trend is
expected to continue due to the decreasing availability of light sweet crude
and the relative price discount for heavy
sour crudes.
According to EIA, the average sulfur
content of imported crude to the US
1985-2005 increased to 1.4% sulfur from 0.9%, while the average API
gravity has declined to 30.2° API from

Infrastructure developments
Imported crude to the US arrives
predominantly by crude oil tankers to
various locations along the Gulf Coast
and the East and West coasts. The US
Gulf Coast currently receives about 55%
of US crude oil imports, the majority of
which is processed in Gulf Coast refineries, while the remainder moves inland
to distribution hubs via the Seaway and
Capline crude pipelines.
Crude oil imports via tanker to the
East and West coasts are generally intended for regional refinery consumption and represent about 12% and 10%,
respectively, of total US imports (or
about 1 million b/d each). The remaining US crude imports are mainly from
Canada, which currently accounts for
about 1.9 million b/d delivered to the
upper Midwest and north central US by

32.5° API as heavier crudes have been
imported.4 Processing the increasing
quantity and decreasing quality of imported crude oil while meeting increasingly stringent specifications on the
allowable sulfur content in gasoline and
diesel fuel has wrought modifications
to US crude oil refining infrastructure
over these years.
In 2004, Canada overtook Saudi
Arabia to become the largest exporter of
crude oil to the US and has consistently
strengthened its position since.5 US
imports of crude oil from Canada for
2007 totaled 1.9 million b/d and have
increased at 5%/year since 2000.6
Supporting this trend are large project investments in Alberta to increase
production of oil sands-derived heavy
crude (including bitumen blends),
development of pipeline infrastructure
to transport these crudes to the US,
and investments in refinery projects in
the US Midwest to process oil sandsderived heavy crude.
Reduced credit availability, however,
increasing market uncertainty, and
oil price volatility due to the current
economic downturn have temporarily slowed development of current and
proposed Canadian heavy crude and
downstream refining projects.

Fig. 3 shows the average crude oil
import flows in 2007 to US Petroleum
Administration for Defense Districts and
highlights the major countries of origin
of the imported crude.
A predominant trend in the recent
decade with respect to crude oil imports into the US has been the growth
in supply of heavy Canadian crude, in
particular from the oil sands region
in the western province of Alberta. In
addition to investment in upstream
production and downstream processing
of heavy Canadian crude oil and bitumen blends, several projects are under
way further to expand existing pipeline
infrastructure. The softening of market
demand due to the current economic
downturn has temporarily moderated
the need for additional pipeline capacity
beyond the existing projects.
The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers annually provides
a detailed overview of existing and
planned pipeline infrastructure to
transport heavy Canadian crude to US
refining markets.7 According to the
2009 CAPP market update,8 around 1.7
million b/d of crude oil from Western
Canada moved to US refineries in 2008

via three major pipeline systems: the
Enbridge system and Kinder Morgan’s
Express and Trans Mountain pipelines.
The largest among these pipelines,
the Enbridge system, has an estimated
crude capacity of 1.9 million b/d
(1.2 million b/d heavy crude) and a
trunkline that runs from Edmonton
to Chicago in the US Midwest.7 Additional segments in the Enbridge system
deliver crude to Cushing, Okla., Patoka,
Ill., and Ontario. In March 2006, the
66,000 b/d ExxonMobil-Enbridge
Pegasus pipeline was reversed, connecting Patoka to Nederland, Tex., thereby
providing Canadian heavy oil producers
access to the US Gulf Coast market.7
Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain
pipeline runs west from Edmonton and
delivers predominantly light Canadian
crude to refineries near Burnaby in Canada and the state of Washington, while
its Express pipeline transports Canadian
heavy crude from Hardisty, Alta., south
to refineries in the US mountain states
of Montana, Wyoming, and Utah.
The lines have estimated crude
capacities of 280,000 b/d and 300,000
b/d, respectively, for a total crude capacity of nearly 580,000 b/d.

connects with the Platte pipeline that
runs due east to Wood River, Ill.7 The
existing pipeline infrastructure for Canadian crude, including those discussed
thus far, appear in Fig. 4 as solid black
lines.
Several projects have been proposed
and are under way to expand the distribution of heavy Canadian crude further
in the US, with an estimated 1 million
b/d of pipeline capacity anticipated by
2011.7
Key projects include construction of
TransCanada’s 435,000 b/d Keystone
line from Hardisty to Wood River and
Patoka by 2010, with a subsequent
extension to the US Gulf Coast by 2013.
A major expansion of Enbridge’s main
trunkline, the Alberta Clipper project, is
under way from Edmonton to Superior,
Wisc., as well as an extension southwards from Superior to Flanagan, Ill.,
which is labeled the Southern Access
Expansion and Extension project.
Extensions of the Enbridge system
to the US East Coast and to the US Gulf
52

Coast have also been proposed, the
latter delayed by a short-term outlook
for oil sands development due to rising
costs and regulatory delays. Enbridge
has proposed an interim project to
reverse its pipeline sections between
Portland, Me., and Sarnia, Ont., which
would enable shipment of Canadian
heavy crude oil down the US Atlantic
Coast to the US Gulf Coast.9 Discussions
are ongoing about the timing and market viability of the proposed project.
Enbridge also has a project under
way to transport diluent from Flanagan
to Edmonton in order to address the
demand for condensate among Canadian heavy crude producers.7 Ongoing
and proposed Canadian crude pipeline
projects appear as dashed blue lines in
Fig. 4.
In August 2008, Enterprise Products Partners LP, TEPPCO Partners LP,
and Oiltanking Holdings Americas Inc.
announced a joint venture to develop
a massive offshore crude oil receiving
terminal labeled the Texas Offshore Port

System (TOPS) in order to meet increasing demand for US crude imports,
in particular at regional Gulf Coast
refineries of which some are slated for
major expansions.
In April 2009, Enterprise and TEPPCO announced their dissociation from
the project citing disagreements with
Oiltanking.10 Despite this development,
Oiltanking remains interested in developing the proposed terminal, which has
an anticipated capacity of 1.5 million
b/d of crude (nearly 15% of current US
crude oil imports) and was scheduled
to start up in late 2010.
In January 2008, Sempra announced
plans to develop a 500,000-b/d marine
terminal near Port Arthur, Tex., for
crude oil, LPG, and refined products.11
In October 2008, Valero signed a
memorandum of understanding with
Sempra with the intention of becoming a major recipient of crude oil at
the proposed terminal and also to assist
with marketing efforts to third parties

the terminal.12
These announcements, as well as the
ongoing expansions of Canadian heavy
crude pipelines, underscore the increasing US dependency on foreign crude
oil and represent essential infrastructure developments that are needed to
keep pace with the anticipated longterm growth in demand for crude oil
imports.

Effects on US reﬁning
The steady increase in crude oil
prices between 2000 and mid-2008
has been a key demand driver for the
increased use of heavy Canadian crude
and bitumen blends in US refineries, as

refiners sought to take advantage of the
substantial price differentials between
heavy and light crude oils. With the
increasing emphasis in the US on the
security of energy supply, the stable political relations with Canada have served
to support this trend.
Increasing investment in production
in the oil sands region and pipeline
infrastructure to transport Canadian
heavy crude to the US Midwest has
been accompanied by announcements
of refinery expansion projects in the
US Midwest to process heavy Canadian
bitumen blends. These projects include
Marathon’s Detroit refinery (80,000
b/d heavy oil processing capacity

after expansion),13 BP’s Whiting, Ind.,
refinery (260,000 b/d heavy oil),14 and
ConocoPhillips’s refineries in Borger,
Tex., and Wood River (total of 550,000
b/d heavy oil consisting of 275,000
b/d bitumen).15 While these projects
are still under way, a few have been
scheduled for a later completion in
response to current market conditions.
In 2007, Husky Energy, a Canadian
energy company and oil sands producer, purchased Valero’s Lima, Ohio,
refinery with the intention of ultimately modifying it for heavy Canadian
crude.16 In December 2007, Husky Energy also announced an alliance with BP
that included a retrofit of BP’s Toledo,

construction of a new hydrocracking
reactor (unless spare hydrocracking
capacity is available), which also gives
the refinery more operating flexibility
with regard to production of distillate
vs. gasoline. Fig. 5 provides a simplified
overview of the typical refinery configuration changes that can be expected
when the delayed coking route to bitumen upgrading is selected.
In the resid hydroprocessing approach, the heavy vacuum residuum is
typically upgraded in two steps: a severe
hydrocracking step in an ebullated bed
that cracks the residuum into lighter
fractions, and a hydrotreating step that
reduces the sulfur and nitrogen to acceptable levels.
The resid hydroprocessing bottoms are typically sent to a solvent
deasphalting unit to remove insoluble
asphaltenes. The asphaltenes stream is
typically not conducive to further refinery processing and is either sold as or
blended into low-end refined products
or ideally gasified to produce hydrogen,
steam and power for refinery use. The
gasification option is especially attractive due to the significant hydrogen
requirements for resid hydroprocessing as well as for desulfurization of the
refined product streams and is discussed
later in this article.
The resid hydroprocessing route
has been chosen for upgrader projects
in Alberta, but it is yet to be selected
for bitumen upgrading in US refinery
projects.
Refinery units that are typically added or expanded as a part of a refinery
expansion project in order to enable the
processing of heavy Canadian crude are:
• Diluent recovery unit.
• Crude and vacuum units.
• Delayed coker.
• Hydrocracker.
• Hydrogen plant(s).
• Distillate hydrotreater.
• Naphtha hydrotreater.
• Sulfur plant.
The addition and expansion of these
units will result in an increase in the
Nelson’s complexity index for the refinery, which is a measure of its ability to

hazardous-waste management activity,24
while in April 2009 EPA proposed a
new rule for mandatory greenhouse gas
reporting.21
Gasification is the chemical conversion of any carbonaceous fuel into a
mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen known as synthesis gas through
an exothermic reaction of the fuel with
oxygen or steam at elevated temperature.
Additional hydrogen can be recovered through a water-gas shift reaction
of the carbon monoxide with steam
leaving a stream of concentrated CO2.
Another option is to use some or all of
the synthesis gas and steam produced
for electric power generation.
Commercialization of the gasification process began more than 50 years
ago with most applications supporting
the production of chemicals or liquid
fuels.25
Several vendors, such as Shell,
General Electric, ConocoPhillips, and
Sasol-Lurgi, provide commercial-scale
gasification technologies,26 and hundreds of commercial gasifiers currently
operate around the world.27 All the
commercial gasification technologies
recover heat from the gasifier through
steam production.
Gasification of refinery by-products
of low or negative value allows conversion of these by-products into hydrogen, steam, or electric power. In many
cases, a concentrated stream of CO2
is produced that can be captured for
potential use, such as in enhanced oil
recovery or for sequestration.

and generally translates to increased
refinery profitability.20 The upgraded
refinery will have increased requirements for utilities such as hydrogen,
steam, and power, which can be generated on site or imported over-the-fence,
depending on the relative economics.
These additional utility requirements, however, will increase the greenhouse gas footprint of the refinery due
to the incremental CO2 emissions from
fuel combustion to meet the increased
power and steam requirements and
from increased process CO2 emissions
when steam-methane reformers are
used to satisfy the incremental hydrogen demand.
Recent regulatory21 22 and legislative23
developments in the US in support of
curbing GHG emissions from manufacturing facilities may eventually pose
a barrier to future refinery expansions,
particularly those based on heavy crude.
The use of cogeneration to increase
the efficiency of steam and power generation can help offset a portion of the
incremental GHG from refinery expansion projects. Cogeneration units can
be integrated with either conventional
hydrogen plants or gasification units to
realize additional efficiency benefits.
The possibility of the integrated, on
site generation of hydrogen, steam, and
power is particularly attractive due to
the potential for gasification of the residuals from the refinery processing of
heavy Canadian crudes and is described
in more detail in the following section.

Electronic advances over the past 5
years have improved floor inspection of
ASTs by in-service robotic technology,
yielding not only better inspection and
tank cleaning abilities, but greater operational efficiency and a broader user
base. The number of tanks inspected
with in-service robotics now exceeds
1,000. Inspections can now occur without the tank being taken out of service.

Compliant with API Std 653 (Ref 1)
guidelines for determining tank floor
corrosion rates and when combined
with an API 653 tank external survey,
TechCorr, Houston, uses in-service
robotics with high-density ultrasound
scanning to give tank owners a full picture of AST condition without removing
the tank from service and while staying
in compliance with tank inspection
requirements.
Some tanks require out-of-service
inspections because of their condition,
age, and inspection history, but a growing population of tanks will benefit
from this technology, especially given
current demand for storage capacity
and difficulty in removing a tank from
service for full inspection.
This article discusses specific technical capabilities for use of in-service,
high density, ultrasound scanning to
assess the condition of AST floors. It will
also cover safety, environmental risk
reduction, and cost savings.

completely of product and vapor. Product drains first through fixed lines and
then temporary lines to remove most of
the volume. Squeegees, diesel diluent,
and water frequently serve as means
for removing residual product. Fans,
sometimes in conjunction with vaporrecovery burning equipment, occasionally enter service to remove tank vapors.
Once the tank is vapor free, its floor is
prepared for inspection, often by sand
blasting.
A variety of techniques including
magnetic flux exclusion (MFE) and
contact ultrasound testing (UT) inspect
the tank. Crews then make any necessary repairs, reseal the tank manways,
and return the tank to service. The
entire process may take 1 week to 6
months depending on tank size, product, plant and contractor schedules, and
scope of repairs.

Defect identiﬁcation
On stream inspections also seek to
identify a range of plate defects in addition to plate thickness. Although a lack
of sufficient clarity usually prohibits
direct visual examination, topside and
bottom-side corrosion can be indirectly
classified, laminated plate identified,
and coating failure detected.

Topside, bottom-side
Examining the series of returns
before and after the flagged return can
discriminate topside from bottom-side
corrosion. When the front face, the

hand, if the front return moves along
the x-axes toward a fixed second return,
then the thinning is probably due to

Measuring the distance between any

analysis software assists in classification.

during fabrication. They usually appear

values close to 50% of nominal.

R ISK-BASED INSPECTION TANK-FAILURE LIKELIHOOD

Unless the tank’s contents
allow for direct inspection
of a surface via camera, the
UT analyst must depend on
knowledge of UT to detect
separation between the steel
and the coating. Coatings in
this instance refer to a direct
layer of epoxy or a thick material liner (such as fiberglass
resin). When a coating failure
occurs, UT returns (pulseecho modes) are scattered,
making thickness measurements impossible. Pockets of
air or gas occupying the space
between the lifted coating (or
liner) and the steel floor usually cause these returns. When
detected adjacent to plate
characterized by clear UT
returns, however, with sufficient signal-to-noise ratios
for peak-to-peak measurements, they likely reflect areas
of coating failure.

UT data also improve the
effectiveness of risk-based
inspection programs.
The industry uses RBI
programs to focus resources
on important components
in process facilities. An RBI
analysis assesses both the
probability and consequences of failure. Results can
prioritize inspections within
a plant and select appropriate inspection methods for
the most probable modes of

failure.
The important feature of RBI analysis
as it relates to UT scanning of tank
floors is the added level of confidence
available for determining degrees of risk
using accurate, quantifiable UT floorthickness data, removing some of the
ambiguity previously associated with
risk-based assessments. Indirect, riskbased assessments of tank floor conditions can now be verified and augmented with reliable direct measurements.
Fig. 6 shows results of a 35-tank
analysis, including RBI results with and
without high-density tank floor UT
data. The results support the benefits of
using actual floor UT data in risk-based
studies to improve forecasting of the
appropriate next internal inspection

With proﬁts down,
lawmakers ﬁnd new
oil-price menace
When oil-company proﬁts surged last
year, Congress staged a two-ring circus. So
what happens now that proﬁts are crashing?
The circus played ﬁrst on Apr. 1 in the
House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming. Chairman
Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) summoned
executives of ﬁve major oil companies
to parry questions that were really politi-

cal barbs aimed at Republican President
George W. Bush.
“Big Oil’s proﬁts have more than
quadrupled over the last 6 years,” Markey
complained. The price of oil was less than
$20/bbl when Bush took ofﬁce but had risen
above $100/bbl, he pointed out, not bothering to mention the contrasting market
strains at work during those points in time.
Markey was, of course, simply exploiting oil-price restiveness to discredit an
opposition-party president through association with an unpopular industry
The circus performed next in the Senate
Judiciary Committee, where Chairman
Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) asked the same
ﬁve executives “how all of you can justify
such exorbitant proﬁts on the backs of the
middle class and hard-working families.”
Again, the target was Bush.
“The president once boasted that with
his pals in the oil industry, he would be able
to keep prices low and consumers would
beneﬁt,” Leahy said. “Instead, it appears to
be his friends in the oil industry who have
beneﬁted.”
Like Markey’s, Leahy’s hearing favored
insinuation over insight.
It shouldn’t require a congressional
hearing to establish that oil company profits rise when oil prices increase.
What the likes of Markey and Leahy
won’t acknowledge is the reverse case.
With oil and gas prices this year down
from year-earlier levels, oil company proﬁts
are plummeting.
For the record, here are the just-reported
second quarter-to-second quarter earnings
declines for the companies used as congressional stage props last year: Shell 67%,
ConocoPhillips 76%, Chevron 79%, BP 53%,
and ExxonMobil 66%.
Markey and Leahy won’t hold any
grateful hearings about this retreat from
supposed exorbitance and what it means
for hard-working families, of course.
Congress has found a new class of oilprice menace onto which to heave bombastic scorn. Now “speculators” are in the ring.

KBC: Index funds lift oil prices
A growing market force is ﬂoating crude prices above levels justiﬁed by the
simple fundamentals of supply and demand, said analysts at KBC Market Services, a
division of KBC Process Technology Ltd. in Surrey, UK.
In an Aug. 3 report, KBC analysts asked, “How can it be that $60/bbl was justiﬁed
when supply was trailing demand in the period 2004-06 and [is again] justiﬁed today
when supply is so greatly exceeding demand?” As they astutely pointed out, “Something has clearly changed in the energy market.” The primary change they see is “the
rapid inﬂow of cash from index funds that, beginning in 2004, have greatly increased
their energy market exposure.” KBC analysts said, “This cash is coming from passive
index funds that now dominate, but do not entirely dictate, global energy prices.”
Index funds are not among the speculators now being damned before Congress
for jacking up oil prices for fun and proﬁt. Administrators of index funds “care little
for the absolute price of oil; professional money managers seek only the beneﬁts
that the commodity energy market offers in terms of their overall portfolio of investments,” the analysts explained. However, they said, “Through their dominant size,
and because they are always net buyers, all of the petroleum commodity instruments have moved higher in price to accommodate the signiﬁcant incremental
demand for oil represented by these index funds.”
Assuming current oil market fundamentals justify a crude price of $30-40/bbl,
KBC analysts estimate the market impact of index funds, together with more active
participation in oil futures markets by the large hedge funds, may add $30/bbl.
“We believe that the activity of ﬁnancial investors has exerted a strong upward
bias on crude oil prices that is essentially permanent—provided they remain in the
market,” said KBC analysts. “Furthermore, the ‘long’ only nature of the index position leads to a strong ‘contango’ bias time curve. The fact that these investors are
required to indeﬁnitely roll their positions by selling near term and buying further
out has not escaped notice. The ‘zero sum’ nature of the market is only too willing
to proﬁt from these monthly costs for just as long as the index investors are willing
to pay for that privilege.” The indices put similar upward pressure on prices in the
gasoline and heating oil markets.
CFTC hearings
Responding to changing political winds, a new proactive administration, and the
consequences of high energy prices in 2007, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has clearly signaled its intent to review and revise market regulations. KBC
analysts said, “As Congress and the CFTC begin this period of comment and likely
change to commodity regulations, we suggest a measured response. It is unlikely
there will be any meaningful change to a very signiﬁcant inﬂow of index funds without a change in position limits. However, that is precisely what the chairman [Gary
Gensler] is focusing on.” The CFTC had hearings July 28-29 concerning the roles of a
variety of participants in various commodity markets. The third and last hearing was
scheduled Aug. 5. In the earlier hearings, witnesses warned adoption of too strict
regulations could damage the futures markets. Some participants said speculation
should not be blamed for the big changes in energy prices.
“We have not seen empirical evidence that index funds and speculators distort
prices, as has been widely alleged, nor is there any proof that putting position limits
on these market participants will have any positive effect,” said Craig Donohue, chief
executive of CME Group, the parent company of the New York Mercantile Exchange,
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and the Chicago Board of Trade. “We are deeply
concerned that inappropriate regulation of these markets will cause participants to
move to dark pools and other unregulated markets, causing irrevocable harm to the
entire US economy” (OGJ Online, July 28, 2009).
Testifying for the Air Transport Association of America, Ben Hirst, senior vicepresident and general counsel for Delta Airlines, said, “The objective should be to
allow sufﬁcient speculation to provide sufﬁcient liquidity to enable the market to
function efﬁciently, and no more. While it may not be possible to determine this limit
with scientiﬁc precision, a reasonable surrogate might be the level of speculative
activity on regulated exchanges 10 or more years ago, before the recent explosion of
speculation in commodities.”
Steven Strongin, managing director of Goldman Sachs, told an earlier Senate
committee hearing attempts to regulate market price volatility “have rarely if ever
succeeded.” But such attempts “often have unintended and signiﬁcant consequences,” he said.

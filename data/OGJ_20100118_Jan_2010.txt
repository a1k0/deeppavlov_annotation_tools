A pumping unit draws oil from deep below a cotton crop in East
Texas. Oil production climbed last year in some states, including Texas, to give the US its first output gain since 1991. OGJ‚Äôs
annual Forecast & Review, starting on p. 20, looks at what‚Äôs to
come in supply and demand for oil and gas in 2010 and examines
what took place in the market during 2009. Photo courtesy of

US senators support Iraq as EITI candidate
US Sens. Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.) and Richard G. Lugar
(R-Ind.) expressed their strong support for Iraq‚Äôs commitment to
make its oil and gas industry more transparent following Iraq‚Äôs
Jan. 11 announcement that it plans to become an Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative candidate country.
EITI is an international coalition of governments, companies,
and others that promotes good governance through publication of
oil, gas, and mining revenues, the two Senate Foreign Relations
Committee members noted on Jan. 12.
‚ÄúCorruption remains a significant problem in Iraq,‚Äù said Lugar,
the committee‚Äôs ranking minority member. ‚ÄúAs oil and gas is the
single largest source of revenue [there], it is important that the
revenue generated benefit the people of Iraq and not just a handful
of businessmen and officials. By committing to implement EITI,
Iraq is creating a foundation for good governance in a sector critical to Iraq‚Äôs future stability.‚Äù
Cardin said, ‚ÄúThis is a significant step toward a greater future
for Iraq.‚Äù The senator also has promoted EITI as chairman of the
Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, more commonly known as the US-Helsinki Commission.
‚ÄúThe EITI process has proven to strengthen civil society and increase revenue transparency. By joining this coalition, Iraq‚Äôs leaders are committing to transparency that will empower citizens to
hold their government accountable,‚Äù Cardin maintained.
Iraqi Prime Minister Noori al Malaki announced Jan. 11 that
Iraq plans to become an EITI candidate country in February and
would implement the initiative in May. With 11% of the world‚Äôs
total reserves, Iraq would become the largest oil-producing nation
to implement the standards, EITI officials said.
At a conference launching Iraq‚Äôs effort in Baghdad, Jonas Moberg, who heads EITI‚Äôs secretariat, said the country‚Äôs implementation of EITI would be important in driving Iraq‚Äôs recovery and
ensuring that its oil and gas wealth was managed for its citizens‚Äô
benefit.
Lugar and Cardin, along with eight other cosponsors, recently

introduced S 1700, the Energy Security Through Transparency
Act, which aims to increase transparency through public disclosure of oil, gas, and mining payments, and encourage US participation in EITI.

Jakarta delays reshuffle of Pertamina board
The Indonesian government has delayed its planned announcement of a reshuffle of the board of directors of state-owned PT
Pertamina until all candidates can be screened by an evaluation
team and approved by the company president.
According to Indonesia‚Äôs current minister of state for stateowned enterprise Mustafa Abubakar, the evaluation of new candidates by a team comprised of himself, the energy minister, the
finance minister, and the chief economics minister is still underway.
‚ÄúWe expect the process to finish in the third week of January
or at the end of the month at the latest,‚Äù said Mustafa, who confirmed that Jakarta would keep Pertamina Pres. Director Karen
Agustiawan, while removing the position of vice-president director now held by Omar S. Anwar.
The change is significant. When Agustiawan and Anwar were
appointed last year, Indonesia‚Äôs former minister of state for state
enterprises Sofyan Djalil said the appointments represented a
combination of business and technical expertise.
‚ÄúKaren has expertise in technical aspects of the oil and gas industry, while Pak Omar has experience in business and finance,‚Äù
said Djalil. ‚ÄúI believe they are going to make a good combination
for Pertamina,‚Äù Djalil said (OGJ Online, Feb. 13, 2009).
In announcing the coming change, which includes reshuffling
all of Pertamina‚Äôs directors, Mustafa said Jakarta expects that ‚Äúthe
new directors of Pertamina will support the company in bringing
in more profit‚Äù than in previous years.
Mustafa said the new directors are expected to help the company earn 20-25 trillion rupiah ($2.16 billion) in profit during
2010. In 2008, Pertamina earned 30.2 trillion rupiah, up 54.8%
from 2007, while it is predicted to earn 17.7 trillion rupiah in net
profit in 2009. ‚ú¶

Davy Jones cited as large gulf shelf discovery
An ultradeep exploratory well on the Davy Jones prospect could
be one of the largest discoveries in decades on the Gulf of Mexico
shelf, said operator McMoRan Exploration Co., New Orleans.
Wireline log results indicate a combined 135 net ft of hydrocarbon-bearing sands in four zones in Eocene-Paleocene Wilcox.
All four zones are full to base, and two contained a combined 90
net ft of sands. The Wilcox suite logged below 27,300 ft ‚Äúappears

‚Äî Q u i c k Ta k e s

to be of exceptional quality,‚Äù McMoRan said.
The Davy Jones well went to 28,263 ft measured depth in 20 ft
of water on South Marsh Island Block 230. Pipe-conveyed wireline
logs went as deep as 28,134 ft. McMoRan will deepen the well to
29,000 ft to test other objectives.
McMoRan said flow tests are required to confirm the ultimate
hydrocarbon flow rates from the four separate zones. The resistivity log obtained Jan. 10 was the last information needed to con-

firm hydrocarbons on the block.
James R. Moffett, McMoRan co-chairman, said: ‚ÄúDavy Jones
log results confirm our geologic model and indicate that the previously identified sands in the Wilcox section on this large ultradeep structure encompassing four OCS lease blocks (20,000
acres) provides significant additional development potential
which, upon confirmation development drilling, could make
Davy Jones one of the largest discoveries on the shelf of the Gulf
of Mexico in decades.
‚ÄúThe geologic results from this well are important and are redefining the subsurface geologic landscape below 20,000 ft on the
shelf of the Gulf of Mexico. The results from this well will be incorporated into our models as we continue to define the potential
of this promising new exploration frontier.‚Äù
McMoRan operates the Davy Jones prospect and is funding
25.7% of the exploratory costs. It holds a 32.7% working interest
and 25.9% net revenue interest.
Other working interests owners include Plains Exploration &
Production Co. 27.7%, Energy XXI Bermuda Ltd. 15.8%, Nippon
Oil Exploration USA Ltd. 12%, W.A. ‚ÄúTex‚Äù Moncrief Jr. 8.8%, and
a private investor 3%.
Energy XXI is funding 14.1% of the exploratory costs to earn its
12.6% net revenue interest in the prospect.

Apache tests another discovery in Faghur basin
Houston-based Apache Corp.‚Äôs WKAL-A-2X discovery tested
5,085 b/d of oil and 130 Mcfd of gas, marking the fourth successful exploration test in West Kalabsha concession and the company‚Äôs sixth discovery in the Faghur basin play in Egypt‚Äôs far Western
Desert near the Libyan border.
The WKAL-A-2X discovery is a 0.5 miles north of the Apache
WKAL-A-1X discovery and 5 miles west of Apache‚Äôs Phiops field.
‚ÄúWith this latest discovery and other recent wells, we anticipate
production from the Phiops-West Kalabsha area will double to
20,000 b/d as additional infrastructure is brought on line in the
third quarter,‚Äù said Rod Eichler, Apache‚Äôs co-chief operating officer and president of international operations. ‚ÄúWe estimate the
discovered resource potential in the Phiops and Kalabsha areas
exceeds 50 million boe.‚Äù
Apache has identified several additional prospects and is acquiring
more 3D seismic in the Faghur basin in hopes of extending its string
of successes to the northeast and southwest of this most recent discovery. Eichler said, ‚ÄúThe thickness of the sands and the stacked pay
zones make this a very attractive area for further exploration.‚Äù
Apache plans to drill seven additional exploration wells in the
Faghur basin play this year.
The latest well was designed to test Cretaceous-age Alam El
Buieb (AEB) formations in a new fault block in a structurally higher position than the WKAL-A-1X well. The WKAL-A-2X logged a
total of 198 ft of pay in four AEB intervals including the 3G interval that was highly productive in a test of the WKAL-A-1X well.
The latest well was perforated over the top 10 ft of a 29-ft section
of the AEB-3C10 sand.
Apache has applied for a development lease with the Egyptian
General Petroleum Co. for both discoveries. Apache operates the
West Kalabsha concession and has 100% contractor interest.

InterOil makes improved test of Antelope-2
InterOil Corp., Cairns, said the Antelope-2 well in Papua
New Guinea flowed at a stabilized rate of 11 MMcfd through a
48/64-in. choke in the last 7 hr of a second drill stem test, and
the condensate-to-gas ratio (CGR) averaged 20.7 bbl/MMcf of
natural gas.
This represents a 15% increase in CGR from the first drill stem
test at the top of the reservoir, officials said.
Prior to the second test, casing was set to a depth of 7,290 ft,
short of total depth of 7,415 ft due to an impassable ledge. The
well subsequently was drilled an additional 213 ft, and the second
test was made with a packer inside the casing shoe over the 338 ft
open hole section from 7,290 ft.
Another drill stem test is planned in the lower section of the
open hole. Workers will then drill and core to the targeted heavier
condensate and potential oil zone where the company expects to
perform additional tests and formation evaluation. Following testing and logging of the lower vertical section of the wellbore, InterOil plans to drill a horizontal lateral to explore a potential oil
zone.
Phil Mulacek, InterOil chief executive officer, said, ‚ÄúWe anticipate that the higher condensate ratio [in the second test] of
the Antelope structure will improve the previously estimated economics of the stripping plant proposed to be constructed in the
Gulf Province.‚Äù

Algeria‚Äôs Ain Tsila gas-condensate size grows
Well tests established a reservoir more than 22 km long at the
Ain Tsila gas-condensate discovery on the Isarene permit in eastern Algeria‚Äôs Illizi basin, said Petroceltic International PLC.
Tests at the AT-3 delineation well indicated that the gas column
more than 80 m thick is in the same pressure regime as wells AT-1
and AT-2, ‚Äúdemonstrating that this gas-condensate discovery extends for a distance of over 22 km, from AT-1 to AT-3,‚Äù Petroceltic
said.
Petroceltic and Algeria‚Äôs state owned Sonatrach could not frac
the Ordovician reservoir at AT-3 because the pressures required
exceeded the pressure rating of the wellhead equipment.
Local high in-situ stress caused by localized tectonic history
is a known issue in other Illizi basin fields in Algeria. Petroceltic
considers the pressure regime likely to be of limited extent rather
than regionally extensive. The company filed a discovery declaration for Ain Tsila field.
Petroceltic suspended the well with a view to completing the
fracture stimulation and testing as part of a future Ain Tsila appraisal campaign when wellhead equipment with a higher pressure rating can be deployed, possibly later in 2010, subject to government and partner approval.
Petroceltic said, ‚ÄúData from the three wells drilled in the Ain
Tsila discovery have demonstrated the presence of an extensive
and probably continuous gas accumulation capable of flowing at
rates exceeding 30 MMscfd following fracture stimulation.‚Äù
The company is drilling the INW-2 well on the Issaouane
Northwest prospect in the northwest part of the block. The rig
has logged two gas-bearing intervals in the primary Devonian F2
objective and is drilling in the secondary Ordovician reservoir obOil & Gas Journal / Jan. 18, 2010

ExxonMobil plans injection for Hawkins field
ExxonMobil Production Co. plans to reinject nitrogen and
other gases to produce an additional 40 million boe from mature
Hawkins field in northeastern Texas.
Company officials plan to install equipment to recover the gases from the field‚Äôs natural gas production and reinject them into
the reservoir to increase production. They claim the project will
reduce the plant‚Äôs air emissions by almost one-third and extend
the life of the field, discovered by the forerunner of ExxonMobil
in 1940, for an additional 25 years.
Construction is expected to begin in the first quarter, employing a workforce of 300 at its peak. Start-up is anticipated in late
2011.
Hawkins field lies in Wood County about 100 miles east of
Dallas and is one of the largest fields discovered in the state. Over
the past 70 years, it has produced more than 800 million bbl of
oil.

Exco ordered to stop Marcellus drilling
Exco Resources Inc., Dallas‚Äîthe first company permitted in an
eastern Pennsylvania county to drill for natural gas on the Marcellus shale formation‚Äîhas been ordered to cease operations.
According to Greenfield Township in Lackawanna County,
Exco violated a local zoning ordinance. State regulators last summer gave the company a permit to drill near the Skyline Public
Golf Course, which is zoned for commercial recreation.
But Township supervisor Joseph Slebodnik has since said drill-

Partnership acquires Gulf brand from Chevron
Gulf Oil LP, Framingham, Mass., acquired all rights, title, and
interest to the Gulf brand in the US from Chevron USA Inc. and
plans to expand its use of the brand throughout the US.
Although the brand has been in existence nearly 110 years, for
the last 20 years Gulf-branded gasoline in the Lower 48 has been
available only in an 11-state region in the Northeast through a
licensing agreement between Chevron and Gulf Oil‚Äôs parent Cumberland Farms Inc. The limited partnership is one of the Northeast‚Äôs largest wholesalers of petroleum products.
In 2005, Gulf Oil initiated an extensive overhaul of its marketing and business strategy to enhance the brand value of Gulf and
to restore the image and perception of Gulf as a premium gasoline
retailer.
The forerunner Gulf Oil Corp., formed in 1907, was a major
international oil company that once ranked among the top ‚ÄúSeven Sisters.‚Äù In the first decade of the 20th century, the company
promoted the concept of branded products by selling gasoline

ing for gas is not allowed in that area. Exco has 30 days to appeal
the violation notice to the township‚Äôs zoning hearing board.
Exco Chief Operating Officer Hal Hickey said the company will
continue working with the township and will ensure the firm is
in full compliance with ‚Äúall governing jurisdictions.‚Äù
Last July, Exco said it received the permit from state regulators
to drill two sites near the Skyline Public Golf Course in Greenfield
Township.
According to reports, the golf course was part of a collectively
negotiated gas lease of 25,000 acres that Exco bought for $2,100/
acre and an 18% production royalty.
The award came after Pennsylvania‚Äôs Department of Environmental Protection issued a statement in April in support of drilling
for gas in the Marcellus shale, noting that ‚Äúthe Commonwealth
fully supports these activities and the development of the Marcellus play.‚Äù
Since then, however, environmental activists have been stepping up pressure on Pennsylvania officials to discontinue drilling
for gas in the state‚Äôs Marcellus shale areas.
In December, the activist PennEnvironment organization pressured public officials with a report outlining what it called ‚Äúthe
most urgent and widespread‚Äù environmental and public health
concerns associated with Marcellus Shale gas drilling in the state.
‚ÄúOur elected officials are going to have to make a decision:
are they going to protect the public‚Äôs health, or are they going to
put polluter profits ahead of the health of the Commonwealth‚Äôs
citizens and environment?‚Äù said said Erika Staaf, Clean Water Advocate with PennEnvironment. ‚ú¶

station in 1911. Gulf Oil was merged into Chevron in 1984. To
comply with federal antitrust provisions, Chevron sold some Gulf
stations to Cumberland Farms in 1985.

Petrochemical complex advances in Qatar
Qatar Petroleum and ExxonMobil Chemical Qatar Ltd. have
agreed to advance development of a petrochemical complex that
would include the world‚Äôs largest steam cracker at Ras Laffan, Qatar.
The complex, which the companies still label ‚Äúproposed,‚Äù
would include a 1.6 million-tonne/year (tpy) steam cracker, two
650,000-tpy gas-phase polyethylene plants, and a 700,000-tpy
ethylene glycol plant.
Feed will be natural gas from supergiant North field. The complex will use ExxonMobil steam cracking and polyethylene processes and product technologies.
The plant would start up in late 2015.

Uzbekistan cuts gas by 50% to Tajikistan
Uzbekistan‚Äôs state-owned Uzbektransgaz has reduced its supplies of natural gas to neighboring Tajikistan by 50% due to a dispute over payment.
Shavkat Shoimov, deputy head of Tajikstan‚Äôs state-owned Tajiktransgaz said Uzbektransgaz demanded prepayment for gas, but
his country does not ‚Äúhave such means and there are no free resources.‚Äù
Shoimov said, ‚ÄúWe do not have funds to make prepayments
now. Funds we have are enough for only 2 or 3-day gas shipments,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúThis is the reason for gas supply cuts from 480,000 cu m to
240,000 cu m/day,‚Äù said Shoiumov, who added that his firm in
turn has had to impose cuts on to Tajik factories.
According to analyst IHS Global Insight, Uzbekistan regularly
halts or sharply reduces gas exports to Tajikistan, usually to enforce payment of debts accumulated for supplies already received.
‚ÄúIn an effort to end this cycle of debt and supply cut-offs,
Uzbekistan last year began requiring its main gas debtor countries‚ÄîKyrgyzstan and Tajikistan‚Äîto make prepayments for gas
supplies,‚Äù the analyst said.
Last month, Tajiktransgaz and Uzbektransgaz signed an agreement on Uzbek gas shipments to Tajikistan in 2010. Under the
agreement, Tajikistan is due to import 250 million cu m of gas
from Uzbekistan next year.
At the time, Tjiktransgaz head Saidmamat Sharofiddinov said
the gas price would vary quarterly depending on the on world
market trends and that ‚ÄúThe gas price for the first quarter of 2010
will become known only in early January.‚Äù
Sharofiddinov also said that Tajikistan would buy Uzbek gas
on a take-or-pay agreement and that under the contract ‚ÄúThe conditions remain the same‚Äîwe will make prepayments every 10
days.‚Äù

PetroChina assumes Aramco lease at Statia terminal
PetroChina, eyeing shifts in world trading patterns, has taken
over Saudi Aramco‚Äôs lease on 5 million bbl of oil storage capacity
at the NuStar Energy LP Statia terminal on the Dutch Caribbean
island of St. Eustatius.
The facility, which was released after Aramco obtained free
oil storage facilities in Okinawa, is a strategically located hub for
oil tankers plying the waters between North, Central, and South
America and the Caribbean.
It can handle the largest oil tankers, is close to major US refining and transport hubs on the Gulf Coast, and can eventually be
used by China as part of a broader oil trading network within the
region and beyond.
12

‚Äî Q u i c k Ta k e s

Analysts said PetroChina‚Äôs lease of the facility anticipates the
expansion of the Panama Canal now under way, which will allow
passage of larger ships carrying greater amounts of oil, LNG, and
other commodities.
Overall, Panama is spending $5.25 billion in the first major
expansion of the canal since it was opened in 1914. Enlargement
of the canal, which currently handles 5% of global trade, is to be
completed in 2014.
The enlarged canal will allow passage of tankers capable of carrying 1 million bbl of oil, LNG carriers, and Capesize bulk cargo
vessels that transport coal, metals, and other raw materials, taking
weeks off transit times and shifting global trade patterns. Asian
countries may find it cheaper to buy oil from traditional US suppliers such as Venezuela as shipping costs come down, and analysts say the amount of crude stored in the Caribbean will likely
increase as improved logistics allow traders to take advantage of
more arbitrage opportunities.

FERC issues final EIS for proposed Ruby gas line
Construction of a proposed natural gas pipeline from southwestern Wyoming to southern Oregon could create some adverse
environmental impacts that could be mitigated, the US Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission said on Jan. 8.
The $3 billion Ruby Pipeline Project would extend 675 miles
from an interconnect with existing pipelines near Opal, Wyo.,
across northern Utah and Nevada to interconnects east of Malin,
Ore., according to its sponsor, Ruby Pipeline LLC. It would include
four compressor stations with 160,500 hp of total capacity in addition to the 42-in. line with an initial capacity of 1.5 bcfd of gas,
the El Paso Corp. subsidiary said at its web site.
The project‚Äôs adverse environmental impacts could be reduced
to less than significant levels with implementation of the sponsor‚Äôs proposed mitigation measures, additional mitigation measures which Ruby is discussing with other agencies, and additional FERC recommendations, the final EIS indicated.
FERC said its final EIS decision was based on factors including
more than 44% of the project using existing right-of-way or land
nearby, Ruby‚Äôs commitment to design and operate the pipeline
in accordance with US Department of Transportation regulations,
and Ruby‚Äôs plans to implement site-specific or activity-specific
plans, procedures, and agreements to protect natural resources,
avoid or limit environmental impacts, and promote restoration of
disturbed areas.
The project‚Äôs sponsor said that construction could begin later
this year after all permits are obtained, with an estimated March

Climate and plague
St. Augustine said it best: ‚ÄùFaith is
to believe what we cannot see; and the
reward of this faith is to see what we
believe,‚Äù in this particular case, the
deleterious effects of man-made carbon
dioxide emissions. On the other hand,
if one prefers to trust evidence, the answers are perfectly clear.
Carbon dioxide is a transparent,
odorless, and tasteless gas and not a
pollutant. Its concentration is increasing
slowly in the atmosphere but has not
yet reached 400 ppm, while it will take
20,000 ppm to make you feel short of
breath and 50,000 ppm to kill you. No
reason to panic.
Some 18,000 years ago the Arctic Ice
Cap covered much of the north part of
this continent, Europe, and Asia; there
was 1 km of ice over the place where
I am writing these lines. Most of it has
now melted, and it is likely that all of
it will soon. This is corroborated by a
concomitant rise of sea level. No sane
person denies global warming or its
fluctuations.
The ice cores have sampled a
620,000-years-long record. There is
no substantial controversy about their
analysis or interpretation. They show
seven distinct glaciations separated by
interglacial periods. We had nothing to
do with bringing about these climate
changes since we appeared only some
180,000 years ago and started substantive emissions of carbon dioxide only
150 years ago.
The ice cores show that every interglacial period started with a sharp
increase of temperature, followed, some
600-800 years later, by a sharp rise in
atmospheric carbon dioxide. Therefore,
clearly, rising temperatures caused the
rising levels of carbon dioxide and not
the other way around. Since carbon
dioxide is about two times more soluble
at 0Àö C. than at 20Àö C., it is obvious that
rising temperatures caused it to outgas
from the enormous reservoir of seawater; later, decreasing temperatures
returned it to solution.
Therefore, carbon dioxide has a very
subordinate effect on global temperatures. What drives them has not yet

Another leasing setback
The second-worst part of land management
under US Interior Sec. Ken Salazar is duplicity. The
worst part is a systematic slowdown in development of oil and gas resources.
Salazar‚Äôs pattern has been described here before: He claims to be addressing reckless leasing
of the Bush administration. He says he‚Äôs injecting
caution into a nevertheless brisk leasing program
in service to national energy interests. Then he
slows leasing and discourages related work. Since
taking office early last year, Salazar has withdrawn
leases, rescinded an oil shale leasing program,
supported legislation that will prevent or impede leasing of 28 million acres, and shortened
terms of offshore leases on which drilling doesn‚Äôt
proceed according to his schedule (OGJ, Nov. 23,
2009, p. 18).
This is no way to develop energy supply. This
is no way to create jobs.

Creating delay
Salazar now has announced onshore leasing
reforms certain to create delay and thwart activity (see story, p. 33). Among other things, the
reforms will limit use of categorical exclusions,
which the Energy Policy Act of 2005 created to
streamline environmental reviews. True to form,
the interior secretary claimed to be correcting the
Bush administration‚Äôs ‚Äúanywhere, anyhow‚Äù policy
while pressing forward with a healthy leasing
schedule. Neither claim is valid.
Salazar selectively offers leasing figures to imply his department harbors no reluctance to make
federal land available for oil and gas leasing. In
a press conference on the new onshore rules, he
averred that the Bureau of Land Management in
2009 held 35 offering of onshore leases involving
2,542 parcels covering 2.9 million acres.
To Americans unfamiliar with the issue, those
numbers might seem to describe a robust effort.
To them, Interior thus might appear to be meeting its statutory obligations to offer public land
for oil and gas development. To those Americans, therefore, industry protestations can seem
unfounded. Salazar played to these impressions
when he said, ‚ÄúI think those in the industry who
are crying out are crying out because we‚Äôre being
careful and supporting development in the right
18

way in the right places.‚Äù
In fact, onshore leasing has slowed remarkably.
Environmentalists opposed to oil and gas work
know this and know enough about leasing numbers to be pleased. An offering of 2,542 parcels
in 12 months represents a shrunken program. In
late November, Salazar said BLM in 2009 had sold
1,212 of 2,346 parcels offered. At that rate, it will
have issued 1,313 leases in calendar 2009.
Indeed, that‚Äôs much less leasing than occurred
during the Bush administration. According to
calculations from BLM data, the federal government issued an average of 2,976 leases/year during 2001-08. Through that period, Salazar said
in the press conference, BLM worked as a ‚Äúcandy
store‚Äù for the petroleum industry, representatives
of which were ‚Äúkings of the world.‚Äù The implication is that‚Äîwith BLM acting as ‚Äúessentially the
handmaiden of the industry‚Äù‚Äîonshore oil and
gas leasing surged ahead under Bush and that the
interior secretary now is bringing it back under
control.
If Salazar‚Äôs premise is true, leasing during the
Bush term should have exceeded activity of prior
years. By the best measure of the propensity to
lease‚Äîleases issued‚Äîit did not. The average number of leases issued per year during the Clinton
administration was 3,796‚Äî28% above the Bush
rate.
So Salazar is wrong when he claims to be sustaining leasing at healthy levels; in fact, he‚Äôs discouraging an activity that‚Äôs good for employment
and essential to energy supply. And he‚Äôs wrong
in his portrayals of the Bush tenure as a period of
unbridled leasing; in fact, average annual onshore
leases per year in that period declined.

Troubling prejudice
Salazar‚Äôs rhetorical slaps at the oil and gas
industry should trouble anyone concerned about
energy supply. They reveal prejudice substantiated
by the interior secretary‚Äôs record of leasing resistance. It‚Äôs a record that contradicts US energy and
employment imperatives. And it‚Äôs a record spun
out of a pattern of misrepresentation.
The US needs better stewardship of federal oil
and gas resources than Salazar so far has provided. ‚ú¶

Moderate economic growth will
spur a small recovery in US energy
demand this year.
Total US energy demand will grow
less than 1% in 2010 on the heels of last
year‚Äôs 4% decline. Demand for oil, natural gas, and renewable energy sources
will increase, while a slide in coal
demand will add to last year‚Äôs drop.

2009 rise in oil
prices was tied to

While the amount of US commercial
crude oil in storage was robust during
2009, finishing the year above the yearend 2008 level, so were crude prices.
The spot price of West Texas Intermediate averaged $77.99/bbl in November
2009, having climbed from an average
of $39.09/bbl in February of that year.

But a 1.5 million b/d boost in demand
from countries outside the OECD will
cause total demand to climb.
Worldwide demand for oil this year

America will take up this slack. Outside the OECD, IEA expects a climb

Worldwide oil supply
Worldwide output of oil will increase this year to average 86 million
b/d, compared with 84.9 million b/d
last year and 86.4 million b/d two years
ago.
All of the supply growth will come
from non-OECD countries, as OECD
output will shrink this year, according to IEA estimates. Crude and natural
gas liquids production will decline in
Mexico, Norway, and the UK.
Outside the OECD, IEA calls for oil
output to increase in Brazil, Colombia,
Oman, Russia, Azerbaijan, and China.

million b/d from last year.
Including processing gains and other
biofuels, IEA forecasts that 2010 nonOPEC supply will average 51.6 million
b/d, up from last year‚Äôs 51.3 million
b/d.
IEA figures also show that NGL
production within OPEC, which is not
subject to the group‚Äôs output ceilings,
will continue to climb, averaging 5.7
million b/d this year. Last year the
organization‚Äôs NGL supply averaged 4.9
million b/d.
OGJ estimates that OPEC crude
output will average 28.68 million b/d
this year, nearly unchanged from 2009.
Considering the current demand estimates, this would end in a stockdraw of
300,000 b/d for the year.
With oil prices near $80/bbl at the
start of 2010 and economic recovery still weak in many industrialized
countries, OPEC should be reluctant to
cut its output ceilings any time soon.
Despite full OECD oil inventories, an
oil-price spike now could strike a blow
to economic recovery in the US and
elsewhere.
In 2009, OPEC crude supply averaged an estimated 28.73 million b/d,
resulting in an average worldwide oil
supply of 84.9 million b/d and no
change in inventories.

US economy, energy
The economy‚Äôs recovery will be
tempered by a lack of jobs growth, as
companies remain reluctant to hire in
2010 due to uncertainties about taxes
and the availability of credit.

bor Statistics reported that for December 2009, the unemployment rate was
unchanged from the previous month at
10%. However, the civilian labor force
that month lost 661,000 persons. Had

they been counted among the unemployed, the rate would have jumped
above the October 2009 rate of 10.2%.

for late-2009, and General Motors
announced earlier this month that it
projects it will turn a profit this year,
having exited bankruptcy just last summer with government assistance.
The National Association of Credit
Management (NACM) reported this
month that the economy remains weak,
but headed in the right direction. The
group‚Äôs December Credit Managers‚Äô
Index (CMI) matched the mood of the
economy as a whole‚Äîessentially flat,
but showing some mild progress.
NACM said the performance of the
CMI looks solid compared with the
doldrums experienced a year ago, but
in a couple of months there will be an
opportunity to compare recovery periods. There has been a consistent performance since April 2009, the report
said, and by April 2010, there should be
a more solid level of expansion. If this
doesn‚Äôt start to manifest itself there will
be renewed fears of a double-dip recession, NACM said.
The US GDP last year declined
1%, falling 6.4% in the first quarter
and 0.7% in the second quarter. The
economy fell into recession during
2008, when GDP sank by 2.7% in the
third quarter and then by 5.4% in the
fourth quarter.
Meanwhile, the employment situation soured. In June 2007, the US unemployment rate was 4.6%. A year later
it rose to 5.6%, then unemployment
rose to 7.2% in December 2008. By June
2009, the US unemployment rate was
9.4%. These figures hid the fact that
many in the US were underemployed,
working part time or at jobs below
their skill levels.
BLS reported that the number of
people working part time for economic reasons was about unchanged
at 9.2 million last month and has been
relatively flat since March 2009. These
individuals were working part time
because their hours had been cut back
or because they were unable to find a
full-time job.

Preliminary. 2Includes Missouri, South Dakota, and Tennessee.

US oil supply
US oil production will continue to
rebound from its recent low in 2008,
when crude and condensate output averaged 4.95 million b/d. OGJ forecasts
that oil production in 2010 will average
5.45 million b/d, up from 5.31 million
b/d last year.
During 2009, there were no major
disruptions to production, such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. This is
in sharp contrast to 2008, when two
major storms caused average US oil
production to sink below 4 million b/d
in the month of September of that year.
Alaskan oil production slid last
year to average an estimated 648,000
b/d, down from the 2008 average of
24

683,000 b/d. In its December 2009
Short-Term Energy Outlook, EIA forecasts that Alaskan oil production this
year will fall to average 590,000 b/d.
In 2009, average oil production
increased in a few states, including
Louisiana, North Dakota, Texas, and
Oklahoma. Average production in Louisiana jumped to an estimated 1.41 million b/d last year from a 2008 average
of 1.153 million b/d. In North Dakota,
oil production climbed to an estimated
210,000 b/d last year from 172,000 b/d
a year earlier.
NGL production will climb to average
1.95 million b/d, up from 1.9 million b/d
in 2009 and 1.784 million b/d in 2008.

Imports, exports
In 2010, US imports will slide,
although not as sharply as they did last
year. OGJ forecasts that the US will
import 8.9 million b/d of crude in
2010, excluding any for the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve. This will be a 1.5%
decrease, following a 7.6% decline in

b/d. Mexico, which exported 1.266 million b/d of crude and products to the
US last year, was followed by Venezuela,
Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, and Russia.
Of all products, residual fuel oil was

imported the most last year with an
average of 350,000 b/d. Distillate and
motor gasoline imports trailed imports
of resid, followed by propane and jet
fuel imports.

The US will export 2 million b/d
of oil this year, mostly as products.
In 2009, US oil exports averaged 2.06
million b/d, up from 1.8 million b/d a
year earlier.

Inventories
With product demand gaining steam
and refinery utilization still suppressed,
stocks of crude and oil products will
diminish during 2010.
Crude oil in storage, excluding that
in the SPR, will fall to 316 million bbl
at the close of 2010. This is down from
a yearend 2009 total of 327 million bbl,
which was 1 million bbl higher than a
year earlier.
The total volume of oil products in
storage also will move lower from the
end of 2009. OGJ forecasts that product
26

stocks will total 700 million bbl at the
end of this year, down from the yearearlier total of 722 million bbl.
Volumes of motor gasoline, jet fuel,
and distillate in storage were plentiful
during 2009, even as imports and refinery utilization rates were weak, due to
feeble demand.
The amount of crude in the SPR
will remain at its physical capacity of
727 million bbl at the end of 2010. Last
year, the reserve grew to this level from
702 million bbl. The Department of Energy took advantage of lower oil prices

in the first half of the year.
Also last year, repayments to the SPR
were made for supply released to refiners in the wake of hurricanes in 2008,
and the SPR took delivery of royalty-inkind oil during 2009.

Refining
Recovering product demand will
cause average US refinery utilization in
2010 to pick up a bit from 2009, climbing to 84.2%.
Operable capacity will increase only
slightly this year to 17.7 million b/d

from 17.673 million b/d, slowing the
trend of incremental annual capacity
growth. Meanwhile, total inputs to
refineries will rebound from the 2009

average of 14.6 million b/d to average
14.9 million b/d.
Gross inputs to US refineries
plunged in the fourth quarter of 2009

on weak demand. Total inputs for the 4
weeks ending Nov. 27, 2009, averaged
14.1 million b/d, which was down
about 1 million b/d from a year earlier.

Refinery utilization averaged an
estimated 82.8% last year. Early maintenance pushed down utilization to
average 81.5% in February 2009 vs.
85% in February 2008. The utilization
rate peaked last year for the month of
June, averaging 86.1%. During the final
month of 2009, refinery utilization
averaged just above 80%, according to
EIA figures.
Amid the weakness in product
demand, prices remained low even
as crude prices on the world market
regained strength late last year. With
28

the economy in recession, refiners
were unable to pass on their high crude
prices to their customers.
The refiners‚Äô acquisition cost of
domestic and imported crude in
November 2009 averaged $76.85/bbl,
according to EIA. That month, the Gulf
Coast cash operating refining margin
sank to average just 6¬¢/bbl, according to Muse, Stancil & Co. (MSC). The
highest monthly average last year was
for January, when this margin averaged
$6.67/bbl.
US East Coast cash margins fared

worse than the Gulf Coast margin,
averaging a negative $1.10/bbl in March
2009 and only about $1.50/bbl for the
year, according to MSC.

Oil products
Demand for all major oil products
except resid will increase this year. Total domestic demand for products will
average 18.815 million b/d, rebounding from 2009, but still down from the
2008 average of 19.5 million b/d.
Product demand growth in 2010
will be sluggish along with growth

of the US economy. As long as unemployment remains high, demand for
transportation fuels will have limited
upside potential. Transportation fuel
demand last year sagged on declines in
commercial trucking, business travel,
and leisure travel.
Motor gasoline demand will average 9.045 million b/d this year, up just
0.5%. Last year demand for gasoline
was little changed from a year earlier at
9 million b/d.
Gasoline prices last year dipped to
average $2.35/gal after peaking in 2008
with an annual average pump price for
unleaded gasoline of $3.26/gal.
OGJ forecasts that a small increase
in business travel this year will boost
average jet fuel demand to 1.425 million
b/d. Down 8% from a year earlier to 1.41
million b/d, jet fuel demand in 2009 hit
its lowest annual average since 1993.
Demand for distillate fuel oil will
move up 1.5% this year to average 3.65
million b/d, not as high as its 2008
average of 3.945 million b/d. Distillate demand fell 9% last year is spite of
much lower prices.
Demand for distillate by industrial
users declined the sharpest last year,
while use among residential, commercial, and electric power customers was
little changed from a year earlier. Most
distillate demand is for ultralow-sulfur
diesel and used for transportation,

while the remaining demand is for
heating oil.
Residual fuel oil demand will dip
to average 525,000 b/d from last year‚Äôs
527,000 b/d. Resid, which is mostly
used in electric power generation, has
experienced declining demand in favor
of gas since the early 1980s. Demand
for resid declined 15% last year.
Demand for liquefied petroleum
gases will rebound nearly to their 2008
level, averaging 1.95 million b/d this
year. In 2009, demand for LPG fell 2%
as a result of dismal construction activity and petrochemical demand.

increased production.
US imports of gas will move lower
again this year, but by a much smaller
margin than the 2009 drop. A hike in
imports of LNG was unable to overcome a loss of imports from Canada
and Mexico last year, such that total
imports fell to 3.735 tcf from a total of
3.984 tcf a year earlier.
OGJ forecasts that LNG imports will
climb again this year by almost 5% to total
430 bcf, but that gas imports from Canada
and Mexico will decline again, for a total
decline in imports of almost 1%.

OIL & GAS JOURNAL WELL FORECAST FOR 2010

Canada
December 2009 was the year‚Äôs best
month for drilling permit filings in
Canada with more than 2,100 permits
issued, possibly indicating a turnaround.
Canadian gas drilling levels will depend on how north-of-the-border gas
competes with gas developed in shale
formations closer to markets in the US.
Longer laterals are swelling footage
figures from the Horn River basin shale
plays in Northeast BC to the Montney
combination play in British Columbia
and Alberta to the Bakken oil play in
the Williston basin southern Saskatchewan and Manitoba.
Eastern Canada offshore and land
drilling were at low levels in 2009, but
success in emerging shale gas plays
in Quebec and New Brunswick hint
that at least a few more wells might be
drilled in those areas in 2010.
Several wells in Quebec have tested
gas at respectable rates from Ordovician
Utica shale, but there is no sustained
production from the Utica or the Ordovician Lorraine shale. A few large surface mining projects exist, but almost
Canada‚Äôs entire oil sands resource is
expected to be produced ultimately by
drilling wells, the Canadian Association
of Petroleum Producers noted.

World rigs
The world rig count including North
America fell 34% year to year to 2,408
units in November 2009, Baker Hughes
reported.
Almost 80% of the world‚Äôs active rigs
were working in the Western Hemisphere in that month.
November drilling year to year was
up slightly to 257 rigs in Asia-Pacific
and 68 rigs in Africa and declined to
252 rigs in the Middle East and 86 rigs
in Europe (OGJ, Dec. 21, 2009, p. 64).
India showed a good gain to 98 rigs
from 82 in November 2008, and Venezuela fell to 55 rigs from 80. India‚Äôs
count included 65 land rigs and 33
offshore units. ‚ú¶

EIA reported. ‚ÄúMotor gasoline was

Despite the cold weather that gripped
much of the nation in late December,
average annual distillate fuel consumption declined by 330,000 b/d, or 8.3%,
in 2009, led by a precipitate decline in
transportation usage.‚Äù
Noting that regular gasoline prices
increased from a nationwide monthly
average of $1.79/gal in January 2009
to $2.61/gal in December, the federal
energy forecasting and analysis service
said that it expects those prices to average $2.84/gal in 2010 and $2.96/gal in

‚ÄúPump prices are likely to pass $3/

right places. Our people will be doing a
higher level of review than in the past.‚Äù
Abbey said BLM will continue to accept nominations from producers, adding, ‚ÄúBLM will make the final decision
now on where leases will be offered.
The CX guidance which BLM plans
to issue will be consistent with EPACT‚Äôs
intent and not require additional congressional action, he said.
Salazar said his department offer
for lease more than 50 million acres
offshore and 2 million acres onshore.
‚ÄúThat shows we are moving forward
to develop this country‚Äôs oil and gas
resources beneath the public lands,‚Äù he
said. ‚ÄúWe have no intention of changing that. We are moving forward with
a balanced approach. We don‚Äôt believe
we should be drilling everywhere and
anywhere.‚Äù

‚ÄòDouble-talk‚Äô
Officials from three oil and gas associations immediately protested.
‚ÄúIn what has become increasingly
familiar double-talk from this administration, Interior Secretary Salazar
today again spoke of the importance
of domestic oil and natural gas while
making it more difficult to produce,‚Äù
American Petroleum Institute Pres.
Jack N. Gerard said. ‚ÄúUnder the guise
of offering certainty for investors, [he]
has taken steps to further delay and
limit American energy resources for all
Americans.‚Äù
He noted that since Salazar became interior secretary, revenues from
onshore federal oil and gas leasing in
Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, Utah,
and Wyoming have plunged more than
80%, and the total acreage leased has
shrunk to its lowest level ever.
‚ÄúIn Wyoming alone, nearly 70%
fewer lease acres were issued by the
federal government in 2009 than in
2008,‚Äù Gerard said.
Independent Petroleum Association
of America Pres. Barry Russell said,
‚ÄúWe do not see the need to further
expand the consultation process that
is already in place as it will only lead
to more delay and confusion for small
34

producers.‚Äù
Russell said IPAA also strongly supports using CXs as outlined in EPACT
and believes that efforts to revise or
only allow their use under ‚Äúextraordinary circumstances‚Äù will limit independent producers‚Äô ability to use ‚Äúthese
important and common-sense tools.‚Äù
IPAA believes oil and gas development
decisions are best made in BLM field
offices instead of taking what the group
considers a top-down approach advocated in the new guidelines, he added.
‚ÄúThis initiative will add great bureaucracy, delay and confusion to the
oil and gas leasing process on federal
lands. The current leasing process
on federal lands works, and if small
changes need to be made to the system,
BLM has the ability to make those corrections. The concept of developing a
master leasing plan will only create the
potential for litigation and protest on
every oil and gas lease issued by the
agency,‚Äù Russell warned.

Current system works
Kathleen Sgamma, government
affairs director at the Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States
in Denver, said Interior is ‚Äúmoving to a
bureaucratic command-and-control system in which government bureaucrats,
rather than scientists with expertise in
oil and gas development, dictate where
energy development should occur.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe market-based system has
worked well for decades, allowing government land managers to specify what
lands are appropriate for leasing and
leaving it to the geologists and engineers to do the exploration and nominate projects based on geologic and
market conditions,‚Äù she maintained.
Sgamma said IPAMS hopes BLM career employees with oil and gas experience will be prominent on the team
charged with reviewing permitting and
other aspects of federal onshore oil and
gas leasing.
‚ÄúWe also hope that IPAMS will have a
seat at the table,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOur members have a longer history of developing
natural gas and oil on federal lands in an

environmentally responsible manner.‚Äù
Salazar rejected industry protests.
Citing numbers of lease sales held last
year, he said, ‚ÄúI think those in the
industry who are crying out are crying
out because we‚Äôre being careful and
supporting development in the right
way in the right places.‚Äù

Congressional response
Congressional energy leaders‚Äô responses generally followed party lines.
‚ÄúThrough greater coordination
between agencies, and by providing the
oil and gas industry needed certainty
and clarity up front, we will ensure that
America‚Äôs domestic energy resources
are developed in a fiscally sound and
environmentally sensitive manner,‚Äù said
US House Natural Resources Committee
Chairman Nick J. Rahall (D-W.Va.).
Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman
(D-NM) said Salazar‚Äôs announcement
‚Äúsets out useful and important steps
to ensure appropriate management of
publicly owned energy resources.‚Äù He
said he was particularly pleased that the
secretary was addressing CXs, which
were intended under EPACT to streamline environmental reviews for certain
kinds of energy projects on public lands
but which a Government Accountability Office review this past September
found DOI frequently violating under a
confusing and inconsistent policy.
Congressional Republicans from the
Rocky Mountains were critical.
‚ÄúThis announcement is yet another
indication that the administration has
no intention to honor its promise to
produce a balanced energy plan that
includes domestic energy production,‚Äù
said Sen. Robert B. Bennett (Utah).
‚Äú[DOI] continues to look for ways to
make domestic energy more expensive
to producing by stalling the process for
several years.‚Äù
Sen. John Barrasso (Wyo.) called the
announcement ‚Äúa step in the wrong
direction‚Äù and said, ‚ÄúIncreasing the
bureaucratic hurdles for energy development will only hinder our economic
recovery and discourage job creation.‚Äù

Rep. Rob Bishop (Utah), ranking
member of the Natural Resources Committee‚Äôs National Parks, Forests, and
Public Lands Subcommittee and chairman of the Congressional Western Caucus, said he was particularly frustrated
with new restrictions on CXs, which he
considers one of EPACT‚Äôs biggest successes. Salazar should understand that
CXs under Section 390 are statutory,
not administrative, he said.
‚ÄúThere is nothing in the statutory
language that even mentions extraordinary circumstances; rather, the language is straightforward in mandating
the use of categorical exclusions when
the conditions in the statute are met,‚Äù
he said. ‚ú¶

Interior Sec. Salazar
blasted for ‚Äòkings of the
world‚Äô statement
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
An oil state US House Democrat
strongly criticized Interior Secretary
Ken Salazar for his characterizations of
the oil and gas industry during a teleconference last week with reporters.
Asked about possible criticism of
changes in new onshore leasing policies
he was announcing, Salazar replied: ‚ÄúI
think the difference was that [oil and
gas producers] were essentially kings of
the world in the prior administration.
Whatever they wanted to happen, happened. We brought that to an end because we wanted to protect the public‚Äôs
resources. I expect the shrill responses
from the oil and gas industry will come
anyway.‚Äù
Rep. Dan Boren (D-Okla.), as he
released a letter to Salazar protesting
the changes, said on Jan. 7: ‚ÄúThis kind
of comment is beyond the pale when
thousands of Oklahomans and people
from other energy-producing states are
losing their jobs due to the recession.

A

t first glance, the Jan. 6 letter
to three key federal energy and
environment policymakers from 14
trade associations about possible early
approval of a higher ethanol content in
motor fuels might have seemed routine. But the communication included
a summary of required midlevel ethanol tests that clearly showed how much
work still needs to be done.
The group, which included
the American Petroleum Institute,
National Petrochemical & Refiners Association, petroleum product
retailing and marketing associations,
and manufacturers of automobiles,
boats, and outdoor recreation equipment, expressed concern that the US
Environmental Protection Agency
might decide to prematurely raise the
fuel ethanol limit to 15% from 10%.
‚ÄúWe urge EPA to base its decision
on a complete and sound scientific
record, and we urge [the US Department of Energy] to help provide
this science by spending all the $15
million targeted for expanding and
accelerating midlevel ethanol blends
research in the 2010 appropriations
bill,‚Äù the 14 associations said.

Extend comments
‚ÄúMoreover, EPA should reopen
the E15 waiver comment period to
allow public review of new test data
prior to making a final decision on
the waiver request,‚Äù they told EPA
Administrator Lisa P. Jackson, US
Secretary of Energy Steven Chu, and
Carol Browner, White House coordinator of energy, environmental, and
global climate change policy.
The group‚Äôs recommended tests
are extensive. For light-duty vehicles
alone, they include vehicle fuel stor-

age and handling, onboard diagnostics, base engine durability, catalyst
durability and deterioration, evaporative emissions‚Äô useful life, tailpipe and
exhaust emissions, emission inventory
and air quality modeling, and vehicle
drivability and fuel volatility.
Some tests are already under way.
The Coordinating Research Council is
conducting a broad range of studies, the
‚ÄúAuto/Oil E10+ Test Program for Highway ‚ÄòNon-FFV‚Äô Vehicles,‚Äù funded by the
oil and auto industries with DOE.

Just under way
‚ÄúThis test program was initiated
in 2008 and, with a concerted effort and adequate funding, could be
complete in 2011,‚Äù Greco said in a
Dec. 16, 2009, letter to Gina McCarthy, EPA‚Äôs assistant administrator for
air and radiation. Work is just getting
started in studies of base engine durability and onboard diagnostic systems‚Äô false illuminations, he noted.
Recommended infrastructure
tests in the Jan. 6 letter included
underground storage tanks (USTs),
dispensers, enhanced vapor recovery
equipment, adhesives and seals, and
sensors. For USTs alone, it indicated
that fiberglass reinforced storage tanks
manufactured before 1981 were not
intended to store any ethanol, and
those made in the 1980s and early
‚Äò90s were built to store up to E10 only.
In his letter, Greco also cited the
need for a comprehensive vehicle
testing program including models
from before 2004. He said, ‚ÄúIt is
important to protect consumers by
evaluating the full range of short and
long-term impacts of increasing the
amount of ethanol blended into motor fuels.‚Äù ‚ú¶

to add insult to injury, like he‚Äôs just trying to pile on their misery.‚Äù
Boren noted that independent
producers drill 90% of the nation‚Äôs
oil and gas wells. He said, ‚ÄúThey are
the mom-and-pop outfits that run a
handful of wells, the young entrepreneur seeking to expand his operation,
or the regional company that employs
hundreds or even thousands of people
in communities across the nation. And
quite frankly, they consider this brand
of rancor a slap in the face and a direct
attack on their pride in having helped
build this country‚Äôs economy.‚Äù
During the teleconference, Salazar and US Bureau of Land Management Director Robert V. Abbey said
the changes would provide producers
more certainty because they would
help reduce lease protests and lawsuits.
Industry groups responded that the
new policies would simply create more
delays.

‚ÄòCentral candy store‚Äô
Salazar said, ‚ÄúI think the change is
that in the past, the public lands were
the central candy store where the oil
industry walked in and took what it
wanted. That‚Äôs not how it should be
done. We have to make sure that development is taking place in the right way
at the right time in the right places. Our
people will be doing a higher level of
review than in the past.‚Äù
In his letter, Boren told Salazar that
the new policies not only violate the
2005 Energy Policy Act, for which
the secretary and US President Barack
Obama voted as members of the US
Senate, but also were not consistent
with the administration‚Äôs goal of a US
energy policy that provides more jobs
and strengthens energy security.
‚ÄúWithin the House Natural Resources Committee, I am constantly
reminded why decisions relating to the
development of natural resources are
always best made at the local level,‚Äù the
federal lawmaker wrote. ‚ÄúDeveloping

a master leasing plan under the stewardship of yet another disassociated,
Washington-based regulatory team will
only create potential for litigation and
protest on every oil and gas lease issued
by the agency. This top-down approach
will add greater bureaucracy and costly
delays to an industry so critical to our
nation and our future.‚Äù
Boren said millions of Americans
are employed by the US oil and gas
industry, earning an average $45/hr,
or more than $93,000/year, which he
said is more than double the average
estimate of jobs created by so-called
‚Äúgreen investment.‚Äù
Boren told Salazar: ‚ÄúWhy do policymakers within the administration deny
the connection between your so-called
‚Äòkings of the world‚Äô and the millions
of American jobs they provide? To
these companies and the people behind
them, statements such as your ‚Äòkings
of the world‚Äô comment are a profound
affront.‚Äù ‚ú¶

EPA proposes strictest federal smog standards yet
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The US Environmental Protection
Agency proposed the strictest federal
standards yet for ground-level ozone,
commonly known as smog. The primary standard, which aims to protect
human health, would be 0.06-0.07
ppm over 8 hr. EPA also proposed a
secondary seasonal standard to protect
plants and trees.
The agency said it is proposing
replacing standards set by the administration of former President George
W. Bush that many believed were not
adequate. ‚ÄúUsing the best science to
strengthen these standards is a long
overdue action that will help millions
of Americans breath easier and live
healthier,‚Äù EPA Administrator Lisa P.
Jackson said on Jan. 7.
Jackson announced in September
36

2009 that EPA would reconsider the
existing 0.075 ppm standards that
were set in March 2008. As part of its
reconsideration, EPA said it reviewed
the science that guided the earlier
decision, including more than 1,700
public studies and comments during its
rulemaking process. It also reviewed
the findings of the independent Clean
Air Scientific Advisory Committee,
which recommended standards in the
proposed ranges.
Depending on their final level, the
new standards would yield $13-100
billion in health benefits, according to
EPA. Implementing the proposal would
cost $19-90 billion, it estimated.
Congressional Democrats applauded

Indonesia unveils
long-term oil, gas plan
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Indonesia unveiled a long-term oil
and gas management plan to attract $32
billion in investments for oil and gas
facilities in 2010-14.
About 70% of the spending budget is
targeted for investment in gas facilities, including LNG and LPG refineries,
receiving terminals, and residential
pipeline networks. The remaining 30%
is for oil facilities, including refineries
and rigs.
In 2010, Indonesia is aiming at $2.94
billion in oil and gas investment, while
it expects to increase that total in 2011
to $3.18 billion.
The government sees 2013 as the
peak year for investment in oil and gas,
with a target of $10.57 billion‚Äîmore
than twice the level of investment in
2012 at $4.32 billion.
Kardaya Warnika, former chairman
of regulator BPMigas, said the government would focus on expanding gas in
order to reduce the nation‚Äôs dependency
on oil.
Indonesia‚Äôs oil production lags
behind domestic demand growth.
Imports are costly as the Indonesian
government subsidizes sales on the
domestic market‚Äîa strategy that has
stretched its finances to unacceptable
levels.

Madagascar‚Äôs oil and gas industry, and the signs were not promising as demonstrators rampaged in

(OGJ, Feb. 2, 2009, p. 34).
The trouble erupted when the
government closed a radio station belonging to the opposition party whose
leader, Andry Rajoelina, said two
protesters were killed in the affray.
President Marc Ravalomanana had
earlier accused Rajoelina of promoting the government‚Äôs overthrow and

Joeli Lalaharisaina, acting director general of the Office of National

PT Pertamina reported that it expected
to increase capital spending to $4.15
billion in 2010‚Äîa 77% increase from
2009 (OGJ Online, Nov. 13, 2009).
Meanwhile, Kardaya said gas development by 16 new rigs will continue
until 2014 with an average investment
target of $3.22 billion/year.
‚ÄúNext year, we will kick off the
development of two new gas rigs,
namely in Lapangan Rambutan in
South Sumatra and Pondok Tengah in
West Java, with a total investment of
$2.42 billion,‚Äù said Kardaya, who added
wells drilled by the two new gas rigs
are expected to produce up to 1.02
bscfd of gas.

Gas plants planned
In 2011, Indonesia plans to construct
five natural gas plants: Blok A in Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam, Jambi Merang
in Jambi, Randublatung in Central Java,
Gajah Baru in Natuna, and Kepodang in
East Java.
To process the gas from the rigs,
Indonesia plans to construct LNG and
LPG refineries, with a total investment
of $3.65 billion during the 2010-14.
Oil rigs and refineries will also be
constructed in 2010-14 at a total investment of $3 billion and $6.52 billion,
respectively.
Abdul Qoyum Tjandranegara, former president director of state-owned
gas producer PT PGN, criticized the
government management plan, saying,
‚ÄúBoosting gas production is good, but

it would be a waste if the government
exports gas.
‚ÄúIf we maximize the gas for domestic use, particularly for transportation and domestic use, we will not
need to subsidize fuel as much as we
do now,‚Äù said Qoyum, whose remarks underscored concerns of many
Indonesians.
In January, Indonesia urged gas
producers in the country to maintain
production or produce more gas to
meet rising demand from domestic and
overseas markets.
Previously, Indonesia‚Äôs acting coordinating minister for the economy Sri
Mulyani Indrawati said the government
had put higher priority on gas for the

Moreover, the study challenges

from its 2009 budget.
‚Ä¢ St. Mary Land & Exploration Co.,
Denver, announced a 2010 total budget
of $725 million, of which exploration
and drilling is slated to receive $561
million.

Total, Chesapeake JV
The transaction between Total and
Chesapeake covers 270,000 net acres
of Chesapeake‚Äôs Barnett shale leasehold
that accounts for 700 MMcfd of gas
equivalent of current net production
and proved reserves of 3 tcf of gas
equivalent.
Total will pay $800 million upon the
transaction‚Äôs closing, expected by Jan.
31 and subject to regulatory approvals.
In addition, Total will pay $1.45 billion
by financing 60% of Chesapeake‚Äôs drilling and completion costs in the JV area.
The $1.45 billion obligation is expected
to be fulfilled by yearend 2012.
Chesapeake believes its JV leasehold
position will support drilling 3,100 additional net locations with 6.3 tcf of gas
equivalent of unproved reserves. About
60% of Chesapeake‚Äôs core and Tier 1
leasehold is developed.
Total has the right to acquire a 25%
share in any new acreage that Chesapeake acquires in the Barnett shale until
Dec. 31, 2015. Total and Chesapeake
also agreed to jointly study other Barnett shale opportunities as well as shale
plays in Canada.
Currently, Chesapeake has 20 rigs
working in the Barnett shale, and it
expects to ramp up to about 30 rigs
working there throughout much of
2010.
Christophe de Margerie, Total chief
executive officer, said the agreement
marks Total‚Äôs entry into the US shale
plays. Total currently holds assets in the
Gulf of Mexico.
Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeake‚Äôs
chief executive officer, said Chesapeake
is maintaining its previously announced 2010 production target of 2.6
tcf of gas equivalent.
‚ÄúWe plan to continue to take advantage of our large asset base by pursuing other joint ventures, including

Midcontinent unconventional plays,‚Äù
McClendon said.
Separately, Chesapeake already has

Chesapeake is drilling a well in the
Eagle Ford shale play. McClendon said
he expects production there in about
45 days.

Ultra‚Äôs Marcellus stake
Ultra‚Äôs $400 million Marcellus deal,
expected to close in late February and
retroactive to Oct. 1, 2009, will boost
the company‚Äôs holding in the play to
250,000 net acres with the potential
for 1,800 net drilling locations, said
Michael D. Watford, chairman.
‚ÄúWith this acquisition, we believe
that our net recovered resource in the
Marcellus alone will exceed 8.5 tcfe,
an increase of 3.5 tcfe from current
estimates,‚Äù Watford said.
Ultra Petroleum drilled 30 Marcellus
horizontal wells in 2009, 13 of which
were producing in late December. Initial production rates for the producing
wells average 7.5 MMcfd, and preliminary estimated ultimate recoveries
range from 3.5 to 4 bcf.
The company started 2009 with
288,000 gross (152,000 net) acres in
the Marcellus. Through a combination
of land acquisitions and swaps, including the acquisition to close in February,
it has added more than 192,000 gross
acres, nearly doubling its position to
480,000 gross (250,000 net) acres.
The company‚Äôs expanding core
position is concentrated around Tioga,
Bradford, Lycoming, Potter, Clinton,
and Centre counties.

Berry in West Texas
Berry‚Äôs proved reserve estimates
associated with the properties are 11.2
million boe, 92% of which are in the
Wolfberry, 85% are oil reserves, and
23% are proved developed reserves. In
2010, the acquisition is expected to add
1,300 boe/d to Berry‚Äôs production on
a 12-month annual average. Berry has

identified over 130 drilling locations in
the Wolfberry trend targeting the Spraberry, Dean, Wolfcamp, and Strawn
formations.
Robert Heinemann, president and
chief executive officer, said, ‚ÄúThis acquisition provides Berry with the opportunity to diversify its oil resources
and add a high margin, scalable oil
resource to our portfolio. We believe
the Wolfberry is an excellent fit with
Berry‚Äôs engineering and execution
competencies and complements our
existing stable base of low geologic
risk oil assets. We will be the operator
of 70% of the acquired properties and
plan to transition a new West Texas
focused asset team over the coming
months.‚Äù
Berry is increasing its 2010 capital
budget by an additional $30 million to
range $250-290 million. The company
plans to drill 27 wells on the Permian property, funded from internally
generated cash flow. One rig is currently drilling and Berry expects the
acquired properties to provide selffunded production growth over the
coming years.
Berry expects its 2010 production to
be 32,250-33,000 boe/d, an increase of
8-10% over 2009. In addition, Berry‚Äôs
production from oil assets is expected
to grow 20% by yearend driven by Diatomite and Wolfberry development.
The effective date of the transaction was Jan. 1. Closing is expected in
March, subject to customary conditions.

Newfield, Anadarko in Maverick
Newfield and Anadarko‚Äôs transaction with TXCO involves acreage in the
Eagle Ford and Pearsall shale plays in
southwest Texas.
Newfield will acquire more than
350,000 gross acres in Maverick basin
(300,000 net acres) for $217 million.
Current net production of the assets
being acquired by Newfield is 1,500

Ramirez said the Orinoco belt is
producing more than 532,000 b/d of
16-32¬∞ gravity oil, and he highlighted
several projects aimed at increasing
production.
In particular, the minister mentioned a consortium of Russian companies and PDVSA that aims to produce
450,000 b/d from Junin 6; a JV with
CNPC that will produce 400,000 b/d
from Junin 4; and a project with Petrovietnam at Junin 2 expected to produce
200,000 b/d.

Lodgepole Scallion zone yields oil in North Dakota
Alan Petzet
OGJ Chief Editor-Exploration
Continental Resources Inc., Enid,
Okla., said an initial test of a horizontally drilled section of Scallion limestone in west-central North Dakota
produced at an uneconomic 7-day rate
of 65 b/d of oil and 37 Mcfd of associated gas and plans no further drilling at
present.
Scallion, a lower member of the
Lodgepole formation of Mississippian
age, lies at 9,500 ft just above the Upper
Bakken shale. Continental Resources
also tested the Middle Bakken shale in
the Traxel 1-31H well in Mercer County, ND, but didn‚Äôt encounter meaningful oil shows.
The company drilled one lateral in
each of the two formations and completed the Scallion leg with a multistage
plug-perf style frac.
The Traxel exploratory well on the
little-drilled southeastern perimeter of
the Bakken play ‚Äúestablishes the potential for another producing reservoir
in the Bakken petroleum system of the
Williston basin. Productivity would
have to increase for it to be economic,‚Äù
Continental Resources said.
Continental Resources plans to
monitor activity by other operators
in this part of the play before drilling
more test wells. Scallion has produced
oil since the 1960s from about 2,000 ft
in the North Virden pool in Manitoba
about 100 miles north of the Traxel
well.
The company, which holds 483,000
net acres in the North Dakota Bakken
play, in the past 6 months has added
70,000 net acres of leases strategically
located on the western and eastern
edges of the Nesson anticline as well
as expanding westward into Williams
County, where it is drilling its first
well.
It plans to operate 15 North Dakota

Bakken rigs by mid-2010 compared
with seven at the end of 2009.
Six rigs will be on ECO-Pads, a patented concept of a single drill pad located on the shared boundary of abutting north-south, 1,280-acre spacing
units. Four wells will be drilled from
each ECO-Pad, with one Middle Bakken

and one Three Forks-Sanish well each
into the north unit and a similar pair of
wells into the south unit.
The concept is expected to reduce
well cost and allow for a longer horizontal bore in each well, generating
higher initial productivity and reserves,
Continental Resources said. ‚ú¶

Acquisition is to start by Jan. 15,
2010. The program is designed to
provide seismic data coverage of the
Pulkhana development block as part of
a planned appraisal program. Shooting
on the other two blocks is designed to
confirm known leads and identify new
targets.

Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp., Toronto, said two of three appraisal wells
in Colombia‚Äôs Rubiales field extended
known production into new areas
while two exploratory wells on the
adjacent Quifa block found no hydrocarbons. Both are in the Llanos basin.
The Rub-251 and Rub-366 appraisal
wells on prospect D in northern Rubiales field each cut 31 ft of net pay in
Carbonera with porosities above 30%,
extending the late 2008 D block discovery to the southeast and its continuation onto the Quifa block. They are to
be completed as vertical producers.
Rub-310 is to be converted to an
injection well as its Carbonera section
was water saturated.
Exploratory wells Quifa-15 and 16
on the B and C prospects 15-18 km
northeast of Rubiales production found
good reservoir characteristics in Carbonera but no hydrocarbons. Both are on
the highest part of the structure of the
Rubiales-Quifa area. The company will
conduct seismic inversion to identify
the stratigraphic anomaly that did not
permit migrating oil to reach the area
targeted by the two wells.

Removing and selling
NGL from the produced
gas stream is one on the
ways CO2 enhanced oil
recovery projects can improve their economics.
Production
These projects involve
gas recycling into the
reservoir for maintaining pressure and
improving oil mobility. The recycled
gas absorbs NGL in the
reservoir that can be
recovered with a refrigeration process.
The process involves
refrigerating the gas and
then separating, stabilizing, and recovering the
NGL. A company then can market the
recovered NGL as C3, C3+, C4, and C5+ or
use it to spike the crude.
This article describes the following
aspects of NGL recovery:
‚Ä¢ Process plant required for each
alternative (C3+, fractionated liquids, or
crude spiking).
‚Ä¢ Liquid recoveries for varying

process conditions such as chiller final
temperature.
‚Ä¢ Process property method selection.
‚Ä¢ Process flow diagram with material balance.
‚Ä¢ Approximate costs for different
process alternatives.

The fractionation plant has three distillation towers. The first is a de-ethanizer (de-C2 in Fig. 1) with a reboiler
as the bottom stage. The deethanized
liquids go to the depropanizer (deC3) unit consisting of tower, overhead
condenser reflux-drum, and bottoms
reboiler.
The specification sales propane is
Stream C3 sales in Fig. 1.
The depropanizer bottoms go to
a similar tower, reflux, and reboiler
distillation column. This last distillation
column is a debutanizer (de-C4).
The tower overheads go to butane
sales (Stream C4 sales). The column
bottoms are the light gasoline sales or
C5+ sales.
The de-ethanizer overhead gas after
recompression mixes with the refrigerated gas off the low-temperature
separator. The stream then goes to the
gas-gas shell side of the exchanger and
subsequently the reciprocating compressor-pump tandem combination.

Refining
Mikkel, Kristin, Yttergryta, and Tyrihans fields
in the Norwegian Sea.
Aasgard field lies on the Halten
Bank, about 200 km off mid-Norway
and 50 km south of Heidrun field
(map).
The field consists of Midgard, Smorbukk, and Smorbukk South discoveries.
Midgard straddles Blocks 6507/11 and
6407/2, while the two other deposits
lie in Block 6506/11.
Statoil reports that Aasgard ranks
among the largest developments on the
Norwegian Continental Shelf, embracing a total of 52 wells drilled through
16 seabed templates.
Saga Petroleum discovered Midgard
in 1981, with Statoil finding Smorbukk and Smorbukk South in 1984 and
50

1985, respectively. The two companies
unitized the three fields into a single
production license in 1995, with Statoil
as operator.
On Feb. 8, 1999, the Aasgard A oil
production ship arrived on the field
and became operational on May 19. Gas
production from the semi-submersible
Aasgard B platform began on Oct. 1,
2000.
The overall Aasgard development
consists of:
‚Ä¢ Development of the field.
‚Ä¢ Aasgard transport gas pipeline
from the field to processing at Karsto
north of Stavanger.
‚Ä¢ Karsto expansion.
‚Ä¢ Europipe II gas trunkline from
Karsto to Dornum on the German
coast.
Crude oil, condensate, and natural
gas are produced from Aasgard. Crude
and condensate form Aasgard Blend, a
light oil.
Average production of 200,000 b/d
is pumped from storage tanks into

shuttle tankers, which sail between the
fields and the different refineries.
Gas from Aasgard flows through
Aasgard transport to Karsto processing,
which separates heavier components‚Äî
ethane, propane, butane, and naphthas.
Dry gas is piped to continental Europe.

The sensitivity threshold for individual cracks accepted throughout the
pipeline industry equals 30 mm (1.18
in.) length and 1 mm (0.039 in.) depth.
Limit-state assessments of pipelines
typically present larger dimensions as
critical, arguing these dimensions for
sub-critical flaws are overly conservative.4-6 A sensitivity analysis of EMAT
technology meets the target for detecting sub-critical flaws.
ROSEN studied a combination of
artificial and natural crack-like indications after introducing the EMAT tools
to service,7 finding flaws 20 mm long
and 0.65 mm deep with a probabilityof-detection of 92%. EMAT detected
crack-like anomalies 20 mm long and
0.42 mm deep with a POD of 44%.

defects lay in two joints of

to those found in established
processes for crack evaluation with other inspection
technologies.5 6

Length sizing
A threshold criterion
used on the signal amplitude
determines flaw length. Fig.
5 shows results from sizing
artificial defects of differ60
ent length and depth. Stable
length sizing is possible for
even short defects. The physical size of the applied shear
wave, however, can cause a slightly
larger scattering of length measurement
for short features.
The length determination of cracks
and crack fields is associated with clustering methods to find the fracture mechanical relevant total length. Magnetic
particle inspection applied to a colony
of cracks connected by superficial, shallow surface cracking (0.1-0.3 mm deep)
would consider these cracks connected.
Ultrasonic technologies, in general,
respond only to flaws larger than the
subcritical dimensions. Overcoming
this situation requires a pattern analysis
of the high-resolution data, taking the
noise pattern of the reflection signal
into account.

Clustering

Applying fracture mechanics clustering methodology to MPI (top) and EMAT data yields these images
(Fig. 6).
58

Fracture mechanics methods simplify identification of the crack path on
the surface. A single crack model can,
for instance, represent branch cracks, a
well established methodology described
in several different standards (e.g., API
RP 579). This standard classifies cracks
close to each other by their lengths
(2ci) and their distances from each
other (si). A subsequent step applies

individual findings as interacting or

Such a clustering can apply to the
lateral appearance of the crack colony
visualized by MPI. Applying the clustering to EMAT data and MPI findings of
the same area yields results of comparable quality (Fig. 6).
The upper part of the figure shows
a photograph of MPI results of an
SCC crack field in 16-in. OD pipe.
The picture shows application of the
clustering method for branched cracks
according to API RP 579. The lower
part of Fig. 6 applies the same process
to EMAT data based on an automated
length-sizing algorithm that uses
threshold criteria. Table 1 summarizes
the results. This calculation considers
the three crack colonies as interacting,
since the length of the colony is in
every case larger than the minimum
separation required for noninteraction.

Drillbit offers stabilization, new cutter design
The new Hughes Christensen Quantec
Force line of polycrystalline diamond
compact drillbits features newly engineered stabilization technology and nextgeneration cutters.
Bits promise higher penetration rates,
increased footage, and reduced costs in a
range of drilling environments.
The company says its drillbit has demonstrated stability by using updated design
practices via a proprietary bit dynamics
model to optimize the force distribution
experienced while the bit is in service.
This improvement has helped reduce
the occurrence of destructive bit whirl,
keeping the drilling process efficient and
the cutting structure intact for faster and
longer runs, the firm notes.
The PDC bit line also uses newly engineered and wear-resistant cutters. There
are a variety of cutter choices, depending
on the drilling application. One cutter
type is specifically geared for abrasive for-

mations, while another is engineered for
drilling environments where both abrasion and impact-resistance are required.
Bits are designed for all applications,
including hard, abrasive formations as
well as interbedded shales and sands. The
cutters on the bit can be changed out depending on the formation requirements.

Authors say crisis
forces remain at
work on oil price
If you think stability has returned to the
oil market, two Rice University researchers have a message that should slosh your
coffee: The crisis isn‚Äôt over.
The latest oil-price gyration, say Mahmoud A. El-Gamal and Amy Myers Jaffe,
was part of a lingering triangle of forces
that have shaken economies in the past.
El-Gamal, chair of the Rice economics department, and Jaffe, director of the

Energy Forum of the James A. Baker III
Institute for Public Policy at Rice, treat the
subject in a new book from Cambridge
University Press: Oil, Dollars, Debt, and
Crises. They discussed their thesis recently at the Baker Institute.
Two of the three forces they identify
have received new attention lately: financial trading and oil markets.
‚ÄúFinancial investors think of energy as
an asset class,‚Äù El-Gamal said. In 2004,
with demand for the physical commodity
rising, oil was one of a relatively few tradable assets with prices moving enough to
offer attractive returns, he said.
Oil also seemed to provide protection against a dollar weakening under the
strain of US trade imbalances with China.
So big financial investors, hedge funds,
borrowed heavily to buy oil derivatives in
what El-Gamal called a ‚Äúdouble bet.‚Äù
The increased buying amplified the upswing in oil prices through mid-2008 and
the downswing that followed in a slumping economy.
As Jaffe explained the phenomenon,
‚Äúdollar pessimism‚Äù grew with the US trade
deficit. And the trade deficit grew because
the US had no way to avoid buying oil of
escalating price.
‚ÄúIt was very clear in 2007 that we were
on a collision course with a crisis,‚Äù she
said.
Although the oil industry seems to be
‚Äúbreathing a sigh of relief because the
down cycle only lasted 6 months,‚Äù she
said, instability lingers.
Past crises coincided with the third
force noted by the coauthors: geopolitical
upset, such as the Yom Kippur War in 1973
and the Iranian Revolution in 1979.
In financial and oil markets following
the most recent disorder, E-Gamal warned,
‚ÄúThe dynamics that caused the crisis are
still in place.‚Äù
And, Jaffe pointed out, ‚ÄúIranians are
back in the street.‚Äù

Cold weather saps distillates surplus
Colder weather across much of the northern hemisphere in late December and
early January accelerated the burn-off of a global distillate fuel surplus.
‚ÄúA blast of cold weather was not a necessary condition for global distillate inventories to fall back within bounds, but it will certainly help to speed the process
along,‚Äù said analysts at Barclays Capital Research, a division of Barclays Bank PLC,
London. ‚ÄúWhile average December temperatures hit multiyear lows in some key
heating oil-consuming areas in Europe and Asia, the US winter has so far been
distinctly cold, but the difference from normal conditions has been less extreme.‚Äù
The oil home-heating customer-weighted degree day count for December was
1034, which is 28 degree days colder than normal and 46 degree days more than
last year. While US weather in December was colder than many expected, Barclays
analysts said, ‚ÄúIt has not totally reversed the degree day deficit for the season as a
whole, given the relatively late onset of winter.‚Äù
Nevertheless, they reported Jan. 6, ‚ÄúIn the US alone, the surplus of distillate
above its 5-year average has fallen by more than a third from 40.1 million bbl to
26.5 million bbl over the past 6 weeks. The first estimate using whole-year data is
that US oil demand fell by 696,000 b/d in 2009. We expect an increase of 150,000
b/d in 2010, with recent macroeconomic data suggesting upside risks to that forecast.‚Äù
The Energy Information Administration said commercial US crude inventories
increased 1.3 million bbl to 327.3 million bbl in the week ended Jan. 1‚Äîabove average for the time of year. US gasoline stocks were up 3.7 million bbl to 219.7 million
bbl. Distillate fuel inventories decreased 300,000 bbl to 159 million bbl.
‚ÄúWhile much of the burning up of excess global distillate inventories has been
taking place elsewhere, the US has been playing a more significant part recently.
In the latest data, the US surplus of distillates above the 5-year average shrank by
3.4 million bbl to 26.5 million bbl. Six weeks ago, the surplus stood at 40.1 million
bbl, and hence, more than a third of that surplus has been burnt off in remarkably
quick order. Heating oil inventories have been falling faster than normal over the
past month, and the rate of decline has been particularly marked in the key midAtlantic states,‚Äù said Barclays analysts.
‚ÄúThe total build in US inventories of crude and products (as ever excluding the
‚Äòother oils‚Äô category) has now fallen below 50 million bbl for the first time in over
11 months, with the oil product element of the surplus falling by 4.7 million bbl
over the past week to now stand at just 28.3 million bbl, the lowest surplus since
last March,‚Äù they said.
But if the global distillate surplus is to continue a rapid decline after winter,
demand for diesel must grow in this quarter. Barclays Capital expects this quarter
to ‚Äúshow some significant sequential improvements in trucking mileages and,
hence, in diesel demand.‚Äù They said, ‚ÄúIn turn, that should allow economics to fairly
swiftly complete the winnowing of distillate inventories that weather has accelerated.‚Äù
‚ÄòStrong‚Äô market
The oil market made a ‚Äústrong start‚Äù in 2010 with the 2009 highs at the front of
the price curve topped in early January. Barclays analysts see ‚Äúplenty of support‚Äù
to keep prices ‚Äúwell above $70/bbl‚Äù in the first quarter.
Consensus forecasts for the average price for West Texas Intermediate for 2010
are in the range of $75/bbl, with the lowest call at $65/bbl. But Barclays Capital retains its 11-month-old call for $85/bbl ‚Äúwith upside risks.‚Äù If oil dropped below $70/
bbl for an extended period, it would cause investment shortfalls and project delays
that would likely exacerbate ‚Äúan already tight medium-term picture.‚Äù
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is ‚Äúcapable of dampening
forays‚Äù above $100/bbl. So the ‚Äúextreme upside risks‚Äù are primarily geopolitical,
‚Äúat least until supply side tightness takes equilibrium prices significantly higher in
coming years,‚Äù analysts said. A series of ‚Äúwhat have been relatively slow-burning
issues‚Äù seem likely to ‚Äúcome closer to the boil,‚Äù they said.
As for demand, the economic recovery of members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ‚Äúwill be closely followed, as will the extent
to which emerging demand growth continues its recent frenetic pace,‚Äù analysts
said. ‚ÄúOn the supply side, Russia and Brazil are likely, as ever, to be the main wildcards in terms of the variance between output expectations and actual outcomes.‚Äù

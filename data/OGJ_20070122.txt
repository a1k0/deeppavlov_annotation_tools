Without a cost-effective way to remove high levels of nitrogen, you’ve bypassed
would-be opportunities again and again. Now is the time to stop, go back,
tap into those reserves and start making more money.

BCCK Engineering will help you remove nitrogen from your gas streams quickly, efﬁciently and affordably.
And with nitrogen out of the picture, all that gas — and all those proﬁts — are there for the taking.
Thanks to BCCK, it’s time to get both.

Engineering Your Competitive Edge

We found a way to keep oil rigs drilling 10 times longer.
Will anyone else? Don’t hold your breath.

What problem can we solve for you? One drilling operation was tired of bringing up nothing but worn
bearings. So they asked us to extend the life of these critical components. Today they average 300 hours of
uninterrupted operation, up from just 30. Our metallurgical engineers can find similarly innovative solutions
to the problems you’re facing, then deploy and support them globally. Find out more at kennametal.com.

BP’s US safety culture draws ﬁre in review
BP’s US refinery and corporate safety culture has been severely
criticized in a report by an independent review panel investigating
the explosion last March that killed 15 people and left 170 people
injured at BP’s Texas City, Tex., refinery.
The 374-page report, led by James Baker, former US secretary of
state, said BP management had failed to implement process safety
as a core value across its five US refineries.
“BP has emphasized personal safety in recent years and has
achieved significant improvement in personal safety performance,
but BP did not emphasize process safety. BP mistakenly interpreted
improving personal injury rates as an indication of acceptable process safety performance at its US refineries,” the report concluded.
Employees working at BP refineries in Texas City; Toledo, Ohio;
and Whiting, Ind., did not feel comfortable about communicating with management about safety issues, according to the panel,
which said safety culture appears to be improving at Texas City and
Whiting.
Neither did BP ensure that there were sufficient resources to
underpin a strong process safety performance, the report added,
stating, “BP does not have a designated, high-ranking leader for
process safety dedicated to its refining business.”
The panel was unable to conclude whether BP had problems
with its safety culture because of cost-cutting. “BP tended to have
a short-term focus, and its decentralized management system and
entrepreneurial culture have delegated substantial discretion to US
refinery plant managers without clearly defining process safety expectations, responsibilities, or accountabilities,” the panel wrote.
The report also criticized the company’s delay in adopting engineering practices that could otherwise improve safety culture.
BP’s accident was the worst in US industrial history for the past 2
decades, but the US refining industry has lower accident rates than
US manufacturing, the American Petroleum Institute said. In 2004,
the rate of job-related injuries and illnesses for US petroleum refinery workers, as compiled by the US Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, was 1.5 for every 100 full-time employees, compared with a rate of 6.6 for all US manufacturing employees.
John Browne, the chief executive of BP who last week announced a surprise early retirement from the role in July, denied
cost-cutting was responsible for the failings. Browne has insisted
that his departure is not related to the report.
A Citigroup research analyst note said Tony Hayward, Browne’s
successor, will need to focus on making changes in the company
following the Baker report, rebuild BP’s US reputation, safeguard
TNK-BP’s assets, deliver on growth, and restore market confidence
in BP.
BP has committed to implementing the report’s recommenda-

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

tions and has initiated some measures, which include:
• Creating a senior executive team to support and oversee process safety, integrity management, and operational integrity initiatives.
• Forming a Safety and Operations division to establish group
operations and process safety standards and auditing safety and operations performance.
• Empowering the chairman and president of BP America to
monitor BP’s US operations and compliance with regulatory requirements and company standards and to rectify problems when
they are identified.
• Appointing retired federal Judge Stanley Sporkin to receive,
investigate, and resolve concerns raised by BP staff and contract
workers in the US.
• Investing $1.7 billion/year during 2007-10 to improve the
integrity and reliability of refining assets in the US. The company
spent $1.2 billion in 2005.

DPC chair warns against tax, royalty increases
Increasing oil and gas producers’ tax and royalty costs to fund
future conservation and alternative energy efforts would also have
near-term supply impacts damaging to consumers, the chairman
of the Domestic Petroleum Council warned on Jan. 16.
Charles Davidson, who also is chairman, president, and chief
executive of Noble Energy Inc., Houston, made that point in response to provisions in HR 6, which House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles B. Rangel (D-NY) and Natural Resources
Committee Chairman Nick J. Rahall (D-W.Va.) introduced 4 days
earlier.
The largest US independent oil and gas producers, represented
by DPC, “invest more than they earn each year—over the past 5
years, twice their earnings—to apply leading-edge technology to
find and develop energy supplies that are essential for our economy
and our consumers,” Davidson said in a letter to House members.
“The good news is that especially with respect to natural gas, we
have abundant resources in North America. With access to them,
and with stable tax and other policies, we can approach self-sufficiency.”
Drilling is at record levels, reserves are growing, and production
is essentially steady, according to Davidson.
“There is movement toward accessing more-promising areas
that will make substantial improvements in our energy outlook,
including the offshore as a result of the Gulf of Mexico Energy
Security Act passed by Congress and signed into law late last year.
And our energy permitting and related processes are becoming
more efficient,” he said.
“We must do more in all these areas, not slow our progress or
reverse it.”

Recently mild weather has masked a
delicate gas supply-demand balance while
allowing producers to increase reserves, he
continued. Denial of access to promising
areas has forced producers to focus their
efforts on smaller reservoirs and formations that are more difficult to produce.
“The result is that well decline rates are
32%/year and accelerating. That means
we must drill more wells every year just
to maintain production levels,” Davidson
said.
DPC members and other US independent producers face rising drilling and service costs as they pursue these projects, he
added. Meanwhile, earnings, which had
reached a level that produced adequate
returns after years of underperformance
relative to other businesses, are heading
downward with falling oil and gas prices.
“Increasing taxes and royalties on these
companies now will almost certainly force
reductions in drilling budgets. That will
quickly lead to falling production and
higher prices for all gas consumers,” Davidson warned.
In its latest short-term energy outlook,
issued on Jan. 9, the US Energy Information Administration said warm weather in

December reduced space-heating demand
and kept gas prices from rising. “With
about 16% fewer heating degree days than
normal in December, the Henry Hub spot
natural gas price averaged $6.97/Mcf for
the month,” it said.
In the longer term, the federal energy
forecasting and analysis service expects
Henry Hub spot prices to increase from an
average $6.94/Mcf in 2006 to $7.06/Mcf
in 2007 and $7.72/Mcf in 2008.
EIA currently expects domestic gas
consumption to grow 2.4% in 2007 from
2006, when demand was 1.3% lower than
in 2005. US gas production, which grew
2.4% in 2006 from 2005, is forecast to
increase by a more moderate 1.9% during 2007, according to the January 2007
Short-Term Energy Outlook.

Gas exports to Georgia start
Azerbaijan’s Azarigaz began exporting
natural gas Jan. 11 along the HaciqabulQazax-Tbilisi trunk line to Georgia, which
is seeking to reduce its dependence on increasingly expensive Russian supplies.
The State Oil Co. of the Azerbaijani Republic will initially supply 3 million cu
m/day of gas from Jan. 11-21 at a cost of

$120/1,000 cu m. By the end of January, gas from Azerbaijan’s
Shah Daniz field will be supplied to Georgia via the Baku-TbilisiErzurum pipeline.
Georgia is expected to require 1.8 billion cu m of gas in 2007
and had an agreement with Russia’s OAO Gazprom to supply 1.46
billion cu m this year. But on Nov. 2, 2006, Gazprom announced
that prices for the Georgian market could more than double in
2007 to $230/1,000 cu m from $110/1,000 cu m. As Georgia
balked at paying the new price, Gazprom threatened to cut off supplies.
Meanwhile, to bolster its energy security, Georgia is reportedly
considering plans to repair its main gas lines and to build a gas
storage facility in the southern Ninotsminda district initially capable of storing as much as 500 million cu m of gas.
US-financed Millennium Challenge Corp. will undertake a feasibility study of the project, which is expected to attract foreign investors. The potential site was recently viewed by Lasha Shanidze, presi-

Exploration

&

dent of the local Millennium Challenge Georgia Fund (MCGF).
Last November, MCGF formally launched its Energy Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project after signing contracts with Georgian
and Azerbaijani firms for repairs on the six most hazardous sections of the country’s North-South gas pipeline.
On Nov. 3, 2006, MCGF entered into two, 120-day contracts for
the repair work with Georgia’s Geoengineering and Azerbaijan’s
Khazardenizneftegaztikint.
The Azeri firm will work on the northern section of the gas
main and accomplish urgent repair works on four sites, while the
Georgian company will work on the remaining two sites in the
south section of the pipeline.
John F. Tefft, US Ambassador to Georgia, said the repairs would
increase gas supplies to Georgia and neighboring Armenia by reducing the threat of breaks, leaks, and emissions. He said the project is one of several supported by the US government with a view
to enhancing Georgian energy security. ✦

Development

Statoil’s Alve ﬁeld to produce in late 2008
Statoil ASA plans to spud a well on Aug. 1 and start production
in December 2008 from its Alve gas-condensate field in the Norwegian Sea.
At its peak, Alve is expected to produce 4 million cu m/day of
gas. The field’s reserves are pegged at 6.78 billion standard cu m
and 8.3 million boe of condensate.
The field’s development will be phased in via a tieback to Statoiloperated Norne field using a single subsea template with four drilling slots. Statoil has informed the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy that it will spend about $310 million on Alve.
The development will exploit available capacity on the Norne
production ship and in the Aasgard transport gas trunkline, said
Jostein Gaasemyr, operations vice-president for Alve. Urd satellite
field was tied back to Norne in 2005, and developing Alve requires
some modifications to the Norne ship.
Alve lies in PL 159B and is 16 km southwest of Norne field in
390 m of water. Alve comprises the Garn, Not, Ile, and Tilje formations, with proved reserves lying in Garn and Not.
Statoil holds a 75% share in Alve. Other licensees are Danish Oil
& Natural Gas 15% and Norsk Hydro AS 10%.

Heritage and Tullow Oil have a 50:50 interest in the block. Heritage plans to gather 270 sq m of 3D seismic over the Kingfisher
structure during the first half of 2007. The partners are appraising other options to carry out more exploration on Kingfisher and
other prospects in Lake Albert.
Last November, the upper zone of the Kingfisher-1 well tested
at a stabilized flow rate of 4,120 b/d through a fixed 1-in. choke
at a flowing well head pressure of 221 psi. The 30° gravity oil was
sweet with a low gas-oil ratio and some associated wax (OGJ Online, Nov. 7, 2006).

Firms submit plan to redevelop Yme oil ﬁeld
Talisman Energy Norge AS and license partners in PL 316, Revus
Energy and Pertra, have informed the Norwegian energy ministry
that they wish to redevelop Yme oil field in the Norwegian North
Sea.
Under their proposed plan, the partners expect to be able to
produce 50-60 million bbl of oil from the field, depending on
future oil prices. Estimated investment costs are more than $629.1
million to produce a maximum of 40,000 b/d of oil.
Stein Fines, vice-president, technology and health, safety, and
environment for Pertra, one of the smaller partners in the Yme proposal, told OGJ there are 66 million bbl of oil to be recovered. Yme
field will be redeveloped using 12 production and injection wells
and a production platform with a jack up unit and subsea storage
tank.
Start of production is expected in January 2009 and this is the
first time in Norway that an abandoned field would be redeveloped.
Single Buoy Moorings Inc. has received a letter of intent from
the partners to provide and lease a newbuild production facility.
Drilling production wells would begin next summer using the
Maersk Giant jack up rig.

Heritage Oil has found oil-bearing zones totaling 40 m in its
Kingfisher-1A sidetrack well on Uganda’s Block 3A in Lake Albert.
The block spans 1,991 sq km.
The company will test the zones when it finishes drilling the
well, which has reached 2,962 m and has been cased to 2,502 m.
A spokesman for partner Tullow Oil told OGJ that it is negotiating
with companies to secure a rig to drill to 3000-4000 m TD over
the next 45 days
Heritage Oil said: “The Kingfisher prospect is a very large structural high that is expressed at surface on the bed of Lake Albert.”
Seismic data indicate the Kingfisher prospect has an area extent of
up to 70 sq km, although the Kingfisher-1A well will only explore KPO lets contract for fourth Karachaganak train
Karachaganak Petroleum Operating BV (KPO) let an engineera limited part of this structure, it said.

ing, procurement, construction, and commissioning contract to oil
services provider Petrofac of Aberdeen to add a fourth stabilization
and sweetening train at the Karachaganak Processing Complex in
northwest Kazakhstan. The train will process gas and condensate
from Karachaganak oil and gas-condensate field. The contract’s
value was not disclosed.
Liquids capacity at the complex will increase to 10.3 million
tonnes from 7.7 million tonnes after installation of the train, which
is scheduled for completion in mid 2009.
The new facility will consist of pipeline, slug catcher, condensate stabilization, gasoline sweetening, export oil facilities, flash gas
compression, gas dehydration and dew pointing, export gas compression, flare, and utilities, a Petrofac spokesman told OGJ.
This agreement follows Petrofac’s successful completion of the
development’s front-end engineering design study carried out last
year.
Karachaganak field has gross field reserves of more than 2.4
billion bbl of oil and condensate, and 48 tcf of gas. Liquids are
exported south via the 28.2 million tonne/year Caspian Pipeline
System to the Black Sea near Novorossiysk in Russia and are then
exported to western markets.
BG International operates the field on a joint basis with Eni SPA,
and each company holds a 32.5% share in KPO. Other partners
are Chevron Corp., with a 20% stake, and OAO Lukoil with a 15%
stake.

Coastal Tanzania gets gas discovery
Maurel & Prom, Paris, reported a stabilized gas flow rate of 19.2
MMcfd in 4 hr from the Upper Cretaceous Ruaruke formation at
2,030 m in the Mkuranga-1 exploration well in coastal Tanzania.
The flow came on a 48⁄64-in. choke with a maximum pressure
of 1,465 psi. Longer-term tests were being run. Maurel & Prom’s
interest is 60%.
The wellsite is 5 km from the gas pipeline to Dar-es-Salaam
from Songo Songo gas field, Tanzania’s only producing area.

Indonesia to offer 30 blocks in 2007
Indonesia plans to offer 30 new oil and gas blocks later this
year, mostly in the deep waters of Papua and Nusa Tenggara, along
with a package of incentives for investors.
R. Priyono, the energy ministry’s director for the upstream oil
and gas industry, said the blocks would be offered through a regular tender and direct offer mechanism, scheduled to start in May
or June.
By way of incentives, Priyonoi said companies could return
their exploration rights to the government if they consider their
areas unpromising after 2-3 years of exploration.
Priyono also said the government would announce in February
the results of 20 tenders held in August 2006.
Blocks put up for tender at the time are in Madang, South
Mandar, Sageri, and South Sageri, all off the South Sulawesi coast;
Enrekang, onshore in South Sulawesi; and Karama, Malunda, and
Mandar, off West Sulawesi. ✦

Production

Shah Deniz gas, condensate production restarted
Gas production has resumed from the first well at the Shah Deniz gas field off Azerbaijan, a BP spokesman told OGJ. The project
was shut in late in December because of problems with pressures
in the wells (OGJ Online, Jan. 10, 2007).
According to press reports from Azerbaijan, State Oil Co. of
Azerbaijan, a partner in Shah Deniz, said the field is producing 3.2
million cu m/day of gas and 1,300 tonnes/day of gas condensate.
The $4.5 billion project, in the Azerbaijan sector of the Caspian
Sea, will export gas to Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey via the $1.3
billion, 700 MMcfd South Caucasian Pipeline.
Georgia and Azerbaijan have been eager to receive the gas following the recent demands by Russia’s OAO Gazprom for higher
gas prices. Shah Deniz represents a degree of independence from
Russia. But Georgia was forced to sign temporary gas supply deals
with Gazprom at prices it considered exorbitant in December while
Shah Deniz gas production was suspended.
The BP spokesman said Shah Deniz will continue to ramp up
production to plateau levels next year, and the field is expected to
produce 8.6 billion cu m of gas in the winter of 2007-08.
Shah Deniz holds 25-35 tcf of gas and in Stage 1 will produce
37,000 b/d of condensate, which will be shipped to Ceyhan, Turkey, for processing (OGJ, Aug. 21, 2000, p. 68).

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Central and East Java will start producing oil in first quarter 2009,
one quarter later than originally scheduled (OGJ, Sept. 11, 2006,
Newsletter).
Trijana Kartoatmodjo, deputy head of the upstream oil and gas
regulatory body BP Migas, said the block, operated by ExxonMobil
Corp. and state-owned PT Pertamina, would produce 25,000 b/d
of oil, eventually rising to 165,000 b/d.
Trijana said the delay in the block’s operation had been caused
by problems in clearing land, with opposition coming from locals
who have concerns about environmental damage.
The government has been anxious to speed up development
of the oil field to help curb declining oil output in the face of
increased domestic demand. A net importer of oil since late 2004,
Indonesia wants Pertamina to raise its oil production to 250,000300,000 b/d from 140,000 b/d.
The Indonesian economy has been hard-hit by financing the
gap between domestic sales and price rises on the international
market over the past year. Indonesia pays market rates for imported
oil, but it subsidizes domestic consumption.

Apache’s Alexandrite 1X well to start production

Apache Corp. reported that its Alexandrite 1X well in the Matruh
concession in Egypt’s Western Desert has flowed 19.8 MMcfd of gas
and 4,045 b/d of condensate, indicating that it is commercial.
Oil production from Java’s Cepu block delayed
The well will begin commercial production next week from a
Indonesian officials say the Cepu block in the border area of recompletion in the Alam El Bueib 6 (AEB 6) formation.

Within the new interval, Apache tested 37 ft of net pay in two
AEB 6 segments between 12,112 ft and 12,198 ft. The test was
conducted with 1,650 psi of flowing wellhead pressure through
a 1-in. choke.
Alexandrite 1X was drilled to a depth of 15,300 ft in 2003 and
it previously produced hydrocarbons from a Jurassic Upper Safa
formation, which have totaled 3 bcf of gas and 514,000 bbl of
condensate since November 2003.
Apache said the nearest AEB 6 production is in its Emerald field,
about 30 km east of the Alexandrite 1X well.
An Apache spokesman told OGJ that the gas would be used domestically. Apache is planning additional drilling for Jurassic and
AEB targets in the Alexandrite 1X area in 2007.

ing vessel in Espadarte oil field in the Campos basin.
The new unit, under contract from MODEC International LCC,
is 320 m long, 54 m wide, and 30 m tall. It is installed in 1,350 m
of water and has a capacity of 100,000 b/d of oil and 2.5 million
cu m/day of gas. It can store 1.6 million bbl of oil.
The unit is expected to reach its full production capacity this
year. When operating at full capacity, it will be connected to nine
subsea wells, five of which produce oil and gas while the other
four are for water injection.
The FPSO is equipped with an oil-pumping system developed
by Petrobras Research Center. The subsea centrifuge pumping system, or S-BCSS, assists in lifting the oil from the field to the vessel.
Compared to traditional systems, it is installed externally to the

West Hawk, Lu’An to develop China coal projects
West Hawk Development Corp., Vancouver, BC, and Shanxi

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
Lu’An Coal Mining (Group) Co. Ltd. of Changzhi City, China, have
agreed to jointly develop an underground coal gasification system
to produce clean liquids and electric power.
This agreement strengthens an earlier memorandum of understanding between the companies to develop a coal gasification
project and to review certain coal resources owned by Shanxi Lu’An
Mining Group. The partners want to determine the best resources
available for a conventional integrated gasification combined cycle
electrical power plant and a coal-to-liquids plant.
Lu’An Mining will dedicate 500 million tons of coal property
toward the underground gasification development and both companies are working on a program to advance this technology. ✦

Transneft completes ﬁrst ESPO pipeline section

BG Group to add two LNG vessels to ﬂeet

Russia’s state-owned OAO Transneft reported it has constructed
about 530 km of the planned 4,188-km East Siberia Pacific Oil
Pipeline (ESPO).
Construction on the pipeline, which is intended to serve the
Asia-Pacific region, is currently under way between Taishet and
Ust-Kut in the Irkutsk region and Tynda and Skovorodino in the
Amur region along the Chinese border.
A spokesman for Transneft’s project management center said the
company also established storage facilities and operation bases during 2006 along the pipeline.
He said the firm is thus positioned to start extending ESPO quickly on the basis of feasibility studies made and approved in 2006. He
said Transneft plans to lay about 1,250 km of the pipeline in 2007.
A feasibility study of the first extension between Ust-Kut and
Talakan field already has been approved, while studies of the TyndaAldan and Talakan-Aldan segments and the Kozmino special seaport are to be assessed early this year.
On the supply side, Transneft last year authorized Urals Energy
Public Co. Ltd.’s Dulisma oil field to be connected to the pipeline
(OGJ Online, Nov. 14, 2006).

BG Group PLC has signed an agreement with South Korea’s
Samsung Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. for the delivery of two newbuild dual-fuel diesel-electric (DFDE) LNG vessels.
The design of the 170,000 cu m capacity carriers incorporates
hull modifications and DFDE propulsion technology, which is expected to improve operating efficiency and reduce air emissions
compared with conventional steam turbine technology.
Samsung will build, equip, launch, and deliver the ships using
the GTT Mark III membrane cargo containment system. Both ships
are scheduled for delivery in 2010.
BG says the new vessels will replace some of its chartered ships.
BG has an additional four vessels, each with 145,000 cu m of capacity, under construction at Samsung’s South Korea shipyard.These
ships are scheduled for delivery this year and in early 2008. ✦

One of the surprises this year is the

requiring outside counsel. “Partly this
is an outgrowth of our modern regulatory and enforcement climate in which
companies are put on fast-track notice
by government agencies that an action
may be forthcoming, which prompts
them to conduct a full-scale investigation,” said Stephen C. Dillard, chair of
Fulbright & Jaworski’s global litigation
practice.
“The surge in investigations is also
an inevitable consequence of the big
corporate meltdowns that have occurred in recent years,” Dillard said.
“Management and corporate boards
have become much more proactive at
taking the lead in policing themselves

liability. Whether borne from the fear
of enforcement, litigation, or negative
publicity, internal investigations are
actually a means of containing future

Oil and instability
The next time anyone complains about oil from
“unstable” countries, check the US Congress. With
their Clean Energy Act of 2007, House Democrats
test new limits for instability.
The bill, introduced Jan. 12, would:
• Deny oil and gas producers and refiners use
of the manufacturing tax deduction enacted in the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.
• Extend by 2 years the 5-year amortization
period for geological and geophysical expenditures by major integrated oil companies. In 2005,
Congress refused to allow expensing of G&G costs,
formerly amortized over the lives of producing
properties, but agreed to shorten the amortization
period to 2 years for most producers and 5 years
for large integrated companies.
• Coerce holders of deepwater Outer Continental Shelf leases issued during 1998 and 1999
into renegotiation to set oil and gas price limits
on deepwater royalty relief. Leases issued in those
years omitted price thresholds contained in agreements of different vintage. Under the House measure, companies not renegotiating threshold-free
leases would have to pay stiff fees or be excluded
from future OCS leasing in the Gulf of Mexico.
• Repeal incentives in the Energy Policy Act of
2005 (EPACT) for gas production from deep wells
on the Gulf of Mexico shelf and for oil and gas
production in deep water.
• Repeal an EPACT cap on fees for drilling-permit applications while a permit-streamlining pilot
project is under way.
• Shorten the terms of leases issued in the
National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, and repeal
authority for exploration and production incentives in the area.
• Use revenue generated by the new measure
to pay for federal promotion of renewable and
alternative energy sources and conservation.
This mischief isn’t energy policy. It’s punishment. Oil and gas companies provoked public
outrage by reporting inevitably high profits after
gasoline prices spurted in an extraordinarily
strained market. Although prices have fallen by
one-third since then, a newly Democratic Congress wants oil-company blood.
If the House bill passes, oil and gas companies

will have to degrade investments in US energy
supply for the hikes in taxation and political risk.
They’ll have to distrust the US government as a
contract partner. They’ll have to evaluate the large,
long, and risky investments essential to energy
supply while wondering what a capricious Congress might do next. This combination of horrors will constrain domestic supply of the energy
forms that last year satisfied 63% of US demand.
Oil exporters habitually disparaged in the US
as unstable at least see their interests clearly. They
have to sell oil. Their economies depend on it. The
US economy depends on a ready supply of affordable energy, largely oil and gas. Politics can only
nibble at the edges of this dependency. Vindictive laws that discourage the development of oil
and gas supply contradict the country’s economic
interests. Laws that try to replace oil and gas with
costlier fuels waste resources and hurt consumers.
Proposals for such laws would not emerge from
a Congress led by politicians clear about their
country’s energy interests. They reflect instability.
Normally, it falls to the Senate to defend the
republic from political lurches of the House. On
Jan. 4, however, Democratic senators introduced
a bill endorsing steps as sublime as “eliminating
tax giveaways to large energy companies” and
“preventing energy price-gouging.” From such a
group, little sophisticated guidance can be expected.
The last defense against an energy future contorted by senseless political manipulation thus may
be the presidential veto. George W. Bush in fact
inspired energy lunacy last year with state-of-theunion assertions about a national addition to oil.
He can redeem himself on this subject by snuffing
the mistakes Congress wants to make.
How Democrats would caterwaul about that!
“He’s doing it for the oil companies,” they’d say. To
which Bush, if he’s on his game, could respond,
“Oil companies can take care of themselves. I’m
keeping Congress from hurting consumers and
taxpayers.”
With that statement he would begin to reorient
energy policy-making to the public interests from
which it has strayed and rescue discussion of the
subject from political opportunism. ✦

insufficient import capacity. Today regulators and industry personnel are crossing their fingers in hopes the winter
will remain mild, keeping gas demand
relatively low. Virtually everyone agrees
that import capacity should be boosted
by building LNG terminals and laying
additional pipelines or increasing the
size of existing lines.
Just one LNG regasification terminal
exists in Italy. Operated by Eni SPA, it
has a capacity of 4 billion cu m/year
compared with demand of 86 billion
cu m in 2005. Eleven projects for LNG
terminals have been submitted for authorization, two of which—in Rovigo
and Brindisi—have been authorized and
four that are expected to receive final
authorization soon.
The authorization process for Rovigo
began in 1997 when the terminal was
planned to be onshore. However opposition of local groups was so vocal that

it convinced Edison Gas SPA, the company in charge of building the terminal,
to move the projected facility offshore.
In the meantime, Edison formed a
partnership—Edison 10%, ExxonMobil
Corp. 40%, and Qatar Petroleum Co.
40%—to build and run the terminal.
Local governments still held that the
terminal was harmful to the environment and to the local economy, particularly to tourism. The legal battle is
continuing, even though the companies involved have consistently won,
and construction of the terminal has
begun. Because of high legal costs and
increased expenditures associated with
building it offshore, the terminal costs
more than doubled—from €450 million to €800 million and then to the
latest estimate of over €1 billion. As
far as the timing is concerned, it took
almost a decade to get authorizations
for a terminal whose construction will

require 2 years. The terminal was to
become fully operational in 2008 if
no further obstacles were encountered.
Unfortunately, on Sept.18, 2006, when
the regasification plant—which was
being built in Spain—was 50% complete, construction was stopped for an
apparent lack of authorization for a
secondary, temporary structure, and a
new legal battle began.
The Brindisi project is in a much
worse predicament. The €400 million
regasification plant, on which €150
million has already been spent, received
its “definitive” authorization in 2002,
but it is still unclear whether prospective operator British Gas will ever be
able to actually build it. In an interview
with Il Corriere della Sera, Italy’s most
influential daily magazine, on Sept.
11, 2006, Nichi Vendola, head of the
regional government of Puglia, where
Brindisi is located, said the plant ob-

tained approval of both the Brindisi City
Council and the Puglia regional government, along with 21 other governments
or agencies, but “thereafter the administrations were kicked out of office.”
Vendola said, “ That means that their
decisions didn’t satisfy local populations. Hence they have to be changed.
It is not by chance that current administrations have been voted precisely
because of their opposition to the LNG
terminal.”
As to the other submitted projects,
most of them are unlikely to be built.
That leads to the paradox of a virtual
oversupply of gas vis-à-vis a gas scarcity,
as former Industry Minister and Editorin-Chief of the specialized magazine Energia Alberto Clò, wrote. The same may
be said of electric power generation.
For example, Enel has been struggling
for months to convert an old oil-fueled
plant into a more-efficient coal-fueled
facility. The delays again result from
legal actions and political opposition
from local and regional governments.
Even when the authorization process
was faithfully followed, local, provincial, and regional governments, as well
as environmental or consumer organizations and other pressure groups
have filed lawsuits, known to be lost in
advance, that can be used to stop work
in progress and increase monetary and
time costs. Hence, they become a disincentive to investors, as the real cost of
investments in such a crucial sector as
energy is significantly increased.

A way out?
Italy’s problem—which is partly
shared by other EU member states, but
which in Italy reaches an unsustainable
level—is twofold: On one hand, local
populations scarcely involved in the
decision-making process and who gain
almost no benefit from it have an incentive to oppose any project.
On the other hand, the decisionmaking process is too confused, and too
many subjects hold a de facto right to
veto any decision. For example, in the
case of Brindisi, 23 different subjects
have been involved in the decision22

making process.
A recent piece of incentive legislation promoted by Minister of Economic
Development Pierluigi Bersani moves
in the right direction: It would reduce
the level of energy taxation for those
communities that allow a power plant
to be built in their territory. While the
attempt to create an economic incentive
to oppose the NIMBY (not in my back
yard) effect is a good move, it is not
enough. Other amendments in the current legislation can help to make more
socially acceptable those plants that are
required to strengthen Italy’s energy
security.
• Companies should be allowed to
sell electricity or gas to local consumers
at a discounted rate to increase the economic incentive. Such discounts should
be tax-deductible for the companies.
• A principle of “administrative
continuity” should be enforced: Once an
administration has given its approval to a
project, it shouldn’t be allowed to reverse
the decision, even when the governing
coalition changes after elections.
• When an authorization is released,
a mandatory period of 180 days should
be left for those who still have complaints to seek an adjustment with the
operating company. If a negotiation
round is made possible and compulsory,
the parties might find it more convenient to take advantage of it, rather than
assuming the costs of litigation.
• After authorization becomes effective, it should still be possible to file
appeals, but they should not be allowed
to stop work in progress except for the
most serious reasons. It should be up to
the company to choose between going
on and stopping temporarily—if the
company knows that the appeal is just a

pretext to delay the work, then it could
resume construction.
What Italy and the rest of Europe
need is not revolutionary change, but
common sense amendments to current
legislation. A recent survey by the World
Bank shows that, as far as ease of doing
business is concerned, Italy ranks 82nd,
down from 69th in 2005. In terms of
licensing procedures, it ranks 104th. To
secure the necessary licenses to start a
business, an Italian company needs, on
average, to clear 17 procedural hurdles—as opposed to an Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average of 14—to wait
for 284 days (149.5 in OECD) and to
spend 142.3% of per capita income
(72% in OECD).
The consequence is that Italy’s energy system is weak, and an energy crisis
is always looming. This is not about a
lack of capital or companies willing to
invest in the country. This is because of
perverse incentives that are set up by
an overwhelming, confused, antimarket
regulatory environment. ✦

The European Commission has
proposed enforcing full ownership
unbundling of gas and electricity infra-

structure via new legislation as one of
its measures to help facilitate an internal
energy market in Europe.

functional internal energy market to
ensure competitive and secure energy
supplies.
However, the European Union is
likely to miss its deadline in July to
have a fully opened internal market, as
many member states are now involved
in infringement procedures launched
by the EC for failing to implement the
directives to meet this objective.
According to the EC’s sectoral
enquiry launched to investigate the
progress of energy liberalization across
the EU, European Commission Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said
there was danger of discrimination and
abuse when companies control energy
networks as well as production or sales
because they protect national markets
and prevent competition.

partners. The proposal is “radical,” the
source said, adding that the tone of the
sectoral report was very negative and
had not recognized the levels of progress made in improving competition by
industry participants.
But the European Federation of
Energy Traders welcomed the focus on
unbundling, saying it was crucial “to
achieving nondiscriminatory access to
transmission infrastructure and services
and to facilitating cross-border trade.”
According to an analysis by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the recommendations offer energy and utility companies
various possibilities to restructure and
expand their EU-wide position, bringing nearer the potential for customerfocused transnational energy and utility
businesses.

Nabucco gas pipeline, which will bring
Caspian gas to central Europe, will be
treated as a priority by four new European coordinators, and new European
energy projects planning and approval
procedures will be fast-tracked under a
5-year program.
The EC said it would examine the
need to increase funding for the Energy
Trans-European networks and establish a new community mechanism
and structure for Transmission System
Operators, responsible for coordinated
network planning.

Security of supplies
Imported oil and gas are expected to
constitute a respective 90% and 80% of
Europe’s energy mix in 2030. “Electricity generation will be heavily dependent
on gas. Without a significant technology breakthrough, oil will continue to
dominate transport. Therefore, security
of supply of these fuels will continue to
be paramount to the EU economy,” the
EC said.
The package will promote diversity
of energy suppliers, particularly among
member states that are wholly reliant
upon one supplier. Measures to achieve
this include developing projects to
bring gas from new regions, establishing gas hubs in central Europe and the
Baltic states, improving the use of strategic storage possibilities, and encouraging the building of LNG terminals.
The package is yet to be approved
by the EU’s 25 members, but this is the
first time that Europe has formulated
an energy policy, which has previously
been left to individual member states to
define and implement. ✦

EBRD withdraws ﬁnancial support for Sakhalin-2
Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
The European Bank for Reconstruction & Development (EBRD) will not
offer financial support for the contro24

versial Sakhalin-2 oil and gas project in
Russia following the change in majority
control of Sakhalin Energy Investment
Co. (SEIC), the company behind the
$20 billion proposal. Over the past 5
years, EBRD had reviewed the project

and was considering offering a $300
million syndicated loan to SEIC.
EBRD said, “If the new group of
shareholders were to request it and
make a case that the project could be
eligible for EBRD investment, the bank

could consider financing in the future.
The closer the project comes to completion, however, the less value EBRD
financing could add.”
Gazprom paid $7.45 billion for a
50% stake plus one share in SEIC last
December from the partners Royal
Dutch Shell PLC, Mitsui, and Mitsubishi, changing the ownership structure
in SEIC to Shell holding 27.5%, Mitsui
12.5%, and Mitsubishi 10%.
A Shell spokesman said, “EBRD’s
decision is no great surprise, since it
reflects the fact that the approach to financing of the project has yet to be decided by the new shareholders, so that
EBRD does not see the current financing
package as feasible to pursue.”
Environmentalists welcomed the an-

nouncement, having lobbied the EBRD
for the past 5 years to ditch financial
support claiming that the project has
breached environmental standards.
Dimitry Lisitysn, head of Sakhalin
Environment Watch, said, “Environmental groups agree with EBRD that
its value added was decreasing as the
project comes closer to completion.
We witnessed EBRD’s environmental
leverage diminishing last year when
the project’s negative impacts on the
ground overtook Sakhalin Energy’s
rhetoric to the contrary.”
Nevertheless, a number of other
lenders—export credit agencies from
Japan, the UK, and US, and ABN
Amro, Royal Bank of Scotland, and
Mizuhoare—are yet to decide on

whether they will invest in Sakhalin-2
or not. Environmentalists have urged
them to follow EBRD’s lead and abandon the project.
Chris Weafer, chief strategist at
Russia’s Alfa-Bank, told OGJ that EBRD’s
pullout would not have any major effect on Sakhalin-2’s future. The project
was no longer within the EBRD’s remit
because Gazprom’s majority control
meant that its status had changed from
development to one of state-control, he
added. “Gazprom’s role will accelerate
the process of Sakhalin, and the partners
can earn money quickly from the oil
and gas. They can go out and borrow
money from other banks on terms as
good as EBRD’s and at very favorable
rates.” ✦

yanmar has recently been hitting the news, both for its oil
and natural gas as well as for alleged
human rights abuses. The two sides
of the news meet, of course, since
the abuses often involve forced labor
or abuse of minorities at oil and gas
developments.
Last November, some of these issues came to the fore when the International Labor Organization signaled
its intention to take the issue of forced
labor in Myanmar to the International
Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court, as well as to the
United Nations Security Council.
Back then, too, Myanmar had a
visit from UN Undersecretary Ibrahim Gambari, who said the country’s
generals must take clear steps to demonstrate their interest in cooperating
with the international community.
Gambari was granted a meeting
with Aung San Suu Kyi, the detained
Nobel Prize-winning democracy
advocate. She expressed support for
deeper UN engagement in Burma,
he said, if it could deliver results.
He also held what were described
as “frank and extensive” talks with
Senior General Than Shwe, the
country’s ruler.
Gambari gave a mixed review, saying “The outcome of my visit—and
the concrete results—are still being
awaited” and, “The ball is back in the
court of the authorities.”

is not an issue.
Last week, the issues discussed
by Gambari came to a vote in the
UN, and the vote did not go the way
he wanted. In fact, China vetoed a
US-drafted UN resolution calling
on Burma to free political prisoners,
move towards democracy, and end
attacks against ethnic minorities.
Wang Guangya, the Chinese ambassador, said, “The Myanmar issue is
mainly the internal affair of a sovereign state.” He saw “no need for the
Security Council to get involved.”
Before casting what was only
Beijing’s fifth veto in UN history, he
decried the “arbitrary” highlighting
of one country, as “similar problems
exist in many other countries as
well.”

New contracts

Doubtlessly they do. But it is also
noteworthy that just a few days after
casting that vote, China was a clear
beneficiary as Myanmar signed production-sharing contracts with China

order to meet core demand, including
growing electricity generation needs,
they said.
But the biggest change in Atlantic Basin LNG imports during 2006
came in the UK, where the Isle of
Grain terminal, in its first full year of
operations since reopening, received
volumes of more than 115 bcf, Gaul
and Platt said.
US capacity utilizations also were
lower than expected in 2006 as supply
problems in Nigeria and in Trinidad and
Tobago affected liquefaction operations,
the analysts said. US imports also felt
the impact of fewer long-term supply
contracts relative to other consuming
countries, they pointed out.
“For the most part, the current LNG
market functions through long-term
contractual agreements for delivery of
cargoes from producer nations to Western Europe and Asia. With the exception
of deliveries from Nigeria and [from]
Trinidad and Tobago, US importers have
not yet begun to bring the large volumes of LNG under similar long-term
agreements,” they explained.

Long-term prospects
In the reference case for its 2007
Annual Energy Outlook (AEO2007),
EIA said it expects LNG imports to
meet much of the increased US gas demand through 2030. In the AEO2007
reference case, which was released on
Dec. 5, EIA expects US LNG imports to
rise to 4.5 tcf in 2030 from 600 bcf in
2005, 200 bcf more than in its 2006
reference case.
“In addition to new terminals,
including four that are currently under
construction, expansions of three of
the four existing onshore US LNG
terminals (Cove Point; Elba Island, Ga.,
and Lake Charles, La.) are included in
the AEO2007 reference case. Because
of liquefaction project delays, supply
constraints at a number of liquefaction
facilities, and rapid growth in global
LNG demand, the US LNG market is
expected to be tight until 2012,” it
said. ✦

Data from comparable offset wells in Gaines County, Texas

LiteProp™ ultra-lightweight
proppants provide greater
ROI on your frac investment.

When BJ Services introduced LitePropTM ultra-lightweight proppants
(ULWPs) in 2003, we saw tremendous potential to optimize
hydraulic fracture stimulations. We claimed the near-neutral buoyancy of LiteProp ULWPs in low-polymer or slickwater fluid systems
promised greater access to targeted reserves.

Field results are substantiating our claims. BJ Services now has pumped roughly 20 million pounds
of LiteProp ULWPs into more than 1,300 wells worldwide. (Remember – our lightest ULWP is less than
half as dense as sand.) More than 40 percent of these are Permian Basin wells – and many were not
economic candidates for fracturing with conventional fluids and proppants.
Lower density and slower settling rates of ULWPs provide greater effective zonal coverage. Based
on a successful 2004-05 campaign in which LiteProp fracture treatments helped increase its total
production by roughly 300%, a single West Texas operator plans 75 LiteProp frac jobs in 2006 – and
35 will be recompletions.
See for yourself. Read our numerous SPE papers detailing the progress of LiteProp ULWP
technology – or simply contact your BJ Services representative. Explore how much more coverage
a LiteProp frac job can provide in the formations you face.

Rig contracts
Drilling contractors are attracted by
both high day rates and long contract
duration. The worldwide increase in day
rates for most drilling units is reported
regularly in the media. But a study by
Rigzone noted the increasing length of
contract periods for different rig types,
across 13 different regions.1 The study
is based on worldwide count of 598
offshore rigs.
From May 2005 to November 2006,
the average length of offshore drilling
rig contracts increased 6% worldwide,
to 679 days from 639 days. The top six
regions posting double-digit increases
(from 71% to 11%) include the US
Gulf of Mexico, Australia, Caspian Sea,
Brazil, Mediterranean, and Southeast
Asia (Table 1). These six regions account for 265 rigs, representing 44% of
the worldwide offshore fleet.
Three regions registered decreasing
contract lengths:
• Far East, down 34% to 272 days
from 410.
• Mexico, down 23% to 888 days
from 1,150.
• South Asia, down 8% to 1,716
days from 1,870.
As of last November, the longest duration contracts (average more than 2.5
years) were being written in South Asia
(1,716 days), Brazil (1,066 days), the
Persian Gulf (1,049 days), and the Red
Sea (988 days).

higher rates, are an incentive to move

ing written in the US Gulf of Mexico
(245 days), the Far East (272 days),
and Australia (317 days). Rig rates are
particularly low in the gulf, compared
with worldwide pricing, and in combination with short contracts have led to a
continuing exodus of rigs.
The length of drilling contracts is
dictated by rig type. Rigzone’s data indicated that drillships (38 in the world
fleet, + 12 under construction) have the
longest contracts, averaging 910 days.
Surprisingly, contracts for jack ups (400
in world fleet, + 62 under construction) are the next longest, at 713 days,
followed by semisubs (167 in world
fleet, + 34 under construction) at 561
days. Jack up contracts are now 27%
longer than semisub contracts, on average. The gap is slipping, however: 18
months earlier, jack up contracts were
35% longer than semisub contracts.

On Dec. 12, Husky Energy Inc. announced it would spend $3.18 billion
in 2007.
John C.S. Lau, president and chief
executive ofﬁcer of Husky, said the
“2007 capital expenditure program
will focus on Husky’s growth in the oil
sands and further exploration and development in the offshore East Coast of
Canada, offshore China and Indonesia.”
About 82% ($2.62 billion of the $3.18

billion) will be spent on upstream, including $1.63 billion in western Canada,
$210 million on western Canadian
exploration, $330 million on oil sands,
and $290 million in eastern Canada.
Drilling in western Canada will focus
on natural gas in the deep basin and
foothills of Alberta and British Columbia.
Oil sands drilling includes $31 million at Caribou Lake for delineation
wells and advance engineering and $31
million for resource evaluation wells
to further assess the Saleski oil sands

E&P spending
Lehman Bros.’ Original E&P Spending Survey shows that the 299 operators surveyed plan to increase upstream
spending by 9% in 2007, to $292 billion from $268 billion in 2006.
Larger increases are expected outside
North America (13%), led by NOCs.
Upstream capital expenditures in the
US will grow only 5.1%, to $73 billion
in 2007 from $69 billion in 2006.
Exploration and production spending will decrease 7% in Canada, to $22
billion in 2007 from $24 billion in
2006.
Companies are basing forecasts on
an average price of $42.40/bbl oil and
$4.80/Mcf natural gas.

International spending
In mid-December, Pemex’s exploration and production unit, Pemex Exploracion y Produccion, awarded $412
million in drilling contracts to three
companies: Swecomex, Servicios Integrales GSM, and BJ Services. The joint
drilling contract is in two parts ($132
million and $280 million) for southern
region fields.
Hess Corp. plans to spend $550
million on drilling in 2007. The overall
2007 capital expenditure plans, announced on Dec. 19, 2006, include
$3.5 billion for exploration and production; $1.4 billion for field development, $1.2 billion for production, and
$0.9 billion for exploration.
Drilling plans include:
• 10-12 wells and construct onshore
and offshore facilities at Ujung Pangkah, East Java.
• 18 development wells and completion of offshore production facilities at
Okume, Equatorial Guinea.

• Development drilling and facilities

Canada’s Husky Energy Inc. will
spend about $160 million internationally in 2007, including $100 million
in China and $60 million in Indonesia.
The company will drill an exploration
well in Block 04/35 in the East China

According to a report from Britain’s
Hannon Westwood, as many as 50 of
107 wells scheduled to be drilled on
the UK continental shelf in the next 2
years will require farm-in funding.3 The
report details 23 farm-in opportunities in the Central North Sea, 14 in the
Southern Gas basin, 2 West of Britain,
and 9 targeting heavy oil or HPHT
plays.
A founding partner of Hannon Westwood, Charles Westwood, said “Since
the late 1990s, the number of acreage
holders in the North Sea has doubled,
changing the dynamics of the North
Sea. There are now 143 companies
holding North Sea assets, offering an
abundance of investment opportunities
as well as intense competition for rig
slots.” ✦

delivery during the next 2 years. This
is much higher than the backlog at the
same time in previous years (Fig. 2).
The current backlog consists of 47
FPSOs, 9 production semis, 2 TLPs, and
4 spars.
According to Jim McCaul, head of
IMA, “this is by far the highest order

O D U C T I O N

backlog of floaters in the 30-year history of floating production systems.” He
added that “the number of floaters now
on order is about the same as the total
number in operation 10 years ago.”
McCaul sees the market for floating production units in the foreseeable
future to continue to be strong. He has

identified 108 projects currently in the
bidding, design, or planning stage that
potentially require floating production
or storage systems.
McCaul said, “if all these projects
materialized, they would generate a
requirement for 88 production floaters,
15 floating storage units, and 7 floating
regasification facilities.”
In terms of water depth, 25 of the
108 projects in the planning pipeline
are in ultradeep water, deeper than
1,500 m. Another 28 are in water depth
of 1,000-1,500 m, while the remaining
projects are in water less than 1,000 m
deep.
The report says seven operators account for 56 of the 108 projects in the
planning pipeline. Petroleo Brasileiro
SA (Petrobras) has the most with 16
projects, followed by Chevron Corp.
with 11, Total SA and Royal Dutch
Shell PLC with 7 each, BP PLC with 6,
ConocoPhillips with 5, and BHP Billiton Ltd. and Eni SPA with 4 each.

Fabrication facilities

___________________

44

The IMA report says that the number
of facilities for fabricating or converting floating production and storage
systems also has increased. Currently 34
facilities worldwide, up from 31 in July
and 20 from 2 years ago, fabricate or
convert floaters.
These facilities do work covered by
major fabrication or integration contracts but not work done by subsuppliers and engineering, which is done at
many other locations.
The report says Asia continues to
have the most construction activity for
production and storage floaters, with 16
units currently being built.
FPSO construction is strong in China,
with a focus on midsize production
units, both ship-shape and cylindrical.
Korea continues to fabricate mostly top
end, purpose-built production units.
Singapore remains the major center for
conversion of tankers to FPSOs, according to the report. ✦

A study conducted on
the Canadian refining
industry for 1993-2003
showed a positive correlation between environmental performance
Refining
and profitability. For
every 1 tonne decrease
in emissions, the income from refinery
operations increased by about $2,000
(Can.).
Public concern for
the environment has
triggered new regulations and increased
stakeholder expectations. Both have triggered costs that profoundly affect the petroleum-refining
sector.
There are two competing views on
the overall impact of environmental
spending on profitability. One says
that pollution-abatement efforts divert
resources from the production of marketable output and lead to a decline in
profits. The other says that environmentalism has led to modernization of operations and better management, which
together result in higher profits.
This article examines the correlation
of Canadian petroleum refinery profits
with the volume of reported pollutant
emissions. These emissions are reported
to the Canadian government and are
available to the public in Environment
Canada’s “National Pollutant Release
Inventory,” (NPRI).
We examined the correlation of
emissions with profit for a 10-year
period beginning in 1993.
Petroleum refineries play a significant role in the Canadian economy.
They have a high public profile among
environmental groups and are frequently targeted for regulation. The costs
that result from these regulations can
be difficult to assess. They are known,
however, to be substantial.
In 1993, for example, the National
Petroleum Council estimated the cost
for refineries to satisfy environmental
regulations in the US were $152 billion.1 Purvin & Gertz estimated the cost

of Canadian sulfur-reduction regulations for gasoline and diesel products
alone to be $5.3 billion (Can.).2

Previous studies
Other studies have examined the
environmental vs. financial performance
question in a variety of industries, with
mixed results.
For example, pollution abatement

reduced productivity in both the brewing industry and the electrical utilities

Freedman and Jaggi found no
evidence to support claims that it hurt
profitability in the pulp and paper
industry.5 On the other hand, Spicer
found that better pollution control was
associated with higher profitability for
pulp and paper companies.6 Russo and
Fouts argued that some of these earlier
studies can be challenged on methodological grounds because they failed
to control for factors that contribute to
profitability.7
Some have argued that cross-sectional studies such as these are rooted in
time and are therefore unable to capture
the effects of technological advances.
Our study, funded by Ryerson University, Toronto, is designed to address
both concerns by exploring the longterm relationship of profit and environ-

Although there are many factors that
affect the profitability of refineries, and
many studies about them, much of the

Using data from these 15 refineries,
our study estimated the long-term correlation between profit and pollution
based on data representing over 60% of
total refinery capacity in Canada.
All of the data used in this study
came from publicly available documents. Emissions volumes came from
the Environment Canada NPRI database.
Financial data and feedstock volume
data came from the companies’ annual
reports.
There were limitations in the data
available from some of the companies,
and some of the data required estimation. Husky, for example, did not become a publicly traded company until
2000. Husky’s annual reports contained
sufficient historic information to provide data for 2000-02 only.
Parkland Industries, the smallest company in the sample, required
special treatment. Because Parkland
sold its refinery in 2000, only 8 years
of data were available for this company.
Furthermore, Parkland’s main business
was marketing gasoline, which distinguished it from the larger, integrated
oil companies. Parkland did not disclose
petroleum refinery operations as a separate segment. An estimate of NetInci,t for
Parkland Industries was based on the
proportion of sales volume for which
cost of sales was produced internally.
The other control variable was
CapEmpi,t. This was measured as the
cost of refinery assets less accumulated
amortization. Integrated companies
provided this information in their
segmented disclosures. For Parkland,
the information came directly from the
balance sheet.
The time factor Yrt is included in this
study as a trend variable, serving to capture the effect on NetInci,t of factors that
may correlate with downstream profit
yet remain unidentified, or for which
the information is unavailable.
Energy efficiency, for example, is
a key factor in determining refinery
profitability. The energy efficiency of
each refinery is assessed with Solomon’s
Energy Intensity Index. These numbers,
however, are considered confidential

highly correlated with Yrt, we decided
simply to use the latter as a sort of
“catch all” trend variable.
The final data set included 51 company-years. A statistically significant
and negative emissions factor would
support King and Lenox’s evidence of

and environmental performance. On the
other hand, a significant and positive
coefficient would support the “dead

Our dependence on certain industries, which distinguishes those that are
growing from those that are mature, or
dying, depends itself upon time. Despite
the maturity of this sector, refineries
have a long history of continued technological innovation in both core refining processes and products. This trend
is evident in increases in annual capital
investments by existing refineries over
the long term (25+ years) to ensure
these plants remain economically viable
in a very competitive sector.

remain unanswered. We did not try,

Florida continental shelf since 1844.
The microalgal cells produce a toxin
that kills fish, mobile invertebrates, and
sessile epifauna. Red tide also depletes
dissolved oxygen (DO) levels, creating
hypoxic conditions (DO <2-3 mg/l.)
in the water column.
The summer 2005 red tide affected
Tampa Bay and the northeast-central
Gulf of Mexico. Collection of summer
fish census and photostation information happened before the red tide while
the winter fish census and transect
information was collected after the red
tide and during the initial recovery
phases.
The red tide radically changed the
benthic community structure. The
toxins and hypoxia it created resulted in
mass mortalities to virtually all benthic
invertebrates: anemones, zooanthids,
octocorals, firecorals, stony corals,
polychaetes, mollusks, crustaceans, and
echinoderms. All hard bottom areas,
including the habitat replacement sites,
became barren.
The ability of fish to temporarily
move into deeper water and recolonize
shallower depths when favorable conditions return limited the red tides’ damage to them relative to the invertebrate
population.
The timing of the red tide provides
an opportunity to compare recovery of
the benthic and fish communities, in
terms of both recovery rate and species
composition, in the mitigation areas as
compared to natural hard-live bottom.
Gulfstream expects that the mitigation
areas may recover more quickly, their
greater surface complexity and vertical
relief possibly improving recruitment
rates. ✦

New weld alignment clamp

Marine magnetometer for survey uses

Here’s a new compact, high-strength
weld alignment clamp that is easy to use
for rigidly holding in place two sections of
tube, pipe, flanges, or plate.
The HOG-TIE weld alignment clamp
delivers up to 15,000 lb of force for rapidly positioning two pipes, boiler tubes,
flanges, or plates. Fast and easy to use, it
consists of two clamping jaws and a steel
strap that inserts between the two sections
being aligned, engages the two clamping

The G-882, an ultrasensitive-high
sample rate marine magnetometer, is
designed for shallow and deep oil and gas
survey operations.
It features ultrahigh sensitivity, low
noise, and a high sample rate for detecting
small objects, a compact and stable design
that allows deployment and operation
by one person, automatic hemisphere
switching, worldwide operation, and it
comes with processing software providing

data profiling or contouring for in-field
or laboratory analysis. Its cesium sensor
is designed for reliability and ruggedness
and never needs recalibration or factory realignment. The G-882 comes with a 2 year
parts and labor warranty and unlimited
technical support.
The tool is designed to operate anywhere in the world, in any direction from

small ships in shallow or deep water and
weighs only 50 lb with its 200 ft cable and
sensor. Lead weights can easily be added
for deep tow applications.

From the Subscribers Only area of

Europe pressing
failed approach
to global warming
In the battle over what to do about
global warming, alarmists are trouncing
deniers.
Those unﬂattering labels emerged in
the uncivil controversy that has raged over
how humanity should respond to observed
warming.
One side accuses the other of fomenting undue alarm. The other side responds
by diagnosing the opposition as smitten by

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

denial.
Right or wrong, the alarmists have
prevailed. The Kyoto Treaty has entered into
force. And Democrats promise to make
something like Kyoto part of their energy
initiatives in the US Congress.
It does no good to ask whether humans
can meaningfully inﬂuence global average
temperature. The effort will be made, very
likely with the hitherto reluctant US participating in some fashion.
It might as well be done properly, then.
It won’t be if governments address climate
phenomena by manipulating markets and
dictating behavior.
Europe continues along that discredited
course. The European Commission on Jan.
10 proposed that European Union members
cut emissions of greenhouse gases by 20%
from 1990 levels by 2020 and by 30% if
an international agreement takes effect to
pursue the more aggressive target.
As part of the European effort, the EC
wants to improve energy efﬁciency by 20%
and raise the market share of renewable
energy sources to 20% by 2020.
It won’t work. Fuel use mandates by
governments never do. They raise costs,
distort markets, and breed unintended
consequences.
For that matter, ofﬁcial targets for
greenhouse-gas emission cuts have been
no twinkling triumph. Kyoto followed that
approach, calling for comparatively modest
8-10% emissions cuts from 1990 levels by
2012. Emissions from Kyoto signatories are
now slightly below the target only because
of plunges in the 1990s from so-called
economies in transition—formerly Soviet
countries whose economies collapsed and
are now modernizing. Emissions are rising
for the other group of Kyoto participants.
If 8-10% cuts by 2012 look unachievable,
why stretch the target? If emissions mandates are failing, why press the approach?
European leaders say they want to lead
the world on this issue. Costly government
intrusions, destined to fail, are no way to
go about it.

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

NYMEX crude breaks $55/bbl price support
The February contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes broke through
former market support at $55/bbl to close at $54.02/bbl, down $1.62 for the day,
after trading at $53.44-55.81/bbl Jan. 10 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It fell
further, closing at $51.88, Jan. 11.
The next key support level for the February crude contract was $50/bbl, “which in
the current volatility can be reached in 2 days,” said Olivier Jakob, managing director
of Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland. That price, however, “has now become the
consensus and should be a strong support,” he said.
Meanwhile, Jakob noted “some supportive ﬂags that will need watching,” including “for the ﬁrst time this year” a reduction of all crude open interest for both North
Sea Brent and benchmark US crudes in both the New York and London markets.
“This would suggest that some liquidation has started, and, while it can bring some
further violent correction, a further conﬁrmation of falling open interest would point
to the start of an exhaustion move,” said Jakob. In addition, he said, “The rest of the
commodity complex has found a ﬂoor for now. The oil correction is now purely an
oil affair rather than a general commodity sell-off.”
The Energy Information Administration report on US inventories of crude and
reﬁned products showed demand was dropping as mild winter weather continued.
Commercial inventories of benchmark US crudes fell by 5 million bbl to 314.7 million
bbl in the week ended Jan. 5. Gasoline stocks rose by 3.8 million bbl to 213.3 million
bbl in that period, while distillate fuel inventories jumped by 5.4 million bbl to 141
million bbl, with gains in both heating oil and diesel (OGJ Online, Jan. 10, 2007). It
marked the fourth consecutive week that distillate and gasoline supplies increased,
but crude inventories have fallen for 7 weeks.
“The tumbling crude oil price has had its effect on the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, with its spokesman urging its members to ‘comply with the
agreed cuts,’” said analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates
Inc. “OPEC had announced a cut of 1.2 million b/d in October, and another 500,000
b/d production cut is scheduled to take place in February. Our analysis suggests that
only about 65% of the agreed October cuts have been implemented. The latest slide
may just tip the scales in favor of better compliance with the next agreed production
cut.”
Jakob said, “Despite its claims otherwise, it is evident that OPEC is trying to
defend a price rather than a supply and demand picture. It starts to talk about cuts
as soon as the price approaches $55/bbl but fails to act as soon as it approaches
$60/bbl.”
Natural gas
While crude prices slipped lower that week, natural gas broke its 5-week downward spiral in the New York market Jan. 8, both because of weather outlooks. The
February natural gas contract escalated by 12.4¢ to $6.76/MMbtu Jan. 10 on NYMEX.
On the US spot market, gas at Henry Hub, La., jumped by 36¢ to $6.42/MMbtu.
“Short-term weather forecasts from the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (both 6-10 day and 8-14 day) continue to show that colder weather is likely in
the latter part of January. This may provide some support to natural gas prices,” said
Raymond James analysts.
The February gas contract fell back to $6.29/MMbtu Jan. 11 when EIA reported
withdrawal of 49 bcf of natural gas from US underground storage in the week ended
Jan. 5. That was above the consensus of Wall Street analysts and compared with
withdrawals of 47 bcf the previous week and 20 bcf a year ago. US storage was then
slightly above 3 tcf of gas, up by 401 bcf from year-ago levels and 461 bcf above the
5-year average.
“We believe that many E&P companies are prepared to face natural gas price
volatility this year, as the average company has hedged approximately one third
of its gas at $7-8/Mcf, with room for upside should the energy markets improve
throughout the year,” said Raymond James analysts. “Short-term, energy investors
could take a more conservative stance by looking at well-hedged producers, which
will provide the most insulation from price volatility.”
Hedging by producers “will help generate ample cash ﬂow to fund bullish capital
spending programs and even free cash ﬂow (which could be used for share repurchases or dividends, for instance),” the analysts said. “While acknowledging the
possibility of further price ﬂuctuations and milder weather throughout this winter,
we feel that E&P stocks should still fare well in 2007.”

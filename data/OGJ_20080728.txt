SABIC Europe BV’s 1.275-million tonne/year (tpy) ethylene
production plant, Geleen,The Netherlands, was one of the plants to
show a capacity increase during 2007.The OGJ ethylene survey
as of Jan. 1 showed a 2 million tpy increase in ethylene capacity
worldwide compared with last year’s survey. The global rise in capacity, which occurred mainly in Asia-Pacific and Western Europe,
was a significant increase compared with the 2006 survey. An
unprecedented amount of capacity is scheduled to come on stream
in 2008, according to this week’s special report, which starts on p.
46.The ethylene survey begins on p. 53. Photo from SABIC.

CGES: World needs more OPEC crude
The world needs more crude oil priced at a level that makes it
economic to refine, said analysts at the Centre for Global Energy
Studies (CGES), London.
CGES squarely places the blame for today’s tight oil market on
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The organization continues to assert that the world is well supplied with crude
and refuses to accept that production needs to rise, CGES said in its
latest Monthly Oil Report.
The report refutes the assertion that the market has enough
oil, pointing out that global oil inventories fell for six consecutive
quarters between the fourth quarter of 2006 and the first quarter
of this year.
OPEC shows no signs of being willing to increase its own production, as it continues to blame high oil prices on factors other
than its own production policy, including the weak US dollar, geopolitics, and market speculators, CGES said.
While OPEC forecasts 2008 production growth outside the
organization at 560,000 b/d, first-half production was down
330,000 b/d. This implies a surge in non-OPEC output of 1.45
million b/d in the second half.
CGES also said refinery runs will rise only if it becomes profitable to process the marginal barrel of supply without cracking it,
since margins on straight-run processing are poor due to weak
gasoline and fuel oil markets. Currently refineries are running at
capacity of their upgrading units but not to capacity of their distillation units, according to the report.
“In the absence of additional supply, only a global recession,
destroying enough demand to reduce the need for OPEC oil, can
set prices on a downward path. It is a bleak picture and one that has
OPEC’s production policy among its key features,” CGES said.

USGS: Arctic holds 90 billion bbl of undiscovered oil
The area north of the Arctic Circle contains an estimated 90 billion bbl of undiscovered, technically recoverable crude oil, reported the US Geological Survey July 23 as it released its first petroleum
resource estimate of the region.
The Arctic, especially offshore, is essentially unexplored with
respect to petroleum, it noted.
The region also contains an estimated 1,670 tcf of technically
recoverable gas and 44 million bbl of technically recoverable natural gas liquids in 25 geologically defined areas thought to have petroleum potential, the US Department of the Interior agency said.
It said the resources represent about 22% of the world’s undiscovered, technically recoverable petroleum resources (about 13%
of the oil, 30% of the gas, and 20% of the gas liquids). About 84%
of the estimated resources are offshore, USGS said.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

USGS said the appraisal was part of a project to assess global
petroleum basins using standardized and consistent methods and
controls. USGS said it worked with a number of international agencies to geologically analyze the Arctic provinces.
“Before we can make decisions about our future use of oil and
gas and related decisions about protecting endangered species, native communities, and the health of our planet, we need to know
what’s out there. With this assessment, we’re providing the same
information to everyone in the world so that the global community can make these difficult decisions,” USGS Director Mark Myers
said.
The assessment said more than half of the undiscovered oil
resources are believed to be in just three provinces: Arctic Alaska,
the Amerasia basin, and the East Greenland Rift basins. Gas is estimated to be three times more abundant than oil in the Arctic on
an equivalency basis, with more than 70% of it occurring in the
West Siberian basin, the East Barents basins, and Arctic Alaska, it
indicated.

Brazil to update oil law in wake of discoveries
Brazil’s ministry of mines and energy has created a new working group that will aim to update the country’s existing oil law,
according to a senior government official.
“This group is studying the legislation of several countries, especially those which have a monopoly, and we are going to make
a proposal to change the current law,” said Mines and Energy Minister Edison Lobao.
The minister said every country changes the rules whenever
new discoveries are made and that “Brazil can’t be different.” However, he acknowledged that there are interests intent on maintaining “the status quo.”
Lobao, who said the changes are in the interests of the Brazilian people, was apparently referring to criticism of the proposed
changes voiced by Petroleo Brasileiro Chief Executive Jose Sergio
Gabrielli.
Noting that 60% of Petrobras’s capital is private, while only 40%
is held by the government, Lobao said Gabrielli represents a private
company and, as such, is fighting for Petrobras’s interests.
Lobao also gave assurances that the recently proposed creation
of a new company to manage subsalt oil reserves will not result in
a breach of existing contracts.
“This is an initial idea but, in my view, all contracts will have to
be maintained,” he said. “What we seek is a new formula.”
Earlier this week, it was reported that Lobao plans to propose to
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva the creation of a new state-run
firm that would manage oil discoveries made in recent months
in the subsalt layer of the Santos basin (OGJ Online, June 30,
2008). ✦

China to Exxon: pull out of Vietnam exploration deal

Rift makes gas ﬁnd in Papua New Guinea

The Chinese government has warned ExxonMobil Corp. to
pull out of an exploration deal off Vietnam, describing the project as a breach of Chinese security, according to a Hong Kong
newspaper.
The Sunday Morning Post, citing sources close to the firm,
said Chinese diplomats in Washington, DC, have made repeated verbal protests to ExxonMobil executives in recent months,
warning them that its future business interests on the mainland
could be at risk.
The protests are said to involve a preliminary cooperation
agreement between state oil firm Petrovietnam and ExxonMobil
covering exploration in the South China Sea off Vietnam’s south
and central coasts.
ExxonMobil is confident of Vietnam’s sovereign rights to the
blocks it would be exploring, the paper’s sources said—those off
central Vietnam start at the coastline—but it could not dismiss China’s warnings out of hand.
“If it was simply a legal question it would be easy,” one of the
sources said. “Vietnam would probably prevail in international mediation. But it’s political, too. China’s concerns make the situation
much more complicated for a company like Exxon.... China is a
very important player in the international oil industry.”
The Chinese envoys based their protests on Beijing’s historical
claim to virtually all of the South China Sea, the source said. Both
countries claim the entire Paracels and Spratlys archipelagos and
much of the surrounding waters.
Vietnam bases its claims on its extensive continental shelf and
the exclusive economic zone. This allows it to stake out according
to the United Nations’ International Law of the Sea. China’s claim
is legally vaguer, independent academics say.
An ExxonMobil spokesman refused to discuss any approaches
from China, saying only that the firm is evaluating a “business opportunity, and sovereignty is a matter only governments can address.”
Carl Thayer, a Vietnam-watcher at the Strategic and Defense
Studies Centre of Australian National University, said Vietnam’s sovereignty was “under threat” and that Hanoi was struggling to deal
with the situation.
“Chinese hard power is once again part of the equation, as far as
Vietnam is concerned,” he said, adding that China may be trying to
push Vietnam towards a joint exploitation deal like the one struck
with Japan in the East China Sea.

Rift Oil PLC has discovered 48.5 m of net natural gas pay in its
Puk Puk-1 wildcat in the forelands onshore Papua New Guinea.
The company reports that this result is 50% more than predicted and twice the thickness of the interval found in the Douglas-I
wildcat drilled last year in the same permit, PPL235.
Puk Puk-1 was targeting an estimated predrill recoverable reserve of 226 bcf of gas.
The gas was found in the Toro, Upper Hedinia, and Lower Hedinia sands. Downhole sampling also recovered significant condensate, raising the possibility of an oil reservoir at depth in this structure, or at least potentially to be found in surrounding features.
Rift now plans to remap the Puk Puk structure and flow-test
the well.
If the test is successful, the new find bodes well for the company’s two gas development options for this area. Rift has signed
an agreement with Flex LNG to use a floating LNG facility in the
Papuan Gulf as one alternative.
It also has signed a nonbinding memorandum of intent with Alcan Australia to potentially supply Alcan’s alumina plant at Gove in
the Northern Territory of Australia with 40 bcf/year of gas for 20
years.

Drilling

&

Key Petroleum Ltd.’s Kiliwani North-1 natural gas discovery in
Tanzania has been declared a commercial development option.
Flow testing of the well confirms the earlier announcement of
a flow of 40 MMcfd.
Perth-based Key adds that there was zero drawdown of bottom
hole pressure during the test. This and other pressure data plus
laboratory analysis satisfied Key that the well and the field are commercially viable.
The company has a 20% interest in the find.
Key says that the Nyuni block that surrounds the discovery has
substantial upside potential including a number of untested leads
and prospects in the vicinity.
The potential encompasses prospects in the range of up to 500
bcf of gas in place. Total undiscovered gas in the block could be
more than 2 tcf.
Development plans for Kiliwani North-1 include construction
of a pipeline to connect with the neighbouring Songo Songo gas
field processing plant.
Key added that seismic and drilling data are still needed to assess
further global growth prospects in the region. ✦

Taiwan to invest in Canadian oil sands
Taiwan’s state-owned CPC Corp. on July 17 signed a memorandum of understanding with Canadian-based Indian Oilsands Corp.,
paving the way for a possible partnership on oil sands development
in Alberta. CPC Vice-Pres. Arthur Kung and Indian Oilsands representative Ken Thomas signed the MOU in Taipei.

gram. Company officials say the project is part of an effort to diversify energy sources and stabilize domestic energy supplies in face
of the continued rise in global oil prices.
Formosa Petrochemical Corp., a member of the Formosa Plastics Group, also is studying a plan to tap Canada’s oil sands and
intends to send an inspection delegation to Alberta.

Pemex production rises after pipelines repaired
State-owned Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) said it increased production by 41,000 b/d in June to 2.84 million, a slight improvement over May but still below the company’s target of 2.9 million
b/d for 2008.
Pemex said the improvements came after it repaired an offshore
pipeline in the Southeast marine region. The repairs enabled an
11.5% increase in June to 535,937 b/d.
Still, June production remains 11.5% lower than the same period a year ago, when Mexico produced 3.21 million b/d.
Earlier this week, Pemex said its average daily oil production
in the first 6 months of 2008 fell 9.7% from the year-ago period,
producing an average of 2.86 million b/d of crude oil in the first
half of this year.
Pemex said output at Cantarell, its largest source of crude oil,
was 1.15 million b/d, a decline of some 457,000 b/d from the
same period in 2007. In June, it said, Cantarell production fell by
25,849 b/d to 1.05 million b/d.
Apart from the decline at Cantarell, Pemex production also has
been hurt by the need to shut in wells that have started to produce
large amounts of water. The company is said to be struggling to
establish water separation facilities to enable continued production
at such wells.
While crude production remains below target, natural gas output in the first half of the year rose 13.3% to 6.723 bcfd. Gas
production also rose to a record 7.02 bcfd in June, up from 6.85
billion in May and 6.19 billion in June 2007.
Pemex said it is producing more gas at Cantarell, where gas is
moving into wells that formerly produced oil. Gas output at Cantarell rose 4.9% in June to 1.67 bcf.

Karachaganak oil now subject to export tax
Kazakhstan, apparently reversing an earlier ruling, has announced that the consortium developing Karachaganak gas field
must pay a new oil export duty.
“Karachaganak has become a payer of the export duty,” said
Deputy Finance Minister Daulet Yergozhin, referring to the consortium comprised of Eni SPA 32.5%, BG 32.5%, Chevron Corp. 20%,
and Lukoil 15%.
Yergoshin also said the finance ministry soon plans to expand
the list of 38 eligible companies announced in May when the government established the export duty.

Processing
PetroVietnam lets Nghi Son reﬁnery design contract
State-owned PetroVietnam has awarded Foster Wheeler a contract to design the 200,000 b/d Nghi Son refinery and petrochemical project, effective July 18.
Under the contract, Foster Wheeler will finish the designing in
16 months from the day the contract came into force. Scheduled
for completion in 2013, the refinery is expected to meet 60% of
Vietnam’s domestic demand for gasoline and other products.
The Nghi Son project will import oil from Kuwait to produce
high-quality products.

The export tax, introduced on May 18, comes to $109.91/
tonne of crude oil or $27.43/tonne for those who pay royalties for
exported oil and gas condensate. The customs duty for heavy distillates, coke, and bitumen exports is $82.20/tonne.
At the time, the BG-Eni consortium and the Chevron-led Tengizchevroil joint venture both were excluded from the list due to
their long-term contracts with the government under which they
were considered exempt from any additional taxes.
The Karachaganak consortium’s operations are regulated by a
production-sharing agreement signed in 1997 by the Kazakh government and the group. The consortium has the right to continue
operating the fields until 2038.
However, at the end of May, Kazakh Finance Minister Bolat
Zhamishev said that all subsurface resource producers might have
to pay the crude export duty.
The consortium faced threats of closure when the Kazakh customs control department in Atyrau would not sign off on an oil export declaration for June. It said the ministry of energy and mineral
resources had not provided notification of whether the consortium
had to pay the export duty.
One official had said at the time that if the issue were not resolved, Karachaganak might have to halt exports on the Caspian
Pipeline Consortium (CPC) pipeline.
At that time the consortium faced a choice, he said: either it
paid the duties for June in order to keep exports flowing, or it
defended its position, in which case the CPC pipeline might be
closed to it.

Chevron considers Big Foot development options
Chevron USA Inc. has hired Intec Engineering for a pre-FEED
(front-end engineering and design) study concerning development options for the Big Foot project in the Gulf of Mexico.
Big Foot lies in more than 5,000 ft of water on Walker Ridge
Block 29, 225 miles south of New Orleans and 180 miles offshore
(OGJ, Feb. 11, 2008, Newsletter).
The development study, expected to be completed in the fourth
quarter, will evaluate various types of subsea systems as potential
alternatives.
Intec said a key aspect involves researching subsea boosting options.
Chevron owns 60% working interest in Big Foot. Partners are
StatoilHydro AS 27.5% and Shell Gulf of Mexico Inc. 12.5%. ✦

The award coincided with reports that Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung has asked contractors of the Dung Quat
refinery project in central Quang Ngai province to speed up construction to ensure the planned February 2009 start up.
While visiting the construction site on July 19, Dung reminded
lead contractor Technip and its subcontractors of the coming flood
and storm season and asked them to keep a close eye on the progress of the project.
Meanwhile, Vietnam National Petroleum Corp. (Petrolimex)
has recently received approval from central Khanh Hoa province to

build a $4.5 billion refinery in the region.
According to Petrolimex Chief Executive Vu Ngoc Hai, the plant
will have a capacity to refine 10 million tonnes/year of oil.
Petrolimex has chosen Sinopec as a partner to carry out the
project, and the two sides are said to have discussed setup of a joint
venture as well as stake equity to be owned by each party.
Petrolimex also is working with PB Tankers Ltd. of Singapore
and the Petrolimex Insurance Joint Stock Co. (PIJSC) to build Vietnam’s first bonded warehouse for petroleum.
The depot is an investment of the Van Phong Warehouse Co.
Ltd., a joint venture of Petrolimex, PIJSC, and PB Tankers.
Construction on the facility began in December 2007 in the
Van Phong Economic Zone in Ninh Hoa district of central Khanh
Hoa province.
Nguyen Van Que, director of Van Phong Warehouse, said the
project has two phases, with the first phase costing $100 million
over 18 months.
The depot will be capable of holding 500,000 cu m of petroleum in Phase 1 and a further 500,000 cu m on the completion of
Phase 2. No date has been given for the completion of the second
phase.

Van Que said the depot would be equipped with “the latest
environmentally friendly technology and would be able to handle
150,000-dwt oil tankers.”

PetroRabigh reﬁnery upgrades near completion
Rabigh Refining & Petrochemical (PetroRabigh), a joint venture
of Saudi Aramco and Sumitomo Chemicals, plans to complete the
$10 billion upgrades to its 400,000 b/d refinery and petrochemical complex in Rabigh, Saudi Arabia, in the fourth quarter.
The project will raise output of transportation fuel and make
the refinery the basis of a complex producing 2.4 million tonnes/
year of petrochemical solids and liquids, along with large volumes of gasoline and other products (OGJ, Mar. 13, 2006, Newsletter).
Upgrades to the facility, originally built by the joint venture
partners in 2005, will add a 60,000 b/d gasoline refining unit,
a 200,000 b/d vacuum distillation unit, a 92,000 b/d catalytic
cracking unit, and a 26,000 b/d alkylation unit.
The refinery also will see the addition of an ethane cracker capable of producing 1.25 million tonnes/year of ethylene as well as
a gas processing plant that will produce 900,000 tonnes/year of
propylene. ✦

Alaska Senate to consider natural gas pipeline

Holly, Centurion agree to W. Texas pipeline reversal

The Alaska House of Representatives approved a state license for
TransCanada Corp. to pursue federal certification for a 1,715-mile
natural gas pipeline. The Alaska Senate has yet to consider and vote
on the measure.
The state’s Senate must make its decision before Aug. 2 on Gov.
Sarah Palin’s Alaska Gasline Inducement Act. The AGIA established
state requirements for companies interested in building a pipeline.
If the legislature grants a license to TransCanada, that still does
not guarantee pipeline construction. A license would provide up
to $500 million in state startup money for TransCanada to begin the lengthy, costly process toward federal certification for a
pipeline.
Under AGIA, TransCanada was one of five companies that applied and the only one that satisfied the guidelines, Palin has said
previously. The Alaska House passed HB 3001 with a vote of 23 to
16.
Meanwhile, BP PLC and ConocoPhillips are working on a pipeline proposal called Denali. They announced Apr. 8 plans to build
a 4 bcfd gas pipeline that would extend from the Alaska North
Slope to Canada and potentially on to the US (OGJ, Apr. 14, 2008,
p. 30).
BP and ConocoPhillips called the proposed Alaskan gas line the
“largest private-sector construction project ever built in North
America.” They plan to spend $600 million over the next 36
months on an open season, which is slated to begin before yearend 2010.

Holly Refining & Marketing Co., Dallas, has entered into a definitive agreement to ship crude oil on the Centurion pipeline, operated by a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corp., to supply its
Navajo Refining Co. LP refinery in New Mexico. Centurion has a
16-in. OD and is 375 miles long.
The agreement follows a 30-day open season held by Centurion starting Apr. 14 to determine interest in reversing the pipeline,
which had been running from West Texas to Cushing, Okla. (OGJ
Online, Apr. 25, 2008). The line to be reversed, known as the No.
1 Pipeline, is one of two 16-in. lines Centurion operates between
Slaughter, Tex., and Cushing.
The No. 1 line will now deliver crude from Cushing to
Slaughter, near the Texas-New Mexico border. Holly said it
will build a 70-mile pipeline between Slaughter and Navajo
and is considering both its physical properties and whether
the line will be built by Holly Refining & Marketing or Holly
Energy Partners. Holly has shipping commitments in place on
TransCanada’s Keystone and Enbridge’s Spearhead pipeline to
transport heavy crude from Canada to Cushing. Holly hopes to
have both the reversed pipeline and the 70-mile line in service
as early as fourth-quarter 2009, with a projected capacity of
60,000 b/sd.
Holly is implementing capital improvement projects on the Navajo refinery to increase its feedstock flexibility with an eye toward
processing as much as 40,000 b/sd of heavier Canadian crudes.
These projects are expected to be completed in fourth-quarter
2009. Holly is also expanding Navajo’s overall capacity to 100,000
b/sd from 85,000 b/sd and expects this work to be mechanically
complete by first-quarter 2009. ✦

CORE ﬁghts ‘energy racism’

Sam Fletcher
Senior Writer
Roy Innis, chairman of the Congress
of Racial Equality, has come out swinging against “elitist” environmentalists,
politicians, and the nonprofit foundations that fund them for promoting
“energy racism” by cutting off access
to fossil fuels in the US and pushing up
energy prices.
“They cause poor families to lose
their homes. They make life tougher for
families who’ve worked, struggled, and
sacrificed to join the middle class. Then
they throw out crumbs that make us
beggars at the American banquet,” Innis
said in his book Energy Keepers-Energy
Killers: The New Civil Rights Battle,
published by Merril Press. “The fight
over energy is the critical civil rights
battle of our era,” said Innis. “Simply
put, energy transforms the civil rights
enshrined in our Constitution into civil
rights we enjoy in reality.”
Federal lands belong to all US citizens and are supposed to be developed
as well as preserved. However, Innis
charges, “The reality is that these lands
are held for affluent, highly educated,
white, politically savvy environmentalists” who spend “enough money
to support dozens of poor families
for years, pressuring our government
to post those resources into energy
graveyards and turning thousands of
hard-working blue collar families into
beggars.”
With the same passion that he once

fought segregation, Innis said, “We have
a right to sit at the energy lunch counter—to not be forced to sit at the back
of the energy bus.” He said, “We have
to reframe the debate. It’s not about the
environment.... The real debate is over
civil rights—yours and mine—and civil
wrongs, the ones committed by energy
killers.”

Energy killers
People “who produce energy for everything we do, everything we buy, everything we dream of,” Innis designates
as energy providers. The “Bull Connor”
energy killers, he said, “are people who
try to stop them: activists and politicians against oil and gas drilling, against
coal mining, against nuclear power,
against all energy production, choking
off the abundant, reliable, affordable
American resources we need.”
Opponents accuse oil companies of
price gouging. But the “nearly 50¢ in
taxes” on a gallon of gasoline is “government price gouging,” Innis said.
Stacks of “dubious environmental rules”
that delay or prevent energy production
is “regulatory price gouging.” Placing
off limits federal land “with years worth
of oil, gas, coal, nuclear, and other
energy resources” is “environmentalist
price gouging.” Legislation “that forces
us to use politically correct ‘renewable’
energy like wind and solar that’s expensive, unreliable, land-gobbling, and unable to produce enough fuel or electricity for a modern society” is “ideological
price gouging,” he said.
Independent oil companies are particularly vulnerable to activists’ attacks.
“These good, hard-working people
are being marginalized, demonized,
and destroyed by self-centered ecobigots who look down on them as less

deserving, less than human, in fact—as
a despised minority, and I know what
that’s like,” said Innis.
He faults Al Gore for his “mansion” that “consumes more electricity
every month than the average American
household uses in an entire year” and
for the use of carbon offsets to buy his
way into “climate heaven.” He criticizes
Hillary Clinton for campaigning in private jets that emit more carbon dioxide
in 2 hours “than the average American
family generates in a year.” He knocks
Barack Obama for claiming climate
change is the biggest threat facing black
American families today. “Not child
welfare mothers ‘raising’ illegitimate
children in fatherless families. Not substandard, incompetent schools ruled by
incivility and violence, and turning out
kids who can’t read or do math. Not
intolerable unemployment levels among
black males. Not uneducated youths
suited for gangs but not jobs. Climate
change,” Innis said.
Meanwhile, “rich white retirees,
wealthy celebrities, and fancy-free heirs
living on daddy’s money” are locking up
key energy resources in the US. “They
can’t stand seeing drilling rigs, oil and
gas fields, mines, timber cutting, or even
ranching operations, no matter how
small, in ‘their’ backyards,” he said.
“Sometimes I think environmentalists would rather see you jobless,
homeless, or even dead than to support
fossil fuel use, even the best, cleanest,
and most abundant,” said Innis. “The
fear and loathing that some have for oil,
natural gas, coal, and nuclear power is
no excuse for us, our policy makers, or
our courts to ignore energy reality and
widen our energy gap by promoting renewable illusions and closing off access
to the real energy we need.” ✦

The webcast will discuss highlights of Oil & Gas Journal’s annual Midyear Forecast, a
special report that appeared in the July 14 edition. The Midyear Forecast uses ﬁrst-half
data to update projections that appeared in OGJ’s Annual Forecast and Review this past
January. Both reports project oil and gas markets through the end of the year worldwide,
analyze demand product by product in the US, and forecast drilling activity in the US
and Canada.
The webcast, to be presented by OGJ Editor Bob Tippee, will summarize the Midyear
Forecast projections in key categories, note important changes from January’s forecasts,
and examine reasons for the adjustments. Marilyn Radler, Senior Editor-Economics, and
G. Alan Petzet, Chief Editor-Exploration, will be on hand for questions. Marilyn compiles
and writes the Midyear Forecast market projections. Alan assembles the drilling forecast.

Prices and energy plans
As they have throughout history, high oil prices
are evoking calls for new patterns of energy supply
and use. The response comes naturally to markets
and politics, unleashing the creative potential
those systems represent. If not held in check,
though, it also gives way easily to costly excess.
High oil prices help new energy forms migrate
from the economic margin into the market. Movement of this type is evident and, for a world with
an energy appetite outgrowing its supply menu,
beneficial.

Distortions and costs
Inevitably, however, some market participants
turn to politics for competitive advantage while
politicians turn to markets as tools of influence.
Energy forms then advance not because they
gain economic footing but because they win the
enshrinement of policy. Distortions can result, fattening costs.
Plans central to this process articulate what
“we” should do about energy now that high oil
prices reveal the failure of whatever “we” did
about energy beforehand. And they burrow into
public consciousness encased in marketing packages that, even when proposals differ, bear common elements. Examples appear in two otherwise
disparate proposals now swooping into the news.
Former Vice-Pres. Al Gore and oil and gas
producer T. Boone Pickens both assert crisis. With
stratospheric oil prices hurting people and economies, that’s appropriate. But price pain alone isn’t
crisis enough when the appeal is for overhauling
patterns of energy use and supply.
For Gore, who wants to end the use of fossil energy for power generation within 10 years,
crisis stands on three legs: economic problems,
global warming, and security threats, all linked by
reliance on carbon-based energy. Pickens, who’s
promoting wind power to free up natural gas for
use as vehicle fuel, heralds a similar three-fold crisis—economy, environment, and security—with
US “addiction” to foreign oil as the centerpiece.
Like all efforts to overhaul energy patterns,
those of Gore and Pickens deploy extravagant
rhetoric. The former vice-president sees a country
“awakening to the challenge of a present danger”

at what he describes as a “generational moment.”
The oil producer hails the US as “the Saudi Arabia
of wind power.”
And, of course, both energy plans have dragons
to slay. Gore’s include oil companies and “defenders of the status quo,” both of which come under
incongruous assault with this delusion: “When
people rightly complain about higher gasoline
prices, we propose to give more money to the
oil companies and pretend that they’re going to
bring prices down.” Who’s proposing to “give” oil
companies anything? And how can grown-ups still
believe oil companies control prices? Pickens is
more subtle but nevertheless clear about the beasts
he would vanquish: foreign sources of oil.
As do most energy plans born of high oil
prices, the Gore and Pickens programs shout their
promises but mumble their costs. Gore avers, “This
goal is achievable, affordable, and transformative.” In response to those daring to ask about the
economics of replacing fossil energy with costlier
substitutes, Gore says, “I ask them to consider
whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop
increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting
energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand
all around the world.” Pickens cites costs not of
his program but of imported oil over 10 years at
current oil prices, calling the result “the greatest
transfer of wealth in the history of mankind.”

Room to fall
Here, especially, both plans falter, as grand
energy plans—not to mention investments—have
before. To Gore’s question whether prices of oil
and coal will stop increasing, history, economic
theory, and the past week’s market news all answer
loudly, Yes! The Pickens extrapolation assumes oil
prices will stay at currently aberrant levels for 10
years. Prices never stay at any level that long. At
present, they have lots of room to fall.
Plans to overhaul energy patterns appear when
oil prices rise stressfully and disappear when
prices fall—unless they become policy. Unlike
today’s prices, policies do tend to last. That’s worth
remembering in assessments of the Gore and Pickens plans and others sure to follow. ✦

to be widespread inflation in 1970,

COMMENT
for a return of punitive, self-defeating
measures directed at companies that
produce the nation’s fuels. Congress
is once again
considering two
previously tried
“remedies” for
controlling US
energy prices—
the imposition of
“windfall profits”
taxes on US oil and gas producers and
the imposition of price controls on domestically produced oil, gasoline, and
other petroleum products.
Lawmakers no longer are widely
discussing governmental incentives
for the oil, gas, and biofuels industries
to facilitate development of additional
supplies as a means of better controlling
US energy prices.
This article revisits the 1970s and
1980s, an inflationary period in which
the federal government intervened with
price controls on oil and products and
the imposition of a windfall profits tax
on oil production. As a regulator during
this period of maximum regulation,
this author developed a unique perspective that may be missing in current
energy policy debates.
Government can act beneficially
by encouraging development of an
adequate and affordable energy supply,
including innovative Department of
Energy (DOE) programs that support
the growth of renewable fuels projects.
These could be adapted to support large
increases in the supply of all fuels.

US can manage energy cost
without ‘punishing’ industry
Tim Sklar
Sklar & Associates
Murrells Inlet, SC

Congress passed the Economic Stabilization Act (ESA) giving the president
broad powers to regulate prices and
wages. In 1971 President Richard M.
Nixon used the act to impose price and
wage controls on all sections of the
economy, using a newly formed Cost of
Living Council, headed by John Dunlop.
Wage and price controls were lifted
after several months on all but the oil
industry, and the newly formed Federal
Energy Office (FEO) assumed responsibility for the administration of price
controls on domestic oil and petroleum
products. Shortly thereafter, the Federal
Energy Administration (FEA) became
a permanent agency, and DOE subsequently absorbed FEA’s operations.
Nixon’s price control program
covered the period from November
1971 through December 1980, when
Congress enacted the crude oil windfall
profit tax with the support of President
Jimmy Carter.

Nixon’s price controls

Nixon first used the ESA of 1970 in
August 1971. In Phase I, he instituted a
price freeze, imposing price and wage
ceilings on the products, services, and
wages of most US businesses. In November 1971, a Phase II price control
regimen allowed all firms—other than
those in the oil and gas industry—
to increase prices, based on average
increases in their costs. Initially, Phase II
ceilings had little impact on petroleum
products prices because crude oil prices
had remained stable. But during the

increases. But by March 1973, large
heating oil price increases put public
pressure on the Nixon administration
to reimpose stricter price controls on
heating oil. As a result, Special Rule No.
1 was issued, which reestablished heating oil price ceilings for the 23 largest
domestic oil companies.
Phase III remained in effect through
August 1973, creating a number of unforeseen problems. Imported oil prices
began to increase, but Phase III price
controls did not allow the 23 refiners
to pass through their increased costs to
independent resellers or consumers. As
a consequence, refiners began to reduce
oil imports and cut back product sales
to independent marketers.

Old vs. new oil
The ensuing shortages aroused
public pressure on Congress and the administration and resulted in Congress’s
enacting the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act (EPAA) in November 1973.
This act froze existing buyer-seller
relationships as they existed in 1972. It
also created a two-tiered system of price
controls on domestic oil, namely “old
oil” and “new oil.”
Old oil was determined by computing the average monthly amounts
produced from each oil-producing
property in 1972 (the base production control level or “BPCL”), and the
“ceiling price” for each barrel of old oil
was its posted price at the start of Phase
III. New oil was any oil produced from
that same property above the property’s
BPCL. New oil could then be valued and
sold at the free market price.
In addition, price controls on
products became more complex. Some
products were decontrolled, while others, such as gasoline, diesel fuel, and
heating oil, could be increased above
their historical base prices through
a complex set of allocations of unrecouped costs. This scheme was flexible and porous enough to allow most
refiners to sell at market prices. It also
created a regulatory nightmare for the
FEO and FEA.
Because thousands of oil-producing

properties in the US produced only

to small independent producers, to government entities, and to other preferred
groups.
Over 1980-88, the WPT produced
$227.3 billion in tax revenues, which
the US Treasury collected but did not
return to consumers. The WPT did
not generate as much revenue as was
predicted because oil prices did not
increase as expected. And in 1986, the
price of oil collapsed, and WPT collections were greatly reduced. The only
real impact the WPT had was counterproductive; it contributed to the
reduction of domestic oil production by
3-6% and to an increase in oil imports
by 8-16%. As with price controls, this
punitive measure provided no direct
benefit to the consumer and may have
contributed to higher energy prices.
One can easily be misled into believing that it is sound energy policy to set
ceilings on oil company earnings and
earmark the windfall profits tax revenues collected to support governmentsponsored energy policy initiatives.
But based on experience, such a WPT
applied against oil company profits
would more than likely prove to be
counterproductive. It takes continued
and substantial investment to find oil,
to upgrade and expand refining capacity, to perfect energy alternatives, and
to build distribution and marketing
infrastructure.
To remain competitive, oil companies must reinvest today’s profits in
projects needed to meet future energy
demand. Because these reinvestments
are often high-risk, imposing a WPT on
oil companies presumes that the government is in a better position to decide
how to reinvest in the energy sector. It
also presumes that if excess profits are
left with oil companies they will not
reinvest. These presumptions are wrong.
Because it is in the best interests of oil
companies and their shareholders to
reinvest in projects they believe will be
viable, most of them do.
Further, there is no evidence to suggest that in periods of higher profits, oil
companies increase dividend distribuOil & Gas Journal / July 28, 2008

Supply, demand drove oil prices, says CFTC-led taskforce
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Fundamental supply and demand
forces provide the best explanation for
recent crude oil price increases, concluded a staff report for the Interagency
Task Force on Commodity Markets.
“If a group of market participants
has systematically driven prices, detailed daily position data should show
that [the] group’s position changes
preceded price changes. The taskforce’s
preliminary analysis, based on the evidence available to date, suggests that
changes in futures market participation
by speculators have not systematically
preceded price changes,” the report
said in its executive summary.
“On the contrary, most speculative

in tune to the real-time dynamics of
supply and demand,” Bingaman said.
John Cornyn (R-Tex.) responded that
Democrats have indicated that excessive
energy commodities speculation represents only about 20% of the oil price
problem. “Why aren’t we addressing
the other 80%? Republicans would like
to solve 100% of the problem, assuming that’s possible,” he said.
He conceded that many Democrats
are right when they argue that US oil
and gas resources represent a relatively
small portion of the world’s remaining
reserves. “It’s important for Congress
to realize that the one place we have
the power to do something is on lifting
the moratoriums on 85% of the Outer
Continental Shelf and to authorize
leasing within the 2,000-acre postage
stamp within the huge Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge. Yet every time Republicans try to bring up a bill to develop a
new energy resource, Democrats block
it,” Cornyn said.
Byron L. Dorgan (D-ND) said Republicans simply were asking the Senate
to make false choices. “It’s fascinating to
hear them come out and do this. Every

traders typically alter their positions
following price changes, just as one
would expect in an efﬁciently operating
market,” it added.
The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission formed the taskforce
in June with representatives from the
Departments of Agriculture, Energy,
and the Treasury, the Federal Reserve’s
Board of Governors, the Federal Trade
Commission, and the Securities and
Exchange Commission. It issued a
45-page interim report limited to the
crude oil market on July 22 because the
issue of high oil prices is so important
and timely, the CFTC said.
“The recent upward surge in the
price of crude oil has signiﬁcantly

affected American consumers and
businesses. This staff report reﬂects the
collective knowledge of some of our
governments’ best economists,” said
the taskforce’s chairman, CFTC Chief
Economist Jeffrey Harris.
“Each of the participating agencies
brings unique expertise to the taskforce, and this interim report, for the
ﬁrst time, attempts to compile the government’s best available information
and analysis into one report. We hope
that it will serve as a useful resource
concerning the crude oil market and
will contribute to the public discussion
of important energy issues,” he said.
The taskforce will continue to evaluate commodity market conditions and
will report on its additional work later
this year, Harris said. ✦

10 years or so, the same people come
out and say find more and use less. We
need something that’s game-changing.
You won’t get that from those who say
do the same thing, only drill deeper,”
he said.
Speculators have grown from 37%
of the total oil futures market in 2000
to 71% in 2008, he added. “There’s no
other explanation for oil’s price doubling
within a year. Will the minority support
this bill to address excessive speculation
or simply insist on producing more? It’s
long past time for this country to change
its energy mix. Drilling is not the only
answer,” Dorgan said.
Carl M. Levin (D-Mich.) said the
Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations found in four separate
inquiries that speculators are playing a
bigger role on oil commodities markets, growing from 20% in 2000 to
40% in 2008. These estimates are an
understatement since the CFTC classifies
index funds as commercial traders, he
said. “The need to control speculation is
urgent. The president and chief executive officers of our major airlines have
said so,” Levin said.

‘Message is clear’
But Pete V. Domenici (R-NM), the
Energy and Natural Resources Committee’s ranking minority member, said
Republicans will insist that other issues
be addressed. “In overwhelming majorities, the American people have said
they want more energy production here
at home. In response to this clarion call,
it looks as if the majority will have to
be dragged, kicking and screaming, into
even discussing these issues. It seems
content to hang its hat on commodities
speculation and a so-called ‘Use it or
lose it’ strategy,” he said.
Acknowledging that Reid has said
Republicans could offer their drilling
amendment and Democrats would offer
their own, Domenici said much more

Cavaney raises
important points

I

n a week that began with US President George W. Bush’s rescinding
the presidential Outer Continental
Shelf oil and gas leasing withdrawal
and ended with the US House defeating the latest bill incorporating “Use
it or lose it” provisions, American
Petroleum Institute President Red Cavaney raised some important points.
“In the ongoing energy debate,
far too much time is being wasted
in discussing what form of energy
should be favored and which disadvantaged in meeting our country’s
needs,” he said in a July 16 keynote
address to the US Energy Association’s Energy Supply Forum.
“Every respected energy study on
future demand comes to a similar
conclusion about the next several
decades: We need all the energy that is
economically viable to produce in an
environmentally sensitive manner, as
well as energy efficiency at levels heretofore unrealized,” Cavaney observed.
Increasingly, what happens globally affects energy in general, and oil
in particular, domestically. Current
concerns about crude oil and gasoline prices underscore energy’s link
with the general economy, he said.

the world’s energy demand will be
met by oil and natural gas in 2030, as
is the case today,” Cavaney said.
He cited often quoted US Minerals
Management Service estimates of 18
billion bbl of oil and 76 tcf of gas believed to be waiting beneath the 85%
of the Outer Continental Shelf that is
still off-limits in the Lower 48 states.
But he also mentioned that only
17% of nonpark, nonwilderness
lands that the federal government
administers is open to energy development under standard lease terms.
The US Bureau of Land Management
has said the remaining land holds an
estimated 19 billion bbl of oil and 94
tcf of gas, Cavaney said.

Growing recognition

“Several recent polls show that
many Americans have a growing
recognition that our nation must do
more to find and develop the domestic oil and gas resources we need, both
onshore and offshore,” he continued.
A survey that Cable News Network
and Opinion Research Corp. conducted in June found that 73% of those
sampled favored increased drilling
in US waters, he noted. “And a Fox
News-Opinion Dynamics poll, also

which involved amendments) and contained 49 amendments of 331 which
were proposed when it was finally approved, Domenici said.
He also attacked the Democrats’ “Use
it or lose it” proposal, which he said
originated with the Wilderness Society,
an environmental organization that has
sued to stop oil and gas development.
“The tracts are already leased, and oil
companies are trying to get the maximum return on their investments. In
contrast, Congress currently continues
to restrict access to 574 million acres of
the OCS. It’s clear who’s sitting on domestic oil and gas resources,” Domenici
said.
Other Republicans suggested that
Reid’s bill could have harmful consequences. “It could limit investment
opportunities for seniors’ pension funds
and drive US jobs overseas. All it does
is delay other efforts that could make
a difference,” said John Ensign (Nev.).
“Efforts to address market manipulation
require a careful balance. Increased visibility should not translate into excessive regulation,” said John Barrasso
(Wyo.).
“Democrats have said from the start
that curbing excessive speculation is not
a panacea for high oil prices. But it’s
obviously an attempt to solve a major
part of the problem. This kind of speculation wasn’t even legal 8 years ago.
Traders had to accept delivery of oil,
something Wall Street investment banks
weren’t prepared to do. We’re willing to
give Republicans a vote on their drilling
amendment to get this bill passed. But
Democrats would like to vote on their
drilling proposal too,” Reid said. ✦

Pertamina import ‘irregularities’ examined
Eric Watkins
Senior Correspondent
Indonesia’s state-owned PT Pertamina, already a candidate for government scrutiny over corruption in the
upstream sector, is facing charges by
legislators of “irregularities” in its im26

portation of crude oil and products.
“Pertamina’s imports of gasoline
and diesel are always more expensive
than those of...Singapore,” said Tjatur
Saptoedy, a member of the House of
Representatives’ inquiry committee.
Tjatur said that based on Pertamina’s
calculation, from January to May this

year the company spent 1.18 trillion rupiah ($128 million) more than
similar transactions would have cost in
Singapore.
In 2007, he said, Pertamina imported 321,000 b/d of crude and
300,000-350,000 b/d of fuel to help
meet domestic need of 1 million b/d in

fuel. The country’s six refineries could
produce only 652,000 b/d.
Several factors have been cited for
the high cost of imports, including
a lack of transparency in the import
process and the company’s partnership
with oil brokers that have insufficient
capacity.
While Pertamina claims to have 42
brokers for importing crude and 50
for fuel products, Tjatur said just 5-7
brokers regularly win tenders for the
import procurements.
“I am really wondering why these
companies frequently win the bidding. Some of them don’t even have
the products or the refineries,” he
said, adding that some bidders apparently have inside information, enabling
them to bid on tenders more quickly
than others.
“Only those who had obtained information beforehand would win the
tenders,’ said Tjatur, noting that one
tender opened on July 14 and closed
on July 18, leaving interested parties
“next to no time” to prepare for the
bid.
Pertamina Pres. Ari H. Soemarno defended his company’s purchasing practices, saying, “We always take efficiency
and reliability into consideration when
carrying out procurements.”
Tjatur’s remarks came ahead of formal investigations into the country’s oil
and gas industry that are due to begin
soon.
The House has set up an inquiry
committee aimed primarily at investigating the causes of inefficiency in the
country’s energy sector. The committee’s
investigations are scheduled to start in
mid-August.
In addition to the parliamentarians’
investigation, recent reports say Indonesia’s Corruption Eradication Commission as well as its upstream oil and gas
supervisory agency, BPMigas, also are
creating a team to evaluate the monitoring mechanisms in the upstream oil and
gas industry. ✦

Markets ready for rise in Canadian oil sands production
Steven Poruban
Senior Editor
Production of Canadian oil sands
bitumen will continue to rise in the
coming decades but not without advances in processing technologies and
the adoption by producers of varied
strategies to market the resulting heavy
crude blends.
These were some of the issues raised
by speakers July 15 during the opening
session of the second annual Oil Sands
& Heavy Oil Technologies Conference &
Exhibition in Calgary.
Tension was palpable at the opening
session regarding one topic in particular: growing concerns in Canada about
finicky talk in the US concerning the
type of oil it allows to cross its borders.
This hot-button issue has its impetus in a resolution the US Conference
of Mayors adopted last month that
is modeled on a section in last year’s
Energy Independence and Security Act,
which raised alarm about the potential environmental drawbacks of oil
sands. The resolution calls for bans on
purchases, for use in city vehicles, of
any fuel with life-cycle emissions of
greenhouse gases deemed excessive

oil sands producers’ concerns hinge
largely on such a resolution’s gaining serious political steam during an
already strongly polarized presidential
election in the US.

protocols. Differences include the number of steps, the amount of manpower,
and the large capital resources required
to extract and process oil sands. Transporting the finished products also is
more complex for oil sands, and the
environmental and social impact of its
development is far greater than conventional resources, Hyne noted.
Regarding the changes and advancements needed to continue to process oil
sands and heavy oil, Hyne said, “There
are too many people in the business we
are in who are still thinking ‘inside the
box.’” According to Hyne, there are vast
new and different protocols that can be
implemented that better meet the needs
of responsible, profitable, and sustainable energy production from the oil
sands.
Hyne pointed out that the features
of the new and different operational
infrastructure for oil sands include the
amounts and toxicity of their emissions,
getting the resource to the surface—and
moving it once there—how and where
to upgrade the resource, the certainty of
the reserves, and fighting the image of

of refineries without coking or asphalt

technology to reduce vacuum gas oil

Wise said environmental issues will
continue to impact the oil sands markets, adding that because greenhouse
gas issues are so politically charged,
clear government policies are needed.
It is lack of this clarity that has delayed
a number of upgrading projects, he
said.

The value of oil sands

Robert Fryklund, vice-president of
global exploration and production critical analysis for IHS, discussed the oil
sands from the perspective of business
developers. To date, more than 1 trillion
bbl of oil has been produced globally,
Fryklund said, which compares with
the estimated 1.7 trillion bbl of original
bitumen in place in the Canadian oil
sands.

Alberta keeps oil sands’ environmental impacts in check
Steven Poruban
Senior Editor
The burgeoning development of
Alberta’s vast oil sands resources and its
effect on the province’s land, water, and
air is being closely and carefully monitored by government officials as well as
other environmental research agencies
to ensure its sustainability.
This was the main message conveyed
July 16 by several keynote speakers to
delegates attending the Oil Sands &
Heavy Oil Technologies Conference &
Exhibition in Calgary.
“The theme for the conference sums it
up very well—Stepping Up: Preparation
for Growing Expansion,” said Len Webber,
parliamentary assistant, Alberta Energy.
“Alberta is stepping up to our responsibility to ensure our energy resources are
developed responsibly,” he said.
Last year, Alberta exported about
1.35 million b/d of crude to the US,
supplying 13% of American crude oil
imports, Webber said, adding that while
Alberta continues to garner more global
attention, it has “become more important than ever for Alberta to maintain a
stable environment for investors.”
He added, “At the same time, it’s vital
that we ensure the environmentally responsible development of our oil sands.”

Addressing climate change
Admitting that there was probably
no bigger environmental issue currently
than climate change, Webber reported
that Alberta’s oil sands compose only
about 4% of Canada’s overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. “As an
entire country, Canada is responsible for
about 2% of global emissions,” he said,
adding, “Putting that in perspective,
Alberta’s oil sands contribute less than
one tenth of 1% of all GHG emissions
in the world.”
Eddy Isaacs, executive director, Alberta Energy Research Institute (AERI),
told conference attendees that in 2006,

Alberta GHG emissions, by facility,
broke down into power plants emitting
51.7 million tonnes, oil sands emitting
24 million tonnes, and heavy oil emitting 6.8 million tonnes.
Webber noted that Alberta is backing
up words about climate change concerns with action, reminding attendees
about the recent launch of two $2 billion initiatives: one designed to advance
large-scale carbon capture and storage
(CCS) projects and the other to propel
public transit across the province.
Earlier this year, Alberta released a
climate change plan of action designed
to reduce its GHG emissions by 2050
by 50%, or 200 million tonnes/year.
“CCS will be responsible for reducing
70% of our GHG emissions in 2050,”
Webber said.
Last year, Webber noted, Alberta
became the first jurisdiction in North
America to legislate GHG reductions of
large industrial facilities. “By law, the
largest industrial facilities, including oil
sands facilities, must reduce their emissions intensity by 12%,” he said.
Webber explained: “Facilities can
choose to reduce emissions by making
operating improvements that will result
in reductions. They can buy Albertabased credits from other large emitters who’ve reduced their emissions.
Or they can contribute $15/tonne to
a fund that will direct money towards
strategic projects or technology aimed
at reducing GHG emissions.”
He said, “Results from the first year
indicate that companies made 2.6 million tonnes of actual reductions. That’s
equivalent to taking 550,000 vehicles
off the road in a year.”

Land, water, and air
Webber said, “You might have heard
that the oil sands lie beneath a region
about the size of Florida—roughly
54,000 sq miles—over 140,000 sq
km.” However only about 162 sq miles,
or about 500 sq km, have been dis-

turbed by oil sands activity to date, he
said, adding, “That’s less than 1% of the
total oil sands area.”
Under Alberta’s strict reclamation
standards, Webber said, “every inch of
land that is disturbed must be reclaimed
so it can be productive again.”
Alberta also places strict limits on
industry water use, Webber said, adding,
“Some might have you believe that oil
sands projects are using nothing but fresh,
drinkable water to extract bitumen.”
In fact, Webber stated, “Oil sands
developers have drastically reduced their
need to draw fresh water. Some recycle
more than 90% of the water used in
their operations and use saline water instead of fresh water wherever possible.”
Kate Rich, with the science and standards branch of Alberta Environment, a
newly established division that focuses on
policy development, told conference delegates that about 2-5 bbl of fresh water is
being used for every 1 bbl of oil produced
in mines and 0.5 bbl or less of fresh water
being used for in situ production.
Several frameworks have been established, Rich said, noting as an example
the Athabasca River Water Management
Framework, which sets strict limits on
how much water can be withdrawn.
This amount of water is reduced, she
said, during environmentally sensitive,
or low-flow times.
Regarding air quality, Webber stated
that it was important for people to
know that it is being monitored 24
hr/day, 365 days/year. “It is tested for
carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide,
ozone, fine particulate matter, sulfur
dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide,” he said.
“In 2007, for example, air quality
near Fort McMurray was rated good or
better 98% of the time,” Webber said.
Alberta Environment’s Rich explained that set objectives for Alberta’s
air management require the adoption
of best-available technologies. “We do
want to keep what’s clean, clean,” she
said. ✦

MODELING
GULF OF MEXICO
LOST PRODUCTION—4
(Conclusion)

& DEVE

L O P M E N T

Valuing lost production from
destroyed structures is an important
measure in investment decision making,
since if the value of future production
is less than the expected redevelopment
and cleanup cost, then the decision to
redevelop the property will either be
postponed or not undertaken.
In the final part of this series, we
present a meta-model framework
to quantify
the quantity
and value of
lost production from the
2004-05 hurricane seasons.
Previously,
in Part 3, we presented sensitivity
graphs and similar charts to illustrate
the manner in which system parameters
impact the model output. In Part 4,
we describe the use of a more sophisticated, and in many respects, more
useful technique to explore sensitivity
analysis and the complex interactions
of assumptions on model output. We
illustrate the technique with examples.

Model formulation
The meta-model methodology follows the basic development in Part 2
but with important structural differences (Fig. 1).

STEP 1: Initialization
The user selects the variables of
interest and quantifies the manner in
which they vary. This involves choosing
the model variables, distribution functions and parameters.
The input set is user-defined and
varies with the objectives of the analysis
and the problem formulation. The
distribution of each input variable is
largely a design choice.
We employ the following variables:
the price of oil and gas (Po, Pg), the
threshold multiplier a, and the discount
rate D. The decline curve parameter d
for structures that do not yield a best-fit
curve is also a model input. The input
parameters are denoted by the vector
(d, Po, Pg, a, D), although we also use
the notation (X1, X2, …, Xn) to indicate the general nature of the model
variables and the fact that their specification is both user-defined and problem
specific.
Parameter Xi is governed by distribution function fi, i = 1, …, n. The
specification of the function may be
determined by empirical analysis or by
user preference.
For example, if the historic price of
oil is determined to follow a lognormal
distribution according to the parameters μ and σ2, Po ~ LN(μ, σ2), the user
may model future prices according
to this distribution or may prefer to

assume some other distribution type,
such as the uniform distribution, Po ~
U(a, b).
Our preference is to maintain reasonable assumptions and bounds on
the function parameters, recognizing
that problem tasks and individual bias
allows for a wide range of variation.

STEP 2a: Production
and Revenue Forecast

Design space geometry (Fig. 2)
The model input variables (X1, X2, …,
Xn) denote a “point” in n-dimensional
space Rn. The speciﬁcation of fi for each
parameter Xi, i = 1, …, n, will generate
an n-dimensional geometric body B ⊂
Rn. The number of variables speciﬁed
determines the dimension of B. The size
and shape of B is determined by the
form of the distributions.
In the special case where each model variable is assumed to range over
a uniform distribution, Xi ~ U(ai, bi), Xi
is bound between ai and bi, ai <bi, i =
1, …, n, and the body B will transform
into an n-dimensional hypercube ∑:
∑: {(X1, ..., Xn) | ai ≤Xi ≤bi, i = 1, …, n}.
The end points of each interval
determine the boundary of the hypercube, and since each variable is
selected uniformly, the density of the
resulting geometric body will be homogeneous.
The size, shape, and location of the

The value of a in Equation 1 is used

Ta(s) denotes the time when production is no longer commercial. At time t
= Ta(s), the operator is assumed to stop
producing, which will terminate the
cash flow vector: r(s) = (r1, r2, ..., rT (s)).

The model curves for each structure
are used to forecast future oil and gas
production under the assumption of
stable reservoir and investment conditions.
The production forecast for oil and

Example 1 (Fig. 4)

Example 2 (Fig. 5)

To illustrate application of the
model output, consider the lost oil
production functional Qo(Γ). The
model output for total lost oil production in the GOM yields
Qo(Γ) = –2.7E7d + 3.31E5Po +
2.84E6Pg – 1.52E6a.
The coefﬁcients of the regression
model are all of the expected sign
and statistically signiﬁcant.
If we evaluate the lost oil functional for any parameter vector
within the design space; i.e., (d, Po,
Pg, a) ∈∑, we will obtain the average
value for lost oil production for the
parameter input selected.
For example, for (d, Po, Pg, a) =
(0.10, 120, 8, 1.5), we obtain Qo(Γ) =
–2.7E6 + 39.72E6 + 22.72E6 – 2.34 E6
= 57.4 million bbl. In this case, we
see that if the average future price of
oil and gas are $120/bbl and $8/Mcf,
then at a 10% decline rate, lost oil
production is estimated at 57 million
bbl.
The price of oil and gas are the
most signiﬁcant factors, being about
an order-of-magnitude larger than
the contribution from the decline parameter d and a multiplier. If future
oil prices average $60/bbl, cumulative lost oil production is estimated
at 37.5 million bbl.

The present value for [A], [B], and
[A]+[B] class structures are determined as
PVA = 7.35E3Po + 3.27E4Pg –
8.24E4a – 2.07E6D,
PVB = –2.6E6d + 2.6E4Po + 2.45E4Pg
– 960a – 1.20E6D,
PVA+B = –2.9E6d + 2.14E4Po +
1.56E4Pg + 4.84E4a – 9.1E5D.
The signs of the coefﬁcients are
consistent with expectations, and
the relative contribution of terms
is easily ascertained. The present
value of lost oil and gas production
provided by [A] class structures is
computed at PVA = $623.7 million if
(Po, Pg, a, D) = (100, 8, 0.75, 0.15), For
[B]-class structures, PVB(d, Po, Pg, a,
D) = PVB(0.15, 70, 6, 1.25, 0.1) = $1.46
billion.

fixed term (intercept) of the functional
and there are no expectations on its
sign. Depending upon the model type
and user preference, the fixed term
coefficient may be excluded from the
formulation.
The coefficient α1 is associated with
model parameter d, which defines the
rate of decline of production for those
structures that have less than 7 years
production history or did not yield a
best-fit decline curve. The value of d
will therefore “control” only that portion of annual production associated
with young structures or where curve
fitting was not successful.

As d increases, production at each
structure will decline faster and reach
its economic limit sooner, and so the
quantity of reserves and their value will
also decline. We would expect α1 <0 for
the Qo, Qg, and V functionals because
increasing d will lead to declining cumulative production and value.
The coefficients α2 and α3 are associated with the price of oil and gas, respectively. As Po and Pg increase, revenue
will increase, delaying the onset of the
economic limit of each asset.
This in turn promotes the production of additional reserves, which at
an elevated price level, will lead to a
greater discounted cash flow. Thus,
increasing (decreasing) Po and-or Pg
will lead to increases (decreases) across
all the outputs Qo, Qg, and V, and so we
would expect α2, α3 >0.
The coefficient α4 is associated with
the multiplier a which is used to vary
the economic threshold τa. The variable a ranges over a positive interval,
and as a increases, the value of a·τa(s)
will increase, forcing production out of
profitability at an earlier time. This will
reduce cumulative production, Qo and

Qg, and the value of production, V. The
coefficient α4 is expected to be negative
for Qo, Qg, and V.
The coefficient α5 is associated with
the discount rate D that is used to compute present value, and thus, will only
influence the valuation estimate V. The
behavior of discount rate with present
value is well known: as D increases, the
value of future cash flow declines, and
so we expect the sign of the coefficient
α5 to be negative. Coefficient α5 is not
included in the model specification for
cumulative production.

Function interpretation
The functional construct is used
to compute the expected value of the
output for any parameters that fall
within the design space, as well as to
investigate the impact of one or more
changes in the input parameters on the
model output. The functional represents
the average relation between the input
variables and model output for the
input parameters specified, and thus the
model coefficients must be interpreted
with respect to the geometry of the
design space (Fig. 2).

Model summary
A summary of the model structure is
provided in Fig. 3.

Model results
Design space
The parameters and distribution
functions that serve as model input are
shown in Table 1.
These parameters lead to a fourdimensional hypercube design space,
shown in Equation 7, where the oil and
gas price distributions are truncated at
two standard deviations.

Cumulative lost production
Following the modeling steps
described above, regression models
for cumulative lost oil, gas, and BOE
production are constructed as shown in
Table 2. In Fig. 4, an illustrative example
is provided.

Central Wilmington pipeline ends oil trucking

Oil production is increasing and
trucking oil has been eliminated from
the central part of Wilmington field in
Long Beach, Calif.
A new 10-in., 20,000 b/d oil
pipeline placed in service Mar. 14 now
transports crude to the ConocoPhillips
refinery at Carson, just north of Wilmington field. The pipeline eliminates 50
trips/day by tanker trucks, said Warren
Resources Inc., New York, which operates the Wilmington Townlot and North
Wilmington units.
The company’s two units are in the
central part of giant Wilmington field,
an 181⁄2-mile long structure that ranks
as the third largest oil field in the US in
terms of cumulative production after
Prudhoe Bay in Alaska and East Texas
field.
Production from the two units averaged 3,500-3,700 b/d in mid-June.
The units produced 243,000 bbl in the
quarter ended Mar. 31, up 51% on the
year. The company had booked 34 million bbl of net proved reserves in WTU
and 19 million bbl in NWU at the end
34

of 2007. The figures for WTU don’t
include further secondary recovery or
alkaline-surfactant-polymer flood potential. Warren Resources has also taken
steps to consume more associated gas
and may eventually be able to sell gas
from the units.

Oil operations
The WTU was producing 375 b/d
when Warren assumed operation in
2005.
The City of Los Angeles in 2006
approved the drilling of as many 540
directional oil and water injection
wells from as many as five cellars in the
WTU (see map, OGJ, Feb. 19, 2007, p.
36). Warren Resources has completed
construction of two cellars on one city
block in Long Beach, and about 100
wells are producing.
The 2008 capital budget for the
WTU is $42 million to drill or recomplete 30 producing wells and six water
injection wells and $16 million for
cellar construction and other facilities
improvements.

Gas potential
Warren Resources is also making
greater use of gas from the WTU.
The company has a permit to flare
as much as 93 Mcfd from the unit, and
in October 2007 it began operating six
microturbines that convert part of the
produced gas to electricity for field use.
The company also applied to the
South Coast Air Quality Management
District for a permit to install a high-efficiency, low-emission enclosed burner
to replace the existing flare. The microturbines will burn 140 Mcfd, and field
heater-treaters take 25 Mcfd.
Even though the current gas-oil ratio
is very low, continued Upper Terminal
and Ranger waterflood development
will boost gas output, and the company
is applying for short-term reinjection
permits, Gobble said.
Terminal/Ranger drilling and future
development of the deeper Ford formation, if successful, could eventually
boost gas volumes to salable levels. The
field’s underexplored basement Schist
zone also contains oil and gas. ✦

be controversial. Developing oil in one
of the world’s poorest countries during a time of war, civil war, and coups
carries huge risks. But when the World
Bank Group became involved, controversy was assured. The World Bank
acknowledges the project is the most
scrutinized project in the bank’s history.
Among the many controversies,
some dire and some perceived, is the
notion that Chad received a bad deal.
The assumption is that Chad simply
did not have the negotiating experience
of the oil companies. And, that inexperience or incompetence resulted in a

the book published by the Catholic
Relief Services and Bank Information
Center in February 2005.1 Although it
thoroughly evaluates the project, it also
provides a flawed comparison of Chad’s
take to other African oil producers.
Fig. 3 is from this report and shows
Chad’s take to be less than half the take
of other West African countries. The
message is compelling; however, the
analysis is flawed.
The industry defines take as the division of profits from a project over its
full life or full cycle, whereas Fig. 3 only
focuses on 8 years, 2002-10. Chad’s oil
did not start flowing until late 2003.
Most of the 8 years in Fig. 3 span
the early production in the Doba basin,
not full cycle. Early production years
represent the capital cost recovery phase
of a project. During this time it is common for the governments to receive
only their royalty while oil companies
recoup their investment.
With slow production and high
costs, the investing companies could
be in a non-tax-paying position for
several years. Because the comparison
in Fig. 3 does not cover the full life of
the project, it does not represent a true
division of profits or take for Chad but
most likely does for the other countries
shown.
Other statements from articles that
imply Chad received a much worst deal
include:
• “The World Bank’s own internal
report estimates that most of the $9
billion revenue from the project over
the next 28 years will accrue to the
corporations and banks; the Chad government will receive only $1.7 billion
(19%), with $505 million (6%) going
to Cameroon.”2
• “Chad currently gets 12.5% of the
royalties from its production of some
160,000 b/d, compared with the 80%
of oil production that Nigeria enjoys.”3
• “Revenue split: 1. Cameroon =
7%, 2. Chad = 22%, 3. Oil Consortium
= 71%,”4
• “Observe, for example, the difference in the mere 7% of revenues that
accrued to Chad in its earliest contracts

compared to the approximately 90% of
revenues going to the more experienced
and capable petrostates.”5
Four reasons why there is so much
confusion, particularly with the range
of values of Chad’s share of revenue or
take from these sources include:
1. Lack of transparency. A confidentiality
provision in the contract has kept important contractual details out of reach
of analysts.
2. Industry terminology. The World
Bank’s Project Appraisal Document
(PAD) added to the confusion with the
introduction of distributable returns,
which appears to represent a distribution of profits but certainly does not.
3. Chad royalty. The Chad royalty is
not a percentage of gross revenue, but
rather a percentage of gross revenue less
transportation costs.
4. Inexperience. There seems to be a
general misunderstanding of how petroleum fiscal systems work.
The following analysis uses information from three sources—the World
Bank’s Project Appraisal Document
(PAD) Report N. 19343 published
prior to construction, the World Bank’s
Implementation Completion Report No.
36560-TD (ICR) dated Dec. 15, 2006,

and EssoChad Quarterly Reports.
Table 1 summarizes data from the
two World Bank reports.

Anticipated production
The PAD anticipated Chad producing
(exporting) 883 million bbl between
2004 and 2027, with peak years of
production at 81 million bbl or about
225,000 bo/d (Fig. 4). The ICR lowered
production expectations to 748 million bbl and peak production of only
170,000 bo/d. These figures do not
agree necessarily with other sources.
There were also natural expectations
of increased investment, exploration,
and satellite field development once the
pipeline system was in place.

Crude quality
The oil from Kome, Miandoum,
and Bolobo fields constitutes the Doba
Blend, which has a heavy oil 18.8-20.5º
API gravity.
The Doba Blend wellhead price has a
discount from the price of Brent Blend,
with a 38.8° API gravity, to accommodate the quality differential and distance
to market.
The discount was expected to be
about 20% off the Brent price in the

rock quality. We estimated the effect of
rock quality uncertainty using these
combinations of correlation length of
the permeability field when generating
the geostatistical models:
• 7,500 ft (NW-SE): 2,500 ft (NESW).
• 2,500 ft: 800 ft.
• 2,500 ft: 1,250 ft.
• 800 ft: 2,500 ft.
• 750 ft: 250 ft.

• Two injection points (SI and SI 2)
with:
• Continuous injection.
• Toe injection, followed by heel
injection only.
• One injection point, far north end
of the lobe.
Fault transmissibility is one of the
uncertainties, and was modeled at 0%,
25%, 50%, and 100%.

To evaluate the effect of various combinations of all the options, BP implemented a TDRM approach. TDRM is a
philosophy for simplifying uncertainty
analysis that can provide the simplest
appropriate model for an optimal business decision.1 The workflow is highly
automated and enables customized
decision-making. BP’s assisted depletion
planning process, top-down depletion
planning (TDDP), was not used for this
study.2
Using TDRM to evaluate the effect
of the previously mentioned parameter
uncertainties generated 960 simulation runs. Fig. 2, which compares the
potential cumulative oil produced from
all the simulation runs, summarizes
the simulation results. The options that
involve injection only at the toe of the
southern injector and a single vertical northern injector are clearly suboptimal, yielding low ultimate recovery
because of quick water breakthrough
and water cycling.
The base case run has these parameters:
• Fault transmissibility: 0.5.

The TDRM gave insight into the
relative impacts of rock heterogeneity,
production well location, injection well
location, and transmissibility across the
southern fault.
We captured the effect of uncertainty
in rock property or heterogeneity by
varying the correlation length of the
permeability field of the geostatistical
model.
Fig. 3 summarizes the effect of rock
heterogeneity; it presents the cumulative oil produced and water cut as a
function of time. Ultimate oil recovery
is insensitive to the correlation length
of the permeability field.
Fig. 4 summarizes estimated cumulative oil production with the various
producer options. The base case with
production well 2-23A provides about
5 MMstb. Adding well 2-27 and well
2-20 adds another 1 MMstb to the
ultimate oil production. Well 2-19 has a
marginal impact on oil recovery.
Fig. 5 summarizes the projected
effect of various injection options on
ultimate oil production. Any combination of injection at the far north side
leads to early breakthrough and water
cycling, thereby yielding a low ultimate
oil recovery.
Based on the modeling, we expect
maximum oil recovery with slow
growth in the water cut with a single
(heel region of a high angle injector or
a vertical injector) injector on the south
of the fault or a horizontal injector
(with the heel to the south of the fault
and toe crossing to the north side of it).
We recommend the horizontal
injector option because this mitigates
the risk of low oil recovery due to the
uncertainty of location and throw of
the existing fault. A horizontal injector
can also provide a higher injection rate

All other cases yield more or less
the same ultimate oil recovery. We
chose the case that injects for about 1
year into the toe region followed by
injection into the heel region as the
optimal injection option for PUT River
development. This option increases the
reservoir pressure sufficiently above the
bubble point pressure during the first
year, assuring no release of solution gas
in the reservoir, allowing optimal oil
recovery.

mine the effect of various reservoir
parameter uncertainties.
This article shows this process
through practical examples. Detailed
numerical simulations led to the design
of the optimal development case for the
southern lobe of the PUT River sands:
1. Optimal producer option. Produce from wells 2-23A and 2-20 with
an option to produce from 06-07 and
2-27 in future.
2. Optimal injector option. Horizontal injector or southern vertical injector.
Using a horizontal injector mitigates
geological and fault uncertainty.
3. Inject in the middle 10-15 ft.
4. Upside potential for off take in
the far north and southwest.

Case 3. Inject into SI 1 only. Produce from 2-20 until the water cut is
96%, then shut in 2-20. Produce from
02-23A until the water cut is 96%, then
shut in 02-23A and produce from 2-27
and 6-07.
Comparing the data, we found that
Case 1 and Case 2 yield higher ultimate
oil recovery than Case 3. As described
earlier, however, Case 2 is preferred to
Case 1 because the horizontal injector provides an option to mitigate oil
recovery risks due to the uncertainty
related to the location of the fault and
its throw. It can also provide a higher
injection rate compared to a vertical
injector.
We also found that the sweep is better in Case 2, which provides accelerated oil production compared with Case
1. In Fig. 8, the brighter color represents higher water saturation.
As a result of this analysis, we chose
Case 2 as the preferred development
option for the southern lobe of the PUT
River reservoir.

Implementation

References

Based on the TDRM results, BP
initially developed the reservoir with
one injection well and one production well, to be followed by a second
producer. The injection well was
completed in early 2006 and production commenced from a single well in
October 2006. Initial production was
2,000 bo/d.
Injection and production rates are
managed to maintain the reservoir pressure above the bubble-point pressure.
Designing an optimal development
plan for a minor reservoir is a complicated process. This is especially true
when the field has poor quality and
heterogeneous reservoir rock, such as
the PUT River sands of Alaska’s North
Slope.
A number of existing well penetrations provided attractive options for
recompletion but restrict the optimal
placement of wells. Designing a successful flood process for a complex
case like the PUT River can benefit
from a TDRM process that can deter-

supply-demand conditions again in
2007, a trend that started in late 2004.
Fig. 2 shows that worldwide operating
rates were nearly 92%, a slight increase
from 2006. Operating rates were high
in 2004 when incremental demand
surpassed capacity increases.
According to Mark Eramo, executive
vice-president for CMAI, Houston, “the
regional markets are experiencing some
moderation in the supply-demand
balance as the US economy beings to
slow. By the end of 2008, the industry
will begin to feel the impact of the next
wave of Middle East new steam cracker
start-ups.”
Fig. 3 shows surplus ethylene capacity. Eramo told OGJ, “by 2009-10, the
acceleration in capacity additions compared to the forecast for annual demand
growth will prove to be too much in a
short period of time and surplus capacity is expected to rise once again.”
CMAI predicts that surplus capacity will peak at nearly 11 million tpy,
or 8% of total demand. This level of
surplus capacity could sustain through
2012; therefore, the next market downturn could be prolonged.
Fig. 4 shows that Middle East producers will dominate the net equivalent
ethylene trade (net trade flows of ethylene derivatives).
“The Middle East low-cost position
will ensure that their product will be
supplied to those areas that offer the
most profitable net backs; this will be
Asia, Europe, India, South America, and
North America in that order,” Eramo
said. “This period will prove to be a
significant challenge as the Middle East
producers are sure to take market share,
leaving a very competitive environment
for the other producers.”
CMAI forecasts that Middle East
ethylene capacity will increase to more
than 30 million tpy by 2012 (Fig. 5).
By 2010, Middle East capacity will
surpass that of Western Europe, and by
2012, it will nearly match capacity in
North America. ✦

Practical solutions to slow global warming
Whilst the world discusses the climate change and its consequences,
Linde has been developing concepts to significantly reduce energy
consumption and greenhouse gas emission in existing ethylene plants.
One of Linde’s innovative solutions is to replace the furnace section of a
cracker during a turnaround and thus install state-of-the-art technology in
an existing plant without any production loss.
This new Linde furnace technology reduces greenhouse gas emissions
while increasing yields and substantially improving reliability and economic efficiency.
Other innovative concepts customized to individual plant requirements are
available from Linde, the leading ethylene technology contractor.

A unique coiled-tubing method can serve as
a model for several offshore pipeline repairs the
US Mines and Minerals
Pipelines
Service has mandated occur by 2010. The method
successfully deoiled a total of 4,190 ft
of a buried pipeline length of 7,500 ft
and isolated the balance between two
plugs, in compliance with MMS
requirements.
This article reviews the pipeline
damage to which
this CT method
was first applied
and discusses the various options
considered to ensure the line’s safety
and prevent future leakage and environmental damage. It then describes in
detail the preparation for and successful
performance of the CT deployment.

Mississippi River. Crude oil production
runs 39,000 ft through an 8-in. pipeline to a 12-in. tie-in at WD 125. In July
2005, tropical storm Cindy separated
the pressure-balance safety joint on
the 8-in. crude riser. Surveys followed
passage of the storm and in accordance
with approved MMS procedures, several
steps were taken to assess damage.
A lock out at the platform and blind
flange installed at the base of the riser
deoiled and isolated it. Divers found
the separated end of the pipeline 300
ft to the southwest. Reconnecting the
riser required a total of 300 bbl sea
water pumped into the line behind a
soluble ball and a soft foam pipeline
pig, displacing oil from a 5,000-ft section of line. Before displacement of the
line was completed, however, Hurricane
Katrina entered the Gulf of Mexico,
forcing suspension of operations.
Sidescan sonar and magnetometer
equipment surveyed the pipeline after
Katrina and a dive-support vessel with
excavation equipment and divers mobilized to search for it. Both the survey
results and physical inspection by divers
showed the pipeline had undergone

New gas detection tool
Here’s the UltraRAE
3000, a new photoionization detector for
compound-specific gas
monitoring.
It makes use of proprietary prefilter tubes
to measure specific gases
such as benzene and butadiene. The unit is wirelessly enabled, making
it compatible with the
industry-standard AreaRAE
network for remote data
measurement and collection. The 3000 uses the
same detection technology
as the ppbRAE 3000, with
the ability to measure toxic compounds below 50
ppb. The 3000 is intended
for use in confined space
entry, prescreening during

refinery and plant maintenance, hazardous
material response, marine spill response,
and refinery downstream monitoring.
The instrument can be used for 60-sec
snapshot assessments as well as longer
short-term exposure limit surveys.
It also measures total volatile organic compounds in two ranges: 0-1,000
ppm with a resolution of 0.05 ppm or
1,000-10,000 ppm with a resolution of
1 ppm. The monitor also has integrated
correction factors for more than 200
compounds.

Sulfur crunch
could limit
bitumen output
Production of bitumen and heavy oil
in Alberta faces a constraint unrelated to
problems receiving the most attention.
The usual worries are water and energy
supplies, rising royalty rates, and air-emission regulations.
But specialists at the Oil Sands and
Heavy Oil Conference in Calgary July 15-17
said a bigger problem might be sulfur.
A strong global market that now prices

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s

sulfur at a robust $800/tonne will cycle into
“extreme oversupply,” according to Bill
Kennedy, retired from Shell Canada Ltd.
“It’s only a matter of when,” he said.
His reasoning: After a period of strong
growth, demand for sulfur is leveling. But
supply is zooming from bitumen upgraders
in northern Alberta, reﬁneries responding to gasoline and diesel desulfurization
regulations in the US and Europe, and large
sour-gas projects in China, Kazakhstan, and
the Middle East.
Kennedy said he expects sulfur supply
to double in the next 5-10 years, creating
“a market meltdown and transportation
gridlock.”
In a sulfur-market collapse, said Kennedy, Alberta—along with other high-cost
producers like Russia and Kazakhstan—will
be unable to sell the byproduct.
Storing sulfur will be necessary. But
acquiring permits to build sulfur-storage
facilities, called blocks, is time-consuming
and likely to remain so in Alberta. Other options, such as hydrogen-sulﬁde injection or
burial, are limited or lack approval.
In Alberta, noted Doug Houston of
Kinder Morgan Devco USA, most sulfur
storage facilities are in central and southern
regions. Transportation connections to them
from upgraders in the north are poor.
Producers and processors unable to
dispose of or store sulfur will have to curtail
operations.
Kennedy said the inability to handle
byproduct sulfur could shut down not just
upgraders in Alberta but also gas processing plants in the province and reﬁneries in
the US with limited sulfur storage.
Response to the possible sulfur crunch
by oil and gas companies has been limited,
Kennedy said.
Gerard d’Aquin of Con-Sul Inc. urged
companies to develop new storage strategies and new markets for sulfur, now used
mostly in fertilizer and chemicals.
“The funding is there to do something,”
he said. “You’ve got to think about it now.
You’ve got to be market-makers.”

Dollar values and oil prices
For months now, members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
and many western analysts have blamed the weak US dollar as a primary cause of
the escalation of oil prices. “It’s not because of a lack of crude on the market,” they
claim, although demand growth has been rampant in India and China.
As oil prices recently peaked at record highs, the US dollar fell to record lows
against other key currencies as the Federal Reserve Bank lowered interest rates to
stave off inﬂation and cushion the US credit crunch. In the process it has lowered
the cost of oil to many foreign buyers and has encouraged investments in crude as a
hedge.
In its largest 3-day price fall ever, the front-month crude contract lost $15.89 over
July 15-17 to close at $129.29/bbl on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The dollar
rallied July 17 from earlier losses, but then turned slightly weaker against the euro.
That same day, the Centre for Global Energy Studies (CGES), London, reported,
“The falling value of the US dollar may have had a marginal impact on the price of
oil, but it is clearly not the prime driving factor, and OPEC’s assertion that prices are
reacting to the euro-dollar exchange rate is really just another way of saying that it is
all down to speculation, while ignoring their own role in the process.”
Certainly, there is a high degree of correlation between the price of oil in US
dollars and the exchange rate between the dollar and euro. On a monthly average
basis from January 2002 through mid-July 2008, “the correlation coefﬁcient between
the two is around 0.8,” CGES reported. “If we concentrate only on the period since
January 2007, this rises to 0.95—very high indeed—and strong evidence, surely, that
OPEC has got it right.” However, the analysts asked, “Is this evidence really compelling enough?”
Between January 2002 and the ﬁrst half of July 2008, the value of the US dollar
fell from 1.132 euro to 0.634 euro, a lost of nearly 45% of its value. “Over the same
period, dollar-denominated oil prices have risen from $18.42/bbl to $137.57/bbl for
OPEC’s reference basket of crudes, an increase of almost 650%. The rise in the oil
price over this period has far surpassed the fall in the value of the dollar,” said CGES
analysts.
Moreover, they said, “Neither the run-up in oil prices between May 2004 and
September 2006, nor the surge since January 2007, was accompanied by any appreciable increase in the rate of the dollar’s slide in value against the euro.” Focusing
on the most recent period of soaring oil prices since the start of 2007, CGES analysts
said, “The argument weakens even further. Over this shorter period, the value of the
dollar has fallen by around 20% against the euro, while dollar-denominated oil prices
have increased by more than 170%.”
Comparative correlations
The correlation of comparative monthly changes in both the dollar’s value and
the price of oil “is not good,” CGES ofﬁcials said. In fact, over the period of January
2002-July 2008, they said, “There is no correlation at all, while for the period since
January 2007 the correlation is considerably weaker than that between the absolute
values, with a coefﬁcient of around 0.57.”
Then there is the matter of timing. Analysts said, “The biggest month-on-month
jump in oil prices so far this year occurred in April, when the price of the OPEC
basket leapt by 14%. In that same month the value of the US dollar rose against
the euro, suggesting that there were other factors at play in driving the oil price
upwards. Actually, since March of this year the dollar has been remarkably stable
against the euro on a monthly-average basis, yet oil prices have risen by almost
40%.”
If oil prices really are being driven upwards by the falling value of the dollar
against the euro, analysts said, “Then we would expect the euro-denominated price
of oil to be much more stable than the dollar-denominated price. To a degree this is
indeed the case.” From January 2002 through mid-July 2008, the dollar-denominated
price of the OPEC reference basket of crudes increased 650%, while the euro-denominated price rose 320%. “The euro-denominated oil price may not have been rising
as dramatically as the dollar-denominated price, but it was far from stable,” analysts
said. “Since the beginning of 2008, the dollar has lost 8% of its value against the
euro, while the dollar-denominated oil price has risen by 58% and the euro-denominated price is up by 46%.”

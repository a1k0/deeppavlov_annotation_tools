COVER
The bus used for farm tours by the Agricultural Research Service
(ARS), the research arm of the US Department of Agriculture, is
powered by a soybean-based biodiesel fuel. Like many other groups
and companies, ARS is involved in fuel research with government encouragement.With increased political pressure for cleaner
transportation fuels and world demand for energy on the rise, there
is a robust market for a growing variety of petroleum-based and
alternative supplies. In this issue, articles beginning on pp. 18
and 44 examine the transportation markets for propane, biofuel,
ultralow-sulfur diesel and gasoline, CNG, LNG, and propane.

___________________________________
Offshore West Africa is forecasted to lead the world in annual spending for operations at $13
billion per year by 2010, according to energy analysts Douglas-Westwood. At the same time,
the offshore industry is experiencing growth constraints because of the increasing demand for
equipment and people. The experienced personnel needed to design, build, and operate drilling
and production equipment are difficult to find and command a growing premium. These offshore
market forces are directing the industry toward new cost-cutting technology and other commercial
innovations to overcome resource constraints.
The Offshore West Africa (OWA) Conference & Exhibition remains the leading source of
information on new technology and operating expertise for this growing deepwater and
subsea market. This year OWA will be held on 20 – 22 March 2007 and changes venue to the
spacious International Conference Centre in Abuja, Nigeria. Over 1,500 attendees and 100 exhibitors from the energy centers of Nigeria, Angola, Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, United Kingdom,
UAE, United States, France, Italy, Norway, The Netherlands, Niger, Russia, Australia, and Asia.

Firms win MMS royalty in-kind oil contracts

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Japan objects to Russia’s new pipe import tax

More than 12.7 million bbl of crude oil and condensate from
federal leases in the Gulf of Mexico was sold to six companies as
part of a royalty in-kind (RIK) sale, the US Minerals Management
Service said.
Chevron Products Co., ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil Corp.,
Plains Marketing, Sempra Energy, and Shell Trading Co. submitted
winning bids. Most of the contracts were for 6 months, with one
contract awarded for 12 months.
“A record number of 14 companies submitted aggressive bids
on the 34 packages offered,” compared with nine bids in an unrestricted RIK sale concluded in August, MMS Director Johnnie Burton said. “These RIK sales continue to generate very high interest,”
she added.
The contracts awarded 12,710,700 bbl of crude, or 53,615
b/d, and provide for delivery to begin Jan. 1, 2007.
In mid-October, MMS sold 114.8 bcf of Gulf of Mexico gas to
10 companies in the first RIK transaction that included production
from off Alabama as well as Louisiana and Texas. It said 15 companies tendered a record 115 offers for the RIK gas.

Japan has objected to a decision by Russia to impose an 8%
import duty on Japanese-made steel pipe. Nippon Steel, JFE, and
Sumitomo Metal Industries are the manufacturers primarily affected.
“Japan expresses deep regret for Russia’s decision to take such a
protective measure,” said Japanese Economics, Trade, and Industry
Minister Akira Amari in a statement released Nov. 25.
He said Japan might call on Russian authorities to cancel the
3-year tax measure to be imposed starting Dec. 18, reportedly to
protect Russia’s industry from the rapidly increasing growth of imported pipe from Japan.
Russia’s import of Japan-made pipes increased to 270,000
tonnes in 2004 from 3,000 tonnes in 2002, mainly due to the
implementation of large-scale oil and gas development projects on
Sakhalin Island, where the last batch of pipe for the Sakhalin-2
pipeline was delivered Oct. 1.
The Russian tax coincides with efforts of pipe mills in both
countries to increase output to match international demand, especially for natural gas pipelines.
In mid-November, Alexander Deineko, head of the Russian Pipe

Gazprom marketing directly to French consumers ply, within the next 2-3 years, 2 billion cu m of gas directly to conRussia’s gas giant Gazprom officially launched Gazprom Marketing & Trading France Nov. 24 in Paris to further develop a total
upstream-to-downstream natural gas export strategy. Describing
France as “a strategic market,” it intends to sell gas directly to consumers rather than through wholesalers.
GM&T France, which started operations in October through UK
subsidiary Gazprom Marketing & Trading Ltd., is targeting medium
and large industrial and commercial customers.
Gazprom Vice-Pres. Alexander Medvedev said the aim is to sup-

Development

ExxonMobil advances Piceance tight gas work
ExxonMobil Gas & Power Marketing Co. has signed a 30-year
agreement with Enterprise Products Partners LLC for gathering,
compression, treating, and conditioning services for natural gas it
is developing in tight sands of the Piceance basin of Colorado.
ExxonMobil began a development program last year of about
270,000 gross acres it holds under lease in the area. Company officials have estimated recovery potential at more than 35 tcf and
predicted the area will produce gas for more than 50 years.
At a presentation for analysts early in November, ExxonMobil
Senior Vice-Pres. Stuart McGill said an initial development project
on the leasehold is producing about 50 MMcfd. A first production
phase of 150-200 MMcfd is in the “definition stage,” he said. Later
stages are planned.
“There is the potential for gross production to reach some 1
bcfd at its peak,” McGill said.
ExxonMobil is using proprietary “multizone stimulation technology” and drilling multiple deviated wells from individual locations.
“We now routinely fracture 40-50 sands/well and recently
completed 64 of these fractures in a single wellbore,” McGill told
the analysts.
Under the new, fee-based agreement, ExxonMobil dedicates to
Enterprise production from 29,000 acres in Rio Blanco County.
Enterprise has the option to recover NGL beyond liquids recovery
required to make the gas meet pipeline specifications.
Enterprise expects to invest $185 million on new plant and
pipeline facilities related to the agreement and to complete construction late in 2008. It will extract liquids at a gas processing
plant it is building at the Meeker hub. The plant will have initial
capacities of 750 MMcfd of inlet gas and 35,000 b/d of liquids
extraction. A planned later phase will boost capacities to 1.3 bcfd
of gas and 70,000 b/d of liquids.

Turkmenistan claims supergiant gas ﬁnd
The reported discovery of a supergiant gas field near the town
of Iolotan in the Amu Daria basin of Turkmenistan would, if confirmed, help justify construction of a gas pipeline to China.
The field is said to contain 23 tcf of gas at 16,400 ft, but it was
not clear whether this is the recoverable volume or the amount
of gas in place. Turkmenistan, which already pipes gas to several
countries and intends to serve several more, invited China National
Petroleum Corp. to develop the field, press reports said.

sumers in France and to have as many as 1,000 customers within
5 years.
GM&T France wants easier access to transport networks and infrastructure to deliver its gas “to the consumer’s door,” and Medvedev said Gazprom would acquire local companies and set up joint
ventures for this purpose.
GM&T France has begun extending activities to electricity and
is planning to become involved in CO2 emissions trading, oil products, and chemicals, said Medvedev. ✦

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Iolotan is east-northeast of supergiant Dauletabad-Donmez gas
field, discovered in 1976 with estimated ultimate recovery of 49 tcf
from a reservoir at about 9,800 ft (OGJ, June 3, 1991, p. 104).

Endeavour makes gas strike in UK North Sea
Endeavour International Corp., Houston, said its Columbus well
in the UK North Sea encountered a gross gas column of at least 125
ft in the Palaeocene Forties formation.
Testing operations are under way on Block 23/16f with results
expected by midmonth. It is anticipated that additional appraisal
drilling will be required.
Endeavour is operator of the drilling and testing operations and
holds a 25% working interest in the license, which is operated by
Serica Energy PLC.

Statoil lets contract for Trestakk studies
Norway’s Statoil ASA has let a contract to a unit of John Wood
Group PLC to perform feasibility and conceptual studies for facilities modifications associated with the Trestakk subsea field development expected to be tied into the Aasgard platform in the
Norwegian Sea.
The £2 million contract commits Wood Group Engineering
(North Sea) to evaluate options for the topsides modifications on
the Aasgard A and Kristin floating production facilities and to verify
the alternatives required for concept selection. Wood Group aims
to prepare the selected concept to the required level for full project
sanction.
The project involves a number of challenges in high-pressure,
high-temperature systems, Statoil said.

Eni Goliat appraisal encounters deeper oil
Eni Norge AS has found deeper oil pay during appraisal drilling
of its Goliat oil discovery on Production License 229 in the Barents
Sea off Norway.
Its 7122/7-4 S on the South Goliat structure encountered an
oil column in Early Triassic Klappmys sandstone. The well also confirmed a deeper oil-water contact in the Late Triassic Realgrunnen
subgroup and proved a gas-oil contact in Middle Triassic Kobbe.
The Transocean Polar Pioneer semisubmersible drilled the well
to a TD of 2,366 m subsea in 372 m of water. The license is 50
km southeast of Snohvit field and 85 km northwest of Hammerfest
(OGJ, Nov. 13, 2006, p. 31).
Eni owns 65% interest in and operates PL 229.

Firm shoots seismic survey off Seychelles
PetroQuest International has acquired 2,500 line-km of seismic
data off Seychelles in the East Africa island nation’s first seismic
work in 14 years.
“It is being processed at the moment, and the government is
keen to build on its oil and gas business,” said Chris MatchetteDownes, vice-president of business development at Black Marlin
Energy Ltd., which is conducting geophysical work for PetroQuest.
PetroQuest’s 20,000-sq-km block is in the southern portion of
the Seychelles plateau (see map, OGJ, July 6, 1998, p. 85). The reservoir is believed to be coarse-grain Karoo sandstones with porosities of up to 23% at 8,000 ft for the reservoir horizon.
“Over 15 large structures were mapped by Texaco and Amoco
in the past,” Matchette-Downes said. “New seismic has verified the
presence of large leads.” Oil shows and locally derived tars have
been classified as having come from Paleozoic and Lower Mesozoic
regional sources.

Sinopec to develop Iran’s Yadavaran oil ﬁeld
Iran has invited China Petrochemical Corp. (Sinopec) to finalize
an agreement initiated in 2004 for development of Iran’s Yadavaran
oil field (OGJ, Apr. 18, 2005, Newsletter).
The Petroenergy Information Network, operated by Iran’s oil
ministry, said Sinopec would also secure oil and natural gas supplies.
Under the 2004 informal agreement, Sinopec would pay Iran
up to $100 billion over 25 years for oil and gas purchases and for
a 51% stake in Yadavaran field.
China would be able to buy 250 million tonnes of LNG and
150,000 b/d of Iranian crude oil at market rates over that period.
“All elements of the contract have been finalized, and it is in the
final process for signing by Sinopec,” said National Iranian Oil Pres.
Gholamhossein Nozari. ✦

Production

ConocoPhillips starts up Alpine satellite
ConocoPhillips has brought on line a second Alpine satellite oil
field, called Nanuq, on Alaska’s North Slope.
Nanuq, 3 miles south of Alpine, is expected to reach peak production of 15,000 b/d of oil in 2008.
Production from Nanuq, as well as from Fiord—the first Alpine
satellite—will be processed through the existing Alpine facilities.
Together, the two fields are expected to have peak production of
35,000 bo/d in 2008 (OGJ, Aug. 21, 2006, Newsletter).
Nanuq field was developed exclusively with horizontal wells.
It will have gas and water injection. The Nanuq development plan
involves 19 wells.
ConocoPhillips used 50 miles of temporary ice roads to move
construction equipment, facilities, drilling rigs, and drilling supplies to the site, which is 35 miles west of Kuparuk field on the
border of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.
Alpine, Nanuq, and Fiord oil field interests are ConocoPhillips
Alaska Inc. 78% and Anadarko Petroleum Corp. 22%.
ConocoPhillips is pursuing state, local, and federal permits for
additional Alpine satellite developments, including the recently announced Qannik discovery, which flowed an average 1,200 b/d of
30° gravity oil from a 25-ft thick sandstone overlying the Alpine
reservoir at 4,000 ft (OGJ, July 24, 2006, Newsletter).

Gorgon geosequestration gets government grant
Chevron Australia’s Gorgon gas project is still alive following
an Australian government grant of $60 million (Aus.) towards the
company’s proposed carbon capture storage project on Barrow Island.
The $850 million (Aus.) carbon dioxide geosequestration proj-

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

ect is expected to be the largest of its kind in the world.
The plan is to inject 125 million tonnes of excess CO2 produced
during the life of the Gorgon LNG project planned for Barrow Island off Western Australia.
The offshore Gorgon gas field has about 12% CO2 content, a
figure that prompted the geosequestration project.
Environment Minister Ian Campbell says the underground storage of Gorgon CO2 has the potential to reduce Australia’s greenhouse emissions by as much as 3 million tonnes/year.
The government’s funding will provide for a commercial-scale
demonstration project that liquefies the CO2 stream and injects it
into reservoirs 2.5 km under the island.
The project includes long-term monitoring to ensure the integrity of the storage. The funding, however, is conditional on the
Gorgon Gas project meeting environmental approvals.

Co-op programs to drill nine N. Sea wells
Six independent oil companies plan to drill nine wells next year
in the central and northern UK North Sea with two semisubmersible rigs under two cooperative programs managed by AGR Peak
Well Management Ltd., London.
The companies involved are Antrim Resources (NI) Ltd., three
wells; Nautical Petroleum PLC, two wells; and Bow Valley, Vermillion Rep SAS, Ithaca Energy (UK) Ltd., and Xcite Energy Resources
Ltd., one well each.
One of the programs will begin next April and the other, next
May. The semis will come from Transocean Offshore (North Sea)
Ltd. and Dolphin Drilling Ltd. AGR Peak Well Management will
provide full well project management, including rig and support
services. ✦

This project, which will enable the refinery to increase production of high-purity diesel oil in compliance with the European
Norm, also includes a wild naphtha-stripping unit and a gas amine
treating-regeneration unit.
The HDS unit, which will be based on the Albemarle ultradeep
HDS process, will produce 260 tons/hr of high-purity diesel oil,
with a maximum of 10 ppm (wt) of sulfur. It will be one of the
largest of its kind, Technip said.
Construction of the unit is scheduled for completion in June
2009.
The contract covers license, basic and detail engineering, procurement and supply of equipment and materials, supervision of
construction, precommissioning and commissioning, start-up, and
test runs.

Contract let for fourth Khalda gas plant train
Khalda Petroleum Co. (KPC) has hired Petrofac of London to
design and construct a fourth gas-conditioning train at Salam on
the Khalda Concession in the western desert of Egypt, said Apache
Corp.
KPC is a joint venture of Apache and Egyptian General Petroleum Corp.
The fourth train, combined with a recently approved third
train, will increase total conditioning capacity for production from
Apache’s Jurassic gas reserves to 710 MMcfd of gas and 66,000
b/d of condensate (OGJ Online, Nov. 15, 2006).
Each train will have capacity to process 100 MMcfd of sales gas
and 14,000 b/d of sales condensate. The expansions are scheduled

for completion by late 2008.
This is the second train contract that KPC let to Petrofac during
November, and it increases the value of the total Khalda contracts
to $375 million from $200 million.

Lurgi’s technology selected for plants in China
Datang International Power Generation Co. Ltd. and Shenhua
Ningxia Coal Industry Group have awarded Lurgi AG two contracts
for the first two commercial-scale propylene plants based on Lurgi
technology for the production of plastics from coal. The plants,
expected to be the largest in the world according to Lurgi, will be
built in China.
Total capital investment for both projects amounts to more than
€2 billion.
Lurgi’s contracts, valued at more than €100 million, cover the
technology license, engineering services, and supply of special
equipment. Certain proprietary equipment and major machinery
are to be supplied from Europe, but most materials will be purchased in China.
The plants, due on stream in late 2008 and early 2009, will produce about 500,000 tons/year of polypropylene from coal. They
will incorporate Lurgi’s technologies for raw gas conditioning,
methanol synthesis (5,000 tons/day of methanol with the Lurgi
MegaMethanol process), and Methanol-to-Propylene (MTP).
The Lurgi MegaMethanol technology will provide feedstock for
the company’s MTP process. MTP complexes constitute the first
step to diversification into the field of coal-to-chemicals and fuels
in China, Lurgi said. ✦

Tr a n s p o r t a t i o n
Japanese ﬁrms to form LPG operations alliance
Mitsui & Co., Sumitomo Corp., and Marubeni Corp., all of Japan, are reported to be negotiating to form an alliance by yearend
for the joint procurement of liquid petroleum gas (LPG), operation
of tankers to carry it, and eventual consolidation of their respective
distribution and storage facilities.
The companies apparently view their proposed alliance as a
way of strengthening their operations, as competition is increasing among Japan’s 20 or so LPG wholesalers due to shrinkage of
the wholesale market and a doubling of the cost of supplies from
Middle East producers.
Marubeni operates its LPG business indirectly through Marubeni Liquefied Gas Inc, while Mitsui imports and sells LPG through
Mitsui Liquefied Gas Co. Sumitomo imports LPG directly and sells
it through Sumisho LPG Holdings Co.

Shanghai LNG building LNG terminal in China
Shanghai LNG Co Ltd. is building an LNG terminal at Zhong
Ximentang Island in China’s Zhejiang province, with plans for the
facility to become operational in the first half of 2009.
The complex, which includes docking facilities, a regasification
plant, and an undersea pipeline, will have an initial capacity of

about 3 million tonnes/year—enough to process newly contracted
supplies.
In October, Petronas subsidiary Malaysia LNG signed deals with
Shanghai LNG Co. Ltd. to supply up to 3.03 million tonnes/year of
LNG for 25 years (OGJ Online, Oct. 30, 2006).
Shanghai LNG Co Ltd. is a joint venture of the Shenergy Group
Ltd., 55% and CNOOC Gas & Power, 45%, a wholly owned unit of
China National Offshore Oil Corp.

Indonesia to choose LNG partner by yearend
Indonesia’s state-owned oil and natural gas company PT Pertamina and its partner the Medco Group are still in the process
of selecting a Japanese partner for a 2 million tonnes/year liquefaction plant they plan to build in Senoro, Sulawesi, starting
in 2007.
A spokesman said the two firms have yet to decide whether
Mitsui Corp. or Mitsubishi Corp., both of Japan, will become the
working partner for constructing the LNG facility.
“We have already been late too long, therefore, a decision has to
be made by the end of this year,” said Pertamina executive Tri Siwindono, who said LNG produced at the plant would be exported
to Japan.
The plant will liquefy gas from Pertamina’s wholly owned Matindock block and from the Senoro block owned equally by Pertamina and the Medco Group. ✦

The “green diesel” produced entails
lower capital costs than a biodiesel plant
and has excellent fuel properties. The
unit diesel yield is nearly 90% of the
feed, the cetane number is 80-100, and
the sulfur content is less than 10 ppm.
“The quality of the diesel is just
phenomenal,” Pacheco said. “This is a
fascinating technology that represents a
better fit with the asset base that [refiners] have.”

Algae
NREL is working on algae technologies for creating nonedible lipids. Algae
can store carbon in two ways: as a lipid
or as a carbohydrate.
“What we are working on is engineering algae strains that produce a
very high yield, up to 60%, of their
weight as lipids,” Pacheco said. “Lipids
are a very highly energy-dense material, the same as diesel fuel particularly
when we crack it.
“The other reason we are looking at
algae is because it integrates very well
with carbon capture. When you take
an enriched carbon dioxide stream,
whether it’s a flue gas or a concentrated stream for sequestration, you can
bubble that CO2 through the solution
that you are growing the algae in...you
dissolve that CO2 in the growth media
and can kick up the growth rate of the
algae by about a factor of 50.”
For soybeans, the fuel yield is about
300 gal/acre; for corn the yield is 800900 gal/acre. For algae, 1 acre can yield
10,000-20,000 gal of fuel, according to
Pacheco.
“With the research we are doing,
we’ve estimated that about 25 million
acres would produce all the oil that the
US uses,” Pacheco said. “This is a gamechanging technology if we can make it
work.” ✦

Deepwater controversies
A casualty of US political fights this year might
prove to be a concept central to the most successful energy law since oil and gas price decontrol. The Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995
(DWRRA) created an industry in the Gulf of
Mexico. Its success far exceeds the hopes that inspired 3 years of struggle to win enactment. It has
created wealth, incomes, and government revenue
where otherwise there would be none. Yet the
core mechanism—a delay in royalty collection to
encourage risky investment—is in jeopardy.
Success of the DWRRA is beyond question.
According to the Minerals Management Service,
deepwater Outer Continental Shelf leases from
sales held in the 5 years following enactment in
November 1995 generated bonus-bid revenue
exceeding $2 billion. Deepwater leasing had
proceeded slowly during 1992-95 but “exploded”
after DWRRA took effect, MMS says in a May
report. As of last Dec. 31, there were more active
gulf leases with water depths exceeding 1,000 ft
than there were leases in shallower water: 4,395
vs. 3,826. Since 1995, the MMS report says, operators have drilled 980 wildcats in deep water and
announced more than 126 discoveries.

Production beginning
Because of the DWRRA, deepwater production
has begun where exploration might only now be
starting if former Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.)
hadn’t consulted industry officials in July 1992
about ways to revive gulf operations. Because of
the DWRRA, which grew out of a royalty holiday idea suggested to Johnston by former Marathon Oil Co. Pres. Victor Beghini, gulf ports and
shipyards have business that might only now be
reviving in response to elevated prices for oil and
gas—or maybe not. Because of the DWRRA, the
government has revenue, Americans have energy, and industry has technology that otherwise
wouldn’t exist.
Last January, however, an attentive New York
Times reporter noticed in budget documents that
the Department of the Interior projected revenue
from deepwater leases awarded in 1998 and 1999
sharply lower than that from deepwater leases of
different vintage. The reason: Leases from those
years contain no oil and gas price thresholds above

which royalty becomes due. Disclosure of the
apparent omission came in an election year while
oil and gas prices were high and producers were
reporting record profits. “This irresponsibility will
cost the taxpayers almost $10 billion,” declared
Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) as he opened hearings on the issue last June in the Committee on
Government Reform Subcommittee on Energy and
Resources, which he chairs.
Oil and gas companies should not let the supposedly lost royalties obscure benefits that the
DWRRA has delivered and will keep delivering for
decades. Even without price thresholds, royalty
relief has limits-based production volumes, which
vary with water depth. Beyond those volumes,
production will be subject to royalty.
Furthermore, someone at the Department of
the Interior might deliberately have withheld price
thresholds for fear the agency lacked authority to
impose them. The part of the law that describes
price thresholds refers to sections dealing with
deepwater leases other than those issued in 19962000, when eligibility for relief was automatic.
Because a major concern during development of
the DWRRA was budget neutrality, drafters limited
automatic eligibility to 5 years, knowing that
production would start later, outside the statutory
period of budget analysis. But deepwater leases in
effect at the time of enactment raised a problem.
Without royalty relief, some of them would have
lost work to the new leases. So the DWRRA made
relief available on existing leases to operators who
applied to MMS and showed economic need. It
also applied price thresholds.

Threshold intent
As a Kerr-McGee Corp. representative argued in
Issa’s hearing, Congress might never have intended
for price thresholds to apply to leases automatically eligible for deepwater relief. MMS officials have
reason to worry that price thresholds in deepwater
leases issued in 3 of 5 of the automatic-eligibility
years are illegal.
The larger concern for the industry should be
that the price-threshold controversy not discredit
the DWRRA approach. The incentive worked, and
the country is profiting in several ways because it
did. ✦

With the petroleum industry under
political pressure to market cleaner fuels
and refineries operating near capacity rates in the face of rising demand,
markets for conventional and alternative
transportation fuels appear robust.
Gasoline and diesel command the
lion’s share of the transportation fuel
market, but alternatives are expanding.
“Ethanol and biodiesel technologies should allow for the
displacement of 5-10% of
current [gasoline and diesel] consumption,” said
analysts at Simmons & Co.
International in a recent
report. “Future technologies, such as cellulosic
ethanol, could allow displacement of
nearly 30%. Overall, we expect compelling growth from alternative fuels in the
coming years.”

grow rapidly. Global production of fuel
ethanol more than doubled between
2000 and 2005, and biodiesel expanded nearly four-fold, they said in a joint
report in late September.
A major stimulus for alternative
fuels is the increasing renewable fuel
standard (RFS) mandated by the Energy
Policy Act of 2005. It would increase
renewable motor fuel in the US to at
least 7.5 billion gal in 2012 from 4.5
billion gal in 2006. “With the Democrats gaining control of the House and
the Senate, an increase in the renewable
fuels standard or more subsidies is a
distinct possibility,” Dietert said.

Ethanol

Worldwide production of ethanol, the predominant alternative fuel,
exceeds 12 billion gal/year. In the US,
production last year totaled 4 billion
gal, about 2% of gasoline consumption
on a btu-equivalent basis.

supplies were under strain, would increase imports by 10,000-20,000 b/d
from 22,000 b/d currently. Industry
analysts said Brazil—the world’s largest
producer of ethanol—could increase
exports to the US by only 5,000-7,000
b/d. They thought China, the third
largest producer, would be most likely
to step up ethanol exports to the US if
protections eased.
The National Petrochemical & Refiners Association opposes government
mandates for ethanol, biodiesel, and
other renewables but not alternative
fuels competitively priced without
government subsidies. “We believe that
alternative fuels will be a growing component of the nation’s future energy
supplies as their economic viability
improves,” said Bob Slaughter, NPRA
president.
However, Dietert said, “It seems to

me that ethanol is going to have to
compete on a cost basis with refinery-produced gasoline in order to take
market share.”
Meanwhile, the price of corn—the
biggest US crop and one of the most
heavily subsidized—shot up 63% during Aug. 16-Nov. 17, raising production
costs of meat and poultry, sweeteners,
breakfast cereals, and other packaged
foods. Market analysts blamed increased
production of ethanol, the third largest
market for US corn behind livestock
feed and exports. Nearly 13% of the
2005 US corn crop went into ethanol
production. Ethanol producers’ demand
for corn is expected to grow from 1.2
billion bushels in 2003-04 to 3 billion
bushels in 2009-10.
Still, the International Energy Agency
(IEA) in Paris claims that, even without
subsidies and despite its lower energy

density, ethanol from corn is cost-competitive with US gasoline in the US
when oil is above $45/bbl—well below
oil’s price in mid-2006.
Ethanol makers say cost reductions
are possible with improvements in
manufacturing and scale economies,
asserting that a tripling of ethanol plant
size can cut unit cost by 40%. Many
ethanol plants now under construction
have production capacity of 100 million gal/year, up from a typical earlier
capacity of 40 million gal/year.
However, opponents of renewablefuel mandates question whether the
energy provided by biofuels exceeds
the energy required to make them. They
claim biofuels produced from lowyielding crops and processes fueled by
fossil energy potentially could generate
as much greenhouse gas emissions as
petroleum fuels do or more.

When ethanol is mixed in a stronger
85:15 blend with gasoline, it becomes
E85, the fuel for a new generation of
“flexible-fuel” vehicles being produced
with the help of tax incentives in 2007.
If the RFS is increased and federal and
state subsidies continue, Simmons
analysts said, “Corn-derived ethanol [in
the US market] could reach 16 billion
gal in 10 years (7% of the total gasoline pool on a btu-equivalent basis).”
However, they said, “For ethanol to
grow beyond that, cellulosic technology
needs to gain traction.”
The Worldwatch Institute disputes
claims that biofuels require more energy to make than they provide. “Thanks
to technological advances throughout
the production process, all of today’s
biofuels have a positive fossil energy
balance,” it said in its study report. “If
bioenergy is increasingly used for feedstock processing and refining as well,
the balance sheet tips further in biofuels’ favor.” However, it acknowledged,
“Producing half of US automotive fuel
from corn-based ethanol would require
80% of the country’s cropland. Thus,
large-scale reliance on ethanol fuel will
require new conversion technologies
and feedstock.”
The largest US producers of ethanol
are Archer Daniels Midland, VeraSun,
Hawkeye, Aventine, and Cargill. Together
they account for 36% of total US capacity. “Today’s corn-based ethanol industry leaders are best positioned to co-opt
the new technologies, having logistics
management experience and customer
relationships,” said Jacques Rousseau,
senior energy analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group Inc., Arlington, Va.

Cellulosic ethanol
Ethanol made from the nonfood
portions of plants expands the potential supply while reducing competition with food. A joint study by US
Departments of Agriculture and Energy
concluded the nation has enough biomass resources to satisfy a third of US
petroleum needs if cellulosic technologies and resources are employed.
The potential to produce low-cost
20

cellulosic ethanol from various alternative agricultural feedstocks and processes “is truly remarkable,” Rousseau said.
However, he sees “a number of technological, operational, and economic
issues to overcome before this industry
makes a successful transition from
research and development to genuine
large-scale, commercial operations.”
There are only a handful of cellulosic
ethanol pilot plants around the world
with capacities of 5 million gal/year or
less but no operating plants of a size to
suggest mainstream commercial viability. Moreover, the low sugar density of
cellulosic feedstock requires plants to be
located near large supplies of feedstock.
The high processing cost and inherent
risks of such projects make it difficult
to obtain financing, so many companies seek government grants and loan
guarantees. Therefore, Rousseau said,
“Commercial economics for cellulosic
ethanol production is likely still several
years away.”
Although cellulosic ethanol has the
best growth potential for the biofuel
market, its current production cost
of $2.25/gal ($3.38/gal of gasoline
equivalent) is uneconomic, Simmons
analysts said.

ber of potential feedstocks than other
fuels do, as well as the flexibility to be
shipped by pipeline, which cannot be
done with ethanol-gasoline blends.
Biodiesel can be blended with conventional diesel at any concentration.
Most diesel vehicles can run on blends
of up to 20%, and a few engine warrantees allow for 100% biodiesel. More
than 600 vehicle fleets now use biodiesel. The US Navy, the world’s biggest
diesel consumer, has begun processing
its used cooking oil into biodiesel.
Still, said Simmons analysts in their
September report, “The cost to produce biodiesel is $2.40/gal ($2.64 on
a diesel gal-equivalent basis), which is
substantially higher than conventional
diesel at [the then-current price of]
$1.80/gal.”
The Worldwatch report acknowledged, “Costs must continue to fall if
biodiesel is to be used widely.”

Ultralow-sulfur diesel

As of Oct. 15, the sulfur content
of 80% of highway diesel sold in the
US could not exceed 15 ppm, down
from 500 ppm previously. All but the

test” will come, he said, when “designate and track” (D&T) reporting begins,
with the first report due Feb. 28 to
designate the classifications of distillate
flowing through US pipelines and track
the progress of various batches.
“It will not be until this time that the
majority of the potential hiccups in the
regulatory scheme will be exposed,”
Dreiblatt said. “Things to watch out for

Ultralow-sulfur gasoline
At the start of 2006, specifications
for gasoline content changed from the
previous 500 ppm sulfur ceiling for

RFG outside of California to a required
30 ppm annual average and a cap of 80
ppm/gal for most gasoline, with some
delays for gasoline produced in the
Rocky Mountain area or produced by
small refiners.
Desulfurization will make regular
gasoline more like reformulated fuel,
proponents say. Early this year, US refiners were estimated to have spent $8 billion to reduce sulfur levels in gasoline.

Canada removes tax advantages for income trusts
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
The Canadian government’s decision to remove tax advantages from
companies doing business as income
trusts will mean the end of the oil and
gas trust structure in its current form,
said a report by Wood Mackenzie Ltd.,
Edinburgh.
22

Separately, Raymond James & Associates Inc. issued a research note in which
it compared Canada’s efforts to stem a
widespread conversion of companies
to trusts with what the US experienced
decades ago with the emergence of
master limited partnerships (MLPs).
Canada’s new tax structure for all
income trusts will reduce the value of

the oil and gas trusts, said WoodMac
Canada and Alaska energy analyst John
Dunn. Trusts account for 20% of western Canadian conventional production.
“We estimate that in the conventional western Canadian oil and gas sector,
the removal of the tax benefits could
result in a transfer of value from the
trusts to the government of $640 million (Can.) in 2011 alone, with up to

$2 billion in net present value lost over
the expected life of the trusts’ assets,”
Dunn said.
On Nov. 1, the Canadian government
announced its Tax Fairness Plan, which
includes a tax on distributions paid by
publicly traded income trusts.
Canada Finance Minster Jim Flaherty
said the plan was designed to “restore
balance and fairness to the federal tax
systems by creating a level playing field
between income trusts and corporations.”

WoodMac report
WoodMac’s Dunn believes “some of
the smaller, more-focused trusts may
struggle to adapt to the new regime,
especially if they are exposed to the
more marginal plays such as heavy oil
and tight gas, and could become targets
for acquisition.”
As for the larger trusts, which benefit
from a diverse portfolio, he expects
these companies might continue under
a new corporate structure or strategy.
“It is possible that their traditional
focus on western Canada may shift to
other regions, or even other countries,
where more attractive fiscal terms are
available,” Dunn said.
Oil and gas trusts have had to maintain production both through acquisitions and development to provide cash
flows to unitholders, Dunn said.
“However, recent cost escalation and
labor shortages have made the Canadian upstream operating environment
increasingly difficult, with projects becoming progressively marginal,” Dunn
said. “The new tax structure will only
add to these challenges.”

US comparison
In a Nov. 21 monthly review on
MLPs, RJA analyst Ted Gardner said
Canada’s Tax Fairness Plan includes a tax
on distributions paid by publicly traded
income trusts, including large telecommunications, financial, and energy
companies.
Some of these companies sought to
convert to the trust structure to avoid
paying taxes, Gardner said.

Wheat, chaff,

eparating wheat from chaff is
important in every business, the
oil industry included. Such a separation has become especially important
in Australia, where fallout from the
United Nation’s Oil-for-Food Program continues.

He compared this to what happened
in the US with the emergence and
eventual evolution of MLPs, which have
different legal structures, income distribution practices, and tax considerations
than a publicly traded corporation.
During the 1980s, US tax authorities
realized the trend toward companies
forming as MLPs instead of corporations potentially could create a tax
shortfall. Hence, the government narrowed the tax code definition of what
could qualify as an MLP. Today, many
pipeline and other midstream compa-

nies use the MLP model.
“As a result, the vast majority of
today’s MLPs are engaged in the energy
and natural resources business,” Gardner said. “The Canadian and US governments faced the same issue—a potentially dwindling tax base—but arrived
at different solutions,” he said, adding,
“Given the recent push for energy
independence and the growing need for
energy infrastructure in the US, we do
not expect the government to take it a
step further and impose a corporate tax
on MLPs in the near future.” ✦

Ecuador said it faced an “economic
emergency” because of the stoppage,
which sent world oil prices higher.
International oil companies agreed to
give Ecuador’s oil rich provinces 16% of
the 25% in income tax they paid to the
central government (OGJ Online, Aug.
30, 2006).
Oil sales account for about a quarter
of Ecuador’s GDP. According to the president of Ecuador’s Petroleum Industry
Association, oil revenues pay for both

amount of the national debt.

breaching its contract after it passed a
contested oil law that affects foreign
operators, said a company spokesman.
City Oriente, a Panama-based company run by US investors, has an output
of around 4,000 b/d of oil in Ecuador.
The company’s representative Jose
Paez said the company filed the claim at
World Bank arbitration center to force
Ecuador to not apply the law. “This
law is an unilateral modification of the
contract,” Paez said.
The law, approved by Congress last
April, forces foreign oil companies to
share with the state at least 50% of their
extra oil revenues, above a benchmark
price agreed in their original contracts.

Petrobras in Ecuador
Brazil’s Petróleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) is investing $160 million in the

Ecuadorian Amazonia during 2006, and
it is a sure bidder should Ecuador seek
bids for exploration of the IshpingoTambococha-Tiputini heavy oil area in
the Oriente basin field area (OGJ, Mar.
4, 1996, p. 47).
Prior to Correa’s election, Petrobras
had also announced planned investments of $500 million in Ecuador during 2005-11 through a strategic alliance
with Petroecuador. These investments
are almost equal to the total Petrobras
has invested in Ecuador since it entered
the country in 1988. The funds would
cover hydrocarbon exploration, refining, transport, and commercialization.
However, after Correa’s election,
Petrobras expressed doubts about future
investments and voiced concerns over
profits reduction in Ecuador, given its
experience in Bolivia, where President

Evo Morales’ government confiscated
Petrobras’s $2.5 billion operations.
Analysts said that Petrobras’ Bolivian
investment decision showed two things:
• The company does not fear an unstable political environment but thinks
it is better to stay away from the possibility of arbitrary, confiscatory decisions
such as those taken by Morales, who
nationalized Bolivian energy resources.
• It is willing to join forces with
companies such as Petroecuador in
precarious financial and managerial
conditions by bringing in world-class
managerial skills and processes and
state-of-the-art technologies.
However, with President Correa now
in power—He is known for his close
ties with Morales and Chavez—the
planned investments might be reviewed,

Acknowledging

I

t began when Steven G. Grape
and John Wood, his supervisor in
the US Energy Information Administration’s reserves and production
division in the Office of Oil and Gas
in Dallas, noticed two things. First
was the perception that no significant
new oil or gas deposits were being
found and developed in the Lower
48. Second were production numbers
suggesting the opposite.
“Many people are pessimistic
about oil and gas supplies in the
United States. They don’t understand the scope of unconventional
resources. So we thought we should
get information out that coalbed
methane, natural gas from shale, and
other resources are making significant contributions,” Grape told me
recently.
Wood instructed him to prepare a
special report highlighting one such
area. “We were both interested in the
Bakken formation because we’d started to read about it. Then we looked at
some of the production curves coming out of the Williston basin, and
they were striking,” Grape said.
The result was a Nov. 10 report,
“Shale Shock! Could There Be Billions
in the Bakken?” which examines the
formation’s location, production,
resources, geology, reserves, and
technology in use. It also is the first
of a series about technology-based
US oil and gas plays.

Formal reviews
Wood and Grape sent the Bakken report through formal review by
other divisions in EIA.
“That took more time, but it also
resulted in a better product,” said
Grape. His next two reports will ex-

amine the Barnett shale, west of Fort
Worth, and the Fayetteville shale in
Arkansas.
Grape emphasized that the reports
will not promote frontier areas or
exotic technologies. “We want to
highlight success stories. Most of
them actually are being produced.
People have already discovered the
plays and are trumpeting the success.
I’m just trying to spread the word,”
he said.
North Dakota Petroleum Council
Pres. Ron Ness liked the report. “The
work by Mr. Grape was fantastic,” he
said. “The Bakken’s potential is enormous. Marathon Oil Corp. announced
a major presence in the state and is
very active. Many other companies
are at work there. The completion
techniques and technology to tap
the resource still are in question. But
these studies and reports help.”

jected reversionary interest, based on a
$60/bbl oil price, Denbury said.
Initially, Denbury had expected to
transport CO2 from its natural source
at Jackson Dome, but ultimately plans
to use manufactured (anthropogenic)
sources of CO2 for this tertiary operation. It is initiating studies for construction of a 280-mile pipeline to transport
CO2 to Hastings from the southern
end of its existing CO2 pipeline which
terminates near Donaldsonville, La.
The pipeline, with a target for installation and operation within the next
few years, is expected to cost $225-250
million.
Preliminary estimates indicate that
it will cost $400-600 million (net) to
develop the West Hastings Unit as a
tertiary flood, excluding the cost of the
CO2 pipeline.
If the option is exercised, Denbury
will be committed to make aggregate
net capital expenditures of about $175
million over the subsequent 5-year
period to develop the field for tertiary
operations, and to begin CO2 injections
in the field within 3 years after exercising the option.
Meanwhile, Denbury has committed to buy all the CO2 produced as a
byproduct by a planned petroleum
coke gasification project in Louisiana,
scheduled to start up in 2010, and is
engaged in ongoing discussions with
other potential sources of manufactured
CO2. The plant, if completed, is expected to produce 190-225 MMcfd of CO2.
The purchase price of the CO2 will vary,
depending on oil price and the level of
compression provided by the seller.
Denbury plans to connect this
manufactured source of CO2 to its
natural source of CO2, which will allow
the company to allocate production as
required between the two sources.

Dana’s Cavendish share
Production from Cavendish field,
scheduled to begin in first quarter
2007, is expected to flow initially at
100 MMcfd and to continue until
2016. Dana said its pending transac-

tion remains subject to government and
third-party approvals.
Dana estimates that the additional
25% interest will add 29 bcf of North
Sea proven and probable gas reserves
and a production gain of 17 MMscfd.
After closing, Dana’s overall production from its total stake in Cavendish is
expected to be 34 MMscfd.
Cavendish field lies in 18.5 m of
water on Block 43/19a, about 140 km
northeast of Easington on the Lincolnshire coast and 180 km north of Bacton
on the Norfolk coast.
Development involves three production wells and a minimum facilities

P L O R A T I O N

Selecting appropriate field development plans, risk management, and
modifying project implementation
methods is essential to maintaining
the viability of deepwater oil and gas
projects.
The second part of this two-part
article lays out considerations for flow
control and assurance, processing and
support, transportation and storage,
schedules, abandonment, and other
aspects of complex projects.

Flow control and assurance
Flow assurance aspects represent
both revenue and cost risks.
Any upset in flow from the wells will
directly impact the volume of product
available for sale, and the cost of rectifying a flow problem in deep and cold
water will represent a formidable cost
risk.
Increasing the robustness of a system
to very high levels implies increased
equipment costs, which ultimately may
make the project uneconomic. Hence,
it is necessary to strike a satisfactory
balance between the capital investment
requirement and an acceptable level of
risk. Flow assurance is a critical issue
for concept evaluation, commissioning,
safety, security, start-up, and post startup phases especially in long distance
tieback field developments.
Innovative technology and flexible
well intervention contingency plans
and options should operational problems arise are the key to addressing
flow assurance issues and can influence
the cost risks. The implementation of
transient multiphase modeling will
normally provide guidelines to safe
operational strategy development and in
assessments of operational risks.
Most deepwater developments
include a host surface facility with
multiple subsea well tiebacks in order
to cover the full area extent of the
reservoir.
This host facility commonly only
accounts for substantially less than 25%
of the total project costs; however, if
it fails to perform or its operations are
adversely impacted (e.g., Thunder Horse

& DEVE

L O P M E N T

platform in the Gulf of Mexico) all the
expensive wells tied back to it also are
unable to perform.
Even if the host facility has dry trees
for the initial suite of production wells,
additional subsea tiebacks in later field
life are usually envisaged.
The host facility design must therefore make adequate provision for the
flow assurance and operability requirements of
subsea tiebacks,
both initial and
future, i.e., redundancy must
be built in. The
more redundancy that is
built in the more complex the facility,
and as complexity often translates into
high cost some critical tradeoff decisions must be made.
Flow impedance issues such as
formation, mitigation and control of
hydrates, wax, and asphaltenes, sands,
and scales must be assessed and modelled in detail. Particular issues which
industry’s experience has shown require
careful consideration7 8 include:
1. Arrival temperature management—provision for heating or cooling
of arriving fluids may be required, over
a range of operating conditions;
2. Liquids management—multiphase fluids from subsea tiebacks may
generate significant slugging, either
during steady state operation or during start-up and ramp-up following a
turndown. Liquids carryover may also
occur during flowline depressurization
(blowdown). Such occurrences must be
accommodated in the sizing of the host
facility slug catcher/separator.
3. Hydrates management—if
MEG injection subsea is proposed for
hydrates management, then the storage, injection, and regeneration system
and its associated utilities (particularly
power for heating or cooling) may be
a significant space and weight consideration for topsides design. If methanol
or glycol is proposed, again the storage
and injection systems need to be accommodated.

4. Wax management—if hot oil
circulation is selected to warm up the
subsea systems prior to start-up to avoid
wax deposition, then the circulation
system must be provided topsides. It is
important to size the system to accommodate possible additional tiebacks if
these are contemplated. If wax inhibitor
injection is proposed, again the storage and injection systems need to be
accommodated.
5. Chemicals injection—topsides
storage, injection and resupply logistics
must be considered. Chemicals injected
subsea may include scale inhibitor, wax
inhibitor, antiagglomerant, and corrosion inhibitor. This may impact integrity
issues such as design and management
of corrosion and erosion problems.
6. Deliverability issues such as
optimization of flowline sizes, artificial
lifting, topsides equipment and arrival
pressures, and viscosity management
for heavy oil system and emulsions.
7. Stability issues such as control
of system upsets and slugging during
normal and transient operations;
8. Safety and security issues—at the
flow assurance stage there is still sufficient flexibility to design inherent safety
and security features into a facility.
32

Hence, key technology needs to
provide a robust solution with acceptable risks to future production in the
above-mentioned items.

Processing and support
To stabilize produced well fluids, and
to separate marketable products from
them, they must be processed.
Facilities to carry out some processing are usually located offshore at or
close to the field but are sometimes
located fully or partially onshore and
linked to the wells by a long-distance
multiphase pipeline. Processing facilities
usually require:
• Deck and structures (fixed or floating) to support the deck.
• Manifolds to tie in producing wells
to processing vessels.
• Heat tracing/insulation capabilities
such as electrically heated flowlines.
• Separation, stabilization, and gas
and water treatment vessels.
• Testing and metering equipment.
• Compressors and pumps.
• Export systems with metering.
• Utility, power, and safety systems.
• Personnel accommodation facilities.
Processing facilities for deepwater

fields are commonly placed on floating structures. In some instances it is
possible to use tension-leg platforms
(TLPs), but large-scale barge-like FPSOs
are becoming more widely used for
the processing facilities of large remote
deepwater fields. Alternatives to this
include:
1. Placing substantial process functions downstream linked to shore-based
facilities by multiphase pipelines.
2. Placing some process functions
(e.g., water separation) upstream of the
offshore surface facilities (e.g., subsea
manifolds linked to downhole or subsea
processing equipment).
New subsea technology options may
offer less weight and reduced cost for
the surface facilities but usually increase
operating cost risk and revenue risk.
Such higher risks should be factored
into the project economic evaluations.
Some technology that is currently under
development to improve project economics and recovery includes:4
• Extra long (up to 150 km) composite umbilicals for controls, methanol
injection, and signals.
• Fiber optic technology for controls
of up to 300 km length.
• Advanced flow assurance techOil & Gas Journal / Dec. 4, 2006

niques to design for and mitigate
hydrate formation.
• Subsea multiphase pumping.
• Subsea gas/liquid separation and
liquid pumping.
• Subsea gas compression.
• Two or three phase subsea separation.
Designing facilities to be flexible to
facilitate the addition of extra capacity
or evolving technology improvements
can lead to substantial economic benefits on a life of field basis for acceptable additional costs.
Failing to design in flexibility for
future unforeseen expansion of facilities
may lead to prohibitive future costs and
an inability to exploit opportunities as
they materialize in the future.

Transportation and storage
Access to and reliability of third-party transportation and storage facilities
represent a potential revenue risk.
Recent technological advances in
floating LNG and floating storage and
regasification units enable gas storage
and transportation costs to be reduced
and can ease access to gas distribution
networks. Such developments offer the
potential to unlock many stranded offshore gas fields for development. LNG
regasification plants, now becoming
more widely distributed in the main
global gas markets, offer a ready market
for this gas.
Building large complex floating storage and offloading (FPSO) systems, designed specifically for a field’s reservoir
performance characteristics and capacities, is often the critical long-lead time
item in a deepwater field development.
Consequently, delays in completing the
construction of these vessels also pose a
significant revenue risk.

Schedules
Achieving early production from
a field development can significantly
enhance project economics.
However, if a project’s planned
schedule to achieve early production is too ambitious it often leads to
added costs being incurred to achieve

it. Robust project planning, teamwork,
cost control, and contracting strategy
are essential to achieving production on
schedule.
It is important to recognize that
serious accidents and incidents (safety
and/or climatic) can lead to persistent
project delays many months after such
events occur (e.g., Hurricane Katrina,
2005; Petronius accident in 1998 where
a $70 million platform deck sank in the
Gulf of Mexico).
Resources deployed to rectify impacts and investigate causes of incidents
can seriously impede project progress.
Building contingencies into project
schedules and budgets for unforeseen
eventualities can help to partially mitigate their impact on a project schedule.
Design-build time cycles are becoming more compact and schedule and
start-up delays in deepwater fields,
due to a variety of reasons, can have a
substantial negative impact on project
costs and ultimate project profitability,
often destroying value that cannot easily
be recovered.
Cash flow sensitivity analysis of
deepwater projects shows that they are
particularly vulnerable to cost and timing overruns because they are high-cost
projects to begin with and each day of
delay is so expensive.
For most onshore or shallow water
field developments cash flow sensitivity
analysis suggests that oil price and reservoir performance (production rate and
reserves) are the key factors determining
profitability. In the case of deepwater
projects costs and project schedule (time
to first production) can have comparable
impacts on profitability.
Consider a cash flow sensitivity
analysis for a deepwater field offshore
Nigeria (Fig. 5). The wider the horizontal bars, the greater the project’s economic sensitivity to that factor.
The capital expenditure bar is wider
than the others (typical of large deepwater and LNG development projects).
The production timing sensitivity case
in this example were delaying (which
extends bar to left) and accelerating
(which extends bar to right) produc-

tion by 1 year. Longer delays would
extend the production timing sensitivity bar to the right.
Some may say in the current oil and
gas price environments that what is lost
in delayed scheduling can be recouped
by high product prices. Obviously this
is a risky approach as there is no guaranty that prices will remain high over
project lives measured in decades. But
Fig. 3 (Part 1 of this article) shows that
this is actually not the case.
The bar for oil price sensitivity is
asymmetrical with more downside
than upside. This is due to the impact
of fiscal terms that ensure that the
government and national oil companies (NOCs) see most of the upside in
high price environments, whereas the
international oil companies (IOCs) see
all of the downside risk of cost and timing overruns. IOCs therefore have added
incentives to carefully manage project
costs and schedule risks and mitigate
carefully against overruns.
Indeed an early stage risk management strategy could be to seek tax
incentives (i.e., a greater share of the
upside) from governments in return for
making high-risk investments offshore.
This, however, is easier said than done.
It was achieved in the mid-1990s in
Nigeria, but once giant fields were discovered and perceived exploration risks
reduced the government soon clawed
back most of the incentives.
Wet gas can provide substantially
more robust project economics than
dry gas particularly if liquids can be
tied into existing infrastructure at low
cost. This additional revenue stream can
help to offset the high capital cost risks
of deepwater gas field developments. In
a similar way integrated projects including deepwater gas field and onshore
processing plant and-or LNG and GTL
facilities provide more economically
attractive projects than stand-alone gas
field developments.
As well as revenue/cost benefits key
advantages of integrated projects are
that risks are spread along the gas supply chain and the projects can be made
more contractually robust, mitigating

More conventional techniques are
used for abandoning dry-tree type
completions, but tubing retrieval and
abandonment of subsea completions
require the same specialized equipment
used for initial installation at a very
high cost.2
Advances in new technology and
techniques should provide the industry
with cost- and risk-reduction opportunities for deepwater field abandonments. The technology, concept design
and the complexity of deepwater operations have changed dramatically in the
last 5 years.
To sustain the growth of deepwater operations, the industry will be
continually challenged to make new
advances. It is in the interests of both
operator and service industry to provide
solutions to the technical challenges we
will face.

of Petrofac Malaysia, told OGJ that one
factor that made this low-cost development solution possible for this marginal
field was the level seabed at Cendor that
allowed installation of the mat-supported MOPU.
The field currently produces 12,000
bo/d and Petrofac says that the field
contains about 24.6 million bbl of
recoverable 41.5° gravity oil.
Petrofac has a 30% interest in the
field. Other interest owners are Petronas

main locations in Woking, Sharjah, and
Mumbai; a facilities management and
training group that primarily works off
the UK for companies that recently have
purchased producing properties from
larger companies; and an investment
group that holds interests in oil and gas
producing properties or infrastructure,
aligned to its client and partner base.
Petrofac currently has interests in oil
and gas field developments in Tunisia,
Algeria, and off the UK. Cendor is the
first field in which it is the operator under a joint operating team arrangement
with Petronas Carigali.

Cendor project
Hall said that Petrofac had been able
to take the Cendor project from “farmin to full production in less than 2 years
in a tight market, within budget, and
ahead of the prescribed timetable.”
Over the years, four different operating companies have drilled about 11
exploration wells in the block since the
1970s with only the most recent operator, Hess encountering hydrocarbon
production potential.
Hess’ Cendor-1 had a 1,790-m TD
and tested up to 2,840 b/d of 42°
gravity oil from one zone, with another
zone flowing more than 5 MMscfd of
gas (OGJ Online, Mar. 23, 2001).
Petrofac describes the Cendor
structure as a large inversion anticline
compartmentalized by a number of
north-south trending faults. The principal reservoirs in the first development
phase are the H15 and H20 intervals
within the Middle Miocene formations that are highly stratified and vary
between muddy hetereolithics, sandy
hetereolithics, and clean sands.
Previous operators considered the
field marginal because of the uncertainties associated with the extent of
reservoir compartmentalization and the
relative productivities of the different facies that caused difficulties with formulating a development plan.
Another problem in delineating
the field was the presence of shallow

production unit in Cendor field off Malaysia (Fig. 2). Photo from Petrofac Ltd.
gas that inhibits resolution of seismic
horizons across the structural crest at
reservoir depth.
Key to Petrofac’s development was to
obtain operational flexibility for dealing
with as many potential reservoir outcomes as possible at the lowest possible
cash commitment, Hall said.
He described the previous development schemes as assuming lightweight
platforms with limited flexibility. Petrofac
on the other hand noted that the seabed
at Cendor is flat, which made installation
of an old style mat-supported drilling rig
as a production platform commercially
feasible.
Petrofac leases the unit and also the
FSO, which adds to the flexibility.
The MOPU has a deck area that accommodates two first-stage separators
as well as a test unit. It can process up
to 20,000 bo/d but has a turndown design to produce as little as 2,000 bo/d,
which at high oil prices is economic,
according to Hall.
The well completions have triple
splitter wellheads, so that the MOPU
effectively has 12 well slots within four
36-in. by 11⁄4-in. WT conductors.
The deck has sufficient deck space
for a laydown area to carryout workovers with a hydraulic workover unit.

Petrofac also has had the mud pumps
refurbished and installed the required
piping in case the oil from the wells
needs to be artificially lifted with jet
pumps. The MOPU also has the capability to inject 25,000 bw/d.
The wells produce with a 250 scf/
bbl GOR.
Petrofac uses carbon steel tubulars in
the wells and injects chemical downhole to prevent corrosion.
A low-cost flexible composite subsea
hose, installed from a motorized reel on
a small dynamically positioned vessel,
connects the MOPU to the FSO. Manuli
Rubber Industries, Milan, Italy manufactured the hose.
Hall said the project has the following innovative firsts for Malaysia:
• First MOPU.
• Longest span of unsupported conductor, 80 m.
• First flexible subsea pipeline made
of composite material.
The Atwood Vicksburg jack-up drilled
and compled the seven wells (Fig. 2).
Petrofac’s next plan is to evaluate reservoir performance to rapidly progress
further development and to drill an appraisal well on the other side fault block
where only one dry hole was drilled,
Hall said. ✦

During the last half of 2006, the initial transition to ultralow-sulfur diesel
(ULSD) and ethanol blending has gone
smoothly for US refiners. The Oct. 15
deadline for 15-ppm (wt) sulfur ULSD
at the retail outlet was ahead of schedule, which is further evidence that the
transition is proceeding as planned.1
The data indicate that more must be
done to reach the 80% ULSD goal; the
trend indicates
that US refiners
will attain this
goal. The US
Energy Information Administration tracks
the volume of
ULSD that is downgraded to 500-ppm
(wt) sulfur diesel. Downgrades are
showing a positive trend, falling to less
than 1% after from a high of 20%. This
indicates the industry is adapting to
ULSD production requirements.

nonattainment areas.
This past summer had record high
crude and product prices with constant or slightly increased demand for
both gasoline and highway diesel. The
increase in price and demand is contrary to historic market performance; it
seems to indicate that neither ULSD nor
ethanol blending affected supply.
Record price increases for gasoline
and diesel are primarily crude related,
masking the secondary effects due
to supply or quality. The conclusion
reached after studying these factors using the preliminary data is that gasoline
and ULSD supplies were adequate.

Crude, product demand

To frame current and projected market situations, we studied the effect of
worldwide crude and product demand
on price. Historically, as crude prices
increase, demand decreases and sets a
crude price ceiling at about $26/bbl.
Recent crude prices and demand have
increased simultaneously.
Our projections are that crude demand will continue to rise and prices

result was a net reduction in gasolineproduction capacity due to the removal
of MTBE capacity, which was partially
offset by the mandate to use ethanol.
Ethanol use has many technical effects on refining, pipeline, and terminating facilities, all of which increase
the cost of gasoline production. As with
ULSD, we developed key success factors
for ethanol use to determine if ethanol is being used as envisioned—data
sources have large lag times.

Success factors for renewable fuels,
primarily ethanol blending and production of RFG without oxygenates, are:

had experience in this area. California
Air Resources Board gasoline allowed
for nonoxygenated gasoline that has
achieved tailpipe emissions targets.
• Supply logistics.
• Refining industries’ recognition
of the need for renewable fuels, with
ethanol blending being the first step.
• Wide consumer acceptance of
ethanol as a clean, renewable fuel.

Ethanol blending—regulations
Three primary ethanol gasolines are
produced in the US:
• Conventional blends with no more
than 10% ethanol.
• RFG using ethanol as an oxygenate.
• E85, which is 85% ethanol and
15% conventional gasoline.
Of these three, most ethanol is used
in conventional and RFG blends. E85
requires car engines designed for multiple fuel types and the majority of the
US automotive fleet is not equipped to
burn this fuel. The regulatory requirement for the industry is “Regulation
of Fuels and Fuel Additives: Renewable
Fuel Standard Program” (EPA-OAR2005-0161; FRL 8016-9).
Fig. 9 shows US renewable-fuels
requirements.
Assuming that US gasoline consumption in 2006 was 142 billion gal,
then the ethanol content of the pool
50

May 18, 2005

is 2.78%. A ratio is used to determine
annual industry compliance; if the 2006
volume is not achieved, a “carryover”
volume into 2007 will occur.
• Conventional gasoline containing ethanol has been produced for
many years and the regulatory change
does not affect production. Increases
in ethanol production, however, would
likely increase the use of ethanol and
the ethanol-containing conventional
gasoline supply.

Nonattainment areas, RFG
The Energy Policy Act removed
the requirement to use oxygenates
in gasoline in nonattainment areas.
Removal of the oxygenate mandate in
the US enabled refiners to produce RFG
without oxygenates while, at the same
time, specifying that US gasoline must
increase its content of domestically
produced ethanol. The legislation basically makes MTBE unattractive as a US
gasoline-blending additive.
Ethanol began replacing MTBE in
RFG starting about April 2006. Production, availability, transportation, and delivery of ethanol were some reasons for
sharp increases in the price of gasoline
in early summer 2006. But these were
overshadowed by a run-up in crude
prices.
RFG production using ethanol was
part of the original Energy Policy

Act regulations.
Emission calculations and other
requirements for
compliance were
also included in
the regulation.
Many refiners have
experience with
ethanol blending and producing reformulated
blendstocks for
oxygenate blending, the nonethanol containing
refinery product
that is blended
with ethanol at the

terminal.
Nonoxygenate routes for producing
RFG use blending components such
as alkylate, iso-octane, raffinate, and
others. Many options exist to produce
these blendstocks with a corresponding
capital investment.
Refiners can gain additional gasoline-production capacity by using
ethanol as a blend stock vs. investing
capital in new equipment. Ethanol, for
example, supplied to the East Coast
by barge may be an economic option
compared to other alternatives such as
capital investment to produce alkylate
or iso-octane.
Fig. 10 shows that ethanol has replaced ethers in RFG, based on EIA data.
The quantity of RFG produced without oxygenates averaged 3% before and
after the oxygen mandate was removed.
This supports the idea that, in the short
term, ethanol is the cost-effective replacement for MTBE.

Ethanol supply logistics
Ethanol requires many steps to deliver it to the consumer:
• Crop planting, fertilizing, and
harvesting.
• Transportation of corn to ethanol
plant.
• Ethanol production.
• Transportation to blending facility
via rail or truck.

such as food exports. If new acreage is

USDA predicts that 30% of US corn
production will be earmarked for

Energy supply
Ethanol requires a large investment in fossil-fuel energy to grow the
feedstock, harvest, process, and deliver
it to the marketplace. All of these steps
require fossil fuels. The energy delivered by ethanol as a transportation fuel
should exceed the energy required for
production for it to be considered a viable long-term energy source.
US ethanol production is primarily
from corn, which produces an ethanol
that is slightly energy positive. Improvements in cellulose fermentation and
energy integration will further improve
the energy balance.

Future ethanol supply, demand
Ethanol demand will exceed supplies
until about 2008. This will spur imports
to meet demand. After 2008, US ethanol production will satisfy the country’s
demands. If current projections for
ethanol capacity increases are accurate,
the 2012 ethanol target required in the
renewable energy mandate can probably
be met by 2009 without use of imports.
If Brazil continues to expand production, worldwide demand will be met.
Currently, US ethanol production
is subsidized to encourage increased
capacity. A phaseout of the subsidies or
altering them to encourage new technologies is a possible path for regulatory consideration.
The big ethanol users will be the US
and Japan, which is another significant
importer from Brazil. Where gasoline
demand is strong, ethanol demand will
be strong. There are other producers of
ethanol; possible new capacity will be

OCS plan letter
appeals to law,
national interest
US oil and gas producers and contractors
have resorted to basics in their efforts to expand leasing of federal land offshore. They’re
appealing to law and national interest.
Seven industry trade groups delivered
this combination punch in a letter to Minerals Management Service ofﬁcials. They
were responding to the agency’s proposed
schedule and draft environmental impact
statement for Outer Continental Shelf lease

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

sales during July 2007-June 2012.
The 5-year plan calls for leasing in the
Central and Western Gulf of Mexico, Cook
Inlet, Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, North
Aleutian basin, and possibly a small area off
Virginia.
The groups pointed out in their letter
that the prospective sales still cover less
than 12% of the 1.7 billion acres under MMS
management.
“The agency is being much too conservative,” wrote the National Ocean Industries
Association, Natural Gas Supply Association, Petroleum Equipment Suppliers
Association, Domestic Petroleum Council,
Independent Petroleum Association of
America, International Association of Drilling
Contractors, and US Oil & Gas Association.
Their letter noted that the OCS Lands Act
calls for lease sale schedules that “best meet
national energy needs for the 5-year period”
and speciﬁes that an equitable sharing of
developmental beneﬁts and environmental
risks be taken into account in leasing decisions.
“In order to complete the analysis
required by conducting such ‘equitable sharing’ among the regions and determining the
relative environmental risks, it is necessary
to conduct a full analysis of all the OCS
areas,” the groups wrote.
Their letter also criticized the program and
draft environmental impact statement for not
considering the prospective “socioeconomic
impacts” on citizens of all 50 states.
It called for analysis of “both producing
energy from the offshore and of not producing energy from many areas of the offshore.”
And it elaborated: “The resources of the
OCS are owned by all Americans, and the
hardship created by withholding our energy
resources from people in middle America
should be analyzed in the environmental
impact statement and in the decision-making process.”
These are polite ways of saying that
leasing restricted to a small part of the OCS
shirks law, cheats Americans, and therefore
needs to grow.

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

December crude contract expires at low
The December contract for benchmark US crudes expired Nov. 17 at $55.81/bbl,
the lowest closing price in 17 months on the New York Mercantile Exchange, amid
calls from some members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries for
another production cut.
The contract had plunged $2.50 to $56.26/bbl Nov. 16, the lowest closing for a
front-month oil contract since Nov. 18, 2005.
The new front-month January crude contract slipped by 17¢ to $58.81/bbl Nov.
20 but rebounded to $60.17/bbl in the next trading session as strong winds halted
tanker loadings in Valdez, Alas., and reduced the ﬂow of crude through the TransAlaska Pipeline to 25% of normal capacity.
NYMEX was closed Nov. 23-24 for the US Thanksgiving holiday. But analysts in
the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc. reported oil prices were
up in other markets Nov. 24 on news of militant attacks on crude supplies in Nigeria, which disrupted production of 60,000 b/d. Eni SPA declared force majeure at
Okono-Okpoho offshore oil ﬁeld. “Nigeria has suffered anywhere between 600,000
to 800,000 b/d loss in production due to the continuous militant attacks that have
plagued the oil rich Niger Delta,” said Raymond analysts. Although crude prices had
vacillated in recent weeks, they said, “Continuous geopolitical turmoil provides a
support to crude prices near the $60/bbl level.”
Earlier, Raymond James analysts said OPEC’s call for a second production cut
reinforces suspicion that the production cut instigated on Nov. 1 was lower than the
announced 1.2 million b/d. Still, Saudi Arabia’s oil minister said his country might
support another production cut at OPEC’s Dec. 14 meeting in Nigeria. Meanwhile,
Oil Movements, which tracks tanker operations, said OPEC exports are expected to
increase by 150,000 b/d to 24.58 million b/d in the 4 weeks to Dec. 9 after remaining
ﬂat during the 4 weeks prior to Nov. 25.
The Nov. 23-26 Thanksgiving holiday had a dual effect on US energy demand. On
one hand, it was expected to cut power demand with ofﬁces and some businesses
closed.
However, energy prices had rebounded earlier partially in anticipation of holiday
travel. More people travel over the Thanksgiving holiday than any during other US
holiday. Some 31.7 million motorists were expected to take to US roads and highways, representing 83% of total travelers expected over the 4-day holiday.
US inventories
The Energy Information Administration said US commercial inventories of crude
jumped by 5.1 million bbl to 341.1 million bbl during the week ended Nov. 17. Gasoline stocks increased by 1.4 million bbl to 201.7 million bbl during the same period.
Distillate fuel inventories fell by 1.2 million bbl to 133.8 million.
Imports of crude grew by 1 million b/d to 10.5 million b/d in the same week. Input
of crude into US reﬁneries increased by 60,000 b/d to 15 million b/d, with reﬁneries
operating at 87.1% of capacity.
EIA also reported the withdrawal of 1 bcf of natural gas from US underground
storage in the same week, compared with a 5 bcf injection the previous week and a
9 bcf withdrawal during the same period last year. US gas storage now stands at 3.4
tcf, up by 174 bcf from year-ago levels and 240 bcf above the 5-year average.
The latest withdrawal of gas “does not appear to reﬂect any new incremental
‘backed-out’ demand or change in our view of the supply-demand fundamentals,”
said Robert S. Morris, Banc of America Securities LLC, New York. US weather Nov. 117 was nearly 10% warmer than the 10-year average for that period. Since November
accounts for only 15% of a normal winter’s heating demand, the month “has historically not been a precursor” for the full winter. “If temperatures for the rest of the
winter match the 10-year average, we project that natural gas storage levels will end
March at about 1.35 tcf vs. last year’s record high [of] 1.7 tcf, and the 5-year average
of roughly 1.2 tcf,” Morris said.
To accomplish that, however, the pace of gas withdrawals this winter would
have to average 13.9 bcfd in November-March vs. 9.9 bcfd last winter, in the face of
increased supply relative to the hurricane curtailment of offshore production in 2005
and some increase in “organic” production, he acknowledged.
Raymond James analysts said, “On the natural gas front, prices have held within
a 98¢/Mcfe range during [most of] November (with a high of $8.26), after months
of intense volatility. Frigid weather is the most likely catalyst needed for oil and gas
prices to break out of their respective trading ranges.”

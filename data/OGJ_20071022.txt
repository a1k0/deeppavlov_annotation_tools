COVER
Overflow from the Colville River during spring break up surrounds
the 6-acre Oooguruk gravel island, Beaufort Sea, in June 2007
(photo from Pioneer Natural Resources Alaska Inc.). Nabors Alaska Drilling Co.’s Rig 19 was moved to the island in April and is
the first AC rig to operate on the North Slope.The annual drilling
report, starting on p. 41, reviews worldwide drilling activity, operator and contractor activities, and the record number of offshore rigs
under construction.The Canadian drilling report, p. 50, discusses
drilling forecasts, rig fleets, and upcoming projects, in the face of
depressed natural gas prices and potential royalty changes.
The Zeus jack up, shown above, has loomed at the edge of the
Freeport harbor channel, Brazoria Co.,Tex., for decades.The state
plans to remove it soon, after which boaters will be able to navigate
by the storage tanks under construction at the adjacent Freeport
LNG terminal.

Interest

DOE to continue RIK ﬁll program for SPR
The US Department of Energy on Oct. 10 solicited contracts to
exchange as much as 13 million bbl of crude oil from federal Gulf
of Mexico leases for crude that meets Strategic Petroleum Reserve
specifications. Bids are due by Nov. 6.
DOE said the solicitation follows provisions of the 2005 Energy
Policy Act, which directs that the SPR be filled to its authorized 1
billion bbl capacity. The reserve’s current capacity is 727 million
bbl. It currently holds 693 million bbl of inventory.
The solicitation calls for about 70,000 b/d to be added over 6
months. DOE said the royalty in-kind (RIK) contracts would begin
in January 2008, with deliveries to begin on or around Feb. 1 and
completed by July 31.
Under the federal RIK program, federal lessees deliver crude
in lieu of royalties to the US Minerals Management Service, which
then resells it on the open market. MMS has said the program is
more efficient and saves the government money.
House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Nick J. Rahall
(D-W.Va.) has been critical of the RIK program’s operation, however, and the energy bill that cleared the committee earlier this year
contained a provision limiting future oil royalties in-kind to SPR
refills. It was not part of a later energy bill that the full House approved, a committee spokeswoman told OGJ.
DOE said that in such purchases, lessees deliver the royalty
crude to market centers along the Gulf Coast, and ownership is
transferred to DOE from the Department of the Interior. Contractors are required to take the full contracted amount from the market centers and deliver exchange oil to the SPR. Actual volumes
delivered to the reserve reflect account adjustments for quality differences and transportation costs, DOE said.

EU’s Solana promotes EU-Asia energy cooperation
European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana in Central
Asia Oct. 10 expressed hope that disagreement over the Kashagan
oil field project will be solved in terms of the existing agreement.
“We hope that the solution to this issue will soon be found in
terms of the [production-sharing] agreement that has been signed,
and that the solution will be found without modifying the agreement,” said Solana, referring to the dispute between the Kazakh
government and the Eni SPA-led consortium developing the field
(OGJ Online, Oct. 8, 2007).
“I am sure this issue will be solved in a positive and constructive manner,” said Solana, who added that Europe intends to cooperate with Kazakhstan in the exploitation of energy resources.
In particular, he said a trans-Caspian pipeline should be built to
transmit gas from Central Asia to Europe.
“It’s a project that has to be implemented,” said Solana, who

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

added that the project had been discussed at meetings with Kazakh
and Turkmen leaders.
Solana was in Kazakhstan as part of a Central Asian tour to promote cooperation between the region and the EU, particularly in
the field of energy resources.
On Oct. 9, Solana visited Turkmenistan, where he also promoted
energy cooperation with the EU and construction of the trans-Caspian pipeline.

Exploration proceeds off Myanmar as crisis boils
Exploration work on Myanmar’s Block M9 in the Gulf of Martaban is progressing “normally,” according to Thailand’s majority
state-owned PTT Exploration & Production PLC, despite Myanmar’s
biggest street protests in 20 years. A major natural gas discovery
was made on the block, which lies 300 km south of Yangon, just a
week before the violent crackdown on demonstrations began.
Four exploration and four appraisal wells have already been
drilled on Block M9, and plans are afoot to drill an additional four
to five appraisal wells to confirm petroleum reserves. Drilling will
take place between December and April 2008 (OGJ Online, Aug.
15, 2007).
Exploration results have confirmed the commercial potential of
Block M9, and PTTEP executives indicated earlier that 300 MMcfd
could be brought on stream in 2011 or 2012 (OGJ Online, May
23, 2007).
PTTEP has held a Block M9 production-sharing contract with
Myanmar since 2003 and holds 100% interest in the block.
Meanwhile, Thai Energy Minister Piyasvasti Amranand has postponed talks with the current Myanmar regime for purchase of gas
from the block. The crisis is complicating negotiations, which are
not expected to begin any time soon.
However Piyasvasti reiterated Thailand’s intention to secure
more gas supplies from Myanmar when the kingdom can ensure
that any deal will be secure.
Thai officials indicated the talks could wait until PTTEP fully
completes its exploration program.

NEB: Canada’s gas deliverability to decline
Canadian conventional natural gas deliverability is forecast to
decline, Canada’s National Energy Board (NEB) said in a recent
report.
Canada’s average gas deliverability is forecast to decrease to
14.5-15.8 bcfd in 2009 from 17.1 bcfd in 2006.
“The drilling pace that sustained Canadian natural gas deliverability is gone for the moment,” said NEB Chairman Gaetan
Caron.
Most Canadian gas resources are in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin. Production from WCSB has decreased gradually as

the basin matures. WCSB drilling slowed during 2006 because of
continued high project costs. Meanwhile, oil sands development
projects compete with conventional gas projects for investment
dollars.
With less drilling, gas production is starting to decrease. The
flow of gas from the maturing WCSB alone is expected to drop to
an average of 13.7 bcfd in 2009 from 16.2 bcfd for 2006, NEB
said.

Drillers are concentrating on the WCSB’s deeper western side,
which requires complex, expensive drilling with a potential for
large returns.
“We see cause for optimism as deeper drilling and improved
techniques help producers deliver tighter gas from deeper wells,”
Caron said. “In the longer term, Canadians should rest assured that
their natural gas needs will be met as other sources, such as unconventional gas, liquefied natural gas, or gas from frontier areas, enter
Canada’s energy market.” ✦

Japan, China still in talks over E. China Sea dispute
Japan and China Oct. 11 ended their 10th round of talks aimed
at resolving the dispute over gas exploration rights in the East China Sea without reaching any agreement.
There is still a substantial gap between the two sides’ positions
on the matter, according to Kenichiro Sasae, Japan’s main negotiator during the most recent talks in Beijing. Sasae expressed hope
that agreement could still be reached this fall, as further talks are
due to be held in Tokyo next month.
The disagreement over gas exploration stems from a disputed
maritime boundary between the two countries in the East China
Sea, where China has already started production in the Tianwaitian
area.
In April China said its exploration for oil and gas in the East
China Sea does not fall into waters shared with Japan and can be
conducted on a unilateral basis (OGJ Online, Apr. 12, 2007).

IOGCC: Marginal wells continue to boost US supply And marginal oil production increased by 4%.
Marginal wells continue to play an important role in boosting
US oil and gas supply, according to the latest report from the Interstate Oil & Gas Compact Commission. In 2006 marginal wells
produced nearly 1.03 billion bbl of oil and 14.9 tcf of natural gas,
IOGCC said.
The report, “Marginal Wells: Fuel for Economic Growth,” also
stated that while marginal gas production decreased slightly from
the previous year, the number of marginal gas wells rose by 3%.
8

Furthermore, IOGCC’s report outlines the economic benefits
that these wells create. It said in 2006 states collected more than
$1.2 billion in severance taxes from producing marginal wells. On
a national level, every $1 million of marginal oil and gas produced
creates nine jobs, it said.
However, even at current prices, the small operators which typically run marginal wells find them expensive to maintain, according to the report. In 2006, plugged and abandoned marginal wells

Permian basin. A carbon capture and storage (CCS) developer, Blue
Source said the Apple Tree gas plant is at the foothills of the Rocky
Mountains near La Veta, Colo.
Gas produced from Oakdale field is 22% methane and 78% CO2.
The gas is separated using membrane modules. Before start of the
CCS project, CO2 was vented into the atmosphere. The CCS project
is reducing CO2 emissions by about 400,000 tonnes/year.
On Oct. 8, Blue Source announced CO2 was captured from the
vent stack and transported via the Sheep Mountain CO2 pipeline to
be used for EOR projects. The Apple Tree vent stack and an associated 16-mile pipeline cost $8 million, Blue Source said.

“We must assure that appropriate efforts are made to extend
the life of marginal wells so energy from domestic sources will
continue to be available,” said Roy Edwards, executive director of
the Oklahoma Marginal Well Commission, which cofunded the report.
IOGCC Acting Executive Director Gerry Baker said, “The states,

Chevron to upgrade Pascagoula reﬁnery
Chevron USA Inc. plans to invest $500 million to build a continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) unit at its 325,000 b/cd refinery in Pascagoula, Miss.
Project construction is scheduled to begin in early 2008, with
completion anticipated by mid-2010. The company already has secured environmental permits.
The CCR unit, which replaces two older units, will improve
equipment reliability and utilization, and allow the refinery to optimize product yields. The refinery’s oil capacity will remain the
same, but its gasoline production is expected to increase by about
10%, or 600,000 gpd.
This increase in gasoline production follows a previous increase
of 10% to about 5.5 million gpd of gasoline production that was
realized when the company brought online its fluid catalytic cracking unit in late 2006 (OGJ Online, Dec. 19, 2006).
Separately, Chevron announced that after further damage assessments of an Aug. 16 fire at the Pascagoula facility, it expects refinery
repairs to be completed during first quarter 2008.
The fire damage was largely isolated to the refinery’s No. 2 crude
unit. Plans and preparations for the repairs are under way. Additional conversion units, which were already off line for planned
turnaround activities, have been recommissioned to increase the
production of gasoline and distillates from the facility.
The company is utilizing its system of manufacturing plants and
downstream infrastructure to minimize supply disruptions, and it
said it expects to continue to meet all of its supply requirements
and customer product commitments.
Chevron, in coordination with the appropriate local, state, and
federal agencies, is still in the process of conducting a thorough
investigation of the cause of the fire. There were no injuries related
to the fire.

Pakistan approves Khalifa Point reﬁnery near Hub

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
ery project at Khalifa Point near the Hub area of Balochistan province.
Ashfaq Hassan Khan, briefing adviser to the finance ministry,
said preliminary work has begun on the refinery, which will have a
capacity of 200,000-300,000 b/d.
The facility would be established as a 74:26 joint venture of
Abu Dhabi-based International Petroleum Investment Co. (IPIC)
and Pak-Arab Refinery Co. The project is expected to be completed
and commissioned by first quarter 2011.
The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources was authorized
to sign the implementation agreement with IPIC within a month.
Various concessions had been announced for the project, including a 20-year tax holiday, exemption from 5% workers’ profit
participation, and exemption from 0.5% services charges under
the export processing zones rules.
Pakistan also advises Oil & Gas Development Corp. to dedicate
at least 80% of the liquefied petroleum gas produced from Chanda
field for distribution in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of
northern Pakistan.

QP lets petrochem contracts for Mesaieed complex
Qatar Petroleum subsidiary Qatar Intermediate Industries Holding Co. Ltd. has awarded contracts to two subsidiaries of Foster
Wheeler’s Global Engineering & Construction Group for work on a
proposed grassroots petrochemical complex at Mesaieed, Qatar.
One contract calls for Foster Wheeler to execute the front-end
engineering and design, while the other is to provide project management and construction management services. Foster Wheeler
said its work also includes procurement of long-lead items.
For this project, Qatar Holding is establishing a joint venture
company with South Korea’s Honam Petrochemical Corp.
The firm said the new complex, slated for completion in 2011,
will include world-scale olefins and aromatics units, which will supply ethylene, propylene, and benzene to the downstream polypropylene, ethylbenzene, styrene monomer, and polystyrene facilities.

GCC’s reﬁning capacity to rise 45% by 2010
The total refining capacity of the six Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) countries is expected to increase by 45.5% in 2010—to 6.3
million b/d from 4.33 million b/d, according to a report by the
Emirates Industrial Bank (EIB).
“The potential increase is a result of four new refineries planned
in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Oman, as well as of renovating
old refineries and increasing their production capacity in the UAE
and Kuwait,” it said.
EIB noted that while the GCC’s oil production currently comprises 19% of world output, the current capacity of the group’s 20
existing refineries constitutes just 5% of the world’s overall refin-

ing capacity of 85.4 million b/d.
The report blamed the lack of refining capacity around the
world for the reduced supply of products and their consequent
high costs. “The rise in the cost of oil refining and the closure of
15 refineries in the world have led to a shortage in oil products...in
the past 3 years,” it explained.
“The rise in oil refining capacity in some countries has contributed to curbing this gap, which eventually helped in curbing oil
prices and creating huge inflation rates in world countries, including oil producing and exporting countries,” EIB said.
GCC member countries are Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. ✦

Sakhalin-2 receives LNG for plant testing, startup
Sakhalin Energy Investment Co., operator of the Sakhalin-2
project, has received a second shipment of LNG for use in testing
and start-up operations at its gas liquefaction plant on Sakhalin
Island.
The company said it took a day to offload Marathon Oil Corp.’s
Arctic Sun shipment of 85,000 cu m of Alaskan LNG into two LNG
storage tanks at Prigorodnoye on southern Sakhalin Island.
Sakhalin Energy said the primarily methane Alaskan LNG is
“ideally suited” for commissioning and testing the LNG facility.
It said the process began in July, with the initial shipment of LNG
delivered from Indonesia.
Sakhalin Energy said the Arctic Sun would return to its normal
duties in Alaska, where, along with its sister ship the Polar Eagle,
it normally transports LNG to Japan. The firm did not say why the
sourcing shifted to Alaska from Indonesia.
The arrival of the Alaska LNG came just days after a naming ceremony Oct. 4 for two new 147,000 cu m LNG carriers—the Grand
Elena and Grand Aniva—at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.’s Nagasaki facility.
The two carriers were built for a Japanese-Russian joint venture
of Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NYK Line) and Russia’s stateowned JSC Sovcomflot under a contract awarded Nov. 15, 2004.
Sakhalin Energy has chartered the carriers long-term to deliver
LNG to customers in Asia-Pacific. The two tankers are ice-strengthened and designed to operate at low temperatures to ensure yearround operations from Sakhalin.
Earlier this month, the Russian government announced plans to
build a new port at Ilyinsky on Sakhalin Island to export oil and gas
from offshore fields (OGJ Online, Oct. 1, 2007).
Meanwhile, an environmental impact report, produced by AEA
Technology for potential lenders to the Sakhalin-2 oil and gas development project in Russia’s Far East, gave an overall green light,
with some reservations, to the project.
Prior to the report’s publication, Russian Natural Resources
Minister Yuri Trutnev said he would travel to Sakhalin “around November” to assess the situation.

stream on Oct. 12.
Norwegian pipeline operator Gassco AS said the 23.1-km, 32in. Tampen Link line will transport 25 million cu m/day and will
tie Statfjord into Britain’s existing Flags system, which extends to
St. Fergus, Scotland.
Gassco is operator for Tampen Link, which was incorporated in
the company’s integrated network on Sept. 1.
The Statfjord partners will convert three Statfjord field platforms
from handling oil with associated gas, to handling gas with associated oil. The work enables Statfjord to continue Statfjord production to 2020, with partners investing just over $2.7 billion.
Statfjord field’s late-life additional resources are estimated at 32
billion cu m of gas, 25 million bbl of oil, and 60 million bbl of
condensate. The expected recovery ratio is as high as 70% for oil
and 75% for gas.

Urals gets Transneft approval for ESPO line tie-in

Urals Energy, Nicosia, said it received approval from Russia’s
state-run OAO Transneft to build a pipeline tie-in from its Dulisminskoye field to the Eastern Siberia Pacific Ocean (ESPO) pipeline.
Following approval of proposed technical designs and projected
construction work, Urals said it intends to commence field preparation work in the fourth quarter.
The Dulisminskoye field in Eastern Siberia is estimated to have
464 million boe, and is projected to produce 30,000 b/d by 2011.
First oil from the field is expected to flow into Transneft’s ESPO in
the first half of 2009.
In late September, Russia’s Natural Resources Ministry dropped accusations of falsifying hydrocarbon estimates against Urals Energy.
Following an appeal by Urals, the ministry working group confirmed estimates supplied by the company to the State Reserves
Commission exceeded the DeGolyer and MacNaugton estimate by
30%.
Urals expects production to reach a minimum of 12,000 b/d of
oil by the end of 2007, instead of its previously announced target
of 15,000 b/d, which it now expects to reach by mid-2008. Urals’

Well-cost estimates
As the director of statistics at the
American Petroleum Institute, I read
with great interest the recent articles
about estimating drilling costs (OGJ,
Aug. 6, 2007, p. 39; Aug. 13, p. 46; Aug.
27, p. 39). I was surprised that the authors, writing about API’s Joint Association Survey on Drilling Costs (JAS), did
not take the time to talk with us. Had
they done so, they would have learned
that API’s models are extremely accurate
in predicting well costs, with R2 usually
ranging from 0.81 to 0.94. In fact, in
the Gulf of Mexico, where the authors
did their in-depth study, API’s 2005
model has an R2 of 0.89 with an error of
only 2%.
For over half a century, API has relied
on publicly available data, as well as actual well costs provided by hundreds of
operators, to estimate drilling costs for
the entire US. As a result, the JAS contains drilling costs by area where data is
tabulated per well type and well class,
breaking out horizontal, sidetrack, CBM,
and offshore wells.
While we always welcome new and
creative methodologies, the JAS’s track
record and thorough reporting remain
unmatched.

Bigger picture
At a time when hydrocarbon fuels
are at or near all-time high prices it is
in the interest of not just the bulk of
individuals, but also the bulk of businesses and the bulk of nations, to make
sure that resources are being used as
efficiently as possible. It is similarly
important that these resources be devoted to areas in which substitution is
either technologically or economically
difficult (transportation), while other
areas in which substitution is somewhat
easier (base goods manufacturing) pursue whatever technical and economic
advantages can be found in substitution.
Recycling plastics is a double winner.
It not only allows the earth’s hydrocarbon
resources to be dedicated increasingly to
other areas, but the act itself is generally
less energy-intensive than manufacturing
plastics from new source materials. Given
the pervasiveness of plastics in modern
life, both consumers and finished goods
manufacturers will want to obtain any
plastics they need as cheaply as possible.
Plastics manufacturers, meanwhile,
are driven by their bottom lines to
find the least expensive avenue to meet
demand for their products.
Economies of scale and integration
might mean for some that this continues to be done by turning raw materials
into plastics. But as the cost of raw materials continues to rise, the economic
opportunities presented by recycling
will become more attractive to everyone: from Soares to the fully integrated
supermajors. ✦

Energy in the shadows
It would have been naive to hope energy bills
passed by the House and Senate might die because
no one got around to reconciling them. Still, open
deliberation shouldn’t be too much to ask. House
Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) instead will take
the legislation into shadows so no one can see
how politicians make decisions about who profits
and who pays when they tinker with energy.
For Pelosi, energy is “a flagship issue” that
comes down to “energy security and reversing
global warming.” Never mind the erosion of support for a conference to address differences among
bills passed under those banners. “With or without a conference,” she says, “we will proceed.”

Raising prices
In case anyone needs reminding, the bills
would, among other things, raise taxes on oil
companies, fortify subsidies for renewable fuels,
force holders of federal offshore leases bungled
by the government to renegotiate on government
terms, expand the mandate for ethanol in vehicle
fuel, undermine efforts to streamline drilling approvals, and outlaw “unconscionably excessive” oil
prices in supply emergencies. They would, in other
words, crimp supply of commercial energy and
raise prices of energy overall.
While security and global warming are legitimate concerns, they too easily become tools
of extremism. To Pelosi, energy security means
replacing oil with costlier alternatives. And the
speaker doesn’t want simply to moderate warming
influences by limiting emissions of greenhouse
gases. She wants to reverse global warming. If
human activity really accounts for most of the
warming observed in the past century, reversing
the trend would require emission cuts far greater
than anyone has proposed. To pretend that the
costs of such a response can be made bearable is
disingenuous.
Pelosi might want mostly to produce a bill
President Bush will have to veto. Then she can
complain that the Democrats tried to act on energy only to meet Republican obstructionism.
But even veto bait needs a veneer of legitimacy.
There’s nothing legitimate about forcing people

to render economic sacrifice to hopeless targets.
Replacing cheap with costly energy does not yield
security; it creates hardship. And trying to reverse
global warming is a sure way to dissipate human
welfare in a quest that might be futile.
Alas, Congress is in no mood to ponder hard
energy questions. Most lawmakers will see no political advantage in resisting Pelosi’s worst lurches.
Energy consumers can only hope Bush is in no
mood to split differences with lunacy.
Pelosi has improbable ways to tether her
ambitions, however tenuously, to physical and
economic reality. On energy security, she could
call for more federal oil and gas leasing. Reversing her longstanding position on this issue would
acknowledge that the fastest and most economical
route to improved US energy security is increased
US production of oil and gas. It would acknowledge, in fact, that anyone who claims to support
energy security while resisting leasing or otherwise limiting domestic oil and gas production is
trapped in hopeless contradiction.

Escape contingency
With global warming, Pelosi could give energy
consumers an escape contingency. Some scientists
think the world might be approaching the peak
of a mostly natural warming cycle. Some even
expect cooling to become evident within the next
5-10 years. The activists who inform Pelosi will
hear none of that. But what if the trend in global
average temperature flattens in the next few years?
It wouldn’t necessarily signal the end of observed
warming. But it would be enough to throw doubt
on the need for costly precautions that only then
would be taking effect.
Would Pelosi support a provision in global
warming legislation that promised to relax emission controls—and relieve consumers of the
costs—if temperature data raised questions about
the need? Well, no, she wouldn’t. Such a provision,
like leasing support in a security initiative, would
clash with Pelosi’s apparent commitment to senseless cost. But measures like these would be signs
now missing from US energy discussions of concern for consumer effects, which relate inevitably
to seriousness of intent. ✦

N T E R E S T
US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) director John White recently
announced the commission’s intentions to hire an Engineering Fellow to
evaluate its reserves disclosure rules
and determine whether changes need
to be made. While the industry awaits
the outcome of the SEC’s analysis, Ernst
& Young and Ryder Scott Petroleum
Consultants offer four steps oil and gas
companies can take to
improve the reserves
estimating process and
reduce company risk.
A few years ago,
legislators, think tanks,
investors, consultants,
and representatives
from oil and gas companies began scrutinizing rules the companies have been
following for 3 decades. There was no
shortage of opinions, yet there resulted
little consensus as to how the rules
should or should not change.
Despite years of public discourse, it
appears that no major changes will occur
any time soon. While many companies would prefer to see changes in the
rules requiring disclosure of oil and gas
reserves estimates, most companies seem

content to live with the existing rules.
Why this display of patience? Primarily, it stems from the fact that, internally, most oil and gas companies have
a very different view of their reserve
positions. Within the company, they use
oil and gas reserve estimates to make
investment and operating decisions that

Process and Lower the Risk: Oil and Gas Reserves
Estimates,” was written by the authors for the

can vary significantly from the reserves
that must be disclosed under SEC guidelines.
This raises the question: Who has
the better oil and gas information?
Right or wrong, the companies believe
that they do—a view that tempers any
pleas for changes in the SEC’s oil and
gas reserve disclosure guidelines. At
the same time, financial auditors have
neither reason nor the responsibility to
push for changes in reserves disclosures.
The SEC, as steward for the shareholder,
appears to have little motivation for
change. It appears to embrace the view
that conservatism and comparability are
particularly important in this matter.
However, as the discourse continues, the energy professionals at Ernst &
Young and Ryder Scott suggest that oil
and gas companies continue to shift
their focus to the process that governs
how the rules are interpreted, taught,
applied, and documented in their organizations. The real lesson of the past
few years is that many companies have
not formalized the process for estimating and reporting reserves, which can
greatly increase the risk of restatements
and the fallout that they cause.
There are four steps oil and gas companies can take to mitigate this risk and
restore confidence in how they report
the most important asset they have:
hydrocarbons in the ground.

Deﬁne
The first step in formalizing a process for reserves estimation and reporting is to define and record clearly how
the rules will be interpreted and applied
in the company. To some, this may seem
counterintuitive. After all, rules are
rules, right? In truth, like many other
accounting regulations, these rules are
often open to interpretation, with a
large amount of gray area between the
black and the white.
To illustrate this point, consider the
SEC, which enforces the accounting
and financial reporting standards that it
developed along with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). SEC
regularly issues guidance and interpreOil & Gas Journal / Oct. 22, 2007

tations of these standards as new questions arise, because standards dealing
specifically with oil and gas accounting
and financial reporting were issued during 1977-82—before the emergence of
new technologies and market dynamics
that led to specific questions of interpretation. This is similar to the relationship between the US Constitution and
the US Supreme Court, which issues
80-90 formal written opinions each
year clarifying how the Constitution
applies to modern-day situations that its
authors could not have imagined.
The sometimes-subjective nature
of the rules, however, does not give
companies a license to interpret them
to their benefit on a case-by-case basis.
Historically, SEC has looked favorably
on companies that adopt the most
conservative interpretations and stick
to them, regardless of how they impact
reserves estimates. Companies that opt
for conservatism and apply the rules in
a consistent manner have already taken
a major step in avoiding unexpected
downward revision in their oil and gas
reserve estimates.

Assign
Ask three oil and gas companies
who prepares their reserves estimates
and you’re likely to get three different
answers—or more, if you ask 2 years
in a row. Unlike other key functions
in oil and gas companies, there is little
consistency in who is responsible for
this important function:
• In general, larger companies view
reserve estimates as a full-time job with
a dedicated staff that spends the majority of its time on this process.
• The smaller the company, the more
it is viewed as a part-time, once-a-year
endeavor.
• For companies with multiple
reservoirs scattered about the globe,
the process is often highly decentralized, with asset teams accountable for
estimates of their specific properties.
The result can be different processes
used to evaluate properties within the
same company.
Events of the past few years have

demonstrated that estimating reserves is
a process important enough to warrant
a more thoughtful, uniform approach.
Indeed, more companies are forming
dedicated teams using a consistent,
centralized process to prepare estimates
for all of the company’s reserves.
This is an encouraging development
that more companies should consider.
Oil and gas companies also should
examine how much the measurement of company reserves affects the
compensation of those responsible for
estimating the reserves. Frequently, oil
and gas companies base a portion of
annual employee bonuses on reserves
growth and replacement. While this
makes sense because these metrics play
a major role in projecting the company’s future cash flows and earnings, it

“Historically, SEC
has looked favorably
on companies that
adopt the most conservative interpretations and stick to
them...”
creates an obvious conflict of interest
for those charged with estimating this
measure. Clearly, it’s not advisable to tie
such metrics to compensation.
Certainly, the estimate of an oil and
gas company’s most valuable asset
should be subject to stringent review.
Once it’s determined who is charged
with estimating reserves, it’s equally
important to assign someone to review
and approve the initial estimates.
Whether a second opinion is rendered by an outside reserves engineer
or a group within the company is less
important than the reviewers’ qualifications and independence. In a recently
published survey by John S. Herold,
82% of producers that identified
sources of reserves estimates said they
use third-party consultants.
Because of the increased awareness

by investors and others of the serious
consequences of faulty estimates, it’s
likely that more companies will turn to
outsiders either to prepare initial estimates, review the findings of internal
teams, or resolve internal disagreements. Doing so is an excellent way to
mitigate the risks inherent in this highly
technical—and often highly subjective—evaluation of geological, engineering, and economic data.

Train
Assigning the important task of estimating oil and gas reserves is only half
of the human resources equation. The
other is equipping personnel to do the
job properly.
Currently, there are no statutory
requirements in the US relating to the
qualifications of employees preparing
oil and gas reserves estimates for public
companies. Additionally, the relatively
few state-licensed engineers who may
be involved in this work are not required to sign the reserves reports that
are filed with the SEC.
One can argue that the engineers and
geoscientists charged with preparing reserves estimates for their employers or
clients have a professional responsibility
to seek competent training within their
companies or through other industry
training sources. Unfortunately, this is
not always the case.
Regulators, investors, and others
who use reserves information assume
that companies have established internal
standards and requisite training. As a
result, they have nothing more than
a company’s word that those estimating its oil and gas reserves have been
properly trained. For some companies,
particularly larger ones, that’s a safe
assumption, as they have developed
rigorous and thorough educational and
training standards. For many smaller
organizations, however, qualifications
may be lacking.
Failure to have properly trained and
experienced personnel is unfair to the
employees and to investors, and is an
enormous risk that no company can
afford. At the minimum, companies

White House outlines veto bait in energy package
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The White House has notified US
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)
that President George W. Bush would
veto any energy bill that reduced
instead of increased domestic production, raised taxes or used the tax code
to single out specific industries, or imposed price controls that would bring
back long gasoline lines reminiscent of
the 1970s.
Advisors also would recommend
that a bill be vetoed if it contained elements such as the so-called “NOPEC”
provision, which encouraged retaliation
against US businesses abroad, discouraged foreign investments in the US
economy, and injured US relations with
other countries, said Alan B. Hubbard,

assistant to the president for economic
policy and director of the National
Economic Council, in an Oct. 15 letter
to Pelosi.
Hubbard’s letter came as oil and gas
industry association officials and others
responded to Pelosi’s Oct. 11 announcement that she would use less-formal
meetings between House and Senate
Democrats to produce compromise energy legislation if a formal conference
including Republicans did not appear
possible.
“Every indication we see is that
the Democratic leaders in the House
and Senate plan to get together and
try to cobble together an energy plan.
We’re concerned that several members
with oil and gas experience may be
left out,” Mark Kibbee, a senior policy
analyst at the American Petroleum

Institute, said on Oct. 16.
He told OGJ that API and its members remain concerned about provisions
in energy bills that passed the House
and Senate earlier this year. Both contain language aimed at stopping alleged
gasoline price gouging, for example.
API has said that such provisions actually are indirect efforts to reintroduce
price controls.

Punitive provisions
Kibbee said that other provisions
would roll back incentives included in
the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to assist
the global competitiveness of US producers. “Some of the tax offsets were
very punitive and would deter more
domestic production,” he observed.

tives doesn’t square with trying to
improve energy security,” Kibbee said.
The Institute for Energy Research
said on Oct. 16 that Pelosi, by refusing
to review the bills in a bipartisan conference committee, is trying to avoid
public scrutiny of legislation that will
raise consumer energy prices and put
domestic producers at a disadvantage.
IER economist Robert Murphy said
past government attempts to regulate
oil and gas prices failed. The US could
expect more of the same if new energy
legislation isn’t openly debated, he
warned.
Ben Lieberman, senior policy analyst
with the Heritage Foundation, characterized the bills that passed the House
and Senate as “raising taxes on energies
that work to subsidize energy sources
that don’t work.”
Margo Thorning, senior vicepresident and chief economist at the
American Council of Capital Formation,

said an ACCF study found that “if price
controls like those being considered
in legislative proposals earlier this year
had been in effect during Hurricanes
Katrina and Rita in 2005, losses to
households and businesses would have
totaled $1.9 billion.”
In Dallas, the leader of the Texas Alliance of Energy Producers said on Oct.
12 that Pelosi was trying to go around

standard legislative procedures in an
effort to pass energy legislation which
does not have the necessary support.
“She is attempting to circumvent
long-standing legislative procedures....
The leadership of both parties should
be allowed to appoint their members to
the conference committee and work out
the differences between the energy bills
passed by the House and the Senate,”
said TAEP Chairman Frank King. ✦

oes an $80/bbl oil price pose a
threat the economy? Not necessarily, according to the president of
the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
“Oil prices have been on a steady
climb in recent years, tripling since
early 2003 and breaching $80/bbl
last month. This worries many people
who remember the energy crises of
the 1970s and the ensuing recessions.
In fact, nine of the 10 post-World
War II recessions were preceded by
sharply rising oil prices,” Richard
W. Fischer told the Charlotte (NC)
Economics Club. “I will remind you,
however, we have had several episodes of sharply rising oil prices in
the past 15 years without recessions.”
In what Fischer called personal
observations and not official policy,
he differentiated short-term oil price
swings from long-term supply and
demand fundamentals. Instead of
ignoring energy prices because they
are dropped from the core inflation index, he picks them apart to
understand their recent climb. His
first question is whether a price runup resulted from reduced supply or
increased demand.

domestic product, declines in unemployment, and relatively moderate price pressures, he continued.
Consumer spending and consumer
confidence have remained strong,
while business investments have
expanded. Economic growth overseas
has not been derailed, which has kept
demand for US exports healthy.
Economic research has suggested
that factors including a lower energyto-GDP ratio, experience with oil
price shocks, and trading of energy
derivatives, which reduce the need
for physical inventories, may explain
recent economic resilience, Fischer
said. But he suspects there may be
another reason.

Stronger demand

“For a few years now, some economists have suggested that the US
economy ought to respond differently to rising oil prices if the increase
is the result of stronger demand
for oil needed to fuel an expanding
US economy rather than a result of
diminished supplies,” he said.

HR 3221 would seriously harm other
small businesses, namely marginal oil
and gas well operators.
“The overwhelming number of
wells in the United States falls into
this [marginal] category,” said Lee O.
Fuller, vice-president, government relations, for Independent Petroleum Association of America. Fuller said about
85% of the nation’s oil wells and 70%
of its natural gas wells are classified as
marginal. “Equally significant, while
each marginal well is a small producer,
collectively they provide about 19% of
America’s oil production and 10% of
its natural gas production,” he said.
Most of IPAA’s members are independent producers with fewer than
20 employees, he told the committee. Like larger upstream companies,
they would like more access to federally controlled resources, tax policies
which allow producers to retain their
cash flow and reinvest it, reasonable
environmental regulations and more
federal support of universities’ programs to develop new exploration and
production technologies and train
geologists and petroleum engineers,
Fuller said.
“Not only does HR 3221 fail to
advance the need to develop more oil
and natural gas, it reverses progress
that has already been made. No bill
can be considered a down payment
on global climate policy that has, as
one of its key objectives, curtailing the
development of natural gas,” he said.
The bill contains nine sections dealing with drilling permit applications,
surface owner rights, onshore oil and
gas reclamation and bonding, water
resource protection, and other issues,
which would reduce US oil and gas
production, according to Fuller.
“The effect on small businesses
would be twofold. For those small
business oil and gas producers, investment dollars would be taken away. For
small business consumers, the availability of American oil and gas would
be diminished,” he said. ✦

Oil & Gas UK launches UKCS decommissioning options
Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
Trade association Oil & Gas UK
(OGUK) has launched a new framework
agreement to help operators clarify decommissioning liabilities for infrastructure on the UK continental shelf.
The Decommissioning Cost Provision
Deed (DCPD) provides different options
for joint venture partners to consider
in setting up a decommissioning plan
for offshore assets. DCPD would help
reduce uncertainty over decommissioning responsibilities, as current provisions
under UK law allow the government
to call back previous licensees to pay
decommissioning costs even if they have
sold their interests to another party, said
OGUK Operations Director Paul Dymond in London Oct. 16.
30

“These issues are hindering asset
trading,” Dymond said, adding that this
could jeopardize maximum economic
recovery from the UK North Sea. In
reviewing joint operating agreements
that companies are using to establish
liabilities, OGUK found that many were
inadequate because there were no explicit provisions to cover decommissioning.
The government is committed to review on a case-by-case basis DCPDs that
buyers approve, and if it is satisfied, it
will release sellers from being held responsible for decommissioning liabilities under Section 29 of the Petroleum
Act 1998. In a recent decommissioning
consultation with industry, the government declined to change Section 29,
preferring to monitor the effectiveness
of DCPDs and develop a transparent way
to assess whether buyers can cover their

decommissioning costs.
These costs are expected to fall
between £15-20 billion, with uncertainties regarding technology, product
costs, and timing possibly increasing
estimates. Major projects have been delayed as high oil prices have improved
the economic attractiveness of continuing production.
Improved technologies will help to
decrease costs, but Dymond warned
that technology companies are reluctant

will not use targets, because it is a trade
association and cannot compel companies to implement them. Out of the
400-500 fields on the UKCS, fewer than
100 have securities in place to cover
decommissioning plans.
Dymond told reporters the associa-

tion was also talking to government
about changing the tax treatment of decommissioning costs. Presently companies acquire letters of credit from banks
to show they are capable of handling
the liabilities. “This form of financial
security is problematic,” Dymond said,
pointing out that small companies find
it difficult to secure the letters, especial-

ly if they have only the one asset.
“Oil and Gas UK are suggesting a
sinking fund that companies could put
funds into, but this would need to have
a tax relief put up against it to make it
work,” he said. OGUK also is anxious
to have the threat of inheritance tax
removed from trust funds set up for
decommissioning. ✦

Putin resists
Caspian lines

W

estern leaders, mistrustful of
the intentions of Russia as a
supplier of energy, want to ensure
that other sources of oil and gas are
available. Much of that supply is being
sought in countries of the former
Soviet Union, and that makes the Russians nervous.
A sign of nervousness came last
week when Russian leader Vladimir
Putin met Iranian President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad and warned the West
not to pursue oil pipeline projects in,
around, and under the Caspian Sea that
are not backed by regional powers.
In fact, Putin warned that energy
pipeline projects crossing the Caspian
could be implemented only if all five
nations that border the Caspian support them. He even played the now
famous—or infamous—environmental
card.
“Projects that may inflict serious
environmental damage to the region
cannot be implemented without prior
discussion by all five Caspian nations,” said the Russian leader, whose
warnings underlined Moscow’s strong
opposition to efforts toward pipelines
to the West bypassing Russia.

The new pipeline is considered a
victory for Europe generally and East
European governments in particular,
who are increasingly weary of Russia’s
nationalistic energy policy and are
searching for alternative energy
sources and supply routes. It is no less
a victory for Caspian producers who
want to reach markets free of Russian
middlemen.
Other Caspian producers are
interested in similar pipeline projects, including Turkmenistan, which
last month conferred with Austria’s
Economic Minister Martin Bartenstein,
the UK’s Minister of State for Energy
Malcolm Wicks, and, to Putin’s chagrin, US Secretary of State Condoleeza
Rice.

Turkmenistan interested

Along the way, Turkmen President
Gurbanguli Berdymukhamedov said
his country, “having multiple vectors in its energy policy and creating
alternative export routes, including
in the southern direction through the
Caspian Sea, is prepared to deliver
natural gas to European countries.”
But Putin is fully prepared to oppose any such effort, as evidenced by

Pluto project
The approval for the Pluto project
comes with strict environmental conditions, including the reduction of any
impacts on threatened species, such as
the Olive Python, sea turtles, and other
marine mammals.
Woodside also will be required to
establish management plans to protect
the marine environment, including a
dredging and spoil management plan
prior to pipeline work, an oil spill contingency plan, and plans for offshore
drilling operations, construction, installation, and operations management.
The $11.2 billion (Aus.) Pluto
development includes installation of a
production platform in 85 m of water

subsea gas pipeline to shore, and construction of a 4.3 million tonne/year
LNG liquefaction plant, storage, and
wharf facilities at two separate sites on
the Burrup Peninsula.
The government said the Pluto development will inject $17.6 billion (Aus.)
into the national economy. About 28%
of the 3,000-person workforce will
live locally. There will be an additional
3,200 jobs during later operations.
Gas reserves are estimated to be 5 tcf,
including nearby Xena field, which will
be added in later development.
Currently Woodside holds 100%
interest, but the project is underpinned
by a package of LNG sales agreements
and equity with Tokyo Gas and Kansai
Electric of Japan, each of which will
take 5% equity in Pluto.
The field was found in 2005. Initial
onshore site works began earlier this
year, and first LNG production is expected in 2010.

• Development and implementation
of a protection regime for the Flatback
Turtle.
• Environmental management plans
for operation of the gas field and processing plant.
• Annual environmental performance reports for the Federal Department of the Environment and Water

Chevron also will implement 36
environmental protection measures imposed by Western Australia, which gave
its approval last month. Those measures
include a $60 million (Aus.) commitment to conserve the Flatback Turtle
and other endangered species and the
mandatory inclusion of carbon sequestration facilities.

Sequestration plans are already under way for reinjecting about 3 million
tonnes/year of carbon dioxide into a reservoir formation deep below Barrow Island.
Project operator Chevron said it will
incorporate all the detailed environmental conditions into its work plan.
Originally budgeted at $11 billion
(Aus.), the project likely will cost more
than $15 billion (Aus.). Sequestration costs for the first decade alone are
expected to be $850 million. Australia
will provide $60 million from its lowemissions technology fund towards the
geosequestration plan.
Australia expects Gorgon to contribute $20 billion (Aus.) to the country’s
economy and generate about 6,000
jobs over the project’s life.
There is continued speculation that
the Gorgon project at some point will
move to double its currently approved
design capacity of 10 million tonnes/

it substantially larger than the existing

Despite the environmental caveats
imposed on the current project, Greg
Bourne, head of the conservation group
WWF-Australia, expressed disappointment at the decision to locate Gorgon
facilities on Barrow Island rather than
on the mainland.
Although Chevron has a 40-year
track record managing the island’s
environment during development and
production from Barrow Island oil field,
Bourne says there are no conditions
that would ever make Barrow—one of
Australia’s oldest and most important
Class A nature reserves—an acceptable

The Central Utah thrust belt oil and

proponent with deep pockets.
Wolverine Gas & Oil Corp., Grand
Rapids, Mich., and its numerous partners in the 2004 Covenant oil and gas
field discovery in central Utah have
assigned major interests in the hingeline area to Oxy USA Inc., Houston, an
affiliate of Occidental Petroleum Corp.,

Austin independent eyes Paradox, Hingeline work
Royalite Petroleum Co. Inc., an Austin independent that owns 100% working interest in more than 67,000 acres
in Central Utah’s Hingeline trend, also
hopes to explore near recent gas-condensate discoveries in the northwestern
Paradox basin.
Royalite signed a letter of intent with
Twilight Resources LLC and affiliates to
acquire a 50% interest in 6,216 acres
east of Delta Petroleum Corp.’s Greentown State 36-11 discovery well in
Grand County. Consideration is $6.22
million.
Royalite, which becomes operator
if it completes the purchase by Dec. 1,
2007, said as many as 77 wells could
be drilled on the 6,216 acres. Royalite
would carry Twilight through the completion or plugging of two wells drilled
to the top of Mississippian or 11,000 ft,
whichever is less.

38

The proposed purchase is also subject to Royalite closing the previously
announced acquisition with Central
Utah Lease Acquisition LP by Nov. 19,
2007. That deal, for which Royalite is
attempting to raise funds, involves the
purchase of interests in 108,000 acres
in Juab and Sanpete counties north of
Covenant field.
The Central Utah deal if completed
would involve drilling two wells to
the top of Jurassic Navajo sandstone or
12,000 ft, whichever is less. Royalite
said the acreage contains Keystone, a
prospect in Sanpete County near the
axis of the 55-mile Wasatch monocline.
Keystone, which contains several fourway closed structures and-or combination fault trap structures, was defined
by surface geology, 200 line-miles of
reprocessed 2D seismic, gravity, and
aeromagnetic data, and 1,200 surface

soil geochemical samples.
Primary objectives are Jurassic Twin

and Dakota sandstones.

Delta said it hopes to ultimately
recover 2-4 tcf of gas net to its 70%
interest from Pennsylvanian Hermosa
Group clastics in Grand County south of
Green River, Utah, where it drilled the
Greentown State 36-11 and 32-42 wells
(OGJ Online, Mar. 2, 2007).
Royalite notes that Delta completed
the 36-11 well in two of 16 similar
clastic pay intervals and estimated
proved reserves in the two perforated
zones at 2.7 bcfe in this well. If the
untested intervals have similar log characteristics, as Delta reported, estimated
proved reserves at the well could exceed
10 bcfe, Royalite said.

Royalite said. Logs from nearby wells
also contain similar siltstone, sandstone,

81.25% net revenue interest to the
working interest owners.
Most of PetroSun’s Arizona holdings
are in the Holbrook basin.

Kentucky
Papua New Guinea
Austral Pacific Energy Ltd., Wellington, NZ, will appraise the remote
Stanley gas-condensate discovery in far
western Papua New Guinea.
The 1999 discovery well, 170 km
west-northwest of the Moran fields and
30 km east of the border with Indonesia’s Papua Province, went to TD 10,600
ft and encountered the Cretaceous Toro
formation at 10,300 ft. The untested
well cut 35 m of excellent quality Toro
reservoir with 13.5 m of gross gas pay
interpreted from wireline logs.
Austral Pacific operates PRL 4 with
28.92% interest. InterOil Corp. has
43.13%, and Horizon Oil Ltd. has
27.95%. The government extended the
license 5 years from August 2005.
Austral Pacific plans to shoot 43 km
of 2D seismic late this year to address
the field’s structural uncertainty and
locate an updip appraisal-development
well. It is negotiating with the OK Tedi
mine, which might buy gas to generate
electricity.

Peru
Test rates at Corvina field on Block
Z1 off northwestern Peru totaled 8,300
b/d of oil and 184 MMcfd of gas after
seven drillstem tests were conducted
at the third and most productive well,
CX11-14D, said BPZ Energy Inc., Houston.
The company plans to dually com40

plete the well and will spud the CX1118XD well.
CX11-14D is productive mostly from
the Lower Miocene Upper Zorritos formation, where six drillstem tests were
run. Two were in the oil zone and four
in the gas zone.
The 100 Mcfd gauged from the
Middle Miocene Cardalitos formation
was noncommercial in the offshore setting but encouraging enough “to keep
evaluating its potential in our onshore
blocks,” the company said.

Prince Edward Island
Corridor Resources Inc., Halifax, NS,
was to cement production casing to TD
3,403 m at the New Harmony-1 wildcat north of Souris on eastern Prince
Edward Island.
The well had gas shows in Carboniferous Bradelle sandstone at 3,7903,403 m, said PetroWorth Resources
Inc., Calgary.
Corridor believes that frac stimulation is needed due to low porosities,
and a decision won’t be made until it
has evaluated all the log and sidewall
core information.

Meridian Resource Corp., Houston,
has drilled two wells to evaluate gas
potential in Devonian New Albany shale
northwest of Corydon in Henderson
County, Ky., in the southern Illinois
basin.
The company, operator with 92%
working interest, plans to run a full log
suite and gather core samples for thorough geochemical analysis from the
Farms of Meadow Hills-1 well, drilled
to TD 4,600 ft. A second well, Keach-1,
is drilling at 3,900 ft.
The company owns 30,000 acres
in the general area, where other active
operators include El Paso Corp., Chesapeake Energy Corp., EOG Resources
Inc., Forest Oil Corp., Quicksilver
Resources Inc., and American Oil & Gas
Inc.

Washington

Exxel Energy Corp., Houston, became operator of the Brown 7-24 wildcat, TD 12,668 ft, and with the other
working interest owners will analyze
well data to determine future completion activities.

Oil prices remain

operators motivated and

despite depressed natural

gas prices. Worldwide
use of drilling rigs continued to increase 7% over levels 1 year
ago, particularly for land drilling in the
US, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific, and
offshore Middle East.
Higher oil prices and sweeping
nationalism, however, have prompted
some countries to seize industry operations or force contract renegotiations,
halting some planned drilling. Higher
prices also drive diversification, re-

search, and development of alternative
energy resources, as well as renewed
efforts at conservation and efficiency.
Analysts have been watching and
waiting as hundreds of newbuild land
rigs, dozens of jack ups, and a handful of semisubmersibles have entered
the market. There is lower utilization of
land rigs than marine rigs, and continuing tightness in the offshore rig market,
particularly
for floaters.

Argentina continues to drill with the
largest fleet of land rigs in Latin America, although this year it dropped to 73
rigs in July from a high of 87 in May,
according to Baker Hughes. Mexico was
running 68 land rigs in August, Venezuela was drilling with 62, and Colombia
with 41. Brazil used 18 land rigs in
August, Ecuador 11, Peru 5, Bolivia 3,
and Chile 2.
Brazil leads in offshore drilling, with
22 marine rigs, predominantly floaters, operating in August, followed by
Mexico 19 (predominantly jack ups),
Venezuela 16 (predominantly drilling
barges), Trinidad 4, and Peru 2.
44

Europe led with the largest percent
increase in rig use, with 82 rigs operating in August, up from 74 rigs in January (11% increase). Most land rigs were
in Germany and Yugoslavia (5 each); Italy (3); Hungary, Poland, and Romania
(2 each); and in other countries. The
UK led offshore drilling in August, with
28 rigs operating, followed by Norway
(20), Denmark and The Netherlands (3
each), and others.
A consortium led by Providence
Resources PLC is drilling five production wells off Ireland this year with the
Petrolia semisub, spending about $135

million on the busiest drilling program
off Ireland in decades.
Drilling in Asia-Pacific has increased
moderately to 241 rigs in August from
231 in January (4% increase). India led
land drilling, with 57 rigs; followed by
Indonesia with 39; Australia with 14;
Myanmar with 7; and New Zealand and
Papua New Guinea (3 each). India also
hosted the largest number of offshore
rigs (23), closely followed by Indonesia
(21), China (19), Malaysia (17), Australia (12), Vietnam (8), Thailand (5),
and others.

There were five rigs
working off Nigeria,
four off Angola, and
single rigs off South
Africa, Tunisia, and
other countries (Fig.

The North
American rig count
reached an historic
high of 2,371 rigs
in February 2007,
up 5.4% from 2,248
rigs/year earlier (Fig.
2). The seasonally
cyclic trend is driven
by Canadian operations, but drilling is
down in Canada, and
the increase in rig
numbers is driven by
US operations.

For the week ending Sept.
21, 2007, the Baker Hughes
rig count listed 1,684 land
rigs drilling in the US (Table
3). There were also 60 rigs
drilling off Alabama, California, Louisiana, and Texas, in
addition to 25 rigs drilling
in Louisiana’s inland waters.
Baker Hughes rig counts
only include rigs that are
“turning to the right,” and
so the count is conservative.
BHI does not include all rigs
under contract, in transit,
testing, rigging up, or rigging down.

Newbuilds, offshore
About 140 new MODUs
are under currently under
construction worldwide
(Table 4), including 72 jack ups, 43
semisubs, 19 drillships, 3 tenders, and
at least 3 drilling barges. These 140 new
rigs, to be delivered 2007-11, will increase the existing fleet of 782 MODUs
by 18%, to 922 rigs (OGJ, Sept. 24,
2007, p. 41).
Contracts for additional newbuilds
are announced almost weekly.
Simmons & Co. International analyst
Ian Macpherson said that despite the
additions, day rates in all but shallow-water Gulf of Mexico will remain
steady and even “bleed higher” in the
near future.1
The coming year will be decisive, he
said, when more than half of the newbuilds are delivered.

M&A, IPO
The merger of Norway’s Statoil ASA
and Norsk Hydro ASA’s petroleum
businesses was finalized Oct. 1. Some
service companies wonder how this
will affect competitive bidding for work
on the Norwegian shelf.

Looking ahead
Onshore, there will probably be an
increased use of horizontal drilling to
optimize shale and coal gas production. Due to the increasing demand for
stimulation technology, more effort will
probably be invested in research and
development, particularly for hydraulic
fracturing.
Offshore, there’s a need to develop
light well intervention (LWI) techniques and dynamically positioned
vessels for subsea workovers—especially on the Norwegian continental
shelf. Deepwater drilling vessels are
too expensive to provide frequent well
maintenance and optimize production.
Earlier this year, Expro International announced it was working with operators
to develop a rigless subsea intervention
system.
BJ Tubular Services has been running
a rigless intervention system in the Gulf
of Mexico to decommission platforms
since 2003. It operates like a modular
miniderrick, with a mast 76 ft tall.
Service companies will probably
bring forward similar systems in the
near future. ✦

PSAC based its July forecast on crude

$7.75 (Can.)/Mcf (AECO).

Drilling contractors
According to Precision Drilling
Trust’s second-quarter report, the
company “experienced some of its
lowest activity and equipment utilization levels in a decade.” In addition to
being seasonally soft, record rainfall and
low gas prices in the second quarter led
to a downturn in drilling activity after
spring breakup. Precision’s contract
drilling in the Western Canada Sedimentary basin was 54% lower than during second-quarter 2006.
Coinciding with a record level of
drilling rig capacity (too many newbuilds?), Precision said this led to
“competitive spot market pricing.” The
company had 13 rigs under construction at the end of the second quarter,
7 destined for Canada and 6 for the US
(all supersingles). The company’s North
American fleet will reach 259 drilling
rigs by second-quarter 2008.
Precision is building a new employee training center in Nisku, Alta.,
that will include a decommissioned
drilling rig.
Akita Drilling Ltd. operates 42 drilling rigs, 39 in Canada and 3 in Alaska,
as well as 3 well-service rigs in Canada.
In the first 6 months of 2007, the
company drilled 487 wells in Canada
and 3 in Alaska. Akita added two heavy
oil pad-drilling rigs to its fleet in second quarter, and one began operating
immediately under a multiyear term
contract. Management says the drop in
demand has adversely affected shallow,
deep, and northern rig types, but there
has been minimal effect on mediumdepth rigs and heavy oil pad rigs.

The lower 2007 figure may be attributed to Canadian gas prices, which
are not keeping pace with the rise in oil
prices. There is no energy parity; gas is
now trading at a substantial discount to
oil in terms of its energy value.

lion bbl oil, with 713 million bbl oil
remaining. The Hibernia field was shut
down from September 2006 to February 2007 because of a backfire in the
turbine exhaust unit on one of the main
power generators.
About 97% of the gas produced at
Hibernia was used for fuel or oil recovery in 2006; only 3% (2,424 MMscfd)
was flared. Hibernia uses a cuttings
reinjection system and successfully
reinjected 100% of all SBM cuttings in
2006.
• Terra Nova. The field lies 350
km east-southeast of St. John’s where
the Henry Goodich semisubmersible had drilled 32 wells through the
end of March for Petro-Canada and its
partners. After completion of another
well in May, the 28 drilling slots were
fully utilized. Drilling at Terra Nova will
resume in 2011 when additional drilling slots become available, according to
C-NLOPB.
About 78% of the gas produced at

Terra Nova was used for fuel or oil
recovery in 2006; 22% (84.9 million cu
m) was flared.
• White Rose. The field is about
350 km east of St. John’s and produced
32 million bbl oil in 2006 from six
production wells, about 87,800 bo/d.
Husky Oil has initiated drilling operations on 19 wells; 16 of which have
been drilled to TD and 15 completed.
In 2006, Husky drilled two delineation
wells in the field with the GSF Grand
Banks second-generation semisubmersible.
About 39% of the gas produced at
White Rose was flared in 2006 (270
million cu m). C-NLOPB attributes
the high percentage to the typically
high rates seen at the beginning of oil
production. Gas injection into the field
began May 5, 2006.
On Sept. 7, 2007, C-NLOPB approved Husky Energy’s South White
Rose extension. The South White Rose
extension is estimated to contain 24

million bbl of oil and is one of several
possible extensions to the White Rose
project.
According to the C-NLOPB annual
report, operators produced a total of
111 million bbl oil in 2006, valued at
more than $8.2 billion (Can.), representing 12.6% of Newfoundland and
Labrador’s gross domestic product.
The industry spends about $1.3 billion
(Can.) a year across Canada, 55% of it
in Newfoundland and Labrador. As of
Mar. 16, 2007, operators were committed to spend an additional $816 million
(Can.) on future exploration activities.
During 1966-2006, operators spent
nearly $21.6 billion (Can.) on offshore
petroleum exploration, development,
and production in the province. About
half, $10.7 billion, has gone towards
development activities.

Special Report

Xtreme has five different models
of CT drilling rigs. The two smallest,
XTC 200ST and 200DT, can drill to
about 7,900 ft. The XTC 400 can drill
to 10,000 ft with 31⁄2-in. coiled tubing
or to 14,000 ft with jointed drill pipe
(Fig. 4).
As of June 30, the company had 11
rigs under construction and expected to
complete 14 rigs by yearend. The fleet
will include 10 rigs by the end of third
quarter and expects to run 18 COTD
rigs in 2008.
Xtreme is also engaged in a joint
venture, Coil-X Drilling Systems Corp.,
with Shell Technology Ventures Fund 1
BV.

Successfully exploring and exploiting
the technology-intensive Beaufort will
probably depend on the growth of the
Mackenzie delta gas project and construction of the Mackenzie gas pipeline.

The oil sands of Alberta are undergoing an investment boom worth more than
$100 billion. From 2007 to 2016, the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board
(EUB) projects total real investment in Alberta’s oil sands (surface mining,
upgrading, in situ, and support services to reach Canadian $118 billion.
Output from oil sands is set to rise from about 1.2 million barrels a day to
an expected 3 million b/d by 2016, and perhaps 4 million plus by 2020.
That could make Canada the world’s fourth-biggest oil producer after Saudi
Arabia, Russia and the United States.
Today’s oil pricing levels have made extraction of oil from oil sands much
more attractive than in the past. The reserves in Alberta will support
production for a least the next century. Canada is the new frontier in nonOPEC oil developments.
Don’t miss this opportunity to present your expertise to a powerful, inﬂuential
audience. Join PennWell Petroleum Events in this second year conference and
exhibition. As the boom continues, share your ideas, experiences, technology,
and expertise with major industry players who must react quickly to the rapid
expansion. Plan to present a technical paper at the the second annual Oil Sands
and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition, July 15 – 17, 2008, at
the Calgary TELUS Convention Centre in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

BTX: PROBLEM AND
SOLUTION—1

As have other operators with lean feed acid
gas containing benzene,
toluene, and xylene
(BTX), Saudi Aramco
Gas Processing
has dealt for years with
chronic Claus catalyst
deactivation, low sulfur recovery, and
frequent shutdowns to replace catalyst.
After a process selection study identified the most cost
effective solution
to the problem,
the company installed regenerable
activated-carbon
beds upstream of
the sulfur-recovery units (SRUs) to remove aromatic
contaminants before they reach the
converter beds. Saudi Aramco completed construction of seven BTX-removal
units to treat acid feeding downstream
sulfur plants in December 2005. Commissioning took place in spring 2006.
Part I of this two-part series discusses the history of the BTX problem
and how it was eventually addressed. A
process description provides an understanding of the steps in the cyclic
regeneration process. The concluding
article will discuss design issues and
start-up and commissioning experience for the units, their performance,
and impact on the downstream Claus
catalyst.

Selecting an amine to treat sour associated gas to a 1⁄4 grain H2S/100 std.
cu ft pipeline specification was one of
many design goals. It’s easy to forget
sometimes how far the gas processing
industry has come in the last 30 years
in terms of understanding the capabilities and limitations of various amines.
At that time, process simulators were in
their infancy and the extensive database
of thermodynamic and kinetic properties for many amines used today did not
exist.
The selection process that led to
choosing Diglycolamine (DGA) is
described by Huval and van de Venne
(OGJ, Aug. 17, 1981, p. 93). Their article mentions a concern that DGA would
be prone to coabsorption of heavy hydrocarbons, which could lead to poor
sulfur product quality. It also describes
how fuel-gas spargers were installed
in the bottom of the rich-amine flash
drum to mitigate this. Because of its
other advantages, though, primarily the
ability to treat sour gas at high temperatures, it was selected for the Master Gas
System.
Because DGA removes essentially all
H2S and CO2 from treated gas, the H2S:
CO2 ratio in acid gas is determined by
the ratio of these components in the
sour gas. At Saudi Aramco’s Shedgum
and Uthmaniyah gas plants, this results

costly than the carbon-bed process.
Following are the reasons for each
being discarded:
Oxygen enrichment does not provide a hot enough flame temperature.
For the very lean feed in the design
basis, even at 100% O2 enrichment with
all acid gas going to the reaction furnace, the calculated flame temperature
is barely enough to maintain a stable
flame, let alone destroy BTX. Fuel gas
cofiring would require so much fuel
gas that it would have doubled the SRU
pressure drop.
Refrigerating the feed to condense
out heavy hydrocarbons would be
prohibitively costly in a location where
all heat rejection is ultimately to the
atmosphere with a 120° F. design ambient temperature.
Use of molecular sieve was actually
considered after the fact; that is, after
the carbon-bed process was chosen.
Carbon is a better adsorbent in that it
has a higher capacity for BTX than sieve

and perhaps more importantly it can be
regenerated with low-pressure steam,
whereas sieve requires a fired heater to
raise the temperature of the regeneration medium.
Fuel-gas stripping the rich amine
and acid-gas enrichment were evaluated in detail. For the stripping process,
it was proposed to route the fuel gas
to the site’s utility boilers. This set an
upper bound on the stripping fuel gasto-amine circulation rate ratio.
For these conditions, the amount
of xylene that could be removed was
much less than could be achieved with
either carbon adsorption or acid-gas
enrichment. It had been established that
xylene is by far the most destructive
of the aromatics in our acid gas.1 As a
result, fuel gas stripping was pursued
no further.
It was found that removal of BTX
from acid gas by regenerable activated
carbon was, by a very wide margin,
far less costly than the only technically

viable alternative process, acid-gas enrichment. The results of our study were
presented in 2002.2 In the course of the
study we dispelled two misconceptions
that were generally held within the gas
processing community and by ourselves
up until then.
The first has to do with the idea that
DGA would co-absorb significantly
more heavy hydrocarbons than other
commonly used amines because of the
di-glycol component of the molecule.
While this may be directionally true,
the importance of the effect has been
overstated. In reality water in a DGA
solution is responsible for picking up a
large proportion of the aromatics from
sour gas.
This seems counter intuitive at
first until one realizes that on a molar
basis, water makes up about 85% of
the circulating solvent. Since solubility
is a molecular phenomenon, it stands
to reason that pickup of BTX in the
absorbers would depend on the ratio of

moles of water to amine in contact with
the gas being treated.
Of course, pressure plays an important role as well. When Khuff gas treating at high pressure began in the early
1990s at Shedgum, the SRU receiving
acid gas generated from high-pressure
treating suffered even more rapid catalyst deactivation.
Because Henry’s law applies, treating at high pressure transfers more
BTX than at low pressure. This is not to
suggest that there are not other factors
involved. For example, we have observed that increasing acid-gas loading
decreases BTX pickup.
The point remains, however, that the
concern regarding DGA relative to other
amines misses the essential fact that
water, because its molar concentration,
contributes significantly to the pickups
of aromatics and heavy hydrocarbons in
any amine treating process.
The second is related to the attempt
to mitigate the concern regarding DGA
solution coabsorption of BTX by installing fuel-gas spargers in the rich-amine
flash drum (OGJ, Aug. 17, 1981, p.
93). The concept was that this would
perform a physical striping of heavier
hydrocarbons from the rich solution.
We reported in 2002 that even using
64

a very high fuel-gas striping rate (relative to amine circulation) and a multistage tower would not be sufficient to
cut net aromatics transfer by the order
of magnitude necessary to eliminate
BTX induced deactivation.2 Hoping to
achieve this in the single stage provided
by the rich amine flash drum, although
directionally valid, was unrealistic.
Thus in 2001 Saudi Aramco undertook to construct seven BTX-removal
units upstream of the SRUs with reaction furnace bypasses at Shedgum and
Uthmaniyah. There were some further
internal reviews and admittedly tough
discussions as we proceeded. After all,
nowhere else in the world had the
process ever been implemented on the
massive scale being contemplated.
Nonetheless over the next 5 years,
the project evolved through initial
scoping, preliminary and detailed
design, procurement, construction, and
commissioning, culminating in startup
during first-quarter 2006.
As the project scope was being
defined, the design basis was modified
somewhat from what was presented in
2002. The changes reflected the latest
projections for capacity needs and BTX
content of the acid gas. The carbon
units were designed for the following

Fig. 2 shows a schematic of the
process. Acid gas from the gas-treating units is cooled in a scrubber with
chilled circulating water. From there
it goes to an adjacent knockout drum
where free liquid disengagement takes
place (not shown).
The carbon-bed unit (CBU) is fitted
with a bypass so that it can be taken
offline and the SRU left in service. During normal operation, acid gas from
the knockout drum goes to a preheater.
Adsorption of aromatics on carbon is
favored at low temperature. There is
a competing effect, however: At high
relative humidity, water tends to adsorb
preferentially to BTX.
The shell and U-tube exchanger uses
low-pressure steam to heat the acid gas
before going to the carbon-bed vessels.
The amount of preheat is set so as to
bring the relative humidity of the acid
gas to around 50%. This corresponds to
a ∆T of about 20-25° F. between winter
and summer conditions.
The CBUs were designed with a
three-bed configuration with two
vessels online at any time with one in
regeneration or standby. Removal of
BTX using activated carbon is similar
in many respects to molecular-sieve
dehydration: Both are governed by the
fundamental principles of adsorption.
For BTX removal, adsorption takes
place with acid gas in upward flow.
Regeneration is performed with downward flow of steam, which eliminates
the possibility of steam condensing and
refluxing on the bed if the opposite
flow regime were used. Acid gas passing
through the two carbon beds online is
stripped of aromatic contaminants and
flows to the fired acid-gas preheater upstream of the SRU. The CBUs were built
for full stream treatment of acid gas, not
just the reaction furnace bypass.
Carbon has a finite capacity to hold
hydrocarbons. When the bed is online

(adsorption mode) the mass-transfer
zone (MTZ) moves from the bottom to
the top of the bed. Behind (below) the
MTZ, the carbon is saturated to capacity
with BTX. Ahead of the MTZ the bed is
essentially free of adsorbed aromatics.
Eventually the bed becomes fully
loaded with hydrocarbons as the MTZ
reaches the top of the bed. Before this
happens the bed is taken out of service
and regenerated with low-pressure
steam. When a bed is taken off line it
is replaced in service with a previously
regenerated bed.
During regeneration, steam is introduced under flow control to the top
of the bed through a distributor. The
regeneration pressure is maintained by
a backpressure controller on a common line connecting the beds. After
the pressure-control valve, steam and
desorbed aromatics are condensed in an
air-cooled fin-fan heat exchanger.
From there a three-phase mixture of
regeneration steam condensate, hydrocarbon liquids, and some noncondensables goes to the pressure-control drum.
Liquids flow by gravity to a three-phase
separator below.
As its name implies, the pressurecontrol drum serves to maintain a net
positive pressure in the three-phase
separator despite the vacuum that is
naturally formed when regeneration
steam is condensed in the fin-fan cooler.
This is achieved with a split-range pressure controller that vents noncondensables to the acid-gas flare header as they
build up at the start of regeneration and
a fuel-gas supply that pressurizes the
vessel when condensing steam would
otherwise pull a vacuum.
The amount of noncondensables
and hydrocarbon liquids coming to the
pressure-control drum varies throughout the course of the regeneration step.
Initially there is a physical displacement
of trapped acid gas in the vessel that is
isolated at the end of the adsorption
step.
As the bed is heated to the regeneration temperature, hydrocarbons begin
to desorb from the bed, reaching a
maximum which then trails off like the

elution peak of a chromatogram. The
three-phase separator has water and
hydrocarbon compartments that are
pumped out under level control.
Water is sent to a new waste water
stripper designed to treat produced
regeneration steam condensate to
boiler-feed-water quality. BTX from the
three-phase separator is injected into
crude oil. The amount of aromatics

produced is insignificant compared to
oil production and has no measurable
effect on the latter.
One final point regarding the regeneration step is to explain the function of
condensate collection drum that comes
into play in the initial stages of this step.
Adsorption takes place at temperatures
that range 80-140° F. winter to summer. Regeneration back pressure can

range of around 260-300° F. (Note that
the superheat in letting down lowpressure steam from about 65 psi to

When steam is first introduced to the
carbon-bed vessel, it will condense as
the bed, vessel, and internals are heated
to the regeneration temperature. This
condensate is removed from a center
nozzle at the bottom of the vessel.
From there it flows by gravity to a
small condensate-collection vessel. At a
preset level, the condensate is expelled
through a filter to remove carbon fines.
From there it joins the main regeneration-steam line, downstream of the

A new model has
increased the efficiency
and safety of air-exhaust
procedures in the commissioning of liquids
pipelines in hilly terrain.
Pipelines
Air accumulated in a
pipeline during commissioning can damage it and make interface tracking in batch transportation
difficult, requiring the air’s
efficient discharge. Such
accumulation frequently
occurs in long-slope pipe
segments in hilly terrain,
increasing the importance
of determining the size and
location of any air pockets
in these settings.
In traditional commissioning procedures, determining the location of
the air mass and the time of its exhaust
relied on the use of pressure devices: If
air intake occurred, the entire transport
line would shutdown and exhaust the
air at the pipeline’s peaks. This method
of air exhaust was passive and time
consuming and led to greater quantities
of contaminated product.
This article applies both fluid mechanics theory and multiphase flow

theory to analyze the formation and
movement of intake air encountered
during commissioning of the China
West Products Pipeline. It presents
equations for calculating the location
and length of intake air in the pipeline in an effort to provide theoretical
support for accurately determining air
exhaust in the commissioning of future
hilly terrain pipelines.
The resulting model allows air mass
pressure, length, and location to be
calculated under normal transportation
conditions for other pipelines. The calculation results show a certain distance
between where air stagnates and the
pipeline’s next peak. Using the model
in practical applications can move the
air to the predesigned air exhaust points
by regulating liquid flow rate and pressure.

CWPP commissioning
The number of pipelines in China
has increased rapidly in recent years.
These pipelines are typically large diameter, high pressure, and high throughput, with the majority built in hilly
areas. CWPP is one of the longest and
most complex.
CWPP consists of both the China

of slack region, f0 is the liquid friction
factor of tight line flow, z is height, x is
mileage, and v0 is the velocity of tight
line flow (Equation 2). The numerator on the right hand is the elevation
gradient in the slack region, equal to
the head gradient in the slack region.
The denominator of the right hand side
is the tight line head gradient.
Since the friction factor does not
change rapidly with velocity for most
pipeline flow rates, f/f0 = 1. According
to Equation 2, β is only correlated to
the pipe downward inclination angle, θ,
and tight line flow velocity, v0.

Taitel presented equilibrium
equations for both liquid and
air phase (Equations 4 and
5),4 where shear stresses τg,
τi, and τl can be expressed as
Equation 6.
In these equations g is
acceleration of gravity, ρ is
density, p is pressure, and
v is velocity. Subscripts g, l,
and i refer to the air, liquid,
and interface, respectively. A
constant value, fi = 0.0142,
provides the interfacial airliquid shear stress, τi.5 Equa100
tion 7 approximates liquid
shear stress’s, τl, friction factor, fl. The Colebrook-White
Formula recommended by
Xiao6 can calculate turbulent
flow’s fl.
Where e is the absolute surface roughness of
the pipe inner wall, Rel =
ρlυlDl/μl, with Dl = 4Al/sl, and μl as
liquid dynamic viscosity, can define
liquid Reynolds Number Rel. The tiny
air velocity causes air shear stress, τi, to
tend to zero.
Equation 4 allows both the shear
stress and the gravity force of air to be
neglected because of their tiny values. Equation 8 can therefore express
Equations 4 and 5. Substituting Equations 1, 6, and 7 into Equation 8 yields

Two unknown quantities exist in
Equations 9 and 10: air length, L, and
semicenter angle, β. One more equation
will close the equations, making them
solvable. Equation 11 is a simplification
of Equation 4. Integrating Equation 11
yields a linear pressure drop expression,
Equation 12, where ∆p is the pressure
drop at the two-phase flow region. The

sure drop from that seen in tight line
flow (Fig. 8).
Equation 13 closes the equations,
where ∆p' is the pressure drop on tight
line flow condition, Pt' is the calculating
pressure of downstream on tight line
flow condition, and Pt is the practical
pressure of downstream. Substituting
Equations 1, 6, and 7 into Equation
13 yields Equation 14, in which pli is
the pressure drop per unit pipe length.
Combining Equations 9 and 14 solves

Figuring the air mass length and
void fraction lets Equation 10 calculate
the air mass average density, ρag. Equation 15, the state of gas equation, in
which T is absolute temperature and
R is the gas constant, yields the air
mass average pressure, Pag. Fig. 8 shows
discovering the pressure of the air mass
head, Ps, can directly disclose the location of the air mass. Equation 16 shows
the correlation between Pag and Ps.
Substituting Equations 6 and 12 into
Equation 16 yields Equation 17.
Fig. 8 shows the uniqueness of the
pressure at each point on a downward
inclined segment. The point of air mass
head occurs at the two-phase flow, and
the pressure before this point can be
calculated as a tight line flow condition.
Obtaining the pressure of the air mass
head yields the location of the air mass
by comparing it with the pressure of a
tight line flow condition.

results of subsequent calculation.
The two segment calculations show
the air mass sealed in the pipe depends
on pipe diameter, liquid flow rate,
downward inclined pipe length, and
inclination angle. Increasing pressure
compressed the length of air by about
50% and also led to changes to the void
fraction, which balanced the pressure
difference from interfacial friction. The
results confirm the air will not stagnate
at the peak but will at certain other
determinable points during normal
transport conditions. ✦

New 120-ton power swivel for ﬁshing, workovers
This new hydraulic, motor-driven, 120ton power swivel with offshore package
promises smooth, accurately controlled,
shock-free rotary power that is suited for
fishing and workover operations.
It handles internal or external cutting
of tubing, casing, or drill pipe; drilling
out plugs, packers, or cement; milling
operations; or scraping casing—whenever
shock-free, controlled torque is essential to
eliminating the potential danger of twistoffs or damage to cutting tools, the firm
points out.
In addition to oil and gas wells, it is
also suited for light to medium drilling
applications including water wells and pilings for piers and foundations. Suspending
the swivel from a boom or crane eliminates a great deal of setup time or shifts to
additional locations. The swivel is also can
be used for coring operations. Any length
of core may be taken. Accurate, smooth
torque ensures against damage to core
tools or strings, the firm says.

The skid-mounted unit is made of
heavy-duty structural tubing with
welded construction.
To meet increased
environmental
safety regulations,
it is equipped with
a containment lip
to eliminate fluid
spills. Both ends are
rounded for easy
skidding. The lifting
frame may be used
to attach boom lines
or hoist slings. The lifting frame is flush
with the sides of the skid. Main runners, running the length of the skid, are
strengthened by cross-members for additional rigidity. The frame is covered with
a polyurea coating for corrosion resistance
and has a diamond-patterned deck plate to
provide a solid, skid resistant floor.
The swivel incorporates improve-

ments such as interchangeable parts in
key areas for economy and easy service.
The compact, lightweight swivel-head
design weighs 2,000 lb and fits a variety
of drilling or workover masts. The design
incorporates a reliable, custom-built drive
train with hardened steel gears.

Condensate coming into its own
Condensate, one of the two groups
deﬁned as Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs),
is ﬁnally coming of age in world trade,
marketing, reﬁning and petrochemicals. Condensate sales are moving
from a niche marketing specialty to
a mainstream segment of crude and
products trade, and nowhere is this
more evident than in the Mideast Gulf
and Asia Paciﬁc.
This report explains how the protean
nature of condensate allows it to be
used in a wide range of sectors: as a
reﬁnery slate component; in specialized distillation towers called condensate splitters; in direct feed to ethylene crackers; in gasoline blending and
as a substitute for gas in turbine power generation. It can be deﬁned as a
base material, a blending component,
a feedstock or a boiler feed.

CGES: Saudis
cut output to
lift crude price
Saudi Arabia has been limiting production to raise oil prices while blaming the
effects on speculation and US reﬁning
problems, a London think-tank says.
“Saudi Arabia has been hugely successful in its attempt to raise oil prices,” reports
the Centre for Global Energy Studies
(CGES) in its September-October Market
Watch. “For the kingdom to claim that high
oil prices are largely due to speculation or

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s

reﬁning problems is disingenuous.”
In the ﬁrst quarter of 2006, the group estimates, Saudi Arabia produced more than
9.5 million b/d of crude, above the quota
assigned it by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The OPEC basket
crude price at the time was $58/bbl.
Apparently, that wasn’t high enough.
The kingdom autonomously trimmed
production by 360,000 b/d in April 2006 and
by 150,000 b/d in May. By the following
October, Saudi production had fallen by
640,000 b/d.
The OPEC basket price jumped to
almost $70/bbl in July-August 2006. After
OPEC announced production cuts late in
2006 and early in 2007, Saudi Arabia further
trimmed output from 8.89 million b/d in
November 2006 to a low of 8.53 million b/d
the next April.
“There can be but one explanation,”
CGES says. “Saudi Arabia was determined
to get the OPEC basket price back up above
$60/bbl, which was achieved in April this
year, and the price has not dropped below
this threshold ever since.”
To effect the output cuts, the kingdom
lowered the discount offered on its heavy
crude. The differential on Saudi Heavy
bound for the US Gulf Coast fell from $14/
bbl in January 2006 to a low of $6/bbl last
May, CGES says. The shrunken discount
against benchmark crude discouraged purchases of the low-quality oil.
Since May, the discount has risen to $10/
bbl, and Saudi production has increased by
an estimated 280,000 b/d.
CGES thinks Saudi Arabia didn’t expect
the OPEC basket price to climb, as it did,
above $75/bbl.
“That the oil price rose so high attests
to the dangers inherent in manipulating
output to bring about what are intended to
be relatively modest changes in the price of
oil,” it says.

NOAA: La Nina signals moderate winter
The US National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) forecasts this
winter will be 2.8% warmer than the 30-year norm for the US in December through
February but still 1.3% cooler than last year.
“La Nina is here, with a weak-to-moderate event likely to persist through the
winter,” said Michael Halpert, head of forecast operations and acting deputy director
of NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center.
The Societe Generale Group in Paris said, “This means temperatures start off
colder in December but warm up towards February. While the winter is likely to be
milder than average, NOAA warned that we should expect bouts of winter weather
which should add to volatility.”
Halpert said Oct. 9, “The big concern this winter may be the persistence of
drought across large parts of the already parched South. And while December
through February is likely to be another milder-than-average winter for much of the
country, people should still expect some bouts of winter weather.”
Above-average temperatures are projected for the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic
states as a result of a long-term warming trend. “Snowfall for the region will depend
on other climate factors, which are difﬁcult to anticipate more than 1-2 weeks in
advance,” NOAA ofﬁcials said.
The drought-plagued Southeast is likely to remain drier than average, with aboveaverage temperatures. Temperatures and precipitation should be above average in
the Great Lakes and Tennessee Valley. The south-central plains also are expected to
be warmer and drier than normal, with above-average temperatures in the central
plains. However, NOAA ofﬁcials said, “The northern plains has equal chances of
above, near, or below-average temperature and precipitation. In the Northwest, there
are equal chances for above, near, or below-average temperatures. Precipitation
should be above average in much of the region due to La Nina.”
Drought and above-average temperatures are expected to persist in the Southwest due to La Nina, ofﬁcials said. Northern Alaska is expected to be milder than
average, while the rest of Alaska has equal chances for either above or below-average temperatures and precipitation. In Hawaii, temperatures and precipitation are
expected to be above average.
NOAA and other scientists base this forecast on studies of long-term climate
trends and a variety of forecast tools from statistical techniques to extremely complex dynamic ocean-atmosphere coupled models and composites. The outlook will
be updated Nov. 15.
In the interim, Societe Generale analysts report indications of price strength for
the US gas market. “Canadian imports are down at 8.8 bcfd, which is below the
30-day average of 9.1 bcfd. LNG is at 700-800 MMcfd with sendouts over the past
weekend dropping to 600 MMcfd. Strong global prices provide an incentive to ship
elsewhere from the US,” they reported Oct. 15. “US production was also off 3 bcf for
the [latest] week, attributed to reduced supply moving out of western areas,” said
Societe Generale. EIA reported the injection of 73 bcf of gas into US underground
storage in the week ended Oct. 5. That put gas in US storage at 3.336 tcf, 44 bcf less
than a year ago and 237 bcf above the 5-year average.
As for market volatility, Societe Generale said, “Prices rose last week, but volatility dropped. Currently, volatility is 56.55%, about 2% higher than the 1-year forecast.
In late September we witnessed annualized volatility levels of 71.25%, and we are
experiencing considerably lower than levels witnessed in mid-August (92%).”
Record oil price
Robert S. Morris, Banc of America Securities LLC, New York, said, “Apart from
some further intervention by Mother Nature, we believe it is more likely that there
is further downside rather than upside to near-term natural gas prices. Oil prices, on
the other hand, seem to have gained momentum leading up to winter and continue
to underpin the strength in energy shares, and we believe that the E&P sector will
continue to move in whatever direction commodity prices, particularly oil, move
near term.”
The front-month crude contract climbed above $84/bbl for the ﬁrst time ever in
intraday trading Oct. 12 on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid escalation of
political tension in the Middle East. In early-morning electronic trading Oct. 15, crude
jumped above $85/bbl after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries raised
its forecast for oil demand in the fourth quarter by 100,000 b/d. Concerns about a supply interruption also boosted prices due to tensions between Turkey and Iraq.
“Global oil demand has held up very well in the face of record oil prices in the second half of 2007, and we believe that concerns of price-driven demand destruction are
overblown,” said analysts with Raymond James & Associates Inc. in Houston.

WELCOME

Welcome to Offshore West Africa 2008
As Chairman of the OWA Advisory Board, it is my pleasure to invite you to attend the 2008 Offshore West Africa
Conference and Exhibition in Abuja, Nigeria.
The theme of this year’s conference - “The Gulf of Guinea: Sustaining the Momentum of World Class Resource
Development” – summarizes the challenge facing companies operating offshore West Africa.
As most of you know, improved oil and gas prices have stimulated industry activity, but at the same time have
been accompanied by significant increases in the cost of equipment and services. The industry also is faced with an
inadequate supply of trained and experienced personnel in virtually every facet of operation. Meanwhile, the search
for hydrocarbons is moving into more hostile environments and greater water depths.
More than ever, the offshore industry in West Africa must rely on innovation in technology to unlock deepwater
assets. New and improved technology must provide the capabilities to succeed in the face of these challenging
circumstances.
The mission of OWA is to provide an annual forum that addresses those exact needs -- the technical, environmental
and business challenges associated with oil and gas exploration and production offshore West Africa. The conference

www.offshorewestafrica.com EXHIBITOR INFORMATION
Exhibition Information
Now in its 12th year, Offshore West Africa is the only established conference and exhibition dedicated to serving the needs of the offshore
oil and gas sector in the region.The exploration and production industry is booming in West Africa, in particular among the major producing
countries such as Nigeria and OPEC’s newest member, Angola.
Large reserves of both oil and gas, and the move to increase reserves to 40 billion and daily production output to 4 million barrels by 2010,
driven by the state owned oil company, Nigeria National Petroleum Company (NNPC) in conjunction with international oil companies
such as Shell, ExxonMobil, Chevron, Total and Agip will ensure that the Nigeria oil and gas E&P market will be growing for the foreseeable
future. Nigeria supplies 3% of the world’s gas and has the capacity to produce much more.
By 2025 Nigeria will have the 20th largest economy in the world (Goldman Sachs)
In the wider region, recent ultra deepwater discoveries off Angola by BP Exploration, Sonangol and Total and further exploration off
Equatorial Guinea will ensure plenty of activity offshore West Africa for the next few years. Investment in oil and gas continues to increase
in order to help the world meet future demands and all of the offshore west African oil producing countries such as Nigeria, Angola, Gabon,
Congo, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Ivory Coast and Ghana will all reap the benefits to their respective economies in the coming years.
Offshore West Africa offers oil companies, their partners and all suppliers to the offshore industry a unique platform to showcase their
products and services.

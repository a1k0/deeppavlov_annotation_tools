Interior orders mineral reforms after report
US Interior Secretary Dirk A. Kempthorne, after receiving the
final report of an independent study panel on Jan. 25, ordered immediate implementation of recommended mineral management
reforms that can be carried out administratively.
The report, having more than 100 recommendations, came
from a bipartisan panel the secretary formed last year that was cochaired by former US Sens. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) and Jake Garn
(R-Utah). “Where it is within our power to do so, the responsible
officials will take action to rectify identified problems. However,
other recommendations may require further study or legislative
action,” Kempthorne said.
His directive to Minerals Management Service Director Randall
B. Luthi and Bureau of Land Management Director James L. Caswell
also orders the two agencies to develop action plans based on the
report’s recommendations and to submit a progress report within
30 days. The recommendations, to be implemented immediately,
include additional ethics training for all MMS employees, especially those who deal with oil, gas, and other lessees in a regulatory,
collections, or enforcement role.
MMS also is upgrading its communication and coordination
to ensure the accuracy of lease and royalties collections, Interior
said. It indicated that the agency also recently issued an Indian Oil
Valuation Rule to provide added certainty to the valuation of oil
produced from American Indian lands, a key issue that the study
panel identified.
Kempthorne said some of the panel’s recommendations need
further exploration through consultations with state and Indian
tribal officials and, in some cases, industry organizations before
they can be adequately implemented.

Nigeria, Portugal hold gas development talks
Portugal has joined Russia, China, and India in seeking to cooperate with Nigeria in tapping into that African country’s gas potential as it seeks to ramp up domestic gas utilization as a priority and
develop export projects.
Following a meeting of Nigeria’s Gas Minister Odusina Olatunde Emmanuel and Portugal Ambassador Maria De Fatima Perestrello, Emmanuel said there was sufficient gas in the country to
meet both commitments, and gas for power generation is high on
its agenda.

Exploration

&

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Perestrello assured Emmanuel that it was possible to combine
gas development with environmental protection. Portugal is seeking a “very close relationship” with Nigeria, a statement from the
minister said.
Under a Niger Delta Development Plan, which aims to resolve
the problems that have plagued the region and led to outbreaks of
violence and unrest, the government is “working hard” to restore
peace in the Niger Delta “very soon,” Emmanuel said.
Nigeria’s zero gas-flaring target, which has been continuously
postponed, could be achieved by December, he said, and he was
optimistic that all stakeholders would comply with the mandate
this time.

Ecuador gives IOCs ‘new contract’ deadline
Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa, advancing a deadline mooted
earlier, said Jan. 26 that international oil companies operating in
his country—including City Oriente, Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras), Perenco, Repsol-YPF SA, and Andes Petroleum—would have
45 days to accept new agreements.
The government wants to change the current contracts from
joint ventures, which allow IOCs to include Ecuadorean reserves
on their balance sheets, to subcontracting deals, which do not.
Oil and Mines Minister Galo Chiriboga, who earlier spoke of a
May deadline for the changes, also warned the companies that the
new contracts would end their option of appealing to the World
Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.
In 2007 Correa’s government unilaterally altered the allocation
of the windfall produced by the rise in international oil prices: the
government now takes 99% of the windfall and the companies get
1%—a decision the companies are fighting in the courts.
Correa gave the companies three choices: to accept the 99%
decree, to accept the new contracts, or to leave the country. If they
leave, Correa said, the government will reimburse them for their
investment and turn the fields over to state-owned oil company
Petroecuador.
Economy Minister Fausto Ortiz recently said the government
expects to receive an additional $1.1 billion in oil revenues during
2008, all coming as a result of the new taxation on foreign companies’ extra oil revenues.
Ortiz acknowledged that the additional revenue will depend on
the renegotiation of contracts with the five oil companies. ✦

gua, Tambau, Caravela, and Cavalo Marinho fields as well as the
construction of a gas treatment unit in Caraguatatuba. Petrobras
said it was expecting production of 30 million cu m/day of gas
and 100,000 b/d of oil.
Petrobras’s recent discovery of Jupiter gas-condensate field in
the basin reinforces the notion that there is practically no exploratory risk in the presalt layer, a Petrobras executive said.
The first Jupiter well, 1-BRSA-559-RJS (1-RJS-652), was drilled
to 5,252 m in 2,187 m of water about 290 km off Rio de Janeiro
state, just 37 km from the Tupi area.

Repsol-YPF makes gas ﬁnd in Peru near Camisea
Repsol-YPF SA made a gas discovery with its Kinteroni X1 exploration well, drilled on Block 57 in Peru near the Camisea project.
Initial production tests registered gas flows of 1 million cu m/
day and 198 cu m/day of associated liquids. The field’s reserves are
estimated at 2 tcf of gas.
Repsol-YPF is operator with a 41% stake.
Domestic demand for gas is estimated to total 6 tcf in the next
20 years, according to Energy and Mines Minister Juan Valdivia.
Peru’s proved gas reserves total 16 tcf, including the reserves
in Blocks 88 and 56 of the Camisea project, the recently discovered gas by Repsol-YPF on Block 57, and the discoveries of
BPZ Energy Inc. and Peruvian oil company Petro-Tech Peruana in
northern Peru.
Valdivia said the government will invest $35-37 million in
2008 to expand the country’s gas distribution networks. He said
the government will invest part of the sum to replace old copper
pipes with ones made of aluminum.

TNK-BP lets contract for Kamennoi ﬁeld
TNK-BP has awarded to Gulf Interstate Engineering Co., Houston, a contract to provide engineering services for the early planning stages of the Kamennoi field development project involving
seven oil and gas fields in Russia.
The first phase of the project anticipates the recovery of 30 million tons of oil, with 330 wells being drilled. An export pipeline
and additional oil processing facility will be built.
The second phase involves long-term development of the most
reliable reserves.
Gulf Interstate will assist TNK-BP in the early planning stages
of this major oil and gas producing field. The firm is to compare
development alternatives to determine the optimum configuration
and recommended sequence of field development. It also will provide a technical, commercial, and planning basis for subsequent
stages and developments.

Second zone tests gas off eastern Trinidad

A second zone has tested gas at an exploratory well 60 miles off
eastern Trinidad.

TCO consortium starts up Tengiz ﬁeld extension
Chevron Corp. affiliate Tengizchevroil LLP, a joint venture of
Chevron 50%, KazMunaiGas 20%, ExxonMobil Kazakhstan Ventures
Inc. 25%, and LukArco 5%, has started up new facilities as part of
the first phase of its expansion at Tengiz field in Kazakhstan.
The total capacity of the TCO consortium will increase to a total of 400,000 b/d following the first phase expansion of 90,000
b/d, while the start-up of full facilities in this year’s second half
will further increase production capacity to 540,000 b/d.
The start-up includes the sour gas injection project, which reinjects produced sour gas into the reservoir at high pressure to
boost production, as well as the front end of the second-generation
plant.
According to Chevron, the second-generation plant was brought
up to about one third of its full capacity and is currently separating
gas for injection while stabilizing and sweetening the oil. Once
fully online, the plant also is designed to process sour gas into gas
products and elemental sulfur.
When the plant is fully fuctional, about a third of the sour gas
produced from the expansion will be injected into the reservoir.
The remaining volumes will be processed as commercial gas, propane, butane, and sulfur.
In 2007, the TCO consortium was the largest oil producer in
Kazakhstan, with output of 13.93 million tonnes of oil, or 20% of
the country’s total production. The country’s overall oil production
rose 3.7% in 2007, according to government figures.

Eni to start Nikaitchuq oil production in 2009
Eni SPA will spend $1.45 billion developing Nikaitchuq oil field
off Alaska’s North Slope. Field production is scheduled to begin at
yearend 2009.
The field, in about 3 m of water, will have 35 production wells
and 35 injection wells drilled in it, “about one third of which will
be drilled from onshore and the remainder drilled from an offshore artificial island built 4.5 km from the coast,” Eni said.

NNPC to restart 125,000 b/d Warri reﬁnery
Nigeria National Petroleum Corp. will restart operations at its
125,000 b/d refinery in Warri in southwest Nigeria on Feb. 6, a
company spokesman told OGJ. The refinery has been idle for the
past 2 years.
If the restarted refinery works consistently, and at a high
throughput, Nigeria’s importation of petroleum products will fall
significantly. In the beginning, the Warri facility will operate at
70% of capacity.
Vandalism had halted feedstock from being transported to the
refinery through the Chanomi Creek Channel pipeline, and NNPC
found it difficult to hire international companies to carry out repairs because of safety fears and rising costs (OGJ Online, Aug.
7, 2007). Repairs by a local company were reported to have cost
$100 million.
NNPC wholly owns the Warri refinery and also owns two re-

Production will be sent to a newly built 40,000 b/d processing
facility onshore near the field and then transported some 22 km to
the Kuparuk network, which is linked to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline
System.
Nikaitchuq has reserves estimated at 180 million bbl of oil. This
will be the first project that Eni will develop in Alaska after acquiring a 30% stake from Armstrong Oil & Gas’ Alaskan assets and the
remaining 70%, together with operatorship, from Anadarko Petroleum Corp. in first quarter 2007.
In this year’s first half Eni expects to begin production in Alaska
from Oooguruk field (Pioneer 70% and operator Eni 30%), which
also is on the North Slope about 25 km west of Nikaitchuq.

Mexico’s oil production down 5.3% in 2007
Mexico’s oil production fell by 174,000 b/d or 5.3% in 2007
to an average of 3.08 million b/d, according to state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos, which said the drop was due to inclement weather
and an expected decline in the Cantarell complex in the Gulf of
Mexico.
Pemex said its production of super-light crude was greater than
expected along the coast of Tabasco state, and output in the Ku-Maloob-Zaap region, also in the Gulf of Mexico, exceeded forecasts.
Meanwhile, the energy ministry is expecting Cantarell’s crude
production to decline gradually over the next 3 years and then
sharply, beginning in 2011.
The most serious weather events of 2007 were Hurricane Dean’s
passage through the Gulf of Mexico in August, which forced bridges to be shut down, and cold fronts in October that forced a halt to
operations for several days.
Pemex posted $38 billion in foreign oil sales, up 9.3% over
2006, while exports by volume averaged 1.68 million b/d. The
company earned some $44.05 billion from domestic sales, 9.6%
more than last year. Mexico is the No. 2 foreign supplier of oil to
the US. ✦

fineries at Port Harcourt, with a total capacity of 210,000 b/d, as
well as the 110,000 b/d Kaduna refinery. None of these facilities is
operating at capacity. These facilities were sold last year to Blue Star
Consortium, but the sale was revoked by President Umaru Yar’Adua
after NNPC told the National Assembly it could fix them.
Port Harcourt’s fluid catalytic cracking unit has been damaged
by power surges, and the Kaduna refinery, which also shares the
Chanomi Creek Channel pipeline, is without feedstock. Crude is
expected to reach Kaduna within the next 3 weeks after Warri is
restarted.
In August the Department for Petroleum Resources received 26
applications from private companies wishing to build refineries in
Nigeria (OGJ Online, Aug. 20, 2007).

as much as 50%, announced plans to modernize its largest refinery
this year. Bidding is to begin in March.
Upgrading northern Peru’s Talara refinery, which is expected to
cost $1 billion, will increase its oil production capacity to 90,000
b/d from 62,000 b/d, according to Petroperu Pres. Cesar Gutierrez.
Work on the renovation is expected to begin in June, said Gutierrez, who added that Brazil’s state-run Petroleo Brasileiro SA will
serve as a consultant on the project.

JAC Singapore aromatics project moves ahead
Jurong Aromatics Corp., Singapore, reported UOP LLC, Des
Plaines, Ill., is under way with the basic engineering and design
of Jurong’s planned aromatics plant in Singapore. The project’s financing is being finalized, and SK Engineering & Construction is
expected to begin construction in this year’s first half.
When it starts up in 2011, the complex will produce about

1.5 million tonnes of petrochemicals, including 800,000 tonnes of
paraxylene, 200,000 tonnes of orthoxylene, and 450,000 tonnes
of benzene. The complex also will have a $400 million condensate
splitter and will produce about 2.5 million tonnes of petroleum
products such as jet fuel and kerosine.

StatoilHydro puts out ﬁre at Mongstad reﬁnery
StatoilHydro AS has launched an internal investigation after a
fire broke out in a coupling flange at its 186,000 b/d Mongstad,
Norway, refinery on Jan. 23.
The fire was extinguished and the refinery is now operating at
about 75% of its capacity, a company spokesman told OGJ, adding,
“It’s a bit early to say what the damage was, and the cause of the
fire hasn’t yet been identified.”
No personnel were injured during the fire and StatoilHydro has
informed the Petroleum Safety Authority Norway about the incident. ✦

Talisman, CNOOC settle over Tangguh project
Talisman Energy Inc. has settled a legal dispute with CNOOC
Ltd. over Indonesia’s Tangguh LNG project, according to reports.
China Business News said Talisman will pay $40 million to
CNOOC for a 2% stake in the BP PLC-led project, which will supply CNOOC’s Fujian LNG terminal.
According to earlier reports sent through Talisman’s Fortuna Resources unit, Talisman had claimed the right to 44% of CNOOC’s
17% interest in the Tangguh project. Lawrence Bernstein, senior
manager for exploration at Talisman’s Malaysian unit, told China
Business News he believed the dispute had been settled, although
he had yet to be officially notified.
The reported settlement coincided with news that CNOOC has
started building two new gas storage tanks at its Fujian LNG terminal. The two tanks, expected to be completed in 2011, will boost
the terminal’s storage capacity to 640,000 cu m, the company said
in a statement.
Phase I of the Fujian LNG terminal, which involves total investment of 21.9 billion yuan, includes two new gas storage facilities;
three gas-fired electric power plants in Putian, Jinjiang, and Xiamen; and distribution facilities in five cities.
CNOOC signed a deal in 2006 to source gas for the Fujian terminal from BP’s Tangguh field in Indonesia, which is due to start
operating in 2009.
The company will supply 2.6 million tonnes/year of LNG for
25 years to Fuzhou, Putian, Quanzhou, Xiamen and Zhangzhou,
and will also supply the fuel for three gas-fired power plants in the
province.

StatoilHydro extends Snohvit start-up period
StatoilHydro has asked the Norwegian Pollution Control Authority for a permit to emit more carbon dioxide as it seeks an
extension for the start-up period at the Snohvit LNG project near
Hammerfest.
Unexpected repairs to leaks in the cooling system have affected
the 6-10 month start-up timetable to increase LNG production,
10

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

and StatoilHydro is now unsure how long it will take. Gas production, which began last September, is expected to plateau at 5.7
billion cu m/year.
A StatoilHydro spokesman told OGJ that Snohvit will run at reduced capacity—about 60%. “But there’s great uncertainty around
this,” he said. Efforts are under way to ensure that Snohvit will run
at full capacity in 2009.
Ordinarily the plant would emit 200,000 million tonnes/
year of carbon but StatoilHydro estimates this could jump to 1.5
million tonnes/year of CO2 and 2,200 tonnes of soot during the
start-up period. Reduced capacity utilization and other possible
modifications have resulted in higher carbon emissions during the
start-up.

Total appeals Erika tanker verdict
Total SA said it will appeal the Jan. 16 Paris Criminal Court verdict concerning the sinking of the Erika tanker off Brittany. The
vessel, which was chartered by Total, sank in December 1999 and
polluted the coastline with 20,000 tonnes of heavy fuel oil.
Total did not dispute, however, the €375,000 fine to compensate the victims for “ecological damage” of the pollution. In a press
release, Total said it would ensure payments were made “immediately” and are “full and final whatever the result of the appeal.”
Total said it has already spent €200 million in cleaning efforts.
Total is disputing the part of the verdict requiring it to pay €192
million in damages for causing the ship to sink. The court said
these damages were caused “through lack of care during the tanker-selection process.” Total said it was misled by the certification
company, Rena, on the tanker’s true condition.
“Total is merely a user of ships. It is not its role or its business
to act as a substitute for inspection companies and classification
societies, the ship owners, or the flag state,” the company said.
Christophe de Margerie, Total chief executive officer, said, “We
are not happy to appeal. This judgment is aimed at ‘the deep pockets’...but in no way does it contribute to rendering the whole maritime chain more responsible.” ✦

World decline rate
The Jan. 17, 2008, press release by
Cambridge Energy Research Associates
(see __________
www.cera.com), which was carried by Reuters, reported the world’s oil
supplies were to rise to 112 million b/d
by 2017. This rise is in spite of CERA’s
other conclusion that the world’s oil
fields are declining in capacity at the
average rate of 4.5%/year. These conclusions are clearly suspect.
Although it is unlikely that global oil
production is likely to drop significantly
in the next few years, major sustainable
increases are equally unlikely. Given the
current global production of 86 million b/d and CERA’s 4.5% decline rate,
global capacity would have to increase
by 7.5 million b/d each year for the
next 10 years to reach 112 million b/d.
This is a total of 75 million b/d of new
capacity in 10 years. Even excluding the
effect of declining rates, achieving 112
million b/d within a decade represents a
massive leap of 26 million b/d in global
capacity.
To put this in perspective, 75 million b/d of new capacity is the equivalent of eight new Saudi Arabias or 14
new Irans in just 10 years. Considering
the reality that Saudi Arabia, with 25%
of the world’s best proven reserves, is
already investing $50 billion to increase
its production capacity by 2 million b/d,
where does CERA expect the additional
24 million b/d of production capacity to
come from, let alone the replacement for
the 51 million b/d of declines?

Bill Cobb, 2008 SPE president,

viewing the recent data optimistically,
Cobb added, “I don’t think we can draw
conclusions about the entire industry
from our membership statistics, but
what is clear is that there are large numbers of young professionals entering
the industry, which is something that is
sorely needed.”

Bush’s energy program
It’s no mere coincidence that the most sterile climate in decades for energy policy-making
developed while the US president followed instead
of led on the subject. George W. Bush surely knows
more than he lets show about energy. He also
knows that a Texan president with family roots in
the oil and gas business arouses stifling suspicion
in the US and that relief comes from speaking
against 62% of his country’s energy supply.
When Bush disparages oil—and by association
natural gas—therefore, it’s reasonable to assume
the motivation is politics. He doesn’t denounce the
industry that brings oil to market or the companies or people within it. He confines his scorn to
the substance. His measured approach has been
enough to hold mostly at bay the detractors who
condemn him for any hint of friendliness toward
an industry they hate. It also has allowed discussion about energy in the US to become delusional.

Costly turn
A president leads with public pronouncements, which achieve their greatest force in the
annual state-of-the-union address. What Bush has
said from that platform explains much about a
costly US turn on energy. In 2003, promising to
“promote energy independence for our country
while dramatically improving the environment,”
he proposed $1.2 billion in research funding for
hydrogen-powered vehicles. Through this “important innovation to make our air significantly
cleaner and our country much less dependent on
foreign sources of energy,” Bush set the country
back on a course, discredited by history, toward
fuel selection by government.
In 2004, Bush urged Congress to pass “legislation to modernize our electricity system, promote
conservation, and make America less dependent on
foreign sources of energy.” The legislature obliged
the following year with a bill full of political
favors for a range of energy sources, including for
oil and gas but more extravagantly for fuels from
renewable sources such as ethanol and biodiesel.
With prices high after hurricanes slashed
US oil and gas supplies, Bush in January 2006
complained that the US was “addicted to oil.” He
boasted that the government had spent nearly $10

billion since 2001 “to develop cleaner, cheaper,
and more reliable alternative sources” and promised: “We are on the threshold of incredible
advances.” Announcing further increases in spending for “clean-energy research,” he set goals of
making ethanol from cellulose commercial within
6 years and replacing 75% of US oil imports from
the Middle East by 2025.
In last year’s state-of-the-union address, Bush
raised the targets. Seeking a 20% cut in gasoline
use within 10 years, he called for a quintupling of
the mandate for renewable and alternative vehicle
fuels to 35 billion gal by 2017 and a toughening
of fuel efficiency standards. He again heralded
innovation, saying, “America is on the verge of
technological breakthroughs that will enable us
to live our lives less dependent on oil.” And again,
Congress obliged him, passing the Energy Independence and Security Act.
The president was more general in his last
state-of-the-union speech on Jan. 28. He talked
up coal use for power generation with carbon
capture, increased use of renewable and nuclear
power, advanced batteries and renewable fuels for
vehicles, and an “international clean technology
fund” to help developing countries increase their
use of “clean energy sources.”

Programmatic approach
Throughout his presidency, then, Bush has
articulated a programmatic approach toward
energy that veers away from the market orientation in place since the 1980s. The approach plays
to American cravings for domestically produced
energy forms that are—or at least appear to be—
less polluting than oil. It also ignores American
requirements that energy be plentiful and cheap—
the very essentials that have doomed past government forays into energy choice.
To his credit, Bush at various times has supported
expanded federal leasing and other efforts to raise
US production of oil and gas. With his serial acquiescence to popular fantasy, however, he has invited
into the national energy discussion an antioil prejudice that consistently forecloses steps his country
must take if it is to raise domestic energy supply in
large amounts at affordable cost. ✦

Several independents declined to discuss company-specific field costs with
OGJ, and some said the information is
proprietary.
High service costs can contribute
to higher commodity prices. Adam
Sieminski, Deutsche Bank chief energy
economist, recently revised his 2008
average price forecast for West Texas
Intermediate crude on the New York
Mercantile Exchange to $85/bbl, up
$5/bbl.
“One key factor that offers compelling new evidence that our longer-term
energy price forecasts need to be revised higher is rapidly increasing finding and development costs,” Sieminski
said.
Oil price declines historically follow
lower demand for refined products,
improvements in seismic and drilling
technology, and better access to petroleum reserves, said.
“A repeat of this confluence of
events is certainly possible, but seems
improbable over the course of the next
few years,” Sieminski said, citing flourishing oil demand growth in Asia and
the Middle East.

JAS shows rising costs
The Joint Association Survey on
Drilling Costs (JAS) estimates industry
spent $76.2 billion in 2005 to drill and
equip wells in the US, up 18% from the
estimate for 2004.
Increases in the number of wells
and footage drilled pushed the average cost per well and cost per foot to
higher levels (see table). The JAS survey
relies upon actual well costs provided

by hundreds of operators.
The American Petroleum Institute,
Independent Petroleum Association of
America, and Mid-Continental Oil and
Gas Association sponsor the survey. API
analysts have compiled the yearly survey
report since 1954.
The survey of 2005 costs was released in April 2007, said Hazem Arafa,
API statistics department director.
Survey compilers have about 70%
of the data when they begin a report,
and they use those field cost reports
to estimate the costs for every well in
the database, Arafa said. It takes 3 years
for 99.7% of the wells drilled to be
reported.
“Once we develop the model, we estimate costs,” Arafa said. “As wells come
in later on, we always can attach a cost
to it using the model. We don’t resurvey
the companies.”
Ron Planting, API’s manager of
statistical information, said API prepares
drilling cost indexes that separate out
the effects of shifts in drilling depths
and regional patterns, as well the effects
of general inflation.
“Without adjusting for these factors,
the survey shows that average cost per
well more than doubled between 2001
and 2005.” Planting said. “Part of that
cost increase, however, was due to shifts
to deeper drilling and other changes in
drilling patterns.”
After removing the effects of changes
in depth and regional drilling patterns, the API index shows that costs
rose 78%. If that is further adjusted
for inflation, the JAS indexes show that
inflation-adjusted costs rose 68%, Planting said.
API Chief Economist John Felmy
noted that companies are continually
experiencing higher drilling success
rates. He said field costs for 2005 are
much different than the costs reported
decades ago, in part because the success
rate has gone up dramatically.
“Here in Washington, people like
to point out you’ve got $100/bbl oil.
But at the same time, you’ve also got to
realize that costs have increased,” Felmy
said. “It’s a challenge for oil companies

because you’ve
got costs that are
changing dramatically.
Oil companies
are looking to
go forward and
develop resources,
but they’ve got to
be sure that they
can do it,” Felmy
said. “Companies
are putting projects in place that
are going to last
30-40 years, and
that just makes it
much, much more
challenging.”

CERA: Costs

Cambridge
Energy Research
Associates (CERA)
said upstream capital costs moderated slightly during
the first half of 2007 compare with the
rate of cost increases during 2006.
Pritesh Patel, lead researcher on
upstream capital costs for CERA, said,
“This raised an expectation in the
industry that cost increases may be
coming to an end.” However, he said,
“The latest data indicate this not to be
the case.”
Although rigs are being built and
equipment manufacturing capacity is
increasing, much of that expansion will
not come on line until the second half
of 2008 or later.
In November 2007, CERA and its
parent IHS Inc. said costs of constructing new oil and gas facilities had surged
to a record high, up 11% in 6 months
to 198 points on CERA’s upstream capital costs index.
“This is nearly double the costs
observed as recently as 2005 when the
index measured 106 points,” CERA said.
Analysts did note a slight decline in day
rates for offshore drilling rigs.

A sustained increase in the price of
steel in 2003 followed by rising oil prices triggered a dramatic increase in oil
field equipment and facilities in 2005.
“As industry activity levels increased
in 2005-06, manufacturers and suppliers of oil and gas equipment and
services reached maximum capacity and
began to increase their prices,” CERA
said. The cumulative effect of tight
capacity due to high activity levels and
high raw-material costs nearly doubled
the capital required for the same set of
facilities.

Apache lowering costs
Apache combines improved equipment and drilling technology with
finely tuned exploration strategies
Tom Voytovich, vice-president of
Apache’s Central Region, said land rig
rates are down 5-10% from their levels
a year ago. Rig availability also has improved somewhat from the same time
last year, especially for intermediatesized rigs. New rigs and those with

more powerful pumps remain in short
supply.
Apache’s Central Region waited 3
months to get rigs in early 2007, but
the Houston independent’s rig wait
was only few weeks as of early 2008.
Voytovich credits drilling contractors
for building rigs so that supply climbed
to meet increasing demand.
“Our drilling performance continues
to improve, so we are realizing a savings over a year ago across the Midcontinent and Texas,” Voytovich said. “We
continue to climb the learning curve
on technologies and build on our area
expertise.”
Apache significantly lowered its field
costs at Stiles Ranch, primarily through
what Voytovich calls “aggressive use”
of polycrystalline diamond compact
(PDC) bits and through using rigs with
top drives.
PDC bits allow Apache to get much
faster penetration rates and also much
longer bit runs, which saves time because it requires fewer trips.
“What that accomplished is that
we now drill wells in significantly less
time,” Voytovich said. Apache took 50
days to drill 16,000-ft vertical wells in
Stiles Ranch in mid-2006, but now it
drills a well in 40 days. In January, Voytovich expected Apache would reduce
its drilling time there to 37-38 days
within a couple of months.
The use of top drives eliminates
some steps in pipe handling, reduces
nonproductive time, and enables a rig
to multitask by being able to rotate and
circulate while tripping and running
casing.
“This is beneficial when drilling
directional wells, and it provides better well control on trips,” Voytovich
said. “Operational efficiencies achieved
through the use of top drives translate
directly into cost savings.”
Apache lowered drilling costs
$200,000/well for Stiles Ranch, which
straddles the Oklahoma-Texas border
just north of US Interstate 40 and is one
of the most active areas for Apache’s
Central Region. Apache drilled 21 wells
in Stiles Ranch during 2007 and expects

to drill 25 or more wells there this year.
In East Texas, Voytovich sees rig
availability “loosening up a little.” He
expects Apache will drill about 25 wells
there this year. He sees strong demand
for drilling rigs capable of drilling
horizontal wells in East Texas, which is
something that Apache does.
Regarding Midcontinent field costs,
Voytovich expects day rates will fluctuate with natural gas prices.
“It has to do with the redistribution
of rigs as well,” he said. “We lost rigs
from Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle up to the Rockies in the last couple
of years. We are starting to see some of
those rigs come back. If that continues,
we should see prices go down.”

Strong rig demand in Permian
Apache plans to drill more than 200

wells this year in the Permian basin, a
moderate increase over what it drilled
there last year.
“This is really driven by rig availability,” Voytovich said. “Permian is an area
that is receiving a lot of heat and light
right now because of [high] oil prices,
so rig availability is a little tighter
there.”
He noted that smaller rigs in the
Permian handle singles only while
most rigs hired by Apache use triples.
Apache’s current contract land fleet
includes rigs ranging from 500 hp to
2,000 hp. The fleet involves newbuild
rigs having the latest technology and
decades-old rigs having had various
upgrades and modernization.

ing study, “Improving Field Performance,” was Ziff’s sixth Permian study
since 1996. Five of the six participating
operators were independents.
The study examines operating cost
data for a 12-month period from mid
2006 to mid 2007. The study assessed
134 fields (including 26 carbon dioxide
tertiary enhanced oil recovery fields)
that collectively produce nearly half the
basin’s oil and a third of its natural gas.
Part of the increased average operating costs since 2004 was associated
with higher oil and gas prices.
The average operating cost for
Permian oil fields increased 34% to
$10.42/bbl since last analyzed. Saying
that increase was in line with increased
oil prices, Ziff also noted that leading
operators achieved average oil field
operating costs below $6.50/bbl.
The average operating cost for gas
fields increased 45% to nearly $1.35/
Mcf. By contrast, leading operators of
gas fields achieved average operating
costs of less than 80¢/Mcf.
“Unlike the oil price, however, the
gas price has hardly increased, so gas
margins are squeezed,” Ziff said.
Ziff analysts concluded that electricity costs increased 40% and that taxes

constituted the largest single cost component for both oil and gas fields (40%
for gas fields, and almost a third of total
operating expenses for oil fields).
“Cost pressures and reduction potential are heavily concentrated in four
specific cost categories: well servicing,
taxes, labor and field supervision, and
electricity,” Ziff said.

In 2007, Devon drilled about 130
conventional wells and 200 coalbed gas
wells in the Rockies.
“This year, we expect to drill
100-150 conventional wells and about
100 coalbed natural gas wells in the
area,” the company told OGJ. “Devon’s
capital budget in the Rockies is about
$300 million for 2008.”

High costs for rigs, services pinch independents

High costs for drilling rigs
and services are expected to

below $6/MMbtu a few months ago,
causing some producers to curtail gas
exploration and production. “People are
cutting back on gas. Production costs
have rescinded, but the price of gas has
not sustained like the price of oil,” said
Stevens.
French said, “Gas production in the US and Canada,
LNG imports, and high gas
storage levels all impact independents. They are going to be
more conservative. However,
a slowdown in gas production could very well lead to an
upturn in the second half.”
The connection between
the oil and gas markets has
changed to a 10-12:1 economic value
of oil to gas vs. the traditional energy
content ratio of 6:1. “Of course,” Stevens said, “independents get much lower prices at wellhead than on the spot
and futures markets.” In addition to the
cost of rigs and services, independents’
income is pinched by increased costs of
leases and pipeline transportation.
With crude futures market prices
now above $90/bbl on the New York
market, French said, “I would not be
surprised to see more independents
drilling for oil than we have seen for
some time.” He said, “The key indicator
is the rig count. The dominant feeling
is that the count will stay strong, and
there is a significant amount of optimism for improvement in the second
half of the year.”
Yet despite high oil prices, Stevens
said, “Only 10-15% of rigs are drilling
for crude.” There are “not a lot of workovers” to improve production of existing wells. And despite a bigger rig fleet,
he said, “People are still waiting for
rigs and other services in other areas as
more men and equipment have flowed
to the Barnett shale. Permian basin consolidations have left people standing in
line for equipment and services.”

Political problems blamed
At the Texas Alliance’s exposition
and annual meeting in April 2007, Roy
T. Pitcock, president of Pitcock Inc. in
26

Graham, Tex., summed up the major
problem for independents in just one
word: “Politicians.”
“They’re not looking after us as they
should,” Pitcock said. “They’re looking
after themselves. I don’t have a problem
SPECIAL

with people looking after themselves,
but they’re not paid to do that. They
should be looking after the problems
for their districts in the right way,
where the funds come for the school
systems in their areas. All we’re asking is
to get government off our backs; 98%
of the independents are doing their best
to give people jobs.”
Pitcock told OGJ, “Costs are higher
than a year ago. Expenses and labor have
gone up. It does slow us down, but the
price of oil is a lot higher too.”
When it comes to looking at prospects and deciding how many wells
to drill, he said, “You still look at the
economics. Of course, we used to have
our own drilling fleet in the 1960s1970s, but we sold them all. It would
be nice to have them back—everybody
wants a rig.” Still he said, “We have our
own service rigs to look after our own
production, and we do a little outside
service work.”
Another major problem for independents, said Pitcock, “is to treat and reuse
the large amounts of water that go into
frac jobs” in the Barnett shale and other
tight formations. He said, “Right now
they say you can’t reuse that water. To
me that is foolishness. A farmer or a
rancher is tickled to death to sell water
to us. I was buying water for $300-400
for a well, now we’re talking about
$2,500-4,000 for drilling water to drill
a well.” ✦

“This was the president’s final opportunity to declare to the American
people that we should finally break our
shackles from foreign nations and move
toward energy security by opening up
the Outer Continental Shelf for energy
production. Sadly, though, the president
did not use the evening’s occasion to
demonstrate leadership on energy security,” Peterson said.
“Opening up the OCS would create
American jobs and drive down the
cost of energy for our manufacturers,
our churches and hospitals, and folks
living on fixed incomes. While Washington politicians continue to promise
and subsidize ‘green-collar’ jobs, it is
my fear that if we do not address our
energy crisis sooner or later, blue-collar
jobs in America will be few and far
between,” Peterson said.

IPAA reaction
The Independent Petroleum Association of America released a statement in

28

response to the president’s address. IPAA
Pres. and Chief Executive Officer Barry
Russell said, “President Bush was right
to again raise the energy issue in his
State of the Union address. Energy costs,
security, efficiency, and reserves are
among the most importance issues facing America and the economy. A solid
energy policy that increases American
oil and gas production is essential to
helping the economy by keeping more
petrodollars at work in the US.”
Russell said, “In addition to the Bush
Administration’s proposals to allow oil
exploration in some areas of the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge, we should
also open access to natural gas supplies in the mountain states and allow
increased exploration and production in
the Outer Continental Shelf, where we
are known to have decades of oil and
gas supplies.
“Our best defense against foreign
oil dependency is developing the vast

oil and natural gas resources we have
here in America. This energy is our
true strategic petroleum reserve, and
government policies should encourage its development. The majority of
these critical resources, however, remain
off limits. Nearly 85% of the nation’s
offshore resources are restricted by the
government for exploration, which if
developed could replace Persian Gulf
imports for the next 59 years. As if this
was not enough, clean natural gas in
the Intermountain West that is currently
off-limits in nonpark, nonwilderness
government lands could heat 50 million
US homes for the next 60 years,” Russell said.

Other signals
While other parts of Bush’s address
did not specifically mention energy,
some signaled how he would respond
to legislation that could affect the business. He promised to veto any bill that
would increase taxes, for example, a po-

sition that led to the elimination of oil
and gas taxes that Congress had inserted
into the energy bill and that eventually
became law in December.
Bush also said he would submit a
proposed budget for fiscal year 2009
that would terminate or substantially
reduce “151 wasteful or bloated programs, totaling more than $18 billion.”
Bush said, “The budget that I’ll submit
will keep America on track for a surplus
in 2012. American families have to
balance their budgets. So should their
government.”
While the primary focus in Washington will be on passage and adoption of
an economic stimulus package, energyrelated activities also are scheduled. US
Sec. of Energy Samuel W. Bodman was
scheduled to deliver the keynote address at a global biofuels conference of
the US Chamber of Commerce on Jan.
29. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee planned a hearing
on carbon capture, sequestration, and

transportation on Jan. 31. At the same
time, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee planned a hearing
on recommendations by the National
Surface Transportation and Revenue
Study Commission that includes substantially increasing gasoline taxes.
In a joint statement following the
President’s address on Jan. 28, House
Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and
Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid
(D-Nev.) said in a joint statement
they hoped the bipartisanship that

was shown in preparing an economic
stimulus package in the past week
was a sign of things to come. “But the
president must do more than simply
give speeches that promise progress and
commit to cooperation. He must work
with Congress to make it happen,” they
said.
“If the president holds fast to the
commitment he made to bipartisanship
tonight, we can make great progress for
the American people this year,” Pelosi

API: US natural gas drilling breaks record in 2007
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
US oil and gas exploration and
production activity remained robust
during 2007 as producers drilled a
record number of natural gas wells, the
American Petroleum Institute said.

Oil well completion activity was
the most active since 1990, while total
estimated footage was the highest in
two decades, API said Jan. 24 in its latest
quarterly well completion report.
An estimated 52,731 oil wells, gas
wells, and dry holes were completed
domestically in 2007, according to API.

Greenhouse gas
control issues

US

Senate Environment and
Public Works Committee
Chairwoman Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.)
did not hide her displeasure as she
opened a Jan. 24 hearing on Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Stephen L. Johnson’s refusal to
grant California and 14 other states
authority to impose tougher greenhouse gas controls on motor vehicles.
“In my many years in the House
and in the Senate, I have never seen
such disregard by an agency head for
Congress and for the committee with
responsibility for oversight of his
agency,” she said. Four more states
are moving toward adopting California’s standards, Boxer said. Johnson,
in a prepared statement, said the
federal agency had granted California
several previous waivers that involved
pollutants affecting local and regional
air quality. GHGs are “fundamentally
global in nature,” he said.
Congress considered amendments to Title II of the Clean Air Act
in the fall of 2007 concerning GHG
emissions regulations with respect to
both vehicles and fuels, but it did not
make the proposals part of the energy
bill it passed on Dec. 18 and that US
President George W. Bush signed into
law a day later, Johnson said.

‘Common sense’
The energy bill did substantially
strengthen fuel economy standards
for cars and light-duty trucks nationwide, an approach that Johnson
prefers in this case. “I just think it is
common sense,” he said.
Three governors who testified—
Maryland’s Martin O’Malley, Vermont’s Jim Douglas, and Pennsylvania’s Edward Rendell—opposed
30

Johnson’s decision. But Douglas
Halland, member services director in
the California Assembly’s Republican
Caucus, called it “a reasoned response
to a process that has been allowed to
spin out of control in California.”
The US became a signatory nation
to the 1997 Kyoto Protocols in 1998
but there has been no action to ratify
the treaty since then, much to the
distress of several national environmental organizations, Halland said.

Environmental ‘bank-shot’
Halland testified, “These groups
have taken their message to states and
municipalities urging ‘local’ action
since Washington has not committed us to the requirements of the
protocols. As a result, California has
become the ‘bank-shot’ around Washington’s perceived inability to take
action.” Michigan Atty. Gen. Mike
Cox conceded that there are instances
where federal laws shouldn’t preempt
more aggressive state regulation. But
he added that global climate change
can’t be solved by focusing on automobiles, a single source of less than
a third of US GHGs and 7% of such
emissions worldwide.
The proposed waiver also doesn’t
analyze potential costs, Cox said. “Allowing California and the other states
that adopt its regulations to impose
what would become the de facto national standard contravenes principles
of federalism and undermines the
possibility for our nation to speak
and act with one voice in addressing
this global problem.”
Boxer disagreed. Following the
hearing, she and 17 cosponsors introduced a bill to overturn Johnson’s
decision. ✦

The fourth quarter’s estimated 13,737
completions were the highest since
1986’s first quarter, it added.
Natural gas continued to dominate as
an estimated 30,625 wells were drilled
during the year, with 7,785 of them
sunk during the fourth quarter. US gas
drilling reached a quarterly peak during
2007’s final quarter, API noted.
A resurgence in oil well completion activity, which began in 2000,
continued in 2007 as an estimated
17,223 wells were drilled, API reported.
Exploratory gas well estimates rose for a
fifth consecutive year to a record 3,613,
while the estimated 981 exploratory oil
well total was comparable to 1986, the
report said.
Total footage for the year, which
API said was the highest in two decades, was about 306,424,000 ft, with
77,812,000 ft drilled during the fourth
quarter, it indicated.

Oil’s share grew
The report was similar to others
which showed gas continuing to be
the primary driving force in domestic
exploration and production. But there
also were signs that oil’s share of total
activity grew during the year.
The total number of rigs working in
the US during 2007 averaged 1,768/
week, according to Baker Hughes Inc.
Gas accounted for more than 80% of
the total through the year, but oil’s
share grew from 16% during January,
or an average 269.5 wells/week, to 19%
during December, or an average 337.5
wells/week. Gas drilling grew more
modestly from an average 1,440.25
wells/week during January to 1,468
wells/week during December.
Prices may be having an influence.
Oil prices pushed to near $100/bbl in
early January, driven by: the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’
decision to maintain current production; geopolitical issues in Iran, Nigeria,
and Pakistan; and by a sharp decline
in US inventories, the Federal Reserve
Bank of Dallas said in its January 2008
Houston Economic Update.

remained in the $7-8/Mcf range as they felt downward pressure from moderate winter weather and inventories that are
about 10% above normal for mid-winter. They were supported, however, by sharply rising oil prices, the Dallas Fed said.
“Domestic drilling held steady near 1,800 working rigs
[during 2007], but the Texas rig count jumped sharply, once
again led by work in the Barnett shale near Fort Worth. Expectations are for drilling to decline in Canada in 2008 and
remain steady or pick up in the US and for lucrative international work to continue to grow,” it indicated.
It said that pricing for drilling and other oil field services remains mixed, depending on the line of business, on
domestic weakness versus international strength, and on
declines in pricing for some drilling durable goods vs. better pricing for some nondurable products. “Overall, price
pressures in oil services have eased significantly since last
spring,” the Dallas Fed report noted. ✦

OWA: W. Africa is strategic
for global crude oil supplies
Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
Offshore West Africa is poised to become an important
source of oil and gas supplies for global consumption, with
6.5 billion bbl of oil discovered in the last 2 years alone.
Speaking at the Offshore West Africa conference in Abuja,
IHS Energy analyst Adebola Adejumo said oil companies were
attracted to the province because of large discoveries and rising energy prices.
“Angola, Algeria, Libya, and Nigeria will provide 80% of
the production,” Adejumo said.
Chris Ogiemwonyi, Nigeria National Petroleum Corp.
group executive director of exploration and production, said
Brazil’s large oil find, Tupi, was an exciting development
because it suggested that similar discoveries could emerge
off West Africa, as they share similar basins. “We need an aggressive exploration program,” he added.
With fears intensifying over the volume of the world’s
produced reserves and a reduction in access to prolific oil
and gas zones such as Russia and Iran, oil companies are
turning to West Africa as they rework mature producing
areas.
The world holds an estimated 4.82 trillion bbl of oil
resources with only 1.08 trillion bbl produced.
But the challenges to bring on production—particularly
in deep water—are immense, speakers noted during the
opening session. Operators are finding tightening fiscal
regimes in applying for licenses, increasing project costs, and

OWA: Pressure increases to bring peace to Niger Delta
Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
Funds of $4 billion allocated by
the Nigerian government to the Niger
Delta for its development over the last
4-5 years have been swallowed up by
increased governmental staff wages,
security, and corruption, a senior ofﬁcial said.
Speaking at the Offshore West Africa
conference, E. Utuama, deputy governor for Delta State, said staff numbers
in government posts had risen because
there weren’t any jobs in the private
sector. “Everyone is looking for a job,”
Utuama said.
But Nigeria should form an Inspector General’s ofﬁce to monitor sustainable development projects in the
Niger Delta and help quell the unrest
that is blocking oil and gas production,
said Stephen Benstowe, a Niger Delta
community relations advisor, at the

political volatility, which must be surpassed to unlock the region’s potential.
Oliver Onyewuenyi, program manager for global deepwater R&D at Shell
International Exploration & Production,
said the cost of drilling deepwater wells
has risen from $30 million to $100
million. Developing new technologies
is crucial to tapping deepwater oil and
gas fields where there is rugged terrain,
shallow gas seepage, and a low seabed
temperature environment. “Subsalt imaging is evolving to help us do more,”
he added.
Other technologies that are enabling
deepwater exploration and production
include subsea processing and longdistance subsea tiebacks.
However, associated gas in Nigeria and Angola is a key problem for
operators in developing major projects,
Onywuenyi said. “How do we monetize
it? If you can convert the gas to LNG or
liquids, then that can help the economics of projects.”
32

conference session looking at sustainable development in that area.
Timely release of funds for development in the Niger Delta was critical,
said Benstowe, who also has provided
advice to the Bonny Island community
that hosts the Nigeria LNG plant. The
problems in the region can be blamed
on government inaction and insincerity
from oil companies with their sustainable development policies, Benstowe
said. Operators are failing to integrate
and engage with the communities.
“Who is responsible for sustainable development in Nigeria? It has earned $20
billion/year over the last 4 years from
oil, and there are 20 million inhabitants
in the Niger Delta who live in abject
poverty and are grossly neglected.”
The government has formulated
the Niger Delta Master Plan to reduce poverty, diversify the economy,
improve health and develop new
transport, communications, and waste

management facilities. So far, militants
and residents from the region have
complained bitterly about its poor
implementation.
Community Development Foundations, where communities and oil
companies work together to address
their needs, have had some success,
said Anthony Bolarin, general manager
of sustainable development at Elf Petroleum Nigeria Ltd. “There have been
lots of national development plans proposed before, and if we’re not careful
there will be another one. Things have
started to be built, but haven’t ﬁnished
or those that have ﬁnished have been
grassed up.”
Bolarin said global memorandums
of understanding have been a failure in
spearheading development in the Niger
Delta. “We need to let the community
come back to the center and ask them
what they want. We must stop dictating
to them,” he said.

Nigeria’s gas flaring has amounted to
$32 billion/year, according to Adejumo.
This is equivalent to 3.5 billion boe
over the past 26 years. It has repeatedly
extended its zero gas flaring deadline,
but Adejumo said Nigeria was unlikely
to meet it unless local consumption
could be stimulated and pipelines
built to gather gas. Major international

projects such as the West African gas
pipeline, Trans Sahara gas pipeline and
additional liquefaction trains at Nigeria

answer on [which] moves OPEC will

Nigeria plans to increase its oil
reserves to 40 billion bbl by 2011 and
to increase production to 4 million b/d
by the same date, although that would
mean an increase in its OPEC production quota.
The minister confirmed that Nigeria
wants to invest $30 billion or more
over the next 4-5 years in the upstream
sector, with the money coming from
both domestic and external financing.

In 2008, Ajumogbia said, Nigeria is
looking for $3.9 billion from capital
markets, banks, and partners. “It is clear
that the more we invest, the more we
will get back,” he said.
He told OGJ that Nigeria missed its
zero natural gas flaring target Jan. 1. It
will now impose “fair but reasonable”
penalties on operators that continue to
flare gas. He said the president may set
a new target, possibly yearend 2008.
“We are determined to eliminate gas
flaring,” Ajumogbia said.

The penalty aims to compensate for
wasting the resources, he said, but it
won’t dissuade operators from producing gas.
Reforms of Nigeria’s National Petroleum Co. are on course, he added.
NNPC will be split into units to make
it more productive and effective in a
global energy market (OGJ Online, Sept.
10, 2007). “The power and gas committees will write their reports by the
end of February so that they can meet
the president’s 6-month deadline.” ✦

gypt’s increasingly strategic role
in oil and gas shipping, as well as
nuclear and alternative energy, was
recently highlighted by US Sec. of Energy Samuel W. Bodman on his tour
of the Middle East.
“Egypt has long been a key energy
ally of the United States, and we
are committed to continuing and
expanding the strategic partnership
between our two nations,” Bodman
said.

By contrast with higher fees for oil

that’s no accident.

gas (OGJ, Jan. 21, 2008, p. 41).
Brazil also extended Brazilian credit
to Cuba for food, medicine, and hotel
and road construction.
Brazil’s official Agencia Estado news
agency said the agreements coincide
with political transition in Cuba a year
and a half after Cuban President Fidel
Castro transferred power to his brother
Raul due to health problems.
Agencia Estado said the aid program
has a long-term strategy: Brazil sees
Cuba as a growing market and a transshipment point in a “privileged location” near Florida, and it wants to be in
a positive position “when trade opens
up as part of Fidel’s succession process.”

Plans also call for Venezuela and Cuba
jointly to increase the capacity of Cuba’s
65,000 b/d Cienfuegos refinery to
150,000 b/d. Built in 1990 with Soviet
technology and mothballed in 1991,
the refinery reopened Dec. 21, 2007,

following Venezuela’s renovations. Cuba
also will reopen an oil pipeline from
the refinery to Matanzas.
Cuba has endured a 50-year US economic embargo that precludes US firms
from investing in such projects. ✦

Venezuela-Cuban pacts
Venezuela is Cuba’s biggest trading
partner in South America, and Brazil
wants to recover ground lost to Hugo
Chavez. Since 2003, Chavez has been
selling petroleum to Cuba at subsidized
prices in exchange for the island’s
sending physicians, nurses, and hospital
equipment to Venezuela.
“It was because of Venezuela that
Cuba’s negotiations with Petrobras
in the past reached an impasse,” said
Agencia Estado.
On Dec. 22, 2007, Chavez and Raul
Castro signed 14 energy agreements in
Havana, including a $122 million loan
for Cuba to buy tankers to transport
crude oil and products from Venezuela.

This is an update of a recent article
by the author in which he painted a
rather pessimistic picture of the future
of US natural gas production based on
the Potential Gas Committee’s Dec. 31,
2004, report.1
The new total remaining dry gas
resource volume of 1,320,950 tcf on
Dec. 31, 2006, estimated by the PGC2
represents an increase of 201.695 tcf

204.385 tcf) instead of the end-2006
value of 211.085 tcf (Lower 48 states
200.840 tcf plus 10.245 tcf in Alaska.3)
Thus, the corrected end-2006 value of
potential US gas resources and proved
reserves is 1,532.035 tcf.

Future US production

In order to arrive at an estimate of
how much US gas remains for future
production, cumulative production
through the end of 2006 must be
added.
In its Dec. 31, 2006, report, the
PGC estimated this value at 1,091 tcf

Union. Of special importance would be
the construction of a pipeline to China
for power generation to reduce its dependence on coal.
Returning to the prospects of the
role of unconventional gas production in US gas supply, there is general
agreement that it will provide about 10
tcf from the Lower 48 states to supply
a total of roughly 20.5 tcf in 2030.5
A recent article by Vello A. Kuuskraa et
al.10 makes a detailed analysis of how
this volume might be increased.
Nevertheless, it seems increasingly
clear that US gas supply, except possibly
for LNG imports, will reach a plateau
around 2030, unless the positive outlook for increased unconventional gas
production is realized.

Outlook
In view of the limitations on US gas
supply as a transition fuel to a sustainable energy system which will require
30-50 years, it is clear that we must

accelerate the commercialization of the
gasification of coal and lignite, the most
abundant US and global energy resource, into hydrogen and synthesis gas
for the production of synthetic liquid
fuels and methane using technologies
which permit the removal and sequestration of most of the CO2 formed.
Sustainable energy systems by definition use inexhaustible and emissionfree energy sources such as solar
photovoltaic and solar thermal power
and wind and hydroelectric power
whose availability is limited and which
also have some negative environmental
impacts.
In addition, the research, development, and demonstration on environmentally benign and economically
feasible recovery of methane from the
vast US and global resources of methane hydrates must be accelerated. The
apparently insurmountable limitations
on the use of biofuels as a major sustainable energy source to replace fossil

fuels are beyond the scope of this article
and have been discussed by the author
in two earlier articles and widely in the
energy press.1 11

Committee of the Potential Gas Agency,

Gazprom as a source of gas supply for
the FSU, much of Europe, and potentially China. ✦

the next decade, according to company reports
during the year.
In January 2007, the company
started producing to the Cidade do Rio
de Janeiro floating production, storage,
offloading (FPSO) vessel moored in
Espadarte field. In October, production
started to the world’s first cylindershaped FPSO installed in Pirama field.
The FPSO Cidade de Vitoria went on
stream in Golfinho field in November.
This was followed in November and
December with the start-up of the P-52
semisubmersible production unit and
the P-54 FPSO in Roncador field
With this additional capacity, production in Brazil set a record of 2 million bo/d near yearend 2007.
As developments in Brazil continue,
the company expects production in
Brazil to reach 2.421 million bo/d in
2012 and 2,812 million bo/d in 2015
(Fig. 1). Gas production likewise is set
to increase to 70.8 million cu m/ day

The Cidade do Rio de Janeiro was
the second FPSO installed in Espadarte
field in the Campos basin. The FPSO has
a design processing capacity of 100,000
bo/d and 2.5 million cu m/day of gas.
The 320-m long FPSO, moored in

Petrobras noted that the FPSO has
several technological innovations
aboard, among which is a new oilpumping system developed by the
Petrobras research center (Cenpes). The
underwater centrifuge pumping system
(S-BCSS) assists in lifting oil from the
field to the platform. It is installed externally to the well, on the seafloor.

expedite pump maintenance and facilitate replacement of pumps. This in turn
will lower operating costs, facilitate

remote intervention in the connected
wells, and eliminate the need for completion rigs, one of the most expensive

equipment to lease in the international
market, according to Petrobras.
Production from Espadarte field,
discovered in 1988, started in 2000 to
the FPSO Espadarte. The production also
includes the eastern part of Marimba
field. Petrobras said production to the
FPSO Espadarte peaked in 2003 at
45,000 bo/d.

Pirama
Petrobras developed Pirama field
with a cylindrical FPSO designed to
process 30,000 b/d of 44° gravity light
oil (Fig. 3). The field is in the SergipeAlagoas basin in Northeast Brazil and
lies in more than 1,200-1,600 m of
water.
Petrobras leases this vessel, the
world’s first cylinder-shaped FPSO from
Sevan Marine ASA. The vessel can store
300,000 bbl of oil and has a 3.6 million cu m/day compression capacity.

closer examination reveals the difference, which was confirmed when
the value of the rack teeth pitch was
measured.
Fig. 4 shows a more convincing picture of the different bottomhole sectors,

191K-214 MC-2 two-cone bit, with a

in Fig. 5, which shows the

Based on the experimentally confirmed assumption
of the existence of three
destruction sectors on the
hole bottom during drilling
with three-cone bits, we may
assert that all our considerations expressed in favor of
the bottomhole rack formed
by a single cone will be valid
for the bit with equal pitch
of the heel teeth for all cones.
Here, however, the following condition should be
taken into account. If it turns
out that N1 = N/3 and Δ1
= Δ/3, i.e., the integral part
of Zr value may be divided
evenly in three without
remainder, then the difference in kinematics of the three-cone
combination vs. a single cone will be
as follows: each cone, per revolution
of the bit, will slide three times for the
amount δ1 = δ/3 = Δ1·t, i.e., the skidding path, or slide, S = 3δ1 = Δ·t.
This means that not all heel teeth of
the cones will be subject to slide during
each revolution of the bit. Only those

At that, the slide path for the heel

As shown in Fig. 6a, the process
of slowing the cone rolling over the
well bottom rack associated with the
skidding of the teeth in the direction
of rolling along the line BB’ is conditioned by summing up of the rolling
(Frl) and sliding (Fs) forces, F1 = Frl + Fs.
The driving force F1 does not impede
but, on the contrary, promotes skidding
of the teeth down into the crater. This

≤0.5), the actual number of rack teeth
is the same (N). The difference lies in
the increase of the pitch of one of the
craters for the value δ = Δ·t, at slowed
rotation of the cone (Fig. 1b), shown in
Equation 15.
At the accelerated skidding, Za = N

process may be observed in hard and
soft formations.
Meanwhile, accelerated cone rotation
is associated with the teeth skidding in
a direction opposite the rolling along
the line AA’ (Fig. 6b). In this case, the
driving force F2 = Frl + Fs impedes the
teeth skidding and tends to destroy the
ridge between the craters.

Varying rock strength
At high rock strength, if there is low
torque at the cone, and consequently,
low rolling force, the sum of forces
F2 = Frl + Fs will not be sufficient to
destroy the ridge. The teeth will have to
slip along the line AA’, as shown in Fig.
6, and the cone will accelerate. A similar
result occurs when drilling at low axial
loads.
However, low rock strength promotes an increase in cone torque and
rolling force at the expense of greater
depth of the tooth penetration into the
rock. The ridge between the craters, under the impact of the force F2 = Frl + Fs
will be destroyed and the tooth will assume its movement along the line AA’’
(Fig. 6b). This movement will be provoked by the sum of forces F1 = Frl + Fs'
and will result, instead of acceleration,
in slowing down the cone rotation.
In other words, if considering geometric relationships of the well bottom
rack and the cone permits us to draw
this conclusion concerning the slowing
of the cone rotation, it should be valid
for rock of any strength. At the same
time, if the geometric forecast points
to accelerating cone rotation, it will be
valid for rock of high strength as well
as in cases when drilling is performed
at low axial loads. In low-strength rock,
the process of the cone rotation slowing
down is most probable.

Calculating Za
Thus, returning to Fig. 1 and taking
into account that the actual number of
the teeth of the rack Za, as distinct from
the estimated number, is an integral
value, we may calculate three values for
the number of teeth on a single cone.
Equation 12 calculates the number for
50

Three cones

A commercial B-190T bit with varied pitch of
the heel teeth in all cones rolled this steel bottomhole pattern (Fig. 3).

Passing from the single cone to the
three-cone combination and taking into
account Equation 7, we calculate the
actual number of teeth, Za, using Equations 17-20.
Considering Equations 17-20, we
see that, during drilling with threecone bits at Z1 = Z2 = Z3, formation of
the well bottom rack occurs with four
different values for the actual number
of teeth: N, N–1, N–2, and N+1 (N, as
mentioned before, is an integral part
of the estimated number of the rack
teeth):
• At Za = N, there may be pure rolling or a slowing of the cone rotation.
• At Za = N–1 or at Za = N–2 there
may be a slowing of the cone rotation.
• At Za = N+1 there will be acceleration of the cone rotation.

Factors, assertions

the pure rolling case; Equation 13 is
used for slowed skidding and Equation
14 is used for accelerated skidding.
These three equations indicate that
for a single cone, two values of the
actual number of the rack teeth are
possible. One value corresponds to the
integral part of the estimated number
of the rack teeth (at 0≤ Δ ≤0.5), while
the other is greater by one (at 0.5<< Δ
<1).
It is interesting to note that when
there is no skidding (when Δ = 0)
and at slowed skidding (when 0< Δ

Thus, the geometry of the well
bottom rack and the character of the
multicone bit’s cutter movement (in
particular, the three-cone bit with equal
heel teeth pitch), are determined by
three factors:
1. The relationship of the bit diameter and the gauge tip diameter of the
cones, i.e., by the value of the cone gear
ratio i at their pure rolling.
2. The number of the heel teeth on
each of the cones Zc.
3. Physical and mechanical rock
properties.
Consequently, we may assert that:
• If N1 = N/3, and Δ = 0, i.e.,
when the estimated number of the well
bottom rack teeth is divisible by three
without a remainder, then Za = N, Zr =
N, and Za = Zr. Since Za = ia·Zc and Zr

N+1, and Zr = N+Δ.
This means that Za
>Zr and ia>i, and the
calculation of ia is
shown by Equation
24.
As shown in
Equation 24, the
actual gear ratio for
the cones at Z1 = Z2
= Z3, N1 = (N–2)/3,
and 0.5<<Δ<1 is
greater than that at

This agrees with test-stand studies
of rock-bit kinematics with heel rows
made in the form of circumferential
teeth.7 These bits have an equal number
of heel teeth on all cones, Zc = 10. In all
drilling tests, the rack formed in the angular zone of the well bottom with 15
teeth (Za = 15), and the same number
of textural marks (grooves) was formed
on the well wall. Accordingly, the actual
gear ratio for the cones was ia = Za/
Zc = 15/10 = 1.5, confirmed by the
recorder.
It’s notable to mention that the
circumferential teeth form a more
conservative geometry in the well
bottom rack when compared with the
geometry formed by longitudinal teeth.
This means that if cones with longitudinal teeth can form the well bottom
rack with varying number of craters,
depending upon rock properties and
differing operational and technological
factors, then the cones with equal-pitch
circumferential heel teeth will form the

Although the US hurricane season of 2007 was essentially a non-event for the
petrochemical and refining
industries at large, Hurricane Humberto disrupted
operations for a few weeks
for ethylene producers in
the Beaumont-Port Arthur,
Tex., area during midSeptember to
early October. The important story for second-half
2007 was not Hurricane
Humberto, however, but
the persistent strength in
demand for ethane.
Specifically, feedstock
economics for ethane remained favorable and feedstock demand for ethane
consistently averaged 47-48% of fresh
feed during third-quarter 2007 and
48-51% during fourth-quarter 2007.
The persistent strength in ethane
demand limited coproducts yields of
propylene and aromatics to 85-95% of
year-earlier volumes.

tight throughout second-half 2007.

Oleﬁn plant feed slates
Ethylene industry demand for fresh
feed averaged 1.68 million b/d during
third-quarter 2007; demand was slightly lower in fourth-quarter 2007 and
averaged 1.66 million b/d. Demand for
LPG feedstocks (ethane, propane, and
56

n-butane)
averaged
1.21 million
b/d in thirdquarter 2007
and declined
to 1.15 million b/d in
fourth-quarter 2007.
Due to a
decline in LPG demand, ethylene producers cracked a somewhat heavier feed
slate in fourth-quarter 2007. Specifically, LPG feeds accounted for 69% of
total fresh feed in fourth-quarter 2007
vs. 72% of fresh feed in third-quarter
2007.
Typical seasonal factors resulted in
lower demand for propane and n-butane, but demand for ethane remained
robust during fourth-quarter 2007. Ethane’s share of total fresh feed increased
to 49.5% in fourth-quarter 2007 from
47.4% during third-quarter 2007.
Finally, ethane demand only fell below 780,000 b/d in September. Ethane
demand was lower in September due
only to Hurricane Humberto’s effect
on LPG crackers in the Beaumont-Port
Arthur area for a few weeks.
Table 1 shows trends in olefin plants’
fresh feed slates.
Based on projected ethylene industry
operating rates of 90-92% for first-half
2008, total demand for fresh feedstocks
will average 1.65-1.70 million b/d.
Total demand for LPG feedstocks will
average 1.15-1.20 million b/d during
first-quarter 2008 and will increase to
1.20-1.25 million b/d during secondquarter 2008. LPG feedstocks will
account for 68-70% of total fresh feed
during first-quarter 2008 and 70-72%
during second-quarter 2008.
Demand for ethane will remain
strong and ethane’s share of fresh feed
will average 47-48% during first-half
2008.

during third-quarter 2007 (about 3
days of production).
Propylene production from LPG
feeds was 1.39 billion lb in thirdquarter 2007 and was 120 million lb
less than production in second-quarter
2007. Propylene production from LPG
feeds slipped to 1.1 billion lb during
fourth-quarter 2007—almost 300 million lb less than during third-quarter
2007.
During fourth-quarter 2007, ethane
cracking remained strong while propane and n-butane cracking declined.
The sustained strength in feedstock demand for ethane was the most significant factor resulting in the 20% decline
in coproduct propylene yields from LPG
feeds during fourth quarter.
Propylene production from naphthas, condensates, and gas oils totaled
1.75 billion lb in third-quarter 2007
and was 98 million lb more than during second-quarter 2007. Coproduct
yields of propylene from heavy feeds
increased to 1.93 billion lb during
fourth-quarter 2007, which was 179
million lb more than in third-quarter
2007.
Unless ethylene industry operating
rates are significantly higher in first-half
2008 vs. second-half 2007, coproduct
yields of propylene will continue to
average 0.95-1.10 billion lb/month.

The economic outlook for olefin
producers for first-half 2008 began
with prices for two important crude
benchmarks (WTI and Brent) flirting
with the $100/bbl barrier. Acknowledging that EIA and other sources
remain focused on “seemingly bearish
fundamental considerations,” our crude
price forecast focuses on evidence that
the bullish trend remains intact.
First, crude buyers reacted very bullishly in October to Turkey’s decision to
send troops into northern Iraq following attacks by Kurdish rebels. Until
October, northern Iraq was relatively
stable and had experienced relatively
few disruptions, which have been commonplace in southern Iraq for the past
few years.
Furthermore, escalation of tensions
between Turkey and the Kurdish rebels
increases the risk of disruption of crude
supplies that flow through Turkey from
the Caspian Sea. Tensions between the
US and Iran remain high. The Bush administration, however, moved to defuse
some of the tension with its most recent National Intelligence Estimate that
declared that Iran was not attempting to
build nuclear weapons capability.

crude from the Middle East will remain
a significant consideration for crude
buyers and traders during first-half
2008.
Finally, refiners will complete their
late winter turnarounds and maintenance work by mid to late April and
refinery crude demand in the US will
increase 0.75-1.00 million b/d during

May and June. Crude buyers and traders will anticipate this typical seasonal
swing.
To accommodate the increase in US
crude demand, buyers have to boost
imports to 9.8-10.2 million b/d during second-quarter 2008 from 9.3-9.5
million b/d during first-quarter 2008.

are bullish considerations for crude

earlier.
Forecasts for ethylene production
costs for first-half 2008 are based on
WTI prices in the range of $100-110/
bbl for first-quarter 2008 and
$105-115/bbl during second-quarter
2008. Based on a strong seasonal
increase in unleaded regular gasolineWTI pricing differentials, regular
gasoline prices in the US Gulf Coast will
increase to $2.90-3.00/gal.
These forecasts set the economic
basis for feedstock prices including
light naphthas and propane. Ethane
prices will also tend to track the general
increase in feedstock prices during firsthalf 2008.
Ethylene production costs (full cash
costs) will be 50-54¢/lb for purity
ethane, 54-58¢/lb for propane, and
55-60¢/lb for natural gasoline. Rising costs will push spot and contract
ethylene prices higher during firsthalf 2008. By April or May 2008, spot
ethylene prices will increase to 65-70¢/
lb and contract prices will increase to
70-75¢/lb. ✦

Tanker market earnings for the half-year
ended September 2007
softened 25%, from
the same period a year
earlier and 10% from the
Tankers
prior 6 months. An early
upsurge at the start of
the period as the US built inventories in
advance of its summer driving season
gave way in May to softer-than-expected demand for oil and an oversupply
of tanker tonnage. Clarkson Research
Services Ltd. detailed the reasons behind these market movements as well
as offering forecasts of future market
direction in its Autumn 2007 “Shipping Review and Outlook: A Half-Yearly
Review of the Shipping Market.”
According to Clarkson data, the
tanker market, comprised of both

modern and early-‘90s VLCCs, modern Suezmax, modern Aframax, and
both dirty and clean products carriers, averaged $30,620/day in earnings
from September 2006 to March 2007,
a 10% decrease from the $34,025/
day seen March-September 2006. A
30.2% decrease in Suezmax earnings,
to $36,833/day, led the downward
momentum, with clean product tankers
being the only segment experiencing an improvement from the previous 6 months,
increasing 6.3%

combination of capital and operating

Of greater concern, Clarkson said,
was the downward trend in spot rates,
which left VLCCs earning $25,000/
day in October 2007, and Aframaxes,
$15,000/day.

other 8.4% increase forecast for 2008.
The active tanker fleet for vessels over
10,000 dwt increased by 171 ships over
the 6 months ending Sept. 1, 2007;
223 vessels delivered against 32 vessels scrapped. With demand remaining
sluggish, Clarkson sees fundamentals
as gradually moving against the tanker
market.
This article will detail some of the
other findings in a few of the numerous vessel categories covered twice each
year by Clarkson in its Shipping Market
Outlooks.

Market outlook
A combination of sluggish trade
growth and rapid fleet growth shaped
the tanker market for the 6 months
ending Sept. 1, 2007, according to
Clarkson. Clarkson cites the lack of both
significant hurricanes and shipping
market congestion as increasing slack
in the tanker market to a greater degree
than has been seen in several years.
Crude tankers of all categories lost
ground against 10-year average spot
rates over the six months. The spot rate
for 30,000 dwt clean product tankers also decreased to $17,765/day
from $31,737/day in the preceding 6
months. Rates for a 1-year time-charter
of the same vessel type, however,
slipped just 2%, to $23,000/day, according to Clarkson.
Ship values, by contrast, continued
to increase, with the value of 5-year old
Suezmax tankers reaching $95 million
from $82 million at the end of 2006.
The tanker order book stands at 40%
of the current fleet, but Clarkson balances the bearish implications of this
building rate by noting that 24% of the
fleet consists of single-hulled vessels
which will need to be phased out by
2015.

VLCC
On Sept. 1, 2007, the VLCC fleet
totalled 148.2 million dwt. The fleet
is expected to grow by a further 2.1
million dwt by the end of 2007. Lower
scrapping levels and increased deliveries
in 2008 will see the fleet reach 160.9

had increased to 75.4 million dwt. A
decreased scrapping rate and increased
deliveries will grow the fleet to 83 million dwt by the end of 2008, according
to Clarkson.
Aframax earnings fell to $32,984
during the 6 months ending Sept. 1,
2007. Time charter rates slipped 10.4%,
reaching $21,500/day for a 1-year
period.
Clarkson sees the 41%-of-fleet order
book in the Aframax sector as leading
to the same potential medium-term
oversupply of vessels expected in VLCC
and Suezmax vessels, noting that this
could be heightened by the potential slowdown in Bosphorus traffic as
planned pipeline projects in the region
enter service.

dam-Houston fell 20%, with HoustonFar East rates decreasing 18.2%. Rates
from Houston to Rotterdam for 5,000
tonnes fell 16.4%.
Persian Gulf-Mediterranean rates
were the only rates along a major
route moving against this trend, rising
0.9% (15,000 tonnes). Strong Iranian
methanol exports in the second quarter
of 2007 keyed this strength, while
Clarkson ascribed the overall softness
to increased US ethanol production
and midyear energy shortages in South
America.
As with the other tanker segments,
Clarkson sees 2008 fleet development
in chemicals as hinging on the market’s
ability to absorb a large number of
scheduled deliveries.

Products

LNG

Clarkson expects product rates to
rebound as the northern-hemisphere
winter progresses. Spot rates for clean
product tankers slipped below their
10-year average, falling to $17,765/day
by Sept. 1, 2007. End-2006 clean rates
stood at $30,685/day (Fig. 2).
Even so, average earnings for dirty
products carriers rose 4% year-on-year,
with an even bigger increase of 8.5%,
seen in the clean market.
On Sept. 1, 2007, the 10,00080,000 dwt product tanker market
stood at 81.2 million dwt, a 6% increase. With a 39.1 million dwt order
book, the vast majority of which is
due for delivery in the next 3-4 years,
Clarkson expects continued rapid fleet
expansion barring a large increase in
the scrapping rate.
Clarkson also expects an incremental
increase in the average size of the fleet.
Over the longer term, Clarkson pegs
the commercial prospects for the products fleet on whether or not product
demand increases year-on-year at a rate
sufficient to absorb the extra tonnage.

Clarkson described the 18 months
ending Sept. 1, 2007, as having slowed
somewhat in terms of new orders as
compared to the pace seen over the past
10 years; final investment decisions on
new liquefaction facilities having been
delayed globally. Contracts for 19 vessels
had been issued by Sept.1, with many
slots open for 2010 delivery due to the
slow in liquefaction investment. In total,
56 vessels are scheduled for delivery in
2008 and 43 in 2009. Any orders for
newly approved projects will be delivered from 2011 onwards.
Prospects for major growth longer
term, according to Clarkson, depend
on how successful Russian and Iranian
development plans end up being. Both
countries have more than 30 million
tonnes/year of liquefaction planned for
introduction by 2014, but have political
as well as the more typical economic
and technical hurdles to cross before
these come to fruition, says Clarkson.
Charter rates in the medium term
look relatively bleak, according to
Clarkson, the combination of project
delays and vessel deliveries likely leading to surpluses starting in 2011 and
lasting several years. ✦

New lithium cell suited for downhole use
The patent-pending MR125DD is a new
primary lithium cell suited for oil and gas
measurement-while-drilling (MWD) applications.
It is rated to a maximum temperature
of 150° C. but operates most effectively
between 75° and 125° C. The cell is an
addition to the Moderate Rate family of
products and is available in “DD” form
factor.
For those users who cannot specifically
affirm a maximum operating temperature,
this firm’s DDMR150 cell, rated to 150°
C., is available. The company says the 150’s
lithium thionyl chloride chemistry offers
great capacity when operating in the upper temperature range of 125° to 150° C.
However, for those applications operating
below 125° C., this new cell technology is
suitable.
The 125° C. cell provides 33% more
capacity in conditions below 125° C. at
higher discharge rates than traditional
industry standard lithium cells rated to

150° C., the company says. In addition, the
MR125DD has greater retained capacity
after prolonged exposure at higher temperatures, the firm points out. Although
optimal between 75° and 125° C., this
new product will operate safely in conditions up to 150° C. The 125° C. cell also
delivers exceptional pulse characteristics,
the firm notes. This new cell is suited for
an array of oil and gas applications including MWD, logging-while-drilling, and
pressure measurement.

Flow computer measures gas, liquids
The AutoEXEC multirun flow computer
and remote telemetry unit now integrates
measurement and control functionality for
natural gas and petroleum liquids applications.
The AutoEXEC enables users to standardize and consolidate measurement applications on as many as 32 runs with one

unit. It provides the speed and accuracy
required for a number of applications,
including custody transfer, the firm notes.
The unit has an update rate of 10 times
per second and incorporates built-in API
Ch 21.2 compliance for electronic liquid
flow measurement along with API Ch
21.1 compliance for electronic gas flow
measurement. In addition, the unit is easy
to install with no required programming,
and it is simple to operate and secure with
assigned user access levels for retrieval of
stored or polled data.
Built on a high performance 32-bit
processor, the AutoEXEC runs at more than
300 million instructions per second while
consuming minimal power. Scalable inputoutput gives users the flexibility to build a
customized system.
USB connectivity enables users to connect a flash drive, laptop, PC, or printer.

March 3 – 5, 2008 / Moody Gardens Hotel & Convention Center, Galveston, Texas

SUBSEA TIEBACK
Forum & Exhibition

PennWell invites you back to the 8th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition.
SSTB has become the premier event for one of the fastest growing field
development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March 3 – 5, 2008 in
Galveston, TX at the Moody Gardens Hotel & Conference Center. Over 2,000
people and 150 exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference.You can’t
afford to miss it.
As our industry confronts new challenges, it has never been more important
to submerse yourself in them. This year’s theme is “Subsea is here, the game
is changing.” As our game changes, the sharing of knowledge and collective
experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety,
and economics of the subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by
industry leaders. As in the past, only by participating in this conference will you
be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will not be published and no
Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room
stays inside the conference room. We hope you will join us.

From the Subscribers Only area of

Societe Generale
mess a reminder
of trading perils
The unfolding Jerome Kerviel drama
says much about cap-and-trade remedies
for climate change. Kerviel is the French
trader of stock indexes alleged to have
lost the venerable Societe Generale $7.2
billion through unauthorized transactions.
The bank thinks the 31-year-old Kerviel
masked his shenanigans by hacking into
its computers. The unraveling of his illicit
trade position, disclosed Jan. 24, may have

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s

aggravated global ﬁnancial turmoil. This is
not the ﬁrst time bonkers trading and unvigilant accounting have rocked institutions
that seemed to have their affairs under control. The names Metallgesellschaft, Barings
Bank, and Enron leap to mind.
Kerviel’s misadventure thus serves as
a reminder, not a revelation, of regrettable
truths: Where a lot of fast money can be
made from the buying and selling of something, someone always tests boundaries of
prudence if not law. And it’s in the nature
of boundary-testers to ﬁnd ways around
whatever controls may be in place.
To acknowledge the hazards of an
economically essential activity is not to
condemn trading as a practice. The hazards,
though, are good reasons to be wary of
trading as a tool of governance.
As governments hurl themselves toward
regulation of greenhouse-gas emissions, a
choice emerges between the direct taxation
of carbon and the state-sponsored trading
of emission allowances. Under the latter
option, which the European Union has
implemented for carbon dioxide, governments assign companies emission caps
calibrated to national targets. Companies
able to cut emissions to below permitted
levels sell corresponding allowances, or
credits, to above-cap emitters.
A market thus develops in tradable
emission credits, a market that grows as
governments lower the emission limits.
Cap-and-trade systems camouﬂage
the inescapable costs of cutting emissions
of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse
gases. Direct taxation of carbon, by contrast, makes those costs clear. It encourages the prospective cost-bearers to wonder
how much sacriﬁce they would need to
make before they might realistically hope
to inﬂuence global average temperature. It
thus raises questions about the wisdom of
governmental responses to climate change.
Because of the political expediency,
governments naturally favor cap-and-trade.
Can anyone guess which alternative traders, especially the rogues, might prefer?

Government action revitalizes markets
Fears of recession and unauthorized trading at an international French bank battered equity markets, forcing government action that caused US energy prices to
rebound in late January.
During Jan. 14-18, US stocks posted the steepest weekly drop since July 2002
after reports of lower-than-expected home construction, retail sales, and manufacturing numbers reinforced speculation that the economy is entering a recession. But
US markets were closed for holiday Jan. 21 during a large sell-off in global markets.
At ﬁrst the sell-off was attributed to fears that failing credit markets could drive the
US economy into recession.
But later Societe Generale said a rogue trader in its Paris ofﬁce had for months
made unauthorized trades that cost the bank some $7.2 billion. That prompted speculation that it was Societe Generale’s attempts to close out the fraudulent trades that
had rocked European markets.
Olivier Jakob, Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland, said, “Currency markets were
building some expectations that other central banks might follow in the footsteps of
the US Federal Reserve, but with Societe Generale creating doubts as to what triggered the equity rout, the chance of a more coordinated action on interest rates has
become more remote and the dollar index has been under pressure.”
On Jan. 22, the near-month crude contract dropped to $86.11/bbl in intraday trading before climbing back to just below $90/bbl in New York as the Federal Reserve
reduced its overnight lending rate by three quarters of a percentage point to 3.5%.
It was the ﬁrst time since Sept. 17, 2001, that the Federal Open Market Committee
changed the federal funds target rate outside of a regular meeting.
“When oil comes tumbling down, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pulls an emergency cut and when the Dow Jones Industrial comes tumbling
down, the Fed does the same,” Jakob said. “The Fed emergency cut came coincidently at the crucial time when West Texas Intermediate was starting to test the support of the previous correction and makes...a nice double bottom at $86/bbl.”
The crude futures price tumbled to a 3-month low below $87/bbl Jan. 23 as recession fears continued to ﬂail the market. But energy futures posted the biggest gains
in 3 weeks on Jan. 24 with the March crude contract jumping $2.42 to $89.41/bbl Jan.
24 on the New York Mercantile Exchange after President George W. Bush and Congressional leaders generally agreed to an economic stimulus package that will give
tax rebates to most US taxpayers.
The crude contract continued climbing to ﬁnish the week at $90.71/bbl Jan. 25 on
the New York market. “Markets continued to rally behind federal actions, and energy
was no different,” said analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc.
Since the start of 2008, oil prices have fallen 10% primarily because of US economic worries. While the US comprises 30% of total oil demand, Raymond James
said, “It is the developing world, particularly China, that is the key driver of today’s
oil demand growth.”
Natural gas outlook
Meanwhile, Raymond James analysts said: “In the short run, the US has very
limited, if any, ability to switch from crude to natural gas as a fuel source. This is
one of several factors that have helped provide us with conﬁdence that oil and US
gas prices will not average the typical 7:1 btu parity in 2008 or even in 2009. In the
long run (beyond 2010), oil and gas should eventually return to parity on a global
basis. There will be many forces that will ultimately lead us back to parity. The most
important and timely driver will be the build-out of a global LNG and natural gas
infrastructure [that] will include regasiﬁcation terminals, gas pipelines, gas storage,
and gas-ﬁred consumers in regions other than the US. For example, we just cannot
imagine China being willing to pay two or three times as much (per btu) for energy
than the US. The global gas build-out will happen. It is just a matter of how long it
will take to accomplish.”
Raymond James analysts said, “In addition to natural gas and LNG becoming a
more fungible global commodity, the next decade will likely see (1) an increase in
natural gas-ﬁred electricity generation, (2) a decrease in the use of oil as a heating
fuel, and (3) the ability to use natural gas as an automotive fuel source. The bottom
line for investors is that we do not believe that oil and US gas prices will be linked to
the typical 7:1 btu price parity ratio over the next few years.

Chavez shakes up PDVSA executive suite
In a move that could have implications for Venezuelan oil production, President Hugo Chavez, continues to tweak the leadership alignment within the country’s oil and gas industry and in its
national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA). He has
made several recent executive appointments and approved six new
members to the PDVSA board of directors.
Chavez retained oil minister Rafael Ramirez as president of PDVSA. Other members of the board are Ivan Orellana, who recently
became oil vice-minister; Asdrubal Chavez, refining, trade, and
supply vice-president; and Eulogio del Pino, PDVSA’s exploration
and production vice-president.
Ramirez, in turn, removed from the board the former head of
PDVSA’s production and exploration unit Luis Vierma; along with
Dester Rodriguez, Jesus Villanueva, Carlos Martinez, and Bernard
Mommer.
He also swore in six new members: Hercilio Rivas, recent
president of PDVSA’s research unit Intevep; Carlos Vallejo, previous
president of PDVSA’s natural gas unit; Ricardo Coronado, second
in command for exploration and production in western Venezuela; Luis Pulido, head of PDVSA’s oil services unit; Faddi Kabboul,
who has worked in the Venezuelan embassy in Washington, DC, on
oil-related issues; and Aref Richany Jimenez, an army general who
headed the state armament company.
While the changes are said to indicate Chavez’s desire to keep
his most trusted allies at the top of PDVSA, especially when production needs to be boosted, those removed from the board are not
necessarily out of favor.
To the contrary, Chavez last month appointed former oil viceminister Mommer as the country’s new governor at the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Mommer, a Marxist
mathematician, is considered a key architect of Chavez’s oil policy.
He served as consultant to Ali Rodriguez during his tenure as OPEC
secretary-general and initiated such policy changes as having the
company take majority stakes in most oil projects and raising taxes
and royalty payments.
Chavez’s changes in the PDVSA board follow a restructuring of
the state firm made in early August (OGJ Online, Aug. 7, 2008). At
the time, reports said that the changes gave PDVSA the responsibility of “participating in ventures intended for the sustained, organic,
and integral development of the country, including agricultural,
industrial activities.”

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND)
has pledged to continue the offensive until the Nigerian government enters into dialogue to deal with the volatile situation in the
Niger Delta.
It has dubbed the campaign “Operation Hurricane Barbarossa”
as the first stage of an “oil war” of sabotage on oil and gas installations. According to Nigerian reports, 115,000 b/d of oil production has been shut in over the past 4 days.
Shell said one security guard was killed and four people
wounded during the attack. “A section of the Greater Port Harcourt
Swamp Line at Bakana, Rivers State, was attacked,” Shell said. The
link is part of the Bonny Light crude system.
Chevron Corp. said there also was shooting around its Idama
flow station.
Oil companies in the area have evacuated staff from the area,
according to Nigerian reports, while security has tightened.
MEND claimed it is holding 27 oil workers who were kidnapped
in the Delta after their oil supply vessel was hijacked last week.
Nigerian President Umaru Yar’Adua has created a new Ministry
of Niger Delta, which will focus on development and peace in the
area. It will have two ministers to create environmental and youth
empowerment policy initiatives. The government has said there
would not be any duplication between the new ministry and the
Niger Delta Development Commission.
Nigeria has shut in about a quarter of its production following the sabotages, making Angola now the leading oil producer in
Africa.

EPA waives Texas-speciﬁc diesel requirement

The US Environmental Protection Agency temporarily waived
certain diesel fuel requirements that apply only in the state of Texas
following fuel supply disruptions caused by Hurricanes Gustav and
Ike.
Responding to a state request, EPA will allow the suspension of
the Texas Low Emission Diesel (TxLED) requirements until Sept.
30, but federal regulations for ultralow-sulfur diesel fuel having
maximum sulfur content of 15 ppm still must be met.
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality said the goal
of the TxLED rule is to lower emissions of NOx and other pollutants from diesel motor vehicles and nonroad equipment. TxLED is
part of the Texas federally approved State Implementation Plan that
was implemented in 2005.
The rule covers 110 counties in the eastern half of Texas, inMilitants attack Nigerian oil, gas installations

North Argentina discovery ﬂows oil near Chivil
Gran Tierra Energy Inc., Calgary, reported a stabilized flow rate
of 2,324 b/d of 43.8° gravity oil on a production test of Cretaceous Lower Palmar Largo volcanics and volcaniclastics at the
Proa.x-1 exploration well on the Surubi block in northern Argentina’s Noroeste basin.
The well, tested at 12,649-661 ft and 12,620-641 ft on a
35/64-in. choke, was drilled to total depth of 12,920 ft measured
depth. Water cut was 0.5%. A drillstem test in the same formation
at 12,694-713 ft yielded no flow.
The company, operator with 85% working interest in the
90,688-acre block, plans to begin a long-term test within a week
through a 31/2-in., 15-mile, 4,000 b/d pipeline to Gran Tierraoperated Chivil field on the adjacent Chivil block. Recursos Energeticos Formosa SA (REFSA), the provincial government company,
has 15% interest.
Gran Tierra, which carried REFSA’s drilling costs, will be reimbursed for all costs incurred during drilling from 50% of the net
production assigned to REFSA. Provincial royalties on production
range from 12% for up to 4.7 million bbl of cumulative production to 14% on 4.7 million to 9.4 million bbl to 16% for further
production.
Gran Tierra said the well’s results improve the prospectivity of
identified leads in the Surubi block and in the adjoining Chivil
and Palmar Largo blocks, where the company has 100% and 14%
working interest, respectively.

RWE ﬁnds gas in Disouq concession in Egypt
RWE Dea AG has discovered gas for the second time within the
South Sidi-Ghazy 1x-well on the Disouq concession in the Egyptian Nile Delta.
South Sidi-Ghazy 1x was spudded on Jul. 20 and reached a TD
of 3,188 m within the Late Miocene. The gas was found within the
Messinian formation.
“The well encountered a gas bearing interval of 24 m column.

Total SA will operate the Bemolanga heavy oil license in Madagascar with a 60% interest after signing a farm-in agreement with
Madagascar Oil SA.
The partners will use mining technology to develop the estimated 10 billion bbl of heavy oil in place. The onshore 6,500 sq
m license in western Madagascar was granted to Madagascar Oil
in 2004.
“During the initial appraisal phase, additional core drills will be
drilled to determine the license’s potential. A production pilot will
be set up in a second phase to confirm the development parameters

porosities in the range of 27%,” RWE said.
RWE Dea picked up the 5,375 sq km onshore block in July
2004. The prospect is based on a seismic anomaly within the Upper Messinian succession, which shows direct hydrocarbon indicators conformable with a four way dip closure at the top of the
Messinian succession in analogue to the North Sidi-Ghazy discovery, drilled by RWE Dea in 2008.
The company will go on to drill nearby exploration well North
West Khilala-1x to see if there is any more hydrocarbons in the
Messinian structure.
South Sidi Ghazy-1x well is the fifth well drilled by RWE Dea in
the Disouq Concession. It is 7.5-km south/south-west of the North
Sidi Ghazy-1x discovery.

Petrobras makes offshore ﬁnd with Iara
Petroleos Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) announced that an offshore
field, in the same block as the Tupi field, is expected to yield some
3-4 billion bbl of recoverable light crude and natural gas.
The Petrobras-led consortium, which also includes BG Group
and Galp Energia, completed the drilling of well 1-BRSA-618-RJS
and proved “the relevant discovery” of light oil in the presalt reservoirs.
“The new discovery…was confirmed by a cable test and revealed the existence of light oil, with specific gravity between 26°
and 30° API, in an area of some 300 sq km that has been very well
defined seismically,” Petrobras said.
The state-owned firm said that the discoverer well, called 1-BRSA-618-RJS (1-RJS-656) and known as Iara, lies in an area north of
Tupi, some 230 km offshore Rio de Janeiro. It is located at a depth
of 2,230 meter, and reached a final depth of 6,080 meters.
Petrobras said the consortium partners “will give continuity to
the exploratory activities and to the investments in this area via a
Discovery Assessment Plan to be submitted to the NPA, as provided
for in the Concession Agreement, in order to characterize the field
better.”
Petrobras, operator, holds a 65% stake in the consortium, while
BG Group holds 25% and Galp Energia holds 10%. ✦

said.
It believes that heavy oil will be crucial to supply world markets

Peru aims to meet half domestic oil needs by 2015
Peru’s state-owned Petroleos del Peru (Petroperu) has taken
the first steps toward becoming an oil producer again and aims to
produce enough to meet at least half of domestic fuel demand by
2015, according to Petroperu Chief Executive Cesar Gutierrez.
“Diesel consumption will continue rising in Peru at an annual
rate of 3.5%,” Gutinerrez told Spanish news agency Efe, adding that
demand will increase to 90,000 b/d over the next seven years from
the current 60,000 b/d.
“If we want to maintain our share of the market, we must produce 45,000 b/d because today we have 50% of the market,” Gutierrez said.
Currently, Petroperu must buy all the petroleum it refines from
private firms. It currently buys about 30,000 b/d, with some
24,000 b/d produced domestically, while the remainder is imported.

Processing

Gutierrez said the remaining 30,000 b/d of fuel needed to meet
domestic demand is supplied by Spain’s Repsol-YPF SA, which imports a percentage of the crude it processes.
“We buy it all at the international price and so what we want to
do is exploit our fields,” Gutierrez said.
To double domestic production, Gutierrez said Petroperu will
have to modernize the Talara refinery at a cost of $1 billion and
start production from the 12 blocks where petroleum exploration
is taking place.
“We are in six preexploratory lots with (Brazil’s) Petrobras and
(Colombia’s) Ecopetrol, and now we have won four offshore lots
and two other lots on land,” Gutierrez said.
According to Efe, Petroperu officially ended its petroleum exploration and production activities in 1996, when former President Alberto Fujimori’s administration privatized the remaining
lots the company had stakes in.
In 2006, when President Alan Garcia took office, he agreed to a
request from Gutierrez to allow Petroperu to find private partners
to fund petroleum and gas exploration and production, with the
state firm holding minority stakes in fields.
Under this arrangement, Petroperu formed partnerships with
Petrobras and Ecopetrol in 2006 to explore six blocks, and earlier
this month came to agreements with Norway’s Discovery, India’s
Reliance, China’s CNPC and Argentina’s Pluspetrol.
In July, Petroperu announced plans to invest some $50 million
for an extension to the 852-km Norperuano crude oil pipeline
that runs to the Pacific coast from fields in the northeastern jungle
region (OGJ Online, July 24, 2008). ✦

Iran, Ecuador sign reﬁning upgrade agreement

Japanese reﬁners to cut products output

Iran and Ecuador, both members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, signed a memorandum of understanding in the oil sector under which Iran will help refurbish and upgrade Ecuador’s refineries.
The MOU, signed in Tehran by Iranian oil minister Gholam
Hossein Nozari and Ecuadoran minister of mines and petroleum
Galo Chiriboga Zambarno, calls for the construction of an oil refinery to be co-financed by Iran, Ecuador and fellow OPEC member
Venezuela.
Nozari said the two oil ministers additionally agreed to construct a petrochemical production unit in Ecuador, while Zambarno said the two countries would establish an oil company to
implement the joint energy projects.
Their agreement also covers training of Ecuador’s oil industry
employees by Iranian experts and cooperation in maintenance on
Ecuadorean oil facilities.
Ecuador, the fifth largest oil producer in South America, currently has three refineries with a combined capacity of 176,000
b/d. The largest refinery in Ecuador is the 110,000 b/d Esmeraldas
facility on the Pacific coast.
According to the US Energy Information Administration, Ecuador
is a net importer of refined oil products: during the first half of 2007,
Ecuador’s Ministry of Energy and Mines said the country imported
86,000 b/d of refined products, while exporting 36,000 b/d.

Three Japanese refiners, who control some 35% of the nation’s
refining capacity, plan to cut their output by the end of the year due
to reduced demand for fuels.
Showa Shell Sekiyu KK will cut production by 4.4% for the remainder of 2008, while Cosmo Oil Co. will reduce output during
the fourth quarter—possibly by 2%.
Idemitsu Kosan Co. said it also would reduce output in the face
of declining demand in Far East markets, but has signed a contract
to export gas oil to Mexico (OGJ, Sept. 15, 2008, p. 48).
Idemitsu also plans to export gasoline to Mexico and now is
in talks with the Mexican government over specifications. “We are
telling them that Japanese specifications are fine (for Mexico),”
said Idemitsu sales director Seiji Fukunaga (OGJ Online, Sept. 10,
2008).

legal and transparent,” al-Olaim said.
Members of parliament had demanded an investigation after
state-owned Kuwait National Petroleum Co. (KNPC) awarded contracts worth $8.4 billion to Japan’s JGC Corp and South Korea’s GS
Engineering & Construction Corp., after a tender.
Al-Olaim also came under pressure from some parliamentarians
who alleged other violations, particularly in connection with the
award of a utility and offsite services package without a tender to
US engineering firm Fluor.
The main objections came from Kuwait’s Popular Action Bloc
which insists that the bidding process and awarding of contracts

must go through the Central Tenders Committee and that oil projects are no exception.
In August, al-Olaim refuted legislators’ claims of any wrongdoing in the award process for the al-Zour refinery project, and
said he would make some documents on the tenders available for
inspection (OGJ Online, Aug. 17, 2008).
Kuwait has announced plans to increase refining capacity to
1.415 million b/d from the current 930,000 b/d with the new
plant along with upgrades to two existing refineries. Al-Zour is
scheduled to start operating in 2012, two years later than initially
planned. ✦

Iraq resumes oil exports following storm

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

BP says WREP line remains shut in after conﬂict

Iraq has resumed oil exports following a storm that shut in the
southern port of Basra and the completion of repairs to the bombdamaged northern pipeline that carries crude from the northern
Kirkuk fields to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan.
On Sept. 15, Iraqi oil exports stood at some 1.53 million b/d,
up from 860,000 b/d the previous day, according to shipping
agents. But the flow of exports from Basra was still lower than the
normal average of 1.6 million b/d.
Oil flowed at 450,000 b/d via the country’s northern pipeline
system, while exports rose to 1.08 million b/d at Basra and the
nearby Khor al-Amaya facility as operations at both facilities began
to recover after a storm.
Oil exports at Basra slowed to 860,000 b/d on Sept. 14-15,
down from 1.68 million b/d on Sept. 13, according to shipping
agents. Officials stressed that the reduced throughput was due only
to bad weather.
“There is a storm in the south that has contributed to the delay
of exports,” said one official. “It’s just a storm, nothing else.”
Meanwhile, until the completion of repairs in the north, Iraq
had suspended shipments of crude oil along pipeline route since
Sept. 10 following an explosion on the line, according to government officials.
“A bomb hit a pipeline transporting crude to Ceyhan in Turkey
and halted exports on [Sept. 10]. The blast occurred in an area called
Hadhar,” said a spokesperson for the state-owned North Oil Co.

BP PLC said its trans-Caucasus Baku-Supsa pipeline, also known
as the Western Route Export Pipeline, remains shut a month after
its closure due to the conflict between Russia and Georgia.
“It was shut as a security precaution,” said BP spokesman David
Nicholas. “The situation remains unchanged,” he said of the line
which had been carrying some 45,000-90,000 b/d of Azeri crude
before the Aug. 12 shut down.
Last month, a BP spokesman said that efforts to restart the WREP
had been “put on hold until we can assess the impact of this conflict on the integrity of this pipeline,” (OGJ, Aug. 30, 2008).
The continued closure of the line adds to Azerbaijan’s export
problems as shipments of Azeri oil by rail across Georgia also remain halted after being stopped when railway bridge was damaged
during the hostilities.
Despite the continued delays in reopening the oil export links,
the region is still viewed as a viable energy corridor by neighboring governments and international oil companies.
Earlier this week, Tengizchevroil (TCO), the Chevron-led consortium developing the Tengiz oil field in western Kazakhstan,
made an agreement with the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan
Republic to transport oil by rail across Georgia.
TCO will send up to 2 million tonnes/year of oil (40,000 b/d,
on average) by barge across the Caspian Sea to Azerbaijan, according to a source at SOCAR, although volumes could eventually increase to 5 million tpy.
Analyst Global Insight interpreted the agreement as indicating

Reversing roles
What journalists think

Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
Ipsos Mori, the global research company, loves asking questions, and with
the economic downturn, job insecurity,
rising inflation, and record-high energy
prices, anyone who is anyone has an
opinion on the matter because it affects
his or her pocket.
So, when Mori asked this OGJ editor
to conduct an interview along with
Britain’s other oil and gas journalists,
I thought it was time to flirt with the
unknown and challenge my comfort
zone. The role reversal is particularly
odd as a journalist. Whether we make
the news or report the news is an interesting debate that will continue to rage
within academic circles, particularly as
the internet has fundamentally changed
how we communicate.
Becoming an interviewee, sometimes, is like being caught under a
very hot ray of sunshine; temporarily
blinded as a continuous stream of questions are fired seeking opinions, facts,
and information. Are people honest
when they are interviewed? Are they
influenced by their environment or
indeed the person asking the questions?
Although six years on in my career, I am still amazed at the reaction it
invokes: people clam up immediately.
They are afraid of being misquoted or
indeed quoted! Along with lawyers and
real estate agents, this profession doesn’t
receive many kudos in British society.
20

According to the survey, 61% said
high prices would be the most important issue for the oil and gas industry
over the next 12 months followed by
maintaining supplies (48%) and rising
costs (39%). Interestingly enough,
however, 39% of us said that the economic prospects for the oil and gas sector would stay the same over the next
12 months compared with 35% who
said it would improve and 26% who
thought it would get worse.
“We are not running out of oil.
What we are running out of is oil that
is relatively easy to recover,” said one
respondent. Stories about TNK-BP’s
recent operating difficulties in Russia
illustrate the increasing importance of
nationalism in the petroleum sector.
According to the report, 16% of journalists recognized supplier nationalism
as an important issue over the next
12 months. “There is a growing trend
around the world towards the nation
states wanting to hang on to their own
indigenous oil and gas,” said another
journalist.
And when it comes to British journalists judging companies, the most
important factor, for 84% of those
surveyed, is financial performance. That
is unsurprising considering that the
majors are reporting billions of dollars
of quarterly profits. This response was
down 2% on the answer given in the
2007-08 survey. Quality of management is the second most crucial parameter, according to 65% of those questioned, and 61% of journalists voted
for honesty and integrity. The change
for 2007-08 respondents was –4% and
–11% respectively.
We consider it very important to

access top executives for background
discussions and briefings, so please
make more time for us in your schedules! About 45% of us also said this
was very important for on-the-record
interviews.

Advice for PR personnel
PR personnel should take note: email
is the preferred way to communicate;
no one faxes these days. And 48% of us
(me included) still like a phone call. I
was surprised that 3% of those surveyed
said they liked hard-copy mail. In this
fast-moving environment, surely that
would be inefficient because any news
release would be old by the time it was
received.
Many small operators hire external
agencies to help them raise their profile
and reach out to journalists. The good
ones will study the market and the
media outlets to develop a strategy to
manage their client’s reputation.
Too many PR personnel continue to
fire information willy-nilly hoping to
get a mention for their client, sending
unsuitable content, without bothering to do the basics about that media
outlet. Research, research, research: OGJ
does not publish information about
boiler repairs! The large companies can
sometimes have this and in-house staff,
but 39% of us said it was less acceptable
to deal with an external media relations agency than a company’s in-house
media relations personnel.
It will be interesting to see how
many operators’ press teams will use
this information in the future to tweak
their communication strategies and
build their relationships with us.
That is a survey for another time of
course, and I will keep you posted. ✦

Venezuela was until recently the
only source of a unique fuel option that bypassed the traditional yet
capital intensive two-step conversion of
bitumen-extra heavy crudes(B-EHC) to
synthetic crude oil (syncrude) and then
to refinery products.
Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) and
its subsidiary Bitumenes Orinoco (Bitor) had shown that it was possible to
tap Venezuela’s enormous
reserves of bitumen in the
Orinoco Belt quickly via the
production of its proprietary fuel Orimulsion—a
70% bitumen and 30%
water emulsion with a surfactant exported as a boiler
fuel for power generation.
In 2003 major supply contracts had
been approved and signed for power
plants in Asia and Central America
where the pricing of Orimulsion was
then indexed to gas or oil, rather than
coal. Its positive use in Denmark and
the US Environmental Protection Agency’s report had established that under
adequate safeguards Orimulsion could
comply with all environmental legislation as well as any other hydrocarbon
fuel source.
The technical success of Orimulsion
as a fuel for Wartsila generators opened
up new horizons, with a new plant in
Guatemala designed specifically to be
used with the fuel.
As PDVSA declared in its 2003 filing to the US Securities and Exchange
Commission, the Orimulsion business
plan called for expanding its production
capacity through joint ventures to 19.5
million tonnes (300,000 b/d) by 2006
from 6.5 million tonnes/year (100,000
b/d) in 2003.
For PDVSA and the Ministry of the
Power of the People for Energy and
Petroleum (MPPEP) there was every
reason to feel proud of the 100%
Venezuelan breakthrough, a new fuel
option that after more than 15 years
had finally demonstrated its technical,
environmental, and pricing advantages
to a skeptical and demanding power
generation market.

Yet, its success was not to be. From
the apogee of PDVSA’s published 2003
expansion plan to the shutting down
of all production at yearend December
2006, Orimulsion was the target of an
unprecedented domestic attack carried
out through the public media by both
the Minister of Energy and the PDVSA
president. The final blow was for PDVSA
to renege on its long-term supply
commitments. The main strand of their
argument ran as follows:
• “It is more profitable for the Venezuelan state to use its existing B-EHC
reserves to produce traditional oil products such as blends or syncrude than to
make Orimulsion because….”
• “The market pricing and fiscal
returns of these are far superior to those
of Orimulsion because….”
• “Orimulsion was indexed to coal
so its price was kept to $7/bbl for its
bitumen fraction, and the fiscal revenue
was too low….”
• “Because there has never been
bitumen in Venezuela, Orimulsion is no
different from all other oil production,
and this proves that….”
• “Orimulsion was invented by the
previous energy authorities in Venezuela solely to discredit OPEC, devalue
reserves in the Orinoco Oil Belt to the
price of coal, and cheat the state of its
proper due in fiscal payments.”

Inherited options
Current PDVSA authorities inherited
two options for developing the Orinoco
Oil Belt: a $14 billion investment in
four upgraders that could transform
some 610,000 b/d of B-EHC into
500,000 b/d of 16-32° crude; and
more than 10 years invested in research
and development of Orimulsion, with
a capital investment of about $500
million in a 6-million-tonne production unit, a pipeline, and port facilities
at Jose, which could transform some
70,000 b/d of bitumen.1
Both options presented problems for
the new oil industry ideology:
• No production from the Orinoco
Oil Belt was counted in Venezuela’s
OPEC quota.

the OPEC quota. No power plant could
accept a long-term dependence on a
single source fuel subject to unilateral
supply interruptions. In addition, it
competed against OPEC members’ natural gas, which was also outside of quota
restrictions.
2. Orimulsion is not cost efficient. Actually it is a cheap fuel when indexed
against gas or oil. During1992-2002
Orimulsion had to establish its technical, environmental, and even shipping
credentials within a very competitive
market. Pricing was established using
coal as a reference, absorbing the cost
of cleaning up emissions.
Fig. 1 shows how Orimulsion fares
in theory vs. coal for newly built 750
Mw plants. All initial Orimulsion clients
operated existing fuel oil-coal plants
and profited from the market conditions to maintain Orimulsion pricing
at or near the value for coal (cif Japan).
This was the pricing scenario used to
justify closing down the Orimulsion
business.
However in 2003 the first major
long-term contract was signed whereby
Orimulsion pricing was established on
the basis of the comparative economics
of converting an existing fuel oil plant,
including installation of a new flue gas
desulfurization (FGD) unit vs. the cost
of generation from a new gas turbine
facility using imported gas.

Compared with coal and gas generation, this figure is a modest but significant incursion. Compared with other
new energy sources, its impact is better
judged by stating that the final withdrawal of Orimulsion from the energy
market had the same impact as if all of
the world’s geothermal or 13% of wind
power generation had been eliminated,
or in energy content as if 60% of ethanol for fuel production had suddenly
disappeared from the market in 2006.
The decision to foreclose such a relevant contributor to the world’s energy
needs had to be justified on much more
solid grounds than those here reviewed.
It is possible to tap quickly into bitumen reserves with low capital requirements and to obtain long-term contracts for power generation that value
the bitumen fraction at $30-40/bbl at
2007 energy prices.
Any new phase in the saga of this
type of fuel will require two incentives:
a push from B-EHC reserves owners
seeking faster and less capital intensive
outlets for their underground assets before they are devalued by competition
from other sources of energy and a pull

extensive damage. Two semisubmersible rigs that had been reported drifting
Sept. 13 later were secured by tugs.
MMS said, as of midday Sept. 16,
that 425 of the 717 manned production
platforms and 50 of the 121 mobile
offshore rigs in the gulf were still
without crews. MMS reported 95.9%
of the oil and 82.3% of the natural gas
normally produced from federal leases
in the gulf remained shut in. The US
sector of Gulf of Mexico accounts for
25% of all the oil and 15% of all the
natural gas produced in the US. As of
June, daily production from the gulf
amounted to 1.3 million bbl of oil and
7 bcf of gas. Since then, gas production
from the deepwater Independence
Hub facility increased, and in August
gas production from the gulf was
estimated at 7.4 bcfd.
Other reports of damage in the
gulf included:
• ExxonMobil Corp. reported only
limited minor damage to its offshore
platforms.
• ATP Oil & Gas said its Gomez

The company’s production at Canyon

The findings confirmed several
federal lawmakers’ suspicions and they
announced that they will try to make
stronger commodities regulation part
of any comprehensive energy bill that
is produced in the next few weeks. The
study also came out the day before the
US House Agriculture Committee plans
to hold a hearing on speculation and
oil commodities. The US Commodity
Futures Trading Commission also expects to issue what is now being called
a swaps report by Sept. 15.

Walter L. Lukken, that supply and
demand has been primarily responsible
for oil price movements. “The only supply and demand this report shows is the
supply and demand of money. As speculators pour more money into the energy
market, prices go up. As they pull their
money out, prices go down,” said Rep.

Bart Stupak (D-Mich.), chairman of the
House Energy and Commerce Committee’s Oversight and Investigations
Subcommittee.
“The evidence is undeniable for
consumers, policymakers, and everyone
who has a stake in our economy. I personally wonder how we can explain the

‘Unbelievable, unbridled
speculation’
“We have known for some long
while that speculators have played a role
in where oil prices have gone. We made
the case that unbelievable, unbridled
speculation has driven and then broken
the market. This report shows how
oil speculators controlled the market
while the federal agency which should
be protecting American consumers
has been dead from the neck up,” Sen.
Byron L. Dorgan (D-ND) said at the
briefing.
Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) said,
“This analysis illustrates that when oil
speculators poured large amounts of
money into oil markets, prices skyrocketed just as they hoped. It also shows
that when Congress began pressing
the CFTC and developing legislation to
end dark oil markets, speculators ran
for the exits and pulled $40 billion out
of the commodities market, dropping
the price of oil by about $40/bbl.
This is why I continue to hold up the
CFTC nominations and called for the
inspector general’s investigation into
the CFTC’s bogus reports that seem to
be pushing an agenda rather than the
truth.”
“Large numbers of dollars by a
very few investors have driven the oil
commodities market,” she said, adding,
“Many of us here have pushed the CFTC
to do its job. It has barely been an inch
in front of us.”
Other federal lawmakers also expressed skepticism about declarations
by the CFTC and its acting chairman,

Energy
compromises

W

ithin a few short weeks, the
potential for congressional
energy compromises, which looked
so bright at the beginning of August,
began to look increasingly tarnished.
Critics conceded there had been
progress because Speaker Nancy
Pelosi (D-Calif.) finally was letting
the matter come to a vote as the US
House prepared on Sept. 16 to debate
a bill that included expanded Outer
Continental Shelf leasing. The number
of US senators supporting a compromise proposal had doubled to 20
from the original “Gang of 10.”
But the proposals drew significant
fire. Florida Senators Mel Martinez
(R) and Bill Nelson (D) warned they
would fight the Senate’s current energy
legislation because it would overturn
safeguards that were part of the 2006
Energy Independence and Security Act.
Rep. John E. Peterson (R-Pa.), a
primary force behind a compromise
proposal with 137 cosponsors, said
on Sept. 12 that the Democratic
leadership’s bill HR 6899 makes the
first 50 miles offshore off limits, does
not share federal offshore revenues
with coastal states, and provides no
funding for environmental restoration or alternative energy research
and development.

Supply, demand in balance
now is trying to make sure phony
legislation isn’t passed,” he said.
In a Sept. 16 letter to Pelosi and
House Minority Leader John Boehner
(R-Ohio), National Petrochemical
and Refiners Association Pres. Charles
T. Drevna said HR 6899 “amounts to
nothing more than a political shell
game that threatens, not enhances,
the nation’s energy security.”
“Moderate members of Congress
should not be under any illusion that
this...is a proproduction bill,” he added.

Out to posture

Officials at the Interstate Natural
Gas Association of America agreed
Sept. 16 that congressional posturing
over energy continued. “While there
has been significant progress in terms
of offshore drilling, it’s still an election year, and both sides are trying
to preserve the issue,” Pres. Donald F.
Santa said.
Martin E. Edwards, INGAA’s vicepresident for legislative affairs, said
congressional leaders seemed to be
ignoring harder energy questions. “I
wonder when the two sides will start
to try and do something substantive
by dealing with energy comprehensively instead of trying to still please
one or two constituencies,” he said.
The main House and Senate bills

continued decline of crude oil prices
when so much Gulf of Mexico production and refining capacity remains shut
in following Hurricane Gustav,” said
Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro, who chairs the
House Appropriations Committee’s
Agriculture Subcommittee.

Masters said he and White used
information compiled by CFTC and the
US Energy Information Administration
as well as their own investment sources
for their report. “It is important to note
that during the first 6 months of 2008,
actual worldwide inventories for crude
oil were essentially flat: They did not
change. Therefore, supply and demand
were in balance during this time period. Clearly, supply and demand cannot
fully explain crude oil’s dramatic rise
and fall during 2008,” it said.
Neither can a weak US dollar, it
continued. In 2008, the currency never
weakened more than 7% but the price
of WTI rose by as much as 50%. “Note
that oil traders’ fixation with the US
dollar is prima facie evidence of the
‘financialization’ of commodities.
Most likely, the US dollar’s impact on
commodity futures prices comes not
through changes in real world supply
and demand (which would be seen as
actual supply and demand data), but instead through the inflow and outflow of
investment funds from foreign speculators,” the report said.
It suggested that the period from
the end of May to mid-July was pivotal
for commodity futures markets and
institutional investors despite positions
being reduced slightly and oil prices
rising further.
“But a debate was raging in Washington DC over the role that speculators
were playing in the rise of the price of
oil. There were multiple hearings in both
houses of Congress during this time, focused on the effect that speculators were
having on food and energy prices. There
were multiple pieces of legislation introduced that would have cracked down
on speculation. Both the Senate and the
House had substantial bills proposed by

the majority that made significant progress during July,” it said.
The report noted that the CFTC also
announced multiple initiatives and
investigations which were aimed at determining what role speculators played
in the rapid oil price increase. The commodities regulator made special calls on
swaps dealers for information related to
index speculation and other matters. It
also obtained agreements from foreign
regulators to increase reporting for
markets the CFTC doesn’t regulate such
as the InterContinental Exchange, the
study said.

AFR: E. Java mud ﬂow damage understated
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Santos Ltd. has rejected speculation
suggested by a Sept. 15 report in the
Australian Financial Review (AFR) that
said: “Santos is facing a blowout in the
clean-up bill from the world’s largest

mud volcano in East Java” because the
“disaster cannot be contained.” The article cited the United Nations Environment Program and AusAid, that it had
understated the severity of the Sidoarjo
mudflow incident in East Java.
“Santos is not in a position to comment specifically on the UNEP report,”

Concern led to pullout
“Although institutional investors
typically buy and hold investments for
the long term, it is likely that a number
of index speculators were concerned
enough by what was occurring in
Washington to pull their money out of
commodity index investments,” it said.
The report concluded that if Congress acts to restrict speculation, price
volatility will be reduced and food
and energy prices will cone down as
excessively speculative money flows out
of the markets. Cantwell agreed. “If we
saw the fear of better regulation drop
gasoline prices by 50 cents/gal, what
would true regulation do? We could see
prices drop to the $70-80/bbl level that
many oil company executives have said
is the real price,” she said.
“The American economy is being
killed by excessive prices these speculators create not only in oil, but in 22
of the 25 major indexes. The CFTC has
its head in the sand. Congress must
continue to propose regulations that set
forth position limits,” said Stupak.
“I think this confirms what many
of us have been concerned about. The
American consumer has been dangled
on a string. We know now where that
string leads. We also have a brain-dead
regulator which has not been doing its
job. Speculation repair clearly needs to
be part of comprehensive energy legislation and I intend to make that point at
the Senate’s energy summit this Friday,”
Dorgan said. ✦

The Russians
are coming

D

id anyone really think Moscow
would just sit still as Washington,
DC, and its allies attempted to extract
oil and gas from Russia’s backyard in
the Caspian and Central Asia?
Leaving aside Georgia, which the
Russians slapped down a few weeks
ago, there are other targets now
under Kremlin scrutiny. They include
efforts to influence the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, as
well as inroads into Latin America.
Russian Energy Minister Sergey
Shmatko, on a recent visit to Venezuela, said his country hopes to sign a
memorandum of understanding with
OPEC, as a first step in cementing a
closer relationship with the group.
Shmatko said the proposed MOU
is a very broad program of joint action in various areas of activity. For
instance, he said, it would include a
better interaction between Russian
companies and OPEC members.

Short on details
The Russian minister, who declined to impart very much by way
of details, said some aspects of the
proposed agreements might include
greater cooperation regarding overall
oil market analysis and information.
Lest anyone were getting panicky
over the proposed MOU, Shmatko
was quick to caution that closer ties
with OPEC would not affect markets
right away.
Russia doesn’t think that there
will be immediate agreements to
influence the price of oil, Shmatko
said, adding that the proposed MOU
is more related to an approach for a
strategic partnership, for a strategic
interaction.
Meanwhile, other Russian oil and
40

gas officials on their visit to Caracas
wasted no time regarding their country’s intentions toward Latin America
in general and Venezuela in particular.
“There are gas fields in the region
and one of the subjects for today’s
discussion is the companies’ plans
with possible participation of Russia
in the development of not only oil,
but also gas fields,” said Alexander
Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the
Board of Directors of Gazprom and
Director General of Gazprom export.

Long on plans
If there is a Monroe Doctrine
regarding Latin American oil and gas,
Medvedev made no mention of it.
To the contrary, he made clear that
Russia is ready to supplant the US in
terms of exploiting the continent’s oil
and gas reserves.
“The regional oil and natural gas
market in Latin America is developing
very actively both in Argentina and
Brazil, and with taking into account
the implementation of a large LNG
project in Venezuela, this means that
there will be no need as before to
link Caracas only with the American
market, regarding both oil and natural gas,” said Alexander Medvedev.
Indeed, noting that US companies
have vacated the region, Lukoil Vice
President Andrei Kuzyayev said the
two sides “are considering issues
linked with the establishment of a
joint venture with the state-run oil
and natural gas company Petroleos de
Venezuela on the recovery of heavy
and extra-heavy crude in the Orinoco
River belt.”
Yes, friends, look over the backyard fence. The Russians are coming. ✦

the Australian firm said in a statement.
“However, given the conditions at site
and current activities being conducted,
Santos believes that the provision
remains an appropriate estimate of its
potential liability associated with the
incident.”
At the same time, Santos acknowledged that matters could change because
“the situation remains dynamic, complex, and uncertain.” As a result, Santos
said it “will continue to review the
adequacy of the provision in light of developments and available information.”
The AFR referred to updated costs of
$830 million (Aus.), which it said “are
nearly 10 times higher than Santos has
disclosed to the stock market, leading to
accusations that the oil and gas major is
deliberately playing down the disaster.”
The paper said Santos has an 18%
interest in PT Lapindo Brantas, which
experienced drilling problems near the
site the day before the mud volcano
erupted.
“Presuming it paid 18% of mitigation costs,” Santos is facing a cleanup
bill of $355-829 million over the next
25 years, the paper said, citing the
UNEP report.
In its report, the AFR said that
impacts of the mudflow are increasing
and that the authors of the report envisage three courses of action to mitigate
them:
• Pipe the mud to the sea at a cost of
$1.9 billion over 25 years. But there are
concerns that the material is too viscous
and the pumps would not be able to
move the required volume.
• Pump the mud to a nearby river
at a cost of $1.9 billion over 25 years.
But there is strong local opposition to
this method and concern about the
increased flood risk.
• Build an open canal that would
slowly transport the mud to the sea at a
cost of $4.6 billion.
The study, commissioned by the
Indonesian government and carried out
by UNEP and AusAid, says transporting
the mud 14 km to the sea and creating
a new wetland is the only mitigation
option available. ✦

chemical units along the East Ethylene
Pipeline.
Capital expenditures for the East
Ethylene Pipeline are more than $13

billion. FACTS believes that the East
Ethylene Pipeline is unlikely to materialize due to many technical and commercial issues. The main commercial
issues are a lack of financial resources
and low profitability of the pipeline.
These construction plans for petrochemical plants in eastern and northeastern Iran are therefore less likely to
materialize compared with those in
western and southern Iran, according
to the report.
Domestic gas demand, especially for
new petrochemical projects, will continue to escalate because most of Iran’s
petrochemical industry is gas based.
The availability of enough feedgas for
the industry could become a problem
if the country continues to delay its gas
production projects, especially those in
South Pars. ✦

month at results from its first well in
Ordovician Utica shale in Quebec’s St.

While it describes the overlying Lorraine shale, as yet untested by Talisman,
as having the potential to be just as
prospective as the Utica, the company
describes the play as “unproven.”

Talisman plans to drill three more
wells by the end of 2008.
The company reported a sustained,

raine shale intervals (Fig. 2).
Even though Talisman holds industry’s largest land position in the play for
gas in the two Quebec shales, the company’s projected timeline doesn’t call
for it to enter the development phase
there until late 2010.

Talisman and shales
The Quebec shales are the least
evaluated of several North American
onshore gas and oil shale plays that
Talisman chose to pursue as it refocused
in May 2008.
The potential in Quebec, however, is
quite large. Talisman estimated 48 tcf of
original gas in place in the formations,
and the gas content per square mile
compares favorably to gas content in the
other shale plays in which the company
is involved (Tables 1 and 2).
Eastern Canada consumers, most
of their gas shipped 2,200 miles from
western Canada, would certainly welcome the development of a substantial
local supply.
Talisman said in May that it would
spend $1.1-1.3 billion through the end
of 2009 evaluating a material part of
the gas potential in its 2.5 million net
acres of unconventional land in North
America. Of the total, it budgeted $900
million for development programs in
areas where the company experienced
early success, including 200 wells in
the Western Canada Outer Foothills
and Devonian Montney shale gas plays
and the US Williston basin Bakken
shale oil play.
Another $420 million is earmarked

to drill pilot areas in other parts of the
Outer Foothills and Montney, Quebec,

“By the end of 2009, we will be

able to make informed choices about
ongoing levels of investment into our
unconventional resource plays,” Talisman Energy said. ✦

Shell completes Bonga deepwater 4D survey
Royal Dutch Shell PLC’s Nigerian
subsidiary completed 4D seismic acquisition over deepwater Bonga oil and gas
field off Nigeria in an effort to maximize ultimate recovery from the field.
The effort, which the company
described as the first 4D survey in
Nigeria’s deepwater region, started with
a baseline 3D seismic survey in 2000.
That information guided the siting and
drilling of early wells and other relevant
activities.
Shell started production from the
field in more than 1,000 m of water in
late 2005 and was to quickly ramp up
output to 225,000 b/d of 30° gravity
oil and 150 MMcfd of gas (OGJ, Dec.
12, 2005, Newsletter). The field, now
with 16 subsea oil producing and water
injection wells, covers 60 sq km about
120 km offshore.
The most recent work, carried out
by a Lagos contractor, took 76 days and
involved one marine seismic vessel and
three support vessels. The data, collected after 2 years of production, are
expected after further processing and

interpretation to reveal how reservoir
conditions and fluid content have
changed and result in better placement
of subsequent wells, Shell said.
Marine 4D seismic data acquisition
operations, especially those involving
close passes of fixed installations, are
technologically complex and involve
several high-risk activities including
operating air guns and towing long
streamers with close passes to fixed
installations, Shell said.
The four vessels with 100 people recorded 133,000 man-hr without a lost
time injury, and 40% of the onboard
personnel were Nigerians. Shell staff
used the opportunity to gain valuable
deepwater 4D experience.
Other firsts for Bonga field include
one of the world’s largest floating production, storage, and offloading vessels
at 2 million bbl capacity, the first iconel
clad steel catenary risers on an FPSO,
and the world largest and most sophisticated FPSO mooring buoy 23 m in
diameter, 12 m high, and weighing 870
tonnes. ✦

US, Canada to map unexplored Arctic seaﬂoor
The US and Canada will jointly map
the unexplored Arctic seafloor where
the two countries may have sovereign
rights over oil, gas, and other resources,
the US Geological Survey announced.
The US Department of the Interior
agency said both countries will use
resulting data to establish the continental shelf’s outer limits under criteria
in the Law of the Sea Convention. The
extended continental shelf, the seafloor,
and subsoil beyond 200 nautical miles
from shore that meet those criteria are
of great scientific interest and could
represent potential economic development, it noted.
The collaboration will use two ships,
USGS said. It said that it will lead data
collection from Sept. 6 through Oct. 1
on the US Coast Guard cutter Healy to
map the seafloor. The Geological Survey
of Canada in that country’s natural
resources department will follow on

the Canadian Coast Guard ship Louis S.
St. Laurent and study the subseafloor’s
geology.
“The two-ship experiment allows
both the US and Canada to collect and
share complementary data in areas
where data acquisition is costly, logistically difficult, and sometimes dangerous. Both countries benefit through
sharing of resources and data as well
as increasing likelihood of success by
utilizing two icebreaker ships in these
remote areas of the Arctic Ocean,”
noted USGS scientist Deborah Hutchinson, who will sail aboard the Louis.
Jonathan Childs, another USGS scientist who will be chief aboard the Healy,
said that effort will use an echo sound,
which emits sound signals in the water,
to map the seafloor using a multibeam
bathymetry system.
“Unlike conventional echo sounders, which measure the water depth at

a point directly beneath the ship, the
multibeam system collects a ‘swath’ of
depth information about 3 km wide
along the ship’s patch, creating a threedimensional view of the seafloor,” he
explained.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration funded US participation in the US-Canadian mission
and collaborated with the University of
New Hampshire to collect bathymetric
data in the Arctic Ocean from onboard
the Healy from Aug. 14 through Sept. 5,
USGS said. ✦

Deployment of artificial-lift systems
throughout the Middle East
continues to grow rapidly, especially ESPs. In many other parts
of the world, operators install
ESPs in wells producing from
nearly depleted reservoirs. In
the Middle East, however, ESPs
are in wells that produce from
reservoirs that are far from depleted.
These installations provide a means
to increase production rates and improve recovery. For instance in Saudi
Arabia, Saudi Arabian Oil Co.’s (Aramco) aggressive goal is to recover in excess of 50% of the original oil in place,
a recovery factor much higher than the
industry average.
In fewer than 3 years ago, fewer than

frequency. As the technology matures
further, it is likely that these systems
will incorporate more autonomous
control functions.

ESPs
One goal of companies is to extend
the run life of an ESP. Severe operational
and environmental conditions,however,
often cause an ESP to fail, which in
turn interrupts production and leads to
expensive workovers.
An ESP system may encounter many
problematic elements, such as:
• Proper pump design and redesign.
• Corrosive environments caused by
sour gases and microbiological elements.
• High associated gas production.
• Solids produced during pumping.

GUIDE TO
WORLD CRUDES

Saxi-Batuque
crude assayed

StatoilHydro has
conducted an assay of
the Saxi-Batuque blended
crude, which is part of
the Kizomba C developRefining
ment project on Block 15
off Angola. ExxonMobil
Corp. began production from Saxi and
Batuque fields in mid-August 2008
(OGJ, Aug. 18, 2008, p. 8).
Production from the two fields,
along with Mondo (assay in OGJ, Mar.
24, 2008, p. 54), which started production in January, is expected to reach
200,000 b/d later this year. Output
from Block 15 will be 700,000 b/d
when Saxi and Batuque fields reach
peak production, ExxonMobil said.
Kizomba C, which is designed to
develop 600 million bbl of oil from the
Mondo, Saxi, and Batuque fields, lies in
2,400 ft of water (OGJ, Jan. 21, 2008,
p. 8).
StatoilHydro, a partner in the development, described Angola as a key
building block for its international
production growth. So far its nine
producing fields contribute more than
200,000 b/d of equity production. It
holds a 13.33% stake in Block 15.
Block 15 is operated by ExxonMobil,
holding a 40% stake. Its other block
partners are BP 26.67%, and Eni Angola
Exploration BV 20%.

Adjustments to a pipeline’s cathodic-protection
program can help address possible hydrogen
diffusion brought about
Pipelines
by nonconformance with
welding procedure specifications (WPS) during construction.
Low-hydrogen welding processes
like gas metal arc welding (GMAW),
flux-cored arc welding (FCAW), or
where necessary selection of lowhydrogen shielded metal arc welding
(SMAW) consumables are required for
joining high-strength steel pipeline material, particularly if the structure is also
protected by cathodic protection.
Deep-digging arc characteristics
of cellulose-coated electrodes allow
better weld metal penetration and
arc control in varying welding positions as compared with other available
pipeline welding processes. The use of
cellulose-coated electrodes, however,
increases hydrogen content in the weld
metal, conflicting with requirements
for low-hydrogen weld metal during welding of high-strength steels.
Increased demand for higher-strength
steels has heightened the importance
for controlling diffusible hydrogen
levels in weld metals.
This article examines resolution of
this problem in one pipeline project.

semiautomatic welding processes for
construction, and a combination of
FCAW and low-hydrogen SMAW for
repairs, tie-in, and welds that could not
be completed semiautomatically.
Except for the FCAW process, all
weld processes had a certified diffusible hydrogen content of 4 ml/100
g of weld metal. The FCAW process
accepted a maximum diffusible content
of 8 ml/100 g of weld metal, in line
with American Welding Society AWS
A5.29 and AWS A5.20 requirements.
Construction lasting several
months required cathodic protection
of any pipe lying in soil for long periods between installation and start
of operations. Cathodic-protection
installation occurred in two phases:
• A temporary CP system with sacrificial anodes to provide external corrosion protection during construction.
• A permanent system with an impressed current to protect the pipeline
for its design life (acceptance criteria
for CP polarization of –0.95 v to –1.5
v).

Construction of a 1,000-mile large
diameter gas pipeline involved major
river crossings, steep rises in elevation,
and passage through environmentally
sensitive areas.
Measures taken to reduce construction’s effect on the environment
included applying 3 LPE coating to the
pipe and providing both completed
sections and the finished pipeline with
cathodic protection.
The pipeline used API 5L X-70 PSL2
line pipe, with an average yield strength
greater than 79,000 psi.
The pipeline’s operator asked its contractors to use a low-hydrogen welding process. These contractors qualified
the welding procedures with a GMAW

This released potential energy, if not
absorbed by the ductility of the material, exceeds the yield strength of the

theory, proving the isotope effect in the
activation energy is due to hydrogenatom zero point vibration at an interstitial site.
MET-HEAT also considered the additional hydrogen evolved through
cathodic protection, in excess of the
hydrogen present in the weld metal.
Atomic hydrogen evolves as the natural
reaction product of both corrosion and
cathodic protection. The partial cathodic
reaction 2H+ + 2e → H2 shows the
evolution of hydrogen gas.
Review of the specifications led to
limits on adding additional hydrogen
beyond what was present in the weld
metal. Redesigning the polarization current for cathodic protection limited the
evolution of excess hydrogen, consistent with NACE RP 0169 Sec. 6, Para.
6.2.2.3.4.1
Initial project design defined
cathodic-protection requirements in
the range of –0.95 v to –1.5 v. for the

the close interval potential (CIP) survey data for the quarantined section of
pipeline be reviewed for any possible
changes in an effort to reduce the
hydrogen evaluation for this section of
the pipeline.
CIP survey data supported making
special conditions for this section of
the pipeline, adjusting the impressed
polarization current to a range of –0.85
v to –1.1 v.2
The pipeline operator asked the CP

snug fit. The integrated, one-piece cloth
head strap with buckle is fully adjustable
to fit any head size.
Respirators provide protection against
a variety of contaminants and are available
in three versions: PeakFit (filtration against
aerosols free of oils below permissible exposure limit), PeakFit OV (additional filtration against aerosols free of organic vapors
below PEL), and PeakFit AG (additional
filtration against aerosols free of organic
vapors and acid gases below PEL).

THE REMAINDER

September 30 – October 2, 2008
Hilton Fort Worth
Fort Worth, Texas USA

UNCONVENTIONAL GAS EXTRACTION BECOMING VIABLE
Production from unconventional reservoirs — tight gas sands, shales, and coalbeds--accounts for a large and growing share of total gas
supply. But the reservoirs are complex. The costs of drilling into and completing wells in them are continually rising while presenting unique
environmental problems. Producing gas from unconventional reserves proﬁtably, safely, and in amounts demanded by the market requires
increasingly sophisticated recovery methods.
Gas recovery from unconventional reserves will be explored on September 30 – October 2, 2008 at the
Unconventional Gas International Conference & Exhibition to be held at the Hilton Fort Worth, in Fort Worth,
Texas. Planned by the editors of Oil & Gas Journal and an Advisory Board of industry experts, the event will
highlight innovation from unconventional gas plays around the world.

Warming political
menu gets new item:
eggplant, well done
The sacriﬁces people have been called
to make in response to global warming
have become tangible in a new way.
The leader of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
suggests omnivores give up meat.
In a Sept. 8 speech in London, Rajendra
Pachauri said greenhouse gas emissions
(GHGs) associated with livestock production represent 80% of all agricultural

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e

emissions and 18% of the emissions from
human activities.
“The average household would reduce
carbon dioxide emissions by more if they
halved their meat consumption than if they
halved their car usage,” said Pachauri. “If
everyone in the UK abstained from eating
meat for 1 day a week, this would…result
in greater carbon savings than taking 5 million cars off the road in the UK.”
The IPCC, from research based on
climate modeling, champions aggressive
precaution against catastrophic warming.
It shared a Nobel Prize with former US
Vice-President Al Gore for calling attention
to the threat.
IPCC’s work often is cited as evidence of
a scientiﬁc consensus that warming results
chieﬂy from human activity and that aggressive response is necessary.
The standard proposal is a drastic cut in
use of fossil energy. Now Pachauri, because
of his stature as a Nobel Laureate, has
placed reduced meat consumption prominently on the menu of possible warming
remedies.
He told his London audience that GHGs
from livestock production come from land
deforestation and desertiﬁcation (35.4%),
manure (30.5%), animal ﬂatulence (25%),
agricultural fertilizers (3.4%), on-farm fossil
energy use (1.2%), and other factors (3.6%).
“One kilogram of beef is responsible
for the equivalent of the amount of CO2
emitted by the average European car every
250 km and burns enough energy to light a
100-w bulb for 20 days,” he said.
Producing 6 oz of beef steak requires six
times the energy and emits 25 times the
CO2-equivalent GHGs as producing 1 cup of
broccoli, 1 cup of eggplant, 4 oz of cauliﬂower, and 8 oz of rice.
As a vegetarian, Pachauri might not
appreciate the political implications of his
comparison’s implied summons to sacriﬁce.
The steak tastes immeasurably better
than anything else on his list.

OPEC promises ‘strict’ compliance
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed Sept. 10 to strictly
comply with their September 2007 production quota of 28.8 million b/d, implying a
possible compromise for de facto reduction of some 530,000 b/d of overproduction.
OPEC’s decision requires some adjustment of individual members’ quotas to
include new members Angola and Ecuador and the withdrawal of Indonesia, a
member since 1962. Iraq, of course, remains exempt from the OPEC quota as it tries
to rebuild its oil industry. Indonesia’s exit and addition of Angola and Ecuador make
“for a statement as clear as mud and for wide interpretations as to the desired level
of OPEC production,” said Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland. He noted
“mainly two countries” producing above quotas, Iran by 280,000 b/d and Saudi Arabia by 510,000 b/d, while Nigeria and Venezuela are below quota. “The most likely
scenario we see is for Saudi Arabia to make a slight cut (about 300,000 b/d) and to
readjust depending on the output from Nigeria,” he said.
A preliminary estimate by KBC Market Services, a division of KBC Process
Technology Ltd. in the UK, puts OPEC’s July production nearly 900,000 b/d above its
ofﬁcial quota, “of which by far the largest portion (757,000 b/d) comes from Saudi
Arabia.” KBC analysts said, “The excess output from Saudi Arabia consists of the
two production increases they announced in the middle of this year, amounting to
550,000 b/d, plus some extra production.” They said Venezuela’s actual production is
80,000 b/d below quota—“a symptom of Venezuela’s production crisis.”
‘Soft’ $100/bbl ﬂoor
KBC analysts said OPEC ministers were “concerned that a move below $100/bbl
could turn into a serious price retreat reminiscent of the 2006-07 fall in crude prices,
which saw a high of $78/bbl in August 2006 slide down to $52/bbl in January 2007.
OPEC’s response then was 1.7 million b/d of production cuts, and prices rebounded.
Today, the fragility of the global economy means that drastic production cuts are not
possible without risking further demand destruction and economic pain.”
Saudi Arabia “would be perfectly happy” with prices of $90-100/bbl but “other
OPEC members wished to give a stronger signal,” said Paul Horsnell, Barclays Capital Inc., London. “For those members, it appears that the $100 level is shaping up as
a sort of ‘soft ﬂoor’ or ‘alarm bell’ which, while triggering price-defensive actions,
might not be perceived as the level where all available policy tools should be drawn
upon. In that sense, OPEC’s entering a price defense mode is the key signal.”
He said, “On one hand, Saudi Arabia would seem to have more ability to defend
prices now than ever before. The Kingdom is producing at a high level, and at the
least the ﬁrst 500,000 b/d that could come off the market would be purely at Saudi
discretion. In other words, there would be expected to be considerable credibility in
the ability to defend prices.” However, Horsnell said, “The current oil market has very
pessimistic sentiment, is almost totally focused on the demand side and is strongly
affected by momentum investors. It might (indeed surely will), ultimately prove to
be as much of a [pointless] ‘Charge of the Light Brigade’ experience as taking on
Saudi Arabia to the upside proved, but we feel that the market might well try to push
below Saudi Arabia’s comfort levels,” Horsnell said.
Demand declines
Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency in Paris lowered its global oil demand forecasts by 100,000 b/d to 86.8 million b/d for 2008 and by 140,000 b/d to 87.6
million b/d for 2009. “The data suggest that the demand impact of weaker economic
conditions and high prices during the summer—when oil prices reached an all-time
peak—was more marked than expected, notably in the US. Furthermore, the effects
of the ongoing hurricane season on US demand are subject to considerable uncertainty,” the IEA said.
However, Jakob charged that the IEA “has been a main component in the making
of the oil price bubble” by “grossly overestimating demand growth.” He said, “Over
the last 3 months, the IEA had to revise down Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development demand in the second quarter by 800,000 b/d but has not
made any correction to demand for the fourth quarter.” Moreover, he said, “Most
forecast agencies have not fully realized that the US turned during 2008 from a net
importer to a net exporter of middle distillates, the consequence being that they are
double counting demand and will necessarily have to make further downward correction to OECD demand in months to come.”

Frac advances key to unconventional
gas supply growth

A

dvances in production stimulation technologies have
been critical to the meteoric growth in unconventional gas supply.
The unconventional gas share of US natural gas
supply has surged to more than 40% today from less than 7%
in the late 1970s, when government-sponsored research into
unconventional gas technologies got underway. Some have
predicted that the unconventional gas market share could top
50% in 2025–30.
Today, improvements in well fracturing technology have
been instrumental in gas shales emerging as the hottest hydrocarbon play in North America. Advanced fracturing techniques
are also playing a key role in recovery of natural gas from tight
sands and coalbed methane (CBM) as well.

Gas shales

may become a scarce resource, so techniques that will improve the fracturing placement in the areas where reservoir
engineers want it will have the potential to reduce treatment
sizes signiﬁcantly.”
The biggest production driver for shale formations is the
completion, according to Bill Grieser, Halliburton’s Oklahoma
City-based technical analyst.
“This requires a reverse engineering approach,” he notes.
“The ﬁnal well operation — the completion — must be the initial consideration in order to design all of the other components
involved in producing the resource.”
Grieser notes that it is difﬁcult to achieve commercial
production from nano-Darcy rock without the substantial increase in surface area that can be generated by complex hydraulic fractures.
This is why industry seeks brittle shale rather than ductile
shale as potential producers, he adds: “Calculations indicate
it takes 1 to 2 million sq ft of surface area to generate the >1
MMcfd gas rates.”

It is well known that hydraulic fracturing is the major enabler to
convert nano-darcy reservoirs into proﬁtable plays, notes Don
Conkle, Schlumberger vice-president, stimulation services.

end of the treatment—and thus unconnected to the conduit
from the reservoir into the wellbore.”
Conductivity enhancement is achieved with specialized chemistry that coats the sand grains and causes rearrangement such that
bed porosity and permeability increases, according to Ekstrand.
“The distribution of sand is increased in height, and the
proportion of the created fracture area that is propped open at
the end of the treatment is increased,” he notes. “The result
is a more efﬁcient production conduit into the reservoir and increased longevity of fracture conductivity for a given job size.”
Another advance in fracturing technology involves simultaneous fracturing, or simulfracing, multiple wells.
“The beneﬁts [of simulfracing] to the reservoir are the higher hydraulic horsepower delivered per volume of rock, resulting
in a larger, more complex fracture network,” Grieser says. “The
beneﬁt to the operator is completion of two wells in a shorter
period of time.
“The drawback is the extra effort required from both the operator and service company to mobilize two to three times the
equipment, manpower, and materials and orchestrate a continuous operation without delays or breakdowns.”
Early production analysis of more than 100 simulfraced wells
has shown, on average, a production increase vs. conventional,
single-well treatments, he cites. Late-time production is not yet
available to determine the effects of linked fracture networks.
Among the new techniques and new technologies being
brought to bear on the challenges posed by gas shales is that
of ﬁber optic cable being used to provide a real-time temperature proﬁle during the fracturing treatment to determine frac
position and placement efﬁciency along the horizontal wellbore, says Grieser: “Fiber optic cable can also be used during
production to determine areas of high productivity and areas
that need restimulation.”
The Halliburton analyst also foresees increased use of salttolerant fracturing chemicals that allow the reuse of returned
frac water and the implementation of mechanical, chemical,
and operational diversion techniques to refrac horizontal wellbores that drive creation of new fracture paths.
In addition, operators are looking at the “shale oil window”
as potential shale targets that previously have been avoided in
favor of dry gas, Grieser notes.
Just as important are industry’s improvements in the environmental footprint of fracturing operations.
Drilling pads containing multiple extended-reach wellbores
drilled and completed from the same location help reduce that
footprint, according to Grieser.
“Smaller location size may drive the industry to compact
completion/drilling equipment, including coiled tubing and
skid-based fracturing equipment,” he says. “This will force
the hydraulic horsepower, water, and proppant to be delivered to the formation in a focused manner, normally called
pinpoint stimulation.”
Water management is also a crucial environmental issue,
as this natural resource becomes increasingly scarce and and

more costly each year.
“Water storage and disposal cost has gone from $1.00/bbl
to $6.00/bbl in the past 8 years,” Grieser points out. “It now
competes with drilling and completion costs as one of the major cost items. The industry is under pressure to recycle, reclaim, and reuse this valuable resource.”

Tight sands gas
Although exploitation of tight sands gas has taken a back seat
to the hot shale gas plays, tight sands gas nevertheless accounts for one-third of US gas production and reserves.
Ekstrand contends that the game-changing production stimulation technique for tight sands gas “will center on eliminating damage of the fracture wall with viscosiﬁer technologies
that dramatically increase viscosity yield of materials, so signiﬁcantly smaller amounts of foreign material are injected into
the reservoir.”
Such systems will have a much higher viscosity-to-polymer
weight ratio and ﬂatter viscosity proﬁle, meaning longer life of
the viscosity, he adds.
“Similarly, improvements in ﬁlter cake degradation/removal
technologies will improve productivity by minimizing skin effects of the ﬁlter cake on the fracture wall for increased productivity and longevity.”

Coalbed methane
Two Denver-based Halliburton experts—Mike Mullen, principal
technical professional, and Kumar Ramurthy, technical professional-team lead—advocate a “holistic” approach to understanding and effectively stimulating CBM reservoirs.
Such an approach has ﬁve main components, they say:
“The ﬁrst step begins with understanding the rock stresses
in and around the coalbeds. This is a critical step in understanding
how the hydraulic frac treatment will interact with the reservoir.
“The second step is to understand the gas stored in the system, in the coals, shales, and the sands that may be interbedded with the coals and shale. This petrophysical analysis can be
accomplished using Halliburton’s StimLOG software to provide
a total system resource assessment that captures the gas in
place of the sand, coal, and shale in one evaluation.
“The third step is to understand system permeability. This
is essential for the proper design and placement of the frac
treatment, as well as for reservoir modeling to understand
reservoir performance.
“The fourth step is to take all this information into the fracture design process. There is no ‘one frac design made to ﬁt all
coals’: While there will be some trial and improvement to the
frac design, frac modeling has proved to be a very useful tool
not only for the design of a CBM frac but also in the post-job
analysis to help diagnose and understand the stimulation issues speciﬁc to that particular coal.
“The ﬁfth step is to review the post-stimulation well performance. Is it producing as expected? Are coal ﬁnes or frac sand
being produced? If so, a number of remedial treatments could

be applied during the stimulation treatment to address these
issues before they happen.”
Ekstrand also thinks it’s important to address the issue of
coal ﬁnes being released during fracturing, which results in
plugging and a loss of fracture conductivity.
“Coal ﬁnes agglomeration technologies that chemically
bind together the coal ﬁnes provide stabilization of the coal
ﬁnes and inhibit or stop migration of any that are released as
they bind to become larger particles that no longer can enter
the fracture,” he says. “The result is higher fracture conductivity and longevity.”
Horizontal wells completed with discrete fracturing ports
that can be ball- or dart-activated for precise fracturing initiation are bringing a different life to CBM plays, according
to Conkle: “With more horizontal wells completed in CBM,
some of the technologies currently used and that will be used
in shale plays will deﬁnitively impact the development of CBM
plays—for instance, hydraulic fracturing monitoring, nondamaging ﬂuids, and low-temperature diverters, among others.”

pack porosity. As pressure dissolution takes place, propped
fracture width reduces under stress; but as precipitation (or
recrystallization) occurs, precipitant ﬁlls in the pore spaces
between proppant grains. As little as 25% of the initial proppant-pack porosity may remain after only 40 days at 300° and
6,000 psi closure stress.”
To control proppant diagenesis, Halliburton applies a hydrophobic, dielectric material to fracture proppant before the
proppant is pumped downhole as part of a hydraulic fracture
stimulation treatment. The service helps prevent the early
onset of diagenesis.
“The rate of porosity loss can be reduced by treating the
proppant with a dielectric coating that makes the proppant surface hydrophobic (water-hating) and insulated (inhibiting waterbased chemical reaction),” Oehler says.
“A survey of wells fractured or refractured using proppants
coated with a dielectric, hydrophobic material showed very
stable production over time. Wells in the same area that were
completed using uncoated proppants generally demonstrated
steeper declines and less-sustained production.”

Controlling diagenesis
Fracture diagenesis may be the most important and exciting
area of research aimed at maintaining fracture conductivity,
contends Matt Oehler, Halliburton fracturing product manager in Houston.
“Successful prevention could lead to substantial production uplifts without the need to refracture wells experiencing
production decline,” he says. The discovery and deﬁnition
of rapid-onset diagenesis and the development of a service
that helps prevent it is expected to have a profound effect on
well completions throughout the industry, Oehler adds.
The diagenesis process is assumed to normally require millions of years, but in the case of hydraulic fracturing, it can occur within a few months. Prevention of the early onset of proppant diagenesis contributes signiﬁcantly to the productive life
of hydrocarbon wells.
Diagenesis-type reactions can occur between proppant and
freshly fractured rock surfaces via generation of crystalline and
amorphous, porosity-ﬁlling minerals within the proppant pack.
Although rapid loss of fracture conductivity after hydraulic fracture stimulation is often assumed to be the result of migration of
formation ﬁnes or the generation of ﬁnes derived from proppant
crushing, Oehler cites recent laboratory work that points to diagenic reactions because of chemical compositional differences
between the proppant and the formation, and compaction of the
proppant bed due to proppant pressure solution reactions.
“This damage mechanism applies to propped, fracture-stimulated wells; however, it is more signiﬁcant in high-temperature and
high-stress wells,” he says. “Diagenesis might explain the difference often observed between reservoir simulation of production
after fracturing and actual production, including the decline rate.
“The rate of production loss is directly related to the
diminishing rate of fracture conductivity that results from
narrowing of propped fracture width and inﬁll of proppant

Hydraulic fracturing, produced water
One of the dilemmas for production stimulation experts is
how to deal with the huge volumes of produced water and
consequently the use of that produced water in hydraulic fracturing efforts.
Water costs, which can account for 30–50% of total well
completion costs, is a necessity for all phases of drilling, completion, and stimulation activity. Being able to cost-effectively
source, handle, treat, and dispose of water is a critical concern in production stimulation efforts. And it is becoming increasingly important, especially in the US Lower 48 Western
states, to better utilize produced water and minimize use of
fresh water supplies.
Leonard Case, stimulation product manager-equipment
systems for Halliburton in Duncan, Okla., contends that the
handling of produced water is transitioning from a liability to
an asset, becoming a signiﬁcant part of the value chain in the
monetization of oil and gas assets.
Produced water has been used in production stimulation to
varying degrees over the years, he notes: “The most common
approach is to either use the produced water as is, modifying the ﬁnal stimulation ﬂuid system to give acceptable performance, or diluting the produced water with fresh water to
bring the mixture to some minimum acceptable state and then
modifying the frac ﬂuid system.
“These are very unique solutions and only good for similar produced waters. With these solutions, there is always a
tradeoff between ﬂuid performance and economics.”
To overcome the variability of the source water, some producers have incorporated a treating processes such as evaporator distillers or reverse osmosis, Case points out.
“Both of these processes produce water that is either
drinking quality or very near drinking quality. which removes

all variability from the produced water. The limitations of both
of these processes is that they are very capital-intensive, have
relatively low throughput volumes, and will not handle all produced and ﬂowback water without some type of pretreatment
being performed.”
What the industry needs is a process tailored to typical oil
ﬁeld conditions, adds Case, “where job rates can vary from
10 bpm (barrels per minute) to >160 bpm, with total job volumes ranging from 60,000 gal to more than 3,000,000 gal and
where the produced water quality can vary from 1,000 ppm to
300,000 ppm total dissolved solids.
“Now in ﬁeld testing, Halliburton has addressed this challenge by developing the technology to selectively remove the
ions that hamper our ability to use the produced water as a
base ﬂuid from which to create a fracturing ﬂuid. Most produced waters contain different levels of sodium, potassium,
magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, iron, boron, chlorides,
residual oil, and a host of production chemicals.
“With our ‘selective ion removal’ process, we can selectively remove the harmful ions such as calcium, magnesium,
barium, iron, and boron, as well as the residual oil and various
production chemicals.
“What we are left with is what we refer to as a ‘treating
brine’ containing sodium, potassium, and chlorides. Not only
can we effectively remove the targeted ions, we can vary the
amount removed; therefore, we create a ‘standard’ treating
brine that will give the same performance from a wide variety
of produced water. This newly created treating brine is ideal for
use in lower-rate water frac applications as well as linear ﬂuids
or borate cross-linked treating systems.”
To that end, Halliburton has developed a new biopolymerbased, linear—no crosslink required—frac ﬂuid system that can
use produced water and eliminates the need for hydrocarbonbased concentrates.
“Because the system does not require potable mixing water or crosslinkers, the ﬂuid is both practical and economical
for use in a variety of produced waters,” claims Oehler. “Eliminating the need for purchase and transportation of potable
water for fracture stimulation reduces cost, reduces demand
on potable water supplies, and contributes to the sustainability of favorable health, safety, and environment conditions.”
The new fracturing ﬂuid is mixed from a dry polymer, reducing its potential environmental impact in that no hydrocarbons
are needed. The ﬂuid can be mixed into tanks or on-the-ﬂy with
a new dry polymer blender. In typical water temperatures, 80%
hydration can be achieved in under 5 min. Because there is no
crosslinker, there are no additional liquid additive pumps, nor
are crosslink quality-control tests needed.
“The new ﬂuid outperforms traditional crosslinked gels and
offers an economical, superior alternative to surfactant-gel technology for fracturing low-permeability, medium-temperature
(150–250 °F) formations with permeability below 10 md,” Oehler says. “In the resulting fracture, the retained conductivity of
the proppant pack is often greater than 80%, and the system

breaks and cleans up effectively.
“The low pipe friction generated by linear ﬂuid makes it
ideal for pumping down tubing and coiled tubing for multistage, pinpoint stimulation, and applications in unconventional reservoirs where high pressures are required at the
fracture face.”
Oehler thinks that the new fracturing ﬂuid will have a “profound” inﬂuence on the way the industry does business: “It
has the capability to perform without crosslinking and without
liquid concentrates that require BTEX [benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes] to function. Further, it does not require
transporting and consuming ever more scarce potable water.”

Equipment innovations
Key areas of fracturing equipment innovation have focused on
improving efﬁciency, reducing emissions, and increasing reliability, according to Chad Joost, sales manager, well stimulation products, Stewart & Stevenson.
“The improvements in efﬁciency have been achieved
through the development of our distributed control and data
acquisition system (AccuFrac and the Intelligent Pump Control),
providing unit control and visibility to all recorded parameters
from inside the Data Acquisition and Control Unit (commonly
referred to as the Data Van),” he says. “This system allows the
key wellsite personnel to control all aspects of the job and reduces the personnel demands on the wellsite—also providing
some relief to the service companies’ hiring requirements in
a very tight labor market and allowing equipment operators to
rest between unit mobilization.”
With the US Environmental Protection Agency’s off-highway
emissions requirements now at Tier 2 levels for engines at or
above 750 bhp, Stewart & Stevenson has developed fracturing
equipment meeting those requirements with emissions-compliant engines and cooling systems.
“These emissions-compliant units have been well received
in the US market as a result of our industry’s drive toward reducing our environmental impact,” Joost notes.“We expect to
see even greater emphasis on reducing emissions in markets
outside of the US.”
In addition, fracturing equipment reliability has improved
signiﬁcantly by integrating real-time diagnostics with the pump
control system (Intelligent Pump Control), says Joost.
“This functionality informs the equipment operator of any
faults during the job and takes the appropriate action (alarm
only, unit rampdown, or unit shutdown),” he says. “In cases
of unit alarms, the fault is logged and addressed after the job
or during the next maintenance event. In the case of faults of
greater importance, the control system takes the appropriate
action to avoid further damaging the equipment.
“Other advances that have improved equipment reliability
include preventative maintenance programs that are controlled
through databases with operating ﬂuid analysis, improvement
in equipment design with high-strength materials and advanced
designs, and operator training through the OEM.” ]

Non-frac stimulation technologies

lthough the oil and gas industry’s buzz over the hot
gas shale plays in North America has pushed fracturing technology advances to the forefront, other production stimulation technologies continue to make
progress as well.
The rest of the well stimulation industry would do well
to heed the example of innovations occurring in fracturing,
according to Barry B. Ekstrand, Weatherford vice-president,
reservoir stimulation.
“We should never forget that the proverbial lemmings do
a great job of following an established path as they fall off the
cliff,” he says. “The analogy is relevant for us in our industry,
as we must recognize when innovation creates a new path, an
opportunity to build on success.
“We rightly seek efﬁciencies and often adapt our past successes to new situations, but we must not miss out on balancing efﬁciency with innovation opportunities. Effectively striking
that balance ensures that we will not miss out on opportunities
to take successes and improve upon them.”

toring, distributed temperature sensing (DTS), and optimization
of the stimulation model post-job to enable the most effective
drainage of an asset.
“The key factor in this workﬂow that adds the value is integration,” Gualteri and Gell wrote. “The process moves beyond
simply measuring data to understanding how these data relate
to the geology, to the production, and to what is done next.
This workﬂow is reservoir-focused rather than well-focused.
VeriStim service consists of several components that when
combined can result in optimized stimulation results:
• An experienced, multidiscipline team working collaboratively with the operator.
• Fracture stimulation.
• Monitoring the created fracture using microseismic
analysis.
• Monitoring ﬂuid movement in the near-wellbore area
using DTS.
• Post-treatment analysis and reporting.
• Optimization of the stimulation model to enable the
most effective drainage of an asset.

Fracture-related technologies
There are several fracture-related technologies marking progress in the realm of production stimulation.
Ekstrand points to improvements in and integration of
borehole microseismic monitoring, along with frac treatment
monitoring and controls and analytical technologies that “will
enable increasingly accurate real-time optimization of frac
treatments.”
Also on Ekstrand’s technology advance wish list are completion tool technologies that dramatically decrease the time to
complete fracture stimulation activities in multizone wells.
“By reducing or eliminating the time for preparatory activities between frac stages, huge efﬁciency gains are achieved;
the impact is magniﬁed when on a horizontal well,” he says.
“Metallurgical technology and tool conﬁguration are critical to
the success of these systems that are subjected to high-pressure, highly erosive conditions.”

Stimulation monitoring
A virtual, real-time integrated collaborative environment can
maximize returns by applying a “model, measure, and optimize” strategy for well stimulation, according to Halliburton’s
Dan Gualtieri, global product champion, Houston, and Christi
Gell, VeriStim program manager, also of Houston. Gualtieri and
Gell provided written responses to Oil & Gas Journal Technology Forum’s queries.

According to Gualteri and Gell, operators working with the
VeriStim service teams gain enhanced capabilities in two important areas:
• Optimized reservoir stimulation and hydrocarbon
production.
• Monitoring and control of the stimulation treatment in
real time for maximum treatment efﬁciency in both vertical and horizontal wellbores.

Acidizing
As oil and gas production comes increasingly from challenging reservoirs, the industry will need to push the performance envelope
for acidizing chemicals, contends Mary Van Domelen, product
manager, near-wellbore stimulation, in Halliburton’s Cairo ofﬁce.
“This will take acidizing from what has traditionally been considered a commodity service into the high-tech arena, requiring
not only advances in acidizing chemicals, but also in the area of engineering design, execution, and treatment monitoring,” she says.
“One example is our integration of our state-of-the-art
acidizing simulator, STIM2001, with ﬁber optic [DTS] treatment
monitoring service, StimWatch.”
She also cites advances in the area of environmentally improved acidizing chemicals:
“It is undoubtedly difﬁcult to develop an acid corrosion inhibitor that will stand up to the corrosive environment of hydrochloric acid at high temperatures and then biodegrade in North
Sea water at 20° C.

all water producing intervals accept a sufﬁcient quantity of the
total treatment volume.
“If signiﬁcant permeability or pressure variations are present in the interval to be treated, treatment ﬂuid will enter the
zones with the higher permeability and lower pressure, leaving
little ﬂuid to treat the other zones, which potentially can be the
water producing zones.”
The challenge is even greater in long horizontal wells with signiﬁcant permeability and pressure contrast, Van Domelen adds:
“To achieve a more uniform ﬂuid coverage, the original ﬂow distribution across intervals often needs to be altered. The methods
used to alter this are called ‘diversion’ methods. The purpose is

Self-healing or self-repair cements will provide a true longterm zonal isolation, Conkle notes, adding, “Today’s technology
for self-healing relies on hydrocarbon presence, but in the future it may rely on water.”
The use of special cement slurries can enable an operator
to introduce an aggressive, focused multistage frac program,
according to Halliburton’s John A. Ringhisen, technical advisor,
Oklahoma City, and Ronald J. Crook, senior technical advisor,
Duncan, Okla. Ringhisen and Crook provided written responses
to Oil & Gas Journal Technology Forum’s queries.
“In eastern Oklahoma’s Woodford shale play, Newﬁeld Exploration Co. has achieved zonal isolation using foamed cement
in a horizontal well section, enabling aggressive, focused multistage fracture treatments,” they wrote. “Conversely, wells
cemented with conventional slurries did not exhibit adequate
zonal isolation and lost fracture-treatment volume to other stag| Technology Forum | September 22, 2008 |

es because of channeling in the cement sheath at the top of
the horizontal borehole.”
As of early 2008, operators drilling horizontal Woodford
shale wells had cemented 116 horizontal production casing
strings with conventional cement slurries and 229 horizontal
production casing strings using a cement slurry converted to
a stable foam cement slurry by adding nitrogen gas, according
to Ringhisen and Crook. Of the 105 wells on which production
data are available, wells cemented with foamed cement averaged 28.1% more peak 30-day gas production than conventionally cemented wells did.
Using the ductile, foamed cement increased fracture initiation and successful job placement to more than 96.4% of stage
stimulation designs, they wrote. Frac operations in conventionally cemented Woodford wells had been considered successful
in 79.9% of the stage stimulation designs.

Sand control
Swelling and sloughing of active, unstable shale can cause
gravel pack screen assemblies to become stuck so that part or
all of the pay zone cannot be completed, notes Bart Waltman,
Halliburton sand control ﬂuids product manager, Houston.
Or the screen may be installed, but partial hole collapse may
cause the gravel pack to be incomplete, leaving bare screen
exposed during production. Resulting problems may not be
visible until the producing well starts losing production rate or
starts producing sand.
Oil-based drilling and completion ﬂuids can signiﬁcantly
reduce or even eliminate hole stability problems associated
with drilling and completing this type of reservoir, Waltman
says: “Open hole intervals drilled with oil-based ﬂuids can
often be drilled faster with a higher rate of penetration and
less rig time. And the oil-based ﬂuids tend to reduce or substantially eliminate shale instability issues that can cause
hole restriction or collapse.” However, for reservoirs that require sand control, the oil-based ﬂuid is typically switched to
water-based ﬂuid before starting the sand control completion operations.
Waltman describes Halliburton’s recent ﬂuid development
combined with special service tool ﬂuid ﬂow capabilities, FlexPac service, which allows the simpliﬁcation of the process.
“Now the drill-in ﬂuid conditioning procedure used for base
screen completions can be combined with the service tool ﬂow
path capability and an oil-based drill-in ﬂuid-compatible ﬂuid to
enable running screens to planned depth.”
FlexPac service includes coordinated service tools and ﬂuids that enable efﬁcient displacement of oil-based ﬂuid from
the openhole pay interval without ﬂuid compatibility upsets or
screen plugging. Accordng to Waltman, this provides important beneﬁts:
• Low skin completions to enable better long-term production.
• Improved success rate of installing screens to total
depth and achieving a complete gravel pack.

Facilitated use of oil-based drill-in ﬂuid that can reduce rig time, increase penetration rate, and lower
drilling cost.
More efﬁcient drill-in ﬂuid displacement.
Reduced exposure time of shales to water-based ﬂuid.
Reduced hole collapse problems.
Maintenance of oil-based ﬂuid wall cake to enable return circulation for gravel packing.
No requirement for the mud to be pumped through the
screen during the transition process.
Lower ﬂuid associated costs due to reduced number
of ﬂuids required, improved ﬂuid logistics (reduced
rig tankage), decreased contaminated ﬂuid disposal
costs, and reduced ﬂuid waste and disposal.

Solids-free lost circulation control
One of the major problems encountered in many operations is
excessive ﬂuid loss to the formation. This leakoff and the resulting lost circulation can make it virtually impossible to successfully circulate material into or out of the wellbore. Workovers
and completions require, among other things, nondamaging
products and systems to control ﬂuid loss and keep ﬂuids in
balance, Waltman points out.
A new solids-free, low-viscosity ﬂuid system can be used
to help control lost circulation over a broad range of temperatures and permeabilities, according to Waltman: “The service
modiﬁes the permeability characteristics of the near-wellbore
formation to reduce the relative permeability to aqueous or
water-based ﬂuids without impeding the ﬂow of oil or gas
through the region.”
This new relative permeability modiﬁcation (RPM) technology can be used for various lost-circulation applications, Waltman notes:
• Enabling running screens to depth in the open hole laterals. “With inadequate circulation to remove cuttings
and debris, running screens to depth in the open hole
laterals can be hindered or blocked by bad hole conditions. In addition, when screens are run to bottom in a
poorly conditioned lateral, plugging with drilling residue
often results in poor productivity.”
• Gravel pack completions. “For gravel pack completions,
excessive ﬂuid loss and inadequate returns ﬂow can
prevent efﬁcient gravel transport and complete packing.
The new technology used during hole preparation displacement operations or during pumping of the gravel
slurry can increase ﬂuid returns ﬂow to allow complete
annular packing.”
• Additional applications. “RPM technology can be used
in almost any situation where limiting ﬂuid losses can
simplify and facilitate operational efﬁciency and reduce damage to well productivity,” e.g., coiled tubing
cleanouts, workover operations, post-tubing conveyed
perforating ﬂuid loss control, and post-gravel pack ﬂuid
loss control. ]

COMPANY PROFILE

CULTURE – THE KEY TO SUSTAINABLE PROCESS SAFETY PERFORMANCE
WHAT IS CULTURE?
Some companies wonder why they keep
experiencing the same process safety
problems. Others wonder why they have
plateaued in process safety performance.
Culture is KEY. It is the individual and
organizational “DNA” that represents our
tendency to want to do (1) the right thing
(2) in the right way (3) at the right time,
(4) ALL the time – even when no one is
looking.
The safety culture that exists in a
plant or company is the result of all the
actions - and inactions - in institutional/
workforce memory.
Many facilities use management systems
to help control risks of hazardous processes.
These management systems are operated by
people – people whose inherent attitudes
about safety can affect the choices they
make in operating these systems and, thus,
the overall safety performance of the facility.

ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF A
GOOD CULTURE
Industry has established attributes of a
good process safety culture. Focusing on
these features allows a company to evaluate
existing safety culture and determine how
best to improve it.
1. Establish safety as a core value
2. Provide strong leadership
3. Establish and enforce high standards of
performance

EXAMPLES OF CULTURE EVENTS
• A co-worker does not object when an operator writes an “armchair permit”
• Supervisors consistently support workers who shut down a process they believe to
be unsafe – even if they were wrong
• An operations manager extends a unit shutdown to await deﬁnitive evidence that
a thin-walled vessel is safe to operate
• A reﬁnery manager does not wear appropriate PPE when walking out to the
control room to eat lunch with a unit crew
• A corporate EHS director persists in her efforts to justify stafﬁng resource
commitments to support process safety in spite of company cost-cutting edicts
• A reﬁning SVP pressures the reﬁnery manager to defer the reﬁnery turnaround
through the busy season
• A company director eliminates corporate engineering and process safety staff
positions without any management of organizational change
• A CEO makes an acquisition without addressing process safety in due diligence
reviews
• A Board does not devote sufﬁcient time to review process safety performance
metrics and question the company’s third-quartile performance
4. Formalize the safety culture approach
5. Maintain a sense of vulnerability
6. Empower individuals to successfully
fulﬁll their safety responsibilities
7. Defer to expertise
8. Ensure open and effective
communications
9. Establish a questioning/learning
environment
10. Foster mutual trust
11. Provide timely response to safety issues
and concerns
12. Provide continuous monitoring of
performance

HOW TO EVALUATE PROCESS
SAFETY CULTURE

An organization’s CULTURE can influence its
performance, productivity, profitability and risk.
At ABS Consulting, we know that process safety
is more than a program—it’s an integral part of the
culture that DRIVES your business. Find out
how your organization’s culture is affecting your
PROCESS SAFETY risk profile.

Call us today to schedule a Safety
Culture Performance Review.

energy@absconsulting.com
www.absconsulting.com
Ph: 281-673-2945

Process safety culture is hard to measure
and more difﬁcult to change. There are few
direct indicators of culture, and because
of its nature, it cannot be evaluated very
frequently. Typical ways to get a handle on
process safety culture are:
• Employee surveys
• Interviews
• Work observations
• Process safety leading indicator metrics
Based on lessons from conducting the
Baker Panel evaluation, ABS Consulting has
devised a formal approach for connecting
process safety and EHS performance
outcomes to culture. This performance
assurance review (PAR) approach consists
of the following steps at a facility:

• Develop a current “safety performance
picture” and assessing the “historical
performance movie”
• Understand employee opinions about
safety culture issues
• Map these results to the 12 culture
features
• Address technical, management system
and underlying cultural issues to create
sustainable, improved process safety
performance
Companies can perform a PAR at a
single facility, but the results will be more
robust if the evaluation is done at multiple
representative facilities, business divisions,
and corporate ofﬁces.

PATH FORWARD
Some predict that future major incidents
will all have poor safety culture as a
contributing factor. Safety culture will
be the “root cause” of the next decade.
Industry must do more to equip itself
to learn and do something about the
underlying organizational and culture
causes of major accident situations –
BEFORE they happen.

Is tomorrow’s energy right
in front of us?
Where on earth could we ﬁnd enough
oil to power more than 60 million cars for
60 years? And enough natural gas to heat
160 million households for 60 years?
You might be surprised to learn that
the answer is right here, in America – 116
billion barrels of oil and 651 trillion cubic
feet of natural gas, just on federal lands.
But, as the saying goes, these vital
domestic resources are often “so close, yet
so far.” Why? Because current government
policies – a tangled mix of federal and
state regulatory restrictions – put a
85% of large portion of these oil and natural
lower 48 OCS gas resources, many on the Outer
acreage is Continental Shelf (OCS), off-limits
to production.
off-limits
In fact, the U.S. government
to oil & estimates that there are 36 billion
natural gas barrels of undiscovered technically
development recoverable oil on federal lands
currently closed to development.
New technological breakthroughs allow us
to tap these resources, even in “ultra deep
waters,” while protecting fragile marine
environments. Recently, oil and natural gas
companies employed advanced technologies
to discover vast amounts of new oil
and natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico –
resources beyond our technical reach just
a few years ago.

The U.S. Department of Energy
predicts America will need 19 percent
more energy in 2030 than we used
in 2006. Meeting this demand, and
ensuring our future energy security,
requires developing more energy from
more sources, including our own oil and
natural gas resources.
Oil and natural gas not only heat
our homes and fuel transportation,
they also provide the building blocks for
everything from medicines to advanced
communications equipment. And
developing America’s untapped energy
resources means a stronger economy
and more American jobs. That’s real
economic stimulus – and it would allow
increased funding for federal, state and
local government budgets.
Oil and natural gas make possible
our unequaled quality of life. Ensuring
such for future Americans will require
policies that permit responsible,
respectful access to America’s plentiful
domestic oil and natural gas resources.
These valuable resources are within our
reach. Let’s work together to realize
their potential.

IN THE NEWS

EXPLORATORY DRILLING
RESURGENCE CONTINUES
API’s 2008 second-quarter drilling
report shows that U.S. oil and natural
gas companies completed over 50
percent more exploratory wells in the
second quarter of 2008 than they did
during the same period the year before
– a strong indication that the industry
continues to boost activity in the
exploration and production sector.
“This demonstrates the industry’s
resolve to explore for and ﬁnd the oil
and natural gas needed to keep our
nation going strong,” said Hazem
Arafa, director of API’s statistics
department. “This is remarkable,
considering the limited access our
industry has to the nation’s oil and
natural gas resources.”
Total estimated exploratory well
completions – which accounted for
nearly 17 percent of total estimated
well completions, increased 53 percent
in the second quarter – compared with
the same quarter last year. Estimated
exploratory oil well completions
increased 49 percent, while estimated
exploratory natural gas wells
completions jumped 99 percent in the
second quarter of 2008, compared with
last year’s second quarter.
An estimated 14,289 oil wells, natural
gas wells and dry holes were completed
in the second quarter of 2008, up 8
percent from the second quarter a year
ago, the report found.
The resurgence in oil well
completion activity that began in 2000
is continuing into 2008. An estimated
5,219 oil wells were completed in the
second quarter of 2008, up 17 percent
from last year’s second quarter and the
highest second quarter estimated oil
activity since 1986.

CANADIAN OIL SANDS | By Cathy Landry

A MEASURE OF ENERGY
SECURITY FROM OUR
NEIGHBORS TO THE NORTH
Canadian oil sands are growing in
importance to the U.S. energy picture.
Here’s how one of our closest allies is also
our largest supplier of imported oil.
The United States’ neighbor to the north is developing a huge reservoir of
crude oil – derived from Canadian oil sands – which should play an important
role in meeting North America’s growing energy needs for decades to come.
“The Canadian oil sands are immensely important to the United States
because they are an enormous resource and are located so close in a country
that is one of our nation’s closest allies,” says API Upstream Group Director
Doug Morris.
Crude oil derived from Canadian oil sands is expected to grow in importance
to the United States in decades to come. Demand for all forms of energy
continues to increase, according to the Energy Information Administration
(EIA), which projects U.S. primary energy demand in 2030 to be 19 percent
higher than 2006 levels.
While the United States will continue to use more alternative sources of
energy, such as ethanol, geothermal, solar and wind, in coming years it also
will require more oil and natural gas – and more and more oil, thanks to the
development of the oil sands, may be coming from Canada.
Canada already is the largest supplier of imported oil and oil products to the
United States, with about half of that now coming from oil sands formations.
The growth in Canadian oil-sands-derived crude oil is likely to expand
even more. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers estimates oil
sands production growing from about 1.2 million barrels per day currently
to potentially 3.8 million barrels per day by 2020. Moreover, Canadian oil
reserves are vast at 173 billion barrels – putting Canada second only to Saudi
Arabia – and ensure that production will ﬂow for decades into the future.
“The close relationship between Canada and the United States – both
politically and from a trade perspective – is probably one of the most exciting
things about the Canadian oil sands,” says Kyle Isakower, API Director of
Policy Analysis.

But a lot of Americans do not realize
the importance of Canada to U.S.
energy security or even know about the
existence of the Canadian oil sands.
For its part, API is working to educate
the public and decision-makers about
the importance of this supply to the
nation’s energy security by working to
address various issues associated with
Canadian oil sands – ranging from
production, to transmission and use
in reﬁneries. Those outreach efforts
also involve educating the public
by participating in workshops and
community meetings, particularly in the
Midwest, where the bulk of Canadian
oil now ﬂows.

Oil sands are a naturally occurring
mixture of sand or clay, water and
extra heavy crude oil or bitumen,
Morris explains. While most forms
of crude oil are extracted by drilling
into a formation, Canadian oil sands
deposits have traditionally been mined.
Increasingly, though, the oil sands oil is
made to ﬂow into producing wells by insitu techniques that lower the bitumen’s
viscosity by using steam or solvents,
allowing a developer to recover the oil
through traditional drilling practices, he
adds. With 80 percent of the resources
too deep to mine, technological
improvements are making in-situ
production more cost-effective, and

Most of the Canadian oil sands are located in three major deposits in northern Alberta.
Combined, the three deposits cover more than 54,000 square miles - an area about the size
of the state of New York.

new operations are increasingly using
techniques that further reduce
the activity’s environmental footprint.
Most of the Canadian oil sands
are located in three major deposits
in northern Alberta: the AthabascaWabiskaw oil sands of northeastern
Alberta (the biggest), the Cold Lake
deposits of east-northeastern Alberta
and the Peace River deposits of
northwestern Alberta. Combined, the
three deposits cover more than 54,000
square miles – an area about the size of
the state of New York.
The oil sands of Canada are centered
in the western province of Alberta.
While the Canadians have known
about the existence of these oilrich sands for decades and began
development in the 1960s, work was
stymied by low oil prices because the
huge upfront costs of development
made the projects economically
unviable. By early this decade,
however, stronger crude oil prices
made Canadian oil sands economically
feasible and spurred widespread
development and production.
Technology also improved, allowing
companies to consider developing in
areas once thought impossible.
Once processed, the petroleum
derived from oil sands is a heavy crude
oil that can move directly into the
pipeline network to reﬁneries that will
turn it into petroleum products such as
gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and heating oil.
Pipeline companies are investing billions
to build new and expand existing
pipelines in both Canada and the United
States to allow additional supplies to be
moved south. About 99 percent of all
Canadian oil is exported to the United
States. Because – like most of the crude
oil produced in other countries – the
crude derived from Canadian oil sands
is heavy, some reﬁners also are making
large investments to expand and
upgrade their reﬁneries to be able to
accommodate increasing amounts of this
crude while still meeting all federal, state
and local requirements for permitting,
says API Downstream Group Director
Bob Greco.
“It makes a lot of sense for reﬁners
in the United States to make these

investments to take the Canadian crude
oil because so much of it will be readily
available as production grows,” Greco
says. “Many reﬁners see this as a safe,
reliable, and nearby source of supply
and are eager to ensure that they can
take increasing amounts of the Canadian
crude as it becomes available.”
Greco also points out these expansion
projects allow the reﬁners to upgrade
their plants and provide well-paying jobs
to the local communities. API is working
to educate local citizens and lawmakers
about the vital importance of these
pipeline and reﬁnery expansion projects
in improving U.S. energy security by
taking additional Canadian oil.
Once the crude oil derived from
Canadian oil sands is reﬁned, the
resulting product is exactly like any
other gasoline, diesel, jet fuel or heating
oil made from any other kind of crude
oil – whether light, heavy, sour or sweet
or produced domestically or imported,

says Al Mannato, API’s Fuels Issues
Manager.
“Petroleum products reﬁned from
Canadian crude oil are sold into the
market just like any other oil product,”
he explains.
The Canadian oil sands are not without
controversy because, like all mining and
development projects, the operations
have an effect on the environment.
However, the oil industries in Canada
and in the United States are making
great strides in addressing various
environmental issues, including oil sands
operations’ greater carbon intensity
compared with development and
production of lighter types of crude oil.
The Canadian government is developing
climate change programs that cap
carbon intensity in oil sands operations
by offsetting or reducing emissions,
and Alberta’s government has planned
actions to address the environmental
footprint in a meaningful way.

The work is paying off. Technological
advances have cut per-barrel
greenhouse gas emissions from oil sands
production by 32 percent, compared
with 1990 levels, according to the
Canadian government. In addition,
oil sands production is leading to the
development of new and innovative
technologies to mitigate environmental
impacts – including the impacts on
water during the separation process –
reclaim oil sands development areas and
store and capture carbon.
The bigger payoff, however, may be
what Canadian oil sands can mean for
U.S. energy security.
“There has been a lot of talk in recent
years about energy security and the
need for the United States to have a
secure and reliable source of supply,”
says API’s Isakower. “Crude oil derived
from Canadian oil sands, simply put,
will make the United States more
energy secure.”

API DATA | By Karen Matusic

THERE’S MORE TO
THE OIL AND NATURAL
GAS INDUSTRY THAN
SUPPLY AND DEMAND
Dig down into the data that API provides and you’ll uncover
statistics about drilling, safety and the environment – data that
the world relies on.
API’s weekly and monthly petroleum supply and demand
reports are must-reads for policymakers, analysts, traders,
journalists and others who want to keep their ﬁnger on the
pulse of U.S. oil market fundamentals. But the work of
API’s Statistics Department goes well beyond providing
the tools the oil and natural gas industry needs to gauge
its own performance and make informed decisions about
ways to improve that performance.
API Statistics Director Hazem Arafa and his team of
statisticians, economists, analysts and administrators also
provide reliable and accurate facts and ﬁgures that enable
API to “tell the story” of how America’s oil and natural gas
companies are hard at work to bring consumers reliable fuel
supplies in an environmentally and socially responsible way.
API’s Statistics Department provides data that not only
measures productivity and hydrocarbon use, but also safety
performance, investments in environmental improvements
and emerging energy technologies, drilling activity and
pipeline spills.
API has been supplying accurate, timely statistical
information since 1919, and Arafa says his group is mindful
that it has a nearly century-old reputation for meticulous
analyses to maintain. All numbers are checked and doublechecked for any discrepancies before the data is released.
“All of my staff are numerical with a very keen eye for
detail,” Arafa says. “I tell them there are some forgivable
mistakes in life and some unforgivable mistakes. In our

department, if we do not check our data to make sure it
is accurate, that is unforgivable.We put a considerable
amount of work into making sure API data is accurate.”
Much of API’s statistical output is generated through
industry-wide surveys that go to companies inside and
outside API membership. Arafa says his group typically
gets an excellent response rate because the ﬁnal results
are extremely valuable for all companies.
“Companies are able to use this data to see how they stand
in the industry and learn what they are doing well and learn
from others on how to get even better,” Arafa says. “There
is always room for improvement and this way you can learn
from the best.”
API also makes good use of federal government data
on oil spills, reﬁning-toxics release inventories and
workplace and process safety to gauge how the industry
is performing in such important areas. In its raw form, some
of this data is confusing and difﬁcult to interpret, Arafa says.
“Sometimes the data is double- and triple-counted.
We analyze the data, put it into clear categories and
look at actual trends,” he says. “All of the caveats in the
government data are there but someone looking to make a
quick analysis would have to really look close at all the
footnotes and most people do not.We have also caught
some mistakes in reporting by detecting anomalies that may
have not been caught in the original format,” Arafa says.

new sources of oil and gas to increase U.S. production,”
Arafa says. API also publishes the Joint Association Survey
on Drilling Costs (JAS), the only long-term source of
information on U.S. drilling expenditures.
The latest JAS showed that spending on drilling and
equipping wells in the United States surged in 2006 to a
record high of nearly $110 billion, a 44 percent increase
from the previous year.
“This unprecedented level of spending clearly
demonstrates the industry’s commitment to actively
invest in exploration,” Arafa says.
ENVIRONMENT
Meeting the increasing demand for energy while protecting
the environment is a challenge that the oil and natural gas
industry takes very seriously, spending billions of dollars
to address pollution and to lessen the environmental
footprint. The latest annual environmental spending survey
(Environmental Expenditures by the U.S. Oil and Natural
Gas Industry) showed that the industry set a new record for
environmental spending of $11.3 billion in 2006, the latest
year reported.
Total investment between 1990 and 2006 exceeded $169
billion. And that spending and the industry’s focus on new
technology and cleaner-burning fuels are contributing a
cleaner environment for all Americans. According to the
Environmental Protection Agency, the nation’s air quality
is improving even though energy demand is rising.

The latest JAS showed that spending on drilling and equipping wells
in the United States surged in 2006 to a record high of nearly $110
billion, a 44 percent increase from the previous year.

Here is a closer look at some of the statistical offerings of
API:
DRILLING
Against a backdrop of record-high oil prices and growing
global demand, a lot of attention on Capitol Hill and
beyond has been focused on domestic production and the
possibility of opening more federal properties to drilling.
API media relations staff and spokespersons are often asked,
“What is the industry doing to ﬁnd more supplies here at
home?”
Thanks to data compiled by API in its Quarterly
Well Completion Report, the facts speak for themselves.
According to API’s ﬁrst-quarter 2008 drilling estimates
in the QuarterlyWell Completion Report, drilling activity
was twice the level of corresponding quarters during the
1990s, even though federal policy limits access to nonpark
land and most of the outer continental shelf for
development.
“Using these numbers, we are able to demonstrate that
the oil and natural gas industry is committed to ﬁnding

SAFETY
Safety has always been a top priority for API members, and
statistics on the oil and natural gas industry’s safety record –
as measured in three separate studies on workplace safety,
process safety performance measurement and occupational
injuries, illnesses and fatalities – ranks above that of other
industries in the private sector.
But no accident is acceptable and preventing the possibility
of a fatal accident is a goal toward which API member
companies all work, day in and day out.
“Accurate safety data is indispensable and really helps
our companies be the best they can be,” Arafa says.
API’s Statistics Department serves many functions and
its data acts as the check and balance to the government
data to make certain that the world has the best possible
numbers and estimates on U.S. oil and natural gas.
“We serve all segments of the industry, since there is hardly
an issue that does not need some data to verify claims and
positions,” Arafa says. “We help develop databases and
software to measure industry performance while helping
individual companies benchmark that performance relative
to their peers. Most important, we collect data that helps
the industry perform better in the safety and environmental
arenas. By mining our data, we play a role in helping the
industry continually improve on its already stellar safety
record.”

A DAY IN THE LIFE | By Robert Dodge, Cathy Landry and Evette Torres

AS THE BABY BOOMERS
RETIRE, A NEW GENERATION
STEPS IN TO CARRY ON
Fresh faces are going places in the oil and natural gas
industry as one generation makes way for the next
wave of energy pros.
Every day a new generation of workers
reports for duty in the oil and natural
gas industry. Some show up in the
gas ﬁelds of Texas. Others ﬁnd their
workplace offshore. And still others
work in reﬁneries and processing plants
in places such as southern Louisiana.
Wherever they work, they bring
fresh faces to each day-in-the-life of

the industry. And the business needs
them: At least 50 percent of the
workforce will be leaving in the next
ﬁve to 10 years as the Baby Boom
Generation begins to retire.
Five workers recently told their stories,
sharing how they decided on careers in
the oil and gas industry, what they do at
work and their ambitions for the future.

Stacey Hebert, 31, found her niche with Shell Chemical LP in Geismar, Louisiana.

STACEY HEBERT
Stacey Hebert, 31, did not know what
she wanted to do when she got out of
high school. And she was not terribly
satisﬁed with the jobs that came her
way: video store clerk, driver education
instructor and ﬁle clerk.
Living in southern Louisiana, and
having some relatives in the oil and
natural gas industry, she picked up
information about a possible career
in energy. “I wanted to do something
that would require both physical and
mental ability,” she says.
Hebert enrolled in the Baton Rouge
Community College and began
studying process technology, an
area she learned would give her the
hands-on work she was seeking.
“I had heard these jobs were thinking
jobs that rely on math, chemistry and
physics to safely and efﬁciently produce
products,” she says. “But I had never
been around this industry before, so I
had absolutely no idea what to expect.”
Hebert got a chance to learn
more when she followed up with an
instructor’s encouragement to apply for
an internship at the Shell Chemical LP
facility in Geismar, Louisiana. She got

the internship and learned more about
the role of a process technician in the
petrochemical industry.
“Most people believe operators sit
behind a control board and open and
close valves,” she says. “But there is
much more involvement in being a
technician.”
Hebert says it is also important to
develop skills in communication,
computers and teamwork.
“My internship helped me decide
whether this was what I wanted to do
for the next 25 or 30 years of my life,”
she says.
After earning her associate degree
in May 2003, Hebert returned to the
Shell Chemical LP facility in Geismar
as a full-time operator where she could
focus all her new skills on the primary
task of making a product.
As a technician, Hebert is responsible
for keeping the processes running
within the approved limits and product
quality speciﬁcations.
And the thing that makes her job fun:
No two days are the same.
“I never know what to expect when
I come in,” says Hebert, who works
an alternating 12-hour shift schedule.
“When I come into work, I have no
idea what happened in the previous
12 hours.”
It can be a routine day where unit
operation has run quite smoothly. But
other times, it may be more challenging
because there are problems that require
trouble-shooting and repairs. “You
want to ﬁnd and solve these problems
in a timely manner to maintain
production rates and product quality,”
she says.
MARSHALL KIMBALL
Marshall Kimball, 19, of Baton Rouge,
had wanted to work on an offshore oil
rig since he was a boy growing up in
Lake Charles, Louisiana.
“When I was little, my brother-inlaw, who was a driller offshore, and a
neighbor, who worked on a jack-up rig,
would talk about working offshore,”
Kimball says. “They talked about the
opportunities to advance and that you
could make a really good living. When
I graduated from high school, I applied

for offshore jobs, but I was told I was
too young and had no experience.
Nobody wanted to take a chance on
someone who hadn’t proved he was
up to the job.”
So, Kimball shelved his dream and
took jobs working at the concession
counter at the local zoo and at a local
fast food chain at night.
“I was doing lots of work – working all
the time, and I was getting nowhere,”
he says. A casual conversation with his
sister and her husband during a car ride
changed Kimball’s life.
“We were riding around and my
sister told me she had heard about
API’s Oilﬁeld Training Program,”
says Kimball. “The program wasn’t far

away, and I decided to give it a shot.”
The Oilﬁeld Training Program helps
young adults learn critical entry-level
skills they need to get started and
succeed in their ﬁrst jobs in the oil
and natural gas industry.
Kimball – who completed the
program (which is part of the Carville
Job Corps Academy in Carville,
Louisiana) in January after ﬁve months
“of pretty much just studying and
sleeping” – is now living his dream:
working offshore for Parker Drilling
Company, leasing his own apartment,
and on the verge of buying his ﬁrst car.
Kimball acknowledges that none of
this could have happened if it were not
for the training program.

“I learned all the skills I needed at the
Carville program, and it opened the
door for me,” Kimball says. “People
were willing to take a chance on me
because they knew I had put in the
time to get the training. They knew I
was serious about working on a rig.”
Kimball has big plans for the
future. He’s hoping to move up from
his current position as an offshore
roustabout – an entry-level position
that involves mostly cleaning and
painting and other support duties on
the rig – to roughneck, a jack-of-alltrades position on the rig, within a
few months. And he has high hopes
to then move up to more specialty
positions, such as a derrickman, who
handles the drilling mud, or driller,
and then eventually to become a
company man.
“One thing they told us at Carville,
and then when I got to Parker, is really
true: ‘The more effort you put in, the
more you move up. The higher you get,
the cleaner the stay.’”

Kimball admits right now as a
roustabout he’s “dirty – from head to
toe – being a roustabout is a dirty job.
It’s a hard job. But it’s a good job. I’m
learning every day and I have room for
advancement.”
The skills Kimball learned at Carville
are serving him well offshore.
“All the things I learned in the
program have come in handy. I’m using
them on the job,” he says.
By the time he’s 26, Kimball wants
to have his vehicle paid off, and he
wants to buy a house or trailer. In the
meantime, he says he’s going to try to
work as hard as he can and learn as
much as he can.
His advice to other young people
considering entering the API Oilﬁeld
Training Program: “Do it. If you are
16-24, it’s the right time to get into
this. You can always party later. Just
get in there. Get established. Make
something of your life. If I can do it,
anyone can. It’s hard work, but it’s
going to pay off in the end.”

ERICK NAVAS
Erick Navas is overcome with a sense of
awe as he considers the responsibilities
placed on him.
The 23-year-old production engineer
has been in his job at Marathon Oil
Corp. for only 10 months. But based
on his demonstrated capabilities
through internships, he is now
responsible for the production and
operations of the Oletha Field, a
46-well gas ﬁeld about 90 miles south
of Dallas near Fairﬁeld, Texas.
“They handed it over to me, and it
is an enormous responsibility,” Navas
says. “It’s a ton of responsibility. I am
solely responsible for this ﬁeld.”
Navas, who was born in Venezuela
and immigrated to the United States
at age 11 with his parents, says he
has moved up quickly because of
his education and internships. He
majored in petroleum engineering
at Pennsylvania State University and
received two internships with Marathon
during his ﬁnal years of college.

Erick Navas, 23, production engineer at Marathon Oil Corp., has been in his job for ten months.

During high school, Navas thought
he might want to be an architect. But
a conversation with someone in the
ﬁeld left him cold. He recalled his
grandfather, a farmer in Venezuela,
urging him to consider the oil and
natural gas industry.
“I knew I wanted to be in science
and math, and engineering is the ﬁrst
thing that comes to mind,” says Navas,
adding that he retreated to the high
school library to do research on the oil
and natural gas industry. It appealed to
him right away as he found a business
that offered indoor and outdoor work,
the chance to travel and see extreme
tropical and arctic venues in far-ﬂung
corners of the globe.
“It’s very attractive for a young person
who wants to travel. A light deﬁnitely
went on with me,” says Navas, adding
that his sister is also now studying to
become a petroleum engineer.
During his two internships, Navas
spent one summer working offshore,
and then spent the next summer
working in the Oletha Field where
he would return after graduation to
begin full-time work. He says the two
internships gave him a good overview
of working offshore and onshore, as
well as some exciting training, such as
evacuating a helicopter.
Though he begins most days by
checking the previous day’s natural gas
production, checking to see if any wells
went down and talking to ﬁeld operators
to inquire about any other problems,
Navas says no two days have been the
same since he started working full-time.
After his usual morning checks, he
may then work on an ongoing project,
such as installing a new pumping unit.
He will work on the design, confer
with colleagues about the proposed
solution and ﬁnally write a proposal to
fund the project.
In the afternoon, Navas likes to get
out of the ofﬁce to make sure safety
expectations are being followed, and
to look for some “hands-on” work in
the ﬁeld.
“I try to be out there as much as I
can,” he says.
“There are a lot of expectations, but
there also are quick rewards,” Navas

says. “For instance, if you are working
on a well, two or three days later you
can see if you did a good job. You see
the results quickly.”
Right now, Navas may be focused on
the Oletha Field, but he also is looking
ahead and has big plans.
In the future, he wants to work
abroad and get some international
experience. He also wants to work
offshore, and then with the scientiﬁc
staff that looks at geologic formations
for oil and natural gas deposits.
“I never thought I would have so
much fun doing this,” Navas says.
“It is quite exciting to think that we
are producing the energy that the
world demands. It is an ever-changing
environment and the challenges just
keep coming. These are very exciting
times.”
ALVIN FLOURNOY
Alvin Flournoy, an 18-year-old from
Lake Charles, Louisiana, was not fully
aware of how much he would limit his
career opportunities when he decided
to drop out of high school.
While he got a job easily enough –
at a local fast food chain – he soon
realized the pay was low and there were
few opportunities for advancement.
“I knew there wasn’t a future there,”
Flournoy says.
When he learned of API’s Oilﬁeld
Training Program, he decided to give
it a shot.
“I wanted to get a head start in life. It
was a good opportunity, and the money
was good,” Flournoy says.
Within two weeks of ﬁnishing the
API program at the Carville Job Corps
Academy, Flournoy landed a job as
an offshore roustabout with Parker
Drilling Company. He’s now working
as a ﬂoor hand, which entails making
drill pipes connect.
Flournoy has high praise for Carville,
which is part of the nationwide Job
Corps program, designed to help
disadvantaged youth between the ages
of 16 and 24 years old.
After his Carville graduation, he
thought he was prepared to work in
the industry but “I found out I was
over-prepared – I knew more than

many of the guys who had been here
a long time.” That, he says, “made me
feel proud. I was very glad I went to
Carville.”
While he found the API Oilﬁeld
Program challenging at Carville, “if you
paid attention you could get through,”
Flournoy says.
Flournoy works offshore, seven days
on, seven days off.
“The ﬁrst couple of hitches offshore
were hard, because you’re away from
your family and your friends, but once
you get used to it, and you get to know
people better, it’s all right.”

Alvin Flournoy, 18, landed a job as an
offshore roustabout with Parker Drilling
Company.

He appreciates the care the company
takes to make the workers feel at home.
“The food is great and you can eat
all you want,” he says. Some rigs even
offer Internet connections so he can
talk to his family.
“It’s almost like being at home, except
you’re surrounded by water.”
For the most part, Flournoy, who has
been on the job for nine months, ﬁnds
his work fun.
“It’s interesting, and it’s challenging,”
he says. “You’re always learning
something new.”
In addition to the good salary and
challenging work, he appreciates
the health insurance and being able

to travel, buy company stock and
participate in a 401K.
“That is very, very important to me,”
he says.
Flournoy believes he’ll stay in the
industry for the rest of his working life
and his goal is a simple one: “To be
somebody’s manager.”
SCOTT WAGGENSPACK
When Scott Waggenspack, age 27, has
an opportunity to work with a student
intern at the Shell Chemical LP facility
at Geismar, Louisiana, he eagerly
accepts. After all, he remembers how the
internship he completed in 2002 helped
prepare him for a productive future as a
process operator at the facility.
Waggenspack had one semester
left to earn his associate degree in
process technology at nearby Louisiana
Technical College, River Parishes
Campus, when he started his internship
with Shell. For almost three months,
Waggenspack accompanied operators
as they performed their daily duties.
“I ﬁgured it would give me better
insight into the inner workings of the

plant’s operations,” he says. “I didn’t just
work with one person, I worked side-byside with operators on many units in both
maintenance and operations, during both
day and night shifts.”
Waggenspack knew at an early age he
wanted to work in the oil and natural
gas industry. His father was a process
operator and liked to tell his son about
the challenges and interesting work.
And, it did not hurt that the young
Waggenspack loved science and math.
“I was mechanically inclined and I
was good at science and physics,” he
says. “It seemed like working in the
petrochemical industry would be a
good thing for me.”
He gave chemical engineering a try at
Louisiana State University. But his work
convinced him he needed to make a
change in his career plans.
“I got a warehouse job and got to
deliver to people throughout the plant,”
he says. “I got to meet everybody, and
it was during that time I learned that I
was more suited to be an operator than
an engineer. I was more mechanically
inclined, and I like to be outside.”

Scott Waggenspack, 27, knew from an early age he wanted to work in the oil and natural gas
industry.

His internship gave him hands-on
experience he could not get in the
classroom.
He inspected equipment when it was
down to see what it looked like inside.
He turned valves to see how just a small
movement could have an effect. And
while working in the plant’s tank farm,
he climbed on vessels to collect and
analyze product samples.
“I even helped get ready to shut down
some units in preparation for a hurricane,”
he says, “and that was exciting.”
Just as exciting was the job offer he got
from Shell Chemical after graduation.
Now, he is working 12-hour shifts
that start at either 6 a.m. or 6 p.m. He
loves his job but ﬁnds it a challenge to
adjust to the night-day shift changes,
and has adopted his own strategy
to keep his body clock on track and
himself feeling good.
“It is very tough,” Waggenspack says.
“I try to eat at regular intervals and that
seems to help regulate my body.”
On a typical day, Waggenspack gets a
brieﬁng from a co-worker when he gets
to work about what happened on the
previous shift.
“Then the whole shift gets together
and has a meeting to discuss any threats,
including those to the environment and
safety,” he says.
He then makes rounds to ensure
everything is working the way it is
supposed to. His facility makes ethylene
glycol, which is used to manufacture
automotive coolants and synthetic ﬁbers.
Waggenspack says he likes working
with Shell and would like to go overseas
with the company. While he would
like to broaden his experience, he
does not aspire to be a manager: “I
wouldn’t necessarily like to be in
leadership, but I would like to be seen
as a leader.”
He’s already in that role. He works
with interns so they have the same
learning experience that gave him a
jumpstart with his career. “I am taking
what I learned during my internship,”
he says, “and showing them things
they have to see ﬁrsthand to fully
understand. I remember being in their
shoes and the eagerness and excitement
to get your life started.”

TECHNOMEDIA: FAST-TRACK ONLINE TRAINING FOR THE BIG CREW CHANGE

T

he crisis is real. A growing shortage
of qualiﬁed workers at every level has
already delayed some oilﬁeld projects, and
many of the industry’s most experienced
employees are reaching retirement
age. The senior operators, petroleum
engineers and geologists that remain ﬁnd
themselves too busy to train new hires.
People call it the Big Crew Change,
and it’s hitting North American oil and
natural gas producers particularly hard.
Houston-based TechnoMedia, one of
the largest providers of online technical
training for the petroleum industry,
is addressing a signiﬁcant part of the
problem: how to bring new employees up
to speed fast.
“TechnoMedia provides a ﬂexible,
eLearning framework,” says Greg Bihn,

president of TechnoMedia International,
Inc. “Since we began in 1991, our goal
has been to give entry-level workers
the basic knowledge they need to begin
working safely in the oilﬁeld. The training
covers both upstream and downstream, so
our courses can also beneﬁt experienced
workers who are changing from one
job to another, say from drilling to
production or reﬁning operations.”
The interactive programs not only
reduce training time, they provide
consistency and standardized instruction
for every new employee. Since the
courses can be viewed whenever an
employee has time, even in areas without
Internet access, training schedules are
completely ﬂexible. Students take the
tests when they feel they have mastered

the material. The scores become part
of their online record, which training
managers can easily track, either through
a learning management system offered by
TechnoMedia, or legacy systems already
in place with their employer.

API UNIVERSITY
RELATIONSHIP
In 2004 API and TechnoMedia began
negotiations to provide eLearning for
the oil and natural gas industry. From
these initial discussions emerged “API
University” in 2005. API’s educational
initiative with TechnoMedia produced
an immediate impact on the availability
of educational deliverables for the
Industry. Drawing from its own
eLearning curriculum and innovative

partnering strategies, TechnoMedia
was able to quickly expand the API
University library to more than 220
eLearning course titles covering a broad
range of topics for entry-level workers.
Newly hired personnel within the
energy industry will certainly be the
primary user base. The course can be
beneﬁcial in providing cross-training to
seasoned staff in either engineering or
support roles within the organization.
The course also offers professionals
working in allied ﬁelds a highly visual
overview of the activities associated
with oil and natural gas recovery and
processing, from both the upstream
and downstream perspective. Because
the material is digital and runs over IP
networks, licensing on a per-employee
basis can be quite cost-effective.
TechnoMedia’s curriculum now forms the
core of API’s expanded training program.

COMPANY PROFILE

API University is dedicated to providing
excellence in petroleum industry training
and has access to the largest pool of subject
experts in the industry.
The programs are taught by the

A FLEXIBLE FORMAT
Flexibility is the key to TechnoMedia’s
presentation. A major selling point is that
students control the delivery of information.
Through the use of a highly intuitive user
interface, anyone taking the course can
repeat individual slides or topics as often as
needed to understand the concepts being
presented. Because TechnoMedia employs
the latest multimedia technology, the
eLearning courses work both online (either
Internet and corporate intranets), or via
CDs or DVDs.
An innovative approach to deploying
media-rich content allows TechnoMedia
products to be delivered even in minimal
bandwidth environments, as you might
ﬁnd on a drilling rig, and since the material
is digital and runs over IP networks,

licensing costs on a per-employee basis can
be quite cost-effective.

THE VISUAL APPROACH
TechnoMedia’s team of interactive
programmers, computer graphic artists,
writers and training specialists uses the
latest technologies and techniques to
create training experiences that engage
the learner.
“Our courseware development engineers
communicate with technical experts in
designing material to meet speciﬁc needs,
and our skilled multimedia specialists,
most of whom are intimately familiar with
the oilﬁeld, provide full production and
deployment services,” Bihn says. “Because
the emerging oilﬁeld workforce has been
weaned on media-rich, multimedia gaming,
the ‘Nintendo-generation’ expects training
materials that conform to this expectation.
The truth is, most young people see books
and manuals as stodgy remnants of the
past generations.”

The Drilling Fundamentals Library
includes 53 hours of courses in eight major
categories: Oilwell Drilling, Horizontal
Well Drilling, Kick Detection, Primary
Cementing, Bit Hydraulics, Underbalanced
Drilling, Well Control Fundamentals and
Introductory Well Control.
“All courses employ periodic quizzes,
real-world calculations, 3-D animations,
interactivities, charts and graphs to
increase comprehension and retention,”
Bihn explains.
This popular oilﬁeld training program
is perfect for new-hires in the drilling
industry. The material provides students
with a solid foundation in terminology,
drilling jargon, concepts and procedures
such as the types of ﬂuid pressures
in a well. It covers the advantages
and disadvantages of speciﬁc drilling
techniques, and the signiﬁcance of
formation porosity and permeability
in the development of a drilling kick.
Drilling Fundamentals also makes a great

orientation program for administrative
and support services.
“Our visual learning approach also pays
huge dividends to oilﬁeld workers that
are not native English language speakers,”
Bihn adds. “An interactive animation,
presented in 3D, allows users to grasp
highly technical subjects without a great
deal of language proﬁciency. That is
particularly important when you consider
the safety issues.”

INTERNATIONAL REACH
More than 70 percent of TechnoMedia’s
user base is outside of North America.
In addition to leveraging the beneﬁts
of visual learning, TechnoMedia has
developed innovative solutions that
address the challenge of training a
culturally diverse workforce. Many of
the courses are available in multiple
languages, including English, French,
Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Indonesian,
Arabic and Thai.

INTEGRATED LEARNING:
PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
TechnoMedia’s Integrated Learning
Solution (ILS) manages the training
and assessment of employees in diverse
locations and technical environments.
The ILS format allows students to
progress at their own pace, working
one-on-one with the program on their
personal computers.
“Our Integrated Learning Solution is
an à la carte combination of structured
curriculum, computer-based training
and learning management software,”
Bihn says. “The training is typically
provided through IP networks, but it
is also available in a hybrid delivery
format for use on CDs or DVDs for use
in remote locations. Our hybrid format
is particularly desirable when your are
training employees at the job site in order
to take advantage of downtime.”

COMPANY PROFILE

The Integrated Learning system can
even accommodate third-party courses,
which means that a company’s existing
PowerPoint presentations, videos or
technical manuals can be imported and
available to students as they work through
the material.
The ILS manages the deployment
of the courses and tracks student
progress. Subscribers can select the
components that best meet their
needs, then customize those elements
to increase the effectiveness of their
training programs. The ILS framework
has been effectively deployed by many
international companies, including
Chevron, Halliburton, Transocean, Smith
International, and FMC Technologies.

CUSTOM COURSES
TechnoMedia’s courses are designed to
be used right off the shelf, but clients

can also have a customized eLearning
courses, such as employee orientation
packages, developed on a turnkey basis
for a fraction of the cost and time of
producing one from scratch. Because
TechnoMedia can tap into its library

TECH TOUR | By Jessica Pointer

HANDS-ON HIGH TECH
LETS AMERICA GET UP
CLOSE AND PERSONAL
WITH THE INDUSTRY
API’s Tech Tour travels the country explaining
advanced technology and gives the country a glimpse
into the new world of energy.

Chris and Denise Jones and their two Pomeranians,
Honey and Punkin, transport the Tech Tour around
the country. “We’ve learned so much about the
industry over the past year,” says Chris.

Walk into almost any state capitol around the country and you’ll encounter
similar and predictable sights and sounds. Portraits and statues of the state’s
historical ﬁgures, framed copies of the state’s constitution and maps and
posters of the state lining the halls and corridors.
You’ll see guards and tour guides directing visitors, and you’ll see
teachers shepherding their excited and noisy students from one legislative
chamber to another.
The emphasis is almost universally and exclusively on the old – on the
state’s history. Imagine then, the curiosity that might be generated by an
exhibit that focuses on innovation and technology, which encourages
hands-on participation and challenges people to think and overcome
technological challenges.
This is what API’s interactive technology exhibit – or “Tech Tour” – does
as it travels around the country from state capitol to state capitol.
For those API representatives who have traveled with the Tech Tour to
various capitols, the look on people’s faces when they see others playing the
video games and watching the exhibit’s videos is priceless.
“Their eyes light up, and you can see the curiosity in their faces,” says
Rayola Dougher, API Senior Economic Advisor. “Their natural reaction is to
want to see what it’s all about.”
The exhibit, built in 2007 to highlight the industry’s increased efﬁciency
and advanced technology through interactive elements, is designed to
be fun as well as educational, explains Erin Thomson, API’s Director
of Communications. It is a major part of API’s Educational Advocacy

The Tech Tour will complete 40 stops by the end of the year.

program, initiated in 2007 to better
educate the public and policy makers
on energy issues.
“We know that people are interested
in technology and this was a way to
show people the high-tech way the
industry gets people the products they
depend on,” says Thomson.
The exhibit consists of four large
panels and four interactive kiosks –
highlighting reﬁneries, exploration
and production, transportation and
supply – that allow visitors to learn
about the industry by watching videos
and animations, playing games and
testing their knowledge on energy.
The videos and animations – designed
to be enjoyed by both young people
and adults – show the many different
areas of the industry. For instance,
one animation shows how the industry
uses seismic surveys to ﬁnd resources
underground without disturbing the
surface. Another shows how drill ships,
relying on satellite guidance systems,
can drill for oil and natural gas ﬁve miles
below the ocean. A video on drilling and

discovery shows some of the industry’s
latest technology and how oil and
natural gas companies are using it to
lessen the environmental impact.
The 3-D visualization video shows how
companies are using 3-D visualization
to be able to more accurately locate
oil and natural gas. The reﬁning video
gives an overview of recent reﬁnery
advancements. The kiosk where visitors
ﬁnd the deepwater drilling animation
also has a corresponding game where
they can lower a drill from a ship into a
wellhead. In another game, visitors can
try their skills at directional drilling by
maneuvering a drill bit to hit the pockets
of oil without releasing the pressure
from the surrounding natural gas.
“Some of our games have been very
popular with young people,” says Denise
McCourt, API Director of General
Membership, who has accompanied
the exhibit around the country. “Once
they get fascinated, then we know we’ve
passed information along.”
The exhibit has traveled around the
country to state capitals, conferences

and universities and made 21 stops in 16
states in 2007.
“The way the information is presented
catches people’s eye,” says Steve Dodge,
Massachusetts Petroleum Council
Associate Director. “They see it and
wonder what it’s all about.”
As energy increasingly became a major
topic of conversation throughout the
year, Thomson says, interest in the
exhibit grew and it quickly became
evident that a second Tech Tour needed
to be added. The second exhibit allowed
for doubling the number of stops.
An online version of the exhibit
was also launched in 2008 for people
who are unable to see the exhibit in
person. The online version, found at
energytomorrow.org, tries to recreate
the experience that people would have if
they were to visit the actual exhibit with
the help of a guide.
“People have seen or heard about the
exhibit and want to see it again,” says
Thomson. “The online version is a great
way to show the industry to people so
they can gain a better understanding

through the interactive elements.”
A lighter, condensed version of the
exhibit is being developed so that the
exhibit can accommodate the smallest
venues. That version will be on the road
in late 2008.
One of the more popular parts of the
exhibit is the Energy IQ kiosk, where
visitors are able to test their knowledge
about energy from the touch-screen
quiz. In most cases, what the visitors
thought they knew about the energy
industry does not match what the test
results reveal. Many people are surprised
to learn, for instance, that Canada is
the largest supplier of oil to the United
States. Many also don’t realize that the
world’s 10 largest oil and natural gas
companies are owned and operated by
foreign governments.
“The Energy IQ is a great way to talk
to people about the issues and many of
the misconceptions people have about
the industry,” says Dodge.

Once people start seeing that some
of their preconceived notions about the
industry are not correct, he explains,
they begin to be more receptive to the
idea that perhaps other assumptions
may also be wrong, and they become
more open to acquiring more
information and learning.
“Many people think that they know
all of the answers and are very surprised
when they ﬁnd out they don’t,”
adds Dodge. “Anyone who spends
a few minutes at the exhibit learns
something.”
The tech tour has crisscrossed the
country, over thousands of miles of
highways. It made 27 stops in 18
states during the ﬁrst half of 2008
and will complete 40 stops by the
end of the year. It is transported
on a tractor trailer with the help of
Chris and Denise Jones and their two
Pomeranians, Honey and Punkin.
Setting up the exhibit is not without

challenges. A crew of local laborers
is hired at each location to set up the
exhibit. It usually takes the workers
about four hours to unload and set up
the exhibit at each location and about
two hours to break it down. Many hours
of preparation are required before each
stop to ensure the exhibit will have
enough electricity, proper ceiling heights
and sufﬁcient light.
“A lot of times we’re assured that
everything will ﬁt before we get to
the location, but then ﬁnd out that
something is not quite right,” says
Chris, explaining that the exhibit is
generally able to accommodate almost
every space.
The Joneses say they enjoy taking the
exhibit around the country, visiting
places that they’d never visit otherwise,
and meeting a lot of great people.
There’s one other beneﬁt, explains
Chris: “We’ve learned so much about
the industry over the past year.”

ONE ON ONE | With Red Cavaney, interviewed by Juan R. Palomo

THE RIDE OF A LIFETIME
A look at Red Cavaney’s remarkable tenure at
API and how his exceptional leadership will
always be remembered.
On October 1, 1997, Red Cavaney became API’s president
and CEO, beginning an 11-year tenure he describes as
“the ride of a lifetime.” During this ride, crude oil prices
went from near-record lows to a record-high, and fuel
prices skyrocketed. The dramatic ﬂuctuations were the
result of a growing instability in the energy markets caused
by geopolitical strife, supply disruptions and increasing
demand for energy – not to mention back-to-back Category
5 hurricanes that played havoc with supplies and led to calls
for investigations.
Cavaney also undertook a major
reorganization of the trade association,
converting it into a much more effective
and efﬁcient entity, capable of responding
rapidly and strategically to ever-changing
challenges. Two years ago, following
the twin hurricanes, Rita and Katrina,
Cavaney facilitated the adoption by API
member companies of a large, multiyear Educational Advocacy campaign to
press for a more fact-based approach to
energy policy by increasing the level of
understanding of the oil and natural gas
industry among key audiences.
On November 1, Cavaney will step
down as API’s president and CEO, having
reached the association’s retirement age.
He recently sat down with Insight to
reﬂect on his tenure – and his future:

of our nation’s great industries. I also felt the weight of
expectations that needed to be addressed in order to make
API more effective and relevant to its members.
What do you think will be your thoughts on your last day
at API?
Great pride in the organization as it exists when I walk out
the door, coupled with sadness for having to leave behind
people who have become my extended family over the last
11 years.

What was going through your mind when
you walked into the API headquarters on
your ﬁrst full day on the job?
I was incredibly honored to have
the opportunity to serve as the staff
association leader for the CEOs of one

What were your goals and mandates when you took
this job?
The mandate given me by the leadership was to revitalize
the organization to signiﬁcantly increase its relevancy
and the weight of its impact in the public policy arena.
My goal was to ensure that API became one of the most
highly respected trade associations in the ﬁeld of public
policy and within the overall oil and natural gas industry.
Do you feel you have accomplished them?
Yes. I credit the API staff’s tremendous resiliency,
dedication, commitment to success, and hunger for
professional growth as being principally responsible
for where we are today.
What has been your greatest satisfaction about leading this
association?
Turning over to my successor a staff and organization that
is as close to being “all it can be” as any organization with
which I’ve ever been associated or ever observed.

Were there any disappointments?
None that time didn’t resolve.
What has been your greatest challenge?
To increase the energy literacy of our key advocacy
audiences. Energy literacy improvement is a prerequisite
for the enactment of federal, state and local energy policies
that would ensure sufﬁcient oil and natural gas suppliesparticularly those developed domestically – to affordably
meet anticipated future demand.
To what extent did the success of the industry in getting
supply to Americans at affordable cost contribute to this
lack of energy literacy?
To a degree, the industry has suffered from its own
success. In the face of challenging times in the ‘80s and ‘90s,
in particular, the industry reliably delivered energy supply –
certainly at affordable prices – and that allowed the public
the luxury of not having to think about energy for almost
a generation. That luxury, in turn, proved to be one of our

industry’s biggest obstacles, once the nation was faced with
rapidly squaring energy supply and demand upon entering
the 21st century.
What was your most rewarding experience?
It wasn’t necessarily anything I did. It was my great pride
in the API staff and the oil and natural gas industry, in
general, following the unprecedented success in keeping
oil and natural gas ﬂowing throughout Hurricanes
Katrina and Rita and in their immediate aftermath. I can’t
imagine a more successful performance in the face of such
unprecedented circumstances. Unfortunately, the public’s
lack of understanding of the energy industry resulted in
much greater criticism than accolades. However, that should
not diminish the fact that the industry never stood taller
during my time at API.
Looking back at your tenure, is there anything that you
would do differently if you had to start over again?
I am sure there are many things, but API’s superb staff
typically saved me from myself before I did any harm.

You’ve always brought great enthusiasm to the job, and
you always seemed to be having fun. Were there ever days
when you just wanted to throw in the towel and say, “This
just isn’t worth it.”?
Never. I accepted the job because I thought the challenge
would be great. I enjoy great challenges, and I derive my
passion from trying to work through those challenges. API
has afforded me the opportunity to come to work every day
feeling that there are things that we can do that will improve
our industry’s circumstances. API has become incredibly
relevant, and I’ve been blessed with tremendous CEO
leadership and an unselﬁsh, loyal API staff.
You introduced the Educational Advocacy initiative and
have guided it through its ﬁrst year and a half. Is it too early
to judge whether it’s been successful or not?
I think its biggest successes have yet to come, if we continue
building and learning from our actions. I feel it has already
more than proved its worth, as a result of the increased
understanding of the industry by key audiences and, more
importantly, the legislative and regulatory successes that have
ﬂowed from implementation of the multiple elements of the
broader EA program. I’m conﬁdent that the approval and
adoption of the Educational Advocacy effort by API’s CEO
leadership will be one of the hallmark decisions made by API
during the ﬁrst decade of the 21st century.
What is the one thing about this industry, that most
surprised you – that you didn’t expect?
Its incredible diversity and reach.
What will you miss most?
I will miss the API staff family and my relationship with
API’s CEO leadership. Throughout my entire time at API,
I have always felt the strong bond of being a partner and a
colleague to both.
How has the industry changed since you ﬁrst became the
head of API?
Wow! Night and day is probably an overused metaphor,
but in my brief 11 years, it’s been enormous.
How has the industry’s relationship with government
changed?
Government, itself, has changed signiﬁcantly during my
time here. Importantly, I think API’s relevance as a vitally
important voice in the development and implementation of
our nation’s energy policy has grown as well.
We appear to be in a gridlock when it comes to forging a
sound energy policy for this country. What is the solution?
The political gridlock that government is now experiencing
on energy policy has got to change, and it will. The current
lack of a national energy policy framework is tantamount
to asking someone to drive across the country without a
roadmap or any street signs. Our country has major decisions

to make, and it can’t make those with much success absent
a broader framework. Such a framework will help highlight
where needs exist and where prioritization and allocation of
resources should take place.
Looking down the road, what do you think the industry
will be like in the next 10 to 20 years?
I think oil and natural gas will be as relevant in the future
as it is today, if not more so. I have
been consistently impressed with the
industry’s commitment to facilitating
adaptation and adoption of emerging
energy technologies and how that new
technology has consistently enhanced
the energy industry’s future potential.

You served in the military, and you spent much of your
adult life in the world of politics and government. You are
obviously a man who is very much in love with his country.
Do you see yourself going back to involvement in politics?
I’ve always believed that each of us has an obligation to give
back to our country for the blessings we enjoy, and I will be
doing that through volunteer efforts. I don’t envision any
fulltime service in government.

What do you think API’s role will be?
API’s global role will be enhanced, as
the continuing importance of oil and
natural gas increases. API’s standards,
certiﬁcations and educational training
efforts will be increasingly more valued
as the demand for energy increases and
the search for hydrocarbons expands
throughout the world.
What will be your legacy at API?
The quality and professionalism of the
staff that I turn over to my successor.
If you were to write a book about your
tenure at API, what would its title be?
“The Ride of a Lifetime.”
One of the things that impresses
people at API the most has been
your style of leadership, your ability
to always treat people with respect.
Where did that come from?
From my mother. She taught me to
treat others as you would like to be
treated yourself, and everything else
will take care of itself. I have embraced
that philosophy ever since, and there
isn’t a day that I’m not grateful for
her early example of one of the great
lessons of my life.
What are you going to do now? I don’t think anybody here
expects you to simply play golf or travel.
I’m retiring from API because I’ve reached API’s retirement
age. I am not, however, retiring from the workforce. I’m
excited about opportunities to make a contribution, just as
much today as I was the day I walked into API. I am hopeful
that my next career opportunity will be equally as challenging,
exciting and rewarding.

Do you have any parting words of wisdom for API
employees?
Believe in yourself. Never accept limits. Embrace the
anything-is-possible mindset. And make sure you have fun
along the way!
In closing, I hope that my tears and the lump that will arise
in my throat when I take my leave from API won’t keep me
from saying how grateful I am for the experience and how
I will never be able to say thank you enough for everyone’s
commitment and support.

NEVER BEEN BETTER
Jack N. Gerard started his homework
early when many people were
thinking about the beach and summer
barbecues. But he wanted to be ready
when he takes over as president and
chief executive ofﬁcer of API on
November 1 – prep work that has
already generated ideas about how he
will assume the post held for 11 years
by Red Cavaney.
When he joins API, Gerard will leave
the American Chemistry Council,
where he has been president and
CEO for three years. That job, plus
experience leading the National Mining
Association and working on Capitol
Hill, have helped him recognize what
he needs to know to take over the helm
at the national trade association that
represents all aspects of the nation’s oil
and natural gas industry.
“Most importantly, I need to
understand what the customers want
and, in this case, that is the member
companies,” Gerard says. “I intend to
spend a fair amount of time going to
their places of work, sitting down with
them and getting their views about
how they see the world, how they
see the industry and their individual
companies.”
As he travels to meet the leaders of
member companies and introduces
himself to the industry, Gerard knows
exactly what kind of impression he
wants to make.
“I am a straight-shooter,” he says.
“To me this is all about integrity and
hard work. That is the way I conduct
my business and I expect the same out
of my people. My message is that we
will work hard together, and we are
going to work in the best interests of
our customers, which are the member
companies.”
With gasoline prices high and
the mood on Capitol Hill dark, a

Washington Post columnist wrote that
Gerard is “about to become the most
hated man in Washington.” Gerard
laughs at the characterization and said
that’s not the way he would write the
job description.
“It’s a tough job, but with every
challenge, there is opportunity,”
Gerard says. “I am competitive by
nature and I want to win. I fully intend
to work hard for my views and the
views of the industry I represent.”
Indeed, with a history of ﬁring up
the advocacy activities of the mining
and chemical associations, Gerard says
he sees a great opportunity to advance
the oil and natural gas industry’s
position as the public seeks factual
information to questions raised by
high energy prices.
“The industry has done well, and
the member companies recognize
the need to expend the resources to
engage in this debate. The opportunity
has never been better,” he says. “I am
conﬁdent that a lot of the great things
we are doing today will continue, and
perhaps we can ﬁne-tune some other
things or perhaps add some other
arrows to our quiver.
“When we step back, we have a
story to tell. We have to be compelling
in our storytelling. We have to be
aggressive. And now is the perfect
opportunity because we have the
public’s attention.”
At the Chemistry Council, Gerard
built membership, signing up 33
companies from the $635 billion
industry. He also redirected the
council’s efforts to become more of an
advocacy organization and is proud of a
number of legislative victories, including
the council’s role in opening up new
areas in the Gulf of Mexico – which
helped provide supplies of natural gas
to his industry.

Earlier in his career, Gerard was
president and chief executive ofﬁcer
of the National Mining Association.
Before joining the mining association,
he was a founding partner, chairman
and chief executive ofﬁcer of McClure,
Gerard and Neuenschwander, Inc.,
a Washington-based government
relations consulting ﬁrm, which he
co-founded with former U.S. Sen.
James McClure, who served as
chairman of the Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee. Gerard
also spent a decade working in the U.S.
Senate and House of Representatives.
Living in the Virginia suburbs of
Washington with his wife and eight
children, Gerard’s activity list reﬂects
his belief in the value of public and
community service. He is chairman of
the board of the National Capital Area
Council of the Boy Scouts of America,
serving 86,000 young people. He
serves on the Congressional Coalition
on Adoption Institute (he adopted
twin boys from Guatemala two years
ago), and serves on the Council
on American Politics at George
Washington University’s Graduate
School of Political Management. He
also is active in The Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints, serving
as Stake President of the church in
Northern Virginia, presiding over eight
congregations with 3,200 members.
“I have got my hands in a little bit
of everything,” Gerard says. “To me,
it is very important. There are only
so many hours to the day and it is
important that we do as much as we
can in those hours.”
Gerard grew up in a small Idaho
town of 190 people. His father was
a John Deere dealer, and his mother
was a school teacher. He believes his
rural Rocky Mountain background,
coupled with his career experience

in Washington, gives him a unique
background to navigate the capital’s
political culture and understand the
variety of crosscurrents that shape
public policy.
“Having the diversity of experience
helps in understanding that there are
different ways to look at issues and it
makes us all more tolerant and able to
see and understand other people’s points
of view,” he says. “It also helps me be
mindful of the impact, particularly with
the issues we are dealing with now in
high energy costs. What does it mean to
the citizenry, the local farmer, the banker
and school teacher?”
Gerard says the energy debate has
been driven by opinions – and lacks
facts. Once the American people
understand the facts, he argues,
he believes policymakers will be
compelled to change course and
amend existing laws to allow for
expanded development of American
oil and natural gas resources.
“When the public begins to
understand that the United States sits
on vast resources of oil and natural
gas, they will not tolerate public
policy ofﬁcials pointing ﬁngers at each
other and having a partisan debate
over should we use our assets or
shouldn’t we,” Gerard says. “I believe
we can already see the groundswell
developing today.
“Americans want to use American
resources for the good of our nation.
And once we put the facts on the table
and the public understands those facts,
they will rise up with a harmonious
chorus and express that view to their
elected ofﬁcials.”
He says it is up to API and its
member companies to shift the debate
from one of opinion to one of fact.
“There are some in this country who
have negative opinions of the oil and
gas industry,” Gerard says. “If we
allow them to continue without calling
them on that and stating what the
facts are, we will continue to have this
debate in an opinion-laced forum.”
He adds that Americans must
understand that the United States can
no longer afford to have an insular
energy policy that only considers the

nation’s needs. “Our needs are in direct
competition with the needs of other
nations around the world,” he says.
Gerard ﬁnds it disappointing that
many Americans do not appreciate
that major companies in oil and
natural gas, chemicals, mining
and other industries are national
treasures. He notes that few other
countries have developed companies
with such a depth of talent and the
ability to solve problems, innovate
and create wealth.
“These companies are the backbone
of our economy. They are the ones
that have made us the envy of the
world,” he says. “And we have
gotten there because the American
people are smart, sophisticated and
entrepreneurial.

“The oil and gas industry should
be one of the most respected in our
country. It has allowed us to innovate,
it has allowed us to grow and it has
allowed us to develop and enjoy the
highest standard of living in the world.”
Gerard says a better-informed
American public will prevail in
moving lawmakers to enact policies
that provide fuel for consumers and
businesses, as well as improve the
nation’s energy security.
“At the end of the day, all the bluff
and bluster seems to ﬂoat out and
people ﬁnally have to settle down to
deal with the challenges at hand,” he
says. “And I am optimistic. Based on
past experience and what I see as the
challenges before us, at some point
cooler heads will prevail.”

ENERGY IQ | By Juan R. Palomo

AMERICANS’ KNOWLEDGE ABOUT
ENERGY IMPROVING, BUT THEIR ENERGY
IQ REMAINS LOW
Misperceptions about key energy issues abound,
but national polls show broad public support for
increased access to U.S. oil and natural gas resources.

Only 6 percent of respondents knew that 100 percent of the world’s 10 biggest oil and natural gas companies (based on reserves) are owned
and operated by foreign governments. Source: Oil & Gas Journal

With energy one of the most hotly
debated issues in both Washington and
in everyday conversations as consumers
cope with higher energy costs, logic
would dictate that most Americans
would be very well versed when it
comes to energy. The reality is that
even as the energy literacy of Americans
is improving, a wide knowledge gap
remains.
A new survey, conducted for API by
Harris Interactive, the international

research ﬁrm, ﬁnds that Americans
still have fundamental misperceptions
on key energy issues – including the
importance of oil and natural gas in
meeting future demand – at a time
when elected leaders are considering
policies that could affect the country
for decades to come.
Jim Hoskins, senior Harris Interactive
vice president, explained that, when
presented with a series of multiple choice
questions, many of the respondents said

they did not know the answer, but that
of those who picked an answer, there
were many who chose the wrong answer.
There are some bright spots. Many
U.S. adults, for instance, now recognize
that the United States will need more
energy in the next 20 years and that
renewable sources currently meet less
than 10 percent of energy needs.
The release of the second “Energy
IQ” survey comes after a series of
national polls found broad public

Current government policy restricts access to 85 percent of potential offshore U.S. oil and
natural gas development sites off the coasts of the lower 48 states – but only 17 percent of
Americans know that.

support for increased access to U.S. oil
and natural gas resources. In comparing
the results to last year’s survey, Harris
Interactive found that respondents
showed increased knowledge on
key issues such as the competitive
advantage foreign government-owned
oil companies have over U.S. companies
and the restrictions that current policies

place on the development of America’s
own resources.
However, U.S. adults continued to
underestimate the importance of fossil
fuels in meeting future global demand,
the amount of known oil and natural
gas reserves in the world and the
level of investments that the industry
is making in emerging technologies,

Hoskins explained. Conversely, he said,
respondents overestimated the role that
renewables will play in meeting future
energy demand, the amount of oil the
U.S. imports from the Middle East and
industry earnings as a percentage of sales.
Red Cavaney, API’s president and
CEO, said that it is clear, from recent
polls, that the majority of Americans
see energy as a top priority and
favor increased development of U.S.
resources.
“This latest survey shows that many
people still lack an understanding of
the issues that shape our business and
should inform public policy debates,”
Cavaney said. “Our industry remains
committed to an ongoing dialogue on
these issues, and while we still have work
to do, we are seeing progress in both
attitudes and knowledge.”
Cavaney added that other ways of
gauging whether people are beginning
to understand today’s energy world also
indicate an improvement.
“You can look at news coverage, blog
discussions, and things of this nature,
and it’s very clear that the energy
knowledge base is increasing,” he said.

In 2007, less than 15 percent of oil consumed in the U.S. came from Persian Gulf countries. In 2008, only 7 percent of respondents knew the
correct answer.

12 percent of Americans know that 80 percent of global energy demand will be met by fossil
fuels in 2030.

When asked what percentage of gasoline prices at the pump accounted for federal, state
and local taxes in the ﬁrst quarter of 2008, 20 percent of Americans answered correctly that
the range was between 10 percent and 15 percent.

“It obviously is increasing at a slow pace,
because people have a lot of different
things that are competing for their
attention, but it’s increasing.”
One can now see a lot of terms and
phrases being used in the conversation
on energy that wouldn’t have been
used as recently as two years ago, he
explained. These terms and phrases,
he said, reﬂect the facts the industry
has been trying to get across over that
period of time.
“This is a critical time in the national
conversation around energy,” Cavaney
said. “We must work together with
elected ofﬁcials to increase public
understanding and enact policies that

ensure a reliable, sustainable energy
future.”
High energy costs have brought some
issues into focus, said Hoskins.
“Our survey found that a majority
of Americans understand that the
United States will need more energy,
and they are becoming more aware of
how current policies limit increased
domestic production,” he said. “On the
other hand, Americans continue
to demonstrate a lack of knowledge, and
in some cases serious misperceptions,
on a range of key energy questions.”
API commissioned the online research
by Harris Interactive of 1,528 U.S. adults
between June 3 and June 12, 2008.

One of the survey’s key ﬁndings was
that while a majority of those surveyed
understand the United States will need
more energy in future decades, they
underestimate the vital role that fossil
fuels will play in meeting that demand
while overestimating the impact of
renewable sources.
When asked how much more energy
the United States will need in the next
20 years, 53 percent of respondents
answered correctly that we will need
between 16 and 20 percent more energy.
While the International Energy Agency
projects that more than 80 percent of
global energy demand in 2030 will be
met by fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas
and coal, only 12 percent of respondents
chose this answer. The majority believed
it would be 60 percent or less.
The U.S. Energy Information
Administration (EIA) projects that 55
percent of U.S. energy demand will be
met by oil and natural gas in 2030. Yet
only 16 percent of respondents chose
this answer. The majority thought it was
less than 45 percent.
On the other hand, while the EIA
projects that less than 10 percent of
U.S. energy use will be supplied by
renewable sources in 2030, only one in
10 respondents chose this answer. One
in three respondents thought renewable
sources would account for more than 20
percent of all energy – more than double
government projections.
Another ﬁnding shows that the
majority of people are not aware that
current policies restrict access to 85
percent of U.S. offshore areas in the
lower 48 states, and they underestimate
the amount of oil and natural gas
produced in North America.
At a time when national surveys ﬁnd
broad public support for increased
offshore drilling, only 17 percent of
respondents understand just how
restrictive current U.S. policies are.
Still, this is up 6 percent from last
year’s survey.
Only 8 percent of respondents knew
that more than 45 percent of the oil
and natural gas the U.S. consumed in
2007 was produced in North America;
the majority thought it was less than 30
percent.

Many of our meetings and conferences offer excellent sponsorship and exhibit opportunities. Laura Barcaskey of Durable Mecco said of one API conference: “It was
a well spent three-days to get better acquainted with the key industry leaders of your industry, and to learn more about the application of our products in the oil
industry. As with most industries today markings for traceability is a key topic, and technology is allowing data to be captured in new ways in heavy applications such
as down-hole drilling and those subject to harsh environments/processes. We, at Durable Mecco, look forward to strengthening our relationship with API to handle
their diverse marking and identiﬁcation needs.”

COVER
World-class arctic drilling technology will go into ExxonMobil
Corp.’s wells at the Point Thomson Unit on Alaska’s North Slope
60 miles east of Prudhoe Bay. Penetrating a reservoir 2.5 miles
deep at more than 10,000 psi and extending beneath the Beaufort
Sea, they will be among the world’s most complex wells.The ramp
at the lower left corner of this image of Nabors Rig 27E on the
PTU-15 well, spud in late April, runs downslope on the insulated
permafrost drill pad to the Beaufort barge landing.The rig has
been equipped with a new mud system and power generation and
structural upgrades to safely drill the wells. Drilling water comes
from a lake several miles inland at the end of the road at top right.
The reservoir is estimated to contain 25% of the North Slope’s
known natural gas resource. OGJ’s Arctic Drilling and Production
special has an article about Alaska fiscal regimes starting on p. 20.

Indonesia, ExxonMobil disagree over tax debt
Indonesia is still in dispute with ExxonMobil Corp. and Kodeco
Energy Co. Ltd. over the companies’ alleged tax debts totaling $63
million, while three other firms have settled their outstanding bills.
The two firms and Indonesian state auditors still hold different
opinions about how the tax is calculated and the amount owed,
according to R. Priyono, director of BPMigas, Indonesia’s upstream
oil and gas regulator.
Priyono told a hearing at the House of Representatives Commission VII for energy and mineral resources that ExxonMobil, based
on an audit result from the State Development Finance Comptroller
(BPKP), still owed the state $30.65 million in unpaid corporate
taxes.
According to the BPMigas’ report given to legislators, ExxonMobil claims it was to receive a tax reduction because of a royalty
it paid to PT Asamera Oil Indonesia Ltd.
But Priyono said the royalty has nothing to do with the production-sharing contract between the government and ExxonMobil
and “cannot be used as a tax reduction.” Priyono added that the
dispute still is being deliberated by a tax tribunal.
Meanwhile, Kodeco claims taxes that it owes are calculated on
the basis of revenues and costs across all fields in one working area.
But BPMigas and the BPKP argue that tax must be calculated separately for each field.
Under that formula, the BPKP says Kodeco owes $32.23 million in tax, while “Kodeco still disagrees with the BPKP,” Priyono
said.
Three other firms have agreed to settle their debts. BPMigas
named them and their debts as Kangean Energy Indonesia Ltd.,
$45.06 million; Santos UK (Kakap 2) Ltd., $2.39 million; and
Golden Spike Raja Blok, $10.62 million.

MEND threatens to block Nigeria’s oil waterway
The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND)
plans to block key channels for oil vessels to increase pressure on

Exploration

&

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Nigeria’s troubled oil and gas industry.
“We have ordered the blockade of key waterway channels to oil
industry vessels both for the export of crude and gas and importation of refined petroleum products,” MEND said. “This means vessels now ply such routes at their risk.”
It claimed responsibility for blowing up two recently repaired
pipelines near Escravos in the Niger Delta as retaliation for military attacks on its camps around Warri. The military launched its
operations on May 15 following the hijacking of two oil vessels
and assaults upon its soldiers. According to MEND, two hostages
were killed during the fighting and it will return the bodies to the
Red Cross charity. “The British hostage, Mathew Maguire has been
relocated to Delta state and will be a guest of one the camps there,”
MEND added.
According to Nigerian press reports, there were also explosions
at a manifold operated by Shell in the Bayelsa state, which the company is investigating.
MEND accused the military of “indiscriminate use of missiles
and bombs on several defenseless Ijaw communities in Delta state,”
describing this “as the height of cowardice.”
Ijaw’s National Congress, which represents the region’s largest
ethnic group, said that the military has killed over 1,000 civilians,
which the military has denied.
There have been conflicting reports on how many hostages were
rescued last week and the number of civilians affected in the stand
off between MEND and Nigerian troops.
MEND is fighting for a greater share of the revenue from oil
and gas produced in the Delta and it pledged that for the Nigerian
government to declare victory, troops must be able to secure every
inch of pipelines and eliminate over 500 camps stretching from
Ondo to Akwa Ibom.
The attacks on Nigeria’s oil and gas facilities has cut oil production from 2.6 million b/d in January 2006 to about 1.8 million
b/d. ✦

north of Broome off Western Australian. It lies immediately northnortheast of and on trend with the Woodside Petroleum Group’s
Torosa gas-condensate field and north northwest of the Inpex
group’s Ichthys gas-condensate field.

lips attempted to retrieve the liner-hanger setting tool irreparably
plugged the well above the planned test interval.
The consortium said the well penetrated a 317 m gross gasbearing Plover Frmation reservoir between 4,795 m and 5,112 m
containing three gross gas sands totaling 228 m thickness.
The gas-water contact was not penetrated, indicating the potential for additional gas below the well’s total depth. Estimations
of reservoir permeability based on log-derived porosity and four
pressure data points suggest the reservoir section will flow gas.
Current mapping indicates the well is more than 100 m be-

low the crest of the Poseidon trap, giving an interpreted gross gas
column for the structure of more than 430 m. The aerial extent is
mapped at around 280 sq km.
The JV estimates proved reserves to be 3 tcf of gas.
The joint venture has begun inquiries to secure a rig for further
appraisal drilling on the discovery.
The Sedco 703 semisubmersible rig has been moved to the next
well in the multiwell program called Kontiki-1.
Interests in WA-315-P are ConocoPhillips 51% and Karoon Gas
49%.

Firm to explore carbonate reefs in Palau
Palau Pacific Exploration, Brisbane, seeks to drill a 5,000-ft exploration well in 130 ft of water off northern Palau in the southwestern Pacific.
The company secured an option on a farmout covering a 1
million acre concession on the North Block in Kayangel state and
sought investors to participate in a €30 million private placement
to fund part of the drilling program.
By drilling the well, the company would earn a 75% working
interest and a 66% net revenue interest in the block.
Palau Pacific defined the prospect by reprocessing in late 2007
about 140 miles of high-resolution seismic shot in 1997. Reprocessing with cutting edge frequency dependent processing resulted in the identification of multiple reefs and overlapping anomalies
for drilling, the company said.
“Potential reservoirs, determined from seismic sequence stratigraphy, are thick Miocene age carbonate reef systems. Geochemical analysis confirms the presence of thermogenic hydrocarbons.
Amplitude versus offset gradient analysis indicates shallow gas,”
the company said.
Consulting engineers suggest the existence of shallow Pliocene
gas as a bailout option should oil not be found, and they estimated
production lives of more than 20 years for Miocene oil and Pliocene gas if discovered. A power generation market exists for gas
that would back out imported diesel.
Palau is formulating a hydrocarbon law and planning an exploration license round (OGJ Online, May 7, 2009).

Drilling

&

A Marcellus shale well operated by EOG Resources Inc., Houston, was flow-tested at an average rate of more than 3 MMcfd of
gas for 7 days, said 50% interest owner Seneca Resources Corp.,
Buffalo, NY.
Seneca Resources, which holds a 60% net revenue interest,
said the well “confirms our expectations for the potential of our
Marcellus shale position, most of which is fee mineral acreage.”
A hydraulic fracture is under way at another well where flare tests
should begin by the end of May.
Seneca Resources said it should soon be in a position to estimate
the resource potential of its extensive acreage position. The company is the third largest acreage holder in the Marcellus play with
more than 725,000 acres (OGJ Online, Jan. 15, 2009).
The EOG-Seneca acreage is centered 80 miles northeast of Pittsburgh. Seneca plans to operate 10 vertical wells and 2-3 horizontal
wells in fiscal 2009 and participate in 8-10 wells to be operated by
EOG Resources.

StatoilHydro eyes exploration off Bahamas
BPC Ltd., Perth, and Norway’s StatoilHydro ASA formed a joint
venture to explore for oil and gas off the Bahamas if the government approves licenses applications.
The companies propose to explore licenses in southwestern
Bahamas waters that lie between Miami and central Cuba. The Bahamas commonwealth government could approve the license applications by yearend, BPC said.
The joint venture territory lies between four other Bahamas
blocks wholly held by BPC southwest of Andros Island and six
blocks in the Florida Straits off northwestern Cuba operated by
Repsol YPF SA in which StatoilHydro holds 30% interest.
Meanwhile, BPC identified 22 exploration leads on its fully
owned Bain, Cooper, Donaldson, and Eneas licenses 225-425 km
southeast of Miami and the Miami license 85-150 km east of Miami. The licenses, awarded in 2007, total 3.874 million acres in
5-535 m of water on the southern Great Bahama Bank and have
potential in a Jurassic-Cretaceous carbonate petroleum system.
BPC noted that five wells have been drilled in the Bahamas since
1947, the last one by Tenneco Oil Co. to 21,740 ft about 50 km off
Cuba in 1986 that had oil shows in Lower Cretaceous. ✦

Drilling activity continues to diminish
The US rig count continued to contract, down by 10 to 918
rotary rigs working the week ended May 15, less that half of the
1,862 units that were active in the same week a year ago, said Baker
Hughes Inc.
Land operations showed the latest loss, down 13 rigs to 855
drilling. Inland-water activity remained unchanged with 7 rigs
working. Offshore drilling increased by 3 to 55 rotary rigs working in the Gulf of Mexico out of a total of 56 on federal offshore
leases.
Of the rigs still working, 728 are drilling for natural gas, down
2 from the previous week. The number drilling for oil fell by 9 to
181. There were 9 rigs unclassified. Horizontal drilling was down

fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Both are subsea tiebacks to BP’s Marlin
tension-leg platform.
The Marlin TLP is on Viosca Knoll Block 915. Dorado, 2 miles
from the TLP, features three subsea wells operated by BP with a 75%
working interest. Shell has 25% working interest.
King South, 18 miles from the TLP, features one subsea well and
is 100% owned and operated by BP (OGJ, Oct. 8, 2007, p. 49).
Dorado utilizes dual completion technology enabling production from five Miocene zones, and King South is produced through
the existing King field subsea pump.
BP installed the Marlin TLP in 1999 as a production hub for
Marlin field. Since then, Marlin, King, Nile, and King West fields
have been producing across the Marlin TLP.
With the addition of the four new wells, a total of 11 wells
produce into the Marlin TLP with daily gross production of 60,000
b/d oil and 70 MMscfd of gas.

Jordan, Shell sign oil shale agreement
The Kingdom of Jordan has signed a concessionary agreement
with Jordan Oil Shale Co. BV, a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell PLC,
to explore for oil in the country’s shale deposits, according to a
senior government official.
Oil Minister Khaldoun Qteishat, who said the agreement will be
sent to parliament for final approval next month, announced that
the Shell subsidiary will invest up to $540 million in the project’s
preliminary exploratory and assessment phase.
Qteishat acknowledged that the “long-term concessionary
agreement will take many years to prove and study” whether Jordan’s reserves will produce the oil which his country needs.
The concession agreement will allow Josco to assess oil shale resources in an area spanning 22,500 sq km in the country’s central,
southern,/ and northwestern regions.
Shell Vice-Chairman Malcolm Brinded said Shell will examine
the most promising of Jordan’s 21 oil shale locations and then
“hone in on the area that is most promising” of all for its pilot
program.
The Jordanian government and Shell concluded an initial agreement on the contract in December, which sees production of oil from
the shale within 12-20 years of the conclusion of the agreement.
The agreement between Jordan and Shell is the second in recent
months. In April, the Jordanian cabinet approved memorandums of
understanding between Inter Rao of Russia and Aqaba Petroleum
for oil shale exploration and mining.
As reported by the Jordan Times, the areas that the two companies will explore are near Al Attarat in the southern part of the
country.
Meanwhile, other companies seeking oil shale agreements are
Estonia’s Eesti Energei, Petroleo Brazileiro SA, Total SA, Jordan Energy & Mining, and a Jordanian-Saudi joint venture called International Corp. for Oil Shale Investment.
According to Jordanian figures, 40 billion tonnes of oil shale
exist in the country’s 21 locations near the Yarmuk River, Buwayda,
Bayt Ras, Ruwayshad, Karak, Madaba, and Ma’an districts.

construction, and installation contract to a consortium led by
Saipem SPA for a central processing platform and other equipment
needed to develop Gajah Buru gas field off Indonesia.
First gas is expected in October 2011, and Premier estimates
the field holds recoverable reserves of 325 bcf. It was discovered
in 2004 with proved gas in stacked reservoirs in the Arang formation.
The deal is valued at $430 million, and the field is on the Natuna Block A in the West Natuna Sea. The central processing platform will weigh 12,900 tons. Saipem and its partner, PT SMOE
Indonesia, will produce a wellhead platform, connecting bridge,
and a 3-km, 16-in. subsea gas export pipeline to be laid in 80 m
of water.
The pipeline will be linked to the existing export trunkline, with
a capacity of 140 MMcfd to deliver gas to Sembgas in Singapore.
Facilities on the central processing platform will include compression, separation, glycol regeneration, gas metering, mechanical refrigeration, utilities, and living quarters for 60 staff. The wellhead platform has an estimated topside weight of 900 tons and a
jacket weight of 1,400 tons. Construction is scheduled to commence in August.
The Central Processing Platform will be installed using the
‘floatover’ method, while other platform facilities and pipeline will
be installed using Saipem’s Castoro Otto derrick-lay barge, said
Saipem.

Agip KCO awards Kashagan ﬁeld contract

Agip KCO let a $2.6 billion contract to Saipem SPA and Aker
Solutions to do the hook-up and commissioning of the offshore
facilities, inshore completion, and prefabrication work for the first
development phase of Kashagan field in the north Caspian Sea.
Saipem said the work would focus on oil and associated gas
production by an artificial offshore facilities system called Block D
and Block A. The inshore completion and prefabrication will happen in the Kuryk yard in Kazakhstan. All of the contracts will be
completed by 2012.
“The very shallow water, the severe weather and the stringent
environmental restrictions alongside the lack of infrastructure for
the offshore industry make the project particularly complex and
challenging,” added Saipem. It will use five barges to carry out the
work.
The hook-up contracts are the follow-ups of the letter of intent and
preliminary agreements signed between Agip KCO, Aker Solutions,
and Saipem in March 2007 for the early work for the hook-up.
Phase 1 of the project, dubbed the experimental program, is
due online in late 2012 and will be under the responsibility of Eni
SPA. Under Phase 1, oil production is expected to reach 300,000
b/d, increasing to 450,000 b/d during Phase 2 (OGJ Online, Feb.
2, 2009). The field, which is 80 km southeast of Atyrau, is expected
to reach plateau production of 1.5 million b/d by the end of the
next decade.
Saipem’s portion of the contract is worth $1 billion while Aker
Solutions’ contract value is $1.6 billion.
Kashagan is one of the world’s largest discoveries in the last 40

Kuwait, China to build Guangdong reﬁnery

PetroChina selects Chevron’s RDS technology

Kuwait and China have signed an agreement to establish a $9
billion, 300,000 b/d refinery at Zhanjiang, a city on the coast of
Guangdong province in southwestern China.
Under terms of the agreement the refinery will be built in
Zhanjiang instead of in Guangzhou, as originally planned, due to
environmental concerns.
Sinopec will hold a 50% stake in the venture, which is scheduled
to start operations in 2013, while state-owned Kuwait Petroleum
International will hold 30%. The remaining 20% will be divided
equally between Dow Chemical Co. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC.

PetroChina Sichuan has awarded a contract to Chevron Lummus Global to provide residual desulfurization (RDS) technology
to the new processing facility in Pengzhou County, Chengdu City,
in China’s Sichuan province.
The RDS unit will process 3 million tonnes/year of resid and
vacuum gas oil for pretreatment to a resid fluid catalytic cracker.
The RDS unit will employ CLG’s upflow reactor technology, an advanced guard bed technology that minimizes pressure drop buildup in the guard bed.
The facility will be designed to process heavy crudes and will
meet modern environmental and industrial standards. ✦

Southern Corridor Summit produces agreement
The Southern Corridor Summit on May 8 in Prague produced
“an agreement on a common strategy and clear scheduling for the
completion of relevant projects” contributing to diversification of energy sources and routes for the European gas supplies, said European
10

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Commission Pres. Jose Manuel Barroso.
The southern gas corridor is one of the European Union’s highest energy security priorities to develop gas supplies from Caspian
and Middle Eastern sources and possibly other countries in the
longer term. The Prague summit brought together Barroso and the
EU’s revolving president, Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek,
with potential partners from Azerbaijan, Egypt, Georgia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.
It also was attended by Russia, the US, and Ukraine as observers
as well as members of the international financial institutions.
A joint declaration was signed by the EU presidents and the
leaders of Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey, and Egypt but not by gasrich Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, or Uzbekistan. Iraq’s oil minister
did not sign either, but Barroso indicated EU negotiations for a
memorandum of understanding to export Iraqi gas to Europe.
Barroso declared, “Today we have commitments from producer,
transit, and consumer countries. We now need to work quickly on
the follow-up.” Pending gas line projects were bolstered by the
signing of the declaration.
By midyear, Barroso wants to see the signing in Turkey of the intergovernmental agreement on the Nabucco gas line slated to bring
gas from Central Asia to the EU while avoiding Russia. By yearend,
he also expects strong support for the Italy-Greece interconnector
project as well as conclusion of a feasibility study on the possible
shape of the Caspian Development Corp. initiative in cooperation
with international financial institutions. This should lead to concrete proposals for obtaining sufficient gas volumes to be transported through the Southern Corridor including encouraging the
market-based participation of public and private companies.
Barroso called the Southern Corridor “a new Silk Road” opening the potential for enhanced relations with the countries of the
Southern Caucasus and Central Asia.
The memorandum of understanding between the EU and Iraq
would receive strong support as well as cooperation between the
EU and Egypt to determine specific projects to develop Egypt’s gas
reserves and the export potential for the EU via the Southern Corridor. ✦

Quick to hire, ﬁre
I read with interest your editorial in
the Apr. 13 issue, which quite rightly
pointed out the recruitment problems
of the oil and gas industry and how
these have shifted dramatically in recent
months (OGJ, Apr. 13, 2009, p. 18).
However, I think the article misses the
more fundamental truth in focusing yet
again on the industry’s perceived “image” problem. Rather than banging the
familiar drum about how the younger
generation sees no future in the oil and
gas industry, should we not worry that
they see the industry only too clearly—
as one that is quick to hire and even
quicker to fire?
There is nothing more dispiriting
to someone who has undergone 4 or
5 years of university training and been
promised a glittering future than to see
it all snatched away because the industry itself cannot plan its future sensibly.
Nor is it any use in blaming it on the
Obama administration and the move to
a low carbon future since the oil and gas
industry has been successfully shooting
itself in the recruitment foot for many
years before.
Sarah Beacock
Professional Affairs Director
Energy Institute
London

Shot in the foot
Again, the oil and gas industry has
shot itself in the foot by not making an
effort to explain to the public why gas
prices have gone up 20¢/gal in the last
10 days or so. Even my wife is screaming
collusion.
The industry continually wrings it
hands over its public image but continues to ignore the obvious places to open
a dialog with the public. Why was there
so public explanation concerning the
relationship to crude prices, the usage
of summer-grade gasoline in places like
Houston, etc.?
When will the titans of this industry
realize they have to reach out to the public when there is an opportunity to open
a dialog and make a point. The obvious
answer is never.
Stan Thurber
Spring,Tex.

FIRST OF TWO PARTS

Alaskan tax reform:
Intent met with oil

T E R E S T
In 2006 and 2007 the State of Alaska
undertook fundamental reforms to its
oil and gas production tax, making it
much more progressive. Among the
goals of these reforms, two were key.
One was to capture more value for the
state at higher energy prices. As the
legislature was debating the reforms
in 2006, prices for Alaska North Slope
(ANS) crude for the first time crossed
the $40/bbl barrier.
An equal or more important goal
was to improve the environment for
attracting investments needed to slow
or reverse the decline in the state’s
oil production. Forecast to average
701,000 b/d in the current state fiscal year of 2009, production had exceeded 2 million b/d in the late 1980s.
This article will show that the
2006-07 production tax reforms were
phenomenally successful for the state.
Alaska collected several billion dollars
in additional oil production tax revenue
as prices for ANS crude peaked above
$140/bbl in the summer of 2008. The

If sufficient investment can be attracted
to build a pipeline to transport gas from
the North Slope to market, a feature of the
state’s production tax may limit performance under high oil prices similar to
the 2008 spike. Although it is too early to
tell how well the second goal of increased
investment has been achieved, in this series we identify additional concerns about
how some of the investment incentives
might work if a new pipeline to export
gas is added to the mix.

The ﬁscal system

State government in Alaska gets
most of its general-fund revenue from
four oil and gas mechanisms that are a
mixture of progressive and regressive
elements. Over the past decade, depending on prices, oil and gas have provided
68-93% of the state’s general-fund

required or the expense of finding,
developing, and producing the oil or
gas. Alaska’s fiscal design for oil and gas
has evolved substantially in the past 3
years and consists of four mechanisms
Arctic Drilling and Production
(Fig 1).
There also is a property tax of 2% of
assessed value on oil and gas real property (though not on the lease or hydrocarbons). The tax is split between the
state and the municipalities in which
the property is located. This is relatively
insensitive to the profits (or losses)
generated by changes in the price of the
oil or gas in the market.
There is a corporate net income tax

economic limit factor (ELF). The ELF was
0.0 for small fields (hence leading to
zero tax), and by 2006 averaged about
0.5 for fields with a positive ELF, for an
effective tax rate of less than 8% of gross.
Although the nominal tax on gas was
10%, and the ELF mechanism involved
a different calculation, by 2006 the
effective rate on gas was also coincidentally around 8% of the gross. Price

was not a factor in calculating the ELF
multiplier. The ELF, adopted in 1979
and amended in 1989, was intended to
reduce production taxes on smaller, less
productive, older, and declining fields.
In 2006, then-Alaska Gov. Frank
Murkowski proposed replacing the
gross tax and ELF with a 20% tax rate
(base production tax, referred to then
as PPT but referred to in this article as
BPT) applied to the net. The tax would
be applied after allowing a deduction

and production costs.
Furthermore, to make investment
more attractive, capital investment
could be deducted as a cost as spent
and also would generate an additional
20% credit applicable against the BPT.
The proposal came to be known as the
20:20 PPT proposal.
Murkowski introduced this oil tax
reform to complement a gas pipeline fiscal contract negotiated under the Alaska
Stranded Gas Development Act with the
state’s three largest holders of gas-rich

*Analysis based on actual US West Coast prices and cost data. Fiscal 2008 values: taxable North Slope production—626,456 b/d (228.7 million bbl); lease expenditures—$16.83/bbl;
TT&T—$6.05/bbl; capital expenditure credits—$411.5 million. Table 2 uses taxable barrels, while Table 1 uses total barrels.

leases: BP, ConocoPhillips, and ExxonMobil. The administration hoped that
the fiscal stability built into that contract
would create a viable investment climate
to enable financing and construction of a
gas line to the Lower 48.
After extensive hearings consuming
the better part of several special legislative sessions, the legislature passed a
reformed oil and gas production tax
in August 2006, retroactive to Apr. 1,
2006. Although the key ideas from
Murkowski’s proposal remained intact,
the legislature imposed its own amendments to the administration’s proposal
and added a higher base tax rate and a
progressivity mechanism.
This progressivity feature, called here
24

the combined progressivity tax (CPT),
added an extra 0.25% to the overall
tax rate for every dollar the per-barrel
net (production tax value, or PTV) was
above $40 (until the CPT rate reached
a maximum of 25%). For example, if
per-barrel costs were $25 and that barrel could be sold for $85, an additional
5% CPT would be added to the base
production tax rate.
How was this CPT calculated? For
the sake of simplicity we will ignore
royalty and start with $85/bbl oil and
subtract $25 in costs to yield a PTV of
$60. Subtracting the $40 progressivity trigger from the $60 yields $20.
The CPT rate was calculated as 0.25%
times $20, which equals 5% additional

tax above the base rate. The legislature
(along with many other changes) also
increased the BPT to 22.5% from the
proposed 20%, so in this example the
nominal tax rate would be 27.5%, the
sum of 22.5% BPT and 5% CPT.
Meanwhile, the legislature declined
to take up Murkowski’s controversial
gas-line contract. Natural gas production taxes, however, were included in
the oil-reform legislation. Under the
new law, any taxable gas was converted
to oil on an energy-equivalent basis at
the rate of 6 MMbtu/bbl (which for a
cubic foot of gas with a heating value
of exactly 1,000 btu equals 6 Mcf/bbl).
Then these energy-equivalent barrels
of gas were added to the oil for the

Palin went on to

(who later lost his reelection bid in November 2008) and Murkowski’s chief
of staff, resulting in three guilty pleas
and Stevens’s conviction, subsequently
vacated.
Palin in September 2007 called a
special legislative session to modify
the production tax reforms and adopt
a production tax that Alaska’s citizens
could believe was free of corruption.
Her administration, after consulting
widely with outside experts, did not
propose a return to a gross tax and renewed its commitment to a net tax. Her
proposal—tagged as ACES, or Alaska’s
Clear and Equitable Share—included
raising the BPT from 22.5% to 25%.
The governor also proposed (1) that
for purposes of administrative ease,
progressivity be calculated on an annual basis instead of monthly, (2) the
progressivity trigger would kick in at
$30/boe instead of $40/boe, and (3)
the rate of progressivity would increase
more slowly at 0.2% per $1 above the
trigger instead of 0.25%.
The legislature met in special session
during October and November 2007
with oil prices in the $80/bbl range—
about double where they had been during the 2006 special session. Just as it
did when adopting the original reform
under Gov. Murkowski’s tenure, the legislature also imposed its own distinctive
stamp on the law adopted under Gov.
Palin—again focusing on progressivity.
The BPT was increased to 25%, as
the governor had requested. However,
the CPT remained on a monthly basis,
and while the trigger dropped to the
suggested $30/per boe, the rate was
increased to 0.4%/$1 above the trigger.
Using the example above of $85/bbl
oil and $25/bbl costs, the total production tax rate becomes 37%. The BPT
is 25%, and the CPT calculation is still
$85 less $25 for a PTV of $60/bbl. But
then subtracting the $30/bbl trigger
and multiplying the resulting $30 times
0.4% yields a CPT of 12% and a total
tax of 25% + 12%, or 37%. As detailed
above, this example produced a 27.5%
total tax rate under the 2006 law. The less
simplified version that includes royalty

can be seen in Table 3. (At PTVs above

to 0.1%/1 above the trigger, while total
progressivity was capped at 50%.)

Capturing premiums?

T E R E S T
that were realized in fiscal 2008, but the
legislature pushed up the progressivity
feature to achieve the nearly fivefold
increase illustrated.
Methodology No. 5 is the prevailing regime, so we can compare this
piece of the simplistic table with actual
results. This simplified model produces
a production tax liability of $7,032.2
million, about 3% different from the
actual production tax liabilities for fiscal
2008, $6,867.3 million as seen in the
last row of Column B of Table 1. Given
that Table 2 uses a single average price,
while the tax effects from deviation
from the average are not symmetrical,
and this analysis ignores other details
such as the small producer tax credit,
this is a surprisingly close match.
Fig. 2 illustrates the dollars flowing
to the state from the three methods
illustrated in Table 2 which incorporate a progressivity feature. Monthly
increments from the original method
enacted in 2006 (Methodology No. 3
on Table 2 with a 0.25%/$ factor and
$40/boe PTV threshold) are compared
to monthly increments from the revised
method enacted in 2007 (Methodology
No. 5 on Table 2 with a 0.4%/$ factor
and $30/boe PTV threshold). The flat
line on Table 2 illustrates the annual
application of progressivity as proposed
by the Palin administration in 2007
(Methodology No. 4 on Table 2 with a
0.2%/$ factor and a $30/boe PTV).
We do not have sufficient data to say
whether the goals pertinent to increased
investment are being achieved. Furthermore, whatever capital budgeting announcements made by producers when
prices were high must be reexamined
in the context of lower crude oil price
environments. Pioneer brought on the
new 90 million bbl Oooguruk field in
August of 2008 under the new fiscal
regime, but Eni in March 2009 announced it was delaying development at
Nikaitchuq, a $1.5 billion project.

In 2008, oil prices hit extraordinary
levels. How did the legislature do at
capturing those premiums? There are
several ways of looking at this, and we
present two.
The first looks at the increase in production taxes from fiscal 2004 through
2008 (Table 1).
While Column B of Table 1—annual
production tax revenue—shows the
increase is more than an order of magnitude from roughly $650 million to
$6.9 billion, it doesn’t tell how much
of the change was due to the change in
rules and how much was due to change
in prices, production, or costs. At least
the first two can be factored out in the
following exercise. Column G of Table 1
shows that from fiscal 2004 to 2008 the
product of market value times volume
roughly doubled.
Similarly, Column J of Table 1 shows
the royalty—rules for which didn’t
change—paid to the state over the
same period doubled. Thus it appears
the net effect of the change in tax was
the tenfold increase divided by twofold
increase caused mostly by rising oil
prices. That is a fivefold increase caused
by the change to the production tax fiscal mechanism. (More specifically 10.7
divided by 2.2 equals 4.9.)
Another way of comparing these is to
look at the high prices that prevailed in
fiscal 2008 and assuming both constant
costs and volumes to evaluate them
under the five different production tax
designs discussed from 2005 to 2007.
Table 2 summarizes such an analysis.
Table 2 also confirms a fivefold increase due to the tax reforms excluding
oil price changes. Murkowski’s proposal
would have been a doubling of the

Nonproducing lease deﬁnition needed, DOI’s Salazar told
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
US House Interior Appropriations
Subcommittee leaders asked Secretary
of the Interior Ken Salazar a basic question when he presented his department’s fiscal 2010 budget request on
May 13: How does Interior define a
nonproducing lease?
Salazar couldn’t supply an answer,
but promised to develop one soon and
consult with subcommittee members
about it. He’s already under pressure
because the Obama administration’s
proposed federal budget includes $122
million of annual revenue from fees on
nonproducing leases starting Oct 1.
Salazar doesn’t question the idea
behind the assessment. “I’ve practiced
water law in the West. States’ water laws
have a similar use-it-or-lose-it feature.
Oil and gas are similarly precious com-

modities,” he told the subcommittee.
But Salazar also couldn’t answer the
question when Rep. Michael K. Simpson
(R-Ida.), the subcommittee’s ranking
minority member, asked what DOI considers a nonproducing lease eligible for
collection of the proposed $4/acre fee.
“I think this is important, particularly if someone could be penalized for
bureaucratic or legal delays which aren’t
his fault,” Simpson said. Officials from
one of DOI’s major agencies, the US
Bureau of Land Management, told the
subcommittee last year that it can take
up to 4 years for a federal oil and gas
lessee to simply get a drilling permit,
he added.

‘Would be unfair’
The subcommittee’s chairman, Rep.
Norman D. Dicks (D-Wash.), broke
in. “I have to agree with my colleague.
It does take time to go through the
permitting process. I think it would be

unfair to penalize someone starting the
day they acquire the lease. You need to
give them some time,” he told Salazar.
Independent producers have been
asking federal policymakers what would
constitute a nonproducing lease since
the US House Natural Resources Committee proposed instituting the charge
last year in addition to bonus bids and
rentals which the US Minerals Management Service and BLM already receive.
“We asked the committee’s staff if
their definition included leases where
development was delayed by litigation.
They said ‘yes,’” said Daniel T. Naatz,
vice-president of federal resources and
political affairs at the Independent Petroleum Association of America.
The idea that a producer would
lease a tract and not develop it doesn’t
make sense, Naatz said. “There isn’t any
company which will pay bonuses and
bids and then sit on a lease. If they get a
sense that a lease isn’t working, they’re

Issues beyond
cap-and-trade

I

n a sense, some pressure was off
American Petroleum Institute Pres.
Jack N. Gerard the morning of May
18.
The US House Energy and Commerce Committee was scheduled
to begin marking up HR 2454 that
afternoon. The bill, cosponsored by
Reps. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.),
the committee’s chairman, and Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), who chairs
its Environment and Energy Subcommittee, aimed to address global climate change by establishing a carbon
cap-and-trade system in the US.
But when API and Gerard originally planned to hold a teleconference
with reporters that morning, they
thought the US Senate also would be
considering bills that would impose
new taxes on domestic producers and
refiners, and possibly further restrict
access to US supplies.
The two committees with jurisdiction on those proposals delayed
consideration until after Memorial
Day. So Gerard and the reporters who
questioned him concentrated on the
reworked Waxman-Markey proposal,
which its sponsors had released the
afternoon of May 15.

research so far.
“When you look closely at investments in greenhouse gas emission
technology by all US industries and
the federal government from 2000 to
2006, 45% came from the oil and gas
industry. That makes us the leading
investor,” he said.
Cap-and-trade may have been
more immediate, but Gerard suggested that taxes and access still mattered.
“What the president talks about is
reducing reliance on non-US sources.
But he also has indicated the need to
produce more oil and gas domestically,” he said.

Not consistent

The proposed taxes in the administration’s fiscal 2010 budget
request are not consistent with that
strategy, API’s president continued.
“It’s very difficult to increase domestic production when you’re taking
away incentives to do so. The best
thing for economic development and
increasing government revenue is to
encourage more domestic oil and gas
development,” he said.
When it came to access, Gerard
said he has spoken personally with

going to relinquish it,” he told OGJ following the subcommittee’s hearing.
“What we’ve always said is that
even if they know what leases are not
producing, they give lessees no credit
for bureaucratic delays, environmental
challenges, and other obstructions,”
said Independent Petroleum Association
of Mountain States’ government affairs
director Kathleen Sgamma, who also
was in Washington on May 13.
Sgamma said IPAMS members
normally take 5-6 years to complete
a comprehensive analysis for a federal
environmental impact statement before
drilling their first well on a federal
onshore lease. Small projects of fewer
than 10 wells which qualify for the less
complicated environmental assessment
take 2-3 years, she said.

‘The only way’
“We’ve proposed working with Secretary Salazar to help him understand
all the work that’s done to comply with
a lease’s terms and requirements. That’s
the only way he can accurately determine if or why a lease isn’t producing,”
Sgamma told OGJ.
She noted that Mary L. Kendall, DOI’s
acting inspector general, said in a Feb.
27 report to Salazar that BLM and MMS
use different definitions for non-producing properties. “There are so many
data inconsistencies and incompatibilities between the two agencies that it’s
not surprising DOI can’t tell what leases
are producing or not producing,” she
said.
In the report, which is posted online
at the DOI IG’s web site, Kendall said in
a cover letter to the secretary that investigators “found numerous data integrity
issues and confirmed that [DOI] cannot
compel companies to develop their
federal leases.”
The examination, which the DOI
IG’s office began in July 2008 at Dicks’s
request, found that the department has
no formal policy to compel companies
to bring leases into production, and
that BLM and MMS risk losing millions
of dollars in royalties because their

tracking systems are not compatible. In
one case, a communications breakdown
between the two agencies could have
resulted in nearly $6 million of royalties being lost over 5 years if the lessee
had not sent its first production report
to both bureaus and not just BLM. “The
existing process is heavily reliant on
companies doing the right thing,” the
report said.
In one inconsistency example, investigators found that BLM considers every
lease contained in a unit producing,
even though a well may not have been
drilled on every lease and every lease
within the unit is not paying royalties.
Leases in a unit which are not required
to pay royalties are categorized as “held
by location in a producing unit,” according to the report. It noted that MMS
reports leases which are not paying
royalties as nonproducing both onshore
and offshore in areas it administers,
regardless of whether they are part of a
producing unit.

Deﬁnitions differ
“Consequently, leases that are identified as producing by BLM may be
reported as nonproducing by MMS,” it
said, adding that BLM defines onshore
leases determined to be capable of producing paying quantities as commercial
as producing while MMS considers
them nonproducing.
Investigators also learned during
their examination that the lease development process has many variables
that are not immediately apparent,
it continued. “For example, due to
inherent geologic uncertainties, there
is no guarantee that any given lease
contains oil and gas in commercial
quantities. Also, because each lease
property is unique, data from currently producing leases cannot be used to
predict the volume of oil and gas that
might be extracted from other leases,”
it said.
“Overall, DOI could do much more
to track the status of nonproducing

leases, but it may not be able to do
much to promote production. Absent
new policy or legislative direction, both
industry and bureau officials cautioned
that mandating production on all federal leases or increasing lease fees would
not necessarily enhance production and
could, in fact, reduce industry interest
in federal leases,” the report indicated.
Naatz said that the assessment would
also be collected on offshore tracts,
which could generate significant revenue because they are much larger than
onshore tracts. But the impact would be
greater on smaller independent producers who primarily work onshore, and
who face a possible increase in fees for
processing each drilling permit application to $6,500 from $4,000 and other
expenses, he pointed out.
“It’s the proverbial death-by-a-thousand-cuts for smaller operators who are
facing hard economic times because
of depressed commodity prices,” he
explained. ✦

“By using energy wisely and making

Barclays weighs in on LNG debate
Speculation about whether greater numbers of
LNG spot cargoes will come to US terminals this
summer was also the subject of a recent report from
Barclays Capital Research.
The range of estimates for US LNG imports in
2009 is “unusually wide,” said the report. It noted
that higher prices in Europe may attract all spot LNG
or, on the other hand, a paucity of storage capacity
elsewhere in the world “will push most of the global
oversupply into the US despite low prices.”
“Both arguments have merit,” it said, but neither
accurately considers current LNG markets in their
entirety.
Outside the US, storage capacity is limited. The
size of liquefaction capacity additions coming online
over the next 12-15 months and a “sharp contraction
in [LNG] demand,” the rest of the world is unlikely to
be able to absorb all the excess.
There are, however, pockets of consumption
strength, said Barclays, and the market might be
underestimating Europe’s ability to take more gas.
That could be the case because of Europe’s “low
inventories, growing gas-ﬁred power generation and
expanding regasiﬁcation capacity.”
Also, the LNG spot market is at a “ﬂedgling stage,
with limited history to suggest how these factors may
interact.” This year, with an imminent global oversupply and more market participants “looking to arbitrage regional natural gas prices, the LNG industry
is about to test just how global the gas market has
become.”
Barclays does believe US LNG imports will grow
in 2009, just not as rapidly as “liquefaction additions
and economic trends in Asia and Europe alone would
suggest.”

consumption for 2010. This will come despite minor
consumption declines in residential and commercial
sectors that will result from anticipated nearly 1% fewer
heating degree-days than in 2009.

Production, imports
EIA expects total US marketed natural gas production
to decline by 1% this year and by 2.8% in 2010.
Poor economic conditions and lower natural gas
prices by May had reduced total working natural gas rigs
by 54% since August 2008. The erosion of drilling activity combined with production curtailments in response
to current and projected low prices and high inventory
levels will push down gas production in the Lower 48

expects to increase by 3.4% this year as
production rigs damaged by Hurricanes
Gustav and Ike as well as new production from offshore oil projects come
on line. Despite expectations of higher
prices in 2010, the “lagged effects of
the downturn in drilling this year and
the natural decline in productivity from
existing wells” will contribute to lower
production in both Lower-48 nongulf
and federal gulf regions in 2010, said
the report.
EIA has taken note of the considerable uncertainty among LNG observers over the outlook for global LNG
balance (OGJ, May 4, 2009, p. 49). It
says that expected weak gas demand
in LNG-consuming countries of Asia
and Europe, start-up of new liquefaction capacity (in Qatar, eastern Russia,
Indonesia, Malaysia—2009; Peru and
Australia—2010), and limited gas storage capacity in markets that typically
rely on LNG will increase LNG available
to the US.
With this in mind, EIA predicts the
US will see an increase of about 500
bcf in supply via LNG imports in 2009
and another 650 bcf in 2010. But, as
32

the debate among observers testifies,
increased availability does not necessarily translate into imports. US natural
gas prices have consistently been below
those in Asia and Europe (see sidebar,
p. 31).
Nevertheless, the highly liquid US
market, with its extensive pipeline
systems and burgeoning storage, may
trump its low prices in attracting spot
LNG cargoes by default from European
and Asian markets with higher prices
but less physical flexibility.
Pipeline imports, EIA said, mainly
from Canada, will decline by about 7%
this year as a result of suspended drilling and declining well productivity.

Working natural gas in US storage at
May 1 stood at 1.9 tcf with that inventory 362 bcf above the 5-year average
(2004-08; Fig. 2) and 491 bcf above
the same week in 2008.
Natural gas working inventory will
peak at more than 3.6 tcf at the end of
October, said EIA, surpassing the previous record of slightly more than 3.5 tcf
at the end of October 2007.
Working-gas inventory has typically
reached maximum during the first 2
weeks of November, with the earliest
seasonal peak reported the week ending
Oct. 20, 2006, and the latest peak the
week ending Nov. 30, 2001.
Henry Hub spot prices averaged
$3.62/Mcf in April this year, $0.46/
Mcf less than the average spot price in
March and pushed down by slowing
economic activity. EIA expects no significant rise in average spot prices before
cooler temperatures arrive in the fall to
increase demand for space heating.
Although the seasonal boost in gas
consumption will strengthen prices,
robust storage levels will dampen any
upward price movement through
winter 2009-10, said the report. As the
expected economic improvement contributes to demand recovery in 2010,
however, sustained lower production
levels could lead to higher prices later
in 2010.
The Henry Hub spot price will average $4.06/Mcf this year and $5.21/Mcf
in 2010. ✦

It pointed out that 70-80% of total—
or “wells-to-wheels”—emissions result
from combustion of oil products for all
sources of crude oil.
“The difference in total carbon emissions from oil sands to that of other
crude oil sources occurs mainly in the
extraction and processing phases—also
called ‘well-to-retail pump’ or ‘well-topump’,” it said (see figure).
The study called Canadian oil sands
“one of the most important sources of
supply growth in the past decade,” noting that production has increased to 1.3
million b/d at present from 600,000
b/d in 2000.
Depending on global economic
conditions, oil prices, environmental
regulation, and the pace of innovation,
production from the Canadian oil sands

the study projected.

the terminal’s location and the reluctance of most vessels to traverse Cape

that the commissioning cargo will be

Asia, possibly Australia.

China plans host of domestic petrochemical plants
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
China, concerned over forecasts of
increased competition from Middle
Eastern petrochemicals suppliers,
reported plans to construct a host of
domestic petrochemical plants.
China’s new plans, however, are
causing concern in Southeast Asia that
production will outstrip demand and
lead to lower prices, particularly after
recently announced increases in the
Middle East.
According to its 2009-11 industry
support and development blueprint,
China’s State Council plans to raise the
country’s ethylene production capacity
by 51.2% to 15.5 million tonnes/year.
Chinese refineries currently produce
about 47.6% of the 21 million tpy of
ethylene consumed in the country.
The new plants apparently are in
addition to current Chinese efforts to
increase output capacity, including plans
by PetroChina to complete a 1 million
tpy addition to its 220,000 tpy ethylene
plant in Dushanzi, Xinjiang province.
PetroChina also is doubling the annual capacity of its ethylene plant in
Daqing, Heilongjiang province, to 1.2
million tpy, while rival Sinopec is building two 1 million tpy ethylene plants,
one in Ningbo and the other in Tianjin.

Competing with Middle East
Eyeing the substantial increase in
the production of ethylene, industry
observers said the government’s plan is
aimed largely at enabling the country to
34

compete with Middle Eastern producers, who are boosting output.
Chinese concern over increased
Middle Eastern production of petrochemicals emerged in April at Lnoppen’s 4th Annual Petrochemical Summit
held in Tianjin, China.
“A group of new ethylene and
downstream petrochemical projects in
the Middle East will be completed and
put on stream from 2009 to 2010,”
said one Chinese oil and gas official,
who declined to be named.
“As the demand for petrochemicals in the Middle East is limited, after
the completion of these projects great
quantities of petrochemicals will be
likely to flow into the Chinese market,”
the official said.
“Petrochemicals from the Middle
East have very strong price competitive edge and have great impact on the
Chinese market,” he said.
According to Hu Jie, the chief engineer of PetroChina Refining & Chemicals Co. Ltd., Middle Eastern refineries
will more than double their production
capacity of three major types of polyethylene (PE) to 14.81 million tpy in
2012 from 6.04 million tpy in 2007.
Hu said the buildup of ethylene
production capacity in the Middle East
scheduled to start operation in 2009
and 2010 will lead to “the flooding”
of China’s market with downstream
petrochemicals.
“The Middle East has already exported several hundred thousand tonnes
of PE products to the Chinese market in
the first quarter of this year, but most of

it is of low quality,” Hu said.
However, Hu said a much larger
volume of higher-quality products will
enter the Chinese market in the second
half of this year once the new Middle
Eastern refineries start production.
As a result, he said, the next few
months will be a challenging time for
China’s petrochemical producers as they
attempt to clear inventories amid an influx of Middle Eastern PE products into
the Chinese market.

Price competition
However, BOC International analyst
Lawrence Lau said Beijing’s aggressive
expansion in ethylene could lead to
keen price competition and low profits
in the region, given the Middle East’s
major expansion plans with much of its
output aimed at the Chinese mainland.
That view was shared and broadened
by Gordon Kwan, head of regional
energy research for Hong Kong-based
Mirae Assets Securities.
“Given China is about half selfsufficient in ethylene, if PetroChina and
Sinopec do realize Beijing’s aggressive
targets, it will be bad news for regional
producers in Japan, Singapore, Taiwan,
and Thailand as they rely on exports to
China to keep utilization rates high,”
Kwan told the South China Morning
Post.
Stan Park, deputy managing director
of Petrochemical Corp. of Singapore,
expressed similar concerns, saying that
the key issue for the region’s industry is

and China.
“We are in for volatile times, and we
are all holding our breath,” Park told
Singapore’s Business Times earlier this
month, adding that additional facilities
in the Middle East and China will affect
plants in Singapore as well as Southeast
Asia generally.
Still, he noted there has been a sustained recovery in China, with petrochemical demand back to about 90% of
what it was before the global downturn.
Continued Chinese demand—if it holds
up—will offset the new Gulf and Chinese capacity, he said. If not, Park said,
sales could fall by 10-20%. ✦

Brazil, China agree on $10 billion loan package
Brazil’s Petroleo Brazileiro SA (Petrobras) completed negotiations with the
China Development Bank for a 10-year,
$10 billion bilateral credit line.
“The $10 billion is going to be used
in our strategic plan that needs [the investment of] $174.4 billion from now
until 2013,” said Petrobras Chief Executive Jose Sergio Gabrielli de Azevedo.
The 10-year loan agreement was
signed on the second day of a recent
3-day visit to Beijing by Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva between
state visits to Saudi Arabia and Turkey.
The Brazilian firm said the loan,
which includes funding for the purchase of goods and services from
Chinese companies, also includes an
increase in oil exports from Brazil to
China.
“A long-term export agreement

between Petrobras and Unipec Asia, a
Sinopec subsidiary, was also foreseen,”
Petrobras said. The agreement calls for
a sales volume of 150,000 b/d of oil
during the first year and 200,000 b/d
in the following 9 years.
The loan was not tied to the oil
supply agreement or any other cooperation between Petrobras and Chinese
refiners, Gabrielli said. He added that
China would pay market prices for the
oil shipments, and the $10 billion loan
would be repaid in US dollars at an
interest rate of less than 6.5%.
The loan agreement with Brazil is the
latest of several similar arrangements
that China has made with suppliers of
oil, including a $10 billion oil-for-loan
deal with Kazakhstan, and $25 billion
to Russian oil and pipeline companies. ✦

Record attendance levels experienced at the Apr. 20-24 Southeast Asia
Petroleum Exploration farmout forum
in Singapore signal an undiminished
level of interest in regional exploration
prospects.
The SEAPEX showing surprised
many organizers and attendees in view
of the world economic slump and
the price of oil. Some 650 attended

against the 550 expected. This bodes
well for 2009-12 exploration in Southeast Asia. World class presentations,
posters, and papers demonstrated the
vast potential of the some 10 million
plus sq km of onshore and offshore
areas in the region.
The object of this article is not to
dwell on the significance of the vast
exploration licences and plays that can
be enjoyed by majors and independent
consortia in Southeast Asia. Rather, we
have taken one of the smallest licenses
in the region, SC 52 covering 960 sq
km in northeast Luzon, Philippines, to
demonstrate what can be done with
careful research of existing data.

With the recent downturn in both
oil prices and economic activity, low
to midcap exploration companies have
been hit particularly hard.
The prices these companies earn
from production is now below 2005
levels, yet costs in association with drilling remain above double those of the
same period. The consequent slashing
of exploration budgets globally has
limited the scope of junior exploration
companies, but low-risk, low-cost plays,
with an easy access to end-user markets
still provide a way forward.
Southeast Asia stands out as a particularly attractive region in which to
pursue such opportunities.
The lessons learned during the Asian
financial crisis of the late 1990s have
left middle-income countries such as
Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and
the Philippines somewhat resilient to
the economic downswing. A similar
resistance can be seen in the lowerincome countries in the region, with
their underdeveloped financial markets
providing a buffer against the adverse
economic environment.
On the whole, Southeast Asia appears
to have better economic parameters in
view of the slump in other parts of the
world, and as such it is likely a better
place to explore.

Mabuhay Philippines
With its competitive fiscal regime,
the Philippines stands out among
Southeast Asian countries as a potential
candidate for low-cost exploration and
one that, until recently, has been largely
ignored.
Boasting a low entry price, enticing
incentives for collaboration with local
partners, and a posttax contractor share
of 30-45% of revenue, the Philippines
has seen a resurgence of exploration
activity in recent years.
The country has been largely abandoned since the mid-1970s, but the
now-stable regulatory environment
coupled with the successfully producing Malampaya gas project have paved
the way for a revival. Most of the recent

focus has been in the highly prospective
Palawan basin, but this is just one of a
number of potential oil and gas producing basins in the Philippines.
With an estimated resource potential
of a few hundred million barrels of oil
equivalent, and the only other producing gas field in the Philippines besides
Malampaya, the Cagayan basin, Northern Luzon, is another “old haunt” now
being revisited. It is a backarc basin of
generally north-south orientation that
covers about 28,000 sq km of Luzon
Island with sedimentary fill estimated to
be as thick as 9 km in some areas.

Service Contract 52
SC 52, in the northern Cagayan
basin, is one of the smallest service
contracts in the Philippines.
It was awarded to E.F. Durkee & Associates Inc. in mid-2005. After careful
review of the existing data all indicators
suggested that SC 52 was a highly prospective block with the Cagayan Valley
providing a large onshore geological
basin that has all the elements needed
to perhaps provide important gas discoveries.

westerly foothills of the basin together

New correlations provide modified black-oil
(MBO) pressure-volumetemperature (PVT) properties when fluid samples
are unavailable.
Production
One can use the
correlations in generalized material balance calculations and
MBO simulations. The new correlations
match the fluid properties of a selected
database and the authors also validated
them with generalized material balance
calculations.
To develop the new corrections,
the authors modified existing solution
gas-oil ratio, oil formation volume factor, and gas formation-volume factor
correlations to increase their accuracy
when used with gas condensates and
volatile oils.
The new correlations have an accuracy within 10.4% for gas condensate
and 15% for volatile oil samples used in
this study.

MBO approach
Several authors have shown that an
MBO approach could replace compositional simulation in many applications for modeling gas condensate and
volatile oil reservoirs.
This work developed a new set of
MBO PVT correlations. The four PVT
functions are:
1. Rv, oil-gas ratio.
2. Rs, solution gas-oil ratio.
3. Bo, oil formation volume factor.
4. Bg, gas formation volume factor.
To our knowledge, a correlation for
calculating oil-gas ratio did not exist in
the petroleum literature. Without this
correlation, the analysis required for
generating the oil-gas ratio required a
combination of laboratory experiments
and elaborate calculation procedures
using equation of state models.
The new Rv correlation depends on
only readily available parameters in the
field and can have wide applications
when representative fluid samples are
unavailable.

O D U C T I O N

Previous work
In 1973, Spivak and Dixon introduced the MBO simulation approach.1
The MBO simulation considers three
components; dry gas, oil, and water. The
main difference between the conventional black-oil simulation and the MBO
simulation, also called extended blackoil, lies in the treatment of the liquid in
the gas phase.

New correlations calculate volatile
oil, gas condensate PVT properties
The MBO approach assumes that the
stock-tank liquid component can exist
in both liquid and gas phases under
reservoir conditions. It also assumes
that one can define the liquid content
of the gas phase as a sole function of
pressure called vaporized oil-gas ratio,
Rv, also referred to as rs2. This function is similar to the solution gas-oil
ratio, Rs, normally used to describe
the amount of gas-in-solution in the
liquid phase.
Whitson and Torp presented a procedure to calculate MBO properties from
PVT experimental data of gas condensate.2 Coats also presented a different
procedure for gas condensate fluids.3
Coats’s procedure was extended by
McVay for volatile oil fluids.4 Walsh and
Towler (OGJ, July 31, 1994, p. 83) also
presented a procedure to calculate MBO
PVT properties from constant volume
depletion (CVD) experiment data.5
Fattah et al. (OGJ, Mar. 27, 2006,
p. 35) showed that both Whitson and
Torp’s and Coats’s procedures provide

Fluid samples
The petroleum literature has reported many cases where the MBO
approach replaced more expensive
compositional simulation. Generating
MBO PVT properties requires a representative fluid sample that undergoes
enough laboratory experiments. Then,
one usually constructs EOS models
to match the laboratory experimental
results, although there are other less accurate techniques.6

One can output the MBO properties at appropriate separator conditions
using one of the procedures suggested
in literature. This process requires the
availability of a representative fluid
sample in addition to the skills of EOS
modeling.
The set of correlations presented
in this article can generate MBO PVT
properties without the need for fluid
samples or an elaborate procedure for
EOS calculations. The application of
these correlations is of particular importance especially when a representative sample is unavailable.
Our study used 13 reservoir fluid
samples (8 gas condensates and 5 volatile oils). The samples were from reservoirs at different locations and depth
and covered a wide range of oil and gas
fluid characteristics.
Table 1 shows the major properties
of the 13 fluid samples. Reference 9
presented the PVT experiments for all
these samples. Some samples represent
near critical fluids (VO 2, VO 5, GC 1,
and GC 2) as explained by McCain and
Bridges.10

Approach
For every sample in Table 1, we constructed an EOS model that matched as
best as possible the experimental results
of all available PVT laboratory experiments that included constant composition expansion (CCE), constant volume
depletion (CVD), differential liberation
(DL), and separator tests.
For consistency, we developed all
EOS models using the Peng and Robinson EOS with volume shift correction
(three-parameter EOS).11 We followed
the procedure suggested by Coats and
Smart to match the laboratory results.12
We then used the developed EOS
model for each sample to output MBO
PVT properties at different separator
conditions using Whitson and Torp’s
procedure.3
The MBO PVT properties include
the four functions required for MBO
simulation: Rv, Rs, Bo, and Bg. For each
of the four properties, we generated six
curves, representing six different sepaOil & Gas Journal / May 25, 2009

This is the second
of three articles that
describes BP’s experience with reciprocating
compressor damage from
liquids intrusion at two
Gas Processing
facilities, in Oklahoma
and Alaska.
Part 1 of the series (OGJ, May 18,
2009, p. 46) discussed the role of
changing operating conditions in leading to compressor damage and reviewed
details of the Oklahoma incident.
This second article reviews the validation of CFD modeling by on line laser
isokinetic probe sampling for liquid
entrainment and the impact of NGL
solubility in compressor lube oil.
The concluding article (OGJ, June 8,
2009) will examine the use of state-ofthe-art in-line cyclonic separation technology to mitigate liquid entrainment.
BP owns and operates the Milne
Point oil production facility on Alaska’s
North Slope where processing facilities are enclosed in heated, adjoining
modules. The gas compression module
houses two 3,450-hp reciprocating
compressors.
Over time, the frequency and severity of compressor component failures

increased. Intense examination identified both mechanical and processrelated causes for the failures, including
entrainment of water and NGLs in the
compressor suction.
Damage caused or exacerbated by ingested liquids included bearing failures,
damaged cylinder lining, sheared wrist
pins, sheared cylinder attachment bolts,
and cracked pistons.

mesh pads and vane packs were on
site if needed. The existing vane packs
were in nearly perfect condition and
were not replaced. The existing mesh
pads were only slightly worn, with no
fouling or other damage. Because the
mesh pads had to be removed to inspect
the vane packs, new mesh pads were
installed before the vessels were closed.

branch connections on the scrubber’s
vapor lines to allow for probe insertion.
WorleyParsons designed a mechanical
piping package to install the required
branch connections.

CFD modeling
On line carryover testing could not
be performed until the required connections were installed on the scrubber’s vapor overhead lines during the
next scheduled plant shutdown. In the
interim, CDS Separation Technology, a
subsidiary of FMC Technologies, was
engaged to prepare CFD models to provide a better understanding of scrubber
performance.
CFD model results indicate perfor-

mance problems with both scrubbers.
Scrubber V-5501 experiences significant
recirculation and maldistribution of
flow upstream of the mesh pad. This
reduces volume utilization of the vessel,
causing carryover of liquid droplets into
the gas outlet.
Also, the inlet baffle plate diverts
the feed stream downward onto the
gas-liquid interface, which causes
reentrainment of liquid particles and
interferes with liquid level detection
and control. Fig. 2, a snapshot from
the V-5501 CFD model run, shows this
inlet feed diversion and corresponding
flow maldistribution. The model predicted that volume utilization for this
vessel was 63.5% and that most liquid
droplets smaller than 50μ were carried
into the gas outlet nozzle.
Similar results were reported for
V-5511. Volume utilization was 81%,
higher than for V-5501 due to a lower
mean vapor velocity that results in less
internal turbulence. The overall liquid
carryover rate, however, was predicted
to be higher than for V-5501 due to a
lower density difference between the
liquid and gas phases.
The CFD models did not provide
precise predictions of liquid carryover
leaving the scrubbers. This would have
required accurate modeling of the vane
pack assemblies, which would have significantly increased both the complexity

of the models and the time and computing resources required to run them.

Laser sampling

isokinetic sampling probe (LISP) carryover testing were installed during
the summer 2008 plant shutdown. The

branch connection into the flowing
vapor stream. Fig. 3 shows the actual
branch connection for V-5511, alongside a Peerless sketch that illustrates
insertion of the hydraulic sample probe
into the vapor line.
A fluid sample flows through the
hydraulic probe into an external LISP
module, where two separate tests are
performed. First, a laser-based particle
counter yields particle size distribution
and total liquid entrainment values.
Second, the extracted sample flows
through a coalescing filter that captures
all entrained liquids and solids. Total
entrainment is determined by weight
difference of the filter elements.
Peerless Mfg. provided equipment
and personnel to perform this testing in
August 2008. Tests were conducted on
each suction scrubber under two conditions, with only Big B running (half
rate) and with both Big A and Big B
running (full rate). Peerless issued final
test reports in October 2008.

With only Big B running, liquid carryover was 1.37 gal/MMscf for V-5501

of pentane from the mixtures, but the
total volume of pentane that evaporated
was vastly different for each of the two
lube oil samples. After heating, the
synthetic oil mixture contained 4.96 wt
% pentane, compared with 12.13 wt
% pentane in the mineral oil mixture.
This equates to a retention of 22% of
the original pentane in the synthetic oil,
compared with 59% retention of original pentane in the mineral oil.
In other words, at the lab test
condition of 113° F., the mineral oil
retained more than 2.5 times as much
pentane as did the synthetic oil. At
higher temperatures, this disparity in
solubility between the two oils would
be even greater. As a point of reference,
the temperature inside the Nos. 1 and
2 cylinders on Big A/B ranges between
80-175° F.
The increased solubility of NGL in
mineral oil compared with synthetic
oil can be explained in terms of both
chemical and thermodynamic properties. The relatively low solubility of
pentane in the synthetic oil sample is
largely due to its chemical formulation,
which is proprietary. The particular oil
formerly used at Milne Point, however,
is primarily a mixture of poly-alphaolefins and poly-isobutylene, the latter
being responsible for the low NGL solubility.
From a thermodynamics standpoint,
HYSYS process simulations confirm the
lab test results. The existing Big A/B
compressor suction scrubbers do not
provide adequate vapor-liquid separation. This results in a mixed-phase
compressor suction stream (gas plus
entrained NGL). As shown previously in
Fig. 1, this liquid entrainment shifts the
dewpoint temperature of the gas-liquid
mixture upward by an amount that
depends entirely on the actual level of
entrainment.
If there were no interaction between
the entrained NGL and the cylinder
lube oil, then these entrained liquids
would vaporize early during each compression stroke as the cylinder temperature increased above the elevated gas
dewpoint. In actuality, however, lube oil

does interact with entrained NGL, as the
lab tests showed that both synthetic and
mineral oils dissolve and retain pentane.
Compared with the relatively minor
dewpoint shift without NGL-lube oil
interaction, whenever lube oil is dissolved in entrained NGL, even at low
concentrations, the dewpoint temperature of the compressed gas shifts
dramatically upward. This means that
NGL components that would otherwise
vaporize during the compression stroke
will remain in the liquid state during
the entire stroke.
The degree to which this phenomenon occurs largely depends on the type
and concentration of dissolved lube oil.
Because mineral oil has a much higher
affinity for NGL than does synthetic oil,
it can be expected to absorb and retain
NGL to a much greater degree. This is
consistent with the observed knocksensor trends, which showed a step
change increase after the August 2007
lube oil change.
In response to particularly high
knock readings in November 2007,
operators shut down Big A for inspection, which revealed a con rod bearing
failure. This failure was almost certainly
related to loss of cylinder lubrication
caused by lube oil dilution with entrained NGL, exacerbated by the change
from synthetic to mineral oil just 3
months earlier.
Research into the original plugging
problem with synthetic oil indicates
that a bad batch of oil from the manufacturer may have been responsible. Because in-line demisters will be installed
to remove entrained liquids from the
compressor suction streams, however,
there are no immediate plans to switch
back to synthetic oil for Big A/B cylinder lubrication.
Mineral oil is successfully used in
reciprocating compressors all over the
world and is expected to perform with
no negative side effects at Milne Point
once entrained liquids are no longer a
problem. ✦

For a pipeline coating
to be truly compatible
with cathodic protection
(CP), the coating should
allow CP protection to

ment occurs and water
penetrates between the
coating and pipe. CP must be adequate
to provide the needed current to significantly reduce or eliminate
the corrosion under the
nonshielding disbonded
coating.
Coatings that shield CP
when there is a disbondment are a major cause of
external corrosion problems on pipelines. Even with proper
application some coatings can disbond
through soil stress and other methods.

Study examines coating
compatibility with CP
Richard Norsworthy
Polyguard Products Inc.
Ennis,Tex.

Background
When applying CP to coated pipelines, end users must consider the
problems faced if the coating disbonds.
CP current is very effective when it has
a path to the pipe metal. Disbonded
coatings shielding CP, not lack of CP
itself, cause most external corrosion on
pipelines.
When disbondment or blistering
occurs most coatings divert current
from its intended path, preventing CP
current from adequately protecting the
external surfaces of a pipe. A coating
must conduct CP current even when
disbondment occurs to adequately
protect underground pipelines.1 Certain
pipeline coatings will allow CP current
to protect the pipe if disbondment occurs and water penetrates between the
coating and the pipe.
This article discusses the differences
between the two types of coating systems and how CP works with each.

Cathodic protection
The electrochemical process of
cathodic protection causes the environment around the cathode (pipe, tank,
Based on presentation to NACE Corrosion 2009,
Atlanta, Mar. 22-26, 2009.
52

etc.) to become alkaline, especially at
the surface of the metal being protected.
The pH of typical pipeline surfaces with
adequate CP should be 9-13. This range
protects steel and reduces or eliminates
corrosion.
Cathodic disbondment (CD) testing,
whether long or short-term, shows how
well the adhesion of the coating will
withstand the electrochemical process
of cathodic protection. Coatings need
to withstand the alkaline environment
as well as hydrogen evolution and other
potentially damaging electrochemical
changes, making successful CD testing a
requirement for pipeline coatings used
in conjunction with CP.
Every coating system has finite life
and eventually degrades, allowing oxygen, water, and chemicals to reach the
substrate.2 Increased CP often appears to
be the best or only solution to prevent
corrosion on a pipeline with poor or
disbonded coatings. Increasing CP may
help meet certain criteria and protect pipe exposed to electrolyte, but it
does not always protect the pipe under
disbonded coatings, allowing corrosion to continue unless the coatings are
replaced.
Increasing CP creates other problems,
including the possibility of further disbondment and coating deterioration, as
well as adding potential interference to
other systems and increasing costs.

Coating failure
Each coating manufacturer attempts
to make coatings that will not fail. Poor
surface preparation, application technique, soil stress, or selection of the
wrong coating for the environment
cause most failures. All coatings, however, experience disbondment, making behavior of a disbonded coating
important in the overall performance of
a coating system.3 4
Acidic and near neutral pH environments developed under disbonded
shielding pipeline coatings can lead to
corrosion and possibly environmentally
assisted cracking. As the coating deteriorates, however, and its permeability
to O2 increases, the corrosion rate deep

data source. Because many E&P companies
already have SharePoint and ESRI, OneTouch
adds significant value and increases the
return on investment by offering an easy to
use E&P domain-specific solution through
an advanced web browser.
Founded in 1994, Petris is a leading
supplier of data management solutions and

From the Subscribers Only area of

The unspoken
booms in some
reform debate
The secret of aggressive reform is often
just that: off-message information that
reformist politicians don’t want anyone to
know.
Energy reform pushed by the administration of US President Barack Obama, for
example, thunders with silence on the grotesque disproportion of cost relative to supply for “green energy,” toward which public
money now ﬂows without restriction.

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

Then there’s health care. Some observers think the overhaul Obama proposes
in this area would crush the economy and
lead to rationing of medical services. Administration ofﬁcials dispute those claims.
This writer has no expertise in health
care beyond his life-long strategy of avoiding, to the extent possible, patient-provider
interaction with doctors. But warnings
about crushed economies and waiting lists
for—heaven forbid—essential surgery get a
person’s attention. So who’s right?
Two inexpert observations seem
pertinent. One is what the administration
assiduously avoids in its discussions about
health care costs: medical malpractice
litigation.
Theodore H. Frank, director of the
American Enterprise Institute’s Legal Center
for the Public Interest, says the cost of “defensive medicine”—prescribed by doctors
as an antidote for malpractice litigation—
may be $30-180 billion/year. He made that
estimate in a March presentation to the
Senate Republican Conference, noting also
that malpractice liability lowers the supply
of medical service and thereby results in
the loss of “hundreds of lives a year and
perhaps even as high as 1,000 deaths and
many more exacerbated injuries a year.”
Those are indirect costs. Medical malpractice is a big part of the direct costs of
excess tort liability, which Frank estimates,
from analyses by Tillinghast-Towers Perrin,
at $128 billion/year.
Costs like these deserve attention in the
health-care debate. Yet tort reform appears
nowhere on the Obama agenda.
Hence the other observation: Obama
and other Democrats are politically indebted to the tort bar. According to the Center
for Responsive Politics, the category “Lawyers/Law Firms” appears second behind
“Retired” in a ranking of industry contributors to Obama’s presidential campaign.
Rankings were the same for contributions
to congressional campaigns in the last election cycle. The lawyers favored Democrats
78% to 22% and Obama most of all.

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

Market fundamentals dampen optimism
Hope for economic recovery raised the front-month contract of benchmark US
crudes brieﬂy above $60/bbl for the ﬁrst time this year on the New York Mercantile
Exchange before it fell back to $56.34/bbl in the week ended May 15.
Although the worst may be over, said analysts at the Centre for Global Energy
Studies (CGES), London, “The global economy is likely to scrape along the bottom
for a while.” They reported, “Investors’ appetite for more risk seems to have made a
muted comeback and more cash is ﬂowing into equity markets and the commodities sector, while the current weakness of the US dollar has also played a part…. It is
unlikely that oil will fall to $50/bbl again, but the optimism that has characterized the
oil market since the end of March may well ebb.”
At KBC Market Services, a division of KBC Process Technology Ltd. in Surrey, UK,
analysts said, “However hard commentators try to talk up the economy, we cannot
escape the fact that oil demand is showing no signs of improving.” They noted “the
harbingers of doom at the International Energy Agency” expect a 2.6 million b/d
drop in world oil demand in 2009, which would be “larger even than the 2.5 million
b/d fall seen in 1980.”
For the ninth consecutive month, IEA in Paris reduced its previous forecast of
oil demand, down 230,000 b/d in its latest adjustment to a total 83.2 million b/d,
3% below 2008 demand. “Continued oil demand weakness is premised on strong
economic recovery later this year remaining elusive,” EIA said. Only a day earlier,
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries reduced its 2009 demand growth
forecast by 200,000 b/d to 1.6 million b/d to 84 million bbl.
KBC analysts said, “What is even more disturbing than the IEA’s headline total is
the fact that demand is down almost everywhere, with only India and Saudi Arabia
of the world’s top 10 oil markets showing any growth at all.” They acknowledged “a
small glimmer of hope” when rude inventories fell in the week ended May 8, the
ﬁrst decline in 10 weeks. “But this is straw-clutching,” said KBC analysts. “Four-week
average gasoline demand was down 1.2% on last year, and we might be optimistic in
expecting much of a gasoline season this year.”
‘Sustainable’ prices
CGES analysts said oil prices are “more or less” sustainable around $50-55/bbl
under current conditions. They assume the drop in world demand for oil will be
“much less drastic” than the IEA’s forecast.
Adam Sieminski, chief energy economist, Deutsche Bank, Washington, DC, said,
“Oil analysts should stay focused on the potential for lower equity markets given
the very strong positive correlation recently between oil prices and the Standard
& Poor’s 500 [an index of the 500 largest US companies]. We estimate that since
September every 50-point move in the S&P 500 has been worth a $7/bbl move in the
West Texas Intermediate crude price.”
Meanwhile, Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland, noted “a general consensus” that the recent oil rally “was purely a correlation to the equity markets and
not linked to oil fundamentals.” However, he said, “With industrial demand down
more than driving demand and with the combination of a contango in distillates and
a backwardation in gasoline, distillates is driving gasoline out of storage capacity,
and this is then making the day-of-cover picture in gasoline not very different from
previous years. This then makes gasoline still exposed, like in previous years, to
supply glitches.” Only recently, he said, reports of “a few cracker problems” had “a
direct impact” on gasoline prices.
Meanwhile, Jakob maintained “a Nigerian risk premium” on the price of crude
due to long-term civil unrest in that oil-producing country. “If nothing happens in
Nigeria, we will then transfer it to a Middle East premium,” he said in connection
with Israel Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu’s visit to Washington, DC, beginning
May 18.
Jakob noted “leaks” earlier this month about the Israeli air force training on
refueling missions between Israel and Gibraltar. He reported on May 14 another leak
“that Israel has rented MIG-29 ﬁghter jets (the type owned by Iran) to train its pilots
in ‘dog-ﬁghts’ against them; and it was leaked…that the US Central Intelligence
Agency director was sent to Jerusalem 2 weeks ago to gain reassurances that Israel
would not strike Iran without a green light from Washington.” Jakob said, “All of this
is part of psychological warfare, but we have been there before, and we can’t fully
ignore it.”

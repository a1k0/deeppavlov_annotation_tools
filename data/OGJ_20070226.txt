Without a cost-effective way to remove high levels of nitrogen, you’ve bypassed
would-be opportunities again and again. Now is the time to stop, go back,
tap into those reserves and start making more money.

BCCK Engineering will help you remove nitrogen from your gas streams quickly, efﬁciently and affordably.
And with nitrogen out of the picture, all that gas — and all those proﬁts — are there for the taking.
Thanks to BCCK, it’s time to get both.

For a personal consultation, call BCCK at 888-518-6459,

COVER
The Sasol Advanced Synthol reactor featured on the cover is one
of nine reactors used in the Sasol Fischer-Tropsch process that
converts coal to liquid hydrocarbons at the Sasol plant in Secunda,
South Africa.The facility, resembling a nuclear power plant with
its concrete silos, superheats coal to more than 2,000° F., adds
steam and oxygen to make syngas (H2 and CO), increases the
pressure, and converts the syngas via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to
liquid fuels.The original plant was built to produce transportation
fuels from coal following fuel embargoes during World War II. A
third plant, the 40,000 b/sd Sasol III, was completed in 1983
on the site. Sasol produces 38% of South Africa’s fuel requirements.

Brazil, Bolivia sign natural gas-price agreement
After months of negotiations, Bolivian President Evo Morales and
his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva have signed a protocol agreement that formalizes an increased price for natural gas
that Bolivia exports to Brazil. Brazil agreed to pay $4.20/MMbtu for
Bolivian gas. This is an increase from the previous $1.09/MMbtu
rate. The agreement refers specifically to gas used by a thermoelectric
power plant in Cuiaba, in western Brazil, where 1 million cu m/day
of gas is delivered via a 267-km pipeline in which Royal Dutch Shell
PLC holds a 38% stake (OGJ Online, Jan. 30, 2007).
Carlos Villegas, Bolivia’s hydrocarbons minister, described the
agreements as very encouraging in terms of bilateral relations between the two countries. The agreements point to a mutual commitment to enter a new phase of energy cooperation, he said.
No agreement, however, has been reached concerning Brazil’s
imports of 26 million cu m/day—about half of Brazil’s daily gas
consumption—through the 3,150-km Bolivia-Brazil gas pipeline.
Brazil pays slightly higher than $4/MMbtu on average for this
gas. Bolivia wants Brazil to pay about $5/MMbtu for the gas, after
reaching a similar agreement with Argentina.

Transneft: Russian elections won’t affect projects
Russian pipeline operator OAO Transneft is committed to implementing its oil projects regardless of any change in Russia’s presidency in the forthcoming elections, Transneft Pres. Simon Vainshtock told OGJ at International Petroleum Week in London.
“Russia has prepared all the necessary grounds for there to be a
continuity of energy policy that we currently have. The policy will
be maintained and will remain the same,” Vainshtock said.
One major Transneft project is construction of the 4,000-km
Eastern Siberia-Pacific Ocean pipeline to export Russian crude to
the Asia-Pacific region. Vainshtock said the first phase of the 30
million tonne/year pipeline is on schedule to be commissioned in
2008. “We’ve got guarantees for 100% of the volumes to fill the
first stage of the pipeline,” he said.
Russia, Bulgaria, and Greece recently signed a preliminary
agreement for the 240-km Burgas-Alexandroupolis oil pipeline
proposal to fast-track the establishment of an international company to manage the project. The pipeline, with an initial capacity
of 15 million tonnes/year, will skirt the Black Sea, cross Greece and
Bulgaria and help reduce crude oil shipments by tankers through
the congested Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Vainshtock added that Transneft will support OAO Gazprom’s
position not to ratify the Energy Charter Treaty because they are
both state energy companies. The international agreement aims to
protect foreign energy investments. Russia signed the treaty but
refused to ratify it, saying it does not serve Russian interests, because of objections to the Transit Protocol, a related document that
facilitates the transit of hydrocarbons.
Russia is negotiating with the European Union to reach a resolution on this document before it will progress with ratification.

Excelerate begins operations of Teesside GasPort
Commercial operations have started at Excelerate Energy’s
GasPort in Teesside in northern England, opening the possibility of supplying as much as 600 MMcfd of peak gas directly into
the UK national grid system.
GasPort is the world’s first dockside regasification application—
a land-based manifold that connects to a high-pressure gas arm on
Excelerate’s specially adapted Energy Bridge Regasification Vessel
(EBRV), which can regasify LNG onboard.
“The technology platform on which the Teesside GasPort is
based has long-term implications for the LNG industry,” said Rob
Bryngelson, Excelerate Energy executive vice-president and chief
operating officer. “GasPort operations are further enhanced by the
ability of Energy Bridge vessels to conduct commercial ship-toship transfers with conventional LNG vessels, an ability that aggregates global LNG supplies and markets, shortening travel time and
reducing costs.” RWE Trading will market the gas from GasPort to
UK customers. Both hope to develop additional LNG infrastructure
in other European markets.
OGJ joined senior UK gas industry officials at the inauguration
ceremony Feb. 20 in Teesside where the company stressed it has
delivered the project in under a year and offers a substantial cost effective solution to LNG regasification needs. GasPort cost £40 million whereas traditional land based regasification terminals are at
least £400 million. It was particularly proud of launching GasPort
with its first commercial ship-to-ship transfer of 130,000 cu m
of LNG, and Excelerate hopes to capitalize on meeting short-term
LNG demand (OGJ online, Feb. 16, 2007).
Excelerate will forge key commercial relationships with industry
participants via Excelerate GasNet, a logistical services and trading
platform, to deliver LNG supplies to customers in North America,
Europe, and elsewhere worldwide. ✦

field.
Drilled to 3,000 ft, the stratigraphic test
well intersected the Sagavanirktok formation on the Mt. Elbert prospect, which was
identified by seismic data, well, and reservoir modeling studies.
About 430 ft of 3-in. hydrate cores were
collected. The core segments were initially
subsampled and analyzed on site due to
the time and temperature-dependent data
requirements. They will be shipped to Anchorage for temporary storage before being distributed to gas hydrate researchers
around the country.
Subsequent data collection and analysis will continue for several months, after
which a report will be published, BP said.
The well provided a stratigraphic test of
interpreted gas hydrate accumulations from
Milne seismic and well data. Core, wireline
logs, and wireline downhole testing will
help assess gas hydrate-bearing sediment,
shallow reservoirs, and fluid properties.
The project resulted in the first significant collection of gas hydrate-bearing
cores in Alaska, and the first delineation of
a seismically defined gas hydrate prospect
in Alaska.

Production tests and other future developments of the Milne test well will be determined jointly with DOE, which funded
the estimated $4.6 million drilling cost.

Gulfsands, Emerald spud third
well on Syria’s Block 26
The Khurbet East No. 1 exploration well
on Block 26 in Syria has been spudded using the Crosco 2000 HP Emsco 602 drilling
rig, according to Emerald Energy, a partner
in the block. The well, which is expected
to reach TD of 3,700 m over the next 100
days, is targeting a fault-bound structural
culmination, with closure mapped at several potential reservoir levels, including Cretaceous, Triassic, and Palaeozoic ages.
The Khurbet East prospect is about 12
km southwest of the Souedieh oil field and
12 km south of the Roumelan oil field.
The Block 26 partners, Emerald Energy
and Gulfsands Petroleum (operator), have
exploration rights in all reservoir levels
of Khurbet East. Each company has a 50%
stake in the block.
Gulfsands said that in the event of an oil
or gas discovery at Khurbet East, production would be tied back to existing facilities
about 12 km away near Roumelan field.

FCP to produce from Algeria’s MLE ﬁeld in 2009
First Calgary Petroleums Ltd. (FCP) will produce 200 MMcfd of
gas from MLE oil and gas field in Algeria’s Berkine basin and will
build infrastructure with Sonatrach by late 2009 under a $1.3 billion development plan.
MLE, which has 230 million boe of reserves, will send gas to
a new gas plant, field gathering system, and facilities designed to
process 230 MMcfd of raw gas on a gross basis along with associated natural gas liquids and oil. There are proposals to increase the
plant’s capacity to as much as 400 MMcfd.

MLE’s production plateau of 200 MMcfd is over an initial 10
years, and it will produce 21,000 b/d of oil, condensate, and LPG.
Sonatrach will market the gas.
MLE is on the eastern part of Block 405b. The block will be
developed in stages to exploit oil and gas discoveries west of MLE
field after the companies finish appraisals and determine their
commerciality.
The joint venture will construct dry gas and liquids pipelines
from Block 405b to a tie-in point on the national pipeline grid

Jan. 4, 2006). It will expand MPL’s system, which is at capacity,
to transport crude from oil sands reserves in Alberta and Saskatchewan to Minnesota over the next decade.
The MinnCan project consists of a 304-mile, 24-in. oil pipeline
from Clearbrook, in northwestern Minnesota, to refineries in Minneapolis and St. Paul.
Construction, expected to take 8 months, will begin this summer. The pipeline, which will have a design capacity of 60,000165,000 b/d, should be fully operational in 2008.
The system will originate at the existing interconnection between MPL’s pipeline system and Enbridge Energy’s pipeline system at Clearbrook in Clearwater County. It will pass through 13
counties, with the northernmost 119 miles constructed along existing MPL pipeline right-of-way, except for a 7-mile greenfield
route around Staples, Minn. Near Cushing, in Morrison County, the
route will diverge from the existing pipeline corridor and extend
for 176 miles generally west and south of the Twin Cities metropolitan area.
The project terminates at the Flint Hills Resources refinery at
Rosemount in Dakota County. The terminus will provide a direct
interconnection with the refinery and with the Marathon Petroleum Co. St. Paul Park refinery through existing pipeline facilities.
Two pump stations are planned, one at the Clearbrook station
and another at a midpoint pump station in Morrison County near
Upsala. MPL Co. is owned by Marathon Pipe Line LLC, Flint Hills
Resources, and TROF Inc.

UK approves National Grid to build major line
National Grid, operator of the UK’s gas network, will build a
196-km, 1,220-mm natural gas pipeline from Felindre, near Swansea in west England to Tirley in Gloucestershire, subject to strict UK
environmental conditions. The pipeline is an important component
in delivering gas from two proposed LNG regasification terminals
in Milford Haven, Wales, which are expected to provide 20% of the
UK’s gas needs when completed.
National Grid will start line construction in late February or
early March. Work should be completed in October. Contractors
Nacap Land & Marine Joint Venture will construct a 90-km line section from Felindre to Brecon, and Murphy Pipelines Ltd. will install
the 106-km section from Brecon to Tirley.
Local environmental groups had protested the pipeline route,
particularly the Brecon Beacons National Park Authority (BBNPA),
which objected to a 25.7-km section through the park. Local residents also cited concerns that tourists may be dissuaded from coming because of the pipeline’s impact.
In announcing approval for the line, Energy Minister Lord
Truscott said, “I also have to be mindful of the importance of this
project to our national energy needs. As the UK’s own reserves of
gas decline, there is a need for new infrastructure to connect new
sources of imported gas to our homes and industries.”
The 4.4 million tonne/year Dragon LNG and the 7 million
tonne/year South Hook LNG terminals are under construction in
Milford Haven. Dragon is expected to start operations by yearend
and South Hook by first quarter 2008.
A BBNPA spokeswoman told OGJ it was disappointed by the UK
Department for Trade and Industry’s decision to permit National
10

Grid to forge ahead with the pipeline. Now 33.7 km of the pipeline
will go through the park. She said BBNPA will appoint two officers
to monitor construction and ensure that minimum environmental
damage occurs. Under special circumstances, these officers could
stop work if they find breaches of environmental regulations.

Equatorial Guinea LNG seeks Zaﬁro gas as feed
Equatorial Guinea LNG (EG LNG) is looking to use gas from
Zafiro oil field, operated by ExxonMobil Corp., as possible feed gas
for its liquefaction plant, said Steve Ollerearnshaw, EG LNG managing director, at the International Petroleum Week conference in
London Feb. 16.
Currently 150 MMcfd of gas from Zafiro field is flared. EG LNG
is in discussions with ExxonMobil to see whether it would be feasible to bring gas for its proposed second LNG train, Ollerearnshaw
said. “It would need a pipeline and compression to make it work,”
he added. Zafiro, which produces more than 270,000 b/d, is the
biggest oil field in Equatorial Guinea.
EG LNG has contracted Bechtel Corp. to investigate the feasibility of adding a second 4.4 million tonne/year train. The work is
scheduled for completion by the end of the first quarter, and EG
LNG shareholders are expected to make a final investment decision
by late 2007 or early 2008.
Ollerearnshaw said discussions are under way among Nigeria,
Cameroon, and Equatorial Guinea to explore providing gas to EG
LNG.
“We believe there is a very sound economic basis for Train 2 at
EG LNG,” he added, “and we see a long-term potential for up to 20
million tonnes in Equatorial Guinea.”
EG LNG will join the club of Atlantic Basin LNG suppliers later,
with first LNG production from its initial 3.4 million tonnes/year
train due in the summer. Gas for the plant will come from Alba
field. BG Group is expected to deliver the volumes to the Lake
Charles, La., regasification terminal in the US, but Ollerearnshaw
said that BG Group has destination flexibility in its contract.
EG LNG is situated on Bioko Island in Equatorial Guinea (OGJ,

Chevron’s Casotte LNG terminal gets FERC OK
Chevron Corp. has received approval from the US Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission to build the Casotte Landing regasification
facility next to the company’s 325,000 b/cd Pascagoula refinery in
Jackson County, Miss.
The proposed project would process LNG for distribution to
Mississippi, Florida, and the US Northeast. The facility would have
a nominal processing capacity of 1.3 bcfd of gas.
Chevron also has reserved 1 bcfd of regasification capacity at
Cheniere’s Sabine Pass LNG receiving terminal in southwestern
Louisiana. Construction at this facility is about 55% complete and
the terminal is scheduled to start operations in second quarter
2008. Chevron’s commitment begins mid-2009.
Both the Sabine Pass capacity and the Casotte Landing facility
can be integrated into Chevron’s US Gulf Coast pipeline, storage,
and terminal infrastructure. ✦

Russian gas
I’d like to point out two small inaccuracies in a very good survey by David
Wood in “Part 1: Russia seeks global
influence by exploiting energy geopolitics” (OGJ, Feb. 12, 2007, p. 20). First,
in the dark days of 1998 the European
price of Russian gas was less than one
quarter of what it is today. Second, according to financial reports of Gazprom,
gas sales to Russian consumers were
profitable in 2004 and 2005. Moreover,
domestic sales have a higher profit rate
than the one of Gazprom Marketing &
Trading Ltd. of the UK.

exposure to oil has grown, especially
from the activity of investment banks,
pension funds, and index and hedge
funds. With more money being invested
by more types of investors, futures markets gained influence over the price of
crude. Paper markets became not just a
hedge device but “both investment and
hedge tools.”
In this new structure, the financial
market “expresses its opinion of the
future course of prices through position
changes and higher volumes of futures

expectations and uncertainty about the
future are “discounted into prompt
prices more quickly and more forcefully than in the past.” It adds, “There
is more transparency, but there is also
more volatility.”
While these changes were in progress, global capacities to produce and
refine crude oil were shrinking.
“This development reduced the
cushion of supply security and the risk
cover on sharp upside price movements, luring both paper hedge and
speculative demand into the oil market,” the study says.

Physical factors
Some observers blame this movement largely for the increases in oil
prices since 2002. The OPEC study
notes—and voices agreement with—the

Its conclusions: physical factors rather
than speculation are the main reasons for
price increases since 2002. But speculation “has magnified price oscillations”
and contributed to volatility.

Accommodating prosperity
A global-warming response that accommodates
prosperity should have more appeal than one
that promises stagnation. So why doesn’t the Asia
Pacific Partnership on Development and Climate
receive more attention?
Signed in 2005 by India, China, South Korea, Japan, Australia, and the US, the partnership
emphasizes markets and technology in pursuit of
economic growth and environmental improvement for developing countries. Because it relies
on voluntary action and innovation instead of
mandates, backers of the rival Kyoto Protocol have
dismissed it as unsubstantial. Yet their own approach is foundering as one ratifying country after

by the authors of 91 countries shows a strong
relationship between economic freedom and the
improvement in energy intensity that accompanies
growth.
Montgomery and Tuladhar see opportunity in
the high-emissions energy technology of developing countries. While China’s emissions intensity is
improving, its installed capital equipment produces greenhouse gases at about four times the
rate of US equipment. India’s emissions intensity
isn’t improving, and its new investments involve
technology with twice the emissions intensity of

As crude oil prices rose above $50/

of Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) technology to
produce transportation fuels from coal.
Developed during World War II, the
F-T process in recent years has moved
into commercial-scale use in gas-to-liquids projects around the world.

gasification instead makes hydrogen
sulfide and ammonia, which can easily
be removed in gas scrubbers. Carbon
dioxide, considered a greenhouse gas,
can also be captured and sequestered,
and can even provide a significant income stream if oil fields are nearby and
responsive to CO2 flooding.
This study examines coal conversion to liquid hydrocarbons and electric
power generation, using IGCC as the
basis for gasification. The syngas is converted to liquid hydrocarbons using F-T
technology. There are several scenarios
where this commercially proven technology offers attractive economics.
Two significantly different coals
were investigated for conversion to
liquid hydrocarbons and electric power
generation using “green” technology.
Furthermore, an “ultragreen” case was
developed in which the CO2 emissions
are practically eliminated by shifting all

synthesis gas feed goes

lined the need for the US to develop
more domestic resources. Fig. 2 summarizes how US crude oil consumption
and production have trended during
1993-2003.
One continuing trend observed is
that US crude consumption continues
to increase while domestic production
decreases.

Current initiatives
Currently the US Department of
Energy is focusing its alternative
transportation fuel efforts mainly on
hydrogen and biomass as measured
by the amount of funding allocated in
these areas.
All hydrogen generated today is
produced from a hydrocarbon source,
generally natural gas. It could be made
22

electrolytically, and if hydroelectric or
nuclear power were used, it could be
classified a green fuel. However, baring the development of surplus cheap
nuclear power, an economically viable
source of hydrogen is unlikely in the
near future. In addition, the infrastructure to distribute hydrogen to fueling locations does not exist. Onboard
vehicle storage capabilities would limit
the range of any vehicle powered by
hydrogen, although some attempts to
concentrate it via metal hydrides have
met with limited success. Hydrogen as a
transportation fuel faces many challenges before it can significantly contribute
to the transportation fuel mix.
The most significant biomass fuel in
the marketplace today is ethanol produced from corn. US production is 4

billion gal/year. The debate over whether a gallon of ethanol requires more
energy to produce than it contains has
continued over the last 2 decades.
MIT chemistry professor John
Deutch, a former director of energy
research, undersecretary of energy in
the Jimmy Carter administration, and
former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, recently commented in
the Wall Street Journal on the “biomass
movement:” “Cultivation of corn is
highly energy-intensive, and a significant amount of oil and natural gas
is used in growing, fertilizing, and
harvesting it. Moreover, there is a substantial energy requirement—much of
it supplied by diesel or natural gas—for
the fermentation and distillation process
that converts corn to ethanol. These
petroleum inputs must be subtracted
when calculating the net amount of oil
that is reduced by the use of ethanol in
gasoline.
Others estimate that ethanol contains plus or minus 25% of the energy required for manufacture. But
the energy issue is largely academic,
as the economics of ethanol production depend on a government subsidy
to make it a viable fuel. The current
subsidy is $0.51/gal. The other source
of biomass is cellulosic material such
as the much-touted switch grass and
agricultural by-products like corn stover
and straw. However, cellulose must first
be converted into sugar and then into
ethanol with advanced enzyme technology. Genencor and Novozymes have
made some headway. This technology,
however, is still in the research and
development stage.

Greenhouse emissions
Another important issue faced today
is that of greenhouse emissions worldwide, notably CO2. Coal historically has

Military testing Fischer-Tropsch fuels
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
The US Department of Defense is
examining the possible role of FischerTropsch fuels for military vehicles,
starting with its aircraft.
The Defense Energy Support Center
of Fort Belvoir, Va., which oversees fuel
purchases for DOD, has asked companies to submit proposals regarding the
availability of possible synthetic fuel
suppliers for anticipated ﬁeld tests by
the Air Force and Navy.
Last year, the Air Force successfully tested a synthetic fuel in a B-52
bomber. The test ﬂights involved a
50-50 blend of traditional jet fuel and a
synthetic liquid made from natural gas
using the Fischer-Tropsch process.
William E. Harrison III, the chief of

for 60% of US sulfur dioxide emissions,
33% of US mercury emissions, 25%
of nitrogen oxide emissions, and more
than 33% of the nation’s CO2 emissions.”3
However, it doesn’t have to be that
way because IGCC, shown in Fig. 3 for
electric power generation, makes coal
a very clean fuel with the side benefit
of increasing the thermal efficiency
from about 33% for conventional coal
firing to more than 40% for IGCC. DOE
is taking the lead in commercializing
IGCC in its Future Gen Project slated for
either Illinois or Texas, with two candidate plant sites in each state.
In a typical IGCC plant, coal is first
gasified to synthesis gas, hydrogen, and
carbon monoxide. The synthesis gas is
scrubbed to remove acid gases and mercury. The synthesis gas is then burned
in two sets of turbine drivers, first a
combustion turbine and then a steam
turbine to produce electricity. If the
synthesis gas is passed through a water
gas shift converter, the CO converts to
CO2. The CO2 can also be scrubbed,

fuels branch propulsion directorate for
the Air Force Research Laboratory, said
DOD wants to obtain for the military
clean fuels that are produced from
secure domestic resources.
“It’s a 40-year-old airplane with very
dirty engines,” Harrison said of the B52, adding that the aircraft was chosen
to test new technology fuel because its
engine enables convenient comparison
of engine performance using different
fuels.
The Air Force seeks to replace its
commercial airlines Jet-A fuel and
its kerosene-based JP-8, which is the
equivalent of the Navy’s F-76. Both the
military and airlines are considering
whether alternative fuels could help
reduce costs in times of high oil prices.
Speaking in The Woodlands, Tex., last

providing a hydrogen-rich steam to the
turbines. This scenario is called “ultragreen” because there would be very
little CO2 emitted from the power plant.
CO2 cannot currently be eliminated
entirely, as some carbon must be left in
the feed to the power plant for flame
stability.
The increased cost of IGCC over
conventional coal firing is 20-25%.4
However, when including the benefits
of less air pollution and the ability to
conveniently capture carbon dioxide
emissions, the price difference is not
so obvious. Furthermore, if the federal government enacts CO2 emission
controls, they could make conventional
coal-fired technology no longer the
economic choice. The primary environmental benefit of IGCC is increased
energy efficiency and the potential
for significantly reduced air pollution.
IGCC can be used as a springboard for
making liquid hydrocarbons from coal
by integrating F-T synthesis with the
electric power generation plant.

year at a conference on carbon dioxide,
Harrison said Fischer-Tropsch fuel produces lower emissions compared with
traditional fossil-based fuel. Test results
indicated the synthetic fuel produced
1.6% fewer CO2 emissions, 50-90% less
particulate matter, and no sulfur.
“CO2 has got to be part of the strategy,” he said. “America’s unconventional
fuel resources can help bridge the gap
to future fuels.”

Secure supply
Military preparedness requires secure fuel sources, Harrison said, adding
that the military is looking to reduce its
dependence on imported crude oil. The
Fischer-Tropsch process can use coal,
natural gas, or biological matter—all
abundant in the US—to make an intermediate synthesis gas (syngas) that is
reﬁned into fuel.

The run-up in crude prices over
the last year to $50-80/bbl has stimulated renewed interest in F-T synthesis.
Furthermore, technological improvements in F-T synthesis, such as slurry
phase reactors plus tougher environmental standards are pointing to F-T as
a promising way to help abundant coal

B-52 test ﬂights. The Air Force eventually wants a synthetic liquid produced
from coal.
The Air Force spends more than $10
million/day on fuel, Harrison said, adding that every $10/bbl increase in oil
prices means an additional $600 million/year to the Air Force’s fuel bill.
“Fischer-Tropsch is not just for the
airplane...Fischer-Tropsch is a very ﬁne
rocket fuel,” he said. “The Air Force and
the Department of Defense are serious
about alternative fuels.”
DOD has looked at the experience
of the South African military because
Sasol Ltd. has produced synthetic fuel
from coal for at least a decade, he
noted.
“Actually if you ﬂy in and out of
Johannesburg on a commercial airline,
you are going to get some fuel that has
Fischer-Tropsch [produced fuel] in it,”
Harrison said.
The US Air Force has 150 different

variations of aircraft along with ground
support equipment and vehicles, he
said. Testing of engines other than the
B-52 is planned.
DOD is collaborating with engine
manufacturers and is soliciting comment from energy companies about
supplying alternative fuels, Harrison
said. DOD’s goal is to have a single
kind of fuel, although it wants to have
as many suppliers as possible.
“We want to see diversity of technology,” Harrison said. “We don’t tell the
reﬁners how to reﬁne it. We tell them
the standards. That’s the path we are
going down. We like to see diversity.”

Biofuel
The military also is looking into using vegetable oil from a variety of agricultural feedstocks for making aviation
fuel via the Fischer-Tropsch process.

In addition to removing other pollutants from power generation, IGCC

Thus, IGCC technology, combined

the Energy & Environmental Research
Center at the University of North
Dakota in Grand Forks for the development and demonstration of a renewable domestic jet fuel.
The 18-month project was announced in December 2006. The fuel
produced by the EERC would be a
candidate with which to replace the
traditional JP-8 fuel.
EERC spokesmen said the center will
expand its capabilities in tactical fuels
and demonstrate how fuels made from
crop oil could replace imported oil.
“Our whole approach with this
project is to develop an affordable new
fuel that can be dropped in to replace
the current JP-8 fuel,” said Ted Aulich,
EERC senior research manager. “This
replacement will allow an easy transition from a petroleum-based fuel to a
100% domestic renewable fuel.”

ties. CO2 captured from the Great Plains
plant in North Dakota, is used in this
manner. “Regional” is defined as a
radius of 400-500 miles of the plant.
CO2 currently is piped from southwest
Colorado (Cortez) into the Texas panhandle—a distance of 450 miles. Thus,
the CO2 situation today differs considerably from that during the energy crisis
of the 1970s and 1980s, when CO2
was simply emitted to the atmosphere.
Today CO2 can be a viable product in its
own right. Tomorrow, it may be classified as a pollutant, making its capture
mandatory.
The sale of CO2 in combination with
power generation and the production of
liquid transportation fuels from coal is
the primary focus of this paper.

as much sulfur.
Case 6. This is the ultragreen mode
for converting Illinois 6 coal to electricity and liquid fuels. Its commercial
advantages are that it is close to major
liquid fuel markets, and it allows highsulfur Eastern coal to be used, as all
sulfur is captured.
There are four major environmental
advantages:
• It has extremely low CO2 emissions.
• All sulfur and nitrogen from the
coal are captured.
• A small amount of NOx is emitted
from the combustion turbine.
• Mercury in coal is captured.
The process flow sheet for this case
is identical to the ultragreen case using
Montana coal in Case 4 (Fig. 8). Recalling that almost all of the CO in the
syngas is shifted to hydrogen, this process requires a larger CO shift converter,
which results in $37 million more in
capital investment for the bigger shift
converter.
The amount of CO2 produced from
lower-moisture Illinois 6 coal is smaller
due to the higher efficiency of the gasification step. Less water in the gasifier
results in higher cold gas efficiency, and
less CO2 produced. CO2 production for
this case is 297 MMscfd compared with
387 MMscfd for the Montana ultragreen
case. ROI is 12%, or 3% higher than
Case 5 using standard syngas in the
combustion turbine.
Even though an additional $37
million is required for the larger shift
converter, a higher ROI justifies the additional cost to operate in the ultragreen
mode if the CO2 can be sold for EOR.

Future challenges
If crude oil prices drop back to the
$40-50/bbl level, then indirect liquefaction of coal will no longer be economically attractive, particularly with
the operating risks associated with this
technology and the huge capital investment required.
Providing assurances and incentives
for private industry to build and oper30

ate one of these coal plants is critical
to moving ahead. The technology is essentially proven by the plants operating
in South Africa by Sasol but the risk of
investing large amounts of money and
then having the product values drop is a
nagging worry.
The price of crude has fluctuated
since its discovery in the 19th Century,
and it is reasonable to assume these
fluctuations will continue. Thus if a
plant is built, its economic outlook will
vary with the price of crude.
This has been the experience of the
Great Plains coal-to-synthetic natural
gas plant in Beulah, ND, which was
built in the oil crisis of the 1970s and
1980s.
After the plant was built, the price of
natural gas fell. Large quantities of gas
became available, and no other coal-tomethane gasification plants have been
built in the US.8

The potential of coal is a resource
base that can reduce such countries’
dependence on foreign oil. The US, in
particular, has sufficient coal reserves to
reduce oil imports, which are becoming a political liability. Converting coal
to liquids via gasification followed by
F-T (indirect liquefaction) is advisable
for the following reasons:
• The technology is commercially
demonstrated; there are several commercial plants in operation around the
world today.
• The potential for an environmentally green process is exceptional.
• Integration with other technologies such as IGCC and EOR is significant.
• The CO2 produced is a potentially
important revenue stream in any coal
gasification plant. Its value depends on

It does no good for the industry to
be “constantly on the defensive with
the public and at war with policymakers,” Hofmeister said. As for the issue of
global warming, he said, “The public
says it’s an issue, policymakers say it’s
an issue. So the industry cannot ignore
it.”
In a keynote luncheon address, José
Sérgio Gabrielli de Azevedo, president
and chief executive officer of Brazil’s
state-owned Petroleo Brasileiro SA
(Petrobras), said his country is a
leader in the production of crude from
deepwater reservoirs and of ethanol
from sugar cane. The last oil boom of
the 1970s threatened Brazil’s economy
with high oil prices and stimulated oil
exploration by Petrobras, primarily in
the deep waters off Brazil and in the
US sector of the Gulf of Mexico. Brazil
expects to increase its oil production to
3.5 million b/d by 2010 and 4.5 million b/d by 2015 from a current level
of 2.4 million b/d.
With the world’s largest water supply via its Amazon River basin and half
of the world’s sugar cane production,
Brazil is the largest producer of ethanol.
What’s more, 20% of the new automobiles produced in Brazil have “flex-fuel”
capabilities. Ethanol supplies 40% of

CERA: Russian ofﬁcial says gas cartel not imminent
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
Russia’s deputy minister of industry
told the Cambridge Energy Research
Associates convention in Houston that
formation of an international gas cartel
is not imminent.
Andrei Reus, speaking through an
interpreter, said no one has deﬁned the
format or organization for a gas cartel.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir
Putin and Qatari Emir Shaikh Hamad
bin Khalifa Al Thani had said they
would explore the idea of setting up a
gas cartel similar to the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
“Not a single action we’ve undertaken, not a single association we
become part of, is aimed against
anybody,” Reus said Feb. 14. “We aren’t
working against anything speciﬁcally.
Everything we do is aimed at greater
efﬁciency, greater predictability.”
His comments came about a month
after Russia resumed delivering crude
to Europe via Belarus on Jan. 11, ending a 3-day suspension of supplies
along the Friendship pipeline that affected Germany, Poland, Slovakia, and
Hungary.
The disruption followed Russia’s
decision to impose a duty of $180/
tonne on oil exports to Belarus, which
responded by slapping its own $45/
tonne transit tax on Russian oil. The
disruption came a year after a Russian
dispute with Ukraine that disrupted

However, Tillerson said oil industry’s
fuel expertise and technology may have
more to contribute during “the second
or third levels” of development of biofuels, such as cellulosic ethanol made
from nonfood portions of plants.
An earlier joint study by US Departments of Agriculture and Energy
concluded the nation has enough
biomass resources to satisfy a third of
32

Europe’s gas supply brieﬂy (OGJ Online, Jan. 11, 2007).

CERA Senior Director Simon Blakey
said natural gas “appears to be a pawn
in a wider strategic and political game”
in which Europe seeks a balanced energy security policy.
“Although European countries and
Russia have more than 40 years of

practice in aligning relationships with
industrial reality, the increased scale of
natural gas supply needs have rearranged the pieces on the board and
introduced new points of leverage into
the game,” Blakey said, noting that
Europe has many voices about gas
relations with Russia.
He said Russia’s response can seem
confusing in part because Russia is
responding to “a mélange of mixed
signals.” Blakey said CERA considers
any talk of a gas cartel to be simply
a distraction. “It is not an imminent
political or market reality,” Blakey said.
“The short-term markets in international gas trade are not so well developed”
for quarterly meetings of natural gas
ministers, he said, referring to OPEC
meetings of oil ministers.
Meanwhile, European Union leaders
closely are following Russia’s policy
on natural gas because more than 40%
of Europe’s imported gas comes from
Russia.
“There are European countries
who have strong traditional bilateral
relations with their Russian supplier,
where essentially industrial alliances
cement political relations and guarantee gas—particularly Germany, Italy,
and France,” Blakey said, calling those
countries “the old Europe.”
They contrast with the “new Europe”
in which the Baltics and central European countries are conﬁrming their
identities and positions within the EU,
he said. “In some cases, there is a level
of residual discomfort with Russia.”

US petroleum needs if cellulosic technologies and resources are employed.
A separate study by petroleum industry
analysts at Simmons & Co. International
Inc., Houston, concluded that cellulosic
ethanol has the best growth potential
for the biofuel market although US production currently is uneconomic.
Meanwhile, Tillerson said, “Driven
by growing prosperity in the develop-

ing world, global energy demand is
projected to be close to 40% higher
in the year 2030 than it was last year,
reaching close to 325 million b/d on
an oil equivalent basis.”
The International Energy Agency
in Paris has estimated a total investment of more than $8 trillion in the oil
and gas sectors will be necessary over
that period. “A large portion of these

US energy policy
US Sec. of Energy Samuel W. Bodman told reporters at CERA that he will
discourage any talk about a gas cartel,
saying open markets are vital to meeting future world energy demand.
“All countries can act as they see ﬁt,
but I think it’s fair to say that efforts to
manipulate markets by trying to organize the suppliers over the long term
will not beneﬁt the suppliers,” Bodman
told reporters. “I will make my views
known.” In a speech to CERA, Bodman
said moves by governments to restrict
foreign investment and increase the
reach of state-run energy industries
limit access to capital and expertise
(see story, p. 35).
He called for stable regulatory
frameworks, open investment climates,
adherence to laws, and market-based
pricing of oil and gas.
“History has shown that an unfettered market is the most effective and
efﬁcient way to determine price and
allocate resources based on supply and
demand,” Bodman said.

V

enezuela’s grandiose President
Hugo Chavez plans to support
London’s transport system with
subsidized oil, and he’s doing it on
the invitation of the city’s embattled
mayor, Ken Livingstone.
Venezuela last week signed an
agreement to subsidize the fuel bill
for London’s buses by up to $32 million/year, a 20% discount that Livingstone said would fund half-price
rates on city transport for Londoners
who receive income support.
The scheme will see state-owned

sole agenda,” said Lawson, “is to
support the policies that will get him
reelected, rational or not.”
The London mayor is responsible
for the most controversial system yet
devised for curbing the capital’s traffic nightmare: an £8 ($15) charge on
cars entering Central London.
The so-called “congestion charge”
has proven highly unpopular
with the local citizenry–especially
residents and other people whose
businesses depend on shoppers and
deliveries from outside.

investments will be required to develop
new supplies to simply replace ongoing
declines in existing volumes. The rest
will be needed for additional supplies
to meet the increase in demand,” Tillerson said.
“The ability to meet energy demand
today and for the future lies in policies
that allow companies to search for, develop, and produce available resources
wherever they may be, and to encourage further industry innovation to do so
in the most efficient and effective manner,” he said. Moreover, Tillerson said,
“The path to energy security does not
lie in attempting to insulate domestic
economies from the influences of the
global marketplace. Instead it lies in
open international trade, competitive
markets, diversity of supply, and the
strengthening of partnerships between
producing and consuming nations. To
achieve energy security is to achieve
collective security among diverse economies and cultures on a global scale.”

Emissions control
Reducing greenhouse emissions
from fossil fuels that will furnish the
bulk of the world’s energy for decades
to come “is every bit as important” as
the development of alternative fuels, Tillerson said. “Steps taken at ExxonMobil,
for example, since 1999 to improve energy efficiency at our facilities, resulted
in carbon dioxide emissions savings
of 11 million tonnes in 2005. That’s
equivalent to taking 2 million cars off
the road,” he said.
He noted that ExxonMobil and other
firms collectively contributed $225 million to Stanford University for scientific
research into technology breakthroughs
to reduce fuel emissions even lower.
“We know our climate is changing,
the average temperature of the earth
is rising, and greenhouse gas emissions are increasing. We also know that
climate remains an extraordinarily
complex area of study. While our understanding of the science continues
to evolve and improve, there is still
much that we do not know and cannot

Tillerson said.
Therefore, he said, “It is prudent to
develop and implement sensible strategies that address these risks while not
reducing our ability to progress other
global priorities such as economic
development, poverty eradication, and
public health.”

Tillerson said, “Specific policy tools
should be assessed for their likely effectiveness, scale, and costs, as well as their
implications for economic growth and
quality of life. In that regard, rigorous
and informed debate—debate that takes
into account the essential role played
by energy in advancing social and
economic progress—will best support

Just as technology has driven the
successful progress of the oil and gas

that future technology advances will

performances, increased maintenance of
infrastructure, lower gas demand, and
delays in start ups of several projects in
2006-07, UKOOA said. Many of these
projects also suffered from bad weather
in the UK North Sea.
Production should increase, however
to 3-3.1 million boe/d in 2007 because
of 30 new project start ups and ongoing investment, according to UKOOA’s
forecast. There is still a “solid portfolio
of activity, provided investments are
commercially attractive and resources
not a constraint,” UKOOA said. About
22 developments are scheduled to start
up production in 2008-09.
Major UK North Sea projects that
started production at the beginning of
this year include Buzzard, led by Nexen
Inc., and Dumbarton oil field, operated
by Maersk Oil UK.
The central and southern North Sea
saw the most exploration and appraisal
activities in 2006. The success rate in
finding commercial discoveries was
36% with the average size of a discovery
being 15 million boe. Last year about

500 million boe was found. “However,
96% of future exploration prospects
are expected to be less than 50 million boe and 88% less than 20 million
boe in size on a risked basis,” UKOOA
said. Exploration drilling is expected to
dominate 2007 whereas last year the
focus was on appraisal activities.
UK North Sea operators are worried about low UK gas prices, which
have fallen last year because of low gas
demand due to mild weather and large
supplies from major gas import pipelines such as the southern leg of the
Langeled pipeline.
“We’re working on a study looking
at how gas prices are affecting investment in the North Sea,” Mike Tholen,
commercial director at UKOOA told
OGJ. “When it comes to oil prices some
operators are feeling uncomfortable at
the idea of oil prices hitting $40/bbl
although 3 years ago people felt that
$25/bbl was uncomfortable.” Oil prices
are hovering at $58/bbl and operating costs for North Sea operators are at
$10/bbl.

The UKCS is a mature province that
is believed to hold at least 16-25 billion
boe of recoverable reserves, but operators are finding that their costs to work
there are growing because of inflation,
high rig rates, and a scarcity of skilled
personnel.
UKOOA is calling for a change in
the tax, regulatory, and fiscal regime to
attract investors to stay in the UK North
Sea and has stressed that the uncertainty over decommissioning rules are
discouraging deals. Malcolm Webb,
UKOOA chief executive, said it was
in discussions with the Treasury and
industry to look for solutions.
Webb added that UKOOA would not
push for a separate tax regime to govern
the southern North Sea which has
lower production than other parts and
yet very high production costs.
“Without continuing and sustained
interest, 45% of pipelines and infrastructure could close by 2020 rendering
further recovery of oil and gas uneconomic in areas of the UKCS,” UKOOA
warned. ✦

a formal offer with Canadian securities
regulators.
Shell Canada’s board described the
revised bid as “fair” and recommended
that shareholders accept it. The deadline
for Shell’s offer expires Mar. 16 unless it
is withdrawn or extended.

Petroplus reﬁnery deal
Petroplus’s deal price also includes
hydrocarbons valued at closing, BP’s
adjacent bulk terminal, and its UK bitumen business, which is closely integrated with the refinery in Essex. After the
deal closes Petroplus will have 289,000
b/d of refining capacity in the UK, as it
already owns the 117,000 b/d refinery
at Teeside.
Petroplus will grow its processing
capacity by 55% once it starts operating Coryton and transform it into a
trans-European refiner with refineries
in Switzerland, Belgium, and Germany
after closing a deal with ExxonMobil
Corp. later this year.
Petroplus also will provide BP’s UKbased retail and other businesses with
fuel products under a long-term supply
agreement. BP will continue to operate
its own UK logistics and supply infrastructure, however.
Coryton can process as much as
70,000 b/d of other feedstocks and is

Apache-Anadarko deal
Apache’s agreement with Anadarko
allows the companies to create a joint
venture to effect the transaction.
The Permian basin fields are expected to produce 9,000 b/d of oil and
19 MMcfd of gas this year from 3,950
wells on 143,000 net acres.
Anadarko operates nearly 90% of
the properties. Oil makes up more
than 70% of the production, produced
primarily through waterflood recovery
operations.
This deal is the latest in a slew of
Anadarko asset divestments following the company’s separate purchases
of Kerr-McGee Corp. and Western Gas
Resources Inc. last year. Anadarko as of
yearend 2005 had 2.4 billion boe of
proved reserves.

The Midcontinent assets contain
76% of the total proved reserves in the
transaction. The reserves are in multiple formations, including the Big 4,
Bromide, Springer, Morrow, Chester,
Tonkawa, Redfork, and Granite Wash in
the Midcontinent, and the Frio, Vicksburg, Miocene, Yegua, and Wilcox in
South Texas.
About 91% of the estimated value of
the Midcontinent reserves are operated,
while 85% of the estimated value of
the reserves in South Texas are operated.
Net acreage included in the acquisition
totals 290,000 acres, more than 71% of

An exploration and production contract inked Feb. 5 by Petroleo Brasileiro
SA (Petrobras) with Senegal for the
exploration of two blocks means that
the Brazilian state-owned firm now operates in five African countries: Angola,
Libya, Tanzania, Equatorial Guinea, and
Nigeria.
Petrobras in early 2006 signed agreements in Angola to explore blocks 15
and 18 in the
Congo basin,
Block 6 in the
Kwanza basin, and
Block 26 in the
Benguela basin.
Petrobras operates
all of the blocks
except Block 6.
The Brazilian company also holds
interests in oil-producing Block 2 and
exploration Block 34.
As operator of deepwater Block 18,
it has a 30% interest in the unexplored
part of a high-potential area. The other
sector of that block contains the BP
PLC-operated Plutonio project, a collection of several discoveries with 750
million bbl of reserves.
The Petrobras group’s signing bonus
was $1.1 billion. Participants are Sinopec 40%, Sonangol 20%, and Falcon Oil
and the Gema Group 5% each.
Petrobras’s strategy contrasts with
that of the state oil companies of Venezuela and Mexico, which are involved
in E&P activities only in their home
countries.

capacity.

Tanzania block
The Brazilian company has been
in Tanzania since June 2004, when it
signed an agreement with state Tanzania
Petroleum Development Corp.
The agreement covers Block 5, a
9,250 sq km area in 300-3,000 m of
water in the Mafia basin.
Petrobras took part in and won the
first round of bids opened by the Tanzanian government, in 2001, and now has
100% interest in the concession.
The contract term was for 4 years
of activity, including seismic surveys,
geological studies, and basin assessment, and may extend for two periods
of exploration that total 7 years.
Petrobras won 100% interest in
Block 6 in the third bidding round in
May 2005. The production sharing contract for this block is being negotiated.

Equatorial Guinea

Petrobras acquired a 50% interest in

Nicaragua gets possibly commercial gas ﬁnd
Norwood Resources Ltd., Vancouver,
BC, discovered gas-condensate and light
oil in eight zones in what could be
Nicaragua’s first potentially commercial
discovery.
The San Bartolo Rodriguez Cano-1
wildcat in the Sandino basin near the
Pacific Coast southwest of Managua
discovered hydrocarbons below 6,000
ft in various turbidite sands of the
Paleocene Brito formation, the company
said. Measured total depth is 8,790 ft
with 11.5° deviation at TD.
“The company has logged the well
and independent petrophysical analysis
combined with core (percussion and
rotary) analysis has assigned a combined 532 ft of pay, including 232 ft
of conventional pay and another 300 ft
of naturally fractured low permeability
sands in eight separate zones,” Norwood said. “Results from core analysis
indicate porosities in the 17% to 21%
range with permeability from 3 to 30
md. These porosity measurements agree

favorably with the log measurements.”
Norwood cemented 7-in. casing
at 8,764 ft and plans to stimulate and
test San Bartolo-1 in the next several
weeks. Drilling took 47 days at this, the
country’s first exploration well in more
than 35 years. The rig is moving 11 km
to drill the Las Mesas structure, where
amplitude and velocity seismic sections
indicate similar but shallower Brito
sands. Both wells are on the 845,780acre Oklanicsa Concession.
The discovery well is 75 miles north
of the border with Costa Rica and 75
miles south of the border with Honduras, which just disclosed plans to
promote its oil and gas potential (OGJ
Online, Feb. 8, 2007). The discovery is
300 miles south-southeast of nearest oil
production in Guatemala and more than
twice that distance from production in
Colombia.
Norwood operates the concession
with 70% interest, and Industria Oklahoma-Nicaragua SA has the rest. ✦

Nebraska Forest City
prospect awaits bit
A small independent is pursuing the
drilling of an oil prospect that could
hold several million barrels of oil in the
Forest City basin in southeasternmost
Nebraska.
The basin, which extends into Kansas, Missouri, and Iowa, has produced
several hundred million barrels of oil,
but its recent history reveals little drilling.
The principals of Humboldt Oil,
former neighbors who now live in
Boston and Denver, propose to drill the
prospect in 13 and 14-2n-13e, near the
Richardson County town of Humboldt.
It is 20 miles northwest of Falls City
field, largest oil producing area on the
Nebraska side of the basin.
The prospect and Snethen field, Dawson field, Honey Creek field, and Livengood field in Kansas line up at about
a 30° angle to the easternmost fault in
the Humboldt Fault Zone.
The Humboldt fault, which extends
roughly from Omaha to Oklahoma City,
is the basin’s western boundary. It is a
vertical fault with the basin to the east.
A 1970s seismic survey by the Nebraska Geological Survey revealed that
in southeastern Nebraska it is not just
one fault but rather a fault zone. The
easternmost fault seemed to have slight
right-lateral movement, while the main
fault to the west had slight left-lateral
movement. A map of the basin’s oil
fields reveals the slight left-lateral movement.

Richardson County
The easternmost fault is most interesting near the town of Humboldt, said
Kent Van Zant, president of Humboldt
Oil. Four or five oil fields lie in line
from Humboldt to Sabetha, Kan., at a
30° angle with the easternmost fault.
The fields have produced a combined 3
million bbl of oil.

Cooper-1 well, in 10-2n-13e near the
fault, was incorrectly mapped. The data
show a large structure aligned with the
oil fields along the 30° angle with the
easternmost fault. Humboldt Oil has
named this structure the Humboldt
Prospect.

Richardson County has produced
more than 12 million bbl of oil from
the Ordovician Viola and Hunton formations.
The Humboldt Prospect is 2 miles
from the fault, just as is McClain field
30 miles away in Nemaha County, Kan.
Estimated ultimate recovery at McClain,

discovered in 1982 by Pendleton Land
& Exploration Co., is 3 to 5 million bbl
of oil. The Humboldt Prospect appears
to be a McClain analog, Van Zant said.

tectonic events, an integrated fracture
study was initiated in order to forecast
fracture flow potential with regard
to the low permeability and porosity
characterizing these units. The study
was based mainly on openhole logs
and borehole imaging. Additional
data integrated core observation and
regional structural and stress distribution.
First, based on the intensity and
distribution of fractures, the field was
expected to have higher production. The
availability of different borehole petrophysical data, particularly fracture type,
distribution, and orientation, provide
a good opportunity to design different drilling configurations. Multilateral
drilling using stacked and opposed
wells seems to be the most efficient
technique.
Second, application of multilateral
drilling within this oil field will provide
even better economical exploitation.
In order to target both transversal and
longitudinal fractures, the selected
technique will constitute an alternative
procedure prior to the existing vertical
well drilling.
Using geosteering and logging while
drilling (LWD), drillers will be able to
maximize contact with the objectives,
principally the longitudinal fractures.
Moreover, engineers need to determine the most appropriate well orientation in order to ensure well stability.
Orientations suggested in this article
are based on an in situ stress distribution study, an important input to the
proposed well drilling program.

The area has been affected by different tectonic events.1-3 Chronologically,
these events coincided with the Pan-African phase; the Caledonian phase; and
the Hercynian phase, which is divided
in two movements:
• Visean phase (Hercynian minor phase).
This phase is compressional, with a
direction of N40°E and leading to
creation of important structures and
NW-SE-trending faults.

The lithologies in this field consist
mainly of detrital sedimentary rocks
with a Precambrian basement or socle
(Fig. 1).5-7 The Cambrian age reservoir
units include:
• Unit 1; of varying thickness from south to
north. This unit consists of well-sorted,
fine to medium grain sands; the rock is
very compact.
• Unit 2; about 100 m thick. This unit is
characterized by the presence of fining
upward sequences. It’s also distinguished by a decrease of clay cement,
compared to Unit 1. The grain size
distribution is heterogeneous.
Detailed descriptions of both units
as well as other, underlying units have
been documented by many authors.2 6-8

Boreholes

We mapped petrophysical data from
the reservoir units. The data distribution
shows diverse discrepancies between
different boreholes. Notably:
• Unit 1 is characterized by relatively very low porosity, 3.5-8.5 % (Fig. 2).
• Generally, porosity gradient increases towards the southeast and the
northeast (Fig. 2).
• The permeability of Unit 1 is low
and varies from one borehole to another, with a maximum value of 2 md
in BA-12 (Fig. 3).
• Unit 2 is characterized by a maximum porosity of 10%. Unit 2 is also
distinguished by a very low porosity
distribution (Fig. 4).
• In Unit 2, we noticed that the
porosity values improve (relatively)
towards the eastern part of the field.
• Permeability values for Unit 2 are
low (Fig. 5). The maximum values are
seen near BA-1, BA-21, and BA-24.

Fractures
(Hercynian major). This phase has also
been found compressional, with a
direction of N120°E; it is believed to
be one of the most important compressional phases affecting the area.1 2
The structure has also been affected
by later tectonic events including a
44

distensile Triassic-Liasic phase, Autrichian phase, and Tertiary phases.2 4 As is
mentioned by the same listed authors,
the impact of other tectonic events is
not excluded.

Natural fractures are one of the main
targets in this study. Fractures were
identified from borehole images, cores,
and openhole logs.8
Natural fractures are caused by
tectonic stresses (tension, compression,
torsion) and diagenetic effects, such
as those resulting from compaction.

In BA oil field, natural fractures can
be distinguished into three types: open

(Figs. 6-9).
Transverse (horizontal) and longitudinal (vertical) fractures typically cross
each other (Figs. 6-7). Their occurrence
indicates their difference in chronology
and different in situ stress distributions.

fication” of the fractures according to
their fracture intensity index (FII).16
Results were as follows:
• FII >0.6, corresponds to a highly
fractured zone.
• 0.3 <FII <0.6, corresponds to
moderate fracture intensity.
• FII <0.3, corresponds to low fracture intensity.
Based on this fracture intensity
distribution, it appears that more than
40% of the boreholes encountered
within BA oil field are characterized by
highly fractured system.8
The parameters defined above represent basic guidelines. Applying these
guidelines should be done on a zoneby-zone basis.

Based on the relatively low permeability, we assume that the production
from the two reservoir units is unconventional. Further development of
the field should focus on the existing
fractures, especially on the open and
conductive fractures. These would have
more influence on the flow circulation and therefore should contribute to
improved productivity.
Because of the frequency of natural fractures in BA oil field and their
importance, we assume that there are
instabilities in the rock. Therefore, the
in situ stress distribution should be
taken in account prior to decisions on
drilling procedures.
We analyzed the data to determine
fracture orientations and in situ stresses
in order to ensure borehole stability.
There are three principal stress vectors: one vertical, σ̣v, and two horizontal, σH and σh. These stresses are useful
to designate the type of drilling and
well orientation that should be used,
such as horizontal drilling. Analyzing
the in situ wellbore stresses is essential
to identify the most stable well orientation. Generally, based on stress regime
distribution, there are three different
types of fractures possible:
• Normal faulting (extensional stress
regime) corresponding to σ̣v >σH >σh
• Strike slip faulting (transpressional

stress regime) leading to σH
>σv >σh
• Reverse faulting (compressional stress regime) corresponding to σ̣H >σh >σv.
In the case of normal
faulting, the most stable well
orientation is perpendicular
to the maximum horizontal stress, σH. In strike slip
faulting, a vertical well is the
most unstable well configuration. In the reverse faulting regime, the most stable
well is parallel to maximum
horizontal stress component,
σ
̣H.13 15 17-19
Consequently, we deduce
that the most stable well orientation will be perpendicular to the area that has the
smallest difference between
two main stress components.
Fig. 12 illustrates the most
stable well orientation in the
case of normal faulting. This
figure corresponds to one of
the main cases present in BA
oil field.

(Fig. 1). All these factors may
be considered the main stimulators to focus on advanced
drilling technology.
Based on field experience,
the reservoir is sufficiently
thick to steer the drilling.
Fig. 13 illustrates a proposed
drilling model with multilateral wells.
The use of geosteering
may reduce the number of
wells necessary. The main
advantage of this method is
that multiple fractures can be
intersected with or without a
long, horizontal section.

The numerical model offered here is
a polynomial, meaning it has 16 parameters.
Glycols have a tendency to absorb
acid gases. Acid-gas solubility is a
major factor when considering use of
a physical solvent in sour-gas dehydration plants. All glycols absorb hydrocarbons and acid gases to some extent.
In most cases, hydrocarbon removal is
undesirable and should be minimized.
In general, the lower temperature and
the higher the pressure, the more hydrocarbons and acid gases that will be
dissolved in different glycols.1 In some
cases, however, hydrocarbon solubility
actually increases with temperature.2
Glycol dehydration of natural gas
most commonly employs triethylene
glycol (TEG). Diethylene glycol and
ethylene glycol may also be used in
dehydration applications, but they are
often not considered due to failure
to achieve the dry-gas water content
requirements.

the impact of these emissions on the
environment have become important
issues.3 4
Regeneration of the rich glycol
solution liberates acid-gas components.
How much of these compounds is absorbed and consequently liberated from
the glycol depends on their concentrations in the wet gas being dehydrated
and on the contactor’s pressure and
temperature.5
In typical dehydration, the glycol
is regenerated to about 99% purity
or higher. The absorbed amount of
acid-gas components depends on the
amount of glycol circulated. If the
glycol is not regenerated to this purity,
then the amount of gas absorbed per
unit of lean glycol circulated would be
slightly less than the amount calculated
by the proposed model.
Glycol will absorb some hydrocarbons at the high pressure of the contactor. Glycol has a special affinity for
such cyclic hydrocarbons as benzene,
toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylene
(BTEX), light hydrocarbon components,
as well as polar gases

partial pressure for mole fraction and
partial pressure of component (i) at

DECOMMISSIONING—2

Historical contamination and future land-use plans for an abandoned
pipeline location and its facilities can
significantly affect the time line of
leave-to-abandon proceedings.
Part 1 of this article provided an
overview of Canada’s National Energy
Board’s regulatory requirements and
responsibilities with respect to pipeline
abandonment, typical environmental
issues associated with
pipeline
abandonment, and
types and
examples
of pipeline
abandonment addressed by NEB prior
to the Yukon Pipeline Ltd. (YPL) case.
Part 2 of the series, presented here,
provides a detailed case study of the
abandonment and remediation of the
YPL pipeline and its pump stations.
The article’s conclusion will look at
abandonment and remediation of the
line’s tank farm and discuss the practical
lessons that can be drawn from the YPL
abandonment.

grade within the right-of-way of the
White Pass and Yukon Route railway
(WP&YR, at the time was also owned
by White Pass). Where it deviated
from the railway right-of-way closer
to Whitehorse, the Canadian government sold the pipeline to YPL with its
own 30-m right-of-way, but YPL never
received official title to the land.

Including 52.3 km in BC and 92.2
km in the Yukon, the pipeline and
railway traversed a variety of generally
sparsely populated, sometimes sandy
but more frequently marshy or rocky
terrain, crossing many creeks and following the shorelines of numerous
water bodies, including 26 km along
the shore of Bennett Lake south of Car-

cross (Fig. 1) and 4 km along the shores
of Shallow Lake and Bernard Lake near
Fraser (Fig. 2).1
The pipeline’s general position on
grade adjacent to the railway, roads,
and rock cuts (particularly in the
more mountainous terrain toward the
southern end of the pipeline) exposed
it to potential third-party and natural
damage.
Some segments lay below grade. This
occurred:
• Within Whitehorse and Carcross.
• Where the pipeline crossed railways, highways, and secondary roads.
• Where the pipeline had become
buried (intentionally or unintentionally) by rockfall, railway ballast, or other
protective materials, or by overgrown
vegetation.
The pipeline had no cathodic protection and was substantially uncoated,
and was therefore susceptible to corrosion where it was buried, under
water, or in contact with wet ground.1-3
These factors contributed to numerous
product releases along the right-of-way
during the pipeline’s operating history.

Abandonment, mitigation

_______________

YPL pigged the pipeline prior to the
abandonment hearing to remove remaining product and clean the interior
of the pipe. Compressed air propelled
a squeegee-type pig from the highest
point on the pipeline toward Skagway,
and then from the same point toward
Whitehorse. The pig passed through the
line up to three times. YPL disconnected
the pipeline at the valve locations,
installed taps at low points on the pipeline to drain any trapped product, and
then visually inspected the interior of
the pipe and tested for organic vapors
to ensure it was clean.
YPL committed to remove most of
the pipeline; it being generally abovegrade and easily accessible by rail or
road. Removal required cutting the
pipe into manageable lengths, lifting it
by crane onto a rail car or truck bed,
and transporting it offsite for reuse or
recycling. Plans called for pipe buried
under a thin layer of rail ballast or fill

to be hand-exposed at regular intervals, cut, and lifted straight out of the
ground, avoiding contact with vegetation. Restoration included hand-raking
the disturbed soil back into place and
revegetating the area, as required.
Removing pipe from standing water
or wetlands required it be cut, tested,
and plugged where it entered and exited the wet area, and then pulled out of
the area from one end. A 2-km section
in a wetland near Cowley Lake, Yukon,
called for removal in winter to minimize disturbance of the wetland.
Pipeline buried under roads or railways needed to be filled with an inert
material and abandoned in place.
A qualified contractor, in accordance
with applicable regulations and guidelines, was to conduct pipeline removal,
with removal in environmentally sensitive areas to be monitored by a qualified
professional. The timing of work was

right-of-way in June 2005 and observed that the majority of the pipeline
had been removed. Cut ends of sections
abandoned in place were welded closed.
A linear indentation was still visible in
some areas where the pipe had rested
directly on the ground.

Assessment, remediation

YPL took a qualitative risk-based approach to identify areas of potential environmental concern (APECs) during a
Phase I ESA of the pipeline right-of-way.
YPL conducted a reconnaissance of the
entire right-of-way, looking for visual
evidence of contamination and assessing each recorded spill based on the age
of the spill, season during which the
spill occurred, hydrogeology of the site,
and distance to receptors. As a result
of this assessment,
five APECs were
identified on the
right-of-way.5
Phase II ESAs

95.559.

Worldwide, well over 50% of all pipelines use
coatings which shield (block) cathodic
protection currents if disbondment occurs.
Even the best corrosion coatings develop
disbonded areas over time. Solid film backed
polymeric coatings (shrink sleeves, tapes, and
multilayer systems) can perform well as
coatings, but when they disbond, they are
proven to prevent your cathodic protection
system from working.
Cathodic shielding is a serious problem and a
documented problem. Since the late 80’s there
is a large body of published research on
shielding. Much of this research can be seen on
our website.
Corrosion coatings which permit the passage
of cathodic protection currents to water under
disbonded areas are called “fail/safe” coatings.
In other words, if the coating fails, your
cathodic protection current can keep your
pipeline safe.

Two types of corrosion coatings are proven to
allow the passage of protective CP currents.
One of these proven “fail/safe” coatings is FBE.
The other proven “fail/safe” corrosion coating
is Polyguard RD-6. We have sold RD-6 since
1988, so there are thousands of installations.
We know of no project where serious
corrosion or SCC has been found under the
rarely seen disbonded areas of RD-6.

specifications with our corrosion expert,

develop the site for any purpose other
than a storage yard for rail materials”.
As such, the human health receptor YPL
used to calculate SSNSs was a teenaged trespasser on site for 1 hr/day,
365 days/year. Based on this scenario,
YPL concluded that the site presents no
human health risk in its current state.9
Abandonment of the site in its current
status could, however, restrict future
industrial development.
The SSNSs also fail to account for
hydrocarbons moving from soil into
groundwater. YPL has committed to
meeting FAL criteria after completion
of phase-separated liquid hydrocarbon
recovery.8-9 It is not clear, however,
whether the company can achieve FAL
groundwater criteria so long as associated soil remains saturated with
hydrocarbons.
Regardless, it may be a long time
before YPL completes liquid hydrocarbon recovery. Recovery under way since
1998 shows little sign of abating. Noone knows how much product remains
in the ground. Although it appears that
the liquid and dissolved plumes are
relatively stable, the size and behavior of
these plumes are not well understood.
YPL could consider more aggressive liquid hydrocarbon recovery techniques,
but one might debate the justification
for such measures given the lack of current plans to redevelop this land and the
apparent lack of current risk it poses to
human health or the local ecology.
The most powerful impetus to clean
up the Carcross site may be the desire to
achieve overall remediation of the pipeline system, thereby bringing leave-toabandon into effect and allowing more
marketable YPL assets, such as the UTF,
to be redeveloped. ✦

Would politicians
let Big Oil wed
Little Biofuels?
Because of how they’re measured,
biofuel operations can seem bigger than
they are.
Values for renewable fuel mandates and
plant capacities typically appear in gallons
per year. This year’s US requirement for
renewable fuel—ethanol—thus is 4.7 billion
gal. Sounds impressive. But it will be just
slightly more than 3% of all gasoline sold in
the US in 2007.

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

In an industry that measures its operations in barrels per day or tonnes per year,
biofuel quantities require translation. To
convert from gallons per year to barrels
per day, divide by 15,330, but watch those
zeros.
The arithmetic brings biofuel plant sizes
into perspective. The average capacity of
the 113 ethanol plants in operation in the
US on Feb. 12 was 49.411 million gal/year.
That’s 3,220 b/d.
Biodiesel plants are even smaller. On
a list published by the National Biodiesel
Board, the largest biodiesel plant, operated
by Memphis Biofuels LLC, has capacity
equal to the average ethanol plant size.
Most biodiesel plants are much smaller
than that.
The organization puts total US biodiesel production capacity at 864.4 million
gal/year (56,390 b/d). So the total capacity
of the entire biodiesel industry is less than
half the capacity of the average reﬁnery in
the US (131,850 b/d).
Politicians need to be reminded of these
proportions when they whine, as many
of them do, that oil reﬁners don’t invest
enough money in renewable and alternative energy sources, of which ethanol and
biodiesel are the political favorites.
Individually, biofuel plants at current
and probable sizes lack meaningful scale
to businesses the size of most reﬁners. To
make biofuels production signiﬁcant to its
business, a reﬁner must ﬁnd a way to build
and make money operating plants orders
of magnitude larger than those in operation
now. Or it must build or buy plants by the
dozens.
Politicians would never stand for such a
foray by “Big Oil” into ethanol and biodiesel. They’d howl about market concentration, price manipulation, tax subsidies, and
other such villainies of popular oil mythology.
And they’d be the same politicians now
fussing that oil companies don’t spend
enough money on renewable energy.

Gas withdrawal fails to move market
Energy commodity prices fell Feb. 14-15 as traders in the New York market
focused on a smaller-than-expected drawdown of US distillate stocks but shrugged
off a near-record withdrawal of natural gas from US underground storage during the
coldest week of this winter.
The March contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes lost $1.06 to $58/bbl
Feb. 14, giving back most of its gain from the previous trading session on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, as the Energy Information Administration reported distillate inventories fell 3 million bbl to 133.3 million bbl in the week ended Feb. 9, vs.
a Wall Street consensus for a 4 million bbl draw. However, US crude inventories
dropped 600,000 bbl to 323.9 million bbl, against consensus expectation for a 1
million bbl build. That followed a loss of 400,000 bbl the prior week. Gasoline stocks
were down by 2.1 million bbl against expectations for a 2.1 million bbl build.
On Feb. 15, March crude and gas contracts ﬂirted with 2-week low prices before
battling back to near-starting positions on NYMEX, despite an EIA report that same
day of the second largest withdrawal ever of gas from US storage, 259 bcf in the
week ended Feb. 9. It was the biggest weekly withdrawal so far this winter, larger
than the consensus among Wall Street analysts, and second only to the all-time high
of 260 bcf withdrawn in the week ended Jan. 17, 1997.
The related withdrawal of 179 bcf of gas from storage in the east region of the
US also was an all-time high for that area, said Robert S. Morris, Banc of America
Securities LLC, New York. “We believe the record withdrawal in the east region was
impacted by fuel switching and infrastructure constraints,” he said. That left US gas
storage at nearly 2.1 tcf, 193 bcf below year-ago levels but 268 bcf above the 5-year
average. “Assuming normal weather to the end of the winter season, it seems that
we are heading to an ending storage level of 1.3 tcf [in March], which falls inline with
the historic average. Thus, the effects of the warmer-than-normal weather in 2006
and its resulting natural gas surplus would ﬁnally dissipate,” said analysts in the
Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc.
On Feb. 15, the March gas contract traded at $7.05-7.38/MMbtu before closing
at $7.29/MMbtu, up by 5.1¢ for the day on NYMEX. “Failure of the market to drop
past the 2-week low of $7.05 earlier in the session may have spurred buying,” said
analysts at Enerfax Daily. The March crude contract traded at $56.62-58.51/bbl before
closing at $57.99/bbl.That volatility was due in large part to traders covering market
positions ahead of a long weekend, since ﬂoor trading at NYMEX was closed Feb.
19 for the Presidents Day holiday in the US. Moreover, the March crude contract was
scheduled to expire Feb. 20.
Market outlook
The Feb. 14 data—especially the unexpected drop in gasoline inventories—were
“positive for reﬁners,” said Jacques Rousseau, senior energy analyst at Friedman,
Billings, Ramsey Group Inc., Arlington, Va. “Total reﬁned product inventories showed
their largest week-over-week decline in over 3 months, as production and import
gains were insufﬁcient to meet increased consumption. We expect this trend of declining inventories to continue over the next several weeks, as reﬁnery maintenance
season continues, putting upward pressure on reﬁning margins and reﬁner stock
prices,” he said.
“Heating oil is dragging down the energy complex with the combination of the
winter phase-out and weather patterns that are calling for temperatures to be normal to above-normal in the last week of [February],” said Olivier Jakob, managing
director of Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland. “The dollar weakness should provide some support [for energy prices]. Gold is at multimonth high and the equities
continue to make new record highs,” he said Feb. 14.
Based on preliminary estimates, imports of LNG into the US will likely average
nearly 1.7 bcfd through January-February, “which is essentially in-line with our prior
forecast, and compares with just over 1.3 bcfd, on average, during the ﬁrst 2 months
of last year,” Morris said. He noted that natural gas prices in the US “have been
nearly $2/MMbtu higher than UK prices year-to-date vs. more than $2/MMbtu lower
during the same period last year.” As a result, he said, imports of LNG should increase to 2.5 bcfd, or 4.5% of total estimated US gas supply. That would be “a nearly
50% uptick vs. last year, which also largely reﬂects increased liquefaction capacity
around the globe,” Morris said.

Seeing is believing!

Are you faced with difficult interpretation challenges?
 Would you give this zone a second look?
The Triple-combo logs (left side) show no clear indication this zone contains hydrocarbons.
 What if you could “see” the fluids contained in this zone to identify fluid type
and quantity?
Now you can! The 2D NMR images from the MR ExplorerSM (MREXSM) service in
tracks 4 & 5 identify gas condensate in this zone.
 Does it contain commercial quantities of hydrocarbon?
The fluid volumetrics measured by the MREX service (in track 6) indicate commercial
quantities of hydrocarbon are present in this interval. This was confirmed by formation

tests using the Baker Atlas Reservoir Characterization InstrumentSM (RCISM) service.

Image the fluids and know for sure.
The MREX service from Baker Atlas makes direct measurements of fluid type and volume.
2D NMR imaging enables you to “see” the fluids to ensure all potential hydrocarbon zones
are identified for maximum recovery on every well.

Bright outlook seen for global
drilling industry

T

he outlook for a continued tight oil and natural gas
supply/demand balance suggests a bright outlook
for the worldwide drilling industry for the foreseeable future.
There is little danger of a broad and deep glut in global
drilling rig markets emerging anytime in the near future, say
industry experts interviewed for this report.
With expectations of continued strong demand in oil
and gas set against persistent production declines in mature areas, industry forecasts have called for a requirement
of about 100 million boe/d of oil and gas to be added to
production capacity during the next 10 years, notes Claus
Chur, 2006 chairman of the International Association of
Drilling Contractors.

“Currently, the US and Canadian markets have an oversupply of land drilling rigs. Drilling contractors, both the
established and the start-ups, reacted to the very positive
market signals in 2005 and early 2006 by accelerating the
building of new land rigs. The newbuilds entering the market
exceeded demand at the end of 2006 as gas prices settled
and industry economics softened.
“We now have an event in the US market without historical precedent—active drilling rig count is rising, but dayrates
are declining due to oversupply. As a result, the economics
of drilling a well in 2007 appear to be improving monthly
for the E&P companies. We believe by midyear 2007 North
America will have a surplus of 150-200 land rigs.”

tract is so high that we are now seeing long-term (4-5 years)
contracts in excess of $500,000 per day being achieved for
some of the more modern vessels,” he says.
“The forecast is for deepwater exploration to continue
to expand over the next decade. With the prospect of longterm contracts and high dayrates, international drilling contractors, speculators, investors, and government oil and gas
companies are investing heavily into new deepwater rig
build programs.
“There are currently more than 40 deepwater vessels being built in shipyards, primarily in South Korea and
Singapore. There are also some major upgrades of older
semisubmersibles going on, to bring them up to new
deepwater standards.”

Unconventional gas
A major contributor to the surge in US drilling has been the
explosion of activity directed toward developing unconventional gas resources in tight formations, shales, and coalbed
methane. It has been forecast that more than 76% of new
gas reserves found on land in the US will come from unconventional gas plays during the next decade.
Beyond the increased drilling, tackling the unconventional gas resource has changed the face of the US oil and gas
industry, contends Nixon: “Unconventional gas ushered in
the era of large independents, who, because of these opportunities, displaced the majors and are leading the way in
unconventional gas plays.
“Unlocking the secrets of the Barnett, Fayetteville, and
other shales was like ﬁnding elephant reserves in our own
backyard, and the race to win the acreage and produce the
gas carried the drilling industry through the drilling economics of 2006 and today.
“Unconventional gas accelerated the adoption of directional drilling, PDC bits, multiple zone completion tools, and
massive frac jobs. It enabled operators to develop ﬁelds us-

ing the ‘batch approach’—multiple wells utilizing standardsized products—versus drilling many different wells with
different types of rigs, different-sized bits, and utilizing different sized casing.”
Bloom notes that unconventional gas plays are big resources for independent operators that contract hundreds
of rigs with drilling capabilities of 8,000-15,000 ft.
“These rigs must also be capable of drilling horizontal
laterals of up to 5,000 ft and must have the ability to rig
up and move quickly and easily, because most wells are
drilled in approximately 4 weeks or less between each
rig move.
“This is causing the greatest increase in land rig building
since the early 1980s, At this time the industry is building
over 100 new land rigs, and this trend will continue for the
foreseeable future.”
Mannon points out that while unconventional gas plays
traditionally have been highly sensitive to price, the level of
E&P interest in recent ﬁnds suggests a possibility for longterm stability.
“…Five years ago, the US natural gas industry shied
away from drilling into dense shale,” he says. “Today, it’s
becoming an increasingly important source of domestic energy, due to recent advancements in technology that made
drilling in these areas more cost-effective.
“Two of the top three domestic independents are focused on exploring shale formations, and another independent recently announced the discovery of a major expansion to the Barnett shale gas ﬁeld and identiﬁed four
new or emerging shale ﬁelds in Texas, North Dakota, and
Western Canada.”
Mannon notes that his company is capitalizing on the
increased interest in these shale formations through its
drilling and production rental tools subsidiary Quail Tools. In
January, Quail Tools will open a new location in Texarkana,
serving the East Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas markets. ]

Drilling industry’s top challenge:
personnel needs

T

he most critical challenge facing the oil and natural gas drilling industry is ﬁlling an urgent need for
skilled technical personnel.
Claus Chur, 2006 chairman for the International
Association of Drilling Contractors, points out that last year

Changing culture
While technology advances have reduced risk to drilling industry personnel, a change in organizational cultures will provide
the next step-change in improving drilling operations safety,
says Chur.
“I do not see any speciﬁc technology that will signiﬁcantly
impact our safety performance in the next few years,” he points

out. “After a decade focusing on safer equipment and applying
improved safety regulations, drilling contractors have been very
successful implementing new management systems and processes designed to help people manage safety.”
David Mannon, senior vice-president and chief operating ofﬁcer for Parker Drilling Co., Houston, cites the company’s new
Quality Management System for its “unprecedented success”
in safety performance in recent years. In 2006, Parker was logging record low recordable incident totals after achieving the
lowest such rate among IADC members in 2005.
“We attribute this success not only to a continual emphasis
on safety, but to our new QMS initiative and a world-class training facility,” he says. “The focus on continuous improvement is
a critical element in the approach to safety.” ]

were drilling projects in fewer days, this only partially offset the
increased rig costs.
Nixon contends that the major bit companies, including
Varel, had a lock on the roller cone market due to the signiﬁcant
technological and economical barriers to entry.
“These barriers do not exist at nearly the same level in the
PDC segment,” he points out. “Here the new PDC drill bit
entrants, like Varel, are giving the majors a real run for their
money on both product performance and service.”

The design and operation of Parker Drilling’s deep barge

program, he contends.
“Large wellbores and associated casing programs require
the appropriate set-back and hookload capacity to handle, store,
and run tubulars. As directional work is performed in large hole
sections to take advantage of faster penetration rates and lower
temperatures, the rig’s capacity for handling high-volume and

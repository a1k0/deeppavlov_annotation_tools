COVER
Drilling safety practices are enhanced through the use of remotecontrolled tubular running systems. The cover shows Weatherford’s
Overdrive system, which eliminates the need for hazardous manual
operation of casing-running equipment. The system involves several
components that reduce the risk of operator errors through multiple
safety interlocks. OGJ’s special report on Drilling Safety Practices
begins on p. 24 and includes discussion about rig mechanization,
safety statistics, and planning a casing program to reach TD without mishap (p. 41). The special report also outlines how rig moves
can be made safer using combination receptacles to make and break
electrical connections (p. 44). Photo from Weatherford.

Lehman: Global E&P spending to jump 20% in 2008 about half the 27 member states—accepted a less drastic solution
Worldwide exploration and production expenditures will increase 20% to $418 billion this year, according to a midyear survey
of 398 companies by Lehman Bros.
The survey indicates greater acceleration in 2008 spending plans
in North America and elsewhere than those indicated 6 months
ago in the firm’s previous survey.
E&P expenditures will rise 15% to $98 billion in the US, 11%
to $27.5 billion in Canada, and 22% to $293 billion total in all
other countries. Lehman said this represents a record percentage
increase over a 6-month period from December to June since the
firm began conducting these surveys.
Lehman’s December 2007 survey indicated growth of just 3.5%
in the US, a 12% spending reduction in Canada, and a 16% rise in
spending elsewhere.
The latest survey indicates that operators added $35 billion to
this year’s budgets worldwide, with the largest boost to projects
outside North America, an $18 billion increase in 2008 capital
spending, said analyst James D. Crandell. Operators added $13 billion to their 2008 US budgets and $4 billion to budgets for spending in Canada.
In 2007, companies overspent their budgets by $8.5 billion,
Crandell said. Outside North America, budgets were overspent
by $5.5 billion, and US budgets were overspent by $3.5 billion,
partially offset by $500 million of underspending of budgets in
Canada.
This year’s budget additions are being driven by higher commodity price expectations. The average price on which companies
are basing their 2008 budgets has risen to $85.23/bbl for oil, up
25% from the level indicated in December, and $8.07/Mcf for US
natural gas, up from $6.78/Mcf indicated in the December survey.
Of all the integrated oil companies, independents, and national
oil companies Lehman surveyed, 70% anticipate that E&P spending growth will continue into 2009, with gains of at least 10%
expected by 80% of these companies.

EU energy ministers reach unbundling compromise
At their June 6 meeting in Luxembourg, European Union energy
ministers reached a compromise on the ownership unbundling dispute. Germany and France, which had led the opposition with six
other EU countries, may retain ownership of their champions: Electricite de France and Gaz de France in France, and E.On AG and RWE
in Germany. The two countries had been the strongest opponents to
the dismantling of their integrated gas and electricity utilities.
The terms of the compromise are tough, however. Energy Commissioner spokesman Ferran Taradellas Espuny told OGJ that what
was achieved at the Luxembourg meeting was that the die-hard unbundling proponents—the UK and the Netherlands together with

than the full ownership unbundling of production and transport.
The final agreement will be shaped after the EU Parliament’s formal
vote in mid-July. While the sale of the transport-marketing networks
has been avoided and ownership retained, the units will be operated independently from their parent company and supervised by
a watchdog regulator with bolstered powers. If the compromise is
approved, the integrated groups will have to introduce a number of
measures to make sure the separation of production and networks
is really “effective.” The supervisory body of the network will be
competent on all the main subjects that fall within the scope of the
shareholder such as investments, debt, and return on investments.
It will be managed completely by an independent transmission
operator, and the transmission network personnel will be strictly
distinct from personnel of the historic operator.
The adoption of the relevant directives involving the full reorganization of the integrated groups should not take place before
2009 after which member states will have 2 years to incorporate
them into their legislation.
Commenting on the compromise, Energy Commissioner Andris
Piebalgs praised the good will that led to it, adding, “The agreement
covers a wide package of measures, including unbundling, real powers and independence of national energy regulators, and the establishment of a new agency that will be responsible for ensuring much
more effective and easy cross-border trade in electricity and gas.”

Dorgan opposes CFTC chairman nomination
US Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-ND) said he opposes the nomination of Walter L. Lukken, acting chairman of the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, to become chairman because Lukken
has not adequately addressed energy market speculation.
Speaking to the North Dakota and South Dakota Bankers Association in Bismarck June 9, Dorgan charged that the run-up in
crude oil prices to nearly $140/bbl has been caused by speculators
who are running circles around the federal agency, which is supposed to stop damaging commodities speculation.
Lukken appeared as a nominee on June 4 before the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, along with current
CFTC member Bart Chilton and Scott O’Malia, minority clerk on
the Senate Appropriations Committee’s Energy and Water Development Subcommittee, who have been nominated as CFTC commissioners. The committee has not yet acted on the nominations.
Dorgan, who serves on the Energy and Commerce Committee as
well as the Agriculture Committee, told the bankers that testimony
before both panels in recent months has convinced him that the fundamentals of supply and demand do not justify current oil price levels. He said he believes prices are 30-40% higher than is justified.
Dorgan urged US President George W. Bush to withdraw Luk-

Tullow tests oil from Jubilee ﬁeld off Ghana
Tullow Oil PLC has tested 5,200 b/d of 36° oil and 5.3 MMcfd
of associated natural gas from its Mahogany-2 well in Jubilee field
off Ghana. The appraisal well is part of its program to assess the
productivity and reservoir model.
The well, drilled by the Songa Saturn drillship, reached 3,443
m TD in 1,080 m of water on the West Cape Three Points license.
Tullow said it was confident that Jubilee could flow more than
20,000 b/d when it comes on stream in 2010 (OGJ Online, May
26, 2008, p. 20).
Tullow Chief Executive Officer Aidan Heavey said the results
support the decision by the Jubilee partnership to fast-track the
project.
A single zone covering an interval of 17 m was tested through
a 40/64-in. choke, resulting in a flowing tubing head pressure of
1,540 psi, Tullow said.
Later this year, the Blackford Dolphin and Eirik Raude deepwater rigs will carry out an appraisal, development, and exploration
drilling program in both the West Cape Three Points and the Deepwater Tano licenses.

GDF, Dana test WEB prospect gas well off Egypt
Gaz de France has made a natural gas discovery on Egypt’s West
El Burullus (WEB) prospect off northeast Alexandria in the Mediterranean Sea. Gaz de France is operator in a 50-50 partnership
with Dana Petroleum PLC.
The WEB-1X exploration well was drilled on the 1,364 sq km
acreage within a production-sharing contract that became effective in late 2005. A 3D seismic survey shot in 2006 led to the
WEB- X1 well’s being drilled in 19 m of water.
The partners used the Ocean Spur jack-up to drill the well to
2,403 m TVD, targeting a Pliocene prospect consisting of a turbidite sandstone channel system. The well encountered good quality
gas-bearing sands, the company said, and extensive wireline logs
were run to maximize the acquired data.
In a multiflow rate drillstem test of the reservoir sequence, the
well flowed at up to 27 MMcfd of gas.
The acquired data will now be analyzed and an appraisal program defined. Numerous additional prospects have been identified by Gaz de France and Dana within the WEB exploration and
production license. In addition, other exploration targets within

deeper horizons such as the Miocene and Oligocene will be considered. West El Burullus was described by the two companies as
having “outstanding exploration potential.”

PA Resources spuds another well in Didon ﬁeld
PA Resources AB, Stockholm, has spudded another well on its
wholly owned Didon field off Tunisia. The horizontal oil producer
Didon-9 is being drilled into the western compartment, which is
expected to hold recoverable oil.
Didon, on the Zarat block, is 75 km west of the Tunisia-Libya
border in 75 m of water. Last March the field’s average production
was 20,000 b/d of oil.
The well is being drilled by the Ensco 85 jack up through a slot
on the Didon platform.
The rig recently completed the Didon-7 horizontal production
well, which is now producing 12,500 b/d of oil. The field’s reserves will be increased after Didon-7’s pilot hole encountered the
top reservoir 5 m higher than originally estimated.
Wireline logs and pressure data confirmed good reservoir
properties and a 30-m oil column, PA Resources said. A 500-m
long drain was completed within the two upper layers of the reservoir at a horizontal level of 2,714 m, it added. Didon-7’s length
was 4,015 m.
The Didon-5 well, which was shut in before the Didon-7 startup, is being hooked up for production and is also expected to
resume operations by the end of June.
The Didon-9 well also will be a horizontal oil producer in the
crestal area of the western compartment on the field. A vertical
pilot hole will first be drilled to confirm reserves and gather data,
including pressure and saturation profiles, which will provide
information on oil-water contact. Data also will be used to determine the optimal placement of the Didon-9 horizontal well,
after which the horizontal production drain will be drilled, the
company said.
“This new well Didon-9 is expected to recover oil from the
western compartment and contribute with additional reserves and
production capacity,” said PA Resources Pres. and Chief Executive
Officer Ulrik Jansson.
Upon completion of Didon-9, the Ensco 85 will continue with
the exploration drilling program on the Zarat permit, including
the Didon North prospect. ✦

Lederne had threatened to stop producing 155,000 b/d starting June 6.
OLF described the negotiations as tough because the unions
had high demands and priorities that differed from those in discussions held earlier in the year.
Staff in operating companies, drilling, and catering are covered
by the agreements, which are valid until the next tariff revision
occurs in 2010.

Marathon’s Alvheim oil ﬁeld begins production
Marathon Petroleum Norge AS has begun producing oil from
Alvheim field off Norway via its floating production, storage, and
offloading vessel. It expects to increase output with a third development later this year.
Alvheim and Vilje fields are expected to ramp up production to
75,000 boe/d by early next year from a reserves base estimated at
250 million boe. Six wells have been drilled and completed on production licenses 203 (PL230), 088BS, and 036C on the Norwegian
continental shelf.
Volund is a satellite scheduled to start production in the second
half of 2009 on nearby PL150. Marathon operates Volund with a
65% stake, and its partner Lundin Norway AS has a 35% interest.
Plans originally called for Alvheim to come on stream by yearend 2007, but production was delayed because of the tight supply
market for oil equipment. It is a significant asset for Marathon and
Norway. The company spent $1.2 billion developing the project,
which lies 224 km from Stavanger in 125 m of water. The Alvheim
purpose-designed FPSO vessel has a design capacity of 120,000
b/d of oil and 125 MMcfd of natural gas with storage capacity of
560,000 bbl of oil.
Marathon will send gas to the existing UK SAGE system using
a new 38 km cross-border pipeline. “The Alvheim FPSO will serve
as a central hub in the area,” the company said. “The nearby Vilje
field is already tied back to Alvheim. As a regional hub, the Alvheim
FPSO is well positioned to deliver significant production for the
long-term.”
Marathon’s partners in the Alvheim development are ConocoPhillips Skandinavia AS with a 20% working interest, and Lundin
Norway AS, with a 15% stake. Ashley Heppenstall, president and
chief executive of Lundin Petroleum, said its production would
increase the company’s output by 50%.

Seadrill to buy four newbuild jack up rigs
Seadrill has ordered four newbuild jack up rigs from KFELS and
PPL Shipyard in Singapore under contracts totaling $850 million.
Seadrill’s fleet will increase to 12 units, up from 8, when the rigs
are delivered 2010.
According to the $420 million contract with KFELS, two of the
rigs will have the capability to operate in 400 ft of water and reach

Processing

drilling depths of 30,000 ft. They will be built at KFELS and will be
based on the KFELS Mod V ‘B’ design. These will be ready for delivery in June and November 2010. They will be the fifth and sixth
jack up orders that Seadrill has placed with KFELS.
The rigs to be built by PPL Shipyard will be able to operate in
375 ft of water and drill to 30,000 ft. They will be modelled on
the Baker Marine Pacific Class 375 Deep Drilling design. Deliveries
are scheduled in March and November 2010. The contract price is
$430 million. Seadrill said these were the second and third jack up
orders it has placed with PPL Shipyard.
The company also has struck option agreements for additional
jack up newbuilds in 2011.
Alf C. Thorkildsen, chief executive of Seadrill Management AS,
said the offshore rig market would remain tight in the years to
come. “The decision to initiate the $850 million building program was taken based on expected high return on invested equity
due to the following factors: the current jack up order book is less
than 20% of the existing aging fleet (which has an average age of
23 years), the newbuild jack up capacity before 2011 at first class
yards is limited, and the number of term contract for jack ups is
increasing, he said.”

Petrobras to study oil shale development in Utah
Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) has signed an agreement with Oil Shale Exploration Co. LLC (OSEC), Mobile, Ala.,
and Japanese investment and trading company Mitsui & Co. Ltd. to
jointly conduct a study into the development of oil shale projects
in Utah.
“Petrobras will undertake a technical, economic, and environmental commercial feasibility study testing its oil shale technology
called Petrosix on mineral resources controlled by OSEC in Utah,”
Petrobras said. Petrobras said that, along with Mitsui, it obtained
the right to acquire a 10% to 20% stake in the OSEC project.
The Petrosix oil shale processing technology is a proprietary
retort technology, developed by Petrobras.
“The OSEC oil shale project in the state of Utah encompasses the
lease of a oil shale property from the Bureau of Land Management
for oil shale research, development, and demonstration and the
recent purchase of more than 22,000 acres of privately owned oil
shale property in the Green River Basin of Utah,” said Petrobras.
“The combined lease and owned property provides OSEC with
ownership or rights to more than 30,000 acres of oil shale property, with a discovered resource base in the range of 3 billion bbl,
according to Norwest Corporation estimates,” it said.
In June 2007 the US Department of the Interior issued a research, development, and demonstration lease to OSEC for 160
acres of public land in eastern Utah. An analysis determined that
the project would have no significant environmental impacts (OGJ
Online, June 16, 2007). ✦

Dutch Shell PLC’s garages, small airports, and factories. According
to Unite, the union representing the drivers, the strike will hit 14
terminals across mainland UK.
The Department for Business, Enterprise, and Regulatory Reform (BERR) estimated that Shell had one in 10 filling stations in
the UK and that it was “inevitable” that there would be fuel shortages at some.
The government is preparing contingency plans to address the
potential crisis and has suspended competition rules to allow oil
companies to cooperate with each other on sharing oil distribution
information.
The union is seeking a 13% pay increase,which it believes would
cost Shell less than £1 million to settle. It has accused Shell of applying pressure on the haulage companies, Hoyer UK and Suckling
Transport, to keep their salaries low.
Unite will hold last minute peace talks with the haulage companies, Shell’s contractors, at the Advisory, Conciliation, and Arbitration Service (ACAS). But there is little hope that the talks will
be fruitful, although the government, motoring organizations, and
Shell have urged the parties to reach an agreement.

The strike action follows shortly after the shutdown at Grangemouth refinery, where employees walked out after pay discussions collapsed (OGJ Apr. 30, 2008, Newsletter). These incidents
are worrying the government as they echo similar protests in 2000
when truckers protested soaring fuel prices and nearly brought the
UK to a standstill in a “drive slow” action.
Across Europe, the haulage industry, farmers, and fishermen are
also increasing pressure on their governments to address high fuel
prices because of its negative effect on their businesses (OGJ Online, May 30, 2008).

Pakistan PVC producer to raise plant capacity
Pakistan’s primary producer of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resins,
Engro Asahi Polymer & Chemicals Ltd. (EAPC), is planning to expand its PVC resin production capacity by 50,000 tonnes/year to
150,000 tpy.
PVC resin demand in Pakistan has steadily increased, reaching
120,000 tpy in 2006 from 62,000 tpy in 2000. PVC resin demand
is expected to reach 168,000 tpy in 2010, EAPC said.
In 2006, EAPC’s share of the PVC resin market was 92%. ✦

Aussie gas ﬂow may take 60 days after ﬁre
Apache Energy Ltd. reported it will be 2 months before partial
gas supplies are restored following a fire and explosion that ripped
through its gas processing plant on Varanus Island, about 100 km
from Karratha on Australia’s North West Shelf.
“Our specialist team of engineers, including assessment and recovery experts, have made an initial assessment that partial restoration of gas supply is likely to take a couple of months,” said Tim
Wall, managing director, Apache Energy.
Apache reported the accident on June 3, saying that no one
had been injured and 153 people were evacuated. It said the incident involved a pipeline transporting oil and gas from offshore
production facilities to the island’s processing facilities. Thirteen
people remain on the island to monitor the situation, the company said.
Wall said the incident caused visible damage to piping infrastructure and to some supporting equipment. He said the firm’s
engineering team is working to determine the full extent of damage.
The operations at Varanus Island, which provide 30% of Western Australia’s domestic gas requirements, account for 330 MMcfd
of gas and 8,000 b/d of oil; Apache’s net production is about 200
MMcfd and 5,000 b/d.
“The majority of the gas delivered through Varanus Island
is supplied to industrial customers,” Wall said. He said Apache,
which has declared force majeure, would keep the state government informed and would be in “ongoing dialogue with all
stakeholders to reduce the impact on the state’s gas supply as best
as possible.”
Woodside Petroleum Ltd., which operates the NWS venture and
is now the state’s only major domestic gas source, will be able to
make up about 25% of the lost gas Apache Energy was producing
before the explosion.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

“There’s minimal spare capacity,” a Woodside spokeswoman
said. “We’re likely to supply up to 100 terajoules[/day], depending on the conditions of the day.”
As a result of the accident, many mining operators in the region
have been forced to switch to diesel power or to temporarily shut
down operations.
Alcoa Inc., which sources about 25% of its energy needs for its
Pinjarra and Kwinana alumina refineries from Apache, is said to be
using diesel power to keep both plants at full capacity, while mineral sands miner Iluka Resources Ltd. has shut down operations as
it seeks an alternative source of gas.
Other companies that could be adversely affected include BHP
Billiton Ltd., Newcrest Mining Ltd., Newmont Mining Corp., and
Minara Resources Ltd.
It’s the second time this year that industrial users have faced
disruption to their supplies of natural gas. In January, an electrical fault shut down the gas plant at the NWS joint venture, which
provides about 65% of the state’s gas.

Shell unit to assess Sonatrach pipelines
Sonatrach has contracted Shell Global Solutions to review the
integrity of its pipeline transmission networks to ensure that
they meet stringent legislative standards. Shell’s report will help
Sonatrach reduce its risk of pipeline failures and offer recommendations to improve the reliability and availability of the system.
Shell will identify the integrity and reliability management process for Sonatrach’s pipelines and evaluate the technical integrity of
part of the pipeline system. Sonatrach operates more than 16,000
km of transmission pipelines.
Hocine Chekired, vice-president of Sonatrach’s pipeline transportation branch, said the assessment would enable it “to get an accurate assessment of where we are now and how to best optimize
moving forward.” ✦

of which contribute to environmental
degradation. The fluctuating level of
field work also takes an economic toll

As Shell developed Pinedale, it found
nearly 2.5 times the reserves it calculated in 2001. Todd said the rules issued
in 2000 did not anticipate the reserves

In September 2005, Shell and
other operators submitted a longterm management plan for BLM lands,
proposing sequential development with

operators expect a ruling in September.

fewer pad sites than the total authorized
by the 2000 record of decision.
Shell is restoring older drilling pads
and has reclaimed 22 Pinedale locations

SUBSEA TIEBACK
FORUM & EXHIBITION

PennWell invites you to the 9th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition. SSTB has become the premier
event for one of the fastest growing field development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March
3 – 5, 2009 in San Antonio, TX at the Henry B. Gonzales Convention Center. Over 2,000 people and 150
exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference. You can’t afford to miss it.
This year’s theme is “The Deepest Show On Earth.” As our industry changes, the sharing of knowledge and
collective experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety, and economics of the
subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by industry leaders. As in the
past, only by participating in this conference will you be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will
not be published and no Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room stays inside the conference
room. We hope you will join us.

Flinch or feint?
Call it the flinch heard round the world. Or the
feint heard down Pennsylvania Avenue. The Senate
charged boldly to a floor vote on a complex climate-change bill, stared defiantly at cost estimates,
glanced heedfully at news of economic distress,
and on June 6 turned quickly to other business.
Democratic Senate leaders couldn’t muster
enough votes to limit debate on the Boxer-WarnerLieberman Climate Security Act and withdrew it
from consideration. They complained about Republican scare tactics. Republicans countered that
the majority party wanted not serious consideration of a climate-change bill but rather legislative
mud to sling at President George W. Bush.
Is it too much to hope that at least a few senators, whatever their party, studied the bill and
concluded that it didn’t merit their support, now
or anytime?

Emission limits
The Boxer-Warner-Lieberman bill followed
the cap-and-trade route to action on emissions of
greenhouse gases. It would have assigned annually
declining limits to emissions and authorized the
government to sell tradable emission allowances
to businesses. It also would have dispensed $3.3
trillion that cosponsor Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.)
estimates the government would collect through
2050 from the allowance sales. The payments
ostensibly would have eased the imposed adjustments in energy use.
For supporters of the legislation, timing was
unfortunate. The price of gasoline in the US was
approaching $4/gal when floor discussion began.
It’s an election year. Many lawmakers who might
otherwise have supported the measure were not,
under these circumstances, eager to vote for something sure to raise energy prices even more. Senate
leaders thus could pull the bill at the first sign of
trouble, call it a Bush failure, and know that more
auspicious times await. The likely nominees of
both major parties, Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.)
and Barack Obama (D-Ill.), both support capand-trade measures in some form. By the time the
next president has settled into office, energy prices
might have subsided.
Prospects thus look bright for cap-and-trade
legislation after November. Or do they? Is it possible
that the US now has taken its first hard look at cap-

and-trade and decided it didn’t like the view?
The oil and gas industry should hope so. The
cap-and-trade strategy for the fight against climate
change is expensive and devious. The allowance
trading at its core adds market flavoring to a toxic
mix of economic manipulations by the state.
The costs are indistinct but inescapably large. The
approach, mandating emission cuts big enough
to approach environmental significance, has to assume the development of nonfossil-energy sources
and technologies on implausible scales. And there’s
no assurance that the cost, economic rearrangement, governmental expansion, and technological
overreach would have any effect on global average
temperature.
A cap-and-trade scheme would turn into a
contest for political favors. This already is evident
in the lavish adjustment payments that the bill just
withdrawn promised in an effort by its sponsors
to buy support. And trading in allowances whose
value depended on governmental decrees would
invite mischief. Overall, cap-and-trade would punish energy use and reward exploitation of regulatory systems.
These are fundamental deficiencies. The problem with Boxer-Warner-Lieberman isn’t that it’s
too complex or too aggressive. It’s that it pursues
an unworkable strategy. No matter who wins the
presidency, the bill can’t be fixed.

Industry divided
Climate change, like many issues, has divided
the oil and gas industry. Some companies support
involuntary precautions. Some companies doubt
the need for precaution but want clarity of regulation. And some companies see climate-change
response as big cost undertaken for little purpose.
What oil and gas companies should be able to
agree on is the importance of honesty in a fateful
debate and in whatever policies result from it.
Cap-and-trade creates too many dark corners, beginning with the costs it would load onto energy
users. The oil industry should avoid it.
The alternative to cap-and-trade is a carbon tax.
Both schemes raise the cost of using fossil energy.
A carbon tax just doesn’t hide the pain. It’s the
only proposition conducive to honest debate over
climate change remedies and therefore the only
alternative worthy of consideration. ✦

Jimmy Moore, Transocean’s director
of Quality, Health, Safety, and Environmental Services, said Transocean

“Clients support our safety processes,” Moore said. “We share lessons

our own internal safety audits.”
Keith Morley, Weatherford senior
vice-president and chief safety officer,
emphasized equipment innovations and
consistency of job execution, saying
a job safety analysis is done for each
individual activity to ensure that the
standard operating procedure will work
safely in a particular situation.
“If you don’t take into account the
time of day or the weather, or any other
influencing factor, you may still miss a
hazard,” Morley said. “We are working
to be aligned with our customers from
a philosophical perspective as well as
from a practical perspective.”

and documentation requirements are
key to implementing standard operating

Oil, gas safety statistics mark progress
Paula Dittrick,
Senior Staff Writer
Safety statistics contradict the general
public’s stereotyped image of oil and gas
drilling as being a hazardous business,
report spokesmen from the American
Association of Drilling Engineers and
the International Association of Drilling
Contractors.
Statistics demonstrate that industry
has made great strides since the 1990s in
managing risks. Industry continues working to change negative perceptions about
itself, said John Lindsay, IADC chairman
and Helmerich & Payne International
Drilling Co. executive vice-president for
US and international operations, at a
safety conference (OGJ, Feb. 11, 2006, p.
33).
AADE national pres., Joe Leimkuhler
said he shudders at the “Hollywood image” of the oil and gas industry. Leimkuhler is Shell Exploration & Production
Co.’s offshore well delivery manager for
TLP & platform operations in the Americas.
Both Lindsay and Leimkuhler acknowledge questions exist regarding
the comprehensiveness and accuracy
of exploration and production safety
statistics, many of which are reported on
a voluntary basis.
US Occupational Safety and Health

“The biggest risks we face in the
drilling industry in terms of cost are
operational miscues or something you
were not anticipating,” Leimkuhler said.
“If you have an organization that is taking enough time to plan their operation
from a safety perspective, it’s almost a
certainty that they are doing the same
level of planning and thinking around
the operational steps related to the job
itself. Those who get the job done safely
also tend to get it done right the first
time.”
Transocean’s Moore emphasizes the
need for “a well thought-out plan and

recordable if there is a fracture, prescription medication is prescribed, or stitches
are required or if the person is unable to
return to work.
IADC administers an accident statistics
program (ASP) in which members voluntarily submit monthly statistics.
Citing 2007 IADC statistics for rig operations, Leimkuhler said the US onshore
TRIR is 5.1, US offshore TRIR is 1.4, and the
worldwide rig TRIR average is 2.1.
“To really put safety in perspective,
the average 2.1 TRIR for rig operations
is lower than [OSHA’s] 3.3 TRIR for real
estate,” Leimkuhler said. You are safer
statistically on the rig ﬂoor than driving
around with a real estate agent. That
does not mean there are fewer risks on
the rig ﬂoor, just that we as an industry
manage them well.”
Despite that record, there are areas
for improvement. “One of the things we
do not have for offshore operations is
calibrated incident data for TRIR. We can’t
get that measure for offshore,” Leimkuhler said.

following it—do what we say we’re
going to do.” If the work does not go
as envisioned, anyone on the rig is
encouraged to stop the job so adjustments can be made to continue safe
operations.
“Every incident (whether safety or
operational) has a cost in time, manpower, and reputation,” Moore said.
“We investigate every loss whether
business, equipment, or safety related,
analyze the findings, and ensure any
learning from those incidents are well
communicated.”

While the US Minerals Management
Service tracks the total offshore injury
count and other incident rate information, it is submitted on a voluntary basis
from operators. Those data show signiﬁcant improvement during 1998-2004 as
the TRIR went from 3.84 to 0.66 for those
companies reporting data. During 2004 to
2007, the TRIR has been relatively stable
at 0.66 to 0.86 for the same data set.
But Leimkuhler cautions industry
against taking too much comfort in those
numbers. The MMS data for number of
incidents tell a different story for the total
range of offshore operations (See ﬁgure).
Based upon MMS statistics, Leimkuhler plotted total number of recordable
incidents vs. wells spudded per year in
the Gulf of Mexico. The number of spudded wells is a relative measure of total
drilling and completion activity (total
wells spudded by the operators who
report incident rate data represented 60%
of the wells spudded each year).
“The high-water mark for the last 10
years is 2000 with 1,382 wells drilled.
It has dropped every year since then,”
Leimkuhler said. “If you take the wells
drilled so far in 2008 and project them
out to year end, we’re on pace to drill
576 new wells in the gulf. That’s 42% of
the wells drilled in 2000…but the actual
number of injuries and fatalities seems
to be going up, certainly not down.”
Based on this analysis, Leimkuler
questions whether there has been any

progress in overall offshore drilling
safety since 2002.
“If you look at MMS data for reported
incident data from operators who willfully report, you might be inclined to
believe that it’s better,” Leimkuhler said.
“You can be lulled into sleep by looking at recordable incident rates from a
limited data set.”
He doubts that there has been much
of a slippage in safety from the operators who voluntarily report their incident
rates. In Leimkuhler’s opinion, these
organizations are likely to have mature,
experienced health, safety, and environment organizations. This is reﬂected in
their performance and reporting culture.

Chief Operating Officer Steven Newman
calls Next Steps “the most important
activity” in 2008 in terms of company
culture. More than $20 million was
budgeted for Next Steps training for
selected rig personnel worldwide.
Oil and gas companies examine the
safety reputation of drilling contractors
and service companies when deciding whether to award a job. In some
cases, safety performance incentives are
included in contracts.
Moore said incentives can raise the
safety profile, but he believes that care has
to be taken as to how the incentives are

“For the [Gulf of Mexico], Shell actually had our best year of safety statistics
in 2007,” Leimkuhler said. “Our drilling activity level was pretty consistent,
maybe even up a little from 2006, and
it’s certainly up in 2008. The challenge
for us as an industry is to celebrate and
acknowledge our success in HSE but at
the same time maintain ‘a healthy uneasiness.’ The risks are always there; it is the
nature of the forces and pressure we deal
with in well operations. We do an excellent job of managing those risks, but we
cannot afford to ever become complacent
or satisﬁed.”

managed and how they are measured.
Leimkuhler said Shell’s contract safety
performance incentives are set up so the
reward goes directly to the rig crews
through the contractors payroll system.
Shell monitors each rig’s performance on
a regional as well as global basis.
“If you have an incident of noncompliance related to operations—
whether you have a reportable spill or
you have a reportable incident with
somebody getting hurt—any one of
those incidents, you lose 50% of your
bonus. You have two, you lose it all.

As part of Transocean’s
drive for an incident-free
workplace, Hudson wants everybody on all 138 Transocean rigs and onshore facilities
to work in the same direction
toward the same objectives.
Transocean has incorporated environmental management along with safety
management in every jobplanning process. Hudson
called the process “a transformation toward thinking
about how daily jobs might
pose risks to the environment
along with risks to personnel.”
“Rig supervisors think
about ways a person can get
injured,” Hudson said. “Planners also are asked to think
about substance containment
and ways such substances
may be lost to the environment. We have prompts along
the way that are basically trying to increase an individual’s
hazard awareness.”
During 2007, Transocean

“Leimkuhler monitors reporting rates for both actual

is when recordable incidents

IHS: Past hurricane damage, disruptions less than expected
Despite massive damage from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, the
average impact on oil and gas production from hurricanes over a 45-year
period was relatively modest, and the
disruption of production was typically
short-lived, said officials at Engelwood,
Colo.-based information firm IHS Inc.
Based on IHS production data from
1960 through 2005, including Katrina,
Rita, and four other major hurricanes
in the last decade, an average Gulf of
Mexico hurricane season would likely
disrupt only 1.4% of annual oil production and 1.3% of annual gas production, the firm said. “While Hurricanes
Katrina and Rita were an exception,
historically, our data shows the overall impact to be much less than most
people might expect,” said Steve Trammel, an IHS senior product manager.

Focus on planning
Trammel attributes the historically
low impact on production to industry
planning. “The oil and gas companies
are very focused on the safety of their
personnel,” he said. “Operators make
the decision to pull crews off rigs well
before a storm moves into the gulf.
Therefore, most disruptions to production are caused by suspension of
operations as a safety precaution in the
event that an approaching hurricane
does threaten offshore production. As
a result, average hurricane disruptions
are short-lived with full production reestablished within a month,” he said.
Hurricane Katrina, a Category 5
storm, achieved 175 mph winds before
it dropped to Category 3 and struck
Louisiana Aug. 29, 2005, making it
the most destructive storm in terms of
economic impact ever to hit the US.
Hurricane Rita struck the Texas coast
Sept. 24, 2005, as a Category 3 storm
having achieved sustained winds of 180
mph. Some 3,050 or 75% of offshore
platforms, 22,000 miles or 67% of
pipelines, and two thirds of the Gulf

Coast refineries were in the overlapping
paths. Their combined force inflicted
record damage on Gulf Coast facilities and
production, pushing oil and gas prices
to record levels by January 2006 and increasing fears of energy supply shortages.
Yet all personnel were safely evacuated from a total of 748 manned platforms (93% of the manned platforms
at that time) and 101 working rigs
(75% of the rigs operating in the gulf
at that time). There were no oil spills
from production wells on federal leases
in the gulf and only minimal leakage
from platform equipment and damaged
pipelines. There was no evidence any of
that leakage reached shore or impacted
birds or mammals.
By mid-December 2005, the cumulative oil shut in by the two storms
totaled 101.7 million bbl, 18.5% of
annual gulf oil production. Shut-in
natural gas production totaled 526.2
bcf, 14.4% of yearly gulf gas output.
Of the other four major hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, most of
the production shut in by Hurricanes
Opal (1995), Georges (1998), and Lili
(2002) was restored within a month,
said Trammel, although Hurricane Ivan
(2004) disrupted 471 million bbl of oil
production and 140 bcf of gas production.

Expected 2008 activity
The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Climate Prediction Center expects considerable hurricane activity in the Atlantic Basin in
2008 with a 90% chance of an abovenormal season. The center’s outlook is
for a 60-70% chance of 12-16 named
storms, including 6-9 hurricanes and
2-5 major hurricanes (in category 3,
4, or 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale).
The center defines an average season as
yielding 11 named storms, including 6
hurricanes and 2 major storms.
In response to the increase in major
hurricanes striking the gulf in recent

years, Trammel said, the petroleum industry has improved evacuation plans as
well as shut-in and restart procedures to
ensure safety and to mitigate leaks and
production loss.
“Within economic limits,” he said,
“offshore structures are being engineered to withstand Category 5 hurricanes. In addition, the US Minerals
Management Service has mandated new
design specs for offshore facilities and
has issued a series of notices to lessees
and operators for rig fitness requirements, platform tie-downs, and ocean
current monitoring, which are all tied
to hurricane season.”
Current gulf production and infrastructure are more widespread than in
the past. Consequently, there is greater
risk that hurricanes entering the gulf
will damage and curtail the critical exploration and production activities.
IHS production data show the US
gulf produced 476 million bbl of oil,
or 25% of total US production, and 2.8
tcf of gas, about 12% of the US total
during 2007. Moreover, the deepwater
gulf continues to yield world-class oil
and gas discoveries. IHS data indicate
gulf discoveries yielded 8.5 billion boe
during 2000-07. As a result, the US gulf
was the seventh leading world source
for discoveries during this period. Currently, there are 3,639 producing oil
wells in the US sector of the gulf, and
3,788 gas wells, according to IHS data.

Noted improvements
Improvements and upgrades instituted by MMS in cooperation with industry groups and the American Petroleum
Institute after Katrina and Rita included:
• Installation of global positioning
system locators and black box information storage systems on offshore rigs for
monitoring site conditions after evacuation of personnel and to track the rig if
it drifts from its position.
• Guidance for assessing existing
structures for vulnerabilities and apply-

Lieberman-Warner cloture vote falls short; bill pulled
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The US Senate’s long-awaited debate
on global climate change ended June
6—not with a bang but with a whimper (see Editorial, p.21).
Environment and Public Works
Committee Chairwoman Barbara Boxer
(D-Calif.) brought the bill to the Senate floor on June 2, but Democrats
withdrew it after a cloture vote fell 12
votes short of the 60 votes needed to
limit debate. Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman
(I-Conn.) and John W. Warner (R-Va.)
originally introduced the measure, S.
3036, on Oct. 18, 2007.
Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (DNev.) filed an amendment tree, which
limited the number of changes that
could be made to the bill, and filed for
cloture on June 4.
Following 3 days of debate in which
Democrats accused Republicans of
delays and Republicans charged Demo-

crats with trying to keep additional
amendments from being introduced, 48
senators voted to invoke cloture, while
36 opposed the motion.
“We saw this morning yet another
example of Bush-McCain Republicans
refusing to address one of the most
important issues of our time,” said Reid
after the vote. He said Democrats will
continue fighting to cut carbon emissions, create green jobs, and end US
dependence on foreign oil.
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell
(R-Ky.) countered, “The majority says
climate change is the most important
issue facing the planet. Yet they’ve
rushed the debate on that topic and
brought the bill to a premature end.
They brought it down before we could
vote on [gasoline] prices, on clean
energy technology, or on protecting
American jobs.”

A 2009 return likely
Democrats produced letters from the

two major parties’ presumptive presidential nominees, John McCain (R-Ariz.)
and Barack Obama (D-Ill.) saying they
would have supported cloture had they
been present. The support signals that
global climate change will be addressed
legislatively in 2009 and will get a more
hospitable White House reception than
President George W. Bush gave this bill,
which he threatened to veto.
Boxer said June 6 that statements of
support for the cloture motion were
received from four other absent senators—Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.),
Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-RI), Hillary R.
Clinton (D-NY), and Norm Coleman
(R-Minn.).
But James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), the
Environment and Public Works Committee’s ranking minority member, said
S. 3036 was “one of the largest bills
ever considered by this Congress and
probably the largest nonappropriations
bill the Senate has ever considered. It
deserved a full and honest debate, with

Democrats failed to achieve the three-ﬁfths
majority necessary to limit debate for a
second time in less than a week.
The Senate rejected, by 51 to 43 votes,
a cloture motion on S. 3044, which also
would have made it possible for the Department of Justice to prosecute foreign

oil producing nations for violating US
antitrust laws.
Mary L. Landrieu (La.) was the single
Democrat to cast a nay vote on cloture.
Voting aye were Republicans Norm
Coleman (Minn.), Susan F. Collins (Me.),
Charles E. Grassley (Iowa), Gordon H.
Smith (Ore.), Olympia J. Snowe (Me.),
John W. Warner (Va.), and Independents
Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.) and Bernard Sanders (Vt.).
Debate ﬁrmly followed party lines as
Democrats called for stronger govern-

ment efforts to make major oil companies
and foreign oil suppliers bear more of the
burden of higher oil prices. Republicans
said that the bill’s provisions were not
realistic and would not lead to production
of any more oil or gas.
The Senate also rejected a cloture
motion to consider HR 6049, which was
designed to extend ﬁnancial incentives
for alternative and renewable energy
research and projects that are due to
expire later this year, by 50 to 44 in a
later vote.

amendments offered and voted upon,”
Inhofe said following the bill’s withdrawal.
Debate began amicably on June 2
when the Senate agreed by 74 to 14
votes to take up the bill. Boxer said she
had added a deficit reduction trust and
almost $1 trillion in tax relief to offset
the initial increases in energy costs
that would have resulted. She said S.
3036 was not a tax bill but a measure
modeled on earlier acid rain legislation where the polluter paid. “Let’s start
debating this bill,” she urged.

Broader debate sought
Republicans requested at least 30 hr
of general debate before taking up any
amendments. The public didn’t understand what the measure would do, which
made a broader debate necessary, suggested Bob Corker (R-Tenn.). After Boxer
and other Democrats called this a delaying
tactic, Republicans responded by requesting that the more than 500-page bill be
read aloud. They also said that they had
several amendments to propose.
“These petty, partisan tactics waste
the American people’s time,” Reid said
on June 4. “Ignoring the crisis of global
warming endangers all of us. The
longer we wait to act, the more costly
it will be and the greater the risk that
we won’t be able to undo the damage.
Each day that Republicans delay costs
American taxpayers billions of dollars
and squanders an opportunity to create
millions of good-paying jobs,” he said.
Inhofe responded that it was disingenuous to say Reid filed the amendment tree because McConnell raised
questions about federal judicial nominations. “The majority brought this
climate tax bill to the floor, and if they
are serious about the issue, they will
allow an open debate on amendments.”
Inhofe said. “Let us offer, debate, and
vote on amendments.”
Republicans and Democrats disagreed on the bill’s costs, and Boxer and
other supporters accused opponents of
resorting to scare tactics. Assistant majority Leader Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.)
on June 5 accused the minority of fearing change. “They are afraid of change.

CFTC feeling
new pressure

A

s the US Senate prepared to
debate its latest oil tax bill on
June 10, many members of Congress
opened fire on so-called Big Oil, their
target whenever retail gasoline prices
soar and voters start to complain.
But energy politics acquired a new
dimension the past few months as
House and Senate members started
to blame market speculators as well.
So Walter L. Lukken, the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission’s acting
chairman, can be forgiven if he feels
that he’s also under the gun.
His nomination as CFTC chairman
could be in trouble. Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-ND), who compares loosely
regulated commodity exchanges to
gambling casinos, announced that he
would oppose. He said Lukken has not
kept oil market speculators in line.
That same day, Sens. Olympia J.
Snowe (R-Me.), Dianne Feinstein

‘Cooperation and coordination’

On June 10-11, the CFTC brought
senior enforcement officials from
other countries’ commodity-market
regulatory agencies to Washington for
its second annual antimanipulation
conference. “Since no global regulator
exists, it is critical that the international
sister agencies continue cooperation
and coordination to ensure market
integrity,” CFTC Enforcement Director
Gregory Mocek said.
But the agency’s most significant
move may have been on May 29 when
it disclosed that its enforcement division has been investigating crude oil
and derivatives markets since December. It also said overseas commodities
regulators could require fuller disclosures.
Several congressional critics weren’t
satisfied. “The CFTC has not proposed

IEA again cuts 2008 oil product demand outlook
The International Energy Agency
has cut its outlook for 2008 oil product demand to an average 86.8 million
b/d, a reduction of 80,000 b/d from
the agency’s previous forecast. This puts
worldwide product demand growth for
this year at 800,000 b/d.
The new estimate follows the reduction of price subsidies in several
countries, including India, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and Taiwan.
In its latest monthly Oil Market
Report, IEA says that speculators have
been involved in crude’s price jump to
near $140/bbl, but this trading activity

back into play as an oil-price driver.
“Although discussions will focus

on whether or not a supply disruption is a likely outcome, from a market
perspective, there is also another supply
response to consider: an IEA strategic
stock release,” the report said. “Given
that OPEC countries are running close
to flat out, the market can take comfort
that the IEA is watching developments
very closely and is prepared to act
quickly if necessary,” EIA said.
“But $140/bbl is not just about
geopolitical risks—the supply situation
remains tight,” IEA said, adding that
these abnormally high prices are largely
explained by fundamentals. Supply
growth so far this year has been poor,
and higher prices are needed to choke
demand to balance the market.
Oil stocks in countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development slid 8.1 million bbl
in April, a month in which inventories

typically build.
The Paris-based agency’s figures
show that global oil supply rebounded
490,000 b/d in May to average 86.6
million b/d, lifted by higher OPEC crude
supply. The rise comes after extensive
downward revisions to first-quarter
2008 non-OPEC production and projected lower biofuels and NGL output for
the rest of this year, though. Despite this,
IEA forecasts a recovery in non-OPEC
output for this year’s second half.
OPEC’s higher output and field commissioning delays have pushed effective
spare capacity below 2 million b/d for
the first time since third quarter 2006,
according to IEA, as current installed
OPEC crude production capacity is assessed at 34.97 million b/d. The call on
OPEC crude and stock change in 2008
has been revised up 300,000 b/d to
31.6 million b/d in this report. ✦

Total: World oil output to reach 95 million b/d by 2020
Doris Leblond
OGJ Correspondent
Worldwide oil production will
stabilize at about 95 million b/d before
2020, including extra heavy crude from
Venezuela and Canada, said Total SA
Chief Executive Officer Christophe de
Margerie based on a long-term, internal
company oil study, just released.
Energy savings and efficiency are
therefore “absolutely necessary” to limit
an ever-increasing demand pulled along
by emerging countries and transport
with an ever stronger focus on light
products, the study said.
A further 5 million b/d might be

added with products processed from
biofuels, gas-to-liquids and coal-to-liquids, condensates, LPG, and the addition
of refining gains, raising to 100 million
b/d the overall oil supply to which the
world will have to adapt within the
time frame, the study said.
“A very ambitious plateau, which
will be difficult to uphold,” De Margerie said.
Jean-Jacques Mosconi, Total’s head of
strategy and economic intelligence, said
the 116 million b/d supply assumption
by 2030 given out by the International
Energy Agency is “too optimistic.”
Total’s scenario was revealed at a
seminar for the press held to deliver the

message Total was anxious to impart
that energy development and the environment are inextricably linked.
De Margerie said it was production
and not reserves that are failing, production limited by both geological and
geopolitical uncertainties that are slowing
down the development of new capacities.
Mosconi said the world’s remaining
known oil reserves amount to 1,000
billion bbl, as much as has already been
produced, with 60% of conventional
reserves concentrated in the Middle
East. He added that there are 200 billion
bbl still to be discovered and potentially
300 billion bbl more reserves if recovery rates are increased to 37% from

the current 32%. To gradually bring
these oil resources into production,
more cutting-edge technology will be
required as well as higher investments,
he insisted.
Total’s “energy vision” is that by
2030 the share of fossil energies in the

energy mix would still be about 75%.
While in 2005 energy fossils accounted
for 81% of the mix—of which 35%
was for oil and 21% for gas—by 2030
oil will account for 30% and gas for
22%. Coal, nuclear, hydro, biofuels,
biomass outside biofuels, and renew-

ables will account for the rest.
In a short reference to natural gas,
Mosconi indicated that resources “are
very abundant” and concentrated in
Russia and the Middle East. The growth
of gas production, however, will rely on
the development of LNG projects. ✦

Survey shows perceived pros, cons of Alberta oil sands
Both Canadians and Americans
consider Alberta oil sands to be a secure
oil supply, said results of a Canadian-US
survey by Fleishman-Hilliard Inc.
Executives of the public relations
firm released the survey results June 11
during a Canadian American Business
Council meeting in Washington, DC.
Cross-border differences were most
evident when survey respondents
ranked the importance of environmental concerns about oil sands compared
with the importance of oil sands potential as a secure North American oil
supply.
Canadian respondents split almost
equally regarding economic and environmental concerns. The survey showed
46% ranked environmental concerns as
the most important while 43% ranked
secure supply as most important.
Of American respondents, 55% listed
a secure supply as being their most
important concern while 33% listed
environmental concerns.
For both countries, the remaining
respondents said neither was the most
important or that they didn’t know.

• When asked if future oil sands development was a “good or bad thing,”
75% of Canadians and 68% of Americans said “a good thing.”
• When asked how important the Alberta oil sands are to the overall security
of the North American energy supply,

83% of Americans and 73% of Canadians said it was important.
• When asked if Alberta oil sands are
critical for dealing with North American dependence on foreign oil, 40% of
Americans agreed compared with 26%
of Canadians. ✦

Little relief
for tankers

O

il tankers plying the high seas
are unlikely to benefit much
from the recently passed UN Security
Council resolution 1816 (200). Why
not? As we suggested several weeks
ago, other countries around the globe
saw the resolution—sponsored by the
US, France, Britain, and Panama—as
opening the way to interventionist
policies (OGJ, May 12, 2008, p. 36).
Under terms of the resolution,
which was unanimously adopted on
June 2, the Security Council decided
that the states cooperating with
Somalia’s transitional government
would be allowed, for a period of 6
months, to enter the country’s territorial waters and use “all necessary
means” to repress acts of piracy and
armed robbery at sea in a manner
consistent with relevant provisions of
international law.

repression of piracy and armed robbery at sea. Actions envisaged in the
resolution should only apply to the
territorial waters of Somalia, based
upon that country’s prior consent.
Other nations had similar views.
Speaking after the vote, Vietnam’s
representative said the resolution
should not be interpreted as allowing any actions in the maritime areas
other than Somalia’s or under conditions contrary to international law
and the Law of the Sea Convention.

Not Yemen or...

So there is no provision in this
new resolution for countries to do
anything about attacks elsewhere. So
last week’s killing of one Nigerian
naval officer and the wounding of
four other people off Nigeria will
just have to go unpunished—at least
as far as this resolution is concerned.

But gas prices in the Atlantic Basin
are likely to soar and become more volatile because of increased gas demand
and larger connectivity between the
Americas and the European gas markets.
“European gas importers and
governments should more explicitly
consider the globalizing nature and
interdependency of their regional gas
markets,” the Booz report said. ✦

France supporting nuclear
power in Italy, France
Eric Watkins
Senior Correspondent
French President Nicolas Sarkozy
said his country is willing to work
with Italy on nuclear power as part of a
common energy strategy in response to
high oil prices.
Sarkozy’s comments, which came
after a meeting with Italian Prime
Minister Silvio Berlusconi, coincided
with ongoing public protests in France
and Spain over the high cost of fuel for
homes and transportation.
The French president’s remarks followed reports last week that the Italian
government, seeking to reverse the
results of a 20-year-old referendum,
wants to begin construction of nuclear
power stations to reduce the country’s
dependence on imported oil and gas.
“During the term of this parliament we will lay the first stone for the
construction in our country of a group
of new-generation nuclear power stations,” said Economic Development
Minister Claudia Scajola.
“We can no longer avoid an action
plan for a return to nuclear power,” Scajola told the Italian employers’ federation Confindustria.
The announcement by Scajola appears to reverse the results of a 1987
referendum that renounced nuclear
power generation and closed the

country’s four nuclear plants. The referendum followed the Apr. 26, 1986,
nuclear disaster in Chernobyl, Ukraine.
Confindustria head Emma Marcegaglia agreed with the government
decision, saying the time has come
“to invest in nuclear energy,” as Italy
has become too dependent on foreign
energy sources.
Fulvio Conti, head of Italy’s principal
power group Enel, also agreed, saying
his company was “technically ready” to
take part in the initiative.
“It’s a good start on the part of the
government, which confirms the need

to diversify (energy) sources and to
invest in infrastructure,” he told state
news agency Ansa. The Italian government, either directly or indirectly, has a
30% stake in Enel.
Speaking in April at an International
Energy Forum in Rome, Conti said Italy,
which generates around 60% of its
energy from gas, was “too dependent”
on foreign imports.
At the forum, Conti said it would
likely take 7-10 years for a new nuclear
generator to come online: 7 years on an
already licensed site or 10 years on a site

where construction was not yet licensed.
If the government proceeds with its
plans, Enel is thought likely to begin
construction at Montalto di Castro,
where it initiated construction on two
pressure water reactors in the 1980s.
Although the Montalto facility was
partially dismantled after the 1987 referendum, Enel still owns the site.
Environmental groups in Italy immediately attacked any plan to bring
back nuclear power. Giuseppe Onufrio,
a director of Greenpeace Italy, called
the announcement “a declaration of
war.” ✦

the oil discovery on ultradeepwater
Block BM-S-8
south of Rio de
Janeiro.
And Petrobras
as sole concessionaire made the
light oil discovery
on a group of
blocks designated BM-S-40 in the far
southern part of the basin.

Santos oil discoveries added

Ultradeepwater ﬁnd
Operator Petrobras said it proved the
presence of oil in presalt reservoirs on
the ultradeepwater block after drilling
well 1-BRSA-532A-SPS (1-SPS-52A).
Preliminary analyses indicate an oil
gravity of 25-28°, comparable to that of
other presalt crudes found in the basin,
the company said in a release. The wildcat is 250 km off the state of Sao Paulo

in 2,139 m of water.
Drilling was completed May 18 to
TD 6,773 m, and the discovery proved
via oil sampling in reservoirs nearly
6,000 m deep. Press reports said a
shortage of rigs and the press of block
expiration deadlines has led Petrobras to
forgo testing some of its subsalt discoveries in order to release the rigs to drill
other blocks.
The consortium is preparing a
discovery assessment plan to be sent to
Brazil’s National Petroleum Agency.
Petrobras deferred tests at the discovery on BM-S-8, also known as the
Bem-te-Vi block, to move the rig to the
small Iara block to the northeast in the
company’s Santos basin subsalt focus
area. Kicking off optimism for the potential of the Santos subsalt area was the
Tupi discovery, where Petrobras plans
to begin extended production tests in
March 2009.

Light oil discovery
Meanwhile, Petrobras said it found
36° gravity oil above the salt at the
1-BRSA-607-SPS (1-SPS-56) well.
The company estimated that the well,
with a reservoir at 2,080 m in 235 m of
water, is capable of a production rate of

Santa Barbara
On Jan. 28, 1969, an event on Union
Oil’s Alpha platform in the Santa Barbara Channel permanently changed the oil
and gas industry. While tripping pipe
out of the hole from a depth of 3,500
ft, Well A-21 blew out.1 The subsequent
oil spill and ecological disaster sent
tremors through the industry that are
still being felt today. Few events prior
to this date have had such far-reaching
consequences for the industry.
Following the Santa Barbara Channel
blowout, the Railroad Commission of
Texas held hearings in Austin to determine what measures, if any, should be
adopted to prevent a similar occurrence
in Texas.
There were several points of failure
that contributed to the Santa Barbara
Channel blowout. One of the factors
discussed at the hearings concerned the
amount of casing that was set. Union
Oil had been granted an exemption by
the US Geological Survey that allowed
the company to set less casing than was
required by federal standards.

10% case
exemption

Operators can plan surface
casing for safer well control

Exemptions to
casing standards
are not uncommon
and there was some
testimony at the
hearings on this issue. The consensus
opinion was that allowing an amount
of surface casing equal to 10% of the
proposed total vertical depth of a well is
reasonable.
Although there are many wells in
which 10% surface casing will provide
an ample safety factor insofar as well
control is concerned, it is certainly
not adequate in all situations. Each
well must be considered to determine
whether minimal casing is appropriate. Therefore, one must examine the
wellbore dynamics that occur when a
kick takes place.

into the wellbore and enable other formations to feed into the wellbore.
3. Sands containing usable quality water and productive formations not covered
by surface casing could be damaged.

4. Possible extension of the fracture
to the surface, compromising the safety
of drilling operations and causing ecological damage, as in the Santa Barbara
Channel event.

A practical example
appears in the accompanying box.
Obviously, serious
well control problems
can occur if it is believed that the 8,000-ft
well in this example
is capable of withstanding a 2-ppg kick
(EMW shoe test – mud
weight). That assumption is incorrect by a
factor of 10.
Simply stated, the
casing seat kick tolerance on a well having
10% surface casing is
10% of the difference
between the EMW
shoe test and the mud
weight at total vertical
depth, if the kick occurs
at total vertical depth.
It is worth noting that
if the casing seat in
this example had been
tested to 13 ppg, the
kick tolerance would
increase from 0.2 ppg
to 0.3 ppg.
The accompanying table shows various combinations of criteria and the
kick tolerance associated with each situation if the kick occurs at total vertical
depth. Increasing the amount of surface
casing clearly increases the casing seat

StatoilHydro assays
Snohvit condensate

StatoilHydro recently
conducted an assay of
the Snohvit condensate,
which is associated with
the Snohvit gas field in
Refining
the Norwegian Barents
Sea (Fig. 1) that started
production in August 2007.
The gas processing plant at the Hammerfest LNG plant in northern Norway
received gas from Snohvit field on
Aug. 21, 2007 (OGJ, Aug. 27, 2007,
p. 10). Production, however, was
delayed due to unexpected repairs
to leaks in the cooling system (OGJ,
Feb. 4, 2008, p. 10).
StatoilHydro estimates that there
is 113 million bbl of recoverable
condensate. StatoilHydro will market a
total of 4 billion cu m/year of gas at the
field’s full capacity (OGJ, Mar. 3, 2008,
p. 11).
Interests in the project are operator
Statoil with 33.53%, Petoro SA 30%,
Total E&P Norge 18.4%, Gaz de France
12%, Amerada Hess Norge 3.26%, and
RWE Dea Norge 2.81%.
Fig. 2 shows a simulated distillation by gas chromatograph curve for
the whole crude. These data are from
StatoilHydro.

INTEGRITY
MANAGEMENT—
Conclusion

A simple economic
procedure applied to NGL
pipelines can help operators determine—based on
the type, shape, and position of any abnormalities
Pipelines
detected during periodic
magnetic-flux leakage
pigging— whether to shut the pipeline
for repair or continue operations.
The first
part of two
articles (OGJ,
June 9, 2008,
p. 80) described the
three steps of
this procedure:
• Identification. A magnetic-flux leakage intelligent pig report and ultrasonic
Scan B testing located the defect.
• Quantification. Ultrasonic thickness
measurement and Scan B results use
gammagraphic inspection to determine
the defect’s size and location on the
pipe wall.
• Assessment. A simple finite-element
analysis model simulates the real defect
and then corroborates results against
API Recommended Practice 579 Fitness
for Service, January 2000.

Procedure, FEA apply to NGL
ﬁtness-for-service assessment
Fernando Vicente
Eduardo Risso
ABB Full Service
Neuquen, Argentina

This concluding article applies the
procedure and FEA directly to a fitnessfor-service assessment.

FEA
The procedure next performed a
simple linear elastic FEA on the pipeline defect zone based on different load
scenarios (OGJ, June 9, 2008, p. 81,
Table 1). The FEA consists of various
steps:
• Model creation.
• Definition of material properties.
• Model FE discretization.
• Definition of input boundary
conditions.
• Graphical results display.
A pipeline quarter model used the
symmetry of the section and elastic
shell element because it is suitable for
analyzing characteristics of thin material. A rectangular area with dimensions quantified during non destructive
inspection modeled the damaged zone.
The next step introduced material
properties, FE discretization, load, and
input boundary conditions. Material
properties used in linear elastic analysis
included: the Young Modulus, 2.1 ×
106 kg/sq cm for carbon steel; Poisson
coefficient, 0.29; specified minimum

yield strength, 448 MPa; and specified ultimate tensile strength, 531 MPa.
Testing applied different values of
internal pressure to the pipeline model
(Fig. 1).
The hoop stress on the defect zone
increased to 2,849 kg/sq cm from
2,129 kg/sq cm when the pipeline was
under normal operating conditions.
Linear elastic analysis yielded similar
graphical results for different internal pressures. Table 1 summarizes FEA
results.
Internal pressure creates pipeline
wall stresses in both longitudinal and
circumferential (hoop stress, Sx and Sy)
directions. Circumferential stress generally measures twice the longitudinal
stress. Hoop stress formulas indicated in
ASME Code B31.4, Para. 404.1.2 (Barlow’s equation modified for pipelines)
guide pipeline design and wall thickness.1
Equation 1 calculates the internal
design pressure known as maximum
steady-state operating pressure of the
NGL pipeline according to B31.4 ASME
Code. Hydrostatic pressure tests performed at 131.4 MPa (1.25 × MSSOP)
assumed a pipeline wall free of defects,
consistent with code requirements. This
variance required revision of all cases
in Table 1, comparing the hoop stress
from FEA on the damaged zone with
allowable stress according to B31.4 and
flow stress in an effort to determine if
the pipeline could still be safely operated at various pressure levels.
Graphic comparison of the hoop
stress on the damaged pipeline segment
and design-code criteria helped understanding of the real state of the pipeline
wall at various working pressures (Fig.
2).

New version of structural modeling software

New mobile solar power generator

New software helps improve seismic interpretation

GeoSec 2D Version 5.2 is a new edition
of geologic interpretation software for
advanced structural analysis, cross-section
construction, and forward modeling.
The firm says this new version improves
accuracy and efficiency and minimizes risk
in exploration and production projects
through advanced interoperability, new
structural tools, and enhanced usability.
Version 5.2 builds on the ability of the
GeoSec 2D software suite, a multifaceted
structural analysis solution that provides
critical information about the geometry
and structural history of the subsurface.
The software incorporates capabilities such
as geologic section construction, balancing, restoration, animation tools, and
embedded gridding and contouring. These
functions work together to create models
that incorporate structural features resulting from deformation of the subsurface.

A new mobile solar power generator travels to any location and provides
temporary power where grid power isn’t
available.
The maker says its system is suited for
use where solar alone is insufficient.
Because the unit is portable and can
travel to any location, it provides maximum reliability at an optimum cost with
minimal maintenance, the firm says.
This new solar generator will provide
from 100 to 1,000 w of continuous power
at 12, 24, or 48 v DC or 120 v AC.
Uses for this system include communications, radio, repeaters, instrumentation,
remote monitoring, security and access
control, and emergency disaster relieve
or any other application where power is
unavailable.

Insight Earth, a new suite of interpretation software, leverages this firm’s
integrated technologies—automated fault
extraction, surface wrapping, and domain
transformation—to help improve geoscientists’ seismic interpretation results.
Insight Earth provides differentiating
tools that help improve 3D visualization
and interpretation, enabling geoscientists to do true volume interpretation of
structure and stratigraphy. Each component of the software supports, informs,
and enhances the others throughout the
interpretation work flow, which speeds up
the entire process and increases the overall
quality of the analysis and interpretation
results, the firm notes
Insight Earth simultaneously renders
more than four volumes with various attributes, automatically picking horizons and
faults—all in true 3D space.

Elements of oil
price relief are
falling into place*
Except for that pesky asterisk, elements
of relief from painfully high oil prices are
falling into place.
The asterisk points to a footnote that
must accompany all market forecasts—the
one repeated so often it begins to lose attention. So here it is: *
Relief from stressful oil prices requires
changes not only in basic forces of the
market but also in extraordinary factors

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

pushing up the price of crude.
In the former category, relaxation of
worldwide oil demand seems ﬁnally at
hand.
Consumption has quit rising in the
industrialized world. But it continues to
grow elsewhere, especially in rapidly growing countries where government subsidies
shield oil consumers from price hikes.
Governments, though, are yielding to
the strain. Indonesia, Malaysia, and India
are among countries that have announced
politically difﬁcult increases in the prices
of oil products. China is so far retaining
price controls but reimbursing state-owned
oil companies in an apparent attempt to
prevent shortage during this summer’s
Olympic Games in Beijing.
As those moves slow demand growth,
new supply should emerge from oil ﬁelds
due on stream this year in major producing
countries, although a pattern of delays in
large projects has become as relentless as
depletion.
One of the extraordinary forces lifting
oil prices seems to have changed course.
The US dollar already was strengthening when Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke on Jan. 3 hinted at a conference
in Barcelona that monetary policy would be
more attentive than it has been lately to the
greenback’s value.
Many analysts think a weak dollar, partly
the result of the Federal Reserve’s antirecessionary lowering of interest rates, has
boosted the price of oil.
And at some point the recently strong
investment tilt toward commodities will
ease as allure returns to other types of
assets. That tilt, too, has raised oil to some
degree.
These developments are ingredients for
oil prices lower than they have been. But
don’t overlook the footnote.
*Forecasts for lower oil prices assume
the absence of major disruption, political or
natural, to oil supply. In the Gulf of Mexico,
lest anyone forget, hurricane season has
begun.

Crude prices make record leap
In the biggest one-day gain ever, the July contract for benchmark US light, sweet
crudes shot to a record high of $139.12/bbl in intraday trading June 6 on the New
York Mercantile Exchange before closing at a record $134.54/bbl, up a whopping
$10.75 for the day.
Nervous traders attributed that jump to a statement by Israel’s Transport Minister
Shaul Mofaz that Israel will attack if Iran continues a program for developing nuclear
weapons. But the crude contract had escalated more than $5/bbl June 5 when JeanClaude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, said the bank might raise its
interest rates.
Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland, blamed Trichet for triggering “a
$16/bbl rally in slightly more than 24 hr.” By setting in motion the biggest 2-day gain
ever on NYMEX, Jakob said, “Trichet has managed what no war, no hurricanes, no
OPEC [member] has ever managed to do.” He said, “Oil fundamentals had recently
started to reassert themselves with worries about demand destruction, but Trichet
chased them away and re-invited ﬁnancials to the party. The underlying oil fundamentals are, however, unchanged.”
The June 2-6 trading week had started with crude futures in a downward corrective phase “but reversed course violently when Trichet shocked the ﬁnancial system
by pointing to an interest rate hike in July,” Jakob said. When the dust cleared,
benchmark US crude gained a total of $11.19/bbl for the week. North Sea Brent was
up $9.91/bbl overall. Heating oil escalated by $12.90/bbl, and reformulated blend
stock for oxygenate blending (RBOB) increased by $8.40/bbl.
When the benchmark crude price was below $125/bbl, Jakob said, “Demand destruction was not evidenced at $80/bbl [or] $100/bbl, but it is now.” In May, the frontmonth crude “traded only a few days above $130/bbl, which means that the breaking
point for the subsidized oil economies was before that level” he said.
Malaysia and India joined the list of emerging countries cutting fuel subsidies for
their national markets. Subsidy cuts in 2008 represent 9.8 million b/d of oil demand
or a third of the world oil demand growth estimated by the International Energy
Agency, Jakob said. IEA’s forecast of global demand growth in 2008 was “already
half what it was at the start of the year, and the trend is to head into one of the lowest [levels of] yearly demand growth of the decade,” he said.
Political pressure
High oil prices have triggered a policy shift in the US with lawmakers pressing for
a change in futures market regulation. Potential changes by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission can have as much effect on oil prices as any decisions by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Jakob said.
US Rep. Bart Stupak (D.-Mich.) claimed some US trading houses have been
manipulating energy futures markets, although a government investigation has not
uncovered any illegal activity. Investment banks denied those charges. Stupak chairs
the subcommittee on oversight and investigations under the House energy committee.
Jakob said Stupak’s charge “was purely a public relation exercise to sponsor his
antispeculation bill, but the risk from all this agitation from lawmakers is still to push
for a CFTC reclassiﬁcation of ‘speculators’ as well as a change of policy on limit
waivers. Perversely, this might push some pension funds to buy before they are potentially not allowed to do it anymore, and we continue to witness an increase in the
California Public Employees’ Retirement System’s [one of the largest US institutional
investors] allocation to inﬂation assets since the pressure on the CFTC started to
develop. Meantime banks buying commodities will state that they are not speculating but simply hedging Trichet.”
Earlier, George Soros, a ﬁnancial speculator, testiﬁed before the US Senate
Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, about the impact of ﬁnancial
“bubbles” on oil markets after ﬁrst warning senators, “I am not an expert in oil markets.” Soros is best known for “breaking the Bank of England” on “Black Wednesday”
in 1992 when he sold short some $10 billion in English pounds after the bank failed
to raise its interest rates to the level of other European Exchange Rate Mechanism
countries or to ﬂoat its currency. The bank was forced to devalue the pound sterling,
and Soros made an estimated $1.1 billion on his transactions.
Paul Horsnell, Barclays Capital Inc., London, said, “Congress must now be close
to running out of room to conduct commodity bubble hearings. At the current rate of
growth, a quick calculation reveals that by the end of the year, 2 out of 3 Americans
will have given congressional testimony about commodities bubbles.”

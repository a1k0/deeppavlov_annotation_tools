CONDENSATE EAST OF SUEZ:
NGL and its Naphtha Impacts in
Asia Pacific and Mideast Gulf
Condensate and the Light-End Products Squeeze
By Asia Paciﬁc Energy Consulting

• This is the “deﬁnitive” report on
condensate in the fastest growing,
critical regions of the world, Asia
Paciﬁc and the Mideast Gulf.

Condensate coming into its own
Condensate, one of the two groups
deﬁned as Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs),
is ﬁnally coming of age in world trade,
marketing, reﬁning and petrochemicals. Condensate sales are moving
from a niche marketing specialty to
a mainstream segment of crude and
products trade, and nowhere is this
more evident than in the Mideast Gulf
and Asia Paciﬁc.
This report explains how the protean
nature of condensate allows it to be
used in a wide range of sectors: as a
reﬁnery slate component; in specialized distillation towers called condensate splitters; in direct feed to ethylene crackers; in gasoline blending and
as a substitute for gas in turbine power generation. It can be deﬁned as a
base material, a blending component,
a feedstock or a boiler feed.

The GENESISTM Catalyst System

Maximize yield with
Grace Davison’s
GENESIS FCC catalyst.
Most refiners need flexible catalyst systems that allow them to
take advantage of changing economic scenarios. Grace Davison
delivers this flexibility with the GENESIS catalyst system. GENESIS catalysts
provide a means to maximize yield potential through optimization of discrete
cracking catalyst functionality. GENESIS catalysts are a blend of two catalyst
types. The key component is MIDAS, which maximizes conversion of bottoms
and improves coke selectivity by eliminating coke precursors. The other
GENESIS component is most often an IMPACT catalyst. The inclusion of
IMPACT provides critical zeolite surface area and activity as well as superior
coke and gas selectivity in a broad range of applications, from severely
hydrotreated gasoils to heavy resid feeds.
GENESIS catalysts demonstrate a true yield synergy with a superior
coke to bottoms relationship than either component alone. The synergy
exists because each component cracks specific feed species.

GENESIS catalyst provides
the ultimate in formulation
and FCC operational flexibility.

Senate Republicans pressed to support bill
Democratic leaders in both houses of the US Congress used
record-high crude oil prices to press Senate Republicans to back a
House-approved bill that would shift $18 billion in tax breaks from
major oil companies to alternative and renewable energy projects.
Responding to news Mar. 3 that crude oil prices reached
$103.95/bbl, breaking a record set in 1980 when adjusted for inflation, Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) said: “As
oil prices reach record highs in a weakening economy, Democrats
remain committed to repealing Big Oil’s tax breaks and instead use
that money to expand incentives for investing in energy-efficient
vehicles and renewable energy.
“Bush Republicans blocked our efforts to do so last year, but
we will soon give them another chance to help lower prices at the
pump and reduce our reliance on oil,” he continued.
In the House, which passed H.R. 5351 by 236 to 182 votes
largely along party lines Feb. 27, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)
said that Americans are paying the price for years of a failed energy
policy that has resulted in heavy reliance on imported oil and a
growing threat from global warming in addition to record energy
costs.
After Democrats assumed control of Congress in January 2007,
she said, federal lawmakers enacted the first motor fuel economy
increase in 32 years; dramatically boosted efficiency standards for
buildings, lighting, and appliances; and invested in domestic biofuels. “This year, we again seek to repeal billions of dollars in unnecessary subsidies given to Big Oil at a time of record profits and
invest these savings in clean, renewable energy initiatives that will
create good-paying green jobs,” Pelosi said.
She and Reid urged President George W. Bush to drop his opposition to the measure, which he has said he would veto because
it is aimed at increasing taxes in a single industry.

Chavez warns of war plans with Colombia
Oil production in Venezuela and Ecuador are not under any
threat despite rising tensions with their neighbor Columbia, according to oil ministers from both countries.
Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Rafael Ramirez said his
country’s oil industry infrastructure “has been protected for some
time now” and that the country is “ready to protect” itself.
Ecuador’s Oil Minister Galo Chiriboga said his country’s oil output would not be affected by recent military movements in the
region.
Both Venezuela and Ecuador have sent troops to their respective
borders with Colombia in response to Colombia’s killing of a top
rebel leader on Ecuadorian soil on Mar. 1.
Earlier,Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez warned that his coun-

try and Ecuador could go to war with Colombia over the military
incursion into Ecuador by Colombian forces that killed Raul Reyes,
the second most senior rebel commander for the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
Colombian authorities said Reyes and 16 other guerrillas were
killed in a raid on a FARC camp 1.8 km inside Ecuador’s border
with Colombia. Documents recovered from Reyes’ captured laptop computer showed Chavez’s administration recently paid $300
million to the rebels, while high-level meetings had been held between rebels and Ecuadorian officials, Colombian officials said.
“We don’t want a war... (but) if we have to give (a war), we
will, and it will be in Colombia,” said Chavez during a nationally
broadcast radio and television show.
Ecuador “will always count on Venezuela for anything under
any circumstance,” said Chavez, who ordered Venezuelan troops to
his country’s border with Colombia.
Columbia justified the raid on grounds that the Colombian rebels were using Ecuador as a base to attack their homeland and that
Venezuela had provided financial and military support.
“We cannot allow terrorists who seek refuge in other countries
to spill the blood of our countrymen,” said Columbian President
Alvaro Uribe, who added: “We are not warmongers, but we are
not weak.”
US President George W. Bush backed Colombia, accusing Chavez
of provocative maneuvers and warning he opposed any act of aggression in the region. For his part, Chavez says Uribe is a pawn in
a US plot to invade Venezuela, the No. 4 oil supplier to the US.

European unbundling discussed at EU meeting
At a meeting of European Union Energy Ministers in Brussels
Feb. 28, the Slovene presidency accepted an unbundling option
proposed by Germany, France, and six other EU members. The unbundling initiative had been introduced as an alternative to the
Energy Commission’s two options to separate energy production
from distribution networks in order to obtain a truly competitive
European integrated energy market.
There will be further discussions on the matter before the end
of June. France assumes the presidency of the EU July 1.
The Commission wanted the total breakup of fully vertically
integrated gas and electricity utilities but proposed a complicated
alternative that eight opponents rejected. It posed that ownership
of production and transport networks be retained but that the assets be managed by a fully independent body.
Their third option was to set up the conditions for an “effective
and efficient” dissociation between energy producers and transporters while maintaining ownership.
While France’s Energy Minister Jean-Louis Borloo was celebrating “a psychological victory” because the third option had been

retained for discussion, Germany’s E.On AG was pulling the carpet from under the discussions by setting up a precedent for full
unbundling: It was offering to sell its electricity grid to a fully
independent buyer, a move rejected by German Chancellor Angela
Merkel as likely to weaken the position of Germany and France.
A number of observers noted that, while it was possible to
give up ownership of electricity networks, giving up ownership
of gaslines would destroy the value of a company such as Gaz de
France and involve questions of national security, as a company
such as Gazprom is known to be ready to acquire networks that
would appear on an open market.

Sakhalin-2 partners seek swifter ﬁnancing
Sakhalin Energy, operator of the Sakhalin-2 gas and oil project,
reported it is no longer seeking loans from the US Export-Import
Bank or the UK’s Export Credits Guarantee Department due to possible delays on loan decisions.
A Sakhalin Energy spokesman said Ex-Im Bank might require
lengthy consultations over the loans, but that the project’s tight

Exploration

start-up and operating schedule dictated the need to seek a swifter
financing decision, not environmental or political concerns.
Sakhalin Energy, which needs a reported $5 billion for project
financing, will continue to hold discussions with other potential
creditors such as the Japanese Bank for International Cooperation
and major commercial banks.
Phase 2 construction of the Sakhalin-2 project is nearing completion with some 90% of work already accomplished. The company hopes to finish the second phase by yearend and start production of LNG shortly after.
The company’s work plan this year includes starting of drilling
at platform Piltun-Astokhskoye-B and start-up of the Molikpaq tiein modules to establish year-round production of oil.
Also in the plan for this year are continued drilling at gas platform Lunskoye-A; commissioning the OPF to receive hydrocarbons
from all three offshore platforms; completion of the onshore pipelines and booster Station 2 construction; and the commissioning of
Trains 1 and 2 of the LNG gasification plant. ✦

ExxonMobil to explore block off Libya
ExxonMobil Corp. will shoot seismic surveys and drill an exploration well under a production-sharing agreement with National
Oil Corp. (NOC) of Libya covering offshore Area 21.
NOC said ExxonMobil agreed to acquire 4,000 line-km of 2D
seismic data and 2,000 sq km of 3D data under a $97 million work
commitment. It also will fund training or scholarships during the
exploration period and improve schools in Libya.
Area 21 encompasses four blocks covering a total of 2.5 million
acres in the Sirte basin 110 miles offshore. It is adjacent to the east
of Area 20, for which ExxonMobil also holds a production-sharing
agreement (OGJ, Feb. 12, 2007, Newsletter).

in Gabon under its redevelopment program and expects oil recovery to improve to 23% from 13%.
The redevelopment will cost $2 billion for additional proved
and probable reserves of about 150 million bbl, with production
peaking at more than 30,000 b/d in 2013-14.
The Total unit said production is expected to increase in 2008,
with operating costs falling by refocusing operations onshore.
Under the first phase of redevelopment, associated surface facilities will be debottlenecked, and Total will increase the number
of drainage points, in particular in the northern part of the field,
and boost well productivity by hydraulic fracturing and massive
waterfloods.
“Running from 2009 to 2011, Phase 2 entails installing new
offshore infrastructure and decommissioning obsolete process
units, building an onshore plant (power generation, fluid treatment, gas compression) and drilling an additional 30 or so wells,”
Total added.
The Anguille redevelopment is an important project to eliminate wasteful gas flaring in the country by 2011, as well as coastal
discharges of production water.
Anguille lies 20 km off Port-Gentil in 30 m of water in the
Grand Anguille Marine concession, which is wholly owned by Total Gabon.
Discovered in 1962, Anguille came on stream in 1966 and produced 7,500 b/d in 2007 prior to redevelopment.

There is roughly 40.58 tcf of undiscovered natural gas, 1.02
billion bbl of natural gas liquids, and 1.26 billion bbl of oil in the
Permian basin, the US Geological Survey said.
Most of the gas (about 35.38 tcf) and gas liquids (about 785
million bbl) is in unconventional formations in the Delaware and
Midland basins, USGS said in a publication released on Mar. 1.
“Given that few wells have produced from these assessment units,
there is significant geological uncertainty in these estimates,” the
agency said.
The remaining crude is more evenly divided between an estimated 747 million bbl of conventional resources and 510 million
bbl from unconventional deposits, the report said.

Pemex to boost output in Cantarell ﬁeld
Average output at Mexico’s Cantarell oil field will decline by as
much as 20% this year as the field matures, a Petroleos Mexicanos
executive reported.
Carlos Morales Gil, Pemex exploration and production director,
said the state firm will reverse the decline when the company installs new production equipment at the field. The energy ministry
has said investment in Cantarell would reach $5 billion this year.
Morales said output at Cantarell will range from 1.2-1.3 million
b/d this year, compared with an average of 1.5 million in 2007.
According to figures published by the energy ministry, Cantarell’s output had already slipped to 1.27 million b/d in January,
down some 230,000 b/d from the 1.6 million b/d in January
2007.
In fourth-quarter 2007 Pemex drilled five new development
wells at Cantarell and repaired nine major wells and 10 smaller
wells. During first-quarter 2008, the company plans to complete a
nitrogen recovery unit in the field.
Despite Cantarell’s decline, Morales said the company will produce an average 3.1 million b/d this year, the same as in 2007, as
other fields compensate for declines at Cantarell.
Morales acknowledged that the decline in Cantarell’s production is forcing Pemex to move into more difficult production zones
on land and in deeper waters in the Gulf of Mexico.
Much of the company’s new drilling is at the Tertiary Gulf Oil
project in the northern states of Veracruz and Puebla, where output rose to 41,000 b/d by yearend 2007. By 2015, Pemex hopes
production in the region will rise to nearly 600,000 b/d following
investments now pegged at $1.7 billion.
Pemex also hopes to boost output at Ku-Maloob-Zaap offshore
field, in which seven new wells were completed and a new production platform installed by yearend 2007. Pemex also plans
to begin construction of the Maloob C drilling platform in early
2008.

According to the US Energy Information Administration, Yemen’s total oil production in 2006 was about 380,000 b/d, down
from 400,000 b/d in 2005.
Citing Yemen’s Petroleum Exploration and Production Authority (PEPA), EIA said the decrease is due to declining production in
Masila and Marib, the country’s two largest basins.
EIA’s Short-Term Energy Outlook currently projects oil production of 360,000 b/d for 2007 and 350,000 b/d in 2008.
Minister Bahah’s upbeat remarks coincided with statements by
Austria’s OMV AG that it plans to drill new 40 oil wells by 2010
in Yemen’s S2 block (Al Uqlah) in the Armah district of Shabwa
governorate.
OMV aims to increase its production to more than 30,000 b/d,
said the firm’s in-country director during a meeting with Shabwa
Gov. Mohammed Shamlan.
Last year, OMV AG announced that it began production of
1,000 b/d of oil from its Kharwah-1 well on Block S2 and that
it plans to deliver 11,000 b/d of oil by 2008 (OGJ, Jan. 8, 2007,
Newsletter).
Interest holders in Block S2 are OMV (Yemen Block S2) Exploration GMBH 44%, Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production Corp. 37.5%, Yemen General Corp. for Oil & Gas
12.5%, and Yemen Resources Ltd. 6%.

EOG to start Horn River gas production
EOG Resources Inc. expects to begin natural gas production in
June from British Columbia’s Horn River basin.
The Houston independent estimates initial production potential
from the basin to be 3.5-5 MMcfd.
EOG has accumulated leaseholds on 140,000 net acres near
British Columbia’s northern boundary. Production is expected to
be ramped up significantly starting in 2010, EOG executives told
analysts during a Feb. 27 conference call.

US drilling slips 8 units
Yemen to raise oil production by 2010
Yemen plans to increase its oil production to 500,000 b/d by
2010 from the current 317,000 b/d, according to the country’s oil
minister, Khaled Bahah.
“The current oil production decreased from 438,000 b/d in
2002 to 317,000 b/d in 2007,” he said, adding that his country is
looking to increase production by selling new licenses as well as by
improving output at existing sites.

US drilling activity slipped to 1,763 rotary rigs the week ended
Feb. 29, 8 less than the previous week but up from 1,752 during
the same period last year, said Baker Hughes Inc.
All of the latest loss was in land operations, down 13 units to
1,681 working. US offshore drilling increased by 4 to 59, including 58 in the Gulf of Mexico. Inland waters gained 1 rotary rig to

Mexico’s CFE gets LNG bids for new terminal
Mexico’s Comision Federal de Electricidad said it has received
bids from three consortia to receive, store, and regasify LNG at the
new terminal at the Port of Manzanillo on the country’s Pacific
Coast.
One bid was tendered by Energia Occidente de Mexico, a consortium of Canada’s TransCanada, Argentina’s Techint, and Belgium’s Tractebel.
The second bid was tendered by Terminal KMS de GNL, a consortium of Japan’s Mitsui and South Korea’s Samsung and Korea
Gas Corp.
The third bid was filed by the consortium Controladora LNG
Manzanillo, formed by Spain’s Iberdrola, Mexico’s ICA, and Japan’s
Tokyo Gas and IHI.
After starting at 90 Mcfd in 2011, supply will be scaled up to
500 Mcfd by 2015 at increments of 180 Mcfd, 360 Mcfd, and 400
Mcfd. The gas from Manzanillo will feed the new 3 Gw capacity
CFE intends to install in the region.
CFE, which will announce its decision on Mar. 10, awarded
Repsol Comercializadora de Gas a 15-year, $15 billion contract in
September 2007 to supply the Manzanillo terminal with Peruvian
gas.

Inpex considers Darwin LNG landfall
Japanese company Inpex Australia is considering Darwin as
an optional site for its proposed LNG plant, which will use gas
feedstock from its Ichthys field in the Browse basin off Western
Australia (OGJ Online, Feb. 2, 2007).
Inpex also is considering a larger plant for a Darwin operation,
although it has not specified the precise size.
The company and partner Total SA have a preferred site on the
Maret Islands off the Kimberley coast of Western Australia that
calls for a two-train LNG plant for a total 7.6 million tonne/year
output.
However, that site is facing increasing opposition from green
groups and a drawn-out approvals process from Western Australian authorities.
In addition, Australia’s federal and state (Western Australia)
governments are considering the sanction of just one commonuser LNG hub on the Kimberley coast for all Browse basin gas
fields.
Inpex said its original schedule to produce its first LNG shipments by 2012 will be delayed as the company reviews its project
budget and development program.
The company recently signed a project facilitation agreement
with Northern Territory under which the joint venture will take
a considered look at the Middle Arm Peninsula near Darwin as a
potential LNG site.
The NT government is keen to have the project and says the
agreement ensures that a whole-of-government approach is taken

to the development of Ichthys. This includes facilitating necessary environmental and planning approvals, provision of land at
Middle Arm, and port access.
The company is now undertaking a range of technical and
engineering studies to fully assess the Darwin option to compare
it with the Maret proposal.
One difficulty is the length of pipeline required for a Northern
Territory landfall.
An Ichthys-to-Darwin pipeline would be 850 km compared
with an Ichthys-to-Maret line of 190 km.
Inpex has a 76% interest, and Total holds the remaining
24%.

Consultant forecasts tighter 2008 tanker market
McQuilling Services LLC expects a rebound in both tanker spot
rates and time-charter revenues during 2008, with demand outpacing supply in most sectors. McQuilling’s annual Tanker Market
Outlook doesn’t anticipate much growth in demand, but instead
sees the market tightening due to accelerated exits from the fleet
for conversion.
Beyond 2008, McQuilling expects the tanker market to
weaken as surplus tonnage grows. Strength once anticipated
post-2010, driven by the scheduled phase-out of single-hull
vessels by that year, has disappeared on a combination of asset
owners’ converting these vessels early and a 600,000 b/d softening in global oil demand growth for 2010 compared with last
year’s projections.
McQuilling also anticipates double-digit tonnage supply increases in 2009.
For 2008, however, McQuilling expects demand for crude
and dirty products tonnage to grow 1.2-4.1%, depending on the
vessel sector, with 3.3% demand growth expected for very large
crude carriers (VLCCs) in 2008 vs. no growth in 2007. VLCCs
(265,000 dwt) operating on AG-Far East routes drew world-scale
spot rates of 72 in 2007. McQuilling expects this level to continue on average through 2012, but with a 2008 spike up to WS
85. Other tanker segments will follow a similar spot-rate pattern,
according to McQuilling.
For time-charter equivalent daily revenue, McQuilling expects
VLCC’s, which earned $39,800/day in 2007, to peak this year at
$51,400/day before slipping to an average of $38,300 through
2012. This stands in contrast, however, to McQuilling’s revenue
forecast for the balance of the tanker market, which calls for a
steady decline from 2007 through the end of the forecast period
in 2012.
Suezmax (130,000 dwt) vessels operating between West Africa and the US Atlantic Coast, for example, earned $39,100/
day in 2007 but are expected to earn $37,700/day this year and
$31,000/day through 2012. ✦

The Energy Independence and Security Act requires 15 billion gal of corn
ethanol in 2016. Using an average corn
yield of 147 bushels/acre (the average over the 6-year period 2002-07),
we find 41 million acres would have to
be devoted to corn production for fuel
ethanol. These 15 billion gal of ethanol
would displace just 245 million bbl of
reformulated gasoline—just 7.2% of
year 2007 gasoline consumption. This
hardly qualifies as ending our dependence on foreign oil.
Ethanol production is currently
much above the previous legislative
mandate. Energy Information Administration data show that year 2007 fuel
ethanol production should total about
6.5 billion gal. The new energy bill will
therefore require 8.5 billion gal of additional ethanol by 2016. This production
will necessitate converting 23 million
additional acres to corn production. The
table summarizes acreage data for corn,
soybeans, and wheat for the period
2003-07.
Between 2006 and 2007, corn acreage increased about 15 million acres.
This clearly came at the expense of
soybean acreage, which decreased by 12
million acres. Not surprisingly, the price
of soybeans closed at $12.10/bushel
on Jan. 29, compared to $6.85/bushel
a year ago. In her TV commercials in
California, Hillary Clinton is telling
people they should not have to pay $3/
gal for gasoline. Thanks to Congress and
the ethanol mandate, the price of eggs
has increased from $1.10/dozen a year
ago to $1.43/dozen today. She has been
strangely silent on the increase in food
prices.
Average per-capita gasoline consumption over the 6-year period
2001–06 is 11.24 bbl/year. The new
energy bill raises the corporate average fuel economy standards in 2012. In
my judgment, it is far from clear what
effect this will have on US gasoline
consumption, but I suspect it is going
to be considerably less than its supporters hope. In any event, it will have very
little effect by 2016. Let’s assume percapita consumption remains constant

at 11.24 bbl/year. Estimating the US
population in 2016 is difficult because
we don’t know what the level of immigration will be.
My estimate is 327.6 million.
(The resident population on July 1,
2007, was 301.6 million). The Census
Bureau’s projection for 2016 is 324.8
million. However, this was made in
March 2004 before the recent surge
in immigration. If per-capita gasoline
consumption remains constant, US gasoline consumption in 2016 will be 3.682
billion bbl, compared to 3.394 billion
bbl in 2007. Thus, gasoline consumption
will increase by 288 million bbl. The 8.5

This growth in GHG emissions will
be accompanied by a gradual decrease
in the absorption of carbon by US
forests and agricultural lands, the study
said. Carbon absorption will decrease
to 1 gigaton/year in 2030 from 1.1
gigatons/year in 2005.
Interestingly, carbon absorption from
forests and US lands had been rising for
50 years, in contrast to some developing countries. According to the study,
net annual carbon absorption has risen
by 25% since 1990, primarily due to
greater accumulation of carbon in existing forests and some forestation.
The net effect is that US emissions in
2030 will exceed GHG reduction targets
outlined in climate change bills currently
before Congress by 3.5-5.2 gigatons.

The EISA effect
A champion of last year’s energy bill reads too
much into a revision by the Energy Information
Administration of its long-term outlook for US
energy. The Energy Independence and Security Act
of 2007 (EISA) is still a bad law.
Whatever benefits EISA might achieve by
toughening fuel-economy standards for new
vehicles it will more than offset by hiking the renewable fuel standard to high, possibly unfeasible
levels. Expanding the costly mandate for ethanol
and biodiesel was a mistake for which Americans
who don’t grow or distill corn for a living will pay
for many years. Maybe that’s why lawmakers feel
compelled to cheer anything that seems to make
EISA look otherwise.

inefficiencies introduced by the new law. “Caruso
noted,” Bingaman’s statement says, “that because
of EISA: Net imports of crude oil and refined
petroleum products are expected to decline from
60% in 2006 to 51% in 2022; inflation-adjusted
prices for oil, natural gas, and coal are expected
to be lower in 2030 than they are today...total domestic energy demand is expected to increase by
about 24% through 2030, but the pre-EISA figure
was closer to 31%; and energy-related emissions
of CO2 are forecast to grow by 25% from 2006 to
2030, down from pre-EISA’s prediction of a 35%
increase.”

Iran’s gasoline shortage and its growing dependency on imports have been
the subject of discussion and debate,
both in and outside Iran. The problem,
which began after the 1980-88 IranIraq war, has worsened. Its resolution
has become more difficult because
successive postwar administrations have
failed to address the issue boldly and
decisively.
Today, the
gasoline shortage
and the estimated $40 billion/
year subsidy that
the government
pays for this and
other fuels is
a huge economic burden to the state.
Because of Iran’s controversial stance on
certain international political issues, it
also has become an important national
security concern.
Recognizing the gravity of the situation, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad recently launched an initiative that
raised the price of gasoline and, for
the first time, introduced an elaborate
rationing system.
This article will describe the background of the problem, the deterioration in Iran’s gasoline prices relative

to international prices of gasoline and
crude oil, the huge losses borne by the
National Iranian Oil Co. (NIOC) in its
downstream operations, and the persistent public expectations for the government to provide cheap fuel despite
these heavy losses.
The article also evaluates the recently
adopted rationing scheme, its efficacy
and chances of success as a long-term
policy measure to resolve current problems and pave the way for the eventual
privatization of NIOC’s downstream
operations.
In addition to decreasing demand,
Iran also is intensifying efforts to boost
its own output of gasoline and other
fuels through a major refinery expansion and modification program.

Iran’s gasoline problem

Iran’s refining capacity has not kept
pace with rapidly growing demand, and
this imbalance has necessitated a rapid
surge in gasoline imports (Table 1). This
has created a huge financial burden on
the state and jeopardizes the national
security of the country by making
it vulnerable to import disruptions.
Ahmadinejad’s initiative aims to address
these concerns.
Ahmadinejad has acted much more
boldly than his predecessors. His

ever, it falls short of being a long-term
solution to a perennial problem that has
dogged every administration since the
1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
Reﬁning Report
The key factors contributing to Iran’s
gasoline problem are the government’s
ownership of downstream assets and
its intervention in a process that should
function through free market mechanisms rather than by state controls and
government fiat.
Iran is not unique in this respect. In
almost all OPEC countries, government
ownership of energy-related assets and
intervention in markets are prevalent,

gasoline was lowered to 6 rials. Although there is no convincing evidence
that the assassination was in any way
related to the gasoline price increase,
some believe it has contributed to the
succeeding governments’ hesitation to
raise gasoline prices adequately.

‘Cheap’ gasoline?
Although a large percentage of the
driving population in Iran is of the
post-revolutionary period, the “cheap”
gasoline era of the 1960s and 1970s
still evokes nostalgia in the minds of
many.
The “cheap” gasoline price of that
era is often mentioned in discussions
criticizing the government’s energy
policy. However, gasoline at 6 rials/l.
or at 10 rials/l. for a subsequently
introduced higher octane grade called
“Super”—about 23 rials/gal in the
1960s—was not really cheap, being
either close to or surpassing international prices. At the then-prevailing 70
rials-to-$1 exchange rate, 23 rials/gal
translated to $0.33/gal.
The average retail gasoline price
in the US at the time was about
$0.25-0.30/gal—substantially lower
than in Iran.
Today, gasoline prices in the US are
the lowest among all industrial countries, including Canada, which is a
major oil exporter, and yet the current
1,000 rials/l. in Iran is only a small
fraction of the current US prices.
In the 1960s, crude was around
$1.60/bbl. At about $0.33/gal or
24

$13.86/bbl, the retail gasoline price in
Iran in the 1960s was about nine times
the price of crude oil.
At today’s exchange rate of about
9,300 rials to $1 and the crude oil price
at $85/bbl, a retail gasoline price at
even 4,900 rials/l. (five times the 1,000
rial price that has been in effect since
April 2007) would cover only the opportunity cost of the crude, still leaving
NIOC to absorb refining, distribution,
and sales costs. Iran’s domestic gasoline

some of them.
Obviously, this subsidy trend is not
sustainable. Most observers believe the
government will be forced to follow a
free market model in pricing its gasoline and other petroleum products and
gradually phase out its subsidy program. Procrastination—as has happened
in the past—would only make the task
of tackling this problem progressively
more difficult.

ration allowances for varied types of vehicles and uses—ranging from 100 l./
month for private cars to 800 l./month
for taxis.
By adding the rationing system to
the price increase, the government in
effect seemed to concede that it doesn’t
have confidence in the demand-reduction impact of the price increase alone,
and its hope of reducing demand rests
largely on the rationing scheme.
The initiative triggered unrest on
a small scale initially and resulted in
some gas stations being set on fire, but
it seems now to be firmly in place and
fully implemented.
The goal of the combined price increase and rationing is to reduce gasoline consumption to about 39 million
l./day from 75 million l./day—a 47%
26

reduction. According to some sources,
gasoline demand has declined nearly
20%, resulting in a decline in imports
of 50% and an almost complete halt to
smuggling to neighboring countries.
There is a degree of skepticism
among analysts and other observers as
to the plan’s long-term prospects for
success, however. Most believe the issues surrounding fuels such as gasoline,
heating oil, and natural gas, which
enjoy huge subsidies, are not resolved.
Rather than opting for large, systematic
price increases that would reduce consumption and bring the domestic price
of gasoline closer to international levels
and that would prepare the country
for the eventual privatization of downstream operations, the government
opted primarily for a rationing method

that has been tried many times in
other parts of the world and has almost
always failed to achieve a long-lasting,
tangible result.
Ahmadinejad, however, reportedly
favors a combination of a relatively
small price increase—small compared
to what is needed—and adoption of a
strict rationing scheme for two reasons. First, he believes that too large
an increase in price would be not only
inflationary but also unfair to the lowincome and middle classes. Second, he
considers rationing a “catch-all” device
that distributes the pain and hardship
equally and fairly to all consumers.
Many experts, however, argue that
rationing is a form of “command and
control,” which requires a huge bureaucracy. Rationing, they say, almost always

fails to achieve its goals, including those
of fairness and benign inflation. Even if
it initially succeeds on a limited basis,
success will be short-lived. Moreover,
rationing, by its nature, carries a huge
stigma because its adoption signifies
the failure of or lack of trust in marketbased measures. Free markets provide
competitive prices, which in turn signal
to the decision-makers how to utilize
their resources in the most efficient
and optimal manner. Interventions and
rationings, on the other hand, result in
distortion of these signals and thus in
wasteful decisions.
Critics also expect the rationing plan
to fail because it is prone to manipulation, cheating, and the emergence of
black markets, despite its high administrative cost. In fact anecdotal evidence
suggests that black markets have
already emerged, and cheating and
abuses of the system are abundant.
Whether the government will be able
to prevent these abuses by adding
new features to its smart cards is not
yet clear. But it is obvious that if the
rationing system is not followed up
by rapid price increases and a gradual
phasing out of the subsidy system,
abuses are certain to continue or even
worsen.
Ironically the flaw in the rationing
system that allows smart-card holders
to cheat and sell part of their ration
in the black markets has inadvertently
produced a positive result and indirectly helped to enhance the scheme’s
effectiveness. Paradoxically, this occurs
because the cheating by smart-card
holders introduces some elements of
the free market incentives to the rationing scheme.
Even though the 25% increase in
price may not generate enough incentives for conservation, the opportunity
to sell part of the ration at much higher
prices (reportedly at 6,000-11,000
rials/l.) on the black markets not only
raises the overall average price of gasoline but also gives the card holder incentive to conserve and sell the unused
portion of his ration in the black market. Forgoing the opportunity to make

better opportunity for profit.

other consumers to adjust more gradually to the higher prices. Within a few

countries with gasoline prices below
those in Iran—averaged 39.3% during
1990-2004.
The argument for fairness and affordability also collapses under close
examination. Fuels of all kinds are used
much more by affluent citizens than
by the poor or middle class. Therefore,
rich people are the biggest beneficiaries of the fuel subsidies. In an efficient
economy, the problems of fairness and
affordability are not tackled by market interference; they are remedied by
such measures as income subsidies or
tax relief. Thus markets are allowed to
function with minimum distortion and
government interference.
Finally, national ownership of an
industry’s production and operation
is almost certain to result in unrealistic public expectations. For example,
sharp increases in crude oil prices over
the last few years have actually raised
the amount of subsidies on gasoline
and other fuels because of higher opportunity costs of the crude oil used
in domestic refineries. Yet the public’s
expectations for subsidies have become even more extensive. They seem
to believe that when the government’s
revenue goes up as a result of higher
oil prices, so should the subsidies. Here
again, one can clearly see the disadvantages of a government being involved in
a business activity that should be owned
and operated by the private sector.

Prospects for success
If history is a guide, one must be
skeptical about the prospects of success
for Ahmadinejad’s plan. His approach
is bolder than others, which makes it
appear to have a better chance. But if
rationing fails in implementation, as
many observers and experts expect,
Ahmadinejad’s initiative will not significantly differ from those of previous
administrations.
Those who believe rationing is a
panacea would argue that the previous administrations failed because they
resorted only to price increases. But in
reality, their plans failed because their
price increases were insufficient, as is
the case with Ahmadinejad’s initiative.
Iran’s gasoline problem is deeply
entrenched in all aspects of its economy
and the life of its people. Left unchecked
for decades, the problem of cheap
gasoline and other fuels has become
institutionalized. As a result, any initiative by the government to truly stem the
problem will be extremely painful to
the consumer, unsettling for the general
economy, and risky for the government.
Some observes say Ahmadinejad
would have a greater chance of success
if he treated his rationing plan as a temporary measure, lowered his expectations for its success, completely precluded it from his long-term planning,
and pursued his demand-reduction
goals by resorting to price increases and
improvements in fuel efficiency. These

observers also believe his chances of
success would improve considerably
if he coupled his price increases with
a well planned and executed financial
assistance program to mitigate the
financial hardship of higher fuel prices
on low-income consumers.
Resolving the gasoline problem is a
major challenge that has defied the will
and wit of previous administrations.
Only time will tell if Ahmadinejad is the
man to succeed. ✦

US House passes latest oil-tax-for-alternatives bill
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The US House of Representatives
passed a bill Feb. 27 that proponents
said would shift $18 billion in tax
breaks from major oil companies to alternative and renewable energy projects
and conservation and energy efficiency
programs.
HR 5351, which passed by 236 to
182 votes, was approved largely along

party lines. Many Democrats tried to
emphasize the potential benefits of
alternative projects that might be cancelled if funding is not extended. Others in the party said crude oil prices,
which closed at $101/b/d earlier,
showed that oil companies don’t need
tax incentives.

‘Energy policy lite’
HR 5351 opponents, who were
largely Republicans, said the bill actu-

ally hurts some alternative energy
programs it intends to help while discriminating against a single industry by
excluding it from a tax break that other
US manufacturers receive.
“This bill is not a serious solution.
It is ‘energy policy lite,’ and it is clearly
intended to appeal more to the
blogosphere than to market forces,” said

the vote. “The Democrats’ solution to
America’s energy crisis is to single out
what they claim are the five largest oil
and gas producers for a tax increase.”
“This legislation is not likely to impact oil producers’ profits in any way....
It is also not limited to the five largest producers, as they claim,” English
continued. “The one thing you can be
sure of is that this bill will raise prices at
the pump for American consumers and
create a looming sense of uncertainty,
which will compound the forces increasing prices today in the marketplace.”

of its most successful consumers. H.R.
5351 also excludes Citgo Petroleum
Corp., the US subsidiary of Petroleos
de Venezuela SA, from removal of tax
incentives for other large oil refiners,
he charged. Finally, the bill repeals the
domestic manufacturing tax deduction
for US producers but allows all others
to continue receiving it, including some
foreign companies, he said.
“H.R. 5351 is simply not the answer.
It wasn’t in any of its three previous
incarnations, and it isn’t today. This legislation threatens America’s investment,
threatens Americans’ jobs, threatens the
American economy and puts the consumer at a disadvantage,” English said.
Rep. Sander M. Levin (D-Mich.),
another Ways and Means Committee
member, said none of English’s arguments could bear the weight of observation. “It is absolutely mysterious why,

Supreme Court hears Exxon Valdez punitive damages arguments
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The US Supreme Court heard arguments Feb. 27 over whether ExxonMobil Corp. should pay punitive damages

arising from the 1989 crude oil spill
into Alaska’s Prince William Sound from
its tanker, the Exxon Valdez.
The company already has paid a $25
million criminal penalty and earlier
agreed to pay $900 million over 10

years for environmental restoration.
The punitive damages case before the
high court arose from a separate action
in 1994 in which more than 32,000
plaintiffs, including commercial fishermen, private landowners, Alaskan

coming. The US House had just
passed its latest bill to deny financial
incentives to major oil companies
and use the money to fund alternative energy programs. Crude prices
were days away from breaking their
inflation-adjusted record as the
overall economy continued to slow
down.
So the Energy and Natural Resources Committee’s chief minority member sought time to make
Senate floor speeches on Feb. 28-29
to address a problem that has grown
increasingly political: the economic
consequences of allowing oil imports
to keep growing.
Domenici noted that experts
estimate that foreign oil will cost the
US $400 billion this year. He cited
National Defense Council Foundation
estimates that importing oil deprives
the US economy of more than 2.2
million jobs/year and creates another
$825 billion of hidden costs including oil-related defense outlays, lost
government revenues, and reduced
domestic investment.
“Nearly all of us, and nearly all
of our constituents, can agree that
America’s dependence on foreign oil
must end,” Domenici said.

Key element ignored
Domenici suggested that a strong
US energy policy would rely on
increasing domestic oil and gas
production responsibly; accelerating
research and development of alternative energy sources, and significantly
enhancing conservation.
There is broad agreement on the

ddiing thatt
increasing US oil and gas production
won’t solve problems by itself. “But
with proven reserves of more than 21
billion bbl of oil, and undiscovered
reserves of more than 100 billion
bbl, it is simply unacceptable that
America fail to meet a greater share
of our own needs with domestic
energy resources,” he said.

Counterproductive action
Raising US production involves
more than issuing leases in the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and
on more of the Outer Continental
Shelf, he said. It also means ending
counterproductive maneuvers such as
inserting drilling permit application
fees and an oil shale moratorium into
the omnibus appropriations bill late
last year.
In addition to the House’s latest
energy bill, Domenici said, “Some
in the majority seek to make it more
difficult for our military to purchase
unconventional fuels from our allies
in Canada...and to undo lease agreements that American companies have
to produce energy in the Gulf of
Mexico. This makes no sense.”
Instead, he said, it’s time to take
action on an aggressive agenda of
old and new energy ideas. “We must
recognize that reasonable policies to
reduce our dependence on foreign
oil are American ideas, not partisan
agendas. We must affirm that these
policies are worth pursuing because
additional steps can and should be
taken to reduce the amount of energy
this nation imports,” Domenici
said. ✦

Natives, and associated individuals and
businesses, sued the vessel’s captain,
Joseph J. Hazelwood, and ExxonMobil, the ship’s owner and Hazelwood’s
employer.
At that time a jury awarded the
plaintiffs $287 million in compensatory damages. It also assessed punitive
damages of $5,000 against Hazelwood
and $5 billion against ExxonMobil, saying that these awards were “necessary
in this case to achieve punishment and
deterrence.” The US Ninth Circuit Court
of Appeals affirmed the compensatory
damage award and the jury’s determination to award punitive damages but
reduced the punitive damages award to
$2.5 billion. ExxonMobil appealed to
the Supreme Court, which on Oct. 29,
2007, agreed to hear the case.
More than 300 people lined up
outside the court Feb. 27, hoping to be
admitted to watch the arguments. Many
were Alaskans who said damages from
the spill continue and are substantial.
Arguments before the court centered
on whether punitive damages are allowed under federal maritime law or
are preempted by the Clean Water Act.
They also discussed whether ExxonMobil could be held liable for continuing to employ Hazelwood as a tanker
captain when management had received
reports that his drinking problems had
returned.

‘Problem ran deeper’
Jeffrey L. Fisher, a partner in Davis
Wright Tremaine LLP’s Seattle office,
argued on behalf of the suit’s plaintiffs:
“The same district judge who heard the
criminal case sat on our trial. He saw
in that first case that the environment
was damaged and ruled that the limit
should be $25 million. He also found
that the captain and third mate were
negligent. It wasn’t until our trial that
it was shown the problem ran much
deeper, and the judge found that the
company was liable.”
But Walter Dellinger, a partner in
O’Melveny & Myers LLP’s Washington
office who spoke on ExxonMobil’s
behalf, said other federal laws preempt

assessing the company for punitive
damages. “The one thing that Congress
has done, whether in the Trans-Alaska
Pipeline Authorization Act of 1973, the
Clean Water Act in 1977, or the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, was to provide specific instead of open-ended remedies,”
he told the justices.
Dellinger maintained that the $3.4
billion that ExxonMobil has already
paid in fines, damage awards, and
cleanup and environmental restoration
costs addresses deterrence. There clearly
was no malicious intent by the company since the spill cost it so much money
and harmed its public image, Dellinger
said. “When you look to punishment,
it can’t be a black hole where limits to
damages disappear,” he said.
Fisher responded that Exxon did not
enforce its policy banning work aboard
its tankers by intoxicated employees.
“We showed 33 instances where other
employees drank with Hazelwood. For
3 years, Exxon received reports that this
was happening,” he said.
Dellinger said reckless hiring could

lead to corporate punitive damages if
management clearly knew an employee
was incompetent. “The jury could
have found this was the case. It also
could have found that Hazelwood had a
problem with alcohol and was getting
treatment,” he said.

Justices’ questions
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.
asked at what level an employee’s actions make a corporation liable. Fisher
said that Hazelwood qualified in this
instance because he had charge of
substantial property. Dellinger disputed
this because operating policies were established farther up in the organization
and Hazelwood simply was responsible
for carrying them out.
“It seems to me this captain was
managerial for some purposes and not
for others. But he was not authorized
to set aside the company’s policy not to
operate a vessel while intoxicated,” Associate Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said.
Associate Justice Stephen G. Breyer
asked if there were examples where

federal laws regarding managerial liability had changed. “When you deal
with multinational corporations which
have hundreds of divisions, you need to
be able to assign liability below the very
top management,” Fisher replied. Dellinger said it still is difficult to decide
what level of employee can implicate a
company.
Roberts said: “This was a very dramatic accident. But accidents happen
every day. If it has not been normal to
assign liability for an employee’s conduct under maritime law before now,
what basis exists to require it now?”
Fisher said that without a punitive
damage award, each plaintiff would
receive only $15,000 in compensatory
damages. Dellinger said that a punitive
damage total for billions of dollars was
the relevant issue.
Eight of the Supreme Court’s nine
members heard the arguments. Associate Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. recused
himself because he owns ExxonMobil
stock worth several hundred thousand
dollars. ✦

He said commercial oil production
at Vankor is expected to commence in
August, and construction of the 19-20

as 30 million tonnes of oil will be

Subsea market to remain strong, study says
The global subsea oil and gas market
will remain strong for the foreseeable
future and is forecast to total $218
billion over 2008-12, reports Scottish
Enterprise in a study to be released
shortly. This is despite a market growth
of nearly 90% during the past 5 years.
“The Subsea Market Report
2008-2012,” is one of a series of reports commissioned by Scottish Enterprise’s Energy Team from energy business analyst firm Douglas-Westwood.
“We expect that increasing global
energy demand coupled with high oil
price and the move to deeper waters
will drive subsea activity to new levels
in the years ahead,” said lead study analyst Thom Payne from Douglas-Westwood’s Aberdeen office. “Key regions
within the market are Africa, Latin
America, North America, and the North

for over 70% of the global subsea market in 2007.
“Further discoveries and developments in Brazilian deepwater plays will
continue to drive growth in the Latin
American market” over 2008-12, Payne
said. “Currently we expect that the
vast majority of Latin American spend
will be focused in this area, but uncertainties over future developments in
Mexico, such as Ku Mallob Zaap field,
could result in increased spend in this
area over the forecast period.”
Payne said the African subsea market

is
regions, with expenditures expected
to increase by 16% during 2008-12
“when spend will equal just over $11
billion.” Other major growth markets
will be Latin American and Asia.
“The Asian subsea market was valued
at $4.2 billion in 2007, and we expect
it to exceed $6 billion in 2012,” driven
by rising energy demand, Payne said.
The subsea market of regions such
as the Middle East and Russia will be
characterized primarily by export and
trunk lines linking them with consumer
markets in Asia and Europe. “We expect

that these developments will result in
the ‘rest of the world’ accounting for
14% of the 2008-12 market,” Payne
said. After 2012, he expects important
development in the Russian Arctic and
South Pars field off Iran to drive subsea

spend in those regions.
“The only thing that is stopping the
market [from] growing at a faster rate is
a global shortage of resources ranging
from deepwater drilling rigs to experienced engineers,” Payne said. ✦

Egypt’s gas production and exports
are building with the recent opening of
several pipelines, and BP PLC is sizing
up its first discovery of deep Oligocene
nonassociated gas offshore in the Nile
Delta.
The country’s mid-2007 internal estimate of gas reserves is 72 tcf, up 36%
from 2001, said Egyptian Natural Gas
Holding Co. (EGAS). Almost four-fifths
of the gas is in the
Mediterranean Sea.

Compressors generally fit into two
categories:
1. Positive displacement compressors
that include reciprocating, rotary screw,
sliding vane, liquid ring, and rotary lobe.
The compression principle is volumetric
displacement, in which reducing the gas
volume increases pressure.
2. Kinetic or dynamic compressors that include centrifugal and axial.
The compression principle is acceleration and deceleration of gas, in which
kinetic energy is converted to pressure
increase. Reciprocating and centrifugal
units are the most popular compressors
used in oil and gas field production applications.
Rotary screw compressors have
gained popularity for low to moderatepressure gas boosting, refrigeration
systems, and fuel-gas compression for

mance. The most
difficult part of a
compressor calculation, therefore,
is to specify a reasonable range for
each variable and
not the calculation
itself.
Maddox and
Lilly emphasize
that use of a single
value for each
variable is incorrect when evaluating a compression
system.2

Normally, an evaluator will make
thermodynamic calculations on an ideal
(reversible) process and then adapt
them to the real world by including an
efficiency term.
A compression process has three
ideal processes: isothermal, isentropic,
a polytropic. Any of these processes can
serve as a basis for evaluating compression power requirements by either
hand or computer calculations. The
isothermal process, however, seldom is
the basis because the normal industrial
compression process is not at constant
temperature, even approximately.
The compression ratio has a limited
practical range of between 2 and 6. The

reached the surge limit.
For the same case, Fig. 3b shows the
required power as a function of relative
density. Because the flow rate decreases
with decreasing relative density, the
required power also decreases. This
is consistent with Equations 1 and 2
because power is directly proportional
to flow rate.
Fig. 3c shows the variation of polytropic head as a function of inlet actual
volumetric flow rate. Note that this
figure indicates the influence of relative
densities on compressor performance.

Case 2
In the low-pressure compressor,
variable-speed case, as in Case 1, for
a fixed 700-kPa inlet pressure, 35º C.,
and mass flow rate of 1,000 kmol/hr,
the simulation varied feed-gas relative density from 0.60 to 0.80 in 0.05
increments.
To maintain the outlet pressure, the
simulation needed to vary compressor
speed. Fig. 2b shows the process flow.
Figs. 4a-4b shows the simulation results for 2.0 and 2.5 compression ratios.
In addition to the results with the PR
EOS, the diagram also shows the results
obtained with the Benedict-Webb-Rubin-Starling (BWRS) EOS.6
The difference in the results of these
two EOS methods is negligible.
As shown in Fig. 4a, as the relative density increases, the compressor
speed decreases. As relative density or
molecular weight increased, however,
the required power increased (Fig. 4b).
This is also consistent with Equation 2
in which power is directly proportional
to the average compressibility factor,
and the compressibility factor, in turn,
is proportional to the gas molecular
weight. Figs. 4c and 4d show that polytropic efficiency and head decrease with
relative density.

Case 3
In the intermediate-pressure compressor, variable-feed rate case, as in
Case 1, for a fixed 2,137-kPa inlet
pressure, 31.1 C. , and 9,402 rpm, the

sity from 0.60 to 0.80 in 0.05 increments. To maintain the outlet pressure,
the simulation varied the feed flow rate.
Fig. 2a shows the process flow.
Fig. 5 shows the simulation results
for 2.31 and 3.16 compression ratios.
Note that for the 3.16 compression
ratio and 0.60 relative density, the
simulation could not converge because
flow approached the surge limit. The
reference point at 0.72 relative density
in Fig 5 is from the compressor manufacturer’s actual test data. Note that the
computer simulated results matched
closely with the actual test data.

outer end of the cones is reinforced
with two rows of hard-alloy hemispherical teeth. The bit legs are protected by hard-facing on shirttail and the
leading edges and by rows of hemispherical tungsten carbide inserts that
act as roller gaugers. The sealed oil-filled

13-23 tonnes at 50-250 rpm.
The design of the 81⁄2-in. CH55MRS
bit was motivated by test results from

637Y) conducted in 2002 by the Almetyevskoye drilling department of Tatneft
OSC. Although test results were positive
(715 m in 65.1 hr at ROP 11 m/hr),
engineers observed premature wear of
the cone heel rows while the bit bearing remained in operable condition
(Fig. 2).
This wear pattern during drilling of
hard abrasive formations such as experienced in Tatarstan is common among
roller cone bits. Fig. 3 shows a dull bit

Global crude distillation capacity
will increase 10.6 million b/d during 2007-12—9.1 million b/d of new
capacity and 1.5 million b/d of capacity creep—according to a report from
the International Energy Agency (IEA)
entitled “Medium-Term Oil Market
Report.” The expansion in refining capacity will be in response to an increase
in oil demand of 9.6 million b/d by
2012.
IEA feels
that investment in
sophisticated refinery
capacity is
continuing
and it foresees significant improvement
in refinery flexibility despite project inflation and slippage similar to that seen
in the upstream sector.
Current refinery investment should
increase refiners’ ability to process
heavy, sour OPEC spare capacity that
was of little interest to them during the
past few years, IEA
feels. Refiners will
be able to upgrade
more fuel oil into
lighter transportation fuels, which
should improve
their ability to
meet demand
growth in gasoline
and diesel. But this
will affect prices
and price differentials.
If refiners can
more easily meet gasoline and diesel
demand, then the high differentials
to crude oil are likely to decrease, the
report said. Similarly, refiners’ ability
to upgrade the heavy end of the barrel
means that large discounts needed to
clear surplus fuel oil production will
disappear. Differentials between light,
sweet and heavy, sour crude should narrow, IEA said.
The potential for distillate markets
to ease during the next 5 years would
be insignificant compared to marine

bunker fuels switching from fuel oil to
distillate. This change would necessitate
additional investment in upgrading
capacity of more than that currently
forecast in the study.
IEA believes that recent imbalances
in product markets had a significant effect on oil market volatility and outright
prices. An easing of these imbalances
should therefore reduce one of the
price pressures that have existed for the
past few years. But it may be shortlived.
IEA’s product supply forecast depends on the assumption that many
large refining projects in the US will
be approved in the short term and
that high-cost projects slated to start
up closer to 2012 are not delayed. If
refining margins dip, projects with lead
times of 18 months to 3 years could be
delayed. These market dynamics suggest
that it is unlikely that the refining industry will return to a long-term era of
low refinery margins, according to IEA.

Demand
Global oil product demand will
increase 1.9 million b/d/year or 2.2%/
year on average, reaching 95.8 million
b/d by 2012, according to IEA. Growth
is due to stronger demand growth in
non-Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
countries, particularly in Asia and the
Middle East, where demand will grow
more than three times faster than OECD
countries.
IEA expects OECD oil product demand to increase 1.0%/year on average
(Fig. 1a) rising to 52.1 million b/d in
2012 from 49.6 million b/d in 2007
due to transportation fuel demand
growth in North America, where consumption will grow twice as fast as in
Europe or the Pacific. North America
will grow at 1.3%/year on average vs.
0.7%/year for Europe and 0.6%/year
for the Pacific. Consumption growth
will have different regional trends
(gasoline in North America, diesel in
Europe, and the Pacific more evenly
balanced).
North America will represent 52.7%

of total OECD demand in 2012, and
67.8% of the OECD’s average volumetric annual increase. OECD North
America will account for 28.7% of
global oil product demand, which is
modestly lower compared with 2007
(29.9%), according to IEA. By 2012,
transportation fuels should account for
about 65.3% of total regional demand,
increasing an average of 1.4%/year.
Europe will account for 30.6% of
total OECD demand in 2012, and for
21.6% of the OECD’s annual average volume increase. The share of OECD Europe
will lower slightly to 16.6% of global
product demand in 2012, compared
with 17.9% in 2007, according to IEA.
The Pacific will account for 16.7%
of total OECD demand in 2012, and for
10.6% of the OECD’s average annual
volumetric increase. By 2012, OECD
Pacific demand will correspond to 9.1%
of the world’s total, almost one percentage point down from 2007.
IEA expects non-OECD oil product
demand to increase by an average of
1.4 million b/d/year (Fig. 1b) to 43.7
million b/d from 36.6 million b/d,
or 3.6%/year during 2007-12. It will
nearly surpass total oil consumption in
the OECD.
Data uncertainties pose upside risks to
the forecast, particularly for China, India,
and the FSU. Within non-OECD countries, two regions will be major consumers in the forecast period: Asia, which
will represent about half of average nonOECD incremental demand growth, and
the Middle East, accounting for almost a
quarter, according to IEA.
Average growth will be particularly
strong in China (+5.6%/year) and the
Middle East (+4.6%/year), with other
non-OECD countries growing between
2%/year and 3%/year on average.
Transportation fuels will account for
the bulk of demand growth worldwide,
IEA reports. These fuels will represent
roughly 67% of the increase in OECD
consumption to 2012, and about 60%
of the rise in non-OECD demand.

capacity to increase 10.6 million b/d
during 2007-12, which includes 9.1
million b/d of new capacity and 1.5
million b/d of capacity creep.
Fig. 2 shows IEA forecasts for additions of crude distillation capacity
by region. The Middle East and Asia
accounts for 6.7 million b/d of the
expansions; refining capacity growth
in these regions will exceed regional
product demand. The additional capacity increases the flexibility of refiners to
process existing and future crude slates,
particularly the tranche of heavy, sour
crude spare capacity OPEC currently
holds.
IEA’s projections for refining are sub-

completion near the end of the forecast
period—3.3 million b/d from a handful of large projects during 2011-12.
These could experience additional delays if refinery economics deteriorate or
contractor-related bottlenecks increase,
or if investors believe all the biofuels
targets will be achieved.
If these investments go ahead, IEA
believes that the ability of refiners to expand gasoline supplies should improve
significantly during the next few years,
and that the potential to both process
heavy sour crudes and convert fuel
oil into lighter products will increase.

relative to crude in the past few years,
IEA believes there is the potential for
upgrading capacity additions to tighten
fuel oil and ease gasoline differentials to
benchmark crudes.
The Middle East and Asia will account for 6.7 million b/d of new
crude distillation capacity, according
to IEA. This exceeds expected regional demand growth, and India and
Saudi Arabia will develop significant
export-orientated refining capacity. The
Middle East will supply the marginal
barrel of product to importing regions
as well as the marginal barrel of crude,
according to IEA.
New refineries and upgrading capacity additions (Fig. 3) will boost product
supply flexibility in the medium term.
IEA predicts a substantial increase in
refining complexity during the next 5
years. Refiners will therefore be better positioned to meet transportation
fuel demand growth, although at the
expense of fuel oil.
Gasoline market tightness should
ease, possibly by 2008, followed by gas
oil and diesel in 2010. Jet fuel market
tightness is likely to persist until 2010
unless further unwinding in the other
transportation fuel appears. Fuel oil

markets could tighten significantly,
unless there is a shift in behavior by
consumers or refiners, according to IEA.

Reﬁnery expansion plans
IEA forecasts global crude distillation
capacity to increase 10.6 million b/d by
2012, of which (Fig. 2):
• 4.0 million b/d is due to the expansion of existing refineries, mainly in
Asia-Pacific and North America.
• 5.1 million b/d of growth comes
from newbuild distillation capacity,
largely in the Middle East, China, and
other Asia (primarily India).
• 1.5 million b/d comes from
capacity creep at existing refineries in
OECD North America, Europe, and AsiaPacific.
IEA’s report excluded projects accounting for 6.3 million b/d of crude
distillation capacity that are unlikely
to materialize by 2012. Where appropriate, IEA factored in some delays to
those projects in which it saw a risk of
contracts being re-tendered. IEA is also
concerned about the solidity of 2.4 million b/d of distillation capacity that is
currently forecast to commence operations in 2012.
Large-scale upgrading capacity ad-

ditions include 7.2 million b/d during
the next 5 years (including coking,
catalytic cracking, hydrocracking, and
visbreaking). Refiners are also continuing to invest heavily in hydrotreating
capacity to remove sulfur from refined
products. IEA expects hydrotreating
capacity to increase 8.1 million b/d
through 2012. More than half of this
total is to meet global lower-sulfur
specifications in diesel.
IEA also expects atmospheric residue
(fuel oil) hydrotreating to experience
a similarly strong increase, although
around 40% of the growth comes from
Kuwait’s al Zour project, which is slated
to start up in 2012.
In OECD regions, IEA expects no
new refineries, although several of
the larger planned expansions are
equivalent to world-class refineries.
Investment aims at improving product
quality, either through upgrading or
hydrotreating additions, or adapting
operations to handle an increasingly
heavy, sour crude slate.
North American refineries constitute
most of the forecast 1.8 million b/d
increase in OECD crude distillation
capacity and also most of the upgrading
capacity (Fig. 4). Most of the expansions are in Northern US to process
increasing amounts of heavy, sour
Canadian crude.
In Europe, investment will focus on
improving middle distillate production
through the installation of upgrading
capacity to convert atmospheric residue
into middle distillates. Pacific growth
similarly aims at improving light product yields.
IEA’s forecasts show that 51% of
world refining capacity will lie in nonOECD regions by 2012, up from 48%
currently. Product trade should increase,
and a growing proportion of that trade
will likely come from OPEC member
states, particularly in the Middle East,
which will leave the region to supply
not only the marginal crude barrel but
also the marginal product barrel.

Europe will enforce 10-ppm sulfur,
from the current limit of 50 ppm, in
gasoline and diesel in 2009. Further
tightening of the distillate market may
result from the adoption of 10-ppm
sulfur limit in 2010 for off-road
diesel, a reduction of 99% from the
1,000-ppm limit that is in effect starting this year.
In North America, the US aims to
limit benzene in gasoline to 0.6% by
2011, from 1% currently. In addition,
there is a federally mandated ethanol
blend for gasoline. The distillate market
is adjusting to the recent introduction
of a 500-ppm sulfur limit in off-road
diesel, including locomotive and marine use. Further tightening of distillatequality specifications are planned with
the adoption of ultralow-sulfur diesel
(ULSD) for all on-road (up from 80%
currently) and off-road diesel in 2010
and locomotive and marine sectors in
2012.

Vadinar expansion in late 2008 are
included in IEA’s forecast.

Middle East
The Middle East first appears to be
the largest single region of refining
capacity growth, according to IEA. The
forecast, however, now relies on a significant portion of the region’s capacity
coming on stream in 2012.
The majority of the 2.0 million b/d
of capacity will come on stream in
2012. Any further delays could result in
a significant shortfall, even on a global
basis, of newbuild refinery capacity
before 2012.
IEA expects Saudi Arabian refinery
additions of 975,000 b/d through
2012. Of this total, IEA expects 800,000
b/d to start up in 2012. This includes
Total’s 400,000 b/d Jubail refinery and
the 400,000 b/d ConocoPhillips Ras
Tanura refinery, which is more likely to
start in 2013 than 2012.
For Iran, IEA expects the phased
expansion of 360,000 b/d of condensate
splitters to start up between summer
2010 and summer 2011. Furthermore,
IEA expects 190,000 b/d of expansions
at the Arak, Lavan, and Isfahan refineries,
tied into significant increases in refinery
complexity, during 2009-12.

IEA expects Kuwait’s 615,000-b/d
refinery at al-Zour to start up in fourthquarter 2012. The report also expects a

2013, because it is a more complex and
time-consuming undertaking.

Africa
The study sees crude distillation
expansions of 313,000 b/d in Africa,
largely from projects in the northern
and eastern countries. Investment in
upgrading capacity remains limited and
new hydrotreating capacity is similarly sparse. IEA says that South African
refiners have recently completed some
investments, but prospects of more
stringent national quality specifications
early next decade may generate more
investment projects.

FSU
The expansion of existing Russian refineries dominates the region’s
growth. Planned investments will increase light product yields and improve
product quality. Significant additions
to catalytic cracking and hydrocracking
capacity, plus more limited investment
in coking and visbreaking capacity
should reduce fuel-oil production and
boost gasoline and distillate production
through to 2012, according to IEA.
Tatneft’s $4.8 billion plan for a new

Petrobras is planning to upgrade seven of its refineries, which will increase
the ability to handle its domestic heavy,
sour crude production. Some incremental crude distillation is expected to accompany the addition of 130,000 b/d
of new coking capacity through 2012.
Despite the progress evident at many of
Petrobras’s projects, IEA remains skeptical that the planned 200,000-b/d Abreu
e Lima refinery in Pernambuco state, a
joint venture with PDVSA, will be completed before 2012, with some reports
suggesting a 2014 start date.

Product supply
New refineries starting up in the
next 5 years are more complex than existing refineries, on average, according
to the study. They will therefore produce
a higher percentage of light products
and less fuel oil. Significant upgrading
capacity additions will increase demand
for heavy, sour crudes that are currently
priced at a significant discount to light,
sweet crudes.

Gasoline
IEA expects the recently tight gasoline market to start to ease soon, with
increased flexibility to expand supplies
(including ethanol) increasing during
2007-12. The increased supply potential
is most significant in the Atlantic Basin,
where the structural surplus in European gasoline supply will persist; improving the region’s potential to meet US
import requirements through 2009.
By 2012, US refiners will start to close
some of the gap in domestic supplies.
IEA expects the Middle East to remain a net importer of gasoline until
2012. In the meantime, much depends
on the outcome of Iran’s plans to invest

in FCC and condensate splitting capacity
while implementing demand restraint
measures. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait’s
capacity expansions in 2012 will rebalance regional gasoline production to
demand.
In Latin America, Brazilian refining
investments in upgrading capacity will
increase capacity for heavy domestic
Marlim crude. The net impact of these
coking additions to the gasoline pool is
limited because the refining of heavier
crude will cut naphtha yields from
crude distillation, but boost supplies of
FCC and coker naphtha, according to
IEA.
Other Asian countries will become
significant exporters of gasoline, mainly
due to India’s planned refining additions. The increase in potential supplies
will possibly increase exports to North
America, the Middle East, or Africa,
given that IEA expects the OECD Pacific
to also become more balanced by 2012.

Gas oil, diesel
The gas oil-diesel market should
remain tight in the short-term due
to strong demand growth, but could
ease from 2009 as higher global crude
distillation capacity and investment in
hydrocracking capacity come on line,
according to the report. Some regions,
however, particularly Europe, will remain importers.
The European refining system is,
according to IEA’s analysis, maximizing diesel and gas oil production from
distillation and upgrading units to
meet transport and heating oil demand.
Consequently, IEA forecasts diesel production to increase due to additional
hydrocracking and coking capacity, but
a more significant increase in production will not be achieved unless crude
runs rise significantly.
North American demand growth will
accelerate during 2007-12 and, despite
recent improvements in distillate yields,

the region will likely become a net importer of gas oil and diesel if yields do
not improve. There is some flexibility
within the US refining system, however,
to bolster distillate supplies at the expense of gasoline (particularly given the
growth in ethanol supplies), implying
that price differentials between gasoline
and diesel will be closely linked, according to IEA.
Overall, hydrocracking additions and
increased runs will cover the growth in
gas oil and diesel demand, but tightening sulfur limits and increasing cetane
requirements in diesel could further
fragment the distillate market, reducing
potential trade and supporting product
cracks if insufficient desulfurization
capacity additions occur.
The impact of marine bunker fuels
switching from fuel oil to distillate
dwarf the potential for distillate markets
to ease until 2012, according to the
study. ✦

limited.
The development of Cascade and Chinook via FPSO and shuttle tanker is an
important first step in establishing this
type of facility in the remote, ultradeep
waters of the US gulf.
This article analyzes the transportation options of a hypothetical oil
discovery in a remote part of the Lower
Tertiary play, comparing the costs of
shuttle tanker use to paying tariffs
through new and existing pipelines.

Shuttle tankers offer competitive
deep US gulf transport choice
Julie Wilson
Wood Mackenzie Ltd.
Houston

Background
Petrobras’ Lower Tertiary Cascade and
Chinook fields are the first US gulf fields
to be developed by FPSO. FPSOs are
used globally in other deepwater provinces but until recently were prohibited
in the US gulf. Their use in frontier environments is sensible, especially from a
transportation standpoint. Pipeline costs
rise disproportionately as water depths
increase, while shuttle tanker costs are
insensitive to water depth and—to a
certain extent—distance.
The shuttle tanker holds a cost advantage vs. pipeline when the full life of
the field is considered. The advantage,
however, is concentrated in the first half
of a field’s life. As production declines,
the dedicated status of the shuttle tanker
causes unit costs to increase sharply.
Sharing the shuttle tanker with another
FPSO-developed field would help defray
these high late-life costs.
Shuttle tankers hold several other
62

benefits vs. pipelines, not least the lower
risk incurred in a frontier area since
both the shuttles and the FPSO itself
can be redeployed if the development
proves disappointing. Other advantages
include avoidance of hurricane damage
and flow assurance issues, flexibility of
destination, and easier maintenance and
repair.
Certain barriers, however, exist to
the spread of shuttle tanker use in the
US gulf. The US Jones Act inflates costs
and complicates operations. Stringent
rules on gas use also mean gas from
remote discoveries might need to be
transported by gas pipeline regardless
of other factors.
It remains to be seen whether other
operators will follow Petrobras in FPSO
and shuttle tanker deployment in the
US gulf or whether pipeline companies
will be convinced to keep building
out the pipeline network to the new
frontiers.
In 2001, the US Minerals Management Service issued an environmental
impact statement approving the concept
of FPSO development. This laid the
regulatory foundation for its use, after
which the MMS announced it would
review FPSO-based development plans
on a case-by-case basis. Despite this, the
first application didn’t occur until 2006,
when Petrobras submitted it as the
development concept for Cascade and
Chinook, using two dedicated shuttle
tankers provided by OSG.
There is still, however, no shuttle
tanker fleet in the US, meaning initial
FPSO developments will need to use
dedicated vessels such as these, and taking advantage of the extensive existing
pipeline infrastructure in the US gulf
will remain an appealing development
option.

es between an FPSO and any
other types of facility design,
as well as the possible limit
on peak production and deferring of oil revenues made
possible as a result of use of
only one shuttle tanker.
The shuttle tanker holds a
clear cost advantage for the
full life of the field, but the
advantage changes during the
field’s production lifetime.
Fig. 2 outlines the fee charged
to the operator each year of
field life, using the basis of
barrels produced. The study assumes the
fees charged by the pipeline operator
do not change (on a real basis) and
the shuttle tanker is assumed to be a
dedicated vessel, with the day rate timecharter fee assumed fixed (on a real
basis) for the lifetime of the field and
paid every day, regardless of whether
the vessel is idle or working. The operator would hope, in reality, to share the
shuttle tanker with another FPSO development, thereby avoiding this late-life
unit cost increase.
At the most likely fee rate, the shuttle
tanker maintains its annual cost advantage vs. the pipeline until year 11 of the
field’s life, when declining production
causes a rapid increase in unit costs.
This cost profile depends highly on the
field’s production profile. The capacity
of the FPSO and shuttle tanker would
tend to flatten and extend peak production.
The cost profile described by Fig. 2
would likely render late-life production
uneconomic, leading to early abandonment, an act it is unclear whether
the MMS would sanction. Writing the
shuttle tanker contract with higher day
rates early in field life or sharing the
shuttle tanker with another FPSO might
mitigate this possibility.
Analysis assumed only one shuttle
tanker would be employed for a single
field. Given assumptions of field size,
FPSO and shuttle tanker capacity, and
time taken to load, unload, and travel
between FPSO and port, one tanker
would be sufficient. But Petrobras has

contracted two tankers, eroding some of the cost benefit
compared to pipelines. Two
shuttle tankers, however,
would still result in a lower
unit cost during the hypothetical field’s first 8 years.
Given Petrobras’ contract

Petrobras’ two shuttle tankers
are a lower-cost option than

environmental concerns. But even the
ruling by the MMS to begin considering
FPSO applications on a case-by-case basis
did not produce a rush of FPSO development plans, largely because the extent
of existing infrastructure gave pipelines
a cost advantage. An FPSO application
will also likely face a large amount of
red tape, and possibly the opposition of
the general public, making it no coincidence a Brazilian company is the first to
develop an FPSO plan.
The Jones Act also continues to act
as a barrier to FPSO-based field developments. This legislation dates back
to 1920 and was designed to protect
American jobs and industry at a time
of economic depression. It stipulates
any ships plying their trade between
US ports must be built in the US,
owned and crewed by US nationals and
be flagged in the US. An FPSO would
qualify as a US port (although the FPSO
itself would not be subject to Jones Act
regulations).
The Act requires any newbuild
shuttle tankers be built in one of a
handful of remaining suitable American
shipyards, raising implications for both
the cost of the tanker and the timescale.
Advances in efficiency by Asian shipyards allow them to build a ship for an
estimated half the cost of an American
yard and in a third of the time.
Conversion of existing Jones Act
vessels might be a more cost-effective
solution. They, however, are limited
in number and their market is already
very active. The cost savings in terms of
contract day rate (time charter) may not
be large, but carrying out a conversion
would still be much quicker. Petrobras
has chartered from OSG two conversions of newbuild product tankers,
which OSG already had on order from
the Aker Philadelphia shipyard. Delivery
of the first is expected in the first quarter of 2010, with the second following
a year later.
Progress on a number of FPSO developments in the US gulf might prompt
development of a shuttle tanker fleet
such as works in the North Sea, keeping costs low as specialist, third-party

tanker operators manage a fleet of vessels for a number of projects and fields.

Natural gas
The economic, environmentally
sound, and efficient disposal of any
produced natural gas is another key
issue surrounding FPSO use. Flaring
is not allowed in the US gulf and gas
injection is not common since reservoir
pressures are high and the gas is too
valuable in the US market to reinject
into the reservoir. The FPSO can burn
some gas as fuel, but this will likely not
use up all the gas.
Petrobras plans to install a small gas
export line for its Cascade-Chinook development. The economics of this line
remain unclear, but it is likely its small
size will reduce cost and installation
issues. Gas lines also have fewer flow
assurance issues than oil lines, again
keeping costs down.
The use of compressed natural gas
tankers might also be possible inn the
future, if the technology can be commercially proven. Since FPSOs do not
traditionally have space or technology
for gas storage, two CNG tankers might
need to alternate, allowing one to always be connected to the FPSO. ✦

House energy
bill an exercise
in childishness
Kicking oil companies in the shins is not
energy policy. It’s childishness.
The US House took a foot-swipe at oil
companies on Feb. 27 when it passed the
Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of 2008.
The bill would extend and enlarge tax
subsidies for electricity generated from
renewable energy and for renewable fuels
such as ethanol and biodiesel.

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

It supposedly would pay for the tax
breaks with a jab of the congressional heel
into the US oil industry’s tibia: a tax hike
estimated at $18 billion over 10 years.
“We want to take the $18 billion in tax
subsidies that the Bush administration
and previous Congresses gave oil companies and reinvest the money in alternative
energy technologies,” said Chris Van Hollen
(D-Md.; OGJ Online, Feb. 28, 2008).
This is rubbish. Of that sum, $13.57
billion would come from curtailing the oil
industry’s use of a tax deduction enacted in
2004 to help all US manufacturers compete
internationally.
The rest would come from tightening
limits on foreign tax credits associated with
oil and gas income.
Neither of those original tax measures
was enacted speciﬁcally for oil and gas
companies. And neither represents a “subsidy” on the order of the 50¢-$1/gal tax gifts
that the bill extends or creates for renewable fuels.
To pretend otherwise is deceitful.
And to pretend that the tax bill would
somehow “end our dangerous reliance on
foreign oil,” as Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles B. Rangel (D-NY)
proclaimed, is foolish.
The tax bill would steer money away
from investment in commercial energy
sources that ﬁll more than 60% of US needs
and spend it on noncommercial forms that
together account for less than 5% of total
supply.
Subsidizing renewable energy to
displace rather than supplement oil and
gas will come nowhere close to ending oil
imports. It will just waste money.
The Democratic Congress seems not to
care how much it harms energy consumers
and taxpayers as long as it can claim to be
hurting oil companies.
Grownups should know better.

Crude topped $100/bbl in February
Traders pushed crude prices well above $100/bbl in late February, turning from
equities to commodities as a haven for investments as fear of a US recession sent
the US dollar plummeting to record lows against the euro and other key currencies.
On Feb. 29, crude touched a record high of $103.05/bbl in overnight electronic
trading before ﬁnishing the week at $101.84/bbl, down from a record closing of
$102.59/bbl Feb. 28 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Despite an end-of-theweek decline in most energy prices, Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland,
noted West Texas Intermediate increased a total $3.03/bbl from the start of the week,
marking the fourth consecutive week for gains of $3-4/bbl. North Sea Brent gained
about the same, up $3.09/bbl for the week. The April contract for heating oil “managed to more or less follow with an increase of $2.71/bbl, but RBOB gasoline was
stalling and made a loss of 27¢/bbl,” Jakob said. Natural gas for April increased 1.9%,
and WTI was up $40.20/bbl from a year ago,” he said.
Dollar declines
On Feb. 28, the dollar was at its lowest exchange rate against the euro since the
European currency began trading in January 1999. The value of the US dollar had
dropped 40% against the euro and 20% against a basket of other currencies over
the last 6 years, sparking worries that it eventually could lose its place among world
currencies.
“The commodity markets are clearly under a dollar overdrive, making the call
of the top [price] a difﬁcult task,” Jakob said Feb. 28. “We do not know where the
bottom is for the dollar index, but we know that the fall in the gasoline crack cannot continue at the current pace. We will very soon come to a point where complex
reﬁners will either move back to voluntarily cutting runs or keep their systems on
maintenance for a longer period, which in turn will accelerate the building of crude
oil stocks as the backwardation on crude oil is relatively shallow.”
US inventories
The front-month crude contract climbed to an intraday record above $102/bbl in
early trading Feb. 27 on the New York market but then retreated after US ofﬁcials
reported larger-than-expected builds in crude and gasoline inventories. The Energy
Information Administration said commercial US inventories of crude increased for
the seventh consecutive week, up 3.2 million bbl to 308.5 million bbl during the
week ended Feb. 22. That surpassed Wall Street’s expectations of a 2.4 million bbl
build. Gasoline stocks jumped to their highest level in 14 years, up 2.3 million bbl
to 232.6 million bbl vs. a market consensus of a 400,000 bbl increase. Distillate fuel
inventories fell 2.5 million bbl to 120 million bbl during the same period, surpassing
expectations of a 2 million bbl decline (OGJ Online, Feb. 27, 2008).
“The high gasoline stocks (and that is before ethanol stocks are even considered)
and imports reported by [EIA] will be no supportive item. Crude oil stocks are also
steadily rebuilding with imports on the 4-week average higher by 480,000 b/d from
last year,” Jakob said. “Overall US stocks have gone from a yearly deﬁcit at the start
of the year of 65 million bbl to 20 million bbl [through Feb. 22]. With the subsequent
week last year showing a 16 million bbl draw, the overall yearly stock deﬁcit should
have mostly disappeared by the next report.”
Jakob said at the time the world petroleum markets faced “a test to see if market
participants are currently able to focus on fundamentals for more than a few hours.”
The front-month crude contract had gained $5/bbl since mid-February on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, but the crack for the April gasoline contract “has lost the
same amount, and the backwardation continues to gently erode in crude oil,” he
said.
Paul Horsnell at Barclays Capital Inc., London, said, “The global gasoline market
does look extremely weak at the moment, primarily because of how very little of the
incremental demand barrel is gasoline. However, the reverse of that is that global
distillate markets look like raging bull markets, given the extent to which the incremental global demand barrel is dominated by distillates. [Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development] demand looks weak (as it has been for 3 years), but
non-OECD demand looks robust, and Chinese demand is improving.”
Meanwhile, Ecuador declared force majeure Feb. 29 on oil exports after a
mudslide ruptured 80 m of the 390,000 b/d Trans-Ecuadorian Oil Pipeline System.
Ofﬁcials said it would take 3-6 days to repair the pipeline.

Dear Reader,

W

elcome to our first issue of the newly revamped PennEnergyJOBS career guide. We
are very excited with the many changes that have been introduced with this issue.
To start with, we have merged our Petroleum Career Guide with our Power Career Guide in
order to better address the cross-functional needs and subjects of the global energy industry’s
professional workforce. We have found
that the two mainstays of global energy,
We have found that the two mainstays

there may be differences in how the two

Those similarities are on display in this
and staffing issues are the same.
issue’s cover feature, a Women in Energy
Forum. In this forum, leading executives
from petroleum, power, and integrated energy companies share their views on career development
issues for women in the energy industry.
We will continue to offer regular departments such as Job Profile, which takes a look at the dayto-day activities and the qualifications for success in certain industry-specific lines of work. And
we soon will introduce a new feature, HR Insights, which will glean career development advice
from key human resources managers in the energy industry.
With that said, in an effort to continue catering to industry-specific topics and allow you to
quickly find the articles that interest you most, we have color-coded the magazine: Energy Interest
(green), Petroleum (taupe), and Power (blue).
By combining the two career guides, we have instantly increased our circulation to over
150,000 recipients worldwide.
As for the look and feel, we have effectively changed everything from the actual dimensions of
the magazine to the font and the layout.
And finally, to better represent the overall focus of the career guide and all of the changes
mentioned above, we gave the magazine a new name, EnergyWorkforce: For the Industry’s CareerMinded Professional
What has not changed is our mission to deliver the highest quality articles and cover the most
important topics for our industry’s career-minded professionals. We also decided to keep our
editor in place, Bob Williams, who in my opinion is among our industry’s top thought leaders.
In this issue, Bob debuts another new regular department, Editor’s Corner, in which he makes
a strong case for collaboration between the power and petroleum industries for tackling the
dominant environmental issue of our time: climate change.
I hope you enjoy the changes we have made and continue to find career benefits in reading our
publication. Our focus is and always will be to serve you, the reader.
Sincerely,

Jamie Matlin,
Publisher & Director of Recruitment Advertising

decreases. Being an eangineer and finding a position
within one’s self-risk level is the key:
• Would you like to make bottom pay scale?
(Go to a job, do your work, and go home: Average
Worker—No Risk).
• Would you like to make middle pay scale? (Go to a
job, be the best in the office: Great Worker—No Risk).
• Would you like to make high pay scale?
(Manage a work flow that increases return on
investment: Manager, Responsible for Self and
Others—Medium Risk).
• Would you like to make killer pay? (Own the
successful business; you could lose investment,
income, and be held liable—High Risk).

R

egarding the letter to the editor titled “Increase
Engineering Salaries” (PennEnergyJOBS
Petroleum Career Guide, Vol. 3, 2007), I think this
letter was written to start controversy, and it seems to
be misdirected. By stating that engineers are not well
paid compared with other professions is not comparing
apples to apples. Being a doctor, lawyer, or CEO that
makes more than an engineer also has the burden of
risk—diagnoses that could kill someone, trial record of
winning, or running a company rather than being an
employee. With the risk of the job the pay increases or

The statements above are the exact same if I replace
engineer in the first line with either doctor or lawyer.
However, the only position in that list that is different
is the CEO: someone who has taken the risk to start
a company, bought a company, or has been entrusted
with the position of CEO, which holds the high risk as
the successful business owner. Looking at the future for
engineers, with engineering graduates decreasing (in some
fields) and baby boomers in the market (US) retiring, I
personally feel that supply and demand for engineers will
increase engineers’ salaries.

A convenient marriage?

E

nergy Workforce Publisher Jamie Matlin on page
2 discusses the rationale for consolidating the
PennEnergyJOBS Petroleum and Power career guides into a
single publication.
Apart from the compelling reasons he cites, there is a
broader rationale for promoting synergies between these two
most vital of industries: Working together, they may be able to
devise a cost-effective solution to the challenge of addressing
global climate change.
Whatever your views on the issue, no one can dispute that
it has taken on juggernaut proportions. The jury may still be
out for some of us on the science regarding the inevitability
of catastrophic anthropogenic climate change. But the
verdict has been rendered on the inevitability of the world
responding to the perceived threat through actions that
target fossil fuel industries.
Most energy analysts contend that oil, natural gas, and coal
will continue to provide the vast majority of the world’s energy
supply for decades to come. Without steps to curb them, that
means more GHG emissions. Annual carbon dioxide (CO2)
emissions from US coal plants alone are expected to rise to
3.3 billion metric tons, or gigatonnes (Gt), by 2050 from about
2 Gt/year in 2006.
Some have suggested that a crash program in building
nuclear power capacity would be a solution, but the reality is
that no US utility has ordered a nuclear power plant since 1978
because of public opposition to them.
Drastically cutting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from
the use of fossil fuels will cause energy costs to soar, perhaps to
the point of economic devastation and its concomitant human
misery. No credible energy forecast points to any alternative
fuels taking away a significant chunk of market share from
fossil fuels for another generation or two. Energy costs today
already are high; what would a world look like with them
doubled or tripled—or worse?
What if there were a way to “eat our cake and have it too?”
Perhaps there is: a marriage of power plant carbon capture and
storage (CCS) with enhanced oil recovery (EOR).
In a paper presented at the Sixth Annual Conference on
Carbon Capture & Sequestration in Pittsburgh in May 2007,
Vello Kuuskraa and Phil Dipietro posited that notion and put
numbers to the potential benefits offered by such a marriage.
(Kuuskraa is president of Advanced Resources International,
Washington, DC, and Dipietro is with the US Department of
Energy’s National Energy Technology Laboratory [NETL].)
While CCS is hugely expensive ($35–40/tonne of CO2),
power producers could make it cost-effective by selling the

E n er gy Wo r k f o r c e

waste CO2 to oil producers, who in turn would sequester the
CO2 by injecting it into oil reservoirs to recover more oil. In
the US, this represents no small number. NETL estimates
that of the bypassed discovered oil in US oil fields shallower
than 5,000 ft, about 218 billion bbl is technically recoverable.
US conventional proved oil reserves today total about 21
billion bbl.

What if there were a way to “eat our cake and
have it too?” Perhaps there is: a marriage of
power plant carbon capture and storage (CCS)
with enhanced oil recovery (EOR).
NETL also has shown that most of the thousands of aging
oil fields in the US are amenable to CO2 EOR. The process
currently accounts for about 4% of US oil production. The
main reason it isn’t applied much more widely is that oil
producers have long lamented the lack of CO2 supply within
a reasonable distance. The Permian basin of West Texas and
New Mexico is percolating with CO2 EOR projects because
large natural reservoirs of CO2 are close by in Colorado and
New Mexico.
It has been estimated that it would take the application of
CCS to 275 gigawatts of coal-fired power in the US to meet
the cuts required to help the world stabilize the atmosphere’s
CO2 load. Kuuskraa and Dipietro estimated that such a
program could make available 8–12 Gt of CO2 to sell to US
oil producers for EOR during 2020–2050, enabling power
producers to avoid $10/tonne of CO2 sequestration cost and
net $300 billion in incremental revenue during the period.
US oil producers, in turn, could recover an additional 24–47
billion bbl of oil. The direct economic benefits to the US could
total trillions of dollars.
This will be neither cheap nor easy. But the oil industry
already is using industrial waste CO2 for enhanced oil and gas
recovery—at Weyburn, Sask., and off Norway. It just might
work on a much broader scale. And it keeps vital parts of our
energy infrastructure intact.
For those who demonize the fossil fuels that underpin
our way of life, this may prove to be an “inconvenient truth”
they don’t want to hear. But it may prove to be a “convenient
marriage” for the rest of us.

Forum: Career prospects for women
in energy better than ever
Bob Williams, Managing Editor

The energy industry’s daunting challenge to
sustain a viable workforce has created the best
environment to date for women to develop
and advance their careers in businesses that
traditionally have been heavily male-dominated.
EnergyWorkforce has invited three leading
female executives in the energy industry to
participate in a forum on the current climate
and outlook for women seeking to enter or
advance their careers in the energy business.
The forum participants represent a wide range of
disciplines across disparate types of business:
Dr. Eve Sprunt is manager of university
partnership and recruitment for Chevron Corp.,
one of the world’s largest integrated oil and
natural gas companies.
Holly Koeppel is executive vice-president and
chief financial officer of American Electric
Power, one of the largest electric utilities and
power producers in the US.
Dr. Schuyler Gordon is manager of school
relations for Entergy Services Inc., an integrated
energy services company with power generation
and transmission and natural gas distribution
business units.

Glass ceiling
Q: Is there still a glass ceiling for women in the energy industry?
If so, why do you think that is the case, and how pervasive is it
(especially in comparison with other industries)?
SPRUNT: Across the industry we are starting to see more and
more examples of women rising to true executive levels. While

6

women are still underrepresented at the top levels, tremendous
progress has been made. When I started in the industry almost
30 years ago with a company that has since been acquired,
there were few female professionals, and I didn’t encounter
a female manager for many years. It was novel to just hire
a woman. I remember when I was a project leader, and my
company was very uncomfortable with having a woman
manage older men. Attrition was relatively high because some
women became frustrated with the limited opportunities, lack
of advancement, and challenges of achieving an acceptable
work/life balance. But now, the environment has changed, and
there are more opportunities for women to advance, and in an
environment that supports them.
GORDON: If a glass ceiling currently exists within some
organizations within the energy industry, one reason for
its existence may be the result of years of low attrition
and voluntary termination of energy industry employees.
Traditionally, the vast majority of employees within the
energy industry may have been that of male employees; thus
in a traditional seniority-based system these individuals
ascended higher into the organization than others, resulting
in a glass ceiling. Certainly, this is not the only explanation
for a glass ceiling potentially existing within the industry,
but it may be one that will soon be eliminated. As attrition
and voluntary termination slowed, so did the movement
of these individuals throughout the organization, thereby
resulting in very few positions being available for women
within the industry. As we currently expect—and are
seeing—a large exiting of these individuals from the energy
industry, I anticipate that this glass ceiling may begin to
dissipate somewhat as the pool of available and qualified
candidates reflect a larger number of women available.
It is my hope that any glass ceilings that currently exists
within the energy industry will be identified and actively
eliminated to ensure that women within this industry are
given an equal playing field in terms of the opportunities
available to them, as well as career development options.
KOEPPEL: I don’t think there was or is a glass ceiling,
but I do think that it was difficult for a woman to map

make tough choices on our priorities. Given the increase of
female representation in the industry, many things that are
considered women’s issues are actually dual-career-couple
issues. Dual-career couples are increasingly common among
young professionals, and challenges arise whether the partners
work for the same company and/or the same industry. At some
point in their careers, the couples are forced to decide whose
career takes precedence. In the past, men usually had better
opportunities, so it was the man’s career that dominated. Now,
we see more instances where the women’s career takes the
lead. Since it is a waste of a company’s investment to truncate
either partner’s career, a challenge for business is to figure out
how to enable both partners to enjoy satisfying careers. With
the huge number of job opportunities we have now, flexible
and creative management should be able to enable couples to
work for many years—if not their
entire careers—without forcing
one partner to seriously limit his
or her potential. This is a business
issue that is in the company’s best
interest to pay attention to.

additional initiatives that organizations are creating to ensure
a pipeline of diverse talent, one can only fathom the limits
they will have within the energy industry. Some of the things
that are now being focused on to increase the pipeline within
the energy industry include expanded recruitment activities,
vast relationship-building opportunities with targeted
women organizations, targeted scholarships/internships/
apprenticeships, increased advertisement within majorityfemale publications, increased focus on the leadership
development activities and programs of women, and more
formalized mentorship opportunities being available, as well
as dedicated cross-functional discussions of women talent to
ensure targeted career development options. When all of these
things are integrated into a well-thought-out performance
management process, the prospects for career advancement for
women within the energy industry is even more pronounced.

GORDON: Entergy has always actively promoted the career

Initiatives for women
Q: What initiatives should the energy industry undertake to
improve prospects for women to advance their careers?
GORDON: Many within the energy industry have already
realized some of the key processes and programs they should
institute for further advancement of women within their
careers, but the most important ones that I’ve found is that
of mentoring and active succession and career planning
discussions. All three of these programs are tied together in
that a thorough discussion of one’s career will thereby lead to
more formal discussions regarding the women’s careers within
the organization. When thoughtful discussions around career
paths and possible replacements are held, valuable information
regarding areas of growth and opportunity are discussed so
that aggressive action can be taken to develop these women in
the areas that are needed to advance their careers. We’ve found
that active participation in the company’s mentoring program
has been a wonderful way for women to network as well as
engage in continuous learning by partnering with individuals
whose perspective and experience can enhance their knowledge
and understanding of business, cultural, or technical issues.

While participation in our program is voluntary and is not
intended to replace informal mentoring relationships that also
exists, we’ve found that the mentoring program promotes and
enhances professional development and personal growth for
both the mentee and the mentor. When these things happen, the
prospects for career advancement significantly increase.
KOEPPEL: I think the same types of initiatives apply to all
demographic groups, including women and minorities. We
need to look at not just development plans for individuals,
but at a programmatic approach for rotation programs, cross
training, and developmental moves. It’s important at all levels
that we focus on broadening the skills and experience base of
the organization.
SPRUNT: Companies need to be flexible and recognize
that not everyone’s career must take the same path and that
priorities for employees change. Chevron is a family-friendly
company in that it recognizes and works to accommodate many
different personal situations through flexible working practices
such as alternate work locations, alternate work schedules,
telecommuting, and support for those caring for dependents.

IEEE-PES 2008 governing board led by women
Five women have been elected to the governing board
of the IEEE Power Engineering Society (IEEE-PES)
for 2008.
The fact that IEEE-PES is now led by women is evidence
that females are making significant strides in the power
industry, says Wanda Reder, IEEE-PES president.
Reder, vice-president, power systems for S&C Electric, is
the first female president of IEEE-PES.
Women also were elected IEEE-PES secretary and
treasurer. The society’s 2008 secretary is Cheryl Warren,
vice-president, asset strategy and investment planning,
National Grid USA; its treasurer for 2008 is Dr. Noel
Schultz, associate professor, electrical and computer
engineering, Mississippi State University.

About IEEE and PES
IEEE (originally the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers) describes itself as “the world’s
leading professional association for the advancement
of technology.”

“IEEE and PES will be celebrating its 125th year
anniversary in 2009,” said Reder. “We believe this is the
first time in the history of IEEE that any society has had
females in all three of these positions.

Through its global membership, IEEE is a leading
authority on areas ranging from aerospace systems,
computers, and telecommunications to biomedical
engineering, electric power, and consumer
electronics, among others. It has more than 370,000
members in more than 160 countries and includes
39 societies.

“It is especially significant because these governing board
positions are elected by the membership.”

IEEE-PES membership encompasses more than 21,000
individuals engaged in electric power engineering.

motivated women engineers and scientists to fill the ranks—
and offering an environment where they can excel and build a

to fill well-compensated jobs. For example, many Indonesians
have moved to the Middle East to fill better-compensated jobs.
There is now a large section of IATMI (Society of Indonesian
Petroleum Engineers) in the Middle East, and the president
of the section is a woman. As 2006 president of the Society of
Petroleum Engineers, I was very pleased to meet women in
leadership positions in SPE and in their companies all around
the world. In March 2007, I was thrilled to be a keynote
speaker at a meeting on women in science and technology in
Bahrain that included very impressive women from Kuwait,
Bahrain, Oman, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia. In Libya, I visited a
university with a young woman who had just been elected as

Electricity providers have a public service obligation and ethic

Humility seen as key trait for
energy futures trader’s success
Bob Williams, Managing Editor

Energy commodity futures trading is a risky
business; succeeding at it calls for boldness,
stamina, resilience, aptitude with numbers, a
keenly analytic mind—and humility.

Energy futures trader and risk hedging advisor Steve Mosley,
principal and president of Steven A. Mosley Inc., Maumelle,
Ark., actually names humility the number one characteristic he
deems necessary for charting a successful career as an energy
futures trader.
“I really do think that people that trade for themselves or
trade for others, deep down they’re
very humble people,” Mosley said.
“Because somewhere along the way
you’ve had your head handed to

me. The cockier [some traders] are,
the less experienced they are.”

bottom lines with smart hedges that helped them weather oil
and gas price spikes that otherwise would have taken huge
bites out of profits. So the services of a seasoned futures trader
and risk hedging advisor such as Mosley are increasingly in
demand. But it’s a difficult business to get into, hard to navigate
around, and even tougher to succeed at.
Mosley, who specializes in natural gas contracts, is registered
with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as
a Commodity Trading Advisor (CTA) and is a member of the
National Futures Association (NFA). While he still conducts
limited speculative trading services for some clients, the main
focus of his business today is providing risk hedging advice for
oil and gas producers and industrial firms that include the steel,
metals, paper, fertilizer, petrochemical, and agricultural sectors.

“Essentially, I became a commodity futures trader in 1991
while managing risk for the gas marketing joint venture that
I founded in 1988.,” he said. “I used swaps to hedge price
for our gas marketing deals and used proprietary funds
to trade natural gas futures contracts speculatively from
1991 through 2002. The speculative
activity was successful in that an initial

— Steven A. Mosley,
natural gas futures trader, risking hedging consultant
With high and extremely volatile oil and natural gas prices
the norm today, more and more companies—from oil and
gas producers to other commodity producing industries—are
hedging oil and gas price risk in the energy futures markets.
It’s a dynamic business itself fraught with risk. Some oil and
gas producers have seen financial results turn sour in a given
quarter—even while cash flow is already robust from high
commodity prices—because of ill-fated hedges. Alternatively,
some industrial and agricultural firms have bolstered their

Mosley began winding down personal
trading in 2002 and became registered
as a CTA with the CFTC so that he
could properly manage outside funds
and provide advice on futures trading
and hedging. He has profitably managed
outside funds in natural gas futures since
becoming a CTA. He also began providing hedging advice in
2003 and currently has a number of oil and gas and industrial
clients that he provides with a standard written products as
well as other add-on services.
Background
Mosley attended Oklahoma State University at Stillwater,
Okla., and graduated in the mid-1970s, getting an
accounting degree.

up,” he said. “We managed to hedge and stay in business. My
half of the venture could have been in dire straits if I hadn’t
done that. When we sold out, I worked for a year for Vesta to
keep all those contracts with them and made sure that all of
those industrials stayed with them—
and I actually added a few more.”
“I’ve been known to set an alarm clock and check it periodically in the night if I am particularly nervous about a position.

tally and physically exhausted.”

“I had a real good run of about 10 years
business, then this was why I needed to do it—because I
knew more about the Arkla transportation business and the
markets and the industrials than anybody over there and
anybody outside the company.”

That decision led to a 50-50 joint venture Mosley with a small
firm, Panda Resources Inc., Tulsa, that handled marketing and
transportation services for Arkla for 5 years.

just speculating on futures, making my
living that way and had a couple of years where I made a lot of
money. Probably the worst year was when I lost about $100,000.
It was a rollercoaster, and it kind of became stressful over time.”

“I built up more industrial customers on Arkla than anybody
else had. They tended to be the smaller and medium-sized
customers, and we took good care of them, had some real
loyal customers.”

Subsequent concerns over financial security for his family
spurred Mosley to make the decision to phase out his personal
trading and start a consulting and trading business, first
getting registered as a CTA.

Once the natural gas supply bubble of the late 1980s dissipated,
prices rose, producers demanded letters of credit, Panda
changed its business model, and the Mosley-Panda joint
venture sold the marketing side of the business to Tulsa-based
Vesta Natural Gas Co. Around the same time, the natural gas
futures market had started up.

“I started trying to offer my services either trading gas or
writing reports for people and sharing my perspective on
the market—basically what I’d developed as a system for
identifying highs and lows in the market. I was having trouble
finding people to trade with me, but the reports caught on
fast. Oil and gas companies started buying them, and some
very large industrials—paper mills, fertilizer plants, steel
companies, agricultural and aluminum companies—started
buying the reports. So I turned it into a standardized report. I’d
do a monthly report, then weekly reports, then I’d do midweek
updates whenever the market started doing something that we
were not expecting.”

“The hardest part of what we were doing then was risk
management, because we would buy gas at market and sell it
at a fixed price,” Mosley said. “We had real good fortune for
the first 2 or 3 years because we would do a fixed-price deal
and the market would fall during the year, and we would make
more money than we thought we were going to.
“And then when it turned, we needed to start hedging. So
we figured out how to do swaps. We were one of the first gas
marketers doing swaps; we were doing swaps with Williams
[Cos.,] and we did one with Enron. I researched all this and
figured out how to do it.”
About then Mosley started dabbling with speculation in the
futures market.
“There was one time where we couldn’t afford a letter of
credit for some swaps, so I ended up just buying a whole lot
of futures contracts just right as the market started running

Although Mosley had quit trying to offer his trading services,
some of his reports also brought him a few trading prospects.
“It’s kind of hard to bring on new clients when you’re trading a
lot, because that’s really a full-time thing too.”
As the trading service opportunities diminished, Mosley
expanded his consulting business.

In speculative trading of energy futures commodities, activities
tend to extend from Sunday night until late Friday afternoon,

“The most difficult aspect of trading involves the 24-hour/
day trading that takes place in the energy markets,” he said.
“When I have a position on or am looking to establish one, it
is important to keep a sharp eye on everything a good portion
of the day and as much as possible at night. I have a screen
that I can watch at home as well as in the office, and I tend to
check it several times in the evening as well as in the middle
of the night when I wake up. I’ve been known to set an alarm
clock and check it periodically in the night if I am particularly
nervous about a position.”
Mosley acknowledges that such a work style can take
its toll.
“That’s one of the exhaustive things about trading—sometimes
you don’t go back to sleep,” he said. “You end up getting
mentally and physically exhausted. That was the worst thing
that happened to energy markets, in my opinion, to go to allnight trading. It made it very, very difficult.”
Before all-night trading, “you could look at what happened
during the day and envision what you thought the market
would open at the next day and either get in or get out. It was
closed for the night, and there wasn’t anything you could do
about it. You went home. At 9 o’clock the next morning, the
market opened again, and you watched it open based on the
fundamentals, and that was it.”
Nowadays, there are some big players on energy futures
market who will move large contract volumes at night,
“and a lot of times the biggest moves come at 5 o’clock in
the morning.”
Fortunately, a trader is able to set triggers to get in or out
of the market if it should hit certain points, which helps to
reduce the amount of time otherwise spent watching live
trading. Such triggers, or “stops,” allow a trader to reduce
much of the emotion and stress of the trading function
and helps to keep the mind clear and objective in the
decisionmaking process.
“I have greatly reduced and almost eliminated my trading
in proprietary funds after 2002,” Mosley noted. “Essentially,
I believe it helps me stay fresher and a little more objective
if I’m not trading my own funds. I have never traded
my own funds while trading speculatively for others.
Professionally and ethically, a CTA has to take care of his
clients first.”

A typical week of personal trading for Mosley would entail
undertaking two or three transactions, including adding to a
position as well as taking from a position. The same amount
applied to trading for clients.

“My goal is to know what is moving the market and to
be able to anticipate market trends in order to provide
clients with timely conclusions and recommendations
that are proactive as opposed to reactive. The idea is to

adjustments to their hedging
“There are some folks who trade in and out a lot, catch the
daily moves. I try to maintain the big picture and then just
trade from one side of the market. If I think the market is
moving up, then I’ll trade from the long side. If I think it’s
moving down, I’ll trade from the short side.”
How a hedging advisor works
A hedging advisor also faces a 6-day work week, although the
sleep patterns are better.
“I don’t tune into the market real early in the morning,” Mosley
said. “Energy markets are open 24 hours a day, and you get
some strange trades at night and first thing in the morning. I
usually wait until the floor trading starts, when there’s a high
volume, and then I plug into the market, and I check weather.
“Weather is one of the first things I check every day—in fact
I check weather several times a day. You’re always looking,
especially this time of year, for anything new that might be
moving the market, such as weather forecasts. With natural
gas you’re looking at what’s going on in North America,
especially east of the Rockies...”
Mosley’s clients receive standardized reports that
include a monthly report, weekly reports, and occasional
midweek updates.
“I basically need to be well plugged into what is going
on in the futures market and what is happening with the
fundamental and technical factors that affect its movement,”
he noted. “Much of my time is spent checking and analyzing
various weather forecasts, storage data, cash pricing, and
other markets that affect natural gas, such as oil and the
factors that affect oil’s movement.

18

positions—prefer services beyond
written reports and updates.
“With these clients, I provide anywhere from one to four
e-mail or phone updates per day and will comment on
changes in weather forecasts and other intraday changes in
fundamental or technical factors.”
In his monthly report, Mosley tries to lay out a “big picture”
perspective of a coming movement and then uses the
weekly and daily updates to adjust projections based on how
fundamentals and technicals are varying from expectations.
“I probably spend more time writing and fine-tuning my
reports than my clients realize,” he said. “The act of writing
helps to focus sharply on the subject matter, and the editing
process provides the assurance that what I’ve said makes
sense and is still consistent with my thoughts on the day the
report is issued.”
Monthly reports are composed and adjusted from Tuesday
through Friday, and weekly reports are done on Thursday
and Friday. In both cases, Mosley does the final edit on
Saturday and generally sends it to clients via e-mail by
early Saturday afternoon. “I then use the remainder of
Saturday and Sunday for R&R and clear my mind for the
coming week,” he said. “I do check in on weather forecasts
and the market when it opens again on Sunday evening. I
spend spare time during the day making prospective client
contacts and taking care of administrative functions and
related paperwork.”
Basically a typical day for Mosley involves research,
monitoring, and “getting your head in the game as to what’s
going on.

What moves the market
Energy traders don’t have time to do a
lot of research, Mosley noted, and thus
tend to react viscerally to market movements.

“There’s a tremendous amount of advice that goes out in
the market from brokerages and the like. And it’s written by
people who have no trading experience themselves. As far
as I know, I’m probably the only advisor that has a successful trading record to back up my advice.”
— Steve Mosley

“The commodities markets move on two things—anxiety
and comfort. Anxiety tends to create upward moves, and
comfort tends to create lower moves. High storage creates
comfort; mild weather creates comfort. Anxiety is created
when you’re moving toward a seasonal period, like moving
toward winter because you have anxiety over what the
winter might bring.
“So the whole idea is to get an overall feel for the market as
to whether you’ve got anxiety building or some comfort and
whether you’ve reached a peak in anxiety or you’ve reached

the lowest part of the comfortable.
“You see a day where you say, ‘Things couldn’t get any more
bearish than this—storage is up, and the forecasts just came
out for mild weather’—a lot of times that will be your low in
the market. If it stops moving downward for a time, a lot of
times you’ve reached your low.
“There’s a lot of just experience to go by—you recognize
things from what you’ve seen in the past. History repeats
itself. There have been times when I’ve looked at what the
fundamentals were at a certain point in time, and I’ll see what
the fundamentals are now and go back and look at when they

were similar and when highs and lows came and why. Then
what I’d do is project when a high or low is going to occur.”
Then there are times when something out of the ordinary
occurs in the futures markets, Mosley point out: “Maybe oil is
moving to one of its all-time highs, and sometimes that will
take natural gas with it. You have to know from experience
how long and much it’s going to affect gas. There are certain
times of the year that oil does affect gas very directly, like in
spring and early summer. You pay close attention to oil at
those times.”
Seasonal umbrella
Mosley’s overview of the gas futures market is that of a
seasonal “umbrella,” in which he has divided the year into
four components: a winter season, a summer season, and two
seasons that lead up to those—the shoulder months.
“There are seasonal tendencies in each of those periods to
have highs and lows,” he said. “There are usually one or two
significant highs and one or two significant lows in each of
those periods. So I try to get my industrial clients to hedge
at the lows, and I try to get the producers in a position to
hedge at the highs. Based on what the fundamentals are and
what the seasonal aspects are, I kind of marry those together.
You look within the season and see what the tendencies
are, and then you look at the fundamentals—and if certain
fundamentals skew, you have to suspect your timing is not
going to be like normal.”

because what highs we’ve gotten have come at odd times, and
the times when we usually get them, we haven’t had them,” he
said. “It’s been tough on them and tough on me too.”
Research and data
A hedging consultant must invest a great deal of time in
researching daily happenings and current statistics.
“I read newswires to see what’s happening. The newswires tend
to be overly dramatic about what’s going on in the market, but
it’s interesting to see what they’re talking about. Reuters is a
really good newswire.
“I do research on the EIA [US Energy Information
Administration] website just to see what’s going on with oil
markets. I’ve got daily charts of all the oil, the gasoline, the
natural gas prices, and I watch those charts during the day
just to get a feel for how they’re reacting to various weather
forecasts and the things that are going on.
“You spend a lot of time in front of the tube. And you make a
lot of phone calls. You call people whose judgment you value—
other traders, other folks like yourself.
“The whole idea is to lay out expectations in a monthly report
for how the market is going to react for that month—and
actually for a whole season. At the beginning of the season,
I’ll say: ‘Here’s when I expect the highs and lows to occur, and
here’s the general price I expect, based on fundamentals.’”

“Once you get in, if you get upside down a certain amount,
you get out because you weren’t anticipating that. Sometimes you’d stay in a day, maybe 2 days, and if [the market]
isn’t doing what you thought it was going to do, you just get
out and take your loss. Those little losses are so much easier to recoup than a big, bad loss. You can get really down
on yourself when you make a mistake—you think: ‘I should
have seen that coming.’ But when you do make money, and
you have a good run, it’s the best feeling in the world.”
— Steve Mosley
Mosley noted that the extremely high gas storage levels of the
past 2 years have put the market off its normal timing for the
seasonal highs.
“It’s been very tough for some of my producer clients to put
down some good hedges during some of the high points,

20

Once the period is under way, Mosley
monitors those fundamentals, noting
his original expectations and advising
clients to make needed adjustments.

“I lay out recommendations at the
back of my reports as to when they
ought to hedge and when they
ought to watching for hedges, and
sometimes during the middle of the
week I’ll send out a report saying,
‘This is when you ought to be hedging
now’ (an example of one of Mosley’s midweek reports is shown

“The discretionary traders, when they do well, they
tend to do very well. The technical traders tend to be

“[The big brokerage houses] tend to hire some
MBAs and put them in a room and say, ‘Here,
make some economic analysis.’ I’ve never talked to one of
those guys that writes that stuff that has ever traded a contract
for his own account.
“Some are good with storage statistics, but I don’t pay any
attention to their thoughts on market movement.”

Mosley contends a background in the oil and gas industry itself
and experience as an energy futures contract trader are an
imperative for someone to provide good energy risk hedging
advice. In order to be a credible hedging advisor or speculative
funds manager, he contends, it is essential to have successfully

managed proprietary or outside funds in speculative futures.
He also thinks it is important to thoroughly understand the
commodity involved and to have worked as a player in the
related industry.
“You almost have to trade [to be adept at giving risk hedging
advice]; it sharpens your senses when it’s your own money
on the line. Trading is a very emotional, stressful thing to do.
A lot of times after a big trade, you’ve been in the market for

other people, and I hate to lose my own money. Fortunately,
I’ve always made money for myself and for others.”
When his own money was on the line, Mosley always
sought a comfort zone in deciding whether to go long
or short.
“Once you get in, if you get upside down a certain amount,
you get out because you weren’t anticipating that. Sometimes
you’d stay in a day, maybe 2 days, and if [the market] isn’t
doing what you thought it was going to do, you just get out

about sticking with a long position, because it’s likely to turn
very sharply on you.”
Mosley generally divides traders into two camps: discretionary
and technical—the former ruled more by experience and
instinct, the latter more by elaborate statistical models
“The discretionary traders, when they do well, they tend to
do very well. The technical traders tend to be some of the
big boys in the East, and they’re happy to knock down 7%
[return on investment] a year. A good discretionary trader
can knock down maybe 50% in a year, but he might lose 5%

Mosley contends that the less time spent watching the
market during an active trade, the better for the trader’s
peace of mind.

“It’s a very strange business. Everybody has his own system.
Some people trade only on technical factors, others trade
only on fundamentals. My system involves both technicals
and fundamentals.

Understanding the business
Mosley contends that it’s difficult to understand how the
commodities futures trading industry works because there’s
not much information on it.

“The people that trade only on technical factors often have
absolutely no idea about the markets that they trade—it’s
just all these technical things, like when certain waves
happen, they get in. They’ve discovered over time that they
can be right more often than they’re wrong by using that
system. I really need to know the market; I need to know
when the market’s about to blow or fall apart and to get in
and ride that.”

Essentially, a person or corporate entity is generally required
by law to have a registration with the CFTC and membership
in the NFA if they are soliciting funds for management in
commodity futures, Mosley noted: “My registration is such
that I can only solicit funds management services with
qualified eligible participants. These are normally considered
to be wealthy individuals, corporate entities, or other members
of the NFA.

It’s also critical to pay attention to the seasonal aspects of
trading, Mosley said. “Seasonally, there is a tendency for a

A natural gas futures risk hedging consultant’s advice to clients

“Clients,
“In our last weekly report, we continued to note the
progress of our anticipated late December/early January
rally and continued to think that the window for this rally
would close by around the 15th of the month. As such, we
thought the highest point would occur sometime between
Friday (1/11/08) and Wednesday (1/16/08).
“The high point of our rally appears to have come on
Monday (1/14/08) at $8.482, as early week forecasts
stayed very bullish. Since Monday, however, private
weather forecasts have been hinting that the arctic cold
that is moving into the US will end in late January and
that a Pacific flow will resume. We think these forecasts
have correctly facilitated the pullback to the low $8’s.
The National Weather Service forecast this afternoon
appears to have picked up on the same indicators as the
private forecasters, and the market has dropped closer
to $8 in today’s late afternoon electronic trading. Even if
forecasters eventually decide that the cold will stay around
a little while longer into February, we don’t think the
market will be able to mount a recovery that will exceed
the $8.482 high-water mark from Monday.

know my clients and to understand that my advisory services
are appropriate for their needs.”
Companies or individuals looking for funds management
services in commodity futures need to be careful that
they are dealing with appropriate entities registered with
the CFTC and members of the NFA, said Mosley. Those
looking for only advisory services are also better off
looking for a CTA.
“While the right of free speech allows anyone the ability to
state opinions on market movement, the chances that you
will be getting advice from someone with experience and a
successful track record are much better if they are a CTA.

E n er gy Wo r k f o r c e

“If the weather pattern hints are right, and the pattern
does change back to the Pacific flow, we think there is
still a good chance that the year-on-year storage deficit
can be eliminated by early March. As such, we continue
to target mid-to-late February for a winter seasonal low
and continue to think prompt month market pricing
should have the potential to fall back below $7, somewhat
as expected. If cold lingers on materially, we will be
much less apt to see the deficit eliminated and may not
accumulate the necessary market comfort to get pricing
back to $7.
“We anticipate that cash pricing will rise tomorrow and
Friday as the coldest air approaches, and this may open
the door to a late-week recovery in natural gas futures.
However, we are not anticipating that any recovery this
week or next will exceed $8.482 and that this high will
stand as our late December/early January significant high.”

“CTAs usually charge for their advisory services. A good
saying to remember in looking for advisory services is that

about conducting business as a CTA is being found
by entities that can benefit from one’s knowledge
and advice.
“While the NFA will provide a name and address list of all
registered entities, they are not willing to produces a directory
that would make it easier to locate a person or company
with certain specialties…I hope this is something that can be
changed at some point.

“Essentially, those who have completed the requirements for
registration are, in effect, the ‘good guys’ in the commodity
futures business, and I think it would be in the best interest
of investors and those looking for advice is for the NFA to
make information on such entities more readily available
and easy to decipher.
“It’s a tough industry, even when you’re in it, to find people
to do business with. When you’re trading your own money,
you don’t have to be registered, you just do it yourself.
When you’re trading other people’s money…it’s just hard to
find those folks that will want you to trade their money.”
The NFA’s policy of not making it easier to find commodities
traders for fear of helping them “promote” themselves is
“a frustration of being a little guy,” said Mosley. “It tends
to favor the big guys who have the names,—the Goldman
Sachs, the Smith Barneys—and they generally make their
money off of trades. They have research folks who write
reports whose purpose it is to generate trades and to boost
their image.”
The most difficult thing about managing outside funds
is convincing a client of the importance of sticking to
a disciplined trading approach, according to Mosley:
“It’s better to occasionally settle for a flat trading year as
opposed to taking a low-probability risk that varies from
a proven system. As a result of this type of discipline, I
have only had 1 year with a material loss in over 13 years
of speculative trading.”
Hedging strategies
Even after providing his advice on hedging, Mosley
often doesn’t know what the strategies or outcomes are
for his clients. “The folks that I give advice to I don’t
trade for; I just give them advice as to when to pull the
trigger on a long or a short sale. A lot of times you don’t
know what they’re doing. They may make only one or
two hedges a year.

at all the futures prices for the entire year, and they’re
lower than what they paid last year. They may say, ‘Maybe
we ought to hedge here. Let’s see what Mosley says, if he
thinks the market is going to go lower or expects to turn
and go back up.’”
One client will contact him via e-mail several times during
the day because they’re constantly putting on hedges and
taking them off.
“They don’t reveal their strategy to me, and I won’t know
whether they’re in or out. I’m sort of a third head for them.”
Personal characteristics
Being a futures trader is not something ones sets out to
do, Mosley has discovered: “It’s something you pick up
sometimes out of necessity. It’s a dangerous thing to do. I had
a friend that basically lost about everything he had. You have
to be very, very careful.”
His advice to a young person interested in commodities
futures trading:
“You have to be humble. You need a very analytical
background. My accounting, programming, and math
abilities have given me the ability to dissect the market,
looking for patterns. I was always good at that, looking for
patterns in tests and the like.
“You have to be bold and have some determination to get
back up off the ground and go at it again. You have to be
resilient. You have to have mental and physical stamina. It
will wear you down. You occasionally have a year where
you don’t make any money, where you’re right only 50% of
the time.

“The whole idea is that when they’re trying to lock in 6
months or a year of gas prices, they’re reading my stuff to
see what I think is one of the market lows.

“While I don’t know a recipe for a successful trader, I
credit my math abilities and my analytical background in
computer programming and public accounting in providing
me with the necessary thought processes and discipline that
I think it took for me to experience a degree of success in
this field.” —EW

“These industrials, there’s a lot of reasons why they would
lock in. Maybe they’ve beaten last year’s budget and looked

POWER

Rejuvenating the workforce supply chain
Brad Kamph, Interliance Consulting Inc.

This is the first of three articles analyzing the
bottom-line approach to knowledge retention in
the energy industry.

Everybody’s talking about the workforce these
days. Unfortunately, it can mean different things to
different people.
Some consider it a human resources (HR) matter, while
others think the term applies to the “brain drain” resulting
from a constant stream of retirees or is all about training
and knowledge management.
So who is right? Each one is correct—at least in part.
To comprehend the serious personnel situation the utility
industry faces, it is vital to grasp the entirety of what could
be termed the workforce supply chain. This article discusses
the workforce supply chain and lays out a way to analyze
it in each company in order to determine priorities and
set effective strategy. The goal is to halt the steady loss of
skills through attrition and set the organization on the right
footing for the future.

According to the US Department of Labor, estimated
retirements for 2006 were 4.4%. Measured “quits” in
the utilities industries, on the other hand, totaled 19.4%
for the year. Clearly, retirement is a problem. But these
numbers highlight the fact that retirement represents only
about one-fifth of the overall attritional situation. Yet only
one out of every eight companies has a goal of addressing
nonretirement attrition.
Reading these data, some utilities might be tempted to
immediately reverse course, abandon aging workforce
actions, and tackle other forms of attrition. However,
that might not be the best approach. Some companies
desperately need to address retirement, while others don’t.
And some need to address both in equal measure. The
point is that each organization is uniquely different and has
specific and individual needs.
Workforce supply chain elements
Without an understanding of the workforce supply
chain, the utility industry is beset with a host of
problems. Most are attempting to combat the loss of
organizational knowledge through retirement and
headhunting. Those that fail
to stem the tide then have to
come up with new, qualified
resources. And that leads to
another dilemma—to pay a
premium for experienced staff

Most current strategies, though, are either incomplete
or flawed. Despite serious effort at improvement, these
companies continue to struggle in the battle against
attrition. It takes a cold, hard look at

The workforce supply chain comprises elements such as recruitment, development, and retention. While knowledge capture is vital to development, it is not actually a part of the development process.

order to implement a workforce strategy that significantly

compensation policy, a resume database, headhunting, and
a whole lot more.
But done on its own without the right strategic guidance,
recruitment efforts can go astray. Companies end up
with too many green employees while the situation is
dire at a critical installation that is about to lose several
valuable staff.
Alternatively, the HR budget can be placed under
severe stress when too much emphasis is placed on
hiring top talent.
It’s all a case of finding the right balance between
experience and cost. A workforce analysis goes a long way
towards locating that sweet spot in any organization.
Development
Hired personnel immediately move into the development
category. Similarly, all existing personnel correctly come
under the province of development—the more their skills
are honed and new skills learned, the greater their value to
the organization.
The development phase consists of two principal
aspects, knowledge transfer and personnel qualification.
The goal is to transform raw and existing talent into
competent resources.
Training certainly plays a major role in this—and it is a
weak point in many outfits. The organizations that deliver
the best quality training provide basic training on the
company itself, as well as the technological fundamentals of
specific positions.
Retention
Retention is all about keeping people employed despite the
lure of retirement or headhunters or being lost through
inadequate opportunity.
If your organization excels at bringing in top talent, but
cannot retain them, there is an enormous cost that can
be avoided. After all, it is hard to replace the experience
or know-how of a 30-year veteran. Thus it is important to
target retention efforts at specific skill sets and age groups.

c h a i n

that some veterans’ knowledge is far more valuable than
others. But how can you tell the difference?
A workforce analysis relates existing skill sets to
organizational efficiency. If one impending retiree worked
in an area that had performed consistently badly for a
decade, why capture that knowledge?
Instead, find those veterans who operate in highly effective
portions of the organization and tap their brains for the
benefit of future generations.
Process optimization
Process optimization is an area that invades the other zones
such as recruitment, development, and retention.
By optimizing the organizational processes, each element of
the workforce supply chain is made to function correctly.
If processes are flawed, after all, knowledge capture will be
ineffective and recruitment resources will be squandered.
Thus process optimization plays a fundamental role.
Strategic role
The value of achieving an end-to-end understanding of the
different facets of the workforce supply chain is evident
once you inspect each one within a given company.
It will be found that one or more elements are neglected
or omitted entirely by companies suffering from personnel
stress. This will prove illuminating when engaged in the
setting of workforce strategy.
In order to determine the best course, then, a company’s
efforts are best served by conducting an in-depth analysis
of the workforce as a whole. By carrying out a workforce
analysis, it becomes possible to set the right priorities and
plan out the most appropriate remedial actions.
When it comes to nonretirement attrition, for instance, it
isn’t enough to tackle it generally. A hit-or-miss approach
might end up consuming time and resources without
results. A workforce analysis determines exactly which
workers are most at risk. In one company, for example,
research data revealed that most personnel tended to
leave after 2–7 years of service. Armed with a specific
breakdown of personnel most at risk, it is possible to
initiate the correct program.

28

Such a workforce analysis goes far beyond the scope of
a traditional training needs analysis. It spans the entire
spectrum of the workforce supply chain—from recruitment
through retention, knowledge capture, and process
optimization. It correlates the relationship between business
needs and workforce requirements, as well as attrition risk
to organizational skill levels. In addition, it helps to identify
which knowledge it is most important to capture, as well
as specific skill development and process improvement
priorities for the organization. Instead of viewing the
workforce in intangible terms, a workforce analysis presents
the entire picture in a workable framework and in terms of
ROI.
Without this in-depth analysis, the likelihood is high that
the company will engage upon a direction that may not
bring about a long-term resolution. Companies in the
industry, after all, have adopted all manner of programs
over the past decade or so. While some worked, many
weren’t appropriate to the situation.
Utility example
Take downsizing in the utility sector. Major turbine
maintenance used to be conducted by large in-house
crews. A 1,000-MW plant, for example, might have had
75 to 100 full timers in maintenance alone, and many
of these were 20-year veterans. They were typically
supported by another crew of about 30 people for dayto-day maintenance duties. This brought stability, and
what came with it was a climate of long lead times and
slow budgeting.
That’s all changed over the past decade or so. The internal
crews have all but disappeared. In their place are a couple
of supervisory staff whose job it is to keep an eye on
outsourced engineering teams. Financing and scheduling
have become more frantic. It’s no wonder that short-term
planning tends to dominate and longer-term projects, such
as regional transmission upgrades, rarely get the attention
they merit.
Workforce analysis beneﬁts
The remedy is to have an accurate estimate of the current
business environment. The key to correctly solving any
organizational problem is to fully and comprehensively
understand where the workforce currently stands. This
helps companies to zero in on the knowledge gaps that
will exist when employees retire and how well that

knowledge is being trapped before it walks out the door
for the final time.
A workforce analysis also helps companies to accurately
measure the capability of its workforce, determine if
internal processes are capable of supporting company
expansion, and ensure that training provides the exact skills
needed to impact business performance. And it answers
that all-important question: Who do we really need to hire?
A workforce analysis, then, is of material assistance in
quantifying workforce challenges, forecasting future
capabilities, and identifying the relationship of the
workforce to actual business needs. It is both a strategic
and tactical tool set that is designed to isolate the specific
organizational skills and the depth of knowledge that
currently exist and to relate specific skills to the business
reasons for each performance requirement of the job
position. It determines strengths and weaknesses of
the workforce; key areas of required training, process
improvement, and knowledge capture; the current depth
of knowledge within each job class and the organizational

c h a i n

learning rate; and a strategic focus on the skills and
knowledge gaps that are most important to the successful
operation of the organization.
The resulting analysis provides a specific action plan for
closing present skill gaps and preventing future gaps before
they occur. The process has been utilized in union as well
as nonunion environments and for technical, professional,
and other fields.
Further, it must be realized that a workforce analysis
should not take an eternity. The entire process can be done
competently and conclusively in about 6 weeks.
And management is armed with exactly what it needs
to act with precision. In one company, for example,
the analysis uncovered worker uncertainty as the
underlying issue. Operations or maintenance employees
on average were found to have less than 50% of full
certainty for all skills within their job position. The
workforce analysis homed in on this area, breaking
skill level certainty down further in terms of position.

Thus management received a report outlining the
relative levels of certainty for each section of the plant
and every position, how those certainty levels would
vary over time, which skills were most in danger, and
the areas of the plant in most need of attention. The
findings were then correlated with statistics of problem
frequency to determine knowledge capture, skill
development, and process improvement priorities.

By understanding every facet of the workforce supply
chain, management has it in its power to transform a

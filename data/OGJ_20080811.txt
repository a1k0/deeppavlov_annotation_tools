Coup threatens Mauritania’s oil, gas industry
Mauritania’s nascent oil and gas industry, already under threat
from the al-Qaeda terrorist organization, is facing more uncertainty following a bloodless coup staged by Army commanders.
The coup began when President Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi
fired the country’s top four military officials. According to reports,
the officials had been suspected of supporting lawmakers who had
accused the president of corruption and disagreed with his efforts
to reach out to Islamic hard-liners.
Abdallahi was detained by presidential guard units and held
against his will at the presidential palace compound. Meanwhile,
a military junta, which took over state radio and television, announced the formation of a new “state council,” led by Gen. Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, one of the four generals fired earlier in
the day.
A US spokesman issued a statement condemning “in the strongest possible terms” the Mauritanians’ military’s overthrow of the
democratically elected government of Mauritania, while European
Union Development Commissioner Louis Michel said the president should be quickly released and returned to his post.
In July, Malaysia’s state-owned Petronas said it obtained positive
results from its exploration program in Mauritania when a well
drilled 2 km away from its original Banda-1 discovery confirmed
the existence of “significant” quantities of oil and gas.
Petronas said further exploratory work will be necessary to determine the overall size of the reservoir, but gas resources could be
in excess of 1 tcf. Around the same time, al-Qaeda’s North Africa
network said it planned to attack interests held by the US, which
it said was establishing military bases and seeking control of the
region’s energy sources.

China establishes new energy agency
China’s National Development and Reform Commission
(NDRC) established a new nine-department government agency,
the National Energy Administration (NEA), to secure energy supplies.
Lin Boqiang, an economics professor at Xiamen University, said
the consolidation of agencies under NEA signals that China will
focus more on energy strategy and planning for sustainable development.
Of the nine merged departments, four were in charge of separate
energy sectors, while the other five were involved in policy, develop-

ment planning, energy conservation, and international cooperation.
Responsibility for domestic pricing of energy will be shared by NEA
and NDRC. NEA will make proposals concerning price adjustments
but will need approval from NDRC and the State Council, while
NDRC will consult NEA when it adjusts energy prices.
Apart from pricing, however, NEA will assume NDRC’s responsibilities in several other key areas to include charting energy strategy and policies as well as managing separate sectors for oil, gas,
coal, electricity, nuclear, and renewable energy.
NEA will manage China’s strategic oil reserves, including building and releasing such reserves and supervising the management
of commercial reserves.
The new agency will have approval of the biggest overseas investments in energy resources and will negotiate and sign energy
contracts with foreign governments and institutions.
The Chinese government announced plans in March to create
a bureau to integrate energy management, marking the first time
it has established a central organization to deal with energy issues
since dissolving the ministry of energy in 1993.

Trinidad and Tobago audit shows 30.8 tcf of gas
An audit of Trinidad and Tobago’s natural gas reserves for 2007
shows that the country has 30.8 tcf of gas.
The audit, conducted by Ryder Scott Co., was presented to the
Caribbean twin-island nation’s standing committee on energy. It
shows proved reserves as 16.997 tcf, probable reserves at 7.883
tcf, and possible reserves at 5.888 tcf. The audit shows a rate of
reserves to production ratio of 13 years.
In presenting the audit, Ryder Scott Senior Petroleum Engineer
Larry McHalffey noted that there had been a virtual 100% replacement of reserves for 2007. He said, “What this means is: for the
entire [year of] 2007, all the gas used in Trinidad and Tobago was
replaced. This is a positive sign for Trinidad and Tobago.” Ryder
Scott put Trinidad and Tobago’s annual gas use at 1.3 tcf.
The audit also places the Caribbean island’s exploration potential of an additional 31.253 tcf.
The figures do not take into account the recently announced
discoveries made by PetroCanada and Canada Superior. McHalffey
said Ryder Scott also did not consider the Trinidad and Tobago offshore ultradeep water in assessing the exploration potential. Trinidad and Tobago’s ultradeep has not been explored but is expected
to be bid in 2009. ✦

would be 20,000-30,000 b/d. This is expected to rise to 100,000
b/d in 2010.
Tupi, which holds an estimated 5-8 billion bbl of oil reserves,
is challenging because it is in a frontier presalt reservoir deeper at
2,100 m than discoveries in the Campos basin and farther in distance: 300 km vs. 150 km for Campos.
Consequently, Tupi also poses logistical difficulties in accessing
the deposit, and Petrobras faces rising costs in a tight services market. Petrobras is keen to focus its personnel on developing the field
quickly, which could boost Brazil’s current 14 billion bbl oil and
gas reserves by more than 50%.
The country’s president has established a group to investigate
whether a separate oil company should develop Brazil’s subsalt reserves. It will present its proposal within the next few months,
Gabrielli said. He is a member of the group.
Last year, Petrobras announced a business plan of $112.4 billion
for 2008-12, but this did not include Tupi. Gabrielli said the company would have to increase its borrowing, and new figures would
be unveiled in September or October. Petrobras expects to order 28
new drilling rigs during 2013-17.
Gabrielli told investors the company plans to produce 1.95 million b/d of oil next year, and production will rise to 2.42 million
b/d in 2012 and 2.81 million b/d in 2015.

The recently completed Charlson 11-16H well, in Williams
County, ND, was brought on stream July 23 at an initial production
rate of 1,106 boe/d through 7-in. casing.
Fort Worth-based Encore has a 96% working interest in the well.
The company owns 10,400 net acres in the area.
The company plans to add a third rig to drill Bakken and Sanish
wells in August. Upon arrival of the additional rig, Encore plans to
drill a Sanish well in its Cherry Creek prospect.

Maurel & Prom discovers oil in Gabon

Maurel & Prom has tested 5,510 b/d of oil from the Omko
exploration well that was drilled 6 km east of Onal field in Gabon.
M&P expects to appraise the discovery by yearend, depending on
rig availability.
Oil was produced from two separate intervals, the Kissenda and
the base sandstone. Kissenda, more than 56 m, reached 3,050 b/d
through a 40⁄64-in. choke with a 595 psi head pressure. Base sandstone, more than 43.5 m, produced 2,460 b/d through a 32⁄64-in.

In both cases, the oil is 35.7-36.7° gravity, M&P said. The

Chevron starts production from Agbami oil ﬁeld
Chevron Corp.’s Nigerian affiliate, Star Deep Water Petroleum
Ltd., has started oil production from Agbami field off Nigeria.
Chevron, which said first oil flow from Agbami field was
achieved July 29 from a floating production, storage, and offloading vessel, expects initial production to reach more than 100,000
b/d of oil.
It expects production at the field—the largest deepwater discovery in Nigeria—to increase to 250,000 b/d of oil and natural gas
liquids by yearend 2009.
Star Deep Water Petroleum signed the agreement in 2005 to
award the contract for the construction of the FPSO vessel for Agbami to South Korea’s Daewoo Shipping & Marine Engineering
Corp.
In January 2000 then-Texaco Inc.—since acquired by Chevron—announced the completion of testing on the Agbami-2 appraisal well, which confirmed that “the Agbami structure is a giant
discovery with potential recoverable reserves in excess of 1 billion
boe.”
It said that “the well test surpassed expectations and, together
with other technical data, suggests that the Agbami discovery likely
ranks among the largest single finds to date in deepwater West Africa.”

According to Texaco, the Agbami-2 well delineated the discovery announced in January 1999. The initial well, Agbami-1, encountered 420 ft of oil pay in multiple zones. Complete appraisal
of the field will require further delineation drilling and technical
studies.

Apache, EGPC JV lets Salam gas plant contracts
Khalda Petroleum Co., a joint venture of Apache Corp. and
Egyptian General Petroleum Corp., let a contract to Petrofac Ltd. for
engineering and procurement services for an additional gas train
at the Salam natural gas plant on Apache’s Khalda Concession in
Egypt’s Western Desert.
The new facility, expected to come online in late 2010, will be
Khalda’s fifth gas processing facility at Salam. It will be built next to
the third and fourth Salam gas trains, now under construction.
Apache earlier awarded Petrofac contracts totaling $375 million to construct the third and fourth trains, each of which will
have the capacity to process 100 MMcfd of gas and 14,000 b/d of
condensate.
In November 2006, Apache reported that EGPC and Egyptian
Natural Gas Holding Co. had approved construction of the fourth
processing train at the Salam plant.
Apache said the fourth train, along with the recently apOil & Gas Journal / Aug. 11, 2008

proved third train, would increase the capacity to process gas from
Apache’s Jurassic formation gas reserves to 710 MMcfd of gas and
66,000 b/d of condensate, including access to processing capacity
at Shell’s Obaiyed plant.
At the time, Apache said gross production from its Jurassic fields
was “512 MMcfd of gas and 18,200 b/d, the limit of existing processing facilities.”
Petrofac last month said it had acquired production engineering
firm, Eclipse Petroleum Technology Ltd., for an initial £7 million,
with a further payment of as much as £16 million to be determined by “the level of future profitability.” Eclipse will form part
of Petrofac’s facilities management.

StatoilHydro delivers oil to FPSO from Vilje ﬁeld
StatoilHydro has delivered first oil from Vilje field in the Norwegian North Sea to the Alvheim floating production, storage, and
offloading vessel. The field is estimated to hold 52 million bbl of
recoverable oil.
Production from Vilje is expected to reach a plateau of 35,000
b/d by the end of second quarter.
Marathon Petroleum Norge AS operates the FPSO, which is connected to the field via a 19-km pipeline. The field has two subsea
templates and two production wells.
StatoilHydro operates Vilje with a 28.85% interest. This is the
first StatoilHydro-operated field on the Norwegian Continental
Shelf that is tied in to an installation operated by another operator.

Processing
Idemitsu Kosan upgrades Chiba, other reﬁneries
Idemitsu Kosan Co. will spend ¥16 billion to upgrade the
45,000 b/d fluid catalytic cracking unit at its 220,000 b/d Chiba
refinery east of Tokyo.
In the face of declining market rates for its fuel oil, the firm
aims to increase production of naphtha and propylene, while decreasing production of heavy fuel oil.
After the upgrade, due for completion in April 2011, the unit’s
production of heavy fuel oil will be reduced by 200,000 kl./year,
while its production of naphtha and propylene will increase by
260,000 kl./year.
In May, Idemitsu Kosan Co. sold 30,000 tonnes of heavy grade
fuel oil for loading in early June, described by company and trading sources as likely to be its first spot sale of the fuel in 3 years.
Sources said that Chiba was running at nearly full capacity then
and that stocks were high. They said such a rare export compounded pressure on an Asian market already “awash” with supply due to
weak Chinese demand.
At the time, the price spread between fuel oil and Dubai crude
worsened to minus $27.15/bbl from minus $26.80/bbl, more
than doubling year-on-year from the 2007 level of $13.55.
Last November, Idemitsu Kosan Co. said it planned to triple its

subsidiary of Diamond Offshore Drilling, for the charter of a third
drilling rig.
The Ocean Quest semisubmersible rig, under a 2-year contract,
will be used in the Santos basin from the second half of 2009.
OGX said the rig can drill as deep as 7,600 m in water as deep as
1,100 m.
OGX last week announced it had contracted two other offshore
drilling rigs from Diamond Offshore for 3 years. It said the two
rigs also would be used for drilling in the Campos basin as of the
second half of 2009.
According to reports, OGX broke an earlier contract signed with
Queiroz Galvao Oleo e Gas, a unit of the local industrial conglomerate Queiroz Galvao, for the charter of the Alaskan Star semisubmersible drilling rig.
In early July, OGX announced the signing of a 3-year charter of
the Alaskan Star, which Queiroz Galvao Purfuracoes SA purchased
in 1995 from Western Co., Houston, for $11.7 million.
Shortly after OGX announced the signing of the Alaska Star,
Brazilian federal police raided the home and offices of company
founder Eike Batista in a probe of alleged fraud and tax evasion.
OGX said the investigation has no relation with the company’s operations and does not represent any adverse effect on its business
plan.
Founded by Batista in September 2007, OGX was listed on Sao
Paulo Stock Exchange Bovespa in June. According to reports, its
initial public offering, one of the biggest ever on the Sao Paulo
market, was oversubscribed five times.
OGX is said to hold concession rights in some 21 blocks in the
Campos, Santos, Espirito Santo, and Para-Maranhao basins. Company plans call for some $1.3 billion investment in the blocks. ✦

capacity to export refined products at Chiba and at its 160,000 b/d
Aichi refinery.
Reports said the refiner wants to export a combined 3 million
kl./year of jet fuel, gasoil, and gasoline, up from current capacity of 1 million kl./year, by reforming pipelines and revamping
switching pumps.
After revamping the Chiba and Aichi facilities, Idemitsu Kosan
plans to expand the export capacity of its 140,000-b/d Hokkaido
refinery and 120,000-b/d Tokuyama refinery.

Pemex ﬁnds more reﬁneries, pipelines needed
Mexico’s Petroleos Mexicanos, in a study released to the country’s Congress, has underscored the need for additional refining resources or, lacking them, additional pipelines within the country.
Pemex said construction of a 300,000 b/d refinery in Tula in
Hidalgo state would provide the greatest net present value. In addition to the $8.17 billion cost of the refinery itself, investment in
associated infrastructure would be $852 million.
The proposed refinery also would require construction of a new
$769 million oil pipeline from Nuevo Teapa to the Chicontepec
region, while a further $64 million would extend to a new multipurpose pipeline to eliminate bottlenecks.
The study suggested other possible locations for a refinery, in-

cluding a 300,000 b/d facility in Tuxpan, in Veracruz state, which
is supplied at the moment by refineries in Tula and Salamanca with
some support from the Salina Cruz refinery.
The Pemex study considered other sites for a new refinery, including Campeche in Campeche state; Manzanillo in Colima state;
Lazaro Cardenas in Michoacan state; Cadereyta in Nuevo Leon state;
Salina Cruz in Oaxaca state; Dos Bocas in Tabasco state; and Minatitlan in Veracruz state. Absent a new refinery, the Pemex report said,
Mexico will need to invest some $1.61 billion in central and western Mexico for a number of new pipelines to complement existing
distribution systems.
The suggested lines include: a 310 km, 24-in. pipeline from
Tuxpan in Veracruz state to Tula in Hidalgo state; 327 km of 18-in.
from Tuxpan to Puebla to Valle de Mexico; 241 km from Tula to

Hellenic lets reﬁnery upgrading contracts
Hellenic Petroleum SA has awarded engineering, procurement,
and construction management contracts to Foster Wheeler Ltd.
for an upgrading project at the company’s refinery at Thessaloniki
in northern Greece. The scope of the project is the production of
low-sulfur fuels, which also results in significant environmental
improvements.
Foster Wheeler’s scope comprises a 15,000 b/sd continuous
catalytic reformer, modification of the existing atmospheric distillation unit in order to switch the operation from high- to low-sulfur crudes and revamp the existing naphtha hydrofiner and crude
light ends processing unit to increase the refinery’s processing capacity to 26,000 b/sd for light products.
The project is expected to be completed by yearend 2010. ✦

Alaska lawmakers grant gas pipeline license

YPFB, Transredes start laying GCC gas line

The Alaska Senate on Aug. 1 approved a state license for TransCanada Corp. to pursue federal certification for a 1,715-mile natural gas pipeline from the Alaska North Slope to the Alberta Hub in
Canada.
The Alaska House of Representatives approved the measure last
month (OGJ, July 28, 2008, Newsletter).
Gov. Sarah Palin praised the legislature’s work, noting that this
is a first step, and that it does not guarantee pipeline construction.
The license is being awarded under the Alaska Gasline Inducement
Act. The Senate voted 14-5 in favor of granting TransCanada the
license. Under AGIA, TransCanada was one of five companies that
applied and the only one that satisfied the guidelines, Palin said
previously.
Meanwhile, BP PLC and ConocoPhillips are working on a pipeline proposal called Denali. They announced Apr. 8 plans to build a
4 bcfd gas pipeline that would extend from the ANS to Canada and
potentially on to the US (OGJ, Apr. 14, 2008, p. 30).

After earlier delays, Bolivia’s state-owned Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB) and recently nationalized gas transporter Transredes began construction of the 130 MMcfd Gasoducto
Carrasco-Cochabamba (GCC) natural gas pipeline.
The $170 million GCC line will consist of 250 km of 16-in.
pipe extending from the gas-producing region of Carrasco to the
city of Cochabamba.
GCC is to help solve gas supply restrictions for the industry in
Cochabamba, La Paz, Oruro, and Potosi arising from the insufficient capacity of the Gasoducto al Altiplano (GAA).
In May, it was reported the pending construction of GCC would
be delayed by up to 90 days due to the nationalization of Transredes.
On June 2, the Bolivian government took over TR Holdings, the
holding company that owned half of Transredes. TR Holdings was
controlled by Royal Dutch Shell PLC (50%) and Ashmore Energy
International (50%).
After the takeover, which gave YPFB 97.378% of Transredes, the
Bolivian government said it would pay AEI and Shell $48/share for
their interest in TR Holdings. The two firms reportedly are considering plans to sue the Bolivian government.
Meanwhile, to calm uncertainty over the fate of the company’s
projects, Transredes’ incoming president and director Gary Daher
Canedo said in June that the firm would still meet its investment
and expansion commitments.
As part of YPFB, Canedo said Transredes would “prioritize” the
GCC construction project as well as the extensions of the existing
GAA and Gasoducto Villamontes-Tarija (GTV).
In May, before it was nationalized, Transredes had already completed phase two works on the GVT, raising its capacity to 13.8
MMcfd at a cost of $23.5 million.
Last November, Bolivia’s President Evo Morales inaugurated the
phase three expansion works of the GAA, which will connect to
the GCC, increasing its transport capacity to 32 MMcfd from 27
MMcfd. ✦

Shell declares force majeure after Nembe attack
Royal Dutch Shell PLC declared force majeure on its export commitments at its Nigerian Bonny Light terminal after Nigerian militants damaged its Nembe oil trunk pipeline in the Niger Delta.
The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND)
claimed responsibility for the attacks on two pipelines early on July
28 that forced Shell to shut in the line fed by two smaller lines.
According to Nigerian reports, the main pipeline transports
130,000 b/d of oil to export terminals.
The company did not say how much oil production is reduced
or how long it would take to restore supplies. Its force majeure
announcement spans July to September supply contracts, but the
volume of oil covered is unclear.
The loss is likely to exacerbate already high crude prices. Militants have so far cut Nigeria’s output by almost a quarter to pressure the federal government to increase the level of oil revenue
given to their communities and reduce their poverty.

Warming or cooling?
The first thing to be aware of is that
the warming effect of carbon dioxide
is strongly logarithmic. Of the 3° C.
that carbon dioxide contributes to the
greenhouse effect, the first 20 ppm has
a greater effect than the following 400
ppm. By the time we get to the current level of 384 ppm, each 100 ppm
increment will produce only about 0.1°
of warming. With atmospheric carbon
dioxide rising at about 2 ppm per annum, temperature will rise at 0.1° every
50 years.
If that is true, you will ask, how does
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) get its icecap-melting
figure of 5° for doubling of the preindustrial level to 560 ppm? An equation
called the Stefan-Boltzman equation
tells us that in the absence of feedbacks,
doubling would produce a rise of 1°.
The IPCC climate modeling assumes that
the feedback from this rise will be positive; that is, that the extra heat will cause
more water vapor in the atmosphere,
which in turn will cause more heat to
be trapped, and the system compounds
away until 1° gets turned into 5°. As
described, the Earth’s climate would be
tremendously unstable, prone to thermal
runaway at the slightest disturbance.
The real world evidence says the opposite. In late 2007, a Dr. Roy Spencer
of the University of Alabama published
a paper analyzing data from the Aqua
satellite. Based on the response of tropical clouds, Dr. Spencer demonstrated that
the feedback is negative. He calculates a
0.5° warming for a doubling of the preindustrial carbon dioxide level. Global
warming is real, but it is also minuscule.
Atmospheric temperature rose 0.7° in
the 20th century; it has also fallen by
the same amount in the last 18 months.
Global warming, as caused by carbon
dioxide, will be lost in the noise of the
system.
If carbon dioxide didn’t cause the
warming of the 20th century, what did?
Well, a good place to start is the sun.
In the 20th century, the sun was more
active than at any time in the previous
8,000 years. But what is happening
now suggests that it will soon be much

quieter. Two Danish researchers, FriisChristensen and Lassen, demonstrated in
a 1991 paper that there is a correlation
between the length of a solar cycle and
the temperature during the following
solar cycle. The longer a solar cycle, the
cooler the following solar cycle, and visa
versa. In 1996, Butler and Johnson demonstrated the same relationship on climate data from the Armagh observatory
in Northern Ireland. I have extended that
to the 400 year Central England temperature record, the De Bilt data from
Holland, and a number of temperature
records from the northeastern US. In the
latter, the relationship is that each 1-year
increase in solar cycle length will cause a
0.7° decline of atmospheric temperature
during the following cycle.
Solar cycles are normally 11 years
long. We are currently near the end of
Solar Cycle 23, which started in May
1996. It is now just over 12 years long.
The previous cycle, 22, was a short one
at 9.6 years. The differential is now 2½
years, which equates to a temperature
decline of 1.7°. This is in the bag. The
way that Solar Cycle 23 is declining,
combined with the very weak rampup of Solar Cycle 24 sunspot activity,
suggests that the month of solar cycle
minimum will be July 2009. If that
transpires, the cooling will amount to
over 2°.
That last time that something like
this happened was a period called the
Dalton Minimum from 1796 to 1820.
This was caused by the very weak Solar
Cycles 5 and 6. They were preceded by
the very long Solar Cycle 4, which was
13.6 years long. There were quite a lot of
crop failures due to cold weather during
the Dalton Minimum. That is why there
is so much interest in sunspot activity
at the moment. Each day’s delay in the
month of solar minimum will make the
second decade of the 21st century two
thousandths of a degree colder. That
doesn’t sound like much, but we may
have another year to go.
A little-discussed consequence of the
coming doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide level is the effect on plant
growth. Wheat yields have already risen
15% due to the 100 ppm rise from the
preindustrial level. Doubling will cause

a 50% increase in yield, with similar
effects for all other crops. In summary,
global warming is real but minuscule,
there is a big solar-driven cooling coming in a few short years, and increased
atmospheric carbon dioxide is wonderful for plant growth. It therefore follows
that burying or trying to limit such a
wonderful substance is exactly wrong in
science.

Changing for climate change?

Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
Last month the UK’s broadcasting
regulator, Ofcom, cleared Channel 4
of “materially misleading the audience
so as to cause harm or offense” on its
television documentary challenging
the theory that man-made activities are
causing global warming.
Channel 4, a mainstream commercial
broadcaster, ran the program in March
2006. It claimed that man-made global
warming was a conspiracy and a fraud.
There was outcry from environmentalists, scientists, and the public. One
group sent Ofcom 176 pages of detailed
complaints, arguing that the film seriously misled viewers.
Ofcom carried out a 15-month
investigation and concluded that in the
last portion of the program Channel 4
did breach the rules of impartiality on
the impact climate change policies were
having on developing countries. It also
felt that senior high-profile government
scientists had been misrepresented
because of questionable editing of their
quotes. Essentially, Ofcom said that it
could not rule on the matter of accuracy because this was not a news program
where the standards were different.

Verdict slammed
Critics have slammed the verdict as
perverse because they were unhappy
with the factual inaccuracies, and they
stress that Ofcom’s narrowing definition

of harm to actual rather than potential
is ludicrous.
This incident has been interesting to
follow because it has highlighted the
media’s powerful role in circulating
information in an impartial, balanced,
and fair way regarding the causes of climate change. How much space should
be given to the view that the drivers of
global warming are other than manmade? Do editors push journalists to
pursue these alternative perspectives in
writing copy or broadcasting material?
One scientist told me that journalists
within British Broadcasting Corp. who
wanted to write about these analyses
were not encouraged to do so.
The primary fear is that promoting these viewpoints would discourage
people from changing their behavior
to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and
invest in energy efficiency. This era of
the oil and gas industry is unique. High
energy prices and rising inflation mean
that many people are struggling to meet
daily living costs. Saving the environment is the last thing on their minds
when analysts in the UK are predicting
that energy bills could increase by 40%
by the end of the year.
According to a survey by Ernst &
Young in March, around 60% of respondents did not agree that their home
energy bills needed to rise to combat
climate change. The opinion poll said
that 67% of the sample was not prepared to pay anything extra on home
energy bills over the next 12 months to
help combat climate change.
But this revelation on environmental
apathy is not surprising when people
are peeved about cost increases and
inconvenience. Global warming campaigners feel that public education is
crucial to triggering behavioral change.

But mustering a sense of urgency is
difficult when the threat is abstract or
slow-moving. Opinion poll data show
high levels of awareness but no sign of
behavioral shift apart from switching of
light bulbs and small steps in recycling
If anything, according to a survey
initiated by the Environmental Transport
Association, environmental apathy is
rife. Thirty percent of people felt there
was too much coverage in the media
about CO2 emissions, and over half
were “bored hearing about it.” Men are
twice as likely as women to be bored by
coverage about CO2 emissions.

Two minds
Research company Ipsos Mori said
in its June report surveying the British public’s attitude to climate change:
“The research also finds the public
caught in two minds: despite large
numbers backing government action
[on climate change] two in five (41%)
acknowledge that they are worried this
might lead to restrictions on the things
they want to do.” And, of course, there
is the fear that the government may
use the global warming agenda to raise
taxes.
For Nick Eyre, senior research fellow
at the Environmental Change Institute
at the University of Oxford, a change
in policy approach can help the public
reduce its energy demand. Communitybased initiatives, an emphasis on userfriendly feedback, and linking advice to
support for action have been some of
the recent developments.
But changing behavior will coincide
with changing technology to see significant demand reduction. The question is: Who will take responsibility for
it? ✦

Acting—again—on energy
For a baffling array of bad reasons, the US Congress produced, before starting its 5-week recess,
one beneficial proposition on energy along with
a baffling array of wrong proposals, one of which
would annul the lonely right one. This may be all
anyone should expect from a body that has passed
two wayward energy laws in the past 3 years.
At least offshore leasing has new life as a political issue and receives attention in new House
and Senate bills. In neither case, however, does
the effort go far enough. The Senate measure
would allow federal oil and gas leasing off several
eastern states but make it subject to state approval,
a 50-mile buffer zone, and federal-state revenue
sharing. It also would extract $30 billion from oil
and gas companies to help fund $84 billion in
government support for noncommercial energy
and conservation adventures.

Big spending
The House bill is more ambitious about Outer
Continental Shelf leasing but still leaves decisions
to coastal states. Instead of taxing oil companies,
it would spread half the proceeds of the new
leasing among various “reserves”: $208 billion
for conservation, $260 billion for environmental
restoration, $390 billion for renewable energy,
$130 billion for nuclear waste and carbon capture
and sequestration, and so forth. Spending like that
can buy a lot of votes.
The direction is clear: OCS leasing where it’s
prohibited now—but in a package that, after political deals are made, probably would raise taxation of oil companies and waste billions of public
dollars on popular but mostly hopeless energy
projects.
This lunacy makes clear that the US political
class lacks the capacity for rational thought on
energy. The deficiency, moreover, is bipartisan.
Republicans are right to want to expand OCS
leasing. But they’ve linked the issue to public
anxiety over high gasoline prices. Where were they
when action on OCS leasing might have meant
something to today’s fuel prices?
Democrats, loath to upset environmentalists,
skirt the issue by pointing out that new leasing
would have no immediate price effect. But they
can’t make the point without getting even weirder
than Republicans.

“The Republicans propose to give away public
lands to big oil, which will not immediately
reduce the price at the pump and save Americans
only 2¢ 10 years from now,” said House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi of California. Notice the assumption,
which echoes a statement by Sen. Barack Obama
(D-Ill.), the Democratic presidential nominee-inwaiting: To lease federal acreage for exploration
and development is to give something away to oil
companies.
That’s just stupid. There’s no nice way to say it.
Elected officials should know and be willing to
acknowledge that federal leaseholders pay for the
privilege of risking millions of dollars on exploration in hopes of finding reason to invest even
more in development and production, on which
they pay royalties and taxes. But Pelosi and her
party colleagues give further reason to doubt they
know anything about these subjects by offering
the existence of undrilled leases as a reason to
open no more of the OCS.
Republicans have no right to gloat over the
Democrats’ serial displays of energy ignorance.
They controlled both houses when Congress
passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which fattened the government’s role as fuel arbiter and
dispenser of energy subsidies and mandates. A
triumph of that law was the ethanol mandate in
vehicle fuel, now increasingly recognized as a
costly error. Of course Congress expanded the
mandate to ridiculous levels in 2007 after Democrats reclaimed both houses. But Republicans
made the first mess.

More bewilderment
Their bewilderment doesn’t confine itself to
Congress. President George W. Bush lowered the
intellectual standard with his initial proclamation,
in January 2006, that “Americans are addicted to
oil.” No wonder Americans fantasize about energy
independence and an economy devoid of fossil
energy.
So lawmakers stagger yet again toward error
and needless cost—political ballast for part of a
right move on OCS leasing. Meanwhile, voters
can learn much from a gasoline price slump that
started before their elected officials could fashion
a rescue. ✦

Technological advances in producing
and refining liquid fuels in situ using
high-temperature heat from nuclear
reactors can resolve two major problems—dependence on oil from unstable
areas of the world and greenhouse gas
emissions—says MIT nuclear engineer
Charles W. Forsberg.
In a presentation to the International
Congress on Advanced Nuclear Power
Plants (ICAPP 08) in June,
Forsberg proposed the use
of high-temperature heat
(nearly 700° C.) from nuclear reactors to refine (underground) hydrocarbon feedstocks such as heavy oils, tar
sands, oil shale, and coal to
produce light distillates requiring little
additional refining to produce gasoline,
diesel, and jet fuel. Underground refining also could recover remaining oil in
depleted oil fields.
In addition, he said, with major
retrofitting at large refineries, nuclear
energy also could replace in the midterm more-costly natural gas in providing high-temperature heat at existing
refineries and for producing hydrogen
for them in the long term. The hightemperature heat would be used for

distillation and thermal cracking—the
same processes for which it would be
used in underground refining. Several
oil companies are looking at nuclear
options for heat at refineries and for oil
recovery, he said, but retrofitting would
be a serious constraint at many refineries. Although nuclear reactors have low
operating costs, installation is capitalintensive, Forsberg noted.
While oil supplies 39% of US energy
needs, Forsberg said, 149 US oil refineries consume more than 7% of US energy, particularly now that refineries are
processing heavier feedstocks requiring
more energy to refine. As an extreme
case, the production of liquid fuel from
coal consumes almost twice the energy
value of the liquid fuel produced, he
said, making recovery of liquid fuel
from coal and some other fossil fuels
economically unfeasible with existing
technologies if there are constraints on
greenhouse gas emissions.
The heavy oil refining trend also implies large increases in carbon dioxide
releases per liter of liquid transport fuel
produced. These could be greatly reduced by refining in situ, where carbon
residue would remain underground,
sequestered as carbon solids (coal).

gasses easily permeate most reservoirs.
As the temperature further increases,
heavier hydrocarbons will be thermally
cracked to produce lighter volatile hydrocarbons that can be recovered. In effect, heating the underground reservoir
duplicates the distillation and thermal
cracking processes found in a refinery”
(Fig. 1).
This option has become potentially
viable because of three technical developments, he said: “precision drilling,
underground isolation of geological
formations with freeze walls, and the
understanding that the slow heating of
heavy hydrocarbons (vs. fast heating)
increases the yield of light oils while
producing a high-carbon solid residue.”
He said the high temperatures required
are within the current capabilities of
high-temperature reactors.
The environmental advantages of in
situ refining would be the reduction
of toxic heavy metals from the surface
environment by leaving them in the
ground, avoiding the handling of many

said. By comparison, rich coal deposits

A gas study’s
unintended impact

A

ubrey K. McClendon apparently
expected a new natural gas supply study to change the US energy
game plan when he came to Washington, DC, on July 28. It may do just
that, but in a way that probably won’t
please producers seeking more access
to federal lands.
Chesapeake Energy Corp.’s chief
executive officer also is chairman of
the American Clean Skies Foundation, which advocates the use of gas
as part of a sustainable energy future.
The group released a study by Navigant Consulting Inc. that found the
US has 2,247 tcf of gas reserves, or
a 118-year supply at 2007 demand
levels (OGJ, Aug. 4, 2008, p. 30).
Horizontal drilling and other new
technologies have opened supplies
in shale formations over the last 3-5
years, McClendon and Richard G.
Smead, one of the study’s authors and
overall project manager for Navigant,
told reporters at a briefing.
“It’s groundbreaking. The size of
these shale formations is so big it
can’t be ignored,” McClendon maintained.

More than forecast
Smead said the study tried to use
information that’s more current than
what the US Energy Information
Administration uses for its forecasts.
“Every EIA natural gas forecast has
been exceeded by actual production,
with shale gas particularly active in
the last 10 years,” he said.
His researchers spoke to 114
producers controlling 90% of known
North American gas supplies and received responses from 66 about their
estimated resources and anticipated
production. They found that while
26

overall production from unconventional sources has increased over 10
years, production from shale formations grew more than 660% from
less than 1 bcfd in 1998 to about 5
bcfd now.
“Current technology has gone
through decades of change in about
3 years. Every indication is that this is
the least expensive gas we’ll have. The
adequacy of this resource is not an
issue. It is growing and will continue
to grow with the market,” Smead
said.
It’s also more readily available than
what may be produced from areas
which are currently off-limits, McClendon added. Chesapeake is making most of its discoveries by using
new technology to tap formations
beneath old fields previously out of
reach, he said.

Less critical
“I think this makes lifting the Outer Continental Shelf moratorium less
critical. The gas we’re talking about
is in traditional producing areas on
largely private property,” McClendon
said at the briefing.
He did not emphasize that point
when he testified before the US
House Select Committee on Energy
Independence and Global Warming
later that day. But the committee’s
chairman, Edward J. Markey (DMass.), was aware of it.
“If the information in the study is
correct, it takes a lot of pressure off
us to open more of the OCS. This is
something that could happen over
10 years, where Republicans are
discussing an option that would take
30 years,” he told me following the
hearing. ✦

vehicle to retrofit existing cars and
trucks.
The bill’s energy conservation provisions include extending the renewable
energy, carbon mitigation, and efficiency
tax incentives (including the production
tax credit) through 2012; introducing
new tax credits of up to $2,500/vehicle
for consumers to purchase highly fuelefficient vehicles; extending and expanding the $2,500 tax credit for hybrid electric vehicles; and providing $500 million
in funding for R&D into new materials
and other innovations to increase vehicle
fuel efficiency.
Other energy conservation elements
include $2.5 billion for the research,
development, and deployment of “next
generation biofuels and infrastructure”;
tax incentives to install alternative
fueling stations, pipelines, and other
infrastructure; expanding transmission
capacity for electricity from renewable
sources, and new dedicated funding for
weatherization assistance.

More US production
To increase domestic energy production, the Gang of 10’s bill would ensure
that it is “responsible” and “targeted.”
For offshore oil and gas, that means
consulting with the US Department
of Defense to ensure that leasing and
drilling occurs in more of the eastern
Gulf of Mexico consistent with national
security. It means allowing Virginia
(where a 2011 federal OCS lease sale
already is scheduled), North Carolina,
South Carolina, and Georgia to agree to
allow federal leasing off their shores.
A 50-mile environmental buffer
zone would be retained where new oil
production could not take place, and all
new production would have to be used
domestically, according to the proposal.
States that allow offshore production
would receive an appropriate share of
revenues, and a commission would be
created to make recommendations to
Congress on areas to consider for future
leasing.

crease production from existing wells. It
would provide grants and loan guarantees to develop coal-to-liquids plants
with a carbon capture capability (as

of the petroleum fuels their production would be replacing). And it would
support nuclear energy by providing
workforce training and accelerated
depreciation for new nuclear power
plants, increasing the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s staff, and supporting spent fuel recycling R&D.
About $30 billion of the bill’s $84
billion required investment would be financed partly by payments from the oil
and gas industry through actions such
as modifying the Section 199 manufacturing deduction “and other appropriate measures to ensure that the federal
government receives its fair share from
Gulf of Mexico leases,” according to the
group. It said remaining financial offsets
would be finalized after consulting with
the Senate Finance Committee on interaction effects with other legislation.
The Gang of 10 said that it would
not make an energy market speculation recommendation initially because
it was concentrating on supply and
demand issues, but may do so after the
US Commodity Futures Trading Commission issues a report on the subject in
mid-September.

House group’s proposal
HR 6709, the bill developed by
Peterson and Rep. Neil Abercrombie
(D-Ha.) who have cosponsored similar
measures, takes a broader approach in
its energy production section. It would
repeal all federal prohibitions against
spending money for onshore and
offshore leasing and preleasing activities. Leasing within 25 miles of a state’s
coastline would be banned, but coastal
states could authorize production from
25 to 50 miles offshore within 1 year
of the bill’s passage.
The 125-mile oil and gas leasing buffer zone in the eastern Gulf of
Mexico and appropriations bans on oil
shale development would be repealed,

T E R E S T
but the Interior secretary would have
to consult with the Defense secretary to
coordinate any leasing. Unresolved issues could be referred to the president,
the bill says.
It also would repeal a moratorium
on oil shale leasing and prohibitions
on federal agencies from entering into
contracts for an alternative or synthetic
fuel and would allow the use of woody
biomass from federal lands for alternative fuel.
The House group’s bill specifically
allocates shares of the $2.6 trillion it
estimates new offshore leasing would
produce: 30%, or $780 billion, would
go to the US Treasury; 30%, or $780
billion, would go to the affected states;
8%, or $208 billion, would go to a
conservation reserve; 10%, or $260
billion, would go to an environmental
restoration reserve; 15%, or $390 billion, would go to a renewable energy
reserve; 5%, or $130 billion, would go
to a reserve for nuclear waste and for
carbon capture and sequestration, and
2%, or $52 billion, would go to the
Low Income Home Energy Assistance
Program (LIHEAP).

Other provisions
HR 6709’s two other titles deal with
cleaner energy production and conservation incentives and with Strategic
Petroleum Reserve modifications and
dedication of revenues to existing
conservation and energy research programs.
The first of these titles would amend
the federal tax code to provide at least 5
years of tax deductions and incentives
for conservation and renewable energy
projects, including facilities, alternative fuel vehicles and vehicle refueling
property, energy efficient appliances,
nonbusiness energy property, residential
energy-efficient property, a new energyefficient home credit, energy-efficient
commercial buildings, solar energy fuel
cell and microturbine properties, clean
renewable energy bonds, biodiesel and
renewable diesel, and plug-in hybrid
cars.
The other title would modify the

SPR’s supply with a 10% exchange, or
70 million bbl, of its content for lower
quality grades, which are used in a
growing share of US refinery throughput. The estimated $1.4 billion of revenue that would result would be directed
to existing conservation, energy R&D,
and conservation programs, including
$385 million for carbon capture and
sequestration, $170 million for electricity storage and transmission, $110
million for industrial energy efficiency
R&D, $100 million for advanced energy
research projects, $100 million for
LIHEAP, and $65 million for unconventional gas production and environmental research.
The bill was referred to the House
Natural Resources Committee where
one of its cosponsors, Rep. Jim Costa
(D-Calif.), chairs the Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee.
“I believe this combination of increasing supply and reducing demand,
which this bill does, will reduce our
energy costs, along with creating new
jobs,” Costa said at a July 30 press conference with other cosponsors. “Even
more important, this bill provides a
framework for moving us toward cleaner and renewable sources of energy, and
toward energy independence.”
Rep. Thelma Drake (R-Va.) added,
“Now, there is a bipartisan solution on
the table. This bill gives voice to the
beleaguered American public which has
said ‘enough’ and is calling for a comprehensive solution to the energy crisis.
It is my sincere hope that the House
will take up this bill and allow a vote on
the bipartisan energy solution that the
American people are demanding.” ✦

US Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) said
Interior Secretary Dirk A. Kempthorne
has taken “a questionable step” in beginning to prepare a new 5-year Outer
Continental Shelf oil and gas leasing
plan ahead of schedule.
“It is becoming increasingly clear
that [US President George W. Bush]
is set on putting oil rigs off the state
of Florida before he leaves ofﬁce in
January, regardless of the fact it will
have no effect on energy prices. The
president’s plan for lifting the quarter
century ban on offshore drilling has
been called ‘cruelly misleading,’ and
rightly so,” Nelson said in a July 31 letter to Kempthorne.
“You and he both know exploiting our coastlines won’t bring down
gasoline prices. In fact, a recent report

prices,” he maintained.
Nelson said the secretary, who
announced on July 30 that he was
beginning preparation of the next
5-year OCS leasing plan 2 years earlier
because of higher crude oil and natural
gas prices, took the “highly unusual
step” when the current plan has been
in operation “only a little more than 1
year.”
“Existing federal law established
a ban on such preleasing activities.
Public Law 109-432 prohibits any leasing, preleasing, or other activity east of
the Military Mission Line in the Gulf of
Mexico—until June 30, 2022,” he wrote
Kempthorne.
Nelson said the real answer to
record-high gasoline prices is the

calling for is drilling as close as 3 miles
off of America’s pristine beaches and in
other protected areas.”
US Senate Majority Leader Harry M.
Reid (D-Nev.), noted: “If the president
truly cares about Americans paying
record-high energy prices to fill their
tanks and heat their homes and wants
to make them more secure, he can
release oil from the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve, accelerate production in the 68
million acres already open for drilling,
open up new leases in areas that are not
environmentally protected, crack down
on greedy oil traders who artificially inflate energy prices, and support efforts
in Congress to extend renewable energy
tax credits that spur investment in clean

energy sources. Unfortunately, he has
shown no interest in doing anything
but continuing more of the same failed
policies that have produced the highest
oil and gas prices ever.”
Congressional Republicans continued to press Pelosi and Reid (D-Nev.)
to allow votes on proposals to remove
leasing bans on the OCS and elsewhere
before Congress recesses on Aug. 1.
House Minority Leader John Boehner
(R-Mo.) said, “The American people
understand that the only ones standing
in the way of lower [gasoline] prices
are the Democrats in charge of Congress. Rank-and-file Democrats have a
choice this week: Vote to leave town
for 5 weeks, or join us in demanding
a vote.”

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said, “The Democrat leadership has already tried to take us off
this issue four times in the last 5 days.
About eight in 10 Americans disagree
with them. The American people think
$4/gal gasoline is a crisis that must be
dealt with now.”
After the House formally voted to
adjourn a week earlier than originally
scheduled, Republican Conference
Chairman Adam Putnam (Fla.) said
Democrats “should be held in contempt
for voting to skip town without dealing
with America’s energy crisis,” adding, “Democrats are out of touch, out

Iran threatens to close Straits of Hormuz with missile launch
Eric Watkins
Senior Correspondent
The Iranian government, in a standoff with the United Nations Security
Council over its “inalienable right” to
develop nuclear power, has threatened
to use a newly tested short-range missile to close the Straits of Hormuz, if
necessary.
“No enemy vessels would be able to
escape it within a 300-km radius from
the borders of Iran,” said Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, commander of the country’s Revolutionary Guards, referring to
a new Iranian-built antiship missile.
The Straits of Hormuz, described by
the US Energy Information Administration, as a major “choke-point” of world
oil shipping, sees about 17 million b/d
of crude oil.
To avert an attack by the US or its
allies in the region, Iran has repeatedly
threatened to exert its control over the
waterway. Underlining the international
stand-off, the US has pledged to keep the
shipping route open.

Threat follows talks
Jafari’s threat followed talks between
Iran and the representative of six world
powers which ended on Aug. 4 without
resolving the international dispute row
over Tehran’s nuclear work.
The West fears Iran aims to build
nuclear warheads under cover of a civilian program. Tehran denies the charge,
32

saying that it nuclear program aims at
mastering the technology needed to
generate electricity, not bombs.
The UN Security Council has imposed three sets of limited penalties on
Iran since 2006, but the Iranian government remains undeterred in its efforts
to secure the technology it claims to
need. Indeed, Iranian officials claim the
sought-after technology is a national
right. “Enrichment is Iran’s inalienable
right,” said an Iranian foreign ministry. “When it comes to our inalienable
rights, we will press ahead.”
US and European Union officials
stated that the telephone conversation
with Iran on Aug. 4 was “not conclusive.” They accepted a pledge by Tehran
to provide a written response by Aug. 5
to the latest offer by the EU and US.
While accepting the offer of a
1-day delay, however, Western officials
vowed further steps if the response
was unclear. “We agreed in the absence

of a clear, positive response from Iran
that we have no choice but to pursue
further measures against Iran as part of
this strategy,” said US State Department
spokesman Gonzalo Gallegos.
Following talks between the two
sides in mid-July, Western officials had
set an informal deadline of Aug. 2 for
Tehran to respond to their offer to
refrain from steps to impose more UN
sanctions if Iran froze expansion of its
nuclear work.
In particular, world powers offered
to start prenegotiations during which
Tehran would add no more uraniumenriching centrifuges and in return face
no further sanctions.
But Tehran dismissed the idea of
freezing its uranium enrichment program, and a week later Iranian President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that his country already had 5,000-6,000 uraniumenriching centrifuges. ✦

competition with food production, according to the review.
Under the UK’s Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO), which
came into effect in April, 2.5% of fuel
sale volumes must be from biofuels
(OGJ Online, Apr. 15, 2008). The
level of the obligation is due to rise to
3.75% in April 2009 and 5% in April
2010. Ruth Kelly, transport secretary,
said the government would consult
stakeholders about making changes
later in the year.
However, the UK will also push for
the European Union to ensure that its
10% renewable transport fuels target for
2020 is conditioned upon sustainability
and without significant impacts on food
prices.
The government said it would “press
that the sustainability criteria for biofuels, currently being negotiated, should
address indirect, as well as direct, effects
on land use.”
Critics have called for a moratorium
on biofuels because they are unsustainable and are contributing to higher
food prices, but Gallagher rejected this
approach arguing that it would “reduce
the ability of the biofuels industry to
invest in new technologies or transform
the sourcing of its feedstock to the
more-sustainable supplies necessary to
create a truly sustainable industry.”
Clare Wenner, head of transport biofuels at the Renewable Energy Association, said that proposals did not give the
industry consistent, reliable, and longterm targets. “However, no progress will
be made unless there is investment in
production and research.”
Alwyn Hughes, chief executive of
Ensus, which is building a wheat-based
ethanol plant in northeast England,
was “concerned” at the government’s
change in approach to existing commitments under the RTFO.
“We think this is unnecessary when
sustainable production can already be
achieved,” Hughes said. “Such a move
would only serve to jeopardize the industry’s ability to deliver the substantial
benefits that are possible.” ✦

Morskaya-1 was drilled to a depth
of 2,082 m in less than 2 m of water.
A significant amount of cores, wireline

logs, and reservoir fluid samples has
been acquired.
The Morskaya structure straddles the
license boundary on the east side of
the Lagansky block and the adjoining
acreage controlled by the Caspian Oil

Southwestern Energy’s Fayetteville output nears 500 MMcfd
Southwestern Energy Co., Houston,
said its gross operated production from
the Fayetteville shale play area in northcentral Arkansas was 500 MMcfd of
natural gas, including 12 MMcfd from
14 wells producing from conventional
reservoirs.
The company has 857,000 net acres
in the play. The production rate a year
ago was 200 MMcfd.
The company projected that estimated ultimate recovery could be
improved by 15-20% from horizontal
wells on which it has employed closer
perforation cluster spacing. It tested the
technique on 38 wells in the first half
of 2008 and plans to use it on all of its
wells the rest of the year.
The company, running 22 rigs in
the play, is drilling longer laterals
generally and plans to test spacing of
80 acres or less later in 2008. It said its
knowledge of how to drill and complete wells in the shale is “consistently
improving.”
Southwestern placed 83 wells on
production at an average 2.54 MMcfd
in the quarter ended June 30, compared with 58 wells at 1.26 MMcfd
in the quarter ended Mar. 31, 2007.
Lateral length averaged 3,562 ft vs.
2,104 ft.
For the quarter ended Mar. 31, 2008,
when 75 wells went on production,

those 75 wells averaged 2.15 MMcfd
after 30 days, and 72 of the wells averaged 1.93 MMcfd after 60 days.
The company had drilled and
completed 619 operated wells, 554
of them horizontal, as of June 30. The
wells produced 29.6 bcf of gas in the
quarter ended June 30 at an average
realized price of $8.17/Mcf. The wells
are in 33 pilot areas in eight counties
in Arkansas.
Southwestern hired 69 employees

in the quarter, most of them in the E&P
segment.
Other public companies with substantial acreage or operations in the
play include Chesapeake Energy Corp.,
XTO Energy Inc., Petrohawk Energy

the positive feedback is that interaction
between management and drillers, as
well as among colleagues, is perceived
as being good in all of the companies.
Another positive factor is that several
companies have outlined measures to
respond to identified issues.
Based on the drillers’ own perception, some issues remain regarding the
drillers’ daily work, related to:
• Workload and responsibility.
• Management.
• Competence and understanding of
risk.
• Procedures—formulation and
compliance.
• Physical design of the drilling area.

time pressure, they assess their own efforts as supervisors to be good. They are

Shell’s experience with a Norwegian semisubmersible
Norske Shell AS used the Ocean
Vanguard semisubmersible, operated
by Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc.
(DODI), to work in Draugen oil ﬁeld, on
Haltenbanken, in the Norwegian North
Sea (northeast of Njord and Ormen
Lange ﬁelds).
According to Norske Shell’s Callum Smyth, the company needed to
do major servicing on some of the
older wells. He said the drilling crews
showed character despite the problems
encountered in the ﬁeld and that the
work was done efﬁciently. Because of
the crews’ adaptability, “with all parties
pitching in to make the job both safe
and successful…the Vanguard has now
proven itself as a completions rig.”

‘Excellent teamwork’
Before the rig came to Shell in summer 2006, the Diamond Offshore crew
had never performed completion operations with the unit. According to Shell,
all companies involved—Diamond

the right time. Drillers feel that there is
room for improvement in this area.
Another aspect of the technical systems is the visual displays. The feedback
from drillers is inconsistent in this
area. A majority respond that the visual
displays provide support and assistance
and that they provide a good overview
of the operation. In spite of this, nearly
half the drillers feel there is too much
information to deal with. They also
experience that the drilling system provides too many opportunities to change
variables in the displays, so that the
information is not consistent.
The mix of old and new systems on
several facilities means that drillers must
deal with multiple systems with considerable differences in how information is

presented. Coordination of the systems
(e.g., a review of how information is
presented) can help achieve a manageable volume of information, as well
as fewer units of measurement to deal
with.
Several other publications provide
guidelines for the evaluation of alarm
and drilling systems.3 4
The companies proposed several
measures in connection with physical
aspects and the drilling systems:
• Map the physical design of drillers’
cabins on all rigs together with drilling
personnel and personnel with expertise in ergonomics and human factors. Based on that mapping, make the
necessary improvements to satisfy the
requirements in NORSOK S-002.

The offshore crews have worked
well together, illustrated by the results
(three wells back in service) as well as
the quality and quantity of the daily
safety focus (STOP, TOFS, JSA’s, etc.).

Result
The Ocean Vanguard rig worked
with Norske Shell for 98 days in 2006.
The resulting four wells returned to
service, contributing about 3,000 cu
m oil equivalent, which is 20% of the
Draugen total daily production.
The E1 well is online and producing
500-750 cu m/day oil, ready for gas lift.
The SWIT wells are both running with
a total of 21,000 cu m/day combined
injection (maximum rate from pump)
with a reduced back pressure (20 bar
lower due to the larger tubing) and full
integrity on the annulus and tubing.

• Map the user-friendliness of the
drilling systems to see which systems
do not meet current requirements,
including alarm requirements. What
should be done to achieve systems that
support the driller in his-her work?
• Review the alarm system, focusing
on which functions the driller should
handle, and what information is necessary in order to safeguard these functions.

Understanding risk
The responses from the drillers indicate that most feel their own
understanding of risk is good. As work
supervisors, the drillers also believe that
they are able to ensure that the personnel working for them have a good un-

nies, there were three areas for improvement highlighted by drillers:
• Simulator training (beyond training in pressure-control simulator).
• Seminars in which the team trains
together.
• Courses related to professional
disciplines.
The degree of training and followup of new employees varies among
companies. About one third of drillers
state they rarely receive training in local
conditions when they arrive on a new
facility and only half say that they have a
1-week overlap on new facilities.
Companies proposed several training-related measures:
• Give personnel an opportunity to
work as extra personnel in connection

companies is also perceived as being

show a somewhat lower score.
An important follow-up question to
which the survey does not provide a
clear answer is what drillers include in
the term “understanding of risk.” Is it
a clear understanding of the entire risk
picture, both the risk associated with
the work taking place on the drill floor
and the risk associated with the operation down in the well?
One reason to question drillers’
understanding of risk is that the results
of the survey show that more than 20%
report they often do not have time to
carry out a safe job analysis (SJA). Some
drillers also say that SJAs do not help to
bring attention to what is important for

to assemble them in and outside of Alberta for Phase 2. In Phase 1, it obtained
the equipment globally but conducted
fabrication and assembly in Alberta.
Unlike Phase 1, which had two main

the company for Phase 2 plans to have

To start Phase 2 construction, Nexen
wants more clarity on the regulations
for carbon capture so that it can include

Model predictive control (MPC)
has become the de facto standard for
implementing advanced control strategies. Ensuring that implemented MPC
applications continue to perform well
and deliver expected benefits requires
a combination of appropriate monitoring technology and best practices
for maintaining the advanced control
applications.
This article reviews
some of the key issues
in monitoring and
maintaining advanced
control applications.
Maintaining highperformance multivariable control applications is a difficult problem that involves
different groups of individuals and
work processes. This article describes
the problem in an industrial context
and presents some best practices for
monitoring advanced control applications.

benefits, however, may not be sustained
unless appropriate steps are taken to
monitor and continuously adapt advanced process control (APC) performance to changing conditions. The
appropriate steps involve a combination
of the right measures and work processes to detect, diagnose, and remedy any
significant performance degradation of
the APC application in real time.

Advanced process control
Since their inception in the early
1980s, multivariable model-based
controllers have become the technology of choice for implementing APC
applications. More than 5,000 applications exist worldwide and this number
continues to increase.1
Many commercial technologies use
model-based predictive control. The
common theme among the different
technologies is the presence of a model
of the process. The model lies at the
heart of the controller and has a great
deal of influence on its performance.
Adoption and implementation of
APC technology significantly improves
the economics of a process. Table 1
summarizes the savings in production
costs expressed as a percentage of production costs.2
Benefits associated with advanced
control are due to reducing variability
in key process variables through multivariable model based control and subsequently operating at the most profitable constraints through a constrained
optimization scheme that is often a part
of the APC application (Fig. 1).
Fig. 1 shows that once the application is commissioned, various reasons
may cause the APC application to move
away from an economic optimum. This
results in deterioration of the benefits
from the advanced controller.
Based on our experience in commissioning and supporting many APC
applications during the past 20 years,
some of the main reasons for this deterioration include:
• Lack of APC resources.
• Lack of operator training.
• Changes in process dynamics.

• Inability to quantify APC performance.
• Inability to link APC benefits to

• Lack of APC best practices.
• Inability to visualize model quality.
• Inability to visualize and assess
performance of the supporting cast: PID
controllers, valves, and inferentials.
• Inability to rationalize and explain
APC behavior in real time.
• Lack of management support.
This article gives a broad overview of
the most commonly encountered issues
and best practices when companies try
to sustain performance of their APC
asset base. We have shown examples
wherever possible to illustrate these
issues.

APC
Implementation of an APC application in an operating facility has an immediate positive effect in many ways.
Fig. 2 shows that APC reduces variability in key operating parameters
by moving that variability to available
manipulated variables.
This reduction in variability may, in
and of itself, be valuable, but reducing
variability creates an opportunity to
shift the operating point of the process
closer to limits and constraints. This
shift is normally the key contributor
to value delivered by APC applications
(Fig. 1). A recent survey of industrial
practitioners and vendors indicated that
the economic assessment of advanced
control applications is still ad-hoc.3
Moving and holding to this new operating point changes the performance
requirements of many other aspects
of the business. If these changes in

performance are not achieved, benefits
delivered by the APC application will be
less than its potential.
These elements include:
• Instrumentation. Faulty instruments
will increase instability or cause part or
all of the APC application to be turned
off, or otherwise reduce the value that
the application delivers. Ensuring the
application delivers full value requires
improved identification of instrumentation issues and modified prioritization
of repair efforts to account for this
effect.
• Computer systems. Issues with computer hardware, software, or networks

will prevent communication between
the APC application and the process.
This will directly reduce application uptime. Adding APC and control monitoring systems also increases the number
of systems that must be maintained. It
may also increase the complexity of the
system maintenance problem.
• Process. Many aspects of the process
will reduce the application’s effectiveness. Some of these include unmeasured
or infrequently measured limits, unmeasured disturbances, process behavior changes (such as heat exchanger
fouling, or catalyst decay), and process
modifications.

Practical solutions to slow global warming
Whilst the world discusses the climate change and its consequences,
Linde has been developing concepts to significantly reduce energy
consumption and greenhouse gas emission in existing ethylene plants.
One of Linde’s innovative solutions is to replace the furnace section of a
cracker during a turnaround and thus install state-of-the-art technology in
an existing plant without any production loss.
This new Linde furnace technology reduces greenhouse gas emissions
while increasing yields and substantially improving reliability and economic efficiency.
Other innovative concepts customized to individual plant requirements are
available from Linde, the leading ethylene technology contractor.

Having understood the reasons
for unsatisfactory
performance, one
often must prioritize and make
those changes
to the controller
or process that
will result in the
improvement of
performance without excessive cost
or effort.

Performance monitoring
Measurement of APC performance is
a nontrivial problem. Three key aspects
of APC performance include variability,
constraint performance, and model
performance.

Variability
Variability is an important measure
because it is the basis on which APC
applications are implemented. It is important to ensure that the multivariable
controller reduces variability up to the
level anticipated in the initial estimates.
A multivariable controller is able to
derive benefits by operating the unit
against the right constraints. It is important, therefore, to monitor active constraints and ensure there are sufficient
degrees of freedom for the controller.
Lastly, the model is at the heart of
the predictive controller and is the
single most important tuning parameter. Tracking model performance and
ensuring that it is satisfactory ultimately
ensures good health of the controller.
Variability is a commonly used
approach for establishing variability

measurements relative to a historical
baseline data set. Before commissioning, a historical baseline is selected.
Typical estimates of the reduction in
process variability due to multivariable
control are about 50%.
After commissioning, the variability (i.e., standard deviation of key
controlled variables) is compared to
the baseline and improvements noted.
Postcommissioning variability then
becomes effectively the new benchmark
for further comparison. The expectation
from any application is that it achieves

at least the postcommissioning variability.
Seasonal changes account for longterm patterns in underlying variability. For example, summer conditions
may often mean a distillation column
is cooling limited and variability is
higher. In technical terms, there are two
benchmarks that are considered here:
open-loop variability, prior to controller
commissioning; and closed-loop variability, postcontroller commissioning.
A shortcoming of using absolute
variability as a benchmark is its dependence on underlying process disturOil & Gas Journal / Aug. 11, 2008

stability, and controller uptime is of
concern to this group.
• Plant manager. The plant manager
has a reason to be concerned if the
controller uptime is unsatisfactory and
the controller is not achieving process
stability.
• Production engineer. The responsibility
of the production engineer is to achieve
the production targets that have been
set by the planning and scheduling
team and the plant manager. Safety is a
key priority for this individual. He or
she tends to be concerned with the APC
application if it is engaging in behavior
that, for example, cuts feed rates and
compromises the production targets or
is causing off-spec incidents resulting in
emissions or off-spec product. Operators or shift supervisors usually provide
this information.
• Process engineer. A process engineer is
involved in the application’s design to
ensure that key variables are included
and the controller targets the “optimal”
constraints. At some sites, a real-time
optimizer (RTO) layer may sit above
the APC layer and send targets and set
points.
The process engineer wants to
ensure the APC application is achieving
the target changes that may be sent by
the RTO every few hours. The process
engineer may also become involved in
troubleshooting if the underlying process behavior is causing a problem with
the application.
• Technical, process control manager. This
group is concerned with application
uptime and benefits. One of the other
groups, if necessary, will bring to its
attention issues requiring additional

resources. If the process, for example,
has undergone some changes recently
and a full step test is required to update
the plant models, this group will be
involved in justifying the resource allocation.
• Process control engineer. Any issues
observed by the rest of team are important to the process control engineer.
In addition to controller uptime, active
constraints, and process stability, the
process control engineer is also the one
who is concerned about the “why” part.
This means that things like process
variability relative to a benchmark,
cycling in the controller, degrees of
freedom available, constraint give ups,
underlying PID controller performance,
inferential and analyzer performance
model performance, operator interactions, tuning problems, and process
nonlinearities that affect application
behavior all become important to this
individual because he has the responsibility for addressing these issues.
• Instrument and electrical technician. This
person only gets involved if an issue
raised by one of the other people needs
to be addressed to recover APC performance. An example is a sticky valve or a
malfunctioning sensor or analyzer. This
group needs information on the diagnostics pertaining to the instruments
and valves that have been flagged.

Next week’s concluding article will
describe black powder’s physical and
mechanical properties and presents a
summary and brief discussion of various black powder management methods.

Background
Most sales-gas pipeline operators
experience black powder.1-6 It occurs in
several forms, including a wet tar-like
substance (Fig. 1) or a dry, fine powder (Fig. 2). Black powder occurs in
both recently commissioned and older
sales-gas transmission pipelines. It can
contaminate the customer sales-gas supply, either interrupting the customer’s
operations or reducing the quality of
the customer’s products.
Black powder can also harm gas
pipeline operations themselves, leading
to instrument-scraping delays, reduced
inline inspection accuracy, control valve
erosion, and flow reduction.
Black powder additionally poses
a potential health and environmental
hazard, with mercury and naturally
occurring radioactive materials such as
Pb-210 present in some samples. Iron
sulfides are also potentially pyrophoric.
Such materials require special procedures for handling and disposal of any
removed black powder.

source; corrosion of the internal walls
of the pipeline. More specifically, reactions of iron (Fe) present in ferrous
pipeline steel with condensed moisture
containing oxygen (O2), hydrogen
sulfide (H2S), and carbon dioxide (CO2)
form black powder.
The perceived absence of condensed
water in dry gas pipelines often leads
to an underestimation of the internal
corrosion risk.1 7 Under normal conditions, gas pipelines are under minimal
corrosion risk. It is not, however, possible to eliminate water from pipelines
completely.7 Water vapor can condense
on the inner walls of the pipeline due
to high dewpoints. It can also enter the
pipeline through periodic upsets that
cause moisture carryover. This water,
coupled with corrosive species such as
CO2, H2S, and O2, even in amounts as
low as ppm levels, can result in unexpected internal corrosion and the
formation of corrosion products such
as FeCO3, FeS, and iron oxides, respectively.1 5
These components are benign in dry
gas but become corrosive in the presence of condensed water.1

Black powder more often manifests itself as a dry, fine powder, as pictured here
(Fig. 2).

The small amounts of elemental

from oxidation inside the pipeline of
small amounts of H2S or FeS caused by

to internal corrosion of these pipelines.
An in-house conventional cultivation
medium analyzed a limited number of
the collected black powder samples for
sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB), general
aerobic bacteria (GAB), and nitrogenutilizing bacteria (NUB). Analysis in the
US at GTI also sought acid-producing
bacteria (APB) and iron-oxidizing bacteria (IOB). SRB, IOB, and APB bacteria
cause microbiologically induced corrosion (MIC) of steel in the presence of
condensed moisture (water).1
Test results showed microbial corrosion to be a low-potential black powder
source, caused most likely when it did
occur by APB or IOB. The absence of
SRB in black powder collected from
sales-gas pipelines agrees with the
absence of FeS in the chemical composition of black powder. The absence
of SRB in black powder collected from
sour gas also identifies naturally occurring H2S reactions with the steel
pipeline as the source of iron sulfide
(Equations 4-5).

Images from the new system show sample of digital flow profile (left), high temperature distributed temperature sensing well monitoring (middle), and flow
profile of high and low injectivity zones (right).

New real time digital well ﬂow proﬁling sysytem
This new real time digital flow profiling system is designed to aid increased
production, reduce operating costs, and
improve recovery.
The system is suited for these well
types:
• Conventional and complex.
• Multilateral.
• Intelligent oil or gas producer-injector.
• Long horizontal.
• Ones with infrequent or no produc-

tion logging technology (PLT) deployment.
The firms says its system provides
continuous PLT-type data in deviated and
complex wells without the costs, risks, and
deferred production issues associated with
conventional logging techniques. As well
as monitoring the flow distribution in production and injection wells in real time,
the system also provides information often
not accessible with traditional production
logging technology, the company notes.
Zonal flow allocation is determined using Sentinel distributed temperature sens-

ing (DTS) technology. With a resolution of
0.01° C. every 1 m along the wellbore, the
Sentinel system is usable in wells where
other permanent monitoring solutions fail
to identify thermal events, the company
points out.
The ability to provide updates every
10 sec also allows transient events to be
analyzed, providing a new dimension in
DTS interpretation.

THE REMAINDER

September 30 – October 2, 2008
Hilton Fort Worth
Fort Worth, Texas USA

UNCONVENTIONAL GAS EXTRACTION BECOMING VIABLE
Production from unconventional reservoirs — tight gas sands, shales, and coalbeds--accounts for a large and growing share of total gas
supply. But the reservoirs are complex. The costs of drilling into and completing wells in them are continually rising while presenting unique
environmental problems. Producing gas from unconventional reserves proﬁtably, safely, and in amounts demanded by the market requires
increasingly sophisticated recovery methods.
Gas recovery from unconventional reserves will be explored on September 30 – October 2, 2008 at the
Unconventional Gas International Conference & Exhibition to be held at the Hilton Fort Worth, in Fort Worth,
Texas. Planned by the editors of Oil & Gas Journal and an Advisory Board of industry experts, the event will
highlight innovation from unconventional gas plays around the world.

Doha’s collapse
will cut energy
use the hard way
Adherents of the minimalist approach to
energy consumption have much to cheer in
the collapse July 29 of the Doha Round of
trade negotiations.
After all, anything that suppresses
economic activity also crimps the use of
energy and whatever environmental consequences come with it. To the minimalist
camp, every reduction in the use of energy,
especially hydrocarbon energy, advances

T h e

humanity. Failure of the Doha Round
negotiations, over a special safeguard
mechanism in farm products for developing
countries, will suppress economic activity.
That doesn’t have to mean disaster.
During most of the nearly 7 years since
the Doha Round began, trade has ﬂourished, and the global economy has mostly
expanded.
A world trade agreement is neither essential to trade nor the only type of agreement possible. Doha’s collapse doesn’t
preclude new regional or bilateral deals.
Furthermore, as World Trade Organization ofﬁcials were quick to assert, the latest
stalemate doesn’t mean the round is ﬁnished. The outlook, though, isn’t cheery. If
anything, protectionism, especially involving farm products, is hardening.
China and India, with growing populations beginning to reap the fruits of
industrialization, have received blame for
holding fast to their farm subsidies. But Europe and the US were hardly magnanimous
in this area.
In the US, in fact, Congress seems to
have turned hostile toward trade in general
and farm trade in particular. Earlier this
year, it overrode a veto of a farm bill loaded
with subsidies and blocked a trade agreement with Colombia using a rules change
that has hurt US creditability on trade
issues.
While a stalled Doha Round need not be
disastrous for the global economy, it surely
won’t help. Trade beneﬁts economies and
fosters development. An agreement lowering barriers would boost trade and thus
stimulate economies.
So even if the world’s economic system
stays healthy without a successful and fair
outcome from the Doha Round and despite
high energy prices and other troubles, it’s
reasonable to think it would have become
healthier with one.
That’s one way to conserve energy. But
it’s a tough way. Ask anyone who’s chronically hungry.

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

July was bad for oil
US crude dropped $15.92/bbl in July for the biggest dollar loss in a single month
since it began trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On July 31, benchmark
US light, sweet crudes fell more then 2% to $124.08/bbl, marking “the worst month
for oil (in percentage terms) since December 2004, though oil is still up 29% year-todate,” said analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc.
“US gasoline demand is down an alarming 3.5% this year, though the global
demand picture still looks brighter,” said Raymond James analysts. However, Paul
Horsnell, Barclays Capital Inc., London, said the oil market has been “behaving fairly
rationally and efﬁciently” in recent months. “Having ﬁrst gone through something
of a short-run overshooting of prices in the wake of supportive news ﬂow and some
temporary market dynamics, an efﬁcient correction has been made. The move back
down in prices has been orderly, not a bubble bursting, and is a gentle adjustment
back to a price range whose potential long-term equilibrium has not really been
subject to much in the way of investigation and testing.”
Horsnell expects volatile oil prices through August due to geopolitical and economic pressures. Crude rebounded Aug. 1 after Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shaul
Mofaz said Iran may be nearing a breakthrough in its nuclear program, fanning fears
of a preemptive strike by US or Israeli forces.
Iran did not respond to the Aug. 2 United Nations deadline to halt its nuclear
program.
Prices will likely ﬂuctuate in a fairly wide range before escalating again in coming months but are not likely to fall to a far lower trading range. “A large part of the
reason for that is the global market balances. The demand side of the market does
not seem to be quite as soft at the global level in reality as it currently is in market
sentiment,” Horsnell said
He sees temporary “demand reaction” to current high energy prices rather than
the extensive demand destruction of the 1970s. Meanwhile, he said, “Non-OPEC supply is still the mouse that does not roar, and its trajectory is still disappointing relative to consensus expectations. Indeed, further down the line, we are increasingly
coming to the conclusion that the potential pace of decline of non-OPEC supply after
2010 is likely to become a matter of some concern for the market.”
The Energy Information Administration reported the ﬁrst decline in US gasoline
inventories in 5 weeks, down 3.5 million bbl to 213.6 million bbl in the week ended
July 25. “The gasoline demand season is slowly coming to an end (vehicle miles
drop seasonally in September),” said Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland. “Stocks of gasoline usually draw during the month of August, and based on
normal patterns it should be expected to see further gasoline draws in the next 4
weeks.”
Jakob said, “We usually do not pay much attention to the jet kerosine number [in
the EIA weekly report], but jet demand [for] the 4 weeks is down 5.2% from a year
ago and at the lowest level for that time of the year since 1998. Airlines had been
grounding some of their capacity to offset the price increase of jet fuel, and this is
starting to show up in the demand numbers and provides a strong increase in the
days of cover for jet fuel.”
Asian demand
For the ﬁrst time this year, imports of crude into “the four main Asian
countries”—China, Japan, India, and South Korea—were lower in June than for the
same period a year ago, Japan’s imports were reduced because of reﬁnery maintenance and declining demand for petroleum products. Japanese domestic sales
were down 5.5% from a year ago, including an 8.9% drop in gasoline sales. “Crude
oil imports were still higher from a year ago in emerging Asia and for the ﬁrst half
of the year are in line with the increased reﬁnery run levels,” Jakob said. “India’s oil
product sales in June were ofﬁcially reported up only 0.4% vs. a year ago, which is a
ﬁrst warning sign.”
Jakob said, “The big question mark for the global supply and demand remains
the levels of Chinese product imports once the closing ceremony of the Olympic
Games is over.”
He said, “Asian-4 reﬁnery runs increased during June mainly due to an increase
from China more than offsetting a drop in Japan and South Korea. Chinese imports
of diesel reached a record high on Olympic stock-building while net imports of fuel
were cut in half from May.”

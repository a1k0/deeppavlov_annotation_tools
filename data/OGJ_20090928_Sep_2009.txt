COVER
The hydraulic fracturing equipment is on the Nadel & GussmanJetta Operating Co.’s Franks 17 No. 2 well that is completed in the
Haynesville shale, north of Shreveport, La. Hydraulic fracturing is
one of the technologies that has allowed for the economic exploitation of the vast gas resources contained in shales, as discussed in
two articles in OGJ’s special report on trends in unconventional gas,
starting on p. 39. Photo from Halliburton.

IHS Herold: Hofmeister wants independent agency
John Hofmeister, former president of Shell Oil Co., wants
the US to come up with a comprehensive approach to energy
and the environment rather than using one that’s politically
driven.
Speaking on Sept. 22 at the IHS Herold Pacesetters Energy Conference in Greenwich, Conn., Hofmeister called for the implementation of an independent regulatory agency for energy policy.
He envisions something similar to what the Federal Reserve has
been for banking.
He suggests a federal energy resources board that would have
its own rules, its own funding, and an appointment process independent of election cycles.
“If we fail to take the politics out of energy, we are going to
zig-zag our way into the future,” Hofmeister said. “Energy is too
important to leave to everyday politics.”
He noted that eight presidents and 18 Congresses have promoted US energy independence while oil imports have continued
to grow in the last 35 years.
“We have yet to get a grip on what it means to be a modern
country regarding energy and environment,” he said.
Currently, Hofmeister is founder and chief executive officer of
Citizens for Affordable Energy, a grassroots organization seeking
to educate the public about energy.

IHS Herold: Markets to have ‘moderate’ recovery
Prices for light, sweet crude are expected to average $67/bbl
during 2010, a spokesman said Sept. 22 at the Pacesetters Energy
Conference.
Oil prices dropped to about $35/bbl during February and
have since rebounded with reports of improving global economic
growth. Jim Burkhard, managing director of the IHS CERA’s (Cambridge Energy Research Associates) Global Oil Group, believes that
oil demand in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development nations likely peaked in 2005.
“We’re not going to get back to that (oil) demand level again,”
Burkhard said, which means potentially less upward pressure on
oil prices, primarily because oil demand in OECD nations continues to shrink.
The reasons behind lower oil demand include rising fuel economy standards in many countries and the penetration of alternative fuels, Burkhard said.
Sara Johnson, IHS Global Insight managing director of global
macroeconomics, said the US real gross domestic product is beginning to recover, but she expects unemployment rates will continue to rise going into next year.
“Beware of early 2010,” Johnson said, adding that she expects
to see the start of job creation toward the end of the first quarter

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

and beginning of the second quarter. “Don’t expect a strong ‘Vshape’ recovery in the US.”
The US dollar will depreciate and demonstrate more weakness
through 2012, she said.

IHS Herold: Global reserves fall in 2008
Oil and gas companies’ 2008 global investment for exploration
and development projects totaled $492 billion—a 21% increase
from 2007—yet oil and gas reserves fell, according to a report
from IHS Herold Inc. and Harrison Lovegrove & Co. Ltd.
In the latest annual upstream performance review, the two
companies reported that high oil prices during most of 2008
helped industry to generate record cash flow of $590 billion, up
36% from 2007. Report highlights were discussed Sept. 23 during
the Pacesetters Energy Conference.
Industry’s 2008 cash flow exceeded capital spending by $100
billion. Cash flow per boe increased 35% from 2007 to $29.66/
boe. Last year marked the second consecutive year cash flow exceeded investment, the report said.
The 2009 Global Upstream Performance Review is an annual
analysis of 232 oil and gas companies based on reports filed with
the US Securities and Exchange Commission and other similar
agencies worldwide.
“It is a very capital-intensive job to maintain reserves,” said
Nicholas Cacchione, IHS Herold senior vice-president and codirector of equity research. He expects reserves probably will drop
in 2009 unless finding and development costs see a dramatic decline.
In 2008, world oil reserves declined nearly 3%, primarily due
to a 5.2 billion bbl decline in revisions that stemmed from reduced commodity prices. Natural gas reserves grew by 3%, the
same as the past 5 years. Gas production accelerated nearly 5% to
44.2 tcf.
Reserve replacement costs surged to $23.44/boe, up 70%, while
finding and development costs rose 66% to $25.50/boe, due to a
sharp drop in positive reserve revisions. Reserve additions, both
from all sources and via the drillbit, were down over 20%.
During 2008, worldwide oil and gas revenues were $1.2 trillion, but net income was constrained by rapidly rising depreciation charges. Net income for 2008 was just under $310 billion.
Spending for proved reserves dropped 30% to $44 billion as
merger and acquisition activity collapsed during the last 5 months
of 2008, particularly in the US and Canada. Competition for unconventional resources was up sharply, led by US gas shale plays.
Global spending for unproved reserves more than doubled from
2007 to $62 billion. ✦

McMoRan drilling ultradeep gulf shelf prospect

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

the right to proceed with two additional wells by contributing
75% of the costs of the second and 65% of the costs of the third.
For PPL268, Talisman will assume an interest and operatorship
of 15% by reimbursing NGE for 50% of past costs ($2.17 million)
and funding an agreed seismic program up to a maximum of $5
million.
Talisman will be able to gain a further 35% by funding 80%
of the costs of drilling, completing and testing a well. It can gain
another 20% interest by funding 100% of two more wells.
NGE has decided not to farm out its third permit in the region
(PPL267) and expects to drill a well on its Panakawa prospect before yearend.
Talisman’s interests in PNG also include ownership of Rift Oil,
which also has permits in the western province and a farm-in to
nearby permits held by Horizon Oil.

McMoRan Exploration Co., New Orleans, is setting intermediate casing at 23,500 ft, below a salt weld, at a proposed 28,000-ft
ultradeep shelf prospect as part of its Gulf of Mexico exploration
program.
McMoRan reentered a wellbore on South Marsh Island Block
230 in 20 ft of water south of Vermilion Bay. The Davy Jones
prospect involves a large ultradeep structure on four blocks. The
company will deepen the well to test Eocene Wilcox, Paleocene,
and possibly Cretaceous Tuscaloosa.
Working interests in the prospect are expected to be McMoRan
25.7%, Plains Exploration & Production Co. 27.7%, Energy XXI
15.8%, Nippon Oil Exploration USA Ltd. 12%, W.A. “Tex” Moncrief Jr. 8.8%, and a private investor 3%.
Meanwhile, McMoRan plans to kick off a second sidetrack
shortly at its Blueberry Hill deep gas prospect in 10 ft of water
on Louisiana State Lease 340. The initial well and a first sidetrack
established a 190-ft vertical hydrocarbon column, and the second
sidetrack is to identify an optimum production take point.
McMoRan plans an updip sidetrack of the Hurricane Deep well
on the southern flank of the Flatrock structure on South Marsh
Island Block 217 in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Logs at the Hurricane Deep 226 well, drilled to 20,712 ft true
vertical depth in early 2007, indicated an exceptionally thick upper Gyro sand totaling 900 gross ft, the top 40 ft of which were
hydrocarbon-bearing. McMoRan believes the updip sidetrack
could intersect a thicker hydrocarbon column.
McMoRan recompleted the Flatrock-5 well in September for
production of 65 MMcfd of gas equivalent, bringing total output
from five of the six Flatrock field wells to 265 MMcfed. Flatrock-4,
shut-in in August due to a wellbore mechanical issue, is to return
to production in the fourth quarter.
McMoRan plugged as noncommercial the Sherwood deep gas
exploratory prospect on High Island Block 133. TD is 17,000 ft.

Delta Petroleum Corp., Denver, said its plans for further drilling in the southern Columbia River basin in Washington state
have been placed on hold until the company reviews completion
and test information from the Gray 31-23 well, where tests have
proved noncommercial thus far.
Delta perforated and tested the majority of the prospective
zones in the Gray well at 11,580-12,280 ft.
“The six lowermost zones demonstrated high pressures as expected, but have flowed only fresh water to date. The zones located further uphole have flowed a combination of water and gas;
however, the gas volumes have been minimal and substantially
below precompletion expectations deeming these intervals uneconomic,” the company said.
More tests are planned in the basalt section on intervals that
had gas shows during drilling.
Delta and Husky Energy Ltd. hold 50-50 interests in 424,000
net undeveloped acres in the basin.

Talisman consolidates in Papua New Guniea

Aegean to start second phase at Epsilon field

Talisman Energy Inc. has consolidated its foothold in Papua
New Guinea by farming into Sydney-based New Guinea Energy
Ltd.’s (NGE) onshore western province permits PPL 268 and PPL
269.
NGE announced in July 2008 that it had reached an agreement
with a multinational oil company, but refrained from naming the
company until the farm-in agreement had been finalized.
For permit PPL 269 NGE will assign an initial 50% interest and
operatorship to Talisman. Talisman will then reimburse NGE for
75% of the direct costs of past expenditure—about $5 million—
and fund an agreed seismic program up to a maximum of $6 million as well as comit to drilling, completing and testing a well up
to a maximum of $15 million.
NGE will also have the option of progressively assigning up to
an additional 20% interest in the permit based on the decisions
over its funding share in the second and third option wells to a
maximum of $15 million/well.
If NGE chooses to remain at 50% interest, Talisman will have

Aegean Energy SA and Kavala Oil SA will use the Ensco85 (E85)
jack up rig to start the second phase of its drilling program in Epsilon field off Greece with what would be the deepest and longest
well ever drilled there.
The program, which calls for drilling in the Gulf of Kavala
about 8 km west of Thassos Island and 18 km south from the
main coast, was approved by the Greek Ministry of Development.
The well will be spudded by the end of September. It is expected
to reach a TVD of 5,500 m and vertical depth of 2,900 m within
90 days.
Aegan Energy secured $50 million from Standard Chartered
Bank to underpin its program and hired Schlumberger to provide
drilling management services.
The 2,000-hp E85 rig is capable of a maximum drilling depth
of 7,600 m.
Last month Aegean Energy completed the PNA-H3 horizontal well on Prinos North field in Greece, which reached a TD of
4,370 m over 135 days because of the reservoir’s complexity. It

World’s first acoustic optical fiber installed

No further exploration is planned on the Camamu-Almada basin block, whose exploration license has expired, said Norse Energy Corp. ASA, Oslo, which holds 10% interest. Petrobras holds
35% interest, and Brazil’s Queiroz Galvao Perfuracao holds 55%.
Production from Manati gas-condensate field on the block
reached a record 7.13 million cu m/day on Sept. 17. Output had
averaged 5.23 million cu m/day so far in the current quarter, and
the record was made possible by the completion of maintenance at
a fertilizer plant that takes the field’s gas, Norse said.
Norse expects production to stabilize above 6 million cu m/
day for the rest of 2009 and increase further in 2010 (OGJ Online,
Jan. 22, 2007).
Meanwhile, the 2001 Camarao Norte discovery, 9 km south of
Manati field, which extends into the BM-CAL-4 block held 100%
by El Paso Corp., is to be unitized, and unitization discussions will
occur within months.
Reservoirs at Camarao Norte, formerly BAS-131, are in Upper
Jurassic Sergi sandstones, same as at Manati. Norse estimates its
Camamu-Almada basin block to be relinquished 10% share of recoverable oil and gas at 12.4 million boe. The field

Composite Energy Ltd., Stirling, UK, installed the world’s first
downhole distributed acoustic optical-fiber monitoring system in
a coalbed methane well in Scotland, according to Fotech Solutions
Ltd., Hampshire, UK, the fiber’s manufacturer.
The system is providing data such as downhole pump conditions, water level, flow profiles across production intervals, wellhead vibrations, and gas flow. Fotech notes that other potential
uses include monitoring and locating sand production, determining tubing integrity, and detecting cross flow.
The system includes a low-cost telecoms-grade optical fiber
and Flotech’s Helios interrogator that provides acoustic or vibration information for each meter along the fiber’s length, Fotech
says.
Composite Energy, established in 2004, is active in developing CBM and holds 21 licenses covering coal fields in Scotland,
England, and Wales.

Siberian gas plant expansion starts up
Russian petrochemicals giant Sibur LLC announced earlier this
month start-up of the second stage of its expansion at the YuzhnoBalyksky gas processing plant in the Tyumen region, roughly 600
miles west of Novosibirsk.
The plant handles a hydrocarbon feed associated with crude oil
production (called “associated petroleum gas”) which it separates
into natural gas, NGLs, and napthas. Its expansion doubles inlet
capacity to 3 billion cu m/year (nearly 3 bcfd) and pushes Sibur’s
company-wide gas processing capacity to 19 billion cu m/year,
said its announcement.
Sibur told OGJ that its current facilities under the Sibur Group
include six gas processing plants—Nyagan, Muravlenkovsky, Gubkinsky, Yuzhno-Balyksky, Nizhnevartovsk, and Belozerny—and
three compressor stations—Vyngopurovskaya, Varyeganskaya,
and Vyngayakhinskaya. All are in western Siberia.
The new complex at Yuzhno-Balyksky consists of a booster
compression station, drying and low-temperature condensation
sections, a propane refrigeration plant, and other facilities.
Modernization of Yuzhno-Balyksky gas plant began in 2007
with the first stage increasing associated-gas processing capacity
to 1.5 billion cu m/year from 900 million cu m/year.
The just-completed second stage of the expansion was designed
by NIPIgazpererabotka JSC, Sibur’s engineering center for gasprocessing technologies, said the company. The control system
was fully automated by Yokogawa Co., Japan. The new complex
10

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
can handle both high and low-pressure associated gas.
When the entire new complex attains design capacity, the plant
will produce 2.8 billion cu m/year of dry gas and 900,000 tonnes/
year (about 28,000 b/d) of light hydrocarbons.
The capacity increase is aimed at receiving additional volumes
of associated natural gas, mainly from the Priobskoye oil field that
is being developed by Rosneft JSC. Sibur said modernization and
expansion at the Yuzhno-Balysky plant have improved utilization
of raw stream produced gas to 95%.

Partners break ground on Devil Creek gas plant
Joint venture partners Apache Energy Ltd. and Santos Ltd. broke
ground at the Devil Creek domestic natural gas processing plant
site in the Pilbara region of Western Australia about 50 km south
of Karratha.
The plant will be fed raw gas through a 105-km subsea pipeline
from the joint venture’s offshore Reindeer field development in
the WA-209-P permit.
The plant will supply as much as 220 TJ/day of gas into the
Dampier-Bunbury trunk line. It will also produce as much as 500
b/d of condensate.
Santos has already signed up CITIC Pacific Ltd., Hong Kong, as
the project’s foundation gas buyer.
Under the $812 million (Aus.) contract, Santos will supply CITIC’s Sino Iron magnetite mining project at Cape Preston, 100 km
south of Dampier with 75 PJ of gas over 7 years from the latter half

of 2011. The gas will be used as generation fuel for Sino’s 450-Mw
electric power station now under construction.
Reindeer field was discovered in 1997 and has a recoverable
resource range of 390-610 bcf of gas.
Perth-based engineering and construction company Clough
Australia is engaged as engineering, procurement and module
fabrication contract for the Devil Creek project.
The $54 million (Aus.) contract is for engineering, design work,
and procurement of all permanent materials and equipment plus
fabrication and assembly of all modules for the facility.
Apache Energy in West Perth, a subsidiary of Houston-based
Apache Corp., has 55% of the project with Santos holding 45%.

Tullow will sell stake to fund Uganda refinery
Tullow Oil Ltd. plans to sell part of its Ugandan assets to finance an oil pipeline project and other production infrastructure,
according to state media.
Uganda’s state-owned New Vision newspaper said Tullow confirmed it would sell part of its wholly owned Block-2, to finance
developments in the Lake Albertine basin.
“Uganda’s oil basin development plan is an integrated project
that requires building of a refinery that is linked with pipelines
to supply local, regional and international markets,” said Tim
O’Hanlon, Tullow’s vice-president for African business.
O’Hanlon said a joint venture undertaking is crucial because
“we are an exploration and production company, but not in the

pipeline or refinery business. …We need a partner with expertise
in this area.”
He said Tullow has “received many interested firms, but we
are still screening them with the government to get the right partner.”
Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni has said he will not allow
international oil companies to refine the oil outside the country,
saying it must be refined domestically to ensure that more profits
are retained in the country.
Meanwhile, the discovery of oil in Uganda and plans to build
a refinery could be delaying construction of the planned 320-km
Eldoret to Kampala oil pipeline, according to a senior Kenyan
ministry official.
Work has yet to begin on the pipeline, which was awarded to
the Libyan-backed Tamoil East Africa in 2006, due to concerns
that a refinery in Uganda will reduce profitability of their business and require more time to recoup their investment.
“The Libyans are asking for certain guarantees that should
Uganda construct a refinery, it will in no way affect the pipeline
usage,” said Peter Nyoike, Permanent Secretary in Kenya’s Ministry of Energy.
In June, Tamoil announced groundwork on the pipeline was
expected to begin in July, with completion scheduled for 2011—
4 years later than planned. Tamoil will hold a 51% stake in the
pipeline, while Uganda and Kenya will jointly hold the remaining
49%. ✦

FERC issues final EIS for FGT expansion project
The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s staff issued
a final environmental impact statement on Florida Gas Transmission Co.’s Phase VIII expansion project just 5 months after it issued
a draft EIS on the proposed $2.46 billion project.
The proposed line expansion in Alabama and Florida would
add 820 MMcfd of capacity to FGT’s system, FERC said. The project
would include laying 483.2 miles of multidiameter pipeline, adding 198,000 hp of compression to eight existing stations, building
a 15,600-hp compression station, constructing three meter and
regulator stations, and upgrading two existing meter stations and
building a regulator station, FERC said Sept. 18 in the final EIS.
The proposed expansion, expected to cost $2.455 billion,
would start service in Spring 2011, assuming that it receives the
necessary permits and approvals, according to FGT. The system is
owned by Citrus Co., a joint venture of Southern Union Co., the
pipeline’s operator, and El Paso Corp.
FERC’s final EIS said the proposed project would have limited
environmental impacts, with appropriate mitigation measures, for
reasons similar to those it listed in the draft EIS on Apr. 17. Commissioners will consider public comments and the final EIS before
making a final decision, FERC said.

Golar LNG sign Fisherman’s Landing deal
Golar LNG has signed a heads of agreement to sell LNG from
the Fisherman’s Landing coalseam methane-LNG project near
Gladstone to Toyota Tsucho Corp. of Japan.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Toyota has agreed to buy 1.5 million tonnes/year of LNG for 12
years beginning in 2014.
Negotiations are now under way for the Toyota Group trading
company to also buy a minority equity interest in the Fisherman’s
Landing project.
It is the smallest of the five CSM-supplied LNG plants proposed
for Gladstone. The $500-million plant, scheduled to come on
stream in 2012, is being developed by Golar and Perth Co. LNG
Ltd. and will be supplied by CSM from Brisbane-based Arrow Energy Ltd.’s fields in the Surat basin in central Queensland.
Arrow says it has more than enough gas to supply the first LNG
train. Site preparation has already commenced and documentation for front-end engineering and design has been submitted. In
addition shipping agreements are in place and Toyota has become
the foundation buyer.
At the moment LNG Ltd. and Golar each have a 40% interest in
the Fisherman’s Landing plant while Arrow has the option to take
the remaining 20% stake. ✦

Correction
Japan’s refiners facing hard choices, must seek alliances to
ease closings” (OGJ, Aug. 3, 2009, p. 44) by Tomoko Hosoe,
the vertical axis (Million b/d) was inadvertently reversed. The
increments should ascend the axis 0 to 6.

Algae’s growing popularity
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
Established investors, including one
notable oil major, are putting money
into early-stage companies developing
algae-based biofuel. A handful of algae
companies are among various entrepreneurs racing to commercially produce a
next-generation biofuel.
ExxonMobil Corp. recently joined
the race to develop algae-based biofuels, saying it will invest $300 million
with Synthetic Genomics Inc., a San
Diego company founded by J. Craig
Venter. ExxonMobil is spending another $300 million internally on algae
research.
Emil Jacobs, vice-president of research
and development at ExxonMobil Research
& Engineering Co., shared some of the
company’s thinking about its collaboration with Synthetic Genomics.
The collaboration likely will last 5-6
years, Jacobs told reporters during a
July conference call in which ExxonMobil announced its investment.
Jacobs said he is unsure what fuels
ultimately might result from the collaboration. He and Venter would not
discuss specific technology with reporters, saying researchers will investigate
all options.
Synthetic Genomics plans to build a
test plant in San Diego to study growing algae in open ponds and in closed
photosynthetic bioreactors. The test
plant’s researchers also will study oilextraction techniques.
The gist of Venter’s research involves
genetic engineering on an industrialscale culturing of algae to yield hydrocarbons. Previously, Venter worked on
16

sequencing a human genome. He likes
to describe his current algae research as
biomanufacturing.
ExxonMobil estimates that ultimately
billions of dollars worth of investment
could be needed before achieving commercial production of an algae-based
fuel. The initial $300 million investment is intended to help Venter tweak a
biochemical path to alter the molecules
of algal oil, leaving a hydrocarbon.

ExxonMobil’s thinking
The major’s decision came after its
executives quietly investigated biofuels
in general for more than a year. After
considering the technical challenges of
potential next-generation biofuel options, algae rose to the top of ExxonMobil’s list.
“As far as products to expect from this
program, our intent is to make hydrocarbons that look a lot like today’s transportation fuels,” Jacobs said. “We want to
produce hydrocarbons that can go into a
refinery to be processed along with other
petroleum streams and then used in the
transportation fleet or even jet fuel.”
ExxonMobil planners want a biofuel
that can attain large-scale production.
Environmental footprint was another
consideration. ExxonMobil considered
water use, land use, and carbon emissions likely to result from the production of various biofuels.
The initial plan is to come up with
a modular design involving an optimal

plant size. Then other production sites
can be built as needed, Jacobs said.

Others react
Paul Dickerson, a partner with
Haynes & Boone LLP, welcomes ExxonMobil’s involvement in algae research.
Dickerson launched the law firm’s clean
technology practice group. Formerly, he
was chief executive of the US Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.
“All alternative energy provides a
wonderful opportunity for incumbent
energy companies,” Dickerson said.
“Exxon has been focused on energy
production and distribution for generations. If we are bringing Exxon’s
expertise to alternatives, we as a nation
are stronger.”
He sees the clean technology industry entering a development phase
where oil and gas companies can
provide financial backing and also can
provide valuable experience on converting successful laboratory results
into practical commercial application.
“Clean-tech entrepreneurs are now
looking to scale up, and oil companies
know this drill,” Dickerson said. “Oil
companies have a long track record of
planning, financing, and overseeing
large projects. There are many areas for
potential technical collaboration.”
Michelle Ashby, chief executive officer of MINE LLC, and an organizer
for energy investor meetings, notes
algae may be the first in a new age of
biofuels in which researchers carefully
examine the whole life cycle involved
in creating a fuel.
“There are a lot of tracks moving at
the same time, one of them will emerge,”
to become mainstream, she said.
ExxonMobil believes any significant
algae-based commercial development
is still years away. “This is very early
days,” Jacobs said. “We’ve got a lot of
work ahead of us.” ✦

Dissent is just dissent
According to liberal assertions, to resist the
radical stampede under way in the US is to be
rude, violent, or racist. And liberals making these
assertions want to improve political discourse.
Does anyone see contradiction here?
The allegation of rudeness comes from President Barack Obama. On Sunday public-affairs television programs Sept. 20, Obama criticized three
cable news networks for encouraging misbehavior.
“The easiest way to get on television right now
is to be really rude,” he said on ABC’s This Week
with George Stephanopoulos. On CNN’s State of
the Nation, he urged networks to “reward decency
and civility in our political discourse.” And on
CBS’s Face the Nation, he said news programs and
blogs “can’t get enough of conflict,” adding, “It’s
catnip to the media right now.”

indiscretion during Obama’s Sept. 9 speech to Congress on health care reform. When the president
said legislation wouldn’t provide illegal immigrants
free coverage, Wilson blurted, “You lie!” Wilson
apologized for what he described as a spontaneous
breach of decorum. But the outburst revived suspicions that he is racist, which he denies.
By then, the racist cobra was out of the basket
and riling the crowd. Did opposition to the first
African-American president in US history betray
racism? Yes, declared former President Jimmy
Carter after Wilson’s blunder. “I think an overwhelming portion of the intensely demonstrated
animosity toward President Barack Obama is
based on the fact that he is a black man, that he’s
African-American,” Carter said on NBC Nightly
News a day before making similar observations in
a speech at Emory University.

Policy makers and business leaders
are sharpening their focus on ways to
reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the belief these reductions
could improve the economy, weather,
and quality of life. This topic has
grown to such global pervasiveness that
GHG issues now provide a common
touchstone for all industrialized and
emerging economies. While the merits
and concerns
surrounding
GHG emissions
are too complex
to examine fully
in a single article, the drive to
reduce emissions
has identified a universal benefit and is
gaining momentum.
When applied selectively, increases
in production efficiency reduce GHG
emissions and increase business margins. Various regulatory initiatives
would require operating improvements
to account for GHG reductions of from
2% to more than 10% between 2010
and 2015.1 Overall, increased production efficiency involves:
• Energy recovery; heat losses to the
environment.
• Higher mechanical reliability; less
shutdowns, flaring, and process venting.
• Improved energy transfer processes—thermal and mechanical.
• Recovery and reuse of processing
chemicals and byproducts.
Government regulations at all levels
are demanding higher efficiency ratings and stepped up energy reduction
programs.2 Individual states also are
instituting their versions of GHG reduction programs, which, combined with
federal programs, are included in the
expanding requirements for project
permitting, operations, and GHG reporting.
Communities surrounding US
production centers are encouraged to
participate in the development of policies that regulate industrial projects and
operations in their area. This pattern is
being repeated around the globe, albeit

at a slower pace in developing nations,
with GHG initiatives becoming part
of international trade, customs, and
tariffs.3
Benchmarking GHG reductions is
now an aspect of corporate sustainability. A corporate record of GHG
reductions can be considered for the
evaluation of preferred suppliers, partnerships, alliances, government regulations, and investor decisions.
Environmental policies that add
GHG provisions raise the barrier for
market entry, which is a concern for
industries that supply consumer goods.
Existing production sites have a
vested interest in their facilities’ competitive position. Investments in the
producer’s time and resources must
address these issues:
• Improve the producer’s competitive position.
• Provide an equal or greater return
with less risk than the alternatives.
• Combined with competitor activities, address a government’s responsibilities to community concerns.

GHG specifications
GHG is measured as a carbon dioxide
equivalent (CO2e), where chemicals or
commodities released into the environment are converted to their CO2e by a
factor specific to that chemical or commodity. Resources for the conversion,
are numerous and exhaustive.4 5 Table
1 shows a few common fuels used in
industry. Fuel use is the largest source
of GHG emissions.
Unburned fuel in the form of methane (CH4), nitrous oxides (N2O), and
other contaminants associated with
low-combustion efficiency contribute
to a fuel’s GHG production.
Poor combustion is the primary
reason solid fuels (i.e., coal, coke, and
waste products) produce three times
the CO2e impact of natural gas, in addition to emitting elevated levels of sulfur
and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Maximizing the heating potential of any fuel
reduces fuel use and CO2e production.
But plant fuel gases containing liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) can have

Equipment selection
Equipment selected for replacements,
modification, or repair must be engineered to the correct specifications to
reduce maintenance under anticipated
operating conditions. Production maintenance strives for a planned schedule
based on equipment monitoring to
provide the preventive activities and
minor repairs necessary to continue
operations that are safe and adhere to
environmental rules.
Repeated equipment repair indicates inadequately engineered parts or
altered process conditions. Rotating
equipment specifications under the
American Petroleum Institute provide
a baseline for long-term performance,
and additional qualifications may be
warranted.11
Although equipment decisions are
case by case, motor drives, pumps,
compressors, and gear-system efficiency generally improve with lower
revolutions per minute (rpm) basis
friction. Motor efficiency rating is also
essential, especially in small motor sizing. Equipment costs are typically the
reverse—lower with higher operating
rpm and lower efficiency.
Also, oversized, high-efficiency
motors operating at a reduced load
can—and frequently do—operate as
efficiently as smaller, less efficient motors operating at design capacity. The
higher-efficiency motors are expected
to operate more reliably. Steam turbines, typically smaller sizes or operating at reduced load, can have a fraction
of the operating efficiency of a comparable electric motor drive.
Backup service aside, continuous
low-pressure, steam turbine driver
use should be avoided, and all turbine
operations should strive for operation at
full capacity.
Intermediate and low-pressure steam
turbine drivers can lose efficiency at
a rate of more than 0.7:1 at reduced
rates. For example, a 30% reduction in
driver capacity can cause a 20% loss
in efficiency. Equipment selection for
reliability, efficiency, and cost consists
of an engineering analysis of different

applications for anticipated operations
over the equipment life cycle. The outcome of any analysis can differ as the
basis for a long reliable or short-term
life expectancy.
Varying the drive speed can add efficiency to specific equipment services,
but justifying an investment solely on
an efficiency basis is difficult unless
there are extended periods of underutilization.
Reviewing the market period to
date may shift production profitability
to product yields instead of increased
charge rates with alternative charge
stocks. Higher efficiency mechanical
operations deserve a review in an underutilized production market scenario.
Fixed equipment, such as exchanger
configurations, have design options
like bell heads that can reduce purchase
costs and leaks and still provide access
for cleaning and inspection. Unused
vessel flanges, specified as part of
standard configurations, provide more
leakage points and require monitoring.
Improvements such as heater insulation, sealed box closures, roof seals,
and optimized heat distribution provide
incremental operation and maintenance
savings. Numerous areas, ranging from
rotating equipment seals to gasket
materials, affect product losses, equipment reliability, and operating costs.
Advances in equipment technology
provide justifiable alternatives.
Production configurations (the
flow of a process between equipment)
become more complex as a production site ages. Piping or out-of-service

equipment left in place and complex
stream routings introduce materials and
stress into operating equipment outside
of the design considerations. The cost
of unused lines and equipment left in
place is difficult to quantify in product
loss, repeat repairs, personnel exposure, and future consequences. Timely
removal is always advisable.

Start-up, shutdown
Up-to-date procedures guide safe
and environmentally secure operations. But continuous improvements in
operations performance have reduced
the experience personnel have with
start-ups and shutdowns.
Training, timed shortly before a
planned start-up, is warranted on
large investments with high operating
temperatures and pressures, light-ends
compression, or other technologies
with an extended vent or flaring period. New, revised, and existing production units are implementing procedures
that strive to eliminate flaring during
start-ups. Planning and creative procedures are essential to incorporate all the
site-specific implications.
Production start-up activities begin
with planning in the engineering and
construction or maintenance phase.
Proper planning can reduce start-up
time by 25-50% by eliminating rework
and unplanned repairs. No set procedure directly applies to all sites because
each site has configuration details
that must be individually addressed.
Operating procedures offer an area for
continuous improvement.

Many technologies create a high
level of equipment wear during start-up
and shutdown. High-temperature/highpressure reactor circuits, gasification,
fluid cracking, and coking, for example, sustain the majority of the vessel
and associated piping stress during the
expansion and contraction cycle of a
start up or shutdown. Extended operations between production interruptions

expense associated with alternative
energy sources, CO2 injection for the
recovery of known oil and gas deposits
continues to justify investments.
Small markets for purity CO2 exist
everywhere, such as for use as propellant, cleaner, storage agent, water
treatment, and additive to agricultural
products.
Investment in the operations to reproduce plant-based products continues
to grow, spurred, in part, by attractive
incentives. The economics for production of renewable fuels becomes more
favorable as the price increases for oil
products.

Government and industry
Reduction of GHG emissions depends ultimately on a combination of
actions undertaken by the government
and industry.
Congress is debating legislation that
would place a value on CO2e and set
a cash value on the GHG emissions
associated with a production site that
exceeded a certain cap. When a value is
placed on GHG emissions, the cost of
the fuel generating that emission can
rise by 50-100%.
Table 3 illustrates this point by converting a CO2e price to units of the fuel
purchased.
For industry, long-term decisionmaking is as important as it is challenging. Projects based on short decision
times often result in less-than-desirable
outcomes, increased investments,
more complex operations and reduced
production margins. Successful projects
avoid situations that create additional,
unnecessary costs for doing business or
that force a choice between the best of
worse scenarios.
To remain viable in an increasingly competitive market, production
operations—either stand-alone or as
a unit of a diversified business—must
continue to increase product yields and
reduce operating costs. Even unique
and specialized product lines rapidly
find they are just another commodity
in a global market.

Salazar to end federal oil and gas RIK program
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
US Interior Sec. Ken Salazar beat a
US House committee to the punch and
announced plans to eliminate the US
Minerals Management Service’s royalty-

in-kind (RIK) program on Sept. 16.
His announcement came during his
opening statement to the House Natural
Resources Committee in the first day of
hearings on a sweeping federal minerals reform bill that its chairman, Nick J.
Rahall (D-W.Va.), introduced on Sept 8.

The measure includes a provision ending the RIK program.
“The royalty-in-kind program has
been a blemish, in my view, on this
department. It is time for us to end it,”
said Salazar. “It was set up at a time
when people felt the department could

US Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, second from left, and three other top US Department of the Interior
officials listen as House Natural Resources Committee members respond during a Sept. 16 hearing to
his announcement that he will end the US Minerals Management Service’s oil and gas royalty-in-kind
program. Joining Salazar were, from left, Wilma A. Lewis, assistant Interior secretary for land and

make more money from selling oil and
gas on the open market than in taking
royalties. It was created by administrative order, and I intend to end it.”
He told reporters following the hearing that it will take about a year to shut
the program down because several of
its components operate under contracts.
“We expect to issue the order in the
coming weeks,” he said.
MMS Director S. Elizabeth Birnbaum
and BLM Director Robert V. Abbey will
work with Wilma A. Lewis, assistant
interior secretary for land and minerals
management, in making the transition from the RIK program to a more
transparent and accountable royalty
collection operation, Salazar told the
committee.
“Bravo, bravo, bravo,” Rahall said
after Salazar finished his opening statement. “I have called for its elimination for years because it has so many
problems.”
The program drew especially
heavy fire in September 2008 after an
investigation by the Department of
the Interior’s inspector general found
26

federal RIK employees in Denver were
paid for outside work, abused drugs
and alcohol, and solicited sex.

Different conclusions
Rep. Cynthia Lummus (R-Wyo.) noted that Salazar’s predecessor as interior
secretary, Dirk A. Kempthorne, formed
an independent committee chaired by
former Sens. J. Robert Kerrey (D-Neb.)
and Jake Garn (R-Utah) which investigated the government’s minerals
royalty programs and reached different
conclusions. One of those was that the
RIK program should be scrapped onshore but retained offshore because of
significantly bigger takeaway volumes,
she said.
Salazar said he was acquainted with
the committee’s work and would consider its recommendations.
American Petroleum Institute
President Jack N. Gerard said the RIK
program collected $6.6 billion in oil
and gas deliveries during fiscal 2008
and is one of the federal government’s
largest sources of nontax revenue. “Terminating this straightforward method

of handling royalty payments runs the
risk of raising administrative costs and
adding additional layers of paperwork
required to determine the value of oil
and gas production,” he said.
Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman
(D-NM) apparently wasn’t surprised,
since the Government Accountability
Office issued two reports before the
hearing calling for major federal royalty
management reforms. “GAO’s rebuke of
the way [DOI] collects royalties is just
the latest red flag that the American
people are not getting a fair return for
the oil and gas resources they own,” he
said. “We’ll be taking a careful look at
the administration’s proposals to overhaul the flawed royalty management
program.”
Salazar told the committee that
phasing out the RIK program is part of
a broader effort to improve minerals
royalty collections within DOI. He said
Lewis was leading a two-track department-wide minerals royalty policy
review of possible administrative and
legislative actions. “There’s a lot we can
do to simplify the collection of federal
royalties,” the secretary said.
In his written statement, he said the
administration has not had an opportunity to fully analyze Rahall’s bill, which
also includes a provision combining
the US Bureau of Land Management
and MMS into a single Office of Federal
Energy and Minerals Leasing.

Administrative actions
Many of the bill’s provisions can
be achieved through administrative
actions, Salazar told the committee.
“For example, I am developing options
to improve the coordination between
[MMS and BLM] in onshore and offshore leasing and revenue management
policies related to domestic energy
production, both conventional and
renewable, from federal lands,” he said.
“I intend to bring needed coordination
and strategic guidance to the department’s energy development programs
and to its implementation of significant
reforms, including recommendations

from the reports of the GAO and the
Office of the Inspector General.”
Republican committee members
criticized Rahall’s bill and Salazar’s actions since becoming interior secretary. “In your time at [DOI], you have
essentially blocked energy development
across-the-board,” Rep. Michael Coffman, a freshman from Colorado, told
Salazar. “We can’t drill onshore, we
can’t drill offshore, we can’t develop
oil shale, we can’t develop uranium deposits, and you haven’t issued any new
solar permits.”
Salazar disagreed, citing continued
oil and gas lease sales at BLM and MMS
and revised oil shale technology assessment programs.
Another GOP freshman, Bill Cassidy
from Louisiana, suggested that Rahall’s

bill creates contradictions in calling for
more expeditious oil and gas production while increasing the potential for
bureaucratic delays.
“There is room for us to improve,”
Salazar responded. “Technologies such
as horizontal drilling create opportunities today that were not available 30
years ago. We’re also aware that several
private landowners and oil and gas
producers are taking approaches which
may be more efficient than the federal
government’s. We’d like to look into
these.”
When Robert J. Wittman (R-Va.)
asked about the status of a lease sale
scheduled off Virginia’s coast in 2011
as part of the MMS’s 2007-12 OCS plan,
Salazar said that DOI was looking at it

but added that there hasn’t been new
information about Atlantic US offshore
resources for decades. “Virginia has
the opportunity to be the first new
leasing area on the East Coast, not just
for conventional but also renewable
resources,” Wittman said.
“I think one area where you can
expect bipartisan support there is
natural gas,” Salazar replied. “There are
indications that there may be substantial amounts out there.” Responding to
a question about Atlantic OCS leasing in general from Doug Lamborn
(R-Colo.), ranking minority member
of the committee’s Energy and Mineral
Subcommittee, the secretary said that
more current information is necessary
because “what’s out there could turn
out to be a big nothing.” ✦

Extended OCS comment period produces 350,000 comments
Nick Snow
Washington Editor

“The offshore energy program
we are developing must address our
nation’s energy security challenges, deliver a fair return to the taxpayers who
own the resources, and account for the
views of local communities, states, and
tribal nations,” the secretary said.
It also must take several key considerations into account, including ocean
areas critical to military training and
the national defense; other economic
benefits of the oceans including fishing, tourism, and subsistence uses;
environmental considerations; existing
oil and gas infrastructure; interest from
the oil and gas industry; and the availability of seismic and scientific data, he
said.
“I am confident that we will be able
to expand our nation’s offshore energy
portfolio by focusing on development
in the right way in the right places,”
Salazar said.

The US government received more
than 350,000 public comments on possible Outer Continental Shelf resource
development strategies during the
6-month comment period that expired
Sept. 21, US Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said on Sept. 22.
Many of the comments came from
public meetings he hosted in New
Jersey, Louisiana, Alaska, and California, he said. “I heard broad agreement
that we must confront our dangerous
dependence on foreign oil, build a
clean energy future, and make use of
the limited resources we have while
protecting our land, water, and wildlife,” he said.
Salazar said the US Minerals Management Service is reviewing all of the
comments, which will take several
weeks. Once that is complete, it will

“In about a week’s time, we will
mark the 1-year anniversary of the
end of the moratoria for new oil and
natural gas leasing in federal waters off
our Atlantic and Pacific coasts,” noted
American Petroleum Institute Pres.
Jack N. Gerard. “Despite the public’s
clear desire for more domestic energy
development and the industry’s years
of experience operating offshore in
an environmentally sensitive way, this

all Americans, especially in these tough
economic times.”
Gerard said new oil and gas development could create thousands of jobs,
add more than $1 trillion to government coffers, strengthen US energy
security, and encourage a domestic
economic recovery. “It’s time to end
the delays. The administration now has
comments in hand. It knows that oil

nation’s economy for decades to come.

Delivering ‘human
impact statements’

US

House Natural Resources
Committee members found
plenty on which to disagree as they
began 2 days of hearings on Chairman Nick J. Rahall’s (D-W.Va.)
federal minerals management reform
bill on Sept 16. They probably would
have agreed with Interior Secretary
Ken Salazar, who was there to testify,
that Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah) was
the most passionate during his allotted 5 min for questions.
Bishop had a lot on his mind. He
started with questions about contacts
between the National Parks Service
and the National Parks and Conservation Association. He reiterated his
criticism of Salazar’s Feb. 6 order to
cancel 77 oil and gas leases in eastern
Utah that the US Bureau of Land
Management auctioned in December.
Then he asked Salazar to turn around
so he could see a man and a woman
standing together near the press table.
Jeremy and Amber Harrison had come
from Vernal, Utah, to present 150
“human impact statements” about the
lease cancellations to Deputy Interior
Secretary David J. Hayes the day before,
Bishop explained.
He said Hayes’ office notified
them that the appointment had been
cancelled and that the DOI official
would not be able to see them at all
that week. So Bishop brought them
to the hearing.

‘They’re individuals’
“These aren’t oil and gas producers or special interest groups. They
are individuals who were directly
affected by your decision,” he told
Salazar.
“What happened to those 77 lease
parcels you’re so passionate about is
28

that the [US Bureau of Land Management] did not conduct proper
consultations about them. Those
are taking place now, and several of
them may be offered in the future,”
the secretary responded.
But he also essentially apologized
to the Harrisons. “Periodically, the
federal government acts without
considering the trouble individuals like them take to express their
views in person,” he said during the
hearing. He met with the couple in
the hallway afterward and told them
they could meet with someone at
DOI that afternoon.

Downturn’s cause
OGJ also spoke with the Harrisons,
who own and operate an oil hauling truck. They said unlike previous
downturns that had been caused by
companies canceling major projects,
this one occurred because of an official’s decision in Washington.
Salazar’s move came after a
consultant completed an extraction
industry impact study for Uintah
County in November 2008 to attract more oil field service firms,
Amber Harrison said. “As soon as
his decision was publicized, companies started to pull out instead,” she
noted.
Unemployment in the county has
climbed to 8% now from around 1%
a year ago, she added.
Salazar kept his word. The Harrisons met that afternoon with Hayes
and BLM Director Robert V. Abbey.
“It went well. It was a little easier to
get our points across to Mr. Hayes
one-on-one” and Abbey seemed very
willing to listen, Mrs. Harrison told
OGJ by telephone on Sept 21. ✦

the future,” he said on Sept. 21.
In comments submitted to MMS
on Sept. 15, Independent Petroleum
Association of American Pres. Barry
Russell warned: “As our nation’s energy
demand continues to increase, a failure
to provide needed access to the OCS
will increase domestic energy prices,
slow US economic growth, and create
hardships for consumers.”
“The next 5-Year Plan will define the shape and scope of domestic
offshore energy development. It is
essential that MMS develop a leasing program that provides maximum
flexibility for our nation to address its
energy needs,” Russell said.

Prompt review
National Ocean Industries Association Pres. Tom Fry urged US Interior
Secretary Ken Salazar to review the
comments promptly and analyze all
OCS planning areas now that the
6-month comment period extension
the secretary imposed on Feb. 10 has
expired.
“Today’s volatile energy prices and
supplies have created many problems
for ordinary Americans. In part, this is
because the government has denied access to energy resources owned by the
American people,” Fry said on Sept. 21.
“The energy resources on the OCS are
vital to the nation’s economic prosperity, and safety records show that they
can be produced in an environmentally
responsible manner.”
Jenny Fordham, energy markets
and government affairs director at the
Natural Gas Supply Association, said the
draft proposed plan (DPP) was a step in
the right direction “and industry supports a robust plan as a foundation to
our future domestic energy supply.” She
said, “MMS should not delay the 5-Year
Plan process, but should move forward
quickly after the close of the comment
period to develop the proposed plan
and complete the necessary environmental work.”
In comments submitted to Renee
Orr, MMS’s 5-Year Plan program director on Sept. 21, Fordham said NGSA

technologies,” he said.
Morris conceded that successive
exploration over some of the same
areas led to new discoveries because
new geologic concepts were tested,
aided by the evolution of exploration
and production technologies. “Nevertheless, over the period that moratoria
restricted access to as much as 80% of
the OCS, other opportunities for discovery went unexplored and untested,”
he said.
Access to areas where technologies and concepts can be tested, and
where lessons learned from exploration
elsewhere in the world can be applied,
will increase the likelihood that new
domestic offshore oil and gas resources
will be discovered and domestic energy
security improved, Morris said. “We
will continue to rely on oil and gas
in the long term, so we need to make
decisions now that provide us with the
resource in the long term,” he said.

Tighter OTC derivative oversight needed, House panel told
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Regulation of over-the-counter derivatives is essential as the US government
tries to prevent market manipulation,
the chiefs of two key financial regulatory commissions told the US House
Agriculture Committee on Sept. 22.
30

Noting that a year has passed since
the domestic financial system nearly
collapsed as several major investments
through complicated financial instruments went sour, US Commodity
Futures Trading Commission Chairman
Gary G. Gensler and US Securities and
Exchange Commission Chairwoman
Mary C. Schapiro each said the lack of

OTC derivative market regulation was
only one of several serious weaknesses
in US financial regulation.
But it was a significant weakness and
it should be corrected, they continued.
“It is critical that we work together to
enact legislation that will bring greater
transparency and oversight to the OTC
derivatives market,” Schapiro said in

her opening statement. “The derivatives
market has grown enormously since
the late 1990s to approximately $450
trillion of outstanding nominal amount
in June 2009.”
Gensler said comprehensive OTC
derivate market reform will require
two complementary regimes: one for
derivatives dealers and one for the
markets themselves. “This regulatory
framework must cover both standardized and customized swaps. It should
include all the different products, such
as interest rate swaps, currency swaps,
commodity swaps, equity swaps, and
credit default swaps, as well as all of
the derivative products that may be
developed in the future,” he said.
“We should eliminate exclusions and
exemptions from regulation for OTC
derivatives. Congress should extend the
regulatory regimes of the Commodity
Exchange Act and the federal securities laws to fully cover OTC swaps in
all commodities,” Gensler said, adding,
“I believe that the law must cover the
entire marketplace, without exception.”

Impetus for reform
Congressional and other critics of
the current system have contended
that speculators used financial swaps
and other instruments during 2008’s
first half to drive oil prices to a record
peak after moving their money from a
crumbling domestic real estate investment arena. The US Department of the
Treasury sent legislative language to
Congress on Aug. 11 that would institute regulation of all OTC derivatives.
Oil and gas as well as other industries
have argued that regulating commodities too strictly could reduce their
ability to hedge prices and drive their
operating costs higher.
“Public gas systems depend upon
both the physical commodity markets
as well as the markets in OTC derivatives to meet the natural gas needs of
their consumers,” David Schryver, executive vice-president of the American
Public Gas Association, told the House
Agriculture Committee Sept. 17 at an
earlier commodities market reform

to them,” said Richard B. Hurst, senior
vice-president and general counsel for
Delta Air Lines Inc., who also testified
on the American Air Transport Association’s behalf. “In a trade where at
least one party is a legitimate physical
hedger in a commodity, the committee
should consider provisions that would
enable these transactions to occur with
little additional financial burden on the
parties involved.”
Jon Hixson, federal government relations director at Cargill Inc., said the
food and agricultural service company’s
businesses include risk management
products for bakeries, restaurants, and
heating oil suppliers.
“Under the Treasury Department’s
proposal, it is highly likely that Cargill
would be forced to greatly reduce, if
not eliminate, offering our customers
these risk management solutions….
In addition, we would expect prudent hedging to decline significantly
in those situations where Cargill, like
other end-users, manages its own
commodity, interest rate, and foreign
exchange risks due to the imposition of
mandatory margining and the drain on
working capital,” he indicated.
But Gensler, at the Sept. 22 hearing,
said CFTC should have authority to set

public gas systems are able to purchase

of suppliers while hedging the risk of
future market price fluctuations.”
Proposals to require all standardized
OTC derivatives to be cleared (which
Gensler said he supports on Sept. 22)
would make it much harder for municipal and other public gas systems to use
these gas supply strategies, Schryver
continued.
Many APGA members with very
high credit worth are not required
to post collateral for an agreed-upon
number of transactions under the current system, he explained. Mandated
clearing of all OTC transactions would
require them to post an initial margin
for all transactions and to meet potential margin calls whenever required
on little notice, putting a significant
financial burden on the systems and
the communities and customers they
serve, Schryver said.
He and other witnesses said at
the Sept. 17 hearing that while they
recognize the need to impose position
limits and other restrictions to prevent
excessive commodities speculation, exemptions also will be needed in many
cases for market participants which are
trying to control their fuel or feedstock
costs.

Schapiro said Congress should consider modifying the Treasury Department’s proposal so that securities-related OTC derivatives are regulated like
securities, and commodity and other
non-securities-related OTC derivatives
are treated like futures.
“At the core of this approach is that
similar products should be regulated
similarly, or equivalently, if possible,”
Schapiro explained. Oil and gas swap
contracts or other commodity-related
OTC derivatives would be regulated in
a manner similar to the underlying oil
and gas or other futures, she said.

T E R E S T
Meanwhile, US Sen. Maria E.
Cantwell (D-Wash.) introduced a bill
on Sept. 17 that she said would make
it easier for CFTC to investigate and
punish alleged commodities market
manipulation. The measure, which was
cosposored by Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.),
would replace the requirement for the
commodities regulator to prove “specific intent” to do harm with the same
“reckless conduct” standard which
the SEC has used for 75 years, and the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
and Federal Trade Commission recently
adopted, she said.

“When bad actors like Enron and
Amaranth Advisors manipulate commodities prices, Americans end up
footing the bill, paying more for commodities like oil, gasoline, heating
oil, food, and natural gas,” Cantwell
said. “Unfortunately, regulators lack
the tools to protect us from market
manipulation in critical commodity
futures markets. Through this tough
new language, we can establish a clear,
bright line against illegal market manipulation and can empower regulators
to effectively enforce and deter market
manipulation.” ✦

House panel told leasing bill would hurt development
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
A bill that aims to make federal oil
and gas leasing more effective and efficient would have the opposite effect instead, two oil and gas industry officials
told the US House Natural Resources
Committee on Sept. 17.
“We believe that it is important to
develop policies that provide more
access to federal lands and remove
barriers that delay the development
of these resources,” said Doug Morris, group director for upstream and
industry operations at the American
Petroleum Institute. “We should not be
erecting additional obstacles to development which, unfortunately, would
be the unintended consequence of this
legislation.”
Alex B. Campbell, vice-president of
Denver independent Enduring Resources LLC and a board member of
the Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States, said HR 3534,
which committee chairman Nick J.
Rahall (D-W.Va.) introduced on Sept. 8,
would create delays with new layers of
bureaucracy and regulations.

the API official said. “By vesting this
authority within regional councils, the
bill could very well put areas effectively
under moratoria for years to come.”
He also questioned provisions in the
bill eliminating the US Minerals Management Service’s royalty-in-kind program (which US Interior Secretary Ken
Salazar said he would phase out when

Sept. 16) and categorical exclusions

“Furthermore, these councils have the

that would further restrict renewable as
well as conventional energy development, he warned.
Morris said API and its members are
concerned about Rahall’s bill because it
would create more layers of bureaucracy that could slow leasing down. “For
example, it has the potential to interfere with the [US Outer Continental
Shelf] 5-Year Leasing Plan process that
has worked well for 30 years,” he said.

transportation of the resource to market, and many other factors make each

Acquiring capital
The business’s financial aspect also
is critical in determining when, where,
and how a property is developed, he
continued. Acquiring the necessary
capital to develop properties is a neverending activity for upstream independents, he explained.
Observers from outside the oil and
gas industry sometimes confuse nonproducing and inactive wells, Morris
said. “Even if a well isn’t producing,
companies may be committing significant amounts of money for geophysical
studies and other evaluations,” he said.
When House Natural Resources
Committee member Michael Coffman
(R-Colo.) asked if lease protests were
common, Campbell said that all the
tracts which the federal government
sold last year in Utah attracted protests.
“I have one Utah lease, the Rock House
project south of the already existing
Natural Buttes field, where I’ve spent
$30 million since 2004 while it has
been tied up in litigation,” he said.
The bill contains a provision that
would require producers to notify
not just surface landholders directly

also possibly adjacent surface land
owners, he indicated. “This provision

3534 attempts to end a requirement for
federal auditors and other compliance
and enforcement personnel to report
to officials whose responsibilities also
include leasing and development, “and
who may be more inclined to make the
royalty management program look successful rather than be successful.”
The bill also would end heavy reliance on compliance reviews instead of
audits and try to get MMS to improve
its computer system so it could identify
instances where producers fail to report
revenue or royalties at all, she noted.
Stephen B. Smith, the mayor of
Pinedale, Wyo., said that while the
measure does not fully address socioeconomic impacts from a major

accustomed to evaluating the geologic

they are not willing to invest millions

he said.
In an interview after the hearing,
Campbell said he was aware of the US
Bureau of Land Management’s effort to
have producers provide surface landholders’ names when proposing tracts
for possible inclusion in future federal
lease sales. He conceded that it would
be additional work to look up the information, but added that most producers

Of the 16 oil and gas blocks offered
between December 2008 and April of
this year, only five blocks won developers, according to the final results of the
bidding process announced Sept. 11 in
Jakarta.
Should the situation persist, the government will be in serious trouble due
to its inability to meet oil production
targets amid soaring demand that has
already made Indonesia a net importer
of oil and oil products.
“This is very bad, but this is the
fact. If the situation remains like this,
my objective to maintain national oil

Asia's largest importer of oil products,
with Pertamina's nine refineries able
to supply less than 70% of domestic oil
product consumption.
Due the lack of refining capacity, a
Pertamina official earlier this month
said the state firm expects the country’s
gasoline imports to more than double
from existing levels by 2017.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, warned that annual
domestic gasoline consumption would
climb to 192.7 million bbl in 2017,
from a forecast 123.8 million bbl in
2009.
He said Indonesia's refineries can
only produce 68.5 million bbl/year of
gasoline, so imports would have to rise
to 124.2 million bbl in 2017, from 55.3
million bbl in 2009.
"If Indonesia wants to cut gasoline

imports, it must build new refineries as
quickly as it can," the official said.
Meanwhile, Pertamina said it expects to import about 5.6 million bbl of
gasoline and 3.6 million bbl of diesel in
October, down slightly from the figures
for September.
The state firm earlier said it planned
to import 5.8 million bbl of gasoline,
and 3-4 million bbl of diesel in September in an effort to boost supplies for
the Muslima holidays of Ramadan and
Eid al-Fitr.
Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of
Ramadan, takes place from Sept. 21-22.
Agustiawan also said the company
currently has 20.9 days of gasoline
stocks and 25 days of diesel stocks.
“We will secure domestic oil products supply, especially during Ramadan
and Eid al-Fitr,” said Karen Agustiawan,
Pertamina's president director, who
added that “Gasoline and diesel imports
are expected to be normal in October." ✦

Gazprom launches new stretch of Kaliningrad gas line
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Russia’s state-owned natural gas
monopoly OAO Gazprom, meeting
the demand of the Russian government, has completed the construction
of the second stretch of the 139-km
Minsk-Vilnius-Kaunas-Kaliningrad gas
pipeline.
“The Russian government tasked
Gazprom with guaranteeing the supply
of 2.5 billion cu m of gas to the Kaliningrad region in 2010,” said Gazprom
Deputy Chief Executive Officer Valery
Golubev.
“The existence of the two-stretch
pipeline and a compressor station,
which will be commissioned near
Vilnius next year, allows us to say that
the set goal will be achieved,” Golubev
said.
The pipeline expansion is part of a

In December, Lithuania will close
its Soviet-era reactor in Ignalina, which
will transform the country from a net
energy exporter to an energy importer.
Since Lithuania has no direct link
to Europe’s electric power grid, it has
no choice but to import more energy
from Russia—a matter that leaves many
Lithuanians apprehensive, especially
given Russia’s recent decision to cut
off supplies to other countries in the
region.

“The new gas pipeline will also

cerns of Lithuanians about the reliability of Russia as
a supplier, analyst IHS Global Insight felt the new line
represents a step in the right direction for the country’s
energy security.
“The additional gas supplies that can be delivered via
the new string of the Minsk-Vilnius-Kaunas-Kaliningrad
pipeline will be a net benefit to Lithuania, even if the
Baltic state is not yet entirely convinced,” IHS Global
Insight said.

LNG to Lithuania
Meanwhile, Golubev said Gazprom is prepared to
supply LNG to Lithuania if a regasification terminal is
built at the Baltic Sea port of Klaipeda.
“We regard this project as a very interesting, promising direction. It is needed now. We have discussed this
issue and we believe that it is very good that countries
are building such terminals,” said Golubev, who added
that Gazprom believes it is necessary to build a gas
pipeline link to Klaipeda.
In September, Lithuania and the US agreed that the
US Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) would
provide an $800,000 grant to conduct a feasibility study
for an LNG import terminal in Lithuania.
The study will determine the possibility of building
a terminal with a capacity of 1.5-2 billion cu m of LNG
and will evaluate three potential sites, including one
offshore.
According to current plans, the terminal will be 80%
state owned, with the remaining 20% to be held by AB
Achema, a private producer of nitrogen fertilizers and
chemical products.
According to a statement by a Lithuanian economy
ministry official, construction of the terminal could
start 3-4 years after the completion of the feasibility
study, which is expected in 2010.
Lithuania’s Energy Minister Arvydas Sekmokas recently said his country is looking for a strategic investor
in the terminal from a foreign country “rich in natural
gas.” ✦

The 45 ft of net hydrocarbon pay

The discovery is a
technical success and could be highly
commercial, they said.
It also appears to set up an exploration play that stretches 700 miles or
more to the east along the coasts of
Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, and
western Ghana where giant Jubilee field
and others have been discovered.
Anchoring a conference call on

The well found a combination

One source rock encountered in the
Venus well is immediately adjacent to
reservoirs, and the area could contain
other source rocks not yet penetrated,
the company said.
A lot of data are still to be collected
to determine where to drill the next
well at Venus, but a dip rate of 2-7°
indicates that areal extent of the reservoirs could be quite large. Areal extent,
still to be determined, will become
clearer after well and log data are tied
with existing 3D seismic data.
Anadarko didn’t reveal the geothermal gradient but said it shows that the
kitchen is kicking out large amounts of
hydrocarbons.
The drillsite is not at each zone’s optimal location on the prospect. Rather,
the well is in the best position to obtain
as much data as possible on the multiple targets in the stratigraphic section
to be penetrated, Anadarko said.

Liberia to gather ultradeepwater seismic
Liberia plans to announce an ultradeepwater licensing round after it
acquires 15,000 km of 2D seismic, gravity, and magnetic data.
National Oil Co. of Liberia (NOCAL)
has let a $16 million contract to TGSNOPEC Geophysical Co. to collect the
data in as much as 4,000 m of water,
Dr. Fodee Kromah, president and chief
executive officer of NOCAL told OGJ in
an exclusive interview.
TGS will start the work later this
year provided there is enough industry

interest. Offshore Liberia has attracted
significant industry attention due to
recently announced discoveries in the
Gulf of Guinea and Sierra Leone.
Earlier this month, NOCAL opened
its third petroleum bidding round covering fi ve blocks, which will close on
Nov. 30. A ceremony to open bids for
blocks LB-1, LB-2, LB-3, LB-4, and LB-5,
is set for Dec. 1. NOCAL is offering production sharing contracts that expected
to be signed by June 2010.
Kromah told OGJ that despite the

pects and leads Anadarko has identified
on its West Africa acreage position.
That includes interests in nearly 8
million acres on 10 blocks off the four
countries. Anadarko operates seven

Repsol YPF confirms large gas find off Venezuela
Repsol YPF SA confirmed earlier
reports that it has made a giant natural
gas discovery off Venezuela.
The company, in an exploration
partnership with Italy’s Eni SPA, said
the Perla-1 well could hold 7-8 tcf of
gas in place and said that further tests
would be needed to determine the
discovery’s exact size.
The gas was discovered on a 924 sq
km exploration block called Cardon IV,
which the Spanish firm began exploring in 2006 along with Venezuela’s
state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA
(PDVSA).

The block was one of three that
drew bids in the October 2005 Rafael
Urdaneta Phase A license round in the
eastern Gulf of Venezuela. Three more
blocks drew bids in Phase B in November 2005.
Repsol YPF and Eni would have
stakes of 32.5% each in future production, while PDVSA would get 35%.
Earlier, the Spanish daily El Pais
newspaper quoted Venezuela’s President
Hugo Chavez as saying that 1.5-2 tcf of
the 7-8 tcf could be recoverable—a figure that Repsol YPF could not confirm.
Repsol said the areal extent could be as

large as 33 sq km.
In any case, Chavez saw the find as
boosting Venezuela into the top tier of
world gas producers, saying, “At the
rate the certified scientific discoveries are going, Venezuela’s gas reserves
will place it among the top five in the
world.”
Chavez was in Spain as part of a state
tour of European and Asian countries,
which has included Iran, Turkmenistan,
and Russia, where several agreements
were signed for the developments of
Venezuela’s Orinoco heavy oil belt.

Jurassic Haynesville shale on 13,500 net
acres northeast of Natchez in Jefferson
County, Miss.
Haynesville shale has similar attributes and is eight times thicker in the
project area than in northwestern Louisiana based on engineering analysis of
data from a Chevron well drilled on the
acreage in the 1980s.
The companies have remapped the
entire project area with reprocessed
seismic data.
Mainland Resources has participated
in the drilling and completion of two
Haynesville shale wells in DeSoto Parish, La., and expects to complete a third
well in a few months.
Mainland Resources will be operator and pay 80% of initial well costs
to earn a 51% working interest in the

total project area. It was not clear when
drilling might start.
Griffin & Griffin Exploration LLC,
Jackson, Miss., plans drilling to further
develop Belmont Lake oil and gas field
in Wilkinson County, Miss.
The field, on 142 acres in the Mississippi River flood plain, averages 130
b/d of 29° gravity oil from two vertical
wells on gas lift from Oligocene Frio
to a tank battery above flood stage. The
river tends to flood between January
and May, but the wells can produce
when submerged.

During the past 5 years, gas shale
production grew to more than 8 bcfd
from 2 bcfd (Fig. 1). For some time
now, shale and other unconventional
reservoirs have helped stabilize US
gas production, offsetting long-term
production declines from conventional
sources. Then, in recent years, the shale
growth accelerated markedly, helping to

companies are starting to pursue overseas gas shale exploration in prospective

Access, infrastructure
Companies generally can develop
shale plays located in the US Midcontinent and East, where most land is
42

owned privately, with minimal political
wrangling. The fact that shale developments can cover entire counties means
that royalties are spread among thousands of individual landowners, often
aligning them with operators.
On the other hand, development of
eastern gas shales has raised concerns

A new breed of shale operators—
mostly mid to large-cap independents—emboldened by the improved
geologic understanding and production technologies, has leased millions
of shale-prospective acres. Most have
tacked adeptly through the recent economic turbulence, bolstered by price
hedging and supportive capital markets.
Hedging and financial inflows have
enabled operators to hold and develop
their best shale acreage in spite of (and
indeed exacerbating) the collapse of
spot gas prices.
In another industry step change,
during the past year majors such as
BG Group, BP PLC, ExxonMobil Corp.,
Shell Canada Ltd., and StatoilHydro have
entered shale plays in a significant way
through leasing and acquisition.
These include BP’s purchase of
Chesapeake’s Woodford shale properties for $1.75 billion, as well as the
company’s $1.9 billion deal for 25% of
Chesapeake’s Fayetteville shale position.
Shell acquired Duvernay Oil Corp.
for $5.9 billion, including extensive
Montney shale leases in Canada.
Statoil farmed into Chesapeake’s
Marcellus shale position for $3.3 billion.
BG Group acquired an interest in
Exco Resources Inc.’s Haynesville shale
acreage for $1.55 billion.

The Magnificent Seven
Including the Barnett, seven highquality new deep gas shale plays are
under development in North America:
five in the US and two in Canada.
The high-quality core areas of these
plays can have low overall full-cycle
“break-even” costs of $4-5/Mcf, while
the less favorable outer areas tend to
have much higher costs. Advances in
well drilling and completion technology would help lower the costs of

ly a million net acres including much
of the play’s core area, recently attained
the 1-bcfed benchmark. Others include
Chesapeake-BP, XTO Energy Inc., and
Petrohawk Enegy Corp.
Southwestern envisioned the play in
2002, drilled its first two vertical wells
in 2003 to confirm reservoir quality,
and eventually tested 33 pilots across its
acreage to evaluate geologic quality and
optimize well design.
Development started with vertical
wells but soon switched to horizontals
employing 2,500-ft laterals that were
stimulated with crosslink gel fracs.
By 2007, Southwestern evolved its
completion to longer laterals with slickwater fracs, both of which significantly
improved gas production.
Recent wells are positioned using 3D
seismic and typically employ 4,000+
ft laterals stimulated with a dozen or
more frac stages.
Today, wells cost about $2.9 million
(all-in), produce at initial rates of 3.0
MMcfd (30-day rate), and are expected
to recover about 3.0 bcf/well in the
core area. Active development continues
despite low gas prices.

Woodford (Oklahoma)
The western Arkoma basin hosts the
Mississippian-age Woodford shale play,
which currently produces about 0.5
bcfed. Newfield Exploration Co. began
to develop the play in 2006 and its
early success helped bolster the global
acceptance of deep shale as an exploration target.
The Woodford has some of the longest shale laterals drilled, up to 10,000
ft in the reservoir, thanks to enlightened
state well-spacing regulations. Overall
development, costs however, tend to be
relatively high in the Woodford and low
gas prices have severely curtailed drilling this year.
Production likely will plateau or even
decline until gas prices recover. Newfield, the largest shale operator in the
play, currently produces 240 MMcfed
but has recently begun to release many
of its rigs.

Woodford shale play occurs in the deep
Anadarko basin. This “Cana” play has
Haynesville-like 13,000-ft depths and is
highly overpressured. Leading operators
include Devon and Cimerex Energy Co.
While the play is not yet proven, early
well tests are encouraging.

Marcellus (Appalachia)
The Devonian Marcellus shale had
been productive for decades in this
region but in shallow settings. Then,
starting about 5 years ago, success in
the Barnett spurred operators to test
the deeper portions of the Marcellus

(5,000-9,000 ft depth) for the first
time.
Recent geologic resource studies
have helped quantify the potential of
this huge shale target, which stretches
from Kentucky to New York.
The USGS defined thickness, depth,
and other reservoir parameters in 2002,
conservatively estimating that the play
had 1.9 tcf of recoverable resources.6
Academic and industry studies have
since raised that estimate to as high as
500 tcf.
ARI’s internal study of the play
(using a database of more than 500
wells) puts recovery in the 100-200 tcf

more than 1,600 tcf total gas-in-place
resource.
Two Marcellus sweet spots have
emerged. Southwestern Pennsylvania
has fairly thick shale (100-150 ft) with
high TOC. Marginally mature (Ro ~1%),
this area produces wet gas that requires
surface separation facilities.
Early-mover Range Resources Corp.
has drilled 46 horizontal Marcellus
wells, mostly in Washington County
near Pittsburgh. Recent wells have an
average 7 MMcfed initial potential,
with one as high as 26 MMcfed (24-hr
rates).
Range estimates recovery at about
4.4 bcfe/well, with a horizontal well
estimated to cost $3.5 million (all-in).
The company estimates its total potentially recoverable resource from the
Marcellus at 15-22 tcfe.
CNX Gas Corp. also reports good
results in southwestern Pennsylvania,
where it has drilled eight horizontal
wells (6,000-ft vertical depth, 3,000ft laterals) costing about $3.5 million,
with initial potentials of up to 4.1
MMcfed.
Vertical wells also have been suc-

cessful in the Marcellus. Atlas Energy
Resources LLC has drilled more than
160 vertical Marcellus wells, with recent completions reported at 1.4 bcfe/
well and costing just slightly more
than $1 million/well. The company
has increased its estimate of potentially
recoverable resources on its acreage to
about 9 tcfe.
Although companies likely will
develop the Marcellus mainly with
horizontal wells, verticals still will play
a role.
A second sweet spot is developing
in northeast Pennsylvania and southcentral New York, where the Marcellus
is exceptionally thick (200-400 ft).
Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. has tested several
wells here with initial potential’s up to
9 MMcfed.
Ultra Oil & Gas Inc. has tested five
horizontal wells, each coming in at
more than 5.3 MMcfed (24-hr rates).
Talisman Energy Inc., Chief Oil & Gas
LLC, and Epsilon Energy Ltd. also report
high-rate wells in this area. Other operators include Chesapeake, Southwestern, and Range.
Overall, Marcellus shale production
currently is at about 200 MMcfed. Production is growing more slowly than

in other shale plays because of rugged
topography, a shortage of appropriate
drilling rigs, environmental and regulatory hurdles, and the sheer size of the
acreage, which must first be properly
evaluated.
With its low finding and development costs, however, the vast Marcellus
play may eventually reach or exceed
Barnett Shale production rates.

Haynesville (Louisiana/Texas)
In late 2007, the “buzz” was that
the massive Hayneville shale play in the
Louisiana Salt basin of northern Louisiana and East Texas could eventually
outshine even the Barnett shale.
The Haynesville shale is a Jurassic
shale, much younger than the Mississippian Barnett, Fayetteville, and Woodford plays. It is also deeper (10,00015,000+ ft), breaking the rules on
where successful shale plays could go.
With decent levels of porosity (812%) in the eastern portion of the play
area, the Haynesville is rich in brittle
carbonates and quartz, particularly in its
basal section.
The play’s substantial depth, extreme

overpressuring (up to 0.85 psi/ft),
huge size (>1,000 tcf of gas in place),
and rich resource concentration (>200
bcf/sq mile) place the Haynesville in
rarefied company.7 But amazingly, there
could be further upside: the overlying
Bossier shale offers a secondary gascharged completion target.
The primary challenge for the
Haynesville is the high-pressure, hightemperature drilling environment and
high resulting well costs of $10+ million. In addition, due to sharp initial
year declines, long-term production
and per-well reserves remain uncertain.
Companies still are defining the
Haynesville’s sweet spot. They have
drilled excellent wells in portions of
DeSoto, Caddo, Red River, and Bossier
parishes, northern Louisiana, clustering
around the 12-13,000 ft depth interval (Fig. 5). Core area wells frequently
have an initial potential in excess of 20
MMcfed (24-hr rate).
Depending on decline rates these
wells might be capable of producing
6-8 bcfe or more. Well costs are high

but expected to drop with operational
efficiencies such as pad drilling. Core
area wells look attractive even at $4/
MMbtu Henry Hub gas price.
The East Texas and extreme northern
Louisiana portions of the Haynesville
play are shallower (10-12,000 ft) and
thicker (up to 400 ft). Reservoir quality,
notably gas-filled porosity and brittle
mineral content, however, appears
lower. Wells typically have an initial
potential below 10 MMcfed and will require higher gas prices to be economic.
Early thinking was that fracturing would require costly synthetic
silicon carbide proppant for resisting
the Haynesville’s high pressures and
temperatures. Most operators, however,
have found low-cost resin-coated sand
proppant to be adequate.
Haynesville shale operators include
early-movers Chesapeake, EnCana Corp.,
Petrohawk, and Exco Resources, all with
large core area positions.
Two dozen other operators are testing the horizons below their legacy gas
fields, which produce from the Cotton
Valley, and are acquiring undeveloped
acreage.
Production, currently more than 1

bcfed, is growing
much faster than
in the Marcellus. Eventually
production could
approach Barnett
production.
In a possible
harbinger of deals
to come, BG
Group recently
agreed to pay Exco
$1.55 billion for
a 50% share of
certain upstream
and midstream
Haynesville assets in Louisiana.
Numerous other
operators are positioning to establish a stake in one
of North America’s
largest and lowest-

cost gas plays.

Horn River basin
A sequence of geologically attractive
gas shales exist in the Horn River basin,
in northeast British Columbia, with the
Late Devonian Muskwa shale the most
prominent. Often the Muskwa, Otter
Park, and Horn River sequences are
grouped within the broader Horn River
terminology (Fig. 6).
The Horn River basin has an areal
extent of about 5,000 sq miles. The
Muskwa-Horn River shale within this
basin is 300-500 ft thick in the heart of
the play, thinning to 100-150 ft to the
south near the Peace River arch.
Gas-filled porosity ranges 1-9%,
with 3-4% typical.
Thermal maturity is high (Ro =
2-4%), reflecting a dry gas setting.
There is potential for elevated CO2 in
the more thermally mature areas.
At a representative 8,000 ft depth,
the formation is overpressured with a
0.6 psi/ft reservoir pressure gradient.
The Muskwa shale is organically
rich, with an average 3% organic carbon content.

son of the Horn River basin Muskwa
and Fort Worth basin Barnett shale
wells. EOG Resources Inc. drilled both
wells in geologically favorable settings.
The figure shows that the Muskwa
shale is thicker and more mature,
providing higher gas concentration.
The Muskwa shale has a higher silica
content of 65% vs. 55% for the Barnett
shale, causing the Muskwa shale to be
more brittle and favorable for hydraulic fracturing. The Muskwa and Barnett
shale have similar permeabilities and
gas-filled porosities.
Seven major companies, led by EnCana and Apache Corp., hold significant
lease positions in the Horn River gas
shale play.
Horizontal well drilling has had
positive results, with initial rates of
3-10 MMcfd. Operators, however, are
still testing and optimizing their drilling and well completion strategies.
Market outlets and high transportation costs are a concern, as is gaining
year-round access to drilling sites.
Two new regional pipelines are under
development to bring gas to markets. A
24-in. line is due in service mid-2009
and a larger 36-in. line is due in service
by mid-2011.
Other innovative market options
include sending gas to the oil sands area
in northern Alberta as well as to coastal
Kitimat, BC, for export as LNG.

to the western portion of the play area.
The Mid to Lower Triassic-age deposit contains sandstones on the shallower
(3,000 ft) eastern boundary of the play,
grading to siltstone and shale in the
deeper (8,000 ft) western boundary of
the play.
In the western Montney play area,
near Dawson Creek, the gas shale is
thick, thermally mature with high organic content. In the northern portions
of the area, north of Fort St. John, the
Montney Shale has higher clay content and decreased silica, reducing the
brittleness of the formation and its favorability for creating reservoir permeability and flow capacity with hydraulic
stimulation.
While companies have drilled considerably in the eastern and central portions of the Montney resource play, they
only have drilled lightly the western gas
shale play. Early horizontal well performance in the geologically favorable
portions of the area, however, has been
attractive with initial 30-day gas rates of
5 MMcfd and relatively modest declines
for gas shale wells.
A large number of operators hold
leases in the heart of the Upper and
Lower Montney gas resource play, led
by EnCana (with about a million acres),
Shell (after its purchase of Duvernay Oil
in mid-2008), plus Talisman, Murphy
Oil Corp., and ARC Energy Trust. ✦

Understanding process key to shale gas development
Mark Parker
Halliburton,
Tyler,Tex.
Making hydrocarbon
production from shales
Production
a profitable venture
requires a process for
driving down overall costs. It is clear
from experience in these tight, widely
varying resource plays that companies
achieve an advantage through many
efficiencies reached during
the entire exploration and
development process.
The starting point is
critical to the success of this
process. Because shale varies
greatly, what works in one
reservoir or well probably
will not be as effective in
the next. Failure to understand the difference leads to
expensive miscalculations
and prolonged well development.
Each shale well and
reservoir requires a high degree of understanding to reach its full economic
potential. This is especially important
when exploring new shale formations
for which knowledge is a key factor in
the speed and efficiency of bringing on
production.
Lessens learned in exploiting the
Barnett shale in north-central Texas,
have helped form processes for evaluating and developing the Haynesville
shale to the east of the Barnett and the
emerging Eagle Pass shale south of the
Barnett.

Need to know
The need to know cannot be emphasized strongly enough. Reservoir
knowledge guides a multitude of
choices that can make or break a shale
well, including critical steps in designing optimal fracture treatments.
Understanding the reservoir in these
complex unconventional resources entails a rigorous grasp of rock properties,
fracture geometry, fluid interactions,
evaluation processes, microseismic

surveys, tracers, and production logs. It
also requires sharing this information
across disciplines so that insights are
leveraged as effectively as possible.
Collaboration among geoscientists
and engineers is central to improving shale exploitation. Having a single
strategy for the entire well rather than
a series of discrete operations enables
everyone on the asset team to make
decisions with full knowledge of how
actions affect total well objectives.
Specialized processes for shale
analysis and stimulation design facilitate
this effort. For instance, Halliburton’s

ShaleEval shale formation evaluation
service forms expert shale teams that
integrate geology and engineering in a
process that examines fluids, the fracture treatment, formation evaluations,
and candidate selection.
The process also uses shale-specific
systems to identify mineralogy and
integrate wireline log data and laboratory core analysis to help define shale
characteristics. The information guides
fracture treatment design by helping
identify targets, which is
critical to well performance
in shale reservoirs. These
systems are components of
a life-cycle-based approach
to developing shale reserves
that Halliburton uses to
integrate asset management from the first look at
reservoir potential through
development stages and
decline.
Ultimately, this knowledge sharing facilitates a
holistic view of the reservoir
throughout its development, which
brings with it the various insights
needed to create shared efficiencies and
synergies.

Formation description
Companies can acquire reservoir
information with basic logging suites.
Their primary purpose is exploration
and calculation of reservoir fluids. But
new analysis and presentation techniques provide a comprehensive formation description that is routinely verified and calibrated with core analysis.

example, formation lithology is identified with natural gamma ray tools to
measure elevated uranium signals that
are common indicators of shales rich in
organic matter and total organic carbon
(TOC). When they also exhibit sufficient porosity, these shales typically are
productive.
Information also comes from resistivity measurements that indicate fluid
saturation and permeability in the shale.

can be an early indictor that the shale
may not respond well to treatment.
Density logs and dual count neutron
logs indicate shale porosity and the
associated reservoir capacity for storing
fluids. Acoustic logs, which record the
velocity of compressional and shear
waves through the formation, are used
to generate stress data, which help predict the behavior of hydraulic fracturing treatments that are critical to shale
production.
Images of the formation acquired
with electrical borehole imaging tools
provide views of the sedimentary
sequences in the wellbore. This information is used to plan optimal horizontal well trajectories in shales, guide
sidewall-coring points and identify
pressure dependent leak-off points from
small fractures.
Magnetic resonance logging provides
data on the fluids in the pore spaces as
well as other formation parameters such
as pore size, calculated permeability and
presence of clays. In shale wells, these
data cover the long, continuous intervals at reservoir conditions with less
expense than conventional core data.

Building on the Barnett
Much of what is known about the
mysteries of shale rests on lessons
learned in developing commercial
production out of the Barnett shale in
north-central Texas. In pioneering this
resource play, companies have applied
innovative new technologies and methods subjected to almost daily changes.
But successful techniques hammered
out in the Barnett are not easily trans-

ferred to new and emerging shale plays.
Experience proves that methodology is
the most important constant in shale
development, not discrete techniques.
Using a process that starts with reservoir knowledge is key for selecting
the most appropriate techniques and
achieving the highest efficiencies.
To the east of the Barnett, the
Haynesville shale straddles the borders
between Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas
in one of the oldest productive regions
in the US.
While the Haynesville is also a tightgas shale, the comparison of its relatively ductile rock with the Barnett shale is
one of peanut butter to peanut brittle.
Understandably, wells in these two
shales are not completed in the same
way. Fig. 1 shows various shale samples.
First drilled in 2005, the reservoir is
deep at about 10,500-14,000 ft and hot
with bottomhole temperatures as high
as 380° F. Bottomhole pressures can
exceed 12,000 psi and treating pressures climb to 15,000 psi. Its laminated
shales include soft ductile intervals that
can cause proppant embedment and
fines problems.
There is vigorous discussion about
how best to produce this resource and a
correspondingly diverse set of produc-

tion successes and failures. That has
resulted in a competitive learning curve
in this promising play as operators seek
to exploit it economically.

Haynesville treatments
Reservoir knowledge is proving to
be the best starting point for unraveling the Haynesville shale. A Halliburton
study of modeled stimulations to test
various treatment strategies has further
defined fundamental differences in rock
character and reservoir conditions compared with the Barnett shale.
The study reviews the design processes and technologies recommended
to achieve the best production results.1
Its results are not indicative of any one
particular well or set of reservoir characteristics.
Simulations conducted in the study
indicate that formation brittleness is a
valuable guide to identifying fracture
initiation points. Perforating and fracturing from these intervals are critical
to successful stimulation.
The study also shows that lowviscosity fluid systems do not provide
adequate proppant transport and suspension to achieve long-term productivity in this formation. The Haynesville,
however has successful simulations with

crosslinked gel fracture treatments containing high-conductivity proppants.
The successes were attributed to better wellbore-to-fracture communication
established by proppant distribution
throughout the created fracture height
and length.

Fluid systems
In simulating a variety of treatment
designs, the Haynesville shale study
model consisted of a typical 4,000-ft
lateral section broken into stages of
about 300-400 ft. Within the stages
were 3-4 perforation sets of 2-4 ft in
length with a perforation density of 6
shots/ft.
To simplify the simulation, the study
evaluated a single fracture created in
a horizontal wellbore. It selected fluid
systems based on rock properties.
The Haynesville shale is a generally
ductile formation with relatively low
Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio.
Identification of brittle areas is important because these are the best targets
for fracture initiation. But there are
concerns too. These areas have signifi52

cant lime content that can cause fines
problems if acid is applied.
Clays are also present and can result
in fines and swelling damage in response to water-based fluids.
The study also simulated multiple
treatment designs to address treatments in the Haynesville shale that vary
from high-rate, treated-water fractures,
hybrids of treated water and linear gel,
and hybrids of linear gel to crosslinked
gels.
Water fractures with low proppant
concentrations and large water volumes
provide minimal conductivity damage
and low costs. Linear-gel systems have
good friction-reduction properties,
similar to the water fractures with friction reducer.
Crosslinked-gel fracturing fluid
systems allow treatment at lower pump
rates, with smaller fluid volumes and
provide the ability to place highconductivity proppants. Placing highconductivity proppants is not attempted
with low-viscosity fluids because of the
poor proppant transport and narrow
fracture widths.

The fluid efficiency and excellent
proppant transport
of crosslinked systems can maximize
formation surfacearea contact and
communication
with the wellbore to
achieve the benefits
of the long, horizontal sections with
spaced fractures
communicating with
the wellbore.
High-viscosity
fluids help establish
a dominant fracture to accept larger
high-strength proppants (20/40 mesh).
In addition, more
effective proppant
transport provides
a longer effective
fracture with direct
communication at the wellbore.
Fig. 2 shows a typical fracturing
spread on a Haynesville well.

Proppant options
High temperatures and pressures
make proppant selection in the Haynesville important for short and longterm production. Cleanup and early
production following fracturing are
the immediate issues. But over time as
reservoir pressure depletes, the increasingly stressful environment becomes
the greater consideration.
Fracture conductivity may be the
most important parameter for longterm production of the Haynesville
shale. Initial closure stress on the proppant in the fracture may start at more
than 6,000 psi. As production continues, the stress increases and can exceed
12,000 psi.
For water-frac treatments, conductivity issues include initial conductivity,
two-phase flow (gas and water), proppant crushing and fines, and proppant
embedment in the fracture face.

Start at the beginning
The effort under way to understand
the Eagle Ford is the hallmark of success
in gas shales. Clearly, this emerging play
varies from the Haynesville shale, which
is markedly different from the Barnett
and other shales around the world.
The only way to approach economic development of these resources
is by first understanding their unique
characteristics. That knowledge guides a

to increase the reliability, efficiency—
and profitability—of its production
assets. The refinery’s legacy Honeywell
TDC2000 distributed control system
was originally installed in 1978.
As part of a plant expansion, the
human-machine interface platform had
been upgraded to the TotalPlant Solution platform with Global User Station
capabilities. The aging data highway
system no longer provided reliable
day-to-day operation. Spare parts and
support were also becoming scarce.
In addition, the legacy DCS did not

increase throughput, reduce costs and
improve regulatory compliance, and
answer customer demands for better
product quality and faster delivery.
Marathon’s initial attempt to migrate
to Experion PKS for control of a crude
unit was hampered by a lack of coor-

dination among project participants, as
well as insufficient computing capacity
to handle demanding process-control
functions. Through various trials, the
refinery migrated its first TDC2000 Data
Hiway to an Experion R200 system in
2004.
A subsequent migration project
began in early 2007, when Marathon
decided to convert a second Data Hiway
to an Experion Version R301 system.
This project encompassed a diesel
hydrotreater, gas-oil hydrotreater and
reformer, and a naphtha hydrotreater.
The work entailed moving about
1,400 control wire pairs to new
marshalling panels, field termination
assemblies, and process manager input/
output modules, as well as migrating all
advanced process-control functions to
the new Experion platform.
For this migration, Marathon and

Honeywell established a collaborative
strategy based on common goal: To
meet and exceed all end-user expectations and design requirements for
implementation of a state-of-the-art
automation architecture.

Keys
During normal operations, refineries
are reluctant to schedule shutdowns for
non-critical maintenance or replacement of field equipment. Therefore,
control system migrations are typically
executed via a “hot cutover,” which
involves moving one control loop at a
time to the new system, while the unit
operates in order to eliminate production losses.
A hot cutover also provides immediate feedback that the instrumentation is
connected and working properly and is
viewed as having overall lower risks to
operations.

system, which included seven Honeywell redundant C300 controllers, one
redundant C200 controller, two ACE
nodes, OPC servers, process data historian interfaces, seven operator consoles,
two engineering work stations, and

redundant Experion system servers.
The system configuration allowed new
control hardware and cabinetry to be
installed in the refinery’s existing infrastructure.
As part of the design process, engineers looked at the maximum data-de-

They also considered
all aspects of the

including input/output processor (IOP)
scan rates, control
module execution,
peer-to-peer subscription (PPS) rates,
PPS for advanced
application controller nodes, console

and subscribed

Their goal was to
reduce unnecessary
peer-to-peer communications among
Experion C300 controllers, while ensuring a minimum of
50% free CPU under
normal conditions.

In terms of HMI graphics performance, the project team defined
reasonable limits for the number of
parameters on each display, ensuring
operators are not overwhelmed by the
amount of data on their HMI panels.
Parameters are updated no faster than
necessary, and displays come up quickly
and are uncluttered. Operators can also
utilize standard shapes optimized for
performance.
During electrical and instrumentation installation, new multi-conductor
instrument wiring cables were run
from the field junction box to the marshalling panel. The system was configured with field termination assemblies
installed in separate cabinets, providing
a standard 20% unassigned I/O spare
capacity. Cables were prewired to the
MP and FTAs, and terminations and tag
labeling were reviewed during system

performance under different operating
scenarios. This included detailed trending to monitor system components
throughout various levels of system

operating conditions to ensure the system would perform under an extreme
situation in which the data requests are
at an extreme or abnormal level.

Results, future

Marathon’s project team met its
schedule for completing the 2007 control system migration, resulting in the
hot cutover of 1,400 wire pairs during
a 6-week period.
Phase I of the project, implemented
in August 2007, provided operator
stations with direct connections to
the local control network for data and
alarms. In addition, it provided servers
with direct connection to the LCN for
read/write to support history collection, advanced process control, data
from third-party systems located in the
field (Fig. 3).
Phase II, the addition of the new
Experion hardware, was completed in

People tend to focus on consequences and not likelihood. Asteroids
do strike the earth, and when they do,
the consequences are dire. Yet we make
no provisions for asteroid insurance
because the likelihood of one hitting us
is so close to zero the resulting risk is
essentially zero.
Acting to alter either component
of the equation—likelihood and
consequences—can reduce risk. If you
can’t reduce the likelihood, then you
try to reduce the consequences. If you
can’t alter the consequences, you try to
reduce the likelihood.
In financial terms, risk is generally
stated as a financial loss experienced
as the result of a successful attack; an
amount that is usually annualized to
reflect the probable time span during
which such an attack is likely to occur.
Annualized exposure is then used to
justify the amount of funding invested
in reducing the risk.
A strictly financial risk analysis, however, can’t easily accommodate issues
not conveniently expressible in dollars,
such as loss of life or effects on the
national economy and security. It also
has difficulty determining the time span
over which an event becomes likely to
occur.
A qualitative assessment can address

EQUATION
Risk ≈ Likelihood of an event * consequences of an event.

of potential cyber attack threat agents
includes:
• Malware (malicious software such
as viruses and worms).
• Human error (mistakes, poorly
trained insiders, poor procedures, etc).
• Insiders (disaffected or angry employees, contractors, etc).
• Former insiders (terminated employees, contractors, etc.).
• Outsiders (hired hacker groups,
terrorists, criminal groups, etc.).
Terrorist groups either have, or can
hire, the technical expertise to stage a
cyber assault, if they so choose. One
could argue physically protecting a
long-distance pipeline is nearly impossible, and thus a physical attack is more
likely than a cyber attack. But as the
government makes it harder for terrorists to enter the country or operate
inside the country, a cyber attack may
become more probable.
Environmental activists are also
included among the threatening outsiders and have staged attacks and made
threats against pipeline operators.8 Organized crime (both inside and outside
the US) has found cyber crime pays
well, but there is no clear and obvious
motivation for those groups to target
pipelines, except possibly for extortion
and blackmail.

cyber risk analysis include it as a credible and probable threat agent. Human
error often plays a part in cyber attacks.
Many malware infections are delivered
accidentally by uninformed or careless employees. Many successful hacker
attacks on systems are enabled by
employees using simple, easy-to-guess
passwords. Poorly trained employees
might also fall for social engineering
tricks and reveal confidential information enabling a successful attack.
Employee training and education
are a critical element of cyber security
because human error frequently defeats
expensive technical protective measures.
Well developed and clearly explained
policies and procedures are key components in an overall cyber security
program.
Whether a given pipeline organization has current or former employees,
contractors, or consultants with the
needed skills and a desire to cause harm
or a monetary incentive to do so is a
question each organization must answer
itself. But according to the US Federal
Bureau of Investigation, insider-initiated
incidents of intentional industrial sabotage have been increasing steadily during the past 10 years. Mergers, downsizing, reorganizing, and outsourcing
have led to growing disaffection among
both hourly and salaried workers.

Institute over a 6-year interval. Disgruntled employees are a major factor

This article classifies a cyber asset as:
• A computer or intelligent device
containing a microprocessor and some
form of communications interface.
• A local or wide-area communications infrastructure and associated
components.
• Software (including operating
system, networking, and application
programs), data, and configuration
information contained by a computer
or intelligent device.
• Information-documentation about
any of the above (regardless of format)
that would, if accessed by a threat agent,
expose or create exploitable vulnerabilities.
Making critical information (such
as user account information) or critical
documentation (network EthernetMAC, IP addresses, etc.) available to
a computer-knowledgeable attacker,
would make his efforts to penetrate
critical systems both easier and more
likely to succeed.

further differentiation of these assets. If
the consequences are unacceptable, the
asset is critical.
All-encompassing security is an
unrealistic and potentially hugely
expensive goal. Cyber security should
therefore focus primarily on protecting
critical cyber assets.

Communications interfaces
In addition to developing an inventory of cyber assets, the beginning of
a risk-assessment process should also
diagram communications’ interfaces,
showing all interconnections between
and among assets. This documentation,
however, would itself be a cyber asset
and would need to be treated as confidential information.
Table 1 shows examples of the types
of things falling into each of the four
cyber asset categories.
Creating a communications interconnection diagram is an essential step
in risk assessment because to launch
a cyber attack, the attacker must have
some communications mechanism
providing him access to your cyber
assets. Such a communications path
could be a telephone circuit, a wireless network connection, a local area
network Ethernet connection, or even a
connection created through an existing
connection to another network (such as
the internet).
One of the most basic and ubiquitous communication mechanisms
usually goes unnoticed when addressing communications access: the manual
transfer of files from one computer to
another. Portable electronic devices and
removable storage media provide literally dozens of ways in which malware
can be delivered to a target system.
Identification of communication access
points therefore ought to include CD
and DVD drives, USB, Firewire (IEEE1394), PCMCIA and Ethernet ports, and
memory stick slots (Compact Flash, SD,
miniSD, microSD, and smartCards).
Many seemingly innocuous devices
with a USB connection—digital cameras, digital video recorders, MP3 players, and many color printers—actually

contain integral file systems and storage
that can deliver malware to a target
system (Fig. 2). They could, of course,
also be used to carry away sensitive and
confidential files copied from a critical system. Installing a certain major
vendor’s printer driver or just accessing an infected printer over a local area
network has led to viruses being spread
to computer systems; the Funlove virus
for example.
A good starting point for a com-

munications interconnection diagram is
to create an up-to-date, detailed system
block diagram for the SCADA system
monitoring and operating the pipeline.
This diagram should show all key components, as well as all of the communications interfaces between and among
these components.
Fig. 3 is an example of a representative SCADA system block diagram, with
the level of detail typical of the level

of what might be found on most such
drawings. Such a diagram usually shows
interconnections between and among
local system components and at least
the SCADA system end of interconnections to other systems and networks.
But it usually won’t indicate what is at
the other end of a wide area network
interconnection (e.g., the corporate
WAN leading to the Internet).
Another important communications interface often unnoticed and
undocumented consists of alternative
communication interfaces installed in
computers attached to critical local area
networks. Most new laptop PCs come
with integral Ethernet interfaces, and
most will also have a built-in analog
telephone modem, integral WiFi, and
frequently even an integral Bluetooth
wireless adapter. The same can be true
of desktop PCs.
These alternate communication
interfaces can make a simultaneous
communication connection, offering
a path through the PC to the local network connected via the Ethernet port.
It is important to note the presence
of these interfaces when constructing a system network interconnection
diagram.
Pretty much all PCs today, when interfaced to a local area network (LAN),
will be using one of the variations of
Ethernet and will be running an IP
protocol stack on top, causing TCP-IP
networking to be used between and
among local computers.
The strength of IP-based networking
lies in establishing a connection, re68

gardless of the number of intermediate
computers. Inside IP-networked PCs is a
layer of communications software (the
IP layer) that will route message traffic
if it arrives at the PC on one communications connection but is not actually
addressed to that particular PC. In such
instances IP will look for another available communications connection and
send the message off on that alternate
path (Fig. 4).
If a PC is connected to a critical LAN,
such as the SCADA system’s LAN, and
has an enabled wireless adapter, then
an attacker could connect to its wireless interface and pass through the PC
onto the SCADA’s LAN. The same can be
true for a PC with an active telephone
dial-up or cellular-based connection to
the Internet, while also connected via
Ethernet to the SCADA LAN.
Both scenarios offer a communications path an attacker could use. It is
also important to identify any computers with dual Ethernet adapters connected, via these two different Ethernet
adapters, to a critical LAN and a nonsecure LAN, as the same kind of routing
function can occur. An example might
be a PC connected to the SCADA LAN
and also to a site business LAN including an Internet connection.
This is not the same as having two
Ethernet adapters for the purpose of
network redundancy. The example
SCADA system block diagram Fig. 3 incorporates redundant LAN switches and
Ethernet interfaces, to improve system
reliability and availability not with two

different networks, but one replicated
(redundant) network.
If Ethernet switches are used to
create the local LAN(s) connecting all
SCADA system components, and there
are unassigned ports on those switches,
such a block diagram may not show if
those ports are active or disabled. An
insider who can access such a switch,
however, can use a free port to connect
to the SCADA LAN, unless all such ports
are disabled. If VLAN (virtual local area
network) technology segments equipment into logical groups, this information should also be documented on
such a drawing.
Such system block diagrams may,
or may not, make it clear what type of
communications connection technology is present for each connection. The
drawing also may not clearly show what
protocol support is in place on each
such circuit shown. Knowing some of
these details can help assess the risk
of a possible cyber attack via a communications interface; the details of the
interface showing the potential level of
vulnerability.
Information about what the other
end of each communications interface
looks like, and to what the system at
that other end may be connected (such
as the Internet) will often be missing
from a SCADA’s block diagram. It is
good policy to assume the other end of
any communications circuit you do not
fully control is not secure.

lish parameters for gauging the impact
of a successful attack against a critical
asset. The results (consequences) of a
successful attack on a pipeline, or associated facility, be it physical or cyber in
nature, can be organized into a manageable number of consequence categories.
These can then be qualitatively ranked
based on increasing level of seriousness,
using a variety of topic-specific rating
criteria.
Table 2 provides an example of a
potential consequences-ranking matrix
using seven criteria. The quantity and
types of criteria, and their severity
rankings, will vary from one pipeline
organization to another, but the general
need to create such a qualitative consequence matrix and make a business
determination as to what level of consequences can and cannot be tolerated
remains.
At this point in a risk-assessment
process, the likelihood of a successful
attack still must be addressed. Looking
at cyber assets and considering attack
scenarios in an attempt to answer the
questions what would happen if this
asset were made unavailable, and how
could an attacker bring this about?
Answering the “How” part of the
question requires an understanding of
what (cyber) vulnerabilities exist and
how they could be exploited by an attacker. Identifying the communications
interfaces is key to making a vulnerability assessment because cyber attacks
cannot occur without some form of
communications channel between the
attacker and critical cyber assets.
A commercially available assessment
methodology and associated tools can
formalize the process of making a vulnerability assessment. These methodologies can help gather relevant information about your systems and networks
and help generate a vulnerability assessment based on these data.
Vulnerability assessment methods
fall into two categories: active and passive. An active vulnerability assessment
involves actually trying to break into
one’s own systems using hacker tools

70

such as Metasploit, Nmap, and Nessus,
a process called penetration (or pen)
≠testing.
The primary problem with making
an active vulnerability assessment on
an operating system is the real possibility of disabling the SCADA system
being assessed. Active assessments are
best done on either backup systems or
on test-training-support systems. Such
tools require expertise and it is best to
hire experts to perform an active vulnerability assessment.
Passive vulnerability assessments
evaluate the available communication
paths into critical cyber assets, reviewing known computer and communication system vulnerabilities before
applying approaches such as fault tree
analysis or failure mode effect analysis
to derive a scenario probability and
severity estimate. The industrial automation sector uses a number of passive
vulnerability assessment methodologies (some with software tools to help
automate the process), including some
developed by end-user organizations.
The Idaho National Laboratory has
established a national SCADA test bed
for studying SCADA system vulnerabilities and has published various articles
and papers providing guidance in this
area. The American Petroleum Institute,
in conjunction with the Process Control
Systems Forum, has a working group
on defining SCADA cyber security selfassessment methodologies. IBM offers
the IBM Internet Security Systems ISS-X
program and consulting services.
The US Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Assurance offers a well
written and comprehensive do-it-yourself guide to Vulnerability Assessment
Methodology,9 specifically developed
for the electric power industry, but
highly SCADA-oriented. It addresses a
comprehensive range of vulnerabilities,
both physical and cyber. ✦

RIK management,
not concept, led to
program’s demise
If the US government can’t manage oil
and gas royalties taken in kind, how can
anyone expect it to handle a shady market
for greenhouse-gas emission credits?
Interior Sec. Ken Salazar plans to kill
the federal royalty-in-kind (RIK) program. A
leasing reform bill in the House would do
the same thing. That’s bad news for oil and
gas producers, for whom the program offers a clear advantage: It precludes fights

over valuation. When the government
takes its royalty in kind, few questions can
arise over sticky issues such as valuation
points and price proxies.
With RIK, the government receives its
share of production and either sells or
stores it. What can be simpler? With government, nothing’s simple. Since its evolution from pilot programs in the late 1990s,
the modern RIK program has never worked
without doubts about management.
In 1996, Johnnie Burton, then director of the Minerals Management Service,
requested an internal investigation of the
RIK program, which MMS administers.
Results weren’t cheery. The investigation uncovered weak controls and
misbehavior by MMS employees. MMS’s
reputation suffered.
Now a Government Accountability Office study says MMS may be collecting too
little royalty because of accounting lapses.
That the RIK program has problems is
clear. But legitimacy of the concept isn’t
one of them. The decision to scrap the
whole program is, therefore, regrettable.
It will replace administrative problems
at MMS with valuation disputes, which
inevitably arise between leaseholders and
royalty owners. When the royalty owner
is the US government, those disputes
become political. Oil and gas producers
shouldn’t welcome the change.
The decision, moreover, implies not
only that the RIK program is broken but
also that it can’t be fixed. It says the government can’t manage it.
Yet Congress soon might place a
comparable mechanism in charge of a
nebulous market for emissions credits.
Instead of physical quantities of oil and
gas at known locations, transactions under
the proposed cap-and-trade system would
involve rights to emit greenhouse gas
worldwide. Values would depend largely
on government decisions.
Against the politically charged complexity of that program, RIK administration
would look like managerial child’s play.

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

Deloitte: Trade problems loom
Position limits being considered by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission to eliminate “excessive” market speculation could create problems for
companies trading energy commodities, said John England, managing partner for
energy in Deloitte & Touche LLP’s markets consulting practice. Proposed regulatory changes would affect hedge funds, banks, insurance, and other firms, said England. “It is important for most energy market participants to consider the potential
impacts of these proposed rule changes on their ability to manage risk,” he said.
To centrally regulate the OTC market, all transactions would be through monitored clearing exchanges. “Although it is expected that the exchanges would adapt
by offering a greater variety of OTC products, it is unlikely that the products would
cover all possible trading locations, product specs, and time frames,” England
said. “This could cause a decrease in the variety of instruments available today for
laying off basis risk and may decrease the trading activity in high-risk, high-margin
markets.” He added, “If nonphysical transacting entities are limited in the volume
of derivatives they can trade, the demand for these instruments may become low
enough that it would not make economic sense for the exchanges to offer a wide
variety, thus further limiting the ways that companies can manage or mitigate their
basis risk.”
England noted, “Typically in commodity markets, a decrease in liquidity results
in higher bid-offer spreads and potentially higher costs to hedge in the market.
This could have a large impact on both market participants (potentially unable
to hedge adequately) and exchanges, as roughly one quarter of their revenue is
derived from energy trading.” A decrease in the variety of products offered in the
US market could trigger a shift to other global exchanges and increase exposure to
foreign currency and foreign governments, he said.
“The proposed rules could lead to an increase in margin call activity for derivatives normally traded directly with counterparties or through a broker on credit
terms. Forcing transactions to clear on a more transparent clearing exchange
rather than through OTC means would result in more cash being required to support deals and less ability to rely on credit,” England said.
Problems in laying off risk could make it more onerous to value positions and
risk exposure at less-liquid points. “In short, it could become much more difficult
to price a large number of physical markets,” said England.
Increased red tape
Information requirements and disclosure expectations are likely to be more
frequent and more detailed under the new regulations. “Since the content of the
reporting would come directly from existing trading systems where their financial positions are maintained, companies will need to determine whether these
systems are reliable and support regular reporting,” England said. “In some
instances, these activities could lead to the need for significant investments in
infrastructure (processes and systems), increasing costs and potentially squeezing
razor-thin profit margins.”
He said, “Should the proposed rules come into force, there is a high probability that the reporting requirements and expectations regarding transparency
would rise in lockstep. Institutions transacting energy contracts on US exchanges
would have to report to the CFTC on volumes in addition to the standards they
are currently meeting. Regulatory oversight could expand into areas beyond the
regulation of markets by treading into the regulation of speculative behavior, price
movement, and price volatility. With an increase in reporting, this would heighten
the risk of misreporting and subject entities to potential fines.”
Regulators in both the US and UK are working to share information so as to
more effectively track global market manipulation. If the US passes legislation to
centralize regulation, it may also pursue an international agreement for regulatory
standards in the major global markets, increasing the impact and reach of regulatory changes.
However, England said the global nature of energy markets makes it difficult
for the CFTC to manage position limits. To be effective, the majority of exchanges
worldwide would have to employ similar restrictions. If regulators and the International Organization of Securities Commissions are unable to spearhead a global
response, “commercial transactions will naturally migrate to less onerous markets,
again drying liquidity and potentially increasing transactional risk,” he said.

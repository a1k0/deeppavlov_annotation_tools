COVER
Development drilling continues on the Pinedale anticline of western
Wyoming that contains large volumes of natural gas in tight
sands. Discovered in the 1930s, active development of this resource
only began in the last few years as improved downhole tools and
techniques made recovery of this gas economic. OGJ’s special report
starting on p. 39 discusses the procedures Shell Exploration &
Production Co. employs for developing this gas.The second article
in the special covers advances that allow the use of coiled tubing to
drill 10,000-ft wells. Photo from Shell.

We’ve got your back.
BT’s got ours.
You’ve bought the firewalls, the security appliances,
filters, servers and software. But technology alone
doesn’t stop attacks. Vigilance does.
Counterpane has always helped petroleum
companies monitor and manage their assets, detect
attacks and respond quickly – before the IT hits the fan.

Now we’re even stronger, as part of BT, the global
powerhouse in networked IT services.
BT Counterpane takes the burden of vigilance from
the shoulders of your security staff so they can focus
on your business. No one sees more kinds of attack.
No one understands security better. No one does
what we do, the way we do it. Who’s got your back?

Turkmen leader welcomes foreign investment
Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov, Turkmenistan’s new president, is changing the country’s direction and is seeking foreign
investment in his country’s oil and gas sector.
Berdymukhammedov, who came to power last December following the death of former President Saparmurat Niyazov, in a
recent speech showed his determination to open the country to
foreign investment, a policy that Niyazov did not observe.
“We pay great attention to cooperation with leading companies
in [the development of oil and gas fields] on the sea, in expanding
and upgrading the network of gas pipelines, forming a national tanker fleet, and constructing new sea terminals,” Berdymukhammedov said over Turkmen TV’s Altyn Asyr channel.
“Turkmenistan is successfully dealing with delivering its natural resources to the world market via various routes,” Berdymukhammedov said in televised remarks at a June 5 ceremony
dedicated to the construction of a gas storage facility in western
Turkmenistan.
“We are still adhering to our initiatives on the construction of
Turkmenistan-China, Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India gas
pipelines as well as a Turkmenistan-Europe gas pipeline via the Caspian Sea,” Berdymukhammedov said.
State newspaper Neutral Turkmenistan said Berdymukhammedov and Lukoil Chief Executive Vagit Alekperov reached an agreement at a June 12 meeting in Ashgabat, the Turkmen capital, stipulating Russia’s OAO Lukoil Holdings to develop three fields in the
Caspian Sea.
The paper said Lukoil plans to begin developing the “promising
hydrocarbon fields” off Turkmenistan on the Caspian Sea shelf “in
the near future.” It did not identify the fields.
Berdymukhammedov also met with TNK-BP Chief Executive
Robert Dudley to discuss the Anglo-Russian firm’s interest in developing Turkmen oil fields.

A TNK-BP company spokesman said it was the first meeting of
the company’s leadership with the Turkmen president and that further meetings should be held to discuss details of potential deals.

Nigeria to prioritize gas for domestic use
Nigeria’s new president, Umaru Musa Yar’Adua, has asked Nigeria National Petroleum Corp. (NNPC) to draw up a plan for
providing gas for domestic needs, particularly power generation.
Yar’Adua recently held a 3-hr meeting with senior NNPC officials,
led by Group Managing Director Funsho Kupolokun.
Nigeria has 187 tcf of proved gas reserves, and Yar’Adua’s requirement of NNPC raises questions about supplies for future gas
export projects. Nigeria currently utilizes 2,000 Mw of power and
wants to increase its power generation capacity to 12-15 Gw. An
NNPC spokesman told OGJ that Nigeria would continue to honor
its international commitments for gas supplies that have been set
aside for export either as pipeline gas or LNG.
Local reports quoted Yar’Adua as saying “We cannot begin to
address, in a fundamental manner, the problems of the economy
until we successfully tackle the power and energy issue. It is critical to all my plans. So I am more interested in how much gas we
can tap for domestic use than what we can get for export. We must
power this economy.”
Criminal activities in the Niger Delta have cut oil production by
almost a quarter, with production shut-ins in May reaching a high
of nearly 1 million b/d and averaging more than 800,000 b/d for
the month (OGJ Online, June 11, 2007).
Yar’Adua has stressed that it is his priority to deal with these
criminal activities through development in the region and enforcement of the law.
Meanwhile he will consult the National Assembly and stakeholders on the intervention plan. ✦

Oil found in Ghana’s deepwater Mahogany-1 well
Anadarko Petroleum Corp. and its partners have discovered light
oil with the Mahogany-1 exploration well drilled on deepwater
West Cape Three Points block off Ghana. The well, a Santonian turbidite stratigraphic trap, opens a new play fairway in the Tano basin.
Mahogany-1 encountered a 885-ft gross hydrocarbon column
with 312 ft of net stacked pay in a Cretaceous sandstone reservoir.
The well has so far reached 12,083 ft and is aiming for a TD of
13,780 ft. An Anadarko spokesman told OGJ that the well was targeting a Cretaceous formation. West Cape Three Points block lies in
4,330 ft of water.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Once the partners hit TD, they will suspend the well pending
further evaluation and appraisal drilling.
Mahogany-1 is being drilled by the Belford Dolphin deepwater drillship, which is under long-term contract to Anadarko. After
finishing that well, Anadarko will use it to drill the Sota-1 well on
Block 4 off Benin, in which it holds a 40% interest and is also the
operator. Belford Dolphin will then move to the Gulf of Mexico to
drill additional tests in Anadarko’s 2007 exploration program.
Anadarko is the technical operator of the well with a 30.875%
interest. Kosmos Energy is the block operator and holds a 30.875%
stake. Other partners are Tullow Ghana Ltd. 22.896%, Sabre Oil &

Pertra to drill on Norwegian North Sea license
Pertra ASA of Trondheim, Norway, and its partners plan to drill
two exploration wells in 2008 on Production License 321 in the
Norwegian North Sea. The group will target a prospect in sandstone from the late Jurassic period, which was deposited on the
western flank of Frøyhøgda, which is a basement high.
The well will be drilled to 2,000 m TD. Under the first phase
of the work program, 800 sq km of 3D seismic data have been
collected.
The group won the license in Norway’s 18th licensing round,
which specified that the exploration period will extend until summer of 2010. License partners are Pertra 25% (operator), Talisman
Energy 40%, Norsk Hydro 20%, and Aker Exploration 15%.
Aker Exploration will pay the cost for Pertra’s share of the two
first exploration wells in this license, Pertra said.

requested a better split in connection with its operations on the
Krueng Mane block in Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam, while Santos
is seeking a better split together with additional incentives for its
operations on the Jeruk block in East Java.
Luthfi said the companies’ requests, said to be for a split of
51:49 in favor of the government, were based on one that had been
applied in Block A in Aceh, where operators, including Eni and
Santos, had also encountered difficulties in developing the block.
Luthfi said the two companies’ requests were informal and that official requests had yet to be filed.
Last month, Eni said it found significant oil and gas deposits in
its Tulip-1 exploration well drilled in 800 m of water northeast of
Kalimantan Island, Indonesia (OGJ Online, May 14, 2007).

Nexen developing Alberta Mannville coal gas

Nexen Inc., Calgary, has a $200 million budget in 2007 to develop 98 gross/41 net sections of Cretaceous Mannville coalbed
methane in Alberta.
The company is drilling single and multileg horizontal wells in
the Corbett, Doris, and Thunder areas near Fort Assiniboine.
The company estimated 3 tcf of gas in place on more than 700

Production

Heritage starts oil production from Siberian ﬁeld
Heritage Oil Corp. has begun oil production from one well at
its Zapadno Chumpasskoye field in Western Siberia. Russian federal
and local authorities have approved a pilot development project for
the field that includes the drilling of more than 50 wells.
The producing well—No. 226—flowed freely at a rate of up to
540 b/d of 39° gravity oil through an 8-mm choke, with wellhead
pressure of 4,140 psi. The well produced a total of 4,086 bbl of oil
with no water over 10 days of tests through various choke sizes.
It currently is producing 400 b/d of oil, and test results indicate
that its production rate could be increased by installing a downhole pump. Before deciding on pump installation, the company
is conducting further analysis and reservoir modeling to evaluate
stimulation potential and assist in reservoir characterization.
The produced crude is being sold locally.
Following the recent completion of the Zapadno Chumpasskoye oil separation and testing facility, the next stage of field facility
construction, including the export pipeline tie-in, are being fasttracked to coincide with expected production increases.
Meanwhile, the deviated appraisal well P No. 3, which was spud
in May, is due to reach its target depth of 3,490 m (2,800 m TVD)
in a late Jurassic sandstone reservoir in about 10 days.
The well will then be logged, cased, and suspended prior to
skidding the rig to the next surface location for drilling the second
deviated appraisal well. A workover rig will be used to test P No.
3 in July. The company intends to complete the well as a future oil

producer. It is the first to be drilled in a program comprising three
appraisal wells and an initial 16 development wells.
The Zapadno Chumpasskoye field development plan includes
significant production growth with the drilling of more than 50
wells and the future installation of waterflood injection facilities,
Heritage said.

Petrobank starts third well pair at Whitesands
Petrobank Energy & Resources Ltd., Calgary, has begun air injection into its third well pair in the Whitesands pilot project in
the oil sands region of Alberta. The company is using its “Thai”
in situ combustion technology for recovery of the bitumen and
heavy oil.
The company also has initiated a debottlenecking and expansion project that involves drilling three additional well pairs later
this year.
Through the implementation of additional development phases,
Petrobank said it expects to achieve an ultimate production level of
100,000 b/d from its existing Whitesands leases.
Petrobank’s proprietary Thai technology is a new combustion
process that uses a vertical air injection well combined with a horizontal production well. The process allows a portion of the oil in
the reservoir to be burned, generating heat that reduces the oil’s
viscosity for easier flow through the production well. This method
recovers an estimated 80% of OOIP while partially upgrading the
crude oil in situ, Petrobank said.

Air injection in the first well pair began in late July 2006 and in
the second well pair in early January 2007.
Mechanical problems with the temporary steam generator used
in late December 2006 for the preignition heating cycle delayed air
injection in the third well pair for 6 weeks, but Petrobank said that
composition of produced gas indicates that combustion from the
third well pair has been initiated and early gross fluid production
capability is similar to that of the first two well pairs. Each well pair
is capable of producing up to 2,000 b/d of fluid. During the first
quarter, oil cuts in the wells rose to more than 50%.
Higher-than-anticipated sand production volumes required the
use of a very low choke setting on the wells, but Petrobank installed
a test sand knockout vessel on the first well pair that removed sand
from produced fluids.
Petrobank since has designed a larger vessel that will allow the
wells to be produced at their demonstrated capacity. The company
expects to begin installing these units for each well pair early in
the third quarter.
Meanwhile, the additional wells planned in the company’s expansion project are expected to be 200 m longer than the existing
500 m well pairs. They will incorporate Petrobank’s “Capri” technology, which allows a catalyst bed to be added around the outside
of the horizontal production well bore to enhance the upgrading
of the oil in situ.

Processing
Private Hyperion plans Midwest US reﬁnery
Hyperion Resources Inc., a privately held Dallas exploration
and production company, announced plans to build a 400,000
b/d refinery in Union County, SD, or elsewhere in the US Midwest, according to the South Dakota Governor’s Office of Economic Development (GOED).
The refinery, part of what the company calls the Gorilla energy
complex, would be the first such facility constructed in the US in
more than 30 years.
Hyperion Project Executive J.L. Frank confirmed that a tract of
land in Union County is one of the sites in the Midwest being
considered for the “green energy center.” Frank called the Union
County site “sufficiently attractive that we’ve taken several options
on land there, and we may take a few more.”
The energy center’s refinery would produce transportation fuels
including ultralow-sulfur gasoline and ultralow-sulfur diesel from
heavy oil from Canada.
If built in Union county, the refinery could receive crude from
TransCanada’s proposed 2,965-km Keystone oil pipeline, which
will deliver 435,000 b/d of oil from Hardisty, Alta., to Wood River
and Patoka, Ill. (OGJ, Feb. 19, 2007, p. 48).
TransCanada has oil pipelines between Patoka to the hub at
Cushing, Okla.
The Keystone system, now in approval stages, is scheduled for
construction by early 2008 and for operation in late 2009. The part
of the proposed system that would extend through South Dakota
would cross the Missouri River near Yankton, just 30 miles west of
Union County.

The company also plans to implement a modified downhole
completion to reduce sand production. It said it will incorporate
lessons learned from the current project into the design of the
three-well expansion, as well as the design of its first 10,000 b/d
project—its initial full-scale development beyond current operations.
Petrobank expects to file application for this project by yearend.

Eni calls force majeure in Nigeria after attacks
Italy’s Eni SPA said it declared force majeure June 17 at its Nigerian Ogobinbiri oil flow station after an attack by a group of
militants.
Peak production at the facility is 37,000 b/d of crude oil, with
Eni’s share standing at 5,500 b/d, a company spokesman said.
Unidentified gunmen occupied the oil flow station, holding
two dozen Nigerian workers and soldiers captive.
Eni, which did not know of any fatalities in the attack, said there
were 24 Nigerian workers and 51 soldiers in the flow station. It
said 8 workers and 40 soldiers were able to escape from the attackers.
The attack is the latest in a series stretching back some 18
months, with some 200 workers kidnapped during that time. The
attacks have been stepped up in 2007, with more than 100 workers
being kidnapped this year alone. ✦

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
Frank, former president of Marathon Ashland Petroleum, said,
“Gas prices are the highest in US history, and the US refining infrastructure hasn’t seen a significant change since 1976. The fact is,
refining capacity in this country has not kept pace with demand.”
The Gorilla project, reportedly to cost $6-8 billion, is being
touted in the Union County area for its strong economic advantages. The refinery’s construction would employ about 4,500 workers
over 4 years, Frank said, with a peak work force of about 10,000.
When operational, the refinery would employ about 1,800.
The refinery would have an integrated gasification combined
cycle plant, fed by petroleum coke from the refinery, to supply
electricity, hydrogen, and steam, Frank said. Emissions would be
substantially lower than those from conventional power generation plants.
A Hyperion executive involved with the Gorilla project was reported by the Sioux City Journal as saying the company hopes to
select a site during the next year. Hyperion has not disclosed information about financing.

EPA ﬁnes California reﬁner in wastewater case
The US Environmental Protection Agency has fined a California
refinery operator $1 million and has sentenced the company to 3
years of probation for breaking federal drinking water laws.
Santa Maria Refining Co. pleaded guilty on Apr. 12 and was sentenced in federal district court in California’s central district for
posing a risk to groundwater supplies by disposing of contaminated wastewater in wells that did not have permits for that use.

EPA said the wastewater contained benzene, which can cause
anemia, excessive bleeding, and cancer as well as affect the immune system.
Santa Maria Refining, which is a Greka Energy Corp. subsidiary operating in Santa Maria, also was sentenced for making false
statements to EPA and ordered to pay $15,000 in restitution and
implement an independently audited environmental program, EPA
said on June 15.
It said three individual defendants also pleaded guilty to making
false statements to EPA. They each face 5-year federal prison terms,
EPA said. Sentencing is pending.
EPA said it has been investigated allegations that Santa Maria Refining officials knowingly and routinely discharged refining waste
into underground wells that only hold permits for the disposal of
brine, which is separated from oil during the refining process.

It said it fined the facility $127,500 in June 2006 for unauthorized refinery wastewater disposal into the plant’s injection wells.

UK ﬁrm to build biodiesel plant in China
British biodiesel producer D1 Oils PLC plans to build a biodiesel
plant in China’s Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, the country’s
first such facilty using jatropha oil as a feedstock. Japan, India, and
the Philippines already have plans under way for such plants.
D1 Oils said the plant would be built in a petrochemical industry park in Baise City in northwestern Guangxi. Expected to be online at yearend 2008 or early 2009, the facility will have an initial
processing capacity of 10,000 tonnes/year, rising to 100,000 tpy
over 5 years.
The plant will be fed by seed oil from an existing 1,667 hectares of jatropha plantations in Baise, rising to 30,000 hectares by
2008. ✦

Tr a n s p o r t a t i o n
Japan, Brunei sign free trade, gas agreement
Brunei has signed a free trade agreement with Japan, which
had sought assurances of a stable supply of natural gas from the
Southeast Asian producer.
Japan imports about 10% of its gas from Brunei, which has
agreed to give Japan advance notice of any measures that would
restrict the gas exports.
The agreement also stipulates the establishment of a government-level subcommittee on energy, provides that the two countries will honor existing energy agreements, and gives consideration to environmental concerns. The accord within 3 years will
eliminate the 20% tariff imposed by Brunei on cars and almost all
auto parts from Japan, while Japan will immediately end tariffs on
agricultural and fishery products from Brunei.
In 2006, Japan imported some ¥252.5 billion worth of goods
from Brunei, almost all of it gas and crude oil, while some 70% of
Japan’s exports to Brunei are comprised of cars and auto parts.

Hungary seeks LNG from Indonesia
The Hungarian government, as part of a wider effort to diversify the country’s energy sources away from Russia, has approached
Indonesia seeking LNG supply purchases.
Hungarian Economcs and Transport Minister Janos Koka made
the request of Indonesia’s Trade Minister Mari Elka Pangestu, saying supplies from Indonesia could be shipped to an LNG terminal
under development by his country and Croatia.
Koka said the two sides would “touch on this further in October” during his visit to Indonesia. Meanwhile, Mari said she would
discuss the request with Jakarta’s ministries.
Hungary’s request follows earlier efforts to increase gas supplies
ahead of pending liberalization of Hungary’s gas market.
In May, Hungarian oil and gas company MOL Nyrt said it was
considering expanding capacity along the domestic stretch of the
“Friendship” gas pipeline that carries Russian gas to Europe via
Ukraine.
According to a report in the daily Nepszabadsag citing MOL
Nyrt sources, the expansion would increase capacity to 10 billion
10

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

cu m by increasing Russia’s gas supply until other supply routes
come on line by 2015.
The move is aimed at ensuring sufficient capacity available to
new market entrants following liberalization on the gas market in
2008, according to MOL Nyrt, which earlier announced plans to
enter the liberalized gas market in Hungary.
In May MOL Nyrt announced plans to team with ExxonMobil
Corp. to undertake a joint survey of “unconventional” gas resources in Hungary.

Indonesia reneges on some Sempra LNG supplies
Indonesia, reversing an earlier decision, is reallocating supplies
of Tangguh LNG originally earmarked for Sempra Energy LNG
Marketing Corp. in order to boost the amounts available to stateowned utility Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN).
PLN power generation director Ali Herman Ibrahim said the
decision was made during a June 14 meeting with the upstream
oil and gas executive agency BP Migas. Ali said BP Migas will allow
PLN to receive a portion of the LNG supply previously allocated
to Sempra, but he did not specify the amount. In March, to obtain higher prices for its LNG exported from Tangguh in Papua
New Guinea, Indonesia’s Energy and Mineral Resources Minister
Purnomo Yusgiantoro said the country wanted to renegotiate LNG
contract terms with South Korean buyers and was seeking to divert
to Japan supplies contracted for the US West Coast.
In particular, Purnomo said Indonesia was planning to talk to
Sempra, with which it had agreed to deliver 3.7 million tonnes/
year of LNG from Tangguh for 20 years at $5.90/Mcf. (OGJ Online, Mar. 6, 2007). The Tangguh LNG plant is expected to become
operational by fourth quarter 2008.
Recently Indonesian media quoted Purnomo as saying the government is considering the possibility of diverting as much as 50%
of Sempra’s LNG supply to the Asian market.
According to operator BP, the Tangguh LNG plant has already
secured long-term LNG sales to four customers: the Fujian LNG
project in China, SK Power Co. Ltd. in South Korea, Posco Korea,
and Sempra. ✦

Corrosion
InnerArmor coatings are
high-density, non-porous
and chemically inert. They
provide an exceptionally
strong barrier against
corrosion and erosion.

InnerArmor has a very low
coefficient of friction. And it
repels water. Liquids slide
through quickly and flow is
improved — reducing fouling
and using less energy.

A Perfect
Surface
InnerArmor has no grain
structure, no porosity. Like
glass, it goes on smoothly,
evenly and pinhole-free.
Making it impervious to
chemical attack.

Ultra
Hard
InnerArmor, with hardness of up to 3,000
Vickers, is many times
harder than steel. So
it extends product life
by standing up to
wear and abrasion.

Multi-Layer
Strength
Multiple layers give extra
strength. And combining
different layer materials
allows InnerArmor coatings
to be custom tailored to
achieve specific qualities.

industrial pipe.

they go on smoothly and evenly. And without
pinholes. The result: a virtually impenetrable
barrier against corrosion and erosion.
Customizable layered coatings
InnerArmor coatings can be created from many
different materials, from titanium nitride to
diamond-like carbon. And combining layers of
different materials can produce a spectrum of
coating characteristics for specific applications.

Virtually impenetrable — by design
InnerArmor coatings are amorphous. They have
no grain structure and no porosity. Like glass,

Solving problems, reducing costs
InnerArmor technology provides new solutions
to age-old problems in many industries — from
oil and gas to chemical processing.
Whether you’re fighting corrosion, erosion
or wear, in your pipelines or in your systems,
InnerArmor can help you
win the battles, increase
uptime and significantly
reduce your costs.

Issues cloud CO2 transport

Christopher E. Smith
Pipeline Editor
Research by several US Department
of Energy Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships has a goal of safe,
cost-effective, and long-term carbon
management, mitigation, and storage.
The RCSPs will be field-testing and
validating sequestration through 2009,
with deployment involving several
large-volume sites starting in 2008 and
running through 2017.
Current energy legislation also addresses carbon sequestration, including
plans to conduct a large-scale demonstration in the vicinity of the Piceance
basin.
These efforts have so far focused on
capture technology and the viability of
the various types of sequestration sites
(depleted oil and gas reservoirs, unminable coalbeds, and deep saline reservoirs), rather than how to transport
carbon dioxide from source to storage.
A Congressional Research Service
report published Apr. 19, “Carbon
Dioxide (CO2) Pipelines for Carbon
Sequestration: Emerging Policy Issues,”
points out economic and regulatory
problems that need to be addressed in
terms of CO2 transport before carbon
sequestration can occur.
The technology for transporting CO2
via pipeline is mature, having been used
since 1972 to carry CO2 from a variety
of naturally occurring and man-made
sources to oil fields for enhanced oil
recovery. CO2 pipelines are also similar
in construction and operation to natural
gas pipelines.
Technological questions regarding

CO2 pipelines, therefore, are minimal.
By contrast, the CRS report notes considerable uncertainty regarding the size,
complexity, and configuration of the
pipeline network required to implement a widespread carbon sequestration program in the US.

Costs uncertain
Many existing, large CO2 point
sources in the US are relatively close
to potential saline reservoir injection
points, making transport relatively
straightforward (OGJ, May 14, 2007, p.
20). But US Geological Survey Director
Mark Myers is among those who have
noted that the behavior of CO2 in saline
formations is not fully understood
(OGJ, Apr. 23, 2007, p. 37).
The resultant uncertainty over the
proximity of sources to storage sites
brings with it a wide range of possible pipeline configurations and costs,
according to CRS, which also notes the
economies of scale that would accrue
if a CO2 sequestration network were
developed in an integrated manner
rather than simply emerging piecemeal
as each source found its own way to a
sequestration site.
At a time when material and labor
resources in the pipeline industry are
stretched, issues of cost carry particular weight. Dedicated CO2 pipelines
would have to compete for resources
with already planned expansions of
the US gas and liquids transportation
infrastructure, as well as potential new
dedicated ethanol pipelines also under
consideration.

Regulatory issues
Regulatory difficulties also exist.
The US Surface Transportation Board
regulates interstate pipelines carrying
commodities other than water, oil, and
natural gas. Its regulatory authority and
oversight, however, are limited com-

pared with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s administration of US
natural gas and oil pipelines.
The STB is charged with ensuring
that CO2 pipelines fulfill common carrier obligations by charging reasonable
rates, but it lacks the authority to begin
a rate proceeding on its own initiative.
Pipeline operators under its supervision
are also under no obligation to notify
the board of any rate changes, unlike
operators under FERC jurisdiction. The
STB further lacks regulatory authority
regarding pipeline construction, including eminent domain.
Without federal regulatory authority
over construction, the CRS report points
out, CO2 pipeline siting is regulated to
varying degrees by each state. Without
the ability to oversee rates, a varied and
potentially unstable pricing environment would emerge. The potentially
dampening effect of these factors on
growth of an integrated pipeline network for CO2 sequestration is clear.
According to the CRS, however,
legislation placing CO2 pipelines under
FERC’s jurisdiction might imply that
CO2 transport is interstate commerce
and that captured CO2 is therefore a
commodity as opposed to a pollutant,
leading to still broader regulatory issues
and implications.
Carbon sequestration is one part of
the effort to improve the sustainability
and environmental responsibility of the
US energy infrastructure. To the degree
that other parts of this effort lead to
the development of nonfossil fuels, the
need for sequestration will be diminished.
Regardless of the twists and turns
this process takes, however, the transportation of CO2 should receive attention as urgent and careful as that now
given other subjects related to sequestration.

Biofuels and oil prices
The secretary general of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries irked observers in
the oil-consuming world this month with a comment taken as a reactionary threat over biofuels.
According to a June 5 report in the Financial
Times, the official, Abdalla Salem El-Badri, said
efforts in the West to develop biofuels might push
oil prices “through the roof.” His words zipped
across the internet and drew scorn on radio talk
shows in the US.
The popular interpretation is that OPEC will
restrict investments in oil-production capacity as
a political response to promotion by consumingnation governments of biofuels. As the Financial
Times reported the story, El-Badri “said the powerful cartel was considering cutting its investment in
new oil production in response to moves by the
developed world to use more biofuels.”

members. OPEC producers with undeveloped
reserves must invest heavily now to bring on
stream production capacity as it’s needed to meet
demand for oil years, even decades, in the future.
As always, a large risk in those multibillion-dollar
investments is failure of demand to reach forecast
levels and the consequent costs of servicing capital
tied up in unused capacity. That risk swells when
consuming-nation governments disparage oil
from the world’s largest exporters and aggressively
subsidize costlier alternatives.
A year ago, the OPEC secretariat examined
demand uncertainty in a paper presented at an
energy conference in Doha. To satisfy market
requirements for their oil under reference-case
assumptions about demand, the paper said, OPEC
members must invest $100 billion in production
capacity during 2005-10, at least another $100
billion through 2015, and nearly $150 billion

Companies affected by recent nationalizations in South America and
elsewhere may have a number of relief
options available. Among these are
political risk insurance (PRI), bilateral
investment treaties (BITs) and other
analogous bilateral and multilateral
treaties, and any investment agreement
between the company and the host
government. Each of these must be
analyzed to determine
which procedural and
substantive bodies
of law they implicate
and what obstacles or
recovery avenues they
present.
For some companies, recovering under a PRI policy and
assigning their direct claims against
the host government to their insurer
may be preferable to direct arbitration
against the host government. Other
companies may have purchased too
little or no political risk insurance or
may determine that direct arbitration
under BITs or analogous agreements
would be more advantageous in their
particular circumstance.
For some companies with PRI and an
applicable BIT, both avenues might be
available, and the company will need to
assess which options afford the greatest
potential for recovery.
Recently nationalized companies in
Latin America may recover some losses
this way.

been forced to sell their equity stakes to
the host government, arguably at well
below fair market value, and some have
had their operations seized outright.
These activities appear to be driven
by shifting political trends and the host
governments’ desires to obtain a greater
share of the revenue from their countries’ resources.
Events in Venezuela illustrate how the
combination of a resource-rich country and political volatility can rapidly
change the climate for foreign investors.
Venezuela has the world’s seventh
largest proved conventional oil reserves,
and its nonconventional oil deposits—the heavy crude oil found in the
Orinoco belts—are equal to the world’s
total reserves of conventional oil.
However, for many years Venezuela
did not have the investment capital to
exploit the potential financial benefits
from these resources. Consequently,
the country turned to foreign investors and entered into service contracts
with numerous foreign oil companies
to invest in and operate Venezuela’s oil
fields. In the 1990s, almost 60 foreign
companies, many from the US, participated in the Venezuelan oil sector at the
government’s invitation.
Under these service contracts, the
companies would operate the fields
and Venezuela’s government-owned
oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA
(PDVSA) would pay a fee and purchase
the oil at market-linked prices. With
the help of this foreign investment,
Venezuela soon became the fourth-leading supplier of crude oil and petroleum
products to the US.
Foreign investors also entered other
Venezuelan industries. In 1991, Venezuela privatized its largest telecommunications company, CANTV. Verizon Communications Inc. ultimately purchased
a 28.5% stake in CANTV. In 2000, US
power company AES Corp., Arlington,
Va., purchased an 82% stake in Grupo
La Electricidad de Caracas (EDC), the
largest Venezuelan utility.
However, Venezuela’s hospitality towards foreign investors did not endure.

Means of recovery
Companies can mitigate losses from
these types of actions by purchasing
PRI and establishing or working with
business entities in countries that have
investment treaties with the host countries before investing in infrastructure.

Political risk insurance
PRI provides one potential avenue of
recovery for companies whose foreign
investment has been expropriated by a
host government. PRI policies provide
coverage for losses resulting from unpredictable actions of the host government, including government confiscation or nationalization of the insured’s
investment. Other insured risks include
contract frustration, currency inconvertibility, political violence, and wrongful
calling of guarantees or nonhonoring of
guarantees.
PRI originated as a means of inducing direct private investment in developing foreign economies. Thus, the first
political risk policies were issued by
the US after World War II to encourage
private investment in Western Europe.
In 1969 Congress established the Oversees Private Investment Corp. (OPIC), a
wholly owned government corporation,
to provide direct financing and PRI for
projects in developing countries.
OPIC remains a dominant provider
of PRI. Other political risk insurers include the Multilateral Investment Guaranty Agency (MIGA), which is part of
the World Bank Group; Lloyd’s of London; Zurich Financial Services Group;
Sovereign Risk Insurance Ltd.; American
International Group Inc. (AIG); and
Chubb Corp. PRI policies typically have
large limits and long policy periods or
“tenors” of 5-20 years.
OPIC and MIGA offer maximum limits of $250 million and $200 million
respectively, while the limits offered by
private insurers range from AIG’s $85
million to Sovereign’s $125 million.

Additionally, political risk insurers often
form consortiums to increase the total
limits available to the policyholder.
If the insurer disputes coverage, PRI
policies generally contain arbitration
clauses. The publicly available OPIC
policy form requires arbitration in
Washington, DC, under the commercial
arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association.
Other PRI policies contain similar
provisions, although the location of
the arbitration and the applicable rules
vary. Because the OPIC policy form is
publicly available, and because of OPIC’s
dominant role among political risk
insurers, its expropriation coverage is
used here to illustrate the issues likely
to arise for companies affected by the
recent wave of nationalization.

Not surprisingly, in public statements, Venezuela has taken the position
that the terms it has offered to foreign
investors such as AES, Verizon, and
numerous oil companies have been fair.
However, such statements have often
been followed, virtually in the next
breath, with contradictory statements
suggesting that the companies have little choice but to accept whatever terms
the Venezuelan government offers. For
example, in discussing the nationalization of operations in the Orinoco belt,
President Chavez stated: “We want to
negotiate...but I have given instructions
that on May 1 when the sun gets up, we
will have all those oil fields under our
control.... The company that wants to
stay as our partner, we left the possibility open to them. The one that does not
want to stay as minority partner, return
the oil field and goodbye...good luck,
thank you very much.”
Indeed, recent history demonstrates

that the terms offered by Venezuela
have been nonnegotiable. As discussed
above, when Total and Eni refused to
convert their service contracts to joint
venture agreements that would give
PDVSA majority control, Venezuela
seized control of the oil fields that
they had been operating. At the time,
Energy Minister Rafael Ramirez stated:
“Those two companies resisted adjusting to our laws.... Companies that don’t
adjust to our laws, we don’t want them
to continue in the country.” Thus, the
choice for companies negotiating with
the Venezuelan government appears to
be either to take what is offered or risk
getting nothing.
Other facts, as mentioned, suggest
that companies such as AES and Verizon
did not receive just compensation.
Fewer details are known about how
much compensation, if any, Venezuela
has offered the oil companies in which
operations it has taken or will take a

majority stake. However, it is unlikely
that the amounts offered by Venezuela
will compensate the companies for the
substantial investments they have made.

Value of the loss
Assuming that a policyholder can
show that the expropriation was a
violation of international law, the next
issue becomes, “What is the value of
the loss?” i.e., how much is recoverable under the PRI policy? Unlike
“just compensation,” the value of the
loss is determined by reference to the
policy language. Under its form policy
language, OPIC agrees to pay the “book
value” of the insured investment, subject to certain adjustments and limitations. Book value is determined as of
the date “the expropriatory effect commences” and is based on financial statements maintained by the policyholder
in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.

Thus, that the policyholder already
has received some compensation from
the host government, such as has been
the case in Venezuela, does not mean
that it cannot also recover under its PRI
policy. Rather, the amount recoverable is

Caruso questions reﬁning capacity manipulation claims
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
The US government’s top energy
economist questioned allegations that
refiners intentionally reduced oilprocessing capacity this year to drive
product prices higher.
US Energy Information Administration Administrator Guy F. Caruso
told the Senate Small Business and
Entrepreneurship Committee June 14
that reduced product inventories that
extended into May apparently were
the result of unplanned refinery unit
shutdowns.
During a hearing on the impact of
higher gasoline prices on small businesses, Caruso explained that refiners
schedule maintenance turnarounds in
January and February to repair equipment and prepare for the summer driving season.
“The companies try to plan this to
maximize their individual sales opportunities. No individual company would
take down a refinery to reduce sales.
Their objectives are to maximize sales.
What went wrong was that there were a
number of unplanned outages,” Caruso
said. “While we’re not an investigative
agency, we haven’t seen any attempt to
manipulate the marketplace.”
Citing EIA’s latest short-term energy
outlook released on June 12, he said
US regular gasoline prices are expected
to average $3.05/gal nationwide this
summer because of strong demand and
low inventories. Crude oil prices, which
EIA expects to average over $65/bbl for
West Texas Intermediate through the
summer, are expected to keep the average nationwide regular gasoline price
above $3/gal through the summer,
Caruso said.
“Recently, total gasoline imports
have returned to normal levels. We
believe these normal levels or possibly
somewhat higher-than-normal levels
will need to continue to avoid further

upward pressure on prices,” he told the
committee. “With the hurricane season
beginning, continued tight refining
conditions and low gasoline inventories, and increased demand for summer
travel, upward pressure on gasoline
prices does remain a concern.”

Business impacts
“Whatever the cause, the volatile and
increasing cost of gasoline is wreaking
havoc on small businesses,” said another
witness, Sal Lupoli, president and chief
executive of Sal’s Pizza in Lawrence,
Mass. “Rising fuel costs have a direct
impact on my means of delivery for my
business, and on my employees who
often can’t afford gasoline for their cars
so they can come to work. We encourage car-pooling and public transportation, but these options are not always
available.”
Janet Myhre, government services
group director at Chuckals Inc., said
the office supplies company in Tacoma,
Wash., is feeling the impact of higher
crude oil prices beyond its delivery
fleet. Prices have risen for reporter
binders because vinyl used on their
covers is made from petroleum, she explained. “We’re at a level where we have
to decide whether to scale back our operations. Maybe we’ll lay off some local
employees and start to use an outside
delivery service,” she said.
Other witnesses described impacts of
higher gasoline prices on larger operations. Frederick W. Smith, chairman,
president, and chief executive of FedEx
Corp. in Memphis, said the overnight

delivery service decided it would use
EIA’s reported oil price to help determine its rates, which it posts on the
Internet, instead of being in the oil
futures market.
“As oil prices go up, we add surcharges. At times during this recent
run-up, our prices have gone as much
as 20% higher for our air express business, and slightly less for our ground
business. Over the last 3 years, we have
steadily increased the base crude oil
price,” he said.
Smith also cochairs the Energy
Security Leadership Council, which
has urged Congress to require the US
transportation fleet to use fuel more
efficiently, make alternative fuel sources
more readily available, and increase
access to unrecovered domestic oil and
gas resources for responsible production.
Timothy P. Lynch, senior vice-president of American Trucking Associations
Inc., said the organization’s members
are concerned about rising diesel fuel
prices. ATA and its members do not oppose new engine designs and requirements to use ultralow-sulfur diesel, but
they want Congress to understand that
environmental improvements sometimes reduce fuel efficiency, he told the
committee.
“Many of the problems anticipated
[with ULSD] have not materialized. We
support [biodiesel’s] use but believe
that national standards are needed, with
preemption of state mandates, so it
will be a uniformly high-quality fuel,”
Lynch said. ✦

“Our goal as an economy should
be to get ourselves off oil...and to
move to ethanol production, which
is the most efficient and cost-competitive,” said US Sen. Judd Gregg
(R-NH).
Gregg was speaking of his plans
to offer an amendment to an energy

US tariff on imported ethanol, and
he clearly had an eye on his home
constituency, saying that the current
import duty amounts to an “arbitrary

And guess what? Largely behind
the global price surge are US energy

as an alternative to gasoline. In fact,
expectations of increasing demand
for biofuels have caused corn prices

API officials said June 20.
The new recommended practice
came in response to the US Chemical
Safety and Hazard Investigation Board’s
urgent recommendation on Oct. 25,
2005, that API develop industry guidance for portable structures at processing facilities. CSB made the recommendation during its investigation of the
March 23, 2005, explosion and fire at
BP America Inc.’s Texas City, Tex., refinery that killed 15 people and injured
180 other workers.
RP 753 would ban light-wood trailers from a defined zone near process
areas, prohibit nonessential personnel
from being housed in any portable
building (including blast-resistant
structures) in or near process areas, and
provide a simplified method for users
with limited resources to safely place
portable buildings, according to API.
The recommended practice also
would provide controls over changes to
people, location, and building designs,
and require analysis of all occupied
portable buildings near process areas,
API said.
“We’re trying to give people tools
for looking at their individual circumstances,” API Pres. Red Cavaney told
reporters during a June 20 teleconference. “How and when each company
implements this recommended practice
is an individual decision. But I know
many companies already have taken
steps of their own,” he said.

Rigorous approach
It took several months to develop
the recommended practice after API determined that one was needed because
the association follows the American
National Standards Institute’s formal,

Cavaney said. “Speed shouldn’t trump
full and thorough consideration of
these issues,” he said.

begin to review RP 752 once it formally
issues RP 753. It also will formally brief
CSB, the US Occupational Safety and
Health Administration, and the United
Steelworkers on RP 753’s features on
June 21.
Those features include the establishment of three zones for placing
portable buildings, based on external
cloud explosions and using technical
data from CSB and other organizations.

Minimum distances, based on the size
of the unit (or congested volume), are
recommended, starting with 330 ft for
the smallest unit.
Light-wood trailers cannot be located
closer than 330 ft from a process unit.
For larger units, the minimum distance
is 570 ft.
For plants that do not have the technical resources to perform a detailed
consequence analysis or quantitative
risk analyses, RP 753 sets a minimum
range of 300-1,930 ft for portable

structures. “A company still needs to
conduct a detailed analysis to determine
where to place these portable structures.
If it is unable to, they should be farther
out,” API senior attorney Erik Milito
said.
The document also provides guidance for placing personnel, Milito said.
“The main thrust is to keep employees, contract workers, and temporary
structures far from areas where their
presence is not essential.” ✦

NJ senators lead effort to keep acreage in OCS ban
New Jersey’s two US senators led an
effort to defeat an amendment proposed by Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.)
on June 14 that would have removed
Outer Continental Shelf acreage off
Virginia from a congressional oil and
gas leasing ban.
During debate on the Senate majority’s energy bill, Democrat Sens. Frank
R. Lautenberg and Robert Menendez
said they oppose oil and gas activity off
Virginia’s coast because it would be too
close to New Jersey’s shoreline resort
areas.
“The scheme we defeated would
not only pose short-term threats, but it
could have led us down a slippery slope
that ends in drilling up and down the
East Coast,” Menendez said following
the defeat of Warner’s amendment by
44 to 43 votes.
The amendment would have allowed
each governor of the nine Atlantic Coast
states from Maine to Florida to petition
the US Interior secretary to begin gas
leasing at least 50 miles beyond that
state’s coast. Other states’ officials in the
region would then have had the opportunity to respond.
Half of the revenues would have
been deposited in the US Department of
the Treasury. Of the remaining half, 75%
would have gone to the state submitting

Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman
(D-NM) said drilling is not taking
place off Virginia’s coast not only because of the moratorium that Congress
passes each year, but also because of a
presidential withdrawal that remains
in force.
Lautenberg said oil spills from
production off Virginia’s coast would
still be possible despite leases being
restricted to gas because oil almost

always is discovered with gas. “So not
only can natural gas have environmental problems, but drilling for natural
gas can easily result in puncturing oil
deposits and causing major spills,” he
said.
Governors from New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, and Maine have
written letters to Congress urging it to
not allow drilling off the East Coast,
according to Lautenberg. “The energy

he said.

US Senate rejects LNG siting change, passes OPEC measure
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
The US Senate rejected a proposal
to give governors a final word in siting
onshore LNG terminals but approved
a measure authorizing the Department
of Justice to prosecute members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries for violating US antitrust
laws.
The proposals were offered June
19 as amendments to the Democratic
leadership’s energy legislative package that came to the floor earlier this
month. Of the two, the LNG terminal
siting amendment proposed by Sen.
Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.) was more
significant because it was the first effort
to modify procedures established in
the 2005 Energy Policy Act (EPACT). It
failed by 53 to 37 votes.
The second amendment, so-called
NOPEC (No Oil-Producing and Exporting Cartels), which passed by 73 to
20 votes, was similar to one the Senate
passed in 2006 that did not survive in
conference with the US House. Sen.
Herb Kohl (D-Wis.), who sponsored
the 2007 version, requested a roll call
vote that he hoped would increase its
stature. The House passed a similar bill
by 345 to 72 votes on May 22, Cardin
said.

that giving a state’s governor authority
to veto any aspect of the LNG terminal

as the US begins to compete more
aggressively for overseas gas supplies.

Senate Finance Committee proposes several new oil taxes
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
The US Senate Finance Committee
proposed new taxes for the oil industry
as offsets to incentives for alternative
fuels and renewable energy research
and development. The full Senate received the package in the early evening
of June 19 as it continued debate on the
Democratic leadership’s energy legislation package.
The committee said its proposals
included repealing the manufacturing
deduction for major oil companies’
domestic products, but leaving it intact
for smaller independent producers. Petrochemicals, medicine, insecticides, and
alcohols would be excluded. This would
raise an estimated $9.433 billion over
10 years, the committee said.
It also proposed the following:
Eliminating the distinction between
foreign oil and gas extraction income
and foreign oil and gas related income
(transportation and refining) by combining the two categories and applying
the existing extraction income limitation to raise an estimated $3.187 billion
over 10 years.
Extending the oil spill liability tax
through Dec. 31, 2017; raising it to
10¢/bbl from 5¢/bbl; and repealing
the requirement to suspend the tax
when the unobligated balance exceeds
$2.7 billion, which the committee
said would raise $2.76 billion over 10
years.

Schnacke agreed that “the national
environmental movement” is targeting
the Roan Plateau. He said East Coast
environmentalists frequently target the
western US, including Colorado.
“The state of Colorado is going to
be the loser [if drilling is blocked]. It’s
not like we’re talking about a national
monument,” Schnacke said of the Roan
Plateau. Wells already exist on private
lands on the plateau outside BLM-administered lands atop Roan Plateau.
COGA estimates that the lease bonus
payment alone could generate up to $1
billion the year the Roan is leased. In
addition, the state could receive an estimated $166 million/year in royalties
and production taxes.
BLM’s decision authorizes a highly
restrictive approach to development on
top of the plateau. Development is to
be conducted in a staged approach. The
plan calls for no ground disturbance of
52% of the area and access restrictions
on an additional 42%.
The plan also outlines clustered
development and directional drilling
from common well pads to reduce land
disturbance. It calls for a density of four
well pads/sq mile.
There is to be phased drilling in only
one of six designated areas at any given
time. No drilling would be allowed in
sensitive valley bottoms. Trout habitat
and scenic waterfalls are off limits to
drilling activity.
Schnacke said the plan involves a
development plan that would take decades, and he questions how attractive
it will prove to be for gas producers.
“It’s going to be a real challenge for
some companies to be able to justify
bidding on the projects,” Schnacke said,
adding that many producers will not
want the “hassle” involved with the federally-administered Roan Plateau.
“There is development there now,
but it’s in areas not called the Roan
Plateau. It’s going to take decades to
get the gas out of the Roan Plateau. It’s
ironic that an environmentally restrictive plan would force the industry to
be up there longer than necessary,”
Schnacke said. ✦

This last of four parts on the structured belt of the Western Canada Sedimentary basin describes in more detail
the six structural domains and their
exploration potential.

Liard/Mackenzie Fold Belt
The Liard/Mackenzie Gravity Slide
Fold Belt is a regional Laramide gravity
slide (Fig. 14).
It is
characterized by a
series of
100+ miles
long and
narrow
anticlines
and broad synclines, locally disrupted
by strike-slip faulting. The slide butts
against a NE-trending vertical basement
strike-slip fault in NE BC and several
vertical basement N-S strike-slip faults
farther to the N in the Northwest Territories.
The present setting reflects the freezing of the main gravity slide, which
while sliding contained several large
anticlines and synclines that moved
within the slide in the direction of its
movement, much like ripples in a pond.
The Beaver River, Kotaneelee, Pointed
Mountain, Fort Liard, and P-66 anticlines contained 0.8 tcf of recoverable
gas, some at 450°+ F. reservoir temperatures. Recently, liquids-rich gas was
discovered in a fractured reservoir in an
anticlinal core thrust structure in the N
part of this fold belt.
In the northern portion of the region
and extending N into the Yukon Territory and NWT, strike-slip in N-S direction
over a width of some 100 miles produced E-W shortening and a regional
N-trending structural depression in the
filled-in Liard/Mackenzie basin.
A salt and shale layer, wet due to
osmotic attraction of water, is present in
the lower part of the basin’s sedimentary section. It rests on Cambrian and
Precambrian sedimentary strata. It is the
sliding surface for the overlying sedimentary section that slid E from the W
flanks of the depression into its deeper

N-trending central portion.
Surface geology demonstrates these
anticlines are complex and change
along their axes into faulted homoclines
and both high-angle and low-angle
thrust-cored anticlines with rollovers
above their core thrusts, changing to
rollovers beneath the thrusts. Anticlinal
core thrusts in this domain are small,
both in dip and strike directions, when
compared with the massive thrusts in
the Thrust Domain farther S.
Frequently, core-thrusts experienced
substantial subhorizontal slip. The S
portion of the slide was disturbed by a
large deep-seated basement strike-slip
fault, which even today brings up very
hot fluids. It dragged the E-moving
gravity slide and bent the N-S anticlinal
axes in a SW-NE direction and created
four-way closed culminations, many of
which contain economic gas accumulations in fractured Devonian Nahanni
dolomite reservoirs, with numerous
crystal-lined vugs, resulting from fractures and dissolution.
Higher topographic elevations in the
W, E dip of strata, and associated strong
E regional fresh ground water flow considerably have diminished the exploration potential of the Liard/Mackenzie
Gravity Slide Fold Belt. Drilling should
only be considered for structures with
1,500+ ft of vertical reservoir closure.
Lesser closure means exploitation will
soon have to deal with increasing production of formation water.
There might be an opportunity in
exploring deeper targets: closures on
extension fault blocks, strike-slip fault
closures, and flower folds below the
decollement in presalt strata. Surface
structural geology and well data suggest
the possible presence of many (50+)
large anticlinal structures in Cambrian and Precambrian clastics of the
“basement.” It might be assumed the
Precambrian section generates gas judging by the presence of giant gas fields
in Precambrian strata in the NWT and
Siberia.

In the Turner Valley field area, the

sedimentary intervals (ST 10), containing vertical faults, between which strata
were squeezed (thinned), and positive

the vertical Bovie, Liard, Ferrier (ST 8),
Okotoks, Pine River, and many other
strike-slip faults ranging in length from
several miles to over 100 miles.
The strike-slip domain experienced
little movement in its easternmost
region (ST 1, 6-9, and 14), where it
is anchored to the massive Canadian
Shield. S to N movements progressively
increased going from E to W through
the domain. Farther W, SE-to-NW
movements increased.
The combined subhorizontal S-to-N
and SE-to-NW slips along these faults
are estimated to be in the tenths of
miles in the basement. W-to-E shortening due to shear of the domain might
be calculated in miles. It is important to
note that the effect of strike-slip movement in the basement on the overlying
sedimentary cover is determined by the
thickness of that cover and the type of
sediments included in that cover.
The Strike-Slip Domain comes in
from beneath the Liard/Mackenzie

extends some 1,000 miles to the US
border in the S. It cuts SE across the

runs parallel to the Imbricate Domain.

From there, it cuts into the Foothills

extends into the US. Strike-slip faults

evident 30 km NW of Calgary. From
there, the strike-slip strike changes to S
and just W of the city was instrumental
in determining ramping and degrees of
rollover in shingled thrusts that contain
Sarcee gas field (100 bcf). Continuing
S, it “dives” beneath giant Turner Valley
field and onward to the US border.
Turner Valley field resulted from a
combination of N-S and SE-NW dextral
strike-slip movements and simultaneous E-directed compression. The latter
created a thrust-end fold, up against a
dextral strike-slip fault block, that subsequently broke through and ramped
up to create the Turner Valley thrust and
four-way closed rollover (ST 3).
In the S and W parts of the disturbed
belt, the E-thrusted thick overlying
sedimentary cover prevented strike-slip
faults from penetrating upward from
the basement into and through that
sedimentary section. Instead, many vertical shear zones are present, and these
are observable on seismic sections and
in the field. These shear zones do not
contain an actual strike-slip fault but
instead are zones in which shear was
intense.
Such shear zones are present, although most often not recognized, in
many NW-SE trending thrusts and enhance reservoir characteristics through
intense shear microfaulting (fracturing). Not recognizing the existence of
these shear zones, including strike-slip
faults, puts in doubt the validity of
many structural contour maps of thrust
sheets.
In some instances, reservoirs have
1% original porosity and no permeability. Strike-slip shearing zones
created substantial fracture numbers
and permeability and some wells have
produced over 290 bcf from such reservoirs (Waterton field).
The N-S Okotoks field is a closure
against a large strike-slip fault. Its main
reservoir is in dolomites of the Devonian Wabamun formation, which,
undeformed, contains many irregular
globules of anhydrite and little porosity
and permeability. The high E side of the
fault contains a narrow, elongated fault

closure in which dolomite is heavily
shear-fractured, contains crystal-lined
dissolution vugs (leached fractured anhydrite globules), numerous fractures,
and a permeability of up to 7 darcies.
Farther E, the undeformed formation
has little porosity and no fractures.
The most interesting aspect of the
western strip of the Strike-Slip Domain
is that dextral movement along many
of the faults was simultaneous with E
thrusting of the sedimentary section,
starting in the Thrust Domain and continuing into the Triangle Zone Domain.
The combined E-W and N-S movements resulted in many rather complex
structures in the sedimentary section.
All these structures, even negative/synclinal flower structures, are exploration
targets.
Numerous strike-slip faults were cut
off from their basement roots, during
continued eastward thrusting, but when
thrusting slowed, continued movement
along the strike-slip faults in the basement penetrated upward and formed
new strike-slip faults, flower structures,
and strike-slip shear envelopes in the
overlying sedimentary section.
In the Deep Basin, a common structure was formed when an E-moving
thrust (sometimes a subhorizontal shear
plane) with rollover encountered an
active dextral N-S or NW-SE strike-slip
fault. The collision sheared the E limb of
the rollover against the vertical strikeslip fault and a vertical E limb (box
fold) resulted.
Most expressions of strike-slip faulting and folding are in the subsurface;
however, in some areas, imbricates associated with strike-slip faulting are present but are mapped as parallel thrusts.
Their strike-slip provenance was not
recognized. Few structural geologists
have field-mapped strike-slip structures,
including “fractures,” in the subject
region.
The most common fractures and
fracture patterns investigated in the
field are associated with thrusting in
the Thrust, Triangle Zone, and Imbricate domains. Therefore, analyses and
interpretations of shear “fractures” in

cores or deduced from seismic interpretations should be handled with great
care pending the strike-slip experience
of the interpreter. Structures associated
with strike-slip faulting were recognized some 35 years ago by the author
in the WCSB.
A decade ago, the author fieldmapped the classical N-trending Toumarolin strike-slip fault where it shears
through the W flank of the Murzuk
basin in southwestern Libya. This fault
is well exposed for many miles in a
desert terrain nearly void of vegetation.
It cuts through a flat-lying sedimentary
package resting on a gently E-dipping
crystalline basement.
E-W seismic transects show the fault
to evolve into a classical flower structure, where the sedimentary package
reaches a thickness of 3-4 km. The
two strike-slip faults that bound that
flower fold do not reach the surface.
Fault plane, fault zone, bed dips, micro
to macro shear faults, and associated
en-echelon complementary fault and
associated fold structures, including
“imbricates” with structural closures
at low angles to the fault plane, were
mapped in the field and are reference
material for the current structural assessment.
In the Plains Domain, several similar
large classical strike-slip structures are
seismically documented well beyond
the eastern boundary of the Strike-Slip
Domain proper. In some areas, vertical
shear movements resulted not in the
formation in faults but gentle folds and
imbricates (ST 1-7).
Exploration in this domain will
focus on recognition of the strike-slip
structures, amplitude anomalies associated with geothermal dolomitization in
limestone, and both carbonate and siliciclastic reservoirs in flower structures.
The Deep Basin portion of this
domain is a prolific exploration region.
Additional targets, both stratigraphic
and structural might be found in deeper
Cambrian and Precambrian clastics
truncated by an angular unconformity
and underlying the younger WCSB section.

Imbricate Domain
The Imbricate Domain includes most
of the shallower sedimentary section
that overlies the Triangle Zone Domain
(Figs. 6 and 7 and many STs).
While moving east, the Triangle
Zone “rock plough” underthrusted
the Imbricate Domain, lifted it, and
in places turned beds to vertical at
the bounding thrust. This domain is
bounded by a large thrust (ST 1). It is
cut from below by the leading edge
thrust of the Triangle Zone. It is the last
one in a series of many that developed
in parallel fashion, stepping forward,
and that were sequentially cut off by
the underthrust when the rock plough
moved E. Remnants of earlier leading
edge thrusts are shown on ST 1.
The rock body of the Imbricate
Domain includes many smaller thrusts/
imbricates that trend parallel with the
first bounding thrust and dip easterly. These imbricates have W-directed
rollovers, a direction opposite that of
the major thrusts in the Thrust Domain.
The combination of thrusts, imbricates,
the series of cutoff leading edge thrusts
demonstrate the dynamic underthrusting nature of the rock plough (Triangle Zone Domain) and the Imbricate
Domain.
Exploration in this domain will
concentrate on more precisely defining
the structural framework of this domain
and the role of structure in combination with the more than 30 regional
Plains exploration plays advancing into
the zone from the E. Furthermore, the
Late Jurassic/Cretaceous and younger
resource plays require immediate attention. Large bodies of rock butt against
the underthrust probably are severely
fractured and might contain exploitable
natural gas.

Plains Domain
This domain includes the “undisturbed” gently-dipping sedimentary
Precambrian to Tertiary section of the
WCSB that rests on igneous and metamorphic rocks of the Canadian Shield
(Figs. 6 and 7 and ST 1-14).
This section extends from outcrops

of the shield in the east and “dives”
beneath the first main thrusts of the
Foothills in the W. Historically it supported intense and successful exploration. Current drilling activity demonstrates exploration of the Plains Domain
continues unabated.
Numerous play types are augmented
by many unconformities, providing a
wide array of traps for hydrocarbons.
The unconformities correspond with a
series of worldwide mountain-building episodes and continental drifting
events, of which the most striking is
the one that occurred at the end of the
Cretaceous epoch some 60 million
years ago.
More than 30 regional oil and gas
exploration plays extend W from the
undisturbed Plains Domain. The first
addition of structure to a portion of
these regional exploration plays is in
the Strike-Slip Domain. This resulted in
discovery of 8+ tcf of gas in place to
date.
Numerous plays await the drill bit
and will sharply increase the overall
undiscovered gas volumes. Faults in this
domain had a great impact on the formation of gentle structures (traps) and
acted as conduits for high-pressured hot
fluids to facilitate reservoir enhancement through dolomitization.
Future exploration will have to increasingly concentrate on the relationship between structure and stratigraphy.
Successful exploration of the 30+ strati-

graphic plays in the structured belt will
be taxing for the oil and gas industry
as it requires an understanding of the
complex combinations of structure and
such plays.

These technologies include optimally

“From a technology perspective,
Pinedale has been our arena to test and
develop new technologies to increase

said John Bickley, team leader, Shell EP
Americas Tight Gas Task Force.
“Having a working relationship
with the asset allows us to easily apply
technologies we develop in the lab to
real-world conditions in the field. We
have pushed the application of existing technologies and tried new ones.
By integrating the results of all these
efforts, we have met our objectives
to reduce costs, add production, and
increase our scope for recovery at Pinedale in an environmentally responsible
way.”
Shell expects these lessons from
Pinedale will apply to other, unconventional gas reservoirs.

shut down all drilling and completion
activities for the northern two thirds of
the anticline from November through
May (Fig. 2).

Unraveling Pinedale
To determine the best development
strategy for Pinedale, Shell undertook
a major data-acquisition effort, performed special core analysis, and used
experimental logging tools to predict
gas volumes in place and understand
well productivity. The Pinedale asset
drilling team tested various drilling
techniques, including use of skid rigs,
underbalanced drilling techniques,
slim-hole casing, and a variety of drill
bits.
Shell says these modifications have
reduced drilling cycle time and costs.
The time to drill an average well decreased to 35 days in 2006 from 65
days in 2002, with 25 days being the
best performance to date.
On the geophysical side, Shell’s team
experimented with reprocessing of seismic data and studied natural fractures
and outcrops to understand the stress
history of the anticline. It also drilled
a horizontal well to characterize the
natural fracture network.
Shell said the well demonstrated that
natural fractures occur throughout the
anticline, but in general, it does not
believe that natural fractures represent a
critical component of reservoir productivity.

monitor well, and indicates pressure
communication and decline trends in
reservoirs in communication with offset
producing well.
Shell uses these measurements to assess well drainage areas and to optimize
well pattern and spacing between development wells.
Most fluvial tight gas fields in the
area begin with a 40-acre subsurface
well spacing and subsequently, companies downspace the fields to 20, 10, or
even 5-acre spacing. Greater well spacing reduces development costs because
fewer wells are required but may not
adequately deplete the field.
Shell notes that optimal well spacing
eliminates the risks of drilling through
depleted zones, avoids in-fill well placement problems, preserves the desired
well pattern and interwell spacing, and
maximizes capital efficiency of total
completion costs.
The permeability of the sands at
Pinedale is in the 5-10 μdarcy range,
making it difficult and time consuming
to acquire reliable pressure data. Shell
says only after installing the long-term
monitoring systems that it realized that
after drilling, a well required 20-300
days to return to the original pressure.
The CaTS system also provided Shell
with the first pressure profile as a function of depth in Pinedale. In addition to
installing gauges in dedicated monitor wells, Shell worked with the Expro
Group to develop both wireless and
wired instrumentation systems external
to the casing to enable pressure monitoring of the entire vertical reservoir
interval, without compromising the
integrity of the casing.
Shell says these technologies allow it
to monitor reservoir pressures for a desired period of time and then complete
the well for production with selective
hydraulic fracture stimulations following the data-acquisition period.
A well in Pinedale may have 20-70
individual sands in a 7,000-14,000-ft
interval, and Shell says pressure data are
the only data that enable calibration of
static and dynamic reservoir models.
Pressure gradients in the anticline range

from 0.43 psi/ft (normal hydrostatic)
at the top of the producing section to
0.8 psi/ft at TD.
Shell installed a world record of 44
individual external pressure-temperature modules in two wells over a 12-day
period during the summer of 2006,
bringing the total number of pressure
gauges installed in monitor wells to
115 across the field during the past 2
years.
Shell says pressure tests show how
the sands produce, how many wells are
needed, and how to space them. Well
spacing affects profitability and depends
on where the wells are located on the
anticline.
Data from pressure data provide the
basis for understanding well performance and recovery efficiencies at
Pinedale. Using the pressure information, Shell develops and calibrates 3D
static and dynamic models to determine
reservoir sand connectivity and drainage of individual wells to design further
field development. These data show how

pressure declines over time and when
matched against complex reservoir
models provide values for porosity, connectivity, and permeability.
Shell also employs fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing technology
to measure temperature profiles across
the massive, commingled production
interval. The temperature change shows
the movement of the gas within the
wellbore. As gas enters the wellbore,
it expands and cools, whereas water
or condensate expands and becomes
warmer. These temperature changes allow one to calculate gas flow rate from
various intervals.
By continuously monitoring temperatures in the wellbore over the full
reservoir life cycle, Shell can further
develop and calibrate 3D models for the
field. Operators currently are developing the field on 20 and 10-acre spacing,
with 5-acre spacing being evaluated in
certain areas.
Shell’s asset team and task force also
are working on production data analysis

for commingled production from the
wellbore by running multiple production logs over time. From these data,
the teams can evaluate and discriminate
reservoir permeabilities and fracture
characteristics, as well as to develop
models for characterizing the drainage
area.
Shell says these data enable better
calibration of the static and dynamic
models and provide information on
how much gas a well will deliver in a
30-year life and the amount of reserves
that can be booked.

Further development
Shell expects to drill thousands of
wells to develop this field. Many of
Shell’s wells are drilled deviated from a
single well pad to minimize the drilling
and production operation footprint, although some wellsites have only single
wells (Fig. 4).
By yearend 2006, Shell had participated in drilling more than 260 wells
and says its optimization exercise provided a huge savings while capturing
economic incremental reserve volumes.
For 2007 and 2008, Shell says its
task force is working with selected
technology innovations to lead the
development of new artificial-lift pump
technology to unload liquids from the
wellbore and improve outflow performance to ensure maximum recovery
from the field.
Shell says application of various
technologies at Pinedale has had the
following results:
• Its total gross production reached
300 MMscfd by yearend 2005, and the
latest yearly figure available, with 2006
and 2007 expected to show increases.
• Completions that once took more
than 6 months now typically take 7-10
days.
• Its drilling time averages 39 days/
well, considerably less than the nearest
competitor.
• Its recoverable natural gas resources in Pinedale field have increased
markedly. ✦

weight restrictions. The preferred approach at the time was to take the coil
offshore in two or three pieces and
weld them together on the platform.
This was expensive and time consuming.
Welding specialists were required to
set up the operation. In most jurisdictions, a special work permit was
required, and a discrete area on the rig
used. In many instances, the wells had
to be shut in for the duration of the
welding job. Then the welds had to be
x-rayed by yet another set of specialists
with more equipment. As the tubing
was used, the discrepancies between
wall thicknesses and ovality became
more significant and the welding process became harder to control.2
Finally, CT rigs used on floating
platforms were subject to vertical and
lateral movement. To compensate for
these movements, they relied on heave
compensators attached to the platform
rig. However, the platform rig had to sit

area. Late in 2006, coil over top drive
(COTD) rigs with 200,000-lb hook
loads, which were capable of drilling
to 10,000 ft with coiled tubing or to
14,000 ft with jointed pipe, were introduced (OGJ, Sept. 18, 2006, p. 48).
The biggest obstacle for the project
was the coiled tubing itself. At the inception of CT drilling, tubing in 23⁄8-in.
and 27⁄8-in. sizes sufficed. In drilling
larger holes, however, the smaller tubing sizes experienced friction loss that
resulted in high pressures and slower
drilling rates as the bit went deeper.
Engineers found that if 31⁄2-in. CT was
used to drill deeper 83⁄4-in, 77⁄8-in. or
61⁄2-in. holes, the friction loss and wear
on the CT and surface equipment could
be reduced.
Thus, pump pressures ranging from
1,500-2,000 psi could be achieved
compared to the 2,000-3,000 psi

Tenaris produced the first strings for
the project at its Houston facility and
became the only US mill that could, and
still does, produce CT strings in this
size.
To date, Tenaris has produced 12
strings of the new coiled tubing for
Xtreme to use on the project and it
anticipates that demand for 10,000ft well strings will increase as more
experience is gained drilling the deeper
wells. “Xtreme’s innovation in using CT
drilling for deep gas wells could very
well result in an overall increase in the
amount of CT drilling in the US,” said
Reichert.

advancements may lead to the use of

Refiners faced with increasing
hydrogen demand should consider
producing additional hydrogen from
fuel-gas streams.
The use of refinery fuel gas, excess
LPG, butanes, and pentanes for hydrogen production is a logical fit for
refineries. Refinery fuel-gas flow and
composition variations can be frequent
and sudden. Our experience is that this

This article discusses the difficulties
in designing and operating hydrogen
plants using multiple feeds.

Hydrogen demand
Refiners are experiencing increasing pressure to produce cleaner fuels
while processing more sour and heavier
crudes. The need to meet clean-fuel
specifications requires additional investment in hydrotreating capacity. The use
of residue-upgrading technologies,
such as hydrocracking and coking, also
increases hydrogen demand.
These technologies also create additional volumes of refinery fuel gas that
must be used within the plant. Some
refineries already have a very tight fuel
balance, occasionally limiting crude
processing.
The use of refinery fuel gas to make
hydrogen is a logical solution. In the
past, refinery fuel gas came from one
or two sources such as a hydrotreater
purge or catalytic reformer gas; today
it comes from many sources, which
increases hydrogen plant complexity
and operation.

250° F., a maximum allowable limit of
5% olefins in feed would be acceptable.
A recycle loop equipped with a cooler
allows the process to handle more olefins in the feed.
The designer must pay special attention to acetylene, if present, in the
fuel gas. Acetylene polymerizes on the
hydrotreating catalyst. The maximum
concentration should be 10 ppm (vol).

Feed measurement, analysis
The steam-to-carbon ratio is a critical parameter that the refinery must
control for efficient and safe operation of a steam-methane reformer. The
varying fuel-gas composition makes it
difficult to obtain an accurate real-time
measurement of the flow rate and carbon number of the stream.
A mass flowmeter or a vortex-type
meter can accurately measure fuel-gas
flow rate. Because the stream is usually
at 600-1,000° F., the flowmeter may
have temperature limitations.
Real-time measurement of the
carbon number is more difficult. A gas
chromatograph can continuously monitor the composition of the fuel-gas
feed. Gas chromatographs operate with
about a 10-min delay, however, and
cannot be used for process control.
A mass spectrometer with a fast
response time may be suitable. Its initial
cost and reliability, however, may make
it impractical. An inexpensive and
reliable density meter can be used as a
measure for the carbon number.
To maximize use of refinery fuel gas,
a refiner may use it as makeup fuel in
the tubular reformer. Fuel gas used as
fuel is usually a different stream from
the fuel-gas stream fed to a steammethane reformer.
Temperature control of the reformer
furnace is sensitive to variations in the
quality of the makeup fuel. It is important to know the real-time flow rate,
heating value, and gas density of the
fuel gas to control a furnace properly. A
quick-response calorimeter can make a
heating-value measurement. The calorific value with a density measurement
can be used for firing controls as well as

conversion, then varying the reformer
outlet temperature and the shift inlet
temperature can compensate for the
effect of feed changes on the chemical
equilibriums in the reformer and shift
converter. Table 1 shows these effects.
These variations affect the overall
process thermal efficiency (Fig. 3).
Inherently, thermal efficiency falls as the
feedstock becomes heavier, as reflected
in a lower hydrogen-to-carbon ratio.

March 3 – 5, 2008 / Moody Gardens Hotel & Convention Center, Galveston, Texas

SUBSEA TIEBACK
Forum & Exhibition

PennWell invites you back to the 8th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition.
SSTB has become the premier event for one of the fastest growing field
development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March 3 – 5, 2008 in
Galveston, TX at the Moody Gardens Hotel & Conference Center. Over 2,000
people and 150 exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference.You can’t
afford to miss it.
As our industry confronts new challenges, it has never been more important
to submerse yourself in them. This year’s theme is “Subsea is here, the game
is changing.” As our game changes, the sharing of knowledge and collective
experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety,
and economics of the subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by
industry leaders. As in the past, only by participating in this conference will you
be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will not be published and no
Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room
stays inside the conference room. We hope you will join us.

The opening of the 1,663-mile
Rockies Express Pipeline system, running from natural gas producing basins
in Colorado and Wyoming to market in
the Midwest and Northeast, will provide
many US gas consumers with new
access to cheaper gas from the Rocky
Mountain region. This development
will cause a major reshuffling of US gas
transportation patterns by allowing consumers to shift their
supply portfolios
away from traditional
supply areas in the
Midcontinent and
Gulf Coast to more
economic production in the Rockies.
This first of two articles examines the
background of the REX pipeline project
and analyzes the effect on US natural
gas markets of REX Phases I and II.
The concluding article will detail the
market reorganization expected to be
brought about by the combination of
REX Phase III’s completion and downstream capacity constraints.
Once the entire REX project is
complete, its tariff rate structure will
provide significant competitive advantage to REX shippers delivering to either
Lebanon or Clarington, Ohio, compared
to shippers bringing gas from supply
areas in East Texas, South Texas, Louisiana, or the Gulf of Mexico.
This analysis only compares the
variable components of each pipeline’s
tariff: commodity charge plus fuel loss.
The much larger demand component is

considered sunk, and must be paid regardless of whether the shipper actually
moves any gas. From a market perspective, therefore, decisions about which
transportation alternatives influence
shipper behavior and market pricing
hinge solely on the variable cost.
Assuming price differentials between
market locations in the Rockies (Opal
and Cheyenne) and the Gulf Coast are
similar to 2006 averages, REX shippers
will have a $0.90-1.17 advantage over
shippers on Texas Eastern Transmission and Tennessee Gas Pipeline. REX
shippers also will have a significant
price advantage over shippers bringing supplies north on Columbia Gas
Transmission, Texas Gas Transmission,
and Panhandle Eastern.
Capacity constraints at Lebanon will
restrict the ability of REX East shippers
to unload 1.8 bcfd of incremental gasonce the pipeline has been completed.
East of Clarington, constraints also will
shape the ability of existing pipelines to
absorb 1.8 bcfd of incremental volumes.
On peak days, therefore, constraints
will exist on all of the takeaway pipelines, preventing absorbtion of incremental supplies. At other times, available capacity will exist to carry REX gas
to the regions’ numerous large storage
facilities, but during withdrawal periods
constraints east of the storage facilities
will prevent incremental volumes from
reaching customers.
Accordingly, volumes delivered into
the takeaway pipelines at either Lebanon

or Clarington will, for the most part,
need to be offset by reduced receipts
from traditional supply sources.
REX volumes may also displace
Anadarko and Permian basin volumes
during 2008, prior to commencement of service for REX Phase III. The
REX price advantage, coupled with the
capacity constraints at Lebanon and east
of Clarington, suggests that significant
volumes of Texas, Louisiana, and Gulf
supplies will be displaced by REX supplies, increasing gas-on-gas competition
in the gulf area. These gulf supplies will
be forced to compete for other markets,
presumably in the Southeast and in the
Texas-Louisiana intrastate market.
Continuing this domino effect, some
of the turned-back volumes will flow
into the southeast legs of ANR, NGPL
and to Trunkline. When REX volumes
begin moving to eastern markets,
however, Anadarko and Permian basin
supplies should find their way back into
their traditional Midwestern markets.
Gulf supplies will also come under
pressure from production increases in
the East Texas, Fort Worth, Arkoma, and
Arkla basins. Increases in Northeast
power generation demand could absorb
some incremental supplies given new
pipeline capacity east of Clarington to
deliver REX supplies to the new markets. Lower Canadian imports also could
make room for additional REX supplies.
Each of these developments will reshape regional supply-demand balances
as the REX displacements roll through
the market.
The REX gas flow displacements and
other supply-demand developments
will result in a radical realignment of
regional price differentials. The Rockiesto-gulf area price realignment will be
the most dramatic: Rockies prices will
rise to near parity with the gulf and
under some scenarios could even rise
above the gulf. The differential between
Ohio price points such as Lebanon
(Columbia and Dominion Transmission-South) and Gulf Coast prices will
fall sharply. Once REX East is open to
Clarington, Chicago-Ohio price differentials will flatten.

Recontracting on existing pipelines
will also fuel realignment. Between
2007 and 2010, a number of contracts
for firm capacity will come up for
renewal. As local distribution companies hold most of the capacity on these
pipelines, the next 3 years may see
considerable realignment of their supply portfolios.

Phase II of REX will provide access to

they can receive from REX, unless they
reduce traditional supplies from the
Anadarko or Permian basins.
ANR’s bottleneck constrains the
entire mainline system from the
Greensburg compressor in southwestern Kansas to points near Chicago. On
Northern Natural Gas, the bottleneck
is between the field zone and market
zone as defined in NNG’s tariff. NGPL’s
bottleneck lies where the pipeline

only pipeline with significant unused
capacity. NNG’s utilization averaged
78% of capacity during the year, including 71% during the summer months
and 88% during the winter months.
Bottlenecks on these pipelines to
move additional supplies into Midwest
markets must either constrain volumes
moving into these pipelines from REX
or back out supplies moving into these
markets from their traditional sources
of supply in the Permian and Anadarko
basins.
The most cost effective supplies will
win this gas-on-gas competition and
REX has a significant technological
advantage over its competitors, allowing
it to operate with a maximum allowable operating pressure up to 1,480
psig, compared to 700-900 psig for
ANR, NGPL, Northern Natural Gas,
and Panhandle Eastern (as measured at
their bottleneck points). This advantage
translates to lower charges for fuel and
“lost and unaccounted for” gas in the
REX tariff. Accordingly, the proposed
tariff for REX is very competitive as
compared to rival pipelines.
The competitive relationship between
REX and these four pipelines should
lead quickly to significant shifts once
REX begins to flow east of Cheyenne
Hub. Permian volumes will be the first
to realign. Assuming that the existing
price relationships between Cheyenne,
62

TETCO

the Anadarko, and Permian persist, the
opening of REX Phase II will push significantly greater Permian volumes back
to either the Texas intrastate market or to
markets in California and Arizona.
Rockies supply also will realign, with
REX cannibalizing volumes from Cheyenne Plains. Shippers on either NNG
or PEPL that use Cheyenne Plains to
transport Rockies supply to the Anadarko will gain a significant advantage by
shifting their supplies to REX. Accordingly, REX will pull significant volumes
from Cheyenne Plains.
Finally, competition from REX will
cause Anadarko volumes to be pushed
back into the Oklahoma and Texas
intrastate markets. Assuming the current
price differentials between Cheyenne
and Anadarko, shippers on Northern
Natural Gas, Panhandle Eastern and
ANR all would be able to purchase
gas at Cheyenne and move it to their
respective pipelines at a lower cost than
procuring supplies and transportation from the Anadarko. At first quarter
2007 price differentials, REX’s costs are
$0.07-0.18/MMbtu cheaper, a significant margin.
How much market share REX
ultimately captures will depend on
the magnitude of incremental Rockies
production in 2007-08. Expansion by
Rockies producers at current rates could
force significant volumes of Anadarko

gas to find markets elsewhere.
The unrealistic assumption that
current pricing relationships remain
unchanged underpins these supply
realignment expectations. Clearly they
will not. Employing this assumption,
however, reveals the market pressures
that will be created by REX II.
The realignment of pipeline flows
brought about by the economic advantages of REX Phase II will lead to
significant shifts in historical pricing
relationships. In the Rockies, the introduction of new transportation capacity,
and thus new demand pressure, will
raise prices relative to other regions of
the market. In the Permian and Anadarko, new competition from Rockies gas
will constrain access to markets in the
Midwest, decreasing prices relative to
other regions.

For example, in 2006 Anadarko prices
were typically 11-13 cents higher than
prices at Cheyenne Hub. REX will drive
Anadarko prices toward parity with
Cheyenne Hub and Opal. Permian prices
also will fall relative to Cheyenne Hub.
This first wave of flow realignment
and shifts in price differentials will be

will enable Rockies’ gas to flow to Chicago, Michigan, and other upper Midwest markets. Since Ohio and northeastern markets have typically carried
higher prices than Chicago markets,
this analysis assumes that, if economically feasible, Rockies’ gas will move
past the Midwest markets to markets in
Ohio and the Northeast, yielding higher
netbacks to Rockies’ producers.
The concluding article in this series

New hydrohammer expands company ﬂeet

New fracture modeling software

Addition of the the S-280 expands this
firm’s fleet of hydrohammers.
The tool’s ability to drive bigger piles
and achieve deeper penetration enables the
company to drive larger caissons required
for many construction projects being carried out in the Gulf of Mexico.
The hydrohammer also may be used
to drive well conductors. The tool has a
maximum energy rate of 206,400 lb/blow
and can deliver 45 blows/min.
The firm says it has already used the
new hammer to install a monopod and
a tripod platform. These projects were
completed from derrick barges working in
the Ship Shoal and Grand Isle areas of the
Gulf of Mexico. Other planned installations
include deep conductors and structure
installations from derrick barges and lift
boats.

FracPerm 2.0 is newly released fracture
modeling software, .
The integrated, easy to use fracture
modeling package enables geologists and
reservoir engineers to create detailed permeability maps used in the flow simulation and history matching of reservoirs to
reduce uncertainty.
Operating with the firm’s modeling
software, IRAP RMS, FracPerm 2.0 combines data, geological properties, geostatistics, and geohistory in a data-driven
approach, designed to make maximum
use of available data and allow rapid and
interactive quality control of the model
as it is being built. Specific additions in
FracPerm 2.0 include a redesigned, easy
to use interface, simplified work flow, and
a new plug-in structure, which allows the
reservoir engineer to better integrate and
customize with other software tools.
FracPerm operates on either the
geological or simulation model, thereby
accessing the reservoir structure and facies

distributions. The software’s mix of structural geology, data integration, and visual
assessment tools are specifically designed
to allow the asset team, with their knowledge of the reservoir, to build models for
validation by structural experts and by
simulation testing.
FracPerm is suited to experienced fracture modeling users as well as nonspecialists, the firm says.
A new model visualizer, a clearer view
of well data, simpler ways of attaching
fractures to sets, and a new fracture model
visualizer with color coding are included.
Users also have the ability to change projects during a modeling session as well as
full undo-redo functionality.
The firm notes that FracPerm 2.0 allows E&P companies to capture the true
heterogeneity within fractured reservoirs,
allowing better quantification of uncertainty and risk management.

Comprehensive
bills stumble on
complex issues
The political storm swamping US immigration reform helps explain troubles with
energy policy.
The common element is a congressional
preference for “comprehensive legislation.”
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT),
which Congress was revisiting even before
Democrats won control in 2006, was comprehensive legislation. It covered everything that every favor-seeking lobbyist for

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

every energy form around could imagine.
The bill, however comprehensive,
was incomprehensible while in Congress,
incomprehensible when passed, and barely
comprehensible as law. Hailed as a triumph
of bipartisan compromise, EPACT now
prepares for surgery as House and Senate
Democrats remove parts they pretend
never to have liked. Most are measures that
might have boosted production of oil and
gas. The same errant strategy seems to be
guiding immigration reform.
It’s a difﬁcult problem, with those 12
million illegal residents making a mockery
of US law, using public services they don’t
pay for, some maybe plotting terrorist
attacks, and—things are never simple—doing jobs that few legal citizens want. So a
Republican administration and Democratic
legislature wrestled into being a reform
package that, like EPACT on energy, tried to
do everything at once on immigration.
Surprise! The compromises and dealmaking that went into creation of the bill
were nearly impossible to follow. Surprise!
Hardly anyone liked the ﬁnal product.
Whatever happened to simple problem-solving? Everyone agrees that border
control needs work. Why can’t Congress
deal with that problem by itself?
Issues like treatment of the existing
crowd of illegal residents, guest-worker
programs, and admission preferences are
trickier. Why not address them separately?
Solutions would be better. Just as important, the compromises and deal-making
would be easier to see. It’s no mystery why
politicians favor comprehensive legislation
over targeted solutions to speciﬁc problems. Big bills make big news.
When they go wrong, however, big bills
make big problems. Legislation that tries
to do everything at once can be hard to
get right. EPACT got too much wrong on
energy: mainly too much market regulation
and too little economic supply.
As with immigration, EPACT’s difﬁculties started with law-making that tried to
manage multiple issues needing focused
attention in one historic package.

OPEC reduces demand forecast
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries expects demand for its crude
to average 30.6 million b/d in 2007, a slight decline of 200,000 b/d from the previous
year.
On a quarterly basis, demand for OPEC crude is estimated at 31.11 million b/d in
the ﬁrst quarter and respectively at 29.5 million b/d, 30.6 million b/d, and 31 million
b/d in successive quarters. In 2006, demand for OPEC crude averaged 30.8 million
b/d. The cartel expects non-OPEC supply to reach 50.6 million b/d in 2007, an increase
of 1.1 million b/d over the previous year and a downward revision of 57,000 b/d from
the last assessment.
In 2006, non-OPEC supply averaged 49.5 million b/d, representing an increase of
500,000 b/d over 2005. Total OPEC crude production averaged 30.03 million b/d in
May, down 82,700 b/d from the previous month.
However, Olivier Jakob, managing director of Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland, said, “Reading the numbers rather than the headlines shows that all OPEC
members (apart from Nigeria due to strife) have slightly increased production in
May vs. April, with the losses of Nigeria offsetting those gains. OPEC will not commit
now to a supply increase as it needs to see ﬁrst how new developments in Nigeria impact production. If it was not for Nigeria, OPEC would have shown a supply
increase in May.”
OPEC said its basket of 11 reference crudes averaged $64.36/bbl in May, 97¢
higher than in April. Large commercial stocks of crude in the US were offset by a
series of reﬁnery glitches primarily in the US during a period of concern over rising
demand with the onset of the summer driving season. Raids on oil ﬁeld facilities and
kidnapping of workers in Nigeria kept the market nervous about oil supply.
The OPEC basket price remained volatile in June as Cyclone Gonu threatened
petroleum facilities and shipping in the Middle East. Prices rose under pressure from
geopolitical tensions to over $67/bbl before dropping to just above $65/bbl. OPEC’s
basket price had increased to $66.74/bbl by June 14.
In its June report, OPEC forecast growth in 2007 world oil demand at 1.3 million
b/d or 1.5%, broadly unchanged from its previous forecast. So far this year, US demand grew 2.3% or 470,000 b/d, boosted by strong gasoline consumption. Construction and petrochemical activity across the Middle East fueled strong oil demand
growth in that region, while a robust economy raised oil demand in India by 7.1% or
189,000 b/d in April. That same month, China’s demand rose by a stunning 9.8% or
700,000 b/d from a year ago to 7.9 million b/d.
China’s apparent oil demand in the second quarter is expected to grow by
500,000 b/d to average 7.8 million b/d. For 2006, the world oil demand estimate was
revised up by 150,000 b/d from our last month’s estimate due to historical revisions
in the developing countries, OPEC said.
IEA, EIA numbers
Earlier, the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) raised its estimates of
global demand for oil products by 250,000 b/d to 84.5 million b/d for 2006 and by
420,000 b/d to 86.1 million b/d for 2007. It also said in its monthly report that world
supplies of crude in May fell by 565,000 b/d to 84.9 million b/d. IEA’s estimate of nonOPEC production again was trimmed by 110,000 b/d to 50.2 million b/d, resulting in
an overall increase of 900,000 b/d (OGJ Online, June 12, 2007).
“The IEA report and tone has become too predictable and as credible as OPEC,”
Jakob said. “For OPEC the supply situation is always under control and for the IEA
we are always facing an acute shortage. The truth is somewhere in the middle, and
in the end the market reacts more to the politically neutral weekly statistics from the
US Department of Energy. The weekly DOE statistics will need to provide some support, otherwise the weekly charts will take a turn for the worse.”
In its latest available report, DOE’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) said
US gasoline stocks were unchanged at 201.5 million bbl in the week ended June 8,
instead of the 1.5-2 million bbl increase that many had expected. Reﬁnery utilization
dipped to 89.2% from 89.6% in the week ended June 8 vs. a consensus expectation
for a 0.7% increase.
Gasoline production increased slightly, nonetheless; but gasoline imports declined by 350,000 b/d (23%) in the same period. US crude inventories inched higher
by only 100,000 bbl to 342.4 million bbl that week. Distillate fuel inventories increased by 300,000 bbl to 122.6 million bbl (OGJ Online, June 13, 2007).

Engineering Your Competitive Edge

We found a way to keep oil rigs drilling 10 times longer.
Will anyone else? Don’t hold your breath.

What problem can we solve for you? One drilling operation was tired of bringing up nothing but worn
bearings. So they asked us to extend the life of these critical components. Today they average 300 hours of
uninterrupted operation, up from just 30. Our metallurgical engineers can find similarly innovative solutions
to the problems you’re facing, then deploy and support them globally. Find out more at kennametal.com.

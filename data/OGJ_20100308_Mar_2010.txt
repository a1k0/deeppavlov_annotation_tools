Anadarko hikes spending to $5.6 billion for 2010
Anadarko Petroleum Corp. on Mar. 2 said it plans capital expenditures of $5.3-5.6 billion this year compared with $4.6 billion in 2009.
Jim Hackett, Anadarko chairman and chief executive officer,
said the company ended 2009 with record production, nine deepwater discoveries, and “significant” cost reductions.
Based on expected growth from natural gas shale plays and
major oil projects, Hackett forecasts Anadarko could surpass 3 billion boe of proved reserves by yearend 2014 compared with 2.3
billion boe as of yearend 2009.
Hackett said $1.1 billion is allocated toward 2010 exploration
programs, with much of it focused on worldwide deepwater exploration.
Anadarko plans to drill as many as 13 exploration and appraisal
wells off West Africa, 7-10 wells in the Gulf of Mexico, 4-6 wells
each in Brazil and Mozambique, and 3-5 wells in Southeast Asia.
“We are targeting approximately 400 million boe of net discovered resources in 2010, a 12% increase over our record 2009
results,” Hackett said. “At the same time, we are actively appraising several of our recent discoveries—Wahoo in Brazil, Tweneboa
in Ghana, and Lucius, Vito, and Heidelberg in the Gulf of Mexico.”

Firms realign Permian, Midcontinent segments
Occidental Petroleum Corp. and Apache Corp. separately re-

aligned Permian basin and Midcontinent business units as of 2010.
Oxy combined most of its central US gas production into a
single business unit called Midcontinent Gas. The business unit
includes Kansas Hugoton field, the Piceance basin, and the bulk
of its Permian basin nonassociated gas assets, which had been reported as part of the Permian business unit through 2009.
The change will alter Oxy’s production to 75% gas and 25%
liquids for the Midcontinent unit and 89% liquids and 11%, mostly
associated gas, for the Permian unit. Oxy made the change to take
advantage of common development methods and production optimization opportunities.
Beginning in 2010, Oxy also will begin expensing 100% of
the carbon dioxide injected in the Permian basin, whereas in it
capitalized about 50% of it or $69 million in 2009. The change
simplifies the process of determining the portion that should be
capitalized versus expensed as larger portions of the injected gas
support current production.
Apache, meanwhile, created a new regional Permian basin
business unit based in Midland, Tex. Apache’s Permian area has
been part of the Central Region in Tulsa since 2002, but the combined capital program has increased tenfold since then.
Apache plans to operate five rigs to drill 171 net Permian basin
development wells in 2010, up from 87 wells in 2009. Apache acquired $187.4 million in Permian basin properties from Marathon
Oil Corp. in April 2009. Those properties have 200 quality infill
oil locations, Apache said. ✦

Development

Mandy is Mississippi Canyon oil discovery
A group led by LLOG Exploration Co. LLC, Covington, La.,
private explorer, said the Mandy exploration well on Mississippi
Canyon Block 199 is a conventional amplitude oil discovery in the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
The well went to 7,500 ft true vertical depth in 2,465 ft of
water and encountered net oil pay more than 120 true vertical feet
thick in a high-quality reservoir. Pressure and samples confirmed
the discovery, LLOG said. A follow-up well found a high-quality
oil-filled reservoir in a separate fault block with net oil pay more
than 100 true vertical feet thick.
Mandy is 45 miles southeast of Venice, La., and just north of
Matterhorn oil field.
Scott Gutterman, LLOG’s president and chief executive officer,
said, “LLOG’s deepwater Gulf of Mexico program is very well situated for growth with the recent first production of our Mississippi
Canyon 72 field and development projects at Green Canyon 141
and Green Canyon 448 slated for start-up later this year.
“With the discovery at Mandy and continued drilling at Mis-

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

sissippi Canyon 503 and 547, which has recently begun, LLOG is
positioning itself for significant production and reserve adds going into the future.”
Working interests in the prospect are LLOG 50%, Mariner Energy Inc. 35%, and Apache Corp. 15%. The block was acquired in
OCS Lease Sale 206 in March 2008.

Talisman lets Auk North, Burghley contracts
Talisman Energy UK Ltd. has let two lump-sum engineering,
procurement, and installation contracts to Technip for development of two oil fields in the UK North Sea.
One of the fields is Auk North, which Talisman is developing
with three horizontal wells completed subsea with electric submersible pumps and tied back to the Fulmar A Platform about 10.5
km away. Auk North is on Block 30/16.
Technip will fabricate and install the production pipeline and
install an umbilical, power cable, and subsea equipment.
Talisman estimates Auk North reserves at 13 million boe
proved and 17 million boe proved and probable.

It expects production to start in 2011 and to peak at 10,000
boe/d. The Auk North subsea manifold will be able to accommodate as many as six horizontal producers.
Talisman also plans to redevelop nearby Auk South oil field by
drilling nine wells and recompleting three wells, adding reserves of
23 million boe proved, 29 million boe proved and probable. South
Auk production is to begin in 2012, peaking at 11 million boe/d.
The other Technip contract is for fabrication and installation of
production and gas-lift pipelines and installation of an umbilical
and subsea structures at Burghley oil field on Block 16/22.
Talisman is developing Burghley with at least two development
wells completed subsea and tied back to the Balmoral floating production vessel operated by Premier Oil on Block 16/21 about 8.5
km away.
It estimates Burghley reserves at 2 million boe proved and 3
million boe proved and probable. Burghley production is to begin
late this year. According to government filings, it will peak at as
much as 15,000 b/d of oil and 2.9 MMscfd of gas.
Talisman bought Auk field from Shell UK Ltd. and Esso Exploration & Production Ltd. at the same time it bought the companies’
combined 85.81% interest in Fulmar field under an agreement announced in 2006 (OGJ, Nov. 20, 2006, p. 36).

Apache presses Argentina Gas Plus projects
Apache Corp.’s Argentina unit plans to operate 28 rigs in core
areas in 2010 to drill 249 net wells (299 gross), up from 213 net
wells (248 gross) in 2009.
Of the 299 gross wells, 223 are development wells and 76 are
exploration wells. Ten of the exploration wells are on prospects in
Pre-Cuyo, Cuyo, and Springhill reservoirs in the Neuquen, Cuyo,
and Austral basins.
The Houston-based independent drilled 32 development wells
in 2009 with 97% success. Its production was a net 45,500 boe/d,
down 5% from 2008 due to reduced capital spending and lower
fourth quarter seasonal takes.
Apache has received government approval for four Gas Plus
projects that allow gas sales at higher prices, and the company is
progressing three more Gas Plus contracts for approval (OGJ Online, Nov. 17, 2009).
Apache said projects under Gas Plus will lead to sales prices of
$4.10/MMbtu on 10 MMcfd and $5/MMbtu on 50 MMcfd in 2011.
The Gas Plus programs so far involve three rigs to drill 21 wells
in 2010. ✦

This separate segment of the Pyrenees project will have its own
wells and gathering system. It will be produced through the Pyrenees FPSO under a commercial unitization agreement between the
two groups and is expected to come on stream towards yearend.

Santos Group’s Henry gas field comes on stream
The Santos Group’s Henry natural gas field development in the
Otway basin off western Victoria has come on stream.
Gas is being produced from the Henry-2 and nearby Netherby-1
wells, which are connected by subsea pipeline to the group’s existing Casino gas system that transports gas to an onshore processing plant near Port Campbell.
The fields were originally slated to start production in mid2009, but were delayed by the late arrival of the pipelay vessel to
install the connecting lines.
The two fields will add about 120 TJ/day of gas to the region’s
production.
Santos holds 50% interest in the development, while Australian
Worldwide Exploration and Mitsui E&P Australia hold 25% interest each.

Nido awards contracts on Tindalo oil field
Nido Petroleum Ltd., Perth, awarded two major equipment
contracts for development of Tindalo oil field in the Palawan basin off the Philippines.

Processing
One Chilean refinery due back on line
Chile’s state-owned oil company Empresa Nacional del Petroleo (Enap) said its 97,650-b/d Aconcagua refinery will be on line
soon but no date could be given for the restart of its 113,000-b/d
Bio Bio facility.
Both refineries stopped operating due to damage and electrical
problems following an 8.8-magnitude earthquake that rocked the
central southern part of Chile on Feb. 27.
The initial quake was followed by a 6.2-magnitude aftershock
that struck central Chile, according to the US Geological Survey,
which located the epicenter 35 km underground and 109 km
northeast of the city of Talca.
Meanwhile, despite earlier assurances about availability of domestic stocks, Enap said it will import 65,000 cu m of diesel to
secure the local fuel supply.
That follows an earlier statement by Enap that it had enough
gasoline for at least 2 weeks and enough diesel for 10 days, a
stance underscored by Energy minister Marcelo Tokman who said
there was no cause for concern.
“In terms of oil and gas, the stock is there,” Tokman said. “The

awarded the contract for supply of the M/T Tove Knutsen floating storage and offtake vessel (FSO), while Weatherford Asia Pacific Pte Ltd. was awarded the contract for production processing
equipment.
The FSO, a double-hulled tanker with capacity to store more
than 600,000 bbl of oil, will be initially supplied for 6 months
with an option to extend this period for up to 3 years.
The vessel will be positioned near the Tindalo production facility and use its dynamic positioning system to remain on location.
Oil from Tindalo will be sent via floating flowline to the FSO
from the production processing unit on the Aquamarine Driller
jack up rig.
The Tove Knutsen will be mobilized to the field in April after
undergoing some minor refitting in Singapore.
The Weatherford production processing equipment for Tindalo
is a modular system being assembled in Batam, Indonesia. It will
be used during the initial well-testing program and then remain
in place for full field operations.
It is to be installed on the deck of Aquamarine Driller, also expected on station in April, and will process up to 20,000 b/d of oil,
including the removal of gas and water from the production flow.
First oil from Tindalo is scheduled for the second quarter with
initial plateau rates of 7,000-15,000 b/d. Recoverable oil reserves
at the field are estimated to be 1.5 million bbl.
Nido has a 50% interest in the SC54A license while Kairiki Energy Ltd. has 35% and Trafigura Ventures III BV 15%. ✦

situation is fine. The problem is distribution and coordination.
But in terms of the amount of fuel, we do not see any problem.”
However, company officials also left open the option of importing further supplies if needed.
The Aconcagua refinery is the main source of products for the
Santiago market, while the Bio Bio facility supplies 40% of products used by the domestic market including fuel oil, LPG, gasoline
and diesel oil.

Fire hits Navajo Refinery asphalt tank
Fire at an asphalt tank under construction at Holly Corp.’s
100,000 b/d Navajo Refinery in Artesia, NM, killed at least one
contract worker and left another worker missing and feared dead,
Holly said.
The company said Mar. 3 that two other workers were seriously injured.
It said refinery firefighters extinguished the blaze in about 90
min. Refinery operations were not disrupted.
At the same refinery on Jan. 17, fire broke out in the crude unit,
injuring no one and causing little damage (OGJ, Jan. 25, 2010,

Al Gore and the IPCC
Nobel Propagandist Al Gore has reemerged to
dogmatize again about global warming, responding this time to the collapse of scientific arguments for abandoning fossil energy. The former
US vice-president wants everyone to quit worrying about the obvious surrender by science to
politics at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change, the United Nations creation lately forced
to recant claims about melting glaciers, rising
sea levels, and irreversible warming. In a Feb. 28
column in the New York Times, Gore sees little of
importance in the mistakes.
“The reality of the danger we are courting has
not been changed by the discovery of at least two
mistakes in the thousands of pages of careful scientific work over the last 22 years by the [IPCC],”
he writes. After glossing over the two errors and
attributing politically motivated manipulations
by data handlers in the UK to “an onslaught of
hostile, make-work demands by climate skeptics,”
Gore proclaims “that the overwhelming consensus on global warming remains unchanged.”

A tired point
His argument progresses little beyond that
tired point. The rest of his long column is a harangue against imported oil, people who disagree
with him, “media organizations” he dislikes, free
markets, the Senate’s failure to pass cap-and-trade
legislation, and “political paralysis,” national and
global.
Name-calling riddles the screed. In addition
to villainous “skeptics,” Gore berates “market
fundamentalists,” “polluters refusing to act,” and
“showmen masquerading as political thinkers
who package hatred and divisiveness as entertainment.” Redeploying an overworked and altogether
silly analogy, the former vice-president likens
businesses that resist regulation of carbon emissions—which he calls “unrestrained pollution
of the atmospheric commons”—to the tobacco
industry. And, as always, he disparages dissenters
without acknowledging their arguments. Failure
to submit to the Gore evangel, for example, condemns his contemporaries to being remembered
by their grandchildren as “a criminal generation
that had selfishly and blithely ignored clear warnings that their fate was in our hands.”
These are the blind swings of a political pugi18

list caught against the intellectual ropes with his
arguments bruised and bloody. Gore’s attempt to
scoff away the IPCC’s lapses is pathetic. The errors were not trivial. IPCC’s 2007 warning about
melting Himalayan glaciers made headlines and
intensified the alarm fueling pressure to implement costly remedies. Its overstatement of sealevel rise in the Netherlands had the same effect.
Indeed, other errors not brushed aside by Gore
have emerged, such as IPCC’s exaggerated claims
about vanishing rainforests.
The pattern is clear: IPCC errs on the side of
climate alarm. Leaked e-mail messages from the
University of East Anglia foreclose all possibility
that the errors just happened to fall on one side of
the political issue. The messages showed scientists
responsible for crucial climate data maneuvering
to prevent publication of views contrary to their
own, scheming in other ways against opponents,
and withholding or misplacing data. The thoroughly politicized mayhem in full electronic view
defines the consensus to which Gore alludes. In a
growing number of ways, parties to it have been
caught tricking away their credibility.
Gore does his own standing no good with
his whiny, unconvincing attempt to reduce these
events to insignificance. Now, more than ever, he
looks like a prophet of hollow prophesy. “What is
at stake is our ability to use the rule of law as an
instrument of human redemption,” he preaches
in his Times column. That’s too heavy a load of
moral certitude for a lame mule like the IPCC to
carry.

Grand outcomes
If Gore truly worried about grand outcomes
levered by minor precedents he’d object to the
Environmental Protection Agency’s plan to regulated emissions of greenhouse gases under the
Clean Air Act. Thanks to a Supreme Court ruling
on legal standing and definitions, a federal agency
is moving to assume control over much economic
decision-making in the US. The ruling didn’t address climate science; it merely settled a question
about statutory intent. It nevertheless provided for
an historic expansion of government.
Because EPA’s move increases pressure on Congress to cap carbon emissions, Gore won’t fight it.
His real concern is politics, not science. ✦

For some oil and natural gas producers, fourth-quarter 2009 earnings
improved from a bleak quarter a year
earlier, but feeble demand for products
hurt refining and marketing results.
Annual results for 2009 reveal that
lower oil and gas prices and lower
demand for energy products in light of
weakness among the world’s developed
economies created challenges for most
companies.
OGJ
looked at
the fourthquarter
2009 and
full-year
2009 results of three samples of companies and
found that with one exception, each of
the groups—US-based operators, Canadian producers and pipeline firms, and
service and supply companies—collectively posted weaker earnings reports
from a year earlier.
The sample of oil and gas producers
and refiners based in the US recorded
an improvement in combined net
income for the 2009 fourth quarter,
as fewer of these companies incurred
a loss for these 3 months vs. the final
2008 quarter.
During last year’s fourth quarter,
the front-month futures price of oil
on the New York Mercantile Exchange
recorded a higher average than during
the final 2008 quarter, at $76.13/bbl vs.
$59.06/bbl. But the average gas futures
price in the recent quarter was $4.927/
MMbtu, down from $6.398/MMbtu a
year earlier.

Mar. 16, 2009, p. 30).
Seventeen of the companies in the
sample of 53 US-based firms recorded
a net loss in the 2009 fourth quarter,
while 27 of these companies incurred a
loss for the final 2008 quarter. For the
year, however, the number of companies that recorded a loss was 32. For
2008, there were 16 companies in this
group that incurred a net loss.
Some of the operators in the sample
improved on their fourth-quarter 2008
results, including Murphy Oil Corp.
and Occidental Petroleum Corp. Meanwhile, others such as Apache Corp.,
ConocoPhillips, and Hess Corp. posted
positive net income after recording a
loss for the last quarter of 2008.
ExxonMobil Corp. and Chevron
Corp. reported a decline in earnings
for the final 2009 quarter compared
with fourth-quarter 2008 results. Both
of these integrated firms announced
a climb in upstream earnings and a
decline in downstream results.
ExxonMobil announced its fourthquarter 2009 upstream earnings were
$5.78 billion, up $146 million from
the fourth quarter of 2008. Higher
crude oil realizations increased earnings by $1.8 billion, while lower gas
realizations reduced earnings by $1.2
billion. Lower gains from asset sales decreased earnings by $600 million. On
an oil-equivalent basis, the company’s
production increased nearly 2% from a
year earlier.
Downstream operations recorded
a loss of $189 million in the recent
quarter, down $2.6 billion from a year
earlier, ExxonMobil reported, while

was 9% higher than a year earlier,
driven by new production from several
major capital projects.
“In our downstream business, our
operated refineries continued to run
reliably during the fourth quarter.
However, this operational success did
not offset the effects of low margins on
the sale of gasoline and other refined
products due to weak demand and
excess supply worldwide,” said Chevron
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
John Watson.

Refiners
Weak refining and marketing margins continued to plague the results of
the refining companies in the sample of
US-based firms.
The US gulf coast cash refining margin in the fourth quarter of 2009 fell to
average $1.07/bbl, according to Muse
Stancil & Co. A year earlier the same
margin averaged $5.45/bbl.
Valero Energy Corp. reported that
its fourth-quarter 2009 results include
$18.87 billion in revenues and a $1.4

quarter.
For all of 2009, the San Antoniobased refiner posted a $1.98 billion loss
vs. a $1.13 billion loss for 2008. “Weak
demand, narrow margins, and low discounts in the fourth quarter exemplified how difficult refining conditions
were in 2009,” said Bill Klesse, Valero’s
chairman and chief executive officer.

bottom for refining profitability, there’s

‘Eye-opening experience’
“How we got here is important,”
said Solich. “We’ve been in a drilling
boom the last decade that’s been fueled
by technology and prices. We find ourselves having spent massive amounts
of capital to get this far and wondering
[why] more of our economy doesn’t
want to use more gas. It’s an eye-opening experience.”
He said that gas’s potential contribution now is dramatically different from
the 1970s when energy policymakers
considered it suitable only for heating
homes and businesses, and looked more
to coal to generate electricity. “We have
an opportunity now to look again at
the power generation mix, which is
44% coal and 24% gas, much of which
is underutilized,” Solich said. “We also
are learning more about wind and solar
power, which are intermittent, and
which fuel works best to back them

up without creating more greenhouse
gases.”
Continued federal efforts to control
GHG emissions by putting a price on
carbon dioxide or administratively
imposing onerous limits could cause
serious damage, Vincent warned. “Having an environment with fewer emissions is a goal we can all agree on,”
he said. “But [the US Environmental
Protection Agency’s] GHG endangerment finding bypasses the legislative
process and relies on questionable data.
My view is that Congress should decide
major policy shifts, not a government
agency.”
He said capital markets have become
more cautious in their outlook toward
the domestic oil and gas industry since
the 2008 election because so many
questions about the administration’s
energy, environment, and economic
strategy haven’t been answered. The

uncertainty also is hurting independents’ operations, Smith and Solich told
OGJ.
“Better technology not only lowers
costs but also increases initial production. But you can’t do it in a start-andstop mode,” said Solich. “If you put
a rig and crew together, you’ll build
efficiencies as you continue to use
them. They learn about a play’s characteristics as they work it, but it has to be
continuous.”
“We’ve seen plays emerge in Utah
over decades,” said Smith. “But permits
have dried up there now and companies are shipping crews elsewhere.
Local officials realize that jobs are
disappearing, which is why our groups
include county commissioners from
Utah and mayors from Wyoming. We
could see a real grass-roots effort to get

CFTC official wants more energy market transparency
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Energy commodities regulators
worldwide will need to move carefully
and cooperatively if they expect to
make global oil markets more transparent, US Commodity Futures Trading
Commission member Scott D. O’Malia
said in Tokyo on Feb. 26.
“We have to acknowledge that we’ve
witnessed a paradigm shift in the
global oil market over the past decade,”
he said in remarks to the International
Energy Agency and Institute of Energy
Economics Japan’s Forum on Global
Oil Market Challenges. “The paradigm
has shifted in two significant ways….
First, oil is now a financial asset and
its price movements are correlated to
economic growth. Second, the growth
in oil demand is being led by developing nations.”
O’Malia noted that Daniel Yergin,
chairman of IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said that developing
24

nations accounted for 85% of global oil
demand over the past decade, and that
the US Energy Information Administration predicts that oil demand will grow
by 44% between now and 2030.
“Future demand can readily be
anticipated since China is now the largest automobile market in the world,”
O’Malia continued. “The oil demand
shift, however, has resulted in less
transparency in oil usage and reserve
capacity in these nations. This is a very
troubling trend.”
Spare market capacity is an important factor, he said. “The price of oil
peaked in 2008 at $147/bbl, in part,
because the global demand had virtually eliminated any spare capacity in
the global oil markets. In fact, during
the price spike, there was less than 2
million b/d of spare capacity,” O’Malia
said.

Temporary condition
The global economic recession has
reduced oil demand and created some

temporary spare capacity, the CFTC
official said. He forecasts that this spare
capacity will be depleted by 2015 and
the world’s oil markets could see a return to conditions similar to 2008. “It’s
imperative that oil markets have accurate and timely data regarding tightening in market conditions if we hope to
avoid the future price spikes that will
undermine our economic growth,” he
said.
Dramatically different markets make
transparency imperative, according to
O’Malia. He said that since its formation in the 1970s, IEA has coordinated
energy policy among its member
countries and published energy utilization, refining, and reserve capacity for
the world’s largest markets. “However,
with the growth in oil demand anchored in developing nations, more
must be done to make these developing
markets as transparent and open as IEA
member countries,” he said.
Publishing data regarding oil intransit will reduce uncertainty about

what is being stored at sea or withheld
from the market, he said. “In addition,
we must call into question the practices
of certain oil traders that buy oil and put
that oil into storage, if such practices are
designed to extract money from consumers and producers,” said O’Malia.
He said changing oil demand patterns mean that IEA member countries

must be committed to expanding the
organization’s membership or creating
another data collection entity which
has the confidence of developing nations. “As a consensus on this entity
develops, G20 member nations, as set
force in their Pittsburgh communique,
must lead by example in collecting and

reporting all oil market data to make
sure that the markets are completely
transparent,” he suggested.
“The G20 nations now represent the
largest oil users and the top producing
nations,” O’Malia said. “The IEA can
facilitate the data collection in order to
prepare this data for the G20 meeting
to be held in Toronto in June.” ✦

Earlier in the hearing, Salazar observed that DOI’s 2011 budget request

“When you think of the deficit situation this country is immersed in, the
[higher oil and gas] fees are all consistent with what we think is appropriate. I don’t think any of the fees we’re
talking about are going to put anyone
out of business. There is an oil and gas
resource on our public lands that’s still
going to be out there,” he said.
Committee Democrats were generally more complimentary, including
Mary L. Landrieu (La.). “There’s a
tremendous amount of positive oil and
gas development, both onshore and offshore,” she said. “I have just been given
information about the Haynesville Shale
that suggests we have just found 250
tcf there from just one discovery. The
discoveries of natural gas in this country are beyond what even the industry
expected, and you have to be optimistic
to be in that business.
“It seems very contrary to place
heavy taxes on this industry when we
want to be energy-sufficient. I want
you to deliver that message to the administration,” she continued. “There’s
fierce bipartisan opposition to [the
White House’s] proposals to tax this
industry. They are counter to creating
jobs and counter to energy independence.”

is position hasn’t won him
many friends among coastal
property owners where he lives, but
Bruce Allen still says that the best
way to reduce pollution from oil
seeps in the Santa Barbara Channel is
to increase offshore production.
“It’s now been shown that the effects of offshore oil production have
been positive,” the cofounder of Stop
Oil Seeps California said Feb. 24 at
the Heritage Foundation, where he
presented the group’s new television
documentary, “A Crude Reality.”
Allen said, “Forty years ago, when
you’d walk along the beach in Santa
Barbara, you’d get oil on the bottoms of your feet. That’s less the case
now.”
Pressurized reserves make 70,00080,000 bbl/year of oil seep into
coastal waters off Santa Barbara, he
said. By comparison, the US Minerals Management Service says that
the amount of crude spilled from
offshore production since 1970 has
been less than 870 bbl, according to
Allen.

Stuck in past
Politicians who repeatedly cite the
1969 Union Oil Co. spill in the channel as a reason for halting new production there disregard the industry’s
technical progress, Allen maintained.
They also ignore a 1999 study that
documented that production from
the Holly offshore platform reduced
natural seeps, he said.
“A 2005 seep event killed about
twice as many birds as the 1969
spill,” said Allen. “We estimate about
20,000 birds have died this way since
1969 compared to about 4,500 from
all California offshore production.”
26

More production from Santa
Barbara coastal formations could
make it less necessary for California
refiners to import crude, he suggested. It also would help the state
address its budget crisis and improve
local economies, which was why the
county’s board of supervisors passed
a resolution backing it 2 years ago.

2009 effort
It also was why Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger and California
legislative leaders tried to get state
approval early last summer for Plains
Exploration & Production Co. to drill
directionally into formations beneath
state waters from an existing platform on a nearby federal lease.
The proposal failed, but Allen said
several participants want to revive it,
this time from sites onshore. “With
that approach, there would be no
risk of an ocean spill although other
environmental issues would need
to be addressed,” he said. But the
idea has been endorsed by candidates running for governor and for
California’s senate and assembly, he
added.
Richard L. Ranger, a senior upstream policy advisor at the American Petroleum Institute, said pollution from seeps was clearly visible
off Santa Barbara when he worked
in the area in the 1980s as an ARCO
employee. “The difference between
then and now is noticeable,” he said.
Asked if he thought alternative energy has promise, Allen said that he
does and that solar power is California’s long-term solution. “Producing
this oil instead of letting it seep into
the ocean could help us get there,”
he said. ✦

Lisa Murkowski (R-Alas.), the committee’s ranking minority member,
said Alaskans were still upset about the
US Army Corps of Engineers’ recent
aquatic resource designation decision
within the National Petroleum ReserveAlaska and asked if it will affect leasing
activity there. “We plan to examine
what happened and try to find a solution that works,” Salazar said. “When
you work with the executive side of
government, there are lots of players.
We don’t control the Corps of Engineers
or [the US Environmental Protection
Agency]. It is our intention to continue
moving forward with leasing on NPRA. We have a lease sale scheduled for
this summer, and vast amounts already
have been leased. We do not intend to
move back.”
Murkowski told him that Alaskans
also are concerned about uncertainties
centered on the administration’s OCS
plans. “You are correct in saying it’s
one thing to issue a lease and another
to support its development. We are not
yet at a final point with respect to the
OCS. We are attempting to pull together a final plan which will cover both
existing and future activities,” Salazar
replied.
“It has been difficult to do that, in
large part, because of the failure in the
2007-12 plan to perform the necessary
environmental studies that the court required,” he continued. “I had no intention to revisit it when I became secretary, but the second-highest court in the
land said that [DOI] had not followed
the necessary environmental procedures. We established that we could
go ahead on the Gulf Coast part of the
plan but had to address other segments.

Salazar said with respect to the
next 5-year plan, “We held hearings
and sought comments. We are going

close to deciding where we want to go.

CO2 injection under way in Alabama EOR pilot project
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
A project team has begun to inject
carbon dioxide into Alabama’s Citronelle field as part of a $7.9 million pilot
project to determine whether the field
is ideal for simultaneous enhanced oil
recovery and CO2 storage, the US Department of Energy said on Mar. 1.
Study results of the 7,500-ton CO2
injection will provide estimates of oil
yields from EOR and storage capacity
in depleted oil reservoirs, DOE’s Fossil
Energy Office said. Scientists from the
University of Alabama at Birmingham
(UAB) are leading the 5-month injection, which aims to prove whether oil
remaining in domestic formations can

be economically produced, it indicated.
UAB initially proposed the project
involving the state’s largest oil field 30
miles north-northwest of Mobile to
DOE in 2006. Denbury Resources Inc.,
which owns and operates the field, is
a partner, along with Southern Co., the
Alabama Geological Survey, Alabama
A&M University, and the University of
North Carolina at Charlotte.
The field may be ideal for a CO2-EOR
demonstration because it is composed
of sandstone reservoirs in a simple
structural dome and has existing infrastructure which includes deep wells,
according to DOE’s National Energy
Technology Laboratory (NETL).
“Because of the presence of the re-

gionally extensive Ferry Lake Anhydrite
seal, four-way structural closure, and
lack of faulting, it is naturally stable with
respect to CO2 storage,” NETL indicated
in January. “However, the geology of the
heterogeneous siliciclastic rocks in the
field is very different from those where
CO2-EOR has been applied commercially, such as in the carbonate strata of the
Permian and Williston basins.”
A successful demonstration could
make incremental oil recovery at Citronelle field 60% greater than from the
conventional secondary recovery which
has occurred there, DOE’s Fossil Energy
Office said. It noted that Advanced Resources International of Arlington, Va.,
estimates that some 64 million additional bbl could be recovered with EOR

at Citronelle, which was discovered in
1952.
The field’s geologic structure and
lack of faulting also may make it ideal
for CO2 storage. NETL said that capacity of depleted oil reservoirs and saline
formations in the Citronelle Dome was
estimated, by static calculations, to
be 500 million-2 billion short tons of
CO2, “sufficient to sequester the carbon
dioxide from a nearby 1,500 [Mw] coalfired power plant for 35 years.”

The project has entered its second
phase, which will include injection,
associated validation of models, and
determination of oil-CO2 mixture
properties. CO2 containment at the test
site also will be monitored in the ambient air, soil and vegetation, the Fossil
Energy Office said.
If the project is successful, it could
encourage operates to apply CO2-EOR to
other fields containing highly heterogeneous, discontinuous sands, NETL

said. “Documentation of air, soil, and
vegetation conditions before, during,
and after the pilot tests, and the absence
of environmental effects will advance
the implementation and acceptance of
[CO2] capture and storage by industry
and the public,” it added.
DOE is providing 60% of the project’s financial support with an anticipated $4.7 million outlay. The remaining $3.2 million will come from the
other partners. ✦

Trinidad and Tobago ramps up crude oil production
Curtis Williams
OGJ Correspondent
Trinidad and Tobago says it is taking
steps to increase crude oil production in an effort to balance its energy
portfolio.
Energy Minister Conrad Enill said
the twin-island nation has become too
reliant on natural gas and too vulnerable during times of weak gas prices.
Over the last 15 years, Enill said,
the country placed too much emphasis
on gas production with the construction of four LNG trains and several
downstream plants. This has occurred
while crude production continued to
fall.
Enill said, “We recognize that oil
production has been on the decline
and the country has become gas-based,
however, we would like to encourage a
mix that is more balanced.”
He said the country’s state-owned
Petrotrin will play an important role in

delivering on this objective.
“We have challenged its leadership
to organize in such a way as to support this requirement for increases in
oil production. Petrotrin in response
has begun to deliver on this mandate.”
Enill told an energy conference in Port
of Spain.
He pointed out that Petrotrin had
already granted seven sublicenses for
smaller companies to produce stripper
fields in eastern Trinidad and work is
about to start.
“We anticipate that gains in production volumes will be realized from this
initiative,” the minister said, adding,
“Petrotrin also has been mandated to
develop a program for the efficient and
effective management of the Trinmar
asset.”
Since its acquisition of the Trinmar
asset from the former Texaco Inc.,
Trinmar’s oil production has fallen
from close to 100,000 bo/d to less than
40,000 bo/d.

Enill said Petrotrin will also be
pursuing a 3D seismic program over
its assets in the North West district
and API’s Oropouche farmout area of
South Trinidad and is intended to guide
the future exploration on land and is
intended to result in the identification
of more oil drilling locations.
Helena Inniss-King, the country’s
director of resource management, said
rebalancing is crucial and pointed out
that the Central Range (Shallow Horizon), Central Range(Deep Horizon),
Guyaguyare (Shallow Horizon), and
Guyaguyare (Deep Horizon) that were
allocated in 2009 are all expected to
produce oil.
Inniss-King said Trinidad and
Tobago will also be exploring the
possibility of producing its significant
reserves of heavy oil if the economics
allow it.
Trinidad and Tobago produces 4.1
bcfd of gas and 110,000 bo/d and is the
largest exporter of LNG to the US. ✦

and maybe twice that, Farris said, adding “It has taken the exploratory side
out of the business.”
He said, “Conversion of 25% of the
US vehicle fleet to gas would lower oil
imports by 5 million b/d.”
And increased gas use would help
the US reduce emissions of greenhouse
gases as a remedy for climate change.
“At some point we’re going to get
legislation,” Farris said. “If we are serious about carbon dioxide then we will
be serious about natural gas.”

Attention due
Pickens said the plan to increase gas
consumption that he has promoted in
Congress will receive attention when
Washington, DC, moves away from
health care.
“I’ve nailed myself to a date,” he
said. “Memorial Day.”
Pickens has spearheaded efforts to

create tax incentives for gas-fueled vehicles. Bills containing such incentives
have been introduced in the House and
Senate (OGJ, July 20, 2009, p. 33).
“I don’t want any subsidies for
natural gas,” Pickens said. “All I want is
encouragement to get our heavy-duty
vehicles over to natural gas.”
Asked about incentives for construction of gas-fueling equipment, he said,
“Let private industry provide the infrastructure.”
Pickens focuses his arguments on
cutting imports of oil from members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, saying, “We’re dependent on oil from countries that hate
us.”
He targets heavy-duty vehicles
because gas is the only practicable
substitute for the diesel they now burn.
If the 8 million trucks now on US roads
burned gas instead of diesel, Pickens

said, the country would import 2.5
million b/d less oil—half what it now
imports from OPEC members.
Also at the convention, Regina Hopper, president and chief executive officer of America’s Natural Gas Alliance,
offered TIPRO members political advice
for promoting natural gas.
“We need to communicate very effectively that this clean American product is available right now,” she said. ✦

BP seeking to boost profits by $3 billion/year
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
BP PLC on Mar. 2 outlined its annual
strategy presentation in which Chief
Executive Tony Hayward said the company hopes to boost its profits before
taxes by more than $3 billion/year
within 3 years.
Speaking to analysts, Hayward said
BP forecasts its oil and gas production
will grow by 1-2%/year on average
during 2008-15 based upon oil prices
of $60/bbl. Last year, BP said it produced 4 million boe/d, up 4% from
2008.
Hayward sees more opportunities

The round’s launch coincided with
an annual report by the Norwegian

the report said, adding that “advanced
technological environments in the Norwegian petroleum and energy sphere
will be vulnerable targets.”
“Currently the greatest intelligence
activity registered by PST has been
within the management of the oil and
gas resources in the High North,” said
the PST report.
“The extraction of oil and gas resources in the north constantly requires
technological innovation,” it said,
noting that several intelligence services
focus on such technological environments to enable them to gain a competitive edge.
“Norwegian specialist communities are technologically far ahead in
this field and must therefore expect
undesired intelligence activities to be
directed at their work,” the report said.
Foreign states’ intelligence activity will continue to be geared towards
political decision makers, employees
in bureaucracy, players in the business sector, journalists, and individuals
working in research and development,
the report said.
No specific foreign intelligence
services or countries were named in the

f there is anything the oil and gas
industry desperately needs, it is
business. For that reason, British and
Argentinean officials should stop
touting their respective rights in the
South Atlantic and think of doing
business together out there.
Is the idea unthinkable? Certainly
not, as shown in a recent announcement by Spanish-Argentine oil group
Repsol-YPF SA that it plans to start
drilling for oil in the Falklands basin
by yearend.
According to a company spokesperson, Repsol YPF’s drilling will
take place within Argentine territorial
waters and “far from the disputed waters” around the British-ruled Falkland
Islands, which Argentina also claims.
“We’re now in the phase of contracting the oil rig,” said Repsol YPF’s
Chief Executive Officer Antonio Brufau, adding that the consortium will
go ahead with its plans even though

dispute has revived tensions which
exploded in 1982 when Argentinean
troops staged a surprise landing on
the islands to assert their claim to the
territory.
The result of that landing, in case
anyone needs a reminder, was a
74-day war between the two sides
in which 649 Argentine and 255

died. Those figures are, or should be,
enough to keep both sides talking.

including the high permeability zones
in the Eocene age Oldsmar formation,
commonly referred to as the “boulder

As the number of exploratory wells
in the trend increased, the importance
of subsurface mapping has also increased.
Oil from the Sunniland formation
fields typically has gravities in the mid
to high 20o range, low gas-oil ratios,
and moderately high sulfur content. It
is trucked from the Lehigh Park tank
battery to Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, from where it is transported by
tanker, usually to refineries in the Texas
Gulf Coast. Large volumes of hypersaline produced water are also common,
requiring installation of water disposal
wells.
The Sunniland formation is a selfcontained petroleum system with its
own reservoir, source rock, and trap.
The reservoir is provided by porous dolomitic limestones that were deposited
in shallow water biohermal buildups.
Primary depositional porosity is the
dominant porosity type, with later enhancement by partial dolomitization.
The source rock is dark micritic,
moderately organic-rich limestones in
the lower part of the Sunniland formation. Thick anhydrite beds overlie (Lake
Trafford anhydrite) and underlie (Punta
Gorda anhydrite) the Sunniland formation.
Structural trapping of the hydrocarbons at Lehigh Park is due to four-way
closure related to the breaking of a
southeast plunging anticlinal nose by
a small northeast trending, high-angle,
normal fault1 (Fig. 3).

most of the surface and mineral rights
in the area, and most of the area had
been planned for residential development, access for petroleum exploration
was limited to lots platted for future
church sites by that company or to the

few parcels controlled by others.
Prior to completion of the Lehigh
Park field discovery well in July 1974,
only two petroleum test wells had been
drilled in the area proximal to the field.
One of these was a shallow (3,018 ft)
test drilled in 1924 by Florida Exploration.

The Sunniland
formation was
subdivided in this
field study into
four units, which
with increasing
depth, as shown
on cross-section A-A’ (Fig. 4), have
been labeled as Zones A through D.
Porosity development is possible in
each zone. Dense, low porosity, correlatable stratigraphic units provide
vertical separation between these zones.
Porosity is best developed in Zone B at
Lehigh Park field; this is the producing
interval in the field. A porosity isopach
map for Zone B (Fig. 5) shows the
extensive porosity buildup in the field
area.
In a core study2 of the Sunniland formation in Lehigh Park field, 11 carbonate and evaporite facies were described
and attributed to five depositional
environments. These are, in order of
decreasing water depth, shallow water
shelf, shoal water bioherm, restricted
and open lagoon, tidal flat, and sabkha.
The hydrocarbon-productive zone was
determined to have been deposited in
shoal water biohermal patch reef environments. These deposits are thought to
have undergone early subaerial expo-

Exploration has been very sparse in
the deeper basin area, which is mainly
offshore.
In its year 2000 assessment of the
onshore and state waters (i.e., to 12
miles offshore) portion of the South
Florida basin,5 the US Geological Survey
calculated a mean of 25 undiscovered
fields in the Sunniland Trend with
mean field size of 5 million bbl of oil.
Thus, Lehigh Park field is significant
from the aspect that it would be a typical analog for future discoveries in the
onshore portion of the trend.
The USGS5 recognized two petroleum systems in the South Florida basin—an oil-prone Dollar Bay/Sunniland
system and an underlying gas-prone
system below the Punta Gorda anyhydrite. Numerous oil shows have been
reported in the Dollar Bay formation,

basin, the USGS noted that oil expulsion rates in the Sunniland formation
should be higher in the offshore portion of the basin than in the onshore
portion due to deeper burial and
entrance into the oil window earlier.
Sequence stratigraphic models also
indicate that much larger hydrocarbon

accumulations could be present in the
offshore portions of the basin, potentially up to giant field size.
The presence of more significant
structural features and related hydrocarbon traps is also likely in the offshore portion of the basin due to closer
proximity to structural elements related

to the evolution of the Gulf of Mexico.
A recent inventory10 of world petroleum reserves and historical production
concluded that 56% of all petroleum
discovered to date has been from carbonate reservoirs, and of that 64% has
been in traps that have anhydrite seals.
Thus, the offshore portion of the
South Florida basin, which contains the
distal depositional settings of a rimmed
arid carbonate shelf during the Mesozoic, is one of the few areas in the US
that remains essentially untested. It has
been under a federal drilling moratorium since 1982 (currently scheduled
to expire in 2022) but potentially could
be a location for prolific domestic hydrocarbon production, with fields that
could compare to those of the Sonda de
Campeche. ✦

eedstock prices, coproduct

yields determine ethylene production costs. Petral maintains direct
contact with the olefin industry and
tracks historic trends in spot prices
for ethylene and propylene. We use
a variety of sources to track trends in
feedstock prices.
Some ethylene plants have the
necessary process units to convert
all coproducts to purity streams.
Some do not have, however, the
capability to upgrade mixed or
crude streams of various coproducts and sell some or all their coproducts at discounted prices. We
evaluate ethylene production costs

Ethylene producers were also happy
to see positive margins for natural

As the demand for petrochemicals

lion tpy of ethylene capacity, and Facts
Global Energy expects it to add another
5.4 million tpy of ethylene capacity this
year.
Figs. 1 and 2 show that about 50%
of capacity addition from start of 2009
to yearend 2015 occurs in second-half
2009 and in 2010. These peaks in the
capacity additions are mainly due to
China and India.
China will be responsible for 54%
of the new capacity 2010-15. In 2005,
China surpassed Japan to rank second
globally in ethylene production capacity. It is currently behind the US by a
whopping 25 million tpy, but this gap
is narrowing rapidly.
China had 13.9 million tpy of ethylene capacity in place at yearend 2009.
Of the 8.7 million tpy capacity the
country will add through 2015, 42%
will be achieved in the next 2 years. By
yearend 2015, China will have more
capacity than Japan, South Korea, and
Taiwan combined.
Recently, the Sinopec/ExxonMobil/
Saudi Aramco joint venture began to
produce from its 800,000-tpy ethylene
plant at Fujian (OGJ Online, Nov. 11,
2009). Meanwhile, in early November,
the Sinopec/SABIC Tianjin joint venture
started trial runs at its 1-million-tpy
ethylene plant.
PetroChina has also started trial runs
at its 1-million-tpy Dushanzi ethylene
plant. The construction of PetroChina’s
Qinzhou and Sinopec’c Zhenhai ethylene plants, both 1 million tpy each, are
complete and ready to commence trial
runs soon.
At present, China’s demand for
ethylene equivalent far exceeds its supply. It produced slightly more than 10
million tonnes of ethylene equivalent in
2008, while import needs stood at 12
million tonnes. For 2009, its ethyleneequivalent demand increased by around
25%, thanks to the 4 trillion Yuan
($586 billion) stimulus plan and other
policies to boost domestic consumption.
The increase in basic petrochemicals demand in 2009 was largely met
by imports. Table 1 indicates that the

FGE believes
that the near-term
large capacity additions in the Middle
East and China will sharply affect the
market.
By September 2010 ethylene capacity in China and the Middle East will
increase by 5.1 million tpy and 6.5
million tpy, respectively (Tables 2 and
3). Long-term prospects for East Asian
petrochemical players look bright. This
will entirely depend, however, on the
pace at which economies grow and
especially the robustness of Chinese
demand.

Asian aromatics
Asian aromatics (benzene, toluene,
and xylene) production capacity is
growing more slowly than its ethylene
counterpart (Figs. 4 and 5). FGE expects
the Asian aromatics production capacity to increase by about 26% by 2016
with China alone accounting for 59% of
those additions.

After 25 continuous years of growth,
Asian naphtha consumption fell (–1.4%)
in 2008, the result of the dramatic
slowdown of the petrochemical sector
in fourth-quarter 2008 associated with
the global financial crisis.
The petrochemical sector bounced
back strongly in 2009, especially in
second quarter. The naphtha crackers
in South Korea as well as Formosa Petrochemical Corp.’s crackers in Taiwan
were running full in second-quarter
2009. This turnaround can be attributed to:

lower than initially expected.
• The slow start and ramp up of
new ethylene plants in the Middle East.
• China’s stimulus package that
lifted polymer demand in China.
In the future, naphtha will remain the primary feedstock for Asian
petrochemical plants. With massive
capacities coming on stream within the
next year in China and the Middle East,
however, FGE expects that Taiwan’s,
South Korea’s, and Japan’s crackers will
be forced to run at a lower rate in the
near term.
Based on these observations, FGE

In 2008, South Korea overtook Japan
as the largest naphtha consumer in
Asia. With development of the petrochemical sector in South Korea, its
naphtha consumption climbed steeply
but is now leveling off.
Its total naphtha demand in 2008
was 844,000 b/d and will increase in
2009 to 871,000 b/d. In 2010, however,
FGE anticipates a drop in demand of
around 5% to 825,000 b/d. For 2011-15,
FGE expects South Korea’s naphtha demand to grow at a 2.9%/year, to reach
954,000 b/d in 2015.
Japan is a large but declining consumer. Its naphtha demand in 2008 was
779,000 b/d, down by 8.3% from 2007.
Japan’s naphtha demand will decline at
2.8%/year 2008-15.
As with so much else, China will
drive naphtha demand in Asia-Pacific.
In 2008, its naphtha demand was
605,000 b/d, and it was a net exporter
at 17,000 b/d. In 2009, estimated
Chinese naphtha demand increased by
10%, to 665,000 b/d, and the country became a net importer. Between

The Baltic Sea region’s
role on Europe’s energy
map will grow in the
Pipelines
near future. The Baltic
accounts for more than
15% of global cargo transportation.1
But it is also a fragile environment.
It is a shallow (average depth 50 m
compared with 1,300 m for the Black
Sea and 1,500 m for the Mediterranean)
and almost closed body of water; only
3% of its water is exchanged each year
with the neighboring North Sea.2
Faced with the growing use of the
sea as a transit route and accompanying logistical difficulties, the EU has
adopted a more coherent strategic
approach for the region than it did for
the similar transportation bottleneck
in the Black Sea region. This article
examines the recent evolution of oil
and gas shipment in the Baltic region
before discussing measures currently
being considered by the EU to implement critical gas infrastructure projects
proposed by the Baltic Energy Market
Interconnection Plan among other
initiatives.
Pursuing these initiatives is especially important during periods of
economic crisis or slowdown when it’s
easier to put projects on hold, despite
their long-term strategic importance.
The EU should develop a regional
energy dialogue with the main oil and
gas supplier in the Baltic Sea region,
the Russian Federation, by including it
in the implementation of its Baltic Sea
regional strategy. A regional EU-Russia
energy dialogue forum would allow

another 10-20 million tpy to Baltic Sea
oil tanker transit.
The European Union already considers the Baltic Sea an oil transportation
chokepoint similar to more famous
bottlenecks such as the Strait of Hormuz, the Suez Canal, or the Strait of
Malacca. The busy oil tanker transit
creates environmental risks for the
region, the Baltic already suffering 120
ship accidents in 2007.2
The Baltic Sea is poised also to become a major natural gas transit region.
Nord Stream, a double 1,220-km gas
pipeline, will be the first major natural
gas pipeline to cross the Baltic Sea and
bring Russian gas to the Germany and
other European markets.
The first line, with a capacity of
27.5 billion cu m/year is planned for
completion in 2011, while the second
pipeline, double capacity to 55 billion
cu m/year would become operational
in 2012 (Fig. 2).
Other international gas pipeline
projects crossing the Baltic Sea are in

different stages of planning, including
the BalticPipe (Denmark to Poland)
and Baltic Connector (Finland-Estonia)
pipelines, and no less than five LNG
terminals in Finland, Estonia, Latvia,
Lithuania, and Poland.3
The amount of coordination and cooperation needed during the planning
of the first phase of the Nord Stream
project due to its political, legal and,
environmental complexity highlights
the problems faced by future similar
pipeline projects in the region. A recent
European Union study stated that eventual LNG shipping in the Baltic Sea remains legally uncertain. The study also
concluded LNG shipping in the Baltic
Sea would increase bottlenecks for an
already busy shipping region.4
The natural gas consumption of
most Baltic countries—with the notable
exception of Sweden, which wants to
move away from all fossil fuels—has
increased and is forecast to continue
to growing, especially given the EU’s
strong policy agenda promoting the use

of natural gas as a relatively less polluting fossil fuel than oil or coal. Natural
gas consumption in Poland, as an example, is forecast to increase to around
20-22 billion cu m/year in 2030 from
current levels around 13-15 billion cu
m/year.5
The EU has also strongly supported
liberalization and opening of national
gas markets to create EU-wide energy
markets instead. Its policy efforts,
however, are less advanced in the oil
market and oil transportation. The
historical development of their oil and
gas transportation networks has kept
Finland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania
essentially isolated from the wider EU
oil and gas transportation systems,2
limiting liberalization and creating supply and price risks.

EU strategy
As early as the 1990s, the EU moved
to address some of its infrastructural
shortcomings through regional initiatives and action plans, as well as

through three internal energy market
legislative packages. These early initiatives included Baltic 21, a regional
process for creating sustainable development in the region through cooperation among different stakeholder
categories; Basrec—the Baltic Sea Region Energy Cooperation; and Baltrel,
the Baltic Ring Electricity Cooperation
Committee.6 Each sought a regional gas
market, the diversification of gas supply sources, and common measures of
supply security.
The first energy market legislative
package, the Gas Directive of 1998,
asked EU countries to partially open
gas markets to competition by allowing
large users to choose their suppliers in
an effort to avoid any discrimination by
national gas monopolies.
The second Gas Directive in 2003
required each country to create a
transmission system operator (TSO) in
charge of operating, maintaining, and
developing the national gas transmission pipeline network. By July 2007 all
gas customers were able to choose their
gas supplier.

The third legislative package, the
Internal Energy Market package, approved in 2009, contains a directive on
the common internal market for natural
gas and regulation of conditions for
access to the natural gas transmission
networks,7 pushing liberalization of the
national gas markets further toward the
creation of an EU-wide market.
The European Council invited the
EU Commission in 2007 to present an
EU strategy for the Baltic Sea region,
approved in June 2009, marking the
first time the EU has adopted this
type of strategic approach. One of the
main action plans of the new regional
strategy is the Baltic Energy Market
Interconnection Plan.3 This plan focuses
on both the power and gas sectors, its
main objectives for the gas sector being to support projects connecting the
Baltic energy markets to EU markets,
increase the security of supply, and
diversify supply sources.
Specific objectives for gas infrastructure development are:
• Ending the energy isolation and
decrease dependence on a single ex-

ternal gas supplier of Finland, Estonia,
Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland.
• Defining and strengthening Poland’s role as an energy bridge to the
other countries. Supply to Poland from
Germany, Denmark, or LNG is necessary to move it further to eastern Baltic
Sea nations.
• Assessing LNG’s potential for
diversifying supply sources in the Baltic
Sea region.
• Compensating for the decline in
the Danish gas reserves and providing new gas sources to Denmark and
Poland, through new infrastructure
projects in the West Baltic Sea region.3
The Ramboll report, delivered in
preparation for the EU Strategy for the
Baltic Sea Region meetings, identified
several missing links in the regional gas
infrastructure, including the following:
• Finland to another EU member
state. With plans for establishing a gas
network in Sweden halted, however,
the only short-term solution seems to
be a connection to Estonia such as the
Baltic Connector.
• Estonia, Latvia, or Lithuania to one

of the member states already interconnected to the other EU markets, Poland
or Germany.
• Norway to Denmark or Norway to
Sweden, diversifying gas supply with
Norwegian imports.
• Denmark to Poland.
• Germany to Sweden.8
The solutions proposed include
new pipelines (see table), a number
of which were put on hold due to the
effects of the global economic crisis
on gas demand and potential financing. Skanled, for instance, which would
have brought Norwegian gas to the
Baltic was suspended in April 2009.
Proposed solutions also included
increased capacity through existing
pipeline interconnections; reversed
flow in the existing pipelines, such as
Yamal-Europe and LNG terminal in the
Baltic Sea; and new gas storage projects,
especially in Latvia, Lithuania, Poland,
and Germany.
The European Union is also assessing measures for creating a more
coherent policy framework to address
present and future oil transportation
problems. The Oil Infrastructures
report1 recommends the EU develop
an oil dimension to its energy policy
instruments (currently including only
electricity and gas) so it can better
coordinate development of an EU-wide
oil infrastructure and better manage
future oil bottlenecks such as the Baltic
Sea region.
The report also recommends including oil infrastructure projects in
the Trans-European Networks-Energy
program, providing selected projects
with political support and financing.
Another recommendation is to develop
a more coherent EU-wide dialogue
with the major oil suppliers, including
Russia. ✦

New tool sizes, detects corrosion features in pipelines
The GEMINI system is a new range of
combo tools that provide caliper, metal
loss, and mapping information in a single
tool.
The tool uses an active speed control
with a gas bypass capability to run in
high-speed gas pipelines to obtain corrosion and deformation information without
restricting gas flow or line speed. It allows
pipeline operators to accurately size and
detect corrosion features using triaxial
sensor technology.
In addition to sizing and detecting
corrosion features, the design of the tool
sensors effectively detects cracks in dents
and other mechanical damage, including
wrinkles, gouging, and metal loss within
dents.
The tool also sizes and detects dents in
the pipeline.

Frac fluid fears
show capacity
for inconsistency
Controversy over hydraulic fracturing
fluids and their possible effect on drinking
water demonstrates the boundless human
capacity for inconsistency.
Although chances are low that injected
frac fluid will find its way down anyone’s
throat, fear persists in parts of the US
about contamination of subsurface drinking water.
It persists despite the tens of thousands

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s

of frac jobs producers have performed
over 60 years without fouling groundwater.
And it persists despite explanations
about vertical separation between injection targets and freshwater aquifers, about
mechanical controls that keep injectants
from entering sensitive strata, and about
regulations in place to ensure safe work.
A reason the fear persists is that people
don’t know what’s in the small fraction of
most frac fluid that isn’t sand and water.
The ingredients, in many cases, are commercial secrets.
Companies compete on the basis of
the performance of the frac fluids they
sell or use—how well they carry proppant,
transmit pressure, and clean out fractures,
for example. The companies don’t want
competitors to know what they put into the
fluids to make them work as they do.
So an activity mysterious to people
unfamiliar with it contains something
unknown, which opponents of the activity
spin into fear.
The fear is of tiny constituents of a fluid
that probably never will come anywhere
close to drinking water.
And it’s enough to threaten with federal regulation an operation essential to
development of gas shales—and thus of
a potentially enormous supply of clean,
secure energy.
Yet Americans deliberately drink an average of 3,296 oz/year each of a liquid the
formula for which is a notorious secret.
They drink it knowing full well, if they
read labels, that each ounce delivers 12
calories, 3.3 g of sugar, and virtually no
nutrition. In other words, what people
already know about this liquid should
stir worry. And if reaction to frac fluid in
the US Northeast followed a pattern for
consummately reasonable behavior, what
people don’t know about this other liquid’s
“natural flavors” long ago would have
inspired calls for federal regulation.
But people like how Coca-Cola tastes,
so consistency doesn’t matter.

US oil production climbs
Unlike most producers outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the US “put up remarkably strong oil production growth of 7.1% in 2009” after “a nearly nonstop decline” for the past 3 decades, said analysts in the Houston
office of Raymond James & Associates Inc.
A production increase of some 320,000 b/d—“60% of the net growth or 41% of
the gross, predecline growth”—came from “one-time items” such as post-hurricane recovery in the Gulf of Mexico and the first full year of production from Thunder Horse, the world’s largest deepwater development. “The rest of the growth
(which should be more sustainable) came from more structural and organic drivers, including strong growth in deep water, the Bakken [shale], and rising onshore
natural gas liquids volumes. Since only the second category represents growth
that can be sustained for more than a few years, we see low single-digit annualized
growth in oil production as the most that the US can realistically achieve over the
next 3 years,” Raymond James analysts said.
US oil production may continue to grow on “a steady-state” basis for a few
years. “But even under a very optimistic scenario it won’t be anything close to
the 7.1% growth rate of 2009. Low single-digit annualized growth is the most we
can envision for the next 3-5 years. Our ‘best guess’ scenario is that production
will grow around 200,000 b/d for the next 2 years and then flatten after that,” said
Raymond James analysts.
Raymond James currently projects 3.4% growth in 2010-12, followed by 1%/year
declines thereafter. “While the US most likely won’t go back to its steep historical
declines anytime soon, it’s unrealistic to expect future growth to be anything close
to 2009 levels. As a result, the US shouldn’t be a major factor (either positive or
negative) for future changes in non-OPEC production, which means non-OPEC is
still set to decline over time,” the analysts said.
Earthquake impact
The massive 8.8-magnitude earthquake that rocked Chile Feb. 27, killing hundreds and triggering a tsunami, also forced the shutdown of the two largest of
Chile’s three refineries, accounting for more than 220,000 b/d of capacity.
That had little effect on energy markets when they opened Mar. 1. But the two
refineries are the largest producers of diesel in Chile, which is the fourth-largest
oil consumer in Latin America. Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland,
said, “In the first half of 2008, Chile was instrumental in the support to the distillate cracks as it was sucking cargoes of gas oil to answer the power generation
deficit generated by drought. If the refineries have suffered some damages in the
earthquake, this could result in some incremental demand and could help the US
Gulf [Coast] refineries to place unwanted cargoes of distillates. Developments and
damage assessment in Chile will need to be monitored for their potential support
to the distillate market.”
The refineries apparently sustained greater damage than Chile’s copper mines,
which were further from the epicenter. Nonetheless, one fifth of its copper production was suspended. Chile is the world’s largest producer of copper. Prices for that
commodity rallied 5% to the highest levels in 5 weeks in futures markets Mar. 1.
Gas production declines
The Energy Information Administration reported a sequential decline in US
natural gas production from the Lower 48 in December, down 500 MMcfd to 62.82
bcfd despite weather-related well freeze-offs that affected production. Wyoming
and New Mexico declined by 200 MMcfd each while Texas reported a 100 MMcfd
production decline. Louisiana reported only 0.9% month-on-month production
growth, lowest since the beginning of last year.
“Since peaking in February 2009, the US Lower 48 production was down only
by approximately 760 MMcfd or nearly 1.2% by yearend 2009,” said Pritchard
Capital Partners LLC, New Orleans. “As we anticipated, the EIA data further indicated that natural gas supplies are holding firm. We believe that the EIA-reported
supplies figures would continue to show resilience as more E&P firms probably
brought drilled but uncompleted well inventory online to time the pricing support
over winter,” the analyst said.
Raymond James analysts, meanwhile, said, “The December supply datapoint
is the cleanest we have had in the past couple of months.” They see gas prices as
“likely headed lower this year.”

The commissioning of the KG-D6 project marks a proud
new milestone in the journey of Reliance Industries
Ltd. Bearing the names of the sacred rivers of Krishna
and Godavari, and paying tribute to the inexhaustible
inspiration of Dhirubhai Ambani, our Founder, the KGD6 project is truly an infrastructural marvel on the
eastern coast of India. It has propelled Reliance to a
higher growth trajectory and transformed the energy
landscape of India.
In the successful execution of this project in highly
challenging frontiers, Reliance has created a new
chapter in the annals of India’s E&P sector. It has
announced to the world that Reliance has arrived as
a global energy player, even as it has opened new
avenues in value creation. We are committed, and
now poised, to make a material difference to the global
energy industry, and to the energy security of India.
This book tells the story of how one of Reliance’s dream
projects moved from concept to commissioning. It also
showcases the never-say-die spirit of our project teams
who, working under the guidance of Mr. P.M.S. Prasad,
have tirelessly executed this massive project, despite
extreme hardships in the deep-sea environment and
acute shortages in the global supply chain.

Reliance Industries Ltd. DHIRUBHAI 1 & 3

Introduction
Deepwater Fields Transform India’s Energy Landscape:
Every once in a while there comes a game changer, sometimes through
serendipity and sometimes through grit and resolve. Here is a project
that showcases how grit, resolve and world class management can
impact an entire nation’s destiny.

The discovery and subsequent development of the deepwater oil and gas fields,
in the KG-D6 Block off the Bay of Bengal
in the east coast of India, have important
ramifications for the country’s energy security. And the discovery and development
project has been executed by India’s largest
corporate house, Reliance Industries Ltd
(RIL).
In fact, RIL is already producing natural
gas from the Dhirubhai - 1 & 3 gas fields
(D1&D3) since April 1, 2009, and light
crude oil from the Dhirubhai 26 (D26) oil
field, since September 17, 2008. Both projects have been commissioned in a record
time –the D1 & D3 fields in about six and

half years, and the D26 field in just a little
over two years - from discovery.
Gas from these fields flows via a subsea
architecture, through a Control and Riser
Platform (CRP), to an Onshore Terminal
(OT) located at Gadimoga on the east coast
of India. Oil flows though a subsea system
tied-back to a Floating, Production, Storage
and Offloading (FPSO) vessel from where
it is dispensed through shuttle tankers to
local refineries.
These hydrocarbon finds by RIL are not
only trendsetters in the exploration and
production of oil and gas in India, but they
also herald the renaissance of India’s quest
for energy self-sufficiency.

A project of this magnitude and complexity defies conventional norms of E&P, especially when you have to build

• Flexibility in design to ensure higher production from wells - allowing 9 5⁄8”, as well as 7” completions
• Ensure effective and proven sand face completions with high quality gravel packing
• Use of proven components in design, and state-of-the-art equipment, tools and
technologies used in deepwater gas developments around the world
• Minimized well intervention requirements
• Standardization of completion design and equipment for
enhanced operational efficiency and flexibility
• Use of Temperature Array Sensor (TAS) System in selected wells, perhaps a first in reservoir
temperature monitoring in the world. TAS is used to understand the reservoir during production.

Transocean and Reliance:
Pioneering Deepwater Drilling
MUMBAI — Since 2002, Transocean and Reliance have advanced deepwater drilling in India, starting with the
customer’s first offshore discovery and more recently developing the next-generation of ultra-deepwater drillships.

Company Profile T
. RANSOCEAN

hile working on Reliance’s
Krishna Godavari (KG) field,
the world’s largest deepwater
natural gas field, Transocean’s drillships
Discoverer 534 helped Reliance set the
pace for commissioning the field in record
time and the Deepwater Frontier drilled
India’s first subsea completion wells. The
campaign included an Indian deepwater
drilling record and a string of discoveries.
It came during a time of progress for
both Transocean, including a strong fleet
expansion, and for Reliance, which has
added significant gas reserves in India.
“With such a wide range of progress
in a relatively short period, Reliance and
Transocean have gained valuable experience and forged a strong relationship,”
said Deepak Munganahalli, Managing
Director of Transocean’s India and
Middle East Division. “We look forward
to additional successes helping Reliance
achieve its goals and further securing
India’s energy future.”

W

Overcoming Challenges
From the beginning, the Discoverer 534
proved successful for Reliance, drilling
the Dhirubhai discovery in 2002 and subsequent finds in Block KGD6. Success
required overcoming challenges ranging
from drilling operations in deepwater,
including an Indian deepwater drilling
record early on of 5,773 feet of water
(1,760 meters), to strong surface currents
and complex logistics.
At times, surface currents approaching 5 knots, the equivalent of about 60
knots of wind, pushed on the rig. In addition, 35-knot winds sometimes arose.
Nevertheless, the rig’s crews adapted
to these challenging conditions using
Transocean’s safety and risk-management tools and training, the drillship’s
dynamic positioning system and close
communications during all operations.

Transocean’s deepwater drillship Discoverer 534 drilled a string of Block D-6 discoveries.

Risk-Management Leadership
To ensure success, Transocean and
Reliance worked closely before, during
and after drilling operations. The team
developed the highest quality safety,
environmental, risk-management, operational, logistical, materials-procurement
and other management systems.
Both companies share the vision
of an incident-free workplace in which
everyone must return from work as safe

as when they arrived. Supporting these
efforts is Transocean’s on-the-job training program, the most advanced in the
offshore drilling sector.
Another contributing factor to the KG
field success was Transocean’s extensive
knowledge of worldwide deepwater
operations that includes 80 percent of all
deepwater drilling records. This deep pool
of expertise and experience proved useful
during challenging Indian operations.

Likewise, Transocean’s offices in
Mumbai and supply yards on the East
and West Coasts of India have contributed by overcoming logistics challenges
to provide expertise, supplies and parts.

Transocean personnel continue making
offshore drilling history in India.

Toward New Frontiers
When the Discoverer 534 arrived in
India in 2002, it was the only rig in India
capable of operating in water depths
greater than 3,000 feet. Moving ahead,
Reliance hired additional rigs for its
exploration efforts in mid-water and
deepwater. Transocean is pleased to
be a partner with RIL in these efforts
through long- term contracts on the
drillships Deepwater Frontier (since
2006) and Deepwater Expedition (since
2008), still working in India today, and
the semisubmersible rigs Actinia and C.
Kirk Rhein, Jr. in recent years.
Also today, Transocean, Pacific
Drilling and Reliance have introduced
to India the latest generation of ultradeepwater drillships, the Dhirubhai
Deepwater KG-1 and Dhirubhai
Deepwater KG-2. With a variable deckload of approximately 20,000 metric
tons, these rigs can work in 10,000 to
12,000 feet of water and are outfitted to
construct wells 35,000 feet deep.
Transocean and Reliance will also
introduce the newbuild ultra-deepwater
drillship Discoverer India, which will be
capable of working in up to 10,000 feet

of water and drilling wells 35,000 feet.
Transocean’s fifth enhanced Enterpriseclass drillship, the Discoverer India is
expected to mobilize from the shipyard
to India in the fourth quarter of 2010.
In addition, offshore drilling technology pioneered by Transocean and
Reliance in areas beside the KG basin
includes the use of managed pressure
drilling on the Deepwater Frontier and
the Actinia.
“It’s always great to be recognized
for leadership in offshore drilling,” said
Munganahalli, “and it’s especially meaningful when it’s for work with a customer like Reliance, which has proven
its leadership time and time again. The
results of our relationship are special,
and we are proud of everything our
team has achieved.”

Integrated Project Teams Achieve
Fast-Track Conclusion at KG-D6
Aggressive development schedule challenge met by Reliance, Schlumberger

Company Profile S
. CHLUMBERGER

rom the very start, Schlumberger
has been involved in developing
deepwater projects, contributing
its marine seismic, data and consulting,
reservoir evaluation and wireline, drilling
and measurement, testing and other
uniquely related technologies and
services for the exploration, completion
and production phases. Based upon
RIL’s unique needs for the KG-D6
development, Schlumberger has applied
several new game-changing completion
and production monitoring technologies.

F

Seismic to exploration well target
selection calls for new geobody model
In 2001, RIL awarded the first 3D
seismic survey on the KG-D6 block to
Schlumberger’s WesternGeco business
unit, whose state-of-the-art vessel Geco
Eagle acquired some 463 miles2 of seismic data, which revealed several areas of
interest for possible subsequent drilling.
The processing of this initial survey identified a reservoir of interest among what
was described as a very laminated and
sinuous body of channel-fan complexes
stacked together to a gross thickness of
some 1,150 ft.
Reliance needed a new approach to
capture the exact vertical extent of the
channel-levee complex to delineate the
reservoir and estimate volumetrics more
accurately.
Reservoir modeling experts with
Schlumberger Information Solutions
(SIS) joined in a multidisciplinary team
effort with RIL geologists, geophysicists
and reservoir engineers in designing a
new, more reliable geobody interpretation workflow program using SIS’ Petrel*
seismic-to-simulation software for representing reservoir features.
The advanced Petrel technology
provided the team with a single, integrated platform from which to execute
a complete workflow. Additionally, the
software’s ability to incorporate data from

The Geco Eagle acquired over 400 miles2 of seismic data over the KG-D6 block.
various other analyses allowed the SISRIL team to include a detailed thin-bed
characterization and petrophysical analysis
from core data in a new reservoir model.
Using Petrel’s geobody extraction tool
allowed the team to complete the complex job in only about one-fifth of the time
typically required by conventional aerial
demarcation technology. Using Petrel
markedly increased the effectiveness of
the team’s ability to model the reservoir
and compute volumetric estimates.

Safe, efficient well LWD
From the beginning, RIL’s main objectives
at the Dhirubhai project were safe drilling and accurate formation evaluation.
Operating in a region widely known for
its extremely hostile weather conditions,
including frequent tropical cyclones
(typhoons) with winds of more than 100
mph, waves of up to 65 ft. (20 m) and
subsea currents of more than 4 knots,
the KG-D6 drilling posed challenges for
even the three all ocean-rated, dynamically positioned drillships used for drilling

and completions. What’s more, once drilling began, Reliance faced challenges in
acquiring log data in an area where wells
had never before been drilled.
Anticipating a long line of similar challenges, the company took special care
in choosing its project stakeholders. For
the drilling and measurements (D&M)
and wireline (REW) work, RIL again
chose Schlumberger.
Once drilling began, Schlumberger
and RIL collaborated in using drilling
performance measurements made
with LWD tools to enhance drilling performance and safety. Combining LWD
data both in the field and in off-site planning centers allowed the drilling team
to highlight formation attributes. It also
helped them to identify crucial problem
areas for which drilling engineers were
able to take real-time corrective drilling
measures, if necessary. Using real-time
caliper data, for example, revealed hole
shape and condition, thus making it easier to evaluate formations and to make
appropriate completion decisions.

Schlumberger provided a full suite of
LWD logs, including real-time caliper and
the company’s adnVISION* azimuthal
density neutron service for real-time
neutron porosity, formation bulk density
and photoelectric factor data to characterize formation porosity and lithology
while drilling, identifying and quantifying
potential pay zones.
Particularly useful during LWD operations was the use of the EcoScope* multifunctional LWD service, which integrates
a full suite of data formation evaluation in
one compact single 26 ft. collar. Use of
this service reduced the risk often associated with the multiple collars necessary
for conventional triple combo logs in vertical well sections. In addition to resistivity,

turbidite sequences, many layers are
thinner – in the millimeter range – than
the vertical resolution of conventional
wireline-conveyed induction logging tools,
which have a minimum 1-ft (0.3-m) resolution, and even less than the 1.2-in. (3-cm)
vertical resolution of typical porosity tools.
Certain HG-D6 wells were deviated to the extent that gravity decent
wireline logging would not work. Pipe
conveyed logging was chosen rather
than LWD.
One such critical tool to deliver
understanding of the laminated sections was the OBMI* oil-base microimager tool. This expanded the drilling
team’s understanding of the distribution
of the thin beds and a more accurate
sand count. In addition the vertical seismic imaging tool (VSI) enhanced the

. CHLUMBERGER

The EcoView* answer product assists in the
analysis of the comprehensive data suite
from the EcoScope service.

Additionally, the drilling team employed
Schlumberger’s InterACT* real-time
monitoring and data delivery system to
transmit well data from drilling locations
to reservoir engineers’ desktops at RIL’s
headquarters in Mumbai, as well as to
those in the Schlumberger network of
Operation Support Centers. These centers have experts who monitor drilling
operations in real time, 24/7. Using a
standard Web browser and intranet connections, InterACT helped to enhance
the collaborative abilities of both well
site and off-well site specialists in India
and elsewhere around the world to
leverage their decision making, enabling
RIL to focus multiple, disparate and
specialized resources on both individual
wells and, subsequently, well clusters.
As identified by the LWD service, the
formation of interest in KG-D6 is comprised of massive sands interspersed
with a significant number of thin beds.
So, the drilling team combined resistivity data from LWD with those recorded
by Schlumberger’s wireline-conveyed
HRLA* high-resolution lateralog array
tool in combination with the rugged
PLATFORM EXPRESS* logging system.

InterAct carries well data globally

New logging technology identifies
additional reserves
In vertical wells with thick, homogeneous
horizontal beds, standard resistivity logging tools like the AIT array induction
imager tool deliver satisfactory data. In
some KG-D6 wells, however, gas contained in laminated sand-shale sequences
might have been overlooked due to the
effects of anisotropy, where the thin beds
all exhibit higher and/or lower resistivities,
i.e. where conductivity in one direction
– say, parallel to one
layer – differs from
that in another direction – say perpendicular to an adjacent
layer. What’s more, in

Also included in the open-hole wireline
logging tool combinations employed were
the Rt Scanner* triaxial induction service,
the Sonic Scanner*acoustic scanning platform and the PressureXpress* (XPT) reservoir pressure while logging tool selected
because they were judged to deliver the
required data in the most efficient manner.
For a deeper understanding of the
true resistivity of the laminated pay
sections, the Rt Scanner triaxial induction service, which measures formation
resistivity both perpendicular and parallel
to the direction of the laminated silt-sand
layers (Rv and Rh, respectively) was
utilized. (Note: The tool also provides

traditional AIT type measurements.)
Taking measurements at multiple
depths of investigation in three dimensions provided a true 3-D resistivity
map. The enhanced hydrocarbon and
water saturation estimates computed
from these measurements resulted in a
more accurate reservoir model and finer
reserves estimates, particularly for the
laminated, anisotropic formations.
Reservoir summation results derived
by the Rt Scanner demonstrated that for
the complete logged intervals, net pay
thickness value was 1.35 times higher
than that produced by the basic AIT tool.
Additionally, the Rt Scanner-derived net
pay hydrocarbon porosity thickness was
1.55 times larger than that of the corresponding AIT, which translated to a
700% additional net pay.

Single-pass sonic tool delivers quick
formation evaluation
During drilling certain borehole sections
exhibited radial plastic yielding caused
by stress concentrations resulting in
drilling-induced damages. Wireline formation pressure and sampling testing
of such intervals resulted in lost seals or
tight pre-tests. This increased the time
to realize successful pressure and fluid
samples at a cost proportional to expensive rig spread rates, far greater than the
cost of the service itself.
To evaluate the formation alteration
in subsequent, similar well intervals,
RIL employed Schlumberger’s Sonic
Scanner tool to evaluate both far field
and near field slowness. Unlike other
sonic tools, which
deliver mostly near
wellbore data, the
Sonic Scanner
also is capable of
measuring deep
formation slowness at varying
radial depths. The

enables it to be fired in either pulse or

using the Sonic Scanner aided the RILSchlumberger drilling team in denoting

nonproductive rig time. The tool also
proved beneficial for evaluating radial
acoustic behavior behind cemented casing intervals.

tester, coupled with a dual packer, interval pressure transient testing tool – and
integrating them into a single-well predictive model (SWPM) analysis to determine
formation parameters and estimate well
deliverability. InterACT real-time monitoring was used to transmit the test data to
RIL engineers in Mumbai.
The interval pressure transient
tests were conducted using the MDT’s
straddle packer system. The transient
sequences consisted of single or
multiple flow periods induced using a
downhole pump, followed by periods of
pressure buildup. The results were then
used for the numerical single-well model
to predict the commingled deliverability
of several layers.
The success of single-well simulation
and commingled approach allowed RIL
to forecast absolute open flow potential
(AOFP) for multiple zones. Well deliverability estimates were included using
production tubular and choke information in the simulation model. According
to RIL, this approach resulted in significant savings in rig time/cost by providing productivity estimates and AOFP
without having to resort to conventional
four-point deliverability tests.
In addition to the MDT sampling
program, RIL also responded enthusiastically to the use in specific cases of

Schlumberger’s PressureXpress reservoir pressure measurement tool for both
lower and higher mobility sands of up to
> 500 md/cp.

More drilling, seismic further
expands KG-D6 play
After drilling and testing the initial wells,
RIL chose WesternGeco to conduct a
detailed, 3D seismic survey over the
most promising areas covering some
1,120 miles2 in the KG-D6 acreage.
The high quality of the data lead to a
detailed seismic attribute interpretation;
and 12 of 13 exploration wells hit the
target structure and found commercial
hydrocarbons.
Meanwhile, WesternGeco returned
to the block for the third time, in this
instance to acquire 875 miles2 of 3D data,
to cover the complete block concession
with 3D data. This was done mainly to
identify the presence of geological features similar to those in which discoveries
already had been drilled, and to determine whether it was justifiable to declare
the entire block as a discovery area.
In view of the resulting significantly higher hydrocarbon potential,
coupled with a growing deficit in India’s
projected natural gas supply for the
immediate future, RIL in 2006 obtained
government approval to double its daily
KG-D6 gas production and to enhance
facilities for production, collection
and handling of gas both offshore and
onshore. A revised estimate of capital
expenditures for the enhanced production profile rose to about US$5.2 billion.
Part of the new spending for development of Dhirubhai 1 and 3 included
the need for special/advanced pro-

Live well operations performed safely
from a dynamically positioned vessel
For field development, RIL elected to
drill and complete 18 strategically placed
subsea production wells in the two
KG-D6 gas fields and in the adjacent MA
oil field, each well equipped with dual
open hole gravel pack completions. Early
production data would be used to delineate the reservoir and define connectivity and compartmentalization. Petrel was
used to demarcate the geobodies.
The wells were batch drilled, with
one drillship doing the lower completion
and a second following behind for the
upper completion. However, a major
issue was how to conduct the live well
operations safely from a dynamically
positioned vessel with the added risk

SenTURIAN subsea landing string electrohydraulic operating system

job-specific customization. It is designed
to operate from dynamically positioned
vessels in all subsea applications,
including deepwater and HPHT wells, in
waters as deep as 15,000 ft.
SenTURIAN is the first landing string
system to use interchangeable mandrels
and pressure-balanced accumulators.
This allows both subsea control and
accumulator modules to be combined in
a single assembly, which is 50% shorter
than other systems, while providing
the tensile strength, pressure rating,
and hydraulic output needed for the full
range of water depths. The operating
system has programmable emergency
shutdown levels that can be configured
to close all subsea test tree valves to
shut in a well and unlatch the landing
string in less than 15 seconds.

Reservoir illumination without
intervention
Because of reservoir uncertainties
with respect to zonal contribution and
inter-well connectivity, RIL called for an
advanced measurement system to be
permanently installed along the sandface of six of their wells. This system
would supply real-time temperature
and pressure data as well as an array
temperature profile to be used for flowprofiling, tracking depletion, identifying
water breakthrough, and making other
critical production and reservoir evaluations. This system would provide an
extra dimension to the pressure interference testing traditionally used to map
out connectivity, which was to be used
in the remaining 12 wells drilled.
To deliver on this requirement,
Schlumberger deployed its new
WellWatcher Flux* digital sensor array
system in the six designated wells with
the goal of establishing a complete
real-time communication chain from the
sandface to the RIL offices in Mumbai.
Integrated into the completion, the
WellWatcher Flux system is designed
to transmit data via a unique inductive
coupler that links sensors on the gravelpack to traditional permanent gauge
hardware on the upper completion. The
sensors are miniaturized, high-resolution, platinum resistance temperature
devices located inside a small housing.

of severe monsoon weather conditions.
The subsea landing string system incorporating SenTREE* 7 subsea test tree
and SenTURIAN* electrohydraulic operating system provided the solution for
efficient and safe access to the dynamic
reservoir parameters. Schlumberger has
been providing subsea landing string
services for over 35 years, and the evolution continued on this project with the
first application of SenTURIAN.
Schlumberger introduced the
SenTURIAN subsea landing string electrohydraulic operating system on this
project to deliver reliable subsea well
control, with an emphasis on improved
offshore operating efficiency. It is the
world’s first and only in-riser system
design and certified in accordance
with the International Electrotechnical
Commission’s IEC 61508 SIL 2 reliability
specifications for safety-related systems. It features an innovative, modular
system that is much simpler to operate
and smaller than comparable systems,
allowing rig-time savings of as much
as 50% during handling under certain
circumstances. The modularity of the
system’s design also makes it ideal for

cessing and interpretation of already
acquired seismic data, as well obtaining still more 3D data. For the latter,
RIL decided to acquire high-resolution
Q-Marine* point-receiver 3D data – the
first time WesternGeco’s Q-Marine technology would be used off India.
RIL called for Q-Marine data acquisition with pre-processing onboard, followed by integrated onshore processing
and inversion of the acquired seismic
data to address some of the uncertainties in the reservoir description,
reserves estimation, and well target
selection and placement.
WesternGeco mobilized the Geco
Topaz for the job in 2007 to meet not
only the demanding geophysical challenges of the development survey but
also because the Q-Marine technology
she deployed enhanced the ability to
maneuver in and around a crowded field
of drillships, jackup rigs and host of support and survey vessels. The steerable
streamer technology made a significant
impact with minimum lost time and safe
passes, and, perhaps most importantly,
coverage of the entire survey area with
no gaps in data coverage.
Impressed with the completion of
the 170 mile2 survey ahead of time and
meeting their objective for the KG-D6
gas fields, RIL then decided to extend
the development survey to the 123mile2 MA oil field, which was promptly
completed in a similar fashion.

During manufacturing, according to
RIL specifications, between 15 and 25
sensors were welded to a continuous
control line to create a spoolable array for
each well. The arrays were designed to be
clamped along joints of each sandscreen
as they were run in hole. Splicing and
small depth adjustments could be made
to each array during deployment if that
proved necessary. The sensors measure
the completion temperature which, in
turn, is determined by the temperatures
of both the incoming and wellbore fluids.
The inductive coupling, through wireless, allows transmission of power from
the upper to the lower completion, as
well as communication between the
completion stages. Verification runs were
made before running the upper completion to check integrity of the formation
isolation valve, take a measurement of
geothermal temperature and, most importantly, verify good communication across
the inductive coupling. All six couplers
worked flawlessly according to Reliance.
Once the upper completion was landed,
activation of the subsea tree penetrator
brought the sandface data on line.

’Side Effects’ deliver even more data
With the surface test equipment in
place, the wells were cleaned up to
avoid any excess completion fluid being
passed into production facilities. The

sandface data showed each zone cleaning up as gas displaced the completion
fluid, generally progressing from the
top of the well downward. But in many
wells, the sandface data showed more
than that. Several of the wells showed
cross-flow before being put on line,
with some flowing from bottom to top,
others with zones flowing from top to
bottom, and data indicated from which
zone the flow crossed into the other.
The sandface and gauge data was
transmitted to Mumbai for real-time
visualization and analysis. Dedicated
THERMA* visualization/interpretation
software was used for 3D display of the
sandface data.
The power of the THERMA software
was demonstrated once the wells
were put online for production. Analysis
of the data from the first well equipped
with WellWatcher Flux data demonstrated that gas was being produced
across the extent of the sandface, with
no significant skin damage from invaded
completion fluid. A quantitative flow
profile was also obtained.
As other wells were put onto production, however, the sandface data showed
something even more interesting. The
data indicated that the cross-flow was not
just from one compartment to another,
but, often from one well to another. RIL
engineers complemented this information
with traditional pressure interference testing and have been able to use the crossflow information to update their geobody
descriptions in Petrel, significantly increasing their understanding of the compartments and connectivity across the reservoir. This information will be used to plan
the next phase of the production drainage.

Commitment to SE Asia
THERMA modeling and analysis software
derives flow profile information by combining WellWatcher Flux data with reservoir,
fluid, well and completion properties. It also
provides Flux data visualization, such as
this example from well A9 where the image
shows cold fluid ingress after opening formation isolation valve, heating as the well is
brought online, slight cooling progressively
from the top-down as the gas displaces
completion fluid, a stable production temperature and finally cooling back to geothermal
after the well is shut in.

According to joint RIL-Schlumberger
estimates, more than 10,000 offshore
and 80,000 onshore worker hours were
logged during the drilling and completion phase of the KG-D6 projects without lost-time or safety incidents.
Partly responsible for giving RILSchlumberger project teams the ability
to conduct drilling and completion activity safely, on time and on budget with
timely equipment arrival and utilization
has been the construction in 2007 of

Allseas’ Audacia installing a PLEM

The D1 & D3 gas development
project includes 18 wells in water
depths ranging from 600 m to 1200
m, connected to a deepwater pipeline
end manifold (DWPLEM) via cluster
manifolds through pipelines and infield
umbilicals. The gas from the DWPLEM
passes through a shallow water control
and riser platform (CRP) to the landfall
point (LFP), situated 5 km from the
onshore gas handling terminal.
Allseas engaged specialized subcontractors and formed various project
management teams at different sites all
around world. The turn-around cycle was
made swifter with RIL teams co-locating
with Allseas’ teams at multiple locations
for dynamic review and decision making.
Offshore installation and pre-commissioning was carried out from August
2007 until August 2009. The inclement
weather on India’s east coast reduced
an effective and fair weather window
for offshore installation to four months
(from mid December to mid April). A
state of the art fleet of installation vessels was mobilized to the site. The main
installation vessels Audacia, Lorelay,
Tog Mor and Express were supported
by more than 80 vessels and barges,
working in a limited area of 350 sq. km.
An effective vessel tracking system was
utilized for meticulous planning of all
vessel movements.

Allseas’ fleet in the Indian Ocean Lorelay, Calamity Jane and Audacia
The offshore facilities included
installation of 350 km of pipeline, 150
km of umbilicals, 11 subsea structures
(DWPLEM, manifolds, SDAs, UDH), 45
pipeline end terminations (PLETs), 29
anchor boxes and 56 jumpers. More than
200 subsea connections were executed.
On March 31, 2009, the loop test
of two 24-inch gas trunklines from the
DWPLEM to the onshore terminal was
successfully completed in order to establish the baseline integrity. On April 1, 2009,
the choke of the first well was opened.
With Allseas as one of the major
contractors, many records were set,
many milestones achieved and many
benchmarks established. This challenging project would not have been successful without the extra effort every
team member put in over the last three
years and absolute support and commitment from the top management of
Allseas and RIL.

imited initial knowledge of soil
conditions. Absence of onshore
logistical infrastructure. Hostile
seas with an annual construction
weather window of only four to
five months. Severe supply chain
constraints. Reads like a perfect recipe
for project delays and troublesome
operations, doesn’t it? On the contrary,
Aker Solutions, which clinched the two
challenging deepwater contracts: KG
D6 and MA D6 in the Bay of Bengal
India, has helped Reliance Industries
set the industry record for fast track
development. From discovery to first
gas, the KG Basin field development,
also known as D1/D3 field, has
been implemented in just 6.5 years,
significantly ahead of the average nineyear span needed for projects of similar
scale, whereas the MA D6 field, or
known as D26 had successfully brought
the first oil onshore in a record time of
just under two and a half years.

Integrated Turnkey Solution
For the D1/D3 gas field, Aker Solutions
has provided the complete subsea production system with 19 subsea trees,
six manifolds and associated systems,
including 180 kilometers of steel tube
umbilicals. For the D26 oil field, Aker
Solutions has provided the subsea production system, flexible risers, and its
first Smart FPSO solution with real-time
onshore monitoring. Aker Solutions
has also set up a service base in the
town of Kakinada to provide life-of-field
service support to both the D1/D3 and
D26 fields.

Dhirubhai I FPSO is positioned over the MA D6 subsea production system. The suezmax
tanker was converted to a Aker’s Smart FPSO with a processing capacity of 9 million cubic
meters of gas and 60,000 barrels of oil per day.

Total Team Effort
“Never has such a complex deepwater project been delivered quicker,”
explained Dave Hutchinson, Aker
Solutions’ President for Subsea Asia
Pacific, “The pace of the entire field
development is a testament to the fast

track approach Reliance has taken to
this project, and their ability to make
extremely fast decisions.”
Project Director Oddvar Byrne
described some of the ingredients
in the successes of Aker Solutions.

“We have a unique partnership with
Reliance. Both sides have kept the
same teams in place as much as possible from day one. Such relationships
are important – never underestimate
the value of continuity.”

called upon its resources in Norway,
U.K. and Asia Pacific. The KG Basin projects have been managed out of Aker
Solutions’ headquarters in Oslo, Norway
and the subsea equipment was manufactured at Tranby and Moss, Norway;
Aberdeen, U.K.; and the high-tech manufacturing center in Port Klang, Malaysia.

As the Aker Solutions team learned
more details about the virgin production
area, several design and procurement
changes had to be accommodated into
the tight development schedule, including strong currents, an uneven seabed
and low seabed water temperatures.
For example, the production risers were
initially designed for mild operating

Reliance Employs Baker Hughes Products,
Services for KG-D6 Development
Fast, yet safe operations plan calls for field-proven, new technologies

Company Profile .BAKER HUGHES

s a global market leader in the
supply of equipment for the
deepwater market sector, Baker
Hughes was pleased to be chosen as
one of the leading technology partners
for Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) in
development of the Dhirubhai 1 and
3 discoveries in India’s Bay of Bengal.
Baker Hughes took full advantage of
the opportunity to deliver best-in-class
products and services for one of the
largest and most complex endeavors in
Indian offshore petroleum history.
Supplying both its conventional tools
and services and several of its latest
technologies for drilling, formation evaluation, well completion and production,
Baker Hughes has been an essential
participant in bringing the first phases of
the Dhirubhai gas and oil development to
successful conclusion.
With the many challenges posed in
the development of discoveries in water
depths ranging between 2,297 to 5,577 ft
(700 to 1,700m), including the delineation
of producing reservoirs and placement of
wells and production facilities in an area
plagued by hostile weather, RIL was compelled to balance fast, but safe, drilling
with highly accurate formation evaluation
techniques. Due to its track record in deep
water, Baker Hughes was chosen among
RIL’s key service partners for the project.

A

Leading-edge drilling, logging
In addition to specifying the use of industry-leading drill bits from Baker Hughes
and optimum drilling and completion
fluid systems, RIL contracted a significant number of the company’s advanced
directional drilling and formation services.
These included the AutoTrak™ rotary
steerable directional drilling system, highperformance drilling motors, integrated
measurement-while-drilling / loggingwhile-drilling (MWD / LWD) drilling packages and high-pressure coring services.
RIL used Baker Hughes’ people and
services to precisely drill India’s first
deepwater multilateral wells, maintain-

ing accurate TVD control, and to drill the
deepest well in the project to a vertical
depth of 20,210 ft (6,282m).
The technology deployed on this
project for RIL included many of Baker
Hughes’ advanced LWD systems. The
SoundTrak™ acoustic LWD service, which
is integrated into the existing modular
tool, delivers advanced acoustic information allowing for the accurate prediction
of pore pressure and tie-in with the surface seismic. Also deployed for various
applications were the OnTrak™ system,
which is a compact integrated MWD-LWD
platform providing resistivity, gamma ray
and pressure readings very close to the
bit, and the LithoTrak™ service, providing
accurate borehole density and porosity
readings in real time. In addition to the formation evaluation services, Baker Hughes
deployed the CoPilot™ real-time drilling
optimization service, which allows the drill
crew to accurately understand downhole
conditions, so surface parameters can be
adjusted to optimize the drilling process.

Timely data, simple access
To tie field-specific data sets together for
decision-making, Baker Hughes also provided its RigLink™ Web-based communications system to keep RIL engineers
and geoscientists informed with real-time
drilling data. The system made secure,
current data from multiple rigsites available to RIL personnel both at the wellsite
and at data centers on shore. Using
RigLink’s display and reporting package, RIL was able to streamline internal
work processes, allowing both rig-based
personnel and onshore experts to view
critical data in real time. Additionally, RIL
users could program RigLink to notify
them whenever certain operations or
drilling parameters were met.

Imaging through OBM
While Baker Hughes provided much of
the drilling and MWD-LWD technology for
the project, they also participated in logging and completing KG-D6 wells.

Among wireline services, RIL chose
to apply the company’s EARTH Imager™
resistivity imager. Using advanced electrical conductivity measurements for oilbased mud systems (OBM), the EARTH
Imager service provides high-resolution
image logs of a quality previously available
only in water-based mud systems. These
high-resolution images were crucial in the
thinly bedded geologies seen in the wells.
Also vital to RIL’s stated goal of fast
yet safe drilling and completion operations, the company applied the Baker
Hughes Reservoir Characterization
Instrument™ (RCI) in a large number of
wells. This system was crucial in supplying pressures and fluid samples from
the wells. The RCI provides an efficient,
cost-effective method for collecting
quality formation fluid samples with
minimal contamination and accurate
formation pressures without need for a
time-consuming drillstem test (DST).

Equalizing with inflow control
In the production and completions arena,
Baker Hughes played a key role in development of the KG-D6 MA oil field.
The oil wells were completed using the
EQUALIZER™ reservoir optimized completions system which, when combined with
the EXCLUDER2000™ premium mesh
screen technology, delivers superior sand
control. Additionally, the system features a
unique inflow-control device that helps to
extend longevity of production in long, low
drain-down, high flow rate horizontal wells
by delaying water or gas coning.
In addition to the EQUALIZER system,
Baker Hughes also provided liner hanger
services and was a major provider of
safety valves and service screens.

Geohazards and geoscience expertise
NGI (Norwegian Geotechnical Institute) was contracted by Reliance Industries Limited to undertake a regional geohazards
study for their KG D6 Block development. Geologically, this area is characterized by rapid sedimentation from the many
large river systems into the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal. The study was undertaken to assess potential unstable
conditions due to underwater sliding and other geohazards, to analyse the possibility of hazards to under water installations.

soil conditions, supplemented by site
specific geological and geotechnical
investigations. The work resulted in
alterations to pipeline routes in order to
minimize geohazard risks such as underwater sliding. The safety and soundness
of the planned development of the area
was also confirmed.

they were implemented in a single project
that was executed in a fast track mode.
The equipment included 10 risers in Pliant
Wave® configuration; risers connected to
an FPSO via a disconnectable turret buoy;
limited available riser top tension; and high
temperature flexible risers. All were successfully installed in water depths of more
than 3,900 ft (1,200m).

Up to six vessels worked simultaneously on the MA D6 field during the company’s activities. Technip’s main construction
vessel for the MA D6 installation project
was the Deep Constructor, which was
utilized for all of the lines and suction piles.
The company also utilized its DSV Skandi
Achiever for the saturation diving work, additional light construction work and surveys.

n early 2007, the Technip Group
was awarded the contract for the
supply of flexible risers and flowlines
for the fast track development of
Reliance Industries’ MA D6 field.
Additionally, the company was awarded
a separate contract for the engineering,
transportation, installation and precommissioning of the flexible risers
and flowlines and the umbilicals
free issued by the client. Several
challenges were presented to Technip
due to the fast track development. All
were successfully met despite some
formidable obstacles.
Among the project’s challenges were:
• The first batch of 14 km flexible pipe
had to be designed and manufactured in less than 12 months;
• Functional specifications during the
initial phase of the project;
• Restricted turret buoy capacity that
required a “wave” configuration for the
risers with about 150 buoyancy modules per riser to limit their top tension;
• Design and fabrication of a state-ofthe-art 60 ton subsea pulling winch
installed on a submerged buoy and
operated by divers in saturation at
depths between 200-328 ft (60-100 m);
• Potentially strong ocean currents
during riser installation and diving
operations and limited weather
window;
• A 42 ft (13 m) long dynamic umbilical bending stiffener assembly, the
largest and heaviest assembly ever
attached to a light umbilical.
Only 17 months elapsed between
the contract award and the completion
of the Phase 1 work scope by Technip.
All of the typical preparatory phases of
the project were conducted simultaneously rather than sequentially in order
to integrate all of the technical data and
specifications that were progressively
made available to the project team.
While many of the technologies utilized
in this project have been applied in other
deepwater subsea developments, the MA
D6 development was the first time that

deepwater development in India

Technip supplied MA D6 field’s flexible risers and flowlines. The company also was
contracted for engineering, transportation, installation and pre-commissioning of the
risers and flowline. The equipment included 10 risers in Pliant Wave configuration.
Technip’s scope of work on the MA D6
Phases 1 and 2 included the fabrication
and installation of 31 km of flexible risers
and flow lines. The contract called for four
8-in. gas export risers, four 8-in. production risers, one 6-in. gas injection riser and
six 6-in. production jumpers. Additionally,
Technip installed the 170 ton gas export
manifold and its130 ton suction anchor
foundation as well as the single dynamic
umbilical and eight infield umbilicals.
During Phase 1 riser connection operations, Technip pulled in and connected
four risers to the disconnectable STP
buoy in a water depth of approximately
500 ft (150m). During Phase 2, the company configured the heading control of
the FPSO with two tugs and the direct
pull in, connection and precommisioning
of six risers. Total shutdown of the FPSO
during the riser connection operation
was less than four weeks.

The Skandi Achiever was also outfitted with
laying winches as a backup to the Deep
Constructor for installation of the flexible
flowlines and jumpers. Additionally, Technip
used two heavy lift vessels to transport ten
flexible reels, the dynamic umbilical carousel, three static umbilical reels, the suction
piles and all of the riser buoyancy modules
from Europe. Total weight of this equipment
was more than 5,000 tons.
Technip successfully completed this
fast track deepwater project thanks to
the experience and expertise of its fully
integrated and dedicated project team.

oised to vault India into the
league of economic superpowers,
Krishna Godavari Dhirubhai 6
(KGD6) is at once a benchmark in the
petroleum industry and an architectural
landmark. For the main gas extraction
and distribution point on the East coast
of India, Architectural and Engineering
firm Venkataramanan Associates’ (VA)
design brief described an integration
of functionality and infrastructure with
aesthetic appeal and local flavour.
The Onshore Terminal and
Infrastructure Area, both comprising
several operational sections, are linked
visually and functionally by an overpass.
Closest to the Infrastructure entrance,
the Administration & Learning Block
hosts the Business Center and offices
for RIL’s senior management and faculty.
The block also comprises training and
multi-purpose areas as well as a stateof-the-art auditorium. In keeping with
RIL’s ethos, the offices for senior management on the top floor are elegant
and emphasize a flat organization.
The minimalist design of the building exteriors is exemplified in the
simple lines and colonnade design of
the Pipeline Control Center. Following
the same design sense, the Operations
office also takes full advantage of the
intensity of the sun in the region. Lit by
sunlight through the day, it is softened
by lush landscape that surrounds the
structure while a pebble court inside
forms a relaxing break-out space in the
midst of continually running operations.
The Food Court, inspired by RIL’s logo,
has the most unique design on campus.
As the logo cradles a flame, the Food
Court creates a space of comfort for the
employees on campus. The Recreation
Building close by comprises a badminton
court, an auditorium and a gym apart
from several other activity spaces, also
for the employees. The structure’s design
serves to draw the eye towards the

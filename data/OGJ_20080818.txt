COVER
Completing a well involves setting casing, finishing the reservoir section, installing downhole “jewelry,” and installing the wellhead.This
week’s special report, Completion Methods, begins on p. 48 with an
article about Shell’s optimized well completions in Pinedale gas field,
western Wyoming.The cover photo by Nina M. Rach shows wellheads
on Shell’s Mesa 29B pad at Pinedale. Straddle packers offer a way
to isolate production or injection zones above or below the packers.
The second article in the special, beginning on p. 54, provides two
examples of North Sea completions and one off Brazil to illustrate the
use of straddle packers. Above, the header shows resin-coated proppant,
perforations, and stylized fracture zone (image from Hexion).

GE
Oil & Gas

Depth:
it’s genetic

It starts with the right people and it ends with the
right solution. GE’s people have been pushing offshore
and subsea technology boundaries for more than
50 years. We have a long line of industry milestones,
including more than a decade of design and operational
experience with Troll C, the ﬁrst commercially scaled
pilot subsea separation system, and the Ormen Lange
subsea compressor designed for reliable unattended
operation 900 m below sea level, with power up to
20 MW. We continue investing heavily to further advance
technologies for subsea applications, providing one
seamless package for separation, power, boosting,
compression and controls. This strategy helped set the
current world record for water depth drilling (3,051 m)
achieved using a combination of our VetcoGray and
Hydril Pressure Control technologies. To some, deep
water is an obstacle. To us, it’s an opportunity.
Technological depth – it’s in our DNA.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Chavez further expands PDVSA’s role in economy

workers in Brazil, has decided to cancel a strike against state-owned
Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) originally planned to begin on
Aug. 5 (OGJ Online, Aug. 4, 2008).
Workers originally called for the strike in an effort to win payment from Petrobras for the time they spend traveling from their
platforms. The workers, who work 14 days on platforms and then
have 21 days off, wanted Petrobras to count the 15th day—spent in
transit—as a working day.
The union agreed to call off its planned strike after Petrobras
offered to count the 15th day as half-time and also make it retroactive to 2005.
A 5-day strike by the platform workers over the same demand
caused Petrobras to lose some 63,000 b/d of production in the
Campos basin in mid-July. It is the second time in a week that
Petrobras has been able to avert potentially disruptive labor actions
by its workers.
Earlier, the Federacion Unica de Petroleros called off its nationwide strike—planned for Aug. 5—after Petrobras agreed to meet
the demands of the workers for increased profit-sharing. In an effort to avert the nationwide strike, Petrobras agreed to raise the
amount of profit shared with workers to 15% from 13%. It also

The Sindipetro-NF union, which represents oil and gas platform part were given largely to managers and high-level executives. ✦

Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, as part of a wider set of reforms for his country, has decreed changes to the statutes of stateowned Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA).
According to a copy of the Official Gazette, Chavez has given
PDVSA the responsibility of “participating in ventures intended for
the sustained, organic, and integral development of the country,
including agricultural [and] industrial activities.”
The changes, which purportedly aim at integrating the oil and
gas industry more closely with other sectors of the national economy, also free members of the PDVSA board to actively participate
in political activities—subject to Chavez’s approval.
The new decree is in line with similar efforts by Chavez last year
to expand the role of the state oil company. At the time, PDVSA created a series of units that included a construction company and an
agricultural business unit, among others.
The decree is part of 26 new laws approved by Chavez on July
31, when the 18-month decree powers bestowed on him by Congress were set to expire. The powers enabled Chavez to issue decrees without any input from the legislature.

Development

Petrobras ﬁnds oil with Iara well off Brazil
A consortium comprised of Brazil’s state-owned Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras), BG Group, and Galp Energia has made an oil
discovery on Block BM-S-11 in the presalt layers of the Santos basin
off Brazil.
The 1-BRSA-618-RJS discovery well, informally know as Iara,
was drilled 230 km off Rio de Janeiro in 2,230 m of water.
Petrobras said the discovery was proved by “a light oil sampling
collected via a cable test carried out in reservoirs at a depth of
5,600 m.” The well, which yielded oil of 30° gravity, is still being
drilled in search of deeper prospects.
Petrobras, operator, holds a 65% stake in the consortium, while
BG holds 25% and Galp 10%.

BG makes oil ﬁnd in Norwegian North Sea
BG Norge AS has reported finding oil in exploration well 34/3-1
S in the Norwegian North Sea.
The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) said the well was
drilled on production license 373 S and reached a total vertical
depth of 4,057 m below sea level. Oil was discovered in a Jurassic
reservoir, and the well was completed in the Triassic.
The well is northeast of StatoilHydro’s Snorre field. “A com-

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

prehensive data acquisition program has been carried out. The resource potential will now be evaluated with a sidetrack,” the NPD
added.
Dolphin AS’s Bredford Dolphin semisubmersible rig drilled the
well in water 410 m deep. Production license 373 S was awarded
in the 2005 Awards in Predefined Areas licensing round.
The well will be permanently plugged and abandoned once the
sidetrack is completed. The rig will then move to PL 338 and drill
appraisal well 16/1-8 for Lundin Petroleum.

VNG gains acreage in Norway
Verbundnetz (VNG) Gas AG has agreed to buy shares of three
production licenses off central Norway that are held and operated
by Norway’s DNO AS.
The deal requires Norwegian authority approval before it becomes effective starting from Jan. 1.
VNG Norge will acquire a 30% interest each in Fongen (PL
380) and Struten (PL 383). An exploration well is expected to be
drilled on each license in 2009. VNG has agreed to carry 30% of
DNO’s drilling cost related to the two wells.
DNO also has sold a 20% interest in the Litjormen prospect
(PL 447) to VNG, reducing its ownership from 50% to 30%. DNO

DON’T GET CAUGHT UP THE CREEK WITH JUST

ONE

PADDLE.

If you rely on one set of data, it’s like trying
to row a boat with only one paddle. You’ll get
somewhere, but maybe not in the direction
you want to go. That’s especially true with
estimated data. If you use just one set you’re
not seeing the whole picture. By subscribing
to API’s Weekly Statistical Bulletin you’ll be
able to compare all the data and set a course
for better decision-making. And that ought
to float your boat.

ExxonMobil brings Kizomba C on production
ExxonMobil Corp. has begun oil production from Saxi and
Batuque fields, which are part of the Kizomba C development project on Block 15 off Angola.
Production from the two fields, along with Mondo, which started production in January, is expected to reach 200,000 b/d later
this year. Output from Block 15 will be 700,000 b/d when Saxi
and Batuque fields reach peak production, ExxonMobil said.
Oil is produced via two floating production, storage, and offloading vessels and 36 subsea wells. It is the largest subsea development operated by ExxonMobil worldwide.
The twin Kizomba C FPSOs are the fourth and fifth production centers on Block 15, following Kizomba (2003), Kizomba A
(2004), and Kizomba B (2005).
It is estimated that Kizomba C will produce 600 million bbl of
oil over its lifespan.
StatoilHydro, a partner in the development, described Angola
as a key building block for its international production growth. So
far its nine producing fields contribute more than 200,000 b/d of
equity production. It holds a 13.33% stake in Block 15.
Block 15 is operated by ExxonMobil, holding a 40% stake. Angola’s state-owned Sonangol is concessionaire.

Jubilee ﬁeld partners lease FPSO from MODEC

Tullow Ghana Ltd., operator of Jubilee oil field off Ghana, has
signed a 7-year lease agreement in which Tokyo-based Mitsui
Ocean Development & Engineering Co. Ltd. (MODEC) will provide
and operate the floating production, storage, and offloading vessel
for Jubilee field. The contract includes 13 1-year options, with the
FPSO designed to remain in the field for as long as 20 years.
Jubilee, one of the largest oil fields discovered off West Africa
in the past 10 years, is estimated with 90% probability to hold
170 million bbl of recoverable oil. However its suggested upside
could be as much as 1.8 billion bbl of oil, Tullow reported following recent drillstem tests in two oil-bearing zones from the field’s
Mahogony-2 appraisal well (OGJ Online, July 16, 2008).
The tests indicate that a Jubilee production well should produce
more than 20,000 b/d of 36-39° gravity oil, Tullow said. Initial
field production is expected in 2010.
MODEC will install the FPSO in 1,100 m of water as part of
the first phase of Jubilee’s development plant. The FPSO will have
the capacity to process more than 120,000 b/d of oil and to inject
more than 230,000 b/d of water and 160 MMscfd of gas.

the full expansion is completed in 2010, the refinery’s current production of about 1 million gpd of gasoline will increase
to about 1.5 million gpd, and diesel production will increase to
nearly 1 million gpd from about 750,000 gpd.

PetroChina Sichuan Petrochemical Co. Ltd. (PCSP) has selected the Unipol polypropylene (PP) process technology from Dow
Technology Licensing for its new 450,000 tonnes/year PP facility
at Chengdu, capital city of Southwest China’s Sichuan province.
Aker Process BV, a wholly owned subsidiary of Aker Solutions
ASA, Oslo, will carry out process design and technical advisory
services.
When completed and on stream in 2010, the PCSP facility will
be one of the largest single-train PP facilities in China, a part of
PCSP’s 800,000-tpy ethylene complex at Chengdu, the largest in
Southwest China.
With this facility and others under construction at Fushun in
Liaoning province and at QinZhou in GuangXi province, PCSP will
have nearly 1 million tonnes of PP capacity available using the Unipol PP technology. Aker Solutions was awarded the contracts for
basic engineering design and technical advisory services for each
of the three plants.
The PCSP license agreement includes production capability for
a broad range of PP resins, including homopolymers, random copolymers, and impact copolymers for various grades of plastics,
Dow said.
When this plant and others currently in the execution stage enter service, Unipol PP technology will be used to produce nearly
11 million tpy of PP, which will represent more than 16% of total
global capacity.

Valero breaks ground on Port Arthur expansion
Valero Energy Corp. broke ground Aug. 13 on a $2.4 billion
expansion project at its 325,000-b/d refinery in Port Arthur,
Tex.
The project, which includes the construction of a 50,000-b/d
hydrocracker and 45,000-b/d coker, will increase the refinery’s
crude distillation capacity to 415,000 b/d.
“The Port Arthur expansion project emphasizes ultralow-sulfur
diesel production, reflecting the significant projected growth in
demand for diesel both in the US and around the world,” said
Bill Klesse, Valero chairman and chief executive officer, in a press
release earlier this year.
The expansion is the company’s largest-ever capital investment
project. Valero expects the hydrocracker project to finish in fourthquarter 2010 and the coker project to finish in second-quarter
2011.
Contracts have been awarded to Fluor Corp. for the hydrocracker
project (OGJ Online, Aug. 7, 2008) and Technip for two processing
units—a saturate gas recovery unit and an amine treating unit—
and offsites work associated with the refinery expansion.

Is CP worthless?

What kind of question is this?
Most in the pipeline industry
agree that cathodic protection
(CP) is the smart way to provide
backup corrosion protection on
underground pipelines.
But consider: If you use solid film
backed corrosion coatings, you may
be wasting money by adding CP to
the pipeline.
There is a common sense reason for
this statement. CP systems protect
pipelines by delivering electrical
current to the steel surface. Solid
film back corrosion coatings have
the property of resistivity, which
means they block electrical current.
This blocking effect is called
cathodic shielding.
The phenomenon of cathodic
shielding, or blocking of protective
CP current, has been the subject of
dozens of technical papers since the
mid 1980’s. You can review a cross
section of these papers on
Polyguard’s website.You can also

Phone: (1) 214.515.5000
www.polyguardproducts.com

view a 10 minute explanation of the
cathodic shielding process.
Worldwide, we estimate that over
half of pipelines are being coated
with solid film back coatings, such as
shrink sleeves, tapes, and 2 or 3 layer
systems. Most of these lines have CP
systems. These are the operators who
may be wasting their money on CP.
Moreover, many install shielding
coatings on girth welds, the most
vulnerable area for corrosion.
Two corrosion coatings are proven
to be non-shielding, and allow
passage of protective CP currents.
One of these coatings is FBE. The
other is Polyguard RD-6.
NACE SP0169-2007 states: “Materials
… that create electrical shielding
should not be used on the pipeline” 1.
49 CFR §192.461 states:
“External protective coating …must
…have properties compatible with any
supplemental cathodic protection.” 2

If you are concerned that your
organization is behind this curve, we
recommend:
1. Visit
polyguardproducts.com/failsafecoating.htm
and review the large body of information
about shielding problems.
2. Talk to operators who have used
Polyguard’s RD-6 system. (There are
many) Ask them if they know of any
serious corrosion or SCC ever found
under RD-6. (We don’t, even after 19
years and thousands of installations).
3. Have someone in your organization attend
the NACE course “Coatings in Conjunction
with Cathodic Protection”.

Corrosion on Underground or Submergeed
Metallic Piping Systems”.

fall and is expected to take 18 months to complete, the company
said.
Flint Hills’s Corpus Christi complex is among the nation’s lowest-emitting refineries. Latest data indicate air emissions of commonly regulated substances of 0.09 lb/bbl of oil refining capacity.
The industry average is 0.19 lb/bbl of refining capacity.
The West Plant, which included a petrochemicals production
operation, was purchased from Sun Oil Co. in 1981 and later combined with the adjacent Gulf States refinery, purchased a year later.
In 1994, the $250 million midplant refining complex was completed with a capacity to process 150,000 b/d of crude oil. KerrMcGee Corp.’s Southwestern Refinery on Nueces Bay Blvd. (now
known as the East Plant) was acquired in 1995, and the complexes
are operated as one refining and chemicals complex because of the
addition of a state-of-the-art Central Control Center and pipelines
connecting both facilities.
In 2001, the company began producing low-sulfur gasoline following a $32 million project. In 2002, the company spent an additional $145 million on projects that further increased the amounts
of low-sulfur fuels produced and marketed.

Since 2002 Flint Hills has completed capital expansions and acquisitions worth more than $3 billion.

BP outlines cellulosic ethanol plans
BP PLC announced plans to invest $90 million in Verenium
Corp. to accelerate the development and commercialization of cellulosic ethanol.
Verenium of Cambridge, Mass., will receive the investment
from BP over the next 18 months for rights to current and future
technology held within the partnership.
BP Biofuels North America said Verenium already has demonstrated an advanced technology for cellulosic ethanol production.
Verenium recently opened a demonstration plant in Jennings, La.
BP and Verenium formed a special purpose entity (SPE) equally
owned by the two. The SPE will serve as the licensing entity for cellulosic ethanol production.
Beyond the initial phase of this alliance, the companies expect
to later form a joint venture. While the JV primarily will focus on
US plants, the SPE technologies might be licensable to third-party
commercial projects. ✦

FERC approves Midcontinent Express pipeline

chose not to appeal. It then decided to drop its plans after withdrawing its application with the federal government in early June.
In its filing with the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
Sound Energy Solutions said it was forced to withdraw its proposal
after Long Beach harbor commissioners ended an environmental
review on the project. Since then, Mitsubishi signed an agreement
with the Alaska Gasline Port Authority (AGPA) to develop an LNG
project in southern Alaska aimed at shipping Alaska North Slope
gas to the Lower 48.
Under terms of the agreement announced June 20, Mitsubishi
will work with the port authority in developing a spur pipeline to
a gas liquefaction plant and export facility at Valdez, following the
existing trans-Alaska oil pipeline from a point east of Fairbanks
near Delta Junction (OGJ, Feb. 25, 2008, p. 32).
According to reports, Mitsubishi’s interest lies in the liquefaction, transport, and marketing of LNG to Asia and possibly the US
West Coast in conjunction with Sempra LNG, a subsidiary of Sempra Energy, San Diego.
In July, AGPA announced that Sempra LNG, which has regasification facilities just below the US-Mexico border, also had joined

The Bengal pipeline system connects several refineries in southgovernment decided to freeze approval screening for the terminal.
Mitsubishi filed a lawsuit in response, but lost the case in April and ern Louisiana to the Plantation and Colonial pipeline systems. ✦
Midcontinent Express Pipeline, a joint venture of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP and Energy Transfer Partners LP, received
final US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval to construct its $1.27 billion Midcontinent Express gas pipeline (OGJ,
Feb. 18, 2008, Newsletter).
The 506-mile interstate system will deliver as much as 1.5 bcfd
of gas to customers in the southern and eastern US through 30-in.,
36-in., and 42-in. gas transmission pipeline in Oklahoma, northeastern Texas, northern Louisiana, central Mississippi, and Alabama.
The system also will include a 4.1-mile lateral in Louisiana and
other related facilities, including 111,420 hp of compression at
four new compressor stations and one booster station.
The pipeline is scheduled to be in service by early March 2009,
the companies reported. FERC also approved a certificate authorizing Enogex Inc. to lease as much as 272,000 bcfd of capacity on its
Oklahoma intrastate system to Midcontinent Express—a move that
had been contested by several other companies but which FERC
found not to be unduly discriminatory.

The ‘Twilight Zone’ challenge
energy needs for a full year.”
Great idea, Al. Now show us your
plans and specifications.

Sam Fletcher
Senior Writer
A 1963 episode of the popular television series, “The Twilight Zone,” told
of a rich executive who, with no new
business challenges to conquer, made a
deal with the Devil to return as a young
man to his childhood home in the late
19th Century and build his fortune
again with the hindsight of modern
knowledge.
He used the limited investment
funds allowed him to buy land he knew
would be a future oil field, then told
the sellers how he outsmarted them.
But they already knew about the oil;
they also knew it couldn’t be developed
with the cable-tool technology of that
day. Not to be thwarted, the executive approached a blacksmith with an
idea for building a rotary bit. “Sure,”
said the blacksmith, “just show me the
plans and specifications.” Having always
exploited other people’s abilities, the
executive couldn’t produce tools of the
future and returned to his own time as
a poor man.
That episode came to mind recently
when former Vice-President Al Gore
challenged the US to produce all of its
electricity “from renewable energy and
truly clean carbon-free sources” in just
10 years. “Enough wind power blows
through the Midwest corridor every day
to meet 100% of US electricity demand,” Gore said. “Enough solar energy

A sound energy policy
What’s this?
US fuel prices are plummeting while members
of Congress—aside from Republicans staying
behind to speak on energy in an empty House
chamber—are away on vacation.
How can this be? Haven’t lawmakers spent
months telling voters that they know the way to
relief, that they in fact wield the power to lower
gasoline prices?
Of course they have. They’re politicians. It’s an
election year. And their declarations of influence
over prices have been wrong, thoroughly and
dangerously wrong.
The market sets gasoline prices. Pretensions
to the contrary lead to mistaken policies, which
always hurt consumers.
The energy problem in the US is not that the
government hasn’t acted on energy. It’s that the
government has acted too much in ways that limit
supply. And the problem is not, as some observers
keep asserting, that the US has no energy policy. It
has a very discernible energy policy.

The US policy
The US energy policy as it relates to oil and gas
is to hoard crude in strategic storage, limit domestic production with land-use policy, stimulate
with tax policies and mandates the manufacture
and use of uncompetitive fuels, err on the side of
high fuel cost in environmental regulation, and
treat oil companies like criminal enterprises when
fuel prices rise. This is, in fact, a comprehensive
energy policy. It’s a poor one—but comprehensive,
nonetheless.
Energy policy is poor because much of it was
fashioned during a price-induced political uproar.
Hysteria seldom produces constructive policy in
any area, least of all energy. Yet energy receives
scant attention when oil prices are low. So 10 years
ago, when the initiative might have eased the price
pain of 2008, Congress didn’t expand federal oil
and gas leasing. Because oil prices were low, public
concern about future energy and the compulsion
to act were negligible.
When the market cycled away from a long
period of surplus earlier this decade, of course,
popular attention to energy returned with a
vengeance—literally—in response to the inevitable
price increases. Along with subsidies for uneconomic energy have come calls for special taxation
22

of oil companies, criminalization of “price gouging” during supply emergencies, and restrictions
on energy trading. These moves would hurt oil
consumers by constricting supply and bridling
the market. They’re the type of mistake consumers should expect when politicians feel urgent
pressure to act—to do something, anything—on
energy.
Policy in this area doesn’t have to be a spiral
of expensive mistakes. A sound energy policy is
not beyond hope. And the characteristics of such
a policy do not lie beyond the limits of popular
comprehension. They are, in fact, quite simple.
A sound energy policy relies to the maximum
possible extent on the market. It eschews fuel
selection by the government. It helps emergent
energy forms by preparing them to compete—
with research assistance, for example, and loan
guarantees—not by forcing them into the market
with mandates and subsidies, which can only hurt
them in the long run.
Because of its reliance on the market, a sound
energy policy imposes and rigorously enforces
antitrust and trading regulations.
A sound energy policy acknowledges the need
to expand supply from all energy sources that
make commercial sense and doesn’t orient itself to
the inevitably corrupt promotion of some sources
at the expense of others.
A sound energy policy works to reconcile the
imperatives of energy supply and environmental
protection.

Domestic supply
And a sound energy policy favors domestic supply over foreign supply as long as domestic supply
can compete. It does so less out of fear of foreign
supply, which the US will continue to need, than
from practical recognition of the manifold economic benefits of domestic production.
Obviously, implementation of sound energy
policy would require the reconsideration of recent
moves away from the market-based approach that
serves consumer and national interests best over
time. The current plunge in oil prices is discrediting many of the assertions underlying those
mistakes. Maybe it will enable politicians to calm
down and begin giving energy the rational treatment it needs. ✦

A carbon cap and trade system and
other initiatives to curb greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions will hurt the
petroleum industry overall but also
will create opportunities for some oil
companies to cash in, said officials at
Energy Policy Research Foundation Inc.
(EPRINC), Washington, DC.
Political momentum is building in
the US for legislative and regulatory
action to constrain
greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions.
“Some actions,
such as the mandating of large quantities of ethanol, may
have other purposes,
but their policy rationale in part is to
control GHGs. Others, such as cap and
trade, are directly aimed at curbing
these gases,” EPRINC reported.
The report acknowledged, “Climate
scientists have generally concluded that
the Earth has been warming and that
anthropomorphic activities, mainly
the combustion of fossil fuels, have
contributed to this warming. Though
there remains considerable uncertainty
regarding the magnitude of the anthropomorphic effect and only limited understanding of natural climate
variation, model projections indicate
that if current trends continue, there
are significant chances that the Earth
will experience a warming climate with
adverse consequences such as increased
numbers of severe weather events, rising sea levels, drought, and the spread
of tropical diseases.”

According to those scientists, annual
emissions rose to 28 billion tonnes
from 18 billion tonnes in 1980-2005
(Fig. 1). “Since carbon dioxide emissions represent better than three
quarters of worldwide GHG emissions,
the trend in GHG emissions is roughly
similar to that for CO2,” EPRINC said.
“The absolute level of GHGs increased
steadily in most years between 1990
and 2000 but has increased only
slightly since.” During 1990-2006, US
GHGs increased by 15% (Fig. 2).
“In the US, petroleum use generates
the most CO2, coal the next most, and
natural gas the least,” EPRINC reported.
CO2 emissions from all three sources
have trended upwards in the US since
1990. Yet despite that trend, the report
said, “The GHG intensity of US gross
domestic product has steadily dropped
since 1990 and is now more than 27%
below what it was in 1990.” During
2002-06, US GHG intensity dropped
almost 10 percentage points of the 18
percentage points that President George
W. Bush set as the national objective
through 2012.
The report argues that the US record
on curbing GHGs “has been as good or
better” than that of most other developed countries. But concern among
policy makers has grown with successive reports by the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change emphasizing
potential dangers of climate change.
“While questions about the science of
climate change are not fully settled,
there is growing sentiment both at the
national and state levels that strong,
binding measures are necessary to
curb increases in US GHGs and then to
reduce them,” EPRINC said.
As a result, legislators are pushing to reduce GHG through new laws
and regulations at the state and federal
levels. “It appears increasingly likely that
some will be promulgated or enacted
into law. Prominent among these is ‘cap
and trade,’ in which the nation’s GHG
emissions would be capped, allowances
to emit these gases given out or sold by
the government, and parties receiving
them allowed to transfer them in orgaOil & Gas Journal / Aug. 18, 2008

The 1,768-km BTC pipeline began operating in June 2006. It extends 443 km through
Azerbaijan, 249 km through Georgia, and
1,076 km through Turkey to the Ceyhan marine
terminal. Built at a cost of $4 billion, the BTC
pipeline is the ﬁrst direct transportation link

On Aug. 9, the Georgian government
said, “Russia air forces attacked the

main energy projects of the country.”
The government report claimed that
“28 out of 30 bombs exploded, with
some of them in the direct proximity to

Russian officials, who denied the
reports, said they had no intention of
targeting the pipelines but held open
the possibility of accidents interfering
with the lines’ operations.

Putin bullies
BP, Georgia

I

f anyone ever had any doubts
about Russian intentions regarding
the Caucasus as an energy bridge for
the West, those doubts should have
been laid to rest by now.
Before we start in on the violence
that racked Georgia, though, it might
do well to consider a sidebar that
took place in Moscow.
On Aug. 13, Robert Dudley, chief
executive officer of UK-Russian oil
company TNK-BP Ltd., was summoned to appear to appear before
Russian prosecutors for alleged violations of labor laws by his company.
Russia’s Federal Labor and Employment Service had asked a court
to look into a number of violations
relating to labor protection and the
use of a foreign work force at TNKBP.

TNK-BP under investigation
Last month, the service conducted
an investigation and found that
TNK-BP “had not complied with the
recommendations.” That prompted
the service to ask a court to look into
the case.
BP has been embroiled in a bitter dispute with its 50-50 Russian
partner in TNK-BP, a consortium of
Russian industrialists known as AAR,
who have been demanding Dudley’s
resignation amid speculation that BP
could be forced to give up its 50%
stake.
Is there any connection between
that little bit of bullying in Moscow
and the onslaught that took place in
Georgia last week?
It would not have been lost on
Russia’s chief bully, Vladimir Putin,
that BP decided to shut down its
three pipelines in the Caucasus. In

fact, as more than one observer has
noted, that shutdown was one of the
aims of Russia’s cross-border incursion into Georgia.

A variety of targets
BP, of course, is hardly the sole
target of Putin’s grand strategy. In that
regard, he has a number of plumper
targets in mind: Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan, just to name
a few.
These countries are the potentially
great producers of oil and natural
gas that Western governments are
counting on. Indeed, hopes have long
been high that these countries will be
ready, willing and able to provide the
West with reliable supplies of oil and
gas, bypassing Russia in the process.
BP, while hardly a government
entity, has played a major role in the
development and implementation
of that strategy—a matter that has
hardly gone unnoticed in Moscow.
The techniques Putin used to
bring Georgia to heel have the same
thuggish quality as the techniques he
has used to silence domestic opposition and to expropriate the energy assets of OAO Yukos, Royal Dutch Shell
PLC, and now, BP.
It’s all of a piece: Putin knows that
oil and gas fuel the West’s political
and economic preeminence as well as
Russia’s resurgence as a military and
economic power. By holding oil and
gas hostage, Putin can weaken his
enemies while strengthening himself.
When Russian bombs hit Georgia and a Muscovite court took up
charges against BP last week, the
unpleasant implications for the rest
of us were all too evident. ✦

EPA denies Texas RFS mandate waiver request

The US Environmental Protection
Agency has denied a request submitted by Texas Gov. Rick Perry for a 50%
waiver from the federal renewable fuel
standard (RFS) mandate for corn-based
ethanol.
The RFS, part of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007,

requires increased national production
of renewable biofuels to 36 billion gal/
year by 2022 from 9 billion gal/year in
2008.
Perry blamed increased demand for

EPA said it recognized that high
commodity prices have economic
impacts but that an extensive analysis
found no compelling evidence that the
RFS mandate is causing severe economic harm during the time period specified by Texas.

Current law authorizes EPA to waive
the national RFS if the agency determines that the mandated biofuel volumes would cause “severe harm” to the
economy or the environment.
“After reviewing the facts, it was
clear this request did not meet the
criteria in the law,” EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson said during a

conference call with reporters from
Washington, DC, on Aug. 7.
EPA conducted detailed analysis, consulted closely with the Departments of

US court overturns FERC OK of Cove Point LNG expansion
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
A federal district court on July 18
overturned the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s approval of a
proposed expansion of Dominion Resources’ Cove Point LNG installation on
the Chesapeake Bay in Cove Point, Md.,
just south of Baltimore.
The US District Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia granted
Washington Gas Light Co.’s petition for

review despite finding that “substantial
evidence supports FERC’s conclusion
that any threat of increased leakage is
due to defects in WGL’s system.”
The court overturned the approval
because it did not accept FERC’s conclusion that the local distribution company,
which serves Northern Virginia and
Suburban Maryland as well as Washington, DC, can address safety concerns before the project’s scheduled November
in-service date. The commission did not
support the conclusion with sufficient

evidence, the court said.
WGL said in its petition that the
project, which would significantly increase Cove Point’s LNG output, would
introduce more LNG into the utility’s
system. It said that for 2 years after
it began receiving a limited amount
of unblended LNG from Cove Point
at WGL’s facilities in Prince George’s
County, Md., leaks at the facilities increased 16-fold.
WGL also submitted a report to FERC
finding the LNG’s low-hydrocarbon

content caused seals inside its pipe
couplings to leak, the decision said.
FERC concluded that the leaks occurred
because WGL applied hot tar when it
installed the pipes decades before.
“We do not dispute that WGL operated its system for decades after applying the hot tar and only experienced
high leak rates after it began receiving
LNG in PG County. But at the same
time, the PG County facilities received
LNG for months without experiencing
significant leakage, and only suffered
those leaks when the weather became
cold,” the decision said.
WGL said the coupling conditions
that exist in PG County also exist in
the other 86% of its system and that it
would be a decade or longer to install
replacements. While reinjecting heavy
hydrocarbons into the LNG could stop
some leaks, the efficacy of such mea-

sures was uncertain, it added.
FERC’s finding that WGL had time
to correct any remaining problems was
not sufficient because it was based only
on repairs in PG County and did not
consider how the utility might repair
the rest of the system once the expansion begins operations in a few more
months, the court said.
Dominion is proceeding with the
Cove Point expansion, a spokesman said
on July 21. “In key respects, the court
affirmed FERC’s ruling and agreed with
its decision, including finding that the
leaks were results of defects in WGL’s
system, and Dominion should not have
to pay repairs. We’re confident that
the expansion is safe and in the public
interest. We also expect that FERC will
act expeditiously so that the Cove Point
expansion will proceed on schedule,”
he told OGJ. ✦

could slow the domestic oil and gas
production decline.
US Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.)
and Rep. Dan Boren (D-Okla.) each
introduced the Marginal Well Production Preservation and Enhancement
Act on their respective sides of the
Capitol on July 31. The bill aims to
streamline and clarify regulations,
prolong economic feasibility and
enhance production volumes from
US marginal or stripper wells, its
sponsors said.
Individually, these wells recover
less than 10 b/d of oil or 75 Mcfd
of gas, according to the National
Stripper Well Association. But there
are 400,000 of them in 36 states,
producing almost 20% of the nation’s

Inhofe noted that a producing well
provides state and federal taxes, pays
royalties to land and mineral owners,
“and keeps jobs and dollars on American soil and in American pockets. A
plugged well provides none of this.”

Another provision, which majors
could not use, would permanently
eliminate the net income limitation
on percentage depletion. Congress
temporarily suspended that on a recurring basis beginning in 1998 after
recognizing that it discourages investing to maintain marginal wells. The
current suspension expired in 2007.

Other provisions

Inhofe and Boren noted that their
bill clarifies a Clean Air Act provision that keeps the US Environmental
Protection Agency from aggregating emissions from exploration and
production equipment, pipeline
compressors, and pump stations
under the law’s hazardous air pollutants section. It also would make clear
congressional intent to not aggregate

revision was due to project delays in
Asia, lower-than-expected production
growth in former Soviet Union republics, lower growth in Canada caused by
an upward revision of 2007 data, and
reduced production in Azerbaijan with
closure of the Baku-Tiblisi-Ceyhan
pipeline.
EIA anticipated that the 850,000
b/d of non-OPEC supply growth that
it forecast for 2009 would be led by
Brazil, the US, and Azerbaijan, but
added, “Given recent history, possible
additional delays in key projects as well
as accelerating production declines in
some older fields cannot be ruled out.”

OPEC production outlook
Downward price pressure also could
be limited by supply risks in Iraq,
Nigeria, and Iran and from hurricanes,
and by OPEC possibly deciding to limit
production and keep inventories tight,
EIA said. Initially, however, it said that
it expected OPEC production to rise by
600,000 b/d during the third quarter
to 32.9 million b/d, assuming that

Saudi Arabia maintains its July production level of 9.7 million b/d through
the quarter. It forecast that OPEC’s total
production could drop to about 32.4
million b/d during the fourth quarter
and 31.6 million b/d in 2009.
It also said that lower crude production, combined with planned increases
in OPEC’s total liquids production capacity, suggests that the cartel’s surplus
crude production capacity could grow
from its current 1.2 million b/d level to
about 3.6 million b/d by yearend 2009.
“Although an increase in the supply
cushion could ease upward price pressure, it does not appear large enough
to trigger a sharp price decline. Moreover, possible delays in adding supply
capacity, proactive OPEC decisions to
cut output or expectations that supply
growth in the post-2009 period will
have a difficult time keeping pace with
demand, could minimize and shorten
any market weakness,” EIA said.
Domestically, it projected that total
US petroleum and other liquids consumption will shrink by nearly 500,000

b/d in 2008 based on prospects for a
weak economy and continuing high
crude oil and product prices extending
into 2009. Preliminary data show that
year-to-year demand declines narrowed
to just over 400,000 b/d during June
and July from almost 900,000 b/d during 2008’s first 5 months, it added. EIA
said that it expects year-to-year demand
declines during 2009 to be even less,
about 120,000 b/d below the 2008
average.
It said it expects West Texas Intermediate crude prices, which averaged
$72/bbl in 2007, to average $119/bbl
in 2008 and $124/bbl in 2009. Retail
regular gasoline prices, which averaged $2.81/gal nationwide in 2007,
are expected to average $3.65/gal this
year and $3.82/gal in 2009. “Gasoline
prices are expected to continue falling
slowly, average just less than $3.80/gal
over the next few months. This forecast
reflects continuing weak gasoline margins because of the decline in gasoline
consumption and growth in ethanol
supply,” EIA said. ✦

Shell Rocky Mountain Production LLC is
optimizing drilling, well
design, and completions
in the Pinedale field
in western Wyoming’s
Drilling
Green River basin to
increase production and
reduce surface disturbance. The company is drilling more than 90 wells in the
150-sq-mile area this year.
The Pinedale anticline is 35
miles long, 6 miles wide, and
produces from upper Cretaceous
fluvial shales, siltstones, and
sandstones. The California Co.
drilled the first well in 1939,
but the low permeabilities of the
rock and distance to the nearest pipelines precluded production.
Introducing hydraulic fracturing in
the 1990s and using multistage fracs
have allowed operators to develop
Pinedale into the second-largest natural
gas field in the US (OGJ, June 25, 2007,
p. 39), based on Shell’s estimated recoverable reserves of 25 tcf.

Completion Methods

Shell entered the field in 2001 and is
the third-largest leaseholder, after Ultra
Petroleum Corp. and Questar Corp.
Since 2002, Shell has drilled more than
280 wells, performed more than 2,800
frac jobs, and invested more than $1.5
billion at Pinedale.
The company formed its tight gas
48

task force, with an initial focus on
Pinedale, to “find, develop, and implement technologies that would assist in
unlocking natural gas resources from
ultra tight reservoirs (>0.01 md) in
North America.”1
Shell discovered that there is no
single “silver R&D bullet” that addresses
the technical challenges. Producing
gas from low and ultralow permeability reservoirs requires an integrated
approach that incorporates optimized
drilling, completions, and reservoir performance modeling, according to Shell.

Well design
The design of Shell’s Pinedale wells
has evolved. The company is drilling
directional wells with slimmer profiles
(95⁄8-in. surface casing, 7-in. intermediate casing, 41⁄2-in. production casing),
using underbalanced drilling techniques, PDC bits, and oil-based mud,
according to Operations Manager Geoff
Sell. Wells in the field were originally
designed with large casing profiles

also drilling

and skidding
rigs on drill
pads, as part of the effort to reduce
the number of surface pads in the field
(OGJ, June 16. 2008, p. 19). Most of
the anticline is on 10-acre well spacing
but may be reduced in future (Fig. 1),
says Shell.

We’ve designed a portfolio of SMART RDF fluids and breakers for a variety
of applications, all engineered to work together seamlessly, giving you
complete command of downhole fluids-related events. While drilling,
these fluids meet today’s highest performance standards. During completion, the SMART RDF fluids and breaker systems ensure maximum control
either by permitting oil to flow easily through the existing filter cake or
by eliminating the filter cake thoroughly and uniformly.
Now you can create a high-performance filter cake that can be removed in
a predictable, controlled way, without the use of aggressive chemicals and
their potentially destructive consequences.
The result is better performance, smoother drilling and completion operations, and improved productivity — all while protecting the formation.
This means you achieve the maximum potential from your reservoir.

In well completions,
Production
straddle packers offer a
way to shut off zones
from producing or injection intervals
above or below the packers. In this
article, two examples from completions
in the North Sea and one off Brazil illustrate the use of straddle
packers.
In its simplest form in
an oil field application, a
straddle assembly will have
two packers connected to
each other in a manner that
isolates the section between
these two packers from the
zones above and below the
assembly.
Packers differ from bridge
plugs in that packers have an
unrestricted ID that allows
for fluid flow from top to
bottom or vice versa. Bridge
plugs, on the other hand, are tools that,
when set in a well, have no throughbore communication and prevent fluid
flow in either direction.

of straddle packer operations. In the

Nonservice straddles

The nonservice-type straddle assemblies are deployed in either throughtubing or in the full bore. Common
applications for these straddles include:
• Isolate intermediate zones.
• Isolate upper zones.
• Insert sand-control screens.
• Insert flow-control equipment.
• Install velocity strings.

Oil production

A through-tubing permanent straddle packer assembly includes inflatable
packers designed to isolate permanently
a wellbore section. The packers are set
one at a time or both in the same trip.
These assemblies are run on threaded
tubing, coiled tubing, or electric wireline.
In-hole latching mechanisms allow the straddle assembly to be run
in sections, thereby facilitating longer
straddles in cases where a complete assembly length does not fit in the surface
riser or lubricator.
The production or injection areas
within the wellbore are not the only
areas that may require straddle isolation
for remediation. If the upper production tubulars develop holes or leaks,
straddle assemblies can isolate areas,
thereby eliminating well workovers that
require pulling out downhole tubulars.

Service straddles
Service-type straddle assemblies also
are deployed either through tubing or
56

in the full bore. In treatment operations,
these assemblies with inflatable packers
on coiled tubing have the same advantages as previously listed for nonservice
assemblies.
An inflatable straddle acidizing
packer (ISAP) allows precise injection
of acid or other chemical treatments
into short, select wellbore sections.
This feature replaces other less effective
methods used previously for selectively placing treating fluids, such as
bull-heading, ball sealers, or chemical
diverters. The inflatable straddle assembly primarily is run on coiled-tubing
workstrings; thus the tool operates
within the safe tension, set down, and
pressure limits of the coiled tubing.
Straddle assemblies that require only
a slight tension and no set down weight
for operation are ideal for applications
in horizontal or highly deviated wellbores. The inflatable straddle assembly
has a resettable design, thus a single trip
in the well can treat multiple intervals.
The design of the inflatable elements

also allows the packers to be set in perforations, screens, or open holes. This
facilitates treatment of long, continuous
intervals without the need for a blank
casing packer seat in which to set the
elements. Installation of threaded spacers can adjust the spacing between the
top and bottom packer sections (Fig. 2).
Another service straddle assembly is
an inflatable, multiset, straddle packer
for zonal isolation service work in cased
and openholes. The inflatable test and
treat system (ITTS) can treat or test flow
from selective intervals.
The ITTS design allows it to be run
on threaded pipe, in vertical, deviated,
and horizontal wellbores, so that short
sections of the formation can be chemically treated precisely or flow tested.
This straddle is a modular assembly that
can be made up as it is being run in the
hole.
The straddle assembly has a twoposition operation: pick up for setting,
and set down for injection and testing.
The ITTS design allows for treatment

and testing multiple zones in a single
trip, saving the operator rig time during
intervention operations.

Full-bore straddles
In a monobore (nonrestricted), the
full-bore straddle assembly has the
advantages of a more robust design,
higher pressure capability, and pinpoint
placement accuracy of treatment fluids.
One main technology development
in recent years is a full-bore straddle
tool with no packer cups for pressure
isolation and large treatment ports for
maximum injection rates. An assembly
without cup-type packing elements has
instead hydraulic-set packing elements
rather than the more traditional compression set elements for zone isolation.
The hydraulic-set packing elements
will have a longer life in the well, so
that more zones can be treated in a
single run. The elements also allow
faster running and pulling times due to
their having greater annular clearance.
The assemblies have full-opening
stimulation ports between the packing
elements to support large fluid volumes.
These large-bore straddle assemblies are
seeing increased use in large-volume
acid and proppant fracs for restimulating production intervals.
These assemblies allow the operator
precisely to place and inject fracturing
and other stimulation into a desired
formation length. Generally, full-bore
service straddle assemblies are run
primarily on threaded pipe; some assemblies can be run on a coiled-tubing
workstring, however.
One common straddle tool design
currently in use is based on the application of compression set service packers
and uses the concept of running two
packers and spacer pipe to form a straddle assembly. As simple as it sounds,
this type of fullbore straddle assembly
is effective and efficient at placing large
fluid treatments across a single zone or
multiple sets of perforations.
Conveyed on threaded pipe, a
set-down straddle tool can effectively
isolate perforations for washing or
acidizing. After individual treatment of

study shows that the

refinery capacity will be able to handle
forecast
additional supplies of
Canadian
crude
during
2007-15.
Planned export pipeline infrastructure
should keep pace with forecast additional supply of oil sands products
to 2015; export pipeline capacity will
increase by 2.1 million b/d. Current
capacity tightness should be resolved
once expected new pipelines start up
in 2008 and 2009. By the end of 2015,
spare capacity will reduce, suggesting

the need for additional export capacity
shortly after 2015.
Refinery projects targeting Canadian
heavy blends that we expect to proceed
are aligned with our forecast of additional supply: Canadian heavy blends
supply will increase by 1 million b/d
by 2015, and projects that are planning on processing heavy blends will
increase by 1.1 million b/d.
Flexibility in Canadian heavy blends
supply vs. refinery capacity will be
available only after commissioning of
the proposed Texas Access pipeline to
the US Gulf Coast (post 2012). At that
point, heavy-oil capacity in the region
could be used to process Western Canadian blends if projects do not progress
as planned in US Petroleum Administration for Defense District (PADD) 2.
Currently disclosed project costs
reveal that pipeline companies and US
refiners plan to invest more than $31
billion by 2015 to export and distribute
oil sands products as well as process

In addition to the investments listed in
the accompanying table, there are several expansion and upgrading projects
that will increase heavy oil processing,
most of them on the US Gulf Coast but
not necessarily planned exclusively for
Canadian heavy blends feedstocks.

Synthetic crude oil
There have been no announcements
of new capacity in the US specifically
for processing SCO. SCO can replace
light sweet conventional crude in most
refineries. The sensitivity of each refinery to the weak point of SCO—poor
quality of the distillates—determines
how much each refinery can process. In
most cases, dilution in the crude slate is
sufficient to overcome this.
Wood Mackenzie assumes that SCO
will compete with both domestic and
foreign light crude oil in the US. Canadian SCO penetration will redistribute
domestic light crude flows within the
US. This will likely result in less domestic crude from the US Gulf Coast and
Texas transferring to PADD 2. PADD
3 refineries will instead process this
crude.
The net effect of increased SCO
intake by US refineries will be the
replacement of foreign crude in the US
market. ✦

specific case. Several
removal and prevention
methods can help gas pipeline operators mitigate and manage black powder’s effects.
Black powder occurs globally. It is regenerative, forming
inside natural gas pipelines as
their internal walls corrode,
and spurred by the reaction of
iron (Fe) in ferrous pipeline
steel with condensed moisture
containing oxygen (O2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and carbon dioxide
(CO2). These chemicals are benign in
dry sales gas but can become corrosive
when dissolved in water.
In sales-gas transmission pipelines
exposed to oxygen contamination,
black powder consists primarily of
iron hydroxides, iron oxides, and small
amounts of iron carbonates. Contaminants such as sand, dirt, hydrocarbons,
elemental sulfur, and metal debris typically make up 20 wt % of black powder.
Black powder’s jagged shape and high
hardness erode pipeline control valves.
In pipelines transporting untreated
sour natural gas, black powder consists
primarily of iron sulfides.
The first part of these two articles
(OGJ, Aug. 11, 2008, p. 54) reviewed
recent laboratory and field work

Development Center to determine the
composition, sources, and formation
mechanisms of black powder in gas
transmission systems. Microhardness,
nano-indentation, x-ray diffraction
(XRD), x-ray fluorescence (XRF), and
scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
techniques, as well as several bacterial
analysis methods analyzed black powder samples collected from the field.

black powder’s physical and mechanical properties and presents a summary
and brief discussion of various blackpowder management methods.

Properties
The accompanying photograph
shows scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of dry and wet black
powder. Both black powder samples
consist of fine, jagged particles. X-ray
diffraction (XRD) analysis further confirmed the average particle size of black
powder as less than 100 nanometers.
Microhardness measurements conducted on both pipeline steel and black
powder revealed average Vickers hardness values of 179±10 VHN (87±2 Rb)
and 498±62 VHN (49±4 Rc), respectively. Hardness measurements conducted on black powder particles with the
nano-indentation technique revealed
an average hardness value of 475±162
VHN (47±10 Rc).
These results show both hardness measurement techniques provide
comparable hardness values for black
powder, and black powder is harder
than carbon steel (the hardness of black
powder is in the Rockwell C range,
while pipeline steel has hardness in the
Rockwell B range). The large standard
deviation in hardness measurements
with the nano-indentation technique
stems from the differing composition
of the particles (iron oxides or iron
carbonates), known to have different
hardness values.

Management methods
Gas pipeline companies practice
various methods to manage and control
black powder in their systems. These
methods reside in two categories: removal methods and prevention methods.

Removal
Pipeline companies have observed
the presence of black powder and its
effects for years but have viewed it
primarily as a nuisance and therefore
done little to understand and prevent it.
This has led most management efforts
to focus on removal of black powder
rather than prevention. Removal methods include:
• Mechanical cleaning. Mechanical pigs
scrape debris from the pipeline wall

and remove black powder. This method
may keep the pipeline fairly clean when
black powder has not been a major
problem. This method, however, cannot address large quantities of black
powder.
• Chemical cleaning. Several chemical
cleaning agents can remove black powder from gas pipelines. Gel and surfactant cleaners are used most frequently.
Gel can carry large amounts of solids,
but dealing with large gel batches
becomes difficult when cleaning has to
be done online. Removal of gel residues
from the pipeline also requires extra
attention.
With a proven record in removing
black powder, surfactants can dissolve
in diesel or organic solvents. Dissolution in water should be avoided to
prevent exposing the pipeline to water.
Surfactants can penetrate contaminants,
lowering the surface tension properties of pipelines and removing large
amounts of black powder.
• Separators. Separators and cyclones
use centrifugal force. Black powderladen gas passes through them and the
particles are physically knocked out of
the gas stream to the walls of the separator where they collect in a hub at the
bottom. This method only works if the
concentration of solid particles is relatively high and particle size is relatively

large (>8-10 μm).
• Filters. These usually consist of
cartridges placed downstream of the
gas pipeline to protect control valves
and customers. The design and size of
these filters depends on the amount
of black powder, its particle size, and
hardness.
• Cyclo-Filters. These combine the
best features of cyclones and filters in a
two-stage removal process. The cyclone
knocks out black powder particles
larger than 8-10 μm in the first stage.
The second stage consists of cartridge
filters that remove finer particles.
Each of these methods can work
separately or in combination. For example, mechanical cleaning by instrument
scraping can combine with installation
of filters downstream. This combination
ensures the scraped black powder gets
filtered out from the gas supply before
reaching customers.
Although removal approaches
protect downstream operations and
customers from black powder’s effects,
they have several common drawbacks:
• They are after-the-fact treatments
and do not address the root cause of
black powder.
• They require subsequent handling
and disposal procedures and processes.
• They require frequent applications.

• They often require multiple units,
as in the case of filters and cyclones.
• They add to the ongoing operational costs of gas transport systems.

Prevention methods
Prevention methods start with the
premise that internal corrosion of gas
pipelines causes black powder and then
seek to prevent the corrosion. These
methods include:
• Moisture control. Eliminating water
condensation in the pipeline is critical
in preventing black powder formation.
Improving efficiency of the gas dehydration process ensures dry gas in the
pipeline.
Appropriately sized triethylene
glycol (TEG) dehydration units coupled
with installation of appropriately sized
refrigeration and knockout drums
upstream and downstream of these
units, respectively, will ensure drier
gas entering the gas lines. Controlling
and minimizing process upsets such
as water and TEG carryovers also play
an important role in limiting pipeline
moisture. Appropriately sized, designed,
and maintained molecular sieves and
chillers might be expensive, but they
ensure drier gas.
Strict adherence to sales gas standards would ensure elimination of
condensed water in internally bare

pipelines and in turn prevent black
powder formation. Process upsets,
however, would still allow excess moisture into the delivery network, leading
potentially to condensation and internal
corrosion. Networks with multiple gas
treatment plants feeding into them
are particularly vulnerable due to the
potential cumulative effects of process upsets. A gas network connected
to seven plants, for example, each of
which suffered one 3-day outage/year
would be exposed to a potential of 21
days of moisture condensation.
• Internal coatings. Organic coatings,
such as high-solids solvent based epoxy
polyamine films, reduce drag but have
the added benefit of preventing black
powder. Typical application measures
2-3 mil (50-80 μm) thick to cover pipe
roughness (Ry5 = 30 μm). Used globally for 55 years in more than 300,000
km of pipelines, they have good ageing
properties, showing no degradation
after 30 years exposure to dry.
International Standards (API 5 L 2
and ISO 15741) cover specifications
of internal coating for gas pipelines.
Internal coatings are a cost-effective
means of preventing black powder in
new pipelines. They are, however, very
difficult to apply and not cost effective
in existing pipelines, particularly buried
pipelines.
• Commissioning practices. Improving
dewatering and drying procedures during hydrotesting by flash drying with
methanol or nitrogen instead of air
drying can help prevent black powder
formation.
The use of sweet water with biocides
and corrosion inhibitors will prevent
corrosion during hydrotest shut-in
periods. If sweet water is not readily
available in the field, as is the case in
many Middle Eastern regions, fresh
water slugs run between pigs will wash
the line and remove salt water. Chemical cleaning should follow hydrotesting in sales-gas transmission pipelines
to ensure the pipeline is free of loose
debris and mill scale before operations
start. ✦

New load cell signal conditioner
The OM-19 load cell signal conditioner
enables a weighing system to be controlled
by a computer or programmable logic
controller, eliminating the use of a digital
display.
Mainly used for
strain gauge sensors
such as load cells,
torque, or pressure sensors, the
OM-19 provides a
voltage output of
±10 v DC or 0-10
v DC and current
output of 4-20 mA,
while supplying the
needed excitation
voltage to power up
to four (350 ohm,
4 or 6 wire) strain gauge load cells (350
ohm).
Available in board only, DIN rail, or
industrial enclosure versions, it can be
used in a range of applications and envi-

ronments. All three versions are equipped
with a shunt calibration feature. A solidstate relay output option with two set
points (OM-19-2S) is also available.

New ultrasonic ﬂowmeter
The new Innova-Sonic in-line ultrasonic flowmeter is an alternative choice for
typical liquid mag-meter applications.
It offers ±0.5% of reading accuracy and
has the ability to measure down to zero
flow and virtually any clean liquid regardless of conductivity.
The firm’s PicoFly technology allows
ultrasonic transit time-of-flight to be measured in picoseconds (one trillionth of a
second) rather than nanoseconds (one billionth of a second). The result is excellent
resolution that enables extreme low flow
detection, the company notes.
The unit features high precision, high
reliability, high capability, low power con-

sumption, digital signal processing with
advanced noise filtering capability, and
good applicability. Repeatability is ±0.07%
of reading, operating temperature range is
–40° F. to +176° F., and bidirectional flow

EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST
USE BITUMEN ROYALTY-IN-KIND
GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA, CANADA

The Government of Alberta Request for Expressions of Interest to USE BITUMEN ROYALTY-IN-KIND
As the resource owner, the Government of Alberta, Canada is entitled to take its royalty share of bitumen
production in-kind in lieu of cash, as it does currently for conventional oil production. This amount of royalty
share could be a significant and growing source of reliable hydrocarbon feedstock for the future. The government
intends to have a portion of its royalty share of bitumen in-kind commercially upgraded to higher value products
in the province.
The Alberta government hereby invites interested parties to make a submission detailing their interest, and
explaining how they would participate in using the government’s bitumen royalty-in-kind (BRIK) volumes.
Submissions should reflect the Province’s objective of maximizing return from its royalty share of bitumen, and
may contemplate: upgrading, refining, producing petrochemicals, managing commercial processes, marketing
higher value products, facilitating access to new markets, providing infrastructure, providing ancillary services,
or any other related activity.
Proposals will be received up until 4:30 PM (MST) Friday, October 17, 2008.

444 Carpenter Avenue, Wheeling, IL 60090

New York Times
writer yields to
glacier seduction
A celebrated New York Times columnist
has observed glaciers melting in Greenland
and issued this judgment on proposals for
expanded oil and gas leasing of the Outer
Continental Shelf: “Madness. Sheer madness.”
Oil and gas professionals should heed
what Thomas L. Friedman’s non sequitur
says about the OCS debate.
Much opposition to OCS leasing relates

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

less to concern about effects on marine
environments than to a desire to foreclose
consumption of oil and gas.
This agenda probably repels most Americans, who like their energy to be cheap.
But it attaches itself to more-widespread
fear of global warming and becomes explicit in the prominent words of a columnist
who has earned fame for his writing about
the Middle East.
Friedman dislikes Middle Eastern oil
and has made clear in earlier columns his
preference for governmental interventions
aimed at cutting US imports. At one level,
Friedman’s positions contradict each other.
The writer wants to lower imports because
he assumes foreign oil bankrolls US enemies. Yet he resists an activity that might
cut US oil imports—OCS leasing—because
combustion of any consequent hydrocarbons might aggravate warming.
The positions are in fact compatible
from the broader perspective of antipetroleum radicalism. But a three-time Pulitzer
Prize winner and best-selling book author
might be able to afford life without oil.
Most people cannot.
So another bright person has yielded
to the glacier seduction, concluding from
the sight of melting ice that the planet is
warming—which of course it is or at least
has been until recently—and that people
must act sacriﬁcially to stop it.
The glacier seduction blinds its victims
to suggestions that observed warming
has causes other than human activity and
that human responses therefore might
have little effect beyond state-sanctioned
deprivation. But Greenland is, according to
Friedman’s vivid reporting, an enchanting
place, dripping with change, so apparently
everyone should ignore questions about
the wisdom of costly reaction.
A millennium ago, however, Greenland
was warm enough to support agriculture in
areas later engulfed by glacial ice.
This indication of warming caused by
something besides oil-ﬁred prosperity
doesn’t appear in Friedman’s analysis.

Another oil price spike predicted
Unless demand for oil collapses within 5-10 years, the world will experience a
serious “supply crunch” with prices shooting above $200/bbl for crude, according
to an Aug. 8 report by Chatham House, home of the Royal Institute of International
Affairs, a leading institute for debate and analysis of international issues.
That’s because investment in exploration and development of new crude supplies
“has been and will be inadequate,” said the report, The Coming Oil Supply Crunch,
authored by Paul Stevens, senior research fellow for energy at Chatham House in
London and emeritus professor at Dundee University.
“Even allowing for some increase in capacity over the next few years, a supply
crunch appears likely around 2013,” he said. To ward off a potential crisis, the report
recommends helping producing countries manage the “resource curse” of slower
economic growth despite ample natural resources; welcoming investments from
sovereign wealth funds; and bringing the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries into the International Energy Agency’s emergency sharing mechanism.
The pending crunch “is partly due to incentives for international oil companies
to return dividends to shareholders rather than reinvest them. It is also a result of a
resurgence in ‘resource nationalism’ and some governments starving their national
oil companies of investment funds,” the report said.
Rising domestic consumption is eating into the exports of many producer countries while resource nationalism excludes international oil companies (IOC) from
helping develop more capacity, Stevens said. Meanwhile, IOC investments are constrained by lack of access to low-cost reserves, manpower shortages, and shortages
in the service industries. A crunch could result from excess crude production capacity falling to low levels followed by a supply disruption, leading to a price spike with
“long-lasting effects on the global energy picture,” Stevens said. To avoid a crunch,
government energy policies need to reduce the growing demand for liquid fuels,
increase the supply of conventional liquid fuels, or increase the supply of unconventional liquid fuels, said Stevens.
However, the report concludes: “Only extreme policy measures could achieve a
speedy response—and these are usually politically unpopular.” It argues that an oil
price spike “might break down opposition to a much greater interventionist approach by governments in their energy sectors.” Stevens said, “An intelligent and
informed debate is needed about which energy policy interventions are desirable
and which are not, and on what basis such judgments should be made.” Price escalations have continued “partly because the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development governments are reluctant to intervene in energy markets. The
market alone cannot necessarily provide sufﬁcient incentives for conservation, fuelswitching, or bringing more energy on stream, so this laissez-faire attitude has failed
to either constrain demand or increase supply,” he said.
Similarities and differences
Escalation of oil prices to record highs in July resembles in some ways the 1970s
oil boom. Both periods were characterized by high crude oil prices and a widespread
view that the prices would go ever higher, said Stevens. Each time, price increases
were triggered “by similar causes, with supply and demand playing a role,” he said.
“Following the oil shocks of the 1970s, the vast majority of what were then classed
as developing countries did not pass on the higher international price of crude to
their consumers, preferring instead to subsidize product prices.”
Today several countries, including the major oil exporters and India and China,
are again subsidizing low fuel prices locally, stimulating much of the demand growth
over the last 2 years. In both periods, security of supply was a major issue, and there
was strong growth of “resource nationalism.” Stevens notes important differences,
however. “In the 1970s, the world experienced deep economic recessions.
“Today there has been no recession,” he said. “Today oil is much less important
in the macroeconomy than in the 1970s.” Although it may not seem so to current
consumers, the speed of the price change was much greater and the increase was
proportionately larger in the 1970s. Stevens reported, “The nature of supply and demand is different in the two periods. Today, environmental concerns are a key driver
of energy policy; this was not the case in the 1970s.” He said, “There have been
major changes in ideology affecting government policy. In particular, unlike in the
1970s, the ‘Washington Consensus’ discouraged government intervention. Industry
investment has also been increasingly inﬂuenced by new ideas of ‘value-based management’ for the [IOCs] and ‘principal-agent’ analysis for the national oil companies.”

Welcome to the 21st Deep Offshore Technology International Conference & Exhibition
Woodside Energy is proud to host the 21st Deep Offshore Technology International Conference & Exhibition in
Perth, Australia, the inaugural event in the Asia Paciﬁc region.
The mission of the Deep Offshore Technology International Asia / Paciﬁc conference is to provide a
forum dedicated to the advancement of the industry that addresses the technical challenges to safely and
cost-effectively develop resources from deepwater and ultra-deepwater basins around the world. This event
provides a unique networking opportunity for attendees to discuss issues with professionals in their respective
ﬁelds of expertise and to gain an understanding of the changes that are taking place within those technologies.
Woodside is supporting this event because the offshore industry in Australia ﬁnds itself at a pivotal point in
its history. Market forces are creating revolutionary change, causing a boom period of unprecedented growth
and expansion. This occurs at a time where the industry is facing increasing scrutiny by governments and
communities on our environmental and social performance. Demographics of the industry, combined with the
remoteness of the region, mean that effective design, build and installation strategies are critical to success.
The fruits of this boom are there for all players to beneﬁt from. History teaches us that the ultimate
winners will be those that execute projects effectively by being responsive and adaptable to changes in their
surroundings. This adaptability includes the appetite to be creative, deploy new technology and to enable new,
fresh ideas. I am energised to be a part of this environment and hope that we as an industry through events
such as DOT, can encourage the brightest and the best of the industry to be part of it.
The conference theme for DOT International Asia / Paciﬁc 2008, The Next Generation of Deepwater
Challenges, recognises the imperative to address some of the many deepwater technology issues faced by
Operators in developing the world-class hydrocarbon ﬁelds and prospects located offshore Australasia.
Woodside is particularly well placed to contribute via our experiences, and in learning from contributors
to this conference. Not only is Woodside Australia’s leading independent oil and gas company and a major
supplier of energy to the Australian and international markets, we also have a portfolio of operating projects,
development opportunities and exploration prospects in deepwater and ultra-deepwater environments.
Woodside already operates Australia’s two largest hydrocarbon resource projects; the North West Shelf
Venture in Western Australia and the adjacent Pluto liqueﬁed natural gas (LNG) project which is currently under
construction. We also operate two other LNG developments off Australia’s north coast; Sunrise in the Timor
Sea and the Browse Development to the west. We aim to begin construction of both developments within the
next few years.
While our focus is on LNG, we also have a large portfolio of other operated oil and gas projects
predominantly offshore Australia and also in the Gulf of Mexico. With most of our greenﬁeld projects located in
deepwater, we have an enduring interest and involvement, in deep offshore technology.
On behalf of the Advisory Board, I welcome you to DOT International Asia / Paciﬁc 2008. I believe you
will ﬁnd this year’s program stimulating, engaging and beneﬁcial. I look forward to seeing you during the
conference and on the show ﬂoor.
Roy Thompson
Woodside Energy Ltd
Chairman of the 2008 DOT International Asia / Paciﬁc Advisory Board

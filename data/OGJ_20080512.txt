OTC: Roundtable notes NOCs, IOCs lack trust
Business with national oil companies (NOCs) is certain to grow
over the next 5 years with 64% of delegates voting that this would
happen at the Offshore Technology Conference’s Energy Roundtable May 7 in Houston. But this new dynamic is threatened by a lack
of trust between international oil companies (IOCs) and NOCs,
which could hinder oil and gas investment according to 64% of
the attendees at the panel.
Global energy demand is expected to rise by 1.2%/year until
2030 with NOCs and IOCs committed to meeting those needs:
hydrocarbons will have an important role in doing so.
Oil executives on the panel agreed that there was a new energy
equation with constrained supplies, steep growth in the world’s
energy demand, geopolitical tensions, and new challenging energy
resources such as oil sands.
Patrick Poyanne, senior vice-president of strategy, business development, and research and development at Total SA, said IOCs
and NOCs should cooperate because IOCs have operational excellence and offer a diversified experience in handling large and
complex developments. However, Poyanne also acknowledged that
IOCs need to address the socioeconomic needs of producing countries and boost the intellectual capacity of its people.
“There is a lack of trust now between NOCs and IOCs. NOCs
feel that IOCs benefit from excessive profits. We accept that contracts can be revised in today’s market, but it needs to be on a winwin basis,” he said.
Increased competition between NOCs, IOCs, and independent
exploration and production companies for acreage necessitates a
focused and disciplined strategy, said Jean Claude Gandur, president and chief executive of Addax Petroleum. “Resource pressures
include personnel, service providers, and capital.”

OTC: Oil-producing nations balance supply, demand
Tensions are developing in some oil-producing nations with citizenship demanding an improved standard of living and economic
growth rather than a government with its focus on export markets,
Energy Roundtable panelists said May 7 at OTC in Houston.
Emmanuel Egbogah, special advisor to Nigeria’s president on
petroleum affairs, said that security of demand and supply are
complimentary and it was necessary to strike the right balance between local demand and high values in the export markets. Nigeria
is changing its stance by aggressively monetizing its gas resources
under its Gas Master Plan for the domestic market.
“The domestic market’s demand is expected to be at 10-11 bcfd
by 2010 but supply will be at 4 bcfd and export demand at 25
bcfd. This unprecedented growth is due to the power and LNG
export capacity,” he said.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Robert Ryan, vice-president of global upstream exploration at
Chevron Corp., was optimistic that oil companies can meet growing global demand provided it can find new ways to enhance recovery from mature fields, deliver technological breakthroughs in
the deep water and ultradeep water, and turn to unconventional
resources.
“We have always had limited access, remote locations, technological challenges, and escalating costs. These are all relative because one of these factors has always been a problem at some point,
but we have found ways to overcome them.”

OTC: Industry looks to solve personnel shortage
Thierry Pilenko, chairman and chief executive of Technip SA,
warned that oil and gas megaprojects will take longer to implement because of a shortage of experienced management. Speaking
May 7 at OTC’s Energy Roundtable, Pilenko said there were 190
major projects worldwide in 2008 that have an average size of 1.6
billion boe and require investments of $8.7 billion, according to
a report by Goldman Sachs. Most of the reserves will come from
deep and ultradeep water, which poses significant technological
challenges.
“As the complexity of project rises, soft skills and attitudes will
make the difference as well as the finance and technical skills,”
Pilenko said.
Greater societal and governmental pressure on oil companies to
reduce emissions and stem climate change means that they must
become more transparent in their practices, predicted Mark Lee,
chief executive of industry think tank SustainAbility. Oil and gas
prices are likely to be volatile with export quotas and resource
nationalism all having an impact on energy supplies. “Leadership
from the industry needs to become more sophisticated and I think
there will be a massive technological acceleration until 2050, particularly in alternative energy.”

Holly settles Woods Cross reﬁnery pollution charges
Holly Refining & Marketing Co. settled federal air pollution
charges involving its Woods Cross, Utah, refinery by agreeing to
spend more than $17 million on new and upgraded pollution controls, the US Department of Justice and Environmental Protection
Agency said on Apr. 21.
The Holly Corp. subsidiary also agreed to pay a $120,000 civil
penalty that EPA and the state of Utah will share. It also will spend
$130,000 on a supplemental environmental project to help fund
the purchase of new emergency response equipment for the South
Davis Metro Fire Agency, DOJ and EPA jointly announced.
They said that the settlement requires Holly to install pollution
controls which will reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by 315 tons/
year and nitrogen oxides by more than 105 tons/year. The new

Eni, partners ﬁnd oil off Angola with Sangos-1 well Chile awards eight exploration blocks
Eni Angola SPA and its partners made an oil discovery on deepwater Block 15/06 off Angola—the first well to be drilled on the
block—reported 5% block partner StatoilHydro.
The Sangos-1 discovery well, which was drilled in 1,349 m of
water to a total vertical depth of 3,343 m, found a 127-m oil column in high-permeability Miocene sands. The well tested for highquality oil in excess of 30º gravity and at higher than forecasted
rates, StatoilHydro reported.
The Sangos discovery well was drilled 350 km from Luanda and
will soon be followed by other exploration wells in nearby structures “with significant potential with the aim of achieving synergic
development of the western area of the block,” StatoilHydro said.
Block 15/06 lies within the Lower Congo basin and covers
2,984 sq km in 300-1,600 m of water.

Indonesia approves deepwater block for Chevron
Indonesia has approved a proposal by Chevron Corp. to develop
natural gas fields on the deepwater Galan Block off East Kalimantan.
“The current price of oil has reduced the risks of developing
deepsea gas blocks,” said Energy and Mineral Resources Minister
Purnomo Yusgiantoro. He said the price of natural gas is expected
to increase in line with the price of oil.
According to ministry documents, Chevron committed to spend
$311.6 million to develop the block, which is believed to have the
potential to produce an average of 800 MMcfd. Chevron holds an
80% stake in the block, while Eni SPA holds the remaining 20%.

Chile has signed contracts with four international oil companies
for exploration of eight blocks in the southern Magallanes region.
Apache Corp., Pan American Energy LLC, Greymouth Petroleum
Holding Ltd., and IPR-Manas collectively will invest some $222
million for seismic surveys and exploratory drilling over a 3-7 year
period. Work is due to begin within 6 months.
IPR-Manas won the Tranquilo Block and will invest $33.2 million. Apache won the Russfin and Lenga blocks, where it will invest
$23.4 million and $24.9 million respectively.
Greymouth won the Porvenir, Brotula, Isla Magdalena, and
Caupolican blocks and will invest a total of $107 million, while
Pan American Energy won the Coiron Block, where it will invest
$34 million. Brotula and Isla Magdalena are offshore, while Otway
is onshore and offshore. The remaining blocks are onshore.
Chile’s state-run oil company Empresa Nacional del Petroleos
(Enap) holds a 50% stake in the Coiron, Caupolican, and Lenga
blocks, with the remaining 50% in each block held respectively by
Pan American Energy, Greymouth, and Apache. The other blocks
will be 100%-held by the winning companies.
For reasons that remain unclear, Total SA, which last October won
the Otway Block where it was expected to invest some $44.5 million,
did not attend the contract-signing ceremony.
Chile’s Mining Minister Santiago Gonzalez said the government
was surprised at Total’s absence and that negotiations would start
with the next company on the list—a consortium comprised of
Wintershall, GeoPark Holdings Ltd., and Methanex Corp.
Analyst BMI said it is still possible that a deal might be worked
out with Total before the contact is awarded to another company. ✦

Reliance contracts for new Transocean drillship
Reliance Industries Ltd., India’s largest private sector conglomerate, signed a 5-year drilling contract with Transocean Inc. for a
newbuild enhanced Enterprise-class design drillship.
A Transocean subsidiary executed a shipyard contract with Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. Ltd. for construction of the dynamically positioned, double-hull drillship in Okpo,
South Korea, where four of Transocean’s previously announced enhanced Enterprise-class drillships are being built. Total capital costs
for the drillship are estimated at $730 million, excluding capitalized interest.
The 5-year drilling contract is expected to commence during
fourth quarter 2010, following shipyard construction, sea trials,
mobilization, and customer acceptance. The term of the contract
may be extended to 7-10 years at the client’s election up to a week
after mobilization. The 5-year contract provides for day rates of

Iran starts $1.2 billion Sri Lanka reﬁnery upgrade
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad launched a $1.2 billion project to upgrade Sri Lanka’s sole refinery at Sapugaskande,
outside Colombo, the island nation’s capital.
Sri Lanka’s petroleum minister A.H.M. Fowzie said the 4-year
upgrade will triple his country’s refinery capacity to 150,000 b/d
from the current 50,000 b/d. Earlier plans had called for an increase to 100,000 b/d.
Iran, which supplies 70% of Sri Lanka’s oil needs, agreed to
finance $700 million of the upgrade in the form of a 10-year loan,
with a 5-year exemption period from payment of the loan’s installments. Sri Lanka will provide the remaining $500,000 for the
project.
In March, Saudi Arabia expressed its willingness to assist Sri
Lanka with its oil needs—including the Sapugaskande refinery—
following a meeting in Riyadh between Fowsie and his Saudi
counterpart, oil minister Ali al-Naimi.
“We have plans to improve our refining capacity from 50,000
b/d to 100,000 b/d and getting Saudi expertise for the proposed
expansion will facilitate the successful implementation of the project,” said Fowzie.
The Sri Lankan minister added that his country also needed a
cracker to convert crude oil into diesel and gasoline which would
cost the government some $400 million. He asked the Saudi oil
minister to request funds from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to enable Sri Lanka to purchase the facility.
The importance of the refinery upgrade was underlined in January when Sri Lanka, which has to import all of its oil needs, saw

$537,000 for the first 6 months, escalating to $557,000/day for
the next 4 1⁄2 years. The 7 and 10 year contract terms would be
$1.35 billion and $1.85 billion, respectively if Reliance Industries
elects to keep the operating day rate fixed for the full 10 years and
does not terminate the contract early.
If Reliance Industries extends the contract to 10 years, then
it may have the operating day rate for the second 5 years fluctuate based on crude prices. The operating day rate for the second
5 years would not be adjusted if crude is priced at $75/bbl but
would be raised on a straightline basis if crude is then priced between $75-100/bbl, with a maximum 10% increase if crude is at
or above $100/bbl. It would be lowered on a straightline basis if
crude is selling at $50-75/bbl, with a maximum 10% reduction if
crude is priced below $50/bbl at that time.
Reliance Industries retains the right to terminate the contract
for convenience. But the termination mechanism is designed to
keep Transocean economically whole for the remaining term of
the contract.
The proposed rig will feature Transocean’s patented dual-activity drilling technology, allowing for parallel drilling operations
designed to save time and money in deepwater well construction.
It will have a variable deckload of 20,000 metric tons, and the capability of drilling in 10,000 ft of water depth, up to a water depth
of 12,000 ft, and a total drilling depth of 40,000 ft with additional
equipment. ✦

its trade deficit double to $610.8 million as higher oil import costs
exceeded export gains.
Sri Lanka bought $302.1 million worth of oil in January, when
the island‘s sole refinery shut down for upkeep work, compared to
$54.2 million a year earlier.
In February, the Sri Lankan central bank said the country’s trade
deficit widened to $3.56 billion in 2007 from $3.37 billion in
2006 due to the high cost of importing petroleum products. It
said the country’s oil import bill stood at $2.49 billion for 2007, a
20.6% increase over the cost of imports in 2006.

Gulf Petroleum gets nod for Malaysian complex
Qatar’s privately held Gulf Petroleum Ltd. won regulatory approval from the Malaysian government to develop a $5 billion oil
and petrochemical complex on a 1,000-hectare site in the northern state of Perak, according to state media.
Malaysia’s Bernama news agency said the International Trade and
Industry Ministry approved the request by Gulf Petroleum, which
seeks to build a complex encompassing a refinery, a petrochemicals
plant, and storage facilities.
Gulf Petroleum, which wants the proposed facility to serve as
a regional hub for Asia-Pacific, plans to invest $1.5-2 billion in
the project’s first phase—a refinery with a capacity of 100,000
b/d-150,000 b/d.
The Qatar firm foresees further large investments for additional
phases of the project: $1.5-2 billion for the petrochemical plant
and about $1 billion for the storage facilities.
Gulf Petroleum said at least two Middle East national companies

Bahrain, the UAE, and Egypt.
It is not clear if Gulf Petroleum’s proposed Perak complex would
connect with the bigger transpeninsular pipeline and related refin-

ery projects announced by Malaysia last year (OGJ Online, May 4,
2007).
The transpeninsular pipeline, intended as an alternative transport route to the busy Straits of Malacca, will cross the states of

Italy gives environmental approval for LNG terminal ing during a visit of Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin JasItaly’s environment ministry has approved plans by Compagnie
Industriali Riunite SPA’s energy unit Sorgenia SPA and northwest
utility Iride SPA for construction of an LNG terminal at Gioia in
Calabria.
The two firms have a 70% controlling stake in the Gioia Tauro
plant, which will have a regasification capacity of 12 billion cu m/
year. The proposed terminal is due on stream in 2013 pending approval by other Italian government authorities.
Meanwhile, Sorgenia is considering construction of an 8-12
billion cu m/year regasification terminal at Trinitapoli in southern
Italy—one of several LNG projects in the planning stages or before
Italian environmental authorities.
In February, Snam Rete Gas SPA CEO Carlo Malacarne said the
firm plans to build a pipeline linking the country’s transmission
system to an 8 billion cu m /year LNG receiving terminal near the
northeastern port of Trieste to be built by Spain’s Gas Natural SA.
Malacarne also said Snam Rete Gas plans to boost the annual capacity of its Panigaglia LNG terminal in northwest Italy to 8 billion
cu m from the current 3.5 billion cu m. Construction is due to start
at yearend 2010, after receipt of necessary permits.
Also in February, however, BG Group PLC said the Italian environment ministry had requested more information regarding the
group’s application for environmental clearance to build an LNG
terminal at Brindisi (OGJ, Nov. 12, 2007, Newsletter).
Ministry Director General Bruno Agricola said BG’s environmental impact assessment (EIA), delivered on Jan. 15, did not contain any
assessment of risk factors regarding a possible industrial accident.
Even if BG’s environmental problems are resolved, Agricola said
Italy’s national gas grid operator Snam Rete Gas SPA does not have
enough capacity to transport the gas from more than one LNG
terminal in the area.
Last October the Italian government suspended BG’s permits to
build the facility until BG completed the new EIA report. The Brindisi project was scheduled to start up in 2010 but the firm now
thinks that target could be “challenging.”

Qatar, Dutch ﬁrms to jointly upgrade energy ports
State-owned Qatar Petroleum and Dutch port operator Havenbedrijf Rotterdam NV have signed a long-term agreement on strategy and development in port management.
QP said it wants to develop its port at Ras Laffan to the highest
international standards, while Havenbedrijf wants to strengthen its
position as Europe’s main energy port, especially for LNG and associated hydrocarbons.
The cooperation was laid out in a memorandum of understand10

sim bin Jabr al-Thani to the Netherlands.
The sheikh’s visit followed a visit days earlier by Algerian officials who expressed interest in developing an LNG terminal at
Maasvlakte, near Rotterdam, along with storage facilities for LNG.
The Dutch government said it will send a delegation to Algeria
in the autumn for further discussion of the project.
The meetings underline new policy developments concerning
energy in The Netherlands, which is said to be shifting its natural
gas policy toward increased imports in an effort to retain its declining reserves, Europe’s second-largest after Norway’s.
In that new policy, the Dutch government put forward legislation in February to fast-track procedures for large energy infrastructure projects, including LNG installations, along the RotterdamAmsterdam corridor as well as around the Port of Eemshaven.

Rockies gas pipeline open season to start
Alliance Pipeline Inc. and Questar Overthrust Pipeline Co. plan to
launch a binding open season May 12 to assess interest in shipping
natural gas on the companies’ proposed Rockies Alliance Pipeline.
They have altered the planned route. Based on discussions with
shippers, the proposed route now runs from Wamsutter, Wyo., to
Ventura, Iowa. The initial route when the pipeline was announced
Mar. 25, 2008, was from Wamsutter to the US-Canada border at the
northwest corner of Minnesota.
As reproposed, Rockies Alliance will be a 900-mile, 42-in., 1.2
bcfd system expandable to 1.8 bcfd. The open season ends June 16.
Rockies Alliance would allow shippers to transport gas from the
Greater Green River, Piceance, and Powder River basins to Midwestern and eastern markets. It would connect with Alliance Pipeline and Northern Natural Gas at Ventura.
Questar said its Overthrust pipeline can be expanded at low
cost to connect multiple receipt points between Opal, Wyo., and
Wamsutter. In a separate open season, Overthrust Pipeline is proposing to add as much as 1 bcfd of incremental capacity from Opal
to Wamsutter and construct the proposed new White River lateral
from the White River hub at Meeker, Colo., in the Piceance basin,
to Wamsutter.
With minor modifications, Alliance can enhance downstream
capacity on its system, which connects to the Guardian, Vector,
Peoples, Nicor, ANR, NGPL, and Midwestern systems.
Rockies Alliance would compete with TransCanada’s proposed
Pathfinder pipeline from Wamsutter to a connection with Northern
Border in North Dakota (OGJ, Apr. 18, 2008, Newsletter).
Subject to obtaining shipper commitments and regulatory approvals, Rockies Alliance could be in service as early as third-quarter 2011. ✦

Decline rates?
There has been an abundance of studies and letters to the editor on oil decline
rates in recent weeks. The latest article,
based on a report from the International
Energy Agency, was motivated because
“failure since 2004 of non-OPEC production to achieve predicted output
gains has created the impression that decline rates are accelerating (OGJ, Apr. 7,
2008, p. 34).” IEA studied hundreds of
oil fields in decline and concluded that
the net decline rate is 4-5%/year. In February, Cambridge Energy Research Associates presented the results of a decline
study of 811 fields and came up with
an average global decline rate of 4.5%/
year. The key conclusion was that “there
is no evidence that oil field decline rates
will increase suddenly.” They claimed the
study had filled in the missing link! The
Uppsala Hydrocarbon Depletion Group
studied 333 giant oil fields and came up
with an average of 4.5%/year.
As the IEA report states, the fields
selected had to be in sustained decline
for at least 12-18 months. This is a
general condition to apply the standard
hyperbolic decline algorithms to wells,
reservoirs, and fields. What if crude oil
production has been flat, as has been the
case worldwide since 2004? The decline
rate is zero, according to the typical decline approximation normally used: (qi q)/q, where qi and q are the production
rates during the interval (year) of interest. But it’s a simple fact that the reserves
continue to be depleted at a higher rate
than if the production had dropped over
the interval. The proper definition for
aggregate decline rate must replace the
production rates with the cumulative
production values over the interval. In
the case of the US, the approximation
(using production rates) gives an annual
decline rate estimate of 2%, whereas the
proper rate is less than 1%. Worldwide,
the aggregate decline rate is 2.5%/year.
Physically, the decline rate declines linearly with depletion—it never increases—and much less suddenly (Sandrea,
OGJ, May 22, 2006, p. 30).

Those oil subsidies
To hear some US politicians tell the story,
“Big Oil” soaks up much of the national wealth
through “subsidies.” In a period of wildly elevated
oil and gas prices and consequently high profits of
major oil companies, the story sounds scandalous
indeed. This scandal, though, doesn’t bear up to
facts.
Oil companies in the US do receive federal
benefits that qualify as subsidies. But they’re not as
large as they’re reputed to be. Most such help goes
to small producers, not the integrated companies
connoted by the expression “Big Oil.” And oil subsidies, as a new analysis by the Energy Information
Administration makes clear, are smaller than those
available for energy forms yielding much less supply.

The nonsubsidy subsidy
In current discussions, the phrase “oil subsidies” frequently attaches without a time reference
to the number “$18 billion” to imply an annual
benefit unique to oil. In fact, the number represents the sum of the estimated value over 10 years
of two general tax breaks that a bill passed by the
House would deny large oil companies.
The larger of the two, the “Section 199” tax
credit passed in 2005, encourages investment
by all US manufacturers while tax rates on nonUS competitors are falling. Denial of the Section
199 would cost oil companies $14 billion over a
decade and hamper their ability to compete with
companies in other industries for capital. The
other provision, relating to treatment of foreign
tax payments, also would deny oil companies a
benefit available to others. Neither of these provisions, because of their general applicability, can be
called an oil subsidy.
According to EIA, federal provisions more
properly considered oil and gas subsidies amounted in 2007 to $2.149 billion. Energy categories
receiving larger subsidy totals last year were
renewables, $4.875 billion; end uses, $2.828 billion; and refined, or chemically enhanced, coal,
$2.37 billion. Each of the categories with greater
subsidies represents a fraction of the total energy
supplied by oil and gas. Receiving less total subsidies than oil and gas last year were coal, $932 million; nuclear, $1.267 billion; electricity unrelated

to fuel, $1.235 billion; and conservation, $926
million.
Of the 2007 oil and gas subsidies, nearly all,
$2.09 billion, took the form of tax measures. The
small remainder was research and development
funding and federal electricity support.
Two oil and gas tax measures dominated:
expensing of exploration and development costs
(E&D; mostly intangible drilling costs, or IDCs)
and the excess of percentage over cost depletion. Both are tax deferrals, as opposed to credits
or deductions, which are much more valuable
subsidies.
The recent history of IDC expensing shows why
the “deferral” distinction is important. The alternative to expensing is writing down costs from a
capital account year by year. With expensing, the
producer can deduct costs for tax purposes in the
year they’re incurred. Then, however, no writedown is available for that property in later years.
The advantage is timing of the tax payment rather
than escape from the liability.
EIA points out that in most years during the
drilling slump of 1987-99 the government’s
revenue losses were negative. “The negative values
imply a payment to the federal government of
funds that it had loaned (tax deferrals), mostly to
oil companies, in earlier periods,” it explains. No
one then complained about subsidies.

Distorting discourse
EIA estimates the value of IDC expensing last
year at $860 million. Integrated companies can
charge only 70% of their IDCs to expense and
must write down the remainder over 5 years. The
benefit of percentage vs. cost depletion, worth a
total of $790 billion last year, is available only to
small independent producers and is limited even
to them. The next largest subsidy in the oil and gas
category, and the only nondeferral type, is $260
million and doesn’t go to oil and gas companies.
It’s a package of credits and deductions for cleanfuel vehicles.
The perspective available from EIA’s report
won’t stop politicians from braying about oil
subsidies, of course. It does, however, show how
opportunistic falsehood distorts energy discourse
in an election year. ✦

The oil and gas industry continues
to develop new technologies and adapt
others to keep pace with the rising
need worldwide for energy. Diversified
energy supplies, energy security, market
uncertainty, and the recent strength of
oil and gas prices all have played a part
in fueling these “Waves of Change”—
the theme of the Offshore Technology
Conference in Houston May 5-8.
Industry continues to

Attendance at the 39th annual Offshore
Technology Conference in Houston continued to show strength this year, as last week’s
conference at presstime was on pace to exceed
last year’s final tally of 67,155 attendees—a
25-year high—according to organizers.

Energy security
Energy security must incorporate social acceptance of technology, available
diverse energy sources, and environmental sustainability, said speakers in a
May 6 panel discussion at OTC.
Robert Fryklund, IHS Inc. vice-president of industry relations, said society
in general, including the oil and gas industry, is working to achieve a balance
between energy security and climate
security. “Unfortunately, this puzzle
has a couple missing pieces,” Fryklund
said, “There is a lot that we know, but
there is a lot that we don’t know. In the
corporate world, we ask how much is
it going to cost? As individuals, we ask
how much more are we going to have
to pay at the pump?”
Amy Jaffe of Rice University’s Baker
Institute, Houston, said the concept of
energy security varies over time and geography. Europeans generally talk about
natural gas when they discuss energy
security while US citizens generally talk
about gasoline. “So, different parts of
the world are not even talking about the
same commodity,” Jaffe said.
The definition of energy security
also changes with perceived threats to
energy supplies. Such threats include
political instability and civil unrest
in some producing countries, severe
storms, and work stoppages. “On top of
that, we have to worry about a new producer climate. National oil companies
feel empowered by oil supply shortages,

alternative and renewable energy, he
said. “We do have to look at all possibilities: new sources of energy as well as
more efficient use of existing sources,”
Luthi said. “It needs to be a worldwide
effort. The US is a key part, but other
emerging economies need to be a part
as well.”
Kevin Leahy, Duke Energy Corp.’s
managing director for climate policy
and economics, said climate change will
rework the energy supply and distribution system in the US, particularly for
transportation fuels. He said the power
sector is going to drive carbon dioxide
prices in a global carbon-trading scenario and natural gas prices, too.
Regarding the future role of hydrocarbons, Leahy said, “I could see where
electrons would become energy carrier
for wealthy countries, and liquid fuel
would still provide the energy in countries with emerging economies.”
Key considerations for expanding the
role of clean energy involve more than
cost, said Robert LaCount of Cambridge
Energy Research Associates, MassachuMMS view

LaCount said.

geopolitical muscle,” Jaffe said.
Not all types of energy are well received, she added, noting that oil sands
are perceived by some as being good
for energy security but bad for climate
security. Saying that she does not view
energy security and climate security
“as two sides of the same coin,” Jaffe
acknowledged “a growing sense of
urgency about climate change and
security of supply.” New fuel efficiency
standards will reduce US oil demand
and emphasize greater fuel diversity, she
said.
Trade offs will have to be made
when determining the future energy
mix, and Jeffe questioned whether
many people yet realize the ramifications of such decisions. “If we move to
greater use of natural gas, what is that
going to mean for US energy security,”
she asked. “In a carbon-constrained
scenario, LNG becomes quite more dramatic. It makes the US more dependent
on imported LNG.”

International perspective
Fatih Birol, chief economist for the
International Energy Agency, Paris, sees
a “new world energy order” with some
new actors coming into the picture, and
some actors exiting.
China and India are transforming
global energy markets, Birol said, adding those two countries are expected to
contribute almost half of the increase
in global energy and 60% of carbon
dioxide emissions by 2030. China’s
oil imports are expected to reach 13
million b/d in 2030, and car ownership there is forecast to jump to 140
vehicles/1,000 people compared with
20 vehicles/1,000 people today.
“Carbon capture and storage would
be good for energy security and climate
security, but we are not yet there,” Birol
said.

flux monitoring. A recent experiment
proved releases of sequestered CO2 are
detectable and can be measured. More
testing is pending, she said.
The public demands a better understanding of what might happen to CO2
injected into a saline aquifer, she said,
calling monitoring a key element of
any sequestration project. “This interest is driven in part by concerns about
long-term stewardship and liability.
After the injection phase of the project
is completed, and the wells have been
abandoned, there are unanswered questions,” Benson said.
Benson said unanswered questions
include:
• How long and how much monitoring is required?
• What can be done to stop a detected leak?

Carbon dioxide
Both onshore and offshore sequestration options are under study to find
large capacity storage for CO2 emitted from the use of fossil fuels, said
participants at another OTC panel. Sally
M. Benson of Stanford University said
improved understanding of multiphase
flow and trapping in CO2-brine systems
is needed to predict the storage capacity
of saline aquifers.
Daniel P. Schrag, a professor at Harvard University’s Department of Earth
and Planetary Sciences, believes deepsea
sediments in 3,000 m of water could
provide permanent offshore storage by
gravitational trapping.
Sequestration of CO2 would keep it
out of the atmosphere, where it could
contribute to global warming, scientists say. Benson is studying monitoring methods “to provide a quantitative
assessment of the fate and transport
of injected CO2” over time. Physical
and chemical properties of the storage
reservoir and seal are key to the permanent containment of sequestered CO2,
she said.
Performance standards regarding leakage have yet to be established,
Benson said. Detection methods include
seismic monitoring and atmospheric

• Who is responsible for monitoring
and potential remediation?
• Can long-term liability be transferred to a shared risk pool?
• Will state or federal governments
assume long-term liability?

Offshore sequestration
Schrag is evaluating the potential
for subsea CO2 storage in deepsea
sediments. “At high pressures and
low-temperatures common in deepsea
sediments a few hundred meters below
sea floor, CO2 will be in its liquid phase
and will be denser than the overlying

pore fluid,” he said. “The lower density
of the pore fluid provides a cap to the
denser CO2 and ensures gravitational
trapping in the short term.”
Thermal modeling and laboratory
calculations show injected high-density
liquid CO2—combined with its potential to form CO2 hydrates—will impede
upward migration. Schrag has yet to
do field tests on his calculations but is
working with Shell Oil Co. to develop a
system that could be field-tested. Schrag
believes his proposed offshore sequestration will prove to be “essentially a
leak-proof method.”

Heavy oil
In an earlier OTC session, David Bairrington, general manger of nonconventional resources at ConocoPhillips, said
water management in developing heavy
oil resources is a bigger problem than
handling carbon emissions. Bairrington
told delegates May 5 his company uses
2.5 bbl of water and 1 Mcf of gas to
obtain 1 bbl of bitumen when applying
the steam-assisted gravity drainage process. About 30,000 b/d of production is
typical under this method.
Production of heavy oil—touted as
the future of the industry—produces
a high volume of carbon emissions
because of the intensive techniques
required to develop it, and regulators
are pressuring operators to reduce the
emissions to address climate change.
About 63% of the world’s heavy oil resources is in North and South America.
It is only within the last 5 years that its
production has become economically
viable, with heavy oil operators breaking even at a market price of $50-55/
bbl for conventional oil.
Meanwhile, operators in Abathasca,
Canada, report development costs have
soared.
“It is a high cost resource from the
production standpoint, so we’re looking
at using solvents to accelerate the viscosity,” Bairrington said. Other upgrading options include thermal cracking,
removing carbon, and hydrogen additions. “Carbon taxes and dealing with
CO2 emissions will be a burden to the

industry as a whole,” he said, stressing
that carbon capture is problematic.
Scale in developing unconventional
petroleum resources is crucial in managing costs, said Timothy Parker, chief
executive officer at HighMount Exploration & Production LLC. HighMount
operates the Sonora field in West Texas,
which has 20 tcf of gas originally in
place. Parker criticized the industry for
focusing on repeatability as a key success factor, stressing that this may not
be the criteria for success in tomorrow’s
operating environment.
He said HighMount regularly carries
out controlled experiments to identify
areas where costs can be slashed and
other improvements made. Compared
with its peers, he said, the company
has drilled identical wells for 70% of
the cost others incur. HighMount has
15,000 development locations and
plans an aggressive drilling program in
the field to sustain gas production over
the coming years.

Replacing equipment
The oil and gas industry will need
to invest $50-100 trillion to rebuild its
ageing infrastructure within the next 7
years to stave off a serious drop in oil
and gas production, said Matt Simmons,
chairman of Simmons & Co. International, May 5 at OTC. In a worst-case
scenario, Simmons said, oil and gas
output could fall by 10-20% by 2013
if industry does not replace its rusting,
corroded assets. Spare capacity has run
out because earlier cheap prices for oil
and gas precluded upgrading and construction of new facilities.
The average age of offshore rigs is
25 years, and oil companies have not
addressed the problem because of low
energy prices during the past few decades.
“The industry’s tool kit for corrosion
is old, and painting over rust creates an
illusion. Few parts of oil infrastructure
have been replaced,” said Simmons. Leaks,
stains, oil streaks, metal fatigue, and brittle
steel are all signs of ageing pipelines,
platforms, wells, and other assets.
However, the upward trend in prices
can help pay for the rebuilding of the
24

energy system, Simmons stated. Still,
he said, “There is no blueprint in place,
and this is a global problem. The longer
the blueprint is postponed, the more
acute the crisis will get.”
The reconstruction problem is
compounded by the shortage of skilled
engineers to carry out the work and the
scarcity of raw materials.
“Peak oil is a reality. In 2005 we
had peak production and this fell by
265,000 b/d in 2007. There is a high
likelihood that production will continue
to fall,” Simmons said. He forecast oil
prices could hit $200/bbl as global
demand increases. That same day in
New York, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
the world’s largest securities firm,
predicted crude costs could escalate
to $150-200/bbl within 2 years. The
front-month price for benchmark US
crudes soared past $120/bbl in intraday
trading May 5, up from $62/bbl a year
ago. On May 6, the intraday price hit a
new high of $122.73/bbl before closing at a record $121.84/bbl.

Mexico
With subsalt plays and poor recovery
efficiency for existing fields, Mexico
needs improved oil recovery and innovative technology to extend the productive life of its reservoirs, said Mexican
Petroleum Institute Chief Executive
Heber Cinco Ley on May 5 at OTC. Operators are finding Mexico’s fractured
reservoirs challenging because they are
difficult to characterize, model, and
simulate. “We need a new generation of
reservoir simulators,” Ley said.
The country’s oil and natural gas
industry is crucial to its economy, accounting for 40% of Mexico’s federal
budget. But production is on the wane:
oil output is 3.1 million b/d, and gas
is 6 bcfd. Cantarell, Mexico’s largest
oil field, generates half of the output
of state-owned oil company Petroleos
Mexicanos (Pemex). Cantarell had been
producing an average of 1.58 million
b/d, but production began falling last
November to 1.3 million b/d, and it
is expected to drop to 600,000 b/d
by 2013. Ley said the challenge with

Cantarell is accessing oil that is trapped
under the gas cap.
Onshore Chicontepec field will
require $14.5 billion to develop. Pemex
expects to drill 5,421 development wells
in the field by 2012. Oil production is
expected to hit 1 million b/d. However,
according to Ley, Chicontepec has a primary recovery factor of only 5-7%.
Deep water will be the future source
of oil production in Mexico, but expertise is needed in flow assurance, control
pipelines, subsea systems, and other
areas, Ley added. Pemex has assembled
its first deepwater asset team, Coatzacoalcos, which hopes to produce 400
MMcfd of gas under a $40-70 billion
investment program. The company also
has contracted three semisubmersible
drilling rigs for deepwater activity. Two
of the rigs can drill in water as deep
as 2,100 m, and the third can work in
water 3,000 m deep.
Water management from producing
reservoirs is another major challenge, as
it takes 3 bbl of water to produce every
barrel of oil, Ley added. “We need to
predict this accurately, as it can affect
hydrocarbon production. We need to
develop efficient drilling at lower costs.”

Angola
Angola has prequalified 40 oil companies under its latest licensing round,
which lists 10 blocks as available,
Syanga Abilio, vice-president of Sonangol, told OGJ in an exclusive interview
May 6 at OTC. The qualified candidates
include majors Royal Dutch Shell PLC
and ExxonMobil Corp., independent oil
companies, and private Angolan firms.
As so many Angolan companies
have applied for licensing permits, the
government needs more time to evaluate them, Abilio said. So the country
has postponed the previous deadline
for companies to submit proposals for
blocks. “A new deadline has not yet
been given, but we plan to announce
that shortly,” Abilio said.
About 200 companies participated in
the licensing round, which offers both
deepwater and ultradeepwater blocks.
“We don’t know what kind of interest the

prequalified companies had in the blocks
as they had not yet given us a plan for the
ones that they wanted,” Abilio said.
The government invited companies to bid for onshore blocks Cabinda
Centro in the Cabinda Centra basin
and KON11 and KON12 in the Kwanza
basin. In shallow water, Block 9 was offered. Three blocks, 19, 20, and 21, are
in deep water and Blocks 46, 47, and
48 are in ultradeep water.
Angola’s recent admission into the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries should not dissuade potential
investors from coming to the country,
Abilio said. “We joined the institution
that works to protect price, and it was
important to be part of that; we were
an observer at OPEC for a long time. We
have a quota of 1.9 million b/d but that
does not bind us on further exploration
and production. We had our oil infrastructure destroyed during our civil
war, and there is nothing to fear with
future investment.”
Sonangol aims to become a fully
integrated petroleum company by
2010. It bought a 20% stake in Societe
Ivoirienne de Raffinage’s 64,000 b/d
refinery at Vridi, Abidjan, in Ivory Coast.
Abilio declined to give the value of the
investment.

the lack of infrastructure have made it difficult to bring the resources to market.”

Sonangol originally planned to develop the refinery with China’s Sinopec, but
talks broke down last year following disagreement on what products the refinery
would make. It will process heavy acidic

a high conversion with crude, vacuum,
fluid cracking, and delayed coking units.
Construction of the refinery will start by

or successful prototype testing, have
broad interest and appeal, and provide
significant benefits beyond existing
technologies.

AC motor monitoring
ABB received an award for its microelectromechanical system (MEMS)
accelerometer for wireless vibration
measurements on AC motors.
The wireless vibration sensor is a
small, autonomous sensor mounted on
a motor close to a bearing. The unit has
a vibration sensor (accelerometer), a
temperature sensor, and provides wireless communication to a central computer for data analysis and storage.
The prototype sensor is
cylindrical with a diameter
of less than 1.5 in. and a
height of less than 4 in.
ABB says the frequency response is ideal for early detection of bearing failures.
The sensor uses the Wireless
HART standard for transferring
data.
ABB developed the sensor prototype
together with SKF and SINTEF under
a program sponsored by the Research
Council of Norway.

their responsibilities, including the
Federal Trade Commission, which he
said allowed oil companies to merge
and restrain growth in refining capacity. “In just the last few years, mergers
between giant oil companies such as
Exxon and Mobil, Chevron and Texaco,
and Conoco and Phillips, have resulted
in just a few companies controlling a
significant amount of America’s gasoline, squelching competition,” he said

in his written statement.
Recent record oil company profits justify reimposition of a windfall

those companies spend more money
buying back stock than increasing
exploration and production or refining capacity, Slocum said. The levy that
existed from 1980 through 1988 was
ineffective not because of the tax itself
but because oil prices fell shortly after

it was enacted, he said.
Felmy and Todd disagreed. The

imports, Felmy said. “Siphoning away

FTC starts process to consider rule on oil market manipulation
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Using authority it received in
energy legislation late last year, the
US Federal Trade Commission on
May 1 took the first step to determine
whether it should develop a formal
rule defining and prohibiting oil market manipulation.
The commission announced that it
has approved an advanced notice of
proposed rulemaking (ANPR) to seek
public comments on the appropriate
way to interpret and enforce provisions in the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA 2007)
aimed at preventing market manipulation in the oil industry.
“We understand that consumers
are being hurt by high [gasoline]
prices,” said FTC Chairman William E.
Kovacic. “The commission remains
vigilant in using its full authority to
prevent unlawful behavior that affects gas prices. Today’s request for
public comments is an important part
of our efforts to assess, quickly and
thoughtfully, how the commission’s
new market manipulation authority
may be used to protect the American
people.”
US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (DCalif.), who complained a week earlier
with several of her colleagues that the
FTC was dragging its feet in exercising its new authority, said May 1 that

the action was long overdue. “I thank
the FTC for heeding our call to protect
consumers by using this new authority to probe oil and gasoline prices and
punish those who manipulate prices
at the pump,” she said.
In a letter to Pelosi that she released, Kovacic said the commission’s staff “has worked hard to move
as speedily as possible.” The letter
continued: “To date, an FTC task force
has examined the development and
use of antimanipulation authority by
other federal agencies, as well as by
the states; met with other government
officials (including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, and
the Securities and Exchange Commission), and undertaken other tasks,
both substantive and administrative,
in connection with this legislation.”

Section 811
Two sections of EISA 2007 gave the
FTC this new authority. The agency
is seeking public comment on Section 811, which deals with petroleum
market manipulation. But FTC said it
already is able to seek relief through
federal courts for violations of Section 812, which prohibits the reporting
of false price information to a federal
agency, because it received this authority when EISA 2007 became law.
Following the advance notice’s
30-day comment period, Kovacic told

Pelosi that the commission “expects
to expeditiously analyze the comments received, draft a proposed rule
and issue a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) with a 30-day comment
period.”
The learning during this process will
be crucial, Kovacic said. “The commission has not previously sought to
develop a legal deﬁnition of the term
‘manipulation’ or prosecuted a case
alleging manipulation. Moreover, there
are challenges involved in appropriately applying this broad concept to
markets that, unlike electricity or natural gas, are not subject to comprehensive regulatory disclosure or reporting
regimes,” he said.
“The pursuit of a case alleging
manipulation in wholesale markets for
crude oil, gasoline, or distillates may
encounter other complexities arising
from the differences between such
products and the other markets in
which manipulation cases have been
brought, but we hope to overcome
these challenges as we avail ourselves
of the methods and opportunities
contemplated by the ANPR/NPR procedures, Kovacic said, adding, “Speciﬁcally, we believe that there is no better
way to generate meaningful comments
that will assist in our development of
a workable rule for the beneﬁt of the
American public.”

Windfall proﬁts

H

ow serious are the prospects of
Congress’ reviving the windfall
profits tax? Serious enough for US
Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-NM) to ask
the chief executives of the five largest
US oil companies for detailed explanations of how they use their profits
to reinvest in energy production.
Domenici, the ranking minority
member on the Energy and Natural
Resources Committee, asked the leaders of BP America, ExxonMobil Corp.,
Chevron Corp., ConocoPhillips, and
Shell Oil Co. in an Apr. 30 letter to
assess how proposals to increase taxes
on domestic production would affect
their companies.
“In order to help me gain a better
understanding of your investments
and your activities related to helping meet our nation’s future energy
needs, I am writing to request a summary of all public information in this
area,” Domenici said in his letter.
“In your summary, please include
the amounts that you are re-investing
in domestic and international oil and
gas production. Additionally, I am
particularly interested in the extent
of your investment in clean energy
sources such as wind, solar, biomass,
and geothermal energy,” he continued.

2005 Energy Policy Act, stop filling
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, crack
down on speculation and market
manipulation, and press the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase production.
“We have a choice. We can choose
to have you continue to pay the
federal gas tax this summer or we can
choose to have the oil companies pay
for it out of their record profits,” she
said at a May 2 “Get Out the Vote”
event in Hendersonville, NC.

Obama’s response

Obama responded on Apr. 29 in
Winston-Salem, NC, that suspending
federal motor fuel taxes this summer, which was first proposed by
presumed Republican presidential
nominee Sen. John McCain (Ariz.),
was an election year gimmick. But he
added that he also favors taxing oil
companies’ excess profits.
Oil and gas industry associations
are trying to counter what clearly
is election year rhetoric. “Siphoning away earnings from the industry

other than through the pensions they
receive invested in oil company stock,
or through their 401(k) programs, individual retirement accounts and other
stock holdings,” Felmy said.

Government intervention
impacts
Todd said a windfall profits tax
would simply be another example
of government intervention producing unintended consequences. “In a
tight global balance, the government,
through ultralow-sulfur diesel and
ethanol, has mandated tougher-to-make
fuels, requiring more refining and plant
maintenance. Suggestions for windfall
profit taxes would further raise the
cost of supply, while a suspension of
the gasoline tax in summertime would
only artificially increase the demand for
gasoline while robbing the government
of infrastructure revenue,” he said.
Slocum maintained that a windfall
profits tax would not reduce production unless it was excessively punitive.
“The proposals I’ve seen would reduce
executives’ bonuses and shareholders’
dividends but not materially affect production,” he said.
DeFazio still was interested in the
possible impact of speculators on oil
prices. “What would it hurt to have
trades no longer opaque and off the
books?” he asked Felmy.
Felmy replied, “API has not taken a
position on this matter. I would have to
defer to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, which regulates commodities trading and is better acquainted
with it.”
DeFazio declared, “But it’s part of an
administration that’s opposed to regulation.”
Todd suggested that speculation can
exaggerate trends, but it doesn’t create
them. “There’s some fear volatility built
into the market. A certain amount of
increased visibility would show that
tight markets and not speculation are
the primary cause of higher oil prices,”
he said. ✦

Focus on supplies
“When we started this study, the
question was what the impact would
be under the Lieberman-Warner bill’s
mandated requirements. We thought
it would be better to look at supplies,
which had not been done previously,”
Jones told reporters during a May 5
teleconference.
Other industries have suggested that
requirements of the Lieberman-Warner
bill would send jobs overseas, he said.
“This study convinced us that our
industry also has to worry about international leakage [of refining jobs],”
Jones said. When a refiner would plan
to increase capacity, “some accountant
would ask why the money shouldn’t be
spent overseas where greenhouse gas
emission allowances aren’t required.
Tankers [that] transport products instead
of crude oil, would be required, but the
same pipelines and terminals would be
used,” he said.
“Refineries are very long-lived assets
that require huge investments. Signals
such as those which Lieberman-Warner
would send are causes for concern
because they would make executives in
board rooms consider where they will
invest for additional capacity,” noted API
Pres. Red Cavaney, who participated in
the teleconference with API Chief Economist John C. Felmy and Lou Hayden,
another API policy analyst.
Hayden said Lieberman and Warner’s
staffs have been receptive to possible
gas-cost impacts of the bill and the need
to increase access to more domestic
supplies. But he suggested that a bigger
question is how extensive mandatory
measures must be because the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act and
other existing laws already may be having a negative impact on GHG emissions.
API released a second report May
5 that shows that the US oil and gas
industry invested about $42 billion in

Cavaney suggested that the upcom-

Republican senators offer bill to increase US supplies
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
US Senate Republicans responded
May 1 to near record-high oil prices
with a bill to authorize leasing within
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and
increase access to the Outer Continental Shelf.
S. 2958, the American Energy Production Act, would produce as much as
24 billion bbl of oil from ANWR and the
OCS, enough to supply domestic needs
for 5 years, according to bill sponsor
Pete V. Domenici (R-NM), who also is
ranking minority member of the Senate
Energy and Natural Resource Committee. Seventeen other Senate Republicans are cosponsors.
“For years now, I have been trying to
develop more domestic production of oil
and gas, and for years, with one exception in the Gulf of Mexico, I have been
blocked for political reasons. Consumers
are now paying the price for those years
of obstruction,” Domenici said.
The bill would allow governors of
states on the Atlantic and Paciﬁc coasts
to petition for leasing and have federal
moratoriums and withdrawals lifted.
New federal leases would operate
under a revenue-sharing agreement in
which states would receive 37.5%, the
federal treasury 50%, and the Land and
Water Conservation Fund 12.5%.
It also would repeal the $4,000 fee
for onshore drilling permit applications, a 2% reduction of states’ shares
of federal mineral royalties and a
1-year moratorium on funding formulation of regulations for commercial
oil shale leasing. The three provisions

were inserted into the Omnibus Appropriations Bill late last year.

Reﬁnery permit provision
It also would grant the US Environmental Protection Agency authority
to accept consolidated applications
for permits required to construct new
reﬁneries. Financial assistance to states
and Indian tribes for hiring employees
to process permit applications also
would be authorized. Application decision deadlines of 360 days for constructing new reﬁneries and 120 days
for expanding existing plants would be
established.
S. 2958 also would suspend crude
oil purchases for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for 180 days. It also
would repeal Section 526 of the 2007
Energy Independence and Security
Act that bars federal agencies from
contracting for alternative fuels with
longer greenhouse gas lifecycle emissions than the conventional fuels they
would replace. The provision’s author,
House Oversight and Investigations
Committee Chairman Henry A. Waxman
(D-Calif.), has said that it would apply
to any contract for a coal-to-liquids
or other alternative fuel or for “a fuel
produced from a non-conventional
petroleum source such as tar sands.”
The bill also would authorize research
to study transportation needs for renewable fuel blends, mandate that 6 billion
gal of coal-derived fuels be produced
by 2022, launch a study of diesel-fueled
vehicles’ environmental and energy
attributes, and extend US Department
of Defense contract limits for synthetic
fuels to 25 years from 5 years.

‘Produce more at home’
“Congress has spent billions to research and develop clean sources of energy,” Domenici said, adding, “I’ve been
a leader in those efforts and I will continue to be. However, we must face the
fact that no matter what we do, America
will still need oil, and without action, an
increasingly large portion of that oil will
come from unstable regions. With gas
prices soaring higher and higher, we
must produce more at home and this
bill allows us to do that in an environmentally responsible manner.”
Sen. John Barraso (R-Wyo.), one of
the measure’s cosponsors, said, “Record oil prices are a burden whether
it is for transportation, home heating,
or groceries. The issues of high prices
and foreign dependence go hand-inhand. This bill hits the nail on the head
when it comes to addressing America’s
energy needs.”
Another cosponsor, Sen. Lisa
Murkowski (R-Alas.), said the US has
the resources to produce more oil and
gas. “We just need the policies that will
allow us to develop those resources.
We have the technology to not only
safeguard the environment while developing resources, but also safeguard
Americans’ bank accounts at a time
when they are struggling to meet rising
energy costs,” she said.
But the bill faces an uncertain future
in the Senate and House since Democrats hold a majority in both and many
have said they believe development
of alternative fuels and renewable
technologies would be more beneﬁcial
environmentally and economically.

“Congress has also funded important

to enhance domestic production. It is
simply inaccurate finger-pointing to say
that Congress is impeding oil and gas

Short-term actions
He said the US could take a number
of short-term actions to reduce upward
pressure on oil prices, starting with
suspending crude oil purchases for the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve. “It simply
makes no sense to be putting $120 oil
underground,” he observed.
Consumers also need to understand that they increase their motor
vehicle’s fuel efficiency by about 7.5%
for every 5-mph reduction in speed,
by about 4% when the vehicle’s tires
are properly inflated, and by about 2%
with regular maintenance, according
to Bingaman.
“Americans could use about 10-15%
less gasoline just by adopting these
common-sense measures. But they
won’t ever do so unless there is a lot of
publicity that makes clear that they can
save the equivalent of 50¢/gal by taking
these simple steps,” he said.
Bingaman outlined two mediumterm steps he said would ensure
adequate government oversight of oil
markets. First, he said, the US Secretary of Energy should have a role. “It
troubles me that the people at the New
York Mercantile Exchange, on which oil
is traded, and the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, which regulates
that exchange, seem to be the only
people who think that speculators are
not influencing oil prices,” Bingaman
said.
The energy secretary and the more
than 500 employees at EIA who analyze
data and develop forecasts should at
least provide market insights and advice
to CFTC regulators, he suggested. “Perhaps this could help the CFTC come to

A new ﬂag
of convenience

T

he US and French governments,
deeply concerned about attacks
on oil tankers, have introduced a
draft United Nations resolution that
would allow countries to pursue
pirates from the high seas and into
territorial waters to arrest them.
While the draft resolution would
specifically authorize action only
against pirates off Somalia, it contains the possibility of extending the
antipiracy mandate elsewhere.
The draft resolution expresses
concern at reports from the International Maritime Organization providing “evidence of continuing piracy
and armed robbery in regions crucial
to international navigation, including the western Indian Ocean and the
Gulf of Guinea.”
It cites the hijacking off Somalia
of the Panamanian-flagged vessel
Fiesty Gas Apr. 10, the French-flagged
passenger ship Le Ponant Apr. 4, the
Spanish fishing vessel Playa de Bakio
Apr. 20, and the attempted hijacking
of the Japanese oil tanker Takayama
Apr. 21.

Al Qaeda speaks up
Ominously, the Al Qaeda terrorist
organization recently issued a resolution of its own calling for maritime
jihad, or “holy war.” It cites the very
same attacks as examples of its recent
successes against the West.
The group referred to “the operations by the gunmen who seized the
French yacht and struck the Japanese
oil tanker, the Spanish yacht, and
commercial ships that ply between
the coast of Somalia and Yemen....”
The group underlined its successes
in the region, recalling that the mu-

36

jahidin, or holy warriors, succeeded
in Yemen twice: “The first was the
preparation for the two blessed conquests in New York and Washington
by striking the American destroyer
Cole in October 2000; then, there
was the French oil tanker Limburg in
2002.”
The group explained why the
area is so important to their larger
strategic aims: “The beaches of Yemen are considered the links between
the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Aden.
The latter overlooks the Strait of Bab
al-Mandab in the Red Sea and the
Indian Ocean.
“This region represents a strategic
point to expel the enemy from the
most important pillars of its battle. If
[the enemy] is unable to protect itself
in this strategic region, then it cannot
protect itself on the ground and its
naval bases under the blows of the
mujahidin.”

Terrorists, not “pirates”
It can hardly be a coincidence
that the Al Qaeda statement and the
proposed UN resolution have come
at the same time. In fact, both sides
seem to have declared open warfare
on each other, with the high seas
now the battleground.
But there’s much more going on
in this war than the mere “pirate”
attacks that are mentioned in the UN
resolution sponsored by the US and
France.
We sense that the international
war on terror is being taken to the
sea, but we also sense that the resolution is flying a flag of convenience:
instead of being called “the war on
maritime terrorists” it’s called “the
war on piracy.” ✦

understand the role of speculators in
the market in a manner that is more in
line with conventional thinking among
oil analysts,” he said.
Second, said Bingaman, markets that
trade US oil or are located in the US
should be subject to US regulation. “It
is unacceptable that an exchange based
in Atlanta, Ga., [trading] US crude oil
that is delivered in Oklahoma is regulated in the United Kingdom [and is] not
subject to the laws and regulations that
we in Congress put in place to regulate
the futures industry. It is also unacceptable that over-the-counter markets are
regulated neither here in the US nor in
the UK. There is no regulatory body that
can see these over-the-counter transactions,” he said.
He said the proposal initially offered by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.)
to suspend federal gasoline and diesel
fuel taxes through the summer would
come at the expense of fiscal common
sense and sound energy policy. “We
need to get serious about energy policy.
It is an election year, and while there is
a tendency to take rhetorical stands in
the run-up to an election, the American people understand that. That’s one
reason why they don’t always hold Congress in the highest esteem. Proposals
that are mostly feel-good propositions
will not fool voters for long, if at all,”
Bingaman said. ✦

Covenant oil field in the Central Utah
thrust belt may have a companion soon.
Covenant field, discovered by
private Wolverine Gas & Oil Corp.,
Grand Rapids, Mich., produced its 5
millionth bbl of oil in early 2008, and
a press report indicates that a second
discovery may be announced soon
pending test results.
A Wolverine official is quoted in a
Utah newspaper saying that the company could be producing oil later in May
from a second discovery well. He said
geologic indicators look good at the
well, Arapien Valley 24-1, in 24-20s-1e,
near Mayfield in Sanpete County, Utah.
The wellsite is about 20 miles northnortheast of Covenant field in 23s-1w,
Sevier County. A completion unit was
working as of this writing in early May.
Despite the “tite-hole” nature of
the play, Wolverine seems to have lent
credence to the report by applying to
Sanpete County to build a temporary
storage/treatment facility and loading
station.
Since discovering Covenant in May
2004, Wolverine has drilled five exploration wells in and near the thrust
belt, four of which it lists as dry or
temporarily abandoned. The fifth, if it is
determined to be a discovery, could be
named Providence field.
Sources said several of the play’s
“unsuccessful” exploratory wells may
be on the edge of potentially productive structures and may be sidetracked
later.
Oxy USA Inc., Houston, a subsidiary
of Occidental Petroleum Corp., Los
Angeles, acquired major interests from
Wolverine and its partners in seven
counties in the play last year (OGJ, Oct.
22, 2007, p. 37).

Covenant’s status
Cumulative production from Covenant field was 4.9 million bbl through
the end of 2007, state figures show.
The field, which doesn’t produce
gas, also has made 1.24 million bbl of
water.
The December 2007 average was
4,636 b/d of oil and 1,695 b/d of

& DEVE

water from 10 wells. Most of the oil
comes from Jurassic Navajo sandstone
at 6,200 ft.
Wolverine reported completing the
17-8 well producing 145 b/d of oil and
450 b/d of water from the subthrust
Jurassic Twin Creek formation. This and
the 17-9 well have raised the number of
wells capable of production at Covenant
to 12.
Eight more
Covenant wells are
permitted, three of
which have spud.
Wolverine and
Oxy plan to shoot
a large 3D seismic
survey later this
year over Covenant field and the surrounding area about 8 miles northeast
of Richfield, Utah.
Refinery utilization in Salt Lake City
is at capacity, and it is difficult to see
how production on the thrust belt
could be increased much absent additions in refining or pipeline capacity.

Second discovery indicated
in Central Utah thrust belt

Exploration outlook
Sources said that as many as three
exploratory dry holes in the play might
be sidetracked based on positive postdrilling seismic reevaluations.
These include one by Wolverine in
18-19s-1e, Sanpete County, and one by
Petro-Hunt LLC, Dallas, in 15s-2e.
Oxy and Wolverine, meanwhile, have
obtained permits to shoot 280 linemiles of 2D seismic later this year in
Sevier and Sanpete counties.
Sources said the companies plan to
drill two to three more exploratory
wells in the play this year.
In addition to taking interests in
Wolverine and partners’ original acreage, Oxy purchased 50-100% working
interests in about 65,000 acres in the
thrust belt from Plains Exploration &
Production Co., Houston.
Overall, Occidental said it invested
$743 million in 2007 to acquire several
new properties in California, the Rocky
Mountains, and the Permian basin, collectively increasing its proved reserves
by 50 million boe.

Other operators
Numerous other large and small
companies are attempting to establish
footholds in the play.
Private Anschutz Exploration Corp. of
Denver is active at the north end of the
play and is permitting a follow-up to a
dry hole it drilled 2 years ago.
Petro-Hunt drilled a well west of
Ephraim, Utah, that encountered the
Twin Creek formation three times. It is
comtemplating reentry and directionally drilling to the west. Petro-Hunt
staked a location just south of Wales,
Utah, about 6 miles north of its temporarily abandoned well, that may be
drilled.
Private Freedom Oil & Gas has acreage north of Petro-Hunt and is trying to
raise funds for drilling.
Pioneer Natural Resources Inc., Dallas, is shooting seismic on a separate
thrust west of the Arapien Valley 1-24
well. It bought a major working interest
from private Burnett Oil Co., Dallas.
Far to the south, Delta Petroleum
Corp., Denver, drilled a well in Iron
County west of Parowan, Utah, and

plans to test shows in the Twin Creek
this fall. The company also plans to drill
in Beaver County just south of Beaver,
Utah.
Delta disclosed that it has identified
at least 20 prospects between Parowan
and the Arapien Valley 1-24 well that it
would like to drill eventually.
Delta drilled its first well southwest
of Covenant field anticipating Navajo at
5,000 ft. Instead, it cut igneous rocks
from near surface to 11,000 ft and penetrated Navajo below that. The well was
11⁄2 miles low structurally and dry.
Talisman Energy Inc., Calgary, has
purchased some acreage in the thrust
belt and has done some 2D seismic.
Private Chief Oil & Gas LLC, Dallas, purchased 50% working interest in
180,000 acres in the thrust belt. The
other 50% is owned half by private
International Petroleum LLC, Salt Lake
City, and half by Pioneer Oil & Gas,
South Jordan, Utah.

‘Dolly’
Previously named the Dolly prospect,
Gulltopp field is in the Tampen area of
the northern Norwegian North Sea,
5 km north of Gullfaks satellite fields
Gullveig and Rimfaks (Fig. 1). The field
is operated by majority owner StatoilHydro (70%), on behalf of license
partner Petoro AS (30%).
In 2002, the Deepsea Trym semisubmerible rig, owned by Odfjell Drilling
AS, drilled the 34/10-47ST2 wildcat on
Dolly (OGJ, Dec. 9, 2002, p. 8).
In January 2007, Odfjell sold the
Deepsea Trym, a second-generation
semisub, of modified Aker H-3 design,
to Songa Trym AS (Songa Offshore), and
it was renamed the Songa Trym. The rig
continues to drill for StatoilHydro in
the North Sea.

Operations

Before Gulltopp, Statoil’s longest
production well was the 34/10-A47T2, which reached 9,052 m MD and
was sidetracked to 8,835 m MD. It was
drilled in 2001 to Gullfaks South from
the Gullfaks A
platform.2

either drilling and producing through
a subsea template or attempting to
drill production wells from the nearest platform. Statoil initially estimated
the cost of drilling the extended reach
well at $43.9 million, about 25% of the
cost it estimated necessary to develop
Gulltopp with a subsea template and
dedicated multiphase flowlines (OGJ,
Feb. 9, 2004, p. 8).
Last month, after completing the
3-year project, StatoilHydro said the
well was “considerably more expensive
than initially assumed.”
The rig on the Gullfaks A platform
is in 439-ft water and StatoilHydro describes the Gulltopp oil as “exceptionally shallow.” The reservoir is 2,430 m
below the sea surface.1
The company planned to deviate the
Gullfaks A sidetrack to 83° from vertical
to reach the Brent reservoir and then
deviate to 90° through the formation
(OGJ, Feb. 9, 2004, p. 8).

ERD
Drilling contractor Seawell Ltd. has
managed platform rigs in the North
Sea since 1977, with about 35% of the
market off Norway and experience in
extended-reach drilling. In 1995, Seawell drilled an extended-reach, world
record well from Oseberg C to a total
depth 9,327 m for Hydro.
In August 2004, Statoil awarded
Seawell the Tampen production drilling
operations contract for Statfjord and
Gullfaks fields.
StatoilHydro renewed the contract
in March 2008; the 2-year extension
begins Oct. 1 (OGJ Online, Mar. 13,
2008). Gullfaks A and B have 42 wells
each, and C has 52, totaling 136. Seawell has performed managed pressure
and through-tubing drilling at Gullfaks.
It is involved in planning and upgrading of the equipment for extended-reach drilling. Seawell says that
StatoilHydro is considering wells with
12,000-15,000 m reach on Gullfaks A
and C for the future.3

Key to success
To reach Gulltopp, StatoilHydro had

to drill about 4 m horizontally for each
1 m vertically; most of the well path
had an inclination of 7º (Fig. 2).
The shallow angle meant there was a
great deal of friction while drilling and
running casing. StatoilHydro chose to
fill the 8-km casing with air, instead of
drilling mud, in order to reduce drag
and “float” the casing in the nearly
horizontal well. “This was the key to
success,” the company said.1
The extreme drilling required StatoilHydro to upgrade the brake system
on the drilling rig and the power supply for the platform.
Arne Sigve Nylund, head of operations west at StatoilHydro, described
it as “the company’s most demanding
drilling operation.”
Among the new technologies Statoil used to drill the well were newly
designed 7-in. polymer control line
protectors, beginning in October 2005
(OGJ, Aug. 15, 2005, p. 44).
Geir Slora, head of drilling and wells
at StatoilHydro, said that the suppliers
involved made a “crucial contribution”
to the success of the Gulltopp well.

Gullfaks A is used for storing and
exporting stabilized crude from Vigdis
and Visund fields.
Production at Gullfaks is commingled from the Gullfaks A/B/C, Gullfaks
satellites, Vigdis, Visund, and Tordis
fields. Gullfaks blend is a light, low sulfur North Sea crude oil, 37.5º API.4
Oil is loaded into shuttle tankers, and
associated gas is piped to the Kårstø gas
treatment plant north of Stavanger and
then on to continental Europe. ✦

Production

A study focused on potential hydrate
formation in the pipe that connects the
separator to the planned Ormen Lange
subsea compressor.
Subsea gas compression is a new
technology, and this article summarizes
the results of an analysis of the potential for hydrate formation in the subsea
compression station when it operates at
steady conditions.
To maintain production levels in
the future, Ormen Lange will require
offshore gas compression, and the
field’s operator has selected subsea gas
compression as an alternative to the
base-case of having compression on a

floating platform.
StatoilHydro and its partners are now
designing and building a full-scale pilot
unit that will operate for a minimum
2 years in a seawater filled basin at the
Ormen Lange onshore plant at Nyhamna.
In subsea gas compression, gas-liquid separation takes place upstream of
the compressor unit, and thus this study
will assess the hydrate inhibition strategy with respect to the Ormen Lange
subsea compressor station.

Production from the field will satisfy
eventually about 20% of the UK’s gas

Ormen Lange is in a prehistoric slide
area with an uneven sea bottom that has
local 60-80 m high summits. The slide’s
back wall is steep, up to 26°. Environmental conditions are also severe.

Hydrate formation
Subsea compression in recent years
has been the subject of several studies.3-5 Reference 5 provides a detailed
description of the subsea compression
planned at Ormen Lange (Fig. 1).
Gas hydrates are crystalline ice-like
structures wherein gas molecules are
trapped in cages formed from hydrogen-bonded water molecules.6
Hydrate crystal morphology differs
for various hydrocarbon mixtures. This
means that in some cases the hydrocarbon liquid phase transports the crystals
as dispersed particles, while in other
cases the hydrate crystals form deposits
on the pipe walls.
Hydrate formation is a major threat
for forming blockages in long flowlines
transporting unprocessed gas along the
seabed.7 8 The threat can be controlled
by adding hydrate inhibiting chemicals
but the ultimate solution is to maintain
flow without using chemicals or at least
with using a minimum amount.
Extensive research on underinhibited
systems or systems operating within
the hydrate region without inhibitors is
ongoing currently.9
No compression system in the world
is designed to compress water-wet
hydrocarbon gas at a temperature below
the hydrate formation temperature. The
Ormen Lange subsea compression system has to do this; so that the process

ties for the field are different than for
any existing compression operation.
This study aimed to secure efficient and effective long-term full scale
(single train) pilot testing in Nyhamna
to avoid for example long delays in testing due to hydrate problems.
The Ormen Lange subsea compression project identified that hydrate formation inside the compression station
might lead to operational problems.
Upstream of the compression station
there is no problem because the Ormen
Lange flow assurance strategy creates
conditions in which the flow is always
sufficiently inhibited against hydrates.
Monoethylene glycol (MEG) is added

to the well stream (gas at dewpoint) at
the templates to prevent the condensed
water from forming gas hydrates. The
design concentration is 60 wt % at
the pipe outlet, which means that the
concentration of the lean MEG at the
wellhead is significantly higher (90 wt
%) to make up for the dilution by the
condensed water along the flowline.
Formation water breakthrough is not
expected, but should it appear, the well
needs to be shut in. If the MEG injection is reduced, stopped, or insufficient
with respect to concentration, the well
also needs to be shut in.2
The hydrate strategy needs to
be verified for a subsea compres-

sor station placed near the wellhead.
This means that normal operation
(no formation water) with respect to
hydrate formation and remediation
should be verified. All calculations and
conclusions discussed in this article are
related to normal operating conditions.
Shut down and start-up situations
represent transients that will be addressed in the design of the compressor system. For example, at start-up
and after a shut-down, the compressor
system requires inhibition with MEG
for the existing temperature and pressure conditions. Hence, the system will
be designed accordingly.
The main question answered in this

Pressure, bara

The selected pressure and temperature for the base-case calculation was
45 bar and 10° C. The separator operating temperature and pressure can have
large variations. Pressure can vary from
155 bars down to 35 bars. The temperature can be higher or lower during
start-up or shut-down.
The base case calculation represents
conditions late in the field life.
Calculations show that the temperature drop from the separator to the
compressor inlet is only a few degrees,
and this temperature drop will be small
at whatever temperature the separator
operates at.
If the system shuts down and cools
to –1° C., however, then the amount
of condensed liquid will be greater
at higher operating temperatures. In
this case, however, the system will be
provided with local inhibition, thus
ensuring a safe shut-down.
For different separator operating
conditions, Fig. 2 shows the resulting
condensed liquids when the temperature decreases by –1° C. It is seen that
the temperature has the largest impact
on the resulting amount of condensed
liquids.

assume that the fluid is close to thermodynamic equilibrium with regard to
phase compositions when it reaches the
compressor station.
This means that one can consider the
multiphase fluid entering the separator at the subsea compressor station as
an equilibrium mixture. The gas phase
leaving the separator will be at the
dewpoint for both hydrocarbon liquid
and water. The liquid phases leaving the
separator will be at their boiling points.

Refiners can execute
many projects at a lower
cost and in less time
using a “design-build”
approach that bypasses
the front-end engineerRefining
ing and design (FEED)
package.
Refinery managers should take a
fresh look at how they evaluate and execute new projects due to dramatic increases
in operating
margins and
asset values of
refining companies. The current
economic environment requires refiners
to rethink the traditional approach of
evaluating and executing projects.
Refiners should expend much more
effort in the initial stages of project
development to ensure they select the
best project for execution. Those projects selected for execution should either
strategically fit the refiner’s core business or meet a higher selection standard
than the customary standard used for
projects that are a strategic fit.
We believe current industry practices

regarding development and execution
of projects rose from leaner times and
are no longer the “blueprint” for future
projects.

Background

During the past 20 years, refiners
have approached projects, for the most
part, in a singular manner. Refinery
or corporate staffs defined the basic
process facilities to be added. They then
contracted with an engineering firm
to develop a FEED package from which
bids were obtained from engineering,
procurement, and construction (EPC)
contractors. A definitive cost estimate
was then prepared and the project was
either approved, canceled, or placed on
hold.
In most cases in which the project
went forward, the refiner used a rather
extensive project-controls mechanism
to track project cost even when lump
sum, turnkey (LSTK) contracts were in
place with the EPC contractors.
The significant time and engineering
resources used to ensure that the project
was executed according to the FEED
package and within the predicted cost
was deemed necessary due to the economic environment during the 1990s.
In the 1990s, refined product supply

may have run its course. Even though
distillation capacity continues to rise
slowly, utilization appears to have

Strategic importance
Projects that fall outside a refiner’s
core business, even if they appear to
add value, should be carefully considered relative to competing options that
may be a better fit. Although the lack of
strategic value should not disqualify a
good project, it should force the project
to meet a high standard for approval,

including a thorough, and possibly
independent, assessment of any overlooked or rejected alternatives.
Perhaps no better example of the
importance of strategic fit is the major
addition by a nonfuels, inland refinery
that occurred in the early 1990s. The refinery staff was determined to add processing units to convert certain salable
by-products into transportation fuels.
The staff considered these streams to be

undervalued by its current customers.
The proposed project cost about
five times the fair market value of the
existing refinery and it did not enhance
the refinery’s non-fuels core business.
In addition, the project team adopted
a narrow “Case A” vs. “Case B” evaluation methodology that did not consider
different commercial options nor the
acquisition of another regional refinery

A few years after the project was
completed, the refinery closed. It has
since been restarted by a different company after being purchased for a minor
sum. The facilities added in this project,
however, remain idle with no firm plan
in place to restart them.

Although the projected economic
benefit was reasonable, it was based on
a predicted price differential for a new
product (low-sulfur diesel) relative to
the price for high sulfur off-road diesel
and heating oil. The project team evidently ignored the fact that the refinery
was pipeline connected to the primary
common carrier serving the Northeast
heating oil market and that production
of on-road diesel was not required at
the team’s location.
The project was canceled, a decision

Between January 2008
and the end of secondquarter 2009, 29 pipeline and LNG terminal
projects are scheduled
to be completed in and
Pipelines
around the Southeast USGulf Coast.
These projects represent pipeline
capacity and LNG sendout additions
totaling 25.4 bcfd. For purposes of this
analysis, the projects are segmented into
four groups:
• Inbound projects bringing natural
gas into the region. These seven projects are increasing capacity from major
domestic producing regions into the
Southeast-gulf. Fig. 1 shows inbound
projects increasing deliverability into
the region by 6.6 bcfd during this time.
• Outbound pipeline projects
transporting natural gas through the
region. These five projects (totaling 4.2
bcfd) either increase capacity west-toeast across the region or are designed
to facilitate such movement by other
pipelines (Fig. 1). Most of these projects
are positioned to move gas out of the
region, but downstream constraints on
connecting pipelines will frustrate this
intent until 2010 or later when debottlenecking projects start to relieve some
of the downstream issues.
• New LNG terminals bringing supplies into the region. Four new gulfregion LNG terminals will increase LNG
sendout capacity by 7.1 bcfd. Although
it is unlikely these facilities will see
more than a few nominal cargoes in the

near term, the potential for additional
internationally sourced supplies into the
region is enormous.
• West-of-region expansions, feeder
projects. During the 18-month timeframe of this analysis, 13 projects are
scheduled to expand capacity out of
the highest-growth producing regions
by 7.4 bcfd (Fig. 2). These projects will
bring either gas to inbound pipeline
projects
described
above,
relieve
constraints
out of
producing areas, or achieve some combination of these objectives.
Figs. 1-2 show projects increasing
inbound capacity and potential LNG
deliveries into the Southeast-gulf far
exceed incremental capacity to move
gas across the region. Through the
18-month horizon of this analysis, it
becomes apparent there is little synchronization between in-service dates
of inbound and outbound projects.
Net capacity additions to the region
will come in successive waves, with an
increment of inbound capacity coming
online in one timeframe and a lesser increment of outbound capacity coming
online at a later date.
The first article of this two-part
series (OGJ, Apr. 28, 2008, p. 57)

expansions. This concluding article

the Fort Worth basin to feed Carthage
and South Texas, reaching as far as the
Houston Ship Channel.
• Energy Transfer Cleburne-to-Tolar
(600 MMcfd). The ETC Cleburne-toTolar expansion is designed to feed
gas from the Fort Worth basin into the
Maypearl-to-Malone expansion and
other parts of the ETC system.
• Cheniere Sabine Pass, Creole
pipeline (2.1 bcfd sendout). Phase I of
Cheniere‘s Sabine Pass LNG facility in
Cameron Parish, La., will be completed
in second-quarter 2008. Phase I will
have 10.1 bcf of LNG storage in three
tanks, each with storage capacity of
160,000 cu m and a sendout rate of 2.1
bcfd.
First approval foresaw connection of
the LNG terminal to four pipelines via
Cheniere’s Sabine Pass Pipeline project.
After approval of its Creole Trail LNG
terminal only 18 miles to the east, however, Cheniere received FERC approval
to merge Sabine Pass Pipeline with its
proposed Creole Trail pipeline. This is a
153-mile, 42-in. line designed to move
gas from the Sabine Pass terminal to
NGPL, Transco, Tennessee, FGT, Bridgeline, TETCO, and Trunkline.
By the end of the quarter, a number
of other projects will enter service (Fig.
5). These include:
• Freeport, Brazoria pipeline (1.5
bcfd sendout). Freeport LNG lies about
70 miles south of Houston on Quintana
Island. The first phase of development
will have sendout capacity of 1.5 bcfd.
At start-up, ConocoPhillips will hold
500 MMcfd. On Sept. 30, 2009, ConocoPhillips’ capacity will increase to 1
bcfd. The Brazoria Interconnector pipeline transporting gas out of the Freeport
terminal has 2.5 bcfd of capacity and is
connected to Enterprise, TETCO, FGT,
Channel, Kinder Morgan Tejas, Energy
Transfer, and the Dow-Enterprise DT

Enterprise intrastate system will deliver
up to 1.1 bcfd from the Barnett shale
area into Boardwalk’s Gulf Crossing
project. Devon stands as the primary capacity holder in the system. Enterprise
has the option to acquire up to a 49%
interest in the Gulf Crossing project.
• Cameron LNG, Cameron pipeline
(1.5 bcfd). Sempra’s Cameron LNG
terminal in Hackberry, La. (on the Calcasieu channel in Cameron Parish), will

nections with ANR, Columbia Gulf, and
Sempra’s proposed Port Arthur Pipeline.
Eni SPA holds a 20-year contract for
600 MMcf/d (40%) of the terminal’s
sendout capacity and Suez-Tractebel has
a 20-year agreement for up to 33% of
sendout capacity.
• Boardwalk’s Gulf Crossing pipeline
(1.6 bcfd). Gulf Crossing is Boardwalk’s
355-mile, 42-in. OD interstate pipeline beginning near Sherman, Tex., and
terminating near Tallulah, La. Boardwalk
designed this pipeline to move Barnett
shale, Bossier sand, and Woodford shale
gas to the Perryville area.
This project will increase capacity
into Perryville without a corresponding
increase in capacity out of Perryville.
Boardwalk’s Gulf South subsidiary is
also constructing a 17-mile parallel line
called the Mississippi Loop crossing
Hinds, Copiah, and Simpson counties.
• Texas Gas Fayetteville lateral (800
MMcfd, increasing to 1.1 bcfd). This
Boardwalk project consists of about 165
miles of up to 42-in. OD pipeline with
an initial capacity of 800 MMcfd. The
addition of up to 14,000 hp of compression will increase capacity to 1.1
bcfd. The proposed route of the pipeline
begins in Conway County, Ark., and
extends through Faulkner, Cleburne,
White, Woodruff, St. Francis, Lee, and
Phillips counties in Arkansas, crossing
the Mississippi river near Helena, Ark.,
before interconnecting with Texas Gas
in Coahoma County, Miss. Injecting 1.1
bcfd into the Texas Gas system at this
point will improve capacity out of the
Fayetteville shale.
• Texas Gas Greenville lateral (750
MMcfd). The 95-mile Greenville lateral
will move up to 750 MMcfd from the
Texas Gas compressor station at Greenville, Miss., to an interconnect with
Boardwalk Pipelines’s subsidiary, Gulf
South Pipeline Co., in Attala County,
Miss.
• Golden Pass LNG, Golden Pass
pipeline (2.7 bcfd). Golden Pass LNG is
a joint venture among Qatar Petroleum,
ExxonMobil, and ConocoPhillips. The
facility is 10 miles south of Port Arthur
and 2 miles northwest of Sabine Pass,

Tex., along the Sabine-Neches waterway.
Sendout capacity can average 2 bcfd and
peak at 2.7 bcfd.
The terminal is connected to 11
regional pipeline systems via a new 2.5
bcfd, 75-mile pipeline. An additional
2-mile, 24-in. diameter pipeline will
move gas to ExxonMobil’s Beaumont
refinery. Qatar Petroleum has committed 15.6 million tons/year (2 bcfd) of
LNG to the facility for 25 years.

Second-quarter 2009
Projects entering service during
second-quarter 2009 include:
• MarkWest Arkoma Connector
(500 MMcfd). The 30-in. MarkWest
Arkoma Connector pipeline will extend
about 50 miles from an interconnect
with MarkWest’s gathering system in
the Woodford shale in southeastern
Oklahoma to an interconnect with the
Midcontinent Express pipeline in Bennington, Okla. MarkWest has a onetime right to acquire 10% of MEP after
construction is complete.
• Kinder Morgan Midcontinent
Express—Carthage-to-Perryville (1.4
bcfd). The Midcontinent Express pipeline project is a joint venture among
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners and
Energy Transfer Partners designed to
move gas from the Barnett shale, Woodford shale, Fayetteville shale, Anadarko
basin, Arkoma basin, and Bossier Sands
through Perryville and ultimately to
Transco Station 85.
The project will have an initial capacity of 1.4 bcfd, connecting to NGPL,
Energy Transfer, Columbia Gulf, and
Transco. Midcontinent Express brings
1.4 bcfd into Perryville but moves only
1 bcfd out to Station 85 (Fig. 8). This
mismatch increases pressure on overall
regional capacity. ✦

Farm interests
strain facts to
defend ethanol
Farm interests will say anything to
protect the magic money machine that the
US government has built for them with fuel
ethanol.
They’re hard at it now, as global leaders
awaken to the push biofuels give the price
of food.
In testimony May 1 to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, National Farmers Union Pres. Tom Buis acknowledged

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

that the US ethanol mandate contributes
to the food-price surge but argued that
other factors are more inﬂuential. He listed
$120/bbl oil, the declining value of the US
dollar, increased demand from developing
countries, and global production shortages, especially for wheat, associated with
weather.
So far, so good. No one says government support for ethanol and other biofuels
is the only reason food prices are high.
And there’s room for honest disagreement
about the relative strengths of forces driving up prices.
But the biofuels push is a deliberate act
of government. Hoping to prevent a correction of that mistake, Buis stretched his
argument into a realm that should alarm oil
and gas companies.
“While critics will say our government
is subsidizing and mandating the use of
ethanol,” he said, “the subsidies pale in
comparison to the amount we spend subsidizing the oil companies and protecting the
shipping lanes to import oil from the most
unstable region of the world.”
Oh?
The US will protect shipping lanes no
matter how much oil it imports, so that
point means nothing.
And the bluster about subsidies is false.
Last year, according to the Energy Information Administration, subsidies for oil and
gas totaled $2.149 billion, of which $260
million represented tax breaks for cleanfuel vehicles, not oil and gas companies.
The blenders’ tax credit alone on the 6.5
billion gal of ethanol blended to gasoline
last year was worth $2.92 billion. And ethanol gets other subsidies.
“Instead of cutting the ethanol mandate,
maybe Congress should cut the big oil and
gas subsidies,” Buis said.
Coming from a leader of an industry
that enjoys subsidies estimated by the
Heritage Foundation at $25 billion/year and
favors that raise food prices by a further
$12 billion/year, this is hypocrisy.

OPEC’s position strengthens
Growing demand for crude combined with the slowdown in production of new
supplies in other countries is placing the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in a powerful position, say industry analysts.
“Given the mature characteristics of much of non-OPEC oil production, it does not
appear feasible that non-OPEC countries, as a group, will be able to deliver meaningful oil supply growth in the future. A permanent non-OPEC peak seems likely within
the next 5 years,” said analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc.
“Non-OPEC growth is highly dependent on Russian growth and, given its current
policy environment and recent production declines, Russia would do well to return
to 2-3% growth,” Raymond James analysts said. “Accordingly, the world is likely to
continue in an environment of thin excess capacity for the foreseeable future. Given
this tight supply-demand equation, threats of even minor supply disruptions are
bound to have a large impact on oil prices.”
Adam Sieminski, global energy economist for Deutsche Bank, said, “The oil supply slowdown in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and
the former Soviet Union is leaving OPEC in charge. Global oil supplies are under
pressure from shrinking production prospects in Russia and across a wide swath of
the OECD nations. By deﬁnition, demand equals supply, and although we think that
demand is rising despite the economic slowdown, supply is struggling to keep up.”
Energy conservation in the US and the OECD has not been sufﬁcient to offset
demand increases in other parts of the world. Global demand for oil grew by 1.1 million b/d in 2007, while the average of the four estimates for 2008 growth is 1.2 million
b/d, according to Deutsche Bank.
“The world has been depending on supply growth from the FSU and other nonOECD countries. Russian production growth has tapered off, biofuel growth is likely
to be under pressure from rising concerns about food and environmental impacts,
and continuing declines are expected in the OECD,” said Sieminski. “Based upon
the average estimates we have used here, non-OPEC Africa and Latin America offer
some hope for oil supply growth, but not enough to offset the likely rising dependence on OPEC.”
Natural gas outlook
Meanwhile, the US Department of Energy report released Apr. 30 “showed
US gas production screaming upward, increasing year-to-year by an astounding
5.8 bcfd, although we estimate 1 bcfd was taken ofﬂine last year due to wellhead
freezes,” said Raymond James analysts. “Given the acceleration since last October,
driven by exploding growth in resource play activity (Barnett shale), when will the
market pull its head out of the sand and start paying attention to this key fundamental driver?” Sieminski said, “The real picture for US natural gas supply and demand
is complicated and not as bearish as the February wet gas production jump suggests. We remain bullish.” He said DOE analysts have been forecasting that US gas
production is likely to ﬂatten out in 2008 at a level slightly below January’s estimated
output of 54.7 bcfd of dry gas.
The surprise February increase in wet gas “suggests that dry gas production in February might be some 1.2 bcfd higher than [DOE’s] Energy Information Administration’s
estimate of 54.5 bcfd. We believe that there are several good reasons to be cautious
about jumping to conclusions about a jump in US gas production” said Sieminski.
Although the Rockies Express pipeline start-up in mid-January (now ﬂowing
about 1 bcfd) may be responsible for some of the February gains, the Independence
Hub accident in mid-April is temporarily pulling 1 bcfd off the market, he noted.
Further more, said Sieminski, “A jump of 1 bcf in production from January to February seems very implausible in view of the leveling off of the rig count in the third quarter of 2007.” He said, “Even if supplies did build consistently by 1 bcfd, that must have
been offset by rising demand (or lower imports) because the supply-demand balances
can be observed in the storage data, and that is inconsistent with a big supply jump.”
The EIA reported May 1 the injection of 86 bcf of natural gas into US underground
storage during the week ended Apr. 25. That put the amount of working gas in storage at 1.37 tcf, down 255 bcf from year-ago levels and 3 bcf below the 5-year average
for the time of year.
US crude inventories shot up 3.8 million bbl to 319.9 million bbl in the week
ended Apr. 25. US gasoline stocks fell 1.5 million bbl to 211.1 million bbl. US distillate
fuel inventories gained 1.1 million bbl to 105.8 million bbl.

Managing, optimizing drilling fluids a
challenge with deeper drilling

M

anaging drilling ﬂuids economically and optimizing their effectiveness while still keeping those
operations environmentally benign can be among
the trickiest balancing acts operators and drilling
contractors face today.
Those drilling ﬂuids challenges are getting tougher as industry plunges into ever-deeper waters and penetrates everdeeper formations.

Specialized applications

high-performance water-based muds (HPWBM) are designed
to emulate the performance attributes of invert-emulsion
systems. The need for environmentally safe and technically
equivalent, water-based alternatives to emulsion systems is
increasingly becoming an important consideration in the drilling ﬂuid selection process. Baker Hughes Drilling Fluids was
the ﬁrst service company to introduce HPWBM, starting with
the AQUA-DRILL System, based on cloud-point glycols, in the
early 1990s.
“We have continually researched technology to constantly improve high performance water-based muds. New

SUCCEEDING In A Changing Environment
As the industry shifts to deeper water, the environment in
which we work becomes more complex, hazardous and
expensive. Successful companies recognize early the
changing conditions and environmental challenges facing
the industry. At the Deepwater Operations Conference &
Exhibition in 2008, participants and attendees will discuss
how to succeed under these extreme conditions.
The seventh Deepwater Operations Conference & Exhibition
will be held on November 4 – 6, 2008 in Galveston, Texas

and will see a return to the luxurious Moody Gardens Hotel
and Conference Center.
Plan to attend, sponsor and exhibit at the 2008 conference
and exhibition as the technical focus shifts to “Succeeding
in a Changing Environment.” As with our past conferences,
proceedings will not be published and the press will not be
invited to assure conﬁdentiality between the attendees and
the speakers allowing the most up–to–date information to
be shared.

ing products to aid in reducing the ﬂuid loss properties of
these systems, but we are also looking at ways to make our
seepage and lost circulation additives capable of withstanding these environments. Thus far, we have relied on organic
materials for many of our additives, but these organic materials can have a weakness: thermal degradation. Our goal
has been, and continues to be, ﬁnding ways to extend the
temperature and pressure range of our existing products and
developing new products capable of performing as well as
our existing products, in these harsh complex environments,
at which I’m happy to say, we’ve been pretty successful.”
Drill-in ﬂuids comprise another area that Turbo-Chem has
been investigating.
“These drill-in-ﬂuids, such as Formates, for example, are
basically solids-free systems,” Verret notes. “While these solids-free systems are very formation friendly, this solids-free
state creates a dilemma for the operator. What to do when lost
circulation occurs with ﬂuids that cost $900/bbl or greater? We
are looking at a number of materials and chemistries that will
be able to prevent or control losses without compromising the
formation friendliness of these types of ﬂuids.”
As the wells have become more complicated, the drilling
ﬂuids have followed suit, Verret contends.
“Things are no longer simple, and it’s taken some cuttingedge science to get drilling technology to where it is today,”
he says. “We’ve had to follow this lead here at Turbo-Chem as
well. No longer is it simply putting bagasse or sawdust in the
drilling ﬂuid to stop lost circulation. We’ve had to apply quite a
bit of science in our ﬁeld.
“With all of the new technology has come new opportuni-

ties to learn what we are actually dealing with downhole. With
MWD, LWD, PWD, and all the other ‘WDs,’ we now have a
better idea of what we are up against when it comes to wellbore stability and lost circulation issues. We’ve even got actual
downhole photographs and videos available, which actually allow us to see the types and size of the fracturing occurring
in vertical, directional, and horizontal wells, through various
formation types…I believe we’re just in the infancy stages
of many of these emerging technologies. Just 10 years ago
MWD was considered voodoo by many, but today almost no
one drills a well without it.”

Efficiencies
The most expensive and most difﬁcult to control commodity in
the entire drilling arena is time, contends Verret.
“Time isn’t getting any cheaper either. There are many time
bandits in the drilling of a well, and several that are directly
related to the hole, such as rate of penetration, seepage loss
or lost circulation, tripping in or out of the hole, etc. As the
operators drill deeper, the time cost of these activities rises
almost exponentially. That’s the real value of the products and
services we market. If we can save the operator downtime or
help expedite a process, then we’ve put money back into the
operator’s drilling budget, which then can be used to drill additional wells. The research and product development that we
do is juxtaposed with time. Not only do we need to determine
how does what we are adding to the drilling ﬂuid affect the
mud and wellbore, but is this effect going to save time? If we
can capture all of these in a single product, then we’ve hit an
R&D home run.” ]

Produced water management:
controversy vs. opportunity

O

ne of the most controversial areas of oil and gas
production operations today is the handling, treatment, and disposal of produced water.
The oil and gas producing industry generates
tens of billions of barrels of produced water every year along
with the hydrocarbons it recovers, and with that practice
comes mounting concerns about waste and contamination of
water.
“The world’s population has insatiable demands for two
equally precious commodities, potable water and fossil fuels,” notes Doug Biles, president and CEO of Wescorp Energy Inc. “Unfortunately, the pursuit of one always seems
to be at odds with the pursuit of the other. The perception

exists that the demand for fossil fuels comes at the expense
of the supplies of potable water in particular and the overall
environment in general.
“Put this together with the perception of the petroleum
industry as one willing to waste valuable water supplies in its
pursuit of massive proﬁts at the expense of the environment
and you quickly realize how this subject becomes very emotional, very quickly, and very public.”

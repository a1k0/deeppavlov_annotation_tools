Many service companies, including Weatherford International Ltd.,
are partnering with national oil companies and independents in
central Europe to help revitalize this important producing region.
The Romanian oil industry, once Europe’s primary oil producer,
is managed by two state-owned companies that oversee what is
essentially a giant brownfield development (photo from Weatherford; by Salvo Photography 2006). This issue’s special report on
completion methods begins on p. 49 with a discussion of BP’s recent installation of subsea multiphase pumps at a record-breaking
1,700 m water depth. A second article, beginning on p. 52, focuses
on a new ultrasonic leak-detection logging tool that can detect
tubing or casing leaks as small as 0.0024 gpm. Coiled tubing is
increasing in use for well completions, either as wellbore tubulars
or as a means for conveying completion equipment. In the photo
above, new CT reels are ready at Stewart & Stevenson’s engineered
products division in Houston (photo by Nina M. Rach).

What is
reliability worth?
Overcoming
flow-convergence issues
with maximum
near-wellbore
conductivity.

Industry Challenge
• Improve sustained production
• Consistently create fractures in cased and cemented horizontal wellbores
• Optimize frac design
• Overcome flow-convergence issues, especially in near-wellbore region
Halliburton Solution
CobraMax® H fracturing service (with Hydra-JetSM service through coiled
tubing for perforating) uses a proppant pack as the final stage of each
fracture treatment. Major benefits include:
• Performing multiple-interval treatments individually
• Eliminating the need for packers or separate trips in the hole
• Providing diversion for successive treatments up the hole
Operator Benefit
Halliburton’s CobraMax H service achieved maximum conductivity in the
near-wellbore region. With this service, risk was lowered and completion
costs per BOE reduced (up to 50% lower when compared with
conventionally fractured horizontal wells).
To learn more about how Halliburton puts reliability in action,

Interest

Venezuela ofﬁcials take issue with OPEC ﬁgures
Venezuelan Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez as well as other country
officials have taken issue with the latest oil production quota figures
published by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
On its web site, OPEC’s figures reduce Venezuela’s quota ceiling
to 2.47 million b/d in November, some 750,000 b/d lower than
the 3.22 million b/d allotted earlier in September.
Ramirez said there is confusion and manipulation in the figures
because, under OPEC’s quota system, Venezuela is allocated 11.5%
of the organization’s total output. He said any change in the system
of quotas would require a resolution by OPEC’s ministers.
Venezuela’s new production limit represents 9% of OPEC’s
27.25 million b/d in total production—a figure that is in line with
estimates by independent analysts and oil organizations concerning the level of Venezuela’s actual output.
Paris-based International Energy Agency, among other secondary sources of information, pegs Venezuela’s output at 2.4 million
b/d. In his criticism of OPEC’s figures, Ramirez said they reflect
information based on such secondary sources.
Carlos Ramones, Venezuela’s vice-minister of finance, also expressed surprise about the OPEC decision, saying the ministry will
review the change for the 2008 budget. “You can’t reduce that
many barrels to the quota [ceiling.] This will be reviewed because
we have to set an oil production level for the [2008] budget,” he
said. The OPEC figures also might come as an embarrassment to
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who as recently as Sept. 16 announced plans to increase his country’s oil production to 5 million
b/d in 2012 from the current 3.2 million b/d (OGJ Online, Sept.
19, 2007).

Kashagan issues not to be politicized, leaders say
Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev and Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, meeting on the sidelines of a recent United
Nations meeting, said the situation regarding the Kashagan oil
project should not be politicized.
The informal agreement came even as Kazakhstan’s lower house
of parliament unanimously passed legislation allowing the government to break oil contracts in the name of “national security.”
“Prodi and Nazarbayev believe that politics should not be
involved in this,” said Yerlan Bayzhanov, Nazarbayev’s press secretary. “This is a matter of business and cooperation between

specific business circles.”
Bayzhanov said, “Prodi expressed a wish that his forthcoming
visit to Kazakhstan in October would not be linked with this issue,”
referring to the disagreement between his country’s government
and a consortium led by Italy’s Eni SPA.
The legislation passed by the Kazakh lower house of parliament
will increase the government’s leverage in ongoing talks with Eni
over the future of the stalled Kashagan oil project.
In a unanimous vote, lawmakers in the lower house passed
amendments to the country’s subsoil law that allow the government to force retrospective changes to any existing oil contracts or
even break the contracts altogether if they are deemed “a threat” to
the country’s national security.
With the upper house of parliament also stacked with loyal
members of the president’s party, according to analyst Global Insight, the new legislation is likely to sail through that house shortly
and quickly be signed into law by the Kazakh president ahead of
his October meeting with Prodi.

Kazakh ofﬁcial eases Kashagan demands
Meanwhile, Kazakhstan reported it could drop its demand
that state-run KazMunaiGas become joint operator of Kashagan
field, according to a senior official who added that the government has no plans to revise contracts of other international oil
companies.
Kazakh Energy Minister Sauat Mynbayev Oct. 2 said, “The question of Kazakhstan’s role in the project as a co-operator is part and
parcel of the negotiating process.” He said Kazakhstan would not
approve the development plan and budget of the consortium led
by Eni SPA in their present forms (OGJ Online, Oct. 1, 2007).
As for environmental complaints lodged by the Kazakh Environmental Protection Ministry and the Kazakh Emergency Situations
Ministry against the Eni group, Mynbayev said he saw no reason in
them to suspend work on the project as a whole.
“The consortium accepted a part of the complaints, and it is
currently in the process of rectifying them. We do not see any reasons to suspend the project because of the environment. The Environmental Protection Ministry and the consortium are reaching
an agreement,” he said. He also said the government of Kazakhstan
has no intention of revising contracts with foreign producers that
honor the country’s laws. ✦

The offshore development, the first BP-operated asset in Angola,
is comprised of five fields: Galio, Cromio, Paladio, Plutonio, and
Cobalto. BP made its first discovery on the block in 1999-2001 in
1,200-1,450 m of water. The area’s final development plan calls
for 43 wells—20 producers, 20 water injectors, and 3 gas injectors—which will be connected by a large subsea system to a floating production, storage, and offloading vessel.
The FPSO has a storage capacity of 1.77 million bbl of oil, a
processing capacity of 240,000 b/d of oil, and gas handling of as
much as 400 MMscfd of gas. The vessel, which has a treated water
injection rate of 450,000 b/d, is held in position by 12 mooring
lines connected to anchor piles on the seabed.
The subsea system includes the longest single riser tower system of its kind in the world, BP said. At 1,258 m, it connects the
FPSO to a network of subsea flowline and control systems that include 150 km of flowlines, 9 manifolds, and 110 km of instrument
and control umbilicals. Many components of the subsea systems, as
well as the riser tower, were made in Angola, including six of the
subsea manifolds along with the worlds largest CALM (Catenary
Anchor Leg Mooring) offloading buoy and the first ever Angolan
assembled and tested subsea trees.
Several Angolan technicians and engineers are being trained to
operate and support the Greater Plutonio development area in an
ongoing 5 year development program, BP said.
BP and Sonangol Sinopec International Ltd. each hold equal interest in Block 18.

The 7-year contract will help Saudi Arabia maintain its oil production capacity. Saudi Aramco has two 3-year options to renew
the deal.
“A minimum workload is guaranteed during the first 4 years of
the agreement,” Saipem said. “[Work will consist of] 16 platforms
and 80 km of sea lines, in addition to the lay of the cables, ancillary
to the platforms.”
Aramco periodically will confirm the scope of subsequent work
to be executed, valued on the base of a “price-per-unit” agreed
scheme. Fabrication will be carried out in a yard under construction in Dammam, 400 km east of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The Castoro
II vessel will carry out offshore activities.
Aramco plans to allocate budget in the fourth quarter.

GDF, Vattenfall plan CO2 pilot in Germany

In a move it claims is consistent with its sustainable development policy, Gaz de France has signed a cooperation agreement
with Germany’s Vattenfall Group for a carbon dioxide pilot project
in Germany.
Erdgas Erdol GMBH Berlin, GDF’s wholly owned exploration
and production affiliate, will use CO2 to enhance gas recovery from
its nearly depleted Altmark gas field—the second largest onshore
field in Europe.
The project will take 15 months to implement and will contribute to GDF’s research program on CO2 capture, injection, and
storage. The partners are involved in a number of European CO2

KNPC eyes 615,000 b/d Kuwaiti reﬁnery for 2012
Kuwait National Petroleum Co.’s (KNPC) board has allocated a
budget of 4 billion (KWD) for a 615,000 b/d refinery it intends to
construct, according to state media.
Official KUNA news agency quoted KNPC Chairman and Managing Director Sami Al-Rushaid as saying that the budget allocated
for its construction was based on “accurate estimates.”
KNPC initially tendered the giant refinery with a budget of $6.3
billion, but was forced to withdraw the tender in February 2006
after the lowest bid came in at $15 billion.
Al-Rushaid said the new contract will be based on a cost-plus
profit margin, which means Kuwait will pay the cost of the project
to the successful bidder plus an agreed profit.
KNPC recently selected 17 international companies to bid for
construction of the facility. The companies include Snamprogetti,
Technip, GS Engineering & Construction Corp., SK Engineering
& Construction Co., Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co.,
Hyundai Heavy Industries, JGC Corp., Petrofac International Ltd.,
and Saipem SA.
Also included are Foster Wheeler Energy, WGI Middle East, Daelim Industrial Co., Daewoo Engineering & Construction, CB&I, Archirodon Construction, and Gulf Leighton LLC. Fluor Corp. also
was reported still in talks for parts of a tender.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
The project will be divided into four major parts: two manufacturing units, utilities and services, storage tanks, and a pier.
Construction is due to start in 12-18 months, with the refinery
to come on stream by the end of first quarter 2012. Completion
was originally planned for 2010. KNPC also plans to modernize
two of its three existing refineries, one at Al-Ahmadi and the other
at Mina Abdullah, taking their combined capacity to 800,000 b/d
from their current 700,000 b/d.
When those two projects are finished, KNPC will close down
the country’s third refinery, at Shuaiba, which has a capacity of
200,000 b/d. The net result will give Kuwait a refining capacity of
1.4 million b/d by 2012.

Japan, Angola discuss reﬁning, oil supply
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) has
entered talks with Angola to build refining facilities in the African
country in exchange for oil supplies in times of emergencies.
A METI delegation in early September met with the country’s
industry minister, Joaquim David, and senior officials at stateowned Sonangol.
No agreements have been reached, according to one Japanese
official who explained that METI hopes to stabilize Japan’s imports

of oil and natural gas by diversifying its suppliers.
Angola’s only refinery is a 39,000 b/d hydroskimming facility
operated by Fina Petroleos de Angola at Luanda.
Angola has become a supplier of interest to a number of countries, including the US, according to a recent report.
“Few African countries are more important to US interests than
Angola,” said the report by the Center for Preventative Action, an
arm of the Council on Foreign Relations, New York.
“Angola’s success or failure in transitioning from nearly 30
years of war toward peace and democracy has implications for the
stability of the US oil supply as well as the stability of central and
southern Africa,” the report said.
Angola on Jan. 1 became a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and is expected to have a production
quota on Jan. 1, 2008. Reports say the amount of the quota will be
decided on Dec. 5 at an OPEC meeting in Abu Dhabi.
In August, Roc Oil Co. Ltd., Sydney, confirmed a significant heavy

oil find with its Massambala-1CH2 sidetrack well on Cabinda South
Block in Angola (OGJ Online, Aug. 30, 2007).

ConocoPhillips, ADM to produce renewable fuel
ConocoPhillips has formed an alliance with agricultural processing firm Archer Daniels Midland Co. to develop technology to
convert biomass into renewable transportation fuels.
The alliance reportedly will spend $10 million/year on the collaborative research of a next-generation biofuel production process that involves the conversion of biomass from crops, wood, or
switchgrass into biocrude, as well as the refining of biocrude to
produce transportation fuel.
ConocoPhillips last April teamed with meat producer Tyson
Foods Inc. to produce diesel from animal fat. For this project, the
major said it would spend $100 million over the next few years
to upgrade several US refineries to enable production of the new
diesel (OGJ Online, Apr. 18, 2007). ✦

Tr a n s p o r t a t i o n
Petrobras to spend $7.5 billion on gas transport
Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) plans to spend more than
$7.5 billion in natural gas transportation-related projects between
now and 2012. Projects include more than 4,560 km of pipelines,
10 compressions stations, 31 city gates, and 2 LNG terminals.
Speaking at the Rio Pipeline 2007 Conference & Exhibition,
Celso Luiz Silva Pereira de Souza, Petrobras’s manager of natural
gas planning, implementation, and logistics, said the CampinasRio gas pipeline and the Cacimbas-Vitória section of the Gasene
gas pipeline would both enter operation before yearend, improving gas integration between the southeast and northeast sections
of Brazil.
The Atalaia-Itaporanga and Itaporanga-Pilar gas lines in Brazil’s
northeast will also come on line this year, according to Souza.
Souza said Brazil’s gas market has grown 15%/year since 2001,
driven primarily by industrial and automotive demand. Total 2006
demand stood at 46.3 million cu m/day, expected to increase to
134 million cu m/day by 2012.
Brazil’s gas transportation infrastructure must grow to meet
this demand, but Carlos Felipe Guimaraes Lodi, Petrobras’s general
manager of operational supply planning, sees problems in achieving this growth, including: lack of skilled project managers, delays
in environmental permitting, and difficulty in acquiring storage
spheres and compressors, the delivery lead time of which he currently places at 450 days.

Russia plans Sakhalin Island oil, gas port
The Russian government plans to build a port to export oil and
gas from fields off Sakhalin Island.
Transportation Minister Igor Levitin said the port, planned for
the village of Ilyinsky on Sakhalin Island, will be linked to two
trunk pipelines, one for crude oil and the other for gas. He said the
arrangement will cut the number of pipelines crossing the island.
As a result, there will be lower transportation costs as well as
fewer environmental impacts, he said, adding that the total cost
of the Ilyinsky port will be 10-15% less than the transportation

infrastructure for the Sakhalin-1 and Sakhalin-2 projects. Ilyinsky
port will be open year-round to shipping, without the need for icebreakers, unlike the port of De-Kastri, which in the ice season requires two icebreakers for every 100,000-tonne tanker shipment.
The project will require investment of 82 billion rubles, according to expert estimates. The figure includes roughly 37 billion rubles in state investment and 45 billion rubles from other sources.

Russian ofﬁcial assures China on spur line
Russia will abide by its understandings to build a crude oil pipeline spur from Skovorodino in the Russian Far East to the border
with China, according to Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexander
Zhukov.
At a Sept. 28 meeting of a Russian-Chinese commission, Zhukov noted that Russian and Chinese companies have signed several
energy agreements over the past few years.
“It is pleasant to note that all these understandings are implemented on time,” he said. “This also applies to the SkovorodinoChinese border oil pipeline project.”
The statement followed remarks by Rosneft Deputy Pres. Dmitry
Bogdanchikov that Russia should restrict the amount of oil it plans
to transport to China via the projected Eastern Siberia Pacific Ocean
line (OGJ Online, Sept. 18, 2007).

Construction starts on California LNG plant
Construction has begun on California’s first large-scale LNG
production plant in the Mojave Desert about 75 miles northeast of
Los Angeles, said Clean Energy Fuels Corp., Seal Beach, Calif.
The plant will have an initial production capacity of 160,000
gpd, which will be expanded to 240,000 gpd. The plant’s LNG
storage capacity will be 1.5 million gal. Commercial shipments are
scheduled to begin in the second half of 2008.
Tanker trailers will deliver the LNG, which will be used as fuel
for vehicles, to customers throughout California and the US Southwest. Natural gas vehicles emit significantly less greenhouse gas
and pollution than vehicles fueled by diesel or gasoline. ✦

Comments abound
API’s study’s findings made their way
to the web site R-Squared Energy Blog,
an energy-focused discussion web log
authored by Robert Rapier (http://i-r_______
squared.blogspot.com). Rapier holds a
_______________
master’s degree in chemical engineering
from Texas A&M University and recently
left Montana for an assignment in Scotland, where he maintains the personal
blog site.
R-Squared readers left comments
about Rapier’s Sept. 18 entry that highlighted the study. Few of those leaving
comments were surprised by the study’s
findings.
One reader noted that he wouldn’t
want to “stick it to Big Oil” but would
“be content if they got no more or less
special treatment than any other energy
company.”
Another reader commented that
those unhappy about Big Oil’s high
profits should dig into their own pockets to buy a piece of a big oil company.
These are valid points, as were those
left by many dozens of other R-Squared
readers, but probably not the typical
thinking of average Americans. Were
these blog readers in attendance at the
aforementioned party, no doubt they
could hold their own in any emotionally charged conversation about “sticking it” to Big Oil.
Then those party-goers enraged by
gasoline prices and oil company profits—particularly those whose mutual
fund shares are growing in value—
would come to learn that Big Oil, it
seems, has many Little Owners. ✦

Security vs. insecurity
Security of demand, the rising concern of oil
producers, links inevitably with security of supply,
a worry of consumers. An official of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries Secretariat
repeated this verity of the oil trade at a press conference in Vienna last month. Consuming nations
should heed the message. OPEC members should,
too.
OPEC members, pointed out Mohamed Hamel,
head of the Energy Studies Department, are investing more than $120 billion in at least 120 projects
to boost crude oil production capacity in 2012 by
5 million b/d. They’re also investing more than
$60 billion to raise refining capacity by more than
3 million b/d in the same period. Hamel said the
investments show OPEC’s commitment to stability

Morales received counsel from Hugo Chavez, president of Venezuela, an OPEC founding member.
The Venezuelan strongman is of course evangelizing his socialist populism throughout Latin
America, buying political support with cut-rate
crude and chasing international capital away
from Venezuelan oil and gas fields. Like Morales
in Bolivia, Chavez is gutting his country’s oil and
gas producing industry, which is of course much
larger than Bolivia’s and takes longer to show the
wear. His talk about raising Venezuelan production
capacity to 5 million b/d by 2012, while foreign
oil companies are leaving or slashing investments,
is laughable. Even OPEC tacitly acknowledges

With biofuels likely to become a
global industry by 2012, companies
that emerge as leaders will have to be
nimble and develop flexible strategies to
negotiate inherent market uncertainties.
Accenture reached that conclusion
in a recent report entitled “Irrational
Exuberance? An assessment of how the
burgeoning biofuels market can enable
high performance: a supply perspective.” The report
examines future
scenarios for biofuels
production, processing, and distribution.
Diversity of transportation fuels will
be a fundamental
change for the oil industry in the coming decade, said Melissa Stark, Accenture
senior executive in the energy practice
in London. She wrote the report after an
Accenture team analyzed 20 countries.
“As the global supply market
emerges, it is difficult to see who will
come out the winners,” Stark said.
“Governments are the biggest players in
the emerging biofuels market. It is the
government that determines the profitability.”
Energy-consuming countries—particularly the US, China, India, and Europe—are eager to diversify fuel supply.
Stark noted government politics will
remain dominated by domestic priorities such as energy security, agriculture,

and the environment.
Biofuels feedstock choice will reflect
local supply opportunities, said the
Accenture report, which compared
feedstocks worldwide. Sugarcane was
the only feedstock scoring high on all
Accenture’s criteria. Even if cellulosic
ethanol fulfills its promises, sugarcane
will remain competitive (see table).
“In order for policy-makers, farmers,
agribusiness, and producers to create a
global supply for biofuels, the choice of
feedstock needs to be weighed against
production costs, fossil energy balance,
land availability for yield, and the size
of the global feedstock market,” Stark
said.
Accenture analyzed four categories
of biofuels producers: farmer (cooperative) producers, agribusiness-agriculture supply chain and food producers,
international oil companies (IOCs) and
national oil companies (NOCs), and
independents.

OECD report questions beneﬁts of subsidies for biofuels
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
Governments subsidizing biofuels could support a fuel that is more
expensive and more environmentally
harmful than its corresponding petroleum product, a group in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development said in a report issued
from Paris.
“The current push to expand the
use of biofuels is creating unsustainable tensions that will disrupt markets
without generating environmental beneﬁts,” said a September report entitled,
“Biofuels: Is the Cure Worse than the
Disease?”
The overall environmental harm
from ethanol and biodiesel easily can
exceed those of petroleum products
when increased fertilizer use, biodiversity loss, and agricultural pesticides
associated with biofuels are taken into
account, the report said.
Meanwhile, the volume of imported
fossil fuels displaced by a country’s
domestically produced biofuels will
be small in most cases, said the report
issued by the OECD’s Round Table on
Sustainable Development (OGJ, Sept.
24, 2007, p. 17).
“What’s more, an augmented bio-

has the potential to convert biofuels net
importers, such as the US and China,
into net exporters.
“In general, technology will continue to improve the economics of biofuels development, but it is still uncertain where and to what scale,” Stark
said. “Cellulosic ethanol is the most
obvious and anticipated, but significant
advancements could be made in processing costs.”

Oil industry’s role
IOCs and NOCs own the existing
fuels distribution infrastructure that the
biofuels industry wants. But biofuels

fuels market will tend to increase the
positive relation between oil prices
and biofuels costs,” it said. Higher oil
prices increase agricultural production
costs and consequently raise biofuels
production costs because feedstocks
become more expensive.
Without subsidies, most biofuels
cannot compete on price with petroleum products throughout most of
the world, said report authors Richard
Doornbosch and Ronald Steenblik.
Biofuels are not the only competition
for traditional petroleum products. Oil
from tar sands and coal-to-liquid fuels
also will vie for market share.

Government policies
analyzed
“Government policies play a large
role in the ﬁnancial attractiveness of
biofuels production and trade,” the
report said. “Quantifying and assessing
these policies is not an easy task.”
Subsidies directly linked to output
include protection from foreign competition by tariffs on ethanol and biodiesel, exemptions from fuel-excise taxes,
and tax credits related to the volume
produced, sold, or blended.
Regulations mandating usage or
blending percentages and fuel-tax pref-

transportation and marketing represent
“a direct cannibalization” of the oil
industry’s gasoline and diesel volumes,
Stark said.
“For IOCs, their big decision is
whether to buy into the fast-moving
and increasingly expensive and crowded first-generation market or continue
with their strategies of investing in second-generation technology research,”
Stark said.
First-generation biofuels are made
from food crops. Second-generation
biofuels are made from nonfood feedstocks, such as waste from agriculture
and forestry. When commercialized,

erences stimulate production directly
as well.
The leading OECD countries producing crop-based ethanol apply a
most-favored nation (MFN) tariff that
adds at least 25% or 14¢/l. to the cost of
imported ethanol. That’s often enough
to discourage imports of cheaper, foreign-produced ethanol.
The US charges a 2.5% ad valorem
tariff plus an additional 14.3¢/l. secondary duty for fuel ethanol vs. ethanol
destined for beverages and other end
uses. The European Union applies a
lower MFN tariff of €0.00192/l. on pure
ethanol and €0.00102/l. on denatured
ethanol.
Taxes and subsidies also can be
used to discriminate between foreign
and domestic production. Australia has
a 27¢/l. excise duty on imported ethanol. Worldwide, biodiesel is subject to
much lower tariffs than ethanol.
The sustainable development report
suggested governments encourage
lower transportation fuel demand
rather than encouraging biofuels production.
“A liter of gasoline or diesel conserved...is a full liter of gasoline or diesel saved at a much lower cost to the
economy than subsidizing inefﬁcient
new sources of supply,” the report said.

the cost of second-generation biofuels
could be more comparable with gasoline and diesel than are first-generation
biofuels.
“For NOCs, the key questions are
around growing and integrating this
new business into their downstream
businesses and managing new stakeholders from the agriculture sector
(including government agriculture
departments),” Stark said.
IOCs and NOCs will influence how
quickly and easily the biofuels market
expands, Stark said.

the biggest investors in second-generaOil & Gas Journal / Oct. 8, 2007

these technologies becomes commercial, these players have the resources
and capability to scale quickly, shifting
the supply curve of the market.”
She forecasts an increase in mergers
and acquisitions as the biofuels industry becomes more international and
competitive. “We expect consolidation
(independents that serve one country

and that have one to two plants will not
be able to stay competitive),” Stark said.
“This consolidation will happen through
either the merging of independents or
the acquisition of independents by IOCs
and NOCs or agribusiness.”
Alliances and joint ventures will
help biofuels producers grow, access
markets, and share risks. She foresees
continuing diversity as companies

refine investment strategies and their
partnering skills to better access markets
and financing.
So, although the potential and the
costs of producing ethanol, biodiesel,

Stark said the big message to the oil

The investigation found that the
auditors did not follow either MMS or
DOI reporting requirements in any of
the four cases. “Again, however, systemic communications failure exasperated
the relators’ fundamental distrust that
their management chain would proceed
appropriately,” Devaney said.
The IG said courts have ruled that
government employees were not
precluded from suing based on facts
learned during the course of their official duties. “Our findings concerning
the use of official and/or proprietary
information remain inconclusive,” he
said, primarily because of dated, vague
policies and rules, and poor document
control,” Devaney said.
In considering 18 allegations of

retaliation against the auditors ranging
“from trivial to troubling,” the investigation found no conclusive evidence
of deliberate retaliation. Reprisals
might have been perceived because
of disconcerting behavior, such as
“management’s manifest inattention to
personnel matters affecting the reassigned relators when MMS management
should have been paying extraordinary
attention.”
Devaney said the investigation’s findings call for improvements in MRM’s
program, particularly in document
control, guidance clarification and treatment, and management of reassigned
relators.
The investigation found four other
issues within MMS’s royalty collections

division that have spawned investigations, involving:
• The acquisition, contract management, and performance of the MRM
Support System, which has cost $149
million since the contract was awarded
Sept. 13, 1999.
• The involvement of three senior
MMS employees in creating a consulting contract leading to jobs for two
of them once they left federal service,
which is a potential violation of procurement laws and regulations.
• Potential criminal conduct and
ethical violations by a senior manager
of MMS’s royalty in-kind program.
• Potential criminal and ethical violation of other employees assigned to
the RIK program. ✦

NGSA sees little upward gas-price pressure this winter
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
High storage levels, steady drilling
rates, and expected warmer-than-normal winter temperatures suggest there
will be minimal upward pressure on
natural gas prices during the coming
US heating season, the Natural Gas
Supply Association said in its annual
forecast.
But the tight markets of the past several years are expected to continue and
could easily be thrown off balance by
any of several variables, outgoing NGSA
Pres. Chris Conway of ConocoPhillips
told reporters.
“We’ve been in a tight market for a
number of years, and we believe that
has become an accepted situation. But
a tight market still can be knocked off
balance fairly easily,” he warned.
Weather risks, such as late-season
hurricanes and cold snaps, are the biggest variable, but markets also can be
affected by conservation and additional
transmission capacity, according to
Conway. Additional pipelines as well as
high drilling rates are responses to high
gas prices.
26

NGSA uses five pressure points—
weather, the general economy, demand,
storage, and supply—to develop its annual heating-season forecast. In its predictions for the 2006-07 period, it said
it was correct in the last three instances
but overestimated weather impacts and
forecast a neutral economy instead of
the decline that occurred.

Pressure point speciﬁcs
The association uses information
from other sources and outside consultants to develop its forecast. It said
that, while the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration expects
the coming heating season to again be
warmer-than-normal overall, NOAA’s
forecast calls for temperatures to be
somewhat lower overall than a year earlier (2% vs. 7% warmer-than-normal).
NGSA said gas demand probably
won’t change much year-to-year as the
general US economy continues the low

Residential users will replace

have been fairly significant additions of
gas-fired generation. I think we’re at the
tail end of that growth,” Conway said.
That situation could change if more
electric utilities cancel plans for coalfired power plants. “NGSA believes the
country needs all sources of electrical
energy—gas, coal, and nuclear included. I can’t say I know what’s going to
happen with coal, but I do see natural
gas playing a major role, particularly in
trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” he said.

NGSA said the US Energy Information Administration estimates that gas
storage inventories at the end of the
2007 injection season will be a record
3.52 tcf, compared with 3.445 tcf a
year earlier. Energy and Environmental
Analysis Inc. (EEA), an ICF International
company, forecasts that an estimated
104 bcf of additional storage capacity
will become available during the 200708 period vs. 24 bcf a year earlier.

Production outlook
NGSA said EEA expects annual well
completions to grow to 30,500 from
29,000 last year, the annual average rig

count to increase to 1,485 from 1,372,
and average winter gas production to
rise to 51.3 bcfd from 50.7 bcfd.
“Producers are continuing to aggressively invest in this stable price environment. At the same time, it’s important
to remember that per well production
rates continue to decline and that more
wells have to be drilled simply to keep
production steady,” Conway said.
The import outlook is mixed, with
purchases of gas from Canada expected
to fall to an average 8.5 bcfd from 7.8
bcfd last year and LNG imports rising
to 2 bcfd from 1.9 bcfd, according to
NGSA.

Overall, said Conway, “We’re
continuing to see pressures on costs.
It’s becoming more expensive to drill
wells, build LNG import terminals, and
construct pipelines and storage facilities.
Unfortunately, at the moment, the tone
in Congress seems to be to penalize the
industry instead of trying to work with
it to develop new supply sources.”
The US economy will require additional and more-diverse energy
supplies, he continued. “As greenhouse
gas legislation is developed, it will be
important to recognize growing pressure on natural gas supplies and address
access questions,” Conway said. ✦

Surgutneftegaz studies oil pipeline expansions
Eric Watkins
Senior Correspondent
Russia’s Surgutneftegaz, entering discussions over the feasibility of
the planned East Siberia Pacific Ocean
(ESPO) pipeline, said it can ensure production of 3 million tonnes/year of oil
for transportation via the line.
Surgutneftgaz has invested about
50 billion rubles in Talakan fields in
northwest Yakutia, where oil will be
30

transported via a 40-km spur to the
main ESPO pipeline. A similar spur will
be laid from its Verkhnechonsk fields in
northern lrkutsk.
The two sets of fields, which have
total estimated reserves of 325 million
tonnes, together will contribute about
10%/year to filling the first phase of
the ESPO line, which will have an initial
annual capacity of 30 million tonnes.
Phase 1 of the ESPO pipeline, from
Taishet in the Irkutsk region to Skovoro-

dino in the Amur region, will begin operation in late 2008, when 15 million
tonnes of oil will be delivered through
a spur from Skovorodino to China and
an additional 15 million tonnes by rail
to Kozmino on the Pacific coast.
In Phase 2 of the ESPO, throughput
capacity of the Taishet-Skovorodino
pipeline will be boosted to 80 million
tonnes and another pipeline, to carry
50 million tonnes, will be built from
Skovorodino to Kozmino. Branches also

will be built to refineries in Khabarovsk
and Komsomolsk-on-Amur. Russia has
long said that the beginning of Phase 2
depends on the results of exploration in
eastern Siberia.
Meanwhile, Russia’s Fuel and Energy
Ministry estimates that Phase 2 could
be commissioned in 2015-17, and in
September, state-run pipeline company
OAO Transneft said it is ready to start
designing Phase 2.

Transneft Chief Executive Officer
Semyon Vainshtok told Russia’s President
Vladimir Putin: “We are now waiting for
a decision of the Cabinet to get down to
the job. We are ready to start the work.”
He said the company has laid more than
1,130 km of pipe, with work under way
on all sections of the route in the Yakutia,
Amur, and Irkutsk regions.
In August Russia’s minister of industry and energy said that Russian Rail-

ways should prepare design estimates
on the construction of Khmilovskiy

Producers warn of harm from Alberta’s royalty proposals
Proposals for increased taxation of
oil and gas production in Alberta have
come under specific criticism from the
producing industry.
In an Oct. 2 speech to the Calgary
Chamber of Commerce, Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers Pres.
Pierre Alvarez challenged “the foundation of the report—the justification
given by the panel for raising taxes and
royalties and their assessment of the
consequences of doing so.”
In an Oct. 3 letter to Alberta Premier
Ed Stelmach, Ron Brenneman, president
and chief executive officer of PetroCanada, said the report by the Alberta
Royalty Review Panel “contains material
flaws in its analysis.”
And on Oct. 2, Jim Buckee, former
chief executive officer of Talisman Energy Inc., Calgary, sent an “open letter”
to Stelmach saying the company might
cut its capital budget by $500 million/
year if the panel’s proposals are implemented.
The late-September report, asserting
that Albertans failed to receive a “fair
share” of benefits from oil and gas production, proposed royalty increases on
most conventional oil and gas and an
added severance tax on bitumen from
oil sands (OGJ, Oct. 1, 2007, p. 25).
Earlier, Encana Corp. said it would
cut 2008 capital investment in Alberta
by $1 billion if the government enacted
the proposals.

32

Justiﬁcation, assessment
Alvarez faulted the royalty report
for considering government take—the
government’s share of income from oil
and gas production—in Alberta in comparison with other producing regions
while ignoring return on investment,
discovery size, production per well, and
production costs.
He cited a recent Tristone Capital
analysis that said, “We have found that
a common theme in the panel’s work is
that the report understates capital and
operating costs, which distorts rates of
return and overestimates economic rent
available to the resource owners and the
producers.”
For example, Alvarez said, the panel
used historic rather than actual costs,
which recently have soared. It thus
estimated the cost of a typical oil sands
project at $4-6 billion, while recent
projects have cost $10-11 billion.
The panel similarly underestimated
costs of gas projects and failed to account for lease bonus bids, which totaled $3.5 billion in 2005-06 and $2.4
billion in 2006-07.
Alvarez also faulted the panel for
suggesting that the government can
increase royalties and taxes by 20%
without causing great economic harm.
“Of course there is going to be an
impact,” he said. “When government
takes more there is less money to be
reinvested in the economy.”
Under the proposals, taxes and
royalties would increase more for oil

sands than for conventional production,
which the panel said would stimulate
conventional activity.
Alvarez challenged that view, pointing out that a panel assertion that royalty would decline for 82% of Alberta’s
gas wells would hold true only at prices
below break-even levels. The wells
represented by the 82% figure account
for only 25-30% of the province’s total
production.
“The most immediate impact and
slowdown will be felt in conventional
gas,” Alvarez said. “This is a sector that
has already been rocked by soft prices
and escalating costs. The downturn you
are seeing in rural Alberta would be
accelerated.”

Fairness issue
In his letter, Petro-Canada’s
Brenneman disputed the judgment that
Albertans don’t receive a “fair share” of
revenue gains accompanying oil and gas
price increases.
In the past 7 years, he said, royalties
on conventional production increased
128%, while industry revenue rose
133%.
Like Alvarez, Brenneman noted that
the panel ignored lease bonuses in its
calculations of government revenue,
considered only royalty rates in its
judgments of competitiveness, and
used an uncompetitive base price as its
reference point for claiming that royalty
would decline for 82% of Alberta’s gas
wells.

overnment interference in any
business is rarely a good thing,
especially when it is the oil and gas
business. Consider the case of Hunt
Oil Co., which apparently has unsettled the views of several governments
about Iraq’s oil industry.
The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), Hunt Oil Co. of the
Kurdistan Region, and Impulse
Energy Corp. recently announced the
signing of a production-sharing contract covering the Duhok, Kurdistan,
area of Iraq (OGJ, Oct. 1, 2007, p.
36).
Iraqi Oil Minister Hussein al-Shahristani was quick to intervene, saying
the deal had no standing with Iraq’s
federal government. Any contracts
agreed with the KRG need to be
approved by the federal authority
before they can be considered legal,
he said.
The Kurds had a ready response.
Indeed, on Sept. 12, the semiautonomous Kurdish government in northern Iraq said that al-Shahristani’s
remarks on Hunt’s agreement with
the Kurds were out of line.

with the KRG.
Deputy Spokesman Tom Casey
said, “These kinds of contracts don’t
contribute to a resolution that is in
the best interest of the Iraqi people,
and they do elevate tensions between
the Kurdish regional government and
the government of Iraq. And to the
extent that they detract from an ability to get a national oil law completed...aren’t particularly helpful.”

Enter King Abdullah

The importance of Iraq’s unity was
also stressed on Sept. 30 by Jordan’s
King Abdullah II, who called for
the preservation of Iraq’s territorial
integrity following talks he had with
visiting Iraqi Vice-President Adil Abdel-Mahdi in the Jordanian capital.
The king called for an agreement
on reconciliation among the leaders
of Iraq’s Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds
to be reached as “a serious step to
maintaining unity and the solidarity
of Iraqis,” which would enable “all
segments of Iraqi society to participate more widely in the political
process.”
King Abdullah, of course, had

Brenneman further said introduction
of a nondeductible severance tax for oil
sands projects “ignores the higher cost
and risk of these megaprojects.” The tax
would have the effect of adding 2-15%
to the base royalty rate, depending on
the oil price.
“The severance tax would make in
situ projects—the recovery method for
80% of Alberta’s oil sands resource—
simply uneconomic,” he said. “Oil
prices, which year-to-date have averaged $80/bbl, would need to be more
than $100/bbl on a sustained basis for
in situ oil sands investments to make
sense with the proposed changes.”
He recommended that Alberta increase royalty rates only when oil and
gas prices exceed current levels; account
for “unique aspects of Alberta’s mature
basin and the resultant returns for investors” in its royalties on conventional
production; retain the net-profit structure for oil sands projects; and phase in
royalty changes so investors have time
to adjust.

Talisman’s cuts
Buckee elaborated on the potential effects of the royalty proposals on
natural gas, which accounts for “the
vast majority of conventional drilling in
Alberta.”
The domestic gas price, he said, is
about $30/boe, which provides little
margin with finding and development
costs at about $20/boe and operating
costs near $10/boe.
Decisions based on the proposed
royalty increase would affect future
drilling, he noted, adding: “You can’t
get royalties from wells that are not
drilled.”
Before the panel published its recommendations, he said, Talisman had
decided to cut next year’s spending by
$500 million “because as much as a
third of our drilling program is marginal at current gas prices.”
Buckee pointed out that “government take can only be seen in the light
of costs and prospectivity.” In a mature
producing theater like Alberta, costs are
high and discoveries are small. At presOil & Gas Journal / Oct. 8, 2007

ent, moreover, gas prices are low.
“Typically, as basins mature, governments reduce the royalty burden to encourage activity and maintain revenue,”
he said.
Most of the money the industry
makes in Alberta “finds its way back
to the people of Alberta by way of
capital expenditures, lease payments,
taxes, salaries, or operating costs,” he
said. “To deter investment in the name
of increasing government take hurts
Albertans.”
Buckee also disputed the royalty
report’s cost assumptions for high-productivity gas wells, which he said are
too low.
“At current gas prices, I believe it
will be difficult for anyone to grow
their natural gas production in Alberta,”
he said. “If you implement these proposals we will see a significant loss of
investment, jobs, taxes, and the loss of
world-class technical expertise.”

and chief executive officer, said: “If
the Royalty Panel’s recommendations
are adopted in full, many of Alberta’s
new and emerging resource plays will
simply not be economically viable.
These new plays would have formed the
foundation for the future of Alberta’s
natural gas production.
“Even without that future gas production growth, under the recommended changes EnCana’s royalties on Crown
lands would effectively double, assuming current gas prices. We will have no
choice but to slow down our Albertabased activity and move investments to

EnCana’s cuts
In a Sept. 28 press release, EnCana
stated, “If adopted in full, the royalty
changes will negatively impact EnCana’s
future investments and operations in
Alberta and will have a widespread
impact on economic activity across the
province.”
The proposed cut in its capital
outlays would represent 30-40% of the
$2.5-3 billion planned for EnCana’s Alberta-based activity. Most of the reductions, the company said, would be to its
natural gas activity “in areas where the
proposed royalty scheme makes those
activities uneconomic or uncompetitive
in its portfolio.”
If the cuts are made, EnCana said it
would reallocate the capital to investments “outside Alberta.”

Eresman continued, “We do not

Alberta’s royalties—changes that reflect
the economic realities of volatile commodity prices, higher costs, and the

discussed construction of the line from
Taishet to Skovorodino, with a spur to
the Chinese border.
Wu is said to have argued that, along
with the pipeline spur, China also
should get special terms and preferences for the oil to be carried along
the line. But the Russians did not agree
and suggested instead that, without a
separate agreement on the prices and
amounts of oil required, no pipeline
could be built.
“Building a pipeline only makes
sense if companies can reach agreement
on prices and oil delivery volumes,”
said Zukhov. “Otherwise,” he said, “the

pipeline’s capacity will be wasted.”
Zhukov further explained: “Oil
supplies should be negotiated between
companies, while an intergovernmental
agreement should regulate precisely the
construction of an oil pipeline.”
While assuring the Chinese that
Russia can meet their demand for oil,
Zhukov said OAO Rosneft is unhappy
with the price at which it is currently
shipping oil to China because it has the
opportunity to “sell oil to the West at a
higher price.”
As a result, he said, “Negotiations
are currently under way with China to
change the oil-price formula so that
supplies to China and in the Western
direction be equally beneficial.”
The Chinese are reported to have
agreed to cover all construction costs
for the pipeline spur from Skovorodino
to the Chinese border but they will have
to negotiate pricing formulas separately
with Rosneft.
Those discussions could be formidable as Rosneft Deputy Pres. Dmitry
Bogdanchikov last month said Russia should restrict the amount of oil
it plans to transport to China via the
projected ESPO line (OGJ Online, Sept.
18, 2007). ✦

Flagship Media Sponsors:

The oil sands of Alberta are undergoing an investment boom worth more than
$100 billion. From 2007 to 2016, the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board
(EUB) projects total real investment in Alberta’s oil sands (surface mining,
upgrading, in situ, and support services to reach Canadian $118 billion.
Output from oil sands is set to rise from about 1.2 million barrels a day to
an expected 3 million b/d by 2016, and perhaps 4 million plus by 2020.
That could make Canada the world’s fourth-biggest oil producer after Saudi
Arabia, Russia and the United States.
Today’s oil pricing levels have made extraction of oil from oil sands much
more attractive than in the past. The reserves in Alberta will support
production for a least the next century. Canada is the new frontier in nonOPEC oil developments.
Don’t miss this opportunity to present your expertise to a powerful, inﬂuential
audience. Join PennWell Petroleum Events in this second year conference and
exhibition. As the boom continues, share your ideas, experiences, technology,
and expertise with major industry players who must react quickly to the rapid
expansion. Plan to present a technical paper at the the second annual Oil Sands
and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition, July 15 – 17, 2008, at
the Calgary TELUS Convention Centre in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

units. What is new, though, is the move
to use SOA more broadly, at an enterprise-wide level. BP is now pursuing
a transformational program to realize
the potential of SOA and enable BP to
achieve new levels of efficiency, speed
to market, and, ultimately, to optimize
our business, both financially and operationally.

Introduction
IT professionals can’t pick up an
industry publication these days without
seeing something about web services or
service-oriented architectures (SOA).
We have all heard intriguing stories
about the vision and value of SOA, and
even Hollywood seems to have heard.
In the movie “Firewall,” a computer
security specialist played by Harrison
Ford can be seen reading a journal on
SOA and web services. There is a good
reason for all this hype.
SOA is an approach to delivering
business solutions through services
(capabilities) that are linked together
by business logic. This approach reflects how a business actually operates
compared to conventional application
development methods. As a result, the
relationship between IT and the business is transformed from consumer/
supplier to collaborating partners.
IT groups in many organizations
have begun experimenting with web
services as the interoperability standard from which to build the future.
They may have undertaken a few pilot
projects to gain a sense of the challenges, costs, and potential benefits of
deploying web services more widely.
They may even have begun adapting,
or “wrapping,” some of their legacy
applications and data stores to use web
service interfaces, based on what they’re
learning from pilot testing.
In many organizations, enthusiasm is
growing about the possibility of moving toward a true SOA—the next-generation IT infrastructure built around
web services, and designed to support
highly flexible, increasingly competitive and cost-effective business process
optimization.

Case study: BP’s real-time
architecture project
BP’s US Onshore Business Unit, built largely through
mergers and acquisitions, had seven different production/operations data capture and storage systems. Then
the business unit developed a new web-based real-time
data monitoring and reporting tool that would be far more
effective than the multiple applications currently in use.

Problem

Come join the Leader in
Precious Metals Refining
and Trading since 1851

The business unit wanted to replace existing software
tools. However, to swap them out for the new application
would require them to rewrite every one of the custom,
point-to-point connections to multiple different data capture systems, and create new interfaces where they did
not yet exist, a potentially massive IT effort.

Solution
BP had launched the Real-Time Architecture Project
(RTAP) in March 2003, utilizing web services to create
highly ﬂexible interfaces based on established and emerging internet standards. The RTAP prototype was pilottested in the US Onshore Business Unit in late 2003-early
2004 to connect a new real-time software application with
multiple legacy data sources. Only one simple web service
interface had to be (re)used to connect to the various
date-sources rather than creating multiple one-off, pointto-point interfaces.

Results
Data access was faster. A greater range of technical
users could access the software from any geographic location. The lifespan of legacy data systems was extended,
preserving investments of hundreds of thousands to
millions of dollars. Future software upgrades will require
less time. Deployment of the RTAP solution in subsequent
BP assets reduced the cost of implementation by c. 25%
per asset. Writing a new RTAP interface took only days vs.
weeks or months to create custom interfaces in the past.
Reuse of the same interface in another asset took only
hours to implement. By the end of 2006, some 22 BP assets had implemented RTAP.

of this article, a discussion of BP’s SOA
maturity model, describes this in some
detail.
3. Definition and support of new
organizational roles, processes, and
governance.
Traditional organization and governance processes can actually block
movement toward SOA. Many aspects
of building, operating, and maintaining composite applications based on a
library of shared “services” fall outside of traditional IT skill sets, which
are usually aimed at developing and
supporting client-server applications
and-or physical infrastructures. Sharing
and reuse of digital assets are essentially
alien both to internal organizations as
well as to external partners and application vendors. To be clear: SOA is not a
natural evolution of current behaviors.
Thus, version control, change management, shared services governance, and
formal reuse initiatives must be defined,
incentivized, and carefully managed to
ensure success.
4. Measurement of service quality
and value.
Often, IT metrics focus only on the
IT aspect of a business solution, such
as server availability. SOA standards, on
the other hand, enable measurement
of actual service quality, which has real
meaning to business subscribers as
well. Quality of Service (QoS) expectaOil & Gas Journal / Oct. 8, 2007

tions and appropriate service level agreements (SLAs) need
to be explicitly defined for various types of business services,
as well as the monitoring and reporting of “new” service
metrics such as “number of reuse instance.” Only by tracking
such metrics can IT and the business begin to determine the
true value of SOA in action.
5. Consistent, multilevel communications.
To ensure that all parties involved actually understand the
vision and SOA migration process, communication programs
must be created to address both IT and the business, and
delivered consistently using a variety of channels.

Blueprint for the bridge
Having established a common and compelling SOA vision,
BP set out to define a “maturity model” that is both practical
and proactive.
In other words, it doesn’t succumb to the vague descriptions typical of so many transformational change programs
(which tend to lose clarity and purpose, especially at the
higher levels). In fact, BP’s model describes the detailed
standards, tools, and governance processes required at each
level of the model and doesn’t just rely on vague statements
that a given level is about some undefined goal of “business
transformation.”
Neither is the BP model a knee-jerk reaction to what the
market may be doing or saying about SOA. Considerable
research, thought, discussion, and iteration went into the
development of BP’s SOA Maturity Model (Fig. 4), which
we’re convinced will enable deployment of SOA in clear,
rigorously-defined, incremental steps.
The five levels defined in BP’s model provide a conservative and comprehensive framework with guidelines for managers to assess the evolving SOA capabilities of staff, projects,
a segment of the business, the whole global organization—
even partners and vendors.
This model is based on the Carnegie Mellon Software
Engineering Institute’s Capability Maturity Model (CMM)
(see sidebar, p. 46). The CMM suggests that corporations can
achieve progressive improvements in their organizational
maturity through “evolutionary steps rather than revolutionary innovations.”
In the BP model, as in the CMM, each maturity level
forms a necessary foundation on which the next level is
built. Levels, therefore, cannot be skipped without risking
failure or unnecessary waste of time and money.
Without systematically defining the processes, implementing the standards, and adopting the common services
required at lower levels, individual projects attempting to
move up too quickly may have to rip and replace some or all
of their work as the broader infrastructure matures.
If, for example, a project tries to jump to Level Three
(Process Orchestration) without access to a sufficient library
of reusable, standards-based services, they will be forced to
go back to Level Two and buy or build them, whether they

Carnegie Mellon’s capability maturity model
The Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute’s Capability Maturity
Model (CMM) describes organizational
maturity as “continuous process improvement based on many, small evolutionary steps rather than revolutionary innovations.” Evolutionary steps are
arranged in ﬁve maturity levels.
Level 1. The software process is
characterized as ad hoc, occasionally even chaotic. Few processes are
deﬁned, and success depends on individual effort rather than organizational
competence.
Level 2. Basic project management processes are established to
track cost, schedule, and functionality.

the catalogue of available services and
the related level of reuse will not reach
an optimum level.
BP also believes that the CMM is well
suited to adaptation for SOA because of
its emphasis on discipline, repeatability,
and consistency. If an IT organization
lacks rigor and maturity in conventional
software engineering, it is unlikely that
it can implement SOA very effectively.
Our sense is that a group or company
that has achieved CMM Level Two will
be able to move more quickly to SOA
Level Two. However, an organization
with poor project management controls
will struggle to achieve even basic levels
of SOA as the organizational maturity
will not support the level of reuse and
sharing that a successful SOA requires.
While others have applied the CMM
to SOA, two aspects distinguish BP’s approach. First, there is no vendor “slant”
put on the model. Second, there is a lot
more substance than the usual “high
level” SOA roadmap, which may look
more like an academic exercise.

Deploying the model
During 2006, BP rolled out SOA
Level Two across the E&P segment of the
business, with a handful of more advanced projects developing Level Three
capabilities.
The RTAP project, described in the
sidebar on p. 43, is an example of a
Level Two reusable service generating
value in the organization today. A significant number of additional services
are already in production based on the
standards defined for Level Two.
No large company, as far as we know,
has fully achieved Levels Three, Four, or
Five today. This is mainly because SOA is
so young that certain required standards
and toolsets are still emerging.
The Maturity Model is built to anticipate that and expects an incremental
evolution, not only of the organization’s
capabilities, but also of the availability of standards in the industry. For
example, the Service Monitoring and
Metrics required to achieve Level 4 can
be implemented today using proprietary tools, but an industry standard to

enable this will only be available in the
medium term future—likely after many
organizations have managed to develop
and embed the first three levels.
Just as individual projects cannot get
very far ahead of the organization as a
whole, individual corporations cannot
get ahead of the IT industry as a whole.
This is why it’s critical that innovators,
early adopters, IT technology suppli-

ers, and thought leaders—particularly
those operating within a given industry
vertical—work together toward achieving the SOA vision, and establishing the
necessary industry standards to make it
happen.
BP is participating in this sharing of
expertise by offering both our Maturity Model and specific elements of the
SOA standards documents, such as the

INNOVATE

As Albert Einstein said, “We can’t
solve problems by using the same kind
of thinking we used when we created them.” It has become apparent to
many of us that we’ll never solve the
problems created by some 40 years of
monolithic software engineering by using the same kind of thinking. SOA is a
totally different kind of thinking.
The SOA vision is clear. The technologies and standards are evolving rapidly
enough to enable enterprise-wide
adoption. Perhaps the biggest risk is not
in attempting to cross the chasm but in
sitting on the wrong side just because
it’s more familiar. SOA services and solutions will soon become ubiquitous. If
we try to deploy them in the same way
we deploy current technology, we’ll
never reap the benefits outlined above.
We’ll just implement the same chaotic
and complex environment with new
technologies, without solving the problems that the business sees every day.
SOA will not happen on its own. And
it certainly won’t happen in a single
leap. Transitioning from an IT environment with, at most, ad hoc web services
projects to a fully institutionalized SOA
capability requires a coordinated and
comprehensive sequence of activities.
The definition of the appropriate activities and their logical sequence is the
core of the SOA Maturity Model that BP
has defined as its roadmap for the next
several years.

BP’s objectives for its deepwater Gulf
of Mexico subsea pump project are to:
• Develop cutting edge technology
that increases recovery from existing
fields.
• Prove up technology for subsea
pumping.
• Share technology across the Gulf
of Mexico and worldwide.
King field is in water depths of
4,900-5,600 ft in Mississippi Canyon
Blocks 84, 85, 128, and 129. BP is the
sole equity owner with 100%.
BP’s Nicola Montorsi told OGJ the
key technology challenges at King were
the high-voltage umbilicals and connectors (12,000 v), pump seals, and remote operations of the subsea kit. Inlet
pressures at King range 48-127 bar.
Aker Kvaerner shipped three MPC335-50s Bornemann pumps from
Norway in June. Each weighs about 57
tonnes. They can reach up to 50-bar
differential pressure. Each pump station
weighs 70 tonnes.
Montorsi said the pumps arrived
in Mobile, Ala., early July, installation
began in mid-July, and the full project
would require 10-12 weeks. BP expects
the pumps to be operating by yearend.
Each of the pumps at King field is
designed to handle as much as 75,000
b/d. Each is rated to 5,000 psi and will
handle reservoir fluids at 60° C.
Three wells will be boosted from
two pump stations: one MultiBooster
will work on the D5 (King) and D3
(King West) wells; the other will work
on well D6 (King).
King field production began declining sharply at the end of 2005, but BP
expects addition of subsea pumps to
extend meaningful production into
2012 (Fig. 3). ✦

Rigless repairs
A new ultrasonic leak-detection
logging tool conveyed on wireline, and
recently on slick line in memory mode,
can detect leaks as small as 0.0024 gpm.
This detection ability has assisted the
operator in better diagnosing leaks in
tubing and behind pipe. The improved
diagnostics has aided the opeerator in
selecting remediation techniques that
can be performed without pulling the
tubing from the well.
The ultrasonic tool incorporates
data-acquisition equipment and filtering algorithms that allow continuous
logging, instead of time-consuming
stationary counts required by old-style
noise logs.

BP operates several enhanced oil
recovery and waterflood oil fields
that have experienced well integrity
problems as they mature. Rigless tubing repair has become an alternative
to workovers with rigs and include
wireline set tubing straddles and coiled
tubing packer repairs. The methods
are faster because no tubing has to be
pulled from the well. The limiting factor
in rigless repairs has been in identifying
leaks below the resolution of conventional leak-detection methods.
The velocity and temperature changes caused by small leaks often are below
the resolution of conventional logging
tools, including spinners, temperature
logs, downhole cameras, and noise logs.
These tools have even more limitations
when trying to detect leaks behind
tubing.

Note: The tool has a 1 11/16-in. OD and is rated for a

Tool operation
The frequency spectrum that a leak
produces is a function of differential
pressure, leak magnitude, and leak
geometry. These properties determine
whether the frequency will be audible,
ultrasonic, or both.

tool positioned at the leak, manipulation of wellbore pressure can causes
changes in the signal strength that can
confirm which tubular has the leak.

North Slope history

uses a sensor that detects a frequency
spectrum, including those typically
produced by leaks. An on-board processing unit has a series of band-pass
algorithms that focus on frequencies in
the ultrasonic range and processes the
signal generated by the sensor.
The algorithms filter out almost
all audible noise associated with tool
movement, thus allowing continuous logging. Typical logging speed is
30 fpm and the tool can identify leaks
while logging either up or down. It can
detect leaks through multiple strings
because ultrasound is not significantly
attenuated by gas, liquid, or steel.
Ultrasound typically travels only 310 ft in a wellbore before any significant attenuating. This attenuation allows
for a very sharp signal resolution, typically identifying a leak within 1 or 2 ft.
Sound passing through steel normally has some attenuation, but the
sensitivity of today’s equipment is such
that the tool can detect leaks through
multiple strings.

Since the introduction of the tool on
the North Slope in December 2005, BP
Alaska has logged 21 wells with an 81%
success rate (Table 1).
Of these wells, 14 were producers and 7 were water or gas injectors.
Liquid leak rates ranged from 0.013 to
21 gpm.
The logs have identified leaks in 10
annuli, 4 production casing strings,
4 packers, 1 wellhead, 1 liner hanger,
and 1 tubing straddle. Nine wells had
multiple leaks. One well had three leaks:
tubing, packer, and production casing.
Based on these results, 10 of these wells
will have rigless repairs.

The first ultrasonic log run by the
operator in Alaska identified a leaking
dummy gas-lift valve in an active water
injection well.
The operator completed the well as
a preproduced injector in 1983 and
converted it to water-alternating-gas

the tubing failed a pressure test, leaking 0.2-0.8 gpm. The logging used a
surface readout wireline while pumping down the annulus to maintain the
leak.
The log clearly showed leaks at the
top and bottom connections of a tubing
joint (Fig. 5). Note the more precise
ultrasonic leak signature compared with
the temperature traces.
An investigation concluded that the
connections were improperly made
up. After discussion with the service
company, the field adopted an operating
procedure to ensure the workover crew
observed and recorded all aspects of the
make-up (shoulder torque, number of
turns, and final torque). The procedure
also allows only three attempts for making up a tubing connection before the
collar and joint are discarded.
Installation of a tubing straddle repaired the leaking connection, eliminating the 4 days and $1 million required
for pulling and rerunning the tubing.

Casing leak
Detection of small casing leaks behind tubing is difficult, if not impossible, with conventional logging methods. Companies historically have tried
with little success to identify small leaks
by comparing a baseline temperature
pass with traces logged after pumping
into the annulus.
Well 4, a producer completed with

casing, exhibited sustained annulus
pressure and failed a pressure test.
The first step in determining the
leak location was to test the tubing by
installing a tubing tail plug and then
applying pressure to test the tubing.
Because the tubing held pressure, this
suggested that the well had either a
production-casing leak or a one-way
packer leak.
The operator then ran the ultrasonic
leak-detection tool in memory mode
on slick line. The logging operation
involved pressuring up the annulus and
maintaining the pressure at 3,000 psi
with a calculated leak rate of 0.36 gpm.

The log identified eight leaks, a

The track record has proved that ultrasonic technology is a viable, efficient,

Economic growth,

choices will determine
the rate of growth of
US gasoline and diesel
Refining
markets during the next
decade.
Diesel demand is sensitive mostly
to economic growth. The diesel market will therefore remain strong if the
economy continues to do
well.
Growth of 15-20%
in motor fuel demand
during the next decade
could be slower than the
recent past; but continued
adjustments to past price
increases and a somewhat lower economic growth rate could plausibly push
future growth into that range. Biofuels
and carbon policies would further constrain diesel demand growth, perhaps to
the lower end of the estimate.
The gasoline market also will grow
with the economy but is more sensitive to price and is still adjusting to
past price increases. Base case growth
of 15-20% during the next 10 years is
plausible.
Biofuels, corporate average fuel
economy (CAFE) policies, and changes
in the vehicle mix, however, could
reduce gasoline demand by up to 1.2
million b/d. Alternatively, constraints

on carbon emissions and biofuels
substitution could reduce overall motor
fuels demand by as much as 1.3 million b/d. In that case, gasoline demand
would grow only about 200,000 b/d
during the next 10 years and diesel
would grow 400,000 b/d.
This is the context in which US
refiners must make investment plans.
Given reasonable assumptions about
US economic growth during the next
several years, the market for motor fuels
appears poised to grow, albeit more
slowly than in the recent past. Investment in new diesel and gasoline processing capacity is needed and consumers will benefit if additions to refining
capacity keep pace with demand.
From a refiner perspective, however,
policy uncertainties abound. Industry
faces immediate prospects of anti-price
gouging and punitive tax legislation.
Investors also cannot be certain how
CAFE requirements will be implemented nor the extent to which policy will
compel use of biofuels beyond the 15
billion gal expected from corn ethanol.
There also are supply risks facing
ethanol output—changes in feedstock
prices, weather, and distribution costs
could curtail output in that market. In
addition, cellulosic ethanol may not be
available in large quantities in the next
10 years, but mandated biofuels targets
could be established on the belief that

it will be.
These various uncertainties cloud
prospects for investment in US motor
fuel production capacity. The outcome
could be a situation in which market
forces imply a need for expansion of
domestic refining capacity while policy
discourages it.
This article, the first of two parts,
will cover current and future demand for gasoline and diesel, and the
economic factors that will influence
demand during the next decade. The
concluding article in next week’s issue
will discuss the government policy
initiatives that will affect motor fuel
demand in the next decade.

During the past 15 years, motor
fuel demand in the US has increased
steadily. On average, gasoline demand
has increased about 1.5%/year; on-road
diesel demand has risen faster—up
almost 4%/year.
Although this demand increase has
largely been due to rising US prosperity,
concerns have been expressed that the
country is becoming too dependent on
imported crude oil as well as imported
refined products, notably gasoline. An
additional concern is that the US may
be producing too much carbon dioxide.
In his 2006 State of the Union address, for example, Pres. Bush said that
the US “is addicted to oil, which is often imported from unstable parts of the
world.” He has since announced a goal
of reducing annual US gasoline demand
20% in 10 years, through a combination of increased use of biofuels and
higher light vehicle fuel economy
standards.
Additionally, although the US has not
agreed to greenhouse gas limits under
the Kyoto protocol, proposals proliferate in Congress to constrain US carbon
emissions beginning in 2010, if not before. For example, Sen. Diane Feinstein
(D-Calif.) has introduced a bill that
would cap annual US greenhouse gases
at 2006 levels beginning in 2010 and
ratchet them downwards in subsequent
years.

What effects on motor fuel demand
might these various programs have? The
US population continues to increase,
incomes are rising, and the US light
vehicle fleet continues to expand. These
forces inexorably push gasoline and
diesel demand upwards.
On the other hand, fuel prices have
been rising. Technological means are at
hand to increase vehicle fuel economy.
The biofuels industry is booming. These
and other factors could constrain the
rise in petroleum motor fuel demand if
not reverse it.
Finally, refiner profits in the first half
of 2007 were historically high but fell

substantially in July 2007. Unscheduled
shutdowns and ongoing required maintenance have caused short-run motor
fuel prices to rise substantially.
In response, some in Congress and
elsewhere have proposed anti “price
gouging” legislation as well as special
taxes on refiner profits. These policy
responses also bear on the willingness
of firms to make large and long-term
capital investments in new US refining
capacity.

Fig. 3 shows the US light vehicle fleet
during 1990-2005.
Between 1990 and 2004 the number
of automobiles changed very little, but
the numbers of light trucks and SUVs
changed a great deal. In 1990, light
trucks and SUVs comprised about 1/3
of all light vehicles sold in the US. But
since 2000, these categories have comprised 50-55% of all new light vehicles
sold. Their numbers have been rising
both absolutely and as a proportion of
the vehicle fleet.
Fig. 4 shows the real (inflation-adjusted) prices for gasoline and diesel
during the same period. During 19902002, real prices did not rise; but since
then there has been an increase of about
50% in both fuels. Real prices have
risen even further in 2007.
These increases will have an effect on
demand; in particular they will change
the choices consumers make on the
types of vehicles they decide to buy.

With this as a consideration, Fig.
5 reflects use of intermediate term
elasticity to project demand growth
using different price and GDP growth
assumptions.
Growth in gasoline demand ranges
from -7% to 42%; the former represents consistently slow economic
growth and steadily rising real prices at
3%/year and the latter represents rapid
economic growth coupled with steadily
declining prices. The true range is probably narrower.
Rapid economic growth coupled
with steadily declining prices seems
unlikely because the growth would
probably push demand up and exert
upwards pressure on prices. On the
other hand, economic growth is likely
to average more than 1.5%/year; i.e.,
we expect consumers will continue to
see sustained real incomes consistent
with recent history.
A medium case is moderate (2.5%/
year) economic growth with no change
in real prices during the next decade.
That would imply an 18% overall increase in gasoline demand. This projection, however, is probably high for two
reasons. Consumers still are adjusting to
the real price increases of the past few
years, and real prices have continued to
rise so far in 2007.
Accounting for likely consumer
adjustments to recent price increases in
70

motor fuels, growth of 10-15% during
the next decade given the midcase assumptions is more likely.
We compared these projections with
US Energy Information Administration
projections of gasoline demand. In its
2007 Annual Energy Outlook, the US
Department of Energy projected declining real gasoline prices followed by
increases. It also projected 2.9%/year
economic growth, which is between
our 2.5%/year and 3.5%/year growth
cases.
Using our parameter estimates, these
assumptions would yield projected
growth of about 22% during the next
10 years, although past price increases
likely would reduce this to 15-20%. In
its Annual Energy Outlook, however,
DOE projects growth of only about
1.2%/year or 13% for the decade. This
is within the range of our midcase
estimate.

Diesel forecast
Estimates of the effect of price and
income on diesel demand exist for
the entire OECD, not just the US.2 The
estimates suggest a higher long-run
income elasticity of demand than for
gasoline, about 1.15, and a lower longrun price elasticity, around -0.3.
Using these parameter estimates to
predict the growth in diesel demand
between 1990 and 2005, we got 71%,

not much different from actual growth
of 78% during the period.
Fig. 6 shows the results using intermediate-term elasticity.
In all of the cases, diesel demand
rises, although the rise might not be as
great as shown because diesel consumers are still adjusting to past price
increases. For the midcase assumptions,
this might reduce growth to about 1520%. Nevertheless, the clear implication
is that so long as US GDP continues to
rise, the on-road diesel market is likely
to remain strong. ✦

March 3 – 5, 2008 / Moody Gardens Hotel & Convention Center, Galveston, Texas

SUBSEA TIEBACK
Forum & Exhibition

PennWell invites you back to the 8th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition.
SSTB has become the premier event for one of the fastest growing field
development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March 3 – 5, 2008 in
Galveston, TX at the Moody Gardens Hotel & Conference Center. Over 2,000
people and 150 exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference.You can’t
afford to miss it.
As our industry confronts new challenges, it has never been more important
to submerse yourself in them. This year’s theme is “Subsea is here, the game
is changing.” As our game changes, the sharing of knowledge and collective
experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety,
and economics of the subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by
industry leaders. As in the past, only by participating in this conference will you
be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will not be published and no
Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room
stays inside the conference room. We hope you will join us.

Spark spread trends
and volatility show that
opportunities for gas
supply through LNG vary
from market to market
and require careful conLNG
tracting and risk management to position LNG
favorably against competing fuels and
sustain a competitive position.
Despite taking
more control of oil
and gas resources,
many gas-resourcerich nations, their
governments, and
their national oil
companies recognize the benefits of a continued reliance
on international oil companies’ technological, financial, and managerial assistance in developing their natural gas
industries over the medium term.
The first part of two articles (OGJ,
Oct. 1, 2007, p. 60) used analysis of
natural gas statistics for production,
consumption, net exports, and proved
reserves to help identify and explain
strategies being pursued by NOCs in
producing countries where they control
their national industries.

LNG TRADE—
Conclusion

Spark spread trends allow
analysis of LNG consumers
David Wood
David Wood & Associates
Lincoln, UK

This concluding article reviews gas
and LNG spark spreads in relation to
electricity prices and competing fuels
to provide insight into the main gas
consuming countries.

Spark spreads
Volatile global gas prices create difficulty in predicting future economic
returns for gas markets. As most LNG
is used for power generation, however,
focusing on gas prices’ effect on power
prices in specific markets allows for
useful economic analysis.
Spark spread, the unit electricity price minus the price of the fuel
consumed to generate it, measures
the profitability of power generation
facilities. The amount of fuel consumed
depends on the energy conversion
efficiency of the power plant. Conversion efficiency for modern combinedcycle gas turbines is generally > 50%,
whereas energy efficiency is < 40%
in conventional coal, oil, and nuclear
power plants.
A short-term increase in natural gas
price usually leads to a smaller spark
spread and less profitability for the
electricity utility if the increase is not
(or cannot) be passed on to power

ther country has pipeline gas supplies,
and both have historically had to pay
premium prices to secure large-volume
LNG supplies.
South Korea manages greater seasonal demand variations and more
volatile LNG and electricity prices than
Japan. Both have successfully diversified their LNG supply sources, using
long-term and medium-term contracts
(both ex-ship and FOB) and pricing
against competing fuels in their specific
markets.
South Korea’s market seasonality
makes short-term LNG price fluctuations more problematic there because
it needs to buy additional short-term
cargoes in cold winters. It recently,
however, has committed to building
additional LNG storage capacity, and
increasing its number of LNG receiving
terminals to five, to ease such seasonal
vulnerability.
LNG has generally provided a com-

parable spark spread to pipeline gas in
the US markets, but both are subject to
volatility in both short-term gas and
electricity prices. Most LNG cargoes are
indexed to Henry Hub spot or shortterm futures prices with a time lag
involved. The time lag, in times of price
volatility, can result in either pipeline or
LNG providing a more attractive spark
spread for generators at any given time.
Spark spreads frequently lie close to
the margins (<$20/Mw-hr) for gas
and LNG in the US, combining with
geopolitical concerns about growing
dependence on gas imports to make
power generators reluctant to commit
to substantial newbuild gas-fired power
plants.
Short-term gas pricing strategies
of US buyers can also make it difficult
to secure LNG cargoes at competitive prices because they can at certain
times be sold at more attractive prices
into European (and sometimes Asian)

markets. Using an LNG strategy with
long-term contracts linked to a basket of competing fuels (or with floor
and ceiling prices) might help power
generators overcome such problems
moving forward.
Gas-producing nations find it difficult to sustain the risks of supplying
LNG to markets with volatile spark
spreads without the involvement of international oil companies in the supply
chain to absorb a substantial amount
of the price and demand risk. Term
contracts that provide financial upside
in times of high demand, frequently expose gas suppliers to over capacity and
low prices during periods of demand
downturn.
IOCs, with diverse downstream
gas portfolios, are better equipped to
handle market volatility by mixing and
matching supply to several markets on
a short-term basis than more resourceoriented NOCs. ✦

Here’s the Focus probe, an optical flowmeter that
provides accurate
data independently of
gas composition or
contamination of the
sensing elements.
Using laser beams to measure the
velocity of naturally occurring particulates,
the probe is specifically developed for flare
and biogas applications with variable flow
rates and a range of pipe diameters. Designed with no moving parts and featuring
a high turndown ratio of 1,000:1, the tool
is immune to pipe vibration and acoustic
noise. It is intrinsically safe and compliant

From the Subscribers Only area of

Summer gasoline
output discredits
spring suspicion
Timing makes the latest congressionally
inspired investigation of the US oil industry
look—to put it politely—seriously uninformed.
In May, the Connecticut congressional
delegation asked the Government Accountability Ofﬁce to probe relationships between reﬁning capacity and gasoline prices.
The lawmakers had noticed that reﬁning
capacity utilization was down in April and

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

disputed parallel arguments that reﬁnery
outages helped explain gasoline price
increases early in the year.
“Increasing prices lead to higher proﬁts
for reﬁners, and a calculated decrease in
reﬁning capacity could create an artiﬁcial
shortage and drive up the cost to consumers,” they wrote in a letter to GAO.
At the same time, Sen. Charles Schumer
(D-NY), chairman of the Joint Economic
Committee, sent a similar letter to GAO.
On Sept. 24, members of the Connecticut group announced that the GAO had
agreed to combine the requests and review
reﬁners’ behavior “to determine whether
market and supply manipulation has occurred as well as to what extent their practices inﬂuence fuel prices” (OGJ Online,
Sept. 26, 2007).
Like many predecessors, this investigation won’t ﬁnd misbehavior. No one makes
money by refusing to sell something. But
American political thinking just can’t grow
out of mindless suspicion to the contrary.
The core of the lawmakers’ suspicion
is that reﬁners were deliberately holding
product off the market, not having the very
real maintenance troubles that did suppress reﬁnery operations just before the
driving season.
But consider what happened after the
lawmakers sent GAO their request—after
reﬁners solved the operational problems in
which faulty legislation played a role.
Gasoline production by US reﬁners in
June set a record of 9.3 million b/d, according to the American Petroleum Institute. It
reset the record in July at 9.325 million b/d.
Record output of all products has pushed
heating oil stocks to comfortably high levels
as winter approaches, API reports.
Record-setting production is not the
behavior of an industry trying to manipulate prices. It’s rational business behavior.
It was predictable. That predictability could
have kept Schumer and the Connecticut
gang from sending GAO on yet another
witch hunt. Apparently, they’d rather look
suspicious than rational.

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

Analyst sees US oil supply cuts by 2012
Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Nigeria, Algeria, and Russia will cut crude
exports to the US by 2012, and the resulting gap between supplies and demand will
intensify investments to develop Canada’s oil sands, claims Jeff Rubin, chief market
strategist and economist at CIBC World Markets, the wholesale and corporate banking arm of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
The anticipated total drop of 2.5 million b/d of production among six of the largest suppliers of oil to the US is part of the keynote address that Rubin was to deliver
Oct. 2 at CIBC World Markets’ Industrial Conference in New York City. At that meeting, Rubin was to share his latest research on the global balance of oil supply and
demand, focusing on the size and scope of the oil crunch facing the US in the next 5
years.
But at the recent 6th Annual Association for the Study of Peak Oil & Gas conference in Cork, Ireland, Rubin said crude prices are likely to hit $100/bbl by the end of
next year as the biggest oil-producing nations reduce exports to supply their rapidly
growing domestic consumption (OGJ Online, Sept. 17, 2007). With production likely
to plateau or decline in the six named countries, Rubin expects global oil exports to
fall by 7% by 2010.
“Domestic demand growth of as much as 5%/year in key oil producing countries
is already beginning to cannibalize exports and will increasingly do so in the future
as production plateaus or declines in many of these countries,” he said in Ireland.
“OPEC members together with independent producers Russia and Mexico consume
over 12 million b/d, surpassing Western Europe to become the second largest oil
market in the world.”
Rubin noted that consumers in many major oil-producing countries pay much
less than the global price for crude. He said highly subsidized gasoline prices are
often a factor in the surging rates of domestic oil consumption. “In many countries,
prices are as little as $10/bbl,” he said.
Canadian oil sands
In Cork, Rubin predicted Canadian oil sands will surpass deepwater wells as
the single largest source of new oil exports by the end of this decade as markets
are forced to rely more on higher-cost unconventional deposits. He said Canada’s
oil sands represent 50-70% of the world’s oil reserves open to private investment,
depending on the investment climate in Nigeria and Kazakhstan. “Canada remains
one of the few places where there is still private access to strategically important
reserves, in sharp contrast, for example, to the oil sand deposits in Venezuela,” Rubin
said.
In a Sept. 25 report, however, Edinburgh consultant Wood Mackenzie Ltd. said
proposed changes by the Alberta Royalty Review Panel would reduce the commercial value of current and planned oil sands projects in Canada by $26 billion, at a
long-term price of $50/bbl for North Sea Brent crude (OGJ Online, Sept. 25, 2007).
This isn’t the ﬁrst time that Rubin’s estimates of oil prices and other economic
measures have garnered international headlines. In a report published in April 2005,
Rubin said, “Over the next 5 years, crude prices will almost double, averaging close
to $77/bbl and reaching as much as $100/bbl by 2010. That’s over twice the previous
6-year high (1980-85) following the second OPEC oil shock, when crude, in today’s
dollars, averaged the equivalent of $65/bbl. Tomorrow’s price hikes won’t be triggered by sudden supply disruptions like the Arab oil boycott of 1973 or the Iranian
Revolution in 1979. Instead, they will follow from the inevitable collision between
surging global crude demand and accelerating depletion of conventional crude supply. By 2010, prices will have to take out nearly 9 million b/d from world oil consumption—no mean feat for a world that has never been more thirsty for oil.”
In that report, Rubin foresaw “some fundamental differences” from energy prices
in the 1970-80s. “On the economic front, the impact of surging crude prices is likely
to be far more deﬂationary than inﬂationary. During the 1970s, surging fuel costs
were the catalyst for a huge outbreak of wage-price inﬂation, as workers futilely tried
to protect the purchasing power of their incomes through ever-escalating wage demands. But that was in a world where most workers in G-7 economies were protected by huge trade barriers against competition from cheap offshore labor. In today’s
world, where production and jobs can easily be shifted to low-wage economies,
North American wages will have to eat energy price increases, and in the process,
stomach the loss of purchasing power that comes along with it,” Rubin said.

Other manufacturers formulate their storage compounds by simply adding
anti-corrosion additives into a bearing grease. Jet-Lube takes the opposite
approach by taking their best corrosion inhibitor and rust preventatives and
formulating them into a protective compound that penetrates and sticks to
the thread roots.
No matter the climate or environment, you won’t find a storage
compound that protects your end connections longer than
KORR-GUARD™. Extend your thread protection
way beyond the factory warranty. Get
KORR-GUARD from Jet-Lube.

MESSAGE: CHAIRMAN & CHAIRMAN-ELECT
WELCOME TO LAGCOE 2007
On behalf of the ofﬁcers, directors and volunteers of the Louisiana Gulf Coast Oil Exposition, we welcome you
to Experience the Energy of LAGCOE 2007! We are pleased and proud to have you here as we celebrate ﬁfty-two
years of the latest advances in technology, equipment and services for the energy industry. This is an exciting
event. LAGCOE 2007 is a world-class business opportunity to network with decision makers from around the
globe, discover world-class technology and solutions, cultivate dynamic business relationships and gather the latest
information on safety and security.

The show has been selected for the third year as one of only 28 trade shows in the nation to participate in the
United States Commercial Service’s International Buyer Program (IBP). This program is a joint governmentindustry effort designed to match international buyers with domestic companies at selected trade shows in the U.S.,
helping to sell U.S. products and services to international markets. As part of the IBP promotion, U.S. Commercial
Service ofﬁcers in embassies and consulates around the world have screened and recruited international buyers
to attend this show. LAGCOE is the only oil and gas industry trade show selected to participate in the program,
and this recognition is a great honor. Beyond that, afﬁliation with the IBP offers
unprecedented global opportunities for our exhibitors, attendees and the oil and gas
industry as a whole.

This year, we have again implemented an innovative plan to ensure that oil and gas
industry decision makers are in attendance. With the help of some very generous
sponsoring companies, LAGCOE has chartered jet aircraft and busses to transport key
executives of the oil and gas industry from the Houston and New Orleans areas. The
decision makers are here for LAGCOE 2007.

We offer our deepest gratitude to the hundreds of volunteers who rolled up their
sleeves and did whatever was necessary to make this a great show, and we especially
acknowledge Event Manager Sally Ware and Lynette Brown, for playing a vital role in
the success of this event.

DAVID SHEALY
LAGCOE 2007 CHAIRMAN

Again, welcome to LAGCOE 2007. All of us are at your service. We want to make this
an exposition you’ll remember for a long time to come, so call on us if we can assist
you in any way.

Prepare yourself to Experience the Energy of this historic exposition.

Sincerely,
David Shealy, LAGCOE 2007 Chairman
Howard Wilson, LAGCOE 2007 Chairman-elect

A Century of Innovation

In 2007, Baker Hughes is celebrating a century of innovation and service in the oil and gas
industry. Since 1907, when R.C. Baker invented a casing shoe that increased efficiency and reliability
for early wildcatters, our engineers and scientists have served the industry by solving problems for
customers. Today’s Baker Hughes carries on the tradition of Mr. Baker, Howard Hughes, Sr. and
many other oil service pioneers whose creativity delivered technology innovations that have helped
our customers find, develop and produce oil and gas around the world on land and offshore.

Congratulations, David!

LAGCOE LOOEY

Louisiana Gulf Coast Oil Exposition announces
C. Paul Hilliard as LAGCOE Looey
The honor of LAGCOE LOOEY is bestowed upon an
individual who has provided strength and integrity to
the oil and gas industry and played a signiﬁcant role
in its growth and progress. The recipient must also
have displayed a commitment to the community by
helping others through community service. This year’s
LAGCOE Looey is C. Paul Hilliard.
Hilliard was born in Sandburr Coulee, Buffalo County,
Wisconsin on June 18, 1925. Paul attended elementary
school in Alcohol Bluff from 1931–1936. Our LAGCOE
LOOEY says he really walked two miles, everyday, to
a one-room, one teacher, two-outhouse institution. In
1936, Paul’s four year old kid brother, affectionately
known as the Emancipating Pyromaniac, burned the
family barn to the ground, along with the winter hay
supply. This forced the Hilliard family to move into
town (1,896 population), where the Hilliard’s were
introduced to the luxuries of electricity and indoor
plumbing. Paul completed his primary and high school
education in the Wisconsin Public School System.
During World War II (1943 to 1946) C. Paul Hilliard
served his country fearlessly and proud in the United
States Marine Corps, Marine Air Group 24 and 32

Radioman-Gunner in SBD “Dauntless” dive bombers—
the Solomon Islands and the Philippines.
Completing his honorable service to his country, Mr.
Hilliard returned to Wisconsin to begin his formal
education. From 1946 to 1948, Paul attended Wisconsin
and Syracuse Universities. Upon graduation, he attended
the University of Texas (1948-1951) where he earned a
Juris Doctorate in 1951.
Hilliard began his career in the oil and gas industry
as a landman for The California Company, now called
Chevron Corporation. He chose this career path, even
though he had a law degree, because the pay was better
at $100 more a month. Acceptance of this job placed
him in New Orleans, Louisiana. Three years later, he
relocated to Lafayette, Louisiana to work for H.L. Hunt
as a South Louisiana landman.
After four years in the industry, Hilliard’s adventurous
spirit and innovative thinking led him to start his own
company. In 1955, Badger Oil Corporation, named after
the University of Wisconsin mascot, was formed. Today,
he continues to operate this company as an independent.

LAGCOE LOOEY CONTINUED FROM PAGE 13

Hilliard’s accomplishments within the oil industry are
duly noted. He has served as national chairman of the
Independent Petroleum Association of America, a member
of the National Petroleum Council, and served as president of the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association (LOGA).
Known for his generous spirit and devotion to
children, Hilliard has made exceptional contributions
to his community in the area of education. Serving
on the board of the St. Landry Charter School, he
was instrumental in creating and personally funding
classroom libraries. Additionally, he has implemented
tutorial programs in low-income area schools to help
bring 3rd graders to grade
level, funded teacher
appreciation functions
and funded trips to a
local bookstore allowing
students to select a book
of choice.

C. PAUL HILLIARD,
LAGCOE LOOEY

Hilliard’s commitment to
education and his passion
to inspire tomorrow’s
leaders can be seen in
the time he volunteers
at schools reading to
students. However, his
ardor for learning and

commitment to help others extends beyond elementary
education. Hilliard and his deceased wife Lulu have long
been major contributors to the University Art Museum
and supporters of the Performing Arts Society of
Acadiana and the Acadiana Symphony Orchestra.
The Acadiana community has embraced Hilliard and
recognized his devotion. He was named the 1994 king
of the Bishop’s Charity Ball and the recipient of the
2003 Civic Cup. In June of 2007, Paul Hilliard was
honored with the Evangeline Area Council Boy Scouts
of America Distinguished Citizen Award. Paul shares
with his deceased wife, Lulu, the honor of the Paul and
Lulu Hilliard University Art Museum.
Hilliard was elected in June 2006 for a three year
term to the Board of Trustees of the National World
War II Museum in New Orleans, LA. He serves on
the following committees of the Museum – Executive
Committee, Education and Collections, Trusteeship and
Capital Campaign.
Within the business sector of the community, Hilliard
has served on numerous committees with the Lafayette
Chamber of Commerce. He has worked with the
Energy, Education, Governmental Affairs and Economic
Development committees, as well as the I-49 task force.
Hilliard has been an active member of First Lutheran
Church for 50 years. He and Lulu have four children,
two stepchildren, 21 grandchildren, and 14 greatgrandchildren.

HISTORY & SPIRIT
OF LAGCOE:
1955 – 2007

Like the oil & gas industry, LAGCOE has changed
steadily in the years since the ﬁrst show, much of it
driven by an eagerness to keep pace with advances in
technology. The days in the old Blackham Coliseum
are now only memories for the show currently calling
the Cajundome and Convention Center its home. The

biennial exposition has evolved into a premier business
and marketing environment, focusing on presenting
cutting-edge technology and information to the decision
makers of the petroleum industry.

When the oil and gas people of Lafayette launched the
ﬁrst Louisiana Gulf Coast Oil Exposition in 1955, it is
unlikely that any of them expected the show to grow
into one of the largest oil and gas expositions in the
nation. Certainly, they could not envision the infant show
eventually being recognized as one of only 28 trade
shows selected by the U.S. Department of Commerce to
participate in the International Buyer Program. Over the
last ﬁfty years, all that has happened and much more.

HISTORY & SPIRIT OF LAGCOE

HISTORY & SPIRIT OF LAGCOE

HISTORY & SPIRIT OF LAGCOE

1971

Despite the advances that have taken place over the years,
one thing has remained constant: the spirit of the show
and the people whose volunteer efforts make it work.
The spirit stems, perhaps, from the fact that LAGCOE
is an oil and gas show staged by oil and gas people.
The hard working committees and their members are
involved daily in industry activities. They understand
the challenges and demands of the search for
energy. Working in the show promotes a sense of
accomplishment and pride, because LAGCOE provides
resources that help to meet those challenges. Thus,
volunteers undertake the demanding tasks involved
in producing the show with a spirit of adventure and
anticipation. They are helping to make a difference.
There also is a spirit of genuine hospitality. LAGCOE
workers sincerely appreciate the contributions of the

exhibitors, visitors and technical session participants.
Their enthusiasm in welcoming attendees is contagious.
The LAGCOE spirit has been constant since that ﬁrst
show. At LAGCOE 1955, the list of ofﬁcers, directors and
volunteers read like a who’s who of the early oil and gas
industry in Lafayette. People who were key players when
the industry ﬁrst began to hit its stride along the Louisiana
Gulf Coast were still around and deeply involved.
The ﬁrst show, at Blackham Coliseum, was successful
in every way except ﬁnancially. Those who signed
the note took a loss, but the success of other aspects
of the exposition made up for that disappointment.
The chamber of commerce, which had conceived the
idea along with Peter Ferguson of Esso Standard as
a way for the community to express its appreciation
to the industry and its people, even loaned one of its
employees to serve as the show’s general manager.
There were some 130 exhibitors for the ﬁrst show,
enough to convince all involved that there was a
bright future.

For the ﬁrst show, the symbol was a cartoon character
in a hard hat, coveralls and a ﬁve o’clock shadow called
“Lafayette Looey,” the forerunner of LAGCOE Looey. The
ﬁrst Looey was Lyle Cummins.
The inaugural program described Looey as “a funny
guy… he works in an oil ﬁeld, he uses your tools, eats
your food and sleeps in your bed. He’s an ordinary
Joe—or Looey—maybe sporting a week’s growth of
beard after ﬁnishing up a long shift out on the rigs. He’s
here to clean up, sleep up, then see the show and meet
his bosses and his bosses’ bosses and their customers.
He’s one of your best customers, whomever you are.”
Over the years, as technology advanced and as the
industry became more knowledge-oriented, the initial
description of Looey declined in accuracy, but he
remained the exuberant symbol of the working oil man.
Looey two-stepped through the ﬁrst LAGCOE program,
appearing on pages that detailed the gala atmosphere of

social and entertainment events accompanying the show:
Charlie Aillet and his band playing for a Cajun fais do
do; the famed Keesler Field Air Force Band leading an
opening day parade through downtown Lafayette, with
17 marching bands behind them; the selection of the
ﬁrst “Queen LAGCOE” at a formal concert and dance; a
rollicking press party; a shrimp and beer party, luncheon
and style show, and the grand queen’s ball.
It was a small show compared to today’s world-class
exposition, but the remarkable LAGCOE spirit was evident
in every activity. In 1957, the program was bigger and
more professional. Each show brought new, enthusiastic
volunteers whose names became synonymous with the
local oil and gas industry and with LAGCOE.
“Lafayette Looey” became “LAGCOE Looey,” in 1957,
and the list of exhibitors increased to more than 180.
Lafayette got a look at the heavy equipment of the
industry as it was featured in a downtown parade,
and the Odessa Chuck Wagon Barbecue Group made

the ﬁrst of many journeys to LAGCOE. That year, 35
contestants sought the title of “Queen LAGCOE II.”
With two successful shows under their belts, the oil and
gas people of Lafayette were ready to challenge the big
established expositions. In the years to come, there would
be steady growth, both in the industry and in LAGCOE.
In 1961, Paul Harvey was featured speaker at a
LAGCOE luncheon, and he would make return
appearances. The Sixties also saw the appearance of
the attractive young “Oil Drops,” and in 1969, the U.S.
Secretary of the Interior, Walter Hickel, was a guest at
the show.
The 1989 show brought Louisiana Congressman Jimmy
Hayes and then-Speaker of the House Tom Foley, to
tour the exhibits.
After the slump that hit in the eighties, the industry
became more conservative and the show became geared
to the serious business of helping ﬁnd more efﬁcient
and cost effective ways to produce the nation’s energy.

The featured speaker for the 1995 technical sessions was
Cynthia Quarterman, Director of the Minerals management
Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior.
In 1999, LAGCOE featured a man destined to hold one
of the nation’s most powerful ofﬁces. Dick Cheney,
then chief executive ofﬁcer of Halliburton and now vice
president of the U.S., was a keynote speaker for the
technical sessions.

impact of Hurrican’s Katrina and Rita.
This biennial exposition has grown in every respect over
the years, particularly in the number of exhibitors and
in the exuberance of its volunteers. Some of the gala
trappings of the early days have disappeared, but the
vivacious, adventurous and hospitable spirit of LAGCOE
has never wavered.

Development Economic Authority
and the state of Louisiana.
The facility will offer leading edge
technology that can be applied in
almost any ﬁeld, from energy and
manufacturing to aerospace and the
military to medicine, environmental
and entertainment.

THE DECADES-OLD RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA
AT LAFAYETTE AND THE OIL AND
GAS INDUSTRY HAS GROWN INTO AN
ESTABLISHED PARTNERSHIP FOR A NUMBER
OF REASONS.
Among them: a thriving Petroleum
Engineering Department which
educates undergraduates and graduates for the workforce, and a strong
faculty who’ve helped advance the
industry through research.
Professors throughout the College of
Engineering are researching different
aspects of the oil and gas industry
from the design and use of wells and
well systems for producing oil, gas,
and other liquiﬁed natural resources to
pipe corrosion and drill bit vibration.
The university also has partnered
with local entities to bring innovative, world-class ideas to life
here in Lafayette including the
Louisiana Immersive Technologies
Enterprise facility.
Construction is now under way for
the $20 million facility in University
Research Park. It will house the
world’s ﬁrst six-sided digital virtual
reality cube and the world’s largest 3-D auditorium. Both the reality
cube and the auditorium are powered by one of the fastest supercomputers in the world.
The creation of LITE is a result of
a successful collaboration between
the university, the Lafayette
36

In addition, University Research Park
is home to UL Lafayette’s Energy
Institute. This center provides expert
knowledge of the geology and geophysics of the Gulf of Mexico and
the gulf coast region.
Its primary concern is the application of this information for use by
the petroleum industry, environmental concerns and government
institutions. The Institute provides
research, education and collaborative
opportunities with partner organizations and individuals.

PETROLEUM ENGINEERING
The Petroleum Engineering Department has played a historic role in the
oil and gas industry for years now.
In 1955, the university initiated a
bachelor’s degree in petroleum engineering. In the next half century, 850
students completed undergraduate
studies in petroleum engineering.
Most recently, administrators
strengthened the department’s role
by reintroducing a graduate program
in petroleum engineering.
Originally started in 1960, the
program was discontinued by the
state Board of Regents in 1997
based on requirements.
It now draws from the large number of oil and gas professionals in
Lafayette, as well as from students
who have earned bachelor’s degrees
in petroleum engineering.
“Lafayette is the natural place to offer
this sort of curriculum,” said Dr. Ali
Ghalambor, head of UL Lafayette’s

petroleum engineering department.
“We have many industry people in the
area, many of whom want to improve
their education and get an advanced
degree. Without the master’s program
here, that would be impossible.”
UL Lafayette is one of only 15
schools nationwide to offer a petroleum engineering curriculum. In
addition, the UL Lafayette Society
of Petroleum Engineers Student
Chapter is one of the top three
outstanding student chapters among
more than 125 worldwide.
Faculty continue to distinguish themselves among their peers through
research and publications.
Ghalambor and Dr. Boyun Guo
recently co-authored a new
book “Offshore Pipelines” with
Dr. Shanhong Song from the
ChevronTexaco Corporation and Jacob
Chacko with INTEC Engineering Inc.
The book covers the full scope
of pipeline development from
design, installation and testing to
operation. It includes guidelines to
achieve cost-effective management
of offshore and deepwater pipeline
development and operations.
The book is considered the most
up-to-date reference for engineers,
developers and management
personnel challenged with bringing
oil and gas onshore.
The pair previously co-authored
“Gas Volume Requiremenvts for
Underbalanced Drilling” which aids
well construction engineers in planning UBD wells.
“We will continue the tradition of supplying the petroleum industry with
excellent workforce and knowledge,”
said Ghalambor. “Through undergraduate and graduate programs along
with continual research projects, we
strive to develop and offer the latest
advances in the oil and gas industry.”

Yourself
You Own
Your Ignition System.
But Do You Control It?
There’s always been one way for your ignition system to work.
One timing setting, one way to reprogram and limited voltage options.
It’s always been the manufacturer’s way, not your way.
Now you have alternatives with FW Murphy.
Murphy power ignition controls are fully flexible for your exact needs.
Send just the right amount of energy to your plugs at just the right time
for maximum plug life. Choose from five timing reference options, including camless operation. You can even
reprogram on the fly using only the keypad – no more replacing chips.
You have a problem with not enough ignition options? Not anymore – Murphy just solved it.
See how we can give you real ignition choices. Visit www.murphy-pi.com/dealers to find your local
Murphy power ignition dealer.

COVER
A work crew lowers in pipe on the Midcontinent Express Pipeline
Project’s Spread 4 constructed by Willbros Construction (US)
LLC for Midcontinent Express Pipeline LLC, a joint venture of
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP and Energy Transfer Partners
LP. Work on the pipeline included laying the 42-in OD pipe
shown here on Spread 4 near Sarepta, La. The entire 500-mile
pipeline extends from Bennington, Okla., to Station 85, connecting production from the Barnett shale, Bossier sands, and other
plays in the region to the eastern US. Oil & Gas Journal’s special

Interest

EPA dissatisfied with Texas clean-air permitting
Key aspects of the Texas clean-air permitting program do not
meet US Clean Air Act requirements, the Environmental Protection
Agency said in a Sept. 8 news release from its Dallas office.
EPA proposes to disapprove parts of the Texas air permitting
program. The CAA requires states develop permitting plans that are
approved by EPA. Previously, Houston Mayor Bill White and others
have pushed for stricter air pollution regulations for refineries and
petrochemical plants along the Houston Ship Channel.
The federal agency’s rejections are expected to become final
next year following a 60-day public comment period. Meanwhile,
EPA said it will work with the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality, industry, and environmental groups to identify and adopt
changes in the state program.
“Texas’ air-permitting program should be transparent and understandable to the communities we serve, protective of air quality, and establish clear and consistent requirements,” said Lawrence
Starfield, EPA acting regional administrator. “These notices make
clear our view that significant changes are necessary for compliance with the Clean Air Act.”
EPA proposes to reject Texas’ flexible permits, which allow air
polluters to exceed emission limits in certain areas provided that
those areas achieve an overall emissions average. EPA also plans to
reject Texas rules that allow air polluters to make certain changes at
plants without having to schedule public hearings.

EPA cites Shell for second pollution violation
The US Environmental Protection Agency cited Shell Chemical
Yabucoa Inc. in Puerto Rico on Sept. 3 for violating the federal
Clean Water Act for the second time in a year.
EPA’s Region 2 office in New York said that the refining and petrochemical plant improperly maintained deep ocean outfall equipment it operates under an EPA permit under the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) and discharged unauthorized pollutants as a result. It issued a complaint, in which it has
proposed a $153,057 penalty, and a compliance order.
Specifically, EPA said that the Shell Chemical affiliate violated the
permit’s terms by unlawfully discharging the pollutants into navigable waters for 14 days, and by not properly operating a multiport
diffuser pipeline for 105 days.
According to the complaint, Shell Yabucoa admitted that a leak
from its diffuser pipeline began on or about Feb. 25 and claimed
that it stopped discharging from the pipe on Mar. 2. But the company later reported that it discharged through the pipeline during
14 days from Feb. 27 to Mar. 30, EPA said.
The federal environmental regulator’s latest complaint against

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

the firm followed a $1.025 million fine that Shell Chemical Yabucoa paid in May for similar violations. EPA said that fine stemmed
from a Dec. 31, 2008, report indicated that two or three of Shell
Chemical Yubacoa’s diffuser ports were blocked by sand.
It said it accordingly issued an administrative compliance order
(ACO) in March that required Shell Yabucoa to submit a plan to repair the leak and properly operate all ports of the diffuser. Despite
the ACO, Shell failed to properly operate and maintain the diffuser
from at least Dec. 31, 2008, to Apr. 15, 2009. That failure, in conjunction with the unauthorized discharges in February and March,
led EPA to issue the most recent complaint, the agency said.
Shell Chemical bought the installation at Yabucoa from Sunoco
Inc. in January 2002 to produce chemical feedstock for its plants
in Norco, La., and Deer Park, Tex., as well as refined products for
customers in Puerto Rico.

Clinton, others sued over Alberta Clipper oil line
Four environmental and Native American groups sued US Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton and other federal officials on Sept.
3 to protest US Department of State approval of the proposed Alberta Clipper oil pipeline.
The Indigenous Environmental Network, Minnesota Center for
Environmental Advocacy, National Wildlife Federation, and Sierra
Club filed their 37-page complaint in the US District Court for
Northern California. They are represented by the nonprofit law
firm Earthjustice.
The groups said they might sue after the State Department’s Aug.
24 approval for the 1,000-mile, 450,000 b/d line from Hardisty,
Alta., to Superior, Wis., to cross the Canadian-US border. The project’s sponsor, an Enbridge Energy Inc. subsidiary, said it hopes to
have the system operating by mid-2010 after it receives other Canadian and US government permits.
In their complaint, the groups said the State Department and
US Army Corps of Engineers violated the National Environmental
Policy Act by not adequately analyzing indirect and cumulative impacts of the proposed line.
They also said Congress has not fully relinquished its authority
to regulate pipelines to the federal government’s executive branch,
and that an executive order issued by then-US President George
W. Bush giving the secretary of state authority to issue permits to
export and import oil, petroleum products, and other fuels at US
borders did not include tar sands crude from Canada.
“This project will lock our nation into a dirty energy infrastructure for decades to come,” said Sierra Club Executive Director
Carl Pope. “Instead of increasing our reliance on oil and piping in
pollution, the State Department should support clean, American
energy and the jobs that come with it.” ✦

Tests reveal high productivity of Guara presalt find
Flow tests, limited by equipment capacity, on the Guara presalt
discovery well 1-SPS-55 (1-BRSA-594) drilled off Brazil produced
at about 7,000 bo/d, according to Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras).
From these tests, the company estimates that the well initially
could produce at about 50,000 bo/d and that the area contains
about 1.1-2 billion bbl of recoverable 30° gravity oil.
The well, drilled in mid-2008, is on Block BM-S-9 in the Santos
basin about 310 km off Sao Paulo state and 55 km southeast of the
Tupi 1-RJS-628A (1-BRSA-369A) discovery well. Water depth is
2,141 m.
The operator Petrobras holds a 45% interest in the block. Companies holding the remaining interest in the block are BG Group
30% and Repsol YPF SA 25%.

Lundin finds Luno extension in Norwegian N. Sea
Lundin Petroleum AB found a gross 40 m oil-bearing column
within a fractured basement on the Luno extension prospect in the
Greater Luno Area of the Norwegian North Sea.
The complex reservoir requires further analysis to determine
the resource potential and commerciality. Luno extension lies on
Block 16/1, and is south of the Luno discovery made on the PL
338 license in 2007.
The company said the exploration well 16/1-12 did not encounter the same pre-Cretaceous reservoir of the Luno discovery.
“An extensive data acquisition program was carried out on this
well, including coring and several mini drill-stem tests with the
successful recovery of hydrocarbon samples,” said Lundin Petroleum.

ATP Oil & Gas Corp., Houston, said the No. 3 well at its Mirage
field on Mississippi Canyon Block 941 in the deepwater Gulf of
Mexico found thicker than expected sands and logged hydrocarbon-bearing sands that weren’t present in the original wells.
Mirage, Morgus, and Telemark in the Atwater Valley and Mississippi Canyon areas are the three Telemark Hub fields that ATP
plans to tie back to the ATP Titan drilling and production platform
in MC 941.
ATP calls the Titan floating vessel, to be installed in October, a
minimum deepwater operating concept. It has a production capacity of 25,000 b/d of oil and 50 MMcfd of gas (OGJ Online, May
12, 2009).
The MC 941-3 well, in 4,000 ft of water, logged more than
250 ft of net oil and gas pay, more than double predrill estimates.
ATP set 75⁄8-in. casing at 17,089 ft measured depth through the pay
intervals.
Eight previously drilled wells had encountered 16 hydrocarbon-bearing sands, ATP said. Well depths are 20,000-24,000 ft
at Telemark, where no oil-water contact was found, and 14,0008

It used the Songa Dee semisubmersible drilling rig to reach a
TVD of 2,030 m subsea in 107 m of water.
PL 338 was awarded in the Norwegian North Sea licensing
round in 2004. Lundin Petroleum is the operator of PL338 with a
50% interest with partners Wintershall Norge ASA with 30% and
RWE Dea Norge ASA with 20% interests.
Ashley Heppenstall, president and chief executive officer of
Lundin Petroleum, said it was likely the Luno extension is not connected to the Luno field.

Drilling blocked in Colorado’s San Luis area
A federal district court in Denver has blocked drilling at least
temporarily in Colorado’s San Luis Valley 30 miles north of Alamosa.
The court granted a motion by San Luis Valley Ecosystem Council for a preliminary injunction against the US Fish & Wildlife Service. FWS, surface owner of the Baca National Wildlife Refuge in
Saguache County, had issued a finding of no significant impact
for the proposed Baca gas drilling project (OGJ, Nov. 10, 2008,
p. 44).
Lexam Explorations Inc., Toronto, said the decision prohibits
drilling until a final ruling is reached in the litigation.
The FWS finding, which followed a 15-month review process,
was the final approval needed for exploratory drilling in the nonproducing San Luis subbasin.
Lexam drilled two exploration wells in the San Luis subbasin in
the 1990s when the surface was privately owned and plans to drill
two more with 75% interest. ConocoPhillips has 25% (OGJ, Sept.
1, 1997, p. 78). The F&WS acquired surface ownership in 2000
and operates the refuge. ✦

18,000 ft at Morgus and Mirage.
ATP previously tallied the project’s proved and probable reserves
at 42 million boe, 76% oil. The additional pay sands should lead
to higher production and reserve estimates greater than currently
booked, the company said. Production start is set for late 2009 or
early 2010.
ATP is Telemark Hub project operator with 100% interest. ATP
had invested $1 billion through June, including $554 million in
the Titan, and expected to incur $500-600 million in further capital outlays through yearend 2010.
ATP’s vendors have agreed to absorb 45-55% of project capex in
exchange for a limited net profits interest.
The Titan will feed a 20-mile, 10-in. oil pipeline to the Shell
Mars oil system on MC 718 and a 62-mile, 20-in. gas pipeline
to the Discovery gas system in Grand Isle 115. The pipelines have
been installed.

The Chevron Corp. subsidiary expects the two fields will reach
peak production of 100,000 bo/d in 2011. Landana, discovered in
1998, and Tombua, discovered in 2001, contain 350 million bbl of
recoverable oil, the company estimates.
The 46-well project includes a 1,554-ft compliant piled tower
installed in 1,200 ft of water. The facility is designed for no produced water discharge and no routine gas flaring, CABGOC says.
The Angola Liquefied Natural Gas project, under construction at
Soyo, will process the Tombua-Landana gas along with associated
gas from other fields on Blocks 0, 14, 17, and 18. Completion of
the Angola LNG projects is expected in 2012.
Early production from the Landana North-1 well began to the
Benguela-Belize-Lobito-Tomboco compliant-piled tower in November 2006.
Operator Cabgoc holds a 31% percent interest in Block 14. Other interest owners are Sonangol P&P 20%, Eni Angola Exploration
BV 20%, Total E&P Angola 20%, and GALP Energia 9%.

project in Block 15 off Angola.
The Kizomba satellites will produce to the existing Kizomba A

Processing
Valero shuts Delaware City coker, gasifier
Valero Energy Corp. is shutting down the coker and gasifier
complex at the 210,000-b/cd refinery operated at Delaware City,
Del., by its Premcor Refining Group Inc. subsidiary.
The move is the company’s third major curtailment of operations this year.
“Both the coker and the gasifier complex at the Delaware City
refinery have been unprofitable, a situation resulting from the economic recession, declining demand for refined products, and poor
coking margins due to a decreased price differential between heavy
sour and light sweet crude oils,” the company said in a press release.
It also cited poor reliability and low operating rates of the gasifier complex, which it attributed to the facility’s design and low
gas prices.
“Regulatory issues and potentially significant capital expenditures contributed to the decision to shut down the gasifer complex,” the company said.
Valero said the shutdown will reduce the Delaware City workforce by at least 150 employees and 100 contract workers.

Petrominerales hikes Llanos basin production
Petrominerales Ltd., Bogota, said its Boa-1 exploration well, formerly B1, on the Corcel block in the Llanos basin is making more
than 6,000 b/d of 19° gravity oil, hiking the company’s output in
Colombia above 25,000 b/d.
Boa-1, which reached a total depth of 12,875 ft on July 25, is
producing the oil with less than 1% water cut from the Lower Sand
1 formation. Logs indicated 48 ft of net oil pay in the Lower Sand 1
and 2 formations, but Lower Sand 2 tests proved noncommercial.
Petrominerales, a 67% owned subsidiary of Petrobank Energy
and Resources Ltd., Calgary, is drilling the Corcel-A2 sidetrack targeting the highest point of the Corcel A structure to reach bypassed
Mirador and Guadalupe pay. The well is to be producing by the end
of September, after which the rig will drill two wells on the Guatiquia block Percheron and Candelilla structures.
Meanwhile, the company plans to core the entire Mirador zone
at Chiguiro Oeste-1, second of the 2009 three-well heavy oil exploration program in the Llanos basin. Coring and testing are to be
finished by the end of September.
After Chiguiro Oeste-1, the rig will spud Rio Ariari-1 on the
Rio Ariari block by early October.
Petrominerales shot and is interpreting 423 sq km of 3D seismic on the Castor, Mapache, Casanare Este, Casimena, and Rio Ariari blocks and a further 14 line-km of 2D data on Castor.
Company production averaged 20,679 b/d in August and has
grown to more than 25,000 b/d including Boa-1 and excluding
output of 1,300 b/d from Corcel-A4, which went offline Aug. 26
when the electric submersible pump failed. It is to be back on line
within 10 days. Larger ESPs are to be run at Corcel-C1, Corcel-D2,
Mapache-1, and Mirasol-1 by the end of October. ✦

It also said it expects to release more than 700 contract workers
this month at its 235,000-b/d Aruba refinery, which it shut down
in July and expects to remain idle “for an extended period.”
Because of its configuration as a heavy crude oil upgrading facility, the Aruba refinery was losing money because of narrowing
spreads between the prices of heavy sour and light sweet crudes.
Valero also said the Aruba refinery suffered from “looming local
tax burdens,” including a disputed tax on revenue and the expiration in December 2010 of a 20-year tax holiday.
In June the company shut down a coker and FCCU at its
315,000-b/d Corpus Christi, Tex., refinery. It also has trimmed
coker utilization at other of its refineries.

Contract let for Suriname refinery expansion
Staatsolie, the state oil company of Suriname, has let a project
management consultant contract to Aker Solutions US Inc. for a

Second huge LNG train starts up in Qatar
Another megatrain of LNG production has begun service.
Earlier this week, Qatargas 2 partners Qatar Petroleum and ExxonMobil Corp. announced completion of the 7.8 million tonne/
year Train 5. This follows start-up in the second quarter of Qatargas
2’s other 7.8 million tpy Train 4. Each train is about 50% larger
than any other liquefaction plant currently operating outside Qatar,
said the announcement.
QP holds 65% of Train 5, ExxonMobil 18.3%, and Total SA
16.7%. Qatargas 2 Train 4 shareholder interest is QP 70% and ExxonMobil 30%.
Qatargas 2 links natural gas production, liquefaction, shipping, and regasification infrastructure into integrated LNG development and supply.
In addition to Trains 4 and 5, Qatargas 2 joint venture encompasses a fleet of carriers and the newly commissioned South Hook
LNG terminal in Milford Haven, Wales (OGJ Online, Mar. 23, 2009;
Apr. 6, 2009). The South Hook LNG Terminal Co. Ltd. is owned by
QP 67.5%, ExxonMobil 24.15%, and Total 8.35%.
Qatargas 2 also has capacity to produce 0.85 million tpy of LPG

According to an announcement from Excelerate’s joint-venture
partner RWE AG, the vessel regasified and delivered 130,000 cu m into
the offshore port and directly into the country’s gas grid. The LNG was
loaded at Woodside’s North West Shelf LNG plant in Australia.
The Mina Al-Ahmadi GasPort lies about 25 miles south of Kuwait City and was built by Excelerate for Kuwait National Petroleum Co. Construction started in 2008.
The terminal is intended as an interim solution to meet Kuwait’s current gas needs, according to KPC, in advance of future

development of domestic gas reserves to meet industrial and commercial demands.
One of Excelerate Energy’s Energy Bridge regasification vessels
(EBRV) will be stationed at the existing Mina Al-Ahmadi south jetty
and can deliver regasified LNG at a baseload rate of up to 500
MMcfd, says KPC.
In addition, the terminal will incorporate a shuttle tanker berth
that will provide for ship-to-ship LNG transfer and boil-off gas
management capabilities between a conventional LNG carrier and
the EBRV, according to the company.
Other sites served by Excelerate technology and vessels are the
US (Texas and Massachusetts), the UK (Teesside), and Argentina
(Bahia Blanca).

InterOil moves ahead with LNG project
InterOil Corp. is pushing ahead with its proposals for an LNG
project in Papua New Guinea after submitting a project agreement
to the Papua New Guinea government.
InterOil, along with partners Petromin PNG Holdings and Pacific LNG, submitted the agreement for the construction of the proposed plant.
Both Prime Minister Michael Somare and Minister for Petroleum and Energy William Duma have voiced their support for the
$6 billion (Aus.), two-train LNG project that will have the capacity
to produce 4 million tonnes/year of LNG.
InterOil says the project also is supported by other key Papua
New Guinea government members.
According to InterOil, about 5,000 jobs will be created during the
peak construction period at the plant site and economic returns are
expected to fund public infrastructure and community services.
Although InterOil has yet to firm up sufficient reserves for the
project, the company points to two separate independent resource
evaluations that support the project agreement. It believes the likelihood of more successful gas and gas-condensate exploration has
increased along with the potential for commercial oil discoveries.
InterOil has targeted first production from the project as end
2014 or early 2015. ✦

Green jobs
The Obama administration asserts
that its big investments in “green energy” will create a large number of jobs.
President Obama wants to “harness
the power of alternative and renewable energy,” to create “5 million new
green jobs, good jobs that cannot be
outsourced.” The $58 billion on energy
programs in the stimulus package is
supposed by itself to foster over 450,000
new jobs.
The fact is that green energy subsidies lose as many jobs as they create.
Spain is perhaps the most aggressive
subsidizer of green energy of any
country, especially on wind and solar. A
new study from King Carlos University
shows that for every green job created
in Spain they lose 2.2 jobs in the industrial sector. That’s mainly from increasing energy costs which cause energy
intensive industries to move or close.
Unemployment in Spain is nearing 20%
despite its forests of towering turbines
and acres of solar panels on the Costa
del Sol.
The study notes that since 2000 Spain
has spent $800,000 to create each green
job.
US industry is developing renewable
technology in solar, wind, algae biofuels, etc. with research support from
the Department of Energy’s National
Renewable Energy Laboratory. We don’t
need additional billions to prematurely
implement technology that isn’t ready
for production and needs large taxpayer
subsidies to be competitive.
Proven and competitive nuclear
power and domestic natural gas have
the capacity to replace much of our coalburning electric power while greatly
reducing harmful emissions. They can
also provide the needed additional
megawatts as electricity powers more
of our transportation. Investing in those
cost-competitive energy sources will
create jobs.

Interests and credibility
By some ways of thinking, affiliation with the
oil and gas industry discredits whatever a person might say on the subject of energy. When an
industry representative comments on an energy
issue, too many politicians and reporters too
frequently reject the message as tainted by vested
interest or worse. A measure of skepticism is of
course appropriate when economic interests are
at play. But interests of that type often accompany
valuable expertise, especially with oil and gas,
about which outsiders tend to be strikingly uninformed.
Anything beyond rudimentary understating
of oil and gas, in fact, nearly always comes from
someone with a financial interest in the subject,
even if it’s just a wage. Antagonists easily exploit
the insularity: Don’t listen to the oil and gas
industry, they say; connection with the industry
makes information unworthy of attention. This
tactic, to the regrettable extent it succeeds in muffling the industry’s political voice and expertise,
exposes the US to costly mistakes on energy.

them responsible for not only their own emissions
but also those associated with use of their products. Yet the bill allocates to refiners only 2.25%
of the emission allowances to be available at no
cost to industrial emitters of greenhouse gases at
the start of the program. Emanating from so tilted
a structure, expressed worries about cost, even
from an industry with a vested interest, cannot be
ignored as mere “lies.”
According to EnSys, the bill would cut total
US refinery throughput by as much as 4.4 million b/d by 2030 while increasing throughput
outside the US by 3.3 million b/d. It would slash
US refining investments by up to $89.7 billion/
year—a decline of as much as 88%. And it would
cut refinery utilization rates from 83.3% to as low
as 63.4%. The broader economic effects, which
the study didn’t address, are easy to predict: lost
US jobs and incomes and lower tax receipts by
governments in refining centers, especially on the
Gulf Coast and in California; rising imports of oil
products; and higher prices for consumers.

INTERNATIONAL
PETROLEUM
AGREEMENTS—2

T E R E S T
In October 1973, key Middle Eastern
nations imposed an oil embargo against
the US and other Western nations. Oil
prices rose from less than $3/bbl in
1973 to $10/bbl in 1975 and then to
$13/bbl in 1978 (in dollars unadjusted
for inflation). The Iranian revolution of
1979, followed by the commencement
in 1980 of the 8-year Iraqi-Iranian war,
increased the bargaining strength of
other oil-exporting nations, especially those
in the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The oil
price peaked at $37/bbl
in 1981 (equivalent to
over $100/bbl in 2008
dollars).
For international petroleum agreements (IPAs), oil scarcity led to the demand by many oil-producing countries
for the newer production sharing and
risk service agreements or for a new
concession agreement with so-called
OPEC terms (OGJ, Sept. 7, 2009, p. 22).
These terms consisted of high royalty
rates (up to 20%) and taxation rates (up
to 85%), coupled with majority state
participation schemes.
In some cases, the new demands led
to nationalization by the host country
(HC).

In the low-price environment of the
1980s and 1990s, many host countries
adopted policies to promote E&P
investments in their territories by offering
more-attractive terms and conditions to
foreign investors.

State interest
One of the key objectives of OPEC
and other producing countries in
the early 1970s, prior to the 1973 oil
embargo, was to obtain a high state
participating interest in the existing
concession agreements.
18

Minority state participation was
already in force in several countries.
Kuwait, for example, had negotiated a
15% participation rate in a concession
with Aminoil in 1948 and a 20% participation option in case of discovery
in a 1961 concession agreement. Other
countries with minority state participation at that time were Iran, Egypt,
Congo, Gabon, Algeria, and Nigeria.
The New York agreement of Oct.
5, 1972, signed between OPEC and a
group of international oil companies
(IOCs), provided for a 25% HC participation to begin on January 1973,
increasing by steps to 51% in 1982. Indeed, a movement towards state majority participation or full nationalization
took place in the 1970s in several major
exporting countries. Among those
countries were:
• Venezuela (100% HC participation with the nationalization of the oil
industry in 1976 and the creation of
Petroleo de Venezuela SA)
• Kuwait (100% since 1975 in its
national oil company, Kuwait Oil Co.)
• Qatar (100% since 1975 in Qatar
General Petroleum Corp., now Qatar
Petroleum).
• The United Arab Emirates (60%
since 1974 in various joint venture
companies).
• Saudi Arabia (100% in Saudi
Aramco since 1980).
• Oman (60% in its national oil
company, Petroleum Development
Oman, since January 1980).
When HCs nationalized the oil
industries, they usually entered into
technical services agreements with the
former foreign concessionaire for the
provision of expertise or consulting
services without any direct access to the
production by the IOCs. For example,
Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela followed this course.
In OPEC countries where the concessionaires were not fully nationalized, such as Oman and the UAE), the
concession agreements continued but
were amended to achieve majority HC
participation and increased taxes on the
IOCs.

of 10%, rising to 20% in 2006, which led to a revised
marginal government take of 75% (in “old” fields) and
50% (in “new” fields).
The state of Alaska adopted a new profit-based petroleum production tax in 2006 to replace royalty payments in the concession agreements.
Some major oil-exporting countries, such as Venezuela, Bolivia, and Ecuador, radically changed some of
the conditions and terms under which foreign investors
operated.
Will this trend to impose harsher tax rates and
terms on investors in the petroleum business continue? Or will the IPAs and related petroleum legislation and regulations be robust enough to self-adjust to
price volatility, so that there is a fair sharing of profits
between HCs and investors over long-term business
cycles?

The real issue is how production,
profits, and the control of operations
will be split between the risk-taking
investor and the state as owner of the
subsoil.
Such flexibility is a key challenge in designing and
negotiating IPAs because price volatility is likely to remain a notable feature of global oil and gas markets.

Mutual adjustment
Early IPAs were the result of a certain political,
economic, and technical climate. When these original
factors gave way to new conditions, the IPAs and their
terms were modified accordingly.
In this context, the bargaining power between HCs
and IOCs is one of mutual adjustment in which each
party acts to further its own best interests when it is in
a stronger overall position and yields to necessity when
in a weaker position.
Nevertheless, the evolution in IPAs since World War
II has been decidedly lopsided in favor of developing
countries. Once freed from colonial rule, these countries have successfully asserted their sovereignty over
their natural resources, especially in an era of relative
scarcity in petroleum supplies and high oil prices, like
the 1970s.
From the mid-1980s to the turn of the 21st Century,
relatively low oil prices led to the privatization of some
national oil companies and the opening of acreage once
closed to IOCs, as bargaining power shifted in favor of
IOCs (except in the largest oil exporting countries of
OPEC). With the oil price hikes through mid-2008, HCs

The new Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) exists to tackle
challenges to our environment, our economy and the future security of our
energy supplies.
The Licensing, Exploration and Development Unit (LED) works to
promote exploration for oil and gas resources over the UKCS and
ensures field developments maximise the economic recovery of
hydrocarbons while paying due regard to the environment. We are
looking for talented and suitably qualified professionals to join us in both

You will be responsible for ensuring that "good oilfield practice" is followed
for the measurement of all petroleum won and saved in the UKCS. This
will include the inspection of relevant metering stations and attendance at
calibrations of primary measurement elements, both offshore and
onshore. You will also review licensees’ proposals for new/modified
measurement systems and the hydrocarbon accounting and allocation
systems applied to measured quantities.
The post will require travel within the UK and to offshore locations.

increased refining production, partially
offset by an overall decrease in refinery
gross margins.
Holly’s overall refinery gross margins were down 14%, but refinery
production levels increased 41% from a
year earlier due to incremental production attributable to operations of
the company’s recently acquired Tulsa
refinery and production gains resulting
from capacity expansions at the Navajo
and Woods Cross refineries.
Also contributing to Holly’s yearover-year increase in second-quarter
production levels were the effects of
reduced production during the second
quarter of 2008 as a result of a fluid
catalytic cracking unit outage that

of Canadian firms, only TransCanada
Corp. posted an increase in revenues in
the second quarter of 2009 vs. a year
earlier. TransCanada’s revenues climbed
5.5% on the strength of both its electric
power and pipeline segments, but earnings fell 3% from the second quarter of
last year due in part to higher interest
expenses.
Three of the companies posted a
loss for the quarter, including Ivanhoe
Energy Inc., Gentry Resources Ltd., and
Suncor Energy Inc. Ivanhoe also recorded negative revenue for the recent
quarter due to a derivative loss.

cially in North America, continued to
suppress financial results for a group of
service and supply firms.
Collectively, the sample of service
and supply companies posted a 53%
decline in net income in this year’s
second quarter. Revenues for the 21
firms declined 21%. Combined firsthalf earnings were down 40% from the
group’s first-half 2008 net income.
Six of the service and supply companies in the sample recorded a net loss
for the quarter, and five of those also
incurred a loss for the first 6 months of
this year.
BJ Services Inc., which recently announced a merger agreement with Bak-

A decline in drilling activity, espe-

er Hughes Inc. (OGJ Online, Aug. 31,
2009), recorded a second-quarter loss
of $32.3 million on revenues of $787
million, and for the first half of 2009,
the company earned $160 million.
BJ Services reported that the slide
in earnings in the recent quarter was
primarily a result of decreased demand and intense price competition
for its products and services in pressure-pumping markets in the US and
Canada.
Baker Hughes announced $87 million in earnings for the recent quarter,
a decline of 77% from a year earlier.
For the first half of 2009, Baker Hughes
recorded a 64% drop in earnings from
a year earlier to $282 million. ✦

Bain & Co.: Tough decisions loom on costs, investments
Tentative economic recovery and
volatile oil prices will force managers of the oil and gas industry to make
tough decisions soon, warns Bain &
Co., Boston.
Price gains in the second quarter of
2009 restored oil company profits hurt
by the slide in last year’s second half.
But they create hazards, the consultancy
says: Further price increases might slow
the global recovery and hurt efforts to
lower costs.
The uncertainty complicates investment decisions by oil company managers.
“On the one hand, they must continue to cut costs without compromising
on important areas like maintenance,
technology, and people development,”
Bain says in its Midyear Review. “On
the other, they must invest in largescale capital projects to replace declining assets and increase future revenue
growth.”
Project and exploration delays

IHS CERA: World oil demand set to rise next year
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
World oil demand is set to grow
next year for the first time since 2007
and is expected to reach pre-recession
levels by 2012, IHS Cambridge Energy
Research Associates said in its quarterly
World Oil Watch report.
IHS CERA expects oil demand
growth to rise by 900,000 b/d in 2010
and resume its 2007 high of 86.5 million b/d by 2012, which would mark a
5-year turnaround.
Oil demand dropped by 2.8 million
b/d to reach 83.8 million b/d in 2009.
The last time that the world experienced such a severe decline in oil consumption was in the early 1980s, and
it took 9 years for demand to return to
the 1979 high.
“There are a lot of questions as to
whether things will be different this
time in terms of the recovery of oil
demand,” said IHS CERA Chairman

Daniel Yergin. “While the answer is
that it will be shorter, it is still going to
take a substantial amount of time.”
Jim Burkhard, IHS CERA global oil
managing director, said key differences
between the current recovery and that
of the 1980s are accelerating oil demand growth from emerging markets
and fewer options for substituting fuels
on a global scale.
“In the 1980s, the largest area of
the demand decline came from power
generation, where oil was replaced by
readily available substitutes like coal,
gas, or nuclear,” Burkhard said. “Today,
global demand growth is coming from
the transportation sector in emerging
markets where there are fewer largescale options for switching fuels.”
Overall, emerging markets will drive
the recovery of oil demand. IHS CERA
expects oil demand to increase to 89.1
million b/d in 2014 from 83.8 million
b/d in 2009. The report anticipates 83%

of the oil demand growth will come
from countries outside the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development members.
“This near-stagnation of oil demand
growth in the industrial countries of
the OECD highlights several structural
changes,” Burkhard said. “Decreasing
oil intensity associated with economic
growth, higher fuel efficiency, the
displacement of conventional oil with
renewable energy sources, and a slower
pace of growth in transportation fuel
consumption—all these point to a
leveling off of demand in the industrial
world.”
While the trajectory of oil demand
seems certain, Burkhard said future
events always can alter demand.
“While our base case suggests that
2012 will be the year that global oil
demand recovers to 2007 levels, we
continue to research the alternative
scenarios that could alter the balance in
the oil market,” Burkhard said. ✦

system is more suitable,” said Lobao.
Under the proposed system, Brazil’s state-owned Petroleo Brasileiro SA
(Petrobras) will be the operator of all
contracts for E&P of the presalt layer,
while interested parties can seek contracts through a partnership agreement.
The production-sharing system will
apply to new contracts signed for fields
in 72% of the presalt area, while previously awarded contracts, which involve
28% of the presalt region, will remain
unchanged.

Public company, social fund
The government’s new model also includes the creation of a public company
responsible for controlling and monitoring the cost of E&P of presalt and the
administration of sharing contracts.
This company will represent the
country in the consortia and operating
committees to be created for directly
managing different sharing contracts

T E R E S T
and monitoring all activities in E&P.
The presalt development model will
establish a social fund that will set up a
means to direct revenues from presalt exploration toward investment in
poverty reduction, in education and in
science and technology.
The new social fund will take the
form of a public savings account that
receives income from various sources
such as royalties, signature, bonuses,
and commercial revenues from petroleum and gas, originated in production
sharing, and resources from activities
such as mining.

Reduced estimate
The announcement of the proposed
legislation coincided with a report that
Credit Suisse has reduced to 28.2 billion bbl from 50 billion bbl its estimate
for presalt oil reserves in Brazil’s Santos
basin.
According to the report by Brazil’s

state news agency, the previous estimate was made when potential reserves
of 8 billion and 4 billion bbl were announced respectively for the Tupi and
Iara prospects.
In his assessment, analyst Emerson
Leite considered a total of 19 blocks,
located in Tupi or its immediate surroundings, known as the presalt fringe.
According to Leite, the revision was
necessary because the region is becoming clearer as more wells are drilled.
He noted that in July two wells, drilled
respectively on BM-S-22 and BM-S-52
blocks, turned up dry.
“The market tends to get used to
more dry wells in the subsalt, given
that no exploratory area has a rate of
100% success,” he said.
Although he hasn’t raised estimates
for any areas, Leite made positive comments about the Guara prospect, on BMS-9 block. “We believe this is the most
promising area in the block,” he said. ✦

China urged
to quit Myanmar

A

ctivists have called on China to
halt construction of controversial oil and gas pipelines through
Myanmar, warning of instability and
civil unrest if the country’s ruling
junta continues to starve its people of
energy.
The Shwe Gas Movement (SGM), a
group of Myanmar exiles in Bangladesh, India, and Thailand, also said
the military’s recent offensive against
ethnic rebels near the pipeline route
showed the regime had no concerns
about providing stability for investors.
“People across [Myanmar] are facing severe energy shortages and this
massive energy export will only fuel
social unrest,” SGM said in a Sept. 7
report.
“These resources belong to our
people and should be used for the
energy needs of our country,” SGM
said, claiming that fuel shortages
triggered a series of protests in the
country in 2007, leading to the
deaths of 31 people in the bloodiest
army crackdown since 1988.

SGM and EarthRights International
issued in June a joint report claiming that South Korea is failing to
hold its corporations to account for
abuses linked to gas development in
Myanmar.
The report documents “conflicts

in Seoul and said South Korea is not
upholding international guidelines.

Forced relocations

The report urged the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development, which met in Paris at the
time, to investigate a complaint on
the issue that it said the South Korean
government had dismissed.
“The Korean government is failing to hold Korean corporations
accountable for abuses connected to

a statement.

Mexico to issue tender
for ethanol production
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Mexico’s state-owned Petroleos
Mexicanos (Pemex) will invite tenders
next month for a contract to produce
176 million l./year of ethanol, according to a senior government official.
Energy Secretary Georgina Kessel
said the bidding round, which will be
concluded in December, aims to promote ethanol as a transportation fuel as
part of a wider plan by the government
to reduce pollution and diversify the
country’s energy mix.
Kessel told delegates at a conference that the plan will help reduce the
amount of pollutants released into the
atmosphere while also guaranteeing the
development of Mexico’s food industry.
She said the project will first be carried out in the western state of Jalisco,
with 65,000 ha of sugarcane to be used
as feedstock in producing up to 176 million l./year of an ethanol-gasoline blend.
The project is being launched after a
successful test-run last month in Monterrey, where 151,600 l. of sugarcanebased ethanol were added to gasoline at
retail outlets, with 2.53 million l. of the
blend sold to consumers.
According to Finance Secretary
Agustin Carstens, the production of
biofuels will not endanger ecosystems
or food security in Mexico contrary to
warnings issued by several nongovernmental organizations concerned over
the use of corn—a dietary staple of the
Latin American country—as feedstock.
“In Mexico, there’s an agricultural
zone potentially suited for the production of raw materials for ethanol
production, especially sugarcane, sweet
sorghum, and beets, with no risk to the
country’s food security or to jungles,
forests, and the remaining natural ecosystems,” Carstens said.
The finance secretary said other
bid rounds will be announced before

yearend for Monterrey and the Mexico
City metropolitan area. Carstens said
126 million l./year of ethanol will be
required to support those initiatives.
In 2008, Mexico enacted a law to
promote and develop the use of biofuels, which also calls for production of
ethanol from different sources, includ-

ing algae, sugarcane, and corn.
In addition, the law also allows for
the production of ethanol from waste
leftover from sawmills, as well as
agroindustrial and urban waste and traditional agriculture and forest residues.
Mexico hopes that biofuel produc-

tion will enable Pemex to reduce its
imports of gasoline which, in May,
accounted for 39.2% of sales in the
country during the second quarter
compared with 40.5% year-on-year. In
terms of volume, gasoline sales totaled

Surface owner
notification

T

he US Bureau of Land Management quietly moved toward better relations with surface landholders
in July as some of its state offices
issued notices that those landholders’
names and addresses will be required
in expressions of interest (EOI) for
future lease sales involving split
estates.
“Once BLM gets the names and
addresses from the party submitting
the EOI, we intend to notify the surface owner of this, and send them a
notice if the tract goes up for lease,”
said Robyn Shoop, the agency’s acting senior mineral leasing specialist.
This will occur before the land
goes up for lease and give all parties
a chance to look at parcels and provide input, Shoop told OGJ on Sept.
4. “It’s a courtesy on our part because the mineral estate is dominant,
but it brings surface owners into the
picture sooner,” she said.
The notification’s time frame
could vary because each state office
prepares its lease sales differently,
Shoop said. The agency has asked
each state office to issue two consecutive monthly oil and gas lease
notices with this requirement stated,
she said.

wanted to make sure it was consistent bureau-wide,” she said.
Shoop said some smaller producers say the requirement could be an
added burden because they may have
to retrieve the name and address
from paper tax records at a county
courthouse. But the information in
other states and counties is readily
accessible online, she said.
“Surface owners appreciate this. It
promotes better interaction between
the subsurface lessee, the surface
owner, and the BLM in the long
run,” Shoop said.

West Virginia concerns

Surface landholders in West Virginia, where split estates primarily
involve private entities, also would
like to be involved sooner, noted David McMahon, cofounder of the West
Virginia Surface Rights Owners’ Association. “The only notice a surface
landowner gets now is when someone
who wants to drill goes to get a permit from the state,” he told OGJ.
McMahon conceded that many
producers contact surface owners before coming onto the land, but added

estimate for the project, FERC said in
its report. It said that TC Alaska also
is setting up a spatial data management system and completing aerial
photography of its proposed pipeline
route. “Similar to Denali, TC Alaska
conducted an infrastructure needs
assessment to identify its requirements for highway system and air strip
upgrades,” it said.
FERC noted that on June 11,
TransCanada Corp., TC Alaska’s parent, announced that it had agreed with
ExxonMobil Corp. affiliates to work
together on an Alaska gas line.
TransCanada said TC Alaska remains the project’s sponsor, that its
responsibilities as the AGIA licensee
with Alaska’s state government won’t
be affected, and that it will continue
as the project’s primary contact point
with government agencies and the
public. But TransCanada added that
it and ExxonMobil now are sharing
some expenses to advance the project’s
technical, commercial, regulatory, and
financial aspects.
FERC reported that in TC Alaska’s
first monthly status report on July 15,
project officials said they were continuing their study of a preliminary route
through Alaska that will be the basis
of engineering and cost estimates to
support its open season. TC Alaska also
said in its report that it has begun to
plan for a limited late summer geophysical program at specific locations
along the study corridor, including
work on the pipeline reliability model,
further integrating strain capacity and
strain demand elements, and frost
heave testing.
FERC said TC Alaska also met in June
with the Alaska AGIA State Pipeline
Coordinator’s office, the US Bureau of
Land Management, and FERC to discuss
regulatory requirements. Activities in
Canada included more meetings with
federal, territorial, and provincial regulators and with First Nation communities along the proposed project’s route;

Other projects
FERC noted that the Alaska Gasline Port Authority’s
proposed LNG export project would liquefy and load
gas shipped from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez onto tankers for sale on the US West Coast, Mexico, Hawaii,
elsewhere in Asia. It said TC Alaska has committed to
include an option of transporting gas for this project
within its open season for a line from ANS to Alberta.
FERC said it would have jurisdiction over this or any
other Alaskan LNG project.
FERC reported that Alaska’s Natural Gas Development Authority is continuing to develop plans to
develop intrastate gas pipelines, including a 460-mile
system of various diameters from Beluga in southern
Alaska to Fairbanks that would be used initially to
transport gas from Cook Inlet, and then connect later
to either the Denali or TC Alaska system to bring ANS
gas to southern Alaska.
FERC said Alaska is using in-state data to consider
four in-state gas delivery alternatives from ANS to
Cook Inlet: a pipeline along the Parks Highway, a
pipeline along the Richardson and Glenn highways,
a spur from a main line to Alberta along the Parks
Highway, and a similar main line spur along the
Richardson and Glenn highways.
FERC said Alaska intends to identify the preferred
alternative, develop the associated right-of-way, analyze costs, and facilitate discussions and agreements
between gas producers and customers. “Once these
efforts are complete, assuming the chosen project is
economic, the state will provide the private sector the
opportunity to purchase these assets and develop the
project,” FERC said.
It said the Office of the Federal Coordinator for
Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Projects (OFC)
continued work with the interagency to create a
consolidated plan. OFC is preparing a plan for each
proposed project, has completed the first phase of
one for the Denali project, and is working on the first
phase of one for the TC Alaska project, according to
FERC.
It said that the US Department of Energy’s program office for the federal loan guarantee process
for a natural gas pipeline from Alaska monitored
potential project’s developments from Feb. 20 to
Aug. 26. “When a more complete commercial
project emerges from Denali, TC Alaska, or another
sponsor, DOE will proceed with structuring the
loan guarantee program,” FERC said in its report to
Congress. ✦

Considerable unexploited resources
of natural gas in the US have been
largely bypassed due to unacceptable levels of associated nitrogen (N2),
which lowers heat content.
Natural gas that is laden with other
common impurities such carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and heavier hydrocarbons typically has less of a problem accessing local markets because of
the relative ease in which these
components can be removed.
Nitrogen separates from
natural gas with more difficulty,
but as a result many domestic
production opportunities have
been shunned by generations of
producers.
One such fairway of bypassed lowbtu gas (nominally, gas with heat content <950 btu/standard cu ft) is in central and southern Kansas. The authors’
premise is that small-scale and mobile
nitrogen-removal systems, when
coupled with good resource evaluation,
can reap considerable reward with only
small investment.
Substantial geologic and well-test
data from wells in this region indicate
possible, probable, and proved reserves

will require judicious adherence to

only when project costs are in line with
project revenues. Pressures and rates of
production must be diligently quantified in order to select the type and size

Recent advances in small-scale
nitrogen removal are now providing
a means for upgrading low-btu gas in

tcf since its discovery in 1922, and currently has 7,600 active wells. Its main
pay zones are several porous carbonate
beds in the Permian Chase Group.
Pay zones in the Permian Council
Grove Group (underlying the Chase
Group in Hugoton gas field) compose
the giant Panoma gas field (3 tcf cumulative production since 1956, 2,400 ac38

are nearly similar in quality at any
given locality. Low-btu gas is estimated
to compose 15% of Hugoton field and
7% of Panoma field (M. Dubois, personal communication).
Quantity is its own quality in
Hugoton field, thus most of its gas is
upgraded in large cryogenic gas plants
that also capture the helium. The

Small Permian gas fields in central Kansas east of Hugoton field also
produce low-btu gas from carbonates

processing also need to be considered
for either centralized or decentralized
wellsite upgrading.
Smaller, isolated low-btu gas fields
militate for on site processing. Skidmounted upgrading units are an
amenable solution, for these plants can
be moved to other nearby localities
when their gas source (a single or a few
wells) is depleted.
Farther east in central Kansas, lowbtu gas is present on the southern end
of the Central Kansas uplift, particularly
along a NW-SE trending faulted basement uplift called the Rush Rib, which
straddles the Rush and Barton County
lines (Fig. 6). Much of this low-btu gas
is in reservoirs that subcrop and are
directly above the basal Pennsylvanian
unconformity. The quality of the gas
degrades updip and northward onto the
Central Kansas uplift (Fig. 6) due to an
increasing percentage of noncombustible gas (mostly nitrogen).
As associated nitrogen is principally
a value inhibitor to a natural gas, few
studies focus on its source and migration. However, since nitrogen in
natural gas is usually present in a nearly
fixed ratio to helium,1 a new set of
economics comes in to play for produc40

ers willing to consider extraction and
purification the helium in low-btu gas.
Ancillary income is possible from
the capture and sale of helium. In general, helium-to-nitrogen ratios increase
with increasing age of the reservoir in
the Midcontinent (Fig. 3), and gas fields
with the greatest percentage of helium
are those that are dominated by lowbtu gas (Fig. 5).
Helium is linked to nitrogen in an
almost constant ratio of 8:1 for Mississippian and other reservoirs subjacent
to the basal Pennsylvanian angular unconformity. Helium content increases
northward and updip and exceeds 3%
in reservoirs at the north end of the
Rush Rib (Fig. 6).
The geological reasons for this are
not completely understood, but the
relatively low nitrogen-to-helium ratio
of the many gas fields along the Rush
Rib, in combination with the high percentage of nitrogen and helium, makes
this region a potential target for gas
upgrading through various engineering
processes.
The spatial distribution of low-btu gas
can be complex, with each stratigraphic
horizon showing different trends (Fig.
7). In general, shallower and younger
strata are exploration targets for lowbtu gas. Once it is found, an economic
success then depends on the engineering
solution to the low-btu problem.

Engineering solutions
From an engineering standpoint,
nitrogen is by far the most difficult and
expensive of all natural gas separation
endeavors.
Other problematic gases such as CO2
and H2S that are sometimes associated
with natural gas can be removed in
systems that utilize relatively simple
chemical reactions. Other constituents,
such as heavy hydrocarbons (propane,
butane, etc.) can also be removed relatively simply with refrigeration units
and at a reasonably low cost.
The shape and size of the nitrogen molecule is very similar to that
of methane. For years upgrading of
nitrogen-rich natural gases has focused
on the respective boiling points of
methane (–161° C.) and nitrogen (–196°
C.), cryogenically liquefying the methane and venting the nitrogen through a
system composed of compressors, heat
exchangers, and pressure towers.
A similar procedure at even colder
temperature can condense nitrogen and
separate it from helium. Well-designed
cryogenic systems work quite well, presuming these criteria: 1) high-pressure
inlet gas (>600 psig), 2) large inlet volumes (>10 MMcfd), and 3) stable inlet
volumes and gas composition.
In the early days, large cryogenic
nitrogen-rejection plants were placed in
geologic basins where nitrogen levOil & Gas Journal / Sept. 14, 2009

*The Hugoton ﬁeld perimeter and the southern end of the Central Kansas uplift are dominated by low-btu gas. Map also shows locations of large cryogenic-upgrade plants (red circles), IACX PSA plants

els were most problematic. However,
subsequent growth and integration of
natural gas transmission systems across
the country made it increasingly possible for lower-btu streams from one
basin to be blended with higher-btu gas
from another, mitigating the need for
nitrogen removal.
One by one, large cryogenic plants
fell off the map. The remaining plants
in the US were relegated only to those
basins where blending capacity was
limited or unavailable, such as Hugoton
field (Fig. 8).
From the mid-1980s forward, many
have tried and (mostly) failed to design
compact systems for noncryogenic
nitrogen removal. Large and expensive
nitrogen-rejection projects quickly
become wildcat endeavors when they
are placed on projects with even the
smallest degree of reservoir risk.
Lower or uncertain volumes of
natural gas cannot be economically accommodated by large, capital-intensive
plants because process turndowns can
yield enormous inefficiencies.
A handful of companies focus primarily on nitrogen rejection. BCCK Energy, Midland, Tex., utilizes proprietary
cryogenic processes to extract nitrogen
from higher-volume, higher-pressure
gas streams, whereas IACX Energy of
Dallas utilizes a proprietary process
based on pressure swing adsorption

(PSA), which allows smaller volumes of
gas to be processed.
The PSA process involves exposing
the raw natural gas to a specialized
carbon material that traps (adsorbs) hydrocarbons, allowing for the undesired
nitrogen to pass through the carbon
unaffected. Once a carbon bed is fully
loaded with adsorbed hydrocarbons, it
is depressurized and pulled down with
a vacuum causing the release of the hydrocarbon from the carbon adsorbent.
Molecular sieve technology can also
separate nitrogen from methane. A
membrane allows passage of one gas
species through it, and the residual gas
becomes richer is the retained species.
The economics for all processes vary
drastically with differing operating
conditions and gas composition.
If a producer has demonstrably
higher and sustainable volumes of
nitrogen-laden gas, then a larger-scale
cryogenic plant will probably yield
substantially lower processing cost per
thousand cubic feet. If, on the other
hand, a producer has gas reserves that
are more questionable or that produce
at lower volumes and pressures, then
a modular or skid-mounted system is
probably a better fit.
IACX Energy currently has 16 mobile
nitrogen rejection units operating, five
of which are in Kansas. Its process, “Nitrogen Sponge,” utilizes PSA to remove

nitrogen from natural gas streams at or
near the wellhead. IACX Energy guarantees its systems have 95% methane
recoveries, >99% C3+ recoveries, and
92% on stream time.
Throughout its existing fleet, inlet
volumes range from 100 to 700 Mcfd
with nitrogen levels ranging from 12%
to 41%. Lower throughput volumes
are possible, with commodity prices
being the only significant limiting
factor. IACX’s fees represent an “all in”
number, from dehydration, nitrogen
removal, liquids removal (if needed),
and compression into the sales line.
The company does not sell its units,
but rather it owns and operates them
on a lease/toll basis using a percentage of proceeds, or with joint-venture
agreements. IACX Energy also captures
and purifies associated helium gas,
where feasible.
An even smaller nitrogen-rejection
PSA system was developed in joint effort by the Kansas Geological Survey
and American Energies Corp., Wichita,
with aid of a grant from The Stripper
Well Consortium at Penn State University. This experimental plant utilizes
nonpatented technology and an adsorbent composed of porous activated
charcoal made from coconut husks.
During the 6-month test of this
prototype plant, inlet volumes averaged
150 Mcfd with nitrogen levels ranging

Feed-gas compositions, plumbing, valve
timings, and vessel pressures were subject to experimentation, and problems
with dead space in pressure vessels and
blowout of carbon dust were addressed.
With fine-tuning, approximately
75% of the nitrogen was eliminated
from the low-btu feedstock gas, 98% of
the C2+ hydrocarbons were recovered,
but methane recoveries were only 55%
to 65%, depending on feed-gas composition. The lesser efficiency of methane
recovery indicates that processing lowbtu dry gas (i.e., hydrocarbon component dominated by methane) will
have lesser economic feasibility with
42

this system than low-btu wet gas (i.e.,
natural gas with substantial ethane and
heavier hydrocarbon component gases).
On stream efficiency is difficult to
determine with only one prototype,
but AEC maintains this plant, once it
was fine-tuned, profitably upgraded
low-btu input feeds to a simple requisite minimum pipeline heat content of
950 btu/scf. This PSA unit, like those
of IACX Energy, is mobile and can be
moved to other wellsites at relatively
low cost once the low-btu resource is
locally depleted.

Summary
Several low-btu gas plays can be
defined by mapping gas quality by geological horizon in the Midcontinent.
Some of the more inviting plays
include Permian strata west of the
Central Kansas uplift and on the eastern
flank of Hugoton field and Mississippi chat and other pays that subcrop
beneath (and directly overlie) the basal
Pennsylvanian angular unconformity at
the southern end of the Central Kansas
uplift.
Successful development of these

cally upgraded and sold at a nominal
pipeline quality of 950 btu/scf or
greater.
Nitrogen is the major noncombustible contaminant in these gas fields,
and various processes can be utilized to
separate it from the hydrocarbon gases.
Helium, which is usually found in
percentages corresponding to nitrogen,
is a possible ancillary sales product
in this region. Its separation from the
nitrogen, of course, requires additional
processing.
The engineering solution for low-btu
gas depends on the rates, volumes, and
chemistry of the gas needing upgrading. Cryogenic methods of nitrogen
removal are classically used for larger
feed volumes, but smaller feed volumes
characteristic of isolated, low-pressure
gas fields can now be handled by available small-scale PSA technologies.
Operations of these PSA plants are
now downscaled for upgrading stripper well gas production. Any nitrogen
separation process should be sized,
within reason, to match the anticipated
flow rate. If the reservoir rock surprises
to the upside, the modularity of the
upgrading units is critical, for they can
be stacked to meet higher volumes.
If a reservoir disappoints (and some
will), modularity allows the asset to be
moved to another site without breaking
the bank. ✦

Diamond Offshore buys semi
Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc.
completed its $460 million acquisition
of the semisubmersible PetroRig I from
Jurong Shipyard Pte Ltd., a subsidiary
of Sembcorp Marine. The semi was
renamed Ocean Courage.
Previously, PetroRig I was scheduled to work in the Gulf of Mexico for
Petroleo Brasileiro SA. Those plans were
scrapped, and the semi was sold after

had bond debt, and that PetroMENA
struggled to arrange financing to complete the semi’s construction. Reuters
news service reported in late April that
Sembcorp Marine said Jurong Shipyard
terminated the rig-construction contract with PetroMENA for lack of a final
payment.
Lawrence R. Dickerson, Diamond
Offshore president and chief executive
officer, reported Ocean Courage was
acquired without any drill pipe. Several
potential customers have inquired
about Ocean Courage, which he expects to be available in 2010. As of Aug.
17, Ocean Courage had no drilling
contract yet.

In response to questions during a
conference call, Dickerson said he anticipates a day rate in the $400,000 range
for this type of semi. Negotiations will
hinge upon contract length and where
the semi ends up working, he said.
Diamond Offshore reported secondquarter 2009 revenues of $946.4 million compared with $954.4 million for
the same period a year ago. Dickerson
noted 88% of the company’s current
revenues came from contracts signed
more than 1 year ago.
Second-quarter profits were $387.4
million compared with $416.2 million
for second-quarter 2008.

Contractors stacking rigs
Transocean’s net income for the
quarter ended June 30 was $806 million compared with net income of
$1.065 billion for the same quarter
a year ago. The latest second-quarter
revenues were $2.88 billion compared
with $3.1 billion for the same period
last year.
Pritchard Capital Partners LLC
analysts said Transocean had 18 idle
jack ups, of which 15 are stacked. That
compared with 9 idle jack ups that
Transocean reported at the end of the
first quarter and 3 idle jack ups as of
yearend 2008.
Transocean executives expect to
have stacked 25-26 jack ups by yearend
2009. Previously, the contractor estimated 15-20 jack ups stacked by year
end. The company also told analysts
that it’s optimistic there will be longterm demand for deepwater floaters
off Libya, Israel, and Mexico, Pritchard
Capital said.
Chad C. Deaton, Baker Hughes chairman, president, and chief executive
officer, said the decline in international
rig activity appears less severe than the
dipping US rig count.
“We were awarded new work or
renewed international contracts in the
second quarter for more than $1.5
billion,” Deaton said. This included
contracts for intelligent completions
in Brazil and directional drilling off
Nigeria.

He believes drilling activity in Russia
and the Caspian region reached bottom
and has started to rebound. Meanwhile
he expects “activity in the Middle East,
Asia-Pacific, and Latin America regions
will increase modestly.”
Baker Hughes reported second-quar-

ter 2009 net income of $87 million
compared with $379 million for the
same quarter a year ago. Second-quarter
2009 revenue was $2.34 billion, down
22% compared with the same period a
year ago. ✦

facilities reach the end of their useful
lives, MMS has the obligation to ensure
that decommissioning operations protect the safety of workers and environmental integrity, in accordance with
federal regulations.2
From the operator’s point of view,
decommissioning represents a future
cost to be incurred, while from the government’s perspective, decommissioning represents a risk of noncompliance
and potential financial liability.
The government requires operators
to post a general bond on all leases
based on the amount of activity on a
lease to ensure compliance with rent,
royalties, environmental damage, and
clean-up activities not related to oil
spills, abandonment, and site-clearance.
When the cost to meet lease obligations exceeds the amount of a general
bond and the lessee cannot demonstrate
the financial capability to meet these
obligations, the regulations require a
supplemental bond.

and diethylene glycol. Typically, MeOH
is used in a nonregenerable system,
while MEG and DEG are used in regenerable processes.
The injected inhibitor may distribute
into three possible phases:
1. Vapor hydrocarbon phase.
2. Liquid hydrocarbon phase.
3. Aqueous phase, in which hydrate
inhibition occurs, and the inhibitor
affects the hydrate-formation condition. Therefore, calculating the inhibitor
concentration in aqueous phase and
total lean inhibitor injection rate are
important.

Models
There are several models for predicting hydrate formation in the presence
of an inhibitor. Correlations developed
by Hammerschmidt, Nielsen and Bucklin, Carroll, and Moshfeghian-Maddox1-4 predict concentration of inhibitors in an aqueous solution and lower
the hydrate-formation temperature.
Portability and simplicity are advantages of these correlations because they
are applicable even with a simple calculator, and the results are in good agreement with the experimental data.1-4 It
is to be noted that simulation packages
such as ProMax,5 HYSYS,6 and GCAP7

are available for predicting the effect of
inhibitors on hydrate formation.
The injection rate is a function of
feed-gas temperature, pressure, relative
density, hydrate formation temperature
depression, and lean solution concentration. Recently, the authors proposed
a shortcut, graphical method to predict
the required MEG or MeOH weight percent and flow rate for a desired depression in hydrate temperature of natural
gas mixtures.8 9
This article will demonstrate how
the diagrams can be used to determine
the concentration of MeOH in the rich
solution and the required total injection

*Based on Example 6.6, in Reference 10.

Campbell’s Gas Conditioning and Processing.10
This example states that 3.5 million
std. cu m/day of natural gas leaves an
offshore platform at 40° C. and 8,000
kPa. The hydrate temperature of the gas
is 17° C. The gas arrives ashore at 5° C.
and 6,500 kPa. The associated condensate production is 60 cu m/1 million
std. cu m. The amount of methanol
required to prevent hydrate formation
in the pipeline is to be estimated.
It should be noted that in this
example the composition (or relative
density) of natural gas is not given. To
demonstrating the use of these charts,
therefore, one assumes a relative density
of 0.6. With the feed-gas pressure at
8 MPa, a linear interpolation between
7MPa (Fig. 1c) and 9 MPa (Fig. 1d) is
applied.
The summary of known data appears
in the accompanying box on p. 54.
The presence of uncertainties in all
inhibitor injection calculation methods
prompts a safety factor to be applied to
the hydrate-formation temperature depression. For example, this case has the
HFTD set to the minimum flowing temperature. In practical situations, a design
factor such as 2.8° C. (5° F.) below the
MFT is used to ensure any errors in the
estimation method are covered and also
to ensure that the minimum temperature includes any upset process condition.
As an example, Fig. 1d shows the
location of HFTD, required weight
percent, and the total injection rate
of MeOH for pressure of 9 MPa for
this example. The results are tabulated
in Table 1, and Table 2 compares the
results of this work with those based on
the Hammerschmidt1 equation, Pro58

Max, HYSYS, and GCAP.
As can be seen from Table 2, agreement between the graphical method
and ProMax is quite good. The methanol injection rates as estimated by
HYSYS are significantly lower than the
other methods, and caution should
be applied in using HYSYS for inhibitor injection estimates. It is likely that
the differences in the natural gas water
dewpoint predictions are the result of
this discrepancy.

tables (beginning on p. 73) offer a variety of data for US oil and gas pipeline
companies: revenue, income, volumes
transported, miles operated, and investments in physical plants. These data are
gathered from annual reports filed with
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by regulated oil and natural
gas pipeline companies for the previous
calendar year.
Data are also gathered from periodic
filings with FERC by those regulated
natural gas pipeline companies seeking
FERC approval to expand capacity. OGJ
keeps a record of these filings for each
12-month period ending June 30.
Combined, these data enable an
analysis of the US regulated interstate
pipeline system.
• Annual reports. Companies that, in
FERC’s determination, are involved
in the interstate movement of oil or
natural gas for a fee are jurisdictional to
FERC, must apply to FERC for approval

material costs rising more than 25% to
more than $1.3 million/mile.
Higher-cost labor meanwhile affected the balance between estimated
and actual costs for both pipeline and
compressor projects completed in the
12 months ending June 30, 2009.
Actual land pipeline costs exceeded projected costs by more than $300,000/
mile, with a $360,000/mile difference
in labor costs more than compensating
for lower than predicted material and
miscellaneous costs.
Higher than anticipated labor costs
contributed the entire difference
between estimated and actual compressor costs, with projects completed by
June 30, 2009, running $137/hp more
expensive than had been predicted
and actual costs for both material and
miscellaneous expenses lower than
estimated costs.
The difference between estimated
and actual costs was even sharper for
offshore projects, with actual costs running nearly $2.2 million/mile higher
than estimates.

of transportation rates, and therefore
must file a FERC annual report: Form 2
or 2A, respectively, for major or nonmajor natural gas pipelines; Form 6 for oil
(crude or product) pipelines.
The distinction between “major”
and “nonmajor” is defined by FERC and
appears as a note at the end of the table
listing all FERC-regulated natural gas
pipeline companies for 2008 at the end
of this article (p. 77).
The deadline to file these reports

each year is Apr. 1. For a variety of
reasons, a number of companies miss
that deadline and apply for extensions,
but eventually file an annual report. That
deadline and the numerous delayed
filings explain why publication of this
OGJ report on pipeline economics occurs in the third quarter of each year.
Earlier publication would exclude many
companies’ information.

approved. Not all that are approved are
built. But, assuming a company receives
its certificate and builds its facilities, it
must—again, with some exceptions—
report back to FERC how its original
cost estimates compared with what it
actually spent.
OGJ spends the year July 1 to June
30 monitoring these filings, collecting
them, and analyzing their numbers.
OGJ’s exclusive, annual Pipeline Economics Report began tracking volumes
of gas transported for a fee by major
interstate pipelines in 1987 (OGJ, Nov.
28, 1988, p. 33) as pipelines moved
gradually after 1984 from owning the
gas they moved to mostly providing
transportation services.
Volumes of natural gas sold by pipelines have been steadily declining, so
that, beginning with 2001 data in the
2002 report, the table only lists volumes transported for others.
The company tables also reflect as-

The number of companies required
to file annual reports with FERC may
change from year to year, with some
companies becoming jurisdictional,
others nonjurisdictional, and still others
merging or being consolidated out of
existence.
Such changes require that care be

nonmajors did not describe their
systems. But filing descriptions of their
systems has become standard, and most
provide miles operated.
Reports for 2008 show an increase
in FERC-defined major gas pipeline
companies: 83 companies of 130 filing
for 2008, from 77 of 121 for 2007.
The FERC made an additional change
to reporting requirements for 1995 for
both crude oil and petroleum products pipelines. Exempt from requirements to prepare and file a Form 6
were those pipelines with operating
revenues at or less than $350,000 for
each of the 3 preceding calendar years.
These companies must now file only an
“Annual Cost of Service Based Analysis
Schedule,” which provides only total
annual cost of service, actual operating
revenues, and total throughput in both
deliveries and barrel-miles.

companies were no longer required to
report miles of gathering and storage
systems separately from transmission.
Thus, total miles operated for gas pipelines consist almost entirely of transmission mileage.
FERC-regulated major natural pipeline mileage edged higher in 2008,
reaching its highest level since 1995
(Table 1). Final data show an increase of
195 miles, or 0.1%.

Rankings; activity
Natural gas pipeline companies in
2008 saw operating revenues drop by
more than $1.9 billion, or nearly 9%
from 2007. Net incomes, however,
continued to rise, leading to a rebound
in earnings as a percent of revenue to
25.78%, the highest level OGJ has yet
recorded.
Oil pipelines saw much the same
dynamic at work, with earnings ris-

66

ing 4.67% despite slower growth in
revenues.
Liquids deliveries for 2008 via pipeline dropped more than 960 million
bbl, or 6.9%, led by a more than 11%
fall in product deliveries. Throughput
measured in million bbl-miles (bblmile: 1 bbl moving 1 mile) fell roughly
0.6%, by more than 21.6 billion
bbl-miles, with a products throughput
drop of nearly 152 billion bbl-miles, or
7.6%, more than erasing gains in crude
throughput.
OGJ uses FERC annual report data
to rank the top 10 pipeline companies
in three categories (miles operated,
trunkline traffic, and operating income)
for oil-pipeline companies and three
categories (miles operated, gas transported for others, and net income) for
natural gas pipeline companies.
Positions in these rankings shift year
to year, reflecting normal fluctuations in
companies’ activities and fortunes. But

also, because these companies comprise
such a large portion of their respective
groups, the listings provide snapshots of
overall industry trends and events.
For instance, the growth in liquids
pipeline earnings was driven by the top
10 companies in the segment, which
grew their share of total earnings to
61.48%, led by an 87.1% jump in earnings at the highest-income company,
Kinder Morgan Operating LP “A.”
Company financial data for all companies provide a view of the ongoing
condition of the oil and gas pipeline
industries (Fig. 1; Table 2).
For all natural gas pipeline companies, for example, net income as a portion of operating revenues rebounded
to 25.78% in 2008, more than erasing
recent declines and setting a new record
for the figure.
The percentage of income as operating revenues for oil pipelines also
rebounded in 2008, reaching 42.53%

after falling to 41.76% in 2007 from
nearly 44% in 2006.
Net income as a portion of gas-plant
investment countered the increases seen
in income as a portion of revenue for
natural gas pipelines, slipping to 4.83%
after having risen to 4.99% in 2007.
Even so, it remained above the 4.7%
level seen in 1998.
For oil pipelines, net income as a
portion of investment in carrier property in 2008 fell to 10.5%, continuing
a drop from the 11.5% reached 2006.
Income as part of investment in carrier
property in 2004 stood at 11.4%, having risen steadily toward that level from
6.8% in 1998.
Major and nonmajor natural gas
pipelines in 2008 reported an industry
gas-plant investment of nearly $105.8
billion, the highest level ever, up from
more than $95.5 billion in 2007, $88.3
billion in 2006, $84 billion in 2005,
more than $83 billion in 2004, nearly
$78 billion in 2003, $74.2 billion in
2002, almost $71 billion in 2001, and
$68 billion in 2000.
Investment in oil pipeline carrier

property also continued to rise in 2008,
reaching $39.1 billion, after hitting
almost $35.9 billion in 2007, which
in turned followed a rebound to $32.7
billion in 2006 from the lowest level
seen since at least 1997, $29.5 billion
in 2005.
OGJ for many years has tracked
carrier-property investment by five
crude oil pipeline and five products
pipeline companies chosen as representative in terms of physical systems and
expenditures (Table 3). In 2003, we
added the base carrier-property investment to allow for comparisons among
the anonymous companies.
The five crude oil pipeline companies in 2008 increased their overall
investment in carrier property by more
than $1.4 billion, or nearly 44%; the
same grouping of companies increased
overall investment in carrier property in
2007 by just $40.2 million, or 1.3%. All
of the companies in the group increased
their investment, but the bulk of the
increase came as a result of increased
construction expenditures at the largest
company.

The five products pipeline companies, by contrast, increased overall
investment in carrier property by $234
million, or 3.89%, down from the $463
million (8.35%) increase of 2007. As
with the crude oil lines, all companies
in the products pipeline group increased investment in 2008.
Comparisons of data in Table 2
with previous years’ must be done
with caution: In 2004, a major crude
oil pipeline company listed there sold
significant assets, making comparisons
with previous years’ data difficult.
Investment by the five product
pipeline companies in 2008 was more
than $6.2 billion, continuing a return
to growth started in 2003 when investment of more than $4.7 billion was up
from 2002’s $4.5 billion level.
Fig. 2 illustrates the investment split
in the crude oil and products pipeline
companies.

Tables 4 and 5 show companies’ estimates during the period July 1, 2008,
to June 30, 2009, for what it will cost
to construct a pipeline or install new or
additional compression.
These tables cover a variety of locations, pipeline sizes, and compressorhorsepower ratings.
Not all projects proposed are approved. And not all projects approved
are eventually built.

Applications filed in the 12 months
ending June 30, 2009, surged after falling sharply the previous year.
• More than 2,176 miles of pipeline
were proposed for land construction,
and no new offshore work. The land
level is up from the roughly 900 miles
of pipeline proposed for construction
in 2008, reaching its highest level since
the more than 2,700 miles proposed in
1998.

• New or additional compression
proposed by the end of June 2009
measured 644,755 hp, up substantially
from the 238,400 hp proposed in
2008 but still short of the 713,000 hp
reached in 2007.

• 115 land and 6 marine projects
(OGJ, Sept. 4, 2000, p. 68).
The disparity between the mileage
growth and spread growth in 2009
shows that many of the newly proposed projects are big, with 7 of the 21
measuring 100 miles or more and 3
measuring more than 300 miles.
For the 12 months ending June 30,
2009, the 21 land projects would cost
just more than $8.1 billion as compared
with the $3 billion planned for 19 projects a year earlier.
The larger number and scale of these
filings indicate the need to move newly
developed natural gas resources to consuming centers, despite current softness
in demand.
Projects’ cost projections indicate
much about where companies believe
unit construction costs ($/mile) are
headed. Estimated $/mile costs for the
new projects continued to rise.
For proposed US gas pipeline projects 2008-09 the average land cost was
$3.7 million/mile; in 2007-08, the
average land cost was $3.3 million/
mile; in 2006-07, the average land cost
was $2.7 million/mile; for 2005-06,
the average land cost was $1.95 million/mile; for 2004-05 the average land
cost was $2.2 million/mile; and for
2003-04 the average land cost was $1.7
million/mile.

Cost components
Variations over time in the four major categories of pipeline construction
costs—material, labor, miscellaneous,
and right-of-way—can also suggest
trends within each group.
Materials can include line pipe, pipe
coating, and cathodic protection.
“Miscellaneous” costs generally cover surveying, engineering, supervision,
contingencies, telecommunications
equipment, freight, taxes, allowances
for funds used during construction,
administration and overheads, and
regulatory filing fees.
ROW costs include obtaining rightsof-way and allowing for damages.
For the 21 land spreads filed for in
2008-09, costs-per-mile projections
for three of the four categories showed
increases, with only miscellaneous
charges easing:
• Material—$1,312,014/mile, up
from $1,045,846/mile for 2007-08.
• Labor—$1,414,728/mile, up
from $1,344,389/mile for 2007-08.
• Miscellaneous—$759,028/mile,
down from $837,246/mile for 200708.
• ROW and damages—$242,358/
mile, up from $154,729/mile for
2007-08.
Table 4 lists proposed pipelines in
order of increasing size (OD) and increasing lengths within each size.
The average cost-per-mile for the
projects rarely shows clear trends
related to either length or geographic
area. In general, however, the cost-permile within a given diameter decreases
as the number of miles rises. Lines built
nearer populated areas also tend to have
higher unit costs.
Additionally, road, highway, river, or
channel crossings and marshy or rocky
terrain each strongly affect pipeline
construction costs.
Fig. 3, derived from Table 4, shows
the major cost-component splits for
pipeline construction costs.
Despite the increases in other categories, labor remained the single largest
portion of land construction costs. Labor’s portion of estimated costs for land

pipelines, however, shrank to 37.95% in
2009, from 39.76% in 2008, 37.93%
in 2007, and 32.35% in 2006. Material
costs for land pipelines continued to
rise in absolute terms and took much
of the percentage share surrendered by
labor, making up 35.19% of total costs
in 2009 as compared with 30.93% in
2008, 36.44% in 2007 and 38.17% in
2006.
Fig. 4 plots a 10-year comparison of
land-construction unit costs for the two
major components, material and labor.
Fig. 5 shows the cost split for land
compressor stations based on data in
Table 5.
Table 6 lists 10 years of unit landconstruction costs for natural gas
pipeline with diameters ranging from
8 to 36 in. The table’s data consist of
estimated costs filed under CP dockets
with FERC, the same data shown in
Tables 4 and 5.
Table 6 shows that the average cost
per mile for any given diameter may
fluctuate year to year as projects’ costs
are affected by geographic location,
terrain, population density, or other
factors.

Completed projects’ costs
In most instances, a natural gas pipeline company must file with FERC what
it has actually spent on an approved
and built project. This filing must occur
within 6 months after the pipeline’s
successful hydrostatic testing or the
compressor’s being put in service.
Fig. 6 shows 10 years of estimated vs.
actual costs on cost-per-mile bases for
project totals.
Tables 7 and 8 show such actual costs
for pipeline and compressor projects
reported to FERC during the 12 months
ending June 30, 2009. Fig. 7, for the
same period, depicts how total actual
costs ($/mile) for each category compare with estimated costs.
Per-mile pipeline construction costs
for completed projects fell by nearly
6.4%, after jumping nearly 51% a year
earlier and more than 86% the year
before that. Sharply lower $/mile costs
for offshore work in the 12 months

Industry veterans Andrew Palmer and Roger King, two of
the world’s most respected authorities in subsea pipeline
engineering, have updated their definitive reference book.
The new second edition of Subsea Pipeline Engineering:
• Covers the entire spectrum of subjects about pipelines that are laid underwater—
pre-design, design, construction, installation, inspection, maintenance, and repair.

• Devotes attention to the important specialized subjects of hydraulics, strength,
stability, fracture, upheaval, lateral buckling and decommissioning.
• Contains valuable information from the authors’ respected short course on
subsea pipeline engineering.
• Offers an in-depth examination of marine pipeline construction.

ending June 30, 2009, balanced continued incremental increases in $/mile
costs of both material and labor for land
pipeline projects.
Even so, actual costs were 17.6%
higher than projected costs for the 12
months ending June 30, 2009, with
the price of labor running nearly 63%
higher than had been anticipated.
Some of these projects may have
been proposed and even approved
much earlier than the 1-year survey
period. Others may have been filed for,
approved, and built during the survey
period.
If a project was reported in construction spreads in its initial filing, that’s
how projects are broken out in Table 4.
Completed projects’ cost data, however, are typically reported to FERC for
an entire filing, usually but not always
separating pipeline from compressorstation (or metering site) costs and
lumping several diameters together.
The 12 months ending June 30,
2009, saw more than 295,000 hp of
new or additional compression completed, continuing the increases seen
the year before when the 196,000 hp
completed reversed previous declines;
96,000 hp having been completed in
2007, 106,000 hp completed in 2006,
and 153,000 hp of new or additional
compression completed in 2005 vs.
468,000 hp in 2004.
More than half of the 2008-09
horsepower came from five projects.
Actual compression costs ran $137/
hp higher than estimates, with labor
costs more than double initial estimates
overwhelming lower-than-expected
costs in the other categories (Table
8). Despite the year-on-year widening of the gap between estimated and
actual costs, however, $/hp actual costs
dropped by 34% from 2008. ✦

*Major natural gas pipeline companies as defined above (and in FERC Accounting and Reporting Requirements for Natural Gas Companies, para. 20-011, effective Feb. 2, 1985, beginning with 1984 reporting year). Beginning with 1996, major companies were
required to file mileage for transmission systems only. NR = not reported.
Source: FERC Forms 2 and 2A for major and nonmajor natural gas pipeline companies. Under criteria established for the 1984 reporting year (OGJ, Nov. 25, 1985, p. 80), major pipeline companies are those whose combined gas sold for resale and gas transported for a fee exceeded 50 bcf at 14.73 psi (60° F.) in each of the 3 previous calendar years. Nonmajors are natural gas pipeline companies not classified as majors and whose total gas sales of volume transactions exceeded 200 MMcf at l4.73 psi (60° F.) in
each of the 3 previous calendar years.

New reference pressure recorder
Here’s nVision, a new type of field
pressure calibrator that can be configured
to measure and record 200,000 pressure,
temperature, current, and voltage measurements.
It can display the recorded data graphically,
or graph the measurements as they are being
recorded on its high
resolution screen.
Stored data, or data
being recorded, can be
displayed graphically
where you can easily
zoom into and magnify
specific events or zoom
out to get a big picture
of your test.
The intrinsically safe tool promises accurate data under field conditions. Pressure
measurement accuracy is up to 0.025% of
reading, throughout the entire operating
temperature range of –20° to +50° C.

The nVision is also capable of recording
any parameter at a rate of 10/sec, suiting it for high speed measurements, e.g.,
pressure safety valve testing. The graphical
display makes it easy to view valve characteristics such as response time and repeatability, and the recorded data can become
part of a permanent test record.
The unit is shock and vibration resistant, includes threaded mounting points,
and is certified waterproof to IP67 (submersion in water to 1 m for as long as 30
min).

Employment woes
puncture hope for
green energy jobs
The latest failure of liberal employment
remedies should encourage the oil and gas
industry.
According to liberal theory, governments create jobs by spending money.
History suggests otherwise.
When governments spend money to
create jobs they move funds and workers
into activities with limited or no ability to
create wealth. Whatever economic good-

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

ness comes about proves unsustainable.
Governments must raise taxes to pay
for the increased spending. Businesses,
anticipating the new burden, trim spending. Then employment suffers as economic
activity slows, and governments face new
fiscal pressures. While governments can
employ many people, they can’t create
jobs. New jobs require new wealth, which
requires profits. Governments don’t generate profits. They employ people with money
taxed away from profitable activities in the
private sector. They don’t expand the workforce; they nationalize part of it.
In the latest demonstration of these effects, stimulus spending by the US government has failed spectacularly to create jobs.
As Rea S. Hederman Jr. and James
Sherk of the Heritage Foundation point out
in a Sept. 4 report, new job numbers refute
promises by the Obama administration that
spending would halt unemployment and
lead to labor-market recovery by the third
quarter.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate rose to 9.7% in
August from 9.4% in July—well above the
administration’s prediction of an 8% peak.
The number of workers employed fell by
216,000. BLS data further debunk recent
administration claims about 500,000-1 million jobs created by stimulus spending. In
fact, the share of the workforce represented
by newly hired workers fell to 2.9% in
June from 3.2% when Congress approved
the spending spree in February, which
was down from 3.8% before the recession
began.
These failures do more than discredit
liberal assumptions about governments
and job creation. They also discolor those
green jobs the administration touts in support of its state-centered energy program.
As a job creator, federal money channeled to noncommercial energy can be
no better than broad stimulus spending.
An important difference is the way hollow
promises for green jobs become proposals
for big tax hikes on oil and gas.

Deutsche Bank closing exchange traded note
Citing new limitations on the New York Mercantile Exchange, Deutsche Bank AG
said in early September it would close and redeem its popular $425 million PowerShares DB Crude Oil Double Long Exchange Traded Note (DXO)—one of the largest
leveraged commodity products in the US.
“We expect the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and US commodity
exchanges are on the brink of imposing a more stringent interpretation of accountability levels and position limits,” explained Michael Lewis, head of commodities
research at Deutsche Bank in London. On Sept. 2, there was the first joint meeting
ever of the CFTC and of the Securities and Exchange Commission to discuss how
best to “harmonize” financial regulations to protect the American public.
DXO “is likely only the first head to roll; we’ll have to wait and see what other
funds are affected by the new CFTC limits,” said analysts in the Houston office of
Raymond James & Associates Inc. The process of Deutsche Bank unwinding its long
oil positions “could put some serious short-term downward pressure on oil prices,”
they said. Deutsche Bank will continue to roll out commodity-linked products within
the new guidelines. Lewis said, “Although we do not believe this will have an impact
on other exchange traded funds or exchange traded notes in the marketplace, we
believe it has sent a minor shock wave through commodity markets.” The bank—
Germany’s largest—quit issuing new shares on DXO in mid-August.
Redeeming the fund could have implications for commodity prices, forward
curves, and volatility. “For example, assets under management of the DXO fund
stand at roughly $400 million as of Sept. 2. Since the ETN has a two-for-one exposure in the oil market, it has approximately $800 million invested in the West Texas
Intermediate July 2010 futures contract,” Lewis said, adding, “Assuming an oil
price of $68/bbl, this is equivalent to 11,750 futures contracts and consequently exceeds the position accountability levels governing the WTI sweet crude oil futures
contract listed on NYMEX.”
Government control
Governments have a history of trying to control energy and agricultural prices.
“Not only do these commodities constitute a large share of consumer spending
baskets, particularly in the developing world, but swings in gasoline and food
prices can have a significant effect on headline inflation and consequently aggravate monetary policy objectives of the central bank,” Lewis acknowledged.
So he’s not surprised the administration of President Barack Obama is focusing
on weeding speculators from the agricultural and energy markets. “In contrast,
the precious metals and industrial metals markets have so far not been a priority for regulators and, in our view, may be offering a place of refuge for investors
in the current environment,” he said. In the wheat market, already regulated by
the CFTC, there has been a growing dislocation between cash and futures prices.
US authorities blame much of this distortion on an increase in futures trading via
indices as a result of hedging exemptions. In recent months, Deutsche Bank has
been close to the center of the CFTC’s push to curb speculation in commodity markets. In August, CFTC revoked exemptions that allowed the bank to exceed federal
speculative limits on agricultural futures contracts. It gave the bank until the end of
October to reduce its corn and wheat holdings to within federal limits.
Until now comparable data on index trading in nonagricultural markets such as
oil and natural gas have not been reported by the CFTC, but that is likely to change
with improved data collection. However, Lewis said, “An examination of the basis
in other commodity markets suggests the experience of the wheat market is
unique. Indeed, one could argue that a much larger increase in crude oil futures
trading has occurred over the past few years, yet the basis in this market has not
moved to the same degree as that for wheat.”
Still, he said, “We doubt the absence of a dislocation between cash and futures
prices in energy markets will deter regulators from exploring steps to curb what
they believe is an excessive increase in investment activity in these markets.”
Lewis noted, “If this tightening in regulation occurs, we expect the appeal of
investing in physical commodity exposure will be enhanced, particularly for commodities that are cheap and easy to store such as gold. Ironically we believe the
CFTC’s steps may therefore increase the appeal for investors to take delivery of
commodities. As a result, what has tended to be a financial exposure to commodities becomes more physical with, in our view, a more direct impact on commodity
prices.”

FMC’s new Enhanced Vertical Deepwater Tree
(EVDT) just set a new depth record at Shell’s
Perdido project in the Gulf of Mexico: 9,356 feet
(2,852 m). That’s impressive, but so is EVDT’s
performance: It combines the advantages of
slimbore design with large bore production capacity.
It’s versatile – you can land the tubing hanger in
the subsea wellhead or in the tubing head. And you
can install it with a conventional rig equipped with
a surface BOP, for big savings. Which makes EVDT
a great choice at any depth.

We put you ﬁrst.
And keep you ahead.

COVER
This week’s special report on Brazilian Drilling and Production
begins on p. 39. A symbol of Brazil’s booming offshore oil and gas
industry, a jack up sits in Guanabara Bay, south of the 81⁄4-milelong Rio-Niteroi box girder bridge.The header photo, above,
shows part of Niteroi, on the east side of the bay, home to several
shipyards that serve the inudstry; the cover provides a view of the
west side of the bay, including Rio de Janeiro’s famous Sugar Loaf
(photos by Nina M. Rach).

Interest

Marcellus coming of age, says Range Resources
The initial rate averaged 7.3 MMcfd of gas equivalent for 10
horizontal Devonian Marcellus shale wells brought online since
October 2008 into a new gas processing plant in western Pennsylvania, said Range Resources Corp., Fort Worth.
The Marcellus, a hindrance to overall capital efficiency in the
past few years, will be “highly accretive to our capital efficiency in
2009,” the company said.
Seven of the 10 wells had initial rates of 3.5 MMcfd of gas
equivalent or more, and three flowed 9 MMcfd of gas equivalent or
more. The best well made 24.5 MMcfd of gas equivalent.
The company is producing 35 MMcfd of gas equivalent from
the Marcellus and is constrained by processing capacity. Eight of
the wells have been on line for more than 30 days, and their 30-day
average rate is 4.3 MMcfd of gas equivalent. The highest volume
well averaged 9.6 MMcfd of gas equivalent.
Processing capacity is expected to expand to 60 MMcfd in late
March or early April and to 180 MMcfd by late 2009-early 2010.
Target 2009 exit rate is 80-100 MMcfd net to Range.
A built-for-purpose rig is to arrive later in January, the first of
six that will replace existing rigs, and Range plans to exit 2009
with six rigs running in the play.
Range, which has cut more than 20 days and $800,000 from
its drilling costs in recent wells, believes horizontal well costs will
average $3-4 million in 2009.
Taking advantage of a streamlined permitting process, the company has a majority of its 2009 drilling permits in hand and has
secured water withdrawal and disposal capacity for several years.
Baker Hughes reported 23 rigs active in Pennsylvania in the
week ended Jan. 16, compared with averages of 16 in 2007 and 23
in 2008, when the state’s count peaked at 30 in the week ended
Nov. 7.

Future demand buoys Canadian shale, LNG projects
The US Energy Information Administration sees Canadian gas
shale formations as an increasingly important part of US natural
gas imports in 2009. In its “US Natural Gas Imports and Exports:
2007” special report published this month, EIA cited renewed
interest and optimism regarding unconventional gas recovery in

Exploration

&

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Canada following the successes seen in the northeast Texas Barnett
shale and other formations in the Lower 48 states.
EIA estimated 2007 production in the Upper Montney region
of British Columbia at 80 MMcfd of gas and expects this to rise
rapidly in 2009. The report listed Encana Corp., Apache Corp.,
and EOG Resources Inc. as having listed reserves in the area. Wood
Mackenzie Ltd., however, forecast recently that the market could be
adequately supplied without developing “expensive or challenging” shales such the neighboring Horn River (OGJ, Dec. 8, 2008,
p. 32).
EIA also cited other Canadian efforts toward meeting future increases in North American demand, including Irving Oil Ltd. and
Repsol-YPF SA’s Canaport LNG terminal in New Brunswick. The
terminal is Canada’s first and will be used to meet demand in the
US northeast and eastern Canada starting early 2009. Construction
of three 2.5 bcf storage tanks is complete. Total sendout capacity
is 1.2 bcfd, with the first phase of operations using existing and
expanded capacity on the Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline to move
gas into the US.

DOE makes ﬁrst direct oil buys for SPR since ‘94
The US Department of Energy awarded contracts on Jan. 16 to
purchase nearly 10.7 million bbl of oil for the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve. The awards were the first direct purchases of crude for the
reserve since 1994, it said.
DOE said it awarded the contracts to Shell Trading Co. and to Vitol Inc. to deliver oil to the SPR from February to April. It said that
it used revenues from the emergency sale of crude from the reserve
following Hurricane Katrina in 2005 to pay for the purchase.
DOE also announced contracts using the royalty-in-kind transfer program with the US Department of the Interior to Shell Trading and Glencore Ltd. for 26,000 b/d of oil.
These awards will result in the addition of nearly 6.16 million
bbl of oil to the SPR’s inventory from May 2009 through January
2010, DOE said.
It said both sets of awards resulted from separate contract solicitations on Jan. 2. DOE said it decided to solicit the oil following
sharp price declines during second-half 2008, which made the
purchases more economically favorable. ✦

arrived in Brazilian waters in late September 2008 and began drilling the Azulao well on Block BM-S-22. He said ExxonMobil chartered the rig for 3 years and expected to have its first results on
BM-S-22 by yearend 2008 or early 2009.
“Plans to drill a second well on the block are under way and will
follow immediately upon completion of the first well,” Rosenthal
said, confirming earlier reports that the firm would drill two wells
at the site.
The ExxonMobil discovery follows one by Repsol YPF SA,
which last week said it discovered hydrocarbons on Block BM-S-48
in the Santos basin, 185 km off Sao Paulo state (OGJ Online, Jan.
15, 2009).

Shelf’s Flatrock at 200 MMcfd and growing
Flatrock field in the Gulf of Mexico shelf is producing 200
MMcfd of gas from four wells, has more than 350 bcf of proved
reserves by independent estimate, and has the potential to grow,
said McMoRan Exploration Co., New Orleans.
Individual well rates vary depending on porosity, permeability, pressures, and hydrocarbon column, but the primary Miocene
Rob-L reservoir has achieved the highest output at more than 100
MMcfd.
The No. 4 well, which tested at 124 MMcfd in October 2008,
is making 60 MMcfd with a targeted gross rate of 90 MMcfd. The
field’s Operc section is producing in two wells and being completed in a third well, and the No. 6 well might penetrate the upper
Gyro section sands.
The No. 5 development well logged 155 net ft of Rob-L and
Operc pay, is being completed in Operc, and is due on line in
this year’s first quarter. The No. 6 delineation well on SMI 217 is
drilling below 16,000 ft towards 19,700 ft. It logged 40 net ft of
Rob-L pay.
The field was a July 2007 discovery in 10 ft of water on South
Marsh Island Block 212.

PTTEP writes off Janaka-2 well off Myanmar
PTT Exploration & Production PLC’s recent probe for hydrocarbons in Myanmar’s Gulf of Martaban was a disappointment.
Although natural gas was found with Janaka-2, the first exploration well drilled on Block M3, the discovery was commercially
insufficient, said the Thai state-controlled company.
Spudded on Sept. 28, 2008, the well was drilled to 3,351 m TD
and encountered one 4-m petroleum-bearing formation.
The tubing stem test was not performed, and PTTEP wrote off
$27.35 million, the cost of the well.
The results raised questions about the potential of the 7,770-sqkm acreage, especially as a previous well, Janaka-1 in PTTEP-operated Block M7, was abandoned earlier, although traces of gas were
discovered (OGJ Online, Jan. 2, 2009).
However, PTTEP Chief Executive Anon Sirisaengtaksin vowed to
continue studies on Block M3 and plans to evaluate the petroleum
potential soon for additional exploration. Earlier last year, PTTEP
acquired 500 line km of 2D seismic on M3.
PTTEP operates M3 and owns an 80% stake in it, with China
National Offshore Oil Corp. holding the remaining 20% interest.

MGM to test Mackenzie Delta gas discovery

MGM Energy Corp., Calgary, plans in February to test a discovery on Ellice Island in northern Canada’s Mackenzie Delta that
encountered four zones containing natural gas.
The deviated Ellice J-27 exploration well went to 2,102 m,
1,999 m true vertical depth, cut 57 m of gas-bearing sandstones in
the four intervals. The company will test two of the zones and expects test rates to be sufficient to gain regulatory approval of a significant discovery license to encompass all prospective reservoirs.
MGM planned the well, first in this season’s three-well program,
to test the Tertiary Lower Taglu and Aklak reservoirs in the footwall
or southern part of the Ellice Island anticline.
MGM will move the Akita-Equitak 64 rig to the Ellice J-17 location where it expects to spud by Feb. 1. Ellice J-17 is planned to test

StatoilHydro prepares Gudrun ﬁeld development

Petrobras cancels Papa-Terra platform bid process

StatoilHydro plans to develop Gudrun oil and gas field in the
Norwegian Sea using a fixed platform with seven production wells
tied back to existing facilities in the Sleipner area and the Karsto
processing plant north of Stavanger.
The company and its partners are designing the platform that
will incorporate a subsea system in Sigrun field connecting to the
future Gudrun platform. Later this year, the consortium will make
a final decision on the development concept.
Gudrun lies 55 km north of Sleipner in 110 m of water. The
high-pressure field has estimated reserves of 150 million boe.
The field was proved in 1974, and StatoilHydro became operator in 1997. “New technology, more information about the area,
and the existing infrastructure have led to the field development
now being realized,” the company said.
StatoilHydro has a 46.8% interest in the license. Marathon
Norge holds 28.2%, and GDF Suez E&P Norge has 25%.
The Sleipner area contains Sleipner East and Sleipner West gas
and condensate fields as well as satellite fields Gungne, Loke, and
Alpha North.

Petroleo Brasilerio SA (Petrobras), citing uncertain market conditions, suspended the tenders for building the P-61 tension-leg
well platform and P-63 floating production, storage, and offloading vessel for the Papa-Terra field, which lies in the Campos basin
off Brazil.
The company noted that proposals received had an excessive
cost.
Petrobras had expected the Papa-Terra field, discovered in 2003,
to go on stream in 2011.
The company has formed an internal working group to analyze
alternatives for developing the field that holds an estimated 700
million bbl of 14-17° gravity oil. Water depth is about 1,200 m.
Chevron Overseas of Brazil Ltd. is a partner in the field and
holds a 37.5% interest.

BP awards Angolan subsea equipment contract
BP PLC and Sonangol Sinopec Ltd. have let a $140 million
contract to FMC Technologies Inc. to manufacture and supply
subsea equipment for Block 18 off Angola. Deliveries will start
this year.
FMC will provide one gas export regulation manifold, foundations and controls, a high-integrity pressure protection system,
chokes, and two pipeline end manifolds. The equipment will be
manufactured in Angola and at FMC’s Kongsberg, Norway, facility.
The Greater Plutonio development on Block 18, BP’s first operated project in Angola, came on stream in 2007. It consists of 43
wells: 20 producers, 20 water injectors, and 3 gas injectors.

BP lets $100 million subsea production contract
BP PLC has ordered engineering and project management services and subsea production systems valued at $100 million from
Cameron for tieback projects and other operations in the Gulf of
Mexico.
The equipment includes four subsea trees, production control systems, a manifold, flowline connection systems, and related
equipment.
“Engineering work and procurement of materials began in the
second quarter of 2008, and [equipment] deliveries are scheduled
to begin in the fourth quarter of 2009 and continue throughout
2010,” Cameron said.
This is the first in a series of orders to be placed under a
2006 Gulf of Mexico framework agreement with BP, reflecting
their joint standardization and engineering effort over the past
2 years. ✦

Governors of 15 states have been lobbying Pemex to make the

Hector Ortiz, who met with Heroles regarding the proposed new
refinery, and presented a feasibility study to site the facility in his

refinery in 2009, the first in nearly 30 years.
Increased refining capacity is considered urgent, as the country has spent almost $12 billion on petroleum product imports in

FERC OKs Sparrows Point LNG terminal, line
The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has approved, with conditions, an LNG import terminal and connecting interstate pipeline proposed by AES Sparrows Point LNG LLC
and Mid-Atlantic Express LLC. If built, the terminal will bring
1.5 bcfd to the US Northeast. FERC will impose 169 mitigation conditions, incorporating all mitigation conditions recommended by FERC’s environmental staff in the December 2008
final environmental impact statement.
Staff concluded that the Sparrows Point LNG terminal and
pipeline project, with appropriate recommended mitigating
measures, would have mostly limited adverse environmental impacts. FERC’s staff said in the final EIS that the US Coast Guard’s
waterway suitability report for the project has “preliminarily
determined” that additional recommended mitigation measures
would be needed to make the Patapsco River, Chesapeake Bay,
and territorial seas suitable for LNG marine traffic to the proposed terminal site and responsibly manage marine and safety
risks (OGJ, Dec, 15, 2008, p. 22).
FERC also adopted the staff’s recommended pipeline route
variations, addressing conflicts in congested areas through the
northern portion of the pipeline route in Pennsylvania where
significant residential growth had occurred. FERC will require
site-specific residential plans for about 160 residences located
within 50 ft of the construction site.
AES plans to construct and operate the import terminal and
related facilities at an industrial port setting at Sparrows Point,
southeast of Baltimore in Baltimore County, Maryland. Sparrows
Point will increase the number of ships transiting as commercial marine traffic in Chesapeake Bay by 5-7%.
The project includes facilities capable of unloading LNG
ships, storing up to 480,000 cu m of LNG, vaporizing the LNG,
and sending out natural gas at a base-load rate of 1.5 bcfd.
FERC also authorized Mid-Atlantic Express to construct and
operate an estimated 88 miles of 30-in. OD natural gas pipeline,
48 miles of which would be in Baltimore, Harford, and Cecil
counties, Maryland, with the other 40 miles in Lancaster and
Chester counties, Pennsylvania, ending in Eagle, Pa.

Inpex awards contract for Ichthys LNG plant
Japanese company Inpex Australia and its JV partner Total SA
have awarded the front-end engineering and design contract for
their proposed Ichthys LNG plant in Darwin to a consortium of
JGC Corp., Chiyoda Corp., and Kellog Brown & Root—collectively
known as JKC joint venture.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

The FEED services, which will be carried out during 2009,
mark a key milestone in the $20 billion (Aus.) Ichthys project. Gas
from Ichthys field, in the Browse basin off Western Australia, will
be piped 800 km to the LNG plant planned for Blaydin Point in
Darwin Harbour in the Northern Territory.
The two-train project is expected to begin with production of 8
million tonnes/year of LNG along with 1.6 million tonnes/year of
liquid petroleum gas and 100,000 b/d of condensate.
The first LNG shipments are scheduled for late 2014 or early
2015.
Operator Inpex says it remains firmly committed to the project
despite the current global financial environment.
A separate FEED contract will be awarded for the offshore facilities shortly, Inpex said.

Woodside shelves OceanWay LNG terminal
Woodside Petroleum Ltd., Perth, has suspended its proposed
OceanWay LNG import terminal off the Californian coast near
Los Angeles just over a month after saying it was continuing the
project, but at reduced size.
Woodside still believes in the long-term value of LNG as a
source of clean, reliable energy for Los Angeles, according to
Steve Larson, Woodside natural gas president. However, Larson
said the impact of the current market conditions had led to
a withdrawal of the application to Californian authorities “for
the time being.” The decision was taken in the face of rising US
domestic gas production and lower gas prices.
The regulatory authorities have been notified.
In December 2008 Woodside reduced the number of regasification tankers for the project from two to one, citing community and regulatory concerns as well as a perceived fall in
customer demand.
The plan involved bringing LNG from Woodside’s Australian
gas projects, converting the LNG back to natural gas in regasification tankers and unloading the gas through underwater buoys
45 km off Los Angeles. The gas was to be piped into the southern Californian network via a hub at Los Angeles International
Airport.
Larson said the permitting process in California was challenging, but Woodside had been confident that its design was
safe and environmentally sound and would ultimately have succeeded.
Australian analysts say withdrawal from the project is not
particularly significant for Woodside and is unlikely to have
much impact on the company’s share valuation or its planned
workload in Australia. ✦

The warming joust
Regarding your editorial entitled
“Obama and climate change,” thank you
for a bit of sanity (OGJ, Dec. 8, 2008,
p. 24)! I also believe that people should
not be bullied out of questioning. Your
phrase “joust between believers and
infidels” says it all.
The Warmists really do speak as if
they are medieval evangelical preachers
and we have to have faith. Right. Here
in England we’ve had freezing weather,
the coldest winter in 30 years. Harbors
in warm Cornwall have been icing over.
There has been snow in Marseilles, bitterly cold weather in northern France,
etc. Remember the ice storms last year in
the US? The worst storms in living memory in China? I mention this to a friend
who is a Believer. “Ah, yes”, he says.
“It will get colder before it gets hotter.”
Again, have faith.
As well, there is a real risk of power
cuts starting in the UK in the next couple of years. Why? The European Union
has decided that many of the older, polluting, coal-fired power stations have to
be closed down, and the global warming
crew (by the way, this is a huge industry in Europe) are bringing lawsuits to
prevent replacements being built.
If you question the Warmist line, you
are put down.

are unique to OGJ. Some that readers
may have noticed include:
• OGJ style calls for the use of an
ampersand (&) to represent “and”
in a company’s name. It also calls for
the omission of commas in company
names, as when used before “Inc.” And
Company and Corporation in company
names are always abbreviated as Co. and
Corp.
• If a date line occurs in the current
year, the year itself is dropped. For example, Jan. 26, 2009, would be written
as simply Jan. 26.
• Measurement words used frequently, such as barrels per day, are
abbreviated (b/d) consistently.
There are many others. This editor
uses the stylebook as a reference when
compiling the surveys but has become
more acquainted with it as a member of
the news team.
Articles then move to the next stage
where they are edited. In preparing stories for posting to ogjonline.com, editors also must be familiar with and use

The end results are concise and informative articles for OGJ readers.
The news staff adheres to daily deadlines for each phase such as submitting
the electronic newsletter. Every week,
they also proofread the general interest
section after layout, ensuring that the
copy contains no errors and remains
clear to readers. In addition, the news
staff puts together the magazine’s OGJ
Newsletter-Quick Takes section, which
is about 3,500 words combining stories
in all the categories.
OGJ’s efficient daily and weekly
cycles have provided a smooth learning
venue for making this editor’s transition
from survey editor to also news writer
easier and enabled a new OGJ editor to
perfect her news techniques. ✦

Risky loans and ethanol
Before making any more fuel choices, Congress
and the new administration of Barack Obama
should compare a past governmental foray into
the energy market with the mortgage industry’s
disastrous unraveling.
The mortgage catastrophe, which has crushed
credit markets in general and catalyzed global
recession, has roots in governmental activism.
As a source of economic distortion wrought by
exuberant governance, it’s analogous to the everworsening problems associated with fuel ethanol.
The mortgage market collapsed at least partly
because the government encouraged lending to
home buyers who couldn’t afford the loans. The
motives seemed beneficent: promoting home
ownership; boosting construction; and ending
geographic discrimination in lending decisions. Yet
the consequences are widespread and dire.

risky lending on a scale the market would not have
done alone. Most of those steps occurred well after
the deregulation of financial institutions.
Fuel ethanol, too, has followed a sequence of
self-reinforcing moves characterized by deviant
consequences. Bewitched by corn growers and distillers, past Congresses and administrations plus a
number of states have decided that adding ethanol
to gasoline yields benefits justifying generous tax
credits. The benefits, mainly having to do with air
quality and supply extension, fall subject to habitual exaggeration. And the perverse consequences
are too frequently ignored.
It wasn’t enough for Congress to create a fuel
market for ethanol with tax credits for blenders.
Politicians felt obliged to enlarge the market with
volume mandates. When the mandates spawned a
gold rush as another gasoline oxygenate fled the

N T E R E S T
For the past several years, leading
major oil companies and independent
producers have believed unconventional resources to be key elements of
future energy supply. As a result, they’ve
poured investment capital into heavy
oil, shale gas, tight gas, and coalbed
methane. However, the economic crisis
and subsequent reduction in financial
liquidity in companies worldwide
threaten the growth
prospects for North
America’s unconventional hydrocarbon
resources.
In light of the economic climate, leading unconventional
gas producers are reducing their capital
budgets and, in some instances, shutting in production entirely. For example, Chesapeake Energy, citing wellhead
prices “substantially below industry
break-even costs,” curtailed a portion of
its unhedged Midcontinent production.
In just the past few weeks, oil sands
producers such as Suncor, Petro-Canada,
Nexen, and BA Energy have announced
project delays or cancellations.
So, as Canada’s Globe and Mail newspaper has queried, will unconventional
projects and jobs be incinerated by the
crisis? We believe not. Oil sands and
shale gas in particular have become pivotal sources of North American supply
growth. A number of elements support
the continued development of these
resources: the underlying fundamentals

pace at which companies sought to
exploit the resources. For example, the
Canadian Energy Research Institute’s
latest study estimates that capital expenditures of over $300 billion (Can.)
will be required during the next 20
years to realize the full potential of oil
sands resources. As another example, a
Booz & Co. analysis of 10 middle-size
natural gas producers found the median
company had outspent its operational
cash flow by 130% during the past 12
months. Clearly, access to capital is a
must-have for unconventional producers.
Now that capital is not readily available, the financial crisis is restructuring the competitive landscape. We hear
companies say they need to live within
their cash flow as there is little capital
available. Because of this cash crunch, it
is likely that some of today’s producers
of unconventional oil and gas will not
be around to benefit from long-term
growth. We believe those companies
with the foresight to cut spending
while identifying and acting on ways
to capitalize on market opportunities
can secure competitive advantage and
prosper.

The potential

Over the past 3 years, strong global
demand, robust commodity prices,
improved technologies, and readily
available capital led some companies to
expand production from North America’s unconventional oil and gas reservoirs. Canadian oil sands

Obama’s energy, environment strategies to be ‘mixed bag’
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
As Barack H. Obama was sworn in
Jan. 20 as the 44th US president, his
administration announced an energy
and environment program with provisions directly affecting the oil and
gas industry in several areas.
The strategy aims to save more oil
than the US imports from Venezuela
and the Middle East combined within
10 years by promoting “the responsible domestic production” of oil
20

and gas, according to information
posted on the White House web site.
It also embraces a “Use it or lose it”
approach to existing leases.
Proposals to reduce US oil imports also include enacting higher
fuel economy standards, putting 1
million plug-in hybrid cars on the
road by 2015, creating a $7,000 tax
credit for purchasing advanced fuel
vehicles and establishing a national
low-carbon fuel standard.

for America plan, the White House also
includes prioritized construction of
a natural gas pipeline from Alaska as
part of a program to create 5 million
“green” jobs by investing $150 billion
over the next 10 years.
The jobs creation portion also proposes clean coal technology development and deployment; greater energy
efficiency, including weatherization of
1 million homes annually, and ensuring that 10% of the nation’s electricity
come from renewable sources by 2012
and 25% by 2025.
In an effort to provide short-term
relief to consumers, the plan calls for
swapping oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to cut prices and cracking
down on excessive energy speculation.
Democrats in Congress proposed both
actions as oil prices approached $150/
bbl and retail gasoline prices broke the
$4/gal barrier early last summer.
Obama’s inaugural address included
references to excessive financial speculation, which several federal lawmakers
believe played a greater part in 2008’s
record-high oil prices than supply and
demand. “This crisis has reminded us that
without a watchful eye, the market can
spin out of control,” the president said.
Finally, the incoming administration’s energy and environmental
strategy calls for implementation of an
economy-wide cap-and-trade program
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by
80% by 2050. It also pledges to make
the US a global leader in addressing
climate change. ✦

BLM’s
Utah plans

rganizations opposing the US
Bureau of Land Management’s
latest Utah oil and gas lease sale were
elated when a federal district court
judge issued a temporary restraining
order Jan. 17 preventing BLM from
moving forward with the leases.

Urbina of the US District Court for
Washington, DC, will keep BLM from

said in a joint press release.
They reiterated charges that acreage near Arches and Canyonlands
National Parks, Dinosaur National
Monument, and Nine-Mile Canyon
in eastern Utah was included in the
lease sale after Utah’s BLM state office “hastily” approved new resource
management plans (RMPs).
“Under the Bush administration, [BLM] pushed through [RMPs]

sensitive and spectacular public lands
as the private playgrounds of the oil

the multiple use concept mandated
in the 1976 Federal Land Policy and
Management Act under which activities are supposed to coexist to the
greatest extent possible, Ogaard said.
“Under the new plans, most of
the new areas opened to oil and
gas leasing would carry some form
of protective stipulation,” he said.
“Many leases will carry stipulations
with respect to seasonally important
wildlife habitat. Only about 35% of
the land would be open to leasing
under the standard terms and conditions.”

Some key differences

A look at BLM’s Utah website
shows the differences between the
old and new RMPs. Acreage available
for oil and gas leasing was reduced
by about 100,000 acres. Land available for leasing under standard terms
dropped to 3.6 million acres from
nearly 5.2 million, while land for
leasing subject to controlled surface
use or timing stipulations rose to 4

Senate conﬁrms Salazar, Chu as DOI, DOE secretaries
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The US Senate confirmed Ken Salazar’s nomination as Interior secretary
and Steven Chu’s nomination as Energy
secretary on Jan. 20.
Five more of President Barack H.
Obama’s key nominees also were approved: Thomas J. Vilsack as Agriculture
secretary, Arne Duncan as Education
secretary, Janet A. Napolitano as Homeland Security secretary, Eric K. Shinseki
as Veterans Affairs secretary, and Peter K.
Orszag as White House Office of Management and Budget director.
Salazar said in a statement following
his confirmation that his first priority
will be to lead the department with
open decision-making, high ethical
standards, and respect for scientific
integrity. “I will work for a more proac-

tive and balanced stewardship to protect
our national parks and open spaces,
restore our nation’s rivers, resolve our
water supply challenges and address the
challenges faced by our Native American communities,” he said.
Salazar called Obama’s energy and
environment strategy “our moon shot”
for energy independence. “A national
energy policy that includes conservation, expanded renewable sources, and
wise responsible use of conventional fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas will
create jobs here in America, protect our
national security by reducing America’s
dangerous dependence on foreign oil,
and confront the dangers of global
warming,” he said.
At his Jan. 13 confirmation hearing
before the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee, Chu said the

nation faces both global climate change
and energy security threats. “Last year’s
rapid spike in oil and gasoline prices
not only contributed to the recession
we are now experiencing, it also put a
huge strain on the budgets of families
all across America,” he said in his opening statement.
“Although prices are now lower, we
know that our economy remains vulnerable to future price swings. We must
make a greater, more committed push
toward energy independence and with
it a more secure energy system,” Chu
continued. He said Obama’s energy plan
is aggressive, but achievable, and that
it would put the US on a course to a
better energy and environmental future,
create new jobs and industries, restore
US energy technology leadership, and
help form the foundation for future
economic prosperity. ✦

MMS also announced that it completed a final environmental impact
statement for the proposed Cape Wind
energy project off Massachusetts. The
agency said that it submitted the final
EIS for the 130-turbine wind farm
to the US Environmental Protection
Agency.
Responding to the OCS oil and gas
announcement, US Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee Chairman
Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) said on Jan. 16
that he expects the draft for a proposed
5-year leasing plan to raise concerns in
some coastal states.

‘A thoughtful approach’
He noted that Sen. Ken Salazar
(D-Colo.), President-elect Barack
H. Obama’s nominee to succeed
Kempthorne as Interior secretary, said

in a Jan. 15 confirmation hearing before
the committee that he would take “a
thoughtful approach toward this issue
that would feature close collaboration
with coastal states.”
Three groups applauded the new
5-year OCS leasing plan’s introduction.
“With natural gas demand projected to
increase by more than 40% by 2025,
supplies must be increased in order
for American Gas Association member companies to deliver gas to their
nearly 70 million customers at a fair
and equitable price,” said Rick Shelby,
AGA’s executive vice-president of public
affairs.
Thomas J. Pyle, president of the
Institute for Energy Research, said
that MMS’s announcement means the
federal government is taking the “first
meaningful steps toward delivering our
country and its people a secure, affordable energy future.
“As lawmakers on Capitol Hill continue to work on a government-directed

‘green jobs’ plan to stimulate our economy, today’s announcement presents
our country with two very different
choices: Either we can spend massive
amounts of taxpayer money on energy
that’s less reliable, less affordable, and
less powerful, or we can generate massive new revenues for the taxpayer by
producing energy that’s more reliable,
much more affordable, and significantly
more powerful,” he continued.
News that the federal government
intends to deliver energy resources consumers need is a welcome development
as the US economy begins a long road
back to recovery, according to David
Holt, president of the Consumer Energy
Alliance in Houston. “For far too long,
access to affordable energy was considered a given. The events of this summer
taught us differently, and today’s announcement by the Interior Department
provides the first real indication that
we’ve learned our lesson and are finally
prepared to act on it,” he said. ✦

IEA slashes 1 million b/d from
2009 oil demand outlook
Marilyn Radler
Senior Editor-Economics

as demand in the final quarter was
300,000 b/d lower than previously
estimated.
IEA also lowered its outlook for
2009 non-OECD supply, with a
100,000 b/d reduction in 2009
output from the former Soviet Union
based on less-optimistic company
forecasts, as well as the slower than

anticipated Sakhalin-2 ramp-up. However, IEA said, declining Russian output
would appear to be due more to a
punitive fiscal and regulatory regime,
which is impeding investment.
The Paris-based agency’s 2009 total
Russian supply figure now stands at
9.7 million b/d, implying a decline of
280,000 b/d from last year.
Estimates of supplies of natural gas
liquids from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in the first
half of this year also have been mildly
cut from a month ago. But IEA still expects OPEC NGL output to average 5.6
million b/d this year. ✦

The TRO blocks leases on about
110,000 acres of federal land in Carbon, Duchesne, Emery, Garfield, Grand,
San Juan, and Uintah counties.
Kathleen Sgamma, IPAMS government affairs director in Denver, said,
“We are obviously very disappointed
that the issuance of the leases will be
held up. This is a setback for energy
security and reducing greenhouse gas
emissions.”

Natural gas emits just more than
half the carbon dioxide of coal when
burned for electric power generation,
Sgamma said.
Oil and gas companies bought the
leases on Dec. 19, 2008. The earliest
that BLM could have cashed the checks
from winning bidders and finalized the
leases would have been Jan. 19.
Sgamma commented: “The purchase
of a lease is not a ‘green light’ to drill.

A lease is only the first step in a long,
expensive process, which can take
many years no guarantee of production.
Those protesting the sale often forget
that natural gas and oil activity in Utah
occupies much less than 1% of public land. With current technology and
industry practices, producers are able to
develop vital energy resources now, and
reclaim the land to its original condition soon afterwards.” ✦

Groups sue BLM over New Mexico oil, gas operations
The Western Environmental Law
Center and other groups filed a lawsuit against the US Bureau of Land
Management, claiming the agency
violated federal law in granting oil
and gas leases on public land in New
Mexico.
The lawsuit, filed Jan. 14 in US District Court in Albuquerque, claims that
BLM issued 92 oil and gas leases last
year that fail to address greenhouse gas
(GHG) pollution resulting from oil and
gas operations.
The lawsuit asked the court to
suspend the leases pending full compliance with federal law. The leases are in
San Juan basin near Farmington and
Carlsbad. A BLM spokesman said he
doubted any production had started on
those leases.
WELC said oil and gas operations in
New Mexico are conservatively estimated to account for 23% of the state’s
GHG emissions, second only to transportation.
“BLM failed to provide the public
with sufficient environmental information regarding the lease sales,” said the
lawsuit, which also said BLM has not
adopted policies aimed at more efficient
drilling practices.
Tony Herrell, BLM New Mexico
deputy state director, minerals, said the
agency has worked for years with industry to minimize emissions and make
operations more efficient.
“We’ve taken a pretty hard look at
this,” Herrell said of reducing emis26

sions from oil and gas operations.
“It’s a process of continual improvement.”
He noted US oil and gas production
contributed to lower GHG emissions
than does much of the oil and gas production outside the US.
Other plaintiffs in the lawsuit were

ed, Natural Resources Defense Council,

WoodMac: N. America to import more LNG
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Imports of LNG into North America
are set to increase to 4.2 bcfd in 2014
from 1.7 bcfd in 2009, according to a
report by consultants Wood Mackenzie
Ltd.
The report forecasts North American
LNG imports will rise despite increased
domestic production of shale gas and
the current recession that has reduced
demand growth.
“In light of recent history, and the
longer term outlook for growth in
domestic US shale gas, many industry
analysts and commentators have been
suggesting that the outlook for LNG
imports into North America is bleak,”
said WoodMac North American LNG
analyst Murray Douglas.
Although regasification capacity
has been overbuilt, Douglas said, “The

medium-term outlook for LNG in
North America is not as dire as other
commentators are suggesting, despite
the success in developing shale gas.”

Favorable factors
In 2008, despite lower gas prices in
North America than in Europe or Asia,
baseload volumes of 1 bcfd flowed to
the Everett, Elba Island, and Altamira
LNG regas facilities. WoodMac forecast
baseload imports into these terminals
will continue into 2009 and beyond.
With a significant proportion of the
82 million tonnes/year of new liquefaction capacity coming on stream already dedicated to Asian markets, there
is not a huge requirement for additional
uncontracted volume in the Pacific
Basin, especially given the economic
downturn on demand levels.

Petrobras to present 5-year strategic plan to investors
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Brazil’s Petroleo Brasilerio SA (Petrobras), pending approval of its board,
will present its latest 5-year strategic
plan to investors and analysts on Jan.
26, the company said.
Petrobras e-mailed analysts and
investors invitations for the presentation of the company's 2008-12 strategic

plan “in case the plan is approved by
the company’s board of directors.”
Petrobras has repeatedly delayed
the announcement of its investment
plans—which are usually announced in
September—amid the global financial
crisis and its impact on oil prices (OGJ
Online, Jan. 19, 2009).

Comperj project on track
Meanwhile, Petrobras’s downstream

director Paulo Roberto Costa, reversing earlier concerns, said the firm’s
$8.5 billion planned investment in the
Rio de Janeiro petrochemical complex,
known as Comperj, will be maintained
in the strategic plan.
The Comperj project, one of several
energy projects included in Petrobras’s
earlier strategic plans, is part of Brazil’s Program for Accelerated Growth
(PAC), an economic expansion program

Obama puts
Chavez on watch

I

f anyone in the oil and gas industry imagined the administration of
US President Barack H. Obama would
be soft on Venezuela, they will have
to readjust their imaginings.
Obama’s administration is now
on watch and has made clear its will
stand no nonsense—something that
emerged last week when the US
issued new restrictions for ships visiting the US after Venezuela.
“The Coast Guard announces that
it will impose conditions of entry on
vessels arriving from the country of
Venezuela,” said a notice by the Department of Homeland Security in the US
Official Register published on Jan. 16.
That, of course, was a few days
before the Jan. 20 inauguration of the
new president. Yet, unlike one or two
other directives of the former administration that were rescinded, this one
remains on the books.
“The Coast Guard has determined that ports in Venezuela are not
maintaining effective antiterrorism
measures,” the note added.

Special security
Under the latest restrictions, starting Jan. 23, all ships that have visited
Venezuela during their last five ports
of call will have to implement a special security plan, known as Security
Level 2, while in US ports.
The ships’ access points must
also remain guarded while in port,
a measure that means “additional
crewmembers should be placed on
the ship if necessary.”
The USCG can also proceed to
examine the ships, the notice says,
to make sure that “the number and
position of the guards” is acceptable.
It remains unclear how this mea28

sure could affect the cost of shipping
oil from Venezuela to the US, but it
clearly could have considerable effect.
After all, Venezuela, a founding member of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
remains one of the top oil suppliers
to the US despite all of the antiAmerican rhetoric coming from
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
over the years.

Concerns over FARC
Still, if you are planning on shipments of oil via Venezuela, you might
want to reconsider.
The restrictions were justified by
long-standing US concerns over terrorism. That’s reasonable enough, given
that the Chavez regime has long been
accused by the US and others of supporting the terrorist Fuerzas Armadas
Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC).
In fact, when Colombian forces
killed Raul Reyes, FARC’s second
most senior rebel commander last
year, documents recovered from his
captured laptop computer revealed
significant support for the rebels from
the governments of Venezuela and
Ecuador (OGJ, July 14, 2008, p. 48).
So, there is certainly potential for
FARC rebels to board oil ships bound
from Venezuela for the US, where
they could cause untold damage.
Obama is aware of that potential
coming out of Venezuela, having
recently accused Chavez of blocking
progress in Latin America and “exporting terrorist activities.”
As for Chavez, expect no change.
“No one here holds any illusions,”
he said, referring to the new Obama
government. “This is the US Empire
we’re talking about.” ✦

outlined by the country’s President
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva (OGJ, June 11,
2007, p. 31).
In 2007, Petrobras selected WorleyParsons to perform integration and
project management services, execute
front-end engineering design for utilities
and offsites, and provide other technical
services for the Comperj project.
In November 2008, however, as a
result of the mounting global financial
crisis, the facility was reported to be
facing “major obstacles” in the country,
with Petrobras having difficulty finding
partners for the project.
According to one analyst, the scenario of a Brazilian gross domestic product
growth of roughly 5% and very robust
demand, which were included in the
original financial model of the Comperj
project, was rendered uncertain due to
declining commodity prices.

Shaw Group wins commission
Despite those concerns, however,
Petrobras commissioned Shaw Group
Inc.'s energy and chemicals group in
November 2008 to supply its proprietary ethylene technology for its ethylene facility at the Comperj project.
Under the contract, Shaw will also
provide conversion furnace equipment,
basic engineering, and technical services. Shaw will provide the same services
to the recovery section of a petrochemical fluidized catalytic cracking plant.
Construction on the 150,000 b/d
refinery began in late March 2008 and
the facility, which will include first and
second-generation plants, is due to
come online in 2012.
The facility’s first generation units
are expected to manufacture 1.3 million
tonnes/year (tpy) of ethane, 880,000
tpy of propane, 600,000 tpy of benzene, 700,000 tpy of paraxylene, and
157,000 tpy of butadiene.
Its second generation units will produce 500,000 tpy of styrene, 600,000
tpy of glycol, 800,000 tpy of polyethylene, 850,000 tpy of polypropylene,
500,000 tpy of purified terephthalic
acid, and 600,000 tpy of polyethylene

LyondellBasell Industries ﬁles Chapter 11 bankruptcy
LyondellBasell Industries has filed for
reorganizational bankruptcy for its US
operations and Basell Germany Holdings. The filing does not include LyondellBasell’s other companies outside the
US.
The US companies filed for Chapter
11 protection in the Southern District
of New York in Manhattan on Jan. 6.
In other recent company news:
• The UK High Court has named
Ernst & Young LLP as administrators of
Oilexco North Sea Ltd. The company is
seeking buyers for the business and its
assets because banks refused to grant
loans to carry out its drilling and development program (OGJ Online, Jan. 4,
2009).
• France’s Total SA plans to help
commercialize Colorado oil shale by
acquiring a 50% interest in IDT Corp.’s
American Shale Oil LLC (Amso). The
transaction is expected to close during
the first quarter. The transaction’s value
was not immediately disclosed.
• A “battle of the minnows” is
shaping up as Sydney-based Drillsearch
Energy Ltd. has made an all-share,
off-market takeover bid for Melbourne
junior 3D Oil Ltd. Drillsearch is offering four of its shares for each share of
3D Oil.
• Repsol YPF SA, repeating announcements it made last fall, has told
an investors’ conference it will spend
€500 million in 2008-12 to develop
the Carioca discovery in Brazil’s presalt
region.

LyondellBasell bankruptcy
During Jan. 8 court proceedings,
executives said LyondellBasell needed
immediate funds to pay more than $1
billion in debt and had run out of cash
to finance operations.
US Bankruptcy Judge Robert Gerber
approved the company’s request to access $2.167 billion in interim debtor-

in-possession financing from a group
of lenders and also approved a separate
$100 million super priority emergency
loan being provided by Citibank.
“During the past two quarters,
we have seen a dramatic softening in
demand for our products and unprecedented volatility in raw materials costs,”
Volker Trautz, LyondellBasell chief executive officer, said in a company news
release.
Trautz called December “particularly difficult, as many of our customers postponed orders to reduce their
inventories.” LyondellBasell expects its
economic crunch will be short term
and expects customers to increase their
purchasing in 2009.
He called LyondellBasell’s core businesses of fuels, chemicals, plastics, and
technology “fundamental to the global
economy.”
LyondellBasell Industries is based in
The Netherlands and privately owned
by Access Industries, founded in 1986
by US industrialist Leonard Blavatnik.
Basell International Holdings paid
$12.7 billion for Houston-based Lyondell Chemical last year.

E&Y seeks Oilexco buyers
Oilexco has fields in the UK North
Sea with proven oil reserves, which
produce 16,000 b/d. Some of its key
operations are the Brenda and Nicol
fields. The Shelley field is being drilled
and is expected to produce more than
30,000 b/d.
E&Y said it received enquiries from
several interested parties that wished to
buy the whole or part of the company’s
business and assets. In the interim, it
plans to continue with existing operations.
RBC Capital Markets said the company’s administration process would
probably mean reduced rig commitments and cash for shareholders,

assuming a price of $50/bbl and bids
for its assets. It warned that potential
buyers could snap up the assets cheaply
as sources of capital have dried up and
potential bidders are hoarding cash.
“Any sale proceeds would go first to
the banks that have lent some $700 million to the company. The administrator
would then look to settle the company’s
outstanding unsecured liabilities, some
$200 million,” RBC Capital Markets
added.
Oilexco Inc., Calgary, the parent
company, will be delisted from the
Toronto Stock Exchange at the close of
market on Feb. 9, “for failure to meet
the continued listing requirements.”

Total’s Colorado shale stake
Total’s agreement calls for the French
company and IDT, a multinational
holding company, to jointly develop,
produce, and commercialize shale oil
using a new in-situ technology on
Amso’s federal research lease acreage in
western Colorado.
Total will provide funding during
the research, development, and demonstration phase of the project, and
technical assistance throughout the life
of the project.
Amso is going to manage operations
during the RD&D phase, and then Total
will assume management responsibilities during the subsequent commercial
phase.
“Our investment in Amso furthers
our commitment to developing unconventional hydrocarbons,” said Yves-Louis Darricarrere, Total’s E&P president.

Drillsearch moves on 3D Oil
3D Oil immediately responded by
telling shareholders to reject the offer,
which it said does not reflect the company’s true value.

the Bass Strait as well as cash reserves of
about $12 million (Aus.).
Drillsearch has an extensive portfolio
of exploration and production assets in
Australia, Papua New Guinea, and Canada.
Key production comes from the Surat
and Cooper basins, and it has yet-to-be
developed fields in the offshore Bonaparte
basin off northern Australia. The company
moved to a 19.9% holding in 3D Oil
prior to the takeover announcement.

Repsol YPF’s Brazil plans
Repsol YPF has a 25% stake in the
Santos basin BM-S-9 Block that contains the Carioca find, while Brazil’s
mixed capital Petroleo Brasilerio SA
(Petrobras) holds 45%, and BG Group

holds the remaining 30%.
The investment announcement follows Repsol YPF’s report last week to
Brazil’s hydrocarbons regulator Agencia Nacional do Petroleo (ANP) that it
discovered hydrocarbons on BM-S-48
Block, 185 km off Sao Paulo state (OGJ
Online, Jan. 15, 2009).
The consortium hasn’t yet made an
official reserves estimate for Carioca,
but the head of ANP in April said the
find could contain 33 billion boe, possibly making it one of the biggest oil
finds ever.
Repsol YPF in its 2008-12 capital expenditure plan has earmarked
€12.3 billion in investments in key

Apache founder, longtime chairman retires
Raymond Plank, founder and
longtime chairman of Apache Corp.,
Houston, retired Jan. 15
after 54 years with the
ﬁrm that he grew from
a pioneer public drilling
program to one of the
largest publicly traded
independent oil and
gas producers in the
Plank
industry, with international operations and a market value of
$25 billion.
Plank’s plain-spoken, in-your-face
style as an industry maverick has left its
imprint on Apache’s corporate culture.
When one industry association tabled
a proposal calling for an import tax to
set a ﬂoor for domestic oil in the 1980s,
Plank led a ﬂoor ﬁght and the subsequent walkout by a large segment of
the members to stage a rump-session
attended by most of the news reporters
who had been covering the convention.
In the mid-1990s, he led a nationwide group of independent producers, state trade organizations, the
Independent Producers Association
of America, and royalty owners in an
effort to secure limited exemption from

30

antitrust laws so natural gas producers
could form marketing cooperatives.
Plank was a vocal and persistent critic
of megamarketers of crude, natural gas,
and electricity years before the fall of
Enron Corp.
While many independents were satisﬁed to operate only in the US, Apache
in the 1990s became one of the largest
leaseholders off Western Australia and a
major participant in Egypt.
A graduate of Yale University, Plank

executive ofﬁcer of Apache in 1966-2002,
and chairman since 1979.
Apache diversiﬁed into real estate in
1959 and into agriculture in 1970. It went
public in 1969. In 1981 Apache created

Last September, Brazil’s Expansion
newspaper reported that Repsol YPF
would invest €500 million in Brazil
as part of a strategic plan intended to
almost treble the firm’s annual profits
during 2008-12.
The report said the group had begun
drilling at a number of sites in Santos
oil field off Brazil, described as “one of
the regions with the greatest potential
oil reserves in the world.”
In early October, Repsol YPF began
drilling wells in the Santos basin, using
the Sovereign Explorer semisubmersible
rig, which was to be deployed on the
BM-S-48 Block, in 5,000 m of water,
120 km off Ilha Bela, Sao Paulo. ✦

Apache sold the last of its non-oil and

managing oil and gas investments, and
restructured as a pure exploration and
production company.
Its 1991 acquisition of the MW Petroleum Corp. subsidiary from Amoco
Corp. for $545 million was a critical
event in Apache’s history. It doubled the
company’s size, obtained a position in
the Permian basin of West Texas, and
shifted the center of Apache’s geographical mass to the Gulf Coast, precipitating
its move to Houston in 1992. That investment still contributes to Apache’s bottom
line. But in his characteristic manner, the
irascible Plank publicly said he made the
move because “this is where the industry is circling its wagons.”
Inscribed on a fountain outside the
company’s Houston headquarters, is a
1964 quote from Plank: “The capacity of
the individual is inﬁnite. Limitations are
largely of habit, convention, acceptance
of things as they are, fear or lack of selfconﬁdence.” G. Steven Farris, Apache’s
president, chief executive ofﬁcer, and
chief operating ofﬁcer since 2002, succeeds Plank as chairman. He said, “Raymond Plank is Apache. His commitment
and drive are embedded in the fabric of
Apache’s culture.”

P L O R A T I O N

The traditional go-slow approach of
the Iraq Petroleum Co. and its associated
companies, its ability to shift exploration and production to where it best
served its interests and to strengthen
its negotiating power; as well as Iraq’s
politically-driven, confrontational
oil policy, unnecessary and destructive wars, and years of sanctions, have
proven to be serious impediments to
the development of Iraq’s oil industry.
Today, there are further serious obstacles that limit the Iraqi government’s
ability to govern effectively and to promote cooperative and coordinated policies by the different components within
any ministry or between ministries.
These involve failed state impediments,
ethnosectarian divisions, widespread
corruption, and the near absence of
functioning institutions and proficient
human resources.
This is demonstrated, for example,
in the Kurdistan Regional Government’s unilateral decision to manage
oil and gas resources within the region
and so called “contested territories”
without reference to the Iraqi national
government, parliament, or the central
Ministry of Oil, forcing the ministry to
pursue its own development policy.
Both are disadvantaged by the absence of a national petroleum law and
the benefits of approved regulated oil
policy and plans. There is a risk, indeed
for both, that such contracts be judged
illegal as long as they have not been
passed by the national parliament.
Provided that Iraq’s development and
exploration policy can be implemented
in an era free from current impediments, Iraq’s large oil resource base
and its low finding and development
costs should put Iraq’s oil industry on
track for a major contribution to the
world’s energy requirements in the 21st
century.

The stalled petroleum law
The Ministry of Oil presented its
draft petroleum law to the Council of
Ministers in September 2006. The council in turn formed a ministerial committee to examine the draft.
Ethnosectarian interests, expressed
mainly by the KRG, not unsupported
by sectarian interests, stretched out the
negotiations for over a year and resulted
in three revisions by the ministerial
committee, with each in turn rejected
by the KRG’s political leaders for one
reason or another. It had made the
enactment of the petroleum law subject
to their agreement on the draft laws
for the INOC, the organization of the
Ministry of Oil, and the distribution of
oil and gas.

Model upstream contracts
The Ministry of Oil is adopting four
model upstream contracts that are based
on the service-type contract formula,
in exclusion of all the earlier PSA and
buyback versions.
The draft models were recently used
as a basis for discussions with ONGC
Videsh, China National Petroleum Co.,
and Petrovietnam. The “Oilfield Service
Development and Production Contract”
(OSDPC) model was in fact adopted as
the basis for the recent contract with
CNPC. The four standard models are:
• Service Exploration and Production
Contract (SEPC)
• Oilfield Service Development and
Production Contract (OSDPC)
• Gas Field Service Development and
Production Contract (GSDPC)
• Producing Field Technical Service
Contract (PFTSC)

Cultural impact
Historically, the major international
oil companies in the Middle East had
established the largest industry, and at
times the only industry, in any one oilproducing country.
They demonstrated a high degree of
efficiency, unmatched in any one country. They became the largest provider of
revenue to the state and gained great
economic and political power. However, they formed distinctive enclaves,
foreign and privileged and, thus, the
terms ‘concession’ and ‘concessionaire’
developed controversial implications.
As a result, they became further
associated with the colonial era, as
the Middle East major oil producing
countries were under direct or indirect foreign influence. Nationalization,
therefore, was inevitable.
By the early 1970s the major producers of the Middle East pursued state
monopolies over the exploration and
development of their oil resources,
while only a few were permitted partnerships with international oil companies. The return of the IOCs in Saudi
Arabia has been limited to the E&P of
gas, not oil, in Iran only under service
contract of buyback terms, while in
Iraq invitation to the IOCs, during the
Saddam era in the 90s, took the form
of production-sharing agreements and
buyback contracts.
Iraq was no different from the majority in this respect as it established a

national oil company (INOC) in 1964
and nationalized its oil industry in the
early 1970s. Since nationalization, Iraq
generally has known no mode of operation other than by INOC and-or its
operating oil companies, occasioned by
management service contracts.

Grant of rights: PSA vs. SC

no longer create an economic enclave
isolated from the people and their economic interest.

Local content
The petroleum law views the petroleum resource as the inalienable and
imperceptible property of the state.
In other words, petroleum is a
nonrenewable depleting asset, meriting
conservation, optimum fiscal reward,
as well as, amongst others, providing a
major role for the national oil company
and requiring the adoption of a “local
content.”
The draft petroleum law has not
made the local content, in its wide
context, a mandatory condition. However, the fact that other major producing countries such as Iran and Russia
require 51%, which is on the increase,
and Norway 70%, its adoption by IOCs
should prove to be a rewarding policy.

Production-sharing agreements have
wide and more favorable acceptance by
most international oil companies and
some host countries but have had a bad
press in connection to their applicability in Iraq.
The PSA is generally very detailed,
covering almost every aspect of the
technical, fiscal, company role, and
government regulatory and supervisory
functions. It leaves little room for the
state’s petroleum law to apply. Its term

However, without a central unified
policy there will be disharmony and
competition between INOC—operating
on production and marketing its export
oil to provide the state’s income—and
the regions and governorates—operating on exploration for unnecessary
additional reserves—and among the
various regions and governorates, with
increasing disparity between the haves
and have-nots.
While the draft petroleum law
remains stalled, sound policy suggests
that the Ministry of Oil should adopt its
original draft petroleum law and abide
by its articles, in particular the decisionmaking processes and the checks and
balances therein.
This requires a high level decision
to create the managerial and administrative entities mentioned above, or, if
this is not possible, the Ministry of Oil
should simulate such entities in order
to gain credibility and support from
the country’s oil industry unions and
professionals, thinkers, and national
politicians. The Ministry of Oil aims to
pursue such route but has not achieved
it yet.
For the Ministry of Oil, however,
to carry on acting beyond an interim
stopgap period and to continue with
the grant of rights and vital projects on
long-term execution of plans would be
to commit the same mistake as that of
the KRG, and to justify the KRG’s current policy.
The return by the KRG and other
players to the principles of a united nation governed in peace and stability and
adopting a federal model which enjoys
the advantages of decentralization without the disadvantages of divisive ethnosectarian politics, would expedite the
chances of moving towards a healthy
state where the government is capable
of managing effectively the affairs of the
country and the nation.
Only then would Iraq’s petroleum
law have the chance of a revival, provided that professional amendments
are made and in the light of a positive
constitutional revision.

the resilience of its people over many
centuries remains the real assurance for
the country’s eventual return to normality.
The serious impediments of the
concessionary era ought to be eradicated. Old timers of the oil industry have
learned their lesson from the concessionary period as economic enclaves
isolated instead of being integrated in
the community by way of joint participation and local content in service
model contracts.
The national oil companies of this
era have the bulk of the world’s reserves. They are the majors of the day
whose contribution to their countries
and to the global community is much
enhanced through state-of-the-art of
technology and management. The IOCs
have and can provide both as services
in exchange for cash or crude, which
could well be the better model, under
a culture which no longer should need
IOCs or NOCs to replace either. ✦

Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition
July 14 – 16, 2009
Calgary TELUS Convention Centre, Calgary, Alberta, Canada

Oil for tomorrow
THE PROMISE. THE PRACTICE.

Technologies developed for the oil sands and heavy oil resources of Alberta are vital to more than tomorrow’s oil
supply. They represent solutions to problems encountered throughout the oil industry.
Problems like managing costs, dealing with labor shortages, handling sulfur, controlling air emissions, producing
oil under difﬁcult conditions, mitigating surface impacts, recycling produced water, capturing and sequestering
carbon dioxide, and more.
While it ﬁnds solutions to those problems, the oil sands and heavy oil industry develops an unconventional resource
that indeed represents oil supply crucial to many tomorrows.
Progress in the oil sands and heavy oil producing regions of the world means progress in the entire oil industry...
and in a world that needs oil.
The Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition is the premier forum for the people who make
that progress possible.

Kenya
Origin Energy Kenya Pty. Ltd. will
carry Pancontinental Oil & Gas NL,
Perth, through a 3D seismic survey
over the main prospects on Block L8
off Kenya under changes made to the
L8 and L9 project status.
The L9 license will be relinquished, and as part of the revised
exploration program accepted by the
Kenyan government as a basis for
granting a second additional exploration period on the L8 production
sharing contract, the area of Block L8
will be reduced.
The retained portion will contain
the main prospects, including the
Mbawa feature sized at more than 5
billion bbl of recoverable oil or 7 tcf
of gas, Pancontinental said.
By funding the seismic survey and
all other project costs for the 2 years
starting Jan. 22, 2009, Origin will
earn 75% interest in L8 and Pancontinental will retain 25%.
Mbawa is 80 km off northern Kenya in 800 m of water.

alike. The country’s oil
production has soared since the sector
was opened in 1997 and is still growing.
In 1997, Brazilian fields produced
about 700,000 b/d and state-owned
Petroleo Brasileiro SA was the sole player In 2008, production was more than
2 million b/d, and dozens of operators
were involved.
Recent news is dominated by
deepwater fields (400-1,500 m water
depth), particularly the presalt play. By
1998, deepwater production accounted
for 50% of Brazil’s oil production. Ten
years later, in 2008, deepwater and
ultradeepwater (>1,500 m) production
contributed 80% of the country’s total
oil production.1
A new fleet of floating production, storage, and offloading vessels (FPSOs) is the key

There are justifiable concerns
about bottlenecks in the company’s project pipeline.

Petrobras aggressively pursed international acquisitions in 2008 but may
be holding back to finance domestic
projects in 2009.

Budgets
Industry expected Petrobras’s revised
budget on Dec. 19, but the board of directors’s discussions were inconclusive.
The company said that
changing market conditions required further
evaluation of projects,
and the budget would
be announced in January. Industry speculates
that Petrobras will
spend $112 billion through its revised
5-year strategic plan for 2008-12.

Some companies already are applying new technology at small scale (less
than 5,000 b/d) in Estonia, Brazil, and
China, but little global oil shale production remains at commercial scale; none
is in the US.
Numerous approaches during more
than 100 years have attempted to develop oil shale resources. These approaches
fall into three broad categories: surface,
in situ, or hybrid processes.
Surface processes are the most tested
and most commonly used. These processes entail three major steps:
1. Oil shale mining and ore preparation.
2. Pyrolysis of oil shale in kilns or
retorts to produce kerogen oil.
3. Upgrading kerogen oil to produce refinery feedstocks and high-value
chemicals.
Shale for surface retorting may come
from either surface or underground
mines. The major difficulties for surface processes have involved materials
handling, process energy efficiency, and
spent-shale disposal.
For deeper, thicker deposits, not as
amenable to surface or deep-mining
methods, various technologies can
produce kerogen oil in situ. In situ
processes, by heating the resource in its
natural depositional setting, minimize
or eliminate the need for mining and
surface pyrolysis.
True in situ processes apply heat
to the subsurface oil shale resource
without mining, and modified in situ
processes attempt to improve pyrolysis
and recovery efficiency by fracturing or
rubblizing some or all of the resource
to improve heat transfer and fluid flow
through the shale.
The hybrid process is a recent
concept that combines surface and in
situ approaches. This approach slowly
heats oil shale mined from near-surface
deposits in a sealed impoundment constructed in the void space created by ore
excavation.
Recent advances in oil shale technology are both numerous and groundbreaking. These new variations on
the traditional approaches may offer

process (ICP) in Colorado. Shell’s technique inserts heaters underground to
convert kerogen in oil shale into highquality transportation fuels, generating
more oil and gas from a smaller surface
area than previous oil shale processes.
In the ICP process, electric heaters gradually heat shale located
1,000-2,000 ft subsurface, to 650-750°
F. The heat changes the kerogen in
oil shale into oil and gas. Traditional
recovery methods then pump the oil to
surface.
Shell expects this slow, lower temperature process to generate lower carbon emissions than traditional surface
retorting. The process yields high-quality feedstocks (greater than 30° gravity)
with estimated yields in the thickest
and richest deposits from 100,000 to 1
million boe/acre.
The tests also include freezewall
technology for protecting the heating zone from groundwater intrusion
and for protecting the groundwater
from potential contamination. After
the production area has been cleaned,
the freezewall is terminated allowing
resumption of groundwater flow.

Fig. 1 displays both the ICP technology and the freeze-wall concept.

ExxonMobil’s Electrofrac

ExxonMobil Corp.’s Electrofrac
process for in situ oil shale conversion
involves hydraulically fracturing the
shale and filling the fractures with an
electrically conductive material, forming a heating element.
Exxon expects the use of vertical
fractures created from horizontal wells
will produce a conductive zone that
when heated to pyrolysis temperature
will produce liquids and gases that
conventional recovery technologies can
produce (Fig. 2).

Petro Probe’s superheated air1
Petro Probe Inc. has licensed an in
situ process that can gasify and recover
products from oil shale deposits deeper
than 3,000 ft. The process begins by
drilling into the oil shale and locating
a processing inlet conduit within the
hole. An effluent conduit is anchored
around the opening at surface.
The process then introduces pressurized air to an aboveground combustor,
superheating the air and directing it

underground into the oil shale through
the inlet conduit to heat the rock and
convert the kerogen to a gaseous state.
Radiant heat in the inlet conduit
produces a nonburning thermal energy
front of predictable radius in the oil
shale surrounding the hole. High temperatures and correct pressures cause
the porous marlstone to gasify. Four
products result: hydrogen, 45° gravity
condensate; 1,000-btu methane gas,
and water.
This is a self-sustaining system with
gas being condensed and recycled. In
addition, the process includes compressing produced CO2 and pumping it
back into the oil shale formation where
it remains.
The process has a minimal surface
footprint. Each complete plant will
cover about 1 acre of land and will deplete the oil shale body in 10-20 years.
Subsurface, the formation retains 94%
to 99% of its original structural integrity once the kerogen has been gasified.

Schlumberger’s RF technology1
Raytheon Co. and CF Technology
Inc. developed an extraction methodology involving radio frequency (RF)
and critical fluids. In 2007, the companies sold the integrated technology
to Schlumberger Ltd., which plans to
commercialize the technology and
facilitate its application in heavy oil and
oil shale projects.
This in situ technology uses radio
frequencies to heat the shale to pyrolysis temperatures and supercritical CO2
to sweep the produced liquids and gases
to production wells.
This extraction method uses standard
oil industry equipment to drill the wells
into the shale strata. Then RF antennas
lowered to the shale zone transmit RF
energy to heat the shale. Supercritical
CO2 pumped into the oil shale extracts
the kerogen oil and carries it to an
extraction well.
Surface facilities separate out the CO2
and pump it back into injection wells.
When refined, the oil and gas become
gasoline, heating oil, and other products. Ultimately, the company expects

effects.2
The current process operations generate 3,870 b/d of shale oil, 120 tonnes
of fuel gas, 45 tonnes of LPG, and 75
tonnes of sulfur from 7,800 tons of
shale.1

Fushun retorts
China has expanded shale oil
production by increasing the number
of small vertical retorts operating at

its processing facilities. In 2005, the
Fushun facility employed more than
120 retort units, each having a daily
throughput capacity of 100 tonnes of
oil shale. Grouping the low capacity retorts allows 20 retorts to share a single
condenser system.
Like the Petrosix retort, the design
allows the use of pyrolized residual carbon to obtain high thermal efficiency.
The Fushun design, however, allows
introduction of nitrogen in the py-

rolysis gas resulting in a produced gas
with low calorific value. Introduction
of oxygen in the upper chamber makes
the pyrolysis less efficient, resulting in
oil yields of only about 65% of Fisher
assay.2
Expansion of production requires
construction of additional batteries of
Fushun retorts or adoption of other
oil shale technologies. China currently
has under evaluation the Petrosix and
Alberta Taciuk processes.

duction capacities (1,000 tonnes/day of
oil shale) and have oil yields of 75-80%
of Fisher assay. The Viru Keemia Group
(VKG) has operated two 1,000 tonne/
day (tpd) retorts with good results for
producing fuels and chemicals.1
The newer Galoter retort design is
a horizontal fluidized bed retort with
a throughput capacity of about 3,000
tpd (roughly half the capacity of the
Petrosix 11-m retort and three times
the capacity of the Kiviter). Using shale
ash as a solid heat carrier, the process
is more thermally efficient, reducing
energy inputs, and achieves a higher
yield of about 85-90% of Fisher assay.
The design also delivers higher quality
produced gases.
Although the process is more complex than the Kiviter, plant availability
has steadily improved, recently reaching
6,200 hr/year of operating up time.
These designs currently are in use in
Estonia and EESTI Energia may consider
them for use in Jordan.

Alberta Taciuk process
The Alberta Taciuk process (ATP)
involves a horizontal rotating kiln with
high thermal efficiency and high production efficiency. It can obtain shale oil
production of 90% or greater of Fisher
assay.
The process, originally developed
in 1976 for treating Alberta oil sands,
was later refined for use in oil shale and
contaminated waste treatment. A scaledup commercial version of the process
operated in the Stuart deposit in Queensland Australia and produced more than
1.5 million bbl shale oil.
The process combines gas recirculation and direct and indirect heat transfer
from circulated hot solids in a rotating
kiln. It is largely energy self-sufficient
because some of the hot processed shale
recirculates in the retort with fresh
shale to provide pyrolysis heat by direct,
solid-to-solid heat transfer.
ATP has been reported to increase
kerogen oil and gas yields, improve
thermal efficiency, reduce process water
needs, and minimize residual coke on

spent shale, enabling environmentally
safe disposal (Fig. 8). ✦

Most of the Caspian
region’s new oil production will be transported
to international markets
via pipelines in AzerbaiPipelines
jan and Georgia, reducing Russia’s share of the
regional oil transport market.
Caspian region oil production will
increase from 80.4 million tons in
2005 to between 135 and
205.3 million
tons in 2015.
Increases in
output from
Tengiz field in

this rise in production.
Limited expansion potential on the
Russian-operated Caspian Pipeline
Consortium (CPC) line and a desire by
the region’s shippers to avoid additional
use of Russian lines, will lead most of
this new production to be carried by
the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline
instead.
Azerbaijan and Georgia’s share of
the transportation market for Caspian
oil will increase to 55% in 2015 from
22% in 2005, while the transportation
market share of systems in Russia will
decline to as little as 34% in 2015 from
66% in 2005 (Table 1).

Background
Russian Transneft aspires to maximize oil flows through its territory and
take full control of the region’s transport systems. The Caspian nations do
not support these aspirations.
Russian capacity is fully used. Russia’s major oil pipeline in the Caspian region also ends at the Black Sea,
requiring ships to transit the heavily
trafficked Bosporus and Dardanelles
straights. Despite these limitations Russia strongly opposed development of
the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline and
continues to oppose its expansion.
Two key factors will determine the
competitiveness of any Caspian region
oil transportation corridor:
• The ability to transport oil from
Kazakhstan.
• The ability to effectively reduce
dependence on Russia.
The World Bank predicts increases
in oil transportation capacity through
Azerbaijan and Georgia to parallel
growth in Caspian oil exports between
2005 and 2015, establishing secure
transportation corridors outside of Russia.
This article will examine factors
guiding the path oil follows out of the
region and detail Caspian transportation infrastructure, including pipelines,
ships, seaports, and terminals.

Change drivers

Existing oil transportation systems in
the Caspian region do not have sufficient capacity to satisfy future demand
for Caspian oil. Exports of Caspian oil
will increase to

other resources already in-place or

Oil companies in Kazakhstan and
Azerbaijan are already developing such
alternatives. KazMunaiGaz has invested
$200 million to purchase Georgia’s Batumi oil terminal, while Azerbaijan has
built a new Black Sea port in Georgia
at Kulevi. Besides moving additional
future volumes, these facilities will help
if geopolitical problems prevent movement of oil through Iran or Turkey.
Georgia’s Black Sea ports Batumi,
Kulevi, and Supsa also have sufficient
transshipment capacity to handle increased oil flows. Kulevi’s original 4-5
million ton/year capacity increased to
10 million tons/year in 2008. Plans
exist for further expansion of Kulevi to
20 million tons/year and Batumi to 25

Caspian’s western shore:
• Baku–Novorossiysk.

58

• Baku-Supsa.
• BTC.
The Baku–Novorossiysk pipeline
carries 6 million tons/year 1,400 km
and could be expanded to around 15
million tons/year by adding pumping
stations at a cost of about $300 million.
The pipeline’s tariffs are competitive,
but its small capacity will limit its viability as an export route.
The Baku-Supsa pipeline, known as
the Western route, entered service in
1998 using refurbished sections of a
partially constructed product pipeline
in Azerbaijan and connecting it to an
unused crude oil pipeline running
from northwest of Tbilisi to Batumi.
A subsequent branch of the pipeline
connected it to the port of Supsa, where
an offshore loading facility was constructed. The 530-mm OD pipeline has
a capacity of 7 million tons/year. Additional pumping stations can increase its
capacity to about 10 million tons/year
at an estimated cost of $100 million.
The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline
crosses Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey.
The pipeline starts near Baku at the
Sangachal terminal, which receives oil
from Azeri, Chirag, and Gunashli (ACG)
offshore oilfields in the Caspian Sea.

The pipeline ends at a marine terminal
on the Mediterranean Sea in the Turkish
port of Ceyhan, where crude tankers are
loaded. BTC construction sought to create a route not under Russian control.
BTC cost an estimated $3.7 billion.
BP holds a 30% stake in the BTC Co.
consortium running the pipeline. Other
consortium members include Azerbaijan’s state oil company SOCAR (25%),
Amerada Hess (2.36%), ConocoPhillips (2.5%), Eni (5%), Inpex (2.5%),
Itochu (3.4%), Statoil (8.71%), TotalFinaElf (5%), TPAO (6.53%), and Unocal
(8.9%).
BTC can move 1 million b/d (50
million tons/year) across 1,780 km.
Additional pump stations could increase
capacity to 60-65 million tons/year. The
pipeline’s OD through Azerbaijan measures 1,070 mm, increasing to 1,170
mm as it rises from the plains into the
Caucasus Mountains and Georgia. The
pipeline reverts to 1,070 mm for the
portion across Turkish Anatolia and
shrinks to 865 mm as it nears Ceyhan.

in central Kazakhstan and the Chinese
market. The pipeline links Kazakhstan’s
South Turgay basin and the Russian
pipeline system to refineries in western
China. Deliveries to Dushanzi refinery
began in July 2006. Initial capacity
(and throughput) of the line measures
10 million tons/year, with oil coming
from both Kazakhstan and Russia.
Beyond transporting oil from Kumkol fields in South Turgay (now majority
owned by China National Petroleum
Corp.), the pipeline transports Kazakh

of more than 20 years. Many of the vessels are in poor condition. CASPAR has
contracted Meridian Shipping, owned
by Middle East Petroleum (MEP), to
operate the fleet. CASPAR until recently
handled around 90% of all cross-Caspian oil shipments, resulting in such
comparatively high freight rates as:
Aqtau–Makhachkala, $7-9/ton; Aqtau–
Baku, $7-8/ton; and Aqtau–Neka,
$12-12.5/ton.
The arrival of three Russian-affiliated
shipping companies serving non-Azeri
ports has increased competition in the
Caspian market.

TV show targets
wrong element of
’08 oil price leap
An “investigation” by a popular US television news show has uncovered information about oil prices that anyone familiar
with the market knew months ago.
Teasers by CBS News for the Jan. 11 edition of “60 Minutes” promised to surprise
viewers with disclosure that last year’s high
oil prices were not, after all, the handiwork
of ExxonMobil Corp. or Saudi Arabia.
Instead, “60 Minutes” concluded, the

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

fault lies with oil speculators.
The show dredged up the usual evidence:
the high share of futures positions held by
speculative traders; the large multiple of paper barrels traded on futures exchanges over
barrels of oil actually delivered; the inability
of market fundamentals to explain a huge,
single day’s leap in the crude price.
Was manipulation involved? The program didn’t exactly say.
It did suspiciously note that Goldman
Sachs predicted the crude price would
reach $200/bbl, as though a forecast
destined to be proven wrong had been an
attempt to excite trading and elevate prices.
The program pointed to Enron’s support
for free oil markets, suggesting that the
discredited trading juggernaut wanted to
manipulate oil prices the way it gamed
electricity.
And it interlaced its observations with
regret for the absence of “oversight” and
implications of blame for “deregulation.”
None of this required an investigation.
An unusual rush of speculative money into
futures markets for oil and other commodities is a matter of record. Investors
were seeking shelter as the ﬁnancial crisis
developed and other assets lost value. The
activity was thoroughly reported.
In the opinion of many observers, the
surge did help push oil prices to levels
market fundamentals could neither explain
nor sustain.
Perhaps amplifying the effect of the
capital inﬂux was unusual weakness of the
dollar. “60 Minutes” didn’t mention currency effects.
The program seemed more intent on
regretting deregulation than on fully explaining price pressures that were well recognized
while in play and largely deemed ephemeral.
The problem last year wasn’t deregulation, which happened long ago. The solution isn’t more regulation.
To use a “60 Minutes” analogy, Enron’s
electricity mischief occurred along an arbitrage frontier created by overregulation in
California.

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

‘Vicious’ loop in oil market
Escalating oil inventories have ﬁlled most storage at the Cushing, Okla., primary
delivery point, undermining US crude prices to the point West Texas Intermediate is
“about as useful as a chocolate oven-glove” in assessing world market conditions,
said Paul Horsnell at Barclays Capital Inc., London.
With crude production outstripping demand, Cushing inventories were estimated
in mid-January at 33 million bbl with a capacity of 47 million bbl. As a result, the oil
futures market on the New York Mercantile Exchange “got stuck in a fairly vicious
loop,” Horsnell said, with traders competing to unload contracts rather than compete
for storage.
In Paris, the International Energy Agency noted, “Crude prices rose to nearly $50/
bbl in early January, supported by cold weather, the Russian-Ukrainian gas crisis,
and ﬁghting in Gaza. Subsequently, weak global reﬁnery demand and an increasing
crude overhang have pressured Brent futures to…$45/bbl, while WTI was at $35/bbl,
distorted by record-high Cushing stocks.”
The big story at mid-January was the price disparity between WTI and North Sea
Brent. “While WTI is reﬂective of the price of oil in Cushing, Brent crude is more
reﬂective of the international price of oil since it is used to price two thirds of the
world’s internationally traded oil,” said analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond
James & Associates Inc.
Historically, the two crudes of similar composition have traded around the same
pricing levels, with WTI usually priced a little higher. Front-month WTI closed at
$36.51/bbl Jan. 16 compared with Brent at $46.57/bbl. “With inventories at record
highs, oil tankers sitting idle at sea hoarding oil, and total US petroleum demand
down 7% compared with last year, the price disparity between WTI and Brent could
linger for months,” Raymond James analysts said.
Horsnell pointed out, “The problem is that WTI prices are being used in a wider
context: crude oil exporters link to them for the US market, derivatives are based
on them, investment returns are affected by their time spreads, and policymakers in
both consuming and producing countries use them as an indicator.”
Although crude storage is at a record high in Cushing, that’s “not true for the US
as a whole,” Horsnell said. He noted US crude inventories increased 18.4 million bbl
over the past 3 months, including 18.1 million bbl at Cushing. “In other words, for
the whole of the US outside of Cushing, crude inventories have risen by just 300,000
bbl over the past 3 months, (from 293.3 million bbl to 293.6 million bbl), and they
currently stand almost 40 million bbl lower than as recently as mid-2007,” he said.
Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland, said, “WTI is the most traded
crude oil contract, but it would be wrong to extrapolate a Cushing supply and demand as the world’s supply and demand.”
Distillate fuels stocks
The US Energy Information Administration reported distillate fuels escalated 6.4
million bbl to 144.2 million bbl in the week ended Jan. 9, exceeding Wall Street’s
expectations of a 1 million bbl increase. Some analysts immediately questioned EIA’s
numbers, which included a 4.1 million bbl increase of low-sulfur diesel in Petroleum
Administration Defense District (PADD) 2 in the Midwest, encompassing Cushing.
That would be the largest-ever weekly change in distillate stock in that district, Jakob
said.
Moreover, it “implies a 53% drop” in PADD 2 demand within 1 week—“a drop
that we think is materially impossible,” Jakob said. The large distillate spike likely
includes undisclosed revisions to previous data, so EIA may have under-reported
demand by 700,000 b/d, he said.
Meanwhile, Raymond James analysts surmised, “It looks as if 2008 global oil
demand was negative on a year-over-year basis for the ﬁrst time in over 20 years,
which makes one wonder, ‘How bad will 2009 get?’”
Paris-based IEA reduced its oil demand forecast by 1 million b/d to 85.3 million
b/d for 2009, down 0.6% from 2008 levels. Its 2008 forecast was reduced by 70,000
b/d to 85.8 million b/d, down 0.3% from 2007 levels. That would be the ﬁrst 2-year
total contraction in global oil demand since 1982-83.
In Washington, EIA cut its 2009 oil price forecast another 15% to $43.25/bbl. But
like most soothsayers, EIA has a poor record for accurate price predictions. Last July
when the US driving season was at its peak and oil prices were soaring, it forecast
the US spot price for WTI would average $127/bbl for 2008 and $133/bbl in 2009, up
from an average $72/bbl for 2007.

Baker Hughes delivers Best-in-Class results

Continuous Viscosity Profile Aids
Production Facilities Design
Location: Campos Basin, Brazil
Client: Petrobras
Objectives:
Characterize the reservoir to plan the field development
Characterize the reservoir fluid to help design lifting
and production facilities

Challenges:
Reservoir oil composition is expected to vary. 14 - 15°
API oil is common, but 25° API also is found in offset wells.
MREX
2.5 cP
PVT
2.5 cP

Solution:
The Baker Atlas MR ExplorerSM (MREXSM) service identified
reservoir intervals with different oil properties.
Baker Atlas’ Reservoir Characterization Instrument®
(RCI®) service collected six single-phase fluid samples
in the identified intervals.

Results:
Single-phase samples provided high-resolution
PVT characterization of the reservoir fluid. Average
contamination is less than 0.4%.

MREX
2.4 cP
PVT
2.9 cP

The MREX analysis characterized in-situ oil viscosity as a
continuous curve, matching measured viscosity within 5%.
The PVT properties and in-situ viscosity profile helped client
optimize production facilities.

MREX
6.7 cP
PVT
6.8 cP

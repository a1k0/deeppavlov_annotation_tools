US, Canadian unconventional gas to aid demand
The trends of declining natural gas well productivity and reserves-to-well ratios are expected to continue through 2015 across
all 50 gas basins in the US and Canada, Cambridge Energy Research
Associates and IHS reported.
Continued strong market prices will be necessary to motivate
enough drilling simply to maintain production on a flat trajectory,
said the study, now in its second phase.
In recent years gas production has been buoyed by a shift toward more emphasis on drilling unconventional gas resources
such as coalbed methane, gas shale, and tight sandstone.
Study coauthor Robert Ineson, CERA director of North American gas research, said the unconventional gas production stems
from “the clear inability of conventional gas resources to keep pace
with gas consumption.”
Unconventional gas provides solid supply options for several
more years, he said. Producers must develop unconventional plays
in a cost-effective manner so that gas can compete economically
with imported LNG, coal, and other technologies.
“With unconventional resources dominating production trends
in the next decade, the performance of existing and emerging unconventional plays will define the long-run supply curve for indigenous North American natural gas supply,” Ineson said.
Analysts used a gas price of $4-10/Mcf looking out to 2015 to
examine the interplay of future gas production costs, the geological potential in the US and Canada, and how gas supply could build
at higher market prices.
The most significant driver of rising gas production costs has
been and will continue to be declining production on a per-well
basis, not costs for equipment, although equipment costs could
push a region to an unprofitable position, the study said.
Of the 15 basins having the largest forecast capacity increases
from 2005 to 2010, 12 are primarily unconventional resources,
the study said.

company has invested $1 billion in renewable energy over the past
5 years. Higher oil prices are needed to underpin the long-term
commerciality of biofuels and experience in developing biofuels
plants will also be a critical factor, he said.
Routs called for subsidies or special tax treatments to encourage
the construction of biofuels plants, stressing that these were necessary until plants could be developed on a large scale. “We need a
few cents/liter [subsidy] to make it work,” Routs told OGJ.
Routs has deliberately steered the company away from producing ethanol from sugar cane because he foresaw the difficulty of
using food crops for fuels. “I don’t think the sugar cane situation
in Brazil and the US is sustainable,” he said. “If it’s picked up for
fuel production, there will be a clash and I don’t want to get involved in fuel and food competition. Sourcing is a big issue and I
don’t see us going into owning land collecting waste products to
get into this.”
Shell has joined German company Choren to launch a new
biofuels plant that will convert biomass, such as woodchips, into
synthetic fuel, which will then be marketed by Choren as SunFuel.
The fuel is being used in diesel engines and can reduce emissions.
The 15,000 tonne/year plant is due to become operational in late
2007 or early 2008.
Using waste plant material instead of valuable food crops would
help the biofuels industry to circumvent the growing political
pressure over using crops for fuel.
Routs told OGJ that Shell is working on various cellulose ethanol initiatives. The US government has promised Canadian company Iogen Corp., which Shell has teamed with, an $80 million grant
to build an 18 million gal/year plant in Idaho that will produce
cellulosic ethanol from plant waste and straw.
Last year, Shell signed a letter of intent with Volkswagen and Iogen to assess the economic feasibility of producing cellulose ethanol in Germany.
Last year Shell sold more than 3.5 billion l. of biofuels, Routs
said.

Shell to boost biofuels R&D investments
Royal Dutch Shell PLC plans to increase its investment in biofuels
research and development to improve energy security and help to
lower carbon emissions, a senior executive from the company said
June 25 at a press briefing in London.
Rob Routs, Shell executive director, downstream, said the company’s focus would be on biofuels—in particular converting waste
oils and fats into fuels. This hydrogenated process, Routs said, “is
expensive at the moment, but there is some commercial application of it.”
Routs declined to say how much the company plans to spend
on biofuels R&D, citing company confidentiality. But he did say the

South Korea conﬁrms gas hydrates deposits
South Korea has confirmed deposits of gas hydrates off the eastern coast of the country, about 135 km northeast of the city of
Pohang.
The Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Energy’s oil and gas
development division issued a statement June 23 saying the area is
within South Korea’s exclusive economic zone.
A drilling program, scheduled to begin in September, calls for
at least five wells. South Korea hopes to develop the technology for
using gas hydrates by 2015, the government said.
South Korea now imports its oil and natural gas. ✦

Noble makes discovery off Equatorial Guinea
Noble Energy Inc. has made a gas and condensate discovery on
Block I in the Douala basin off Equatorial Guinea.
The discovery well, I-1, was to test the Benita prospect. The well
is 25 miles east of Bioko Island and 13 miles south of the 2005
Belinda discovery on Block O.
I-1, drilled in 2,880 ft of water to 10,460 ft TD, encountered
an “extremely” high-quality Miocene reservoir with 135 ft of net
hydrocarbon pay, Noble said. The reservoir section at the Benita
discovery is much thicker than at Belinda, also of Miocene age.
On test the well flowed 1,038 b/d of condensate and 34.3
MMcfd of gas. Production rates were limited by test facilities.
Condensate yields can be increased with the installation of cooling and processing facilities, Noble said.
Additional appraisal work will be necessary to verify the areal
extent of the Benita discovery. Any appraisal work will follow the
drilling of an additional exploration well in Block I, Noble said.
The company is currently carrying out a multiwell exploration
and appraisal program designed to test a number of prospects in
the region.
The Songa Saturn drillship will now move back to Block O to
drill later this month a Belinda appraisal well 4.5 miles from the O1 discovery well. Current plans are to return to Block I in the third
quarter to drill the second exploration well.
Noble Energy is the technical operator of Block I with a 40%
participating interest.

Oil, gas found in Pakistan’s Sindh province
Orient Petroleum Inc. made an oil and natural gas discovery
with its Rahim-1 well drilled on Khipro block in Sindh province,
Pakistan.
The well, which was spudded Mar. 12, was drilled to 3,200 m.
On test the well flowed 800 b/d of oil and 350 Mcfd of gas at 730
psi wellhead flowing pressure through a 32⁄64-in. choke.
Separately, Oil & Gas Development Co. Ltd. made a gas-condensate discovery on the Thora and Thora East mining lease with the
Thora Deep-1 well in Sindh province. The well, which was spudded
Nov. 21, 2006, was drilled to 3,906 m. On test, the well flowed
100 b/d of condensate and 9.9 MMcfd of gas at wellhead flowing
pressure of 1,880 psi through a 32⁄64-in. choke.
In addition, OMV Pakistan also made a gas discovery on Gambat
Block with the Tajjal-1 well in Sindh province. The well, which was
spudded Mar. 16, was drilled to the 3,780 m. The well flowed 20
MMcfd of gas on test.

first exploration and appraisal well, Hassi Tidjerane 2 (HTJ-2), in
March. Statoil holds a 75% interest in Hassi Mouina, and Sonatrach
has 25%.
Bill Maloney, senior vice-president for global exploration, said
results from both wells were valuable, and that the company would
continue with its exploration program to map the resource potential in the block.
“The next location for the [land] rig is Tinerkouk (TNK-1) south
in the license, where a third well will be drilled,” Statoil said.
The Hassi Mouina license has four blocks within a 23,000-sqkm area in the Gourara basin.
The area lies in the Western Sahara, northwest of the In Salah gas
field in which Statoil has a 31.85% interest.
Statoil has a 75% interest in Hassi Mouina, and Sonatrach has
25%.

Apache tests Exmouth basin well off W. Australia
Houston independent Apache Corp. has completed a successful
test of Theo 3-H, the first horizontal well at the Van Gogh development in the Exmouth basin 1,175 km off Western Australia.
Theo 3-H was drilled in 1,205 ft of water to a MD of 10,598
ft. It cut a 4,554-ft horizontal section in the Cretaceous Top Barrow
formation.
The well flowed 9,694 b/d of oil on test. Its flow rate was restricted by downhole and surface equipment limitations, Apache
said.
The company plans to drill 18 additional long-reach horizontal
laterals at Van Gogh later this year, with a target of first production
by the end of first quarter 2009. At that time, the field is expected
to add 20,000 b/d of oil to the company’s net production.
The $500 million Van Gogh development will use a floating
production, storage, and offloading vessel with a processing capacity of 63,000 b/d and storage capacity of 620,000 bbl. Apache
operates the development and owns 52.5% interest in the project,
while Tokyo-based Inpex Corp. owns 47.5%.
The Pyrenees development, in which Apache holds 28.57% interest, is expected to add 20,000 b/d of oil to the company’s net
production as well during 2009. It is anticipated that this field,
operated by BHP Billiton Ltd. (71.43%), will receive the formal
go-ahead by the end of this month.
Apache currently is drilling the Julimar East-1 appraisal well 3.6
miles northeast of the Julimar-1 gas discovery, which flowed at a
combined rate of 85 MMcfd on tests of two Triassic channel sands.
Julimar East-1 will appraise the channels tested in the discovery
well and will target additional deeper Triassic sands.

Statoil proves gas in Algeria’s HTJW-1 well
Statoil AS has tested natural gas in Devonian sandstones with
its Hassi Tidjerane West (HTJW-1) well in Algeria, the company
reported. Statoil is operator of the project.
The well, drilled on the Hassi Mouina license in Algeria’s Sahara
Desert, is the second exploration well completed and tested there,
fulfilling Statoil’s license obligations. Statoil did not give the TD of
the well or the test production flows.

Remote Alabama well taps Devonian gas
The Alabama Oil & Gas Board has reported a completion test
earlier this year of a modest Devonian gas well off the southern
flank of the Black Warrior basin.
EOG Resources Inc., Houston, filed a test rate of 120 Mcfd of
gas with 120 psi flowing tubing pressure on a 24⁄64-in. choke with
118 b/d of water from Devonian perforations at 8,150-8,763 ft.
Test date is Mar. 4.

Ivanhoe completes Athabasca bitumen test

Heavy oil production starts at Chetopa ﬁeld

Ivanhoe Energy Inc. completed an Athabasca bitumen test run
at its commercial demonstration plant in Bakersfield, Calif., using
HTL, the company’s proprietary heavy oil upgrading technology.
The test run was carried out as outlined in a 2000 technology
agreement with ConocoPhillips Canada, which provided Ivanhoe
with the Athabasca bitumen.
ConocoPhillips Canada has certain nonexclusive capacity rights
to use the HTL technology in Canada. The test run was witnessed
by a third-party engineer in preparation for Ivanhoe’s key investment banking arrangements.
Ivanhoe will use information derived from the test for the design and development of full-scale commercial projects in Western
Canada (OGJ, Mar. 27, 2006, Newsletter).
The continuous multiday bitumen trial run was successfully
concluded when the feed tank was emptied. The trial demonstrated
Athabasca bitumen processing in various HTL modes, including
“high yield” and “high quality.”

MegaWest Energy Corp., Calgary, has begun oil production at
its demonstration project in Chetopa field, a nonconventional oil
development covering 392 acres in Labette County in southeastern
Kansas.
The company expects to recover 150,000 bbl of heavy oil from
the 15-acre project using thermal recovery. Production currently
averages 30-50 b/d from four producing wells. Over the next 3-4
months, this rate is expected to ramp up to 250-300 b/d.
The producing sandstones are analogous to the Bluejacket and
Warner sandstones in Missouri, MegaWest said.
The project includes 10 injector sites with twin injectors—one
installed above the shale and the other below it, said MegaWest
Pres. and Chief Executive Officer George Stapleton.
Of the 20 injector wells in a 101⁄2-acre pattern, the company
said 19 are operational. Average depth is 125 ft.
There are 30 production wells in the thermal recovery project.
The 26 producers not yet on line are expected to come on stream
“as the steam injection operations progress,” said David Sealock,
vice-president, corporate services.
MegaWest plans to build a natural gas fuel pipeline by October
to facilitate a switch to natural gas from motor oil in the steam generator and therefore reduce the project’s fuel cost, which amounts
to about 66% of total project expenses.
The company has allocated $345,000 of its 2007 budget to
the Chetopa development, which is expected to ultimately recover
900,000-1 million bbl of oil, Stapleton said.
The company also has plans to start pilot projects in its other
holdings in Kentucky, Texas, and Missouri, he said.
MegaWest has a 100% interest in Chetopa field.

Minke gas ﬁeld in North Sea begins production
Gaz de France Britain, operator of Minke field in the southern
UK North Sea, has begun gas production from a single well subsea
development in the field. Minke will produce 60 MMcfd of gas,
which will be transported via a 15-km pipeline to the Dutch D15
platform for delivery to Uithuizen in the Netherlands. The well
produced as much as 75 MMcfd of gas on test.
GDF Britain, describing Minke’s development as a technically
and commercially challenging project, said the gas is being delivered from a field that is far from existing infrastructure. It is on
Block 44/24a, about 180 km off Norfolk and is adjacent to the
UK-Dutch median line in 45 m of water.
Faroe Petroleum (UK) Ltd., a partner in the field, has agreed to
buy its equity share of gas under a traditional oil-indexed contract
under a gas sales agreement with Gaz de France.
“Minke Main is one of three undeveloped gas field discoveries
we acquired in mid-2006 from ConocoPhillips as a package of license interests,” Faroe Petroleum said. “The other two undeveloped
discoveries in the package are the adjacent Minke Graben, which
may be drained through Minke Main, and the Orca gas fields, with
two tested discovery wells.”
Development decisions on Minke Graben and Orca are anticipated in late 2007 or early 2008.
Ownership interests in Minke field are GDF Britain 15.6%, E.On
Ruhrgas UK 42.67%, RWE Dea UK 35.84%, and Faroe Petroleum
5.89%.

SembCorp Marine units win two jack up contracts
SembCorp Marine Ltd. subsidiary PPL Shipyard has received a
$190 million contract to build a jack up drilling rig for Offshore
Group Corp., the third rig ordered by the company.
Construction of the rig is expected to start in the third quarter,
with delivery scheduled for September 2009, SembCorp said.
In May, SembCorp Marine said its subsidiary Jurong Shipyard,
won a $442 million contract to build a drilling and production
jack up for Petroprod Ltd., with delivery expected in mid-2010.
SembCorp Marine said the harsh-environment jack up will be
built based on the CJ70 design with suitability for operations in the
Norwegian sector of the North Sea. ✦

Processing
S-Oil to boost Onsan reﬁnery’s paraxylene output
S-Oil Corp. has started a project aimed at increasing paraxylene
production at its 520,000 b/cd Onsan refinery and chemical complex in South Korea.
The company has selected ExxonMobil Chemical Technology
Licensing LLC’s selective PxMax technology, which will allow for
an 8% capacity increase without requiring modification of the paraxylene separation process facilities.
The PxMax method produces a paraxylene-enriched mixture
that is further processed into sales grade paraxylene. It replaces
a nonselective toluene disproportionation process that produced
equilibrium mixed xylenes.

BP, DuPont, and ABF propose UK biofuels plants
BP PLC, DuPont, and Associated British Foods have proposed the
construction of a 420 million l./year bioethanol plant at Saltend,
Hull, UK. The plant is being proposed to help ensure that the UK
has 5% of its transportation fuel come from biofuels by 2010. The
plant is due to start operations in late 2009 and will use wheat as
feedstock.
The partners also plan to develop a 20,000 l./year biobutanol
demonstration plant at the same site by early 2009. Investments in
the two initiatives are expected to hit $400 million amid growing
political pressure to find alternative energy sources for transportation fuels.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
“Although initial production would be bioethanol, the partners
will look at the feasibility of converting it to biobutanol once the
required technology is available,” BP said.
The partners are talking to grain trading business Frontier Agriculture about securing locally grown wheat as well as with coproduct marketing company AB Agri in relation to DDGS—a byproduct
of bioethanol production. It is expected that formal agreements
would be finalized after regulatory approvals are obtained.
Aker Kvaerner and its joint venture partner Praj Industries have
won the front-end engineering and design work for the bioethanol plant, with Praj bringing technology and process expertise. The
contract follows the companies’ recent formation of the BioCnergy
Joint Venture, announced June 12.
John Ranieri, head of DuPont Biofuels, said demand was growing significantly for biofuels and it has accelerated the commercial
development of biobutanol over the past year.
BP and ABF subsidiary British Sugar would each hold 45% of
the plant, with DuPont owning the remaining 10%.
Initial development of biobutanol will start with BP and DuPont
sourcing small quantities of biobutanol from China by yearend to
test on infrastructure and vehicles.
BP and DuPont launched a partnership last June to develop, produce, and market a next generation of biofuels. ✦

Expansions planned for China’s Zhoushan oil port
China’s National Development and Reform Commission has approved an oil port and storage expansion project at Zhoushan port,
Ningbo, in eastern China’s Zhejiang province.
NDRC said Zhejiang Jianqiao Energy Development Co. Ltd. will
invest 325 million yuan to build the facility, which will include a
50,000-tonne-capacity berth for oil products, a 5,000-tonne-capacity berth, and storage for 290,000 cu m.
The port currently has a throughput capacity of 4 million
tonnes/year, NDRC said. However, in May the New China News
Agency reported that Zhoushan port handled 2.02 million tonnes
of imported crude, up 48.6% from last year. The imports were primarily from the Middle East, the news agency said.

Enbridge again to expand North Dakota pipeline
Enbridge Energy Partners LP, Houston, will conduct a binding
open season through Aug. 3 for capacity on the Phase 6 expansion
of its North Dakota pipeline system.
The proposed $130 million expansion project, if fully subscribed, would increase system capacity to 155,000 b/d from
110,000 b/d, to be available by yearend.
The system transports oil from western North Dakota and eastern
Montana to Clearbrook, Minn., via the Minnesota Pipeline and the
Lakehead system. From there shippers can access most major refinery
markets along the Great Lakes and in the Midwest and along the US
Gulf Coast through current and planned interconnecting pipelines.
10

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Demand has been exceeding eastbound pipeline capacity and there
is increased oil production, especially in Richland County, Mont., and
western North Dakota oil fields (OGJ, Dec. 11, 2006, p. 42).

Millennium gas pipeline project under way
Millennium Pipeline Co. LLC has begun construction of its 182mile, 30-in. natural gas pipeline across the Southern Tier and lower
Hudson Valley areas of New York.
Construction will continue during the next 2 years, with some
restoration work extending into 2009. The pipeline is scheduled to
begin service Nov. 1, 2008. It will serve markets along its route and
will provide essential service to the New York City markets through
its pipeline interconnections.
The project initially was expected to be commissioned late this
year, but the in-service date was pushed back due to project delays
(OGJ Online, July 17, 2006).
Phase 1 of the project will transport 500 MMcfd of gas from
the Dawn, Ont., trading hub and several supply and storage basins.
It includes the upgrade of a 186-mile Corning-Ramapo, NY, pipeline section on Millennium, which will replace an existing line of
Columbia Gas Transmission Corp., and an 83-mile extension of the
24-in. Empire system from a point near Rochester to Corning, NY.
Empire connects to the TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. system at Chippawa on the US-Canada border.
The Millennium Pipeline is jointly owned by affiliates of NiSource Inc., KeySpan Corp., and DTE Energy. ✦

Darfur item challenged
I find Eric Watkins’ nearly frivolous
appraisal of the deadly serious situation
in the Darfur region of Sudan both incredible and reprehensive (OGJ, May 21,
2007, p. 31). While I am sure that both
Beijing and Khartoum greatly appreciate
his terminology (“alleged genocide”),
those unfortunate individuals who have
been brutally treated by the death squads
would not.
I hope that Mr. Watkins takes a more
sensitive and balanced approach in the
future to similar humanitarian disasters—no matter how bad it makes our
industry or foreign governments look.

Sending messages
I read in Oil & Gas Journal a quote
from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid
(D-Nev.): “The mere fact we’re moving legislation on the floor should send
a message to oil cartels” (OGJ, June 4,
2007, p. 28).
Oh, it sends a message all right. All of
the provisions passed by the US House
and Senate will do nothing to increase
supplies of crude oil and refined products to American consumers. As a matter
of fact, these legislative attempts to
“punish” petroleum producers further
restrict supplies, cause more volatility
in the market, and probably will raise
prices to consumers.
The nation’s energy debate is not
about increasing supplies but about
punishing an industry that has provided
a safe, reliable, and affordable product to
consumers worldwide. The “message,” as
Sen. Reid put it, and intent are to put the
American oil industry out of business.
Now is the time to write your congressman and senators to express your
opinions about the actions of the House
and Senate. The Texas Alliance of Energy
Producers has kicked into high gear
our efforts in Washington, because even
though the Alliance is not an oil cartel
we got the message loud and clear.

way to numbers on the same subjects
from the US Energy Information Administration. Other than minor differences in a few subcategories, the tables
will change little.
The main difference will be timing.
OGJ’s reporting lag with API has been
about a week and a half. API data in this
week’s issue thus are for the week that
ended June 22.
The reporting lag for EIA statistics on
imports, stocks, and refining will be a
week longer than that. When the new
EIA series start July 16, the numbers
will be for the week that ended June 29.
The numerical vintages for these operational categories then will match those
of OGJ’s three other weekly data series
from EIA: refined product prices, world
crude prices, and US gas storage.
Historical series in the new EIA data
categories, unlike those for the API
series they replace, are available in the
Online Research Center.

New table
Another change will appear in the
Statistics section July 16.
The section will include a new
monthly table from Waterborne Energy,
Houston, on US imports of LNG. It will
replace the monthly table of similar
data from EIA. In this case, the reporting lag will shrink to 11⁄2 months from
21⁄2 months. Otherwise, the table will
be like the one it replaces, showing
imports by country of origin.
As long as numbers remain vital
pieces of the oil and gas story, OGJ
will report statistics—even if people
other than OGJ’s busy statistics editor
need a printed program to know what
numbers will appear on a given week
in those tan pages at the back of the

Energy veto bait
The US Congress has acted out many of its
demagogic whims on energy. A few more are in
prospect. Veto season looms.
With energy bills already passed, the House and
Senate clearly want more to punish an unpopular industry than to act constructively on energy.
To oil and gas companies, the proposals would
be damaging if enacted but not ruinous. To the
consumers and taxpayers who would pay for the
blunders, harm would be far worse.
Only in a perversely political context can this
bundle of historically discredited ideas make any
kind of sense. Maybe congressional Democrats
intend to send President George W. Bush a bill they
know he’ll veto so they can scorn him as a friend
of Big Oil. What a way to govern.
Bush isn’t running for anything. Even though
it’s the start of what promises to be a vitriolic
presidential campaign, he should do what’s right
for the country instead of what he thinks might
help his political party, a large part of which is
fleeing him anyway. He has nothing politically to
lose. His country has much to lose if he doesn’t
defend it against the worst products of antioil
populism.
By approving energy legislation in present
form, Congress would be ignoring lessons of the
past and discouraging oil and gas investment in a
country that craves new supply. Each of the following measures, passed in some form by one or both
houses of Congress, represents a reason for Bush
to veto whatever mess reaches the White House:
• Making “price-gouging” in supply emergencies a crime. This would be a law against behavior Congress can’t define, enforcement of which
would amount to imposition of price controls.
Results would be diminished investment in new
supply and constrained sales in emergencies, just
what consumers don’t need.
• Extending antitrust enforcement to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Like
the price-gouging initiative, this measure would
restrict sales and discourage development of future
supply, but the effects would appear outside the
US. Inside the US, consequences would be the

same: lower supply and higher price.
• Asking the government to determine how
much and what kinds of energy people use.
Government shapes the energy market at best
by guessing and at worst by dispensing political
favors. Energy consumers and economies always
suffer when governments tinker with markets.
• Raising taxes on the oil and gas industry. Tax
hikes reduce capital available for investment in
supply. They also improve the relative allure of opportunities elsewhere. A legislature serious about
its expressed concern over foreign oil would seek
ways to cut taxes on domestic production and
refining, however unpopular such a move would
be while gasoline prices are high.
• Rescinding contracts and incentives. A political regime that erodes long-term project economics with short-term fiscal changes frightens capital.
It’s understandable that lawmakers want to change
deepwater leases containing royalty incentives to
insert price thresholds omitted in 1998 and 1999.
But the leases are contracts, and producers entered
them in good faith. To hold participation in future
lease sales hostage to renegotiation of the troublesome leases reflects bad faith by the government.
So do efforts to eliminate production incentives
enacted in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT)
after less than 2 years. Political stability is an
advantage in competition for exploration and production capital. The US can’t afford to squander it.
• Increasing the ethanol mandate. That the
EPACT ethanol mandate was a mistake becomes
clearer with time to everyone except the grain
growers and distillers getting rich from it. Expanding the mandate would aggravate problems rapidly
becoming manifest in the prices of food and fuel.
On ethanol, of course, Congress is mainly
following the president, who in his state-of-theunion speech urged a quintupling of the mandate
and won’t see a comparable initiative as objectionable. But Congress seems determined to send Bush
energy legislation with plenty of other reasons for
him to exercise the veto. To the great fortune of
energy consumers and taxpayers, one reason is all
that’s necessary. ✦

Energy demand will increase in
the US and worldwide this year as the
global economy continues to grow.
In the US, consumption rates for
natural gas, oil, coal, and nuclear energy
consumption all will climb, but the use
of energy from renewable sources will
decline slightly.
A gain in US LNG imports will offset
a decline in gas imported from Canada,
and US gas production will post a small
increase this year as
demand rebounds after
last year’s drop.
The oil market will
remain healthy, and US
demand for most petroleum products will grow. Inventories
of gasoline in the US are tight and look
to remain so in the second half of this

forecasts that demand will peak in the

The market will need more crude

little oil production growth is expected

IEA figures show that most demand
growth will take place in countries
outside the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development. Leading

As a result of increased domestic
crude production and a small hike in oil
demand, US dependence on oil imports
will fall slightly from its level of 2006.

America will grow 490,000 b/d, and
Canada and Mexico will each register small increases in demand for oil
products. Demand in OECD Europe and
Pacific countries will decline slightly
this year.
OGJ forecasts that worldwide oil
supply will average 86 million b/d this
year. This assumes that OPEC crude
supply rises to average 31 million b/d
in the third quarter and 32 million b/d
in the fourth quarter. In the first half of

Jan. 1—supplied about 30.2 million
b/d on average.
OPEC has not officially adjusted its
output ceiling since it implemented a
planned 500,000 b/d reduction at the
start of February 2007. Recent comments from OPEC officials indicate
that the organization has no plans to
consider a new ceiling before its scheduled September meeting, in spite of
high prices. OPEC continues to say that
market tightness is the result of refining
problems, not crude supply.
Supply from OECD countries will be
unchanged this year at 20 million b/d
as a dip in European production offsets
a small increase in North America.
The former Soviet Union will lead
2007 non-OECD supply growth, according to IEA. The agency expects
Russia’s crude and condensate production to average 9.95 million b/d, up
2.6% from last year.
With total non-OPEC supply declining to average 50.2 million b/d this
year from 50.8 million b/d and worldwide demand rising, the call for OPEC
crude escalates.

Oil prices
In its June 2007 Oil Market Report,
IEA said, “While it is clear that much of
the recent rise in crude prices has been
caused by US gasoline tightness, there
is a portion which is related to tighter
OPEC supply. Hopes for a moderation in
crude prices in the short term therefore
lie both with OPEC and the US gasoline
market.”
With limited spare oil production capacity and supply disruptions,
world crude prices have climbed since
the start of 2007. Hostilities in Nigeria—with attacks on pipelines, pumping stations, and offshore vessels—have
reduced production levels there.
The price of Nigerian Bonny Light
crude on June 1 was $71.04/bbl, up
from $60.64/bbl on Jan. 1. The recent
price was still slightly below its yearearlier level. Brent Blend crude from
the UK and Mexico’s Isthmus crude followed the same price pattern as Bonny
Light. Meanwhile, Arabian Light crude

on June 1 was up 21% from its Jan. 1
price and a bit higher than its year-earlier price.
Although they have been trending upwards since January, on average
2007 crude prices have declined from
a year ago on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. For the first half of this year,
the front-month contract closed at an
average of $61.60/bbl vs. $67.13/bbl
in the first half of last year.
OGJ expects the average cost of
crude this year for US refiners to decline about 5% from last year’s average
of $60.23/bbl. Compared with the first
half of 2006, refiners’ crude costs were

down about 7% in the first half of this
year.
Refiners have benefitted from sour
crude oil discounts relative to light
sweet crudes. The combination of plentiful supplies of sour grade crude and
greater demand for sweet crudes has
maintained a discount to West Texas Intermediate as refiners must meet lower
sulfur specifications for cleaner fuels.

strong demand pressured inventories of
gasoline throughout the first half of this
year, bolstering prices.
Pump prices for all types of gasoline this year will climb, averaging
$2.70/gal. Last year’s average pump
price across all types of gasoline was
$2.635/gal, according to EIA. The peak
month last year was July, with an average price of $3.046/gal.
Taxes on regular unleaded self-serve
gasoline currently average 43.6¢/gal
nationally, up from 42.4¢/gal at the
start of last year.
OGJ forecasts that the price of residential heating oil excluding taxes will
average $2.40/gal this year. The price
averaged a bit higher in the first quarter
of this year than during the corresponding 2006 quarter. For all of 2006 heating
oil excluding taxes averaged $2.362/gal.

Gas prices
The average US wellhead natural gas
price this year will be $7.00/Mcf, up
from $6.42/Mcf a year ago.
Gas prices began the year slightly
lower than their levels of a year ago.
There was plenty of gas in storage, and
the number of heating-degree days in
January and March was below normal.
In the second quarter, gas futures
prices on the NYMEX began to rise
amid expectations for an active Atlantic
hurricane season and warmer summer
temperatures.
During May the closing price of the
front-month contract for gas averaged
$7.822/MMbtu. During May 2006, the
average for the near-month gas contract
was $6.373/MMbtu.

US energy
Real gross domestic product, the
output of goods and services produced
in the US, increased at an annual rate of
0.6% in the first quarter of 2007, according to preliminary estimates by the
Bureau of Economic Analysis. That was
less than half the growth rate BEA had
predicted earlier and followed a fourthquarter 2006 growth rate of 2.5%/year.
Although GDP growth has slowed
from last year, many economic indicaOil & Gas Journal / July 2, 2007

tors remain positive for growth.
Real personal consumption expenditures increased 4.4% in the first quarter
of 2007, compared with an increase of
4.2% in the fourth quarter of last year.
Excluding energy and food prices, US
inflation has been little changed this
year, and unemployment remains low.
In May, the consumer price index
rose just 0.7%, and unemployment was
4.5%, according to the US Department
of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics.
First-quarter 2007 productivity in the
nonfarm business sector picked up 1%
from the fourth quarter of 2006.
OGJ forecasts that GDP this year will
grow 2%. Last year’s growth rate was
3.3%. Some of the pull on economic
growth so far this year has been the
weak housing market.
With this year’s increase in economic
activity there will be a small increase in
energy consumption. Total energy demand in the US will grow 1.6%. Since
this pace is below the rate of growth in
GDP, energy efficiency will improve to
8,699 btu/$ of GDP from 8,730 btu/$
during 2006.

Nuclear energy net generation will
climb 2.3% to a record high 8.4 quads
this year. In the first quarter of 2007,
the 104 operating nuclear units in the
US ran at an average 94% of capacity,
according to EIA. Nuclear energy will
account for 8.3% of total US energy
demand this year.
The total of all forms of renewable
energy used will be 6 quads, down
3.3% from last year. Hydro demand is
down due to below-normal precipitation in the northwestern US. Renewable
energy sources, which include solar,
hydro, wind, wood, and others, are
mostly used by industrial and electric
power customers.
In the first 3 months of 2007, conventional hydroelectric power consumption was down 11% from a year
earlier. During the same period electricity generation from wind grew 18% but
still totaled just 79 trillion btu for the
quarter.

US gas market
Electric power and residential customers will push total gas demand to
22.49 tcf this year.
Gas is in greater demand as a result
of more heating-degree days in the first
4 months of 2007 than during the same
2006 period and a summer that’s expected to be warmer than normal. Also,

OGJ forecasts that 2007 crude
imports will average 10.2 million b/d,
and imports of oil products will average
3.56 million b/d. The US resumed importing crude for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in March, according to
EIA. This is the first month of imports
for the SPR since May 2006.
For the third straight year, Canada
was the largest source of US imported
crude oil in 2006, when the US received an average 1.782 million b/d
from the country.
The second largest source for US
crude imports last year was Mexico, followed by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and
Nigeria.
US crude imports from OPEC member countries averaged 4.78 million
b/d last year, up slightly from a year
earlier. Oil product imports from OPEC
countries averaged 719,000 b/d, down
from 2005.
Canada also was the leading source
of US product imports last year. The US

imported an average of 521,000 b/d of
products from Canada, a bit less than
during the prior year. The next largest
26

sources of products imported by the
US last year were the US Virgin Islands,
Algeria, Venezuela, and Russia.

Oil inventories
Crude and product inventories will
finish this year nearly unchanged from
the end of 2006. Crude stocks will be
slightly lower at 310 million bbl, while
product stocks will total 700 million
bbl.
Crude stocks finished the first half
of 2007 about 3% higher than at
mid-2006. But inventories of most oil
products were lower than a year earlier
because of strong demand and refinery
problems.
Half-way through this year, stocks
of motor gasoline were down 5% from
a year earlier. Inventories of resid were
down 16%, and distillate stocks were
3% lower. At the same time, jet fuel
stocks were about 2% higher than at the
end of June 2006.
At the midpoint of this year, the
amount of crude in the SPR was 690
million bbl, barely up from a year
earlier. Since imports of crude for the
reserve have resumed, OGJ forecasts that
SPR stocks will be 700 million bbl at
the end of this year. At the end of 2006,
SPR stocks totaled 688.6 million bbl.

Reﬁning
OGJ forecasts that this year’s average
US refinery utilization will be 90.2%,
up from 89.7% last year. This assumes
total inputs to refineries of 15.78 million b/d with operable capacity of 17.5
million b/d.
For the first 5 months of this year,
US refinery utilization was 87.8%,
roughly the same as a year earlier when
some Gulf Coast refineries were struggling to resume normal operations following damage from the previous year’s
hurricanes.
US refinery activity in the first half
of this year was hampered by numerous
outages and unscheduled shutdowns for
maintenance, which led to lower product inventories. At the same time demand for products was strong, up from
a year earlier. Limited supply and strong
demand pushed up product prices.
Refiners have had healthy cash margins for a couple of years.

last year averaged $12.52/bbl, according to Muse, Stancil & Co. This compares with a 2005 average of $12.90/
bbl. For the first 5 months of this year,
that margin averaged $15.10/bbl, up
9.5% from the corresponding 2006
period.

But West Coast margins have been
much higher than that, averaging
$23.98/bbl for 2006 and $27.71/bbl
for the first 5 months of this year. The
monthly average for the West Coast margin peaked in May 2006 at $39.61/bbl.
There are still no firm plans to build

a new refinery in the US, so operations
will stay close to capacity rates unless demand slumps. Companies have
weakening incentive to build capacity
in light of calls for limits on the use of
hydrocarbons and the rigorous permitting required for new facilities. ✦

US drilling growth slower as Canada faces large decline
Alan Petzet
Chief Editor-Exploration
Rising costs are slowing the recent
rate of drilling growth in the US and
savaging drilling in Canada.
Active rig counts in the first half of
2007 were 11% higher than the same
period in 2006 in the US compared
with full-year increases of 19% and
16% the previous two years, respectively.
Canada’s rig count ran almost one
third lower in January through June
2007 than in the first half of 2006.
Here are highlights of OGJ’s midyear
drilling forecast for 2007:
• Operators will drill 47,343 wells
in the US, up from the 47,003 OGJ estimated in the early-year forecast (OGJ,
Jan. 15, 2007, p. 31).
• Operators will drill 3,815 exploratory wells of all types, up from an
estimated 3,550 last year.

• The Baker Hughes Inc. count of
active US rotary rigs will average 1,780
rigs/week this year, up from 1,649 in
2006 and 1,383 in 2005.
• Operators will drill 19,164 wells
in western Canada, down from an estimated 24,105 wells in 2006.

Drilling rates
Onshore gas plays seemed to be
driving most of the gains in US drilling.
Arkansas, its Arkoma basin Mississippian Fayetteville shale gas play gaining
momentum, averaged 41.9 rigs/week
in the first half, 116% of the 2006 first
half total (Table 1). The lead Fayetteville
operator, Southwestern Energy Co.,
Houston, was running 19-20 rigs in the
play, 15 of which are capable of drilling
the curves and laterals of the horizontal
wells.
With net acreage of 1,400 sq miles
to evaluate and rigs still working 10
miles from each other in many areas,

Southwestern is probably no more
than 50-60% along the learning curve
with the Fayetteville shale that Mitchell
Energy & Development Corp. climbed
with the Barnett shale in the Fort Worth
basin, Southwestern Chairman, Pres.,
and Chief Executive Officer Harold M.
Korell said in June.
Barnett shale drilling helped in
North and West Central Texas. North
Texas Dist. 9 was up modestly at 35
rigs/week, while West Central Texas
Dists. 7B and 7C combined for a 29%
increase on the year to a total of 93 rigs.
It is reported that 6,600 wells have been
drilled in the Barnett shale play through
mid-2007 since 1981.
Operators in East Texas Dists. 5 and
6, with the Bossier and numerous other

horizontal oil play moved east.
Wyoming averaged 76 rigs/week in
the first half, down 22%. Other declines
occurred in New Mexico and the Gulf
of Mexico.
The international rig count excluding the US and Canada was about 9%
higher at 903 rigs/month in the first
half of 2007 compared with a year
earlier. Most of the increase came in the
Middle East and Latin America (Table
2).

Canada’s status
Canada’s outlook is bleaker as many
producers became squeezed between
several years of rising costs and lower
natural gas prices.
Gas prices in Canada have largely re-

vertical and horizontal plays going
strong, fielded a combined 287 rigs/
week, 46% more than in the first half
of 2006.
Mississippi’s first half average was
nearly 17 rigs, almost three times the
2006 figure.
Oklahoma had a respectable 7.7%
gain to 182 rigs/week.
Colorado averaged 102 active rigs in
January through June, 18% more than
in the same period a year earlier.
Utah averaged 42 active rigs in the
first half, up 22% on the year.
North Dakota picked up rigs while
Montana lost ground as the Bakken

covered from weakness in 2006, but the
fallout in lower drilling persisted well
into the second quarter in the Western
Canada basin.
Initial production at western Canadian gas wells is around 200 Mcfd,
only one-fourth of what it was in the
late 1990s. Unconventional gas wells
are being drilled in great numbers, and
their expected ultimate recovery is often
greater than that of conventional wells,
but they start out at low levels.
OGJ counted only four well bores
drilled off Atlantic Canada in the first
half of 2007, all of them off Newfoundland.

down two percentage points from the
group’s estimate at yearend 2006.

Canadian spending
Investments in Canada in 2007 are
expected to decline by a bigger margin than was predicted last December,
Lehman Bros. reported.
“While oil and gas companies modestly added to their expenditure plans
for 2007 in Canada, these companies
also overspent their 2006 budgets by
$1.6 billion, which led to a bigger drop
in capital expenditures year-over-year.”
The Lehman Bros. survey results
indicate that “Canadian E&P expenditures are anticipated to fall 11% in 2007
to an aggregate spending level of $24.6
billion by the 72 companies that we
surveyed, as opposed to the 7.5% drop
indicated in our yearend survey.” The
firm said it attempted to exclude oil
sands spending from the survey.
The largest budget cuts are expected
from the biggest companies (Table 3).
Those companies that spend more than
a $1 billion a year are now expected
to reduce spending by 13% in 2007

ussia indisputably is a growing force in world energy. That’s
why it’s good to periodically hear the
perspectives of actual Russians.
Two of them discussed “Russia,
the European Union and China: The
State of the Energy Security Debate”
at a June 21 Washington forum sponsored by the US Department of State’s
Bureau of Educational and Cultural
Affairs. The event took place about a
mile from where the US Senate was
debating an energy bill aimed at reducing reliance on imported oil and
increasing development of renewable
and alternative sources.
The Russians were interested in
diversification, too. Their country’s
location between China and Europe
makes it only natural for them to
want to export oil and gas into more
than one market, observed Maria
Belova of the Institute for Energy and
Finance in Moscow. “This involves
not only security of supplies, but
security of demand,” she said.
Shipments to the east ultimately
could go beyond China. “We negotiate
with all Asia-Pacific countries and try
to choose the best option. China has
growing demand but may not be willing to pay the best price. Negotiating
with Japan and Korea may show China
we have other choices,” she said.

retailers in some US cities, Russian
oil has not significantly penetrated
the US market because of perceived
limits on export capacity and a belief
that Russian crude is such low quality
that it requires special refining equipment, he said.
“Russia will never sign the European Energy Charter and Transit Protocol because it will never privatize
Gazprom,” the state-owned natural
gas giant, Merkushev predicted. There
is room to negotiate transportation
and foreign investment upstream, he
said, “But please give us a chance to
invest downstream in markets outside
our own country.”

1990s experience

Both Russians said their country has learned a lot from its initial
exposure to outside investment during the 1990s. “Sakhalin lost 28%
of its population during that period
because the foreign partners hired
Canadians and Americans instead of
local people,” Merkushev said.
“We need experience and technology more than foreign investments,”
added Belova, who noted that
Russia’s production growth has come
from Soviet era properties. “Contractors have tried to sell us adequate,
rather than the best, technology.

to reduce emissions of ozone precursors, mainly nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds.
It proposes to lower the 8-hr primary ozone standard, which is designed
to protect human health, to 0.07-0.075
ppm from 0.8 ppm. EPA also is taking
comments on alternative standards from
0.06 ppm to the current 0.08 ppm, 8hr standard.
The secondary standard, aimed at
protecting trees, plants, and crops,
would become lower to protect vegetation during growing seasons or
remain identical to the primary standard. “New scientific evidence since
the last review shows that repeated
exposure to low levels of ozone damages vegetation, leading to increased
susceptibility to disease, damaged
foliage, and reduced crop yields,” EPA
said in a fact sheet issued with the
proposal.

Industry reactions
Oil industry groups warned that
reducing the ozone NAAQS is unnecessary and could limit growth in domestic refining capacity. “The current
standard is working,” the American
Petroleum Institute said in a statement.
“Emissions from cars and trucks as
well as from power plants are being
significantly reduced and the air is
getting cleaner as a result. Even more
progress will be made over the next 2
decades, due to control programs that
are already in place.”
Charles T. Drevna, executive vicepresident of the National Petrochemical
& Refiners Association, said EPA itself
has noted that emissions contributing to the six pollutants with statutory
standards dropped 54% from 1970 to
2006 as the US economy grew dramatically, and national average ground-level
ozone levels have fallen 21% since
1980.
“Since the states have not yet fully
implemented the current standard,
EPA should instead help localities
implement the current standard before
imposing a brand new one that could

IEA reports industrial energy efﬁciency analysis
Changes to manufacturing technology worldwide could cut energy use
18-26% and also reduce carbon dioxide
emissions, the International Energy
Agency said in a report released June 25
in Paris.
IEA Director Claude Mandil said,
“Manufacturing industries in [Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development] countries have made
great progress in energy efficiency
during the last 25 years, but important opportunities to reduce emissions
remain.” His comments came as he
released a report entitled “Tracking
Industry Energy Efficiency and CO2
Emissions.”
In 2005, the Group of Eight (G8)
leaders asked IEA to provide advice on
a clean, competitive energy future. The
report analyzed industrial energy efficiency.
The report said the manufacturing
industry accounts for 36% of world

CO2 emissions. CO2 is a greenhouse
gas blamed for contributing to global
warming.
IEA analysts used 27 gigatonnes/year
of CO2 emissions as a reference for their
calculations. That was based upon 2004
statistics. They said industrial CO2 emissions reduction potential amounts to
1.9-3.2 gigatonnes/year.
Among other industries, IEA studied
chemicals and petrochemicals, iron
and steel, cement, aluminum, pulp and
paper.
The chemical and petrochemical
industry accounts for 30% of global
industrial energy use and 16% of CO2
emissions, the report said.
Benchmarking studies suggest potential energy efficiency improvements for
olefins and aromatics range from 10%
for polyvinyl chloride to 40% for various types of polypropylene, IEA said.
The report said manufacturing in

general could be made more energy-efficient by upgrading factory engines,
including adjustable speed drives, steam
systems, and combined heat and power,
and also by recycling materials.
IEA noted that energy efficiencies
differ widely between countries. China
accounted for 80% of the growth in industrial production and CO2 emissions
during the past 25 years, the agency
said. Mandil said improving industrial
energy efficiency can help developing countries’ economic growth while
contributing to reduced greenhouse-gas
emissions.
“The potential is so large that more
efforts are warranted, in order to
achieve deep CO2 emission reductions,
reduce fossil fuel dependence, and
increase industrial competitiveness,”
Mandil said. The report concluded
that more work needs to be done to
improve the quality of the data and to
refine the analysis, he said. ✦

upporters of former OAO Yukos
Chief Executive Mikhail Khodorkovsky gathered in Moscow last week
to celebrate his 44th birthday, and
reports say that things went well

Local radio station Echo Moskvy
reported that 40 people gathered at
Gogolevsky Boulevard on June 26 to
wish Khodorkovsky good health and
patience, after which they uncorked
bottles of sparkling wine.
Notably, Echo Moskvy said the
celebration passed without intervention by the police. If that sounds a
bit odd, consider similar celebrations held in Chita, the Siberian town
where Khordorkovsky is imprisoned.
Representatives of a company that
produces and organizes fireworks
were detained in Chita on June 26

“Based on Article 51 of the Russian

“As far as I know, the two employees of the firework company who
were detained on Tuesday morning

The cameraman and the employees
of the fireworks company were eventually released after—as Savvateyeva
put it—“the company’s manager presented a license to run this business.”

rules are insufficient to address crossownership that could lead to large
incumbents abusing their position and
stifling competition. However Germany
took an important reform step when
it installed an energy market regulator,
the Bundesnetzagentur, in 2005, and
the country has made other important
improvements over the past 5 years.
IEA recommended that the government introduce separate independent
system operators to manage transportation assets so all markets are on an
equal footing and to drive competition.
Although Germany is keen to address
climate change within its energy policy,
IEA urged that Germany rethink how
it uses the European Union’s emissions

attack, while Oxy said only that one of
its subcontractors, a non-American, was
killed. A local governor claimed the Yemeni guard was mentally ill—a phrase
often used by officials when terrorists
are involved in violence.
The shooting came just days after an
earlier attack in nearby Aden. On June
19, Yemeni security officials said they
arrested two men, suspected of being
linked to al-Qaeda, who confessed to
the attempted bombing of an oil pipeline in the southern province.
The attacks come amid renewed

warnings of violence against Westerners
in the country, particularly on the oil
sector.
On June 21, a terrorist web site
posted an undated audio statement
from the leader of the so-called “Al-Qaeda of Jihad Organization in the Land of
Yemen.”
A speaker on the audio said the
Yemeni group would not negotiate with
the government and that the group will
“continue jihad until the last Crusader is
driven out of the Arabian Peninsula.”
Last November, the same web site
posted the first statement from the

group, in which it claimed responsibility for attacks on oil facilities in Hadramaut, Yemen.
Terrorists have long sought to disrupt Yemen’s oil developments.
In October 2002, the French Foreign
Affairs ministry confirmed that the
“initial results” of the investigation
being conducted by French, Yemeni,
and American investigators aboard the
tanker Limburg indicate a terrorist
attack (OGJ Online, Oct. 11, 2002). AlQaeda later claimed responsibility for
the attack in which one seaman aboard
the Limburg was killed. ✦

a partnership of Statoil, the Norwegian
government, and the newly announced
partners. Statoil will own 20% of the
center, to be called the European CO2
Test Centre Mongstad.
A 2006 agreement between the Norwegian government and Statoil outlines
plans to develop an “environmentfriendly” power project at Mongstad.
The CHP station is expected to supply
280 Mw of electricity and 250 Mw of
heat. The refinery will use some of the
heat and electricity with the surplus
electricity probably to be sold to Norwegian oil and gas operations, including Norwegian North Sea platforms.
The Norwegian Ministry of the
Environment issued an emissions permit

must proceed in parallel development
with the CHP station. The full-scale CCS
project, scheduled to be in place by Dec.

to participate in the test center after

to make that commitment, a ministry
spokesman said.

Statoil’s carbon strategy
Statoil said the test center will develop, test, and qualify carbon capture
technology to help reduce costs and
risks associated with large-scale carbon
capture. The company’s intention is to
develop technology capable of capturing more than 2 million tonnes/year
of CO2 at Mongstad. Both Statoil and
the Norwegian government intend for
technology and expertise acquired there
to be available for international application.
In a related development, Statoil
signed a joint development contract
with technology development company
Alstom to test chilled ammonia capture of CO2 from flue gases particular
to natural gas combined-cycle power
plants. The objective is to construct a
chilled ammonia test plant, and Statoil
intends to include this in the work at
the Mongstad test center.
Statoil and Alstom have collaborated on chilled ammonia capture
since 2005, and the joint development
contract is a step toward commercialization, Statoil said. Research indicates
chilled ammonia-based CO2 capture can
remove as much as 90% of CO2 from
flue gases, Alstom said.
“We have chosen to work in parallel with one technology with great
potential, chilled ammonia, which is
less mature and therefore represents a
higher risk,” said Dag Vareide, Statoil’s
vice-president for research and technology. In parallel, Statoil plans to advance
CO2-removal amine technology.
“We have more experience with
amine technology, and its use includes
carbon capture at Sleipner, Snohvit, and
In Salah,” Vareide said.
At Sleipner natural gas field in the
Norwegian North Sea, CO2 content is
about 10%. The CO2 has been extracted
from the gas flow since 1996 at the
rate of 1 million tpy and reinjected into
a nonpetroleum reservoir at 1,200 m

overlying the field reservoir, which lies
at 3,000 m subsea. The aim is to gather
data to develop sound methodologies
for assessment, planning, and long-term
monitoring of underground CO2 storage on and offshore.
Snøhvit gas field in the Norwegian
Barents Sea has a high CO2 content. The
development includes piping the field
gas to an onshore facility. CO2 will be

extracted from the gas stream and piped
back offshore for injection into a sand
aquifer underneath the gas field. The
methane will be converted to LNG at
the onshore facilities.
In Algeria, Statoil in involved with
CO2 sequestration at the In Salah project, which involves a group of gas fields
and a massive processing complex. BP
PLC is the project operator. ✦

The issue of accuracy in reporting
oil and gas reserves and resources in
the Middle East gulf region has been a
cause for professional concern inside
and outside the region for many decades.1 Hundreds of billions of barrels
of oil reserves are reported as proven
and undiminished, year-after-year, even
though little technical data are available to confirm the reliability of these

estimates.
While some producers such as Iraq
and Iran have not conducted significant
exploration and development programs for years to justify their current
reserves, others such as Kuwait have
reported conflicting proved reserves
that fluctuated from 48 billion bbl to
100 billion bbl.2
To further compound these issues,
unsubstantiated reports have frequently
appeared in the general media that
further obfuscate the accurate oil and
gas resource estimates for this region.
For example, on Apr. 18, 2007, the
energy consultancy IHS Inc. issued a
press release that stated that up to 100
billion bbl of oil resources remain to
be discovered in the western desert of
Iraq (www.ihs.com).
Within days, this
_________
release was quoted on the front-page of
London’s Financial Times followed by
many other newspapers and magazines
(for example: Dubai’s Gulf News, Apr.
23; Time magazine, Apr. 24; Cyprus’
MEES, Apr. 30).

geology. The latter study estimated the
undiscovered oil resources of Iraq’s
western desert to total only half a billion barrels at the 95% level of probability and 1.6 billion bbl at the 50%
level of probability.3
The USGS-GeoDesign study used
a modern geological-statistical basin
model that combined all the then-available data and knowledge regarding the
petroleum reservoirs, source rocks,
migration routes, and structural traps of
Iraq. It considered 526 known prospects and fields, of which 370 remained
undrilled, to estimate the potential
number and sizes of undiscovered fields
(Fig. 1).
The IHS press release stated that its
own study had evaluated a comparable
number of 516 known structures, of
which 435 were undrilled prospects
or noncommercial discoveries. From
these statistics, we can conclude that
both studies worked with essentially the
same databases.
The USGS-GeoDesign study concluded that all the undiscovered crude
oil resources of Iraq, including the
western desert, may only total 13.2 billion bbl at the 95% level of probability
and 45.1 billion bbl at the 50% level
of probability. Even under the most
optimistic circumstances at the 5% level
of probability, USGS-GeoDesign did not
consider the entire Iraqi undiscovered
resources to exceed 84.1 billion bbl.
These total estimates fall far short of
the IHS conclusions for just the western
desert of Iraq.

Iraq’s western desert.
The analog to Akkas field is Jordan’s
Paleozoic Risha field located along
the Iraqi-Jordanian border. Risha field
produces 30 MMcfd of gas from more
than 30 wells. It extends across a vast
area (10 by 50 km), but the reservoir is
a thin sheet of complex sandstones in
faulted glacio-fluvial channels, ranging
in thickness from 2 to 12 m. Its proven
reserves are 180 bcf of gas, the equivalent of only 32.4 million bbl of oil.
Besides Jordan and Iraq, this Paleozoic petroleum system has also been
evaluated in eastern Syria and northwest
Saudi Arabia by both seismic surveys
and wildcat drilling. In Saudi Arabia,
these efforts identified numerous
exploratory prospects of considerable
acreage and vertical closure comparable to other features throughout the
gulf region. The oil and gas sourcing
and reservoir preservation in these
prospects, however, was disappointing.
Only one small gas field was discovered
near the northern Saudi Arabian city of
Tabuk.
In contrast to these efforts, other
exploration activities in Saudi Arabia
and adjacent Middle East gulf countries
have discovered numerous Paleozoic oil
and gas fields, including the Khuff gas
reservoirs, and the pre-Khuff Unayzah
and Al Jawf reservoirs in Saudi Arabia.
Based on these extensive regional
efforts and exploration results, the
indications are clear that this vast region
(extending from northwest Saudi Arabia
through eastern Jordan and Syria, and
western Iraq) is not very prospective
for oil. In fact, to discover 100 billion
bbl of crude oil in the western desert
of Iraq, as suggested by the IHS report,
would require discovering and delineating the equivalent of 3,000 Risha-sized
oil fields. Clearly if this was a realistic
possibility, many similar prospects
would have been drilled and oil or gas
discovered decades ago in Syria, Jordan,
and northwestern Saudi Arabia.

Estimation process
Perhaps the most important conclusion to be drawn from these profoundly

contradictory studies is the need for a
higher level of discipline and objectivity
in the process of estimating global oil
reserves and resources.
After all, the difference between the
two studies in this one region represents nearly 100 billion bbl of oil

resources. This in turn is the equivalent
of 10% of the entire world’s reported
proven oil reserves.
While arriving at identical conclusions from such studies for one geological region is not realistic, discrepancies in technical estimates that differ by
two orders of magnitude must surely

Ghadames fueling Tunisian oil production growth
The Ghadames basin in southern Tunisia has become a core area for Pioneer
Natural Resources Co., Dallas, which
is operating or participating in oil and
gas-condensate developments on several
blocks.
Pioneer is evaluating opportunities
to extend its Ghadames basin position
into Algeria and Libya.
While it builds oil production
facilities this year on the 384,000acre Jenein Nord Block, Pioneer and
other producers are working with the
government to evaluate the opportunity
to expand infrastructure to supply gas
from the southern part of the country
to northern Tunisian markets. Jenein
Nord is 450 miles south of Tunis.
Playing mainly the Silurian, Pioneer
has drilled four new field discovery
42

wells on the Jenein Nord Block since
late 2006 with combined multizone
gross test rates of 30,000 boed, 85% oil
and 15% gas-condensate. Pioneer noted
that the combined test rate isn’t necessarily indicative of an actual combined
production rate.
The company’s net production of
5,000 boed as of late May is expected to
grow 80% in 2007 with start-up of the
Jenein Nord discoveries near the end of
the year and 90% in 2008.
The most recent discovery, Shaheen1, tested at 8,000 boed (OGJ Online,
June 8, 2007). The other discoveries are
Waha, Cherouq, and El Badr.
Meanwhile, Pioneer has participated
in 11 wells with 10 successes on the
Adam concession, where Eni SPA is the
operator. Production there exceeded

20,000 b/d, and a new discovery went
on line in mid-May 2007 at 3,500 b/d.
With a $70 million hike in 2007
capital spending, the company expects
to drill at least seven more wells this
year. That will include up to four exploration wells on Jenein
Nord and three wells on the adjacent
nonoperated blocks. The net position is
3.9 million acres.
Pioneer operates Jenein Nord with
100% interest, and Tunisia’s state ETAP
has a 50% back-in right.
The company and its partners have
acquired 1,200 sq km of 3D seismic,
and Pioneer has identified more than
30 prospects on its acreage, some with
individual resource potential as large as
25 million boe.

London’s Aurelian drills its ﬁrst well in Poland
Aurelian Oil & Gas PLC, a Londonbased exploration and production
company, prospects in central Europe:
Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Bulgaria (OGJ, Apr. 23, 2007, p. 8).
Through its wholly owned subsidiary, Aurelian Oil & Gas Poland Sp.
z o.o., the company operates Polish
concessions in two areas: Poznan
East in Poland’s central lowlands and
Bieszczady in the southeast, along the
productive Carpathian trend, which follows the mountain belt from Austria in
the west, through the Czech and Slovak
Republics, Poland, and into the Ukraine
and Romania (www.aurelianoil.com).
______________

Poznan East
Aurelian’s 90% Polish subsidiary,
Energia Zachod Sp. z o.o., holds 100%
of two concessions in the Poznan East
area. The Polish licensing authorities
executed the Mining Usufruct agreement (MUA) in September 2002 and
granted the 6-year concessions in
February 2003.
Aurelia acquired seismic in ﬁrst-half
2006 and selected a drilling location.
In November 2006, Energia Zachod
announced it had signed a contract
with Oil & Gas Drilling “Nafta” Ltd. of
Pila to drill the Trzek-1 appraisal well on
the Siekerki structure. This is Aurelian’s
ﬁrst well in Poland.
State oil company POGC drilled
four wells on the Siekerki structure in
the 1970s, all with gas shows in the
Permian Rotliegendes formation. The

Oil & Gas Exploration Co. Jaslo Ltd.
(Jaslo Drilling), Jaslo, southeast of Krakow, in eastern Poland. Jaslo drilled the
Zaniemysl-2 well for FX Energy in 2004
in the Fences 1 project area of western
Poland’s Permian basin (OGJ, Feb. 16,
2004, p. 39).
Oil and Gas Drilling Co. NAFTA Ltd.
(OGDC) is based in Pila, Poland, and
has been owned by POGC (100%) since

Rotliegendes formation is the reservoir in the giant Groningen ﬁeld in the
Netherlands and the main gas producing horizon in the UK and Dutch sectors
of the Southern North Sea. Aurelian
says the eastern end of this gas-producing basin lies in the Polish central
lowlands.
Aurelian prepared the Siekerki drill
site during the winter and spudded the
Trzek-1 well on Mar. 7, 2007, east of the
city of Poznan. Drilling was expected to
take 31⁄2 months.
Roy Hartley, Aurelian’s operations
director, told OGJ that the Nafta Pila
rig has a Upetrom mast, substructure,
hook, rotary, and swivel with 320 ton
capacity; Italian 1,700 hp drawworks,
and two National 1,300-hp mud pumps,
forming “a very effective rig.”
On May 16, 2007, Aurelian’s Managing Director Michael Seymour,
announced the “well being drilled at
Trzek is progressing, although the
drilling has been harder than originally
anticipated.” He said the target depth is
below 3,000 m.

Carpathian blocks
Aurelia has 100% interest and operatorship in three Carpathian blocks
(Swidnik, Medzilaborce, and Snina) in
Slovakia, abutting the Polish and Ukrainian borders. These licenses began
Aug. 1, 2006, and cover about 2,480 sq
km.
On Apr. 2, 2007, Seymour said the
company was reprocessing exist-

crews.
Pila has 10 land rigs that have

seismic work in early 2008, adding,
“We may seek a partner to share the
exploration risk.”

Bieszczady blocks
In November 2006, Aurelian signed
initial agreements with Eurogas Polska
Sp. z o.o. that will lead to Aurelian
taking a 25% interest in several blocks
in Poland’s Bieszczady area (bordering
Ukraine).
The Bieszczady blocks are adjacent
to the company’s Carpathian blocks in
Slovakia.
Aurelian’s assumption of interest
in Bieszczady remains subject to the
issue of a new MUA between the Polish licensing authorities and Polskie
Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo SA
(PGNiG; exploration and production
arm of POGC) and a joint operating
agreement between PGNiG, Eurogas
Polska, and Aurelian. PGNiG will hold
the MUA and the concessions on
behalf of itself (50%), Eurogas Polska
(24%), and Aurelian (25%).
In his Managing Directors Report, issued Apr. 2, 2007, Seymour said “Aurelian will pay Eurogas’ 25% share of the
ﬁrst €10 million of the work program
which should include 500 km of new 2D
seismic and at least one well.”
On May 16, 2007, Aurelian announced that “the joint operating
agreement is expected to be signed
this month and will be followed by the
acquisition of 2D seismic during the
summer months.”

Models using a hisProduction
tory match of past production and a bell-curve
approach provide an insight to the
various estimates for ultimate recovery
of conventional and unconventional gas
resources in North America.
The assessment will model natural
gas production in North America to
2130, except for gas hydrates.

Gas production, tcm/year

Published estimates of ultimate recovery resources (URR) for conventional gas in North America vary markedly.
In particular, Laherrere estimates 42.5
trillion cu m (tcm) for US and Canada,1
whereas Rempel estimates 69 tcm for
US, Canada, Mexico, and Greenland.2
Greenland and Mexico combined
have about 6 tcm of estimated URR.3
The URR estimates, therefore, for US
and Canada differ by about 20 tcm.
To determine a likely URR estimate
for North America, the assessment used
a model with various assumptions.4
Model 1 used Laherrere’s URR estimate of 42.5 tcm for US plus Canada,
and Model 2 used Rempel’s URR estimate of 63 tcm for US plus Canada.
Conventional gas production data
exclude coalbed methane, shale gas, and
US tight gas and were obtained from a
variety of sources.5-14 Data from these
sources unfortunately include Canada’s
tight-gas production.
Canada produces about 10-12 billion
cu m/year from tight-gas sands.15 16 Accordingly, both models add a Canadian
tight-gas URR estimate of 2 tcm to the
conventional URR estimates.
Fig. 1 illustrates the predictions. Both
models used only historic US and Canadian conventional natural gas production from 1918 to 1993.

The figure shows that from 1994 to
2005 the modeled production deviates
from historic data that plateau from
1995 to 2001. Both models increase
production in this period.
Model 1 peaks in 2003 and rapidly
declines, which is similar to the production data that decrease rapidly from
2001 onwards. Model 2 peaks in 2011
before rapidly declining. Both models
appear not to predict future production
well.

2080

2120

To provide a better prediction, the
assessment modified both models to account for stranded gas. From literature,
northern North America has about 6.7
tcm of stranded gas.17 18 Production of
this gas cannot begin until the industry builds pipelines, and it is uncertain
when those pipelines will be completed. An estimate places the date at about
2015 or slightly earlier.18
Estimates also indicate that the
pipelines will have a maximum gas flow

capacity of about 7.8 bcfd.18
Production from stranded North
American gas with a 7-tcm URR can be
simply modeled by assuming production increases linearly from completion
of the pipeline to a maximum production pipeline capacity, followed by an
exponential decline (Fig. 2).
The stranded gas was incorporated
into modified versions of Models 1 and
2, which used production data to 2005
and consequently reduced the conventional unstranded gas URR estimates
by 7 tcm, to obtain 37.5 and 58 tcm,
respectively (Fig. 3).
The two models produce different estimates of future conventional
gas production. Model 1 predicts
gas production will decrease steadily.
Conversely, Model 2 shows a continued decrease until 2015, followed by a
significant increase in production to a
peak in 2049.
Of the two predictions, Model 2
is more unlikely, given the increasing
reliance on unconventional gas, which
now supplies more than 30% of US
and Canada’s natural gas. Why develop
expensive unconventional gas if large
amounts of conventional reserves exist?
In looking at the US URR estimate,
which is calculated as the sum of produced, reserves, and resources, the production and reserves estimates of 28.7
tcm and 5.6 tcm, respectively, appear to
be values of combined unconventional
and conventional gas, contradicting its
claim of being a conventional gas assessment.3

Unconventional gas
The assessment also can include
unconventional gas in the model. URR
estimates of unconventional gas in the
US are:
• Tight gas: 200-627 tcf.11 19-22
• Coalbed methane: 50-180 tcf.9 23 24
• Shale gas: 50-150 tcf.8 11 24
The model used the highest estimates of 600 tcf (17 tcm) tight gas,
180 tcf (5 tcm) coalbed methane, and
150 tcf (4.2 tcm) shale gas.
As stated earlier, Canada also produces tight gas, but the production data are
52

unavailable. The model, therefore, adds
2 tcm (70 tcf) to the URR estimates
to accommodate Canadian tight-gas
production.
Estimates of tight-gas resources
in Canada vary from 300 tcf to 700
tcf.15 25-27 The US has about 6,000 tcf
of tight gas in place, and as stated the
URR is about 600 tcf, which equates to
about a 10% recovery.28 The model assumes Canada’s tight-gas URR is 70 tcf
(2 tcm), which is 10% of the highest

resource estimate.
The 70-tcf estimate is optimistic
given current recoverable estimates are
10-15 tcf.15 Estimates are that Canada’s
coalbeds hold 167 tcf of recoverable
gas,18 and its shale gas resources are at
least 860 tcf,29 although “tens of thousands of tcf” may be in place.30
The model assumes a recovery of
100 tcf of Canadian shale gas.
The shale and tight-gas models use
bell curves for estimating production.

FIRST-HALF 2007

Extraordinary
price volatility in the
motor gasoline market had a significant
effect on spot prices
and price-value relationships for ethylene feedstocks; but
prices for primary
coproducts lagged the surge in gasoline
and feedstock prices. These shifts
in feedstock and coproduct price
relationships, in turn, influenced
ethylene production costs and
prompted ethylene producers to
make significant changes in feed
slates.
Gasoline prices and octane
values are significant factors that affect
prices for light naphtha feedstocks and
key coproducts including propylene,
benzene, toluene, and xylenes (BTX).
We measure relative strength in gasoline prices using the price differentials
between unleaded regular gasoline and
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude,
and we measure octane values using the
price differentials between unleaded
regular and unleaded premium gasoline.
During first-quarter 2007, refiners
normally conduct late-winter turnarounds and complete major maintenance projects before the seasonal
increase in gasoline demand. Usu-

ally the decline in
gasoline production
occurs when demand
for gasoline is near
its lowest level of
the year and reduced
supply has a minimal
effect on prices.
This year, however,
according to US Energy Information
Administration statistics, motor gasoline imports during March-May 2007
were 200,000-300,000 b/d lower than
year-earlier volumes. This unexpected
fall in supply compounded the seasonal
decline in refinery production; total
inventories of motor gasoline declined
to a low of 193-194 million bbl (more
than 15 million bbl lower than in
March 2006) according to EIA’s Weekly
Petroleum Status Report.
During fourth-quarter 2006, unleaded regular gasoline-WTI differentials
averaged 12.7¢/gal and were significantly narrower than during third-quarter 2006. Additionally, these differentials during fourth-quarter 2006 were
only 5.6¢/gal higher than the average
for 2001-04.
Unleaded-WTI differentials on the
US Gulf Coast remained at reasonable
levels in January 2007 but increased
to 41.2¢/gal in March and jumped to
80-82¢/gal in May 2007, a new record
high for the monthly average.

Ethylene production
Ethylene production from fresh feed
totaled 13.36 billion lb in first-quarter
2007 (Table 2). Ethylene production
from steam crackers was 54 million lb
less than in fourth-quarter 2006 (less
than half a day’s output).
Production from LPG plants totaled
4.78 billion lb in first-quarter 2007
and was 173 million lb less than in
fourth-quarter 2006 (about 3 days of
production). Production from multifeed crackers totaled 8.59 billion lb in
the first quarter and was 119 million lb
more than during fourth-quarter 2006
(about 1.5 days of production).
LPG crackers operated at 89% of
nameplate capacity (21.6 billion lb/
year) during first-quarter 2007. Multifeed crackers operated at 87% of name-

Production, million lb/d

Ethylene industry demand for fresh
feed averaged 1.64 million b/d in
fourth-quarter 2006 and increased to
1.69 million b/d in first-quarter 2007.
Demand for LPG feedstocks (ethane,
propane, and normal butane) averaged
1.13 million b/d in fourth-quarter
2006 and increased to 1.2 million b/d
in first-quarter 2007.
Ethylene producers cracked a lighter
feed slate in first-quarter 2007. Specifically, LPG feeds accounted for 71% of
total fresh feed in first-quarter 2007
vs. 69% of fresh feed in fourth-quarter
2006. The shift to lighter feeds continued in April; LPG feeds accounted for
73.6% of total fresh feed. LPG feeds’
share of total fresh feed was previously
at this level in May 2006.
Table 1 shows trends in olefin plants’
fresh feed slates.
Based on projected ethylene industry
operating rates of 90-92%, total demand for fresh feedstocks will average
1.70-1.75 million b/d during second
and third quarters 2007. Total demand
for LPG feedstocks will average 1.231.25 million b/d; LPG feedstocks will
account for 71-73% of total fresh feed
during second and third quarters 2007.

Feedstock prices, coproduct values,
and ethylene plant yields determine
ethylene production costs. We maintain
direct contact with the olefin industry
and track historic trends in spot prices
for ethylene and propylene. We use a
variety of sources to track trends in
feedstock prices.
Some ethylene plants have the
necessary process units to convert all
coproducts into high-purity streams.
Some ethylene plants, however, do not
have the capability to upgrade mixed
or crude streams of various coproducts
and sell some or all their coproducts
at discounted prices. Our estimates of
ethylene production costs in this article
are based on all coproducts valued at
spot prices.

ary. Spot prices for BTX were 2.5-5.5%
higher in March than in January.
The lag in spot prices for major coproducts was a significant factor in the
divergence of ethylene production costs
based on natural gasoline and similar
light naphthas vs. production costs
based on ethane. As a result, light naphthas became generally more expensive
than ethane, especially during March.
The spike in motor gasoline prices
continued during April and May; spot
prices for natural gasoline-light naphthas and propane continued to diverge.
During April and May, spot prices for
natural gasoline increased an additional
14.3% and spot prices for light naphthas increased 13.3%. Spot prices for
propane, however, increased only 8.9%.
Spot prices for purity ethane increased 17.7% from March through
May. Despite the jump in spot prices for
ethane during April and May, variable
ethylene production costs for ethane
were consistently less than variable ethylene production costs for propane due
to the lag in spot prices for propylene.
60

For ethylene
producers that
have the capability to market all coproducts at spot prices, however, variable
ethylene production costs for ethane
were 1-2¢/lb higher than for natural
gasoline during April and May. For ethylene producers that market some or all
of their coproducts at discounted prices,
variable ethylene production costs for

ethane were 6-8¢/lb lower than for
natural gasoline during April and May.
Production costs for ethylene on the
Houston Ship Channel (based on full
spot prices for all coproducts) increased
to 29-30¢/lb in March from 22-25¢/lb
in January. Production costs for ethylene
continued to escalate during April and
May—the industry composite averaged
33-34¢/lb in May.

Production costs for natural gasoline jumped to almost 37¢/lb in May
and were 7¢/lb higher than in March.
The 20% increase in production was
primarily due to rising feedstock prices
resulting from the surge in spot prices
for unleaded regular gasoline.

for naphthas, condensates, and gas oils
narrowed to 1.8¢/lb in March from
8.6¢/lb in January.
Spot prices for ethylene increased to
38-39¢/lb in May, but margins based
on average production costs remained
at 4¢/lb. Margins for LPG feeds averaged
4.6¢/lb in April and May, but margins
for naphthas, condensates, and gas oils

began to increase during March-May,
spot prices for refinery-grade propylene
also moved higher, especially during
April and May.
Spot prices for refinery-grade propylene averaged 41.1¢/lb in first-quarter 2007. Contract prices for refinerygrade propylene averaged 39.2¢/lb in
first-quarter 2007.
After contracts settled for April,
spot prices for refinery-grade propylene began to move steadily higher. By
late April, spot prices averaged about
49¢/lb or 4.0-4.5¢/lb higher than in
early April. Almost immediately after
contracts settled for May, however, spot
prices for refinery-grade propylene
declined by about 5¢/lb.
The seasonal increase in refinery
merchant propylene sales began to improve availability and prices fell about
4.5¢/lb within a few days after the contract for May settled at 48.25¢/lb. Based
on data for the first three weeks of May,
spot prices for refinery-grade propylene
averaged 46.25-46.5¢/lb or 1.75-2.0¢/
lb lower than the May contract price.
Polymer-grade propylene prices usually command a premium of 4-5¢/lb
vs. refinery-grade propylene. During
first-quarter 2007, the premium for
polymer-grade propylene (contract
price basis) was consistently 5.5¢/lb
and remained at 5.5¢/lb in April but
narrowed to 5.25¢/lb in May.

slipped to 2.3¢/octane-gal in May.
Fig. 6 shows historic trends in incremental octane values on the US Gulf
Coast.
During first-quarter 2007, price differentials between refinery-grade propylene and spot alkylate were at their
peak in January but declined during
February-May. Spot prices for refinerygrade propylene averaged 12¢/lb more
than for alkylate in January but only
5.3¢/lb in March. In May, the differential between refinery-grade propylene
and alkylate narrowed to 2.5-2.75¢/lb.

Summer, fall 2007 outlook

Crude inventories in commercial
storage increased during first-quarter
2007. Total inventories of 320-325 million bbl at the end of March were 1620 million bbl higher than at yearend
2006. Furthermore, crude inventories
continued to increase during April and
May and reached 340-345 million bbl
at the end of May. Crude inventories
increased despite OPEC production
curtailments.
The significant improvement in

to recognize these improvements in
the near-term outlook for the gasoline
supply-demand balance, spot prices
for gasoline will fall sharply from their
abnormally high levels. Spot prices for
unleaded regular on the US Gulf Coast
are poised to decline 30-40¢/gal or
more during June and July.
When the collapse in motor gasoline
prices begins, the various bearish fundamental considerations for crude oil
will emerge as the dominant influences
on WTI prices. WTI prices will average
$60-62/bbl during third-quarter 2007
and will decline to $57-59/bbl during
fourth-quarter 2007.
The projected collapse in gasoline
prices and the continued decline in
octane values will also have a strongly
bearish effect on spot prices for propylene and BTX. Spot prices for refinerygrade propylene will average 41-43¢/lb
during third-quarter 2007 and 36-38¢/
lb in fourth-quarter 2007. Despite these
projected declines, refinery-grade pro-

pylene prices will average 6-8¢/lb more
than spot alkylate during second-half
2007 vs. 4¢/lb in second-quarter 2007.
Prices for all feedstocks and coproducts will decline during second-half
2007, but spot prices for light naphthas
and natural gasoline are likely to decline

more than for ethane and propane.
Composite production costs will therefore decline 3-5¢/lb during June and
July. During third-quarter 2007, cash
production costs will average 31-32¢/lb
vs. about 36¢/lb in May. ✦

The costs of two important chemicals
used in crude refining changed very little
during 2004-06, while the costs of three
others varied significantly.
The two stable chemicals were hydrofluoric acid with an index constant of
414.9 and sulfuric acid with an index
average of 397.4.
Sodium hydroxide ended with 644.9
in fourth-quarter 2006, rising from
529.6 in first-quarter 2004.
Platinum rose significantly to 1,466.4
in the last quarter of 2006 from 762.1
during first-quarter 2004. However,

capacity from projects such as those
announced by Tennessee

a key factor determining
whether REX will serve
Northeast demand with

will simply displace gulf
coast supplies currently
serving that market.
REX’s capacity constraints at the east
end of the system and their eventual
resolution will add to the uncertainty
surrounding flow displacements, supply-demand shifts, and regional pricing
adjustments brought about by REX.
Rockies prices will rise significantly
relative to other producing basins. If
the east end of REX is constrained, additional demand does not emerge to
mitigate the displacement of supplies
back into the gulf, and if net incremental production continues to add to
gulf supplies, it is not unreasonable to
expect that Rockies prices could even
trade at a premium to gulf prices.
The first article of this series examined the background of the REX pipeline project and analyzed the effect on
US natural gas markets of REX Phases I
and II.

This concluding article will detail
the market shifts expected as a result
of the combination of REX Phase III’s
completion and downstream capacity
constraints.

Capacity bottlenecks
Capacity of the receiving pipelines
will profoundly affect Rockies Express
Pipeline Phase IIIa flows. At Lebanon,
Ohio, constraints will limit the ability of customers east of REX to obtain
incremental supplies from it without
displacing gas from other areas. The
extension to Clarington in Phase IIIb
will provide access to available capacity
on Dominion Transmission, TETCO, and
Tennessee Gas Pipeline, but constraints
east of Clarington, in Pennsylvania,
New York, and New Jersey will limit
shippers’ ability to use REX as an incremental supply source on peak days,
particularly during the winter months.

Lebanon

When Phase IIIa is operational, shippers will be able to deliver 1.8 bcfd to
Lebanon (Fig. 1). Vectren and Cincinnati
Gas & Electric will be able to receive
gas directly from REX. Unless they have
incremental demand, however, a reduction in receipts from one or more of
these companies’ traditional suppliers
must offset receipts from REX.

comparison
When REX East
opens, REX shippers will have a dramatic price advantage to Lebanon over traditional supply areas, primarily because
of the commodity cost differential. Fig.
5 shows the advantage by comparing
the delivered price to Lebanon using
REX to the current pipeline alternatives, defining commodity costs as the
average 2006 price for the appropriate
supply point.
The average 2006 price of $5.78 at
Cheyenne serves as a proxy for REX.
With one exception, competitive pipeline prices use the 2006 average price
at the appropriate gulf supply point.
Midwestern Gas Transmission commodity prices use the average 2006 price at
Joliet. Price comparison demonstrates
that REX shippers are able to purchase
gas at a $0.50-1.00/MMbtu discount
to alternative supply sources. Customers
purchasing supply from REX suppliers
that can use Opal or another producing
area price point that historically trades
at an additional $0.10-0.30/MMbtu
discount to Cheyenne can gain an additional advantage.
The 2007 supply build up in the
Rockies has so far greatly exaggerated
Rockies price differentials. In April

2007 Cheyenne and Opal prices averaged $3.02/MMbtu less than Henry
Hub prices.
This price advantage, coupled with
the fuel-loss percent advantage, yields
significantly lower-priced supply at Lebanon. Fig. 5 shows the advantage ranging from $0.13/MMbtu on Panhandle
Eastern to $0.80/MMbtu on Texas Gas
Transmission and ANR’s Southeast leg.
This advantage will initially force spot
prices to decline in the gulf and East
Texas supply areas relative to Cheyenne,
Opal, and other Rockies production
pricing points.
REX IIIa will cause a significant
readjustment in prices, with Rockies
prices rising sharply relative to gulf
areas prices.
Once prices adjust after REX IIIa
enters service, the differential between
Cheyenne and the gulf and Cheyenne
and Joliet should settle at about $0.100.20/MMbtu.
Assuming gas prices across supply areas equal to $7.00/MMbtu at
the relevant purchase points, further
demonstrates the relative economics
of REX. This is not a price forecast but
instead highlights the differences in gas
transportation economics.

Assuming commodity-price differences that settle to reflect variable
transportation differentials, Fig. 6
shows current differentials narrowing
substantially, settling with gulf prices
about $0.20 higher than Rockies prices,
approximating the variable cost differential between the pipelines. This
transition, however, will occur between
December 2008 when REX IIIa commences service and July 2008 when
REX IIIb becomes operational.
Reaching Clarington maximizes the
REX market advantage. Rockies producers received an average of $0.52-0.91
less for their production than did gulfarea producers in 2006.This differential is substantially larger in 2007 and,
coupled with the lower fuel charges
associated with REX, translates into a
$0.80-1.17/MMbtu delivered price advantage for REX shippers over shippers
purchasing supplies from the traditional
gulf areas.
Assuming that REX’s commodity cost
advantages continue through 2008, REX
volumes should displace gulf volumes
once REX reaches Clarington.
REX’s price advantage at Clarington
will drive relative prices down in the
gulf and raise relative Rockies prices at

Again using a $7.00/MMbtu supply-area reference case, in which spot
prices at Cheyenne and the gulf are
equal, REX supplies hold an advantage
over Tennessee Gas and TETCO and
will be only slightly more expensive
than supplies shipped to the region via
Columbia Gulf. If the Rockies-to-gulf
price spread settled equal to the variable
transport differential, Rockies gas might
hold as much as a $0.42 premium over
some gulf supply points on TETCO and
slightly less on Tennessee Gas.

reduce or eliminate some of the Rockies

REX will go a long way toward allowing
Rockies gas to trade at or near parity
with gulf supplies.
REX market pressures will not occur
in a vacuum. Other factors will affect
the market while REX is being built.
Production increases in the East Texas,

Imports into the Northeast declined
by 157 MMcfd, or 6%, in 2006, and in
the Midwest imports declined by 193
MMcfd, or 5%. Three factors led to the
declines: falling production in Alberta,
increased use of natural gas for the
production of bitumen (oil sands), and
growing need for gas as a generation
fuel for new power facilities. All of these
factors increase the demand for Rockies
gas.

The sharp buildup of new production in the gulf region has compounded
the need for gas from the area to find
a new market. Exploration and development success in the Barnett Shale,
Woodford Shale and other relatively
new production areas in East Texas, the
Fort Worth, Arkoma, and Arkla basins
has resulted in strong incremental production gains.
During the next 2 years, several
new Gulf of Mexico projects, such as
Anadarko’s Independence Hub, are
scheduled to come online and could inOil & Gas Journal / July 2, 2007

$100 says:
crease production by more than 1 bcfd.
These projects will cause incremental
production in the region to swell for
at least a few years. If production gains
continue to accelerate even slightly, production from the region will be more
than 1 bcfd higher by the end of 2008,
when REX East comes online.

Demand growth
At the same time supply is building, demand is also growing. Bentek’s
demand forecast through 2010, which
closely matches the most recent US
Energy Information Administration
forecast, calls for growth in the Upper
Midwest, Northeast, Texas-Louisiana,
and Southeast market areas, almost entirely based on increased power-generation demand. Aggregate demand from
the four regions will have grown 3.9
bcfd, a 2.3%/year compound growth
rate, by 2010. The Texas-Louisiana-Arkansas and Southeast regions show the
highest incremental demand, 1.3 bcfd
and 1.1 bcfd, respectively, but demand
in the Upper Midwest and Northeast
regions will grow as well, by a 0.7 bcfd
and 0.8 bcfd, respectively.
Much of the gulf supply build will
supply this growing demand. CenterPoint Energy’s recently completed
Carthage-to-Perryville pipeline and
other pipelines under development will
improve producers’ ability to deliver
supplies to the higher demand-growth
areas. Similarly, gulf, East Texas, and
other Midcontinent supplies will be
able to use ANR, NGPL, Trunkline, and
Texas Gas Transmission to increase flows
to the Upper Midwest.

LNG wild card
LNG could add significantly to the
gulf supply build. Lake Charles already
has the potential to deliver more than
2.0 bcfd on a peak day and 1.8 bcfd on
a sustained basis. Four new gulf coast
LNG regasification plants—Sabine Pass,
Freeport, Golden Pass, and Cameron—are set to come online in 2008 or
2009, bringing an aggregate 7.6 bcfd of
incremental supply to the region.
Global competition for LNG supply
Oil & Gas Journal / July 2, 2007

among Europe, Asia, and the US, will
likely lead to low load factors at these
new US terminals, but a substantial
amount of LNG could arrive during the
shoulder and summer months. Asia and
Europe have inadequate storage to pull
demand for storage injection, resulting
in a high likelihood that summer and
shoulder-month prices in the US will be
more attractive to global LNG suppliers.

Recontracting capacity
A large number of firm transportation contracts on multiple interstate
pipelines will expire between 2007
and 2010. Fig. 7 shows the percentage
of volume covered by those expiring
contracts on pipelines that interconnect with REX (based on analysis of the
January 2007 Index of Customer filings
at FERC).
Across the pipelines shown, an average of 50% of firm contract volume will
expire before 2010. NGPL has the largest percentage of firm transport contracts expiring (69%), but because of
the competitive tariff economics it will
probably be the least affected by REX.
On the other hand, TETCO, Tennessee
Gas, and Panhandle, the three pipelines
which may be at the greatest competitive disadvantage, have 56%, 50%, and
55%, respectively, of their firm contracts
expiring for before 2010.
The expiry of so much of the contracted firm transport volume between
now and commencement of service on
REX East suggests that many East Coast
and Midwest utilities and end users (the
primary capacity holders on the affected
pipelines) will have the opportunity to
realign their supply portfolios. ✦

Worldwide, well over 50% of all pipelines use
coatings which shield (block) cathodic
protection currents if disbondment occurs.
If you specify corrosion coatings with solid
polymeric backings (shrink sleeves, tapes,
and most multilayer systems) on pipelines
with CP, the high dielectric backing can
block your protective CP current. This can
happen if and when the coating disbonds
from the pipe and water reaches the
disbonded area.
Cathodic shielding is a serious problem and a
documented problem. Since the late 80’s there
is a large body of published research on
shielding. Much of this research can be seen on
our website.
Corrosion coatings which permit the passage
of cathodic protection currents to water under
disbonded areas are called “fail/safe” coatings.
In other words, if the coating fails, your
cathodic protection current can keep your
pipeline safe.
Two types of corrosion coatings are proven to
allow the passage of protective CP currents.
One of these proven “fail/safe” coatings is FBE.
The other proven “fail/safe” corrosion coating
is Polyguard RD-6. We have sold RD-6 since
1988, so there are thousands of installations.
We know of no project where serious corrosion
or SCC has been found under the rarely seen
disbonded areas of RD-6.
If you call to discuss your current
specifications with our corrosion expert,
Richard Norsworthy (214.912.9072) we
will donate $100 to your favorite charity.

Updated seismic-to-simulation software
Newly released Petrel 2007.1 seismicto-simulation software includes new functionality for all disciplines in the exploration and development work flow.
It promises productivity for geoscientists and engineers, collaboration from
the field to office and back, and a shared
understanding of risk and uncertainty
enabling better decisions, in less time, the
company says.
New seismic performance and scalability in Petrel 2007.1 help improve the productivity of exploration teams to deliver
more high quality prospects, faster. Tighter
integration of reservoir engineering work

flows introduces simulation earlier, helping predict reservoir performance. Realtime data connections, from the rig to the
office, help increase operational accuracy
for better drilling performance and risk
management.
Highlights of the new software’s capabilities include enhanced seismic performance, handling and scalability for data
sets up to 60 gigabytes on the desktop, and
an optional connection to a Linux cluster
server for terabyte range data sets. Additional capabilities include new fractured
reservoir modeling supporting creation of
discrete fracture networks and ECLIPSE*
reservoir simulation dual porosity models,
multisegmented well support to accurately
model the fluid physics in horizontal
wellbores, and drilling enhancements
including WITSML real-time data feeds for
logs, events, and trajectories for immediate incorporation in Petrel for real-time
monitoring and modeling.

March 3 – 5, 2008 / Moody Gardens Hotel & Convention Center, Galveston, Texas

SUBSEA TIEBACK
Forum & Exhibition

PennWell invites you back to the 8th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition.
SSTB has become the premier event for one of the fastest growing field
development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March 3 – 5, 2008 in
Galveston, TX at the Moody Gardens Hotel & Conference Center. Over 2,000
people and 150 exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference.You can’t
afford to miss it.
As our industry confronts new challenges, it has never been more important
to submerse yourself in them. This year’s theme is “Subsea is here, the game
is changing.” As our game changes, the sharing of knowledge and collective
experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety,
and economics of the subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by
industry leaders. As in the past, only by participating in this conference will you
be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will not be published and no
Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room
stays inside the conference room. We hope you will join us.

Senate’s energy
bill pushes US
down wrong road
Throw away the apple from a bowl of
rotten fruit, and what do you have? A bowl
of rotten fruit.
The US Senate on June 21 rejected punitive taxes on the oil and gas industry but
still passed a stinker of an energy bill.
Its discarded package of tax changes
would have cost the industry an estimated
$26 billion over 10 years (OGJ Online, June
20, 2007). There went the rotten apple.

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

Remaining, however, are major new
favors for makers of biofuels and a measure that would make it a crime to charge
“unconscionably excessive” prices for oil
products in times of strained supply. Other
manipulations, less directly related to oil
and gas, also fester in the bill: toughened
fuel-economy standards for new vehicles,
new energy-efﬁciency standards for appliances and lighting, and spending for the
development of fuels politicians like but
cost-conscious energy consumers don’t.
The bill pushes the US further down
a dangerous road toward fuel choice by
politicians. Peril already is evident in the
leaping food costs that have accompanied
congressionally mandated use of corn for
fuel. The Senate bill would aggravate the
problem.
The political thinking behind these mistakes is equally putrid.
“The time has come for us to give the
same kinds of incentives to other industries—alternative energy, renewable fuels,
clean-coal technologies, and so forth—that
the oil and gas industry has enjoyed for
decades and decades,” opined Sen. Max
Baucus (D-Mont.).
Yes, incentives for the production of
oil and gas have come and gone over the
years. But when was there anything like the
simultaneous market mandates, protectionist tariffs, and whopper tax credits now
creating a boom for otherwise uneconomic
ethanol and biodiesel?
And where is the one no-cost move
Congress can make to give US energy
supply the meaningful and economic lift it
needs—opening off-limits federal land to oil
and gas leasing and development?
Nowhere, of course—not in a political climate misshapen by spite over the
price of gasoline. That void, which no one
is talking about ﬁlling, makes the Senate’s
bowl of rotten energy produce smell all the
worse.

Higher prices threaten demand
Demand for crude may fall if prices exceed $80/bbl, said analysts in the Houston
ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc.
“At almost $70/bbl, oil is currently trading at the same level that it was following
the spike caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005,” Raymond James analysts reported June 22. Market fundamentals remain strong with dwindling excess
production capacity of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, limited
growth in non-OPEC supplies, geopolitical risks, and “the thirst of a relatively strong
world economy,” they said. “At this point, our main fear for oil is whether prices
climb high enough to stir ‘demand destruction’ concerns. We believe that a price
north of $80/bbl is when such fears likely become justiﬁed,” Raymond James analysts said.
As labor unions in Nigeria rejected government offers to avert a nationwide
strike, the July contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes traded as high as
$69.56/bbl before closing at $69.10/bbl June 19, the highest front-month ﬁnish on the
New York Mercantile Exchange since Sept. 1. That contract expired June 20 at $68.19/
bbl June 20 as traders switched their focus to an unexpected jump in US crude
inventories to a 9-year high. The new front-month August crude contract dropped
21¢ to $68.65/bbl June 21 on NYMEX with Nigeria’s oil exports still not affected by a
strike that paralyzed most of that country’s economy.
Attacks on oil ﬁeld facilities and workers had already reduced Nigeria’s production in May to its lowest level since early 2003, said the Paris-based International
Energy Agency. Shut-in production averaged 800,000 b/d that month. IEA estimated
Nigerian production capacity at 2.49 million b/d, excluding 545,000 b/d considered
as long-term shut-in.
US inventories
US crude stocks jumped by 6.9 million bbl to 349.3 million bbl in the week ended
June 15 against expectations of a 100,000 bbl draw. US gasoline stocks gained 1.8
million bbl to 203.3 million bbl, still well below average for the time of year. Distillate
fuel inventories inched up 100,000 bbl to 122.7 million bbl.
US reﬁned product output declined by 150,000 b/d as gasoline production held
ﬂat and all other product rates declined modestly. “The industry average utilization
rate, surprisingly, fell from 89.2% to 87.6%, suggesting that the industry continues to
contend with downtime issues,” said Eitan Bernstein of Friedman, Billings, Ramsey
& Co. Inc., Arlington, Va. Product imports rose by 135,000 b/d with a 125,000 b/d
increase in gasoline imports.
Crude imports into the US Gulf Coast were “the largest number ever recorded”
despite lower Mexican production, said Olivier Jakob, managing director of Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland. “Crude oil stocks in the US are as high as they can
be, and there has been in the ﬁrst half of 2007 no evidence of reduced ﬂows to the
US despite the OPEC cuts,” Jakob said. “US crude oil stocks should come down with
coming higher reﬁnery utilization rate, but the draw is needed as we are basically at
peaks of recent known tank space capacity.”
Paul Horsnell at Barclays Capital Inc., London, said Gulf Coast imports surged because the economics of holding ﬂoating storage in the US Gulf of Mexico collapsed.
Due to the narrowing of time spreads [the selling of a nearby option and buying of a
more deferred option with the same strike price speciﬁed in the contract] for benchmark US crudes, he said, “Cash-and-carry arbitrage, (i.e., buy now, sell later, lock in
the prices, and store the oil), is becoming far less attractive.” That means that crude
held in ﬂoating storage off the US—“and there may have been as much as 20 million
bbl of it,” Horsnell said—must empty into either US gulf or Caribbean facilities.
“Indeed, some of the dynamics of the latest weekly US data suggest that the oil is
now ﬁnding its way into the data. The most suggestive data points are the 1.4 million
b/d rise in crude imports into the US gulf (while imports fell by 700,000 b/d in the
rest of the US), and the 6.6 million bbl build in Gulf Coast inventories, accounting for
virtually all the overall 6.7 million bbl build. Crude oil imports into the US gulf ran at
7.148 million b/d, the highest ever single week’s import level. Having the highest-ever
imports into the Gulf Coast at the same time as low imports elsewhere in the US,
at a time of high reﬁnery outages, does seem to very strongly suggest that some of
that ﬂoating storage is now making its way into the numbers,” said Horsnell.

10th FYP increased more than 72%, to
46.9 billion cu m in 2005 from 27.2

Paciﬁc Basin comeback
For a while, a couple of years ago,
industry expectations were that North
American LNG demand would surpass
the big Asian markets of Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. Those hopes spawned
an explosion of nearly 60 terminal
proposals. Reality—i.e., market forces
and warm winter weather—bit hard,
however.
Then it was Europe that was going
to drive LNG demand. Winter 2006-07
and plenty of gas cooled forecasters’
zeal, however.
Major Pacific Basin markets were
thought either mature or, in the case
of India and China, unwilling to pay
hefty world LNG prices. But Indian LNG
buyers have gotten over their reluctance
to pay world prices, importing nearly
6.2 million tonnes in 2006 and buying
ahead of that pace for 2007.
Trends evident in the 10th FYP
strongly suggest China will join India in
pushing Pacific Basin demand ahead.

Europe should play an ever-stronger
role in the Atlantic Basin LNG market
relative to the US. The demand-supply
balance for LNG will fluctuate between
balanced and short. Atlantic Basin and
Pacific Basin LNG markets will compete
for available global LNG supplies.
Particular European countries face
some gas surpluses but will resolve
them in the next few years. Europe’s
demand for LNG could become particularly severe if Russia cannot meet its
long-term gas supply obligations with
the 25 European Union member countries in 2006 plus Switzerland (hereafter, EU25+). To overcome Russian
problems, European gas markets would
resort to their positions as dominant
LNG buyers within the Atlantic Basin,
potentially becoming the LNG price setters on a worldwide basis.

1. To stem domestic demand.
2. To provide GazProm with necessary funds to step-up dramatically its
investments in gas exploration and
production in Russia and maintain
and upgrade the vast gas transmission
system.
Although the country has the largest
gas reserves in the world and possesses
a huge gas production potential, it currently extracts 50% of its gas production from fields already in advanced
stages of decline.13
Russia had hoped to import large
quantities of gas at low prices from central Asian republics, Turkmenistan and
Kazakhstan in particular, at least in part
to compensate for Russia’s difficulties
shoring up declining gas production.
Turkmenistan, however, possesses the
largest gas reserves among the central
Asian republics and has started gas-sales
negotiations with China.
Russia could face a gas supply gap of
up to 126 bcm/year by 2010 even under the most optimistic import scenario
for gas deliveries from central Asia with
the supply of 105 bcm/year.14 Increasing internal gas prices, however, to
reflect international levels better could
curtail Russian domestic gas demand
significantly, reducing the predicted
supply gap to manageable levels.
Close observers of the Russian gas
industry agree that GazProm must allow
independent oil and gas producers in
Russia access to its pipeline system and
must pay a reasonable price for such gas
supplies.13 14 This is likely the only way
to remove the predicted gas supply gap
in 2010. Currently some 60-80 bcm
of gas is flared in Russia due largely to
the lack of access to GazProm’s pipeline
system. GazProm must provide clear
price signals to independent oil and gas
producers without delay, however, to
motivate necessary gas developments
and infrastructure investments.
Except for Spain and Portugal, LNG
still represents a small fraction of Europe’s total gas supplies. LNG should in

At present, China’s LNG carrier
ambitions appear to be driven primarily
by politics.
Beijing emphasizes using Chinese
built ships to haul Chinese LNG imports. Chinese officials also obsess over
cracking the market for such “high
value-added” ship types as LNGCs.
These vessels may in fact be no more
profitable to build than VLCCs, bulk carriers, and other simpler ships.6
China’s shipbuilding industry is progressing rapidly. For the next few years,
however, it would make more economic
sense for Chinese shipbuilders to focus
on bulkers, tankers, and container ships
that dominate their orderbooks. China
is already a global oil tanker-building
powerhouse, capturing nearly a third
of new global VLCC orders in 2006.7
Yet oil tankers are relatively simple to
construct, while LNG carriers are one of
the most complex civilian ship types.
Shanghai Waigaoqiao and Dalian
New Heavy Ship Industry Co. are now
globally ranked as Nos. 8 and 9, respectively, most-competitive yards.8 Yet
their economic competitiveness is most
pronounced in these simple to midcomplexity ship types. With respect to
specialty vessels, Chinese builders may
find readier markets in the near term
for chemical and LPG tankers, rather
than LNG carriers.
Table 2 shows key differences between building oil and LNG tankers.

In interviews, ship operators said that
within 3-4 years, they would consider
purchasing Chinese made LNG carriers.5

Chinese yards are working hard to
gain LNG shipbuilding capacity relative to foreign competitors. They are
actively seeking joint ventures in order
to acquire foreign capital and technology. These JVs will operate under the
principle that China “should cooperate
with foreign companies, but also must
control and preserve a large national
stake.”9
At present, China’s main LNGC
building yard, Jiangnan Hudong, is a
partner with French builder Chantiers
de l’Atlantique (now owned by Aker
Kvaerner of Norway).10 Chantiers may
see the Chinese market as a last chance
to profit from LNG tanker construction since South Korean and Japanese
LNG builders have pushed Chantiers
and other European shipbuilders almost
completely out of that business.
China can rapidly assimilate technologies gained through JVs. When
Australian firm INCAT first provided
wave-piercing catamaran vessels to

Hong Kong firm AFAI in 1994, the
Australians believed that the Chinese
would be unable to reverse-engineer
the highly complex catamaran. Yet in
April 2004, China launched the Type
2208 Houbei missile boat, which drew
heavily on the Australian wave- piercing
catamaran design.
On the economic front, Chinese
analysts believe that building LNG
carriers and other “complex” ships
will promote the growth of China’s
shipbuilding industry and note that
constructing both crude oil and LNG
tankers involves iron and steel production, metallurgy, electronics, shipbuilding, and harbor construction.11 LNG
carrier construction draws on many of
the same industries as oil tanker building, where building one 300,000-dwt
VLCC can create up to 6 million man-hr
of employment.12
LNG carriers are more complex than
VLCCs and would likely require substantially more man-hr/dwt to build.

KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OIL & LNG TANKERS*

Table 2

Oil tankers

LNG carriers

Oil tankers relatively simple to build.
Less need for tech transfer. Chinese oil market initially served largely by
foreign shippers. Now a strong push to increase share of “nationally
hauled” oil imports.
Oil tanker sector already experiences signiﬁcant demands for replacement
tonnage.
Oil tankers are often built speculatively.

LNG carriers more complex.
Strong desire for JVs and tech transfer.
Chinese market initially served by Chinese shippers.
LNG ships are long lived and demand comes in “spurts.” There is not yet a
serious call for replacement tonnage.
LNG carriers are typically built for speciﬁc projects.

*In China, both types of tankers are built under the political banner of “improving energy supply security” but in reality are being constructed largely for commercial gain.

may be able to secure a larger share of

the current fleet near the end of their

tonnage will create opportunities for
Chinese LNGC builders.
Chinese ship designers and engineers are now researching 200,000-cu
m class LNG carriers as well as LNG
tank design, techniques for welding
low-temperature metals, and flex-fuel
engines such as those featured on new
Q-Flex and Q-Max vessels.19
Chinese yards do not need LNG carrier orders to stay in business, as they
are already very busy building tankers,
bulk carriers, and other less complex
ship types for which they enjoy greater
international competitiveness.
Although building complex ships
will play an important role in China’s
shipbuilding strategy in coming years,
it appears that China’s current desire to
build LNG carriers is driven by politics rather than inherent competitive
advantages. Tankers, bulk carriers, and
other less complex ships will dominate
Chinese ship production for at least 2
years to come (Fig. 3).

2. Hold tight on the higher price, do

Certainly, Qatar can do both. We
believe the first strategy will be chosen
and Qatar will have to compromise and
lower prices. Of course, what happens to HH makes a difference. If HH
goes to $4-5/MMbtu, buyers may not
buy into even the first strategy, but at
$6-7/MMbtu HH, these prices will be
acceptable.

Some people argue that Qatari exports into the US will comprise a small
portion (3-7%) of consumption, making little impact on the price. According to the economic theory, prices are
determined at the margin. Therefore,
we believe imports will have an impact

Although HH prices are likely to
be fall as a result of new imports from
Qatari supertrains, it is impossible to
say by how much. Clearly the impact on
NBP, where 17% of consumption will
be imported, is much higher than HH.
Another imponderable is the US gassupply situation and its impact on price.

Petroleum Council believe production

Recent forecasts of natural gas demand growth and LNG’s role in it confirm the growing importance of LNG
trade. And a review of world activity
shows that steady growth in plants and
terminals is a response to that growth.

Trends

increase 2.5%/year from 2,784 bcm
(97 tcf) in 2004 to 3,643 bcm (128.5
tcf) in 2015, with the largest volumetric increases in the Middle East and
developing Asia. Gas’s share of global
primary energy will remain at 21%.
The IEA scaled down its gas demand
projections from last year because of
higher assumptions about gas prices
that will create an incentive to use coal
in power generation.
As a result of massive investments
in LNG projects, LNG’s share of global
gas demand is to grow to 10-12% by
2015 from 6% in 2004. In countries of
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, LNG’s share
could rise to 17-22% from 11%, while
North America’s dependence could
increase to 10-12% from 6%, assuming a modest increase in domestic
production.
Finally, in its Annual Energy Outlook
Reference Case (April 2007), the US
Energy Information Administration
forecasts that LNG imports will meet
much of the increased US demand for
natural gas over the next 2 decades as
Canadian imports decline. Total net US
imports are to grow to 4.5 tcf in 2030
from 0.6 tcf in 2005, 0.2 tcf higher
than in the 2006 report.

Cedigaz, the French natural gas
information agency, reported in April
that world-marketed production rose
2.9% to 2.93 trillion cu m (103.4
tcf) in 2006, compared with a 2.1%
increase in 2005. North American
production rose 2.3% to 26.6 billion
cu m (26.6 tcf) last year. Table 1 shows
Cedigaz’s preliminary estimates.
World gas trade rose only 2.5% to
886 bcm in 2006, compared with a
5.4%/year average growth rate over
the past decade, because of stagnating pipeline exports. LNG exports,
however, surged 11.7% to 211 bcm,
compared with an average increase of
7.7%/year over the past 10 years.

Earlier this year, Qatar surpassed
Indonesia as the world’s leading LNG
producer and exporter. In March, RasGas stated that Qatar’s vast North field
would likely produce 25 bcfd by 2012,
compared to then current 7 bcfd.
Qatar will soon account for 30% of
the total LNG production in the world,
said a RasGas director. RasGas accounts
for 21 million tpy out of the 30 million
tpy produced by Qatar, and by 2009, it
will be producing 37 million tpy.
Also in March Qatar Petroleum and
Exxon Mobil Corp. observed completion of RasGas Train 5. RasGas Co. Ltd.
is a joint venture of Qatar Petroleum
and ExxonMobil RasGas Inc.
RasGas Train 5, one of the largest
LNG plants in the world, was completed ahead of schedule in just 29 months
and under budget, said the company.
Train 5 will produce 4.7 million tpy
and supply gas into the northern European market.
RasGas operates five trains in Ras
Laffan. In addition, RasGas is building
the world’s largest trains: Trains 6 and
7, each with capacity to produce 7.8
million tpy and expected to start up in
2008 and 2009.

Elsewhere in the Far East, Russian
gas monopoly OAO Gazprom in April
formally took control of Sakhalin-2 oil
and gas development. A $19.4 billion
budget for the second stage of the
project was approved.
As part of an agreement reached late
last year between Gazprom and Royal
Dutch Shell PLC, the Russian company
took a 50%-plus-one-share stake in
project operator Sakhalin Energy in
exchange for $7.45 billion in cash. As
a result, Shell’s stake was halved—to
27.5%—along with the holdings of
Japanese companies Mitsui & Co. and
Mitsubishi Corp., which now own
12.5% and 10%, respectively.
The four companies also yesterday
approved a new budget of $19.4 billion covering the second stage of the
Sakhalin-2 project, which runs until
2014. LNG production at Sakhalin will
begin in 2008. LNG

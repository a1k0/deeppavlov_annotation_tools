Two tugs start the gas processing platform of the Independence
Hub on its route to installation in 8,000 ft of water on Mississippi Canyon Block 920, the deepest water depth of any offshore
platform in the Gulf of Mexico.With Anadarko Petroleum Corp.
as operator, the hub also has the largest gas production capacity
in the gulf at 1 bcfd, representing a 10% increase in current gas
deliveries from those waters. Above, workers assemble the Neptune
SeaStar monocolumn tension-leg platform hull in the Signal
International LLC dry dock yard, Port Arthur,Tex. BHP Billiton
Petroleum (Americas) Inc., operator, launched the hull for the
Neptune TLP in late May for installation in 4,250 ft, above the
Sigsbee escarpment.The US gulf is one of three regions—including
the North Sea and South China Sea—that together are expected
to receive half of total offshore spending through 2011. Oil
production from the gulf is expected to increase to “a possible high”
of 2.1 million b/d over the next 10 years. Conventional drilling for gas on the Outer Continental Shelf
faces stiff competition from other gas-producing areas. But deep water and deep drilling are still attracting
a special group of producers with the skills and technologies to tackle those challenges. Read OGJ’s exclusive report beginning on p. 20. Cover photo from Anadarko. Above photo from BHP.

What is
reliability worth?
Overcoming
flow-convergence issues
with maximum
near-wellbore
conductivity.

Industry Challenge
• Improve sustained production
• Consistently create fractures in cased and cemented horizontal wellbores
• Optimize frac design
• Overcome flow-convergence issues, especially in near-wellbore region
Halliburton Solution
CobraMax® H fracturing service (with Hydra-JetSM service through coiled
tubing for perforating) uses a proppant pack as the final stage of each
fracture treatment. Major benefits include:
• Performing multiple-interval treatments individually
• Eliminating the need for packers or separate trips in the hole
• Providing diversion for successive treatments up the hole
Operator Benefit
Halliburton’s CobraMax H service achieved maximum conductivity in the
near-wellbore region. With this service, risk was lowered and completion
costs per BOE reduced (up to 50% lower when compared with
conventionally fractured horizontal wells).
To learn more about how Halliburton puts reliability in action,

Norway plans $17.6 billion budget for NCS
Norway expects operators will spend $17.6 billion on the Norwegian Continental Shelf in 2007, according to the revised 2007
national budget published by Norway’s petroleum ministry. The
sum is $2.2 billion higher than the last estimate in its national
budget for 2007.
The ministry said investment is expected to rise over coming
years and attributed the difference to escalating well costs. Production and exploration wells as well as average well costs have all
increased since the 2007 national budget was published, it added.
Average Norwegian oil prices are expected to be $61/bbl for
2007 and $58/bbl for 2008 under its revised national budget. The
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has reduced its
production twice in the last 6 months, and the cartel appears to be
aiming for a price of $55-60/bbl, the ministry said.
According to the revised budget, Norwegian oil production,
including natural gas liquids, is expected to be 2.6 million b/d
in 2007, which would be “slightly lower than the production
in 2006,” the ministry said. However, production should rise in
2008, although the ministry did not indicate by how much, and
this would gradually trail off in the following years.
The ministry also has reduced slightly its figures for gas sales.
Norway should sell 93 billion cu m in 2007 and 109 billion cu m
in 2008. Gas sales should increase once production from delayed
projects comes on stream after 2008.
Odd Roger Enoksen, Norway’s minister of petroleum and energy, said Norway is expected to sell more than 90 billion cu m of
gas to Europe in 2007.
The ministry estimates that the state’s net cash flow from the
petroleum sector will be $49.9 billion in 2007, down $10 billion
compared with the original estimate in the 2007 national budget.
The reduction is the result of reduced oil price estimates, lower
production, increased investments, and a rise in operating costs.
The revised budget, presented to Norway’s parliament The Storting on May 15, outlines the government’s plan to implement economic policy and projections for the revised Norwegian economy.

Group to implement LNG training standards
The US Maritime Administration (USMA), seafaring unions,
and seafaring academies agreed June 5 to implement training standards for LNG tanker crews.
“The mariners who meet these standards will be the best in
the world. They’re the ones companies will want to hire,” USMA
administrator Sean T. Connaughton said.
The US once led LNG maritime training worldwide, but that
leadership has lapsed, Connaughton said. US standardized training
from the Merchant Marine Academy and other academies will help

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

regain that leadership, he said.
The memorandum of understanding will be submitted to the
US Coast Guard’s advisory committee on merchant marine issues.
Maritime academies and labor-based training facilities plan to
adopt the standards.
USMA will encourage more US mariners to join LNG tanker
crews.
The new US standards also will be submitted to the International Maritime Organization in London for proposed implementation
worldwide, Connaughton said.
“We’ve come up with a curriculum above and beyond what’s
being offered internationally,” Connaughton said.
Some maritime academies, including the Texas A&M Maritime
Academy in Galveston, Tex., already were working to improving
LNG mariner training programs when the standards group was
assembled.
Chester Urban, a deck department adjunct instructor in LNG
programs at the RTM STAR (Simulation, Training, Assessment &
Research) Center in Dania Beach, Fla., said certified US mariners
will be able to work on modifications to qualify themselves for
LNG tanker duty. “There will be different levels. It will be up to the
individual,” Urban explained.
Connaughton said two carriers active in LNG maritime transportation, Teekay Shipping Corp. and Excelerate Energy LLC, agreed
to ultimately staff at least 25% of their LNG crews with US mariners. Others will be announced shortly, he indicated.

California Geysers geothermal expansion set
Calpine Corp., San Jose, Calif., plans a 2-year multirig drilling
program to increase electricity production by as much as 80 Mw at
its Geysers geothermal operation in northern California.
The $200 million program is designed to expand dry steam
production, identify new sources of geothermal power, and rebuild four older geothermal turbines to improve energy efficiency.
Some of the new wells will be as deep as 11,000 ft.
The company said it will consider further development at Geysers Geothermal field if it is able to enter into long-term power
sales contracts.
The field has 350 steam wells and 58 injection wells on 40 sq
miles with 80 miles of steam lines. The operation, first drilled in
1954, is in the Mayacamas Mountains near Middletown, 70 miles
north of San Francisco.
Calpine, which also operates gas-fired electric generating facilities, supports a state goal of obtaining 20% of its power from renewable sources by 2010.
Geysers, the world’s largest geothermal operation, generates
725 Mw of electricity and represents 25% of California’s renewable energy production and 40% of US geothermal electrical gen-

Development

Barnett play moves far south of Fort Worth
Operators are finding apparently commercial volumes of gas
in the Mississippian Barnett shale as far as 100 miles south of Fort
Worth.
Considerable drilling is taking place near Waco in Hill County
55 miles south of Fort Worth, and leasing and drilling are under
way in Hamilton, Comanche, and even Lampasas counties 100
miles south of Fort Worth, according to a presentation by Westside
Energy Corp., Dallas.
Operators are completing Barnett gas wells in Hill County,
which had no commercial production for years. The county now
has at least several dozen wells permitted, most of which are to be
horizontal penetrations.
Operators working in Hill County include EOG Resources Inc.,
Devon Energy Corp., DTE Gas Resources, JW Operating Co., EnCana Corp., Quicksilver Resources Inc., a joint venture of Westside
and Forest Oil Corp., and several others.
Westside and Forest this month are drilling the horizontal section of a third Hill County well, Primula 2H. The second well, Ellison Estate 1H, tested at an initial 1.9 MMcfd of gas on a 40⁄64-in.
choke while returning completion fluid.
The companies’ first well, Primula 1H, gauged 2.1 MMcfd from
a 1,600-ft lateral in February.
Since mid-2006, various operators have reported initial potentials of 1.5-3.2 MMcfd from Hill County Barnett horizontal
completions. Westside’s economic assumptions are completed well
costs of $3 million and estimated ultimate recoveries of 2 bcf/well
on 60-acre spacing at $5/Mcf.
Meanwhile, Westside has accumulated 52,000 net acres west of
Waco in Comanche, Mills, Hamilton, Coryell, and Lampasas counties. Marathon Oil Corp. has completed one vertical and six horizontal wells in Hamilton County and has built a pipeline, Westside
said. The Barnett shale is 130-220 ft thick at 4,500 ft in these areas.

Norway okays Statoil’s Gjøa ﬁeld development
Norway has approved Statoil ASA’s development and operation
plan for Gjøa oil and gas field in the North Sea, bringing it a step
closer to fruition. Statoil and partners must secure a final approval
from the Norwegian parliament this summer before they can develop Gjøa using subsea templates tied back to a semisubmersible
rig.
Kjetel Digre, leader of the Gjøa project at Statoil, said the planned
development “allows flexibility with regard to the possibility of
new recoverable finds in the area.... The development of the Hydrooperated Vega field can now be implemented in a profitable way.”
The small Hydro-operated condensate and gas fields Vega and Vega
South are to be tied back to the Gjøa platform, which otherwise,
developed by themselves would not be economic.
The chosen development concept ties in the three Norsk Hy8

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

dro AS-operated oil and gas deposits—Camilla, Belinda, and Fram
B—to Gjøa. Production is expected to start in 2010 and the investment will cost 27 billion kroner in 2006 money.
The Gjøa field, proven in 1989, lies 70 km north of Troll oil
field on Blocks 35/9 and 36/7. The reserves are estimated at 60
million bbl of oil and condensate and 35 billion cu m of gas. The
gas will be sent through the UK pipeline Flags to St. Fergus, Scotland. The oil will be piped to the Troll II line and further to the
Statoil-operated 200,000 b/cd Mongstad refinery north of Bergen.
Digre said: “Gjøa oil is of good quality and will be important for
future supply of raw materials to the Mongstad refinery.”
He added that the company has demonstrated that it can be
profitable to use onshore power to meet Gjøa’s power needs on
the platform. “With power from land, we will be able to remove
up to five gas turbines which otherwise would generate platform
electricity. Hence we avoid large carbon and nitrogen oxide emissions.”
The electricity generation license application is now being considered by the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE). “Plans call for coordinated electricity generation from
the Mongstad energy project (EVM). A combined heat and power
(CHP) station at Mongstad, north of Bergen, will come into operation in 2010,” Statoil said. Statoil is development operator with Gaz
de France as production operator.
Interests in the Gjøa license are Gaz de France 30%, Petoro SA
30%, Statoil 20%, Royal Dutch Shell PLC 12%, and RWE Dea AG
8%.

Talisman lets engineering contract for Yme ﬁeld
Talisman Energy Inc., operator of Yme field, let a €110 million,
turnkey contract to Technip on behalf of its consortium members
to undertake engineering work for the redevelopment of the Norwegian North Sea field.
Technip will design, procure, fabricate, and install 36 km of
production, water injection, and service-rigid flow lines. It also
will install umbilicals, spools, subsea protection structures, and a
manifold. The contract also covers tie-in, trenching, rock dumping,
and precommissioning of the field.
Technip’s Apache pipelay vessel will install the flow lines along
with other vessels in the company. Offshore installation is scheduled for 2008 and 2009.
Norway approved the plan for development of Yme field earlier
this year (OGJ Online, May 14, 2007). The partners will drill 12
production and injection wells, install a production platform to
process oil and gas, and establish water injection facilities. First
production is planned for 2009 with expected maximum gross
production of 40,000 b/d of oil.
Talisman holds a 70% stake in the PL 316 license that includes
the Yme field. Revus Energy ASA has 20% and Pertra ASA has 10%.

Rosneft to increase reﬁning capacities, M&As
Russia’s OAO Rosneft plans to increase its refining capacities
eightfold during 2006-15 to bolster its downstream development, said Chairman and Chief Executive Sergei Bogdanchikov
at the Energy Exchange’s CIS Oil & Gas Summit in Paris May 30June 1.
Bogdanchikov said Rosneft would increase its refining capacity
in both Russia and abroad through either acquisitions or partnerships, with preference given to acquisitions abroad, particularly in
the Far East.
Rosneft, which is 75% state-owned, is emerging as “a superNOC” from its current national oil company status, Bogdanchikov
said.
It already has access to “policy-makers,” mergers and acquisitions, and resources. It also cooperates with the government and is
insulated from political risk, he said.
As a supermajor it can now boast “capital discipline, cost efficiency, shareholder value creation, enhanced corporate gover-

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
nance, and transparency,” he said. He detailed the group’s shareholder base as the Russian State, institutional investors from over
40 countries, about 150,000 ordinary Russian citizens, NOCs, and
other supermajors.
Pointing out that Rosneft was sharing experience and technology with leading service companies and is engaged in cooperation
with leading oil and gas companies through which it is “implementing the best technology,” as well as sharing experience, risks,
and investments, Bogdanchikov said the group could finance its
projects, including Sakhalin 5, alone but would invite partners for
offshore projects “to deal with their complexity.”
He also said summit sponsor Total SA might “soon” share involvement in Rosneft projects.

BG Group to supply gas to Chile LNG terminal
BG Group has signed an agreement to supply Chile’s first LNG
regasification terminal, a 2.5 million tonne/year facility to be built
in Quintero Bay, about 110 km northwest of Santiago. The terminal
is slated to begin operating in second quarter 2009.
The terminal could meet as much as 40% of Chile’s gas demand, organizers said. GNL Quintero SA (GNLQ) will own and
operate the terminal. BG is a 40% shareholder in GNLQ. Other
partners, each with a 20% stake, are Chilean state company ENAP,
power company Endesa Chile, and gas distributor Metrogas.
BG executed the 21-year LNG sale and purchase agreement to
supply Chile with 1.7 million tonnes/year of LNG through the terminal, to be supplied from the company’s global LNG portfolio.
ENAP said the LNG project will cost $400 million and, once
commissioned, will supply gas to the country at competitive prices. It said the Quintero LNG complex will comprise a quay about
1,300 m long, unloading arms, and two storage tanks of around
160,000 cu m capacity each, in addition to the regasification station.
GNLQ also announced it let engineering, procurement, and
construction contracts valued at $775 million to CB&I of The
Woodlands, Tex.

Short-term deals to get 10% of Fos Cavaou LNG
The Fos Cavaou LNG terminal in southeastern France will have
to free 10% of its 8.25 billion cu m/year capacity for short-term
contracts when it comes into operation beginning in 2008. The
Energy Regulatory Commission on May 16 issued the notice to Société du Terminal Méthanier de Fos Cavaou, the company that will
operate the terminal on behalf of its owners Gaz de France 69.7%
and Total 30.3%.
The move is in line with the commission’s policy to bolster
competition in southern France, which lacks gas supply sources. In
addition, access to GDF’s and Total’s gas lines remains “uncertain”
over the 2008-11 period, the commission said. It also indicated
that the current gas release program will gradually end over 2008.
Decisions for the development of interconnections with Spain
are still pending, so it is necessary to allocate the full available capacities of the Fos Cavaou terminal to boost competition for final
consumers in southern France.
The 10% spare capacity will be for 3-year, short-term contracts
involving 10 Tw-hr/year, equal to 825 million cu m. The tariff,
10

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

suggests the commission, should be the same as that of existing
terminals—about €1.3/Mw-hr over 2008-11.
The commission also indicates that annual operating costs for
Fos-Cavaou will average €38 million over the period, while costs
engaged until the terminals comes on stream are estimated by the
operating company at around €11 million. Full cost of the terminal
up to the time it comes on stream should be about €588 million.

Abu Dhabi lets pipeline contract to CNPC units
China National Petroleum Corp. said Abu Dhabi’s International
Petroleum Investment Co. has awarded a contract to CNPC’s two
pipeline engineering and construction units, China Petroleum
Pipeline Bureau and China Petroleum Engineering & Construction
Corp., to jointly build a 360-km, 48-in. oil pipeline in the UAE.
The pipeline will extend from Abu Dhabi’s Habshan oil field to an
export terminal at Fujairah. Starting and completion dates were
not given.
The line will carry 1.5 million b/d of crude oil, about 55% of
the Emirates’ production. A third of the crude will be transported
to a planned $5 billion refinery in Fujairah, while the remainder
would be piped to the export terminal, bypassing the Strait of Hormuz.
Under an original 2006 agreement, IPIC and ConocoPhillips
were expected to form a 51-49 joint venture to own and operate
the 500,000 b/d Fujairah refinery complex (OGJ, July 24, 2006,
Newsletter). In April, however, ConocoPhillips said rising costs had
cast doubts on its participation in the refinery, so IPIC last month
said it would revise its plan for the refinery. ✦

Corrections
In the special report on managing carbon dioxide, API’s
SANGEA Energy and Emissions Estimating System was developed originally by Chevron Corp. with the assistance of
staff currently with Battelle (OGJ, May 14, 2007, p. 27).
In the special report on OPEC’s new direction, a map of
2005 US gas imports and exports contained a misspelling
of the Sabine Pass LNG receiving terminal (OGJ, May 28,
2007, p. 26).

Speaking journally...

Steven Poruban
Senior Editor

historical perspective gained by leafing through past journals and reading
the various dated entries. This is where
certain questions find their answers:
What was happening 5 years ago in the
oil and gas industry that was making
headlines? Who was being interviewed
and why? Which story ideas never made
it to fruition? Which ideas did?
After recently rereading parts of
these journals, certain entries stood
out from others. One entry in particular jarred this editor’s nerves and with
them, some horrible memories. The
date was Sept. 11, 2001, and the event
was the succession of terrorist attacks
on New York and Washington, DC.

It has been this OGJ editor’s habit—
well, at least since Jan. 10, 2001—to
keep a journal at work. The practice
began as a way to avoid misplacing important work-related information.
Before that date, vital data such as
contacts’ phone numbers, story ideas,
print deadlines, and notes from staff
meetings and interviews were
written on anything handy. And
since this information always
attached itself to scrap pieces of
paper or on pages of countless
notepads, it was easily lost and,
dare say, most times forgotten.
The mounting organizational
challenge led to a decision to

what’s most interesting about this
will be affected by attacks. Taking any
method of record-keeping is the

Upon making the call to London
and asking my questions—armed with
nothing but a sick, hopeless feeling in
the pit of my stomach—I recall being
told in the nicest way possible that how
the attacks would affect oil markets
was “the furthest thing” from the
then-International Petroleum Exchange
president’s mind.
I came away with nothing to contribute to the online story that day
and remember leaving work feeling
exhausted, emotionally and mentally.
Looking back, this writer finds it amazing that all of these vivid memories
come flooding back from a single note
in a journal.

Other entries
Other entries, although not
carrying quite the same emotional weight, are poignant.
These entries range from
the pragmatic—“Jan. 18,
2001: Need to call Colo. Attn.
Gen. office for photo of Gale
Norton” (US secretary of the
interior during 2001-06) and
“Feb. 8, 2001: Start contacting analysts
about 4Q/2000 earnings”—to the
inquisitive—“Sept. 12, 2003: Ongoing
story...How can US gas producers turn
around production decline?”
These journals serve as a record—albeit a personal one—for industry
events. For example, turn to the notes
taken during the first week of May of
every year and read the last 7 years of
speaker coverage during the Offshore
Technology Conference held every year
in Houston at that time.
One of the most satisfying aspects
of keeping a work journal, however, is
crossing things off “to do” lists. Prime
example: “June 6, 2007: Finish writing
journally speaking for June 11 issue.”

Policy by the numbers
The making of energy and environmental policy has become a contest of numbers. Governments
set measurable targets to boost consumption of
fuels they like and to cut use of fuels they don’t.
They mandate reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases. They set goals for energy efficiency,
variously defined. If based on careful analysis, the
numbers to which governments commit their
countries might yield sound policy. Usually, however, they just ooze out of politics.
Policy-making by the numbers comes naturally
in the age of modern management, fundamental
to which are the careful setting and vigorous pursuit of quantitative goals. The managerial perspective so strongly affects industrial-world thinking,
in fact, that government programs tend not to be
taken seriously unless latticed with numerical targets and deadlines. Governments, inclined as they
are to govern, relish the business-school maxim at
the core of systematic goal-setting: Whatever can
be measured can be managed. With minor variation, this becomes a license for activism: What a
government measures it inevitably tries to manage.

Pick a number
There’s nothing inherently wrong with governmental goal-setting. The technique can be as
effective in governance as it is in the management
of businesses. But it has to be used effectively. It’s
not enough to just pick a number and call it law.
Yet arbitrary goal-setting has reemerged as a
standard feature of energy and environmental
policy-making. In politics, moreover, goals have
become bargaining chips.
The US ethanol mandate is an example. The
Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandated that 7.5 billion gal/year of ethanol be sold as fuel by 2012.
This year President George W. Bush proposed that
the requirement climb to 35 billion gal/year by
2017. This, he said, would serve his ambition to
reduce gasoline use by 20% in 10 years in order to
increase energy security and reduce emissions of
greenhouse gases.
Can the US produce that much ethanol at reasonable cost? Would achieving the ethanol targets
really deliver the supposed gasoline savings? What
is special about a 20% reduction in gasoline consumption? How much economic growth might
the country have to forgo to hit the target? How,

in a free-market economy, does the government
enforce volumetric sales mandates? Policy-making
by the numbers evades questions like these.
In any event, final US ethanol targets will be
determined by political deals in an election season.
Enforcement will fall to federal agencies able to do
little more than prorate mandated volumes over
fuel suppliers against best guesses about future
consumption. Grain and fuel prices will continue
to climb.
This process is not uniquely American. The European Union seeks to replace 10% of the gasoline
used in its member countries with biofuels by
2020. While the target isn’t as aggressive as Bush’s,
it forces governments to act. And that, of course,
is the point: action for the sake of governmental
action, even if it’s ill-considered and compelled by
baseless numbers.
Responses to climate change slog through
similar mire. That most early supporters of the
Kyoto Protocol won’t achieve their initial goals
for greenhouse-gas emissions says something
about validity of the goals if not about the whole
approach. Yet Kyoto fans already are pushing for
tougher standards in the next round of targets.
Before last week’s meeting of the G8 nations
in Germany, Bush proposed that the world’s 15
largest sources of greenhouse gases set long-term
targets for emission reductions. His step toward
goal-setting in this area represented a major
change of position. But to leaders of several European countries, it wasn’t enough. It didn’t arrive
with numbers and deadlines already in place. And
it strayed from the United Nations framework
that bred the foundering Kyoto treaty. A fresh
approach, whatever its merits, thus might die
untried in deference to a scheme already shown
not to work.

Managing the unmanageable
In too many energy and environmental issues, political goal-setting has displaced informed
debate. Masquerading as seriousness of purpose, it
makes governments try to manage unmanageable

The US Gulf of Mexico is one of
three regions—including the North Sea
and South China Sea—that together are
expected to receive half of total offshore
spending through 2011.
Total offshore expenditures will
make up “the lion’s share of spending
on the upstream sector” that analysts
at Douglas-Westwood Ltd. forecast will
top $275 billion by 2011, up from
$216 billion in 2006.
Industry observers agree
that expensive deepwater projects are “disproportionately increasing
spending shares” in the
Gulf of Mexico as well
as other hot spots.
Exploration and production capital
expenditures are “on the rise across the
board” despite prospective volatility in
natural gas prices, said analysts in the
Houston office of Raymond James &
Associates Inc. in mid-May.

to a possible high of 8.3 bcfd over the
next 3 years.
“The Gulf of Mexico is one of the
largest single sources of oil and gas supply to the US market,” said Lars Herbst,
acting director of the MMS gulf regional office. “With the continued interest
and activity in the deepwater area of
the gulf, we anticipate that oil and gas
production will continue to be strong
with a large portion of the production
coming from the projects in deeper
water depths.”
Oil production in the gulf increased
steadily during 1991-2001, leveled
off in 2003, and declined in 2004-05,
partly due to damage to offshore and
coastal facilities by Hurricane Ivan in
2004 and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita
in 2005. Shallow-water production declined steadily after 1997 but was offset
by increasing deepwater oil production
during most of that time.
Gas production has followed a
similar trend, but increased deepwater
output didn’t prevent an overall decline
in 2006. MMS officials see gulf production being boosted by 16 new deepwater projects coming on stream by the
end of this year. A major contributor to
the increased gas production will be the
start-up of the Independence Hub facility, through which gas is expected to
start flowing in the second half of 2007

even subsea operations are not totally

added, “Hurricanes and insurance

portion of the gulf.”

Special Report

In 2006, none of the 10 gulf storms,
including five hurricanes, made landfall
on the US Gulf Coast, and the offshore
industry took advantage of that respite
to make improvements to its operations
and procedures, said API Pres. and Chief
Executive Red Cavaney on May 30.
“Our industry’s upstream sector
continued to analyze and apply updated
environmental data on how powerful
storms affect conditions in the gulf,”
Cavaney said. “During the 2004 and
2005 hurricanes, waves were higher
and winds were stronger than anticipated in deeper parts of the gulf.” The revised wind and wave data prompted API
to reassess its recommended practices
(RPs) for gulf operations. It published
three interim documents covering the
operation and construction of both
mobile offshore drilling units and fixed
and floating production platforms.
A second edition of the RP for the
mooring of mobile offshore drilling
units was issued in 2007, incorporating updated data analysis. On May
30, API published three new interim
documents, with final RPs expected
next year. “API is hosting workshops on
these new publications in New Orleans
and Houston this July,” Cavaney said.
To prepare for future severe storms,
pipeline companies have installed onsite backup electric power generation
capability, improved communications
systems to support continued operations, and cooperated with vendors to
preposition food, water, and transportation, as well as plan for other emergencies. ✦

oil and gas industry’s interest in expanding their deepwater operations.”
This article examines the focus
and strategies of the two firms—one
a subsidiary of a national oil company and the other one of the largest
independents in the US—in the Gulf
of Mexico.

Anadarko
Anadarko budgeted $4 billion for
its 2007 capital program and plans to
spend 25% of it in the deepwater Gulf
of Mexico.
In recent years, Anadarko and KerrMcGee Corp. were frequently among
the top firms with the highest number
of accepted high bids in lease sales for
the central and western gulf. Often one
or the other was the only independent
producer listed with various majors
among the top five winning bidders in
such sales. With the merger of Kerr-McGee into Anadarko last year and recent
installation of Independence Hub,
operated by Anadarko, the deep Gulf
of Mexico is a major focal area for the
firm.
“There’s a lot of interest in the gulf.
We’ve had a lot of success there,” said
Darrell Hollek, Anadarko’s vice-president of Gulf of Mexico operations and
development. The company’s large
holdings in the deepwater gulf make it
“easy to continue” with the prospects
of added success.
Anadarko’s other major areas of
operation include onshore US, particularly the Rocky Mountains, which
will get 30% of this year’s budget, and
Algeria. The company also has production in China, a development project
in Brazil, and exploration programs
in several other countries. It has divested some noncore properties in the
Gulf of Mexico and onshore US for a
combined total of $10.5 billion after
income taxes.
“The sale of our offshore assets is
an example of how discoveries can add
significant value quickly,” said Hollek.
“Looking at the business as a whole,
it sometimes makes sense to monetize
26

some assets earlier rather than later. We
remain extremely flexible as to how to
best monetize various assets.”
At the end of 2006, the deepwater
Gulf of Mexico accounted for 13% of
Anadarko’s US reserves, which made up
88% of its total proved reserves of 10.5
tcf of gas and 1.3 billion bbl of crude,
condensate, and NGL. In the deep gulf,
Anadarko owns an average 63% working interest in 777 blocks and has access to an additional 27 blocks through
participation agreements.

operations and
development—
“There’s a lot of
interest in the gulf.
We’ve had a lot of success there.”
Anadarko’s exploration program in
the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico
focuses on the extensive Middle-toLower Miocene play in the foldbelt area
and the developing Lower Tertiary play
near the 2006 Kaskida discovery.
During 2006, Anadarko delineated
the Tonga, Big Foot, and Knotty Head
discoveries and had five additional
discoveries: Kaskida, Power Play, Claymore, Caesar, and Mission Deep. The
company expects to participate in four
to six exploration wells and three to five
delineation wells in the region in 2007.

Independence Hub
Development plans for the gas-processing Independence Hub semisubmersible production platform and a
gas export pipeline in the eastern Gulf
of Mexico were approved in 2004.
Anadarko is operator of the facility, which can process 1 bcfd of gas
from several ultradeepwater gas fields,

including eight Anadarko field discoveries. Initial production will be from 15
wells; Anadarko has an interest in 14 of
those wells. First production is expected
in the second half of this year.
The Independence Hub water
depth exceeds 8,000 ft, deepest of any
offshore platform. The facility’s gasprocessing capacity is the largest in the
gulf. The 20-in. steel catenary riser connecting the production platform to the
Independence Trail gas pipeline ranks as
the largest and deepest such riser ever
installed. Beginning at Independence
Hub on Mississippi Canyon Block
920, Independence Trail is also
the deepest export pipeline
installed to date. The 134-mile,
24-in. pipeline connects with
Tennessee Gas Pipeline on
West Delta Block 68.
Enterprise Field Services LLC
announced Mar. 8 that the Independence Hub semi had been
successfully installed. Independence
Hub LLC, a venture of Enterprise (80%)
and Helix Energy Solutions Group
Inc. (20%), owns the facility. Besides
Anadarko, the producers group includes
Dominion Exploration & Production,
Devon Energy Corp., Hydro Gulf of
Mexico, and Murphy Oil Corp. The
Independence Trail Natural Gas Pipeline
is a wholly owned affiliate of Enterprise
Products Partners LP.

Anadarko’s leases
With 2.7 million net acres, Anadarko
ranks among the gulf’s top leaseholders. Anadarko utilizes a “hub and spoke
infrastructure” while maintaining a
controlling rig position in the Gulf of
Mexico. In the first quarter of this year,
it had five deepwater rigs under its
operation.
Hollek expects the gulf to maintain
its 20-25% share of Anadarko’s total
investment. He sees the deepwater gulf
as “an area where we can make step
changes” in strategy and technology
through the development of ideas that
eventually can be applied in other areas
of the world.

Island, and Mustang Island quadrants
of the western gulf off South Texas,
Petrobras is challenging a paradigm, in
that Lower Tertiary reservoirs that occur
onshore in South Texas and in ultradeep
waters have not been found in the
transitional shallower to deeper waters
(650-2,300 ft) in between.
“We made an evaluation and came
to the conclusion that earlier wells
that were drilled in this area were not
drilled deep enough,” Figueira said.
Other producers “drilled down to a
given depth and found shale or a very
shaley section,” he said. “In general, we
intend to drill deeper than 20,000 ft.
That’s the basic rationale that has driven
the company to invest thereabouts.”
Petrobras has drilled one well in that
general area. “It was not commercial,
but we got some hints that encouraged
ourselves to keep this area in our base
data,” Figueira said.
Petrobras’ third “innovation area are
the ultradeepwater prospects some 180
miles off the Louisiana coast with the
Cascade and Chinook fields along the
Walker Ridge area and the Coulomb
North and St. Malo fields and other
prospects where Petrobras can apply its
deepwater expertise.
There is a fourth area 138 miles off
Texas in the deep central gulf where
in February Petrobras America began
producing from the first well in the
Cottonwood gas-condensate field on
Garden Banks Block 244 in 670 m of
water. It is the first deepwater field outside of Brazil that Petrobras, as operator,
has developed and put into production.
Production began at 40 MMcfd but
soon increased to 70 MMcfd when a
second well came on stream. Figueira
describes that as an “area of continuation.” He said, “Everything we have
to do here is to improve data quality,
particularly seismic, in order to have a
better image of the prospect.”
The gulf shelf areas off Texas and
Louisiana “still need to be proved up,”
Figueira said. But Petrobras has production at Cottonwood and in the ultradeep
water at Coulomb, operated by Shell Oil
Co. Cascade, operated by Petrobras, and
28

St. Malo, operated by Chevron. Those
“are the first flowers we’ve been able to
collect in this huge garden” of the Gulf
of Mexico, Figueira said.
“We at Petrobras realize we have to
look for two or three things in our internationalization process,” Guimaraes
said. “One is that we have developed
some special technologies in the company that differentiate Petrobras among
others. Any big company has some spe-

cialties, some special factors. Petrobras
is not an exception. So in the process of
going abroad we have decided what we
have to do is not be like others but apply those things that make us different
and special.”
Guimaraes said, “The second factor
is to look for areas where we can apply
successfully these technologies and
specialties, and the Gulf of Mexico is
just one of those regions. Right now we
are developing a very good project in
Nigeria where we are positioning ourselves in a very big scale and applying
this same physical syntax.” Moreover,
he said, “We have decided from previous experience that our company for
the size it has, for the capital it applies,
and the type of projects that have been
successful” is not a fit for small scale
projects. “So we have to look for major
projects.”

(FPSO) vessels. The company now is
transferring technology developed in
Brazil to the Gulf of Mexico. “It’s not a
new concept—it has been tested, fully
audited, and proven in Brazil,” Figueira
said.

FPSO for the gulf
At the end of 2006, Petrobras’ plan
for subsea development of Cascade and
Chinook fields was approved by the US
Minerals Management Service, the first
such plan ever to include an FPSO
in the Gulf of Mexico. Petrobras
has used FPSOs extensively in
deep water off Brazil to reduce
infrastructure costs and speed
production to markets. There,
it has 15 FPSOs in operation
and 9 under construction.
In seeking MMS approval
for the first FPSO in the Gulf of
Mexico, Guimaraes cited another
benefit—human and environmental safety. When a hurricane approaches,
an FPSO can easily disconnect, move to
safety, then return and reconnect once
the storm has passed.
For the Cascade-Chinook project,
Petrobras plans to start oil production in
2009 with the help of six technologies
that are, in addition to the FPSO, new
to the US sector of the Gulf of Mexico:
a disconnectable turret buoy that allows the FPSO to move offsite during
bad weather; crude transportation via
shuttle tanker; free-standing hybrid risers; subsea electric submersible pumps;
torpedo pile vertical loaded anchors;
and polyester mooring systems.
The plan calls for installation of an
FPSO in 7,000-9,000 ft of water, with
at least two subsea wells in Cascade
and one subsea well in Chinook, each
drilled to 27,000 ft and tied back to the
FPSO. Based on reservoir performance,
the development plan could be expanded to include additional wells on each
unit. Petrobras is operator with 50% of
Cascade and 66.67% of Chinook. Devon
Energy Corp. owns the remaining 50%
of Cascade, and Total E&P USA Inc.
owns 33.33% of Chinook. ✦

GAO report shows US receives one
of world’s lowest oil, gas revenue takes
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
The US government receives one of
the world’s lowest government takes—
revenue as a percentage of the value of
production—from oil and gas produced
from its lands, the US Government
Accountability Office (GAO) said in a
report issued June 1.
Although increasing oil and gas
royalties on future leases would increase
the US government’s take, the congressional watchdog agency said, it might
also reduce some taxes and other fees
and could discourage some development and production.
GAO issued the report a few days
before Congress was due to return
from its Memorial Day recess to
consider a broad range of oil and
gas-related measures. These include
provisions repealing parts of the 2005
Energy Policy Act, restricting uses of
produced water, limiting federal oil
royalty in-kind payments to Strategic
Petroleum Reserve purchases, making
oil product price manipulation a federal crime, mandating more-efficient
government offices and motor fleets,
increasing biofuel supplies, and bringing other alternative fuels to market
more quickly (OGJ, May 28, 2007, p.
28; June 4, pp. 21, 26, and 28). Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and
other Senate Democrats said May 23
that additional energy legislation could
be considered during 2007.
GAO prepared its report in response
to requests in January from Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee
Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), and
three other US lawmakers. Its analysis
from January through March examined
studies conducted in 2006 that were

Brazil unveils growth program based on oil, gas
Peter Howard Wertheim
OGJ Correspondent
Energy projects included in the
strategic plan of Brazil’s state-owned
Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras)
are underpinning the country’s new
“Program for Accelerated Growth”
(PAC), an economic expansion program outlined recently by the country’s
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva that
is expected to be the lynchpin of his
second term in ofﬁce.
About 65% of PAC’s energy infrastructure projects involve oil and gas,
mostly in the southeastern states. Of
these, 183 are already in Petrobras’s
strategic plan, representing $86 billion
in Brazil-based investment through
2010. These include:
• The Rio de Janeiro State Petrochemical Complex (Comperj), a $10.5

billion project to process 150,000 b/d
of heavy oil to produce diesel, ethane,
propane, benzene, paraxylene, butadiene, polyethylene, polypropylene (PP),
PET, PTA (primary material for making
PET and polyester), ethylene glycol,
and styrene. Construction is expected
to begin in 2008.
• The Abreue Lima reﬁnery in
Pernambuco state, a $5 billion joint
venture with Venezuela’s Petroleos de
Venezuela SA that is expected to break
ground this year and, once online in
2012, to process 200,000 b/d of heavy
oil and produce diesel, coke, naphtha,
liquid petroleum gas, and bunker fuel.
• Two biofuels pipelines—an ethanol
line from Goiás state to São Sebastião,
São Paulo state port, and a line for
both ethanol and biodiesel, to run from
Cuiaba, Mato Grosso, to Paranagua in
Paraná state.

• The gas production anticipation
plan (Plangás), a $12.5 billion investment to increase natural gas production to 40 million cu m by yearend 2008
and to 55 million cu m by yearend 2010.
• New gas pipelines totaling 4,526
km.
• A slate of 120 new biofuels projects over the next 4 years to raise the
country’s ethanol output to 23.3 billion
l. by 2010 and biodiesel production to
3.3 billion l. The projects break down
as follows: ethanol, 77 new plants
producing about 40% more ethanol
than current production; biodiesel,
46 new plants to quadruple current production by 2010; and H-bio, a blend of
vegetable oil and diesel: Petrobras will
invest $71 million in four reﬁneries in
Minas Gerais, São Paulo, Paraná, and
Rio Grande do Sul states.
President Lula made it clear that
the PAC will only become viable with
private sector participation.

The government has proposed cutting carbon emissions by 23-33 million
tonnes by 2020, stressing investment in
new, low-carbon sources. “We want to
lead in the development of carbon capture and storage,” Darling said, adding
that the government would strengthen
the EU Emissions Trading Scheme to
ensure a long-term market price for
carbon.
Darling’s announcement on carbon
capture and storage sounded hollow
when BP PLC revealed on May 23 that
it would drop its carbon capture and

storage project in Peterhead, Scotland,
after the government delayed a competition offering subsidies until November, which BP said was too late for it to
make a final investment decision.
However, it remains questionable
whether energy policy can be fulfilled
if the UK is struggling with a skills
shortage with dwindling numbers of
graduates in science, engineering, and
technical careers.
Louise Kingham, chief executive of
the Energy Institute, said: “A survey car-

ried out last year by the EI revealed potential skills gaps in the energy industry
in the next decade. Increased efforts are
required to assess the problem, share
best practice and knowledge between
regions, and stimulate training activity,
to avoid a skills shortage becoming a
constraint on policy implementation.”
The Energy White Paper was due to
be published in March, but this was delayed after Greenpeace launched a legal
challenge claiming that the government
had not carried out its nuclear consultation process properly. ✦

COMPANY NEWS

Dominion sells assets in deals totaling $6.5 billion
Loews Corp. and XTO Energy Inc.
agreed to buy certain oil and natural gas
producing properties in two separate
deals from Dominion Resources Inc. for
a total of $6.5 billion.
In other recent company news:
• A federal district court in New
Mexico ruled against the US Federal
Trade Commission and set the stage for
Giant Industries Inc. and Western Refining Inc. to merge, the two companies
said in a joint announcement.
• OAO Gazprom will gradually buy
a 50% stake in Belarus state pipeline
company Beltransgaz for $2.5 billion
by 2010, the company said. Beltransgaz
delivers Russian gas to the European
Union and supplies Russian gas within
Belarus.
• Abu Dhabi National Energy Co.
announced plans to buy Northrock
Resources Ltd., a subsidiary of Pogo
Producing Co., for $2 billion. The transaction marks Abu Dhabi National’s entry
into Canada.

Dominion assets bought
Loews, a conglomerate based in
New York, will pay Dominion $4.025
billion for estimated proved reserves of
2.5 tcf of gas. XTO agreed to pay the
Richmond, Va.-based electric and gas
32

utility $2.5 billion for estimated proved
reserves of 1 tcf of gas. The sales are
expected to close in August.
Last year Dominion announced plans
to divest its exploration and production
operations except for 1 tcf of estimated
proved reserves in the Appalachian basin (OGJ Online, Nov. 1, 2006).
Dominion has already offloaded certain assets this year. In April Eni Petroleum Co. Inc. agreed to buy Dominion’s
oil and gas interests in the Gulf of
Mexico for $4.8 billion (OGJ Online,
Apr. 30, 2007). In May Paramount
Energy Trust and Baytex Energy Trust,
both based in Calgary, made plans to
buy Dominion’s Canadian assets in two
separate deals for a total of $583 million (OGJ Online, May 30, 2007).
Loews said it plans to buy Dominion’s operations in the Permian basin
in Texas, the Antrim shale in Michigan,
and the Black Warrior basin in Alabama.
XTO plans to acquire 542,000
net acres of Dominion leases. About
235,000 acres are undeveloped property in the Rocky Mountains, the San Juan
basin, and South Texas. The acquisition
will add 200 MMcfd of gas production.
Dominion also announced a process
to sell its Midcontinent operations,
primarily in Oklahoma, that is sched-

uled to begin in July. As of Dec. 31,
2006, these operations had estimated
proved reserves of 780 bcf and probable
reserves of 435 bcf. Last year’s average
production was 120 MMcfd.
XTO said 64% of the reserves that
it is buying are proved developed and
about 95% are gas.
Anticipated development costs
for proved undeveloped reserves are
$1.50/Mcf, and XTO plans to spend
$200 million on these properties in
2007. The Fort Worth company said it
will operate 70% of these properties.
Bob R. Simpson, XTO chairman and
chief executive officer, said the company increased its production growth
guidance in 2007 to 15%, up from
10% as a result of the acquisition. XTO’s
initial production growth target for
2008 is 15%.
In the Rocky Mountains, XTO is
acquiring 810 bcf of proved reserves
and 326,000 net acres of leaseholds,
primarily in Utah’s Uinta basin. About
60% of that is developed. Net production is 26 MMcfd.
Assets include Natural Buttes gas
field, Drunkards Wash coalbed methane
field, and properties in the San Juan
basin. XTO also is gaining entry into
Jonah field in Wyoming.

PERSONNEL MOVES AND PROMOTIONS

BP Reﬁning names R&M chief executive
BP PLC has appointed Iain Conn
chief executive of BP’s reﬁning and
marketing business, effective June 1.
He succeeds John Manzoni, who will
retire Aug. 31 after 24 years of service.
Conn will retain regional responsibility for Europe, Southern Africa, and
Asia Paciﬁc.
Prior to his appointment, he served
as an executive director of BP with
functional responsibility for safety and
operations, technology, marketing,
human resources, information technology, procurement, and supply chain
management. He had regional responsibility for Europe, Africa, Middle East,
Russia, the Caspian Sea area, and
Asia-Paciﬁc.
He has several years of reﬁning and
marketing experience, the most recent
from 2000-02 when he was responsible for marketing operations in Europe
and for the integration of Veba Oel into
BP. He was named chief executive of
BP’s petrochemicals business in 2002.

In south Texas, XTO is acquiring 250
bcf of proved reserves and 216,000 net
acres of leasehold, of which 50% is developed. Net production is 74 MMcfd.
Production is primarily derived from
the Wilcox Trend. The acquisition also
provides production in the Frio and
Vicksburg sand formations along the
Gulf Coast.

Conn joined BP in 1986 and has held
various positions in exploration and
production and oil trading.

Other moves
Whiting Petroleum Corp., Denver,
has promoted several members of its
operations team.
The company named James T.

lows a major proposal agreed by Russia,
Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan more
than a week ago to expand oil deliveries out of Central Asia via Russia, which
has threatened plans by western governments to develop alternative supply
routes outside of Russia (OGJ Online,
May 14, 2007).
Beltransgaz must hold a meeting to
elect a supervisory company after it has
transferred the first 12.5% of the company to Gazprom.
Underpinning this agreement is the
companies’ pledge in December 2006
to set up a joint gas transmission venture to supply and transport gas across
Belarus. In 2007 Gazprom will supply
21.8 billion cu m of gas to Belarus for
$100/million cu m. The rise in prices
to market rates for Belarus has seriously
strained relations between the two
countries and in turn, affected oil and
gas supplies to Europe, prompting fears
there about Russia as a reliable energy
supplier.

ADNEC to buy Northrock
Abu Dhabi National’s acquisition of
Northrock is expected to close during
the third quarter, pending regulatory
approvals.
Based in Calgary, Northrock has operations in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and
the Northwest Territories. It currently
produces 29,000 boe/d. For yearend
2006, Northrock reported estimated
proved reserves of 706 bcf of gas
equivalent.
Northrock’s production is 51% oil
and its reserves are 55% oil, said Pogo.
The Houston company is in the process
of selling its noncore assets. Pogo said it
is continuing to explore strategic alternatives, which could include a possible
sale of the company.
Pogo acquired Northrock from
Unocal Corp. for $1.8 billion in 2005
(OGJ, July 18, 2005, p. 30).

DOMAINS—2

& DEVE

This second of four parts on the formation and potential of the structured
belt of the Western Canada Sedimentary
basin begins with discussion of how the
structures formed.
The belt mainly includes rocks of
sedimentary origin in sequences of
hard and soft layers of varying thicknesses. Mechanical properties of individual layers and of the entire package
determine how
the sequence
will deform
under specific
stress conditions.
Stress causes
deformation,
and structures are born. Stress results in
translation (displacement along faults),
rotation (formation of folds), and strain
(shape change). Each structure might
be expressed by two 3D ellipsoids—
stress and strain.
The first includes three active forces:
sigma 1, 2, and 3, directed along x, y,
or z axes and pointing to the intersection point of the three axes. When each
of these forces is not opposed by an
equal force, deformation (translation,
folding, and strain) occurs.

The force sigma 1 is always the maximum force, sigma 2 the intermediate
force, and sigma 3 the minimum force.
The result of these three acting forces
is strain, which might be represented
by a second 3D ellipsoid. It shows the
most likely shape changes (volumetric
or distortional), including faults, folds,
and fractures associated with the stress
ellipsoid.
Strain is a function of the mechanical properties of rocks: Elastic, viscous,
or plastic, respectively, signifying: No
permanent deformation, permanent
deformation, and stress-determined
permanent deformation. These two
ellipsoids more often than not do not
have the same x, y, and z axes.

Fractures
Both 3D stress and strain ellipsoids
define specific natural zones of mechanical failure, rock fractures, and faults in
rocks subjected to stress (Figs. 8 and 9).
These zones are many: Fractures
(Andersonian descriptive modes 1,
2, 3, and antimode 1, Fig. 10), joints,
(master, cross, strike parallel, crossstrike, contained, pinnate, and tail),
faults, fault zones, deformation bands,

strike-slip faults in the E, including
those penetrating upward from within
the basement and others, vertical and
striking parallel to the basement ones,
and confined to the sedimentary section, normal faults, squeeze faults,
horizontal shear faults, and associated
flower folds (see seismic transects ST
1-15 in Part 3).
There are also extension fractures
(movement perpendicular to fracture surface), and shear fractures
(movement parallel to fracture surface). Fractures and faults form when
stresses exceed rock fracture strength
and displacements range from macroscopic to microscopic. Historically,
it was thought that fracture strength
depended on lithology and overburden
pressure.
To date, it is known that the overburden pressure is only one component of
many that form fractures, such as pore
pressure, stress dissolutions, chemical
changes, rock mineralogy, and grain
size, to name a few.
When available cores are not studied and the position of stylolites in the
cores is not determined, one will be
hard pressed to know what the actual
orientations of stress ellipsoids and
their three sigma stresses were. This
means it is impossible to form an opinion on the 3D position of the strain ellipsoid and its three fracture directions.
Ergo, one cannot predict the locations
of fractures or where to drill a structure
to intersect open fractures.

Thrusts
In the structured belt, thrusts were
created in reverse-faulting/thrust stress
regimes (sigma 1 horizontal) with the
allochthon in the W acting as the main
engine.
Rollovers/leading edges of thrusts
are the main drilling targets. Their curvatures are important to assess fracture
presence and enhancement of potential
reservoir rock. Their relative age should
also be assessed to determine availability of open fractures.
Strike-slip faults, parallel with structure trends and at angles to them, add

fractures and enhance reservoir quality. In drilling a leading edge rollover,
one might wish to assess the strike-slip
component of that structure and drill
into it to achieve maximum reservoir
enhancement.
To date, many geologists and
geophysicists commonly accept that
multiple thrust structures are formed by
one thrust having been overridden by a
younger one, which in turn is overridden by another even younger thrust.
This is the multiplex thrust structure. In
it, the oldest thrust is the deepest and
the youngest thrust is the shallowest
structure.
Detailed structural analyses for this
article demonstrate the reverse to be
true. Most deep thrusts are younger
than the overlying shallower ones.
Furthermore, the more easterly the
occurrence of the thrust the younger it
is. It all comes down to rock plough effects: massive rock blades that ploughed
easterly and moved immense volumes
of rock.
Seismic transects ST 1-15 (Part 3 of
this article) and Fig. 11 define the rock
ploughs’ origin through time until all
thrusting ceased.
The McConnell Thrust is a good
example of a massive rock plough (see
photo, p. 40). This thrust (500+ miles
long) is a gigantic composite thrust.
On it, an entire WCSB sedimentary
section moved from W to E on top
of a similar section farther E. Due to
erosion, it is not known how far this
thrust moved E.

Compression and overburden pressure competed to be the larger force.
The overridden section was pushed
E, and under the enormous compression and overburden pressures broke in
many parallel gas-bearing thrusts. Only
the easternmost thrusts have rollovers at
the leading edges. The thrusts beneath
the McConnell Thrust are youngest in
the E.

Folds
In addition to fractures and faults,
folds are abundant throughout the
structured belt (ST 1-15).
There are folds associated with thrust
fault displacement and with sigma
1 force directed parallel to bedding,
resulting in detachment, fault-propagation, harmonic, and gravity sliding
disharmonic folds. There are also symmetric and asymmetric, recumbent,
inclined, upright, cylindrical, noncylindrical, and isoclinal folds.
Many folds are riddled with all types
of fractures. Predicting the occurrences
of such fractures in deep-seated folds
is the most difficult part of structural
geology. This is as difficult as predicting
the shape of the structures and pinpointing their locations at depth.
Successfully exploring the structures is more often than not a game
of chance, despite chance of success

30° dipping front and back limbs are

carbonates. It is difficult to recognize as
it coincides with a major unconformity
surface. In some cases, though, numerous E thrusts support four-way closed
Mississippian rollovers.
Mississippian structures vary greatly
from large elongated four-way closed
rollovers to small thrusted homoclines
along the strike of the structured belt.
It is estimated that some 400 undrilled
Mississippian structures locate between
detachment zones two and three.
The fourth detachment zone is
between Mississippian and Permian
carbonates. It coincides with a seismically mappable regional stratigraphic
and structural unconformity. Extensive
changes in structural attitude mark
this detachment. There are numerous
undrilled small structures just below
this detachment. Above it, many structures contain Permian reservoirs. All are
regionally bound upward by the fourth
detachment (between Permian and
Triassic strata).
“Permian structures” are numerous
and vary in amplitude, size; four-way
closed rollovers, thrust faults, and
strike-slip shear modified structures.
Historically the Permian carbonate play
was small, but recently Talisman Energy
has proven a new and exciting gas
play at Sukunka/Monkman that might
increase in significance as drilling progresses. It is estimated there are some
200 undrilled Permian targets in the
structured belt.
The fifth detachment zone is between Permian and Triassic strata. Triassic carbonates above this zone are found
in large disharmonic folds with steep

resulting in geothermal porosity and
permeability enhancement of the rock.
Further enhancement occurred where
the carbonate section is overlain by
shale (chemical barrier).
Thus, many dolomite reservoirs for
oil and gas were formed capped by
shale. The Slave Point represents this
setting in NE BC. Others are the Triassic
Pardonet/Baldonnel, the Permian Belloy/Belcourt, and the Debolt/Mount
Head formations.
In sheared and-or porous sandstones,
these solutions produced calcite cement, quartz overgrowth, silica cement,
and possibly clay plugging, whereas in
sheared shale silicification and calcification might have resulted. Invariably,
bitumen is present in rocks affected by
the intrusion of solution fluids/crystal
slurries.
Water recharge heads and thrusting
pushed the heated solution fluids/crystal slurries even farther E into formations not affected by deformation. The
resultant flushing occurred along a
42

broad front, 1,000 miles long and 400
miles wide, parallel to the mountains.
Formation fluids, including water, oil,
and gas, where pushed E thus creating regional fairways for hydrocarbon
migration.
Higher temperatures allowed for
more solution gas in oils, but gas was
expelled from the oils on their way E
while cooling off. There fluids including
oil entered the younger, less compacted,
porous rock sections over wide areas
that presently contain 1) the conventional heavy oil belt, extending from N
of Lloydminster to the US border, 2)
the bitumen/tar sands extending from
Fort McMurray to Peace River, and the
3) Grosmont carbonate bitumen belt
farther N.
Most gas escaped, and oxygen-rich
formation and meteoric waters oxidized
the lighter ends, and heavier hydrocarbons remained. The enigmatic Turner
Valley field structure (seismic transect
ST 3, Part 3 of this article) is the only
structure that both captured and re-

tained large volumes of oil (1.3 billion
bbl) in a Mississippian carbonate reservoir, possibly sourced from Cretaceous
source rock from beneath the Turner
Valley thrust.
Geochemistry evaluations of source
rock, hydrocarbons, and coal maturation should be treated with great caution and in an unconventional manner
because of this major hot fluid flushing of the sedimentary section and the
eroded section in the WCSB.
Under normal overburden conditions, source rocks deliver certain
volumes of hydrocarbons. The same
source rock will deliver substantially
more hydrocarbons when it is subjected
to squeezing and torque (wrung out)
from compression and simultaneous
regional shearing.
Next week:The exploration/structural domains
are distinctly different in structural style as illustrated in 15 seismic transects. ✦

Widespread destruction during the 2005
hurricane season in the
Gulf of Mexico has led
to Louisiana creating additional Special Artificial
Production
Reef Site (SARS) locations for disposing of some offshore
structures damaged during the storms.
The Louisiana Advisory Council approves the establishment of these sites.
During 2006, the council approved 10
projects representing 35 platforms as
SARS areas within the Louisiana Artificial Reef Program (LARP).
Because the number of destroyed
structures submitted for SARS review
may have peaked, the project reviews
from the 2005 hurricane season should
finish by yearend 2007.

2005 hurricanes
Hurricane Katrina destroyed 46
platforms and severely damaged 20
others, while Hurricane Rita destroyed

69 platforms and damaged 32 others (Table 1, Fig. 1). The storms also

rigs sustained much damage.
The creation of the SARS program in
1991 within LARP has allowed companies to reef offshore infrastructure such
as platforms, drilling rigs, and derrick
barges destroyed by hurricanes or other
unusual circumstances.
Louisiana created the SARS program
initially to accommodate a drilling rig
in South Timbalier Block 86 that collapsed during Hurricane Juan in 1985.
LARP has nine designated sites for
disposition of offshore structures as

O D U C T I O N

artificial reefs (Fig. 2). Under normal
conditions, a structure that falls outside
these nine areas must either be towed to
it or moved ashore.
For structures destroyed in hurricanes, SARS allows the LARP to
establish reefs outside of the nine
designated areas.

SARS approvals
State
regulators must
decide if a
project submittal fits the SARS
program based
on:
• Would the
destroyed structure benefit recreational
or commercial fishing, or fish habitat at
its current location?
• Would the site pose a threat to
navigation or other users, or interfere
with future oil and gas field development?
• Could the site
serve as a biological
field study or a location for future decommissioned structures?
Regulators evaluate
the technical and environmental aspects of
each project, and if the
structure fails to offer
benefits for the marine
habitat, the structure
owners will have to
remove it in accordance with federal
requirements.

Decommissioning platforms
A platform destroyed in a hurricane
usually lies horizontally on the seafloor,
as if the structure was pushed over on
its side. In some cases, much of the
structure may have been submerged in
mud. Structural integrity of jacket components likely is unknown, increasing
the risks for lifting operations. Complete removal also may not be technically feasible or may pose risks to divers
that exceed acceptable limits.

and poor visibility.
Decommissioning tasks often are
complex and require the design of new
tools. ROVs can reduce the need for
divers, but in most cases, ROVs cannot
do all the operations required and are
expensive to operate.
The cost for decommissioning a
destroyed structure may be 5-25 times
more than for an undamaged structure.
The petroleum industry has extensive experience in decommissioning
offshore structures in the gulf, but only
a small fraction of this work—about
5%—relates to removing structures
damaged by weather.
The industry, to date, has removed
1,286 caissons and 1,438 jacket structures from the gulf (Fig. 3), and for the
past decade removals have averaged 136
structures/year.

In 1984, US Pres. Ronald Reagan
signed the National Fishing Enhancement Act (NFEA – Title II of Public Law
98-623) to “promote and facilitate
responsible and effective efforts to
establish artificial reefs ... constructed
or placed for the purpose of enhancing
fishery resources and commercial and
recreational opportunities.”
The NFEA consolidated several decades of local and state laws and directed the National Marine Fisheries Service
to develop the National Artificial Reef
Plan to serve as a guide to state artificial
reef programs. The NFEA also mandated
the Secretary of Commerce and other
support groups to develop a long-term
plan for siting, constructing, permitting, installing, monitoring, managing,
and maintaining artificial reefs within
and seaward of state jurisdictions.
The US Minerals Management Service (MMS) adopted a rig-to-reef policy
in 1985,1-2 and in 1986, the Louisiana
Fishing Enhancement Act (Act 1001986) created the LARP.3 In 1991, the
Texas legislative established the Texas
Artificial Reef Plan.

Regulatory
requirements
Various government bodies regulate offshore structure decommissioning and
abandonment. The regulatory
body with primary responsibility depends on the structure’s location. State agencies
are responsible for structures
in state waters; the MMS is
responsible for structures in
federal waters.
Regulations in 30 CFR
§250.1703 specify general
requirements for decommissioning in federal waters and
require, within 1 year after
the lease or pipeline right-ofway terminates, permanent
plugging and abandonment
of all wells, removal of all
platforms and other facilities, and clearance from the
seafloor of all obstructions
created by the operations.4
The same federal regulations that guide normal
decommissioning operation apply to infrastructure
destroyed by accident,
terrorism, or natural catastrophe, but approval delays
may occur, depending on the
nature of the destruction and
market conditions following
the event.

RPI deﬁnition
RPI is deﬁned on a project basis as follows:
RPI = HV(A+B+C),
where HV represents the number of platforms in the project,
and A, B, and C are weight factors based on the distance of
the project to the nearest reef site (REEF), distance to shore
(SHORE), and clearance at the site (CLEAR). Value of the weighing factors are:

• Costs for reentry and
redrilling wells.
• Estimates of remaining
reserves.
• Current and forecast
commodity prices.
• Operating costs.
• Strategic considerations.
For pipelines, companies
recover the return on investment primarily through flow
rates, so that a critical factor
in making a decommissioning decision is the expected
depletion rates of the producing area.

column of a specific depth for a structure toppled-in-place and the structure
must satisfy the regulatory requirements for the creation of an artificial
reef at the site.

Site clearance
The last task in decommissioning
is site clearance and verification. The
operator has 60 days after removing
the structure to clear the site and verify
clearance.
For structures that are reefed in
place, the regulators frequently waive
site clearance and verification requirements. For structures destroyed in a
hurricane, steel and other material
debris may remain on the seabed in
and around the site, depending on the
nature of the removal operation and
regulatory agency approval.

Destroyed structure removal
The risks involved in decommissioning destroyed infrastructure are
higher than under normal conditions. Structures destroyed by storms
cannot undergo the normal topsides
inspection and preparation stage,
such as flushing and cleaning piping
and equipment, preparing modules
and support frames, and flushing and
cleaning pipelines.
A destroyed structure typically lies
on the seabed similar to a structure
toppled-in-place. In these cases, access
to wells is more difficult, and the only
thing holding back flow from the well
is the subsurface safety valve.
If floating structures break free from
their moorings, the structure may float
away several miles from the field. For
example, Hurricane Rita flipped the
Typhoon tension-leg platform in Green
Canyon-237 upside-down and moved it
nearly 100 km from the field.
In June 2006, Typhoon was disposed
of in a SARS in the Eugene Island area.

Liability
MMS regulations provide that a
platform operator may be released
from removal obligations if a state

ies resources will accept liability. The
Louisiana Fishing Enhancement Act
established the Department of Wildlife
and Fisheries as the responsible agency
off Louisiana.
The state assumes ownership of
the structure after a company donates
it to the reef program and the state is
responsible for any future costs of buoy
construction and replacement, operation, and liability.
The Act absolves the donor and other
participants constructing a reef from
liability provided they meet the terms
and conditions of the reef permit.

Donation requirements
Operators that donate a platform for
an artificial reef can often lower the
decommissioning cost below the cost
of bringing the platform ashore for
disposal, but many factors determine
the cost of converting a platform into a
reef, and subsequently, the cost savings,
if any.5
Location is one of the primary factors. Structures close to shore that meet

1997

2001

2005

Fixed platforms

clearance requirements can be towed to
the nearest port or scrap yard. Farther
offshore, reefing is more economic
when a structure is close to a designated reef planning area.
Different decommissioning options
will generate various cost estimates
based on the platform characteristics
(size, weight, and complexity), site
(water depth, distance to shore, and
distance to nearest reef site), operator
requirements (cutting method, scheduling, and contract structure), and
conditions at the time of the operation
(available equipment, market rates, and
weather).
Cost savings from reefing can vary
from less than 10% relative to the
cheapest alternative to more than 100%,
depending on the removal method, operator requirements, and assumptions
involved in the estimate. In some cases,
reefing may cost the operator more than
removal to shore.
The state and operator obtain a
third-party estimate of the cost for
removal alternatives before the decommissioning operation. This estimate is

The number and amount of donations vary with time, and during the
past decade, operators have donated
about eight structures/year at an average donation of $1.54 million/year, or
$200,000/structure.
Eight of the 147 platforms donated

LARP statistics
Table 2 shows the structures donated
to LARP, donation amounts, and average
annual donation per structure. From
1987-2006, operators have donated
147 structures at 36 sites and the trust
fund has accrued $29.2 million plus

A site, and materials contained at
the site qualifies as a SARS when one or
more of the following criteria are met:
• There is a historical or biological
significance associated with the site; if,
for example, a particular area is a successful fishing spot frequented by fishermen or divers or if the site provides
good fishery habitat.
• The site is part of a cooperative
effort between the LARP and another
state, federal government, or private
group.
• The site contains shipwrecks or
other derelicts that cannot be practicably removed or relocated, and the site
provides benefits to the LARP.
• The site forms an integral part of
experimental or demonstration projects
undertaken by the LARP.
The accompanying box shows the
procedures for establishing a SARS.
A site considered for SARS must
meet the following criteria specified in
Amendment II of the Louisiana Reef
Plan:6
• Benefit recreational or commercial
fishing, or fish habitat.
• Help fish populations by not removing existing material from site.
• Not a threat to navigation;
• Not currently in bottom trawlable
area.
• Overall benefit user groups.
• Eliminate from an existing planning area an area of equal in size to the
SARS.
• Except for possible trace amounts,
the structures are free and clear of any

terials as listed in current US Environmental Protection Agency regulations.

Screening criteria
A Reef Priority Index (RPI) defines
the priority of projects submitted for
SARS review (see accompanying box).
The RPI provides a screening tool for
the projects that then are evaluated on a
case-by-case basis. Items taken into account include value of habitat formed,
available fishing reports, number of
platforms, ability of the site for disposing of additional structures, distance to
nearby planning areas and other SARS
sites, clearance, relief, pipelines, and
proximity to mud-slide prone regions.
Locations without active pipelines
were SARS candidates. Locations required a review if an active pipeline was
within or bordering a lease at a distance
less than 1,000 ft for the SARS.
Mud-slide prone areas in general
are not appropriate reef sites because
platforms may move, break, or become
submerged. Submerged or buried platforms have little or no habitat value.
Another important factor in approving a SARS was the potential for disposing of additional structures at the site.

SARS
Before Hurricanes Katrina and Rita,
LARP had 12 approved SARS that held
structures destroyed in hurricanes,
damaged in construction accidents, in
biological studies, and met deepwater
reef criteria (Table 3). The 12 SARS held
29 structures, including two drilling
barges and one drilling rig.
Each SARS can accommodate 7-10
platforms, as shown in the development
of West Delta-134, Main Pass-243, and
Eugene Island-313.
At EI-273, EI-309, EI-322, EI-324,
EI-384, SP-89, and VE-395, only one or
two structures are currently contained
at each SARS, but the sites will likely attract additional structures in the future.
Following Hurricanes Katrina and
Rita, the LARP advisory council reviewed the scope of the damage from
the storms and discussed the expected

SARS procedural guidelines
Establishing a SARS follows a welldeﬁned set of procedures, as follows:
• The Louisiana Artiﬁcial Reef Coordinator will draft a proposal to establish a
SARS for submission to the Artiﬁcial Reef
Council. The proposal shall include location, clearance, bottom proﬁle, condition
of structure, list of potential hazardous
material, and justiﬁcation that the criteria
outlined are met.
• Following acceptance of the
proposal by the Louisiana Artiﬁcial Reef
Council, the intent to create a SARS will
be announced through a Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries news
release.
• Thirty days following news releases, if no major objections are received,
the Louisiana Artiﬁcial Reef Coordinator
will apply for the necessary permits. In
the event objections are received, a public
hearing will be held to provide further
information before a ﬁnal determination
by the Council.
If appropriate, a Deed of Donation will
be agreed upon by the donor and recipients of the reef material.
The Secretary of the Department of
Wildlife and Fisheries shall sign all necessary permits and the Deed of Donation.

effect on the program. The council
made recommendations to approve, to
approve with modification, to discuss
for future planning purposes, and to
reject.
Project modifications typically
require platform additions or removals
at the site, and the discussion for planning purposes normally centered on the
site’s suitability for future additions and
deepwater sites for large platforms.
In June 2006, the council reviewed
applicant data for 25 projects with
39 destroyed platforms. Of these, the
council approved 7 projects with 21
platforms for SARS (Table 4, Fig. 2).
In November 2006, the council
reviewed 13 projects with 25 platforms
and 3 mobile offshore drilling units

(MODUs). The projects were both new
and previously reviewed-reconfigured projects. The council approved 3
projects with 14 platforms (Table 4, Fig.
2), and did not recommend any of the
MODU projects.
At yearend 2006, the council had
approved 10 projects with 35 platforms
for SARS. The average RPI for the approved SARS projects was 24.7 while
for the 27 rejected projects it was 6.5.

Notable projects
Two SARS projects are of particular
interest. An eight-pile platform owned
by Taylor in MC-20 failed in a mudslide region and was nearly 75% submerged below the mud line. Estimates
indicate that the dredging for access
and lifting the structure would require
removal of mud equal to the volume of
the New Orleans Superdome. The council did not approve the structure for a
SARS because the habitat value of the
Taylor platform is considered minimal.
BP proposed a reef site for an eightpile platform at GI-40/48, less than
3 miles from the Louisiana Offshore
Operating Port (LOOP) anchorage
area. Clearance restrictions will require
lighted buoys at the site, and because of
the proximity to LOOP, the BP project
will require further evaluation and risk
assessment prior to approval. ✦

EnCana’s Gary Houghton said that
his company chose Lang for its experience working in basalts.2
The custom-built LM700 cost about
$4 million and uses reverse-circulation
airlift to get through the hard basalts
interspersed with lost-circulation zones.
The derrick has a 700,000-lb hookload capacity, includes a top drive, and
sits on a 23-ft high substructure. The
mast can accommodate 100-ft stands of
pipe and can hold as much as 12,000
ft of 65⁄8-in. diameter dual-wall pipe or
up to 16,000 ft of conventional pipe
(Fig. 2).
The drilling system includes a
30,000-gal fluid system, two 900-cfm
compressors, 1,400-psi booster, and a
65-ton Link Belt crane.1
On the first hole, the Lang rig drilled
about 120 ft/day, more than double the
previous rate of 52 ft/day.1

Three wells
EnCana has the largest acreage position in the Columbia River basin, about
811,000 net acres. It used the LM700
rig to drill the basalt sections in three

SUBSEA TIEBACK
Forum & Exhibition

PennWell invites you back to the 8th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition.
SSTB has become the premier event for one of the fastest growing field
development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March 3 – 5, 2008 in
Galveston, TX at the Moody Gardens Hotel & Conference Center. Over 2,000
people and 150 exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference.You can’t
afford to miss it.
As our industry confronts new challenges, it has never been more important
to submerse yourself in them. This year’s theme is “Subsea is here, the game
is changing.” As our game changes, the sharing of knowledge and collective
experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety,
and economics of the subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by
industry leaders. As in the past, only by participating in this conference will you
be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will not be published and no
Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room
stays inside the conference room. We hope you will join us.

EnCana spudded the
second well, Anderson 11-51

to about 11,000 ft. By early
November 2006, the basalt

In its first-quarter operating results, announced May
7, Delta Petroleum said the
Brown 7-24 well was “drilling and should reach total
depth in early summer.”
EnCana spokesman Alan
Boras confirmed drilling status to OGJ and said, “Generally, the Lang rig has worked
very well, with no real
trouble time, such as getting
stuck in the hole. Overall, the
drilling pace has been slower
than expected due to the

the thermally unregenerable protonated
form of the amine. The HSS is itself a
product of the neutralization reaction
between the alkaline amine and an
organic or inorganic acid. Such acids
enter the solution either as the result of
degradation of the amine or by absorption of sulfur oxides or other acidforming components from the raw gas.

The existence
of HSSs is not, however, always detrimental to amine unit performance.
Under certain circumstances, HSSs can

Shahid Hashemi Nejad
(Khangiran) Gas Co. lies in northeast
Iran, 40 km from the Turkmenistan border. The sour-gas sweetening facilities
based on amine are designed to treat
natural gas with about 10% acid gas
from Mozdouran gas field (Fig. 1).
Each of three trains (Gas Treatment
Units 1, 2, and 3) was designed to
treat 346,000 normal cu m/hr (300
MMscfd) sour gas with 910 cu m/hr
DEA and constructed about 30 years
ago.
Two trains, GTU Nos. 4 and 5, were
added 5 years ago and are identical with
previous trains. All were operating with
DEA as solvent. A year ago after experimental stages, all trains were switched
from DEA to MDEA.

The Khangiran gas plant, which is 40 km from the Turkmenistan
border, processes 10% sour gas from Mozdouran gas field.

Operating on MDEA allows Khangiran to process 420,000 std. cu m/hr
of sour gas with 890 cu m/hr MDEA.
Analytical data were measured by Sulfur
Experts Inc., Calgary, at the Khangiran
plant.
The amine facilities at Khangiran are
designed to treat natural gas by DEA
as the amine solvent. About 3 years
ago, one unit was switched from DEA
to MDEA and, following an analysis
of the results, other units were also
switched. The performance of the units
using MDEA has been better than those
using DEA. (Some parameters include
corrosion, energy consumption, amine
circulation rate, and selectivity.)
But at every unit, the initial performance of fresh MDEA at absorbing H2S
in the contactors was less than desirable.
Over time, however, the performance of
absorber (H2S removal from the natural
gas) and regenerator (acid-gas loadings
in lean amine) improved and stabilized.
Figs. 2 and 3 show acid-gas loading, H2S content of lean MDEA, and the
amount of H2S in treated gas during
1 year of operation. Comparing two
unit operations at the same conditions
shows that the unit performance can
improve over time. One unit with fresh
(Unit No. 4) and another with 1-yearold MDEA (Unit No. 5) were kept in
similar circumstances for 1 week. Feed
(sour gas), amine-circulation ratio,
lean-amine temperature to absorbers
and reboiler steam consumption were
roughly equal.
Fig. 4 shows the consequences of this
experiment. The 1-year-old MDEA in
Unit No. 5 has been more effective than
fresh MDEA in Unit No. 4. The amount
of HSS was 1.11% in Unit 5 and 0.39%
in Unit No. 4 solvent.
These data were measured by an on
site laboratory. Amine Experts, Calgary,
also tests our amine solutions and confirmed that HSSs increase over time.

Improving H2S removal

example.

the amine, the net overall reaction is:
H2S + RN D RNH+ +HS−. The equilibrium constant for the reaction is K =
(RNH+) (HS–)/(RN) (H2S).
It can be seen that if the concentration of the protonated form of the
amine is increased, the concentration
of HS– will decrease in proportion, i.e.,
in the regenerator, the H2S loading will
drop.
This has the greatest potential
impact at very low loadings because

here is where the protonated amine
concentration normally would be quite
small (e.g., 0.001 mole/mole) but
has been artificially made quite large.
Consequently, there is a dramatically
decreased equilibrium concentration
of HS– in solution and, therefore, a dramatic decrease in solution loading with
respect to H2S.
The reaction equilibrium has been
shifted towards much lower H2S loadings. This can lead to a regenerated

The problem
At the heart of a pipeline integrity
management plan lies the need to bring
together information from throughout the organization, see how various
information pieces relate to each other,
and act, based on patterns that emerge.
This requires a thorough understanding
of how the available data affect integrity, which in turn requires data to be
integrated and aligned.
The often disparate nature of data
and the various ways of gathering and
reporting it can make aligning and
integrating data difficult (Fig. 1a). A
field report of a leak might give its
location using GPS coordinates, while
an in-line inspection may provide the
location of pipe wall corrosion using an
odometer reading. Landowner records
may be sorted in sequence down the
pipeline length, noting the tract length
per parcel, while the latest close-interval survey of cathodic potential may
record the number of readings at 2.5-ft
spacings from the start of the survey.
A series of points in a particular map
projection may also provide location of
the pipeline, with the as-built stationing
recorded at each pipe bend.
Different data also are often located
in different parts of an organization. The

and can integrate them on screen by

projections and rapidly display very
large datasets through smart database
techniques.
The linear distance down the pipeline, often called stationing, chainage,
mileposts, stake numbers, or kilometer
posts, is essentially a measurement
system established when the pipeline
was built and sometimes updated as
changes to pipe configuration occurred.
An in-line inspection odometer directly corresponds to the measurement
system, and tools now exist that allow
the in-line inspection odometer to be
converted to the stationing system by
aligning common features in the survey
and the pipeline database.
The same concept applies to closeinterval surveys, in which the distance
walked can be converted to stationing.
Any dataset that uses distance along a
pipeline can be integrated by the measurement system into the GIS.
The final step brings data in the
two frames of reference—spatial and
stationing—together. GIS stores the
spatial pipeline data and the stationing
system, and the GIS can display data
stored using stationing at a spatial location, bringing the stationed data onto
the same map as the spatial data and
integrating it.

A series of analysis tools looks for
patterns and can, for example, establish that a leak location is coincident
with corrosion predicted in the in-line
inspection run, as well as a dip in readings during the close-interval survey.
Mapping the extent of each landowner agreement using the tract length
can determine landownership.

Seeking patterns
Data evolve over time. After a number of years, the in-line inspection and
close-interval survey cease to be current
descriptions of the pipeline and need
to be rerun. The pipeline location may
change as the result of reroutes, and
performing more accurate surveys may
refine its location or that of its component features.
Comprehensive data management software packages exist that can
combine the storage of a database with
the integration capabilities of GIS and
tools specific to the pipeline industry.
A database alone is not enough. Users
need tools to comprehensively manage
the pipeline data.
But most GIS packages don’t have
all the tools a pipeline operator needs
to manage its data. An application that
builds on database and GIS capabilities
to provide workflows, such as survey
data integration and pipeline configuration changes, is necessary. In partnership with the industry, a number of
software companies have developed
such applications, making the task of
data maintenance smooth and reliable.
Comprehensively managing pipeline data is critical to the success of an
integrity-management plan, ensuring
users of reliable, current, and accurate
data for their analyses without having
to spend weeks hunting it down, and
without being unsure of the format or
quality.

Data control, key steps
• Bring survey data into a single,
consistent database format where
it can be aligned to the pipeline
system.
• Automate data preprocessing
for any type of analysis.
• Put responsibility for data quality with database managers, not
users.
• Make sure reports connect
summary results back to the original data.
• Use risk-analysis applications
conﬁgurable to a range of data formats, avoiding data preprocessing
and reformatting.

their control, also often feel a sense of
detachment and a loss of control when
data are centralized.
As systems become more flexible, however, they are moving away
from applications bound so tightly
to databases that the slightest change
can render them inoperable. Instead,
applications are becoming much more
configurable to a range of different data
formats. This is happening as software
design heads in the direction of data
format plug-ins and flexibility at its
deepest levels and data modeling moves
from strict standards to format guidelines and best practices.
A flexible application, instead of
hard-coding itself to a particular table
in a database, allows the user to pick the
table and tell the application how data
are stored. The pipeline company can
then configure the database to suit all its
needs, not just those of one application.
Applications have core needs, required to do their jobs. A mapping application needs some description of the
pipeline location, for example. But storFlexibility

Database
Users should not have to know or
care about the databases behind the
tools they use. The database should
remain the domain of a select few, those
who design and maintain them. Users
manipulating in-line inspection data or
planning a dig should not need to worry about the format of data or where
it resides. They should, rather, simply
be confident that data will be available
when they need it, in the format they
request, and that it will be protected
from inappropriate changes.
Achieving this level of simplicity in
the pipeline world requires application
design that enables users to be task-focused and keep data behind the scenes.

Case study
A major North American natural gas
transmission pipeline operator found
itself with data-management problems
when preparing for its annual pipeline
risk assessments. Its 7,000-mile system
generated a considerable amount of
pipeline asset data, in addition to that
created by surveys and analyses performed to maintain its integrity.
The operator’s annual assessment
considers a variety of risk factors,
including consequences of failure and
threats that can influence the likelihood
of failure. This process uses algorithms
that weigh a range of different data sets
against each other.
The problem for this specific company was not the algorithm; it was
well developed and proven on small
test datasets to yield an accurate relative risk score for any specific pipeline
segment. The problem was processing
7,000 miles of pipeline data to suit
the algorithm and get output useful to
prioritizing maintenance and mitigation activities.
Data were spread over the entire
company in a large number of formats.
In some cases, data were being typed
into a set of database screens for each of
the 19,000 pipeline segments identified

for analysis. The risk-assessment team
had become experts in data manipulation and had constructed a complex
web of preprocessing steps to get data
into the proper format. This process
took many months and required extensive documentation if each of the final
datasets were to be related back to its
source, a critical step in justifying the
results of analysis.
A typical annual risk analysis therefore involved data processing by up to
four team members lasting 9 months.
Data loading took a database analyst
several additional weeks and included
even more manipulation of data to suit
the algorithms.
The company began a data-integration initiative to bring together the asset
and survey data sets being collected
routinely across the pipeline system
into a central data management system.
The goals of the initiative were to:
• Make a permanent home for all
data sets so users could find data that
they needed.
• Standardize the data formats so
that users always knew how to access
the data.
• Manage updates to the data so that
users could be assured they were working with the most up-to-date information.
• Properly handle changes to the
data so that dependencies between different datasets were properly accounted
for in the event of an edit or update.
These were company-wide goals, but
without a configurable risk analysis application the benefits for the risk team
would not reach their full potential.
The company used the data-integration initiative to revisit the risk analysis
software and found that a configurable
risk-analysis application was available
and would lead to dramatic improvements.
The company’s first step was data integration, bringing disparate data from
across the organization into a common
aligned database. The balance of this
article will focus on one of these data
sets: in-line inspection data.
The operator used five separate

survey vendors during the 5 years
before the analysis, resulting in not only
five different vendor formats, but also
significant evolution in the data formats
as inspection tool technology advanced.
The inability of some vendors consistently to deliver in the agreed format
also complicated the data.
The company wanted to load and
align 56 individual in-line inspections into the corporate database. This
process used template files to describe
the different data formats by vendor
and then vintage. Reusing these files to
load the data significantly streamlined
the process and brought the survey data
into a single, consistent database format
from which it could be aligned with
the pipeline system, supplementing
the odometer readings with actual pipe
stationing.
Applications that stored quality indices within the resulting data documented the loading and alignment process.
Similar problems were experienced
across most of the external data, including close-interval surveys, readings
from test stations, and field inspections.
A total of 25 new data types was introduced to the database, joining existing
asset data.
Once the data were properly integrated in the shared pipeline database,
the new risk application was able to
read the data in the same format in
which it was being stored within the
data-management system, eliminating
the need to consolidate and reformat
the data, which previously took several months of work. The risk-analysis
application also allowed the team to
automate data preprocessing. These
tasks having already been addressed, the
company’s risk-analysis team simply
needed to configure the application to
read the data it wanted and then run
the analysis.
The data-integration process also put
responsibility for the quality of data
where it belonged: with its owners.
Since the members of the risk team
were not corrosion experts or particularly knowledgeable about the status
of specific pipeline locations, they had

never been able to qualify the data they
were using.
The new streamlined approach also
increased the reliability of the analysis.
Users could see how specific points in
the original data affected the risk scores.
Reports with drill-down capabilities connected summary results back
to the original data, rather than to a
preprocessed version of the data as had
previously occurred. If a user wanted to
see why a specific risk score came out
the way it did, they could click down
through the report to explore the exact
data interactions that lead to the calculation.
The time needed to run an analysis
also decreased significantly, allowing the
risk analysis team to discuss any data
quality concerns with those maintaining it, explore dependencies between
datasets by performing multiple runs
of the analysis, and generally focus on
risk analysis rather than acting as data
detectives. ✦

such as heavy crude. Other applications
include high temperature processes such
as asphalt, bitumen, monomers, polymers,
wax, and cooking oils that are difficult to
control and keep below a set temperature
limit.
Users can run heavy refined products
hotter for a more productive and repeatable process, the company notes. And
because meters have higher operating limits, there is no need to keep temperatures
from exceeding an upper limit.

What? No global
warming panic?
How shocking!
An eminent prophet of global-warming
doom is shocked that a colleague doesn’t
share his anxiety.
In a May 31 radio interview, Michael
Grifﬁn, administrator of the US National
Aeronautics and Space Administration,
raised questions about urgent responses to
observed warming.
“I have no doubt that a trend of global
warming exists,” Grifﬁn told National Public

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

Radio. “I am not sure that it is fair to say
that it is a problem we must wrestle with.
To assume that it is a problem is to assume
that the state of Earth’s climate today is
the optimal climate, the best climate that
we could have or ever have had and that
we need to take steps to make sure that it
doesn’t change.
“First of all, I don’t think it’s within the
power of human beings to assure that the
climate does not change, as millions of
years of history have shown. And, second
of all, I guess I would ask which human beings—where and when—are to be accorded
the privilege of deciding that this particular
climate that we have right here today, right
now, is the best climate for all other human
beings. I think that’s a rather arrogant position for people to take.”
So goes the maligned “skeptical” position on global warming. It’s the position
that regularly encounters claims that the
debate is over and that if you don’t “believe
in global warming” and the need to do
something radical about it then you’re
obviously wrong and don’t deserve to be
listened to.
Listening to Grifﬁn on NPR, someone
might get the heretical idea that warming
doesn’t warrant panic.
“I was shocked by his comments,”
responded James Hansen, head of NASA’s
Goddard Institute for Space Studies.
Hansen ﬁgured prominently in former US
Vice-President Al Gore’s horror ﬁlm about
warming, An Inconvenient Truth. “It was a
remarkable statement. I don’t know if it was
planned or it just slipped out of his mouth.”
In a transcript, Grifﬁn’s statement
doesn’t read like a slip. It reads like a
thoughtful and overdue appeal to examine
global warming from a perspective other
than the scariest imaginable.

Natural gas nudges $8/MMbtu
The front-month natural gas contract was knocking at the $8/MMbtu level in intraday trading May 30-31 in New York, with investors expecting warmer temperatures
across most of the US.
The July natural gas contract traded as high as $8/MMbtu on May 31 on the New
York Mercantile Exchange before closing at $7.94/MMbtu, down just 0.06¢ for the
day. By the close of trading June 1, it had dropped to $7.88/MMbtu. “Another triple
digit storage injection offset forecasts for hotter weather,” explained analysts at Enerfax Daily.
The Energy Information Administration reported the injection of 107 bcf of natural
gas into US underground storage in the week ended May 25, up from 104 bcf the
prior week. US gas storage totaled 2.1 tcf, down by 179 bcf from last year’s total at
that time but 355 bcf above the 5-year average.
That injection ﬁgure implied “that we are 1.9 bcfd looser year-over-year on a
weather-adjusted basis,” said analysts at Raymond James & Associates Inc. in Houston. “While an increasing price incentive to burn natural gas over crude derivatives
is serving to boost gas demand, the positive fuel-switching impact has not been
enough to offset LNG imports and liquid-stripping trends in the near term,” they
said.
The market also was preparing for the hurricane season, which began June 1.
Crude prices ﬂuctuate
The front-month crude contract price fell to the lowest level in more than 2
months as NYMEX reopened May 29 after the 3-day Memorial Day weekend to an
apparent easing of both global geopolitical tensions and reﬁnery problems. The July
contract for crude traded at $62.54-65.24/bbl before closing at $63.15/bbl, down by
$2.05 for the day. By June 1, it had climbed back to $65.08/bbl.
EIA said commercial inventories of US benchmark light, sweet crudes fell 2
million bbl to 342.2 million bbl during the week ended May 25. Gasoline stocks
increased more than expected, up 1.3 million bbl to 198 million bbl that week, but
were still well below average for the summer driving season that began May 26-28.
During the same week, total gasoline imports averaged 1.6 million b/d, the thirdhighest weekly average ever. Input of crude into US reﬁneries dropped by 76,000
b/d to 15.6 million b/d, and utilization rates of US reﬁneries remained relatively ﬂat
at 91.1% of capacity. “We ﬁnd crude oil remaining undecided on its direction,” said
Olivier Jakob, Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland.
Meanwhile, Raymond James analysts said, “With the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries itself struggling to bring fresh capacity online, overall growth in
global oil supply appears barely sufﬁcient to keep up with demand, let alone increasing excess capacity.” Nor does it appear that non-OPEC producers will contribute
any meaningful supply additions, given the mature characteristics of most of those
ﬁelds. “Indeed, a permanent non-OPEC peak seems likely in the next 5-10 years.
Non-OPEC growth is highly dependent on Russian growth and, given the current
policy environment, Russia is unlikely to post the growth it experienced in the early
part of this decade,” they reported.
Raymond James reported, “The world is likely to continue in an environment of a
wafer-thin excess capacity ‘cushion’ for the foreseeable future. Given this tight supply-demand equation, threats of even minor supply disruptions are bound to have a
large impact on already volatile oil prices, and the oil markets look set to continue to
price in a substantial geopolitical risk premium.”
Jakob said imports of crude by China and India during April surpassed “for the
ﬁrst time ever” crude imports by South Korea and Japan. “As Japanese reﬁneries
come back from maintenance, this should remain for now a temporary situation,
but this structural shift in the regional energy balance should continue and become
more permanent over the next 2 years,” he said. “Compared to April 2006, China and
India crude imports have grown by about the same quantity. South Korea imports
remain about unchanged, while Japan continues to import much lower volumes
than last year.”
Among Asian countries such as Japan and South Korea, Jakob said, reﬁnery runs
will now start to increase as reﬁneries come out of the seasonal maintenance and
should bring the region to new record high crude imports. “The real test to OPEC
compliance [with its production quota] will come when Japanese crude oil demand
starts to rise again, and indications from OPEC trackers are that OPEC supply is starting to slowly increase,” he said.

Welcome to the 19th annual Deep Offshore Technology (DOT) International
Conference and Exhibition in Stavanger, Norway.
The industry is taking on new challenges in frontier areas and the Arctic is one
of the new exciting frontiers now being explored. The challenges in these harsh
conditions and the technology needed to succeed will be a focus in this year’s DOT
Conference, and will represent one of the “Oceans of New Opportunities”.
The mature basins still have a lot to offer, thanks to important technological breakthroughs. These basins have, to a large extent, been used to qualify new technology
that can now be further tested and used in frontier areas around the globe. The
industry is going deeper, drilling through huge salt layers, tackling larger pressure
reservoirs and establishing operations in harsh climates from the icy north to the
windy Gulf of Mexico.
The DOT conference is a leading forum where attendees discuss important technical
solutions related to exploration, development, and production of oil and gas in deep
and ultra-deepwater. The forum provides you a unique opportunity to share and gain
experience in your field of expertise. Through its long history, the DOT Conference
has proven to be one of the most important conferences to meet your peers and
experts and discuss technological innovations. The constant strive to improve
safety, quality and economics are always the base for the discussions.
DOT also encourages the development of young professionals, as evidenced by
34% of papers authored by young petrotechs in DOT 2006 and has proven to be
effective for newcomers to quickly gain an overview and understanding of key
related technologies.
Statoil is proud to be the host for this year’s conference. Statoil is a significant
deepwater player, participating in ground-breaking current developments in frontier
basins globally. Closer to home, our Snøhvit development in the Arctic is the first of
its kind, and it has opened doors for a new era for the industry in these icy waters.
Statoil is recognized for being a front-end developer and user of new technology,
and the DOT Conference serves as an important arena to network with our partners
regarding the development of technology.
Speaking on behalf of the Advisory Board, I believe this year’s program will engage
you, challenge you and benefit you. The International DOT gives you a unique
opportunity to meet peers across borders and to enjoy the variety and international
flavor Stavanger has to offer.
I look forward to seeing you in Stavanger, Norway this October.

PennWell conferences and exhibitions
are thought provoking events that
cover your area of expertise, allowing
you to stay ahead in a constantly
changing industry.

Deepwater & Arctic
Oceans of New Opportunities
The 19th Deep Offshore Technology International Conference & Exhibition (DOT) is scheduled for October 10 -12, 2007 and
will be held at the Stavanger Forum in Stavanger, Norway. Statoil will host this event which promises to draw exhibitors and
attendees from the oilfield centers in the North Sea, Russia, China, Asia, Europe, Africa, Brazil and the United States.
Norway’s heritage of developing innovative technology for the deep offshore oil and gas exploration and production market
makes Stavanger an ideal setting for the industry’s largest conference dedicated to providing technical and operating
information to the flourishing offshore and subsea markets.
Today, there are 48 fields in production on the Norwegian Continental Shelf and production from these fields corresponds
to around 20 times the domestic consumption of petroleum and has established Norway as a key supplier to the global oil
market and the lucrative European gas market.
DOT will bring the world’s brightest technological minds together for a three-day conference dedicated to the sharing of
information and technology among industry professionals while highlighting Norway as one of the top producing oil and gas
exploration and production areas in the world.

DOT Mission Statement
DOT is recognized as the leading forum addressing technical issues related to exploration, development, and production of
oil and gas in deep and ultra deepwater basins around the world. As our industry confronts new challenges, the sharing of
deepwater experience will play a critical role in improving the quality, safety, and economics of future endeavors.
The mission of DOT is to provide an annual forum dedicated to the advancement of the deepwater exploration & production.
The conference addresses the technical challenges to safely and cost-effectively develop deepwater reserves, and encourages
the development of young professionals.

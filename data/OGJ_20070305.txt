COVER
Brunei Shell Petroleum Co. Sdn. Bhd. employed SeaDrill Ltd.’s West
Pelaut tender rig to drill wells off the Champion West platform.
This highly automated platform is fully integrated for remotely
controlled operations. Systems on the platform gather pressure, temperature, fluid, and flow data continuously and transmit it to end
users for on line monitoring and control. Completed wells include
multiple downhole hydraulically controlled interval control valves,
permanent downhole gauges, and distributed temperature sensing.
The articles in OGJ’s special report section, starting on p. 41,
describe various hardware and software operators have installed for
automating oil fields. Photo from Shell.

Demand rising for unconventional oil, gas
Wood Mackenzie Ltd., Edinburgh, estimates unconventional
hydrocarbons resources of 3.6 trillion boe worldwide. Unconventional resources include heavy oil, tight gas, coalbed methane, oil
sands, and shale oil. WoodMac sees them playing a key role in the
future world oil and gas supply mix.
In its study, “Unconventional Hydrocarbons—The hidden opportunity,” WoodMac said anticipated tightening global oil supply
and tightening regional gas supply intensify the demand for unconventional oil and gas.
Recent high commodity prices are driving future development of unconventional assets. Development so far has focused on
Canadian oil sands and US unconventional gas. “In the future, we
believe that we will see more global development of these unconventional hydrocarbons,” said WoodMac analyst Rhodri Thomas.
Heavy oil development is seen as being particularly competitive
and likely to be successful if the technologies can be proved and
can remain viable for the long term.
WoodMac said unconventional oil is expected to supply at least
20% of oil production by 2020 compared with less than 10% of
total worldwide oil production today.
Unconventional gas, meanwhile is expected to make up 42% of
US gas supply in 2010, up from 27% in 2005.
Canadian oil sands production is expected to quadruple from
today’s level to 4 million b/d by 2020.
Meanwhile in the US, oil shale deposits in Utah, Wyoming, and
Colorado are attracting renewed interest. Companies will need
both technology and a thorough understanding of the subsurface,
the study said.
WoodMac identified technical, fiscal, and environmental challenges before unconventional development can proceed. “As unconventional resources are distributed widely around the globe,
the key risk is not discovering the resource, but in identifying areas
where the critical factors are in place to enable economic development,” said Phaedra Powilanska-Burnell, WoodMac analyst.
Regional and country-specific factors must be taken into account, the study said. Independents traditionally dominated unconventional oil and gas plays in the US and Canada. But integrated
companies are beginning to take larger stakes in such projects.
“With conventional non-OPEC supply expected to peak within
the next decade and the difficulties in discovering accessible gas
reserves, international oil companies with growth ambition cannot afford to ignore these unconventional resources,” PowilanskaBurnell said.

forts to expand its jurisdiction over offshore natural gas gathering
facilities. But it still intends to intervene if an interstate pipeline’s
gathering affiliate uses market power to benefit the pipeline as it
supplies transportation and sales services to producers.
A Feb. 15 policy statement responds to comments received after FERC launched a notice of inquiry in September 2005 at Shell
Offshore Inc.’s request to consider reexamining offshore gathering system regulation criteria established in a 1994 proceeding
involving Arkla Gathering Service Co. FERC had previously ruled
in Shell Offshore’s favor in a complaint relating to Transcontinental
Gas Pipe Line Corp.’s North Padre Island offshore gathering system
in Texas, but a federal appeals court vacated the order in 2004.
“The commission has tried a number of times to assert jurisdiction over offshore gathering facilities to protect against undue
preference and the exercise of monopoly power but has been repeatedly rebuffed by the courts,” FERC Chairman Joseph T. Kelliher
observed. “We must accept the judgment of the courts. Under current law, offshore gathering is an unregulated monopoly. That will
remain the case unless and until the law changes.”
Gathering systems beyond state waters are not regulated, but
FERC has tried to establish its authority by arguing that a pipeline
and gathering system should be treated as a single entity if the
gathering system circumvents the commission’s regulation of the
pipeline. The Natural Gas Act allows FERC to invoke its authority in
such instances, the commission said. It said it also does not need to
determine that concerted action between the pipeline and gathering affiliate necessarily occurred in those cases.
FERC also denied Shell Offshore’s request for a rehearing of its
complaint and suggested that the producer take the matter up with
the US Department of the Interior since it has regulatory jurisdiction over offshore gathering systems under the Outer Continental
Shelf Lands Act.

Ecuador to rejoin OPEC in second quarter
Ecuador will rejoin the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries in the second quarter of this year, Energy Minister Alberto Acosta said.
Ecuador, South America’s fifth largest oil producer, quit OPEC
in 1992. It exports about 70% of its oil production, which late last
year was 516,000 b/d.
Acosta called Ecuador’s withdrawal from the group a “mistake”
and said belonging to the organization would bring “numerous
benefits such as controlling the price of crude.”
Angola joined OPEC Jan. 1. Sudan also is considering membership. ✦

Aramco makes oil discovery with Dirwazah well
Saudi Aramco reported an oil discovery in Saudi Arabia about
70 km southeast of Gawar field and 280 km south of Dharan field.
The Dirwazah-1 well tested in the Unayzah reservoir at 15,310 ft.
The well flowed 3,915 b/d of oil with 11.9 MMscfd of gas at
4,466 psi wellhead pressure through a 32⁄64-in. choke.
Under normal production completion, the well is expected to
flow at a higher rate. Aramco did not provide further details on the

Sherritt International Corp., Toronto, plans a $6 million 3D seismic survey on four Gulf of Mexico blocks off Cuba in the second
quarter.
The company also plans to export part of its Cuban North Coast
heavy crude this year for the first time.
Sherritt holds Blocks 15, 23, 24, and 33 north of the western
part of the island.
The eastern part of Block 15 abuts the boundary with US waters
along the US Minerals Management Service Rankin and Dry Tortugas planning areas (see map, OGJ, Dec. 11, 2000, p. 42).
Block 15 is 145 miles west-southwest of Key West, Fla., and
130 miles west of Cuban Block 27, where Repsol-YPF SA drilled
Yamagua-1 in 2004 to TD 3,410 m in 1,660 m of water. The well
found evidence of oil generation and an excellent carbonate complex (OGJ Online, Oct. 12, 2005).
Sherritt recently said it averages 30,000 b/d of oil production
from mostly heavy oil fields along Cuba’s northern coast.
The company forecast 2007 capital expenditures in Cuba at
$130 million, including eight wells on blocks in which Sherritt
has 100% interest and 10 wells on Block 7, in which it has 45%
interest. Four wells are to be exploratory or appraisal wells, and
more appraisal wells may be required.
Gross working interest oil production could climb 5-10% from
2006 levels, and limited demand for the domestic heavy oil could
allow exports, the company said.
Sherritt is appraising Majaguillar field, obtaining greater efficiencies at the Canasi water treatment plant, and improving recovery from other production activities. Majaguillar is expected to be
declared commercial this year.

in a 75-ft gross interval. The well is drilled to 20,250 ft measured
depth, 19,060 ft true vertical depth, and is near production infrastructure. Working interests are McMoRan 50%, Energy XXI (Bermuda) Ltd. 31.5%, and a private partner the rest.
The Hurricane Deep well, in 12 ft of water on South Marsh
Island Block 217, is drilling below 20,600 ft TVD and projected
to 21,500 ft.
“Logging while drilling tools have indicated that an exceptionally thick upper Gyro sand was encountered totaling 900 gross ft.
The top of this Gyro sand is credited with a potential of 50 ft of
net hydrocarbons in a 53-ft gross interval,” McMoRan said. “These
exceptional sand thicknesses suggest that prospects in the Mound
Point/JB Mountain/Hurricane/Blueberry Hill area may have thick
sands as potential Gyro reservoirs,” it said.
Logs indicated that the well previously cut 27 net ft of hydrocarbon-bearing sands in a 200-ft gross interval in a laminated Rob L
section and a potential 20 ft of hydrocarbon-bearing sands in a 70ft Operc section. The well is near production facilities. McMoRan’s
interest is 25%.

HI-31 ﬁnd to produce from Pan Andean platform

Hunt Oil Co., Dallas, has made an oil and gas discovery on High
Island Block 31, just 800 m from the borders of High Island Block
30, another shallow-water block in the Gulf of Mexico off Galveston, Tex.
Pan Andean Resources PLC is the operator and 63% interest
owner of High Island Block 30.
Encouraged by the close proximity of Hunt Oil’s discovery, PanAndean said it will reassess the exploration potential of its block.
Pan Andean and Hunt Oil have agreed to tie in production from
the discovery to Pan Andean’s platform on High Island 30. The
agreement also allows Hunt Oil to become operator of the platform.
The agreement will improve the cash flow from Block 30
through a monthly production handling fee of $40,000 and will
lower expected operating costs, extend the life of the platform by
an expected 7 years, and improve prospectivity of the block, where
little prospecting has been conducted in the past 3 decades.
Pan Andean said tying in the new discoveries and refitting the
platform will take upwards of 6 weeks. In addition, ownership

The project’s natural gas production for the 2007 peak
winter season has been 140 MMcfd and is being marketed to
two domestic customers in the Khabarovsk Krai.
Consisting of three offshore fields—Chayvo, Odoptu,
and Arkutun Dagi—the Sakhalin-1 project, over its life, will
provide Russia with direct revenues of more than $50 billion. The Russian content of contracts awarded to date for the
Sakhalin-1 project exceeds $3.6 billion.
The project’s future phases of development are expected to
sustain export gas production from all three fields to 2050.

Petrobras eyes oil in Jordanian shales
Brazil’s state-owned Petroleo Brasilerio SA (Petrobras)
signed a memorandum of understanding with Jordan’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources to study the technical
and economic viability of Petrobras’s patented Petrosix mining technology at the Attarat Umm Ghudran (AUG) oil shale
deposit 50 miles south of Amman.

Processing
Fire delays Porvoo reﬁnery diesel line start-up
A small-scale fire Feb. 25 caused by a flange leak at Neste Oil Corp.’s
Porvoo refinery in Finland will delay to mid-April the commissioning
of the new diesel production line at the refinery. Start up of the more
than €700 million diesel expansion was originally expected by yearend 2006, then was rescheduled to late March.
No other part of the refinery was affected in the incident. Neste
said, “Personnel were not injured in the fire that caused damage
primarily to some electric cables.” Neste said in 2003 it would
expand diesel production by 1 million tonnes/year at the sophisticated 200,000 b/d refinery, and construction began in 2004.
Porvoo produces high quality, low-emission motor fuels from
residue oil. Although the overall capacity of the refinery will remain the same, Neste said, the diesel production line will enable
an increase in the refining of heavy oil or other crude into products
such as sulfur-free diesel to meet strict European and North American environmental standards.

Marubeni plans biodiesel project in Brazil
Japan’s Marubeni Corp. and Dutch grain trader Agrenco Group
jointly plan to start producing biodiesel fuel from soybean oil produced in Brazil beginning in 2008.
In a bid to tap growing demand amid heightened concerns over
global warming, the joint venture partners—Agrenco 66.7% and
Marubeni 33.3—plan to produce 400,000 tonnes/year of the alternative fuel. The JV, Agrenco Energia, will construct two mills for
extracting oil from soybeans and three additional facilities to process the soybean oil into biofuel.
The bioenergy complexes are designed to produce pure B100
biodiesel, which the firms said can be used “in any vehicle without
adaptation.” The biofuel, to be produced in compliance with European Community EN 14424 regulation, will first be sold in Brazil,
which will require diesel fuel to contain 2% biodiesel starting in
fiscal 2008.
Under a 10-year supply agreement signed by the two companies

Petrobras international and downstream representatives
will conduct the 24-month study, which covers 11 sq km
Block AUG 21. Jordan’s Natural Resources Authority estimated that the block has a potential of 1.7 billion bbl of oil.
Cretaceous shales in the entire 348 sq km AUG deposit
average 70 m thick with 45-62 m of overburden, a Jordanian
report said.
Petrobras mines oil from Permian Irati shale using the
Petrosix process at Sao Mateus do Sul in Parana State. Production averaged 4,200 b/d in 2006 (OGJ, June 12, 2006,
p. 37). The Irati formation bituminous shales cover parts of
Sao Paolo, Parana, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul, Mato
Grosso, and Goias states.
As oil prices have remained relatively high in recent years,
Jordan, Morocco, the US, and China have contacted Petrobras
to discuss shale oil production partnerships, Petrobras said.
Jordan has numerous shale deposits but no commercial shale
oil production. ✦

in 2005, Marubeni has priority sales rights for Agrenco’s products,
including biodiesel, from South America to Japan and other Asian
markets except China.

Pembroke reﬁnery FCC unit to be revamped
Chevron Corp. has let an engineering, procurement, and construction management contract to AMEC PLC for a revamp of the 90,000
b/d FCC unit at its 210,000-b/cd refinery in Pembroke, Wales.
AMEC said the project will improve reliability of the unit’s main
fractionator and improve product yields. The complex refinery
produces about 3.5 million gal/day of gasoline.

Sabic mulls site change for China petchem plant
Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (Sabic) is growing impatient with
Chinese delays concerning a planned $5.2 billion petrochemical
plant for Dalian, Liaoning Province, and may seek another location,
according to the company’s chairman.
Prince Saud bin Thunayan al-Saud said his state-owned firm had
been in talks about the project with Sinopec and Dalian Shide for
3 years, and that the companies have been waiting 18 months for
Chinese authorities—the National Development and Reform Commission—to approve the project.
“We hope this approval gets completed so that we can go ahead
with our investment in the project,” Al-Saud said, adding that Sabic
has alternatives in more than one country and that there are many
other opportunities worldwide. However, he conceded that “there
isn’t a specific alternative to China.”
He said, “We still believe the China market is promising and
that the opportunity to invest in China is a good one,” adding that
“there is no doubt any project or economic feasibility study depends on a certain timeframe.”
In October 2004 Sabic announced the 50-50 joint venture project that is to include a 1.3 million tonne/year ethylene plant and a
10 million tonne/year refinery. At the time Sabic hoped to see the
facility online by 2010.

China, foreign partners to expand Fujian reﬁnery
Subsidiaries of China Chemical & Petroleum Corp. (Sinopec),
ExxonMobil Corp., and Saudi Aramco jointly signed two separate
contracts for a related project to triple refining capacity at a Fujian
Province refinery. The projects seek to meet China’s rapidly growing demand for petroleum and petrochemicals.
One contract is for the Fujian Refining & Ethylene Joint-Venture
Project, which will increase the existing 80,000 b/d refinery in
Quanzhou City to 240,000 b/d. The expanded refinery primarily
will refine and process sour Saudi Arabian crude.
The project also will include construction of an 800,000 tonne/
year ethylene steam cracker, an 800,000 tonne/year polyethylene
unit, a 400,000 tonne/year polypropylene unit, and an aromatics
complex to produce 700,000 tonnes/year of paraxylene. In addition, a 300,000-tonne crude berth and utilities, including cogen-

eration facilities of 280 Mw, also will be built.
Electricity generated by the cogeneration facilities will provide
about 80% of the power requirement for the project, which is expected to start up in early 2009.
Interest in this project will be held by Fujian Petrochemical
Co. Ltd. (a 50:50 Sinopec-Fujian government partnership) 50%,
ExxonMobil China Petroleum & Petrochemical Co. Ltd. 25%, and
Saudi Aramco Sino Co. Ltd. 25%.
The other contract is the Fujian Fuels Marketing Joint-Venture
Project, which will market diesel and motor gasoline products produced by Fujian Refining & Ethylene Joint-Venture Project, as well
as manage and operate about 750 service stations and a network
of terminals in Fujian Province. It will be owned 55% by Sinopec,
ExxonMobil 22.5%, and Saudi Aramco 22.5%.
Both JVs will be formed upon government approval. ✦

Two Mississippi LNG projects get FERC nod
The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved two
LNG terminal projects in Mississippi that could add supplies totaling 3.1 bcfd of gas.
The terminals, which would adjoin each other, are the Bayou
Casotte project, next to Chevron USA’s Pascagoula refinery, and the
LNG Clean Energy project proposed by Gulf LNG Energy LLC. The
first will deliver as much as 1.6 bcfd of regasified LNG to an interstate grid through five pipeline interconnections, while the second
will send vaporized LNG through a new pipeline and a gas processing plant owned by BP America Inc.
“These are significant import projects, with a combined capacity nearly equal to the projected capacity of an Alaskan gas pipeline.
More importantly, we find that these projects meet our high safety
standards,” FERC Chairman Joseph T. Kelliher said in the commission’s Feb. 15 announcement.
FERC also authorized expansion of a 42-in. pipeline proposed
by sponsors of the recently authorized Creole Trail LNG project
18.1 miles west in Cameron Parish, La., to intersect with the terminus of a pipeline system originating at another recently authorized
LNG terminal at Sabine Pass. Both terminals and pipelines will be
operated by Cheniere Energy of Houston.
The commission also approved Maritimes & Northeast Pipelines
LLC’s application to expand capacity of its existing facilities by 418,000
dekatherms/day to 833,317 dekatherms/day to accommodate imports of regasified LNG from the Canaport LNG terminal in Canada.
It also approved Maritimes’ request to amend its Presidential
Permit to allow the increased imported gas from Canada and to
construct and operate an additional interconnection at the US-Canada border near Goldboro, NS. The proposed project will cost an
estimated $321.3 million, FERC said.

Second Rockies Express pipeline segment online
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners Natural Gas Pipelines (KMP),
operator of the proposed 1,663-mile Rockies Express Pipeline
(REP) gas system, has initiated service on a 192-mile, 42-in. pipeline section from the Wamsutter Hub in Wyoming to Colorado’s
Cheyenne Hub.
10

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

The pipeline is the second section completed on the Western leg
of the $4.4 billion system. REP will transport as much as 1.8 bcfd
of gas from prolific Wyoming and Colorado basins to upper Midwest and eastern US markets. The owners have received binding firm
commitments from shippers for almost all of the pipeline’s capacity.
The first segment—136 miles of 36-in. pipeline from the
Meeker Hub in Colorado to the Wamsutter Hub—began interim
service in February 2006. Capacity on the combined 328-mile first
two segments is 500 MMcfd. That capacity will increase to as much
as 750 MMcfd when the Enterprise Gas Processing LLC plant at
Meeker goes into service later this year.
KMP Pres. Scott Parker said he expects to receive Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission approval this spring for the final 713-mile,
42-in. western leg of REP from Weld County, Colo., to Audrain County,
Mo. Construction is expected to begin shortly thereafter and, subject
to regulatory approvals, REP-West will be in service in December.
REP-East, a 622-mile segment from eastern Missouri to the Clarington Hub in Ohio is expected to be in interim service as early as Jan.
1, 2009, and fully completed by June 2009.

Nigeria misses gas supply deadlines to Ghana
Nigeria has delayed supplying gas to Ghana through its $560
million West African Gas Pipeline because of militants’ vandalism
on infrastructure in the Niger Delta.
According to local reports, Ghana—one of the customers of the
678-km WAGP system—has constructed its section of the line and
other facilities and expected to receive gas in March. Ghana is expected to take 122 MMcfd of gas.
Nigeria is evaluating the status of the pipeline with the shareholders in West African Gas Pipeline Co. (WAGPCo), which is managing the project.
Project leader Chevron Corp. said WAGPCo is aiming for first gas
deliveries in the second quarter.
Nigeria’s Energy Minister Edmund Daukoru said the 470 MMcfd
pipeline should have been completed in December, 18 months after the final investment decision was taken by the shareholders.
Gas through the WAGPCo system will be used for electric power
generation and industrial development in Ghana, Togo, and Benin. ✦

Politics of independence
Politicians who make “energy independence”
a target of US governance say much about themselves. They either know little about US energy
realities or stand to gain some advantage from
policies motivated by unachievable goals. Neither
condition provides a solid basis for policy-making.
“Whereas, energy independence can be
achieved by innovation, diversifying energy sources, creating energy efficient products, and promoting conservation measures,” the Democratic National Committee Resolutions Committee asserted
on Feb. 1 while declaring support for “Democratic
elected officials in Congress and in states and local
communities across the country who are working
toward energy independence, security, and diversity as well as a safe, clean environment.” Voters
can decide which condition—ignorance or special
interest—is at work here.

No monopoly
Democrats can claim no monopoly of the
politics of energy independence. At a solar-energy
company in Merrimack, NH, Feb. 23, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a Republican presidential contender, promised a plan to induce the
US to produce as much energy as it uses in 20-30
years. Energy independence in his vision will come
from wind, solar energy, coal, and nuclear energy.
In the same month that these appeals for energy
independence came forth from political quarters, the
US Energy Information Administration produced an
enlightening forecast. During 2005-30, EIA said in
its Annual Energy Outlook 2007, the average reference-case growth rate for gross US imports of energy
will be 1.2%/year. This is not, by historic standards,
gangbuster growth. But any import growth indicates,
by definition, movement away from the achievement
of energy independence.
Indeed, energy independence means no imports. Zero. None. It means what Romney said:
domestic production equivalent to consumption.
To use figures from the EIA’s long-term projection again: The US will consume 131.16 quadrillion btu (quads) of energy in all primary forms
in 2030. It will produce 88.63 quads, requiring
imports totaling 46.37 quads before negligible
exports and small balancing quantities. To become
energy-independent, the US must lower consumption and raise production enough to turn that

import number to 0.
The challenge is considerable. EIA’s import
projection for 2030 represents a lot of energy. It’s
more than the amount of energy that EIA expects
the US to produce in that year in the forms of
crude oil and lease condensate plus natural gas
plant liquids plus dry natural gas plus nuclear
power. It’s slightly less than the amount of energy
that EIA expects the US to consume in that year as
coal plus nuclear power plus hydropower.
It’s this wide gap between consumption and
domestic production that the Democratic National
Committee thinks can be closed by “innovation,”
“diversifying energy sources,” “conservation,”
and all the rest. The favorite place to begin “innovation” these days is US agriculture and nearly
anywhere else that doesn’t involve oil, gas, or coal.
In these areas, EIA projects healthy average growth
rates over the next 25 years of 2.7%/year for biomass, 2.6%/year for other renewable energy, and
6.8%/year for other energy forms such as liquid
hydrogen, methanol, and otherwise unaccountedfor refinery inputs. Total energy production from
those sources: 7.82 quads. That’s 9% of total domestic production and 6% of projected consumption—up impressively from 2005 shares for these
energy forms of 5% of total production and 4% of
consumption.

What it takes
So what would it take to raise production of the
nonfossil energy forms politicians like and lower
total energy consumption enough to eliminate imports and achieve independence? In a word: money.
To be more precise about it: astronomical amounts
of money. To put that into perspective: more money
than taxpayers and energy consumers would tolerate. Because exotic energy sources cost more than
conventional sources do, production depends on
subsidies. And conservation beyond levels encouraged by the market can come only from officially
imposed costs. Eliminating energy imports this way
means raiding the national treasury and punishing
consumers. Americans will figure out what’s happening to them long before then.
Energy independence is an unrealizable dream.
It’s a pretense on which the government wastes
money. Politicians who promote it are fooling
themselves or trying to fool others. ✦

had significant problems with this type
of line. These also are the largest lowpressure lines in the country so their
problems were not typical,” he said.
A major consequence was the potential impact on supplies when the lines
were shut down during the summer for
repairs, Barrett continued. “Even though
we’re a safety agency, Congress wants us
to factor in reliability,” he said, noting
that PHMSA and the US Department
of Energy plan to jointly examine the
problem.
But Barrett emphasized that the
agency will continue to focus on safe

and efficient pipeline operations. “We
want operators to understand the condition of their lines through their own
inspection programs and take action.
I’m not certain how we’ll do this, but
one possibility is a two-tiered inspection program where we’d make an
initial evaluation and follow up with a
more detailed inspection if we find a
problem,” he said.
He considers making sure pipelines
operate safely a key element of US
energy security. “We’d like to reduce
congestion. We’re looking at new
construction and metallurgy to allow

80% SMYS [specified minimal yield
strength] instead of 70% so more gas
can be transported,” he said.
Barrett said PHMSA and pipelines
likely would play a major role in transporting alternative fuels. “We would
approach it from a safety perspective.
We have been talking to the National
Association of Fire Marshals and industry stakeholders,” he said.
“Pipelines move more oil and gas
than truck, rail, and vessel barge combined. So if you plan to move large volumes of an alternative fuel, you’ll need
pipelines to do it,” Barrett said. ✦

IOGCC: US petroleum workforce size increasing
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
Government and industry are making progress in increasing the number
of qualified petroleum professionals
in the US, says the Interstate Oil & Gas
Compact Commission in a new report.
Particularly encouraging is “evidence
of public-private partnerships at every
level,” IOGCC said. “The task force recommendations for establishing internships, scholarships, and other programs
designed to attract young people to
petroleum science careers have taken
root in all areas.”
The report, “Blue Ribbon Task Force:
A Follow Up Report,” updates the
results of a task force created by North
Dakota Gov. John Hoeven in 2001 to
investigate the shrinking numbers of
petroleum geologists, geophysicists,
and engineers in the US workforce. Following its analysis, the task force issued
recommendations to federal and state
governments, colleges and universities, the oil and gas industry, and other
groups for collaboration in counteracting the situation.
“The progress is encouraging,” said
Hoeven, who currently chairs IOGCC.
In 2001, the original task force
noted that enrollments in petroleum-related majors at US colleges and univer26

sities had decreased over many years.
The updated report, which IOGCC
issued Feb. 26, says that the number of
bachelor’s degrees awarded in petroleum engineering rose to 322 in 2005
from 260 in 2000, while the number of
geology degrees fell slightly to 3,300 in
2004 from nearly 3,500 in 2000.
“The imperatives for action in the
next 3-5 years include new directions
in public policy, education, and resource development and management,”
the report says.

Federal performance
Grading the various sectors’ performances, the IOGCC report finds that the
federal government has been strongest
in creating internships within federal
departments for geosciences graduates
and undergraduates, and in working
with other federal departments and the
IOGCC in a coordinated effort. However it was weakest in funding pilot
and research programs, advising the
IOGCC and its member states of available grants, and alerting them of similar
projects to avoid duplication.
Oil and gas research funding, a federal budget reduction target since 1989,
remained relatively flat from 2001 to
the present. “Of the $8 billion budgeted
in 2006 for energy R&D, only $65 million was slated for oil and gas R&D,”

noted the latest report, adding that the
109th Congress failed to approve the
fiscal 2007 budget altogether.
“To date, nothing is budgeted for oil
and gas R&D within the US Department
of Energy. All that remains is the $50
million allocated from royalty receipts
under the Energy Policy Act of 2005
for ultradeepwater and unconventional
hydrocarbon development,” IOGCC
report said.
Despite reduced funding, it continued, some interesting federal research
has occurred, including progress in
developing clean and renewable energy
sources by DOE’s fossil energy office, reduction of methane emissions
through DOE’s Natural Gas STAR initiative, and funding from DOE’s natural
gas and petroleum technology office for
a global partnership to reduce gas flaring and venting associated with crude
oil production.
The new IOGG report also notes
progress as other federal departments
and agencies have developed partnerships with the oil and gas industry.
These include the Department of the
Interior’s Bureau of Land Management
and Minerals Management Service,
which both have addressed royalty
regulations in ways designed to offer incentives; the Internal Revenue
Service, which revised rules applicable

State, industry progress
States have been strongest in involving their employment services, regulatory agencies and education entities into
oil and gas training and education, says
the report. States also have done well in
creating partnerships with the industry,
providing internships, continuing education for teachers, working with career
counselors, and funding of research.
They also reached out to the federal government through the Western Governors
Association and other groups.
“Progress in this sector has been
stronger overall. Of the IOGCC’s 37
state members, 30 reported positive activity toward improving the investment
climate for the petroleum industry in
their state,” the IOGCC’s new report
indicates.
The industry’s biggest contributions,
it says, have been to provide summer
jobs, reach out to high school and
college students, and develop scholarships and grant programs for employees
to extend their education. Oil and gas
executives also have alerted human
resources professionals of the need
for a sustained effort, and they financially supported public relations, public
education, and scholarship/internship
programs.
The popularity of summer job
and internship programs has soared
as sophomores make $4,000/month
and juniors and seniors make $5,600/
month, according to the report. “From
the students’ perspective, internships
not only help fund their college expenses, but they receive valuable training in
the various aspects of their chosen field.
From the companies’ perspective, they
are recruiting qualified people familiar
with their culture and operations,” it
says.

US

Department of the Interior
Insp. Gen. Earl E. Devaney intended to mention reforms that have
been implemented as well as problems he has identified at DOI when
he came before the House Natural
Resources Committee on Feb. 16. But
Republicans on the committee had
other ideas.
They charged that his report on
his office’s investigation of missing
price thresholds in federal deepwater
oil and gas leases issued in 1998 and
1999 was not balanced and omitted
several questions and documents.
Rep. Steve Pearce (R-NM), who
led the criticism, also questioned the
report’s conclusion that thresholds
were omitted by mistake, suggesting
instead that managers and employees
at the Minerals Management Service
and DOI decided in 1998 and 1999
that the thresholds were not necessary because oil prices were low.
“I don’t think there was doubledealing on the part of the Clinton administration. I don’t believe there was
inherent criminal activity. I simply
think they felt the price would never
reach a level where thresholds would
be needed,” Pearce said.

‘Never written down’
Devaney replied, “There never was
a policy. The practice of the department was to put addendums on these
leases, which included price thresholds. If there’s reference to a policy, it
probably refers to a statement by witnesses that there was a policy, but it
was never written down. My solicitor
has been searching frantically for a
written policy and hasn’t found one.”
Pearce characterized this as “policy
by innuendo” and asked Devaney if

he thought it would withstand a legal
challenge. Devaney declined to offer
an opinion, noting that he is not a
lawyer, but added that investigators
from his office have found similar
situations throughout DOI.
Their difference in opinion
regarding the price thresholds’
omission from the 1998 and 1999
deepwater leases was that Devaney
thought it apparently was a mistake
while Pearce suggested it could have
been casually deliberate–essentially,
omitting the thresholds because they
had not seemed to matter in the
past.

Strategy signal
Their exchanges signaled that
House Republicans intend to vigorously oppose Democrats’ efforts to
legislatively pressure holders of those
1998 and 1999 deepwater leases to
renegotiate terms.
“Based on your testimony in the
Senate and here today, there was no
statute to require inclusion of price
thresholds. There was no policy requiring their inclusion. There simply
was a deliberate omission,” Pearce
said toward the hearing’s conclusion.
“I don’t see where the Clinton
administration was so inept that it
would go 30 months after discovering the absence of price thresholds
before including them. I do see a bad
decision by the Clinton administration that assumed the price of oil
would not go above $28/bbl,” he
told Devaney.
Chairman Nick J. Rahall III (DW.Va.) said there would be more
hearings. “Something is amiss in this
program,” he said. “We will work to
find ways to find and remedy it.” ✦

du Pétrole (IFP) in its 2007 Panorama
presented in Paris last month. The tentative economic outlook also indicated
that gas markets would likely suffer
from interenergy competition, driven
by high prices.
IFP Pres. Olivier Appert said 2006
might be viewed as a year of transition,
correcting 2005 oil price excesses as oil
demand slowed, the call on OPEC stabilized, and non-OPEC supply increased by
nearly 1.4 million b/d—to 51 million
b/d.
The oil market presented signs of
short-term stabilization, with prices
remaining under $60/bbl. However,
beyond 2008, futures markets seem to
indicate sustained price hikes, taking
into account the forward price for West
Texas Intermediate crude, noted Appert.
While it plunged to a recent low, the
2012 forward price has “fallen by less
than half the short-term prices” as the
market players still perceive a future
production squeeze, he said.
The current slowdown in world oil
consumption conceals great regional
disparities, supporting higher longer-term
prices. Demand is down in all Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) countries, but it is
still strong in rapidly emerging countries,
including China (up 6.2% to 410,000
b/d). Demand also is rising in the Middle
East (up 5.4% by 330,000 b/d).
Although 2006 confirmed the
decline of mature areas like the North
Sea and a decrease of OECD output for
the fourth straight year, non-OPEC oil
production increased significantly elsewhere, namely in the Commonwealth
of Independent States, Latin America,
and Africa.

b/d/year to the end of the decade. This
forecast has been revised downwards to
700,000 b/d from 2009.
Production in many non-OPEC
countries is nearing peak, Appert said,
but OPEC’s influence and its output,
which would gain about 1 million b/d
over the 2006 figure, will be singularly
boosted by Angola’s joining OPEC, possibly followed by Sudan and Ecuador,
which are mulling such a move.
IFP estimates that OPEC’s share of
world oil production likely would jump
to 44% in 2009 from 41% last year,
while global oil demand increases by
4.8 million b/d. “Non-OPEC countries
will not be able, alone, to provide the
surplus needed in the medium-term,”
insisted Appert.
He also pointed to other factors
likely to push up oil prices beyond
2009, including resource nationalism
in a number of countries, growing domestic needs of oil exporting counties,
and determination of countries such as
Qatar to conserve resources for future
generations.

Natural gas
Uncertainties also are besetting the
gas industry, as higher prices and supply security in particular have impacted
the development of competing energies—oil, coal, and nuclear power—to
the detriment of natural gas, said
Marie-Françoise Chabrelie, secretary
general of Cedigaz.
She sees a “probably slower and
more-jerky development” for natural gas in the future. Gas use should
continue to rise steadily by an average
2.5%/year to 2010, pulled along by
Latin America, Asia-Oceania, Africa, and
the Middle East. The construction of additional gas production and transportation infrastructure to aid deliveries also
will contribute to increased gas usage.
Escalation of gas use should then
slow to 2.2%/year at best. Higher prices are boosting competition from other
energies, especially coal, in the power
industry in Europe, where several plants
are being planned with at least partial
carbon dioxide capture. These are due

on stream after 2010.
Also emerging are production constraints: lack of exploration and production investment in Russia; difficulties
with available gas volumes to supply
liquefaction facilities in some countries
such as Oman and Trinidad and Tobago;
technical problems in Indonesia; and
the political decisions of producing
countries as in Bolivia or Russia that
could jeopardize the future regional and
world supply balance.
Chabrelie also perceives growing
imbalances in international gas trade
between producing areas with surplus
supplies and OECD countries where
production can no longer satisfy demand. In addition to the huge volumes
transported from one area to another,
transportation management will become increasingly complex, exacerbated
by the proliferation of LNG routes. The
share of LNG in total gas trade is due
to rise sharply to 30% in 2015 from
22.3% in 2005 driven by flexibility,
source diversification, and improved
supply security. ✦

Japan voices
gas concerns

I

n a meeting with Russian Industry and Energy Minister Viktor
Khristenko, Japanese Foreign Minister
Taro Aso last week asked Russia to ensure Japan’s supply of LNG from the
Sakhalin-2 oil and natural gas project.
As you can imagine, given Russia’s
interests in the Asia-Pacific oil and gas
market, Khristenko gave an upbeat
reply, assuring Aso that terms of existing agreements would be observed.
Aso’s concerns are not unfounded,
given Russia’s treatment of the original Sakhalin-2 partners, including
two Japanese trading houses—Mitsui
& Co. and Mitsubishi Corp.—along
with Royal Dutch Shell PLC.
After sustained pressure—some
call it blackmail—from Russia’s environmental authorities, the three original Sakhalin-2 partners reluctantly
agreed last December to relinquish
more than half of their combined
stake in the project to OAO Gazprom
(OGJ, Jan. 1, 2007, p. 29).

Sleepless nights
The sale gave the state-owned Russian gas company a stake of 50% plus
one share in the project. The interests in the joint venture partnership,
called Sakhalin Energy Investment Co.
Ltd. (SEIC), now read as Gazprom
50% plus one share, Shell 27.5%,
Mitsui 12.5%, and Mitsubishi 10%.
The sale also caused sleepless
nights for some people in Japan
because it raised concerns about
whether the country’s electric and
gas companies would be able to procure LNG from the project as initially
agreed.
Since then, other Japanese firms
have tentatively signed up for supplies from Sakhalin-2. On Feb. 9,

for example, SEIC said it had signed
a heads of agreement with Japan’s
Osaka Gas Co. Ltd. for the supply of
some 200,000 tonnes/year of LNG
for more than 20 years.
The gas will be supplied from
SEIC’s new LNG plant at Prigorodnoye on the southern tip of Sakhalin
Island. The plant is about 95% complete, with the first deliveries expected next year, SEIC said in a statement.
We believe them, too, especially
Shell, Mitsubishi, and Mitsui.

Oz to the rescue
Not everyone is counting on Russian promises, though, and suppliers
elsewhere are reaping the benefits.
Indeed, Woodside Petroleum Ltd.,
operator of Australia’s North West
Shelf venture, announced Feb. 22 the
signing of a heads of agreement with
Japan’s Kyushu Electric Power Co. Inc.
In announcing the deal, Woodside
said all eight of the NWS venture’s
original Japanese LNG customers
have now renewed their long-term
LNG purchase commitments.
That’s not surprising since there’s
no sign of a Russian firm anywhere
on the Australian horizon, a point
underlined by Mitsunori Torihara,
president of Tokyo Gas Co., which
accounts for nearly 20% of Japan’s
total LNG imports.
“Besides Sakhalin-2,” Torihara
said in a recent interview, “we have
procurement contracts with five
production bases in Australia. There
is little political risk in Australia, and
we don’t have to worry about the risk
of over-concentration because each
of the bases has a different operating
company.” ✦

least April 2005, each of the defendants
engaged the services of a major international freight forwarding and customs
clearing company and, collectively, authorized that agent to make at least 378
corrupt payments totaling $2.1 million
to Nigerian Customs Service officials
to induce those officials to provide the
defendants with preferential treatment
during the customs process, DOJ said.
It said that this was the second time
that Vetco Gray UK has pled guilty to
violating the FCPA. On July 6, 2004, the
company, then named ABB Vetco Gray UK
Ltd., and an affiliated company pleaded
guilty to violating the antibribery provision of the FCPA in connection with the
payment of more than $1 million in
bribes to officials of NAPIMS, a Nigerian
government agency which evaluates and
approves potential bidders for contract
work on oil exploration projects.
ABB Vetco Gray UK Ltd. was renamed Vetco Gray UK Ltd. following an
acquisition by two private equity firms,
Candover and JP Morgan Partners, of
the upstream oil and gas businesses and
assets of its parent corporation, ABB
Handels-und Verwaltungs AG. The July
12, 2004, acquisition included the sale
of Vetco Gray UK and the predecessors
to the two other Vetco International
subsidiaries, which pleaded guilty in
the most recent case.
In anticipation of the acquisition, the
private equity firms requested and obtained an opinion release from DOJ that
required the new owners to institute and
implement a compliance system, internal
controls, training, and other procedures
sufficient to have deterred and detected
violations of the FCPA, among other
obligations, the federal agency said.
It said that the corrupt payments
underlying the latest guilty pleas
continued unabated from the period
prior to the acquisition until at least
mid-2005, despite the acquiring equity
firms’ commitments to DOJ under
the Opinion Release. The sale to new
owners, the prior directives issued by
DOJ, and Vetco Gray UK’s prior FCPA
conviction were all taken into account
under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines

in calculating the $12 million criminal
fine against Vetco Gray UK, DOJ said.
Resolution of the criminal case against
Vetco International and its subsidiaries
resulted, in large part, from the Houstonbased oilfield service and supply company
voluntarily disclosing the matter to DOJ
and the subsidiaries’ agreement to take
significant remedial steps.
In addition to the criminal fines,
DOJ said that the plea agreements also
require the defendants to: 1. Hire an
independent monitor to oversee the
creation and maintenance of a robust
compliance program. 2. Undertake
and complete an investigation of the
companies’ conduct in various other
countries as originally required under
FCPA Opinion Release No. 2004-02. 3.
Ensure that in the event that any of the
companies are sold, the sale shall bind
any future purchaser to the monitoring
and investigating obligations. ✦

S&P’s: Reﬁners face capacity upgrade challenges
The global refining industry faces
the challenges of upgrading its capacity to produce less-polluting fuels while
processing increased volumes of poorerquality crudes, Standard & Poor’s said in
a recent special report on fluctuating oil
prices.
More heavy and sour crude is coming onto the market, and the complex
process of refining this crude into fuels
that meet stricter low-sulfur regulations
is costly, S&P analysts said.
A growing price differential between light and heavy crudes will make
it harder for refiners as they process
greater volumes of lower-quality crude.
Consequently, refiners must find the
capital to fund enormous construction
demands, S&P analysts said.
Oil and gas prices continue to be

characterized by remarkable volatility,
yet the impact has been minimal to the
US economy so far, said David Wyss,
S&P’s chief economist, during a Feb. 27
conference call.
Oil prices would have to go higher
than they did in the past to damage the
economy, Wyss said. Greater energy
efficiency means oil is not as big a percentage of household spending as it has
been in the past, he added.
He expects oil prices to fluctuate
widely, noting that rising prices were not
a drag on the economy last year as some
economists had suggested. Likewise, he
does not expect recent falling oil prices
to boost the economy this year.
Wyss said his forecast is absent major
geopolitical events that cause dramatically swinging oil prices. ✦

this article suggests that there could
easily be 30% more oil than what is
currently estimated. Further, there is
large undiscovered potential as several
regions remain underexplored and others have not been explored at all.
The ultimately recoverable reserves
(URR) for the global offshore are close
to 1 trillion bbl. Over the decades, E&P
trends in the offshore have remained
highly encouraging, particularly given
that both yearly discoveries and average
field sizes have remained the same over
the last three decades.
Offshore is the next frontier in
global oil supply. It’s amazing what $50

Exploration trends show continued
promise in world’s offshore basins

The oil industry has expanded consistently over the last decades from land
operations to inland waterways and
then to offshore.
Offshore barges for exploration
began to be used in 1950, deepwater
drillships in 1956, and semisubmersible
rigs in 1964.
In the 1980s, deepwater exploration
meant 800 ft of water. Today, 1,500 ft
of water is considered shallow, 1,500 to
7,000 ft is considered deepwater, and
over 7,000 ft is termed ultradeep water.
Offshore oil production started in
the early 1940s and has grown from
a modest 1 million b/d in the 1960s
to nearly 25 million b/d in 2005 to
represent one third of world crude oil
production. Conversely, onshore crude
production needed six decades to reach
25 million b/d in 1963.
Unlike onshore oil production, offshore production has never experienced
sharp downward fluctuations and has
grown consistently over the years (Fig.
1). In fact, it has been the main source
of growth for world crude oil production as the onshore has essentially
remained at plateau for more than two
decades.
In 2005, the Persian Gulf/Middle
East topped the list of offshore producers, followed by the North Sea,
West Africa, the Gulf of Mexico (US
and Mexico), Asia/Australasia, Brazil,
China, Caspian,
and Russia/ArcFig. 1

Mexico is considered the single largest prospective province of this kind
remaining in the world. It has seen no
exploration whatsoever with only three
wells drilled in established areas.
Other deepwater provinces outside
the Big 4 have seen some successes (i.e.,
Australia, Malaysia, Mauritania, Ivory
Coast, China), but the global impact has
yet to be seen. The ultradeepwater play
has been much discussed following the
recent Jack well in the US gulf.
No attempt is made in this article to
evaluate the E&P record or address the
potential of the ultradeep worldwide, as
not enough information and history are
available. However two points are worth
making.
First, global prospectivity is very
unique to geological settings only so far
known in limited areas. Second, having
the technology to go to ultradeep water
does not mean one can go to any water
depth to explore. In most parts of the
world, 12,000 ft of water is touching
the edge of the continental shelf, beyond which no sedimentary rocks can
be expected.
Overall, measured in terms of cumulative exploration wells drilled and

have been the shallow US gulf, North

Production
Shell’s smart-field
vision has many intertwined technology and business
methodology components that extend
from downhole systems, to well surface
equipment, and to a variety of tools in
the office for analyzing and optimizing
production operations. A key prerequisite for implementing any integrated
smart-field system is the ability remotely to capture well and other critical asset
data and remotely to control processes
at the wellsite.
Shell worldwide has several on-going smart-field implementations. In two
major initiatives in West Africa—in Nigeria and Gabon, each implementation
has a different scope and objective.
Remote operations are critical in
any smart-field implementation. Because most, if not all, wells are remote

render the entire fiber link useless. For
such reasons, the petroleum industry
generally agrees that the only viable
option to link many remote sites is with
wireless technology.
Wireless technology, however, has
major obstacles in environments such
as West Africa, where dense and high
vegetation impede radio signals.
As a result, the industry requires a
new generation
of wireless technology to link
effectively these
remote wells to
the office.

other names.

these technologies can be implemented
at a fraction of the investment needed
for exploring, drilling, and producing
new fields.
In addition to these benefits, many
companies such as Shell Gabon face
major operational challenges and want
fully to automate their assets because of
the harsh nature of their environments.
Wells are too remote to reach, which
affects their ability to detect problems
such as well shut-in. Weather conditions
in such locations prevent operators
from visiting wells because of heavy
rains that go on for several days and
weeks at a time. In other Shell West Africa operations such as Nigeria, security
is major issue.

of weaker producers at headers.
The software does not use physical
models such as well tubing diameters,
roughness, fluid properties, near-wellbore skins, and presumed multiphase
flow correlations. It relates, however,
real-time well measurements to volumetric flows from test separators.
This data-driven approach has
proven robust and usable in oil and gas
production operations.
A key aspect of the software is
the deliberately disturbed well test
(DDWT), which is used to characterize
well performance. These tests go beyond
traditional production well testing. The
objective is to relate well production
(oil, gas, and water) to measured well
parameters such as flowing tubinghead

pressure, downhole pressure, gas-lift
injection rate, and temperature.
The emphasis is on capturing the
response of the well to step changes in
controllable parameters.
The upper screen in Fig. 2 shows
DDWT data in which five data sets
model the well. In the lower screen,
one can view the parameters used in
the respective models. The upper righthand panel provides a way to select
and deselected models to achieve a
best model fit.
Once created, the software uses the
individual well models to compute the
well production per stream. The software accumulates daily flow per well,
which reflects the actual producing
conditions, including trips and restarts,
and plant operating mode changes.
The software constructs a simplified abstract topography that relates
the wells to a calibration point (Fig. 3).
Typically that point is a bulk separator,
preferably providing oil, water, and gas

measurement on a continuous basis.
The software compares production data per well and reconciles the
production automatically against the
installation’s overall export meter. This
provides a reconciliation factor for each
produced and injected stream on a
continuous basis for the current day and
the last 24 hr.
The screen also has a diagnostics
panel alerting the user of production
systems events, such as event detection,
single-point measurements, or complex
logic to detect specific events such as
contamination of the water disposal
stream with oil. Another part of screen
provides an information panel that contains alerts on defective instruments and
communications infrastructure.
With this single screen, an asset
manager can gauge the current health
of the production systems. If all the
reconciliation factors are within acceptable bounds, the manager knows that

well models.
Normal operations provide a dynamic environment with well interventions, process trips, etc. If wells
exhibit stable production with minimal
dynamics, then software can introduce
dynamics. The software can choke wells
up or down for short periods to cause
transients to ripple through the process. It can introduce single or multiple
disturbances simultaneously. These
pseudo tests are known as deliberately
disturbed production tests (DDPT’s). If
these tests are insufficient to realign the
models, then the software initiates a full
DDWT.
The production software’s low
maintenance, data-driven, production
workflow-based (well test) modeling
approach contrasts with the harder to
sustain, specialized physical models
requiring frequent tuning by process
engineers. Building and upkeep of
physical models are hard to sustain.
Well tests that are a normal part of
oil and gas operation are the basis of
the production software model’s workflow. The software also is more tolerant
of errors in process measurements and
instrument drift over time.

mization was days if not weeks. With
the current version of the software,
optimization of a field is possible daily
or hourly from the office desktop.
With data being available in real
time, operators can detect quickly
underperforming wells and compensate for this by adjusting other wells or
opening up closed in wells.
The net result is that fields with the
software have reduced deferred production.
Implementation of the software has
reduced the time spent by production
technologists and operations engineers
on gathering and validating well data
and making decisions. This has allowed
redeployment of scarce staff to other
tasks. In one operation, a single operations engineer runs several fields where
previously the work required five staff
members.
With better well performance data,
short and medium-term forecasts become more accurate. This has become
evident in one particular field where
actual production is consistently 5%
above forecast. Previously the gap between forecast and actual was consistently a negative percentage.
The improved allocation of production to wells will influence the accuracy
of long-term forecasts from reservoir
simulators.
Several fields have reduced the variance in daily production. The peaks and
troughs have leveled off. This again is
thought to be a result from the attention paid to individual wells, daily field
review and optimization, and reduced
plant trips.
One field conducted no routine well
test for 15 months, but the production
software continued to run and track
well performance and adjust the well
models.
Other fields have seen a reduction
in well testing duration. With software
in place, more wells can be connected
to one test facility. This lowers costs in
the cases that the operations can have
a single test train instead of two trains.
Also the test separator can operate as a
bulk vessel or for well service activity
54

for longer periods.
The software also lets the operator
know when a well needs to have a well
test.
In another Shell operation, introduction of the software has reduced costs
by allowing release of one service and
transport vessel because operators no
longer have to visit regularly the remote
offshore location.
Fewer visits also lower health, safety,
and environmental risks.
The production software has become a catalyst, focusing attention on
the quality of production surveillance
instrumentation and measurement data.
The software is visible and used actively
from field to asset-manager level so
that problems with instrumentation or
measurements become readily apparent because of deviations between well
model predications and export flows.

pany installed RPCs from eProduction
Solutions (eP). A controller allows the
well to pump down to a minimal fluid
level and stops the pump when fluid
pound occurs.
The controller ensures that the pump
shuts off at the appropriate time and
calculates the appropriate idle time
from the changing run times. A desktop
analysis program, eP’s csBeam, optimizes run times and pump-off points.
The software provides up-to-date
surface dynamometer cards, downhole
cards, runtime statistics, and trends of
well parameters. With this information,
the well analyst fine-tunes the controller
to optimize production.

Results
Implementation of this program
increased production, decreased repair
costs, and lowered electrical costs. Several factors provided these benefits.
Lower fluid levels in a well decreases
backpressure on the reservoir and consequently increases production. Additionally, reduction in downtime lowered
repairs and ensured more pumping
time and ultimately, more produced
fluid.
Four wells that pumped off increased
oil production by about 200 bo/d/well.
Pumping the wells less than 24 hr
reduces average run time with no loss
in oil production. The pumps only run
when the barrel is full of fluid, about
5-10 min. This increases pump run life
by avoiding accelerated wear from fluid
pounding the pump.
In the long-term, this will reduce
downtime associated with pump repair,
thus reducing repair costs.
The work has arrested the field’s
production decline (Fig. 1) and the field
still has more wells to optimize.
The company continues to prioritize
target wells, execute the optimization
plan, and ensures that return on investment is weighted early in the project.
This provides an early payout for the
project.
The combination of well design,
hardware at the wellsite, analysis software at the desktop, training of the well

analysts, and corporate commitment
to implement the program benefited
field profitability in both the short and
long-term.
The company also has other rod
pumped fields in Sumatra that could
benefit from this type of automation. ✦

On Jan. 3, 2007,
the US Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA)
published a proposed
rule in the Federal Register that would eliminate
Environment
its “once in, always in”
policy on maximum
achievable control technology (MACT)
standards.1 If promulgated, reversal of
this decade-old policy will allow facilities currently subject to MACT standards to be exempt from MACT upon
reducing emissions below major source
thresholds for hazardous air pollutants
(HAPs).
Under existing policy, if a facility is
a “major source” of HAP emissions on
the first substantive compliance date
of the MACT standard, it will always
be subject to the MACT standard. With
several MACT standards already in place
for the oil and gas industry and others
being considered, the new rule would

how best to control HAP emissions,

The memorandum indicated that

One such timing question involved
facilities that were subject to a MACT

fense Council (NRDC) publicly released
the draft proposed rule in April 2006,
claiming that the rule would “weaken
nearly 100 toxic air pollution standards
and allow industrial plants across the
country to emit significantly greater
amount of toxins.”4
The preamble to the Jan. 3, 2007,
proposal differs from the draft released
by NRDC in April 2006 by being less
dismissive of earlier criticisms and inviting public comment on those topics
that have raised so much controversy.
In addition, the proposed rule contains some additional caveats regarding
switching from a major source to an
area source and reverting from area
source back to a major source.
EPA currently proposes replacing
the May 16, 1995, “once in, always in”
policy with amendments to 40 CFR
Part 63.5 The regulatory amendments,
if made final after the public notice and
comment period, will “allow a major
source of HAP emissions to become an
area source at any time by limiting its
PTE [potential to emit] for HAPs below
the major source thresholds.”1
According to EPA, “there is nothing
in the CAA that compels the conclusion that a source cannot attain area
source status after the first substantive
compliance date of a MACT standard,”
and that the US Congress “placed no
temporal limitations on the determination of whether a source emits or has
the potential to emit HAPs in sufficient
quantity to qualify as a major source.”1
EPA contends that its proposed
amendments are wholly consistent with
the Clean Air Act’s definition of “major
source” found in Section 112(a)(1) of
the CAA and solicits comment on this
position.
EPA justifies the proposed amendments, explaining that it has received
feedback from the State and Territorial
Air Pollution Program Administrators
and the Local Air Pollution Control Officials that the “once in, always in” policy
“provides no incentive for sources, after
the first substantive compliance date
for a MACT standard, to implement

or less-stringent area source standards
if the first substantive compliance date
has passed. If different emission control
points, however, are controlled or different controls are necessary to comply
with the area source standard or other
physical changes are needed to comply
with the standard, additional time, not
to exceed 3 years, may be granted by
the permitting authority if adequate
supporting data is provided by the

Lastly, major sources that are subject
to enforcement actions or investigations cannot escape liability by becoming area sources. Similarly, becoming a
major source does not absolve a source

subject to an enforcement action or
investigation for area source violations
or infractions.
EPA’s proposal to eliminate the
“once in, always in” policy is a welcome change that will offer facilities
greater flexibility in reducing HAP
emissions. Environmental organizations

will oppose the proposed amendments,
arguing that industry sources currently
meeting MACT standards will increase
emissions so as barely to fall below the
current HAPs thresholds.

concerns and seeks comments that

DECOMMISSIONING—
Conclusion

It is essential that
pipeline regulators
considering risk-based
remediation plans
understand early the
nature and complexity
Pipelines
of the risk assessment to
be performed as part of
abandonment and whether or not this
approach is conducive to unconditional
closure of a
site.
In Canada, such
understanding is
particularly
important
when an application for abandonment
pursuant to the National Energy Board
(NEB) Act is being considered, as the
Board’s jurisdiction terminates as soon
as a pipeline is legally abandoned. If the
risk-based remediation plan is considered a mitigation measure pursuant to
Section 20 of the CEA Act, then the NEB
still has a responsibility to ensure that it
is implemented.
Parts 1 and 2 of this series provided
an overview of the NEB’s regulatory
requirements and responsibilities with
respect to pipeline abandonment and
a detailed examination of the Yukon
Pipeline Ltd. (YPL) abandonment and
remediation in terms of the pipe and
pumping stations.
This concluding article looks at
abandonment and remediation of the
pipeline’s tank farm and discusses the
practical lessons that can be drawn from
the YPL abandonment.

Instead of lowering the SSRSs to
values that would protect human health
and the environment without imposing
further conditions (possibly necessitating further soil remediation), YPL left
the SSRSs for soil as is and introduced
new SSRSs for vapors in conjunction
with monitoring requirements and
engineering controls for the proposed
new homes.11
YPL has not performed remediation activity for soils deeper than 3 m

before implementing any changes.15 The
submitted risk assessment is a topic of
ongoing technical debate between YPL
and other interested parties and has not
been approved to date.16 17
YPL resumed groundwater monitoring at the UTF in June 2005, following
a 3-year hiatus, and liquid hydrocarbons (0.57 m thick) were detected on
the groundwater table in BH96-01 for
the first time since late 2000. Although
subsequent monitoring events have
detected no liquid hydrocarbons, the
discovery raised questions with respect
to understanding and delineation of the
liquid hydrocarbon plume or plumes
and reset the clock with respect to
YPL’s monitoring commitments for site
closure.18

Issues, concerns
The UTF’s visibility within Whitehorse, potential real estate value (due to
its central location and thick overburden), and potential for residential redevelopment have exposed it to ongoing
public interest and stakeholder scrutiny.
The UTF abandonment presents
many technical logistical, and regulatory challenges. Technical challenges
revolve around adequate characterization and understanding of this site
to support the risk-based decisions
contemplated.
Subsurface vapor migration, delineation of impacted soils at depth,
characterization of the groundwater
flow regime, demonstration of natural
attenuation, and identification and delineation of liquid hydrocarbon plumes
remain topics of discussion and debate
between the NEB, YPL, and others.
Underlying these topics of discussion
is the deeper question of what level of
detail is sufficient for YPL and regulators
to feel confident in their decisions with
respect to protection of human health
and the environment, particularly considering the potential for single-family
residential redevelopment.
Logistical difficulties include the
large size of the site, the large depth to

inputs into risk-based environmental
models. The regulations, standards, or
guidelines also typically contain mechanisms for tweaking generic criteria
through input of site-specific parameters, or for implementing full-blown
risk assessment or risk management.
The more complex the adjustment,
the better the understanding of the site
required, the more long-term control
over the site required, and the more
important full participation becomes.
Characterization of the site must be
sufficient to support the risk-based
decisions being made.
In response to its responsibilities under the CEA Act, NEB can delay
leave-to-abandon from coming into
force until environmental mitigation
measures have been implemented. This
might be counterproductive, however,
when proponents seek to implement
appropriate long-term risk management
measures while redeveloping former
pipeline property after leave-to-abandon is in force.
Completion of as much of the site
characterization and risk-assessment
work before applying to abandon the
facilities would enable more informed
decisions with respect to potential
issues, impediments, and costs. In particular, the scope of the risk assessment
and timeframe of the risk-management
measures being proposed should be
well understood.
Options available to NEB might then
include limiting the scope of risk assessment and management to measures
it can ensure are implemented before
formal abandonment, or working with
other applicable regulatory agencies to
ensure risk assessment and management
measures are implemented within their
regulatory frameworks and under their
regulatory oversight (pursuant to paragraph 20(1.1)(b) of the CEA Act).
The latter option would depend on
the jurisdictional boundaries and regulatory framework of the agencies involved and would require establishment
of appropriate regulatory roles and responsibilities early in the abandonment
process; requiring further analysis with

respect to legal and logistical issues.
Operators and regulators alike
should consider the following lessons
from the YPL case when approaching
future abandonments, particularly when
contaminated site risk assessment and
management is contemplated:
• Companies should complete as
much as possible of the site characterization and risk-assessment work before
applying to abandon the facilities.
• Site characterization must be sufficient to support the risk-based decisions being made.
• Roles and responsibilities of involved regulators should be determined
early in the abandonment process.
• Companies and involved regulators
should identify as early as possible the
nature and complexity of any proposed
risk assessment and management and
evaluate whether the approach is conducive to unconditional site closure.
• The regulator may need to limit
the scope of acceptable risk assessment and management to measures
it can ensure are implemented before
formal abandonment, or work with
other regulators to ensure risk assessment and management measures can
be implemented within their regulatory
frameworks and under their regulatory
oversight.
• The abandonment process, including regulatory decisions and conditions,
should incorporate appropriate adaptability to address changing circumstances over the course of an abandonment project. ✦

Know-how interfaced to offer imaging while drilling
Sperry Drilling Services, a brand of
Halliburton’s Drilling and Formation
Evaluation division, and IntelliServ Inc., a
wholly owned subsidiary of Grant Prideco
Inc., all of Houston, have interfaced their
know-how and successfully tested a system
using IntelliServ network drillstring telemetry to transfer all the data and information generated by downhole drilling and
formation evaluation tools to the surface in
real time.
The firms say the data transfer is
achieved at rates as much as 10,000 times
those available today.
Use of the IntelliServ network, which
is fully compatible with Sperry’s INSITE
logging-while-drilling services, offers new
drilling and formation evaluation capabilities, including transmission of highresolution images of the subsurface in real
time.
Today’s drilling rates can be limited by

the transmission speed of high volume
data collected during the drilling and
evaluation process, Sperry Drilling Services
notes. With the IntelliServ technology,
this limitation is eliminated while also
enabling a new range of logging-whiledrilling services.
Halliburton and IntelliServ Inc. have
entered into an agreement to market and
deploy their respective technologies globally to joint customers.

Want lower oil
imports? Expand
federal leasing
The White House, Senate, and House
of Representatives all want to reduce US
dependency on foreign oil—in the most
expensive ways possible.
In energy initiatives this year, they all
bow at the altar of national energy security.
A sense-of-Congress bill that the Senate passed in January lists ﬁrst among its
purposes “to enhance the security of the
United States by reducing the dependence

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

of the United States on foreign and unsustainable energy sources.”
Legislation passed by the House in
January promises “to reduce our nation’s
dependency on foreign oil by investing in
clean, renewable, and alternative energy
resources.”
In his state of the union address, President George W. Bush declared, “For too
long our nation has been dependent on
foreign oil.”
Not one of them mentions increased
leasing of the Outer Continental Shelf or
of the tiny part of Alaska’s Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge that might someday become accessible to producers.
Bush, who pushed unsuccessfully for
ANWR leasing when his political party controlled Congress, in January gave US petroleum a quick—and this year lonely—salute,
saying, before rushing on to other subjects,
“We must step up domestic oil production
in environmentally sensitive ways.”
With Democrats controlling Congress, of
course, expanded leasing of federal land is
a futile hope. All current proposals promising to cut US dependency on foreign oil
therefore dedicate themselves to government expenditure on costlier energy forms.
Ethanol receives a 51¢/gal blending tax
credit and comes from grain that receives
government price supports. Its increasing
use is raising the price of corn.
Biodiesel beneﬁts from tax credits of
50¢-$1/gal, depending on feedstock, some
types of which also enjoy price supports.
By contrast, production of oil and gas
from newly leased federal land wouldn’t
cost the government anything. In fact,
it would generate federal revenue from
bonuses, rentals, and royalties. It also could
come to market in much greater quantity much quicker than the agrifuels now
adored by politicians.
As long as expanded oil and gas leasing
of federal land remains politically improbable, utterances about foreign oil and
national security should not be taken seriously. They are, in fact, hypocritical.

Crude futures price tops $61/bbl
The April contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes blew past $61/bbl to a
7-week high in intraday trade Feb. 22 in New York, following reports of a precipitous
drop in US gasoline inventories and stronger deﬁance by Iran of the United Nations
deadline to end its uranium enrichment program.
UN ofﬁcials said Iran ignored earlier sanctions for noncompliance and proceeded
with the installation of a centrifuge and construction of a heavy-water reactor.
Taking the front-month position in the Feb. 21 trading session, the April contract
climbed past $60/bbl for the ﬁrst time in 2007 to close at $60.07/bbl that day. It
traded at $59.61-61.25/bbl before closing at $60.95/bbl Feb. 22.
“Oil prices have extended the rally off the lows to more than 20%. With a global
tightening in progress combined with disappointing non-OPEC supply news, strong
demand, and a worsening geopolitical background, we expect the push-up to continue further,” said Paul Horsnell at Barclays Capital Inc., London.
Olivier Jakob, managing director of Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland, said,
“The [previous $57-60/bbl trading] range on crude oil has now been broken, and
with higher highs and lows [and a] higher closing trading above the moving averages, the positive momentum is back into oil and should attract further momentum
investment.” With market resistance to crude prices of $60.80-$61/bbl now broken,
Jakob said, the next major level of resistance would be $63.80/bbl.
The Energy Information Administration reported commercial US crude inventories jumped by 3.7 million bbl to 327.6 million bbl in the week ended Feb. 16 after
dropping a total 1 million bbl over the 2 prior weeks. US gasoline stocks fell by 3.1
million bbl to 222.1 million bbl in the same week. Distillate fuel inventories dropped
5 million bbl to 128.3 million bbl.
“The latest US weekly data are again extremely strong, with product inventories
falling by 7.6 million bbl relative to their 5-year average. Demand remains strong
across the board, with distillate and total demand both running at all-time record
levels,” Horsnell said. “Gasoline inventories have continued to come back closer into
bounds, while heating oil inventories are now below their 5-year average. With 2
months of draws still expected, heating oil inventories are likely to ﬁnish the season
well below last year’s level, and they stand a reasonable chance of ﬁnishing below
the 5-year average.”
EIA’s weekly statistics “are showing that in terms of days of cover the whole US
complex is now below last year,” Jakob said. “While most of the focus is on gasoline
and middle distillate, the days of cover for the same week in kerosine are the lowest
since 1997, and stocks of residual fuel oil have been steadily drawing back to below
last year.”
Jakob suggested gains in the energy market “need to be put in the context of a
global commodity rally where corn closed at 10-year highs” Feb. 21-22, while gold
futures prices were “at the highest level since May-June.” Corn is the primary feedstock for the US manufacture of ethanol, a gasoline additive and the primary ingredient in the 85-15% blend of ethanol and gasoline to create the E-85 alternative fuel.
Natural gas outlook
EIA also reported the withdrawal of 223 bcf of natural gas from US underground
storage in the week ended Feb. 16. That was at the low end of the consensus among
Wall Street analysts and compared with withdrawals of 259 bcf the previous week
and 123 bcf during the same period a year ago. It left a little less than 1.9 tcf of gas in
storage, down by 296 bcf from levels at this time a year ago but 182 bcf above the 5year average. US temperatures during that week were just over 30% colder than last
year and the 10-year average, but nearly 8% warmer than the prior week.
The consensus estimate of 2% growth in US natural gas production in 2007 is
“too optimistic,” said Adam Sieminski of Deutsche Bank AG, New York. “Hurricaneadjusted US gas production has risen by only 1 bcfd over the past year in the Lower
48 states. This represents just 1% output growth despite 16% growth in the rig
count,” he said. Meanwhile, big production jumps in Wyoming in October-November
“actually seem to be masking stagnation or month-to-month declines in Louisiana,
Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas,” Sieminski said. “We see a strong likelihood
that North American gas production will disappoint this year, given a stagnating US
rig count, accelerating decline rates, and behind-the-scenes braking by the private
operators.”

Performance is Key

When Key Energy Services pulls on to your site, you can be sure
we’ve done everything possible to prepare for the job at hand.
The industry’s most comprehensive rig remanufacturing program
makes high efﬁciency jobs possible each and every time.
Well-maintained equipment. Talented, experienced rig personnel.
Advanced technology and more. That’s Key Energy Services.

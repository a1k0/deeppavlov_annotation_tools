Is CP worthless?

What kind of question is this?
Most in the pipeline industry
agree that cathodic protection
(CP) is the smart way to provide
backup corrosion protection on
underground pipelines.
But consider: If you use solid film
backed corrosion coatings, you may
be wasting money by adding CP to
the pipeline.
There is a common sense reason for
this statement. CP systems protect
pipelines by delivering electrical
current to the steel surface. Solid
film back corrosion coatings have
the property of resistivity, which
means they block electrical current.
This blocking effect is called
cathodic shielding.
The phenomenon of cathodic
shielding, or blocking of protective
CP current, has been the subject of
dozens of technical papers since the
mid 1980’s. You can review a cross
section of these papers on
Polyguard’s website.You can also

Phone: (1) 214.515.5000
www.polyguardproducts.com

view a 10 minute explanation of the
cathodic shielding process.
Worldwide, we estimate that over
half of pipelines are being coated
with solid film back coatings, such as
shrink sleeves, tapes, and 2 or 3 layer
systems. Most of these lines have CP
systems. These are the operators who
may be wasting their money on CP.
Moreover, many install shielding
coatings on girth welds, the most
vulnerable area for corrosion.
Two corrosion coatings are proven
to be non-shielding, and allow
passage of protective CP currents.
One of these coatings is FBE. The
other is Polyguard RD-6.
NACE SP0169-2007 states: “Materials
… that create electrical shielding
should not be used on the pipeline” 1.
49 CFR §192.461 states:
“External protective coating …must
…have properties compatible with any
supplemental cathodic protection.” 2

If you are concerned that your
organization is behind this curve, we
recommend:
1. Visit
polyguardproducts.com/failsafecoating.htm
and review the large body of information
about shielding problems.
2. Talk to operators who have used
Polyguard’s RD-6 system. (There are
many) Ask them if they know of any
serious corrosion or SCC ever found
under RD-6. (We don’t, even after 19
years and thousands of installations).
3. Have someone in your organization attend
the NACE course “Coatings in Conjunction
with Cathodic Protection”.

1. NACE SP0169-2007 “Control of External
Corrosion on Underground or Submergeed
Metallic Piping Systems”.
2. 49 CFR Ch.1 (§192.461 see also §195.559)

Polyguard has been ISO 9000 certified since 1996.

What is
reliability worth?
For operators,
it’s not damaging the
formation during
well operations.

Industry Challenge
Control fluid loss to the formation during electric submersible pump
(ESP) installation, TCP operations, gravel-pack operations or while
performing clean outs, tubing changes, etc.
Halliburton Solution
Used to prevent damage to the reservoir during well completion and
workover operations, LO-Gard® service is a solids-free, low-viscosity,
fluid-loss control system that’s applicable over a broad range of
temperatures and permeabilities.
Operator Benefit
• Avoiding formation damage during completion and workover ops
• Maintaining a hydrostatic fluid column for well control
• No breaker agent required
Because LO-Gard service’s chemical composition impedes water flow
not hydrocarbon flow, it can be left in the well.
Operator Results
In a recent West Africa job, fluid loss was cut by 90 percentage while
changing out the ESP. Plus, there was no change in hydrocarbon production
after the LO-Gard treatment.

innovation, visit www.halliburton.com/reliability or e-mail us at

IEA cuts 2008, 2009 world oil demand forecasts
The International Energy Agency has reduced its outlook for
2008 and 2009 world oil demand, citing weaker-than-expected oil
deliveries in member countries of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development.
In its latest monthly Oil Market Report IEA says that worldwide
oil demand will average 86.8 million b/d this year. This is revised
from the agency’s previous forecast of 86.9 million b/d.
And IEA now sees 2009 oil demand averaging 87.6 million b/d,
down from the estimate of 87.8 million b/d released a month
ago.
Oil demand in the OECD will average 48.4 million b/d in 2008,
down 800,000 b/d from last year and 47.9 million b/d in 2009.
These figures are lower than previous estimates as a result of significant revisions in both North America and the Pacific, IEA said.
The Paris-based agency said data suggest that weaker economic conditions and high prices during this past summer, when oil
prices reached an all-time peak, had more of an impact on demand
than expected, notably in the US.
Further, the report said that oil demand in the US may be poised
for a more permanent downward trend amid sustained high prices
and sluggish economic activity.
IEA forecasts that non-OECD oil demand will average 38.3 million b/d in 2008, up 4% from 2007 and 50,000 b/d higher than
previously estimated. Next year’s demand is pegged at an average
39.8 million b/d, 20,000 b/d higher than in the agency’s last report.
These upward revisions are mostly related to a reassessment of
China’s third-quarter 2008 demand, gas oil use in India, and fuel
oil consumption in Iran, IEA said.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Citing Tropical Storms Fay and Hanna, Hurricane Gustav, and
the approach of Hurricane Ike, EPA exercised its authority under
the Clean Air Act to grant the Florida waiver, which allows greater
flexibility for the fuel distribution system.
EPA granted the waiver in coordination with the US Department
of Energy following a request from the state of Florida. The waiver
affects the following South Florida counties: Broward, Dade, Duval,
Hillsborough, Palm Beach, and Pinellas.
Previously, the EPA waived certain federal fuel requirements for
parts of Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, and North Carolina through
Sept. 15.
The temporary waivers apply to the Reid vapor pressure gasoline volatility requirements that apply in certain areas. Gasoline
volatility standards are imposed during summer months to help
control emissions from motor vehicles. Waivers allow the sale of
available supplies of conventional gasoline that have higher volatility limits.

Institutes to map European gas shale sites

Three European institutes—Potsdam-based GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences, France’s Institut Francais du Petrole
(IFP), and Holland’s TNO—are establishing a consortium of 15-16
university institutes and energy centers to be launched in late September to carry out a 6-year program to map possible gas shale
sites in various European countries.
IFP Francois Laurant, project manager at IFP in charge of basin
modeling, told OGJ that in France, deposits could be found in the
Aquitaine basin, most likely in source rocks of oil fields; in the
Southern Alps area in southeastern France; and the Paris basin.
He said there are black shale fields rich in organic sedimentary
matter in England, southern Sweden, Ukraine, Poland, and elseEPA approves hurricane-related fuel waivers

Total signs exploration agreements with Syria
Total SA has signed three oil and gas agreements with Syria that
will strengthen the group’s long-term presence in the country, according to Chief Executive Christophe de Margerie.
The three agreements “pave the way for increased cooperation
between Total and Syria and bolster our operations in partnership
with the national oil companies of this country,” De Margerie said,
while accompanying French President Nicolas Sarkozy on a trip to
Syria (OGJ Online, Sept. 2, 2008).

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

The first agreement renews the Deir Ezzor oil license, wholly
owned by Total and jointly operated by Total and the state-owned
Syrian Petroleum Co (SPC) via the Deir Ezzor Petroleum Co. joint
venture.
Total said the license for Deir Ezzor was extended for 10 years
to 2021, and that the extension will enable the French firm to
prolong and optimize production from the Jafra, Qahar, and Atalla
fields.
Discussions between the two sides began in early April over the

Total U.S. propane inventories were up by 7% in
June 2008 as compared to June 2007. That’s an
additional 2.85 millions barrels of propane available
to the market relative to the same time last year. But
you already knew that because you subscribe to API’s

including Gendalo, Maha, Gandang, Gehem, and Ranggas.
“The government has approved the POD [plan of development], and the company may now start operations,” said Evita H.
Legowo, director general for oil and gas at the ministry for energy
and mineral resources.
Gendalo, Maha, and Gendang fields form part of the Ganal
Block concession operated by Chevron Ganal Ltd., while Ranggas
and Gehem fields are on the Rapak Block operated by contractor
Chevron Rapak Ltd.
According to a statement released by the ministry, Chevron is
required to file a report with the ministry’s directorate general of
oil and gas on progress once every 6 months.
The ministry also said Chevron is required to file any changes it
might undertake in its development scenario, back-up plans, production levels, or investment costs.
“This will be the country’s first deep-sea drilling project,” said
Edy Hermantoro, upstream director at the ministry, who added that
parts of the fields lay in concession areas operated separately by
Chevron and Eni SPA.
Without elaborating, Edy said the POD in the area will “integrate and involve both companies.”

GDF Suez has taken a foothold in Azerbaijan by acquiring a 15%
stake in the offshore exploration-production license D-222 in the
Caspian Sea, owned 65% by Lukoil Overseas and 20% by the national Azeri company SOCAR. It contains the Yalama prospect due
to be drilled early 2009.

Aramco begins Khursaniyah ﬁeld production
Saudi Aramco, which earlier had to delay a planned start-up,
has begun production from its Khursaniyah oil field, according to
company officials. Production volumes could eventually ramp up
to as much as 500,000 b/d.
“The facility is operational and producing crude,” a Saudi Aramco official told Saudi Arabia’s Arab News. “Its production rates are
dependent on our company’s monthly production targets for each
facility,” the source said.
Khursaniyah production, scheduled to begin in December

2007, was delayed due to global material shortages suffered in the
construction of its associated gas processing plant.
The new production, which will be welcomed by markets, is
part of the Saudi government’s larger initiative to boost the country’s oil and gas output.
Saudi Arabia, reported to be investing some $90 billion of its oil
revenue to further develop production capacity, hopes to increase
oil production capacity to 12.5 million b/d and double its refining
capacity to 6 million b/d by 2009.

Pakistan reﬁnery output drops as issues rise
Pakistan refineries reduced gasoline production this month following drastic changes in the pricing formula, the availability of
enough stocks, and a slight drop in consumption.
According to Pakistan Oil Companies Advisory Committee (OCAC), National Refinery Ltd. reduced production to
9,000-10,000 tonnes/month from 12,000-13,000 tonnes, and
Pakistan Refinery Ltd. (PRL) has cut its monthly production to
7,500 tonnes from 10,000 tonnes. Attock Refinery Ltd. is reported to have slashed production to 21,000-22,000 tonnes from
27,000 tonnes, followed by Bosicor Refinery to 4,000 tonnes from
6,000-7000 tonnes.
OCAC sources, however, ruled out any immediate impact on
consumers after falling production because petrol stocks are well
above the consumption level. Its impact may be felt in the future,
however, they added.
PRL general manager, commercial and corporate affairs, Aftab
Husain said the new pricing formula for petrol has some anomalies
that need to be rectified.

UOP raises reﬁning, petrochemical catalyst prices
UOP LLC reported it will increase prices for all of its catalysts
used in refining and petrochemical production.
Increases of as much as 15% affect its Platforming, Penex, Unicracking, and Merox refining catalysts as well as its Parex, Isomar,
Tatoray, Pacol, Oleflex, Q-Max, and EBOne petrochemical catalysts.
UOP said it is raising prices due to “the continued high cost of
energy, packaging, and rising raw material prices.” Price increases
vary by the type of product.

Idemitsu ups product exports as local demand sags
Idemitsu Kosan Co., faced with declining domestic demand
in its Asian markets, has signed an initial contract with Petroleos

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
Mexicanos subsidiary PMI Trading Ltd. to supply it with 200,000
kl/year of gas oil.
Because of decreasing domestic demand in Japan and reduced
demand from China, Idemitsu said it planned to refine 7.5 million
kl of crude during October-December, down 1.2 million kl from
the year earlier period.
Most of the reduction will come from planned maintenance on
Idemitsu’s 120,000 b/d Tokuyama refinery while its other three
refineries will operate at lower rates to keep inventories at proper
levels. Altogether, the four refineries produce some 640,000 b/d
of oil products.
Idemitsu’s lower production reflects a recent 10% decline in
the company’s domestic gasoline sales, in addition to reduced demand for other products, such as diesel for trucks and buses, and
kerosine.
While Japan’s reduced demand is due largely to environmental
factors, sales in China also have fallen because of a downturn in the
US economy, which has been a major international consumer of
goods produced by Chinese factories.
As a result of Idemitsu’s reduced sales into Asian markets, company officials said it plans to increase oil products exports to Latin
America generally and Mexico in particular.
“There is certain demand for gas oil from resources-producing
countries in Central and South America” such as Mexico and Chile,
said Takashi Tsukioka, an Idemitsu supply director.
Besides its gas oil contract with PMI Trading, Idemitsu also plans
to export gasoline to Mexico and now is in talks with the Mexican
government over specifications. “We are telling them that Japanese
specifications are fine (for Mexico),” said Idemitsu sales director
Seiji Fukunaga.
For its part, Mexico has increased its imports of oil products as
the Pemex refinery system produced 1.5 million b/d of gasoline,
diesel, and other fuels in January-July of this year, while imports

Indonesia, Inpex discuss LNG terminal construction
Indonesia is conducting talks with Inpex Holdings Inc. aimed at
having the Japanese firm construct the world’s first offshore LNG
terminal as part of its development of the Masela offshore gas field
in the Timor Sea near the maritime border with Australia.
Indonesian officials, who are making construction of the terminal a condition for the development project, said development
could begin as early as November, assuming that a final agreement
is reached.
Discussion are said to be complicated by the fact that Indonesia,
Japan’s main supplier of LNG, is taking a hard line.
Inpex, which holds a 100% stake in the block, had hoped to lay
a pipeline from the field to the northern coast of Australia and then
use an LNG terminal there to export the gas.
However, Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources instead proposed construction of the offshore terminal due to
what it claims are the difficulties involved in laying pipe through
a deep trench.
The proposed offshore LNG terminal would produce some 4-5
million tonnes a year and would begin operations in 2015 or later,
according to the ministry. It added that the cost of building the
proposed offshore terminal would reach $14 billion—about twice
as much as a landside terminal in Australia.
The Japanese firm, which believes construction of an offshore
terminal would be both difficult and costly, said negotiations are
under way and that that nothing final has been decided.

Shell approved to gather associated gas in Basra
The Iraqi government has approved Royal Dutch Shell’s Iraq
Gas Master Plan, paving the way for the firm to invest some $3-4
billion to gather 500-600 MMcfd of associated natural gas in the
southern part of the country.
“The Council of Ministers, in an exceptional session, decided to
approve an agreement of principles with Shell to invest in the natural gas adjoining oil drilling in Basra,” the government said.
Shell will establish a joint-venture company with Iraq’s stateowned South Oil Co. (SOC) to execute the gathering, treatment,
and monetization operation. SOC will hold a 51% majority stake,
while Shell will hold 49%.
The agreement enables rapid development of Iraq’s associated
gas resources, most of which are being burned off. While Iraq’s
domestic power industry will use most of the gas; other volumes
could be exported as LNG via a floating liquefaction facility off
Basra.
According to analyst Global Insight, Shell’s involvement in the
south could place it in a favorable position for similar associated gas production deals in Iraq’s Kirkuk area and perhaps Missan
province.
10

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

The analyst said the agreement holds “vast potential for Shell
and Iraq alike,” to move away from wasteful flaring of gas—which
the country has no infrastructure or know-how to monetize—to a
lucrative opportunity to supply domestic markets and earn export
revenues.

Origin, ConocoPhillips partner in CSG-LNG project
Sydney-based Origin Energy Ltd. has shunned British suitor BG
Group by selecting US major ConocoPhillips as operating partner
in its four-train coal seam methane (CSG) and LNG project proposed for Gladstone in Queensland.
The move means that Origin has hooked up with a major LNG
player with operational, marketing, and technological expertise
but no interest in Origin’s domestic gas and electricity business
and hence an unlikely candidate for a takeover move against Origin.
The deal, announced Sept. 7, specifies that ConocoPhillips will
pay as much as $9.6 billion (Aus.) for a 50% share in the CSGLNG joint venture. This values Origin’s 3P CSM reserves at $1.88/
gigajoule.
Origin will act as the upstream coal seam gas supplier to the
project while ConocoPhillips will be the downstream LNG operator. The 50:50 joint venture formed by the two companies will
market the LNG, probably to Asian markets.
The deal involves an upfront payment by ConocoPhillips of $6
billion plus an additional $1.15 billion to carry Origin’s share of
the costs to final investment decision for an initial 2-train project—
a decision expected by yearend 2010. There also will be four additional payments of $525 million when each of the four LNG
trains is approved.
The first two trains each will have a capacity of 3.5 million
tonnes/year of LNG and are scheduled to come on stream in
2014.
A full four-train development will need a total of about 24 tcf of
gas over a 30-year period. That translates into about 20,500 wells
needed to supply the LNG development and Origin’s existing supply agreements for the domestic market which will be part of the
joint venture.
The project also will involve a major increase in gas gathering,
centralized gas processing, and compression station infrastructure
in and surrounding Origin’s coal seam methane fields in Queensland.
Origin put the new joint venture in place as part of its strategy
to ward off the hostile takeover offer of $13.83 billion from UK
BG Group.
The transaction is conditional on approval of the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board and any other approvals needed because of the BG offer, which is still on the table. ✦

Democratic oil ﬁnders?

________________

12

In response to congressional Democrats obstructing new offshore leasing
until all existing leases are fully developed, I request that the Democratic
National Committee put its money
where its mouth is, so as to apply their
assumed earth science expertise to
locate the undeveloped petroleum
precisely. Why not offer $17/ft bottomhole money to lessees to drill no
shallower then 17,000 ft total vertical
depth at specific surface locations of the
Democrats’ choice in, say, the Gulf of
Mexico’s offshore Galveston, Cameron,
South Timbalier, Ship Shoal, Grand Isle,
West Delta, and Breton Sound areas, in
exchange for 17% working interests in
such leases? Oil operators seek partners
to spread risks.
Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.),
among others, seems so certain that he
knows where the undeveloped commercial hydrocarbons are that he advised his
colleagues (or at least the TV news camera operators), “Hey, c’mon on, guys!..
It’s there.” All that is needed is more
development of existing leases.
Democrats, deliberately remaining
ignorant of petroleum, promote the
harmful, juvenile fiction that merely
because oil, gas and/or mineral leases
exist, they must indicate presence of
commercial hydrocarbons. As millions of
better, wiser, mature US citizens know,
initially such leases are basically hunting
licenses. Someone believes that commercial petroleum may be present and seeks
drilling rights to find out. Were this not
so, no one would ever drill dry holes
in any sedimentary basin anywhere, in
Oregon, Alaska (remember Mukluk?), or
elsewhere.
Much of the Gulf of Mexico, which
generally tends to be gassier westward,
oilier eastward, had been picked over
by the early 1970s when I was one of
thousands picking it over. For example,
I advised my (then) employer against
leasing the off-structure West Delta Block
69 North Half, as they were already
producing their on-structure Block 69
South Half lease. I also mapped the West
Delta-Grand Isle Federal Unit reservoir
limits to present to the US Geological

Company ﬁlers’ beneﬁts
This is a win-win situation for the
companies required to file with the
SEC. Many hours currently are spent
compiling, reviewing, and editing information; this interactive data method
will allow companies to submit data
more quickly and accurately. “Using
interactive technology, XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language)
could enable public companies to shift
resources away from cumbersome
manual reporting to an automated approach that saves time and money and
produces more standardized, accurate
results,” SEC reported.
SEC has proposed that companies be
required to submit financial disclosures
utilizing IDEA as soon as early 2009.
The new technology is very exciting
for the financial world. It will offer additional insights to analyzing confusing
government legalese and unnecessary
information that isn’t pertinent to your
applications.
Most 10-K reports state that accompanying notes are integral parts
of the operations and should be
considered along with the financials.
This is where OGJ will be able to facilitate you, our readers. Our OGJ200
report will eventually utilize this new
technology but will “read between
the lines” to get to the heart of the
information that our readers need to
make informative decisions. We will
provide this data by doing all of the
research, all of the compiling and
editing, all of the work for you in a
one-stop special report. This technology will make it easier and faster for
us to produce accurate data specific
to your needs. In addition, OGJ could
eventually provide supplemental data
to enhance our current reports. ✦

A stable platform in a volatile
market, DME Direct.
In June 2007, the Dubai Mercantile Exchange (DME) launched the ﬁrst physically delivered Oman Crude Oil Futures contract.
In doing so we provided traders with more liquidity, transparency and price discovery through one trading platform, DME Direct™.
But we’re not complacent. That’s why we have launched two additional futures contracts, the DME Brent Crude Oil Futures Contract
and the DME Oman Crude Oil Financial Contract. You will now be able to spread risk by trading Oman sour and Brent crude on one
single platform. This is just the start. And we will continue listing even more for you to trade. We mean business.

The DME is authorised and regulated by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA). All trades executed on the Exchange will be cleared through, and guaranteed by,
NYMEX’s Clearinghouse which is licensed as a recognised body by DSFA.

OPEC and hurricanes
The oil market fell subject to more tugs and
pushes than usual last week as the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries acted to support
the price of crude and the second hurricane in 2
weeks threatened production and refining in and
near the Gulf of Mexico. It was enough to make
the unattentive forget that the fundamentals of
supply and demand have taken a sharp turn.
It was with an eye on that turn that OPEC on
Sept. 10 agreed to lower group production to the
target set a year earlier for members other than
Iraq. After adjustments for new members Angola
and Ecuador and departing member Indonesia, the
target became 28.8 million b/d. That’s 570,000
below August production reported by the International Energy Agency for OPEC members
other than Indonesia and Iraq. Noncompliance by
overproducers such as Iran probably will keep the
actual size of the announced cut closer to 530,000
b/d.

No surprise
That OPEC trimmed output should surprise no
one. But overreaction is inevitable—and not just
by analysts. OPEC’s move might revive discussion
of a proposal in Congress to subject the exporters’
group to federal antitrust enforcement. The threat
of a presidential veto has so far kept that nonsense in check. But antagonism toward OPEC will
surge, however illogically, if Hurricane Ike, unlike
Hurricane Gustav at September’s start, damages
production and refining systems enough to raise
gasoline prices.
The mere possibility of supply interruption,
however, no longer sends oil prices into orbit.
Prices responded minimally to Russia’s invasion
of Georgia and Hurricane Gustav’s sweep over the
Gulf Coast. The market’s new insouciance shows
that something major has changed (OGJ, Sept. 8,
2008, p. 18). Indeed, as OPEC damped production
and Hurricane Ike entered the gulf, evidence of
that change strengthened.
IEA on Sept. 10 trimmed its projection for
2008 oil demand again, by 100,000 b/d. The new
forecast of 86.8 million b/d is 1 million b/d less
than what IEA was projecting in January. Demand
at the newly projected level would be up just 0.8%
20

from last year’s consumption. And IEA forecasts a
demand increase of just 1% next year.
While demand growth sags, potential supply
finally is growing. Saudi Arabia is bringing giant
Khursaniyah oil field on stream after months of
delay related to gas processing facilities. The field
is expected to reach capacity output of 500,000
b/d early next year. By the end of 2009, total
Saudi production capacity is to be 12.5 million
b/d, 1.85 million b/d more than its level before
Khursaniyah started up. IEA raised its September
capacity estimates for Angola, where new fields
have come on stream in the offshore Kizomba C
complex, and for Iran, which has been producing
as much as 4.1 million b/d. With new fields ramping up production, IEA expects OPEC capacity to
climb by a further 500,000 b/d by yearend.
The combination of diminished OPEC production and increased OPEC capacity will thicken one
of the oil market’s two important buffers against
demand surges and supply shocks. Effective spare
production capacity has been near or below 2 million b/d since 2002. That’s barely enough to cover
the loss of supply from politically shaky exporters
like Venezuela and Nigeria. The market becomes
very reactive to hints of supply problems when
idle production capacity is this low and when its
other cushion, oil in storage, is thin.

Inventories growing
Now, however, inventories are growing along
with spare production capacity. IEA said total oil
inventories held in members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,
representing industrial countries, exceeded the
recent 5-year average in July for the first time since
April. OECD inventories represented 54.5 days of
projected demand, almost 1 day more than the
5-year average.
While demand growth eases, supply expands,
and market cushions rebuild, two extra forces
thought to have added to price strength earlier this
year have subsided: dollar weakness and unusually
strong flows of investment capital into commodities. So the forces pushing down oil prices are, for
now, very strong. They’re probably even stronger
than a hurricane. ✦

vious OGJ200. There are also five subsidiaries, including Dominion Energy
Inc., Seneca Resources Corp., Fidelity
Exploration & Production Co., Equitable

Annual results
As the capital spending and drilling efforts of the OGJ200 companies
increased last year, their production and
reserves totals mostly moved upward.
The combined capital and exploration expenditures of the group increased 11% to $126 billion. Up 5%
from 2006, the number of US net wells
drilled by the group totaled 23,065.

US climbed 7% last year, according to
Baker Hughes Inc. At the same time,
the rig count in Canada increased 12%,
and the worldwide number of active
rigs grew 4%, according to American
Petroleum Institute.
Capital outlays varied widely among
the companies in the survey. Such
spending during 2007 by top-ranked
ExxonMobil Corp. was up 5% from a
year earlier, but No. 2 ConocoPhillips
posted a 24% decline in capital spending. Meanwhile, No. 3 Chevron Corp.
reported that its capital spending program last year increased 21%.
As reported a year ago, the previous

OGJ200 group’s total spending surged
40% from 2005, and their net wells
drilled in the US increased 27%.
The OGJ200 shows each company’s
worldwide liquids and natural gas production and reserves and breaks out the
results for the US. The group’s US liquids
and gas reserves and their worldwide
gas reserves totals were up from a year
earlier, but their combined worldwide
liquids reserves slumped 4%.
The group’s combined worldwide
liquids production declined last year
almost 1%, but their collective worldwide natural gas production climbed
3%. Meanwhile, the group’s liquids
production in the US increased 3.5%,

Financial performance
The OGJ200 group recorded improved combined financial results in
each category except earnings. The
companies’ yearend 2007 assets and
stockholders’ equity both increased
14% from a year earlier.
The combined revenues of the
OGJ200 companies climbed 7% from
2006, but their net income declined
2.5%, partly dragged lower by the high
cost of labor, supplies, services, and
equipment.

reduced earnings for 2007 compared
to 2006. Meanwhile, 46 of the firms
posted a net loss for 2007.
Strong oil price realizations pushed
the group’s 2007 revenues to $1.06
trillion, but gas prices on average were
unchanged from a year earlier.
Last year, the average US wellhead
price of crude was $66.52/bbl, up
from the 2006 average price of $59.69/
bbl. Last year’s average US wellhead
price of gas, meanwhile, was $6.39/
Mcf, vs. $6.40/Mcf a year earlier.
Refining margins were relatively
strong last year but were mixed in
comparison to their 2006 averages. The
relative strength of these cash refining margins helped increase earnings

for the integrated companies in the
OGJ200 during both 2006 and 2007.
These gains, however, were tempered
by a higher average refiners’ acquisition
cost of crude.
The US Midwest cash refining margin last year climbed 23% to average
$18.75/bbl, according to Muse, Stancil
& Co. Over the same period, the margin
on the West Coast declined almost 13%
to average $20.96/bbl last year.
The composite US refiners’ acquisition cost of crude during 2007 averaged $67.93/bbl, up from $60.24/bbl
a year earlier.
ConocoPhillips reported a decline
in 2007 net income to $11.9 billion,
including a second-quarter, after-tax

Worldwide Pipelines – LNG
Prospects • Technologies • World markets
The World LNG Market Report 2008-2012

The World Onshore Pipelines Report 2008-2012

This new report examines the current and future prospects,
technologies and markets for the Liqueﬁed Natural Gas
sector. Gas currently accounts for nearly a quarter of all
energy consumption, and the IEA have forecast that gas
demand will grow at a faster rate than oil over the ﬁrst
quarter of this century. With many regions facing future gas
shortages, LNG offers an increasingly important method of
bringing gas from remote reserves to the market.

This report presents a comprehensive view of the historic market from 2003-2007 and forecast period from
2008-2012. The report also reviews all aspects of onshore
oil & gas pipelines from design, materials, techniques and
components through to construction, operations and maintenance and transportation. Geared to the needs of the
senior executive and assumes no previous reader knowledge of the subject area.

Annual results
Most of the companies in the
OGJ100 that report their annual earnings posted increases in revenues, net
income, and capital and exploration
spending during 2007 vs. 2006. The
yearend-2007 assets of most of the
firms also moved higher.
The largest Canadian company with
$47 billion in assets at the end of last
year, EnCana Corp. reported a 30%
earnings decline for 2007, primarily
due to the impact of financial hedges.
In Europe, Royal Dutch Shell PLC and
BP lead in terms of size and earnings, but
each reported a slight reduction in oil
production for 2007 from a year earlier.
Ranked by assets, PetroChina is the
largest of the Asia-Pacific companies
in the OGJ100, followed by Malaysia’s
Petronas and Australia’s BHP Billiton
Petroleum.
In Latin America, state-owned PDVSA
holds the most oil and gas reserves,
but Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras)
and Pemex rank higher in terms of
total assets. While PDVSA and Petrobras
reported earnings increases for 2007,
Pemex posted a nearly $2 billion net
loss for the year due to an increase in
taxes and an increase in costs. ✦

Pelosi also disputed Republican charges that she had
opposed bringing a bill calling for more leasing of the
OCS to a floor before the August recess. “I was opposed
to their idea that if the House voted in isolation for new
drilling, we would bring the price at the pump down immediately. That was a hoax which was perpetrated on the
American people,” she said.

‘Pin prices on the donkey’
Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) said that the
Democrats’ new energy bill would not come to the floor
under a rules suspension as others have earlier this year,
but he indicated that it will arrive under a rule which has
not been determined yet. It also will be different from the
bill promoted by Republican leaders and members, many
of whom stayed behind to protest taking a recess in August
without a vote on opening more of the OCS.
“It’s not surprising they’re trying to play pin the record
gasoline prices on the donkey,” Hoyer said, adding that at
least one more caucus will be necessary before the Democrats’ final bill emerges.
Others said that while Republicans made speeches each
day in a darkened House chamber during August, Democrats conferred with their constituents in person and with
each other by teleconference about energy issues. “I heard
from my constituents all summer that they want an energy
bill which will lead to economic growth and more jobs.
The Republicans have produced neither in the last 8 years.
When they say they want all of the above, they mean more
of the same,” said Democratic Caucus Chairman Rahm
Emanuel (D-Ill.).
House Republican leaders said that voters will accept
nothing less than HR 6566, the bill they call the American Energy Act which not only would expand leasing on
the OCS but also authorize leasing on the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge’s coastal plain, allow development of US
oil shale resources and remove obstacles to constructing
new refineries and expanding those which already exist.
It also contains provisions designed to improve energy
conservation and efficiency, and to promote renewable and
alternative energy technologies.
“The American people don’t want a little bit of the
above. They don’t want some of the above. They want all of
the above,” Minority Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio) told
reporters at a briefing.

he American Petroleum Institute
said on Sept. 5 that it wasn’t
questioning the US Department of
the Interior’s decision to list the polar
bear as a threatened species when it
filed a motion on Aug. 27 to intervene in a lawsuit challenging the
findings.
In fact API agrees with DOI’s May
15 “determination that the Endangered Species Act is not the right tool
to set US climate policy....”
It said, “The oil and natural gas
industry is committed to the conservation of the polar bear and other
marine mammals. Companies active
in Arctic region energy exploration
implement polar bear mitigation and
avoidance programs, and they provide funding and logistical support
for important polar bear studies” in
the US and Canada.
The US Chamber of Commerce,
National Association of Manufacturers, National Mining Association and
American Iron and Steel Institute
joined API in the motion which was
filed in US District Court for the District of Columbia. The case is Center
for Biological Diversity et al vs. Dirk
Kempthorne et al.

‘Discriminatory carve-out’
The motion states that the five
business groups are not challenging
the listing itself. Their concern centers
on “a discrete provision of only one
paragraph of the rule, the discriminatory carve-out of operations in
Alaska from an exemption provided
to operations in all other states.” They
call this “the Alaska gap.”
Robin Conrad, executive vicepresident of the National Chamber
Litigation Center, said on Aug. 28:
44

“Environmental activists are trying to
use the Endangered Species Act as a back
door to set national climate policy, and
they’re starting with Alaska. Climate
change is a global issue and requires a
global solution. Singling out Alaska to
impose burdensome and onerous regulation is bad policy and violates the law.”
While US Interior Secretary Dirk A.
Kempthorne said the ESA was not an appropriate vehicle for limiting greenhouse
gas emissions, he also used authority
under Section 4(d) of the law to issue a
special rule which made all states except
Alaska exempt from complying with a
permitting process for activities that produce carbon dioxide, Conrad said.

‘Arbitrary and capricious’
“It is arbitrary and capricious for
the secretary to single out Alaska for
regulation, given [his] own scientific
judgment that no causal link can be established between a particular emissions
source and any harm to Arctic ice,”
Conrad said.
The groups’ concern is minor
compared to the uproar that greeted
Kempthorne’s decision to propose
changes in the ESA itself. “The existing
regulations create unnecessary conflicts
and delays. The proposed regulations
will continue to protect species while
focusing the consultation process on
those federal actions where potential
impacts can be linked to the action and
the risks are reasonably certain to occur,” he said on Aug. 11.
Environmental groups said that the
proposals would gut the law. US Senate
Environment and Public Works Committee Chairwoman Barbara Boxer
(D-Calif.) asked Kempthorne to extend
the comment period and scheduled a
hearing on the matter for Sept. 24. ✦

the House floor. We’ll look at what the
Democrats roll out later today. My guess
is their new energy legislation will produce no new energy,” he said.
Republican Conference Vice-Chairwoman Kay Granger (Tex.) said that
she found it refreshing to speak directly
with voters on the House floor instead
of to a microphone or C-SPAN television camera. “Many had their children
with them and were going to get them
ready to go back to school when they
got home from vacation. Some told me
that record-high gasoline prices could
limit their after-school activities. That’s
not right,” she said.
The protest was “the kind of nononsense approach that [2008 Republican
vice presidential nominee] Sarah Palin
used when she came into office as Alaska’s
governor,” Granger said, adding “She announced that a natural gas pipeline would
be built under a competitive bidding system and that’s exactly what’s happening.”
Neither side’s leadership appeared
ready to consider compromise energy proposals which emerged in the
House before the August recess. That
didn’t surprise Patrick Creighton, press
secretary for Rep. John E. Peterson
(R-Pa.), one of the original sponsors
of one compromise bill which now
has 131 cosponsors. “We could break
200 by the end of the week. If Speaker
Pelosi and Minority Leader Boehner are
serious about getting a new bill passed
before Sept. 26, they’ll have to take a
bipartisan approach and look at one of
the compromise proposals,” Creighton
told OGJ.
Voters still want Congress to act, McConnell insisted. “One senator on the
other side said that he thinks frustration
over the high price of [gasoline] has
peaked. But I’ve seen no evidence of this
at all. In fact, I’m confident, after spending the past month away from Washington, that if we did little else these next
few weeks but pass a serious response
to high gas prices, fund the government
and protect taxpayers, the American
people would view these next few weeks
as extremely productive,” he said. ✦

by Alaska state legislators designating
TC Alaska the state’s preferred applicant
under its Alaska Gasline Inducement
Act (AGIA) and granting it an exclusive
AGIA license.
The award authorizes the state to
contribute as much as $500 million
toward TC Alaska expenditures for planning and preparation leading to federal
and other permit applications. It also
represents an agreement to settle various project issues between the state and
the applicant.
Denali Pres. Bud Fackrell said the
AGIA license award to TC Alaska would
not impede the Denali project.
“The granting of the AGIA license
will not affect the Denali work program
and as long as the state ensures a level
playing field should not affect Denali’s
steady march toward its first major
milestone, an open season by the end of
2010,” said Fackrell. “Denali is continuing to move forward.”

and 1,000 miles of pipeline from the

it has no plans to build a gas treatment
plant on the North Slope, but it is prepared to do so if necessary.

“Finalizing an environmental

nothing to address [gasoline] prices at

continued.
Chase Huntley, energy policy advisor for the Wilderness Society, agreed.
“The administration and its boosters
in Congress are pushing the promise
of oil shale in the hope of scoring
political points by leading Americans
to believe it will lower today’s high energy prices. It will not. Putting politics
ahead of responsible governance could
cause more harm that good,” he said.
“In fact, this reckless hurtle toward
oil shale development puts thousands
of residents of Colorado, Utah, and
Wyoming at risk of an economic catastrophe not seen since the Black Sunday
collapse of the Colony oil shale project
in 1982. This move also promises significant and potentially devastating environmental consequences for nearly 2
million acres of western public lands,”
Huntley warned. ✦

PT Chevron Pacific Indonesia (CPI),
already under government scrutiny for
alleged violations of its cost recovery
claims, has forecast that production
from its concessions will decline due to
aging fields and seasonal floods.
CPI President Suwitom Anggoro,
during a hearing with the House of
Representatives’ budget committee, said
the firm’s Duri and Minas concessions
in Sumatra might produce just 405,000
b/d this year, down from the 408,000
b/d target set by the government and
the 425,000 b/d produced in 2007.
“The rainy season and potential
flooding will probably exacerbate the
decline,” said Anggoro, who predicted
production eventually could drop to
382,000 b/d from the current 411,000
b/d due to natural decline. He gave no
timetable for the projected decline.
CPI, which produces 40% of Indonesia’s total crude output, is one of several
international oil companies summoned
by the budget committee, which expressed determination to discover the
reasons behind the country’s falling
production of crude oil.

More oil revenues sought
Amid soaring prices on the international markets the Indonesian govern-

ment wants to increase oil revenues and
has estimated production will reach
977,000 b/d this year. In its proposed
2009 state budget, however, the government estimates that production will
drop to 950,000 b/d.
The government is concerned at the
potential loss of revenue due to the
declining production of crude.
Anggito Abimanyu, head of fiscal
policy for the finance ministry, said for
every 10,000 b/d below target, the government will lose some $322.48 million
in revenue based on the Indonesian crude
price (ICP) of $100/bbl as established in
the proposed state budget for 2009.
To determine reasons for the decline
in production, the House also summoned
PT ConocoPhillips Indonesia, state-owned
PT Pertamina EP, PT Medco E&P Indonesia, and PT ExxonMobil Oil Indonesia.
Of the four companies, only Pertamina
EP estimated it would produce more oil
next year. Pertamina EP president director Tri Siwandono said, “In 2009, we are
projecting to produce 125,000 b/d, about
a 6% rise from 118,221 b/d this year.”
ConocoPhillips president director
Jim Taylor said the company in 2009
might produce only 45,000 b/d, down
from this year’s 80,000 b/d, while
Medco director of production assets
Budi Basuki said its oil output would
drop slightly to 30,000 b/d in 2009
from 2008’s 33,400 b/d.

I

f anything can be counted on in
the oil and gas industry these days,
it is that the governments of Venezuela and the US are not going to see
eye-to-eye on very much at all.
Just look at how they reacted to
the announcement of production
cuts of about 520,000 b/d by the
Organizations of Petroleum Exporting Countries, cuts made as part of a
broader move by the group to reduce
what it terms “excess oil” on global
markets.
Almost immediately, the White
House issued an announcement saying that it “certainly disagreed” with
the OPEC decision to lower output
and renew its call for Congress to act
on legislation that boosts domestic
energy production.
At the same time, Venezuela said
it “trusts” that OPEC members will

Ramirez, “When OPEC reaches a

terize such decisions as resting solely
on the basis of supply and demand.
In this case, apparent oversupply
dictates reduced production.
OPEC’s decision will not affect
consumers “in any way,” according to
the group’s president, Chakib Khelil,
who explained that, “there is oversupply...(oil) stocks are very high. We
will have overhang by the end of this
year and it will be even worse early
next year.”

Is demand slowing?

Is Khelil just blowing smoke?
That’s up for grabs, maybe, but there
are signs around the world that
demand is slowing and that current
production rates could lead to an
oversupply.
Consider the Far East, where three

ExxonMobil representative Maman told
the House that the firm would next year

Party (PKS) questioned the effort undertaken by international oil companies in comparison with the Pertamina’s optimistic

asked Rama. He said, “I think the potential
is still great.” Earlier this week, the House
of Representatives inquiry committee on
oil and gas management heard claims that
a project run by CPI has allegedly cost the
state up to $210 million in losses.
“If the project continues, losses to
the state could reach up to $1.2 billion,”
Supreme Audit Agency (BPK) official Udju
Djuhaeri told the committee.
Since 2000, the CPI field in Rokan,
Riau, has received extra power from a cogeneration installation operated by partner
company PT Mandau Cipta Tenaga Nusantara (MCTN). The installation converts gas
and feedwater into electricity and steam
power. Under the country’s cost recovery
mechanism, CPI can claim expenses from
the government for electricity and steam
for the cogeneration installation. But the
BPK has alleged that irregularities in the
project have resulted in state losses in the
form of cost recovery payments.
Udju said the figure of $1.2 billion in
state losses was based on the project’s longterm operations, which will run until CPI
completes its contract to operate in Rokan
in 2021.
Santi Manuhutu, CPI corporate communications manager, denied any wrongdoing, saying the electricity and steam
processing fee paid by CPI to MCTN was
“reasonable and competitive compared
to similar projects in Indonesia and in the
ASEAN region.”
Meanwhile, other firms have also been
accused of financial irregularities.
ExxonMobil Oil Indonesia was said
to be some $32.53 million in arrears for
taxes, dividends and royalties, while the
BPK also claimed that that in 2005 ConocoPhillips double-counted a $1.94 million
investment credit that had been counted in
the previous year. ✦

Joint Oil of Libya and Tunisia has

the southern Mediterranean to Canadian Superior Energy Inc., Calgary.
The work commitment in the first 4

larger. Parts of the block lie along the
productive trends of giant Bouri oil
field off Libya and giant Ashtart field off
Tunisia, where cumulative production is
750 million bbl and 250 million bbl of
oil, respectively.
Joint Oil and Canadian Superior have
identified a number of highly promising prospects on the block using the
large existing seismic database that
represent a variety of geological plays
and proved hydrocarbon systems.
The required appraisal well is to
be the first well in a fast-track drilling
program. It will offset two large oil and
gas discoveries drilled in the 1990s on
a feature known as Zarat on an adjacent
contract area near the 7th of November
block’s southwestern corner.
Based on 3D seismic shot subsequent
to the discoveries, a large portion of
the undeveloped Zarat discovery area
is interpreted to extend north into the

7th of November block. The primary
oil, condensate, and gas reservoirs are
expected at about 9,000 ft.
Canadian Superior said planning and
rig contract discussions are under way
targeting a two-well, back-to-back drilling program likely starting in within 6
months.
The first exploration well is to be
drilled on a geologically related seismic
prospect named Fisal about 6 miles
northeast of the Zarat appraisal wellsite.

Drilling
coiled tubing during use
of nitrogen contaminated
with oxygen.
For several years, coiled-tubing
operations off Brazil have used nitrogen
generation units. Petrobras has increased the use of nitrogen generation
units because of the remote locations,
lack of liquid nitrogen suppliers, and
other logistical issues.
Using a nitrogen generation unit
in remote locations, where most of
the platforms have very limited space,
solved the longstanding problem of
supplying nitrogen. However, when
we used a nitrogen generation unit
with coiled-tubing operations, another
concern arose.
In situ nitrogen generation does not
produce pure (99.9%) nitrogen gas.
In situ nitrogen generation can yield
nitrogen gas compositions with oxygen
content as high as 5%.
Under downhole conditions, using
nitrogen with the oxygen content as
high as 5% can result in severe corrosion in the coiled-tubing (CT) string.
Furthermore, completion brines and
acids are sometimes pumped, increasing the corrosivity downhole.
Occasionally operations were
stopped because the coiled-tubing
bottomhole assembly (BHA) was

either completely plugged by oxidized
metal flakes or the coiled-tubing string
became so corroded that it required
inspection before further use. Based on
these corrosion and safety issues the use
of in-situ nitrogen generation loses its
benefits.
To find a solution to this corrosion
problem, we undertook a laboratory research study with the most commonly
used CT

surface and downhole conditions with
the maximum percentage of oxygen
concentration expected in operations.
We tested several corrosion inhibitors
and mixtures for their ability to control
corrosion.
After laboratory testing established
which inhibitor systems would control
the corrosion rate of the CT, yard tests
confirmed that the inhibitor would
work in the field. Following successful field trials, we changed the recommended practices to avoid corrosion
problems when nitrogen generation
units are used offshore.
This article presents the development
of this project, beginning with CT corrosion observed in laboratory research
studies, yard trials, recommended field
applications, and applying the results in
live operations on the Merluza platform
in the Santos basin.

Observed corrosion
Generalized corrosion inside the CT
string was the type observed in this
field study. This type of corrosion is
well distributed across the entire metal
surface, with little or no localized penetration. It is the least damaging of all
corrosion types. However, during operations in which fluids were pumped
through the coiled tubing after rust had
formed, the BHA became completely
plugged. Therefore, the coiled-tubing
operations were stopped with economic
repercussions. Fig. 1 shows a picture of

quicker loss of wall thickness and result
in crevices, perforations, and stress
concentration points. These pits reduce
the material’s mechanical resistance and
can result in a fracture of the pipe or a
coiled-tubing failure.
The presence of chlorides in a corrosive environment accelerates pitting
corrosion. Pitting corrosion is initially
slow. However, once pits are formed,
this autocatalytic reaction can be selfsustaining in CT as the chromium tends

Experiment description
We conducted corrosion studies with
the 3% KCl brine and the metal coupons using several different corrosion
inhibitors. With each corrosion inhibitor and inhibitor blends, one coiledtubing coupon was dipped twice into
3% KCl brine containing the inhibitor
and placed into the Teflon cup inside
the corrosion bomb with no fluid
sample present.
In the second test with each corrosion inhibitor, we added the 3% KCl
with inhibitor fluid to the Teflon cup
and placed the steel test coupon into
the fluid for the entire corrosion incubation period. We allowed the corrosion
tests with the 3% KCl brine and the
steel test coupon to run for an 18-hr
incubation period at 230° F.
We also conducted corrosion studies with the 5% acetic-7% formic acid
system over a 6-hr exposure period. As
in the KCl corrosion studies, we dipped
one coupon twice in the inhibited acid
and placed it in the Teflon cup with
no fluid for the entire corrosion study
period.
In the second set of corrosion tests
with the inhibited acid, we placed
the coupon in the inhibited acid fluid
volume for the entire 6-hr incubation
period.
After each steel coupon was placed
in its respective corrosion cell, the cell
was closed and evacuated with nitrogen

atmospheric air had been purged. After
the third nitrogen evacuation, we pressurized each corrosion cell to 400 psi
with a 95% nitrogen and 5% oxygen
gas mixture to simulate the nitrogen
atmosphere in the field. Each corrosion
cell was placed in a 230° F. oven for the
test incubation period.
After the incubation period, the
cells were cooled and the pressure
released. We removed each test coupon
from the cell, neutralized it with soda
ash, and washed with water. The test
coupons were photographed to record
their surface condition before being
sandblasted, cleaned, dried, weighed,
and their surfaces evaluated for pitting.
We compared the final weights to the
initial weights of the coupons to determine the corrosion rates for each fluid
environment.

Based on the laboratory corrosion
results, the next step was to select the
best-performing corrosion inhibitors
and to test its application in the field.
Yard tests were recommended to
define injection rates that would fulfill
operational limitations, such as offshore
product storage, while providing the
desired pipe protection.

Laboratory corrosion studies

We developed new operating procedures for injecting corrosion inhibitors
(CI) into the system while pumping
generated nitrogen.
First, it is important to understand
the final purpose of the in-situ generated nitrogen use in CT operations. In
some cases, only nitrogen is pumped
through the CT string to reduce the
hydrostatic pressure applied downhole
by the fluid inside the well and, thereby,
bring the well back on production. In
the other cases, fluid is commingled

We conducted tests on ten different
corrosion inhibitors and blends, recording corrosion and pitting rates.
Table 2 shows the classified results
according to the severity of corrosion
observed. This table was used to select
the corrosion inhibitors that would be
tested in the field.

the inhibitors’ concentrations, blends,
and results. Figs. 1-5 show the coupon

The results of this field trial showed
results similar to those obtained in the
laboratory and yard trials. We saw very
little corrosion on the CT string in the
chamber, with no plugging of the BHA.
Also, very low corrosion rates were
observed on the CT string after the fivewell campaign was completed.

Learnings

Based on the laboratory tests, yard,
and field trials, we found that corrosive environments involving nitrogen generator units can be controlled
within an acceptable level by using
appropriate corrosion inhibitors and

well is in main body, thin sand while
the producing well is in a river-channel
sand. The distance between the wells
is large. The layer has a 3.72 m effective thickness with a 1.88 m (55.5%)
weakly flooded and unflooded thickness
(Fig. 2).
64

A third factor affecting oil recovery
is incomplete injection-production patterns.
Some intervals in the injectionproduction well pattern are incomplete
and have much remaining oil. Four

layer units have this kind of remaining
oil. The units have a 14.95 m effective
thickness of which 10.63 m (71.1%)
is weakly flooded and unflooded. An
example is the PI1 unit of observation well B2-350-J45. The well is at the
peripheral part of interriver sand and
all of its 0.93 m effective thickness is
unflooded (Fig. 3).
A fourth factor affecting recovery is
that some oil remains in areas that have
branch streamlines in the original well
pattern for polymer flooding
In 2007, two observation wells
were drilled in the same well group
in the B-2 area of the north Saertu oil
area. The wells are B2-322-JP43 (main
streamline) and B2-323-JP42 (branch
streamline). Table 1 compares the
streamlines.
Most of the reservoir on the main
streamline area was strongly waterflooded. This area has a thickness ratio
that is 17.3% larger than the area with
the branch streamlines. On the other
hand, most of reservoir on the branch
streamlines was waterflooded intermediately. This area has a thickness ratio
that is 14.3% larger than that main
streamline area.
The ratio of unflooded thickness in
the branch streamline area is 3.8% less
than in the main streamline area.
The comparison of log interpretations shows that for the PI layer unit after polymer flooding, the remaining oil
in the branch streamline area is much
higher than in the main streamline area
(Table 2). The water saturation in the
area with branch streamlines is 5.77%
lower than in the main streamline area
after polymer flooding for the PI1-4
units.
Remaining oil also exists near the
production well of the original polymer-flood well pattern.
The analysis of data in October 2005
from two cored wells at different points
along the injection-production main
streamline in the west block of the
northern Lamadian oil area show this.
Observation well L6-J2331, about 160
m away from the injection well, indicated an oil recovery factor of only 43%,

Potential after polymer ﬂooding
According to data from 11 observation wells, after polymer flooding, the
remaining potential is mainly in the
intermediately and strongly flooded
intervals that account for 71.1% of the
total remaining reserves (Fig. 4).
If the displacement efficiency of
strongly flushed intervals remains
unchanged while the displacement efficiency of other intervals increases to
the average value of the higher flooded
levels, the resulting remaining oil in the
strongly, intermediately, weakly, and unflooded intervals is 7.2%, 62.1%, 8.0%,
and 22.7%, respectively.
After polymer flooding, the focus
will be on improving the recovery efficiency of the intermediately flooded
intervals in thick pay zones. The major

but another observation well L6-J2334,
80 m away from injection well, indicated an oil recovery factor of 54.3%,
12% higher than in the L6-2331 well
(Table 3).
Although river-channel sands are in
all PI21, PI22, and PI23 layers, their distances to the injection well are different;
and therefore the three layers exhibit
different oil recoveries in the observation wells.

pay zones with remaining reserves are
in the PI2 and PI3 sedimentary units in
which the river-sands are well developed.
The oil layers of the PI2 unit in the
Lamadian area are braided river sediments.
The distribution of remaining reserves is 50.5% in PI21, 32.3% in PI22
unit, and only 17% in PI23 due to the
thinness (Fig. 5).
Sazhong and Saibei areas also show
the same potential remaining oil distribution.

Some of the possible measures to
enhance oil recovery after polymer
flooding include surfactant flooding,
surfactant-polymer binary flooding,
alkaline-surfactant-polymer ternary
flooding, high concentration polymer
flooding, microbial oil recovery, fracturing, profile control, water shutoff,
adjustment of well pattern, thermal
recovery technique, horizontal well
technique, and combination of these
measures.

This article details
methods for removing
individual contaminants
in refinery offgas (ROG).
Various configurations of
the ROG treatment unit
Refining
and associated units are
compared, depending on
the type of product and feedstock. This
article also discusses optimization strategies required for
design of ROG
treatment units.
ROG is produced in refinery
units such as
hydrotreaters,
alkylation units,
FCCs, and catalytic reformers, that manufacture conversion products. Refiners
can recover valuable products including
hydrogen, olefins, NGLs, and higherbtu fuel gas from the offgas if an ROG
unit is installed. Incremental economics of product recovery as opposed to
using the entire offgas for fuel provides
incentives for installation of ROG units.
Specifications of recovered products
and catalyst requirements will dictate
the allowable limits of these contaminants in the feed stream.

recovery of products such as ethylene
and propylene for petrochemicals can
boost profitability while corecovering
hydrogen through refinery and petrochemical integration.
Table 1 shows the composition of a
typical ROG stream. The stream’s hydrogen content varies appreciably depending on the source. The heavier liquid
components (C2+) also vary considerably, between 20% and 40%.
An ROG stream can contain many
trace components such as oxygen, ammonia, nitriles, acetylenes, heavy sulfur
compounds, butadiene, chlorides,
arsenic, mercury, and water, in addition
to the acid gases H2S, CO2, and COS. Removal of certain contaminants in feed
pretreatment is essential.
Several contaminants that may be
present in the ROG can cause significant problems in the cryogenic section.
These include diolefins, NOx, mercury,
CO2, water, and some sulfur compounds. The presence of these compounds will require front-end treating
for ROG processes with cryogenic units
to meet product specifications.

beforehand.
Other types of problems due to
chloride include chloride-induced
corrosion, formation and deposition
of ammonium chloride, and off-spec
products.6 The type of chloride in the
feed will determine the method for
chloride removal.
Activated alumina or promoted alumina can remove HCl but not organic
chlorides. Catalyst manufacturers are
currently developing adsorbents that
can remove organic chlorides. Selective
hydrogenation of chlorides in the presence of olefinic components in the ROG
is generally not an option.

Selective hydrogenation
The figure shows that feed gas flows
from the chloride bed to the feed-gas
treater, which is a selective hydrogenation unit. A nickel-based sulfided catalyst, such as Sud-Chemie’s C-36, can be
used for front-end feed gas treating.
This catalyst was developed to treat
FCC offgas. It is a multi-functional
catalyst that removes or converts many
kinds of poisons and impurities to
low levels, including oxygen, NOx,
acetylene, methyl acetylene, butadiene,
arsine, phosphine, stibine, and mercury.
The nickel-based sulfided catalyst can
treat:
• Oxygen. This promotes polymeric
formation of light olefins and can react
with amines to form carboxylic acids,
which crystallize at low temperatures.
It can also react with H2S to form sulfur
at high temperatures. Furthermore, it
may be a major factor in the formation
of NOx. It is therefore important to remove oxygen completely from the feed
before it enters the cold box to avoid
cold box plugging.
• Acetylene. This is a catalyst poison
for olefin polymerization. It can also
promote coking. The typical product
specification for polymer-grade ethylene requires concentrations of oxygen
and acetylene of less than 1 ppm (vol).
• NOx. This forms in FCC units during spent-catalyst regeneration. When
reacting with oxygen, NO will form

NO2 at low temperatures. NO2 accumulates as a solid in cold sections of
the plant. Further reaction of NO2 with
oxygen will lead to formation of N2O3
or “blue ice.” The N2O3 freezing point is
–152° F.
NO2 or N2O3 may react with diolefins to form an unstable gum, which
can explode when exposed to a sudden
warm-up of the plant. N2O3 can also
react with ammonia to form ammonium nitrate that can explode at warm
temperature. NOx is converted to ammonia by the sulfided nickel catalyst
that is used in the front end acetylene
converter.
• Nitriles. Catalyst companies claim
that nearly all nitriles are converted to
amines using the sulfided nickel catalyst. This claim, however, is unproven
and a conservative design for the process assumes no conversion. Molecular
sieve adsorption of the offgas feed is the
recommended method for removal of
these nitrogen compounds if they are
present.

the demethanizer overhead can feed a
PSA unit for hydrogen purification or to
the fuel gas system. The demethanizer
will normally have several feeds and
side reboilers for heat integration.

Fractionation
The fractionation train configuration
and complexity depends on the types
of products required. The fractionation
train normally includes a de-ethanizer,
a depropanizer, a C2 splitter, and an
optional C3 splitter.
Product specifications determine the
columns’ design parameters:
• The depropanizer can produce
refinery-grade propylene.
• The C2 splitter can produce
polymer-grade ethylene.
• The C3 splitter separates a mixed C3
stream into chemical-grade propylene
and commercial-grade propane.
Propane refrigeration is used for the
de-ethanizer and C2 splitter condensers.
The demethanizer bottoms stream
enters the de-ethanizer at the midsection. The de-ethanizer normally operates at about 390 psia at the overhead.
Low-pressure steam provides heat in
a thermosyphon reboiler. Refrigerant
from a propylene refrigeration system
condenses overhead vapors.
The de-ethanizer bottoms, consisting of propylene, propane, and heavier
components, feed the depropanizer.
De-ethanizer overhead is a mixture of
ethylene and ethane. It feeds the C2
splitter.
Ethane product from the C2 splitter bottoms goes to the product surge
drum. Both ethylene and propylene
products are pumped from the product drums, heated, and delivered to
pipelines.
The depropanizer operates at 285
psia, which allows cooling water to
condense overhead vapors. Low-pressure steam provides reboil heat to the
column.
C4+ product from depropanizer

The overhead product, refinery-grade

Alternately, if required, refinery-grade
propylene (mixed C3s) can be further
fractionated to propane and chemicalgrade propylene in a C3 splitter.
Overhead chemical-grade propylene
is withdrawn from the C3 splitter reflux
accumulator and pumped to the propylene storage tank for pipeline delivery.

TERMINAL SITING—
Conclusion

LNG terminal development requires careful
assessment of both the
waterway leading to
the potential terminal
site and the geographic
LNG
conditions of the site
itself. Establishing critical
parameters for these areas helps ensure
the economic viability of the terminal.
The first
article of this
series (OGJ,
Sept. 8, 2008,
p. 50) assessed
the factors leading to onshore
or offshore
terminal location and the influence of
LNG vessels on potential marine terminal siting. This concluding article will
consider land requirements for onshore
locations, including soil and seismic
conditions and site elevations, as well as
waterway and jetty requirements.

Project viability hinges on

Land requirements
LNG released to the atmosphere as a
result of accidental spillage will immediately start to vaporize and form
a gas cloud. This cloud will spread as
influenced by the wind and, depending on the size of the spill and weather
conditions, could extend beyond the
boundaries (plot area) of the terminal.
A source of ignition in the flammable
area of the cloud could have devastating
consequences.
Safety requires addressing worst-case
scenarios to ensure their risk of occurrence and consequences remain within
acceptable limits.1 A risk-assessment
study addresses the probability of a
catastrophic failure of an LNG tank.
Table 1 provides guidance regarding
typical areas across which a cloud could
extend.
The risk of ignition and the consequences thereafter depend on the type
and density of population within the
spread of the cloud, making it important to know the population densities

74

and activities within 2 miles of the
terminal.
As LNG ship sizes increase, shiparrival frequency decreases, but correspondingly, required storage volume for
loading and unloading increases. Vessel
delays due to unfavorable weather or
ship problems directly affect LNG stock
levels at both terminals and liquefaction
plants. The volume and design of ship
tankage therefore, largely determines
the area required for onshore facilities.
Operating full-size LNGCs will require at least one 265-295 ft diameter
tank. Operational considerations, however, suggest the need for more than
one tank. Tank-containment philosophy,
however, likely most affects the area
required for the terminal (and also its
location relative to its neighbors).2 3
Single-containment tanks require
large bounded areas and are only practical where space is readily available and
little or no population nearby. Fullcontainment tanks provide the smallest
likelihood of an accidental release and
can be used almost anywhere but are
expensive. Double-containment tanks
cost slightly less than full-containment
but still need a large terminal area.
A low throughput terminal (up to
about 3 million tonnes/year) handling
large LNG carriers (125,000 cu m or
larger) will need two tanks. Industrial or residential areas require fullcontainment tanks, but in greenfield
or unpopulated areas double or singlecontainment designs may be acceptable.
A terminal in an industrial area, with
two full-containment tanks, would need
about 40-50 acres.
Table 2 provides rough terminal
areas for initial site-selection studies
based on different containment configurations.

Shoreline lengths
A terminal might also require water
intakes and outfalls and firewater or water for use in the vaporizers. Intakes are
often large structures accommodated by
settling ponds, pumps, and screens and
are usually on shore. Water for the intake comes from a pipe placed close to

the bottom of an adjacent waterway but
away from the shoreline to avoid bringing too much sediment into the system.
Outfalls are simpler structures located
away from the intake to avoid recycling
water between the two structures.
If insufficient shoreline exists to
provide enough distance between water
intake and outfall to prevent mixing
cooling water, the choice of vaporizer
may be limited to either a submerged
combustion vaporizer or shell-and-tube
exchanger vaporizer.

Soil, ground
Poor soil and ground conditions at a
site can raise material and construction
costs, typically requiring pile foundations and soil enhancements.
LNG tanks should be founded on
rock, but firm sand would also avoid
use of piled foundations. Soft materials
such as silts and soft clays, often found
in estuarine locations, will almost
certainly require piling under the larger
structures, such as tanks and vaporizers.
Risks associated with flooding,
environmental concerns, and the cost
associated with ground preparation
can make areas such as marshes and
swamps unsuitable.

Seismic conditions
Earthquakes can damage storages
tanks and pipelines.
Japan, one of the world’s largest users of LNG, has many LNG storage tanks
and LNG pipelines. Even during its
most severe earthquakes, however, no
LNG tanks were damaged, even though
LNG pipelines were.

Site elevation
Low site elevation may contribute to
the risk of site flooding. Events that may
result in flooding include:
1. Poor drainage.
2. High river elevations created by
upstream conditions.
3. High sea levels created by low
atmospheric pressure and high winds.
4. Tsunamis.
5. Hurricanes.
All of these events can damage

facilities, lead to partial or complete
shutdown, or disrupt terminal operations. The US Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission requires a storm-surge
study on any prospective site. This study
determines site elevation relative to
100-year flood levels and its susceptibility to flooding.
An area that normally floods, however, does not preclude its selection. A
number of measures can mitigate risks
associated with siting a terminal in such
an area. These include using pile foundations, raising site elevation, or building a berm around the facility. Each of
these options adds to the facility’s cost.

Environmental limitations
Large LNG carriers can normally
berth in winds up to about 20 knots.
Some current terminals quote a limit of
30 knots, but this may apply principally

Waves and currents can also place
large loads on a ship’s hull. Current
loads on a ship’s hull are high if imposed beam on, with implications for
berth design and operation. The speed
of a current is less important than its
directional uniformity, although current speeds greater than 2 knots will
usually result in operational difficulties.
Currents should be considered during
vessel maneuvering as well as while the
LNGC is at berth.

Jetty location
Marine terminals should afford
protection from waves and currents and
be away from vessel traffic. Berthing a
vessel in a strong current (>2 knots)
can be problematic and may make a
location undesirable from a shipping
viewpoint. Water depths should allow
passage during all states of tide.4 5

to membrane carriers since they have a
lower sail area than spherical carriers. It
is also possible that a terminal will rely
on additional tugs should this condition occur. LNGCs will usually remain
at berth in winds up to about 40 knots,
although the berth itself will usually be
designed for 60 knot winds or higher.
Ship breakout from the berth can
have serious consequences. Orienting
the berth so that the LNG carrier will
tend to be pushed toward it can help
reduce this risk but may not always
be feasible, as other conditions might
take precedence. This possibility has
prompted LNG discharge arms to be
equipped with powered emergency
release couplings to reduce any spillage
stemming from exceeding the loading
or unloading arm’s operating limits.

The seabed’s nature and underlying strata determine an acceptable draft
at the jetty for vessel operations.5 6
Underkeel clearance typically measures
10-20% of the vessel draft, depending
on wind, wave, and current conditions
as well as the nature of the seabed and
operator requirements. Vessels subject to
large wave action will require a greater
underkeel clearance than those in calm
waters.
Berthing and unberthing operations
should occur in a maneuvering area
with a minimum diameter of twice the
ship’s length unless it can be demonstrated the berthing maneuver requires
less. The berth should be away from the
navigation channel to afford protection
to the docked LNG vessel. Aside from
the heightened threat of collision with
other ships a site near a channel would
introduce, wakes can disrupt unload-

Air draft
A vessel’s air draft measures the
height of the highest point of a ship
(usually the mast) from its waterline.
It must therefore measure less than the
distance between water level and the
underside of any structure spanning
the channel. Navigation charts provide
river crossing information and can be
used for initial site-selection exercises,
but elevations on waterway crossings
should be verified before completing
final site selection.
LNG carriers should ideally avoid
passing under any bridges or structures
spanning the channel. The superstructure of LNG carriers usually measures
130-160 ft and modifications may need
to be made in order for them to pass

THE REMAINDER

September 30 – October 2, 2008
Hilton Fort Worth
Fort Worth, Texas USA

UNCONVENTIONAL GAS EXTRACTION BECOMING VIABLE
Production from unconventional reservoirs — tight gas sands, shales, and coalbeds--accounts for a large and growing share of total gas
supply. But the reservoirs are complex. The costs of drilling into and completing wells in them are continually rising while presenting unique
environmental problems. Producing gas from unconventional reserves proﬁtably, safely, and in amounts demanded by the market requires
increasingly sophisticated recovery methods.
Gas recovery from unconventional reserves will be explored on September 30 – October 2, 2008 at the
Unconventional Gas International Conference & Exhibition to be held at the Hilton Fort Worth, in Fort Worth,
Texas. Planned by the editors of Oil & Gas Journal and an Advisory Board of industry experts, the event will
highlight innovation from unconventional gas plays around the world.

Oil prices change
faster than market
perceptions turn
Market perceptions, whatever they are
and whatever their inﬂuence over oil prices,
take a long time to change.
Analysts blame perceptions when prices
contradict their forecasts. And since all
analysts have been wrong at least once
about oil prices, many of them worry about
the extent to which perceptions inﬂuence
markets.
Yet it’s no great mystery. Perceptions

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

are all that buyers and sellers of oil have to
work with. Some perceptions are just better
than others. And some are acted upon with
better timing.
Market perceptions embedded in public
consciousness turn slower than a laden
tanker.
Politicians in the US, for example, keep
promising to rescue Americans from $4/
gal gasoline. Yet the prices of nonpremium
grades haven’t been that high on a national
average basis for several weeks.
Prices of all oil products are falling because the price of crude oil is plummeting.
It has dropped by $25/bbl since mid-July
and only ﬂuttered when Russia invaded
Georgia and when Hurricane Gustav blew
across the Gulf of Mexico and Louisiana
coast.
Yet the perception remains that prices
are headed the other way. And fees based
on that perception keep showing up.
While jet-fuel prices were rising, American Airlines famously started charging for
the ﬁrst piece of checked baggage. Several
other airlines quickly followed suit.
Now jet fuel prices are falling. They
peaked about the ﬁrst week in July and
have been as much as 96¢/gal below that
level since then in a clearly declining trend.
Yet on Sept. 5, Continental Airlines announced that, to help offset high fuel costs,
passengers on some ﬂights must pay $15
for each parcel submitted to the tender
mercies of its suitcase tossers.
Desperate times call for desperate measures. But Continental’s timing seems poor.
Will there be a backlash?
This writer knows of a lawn service that
hiked its fee by $5/visit, blaming rising
gasoline prices at a time when, in fact,
prices were falling.
Guess who now mows his own yard.
And guess who’s watching fares of
Southwest Airlines, which also ﬂies out of
Houston and still charges nothing for ﬁrst
checked bags.

Storms, OPEC guide oil prices
Front-month crude prices ﬂuctuated at $111-122/bbl through most of August on
the New York Mercantile Exchange but fell sharply Aug. 28-Sept. 5 primarily as Hurricane Gustav proved less of a threat to offshore production and Gulf Coast reﬁning
than some anticipated.
October benchmark US light, sweet crudes dropped $2.56 to $115.59/bbl Aug. 28,
pulled down initially by falling prices in the natural gas market. The contract closed
at $106.23/bbl Sept. 5, having lost $9.20/bbl over the ﬁrst ﬁve trading sessions in
September as the euro dropped to its lowest level against the dollar this year and
as gulf oil and gas operations shut in by Gustav began coming back on stream. As
Gustav was downgraded prior to landfall in Louisiana Sept. 2, traders brushed aside
the price support provided by that storm, and prices fell to a 5-month intraday low of
$105.46/bbl; it slipped to a fresh intraday low of $105.13/bbl Sept. 5 amid concerns of
a weak global economy and declining demand.
But oil prices were up in early trading Sept. 8 as Hurricane Ike ripped through
Cuba. The storm was expected to enter the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on Sept. 9,
headed for the US Gulf Coast. Shell Oil Co. said Sept. 6 that 615 of its 1,400 workers
evacuated ahead of Gustav had returned to work offshore. However, the company
said it would not redeploy the rest “because of the possibility that Hurricane Ike
might enter the Gulf of Mexico and require another evacuation,” ofﬁcials said.
OPEC outlook
“Further impending hurricanes may postpone a quick test of $100/bbl crude and
limit pressure on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to reduce output at its Sept. 9 meeting,” said analysts at KBC Market Services, a division of KBC
Process Technology Ltd. in the UK. “We do not expect Saudi Arabia to take preemptive steps to keep prices above this threshold. But OPEC knows that it must reduce
supplies at some point in the coming months, and any return to double digit crude
prices may be of short duration.”
An OPEC decision to maintain quota levels “could amount to a de facto cut, which
might not be a problem for the Saudis because the 500,000 b/d Arab Extra Light
Khursaniyah ﬁeld could give Saudi Arabia higher per-barrel revenues if it rolls off
heavier production in equal measure,” said analysts at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey
& Co. Inc. (FBR), Arlington, Va., prior to the cartel’s meeting. “The counterbalance, of
course, is that other OPEC producers—especially Iran and Venezuela—require higher
per-barrel prices than Saudi Arabia to fund domestic spending.”
Analysts at the Centre for Global Energy Studies (CGES), London, noted that today’s oil market “looks very different” since the meeting of OPEC ministers in March.
Then, they said, “The outlook for demand growth still appeared relatively robust
and economic weakness was largely conﬁned to the US—at least in the view of
OPEC. Now, oil demand is falling fast in the US and the rest of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development, the economic outlook for the developed
economies appears to worsen by the day, and there are even fears that the slowdown will begin to have an effect on the economic health of the Asian economies
that supply many of the manufactured goods bought in the West. In March, oil prices
were marching upwards, propelled, according to OPEC, by the weakness of the US
dollar, rising inﬂation, and speculation. Oil prices have been falling ahead of the
September meeting.”
CGES analysts said, “The change in market sentiment from bullish to bearish is
amply illustrated by the lack of any real price response to the loss of 1 million b/d of
light, sweet Caspian crude in early August after an explosion on the [Baku-TbilisiCeyhan] oil pipeline and the closure of the export routes across Georgia, or the
loss of 1.3 million b/d of production as Hurricane Gustav swept through the Gulf of
Mexico.”
They observed, “With oil prices still above $100/bbl there have been few calls
for a cut in the organization’s output quotas, although the usual suspects, led by
Venezuela and Iran, have been calling for a reduction in output by those membercountries, particularly Saudi Arabia, who are exceeding their output quotas.” CGES
said, “Should oil prices continue to fall, Saudi Arabia will come under pressure from
other OPEC members to unwind some of its recent production increases, but there
is every indication that the kingdom shares the desire of other member-countries to
prevent oil prices from falling much below $100/bbl.”

for production wells. The dual-activity derrick’s capability allows drilling tasks to be performed in parallel
rather than sequentially as with conventional oﬀshore
rigs. The result is time and cost savings for clients. Also,
the rigs’ water depth capability allows drilling in water
depths previously unreachable before the development
of these latest generation drillships.
The Discoverer Spirit, as one example, set several
world water depth records. In May 2001, the vessel
drilled in 9,687 feet of water in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
The rig surpassed that record later that year, drilling in
9,727 feet of water in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In 2003,
the Discoverer Deep Seas, working for Chevron, became
the ﬁrst rig in history to drill a petroleum well in more
than 10,000 feet of water. The well was spud in 10,011
feet of water in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico while drilling
the operator’s Toledo well in Alaminos Canyon Block
951. The Discoverer Enterprise also has set its share of
records and is known as the world’s ﬁrst dual-activity
deepwater drilling rig and the ﬁrst DP drillship to ofﬂoad produced well ﬂuids to a shuttle barge.
These three rigs continue to drill deepwater and ultra-deepwater wells, making such drilling seem almost
routine due to their technology and eﬃciency. Their
capabilities and performance led Transocean to develop
an Enhanced Enterprise-Class vessel for drilling deeper
wells in deeper waters to meet anticipated future drilling requirements. As a result of the positive drilling experience with the Discoverer Deep Seas, Chevron became
the ﬁrst operator to contract the Enhanced EnterpriseClass design vessels, the new Discoverer Clear Leader and
the Discoverer Inspiration.
With the oﬀshore drilling industry in the midst of
an uprecedented up cycle, the Enhanced EnterpriseClass drillships oﬀer operators yet another cuttingedge tool to access and develop petroleum reserves
faster, more eﬃciently and safely in this time of record
commodity prices.
And while these rigs are new, Transocean is building them backed by more than 50 years of experience in
introducing the world’s most technologically advanced
and highest-performing oﬀshore drilling rigs.

Ultra-Deepwater
Drillship

y applying lessons learned from building and operating its three EnterpriseClass drillships and combining them with equipment and power upgrades and
systems enhancements, Transocean has developed the industry’s state-of-theart Sixth-Generation drillships designed for drilling 40,000-foot wells in up to 12,000
feet of water.
Now, the Discoverer Clear Leader and four other Enhanced Enterprise-Class drillships are poised to deliver more eﬃcient drilling operations and capabilities from bow
to stern. Greater ﬂexibility and capacity for materials and tubular handling, blow out
preventers (BOPs) and subsea trees are just a few of the many new enhancements. The
rig’s mud system can save the operator days when switching from circulating mud to

Transocean’s patented dual-activity drilling technology with some drilling operations
performed with fewer rig crew on the drill ﬂoor, increasing crew safety.
The top drive drilling system, designed by Transocean and Aker Kvaerner Maritime
Hydraulics, is the most robust and powerful system today. Dubbed the modular derrick drilling machine (MDDMTM), the unit is a 1,250-ton system for four Enhanced
Enterprise-Class drillships (Discoverer Luanda will be equiped with a 1,000-ton unit). It
is designed to operate for 10 years between major overhauls. Should the MDDM require
repairs, the system’s modules can be changed out quickly oﬀshore, saving the operator
days of waiting and repair time for a traditional top drive.

Birth of the Sixth-Generation drillship
The birth of the Discoverer Clear Leader, the ﬁrst of ﬁve of Transocean’s Enhanced Enterprise-Class rigs to be delivered, began when the world’s largest drilling contractor saw
a developing market for new high performance ultra-deepwater drillships. Transocean
began conversations with several operators about their future requirements and learned
that the type of wells they anticipated drilling would require a rig that could go beyond

even the world water-depth record of 10,011 feet of water
set by Transocean’s drillship Discoverer Deep Seas.
“We took the Enterprise-Class drillship design and
incorporated all of the lessons learned from about 15
rig years of operation,” said Mike Hall, Transocean’s Vice
President, Newbuilds. “We incorporated things that we
knew we could do better and things that needed to be
of higher capacity in order to handle the types of wells
that are anticipated, primarily in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico
– very deep, long reach and deviated wells.”
“We saw equipment that could
be enhanced to perform better,
with more robust designs, more
capability, and more user-friendly designs,” Mr. Hall added.
The result is ﬁve new Enhanced Enterprise-Class drillships under construction or on
order that are similar in size to
the Enterprise-Class Fifth-Generation drillships with greatly
extended capabilities for the
types of wells operators anticipate drilling in the future.
“The Enhanced EnterpriseClass drillship began with a hull similar in size to the Enterprise-Class rigs and we optimized
ized it, changing the hull
form to enhance motion characteristics,
eristics, deck load capacity and mobilization speed, while

The ﬁrst and third Enhanced Enterprise-Class rigs to be
delivered, Discoverer Clear Leader and Discoverer Inspiration, are contracted by Chevron for work in the U.S. Gulf of
Mexico. The second rig, Discoverer Americas, will work for
StatoilHydro in the Gulf, while the fourth unit, Discoverer
Luanda, is contracted to BP for work oﬀshore Angola. The
ﬁfth, as yet unnamed drillship, is contracted for operations
oﬀshore India for Reliance Industries.

High capacity derrick houses new MDDMTM
The high capacity derrick has a 2.5-million-pound hookload
capacity and is designed around the 1,250-ton MDDM.
This compares with a 2.0-million-pound capacity on the

8

Enterprise-Class units that utilize 750-ton top drive systems. The Enhanced Enterprise-Class handling system
incorporates a crown and traveling block with an active
heave compensator drawworks compared with a crownmounted compensator on the Enterprise-Class rigs.
With the active heave compensator, the driller has the
ability to more ﬁnely tune weight on bit (WOB) during
many of the drilling and coring operations. “Because of the
more ﬁnely tuned weight on each type of bit to optimize

drilling performance, we have better recovery of cores and
we get better drilling performance and operation,” Mr.
Hall said. “Transocean has a lot of conﬁdence in the active
heave d
drawworks
has bbeen operating them
h
k and
dh
h on a number of our deepwater rigs.”
The MDDM, jointly developed by Transocean and Aker
Kvaerner MH, overcomes some issues that were common
among the top drive drilling systems in the ﬂeet. “We
wanted a unit that was more robust that could conﬁdently
go 10 years between major overhauls,” Mr. Hall explained,
“and that could be repaired much more quickly in the ﬁeld
if and when repairs became necessary.”
Transocean and Aker Kvaerner MH designed the MDDM’s duty cycles and load capacities so they can be used
at or near their rated capacity for most of the expected 10
years. Also, the long–reach, deep wells that are anticipated
to be drilled in the Gulf require a stronger top drive than
currently exists, Mr. Hall pointed out.

Discoverer Clear Leader
“The previous top drives perform the way they were
designed to perform,” Mr. Hall said. “However, the higher usage and the more challenging type of drilling that is
conducted on the deep wells requires a more robust unit
to mitigate potential operating problems.”

Additionally, the MDDM was designed to rest on
the rig ﬂoor during repairs, eliminating any repair and
maintenance operations that previously would have been
done in the derrick.
A prototype MDDM was completed and tested and the
ﬁrst few p
production models have been sent to the shipyard. The p
prototype unit that was built with modular components w
will become a ﬂeet spare for Gulf of Mexico operations. A slightly smaller version of the MDDM, capable
of handling
handlin 1,000 tons, is being designed for the Discoverer Luanda
Luanda, which is not expected to drill wells as long or
as deep as those anticipated in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.

Efﬁcient aand safer systems

In addition to a longer life, the MDDM was designed for
safer, faster and more eﬃcient maintenance. The MDDM
includes a redundant lubrication system featuring online

that eliminate manriding operations, dual, redundant drives
and troubleshooting, and oﬄine load path inspection.
Should repairs become necessary, they can be performed
quickly in the ﬁeld due to the unit’s modularity rather than
having to ship the unit onshore for repairs, a process that
could take days. Today, even if a rig has a complete spare top
drive, it can still take days to remove and replace it. With the
MDDM, Transocean expects replacing a module will require
no more than about eight hours.

Company Profile

On board from the start
When Schlumberger was invited to participate in the design and build process for Transocean’s two
new ultra-deepwater drill ships, the Discoverer Clear Leader and the Discoverer Inspiration, the
company faced three technical challenges:
First, to build the largest cementing units in the world. Second, to design a robust wireline system that would allow the
vessel’s twin derricks to both be used at the same time, and third, to install interchangeable well-testing equipment
that could be replaced quickly at sea.
Such challenges are nothing new, but the way Schlumberger addressed them was.
People, process and technology
The Discoverer Clear Leader core team has been in place since January, 2007. From a people, process and technology
prospective, it has been one team with Transocean, the client and the different service partners. That decision has been
key to the success of the project so far. When the ship is completed in 2009, the commissioning process should be
nearly seamless, because things that typically go wrong will have already been worked out.
“The exceptional thing is that we were invited to be a part of the Clear Leader project from early on,” says Lees
Rodionov, Chevron account manager for Schlumberger.
“By havi
having input at such an early stage, we could be sure that the components we deliv
deliver are technically right and ﬁt-for-purpose. It is a unique and very
collaborative w
way to work.”

Company Profile

“The ﬁrst of the two ultra-deepwater cementing packages, the one for
the Discovery Clear Leader, was designed, manufactured and tested, then
delivered to Korea by air in just eight months,” says Red Bryant, lead designer
of the system.
“With our industry’s history of long lead times, that was an almost impossible achievement. Conﬁdence in our technical ability to meet the goal was one
reason that Schlumberger was awarded the contract.”
A hidden wireline
The wireline package for the Discoverer Clear Leader is a robust version of similar units on other drill ships, with one notable exception. The cable runs through
a special tray that is hidden below the rig ﬂoor. With the dual-derrick system,
that feature allows a crew to run the wireline from one derrick without having to
shut down the second rig.
The most noticeable feature is a specially designed wireline unit and
capstan that was developed for this application. Utilizing a 330HP engine, the
wireline unit/capstan combination will be capable of pulling 24,000 lbs of line
tension at speeds of 25,000 fph and reaching depths exceeding 40,000 ft.
While that is beyond the limits of current cable technology, the system is designed for the future.
In addition, heavy-duty sheave wheels were developed to handle the additional cable tensions. Sheave wheels under the ﬂoor and in the derrick are what
guide the cable from the spool into the well. If needed, the cable can also be
threaded through the rig‚s top drive, using a special top-entry access system.
“This wireline package is very robust,” says Bob Kern, wireline engineer,
Schlumberger. “If our client does eventually want to drill a well to 40,000 feet,
this is the ﬁrst wireline system that can handle it.”
A ﬂexible design for well tests
One of the most interesting features of the Discoverer Clear Leader and its sister
ship is that well test ﬂuids are designed to ﬂow directly into the hull of the ship
itself, rather than a barge tendered nearby. The ships will each have a capacity
of more than 100,000 barrels, and they will be able to test wells at ﬂow rates
up to 20,000 barrels a day.
The ability to ﬂow onto the ship greatly improves the efﬁciency of a
testing program, since scheduling tests no longer depends on the availability of barges.
Schlumberger has had experience outﬁtting Transocean’s Enterprise-classs ships before, when it designed and
installed the well testing equipment on the Discoverer Enterprise itself.
One difference between the Discoverer Enterprise and the Discoverer Clear Leader is that the well testing
equipment on the ﬁrst Enterprise-class vessel was built as part of the ship. For the newer vessels, the client wanted
the test equipment to be interchangeable between the two vessels, and to have the ability to replace it quickly if the
ﬂuid-handling requirements change.
The system Schlumberger delivered was a combination of standard and non-standard well testing equipment;
part of the challenge was bringing the two together.
To meet the client’s objectives, design engineers used mobile equipment that can be ordered, transported
and installed at sea within weeks. Speciﬁc components were then piped into the standard package to increase
the system’s capabilities.
Looking ahead
The well test package, like most other aspects of the Transocean’s Enhanced Enterprise-Class ships, is ready when it
is time to push beyond the limits of current technology.
“Quite often, companies design and deliver something that meets a challenge today,” says Dennis Foret, North
American marketing manager for Well Testing Services, “but by the time they deliver it two years later, the client is
already up against the wall with new challenges. Transocean’s Enhanced Enterprise-Class ships are designed to drill
in water depths as deep as 12,000 feet. While our clients may not be ready to do that yet, they are certainly looking
ahead. That’s a very good thing, and we are excited to be part of the team.”

ing, single stands are moved from the pipe deck via a
knuckle boom deck crane to a catwalk machine and then
to the drill ﬂoor. Pick up/lay down machines secure the
pipe, pick it up and present it to the pipe racking machine
inside the derrick. Practically the only pipe handling performed by ﬂoorhands is handling the pipe from the pipe
deck to the catwalk area where the catwalk machines can
do their job.
Drillers performing the drilling operation and assistant drillers operating the pipe-handling equipment are
housed in a state-of-the-art cabin that features Cyber-

The Enhanced Enterprise-Class vessels feature a dedicated subsea tree production preparation area on the port
side of the moonpool that is protected from waves and

Company Profile

Trelleborg CRP, Inc is the Worldwide Leader
in Drill Riser Buoyancy Solutions
Trelleborg CRP Inc. leads the world in the supply of drill riser
buoyancy modules in the ever changing deepwater arena. During the last 40 years of offshore exploration, Trelleborg CRP has
become the client’s supplier of choice. Worldwide, we have engineered, produced and delivered nearly 80% of all drilling and
production riser buoyancy modules in service today. During our
long history we have gathered numerous industry “ﬁrsts,” and
today our Ultra M.I.S. drill riser buoyancy technology gives our
customers unsurpassed durability and safety. We are proud to
have been chosen by Transocean to supply our Ultra M.I.S. drill
riser buoyancy for their Enhanced Enterprise-Class drillships.
Industry Leader
The increasing global demand for oil and gas has resulted in
man’s continuing pursuit to explore for resources in ever deeper
and more challenging waters. This has led to a need for lighter,
stronger, safer and more cost effective engineered solutions in
the buoyancy market. Throughout its offshore division, Trelleborg
CRP Inc. has been at the forefront of technological advances.
We are proud to have been the ﬁrst to pioneer the development
of the hollow glass microsphere in the 1940s and continuing
through holding the record for the deepest operating drill riser
buoyancy modules at 10,000 ft. Today, Trelleborg is pleased too have been awarded the ﬁrst production orders for
11,000 and 12,000 ft drill riser buoyancy to be delivered in 2009.
9. In the very near future, we will have completed ongoing qualiﬁcations that will allow our drill riser buoyancy to be used
sed to depths of 15,000 ft, even though the company
routinely provides ROV buoyancy rated for depths greater than 15,000
5,000 ft.
Expanding to meet the requirements of our customers
To allow Trelleborg CRP to remain at the forefront, we are ﬁnishing an aggressive upgrade of
our present facility in Houston, investing $20 million to expand the capability of our existing
plant. This expansion not only will allow Trelleborg to quadruple the capacity of a facility that
already was the largest in the world, but add state of the art equipment and processes. When
completed, Trelleborg’s upgraded facility will be able to produce more buoyancy in one location
than all other buoyancy manufacturers combined. In addition, our state-of-the-art buoyancy
testing center, located at our plant in Houston is home to the largest privately-owned test tank
in the world. This hydrostatic test chamber allows us to instrument test up to three buoyancy
elements simultaneously. There are two smaller test tanks that supplement the larger tank.
To meet the growing industry demand, a fourth pressure vessel has just been added, giving
Trelleborg even more testing capability.
Ultra M.I.S. buoyancy provides safety and durability
Our “Ultra M.I.S.” drill riser buoyancy is the safest and most durable syntactic foam on the market
arket today. It was designed through a coordinated effort between Transocean and Trelleborg CRP engineering. Ultraa M.I.S. buoyancy was
engineered to improve the safety on rigs by minimizing the risk associated with broken pieces of buoyancy falling
during the running and pulling of riser. In addition, the new Ultra M.I.S. elements have convincingly demonstrated a
dramatic advance in structural properties. The Ultra M.I.S. system provides virtually a two-fold increase in mechanical
strength as well as buoyancy elements that have the ability to accommodate nearly twice the deﬂection before sustaining damage when compared with a non-M.I.S. buoyancy element. This has clear implications for health and safety, and
would ease and minimize the cost of any repair of the elements.
Experience
For over 60 years, our experience and technological innovations have enabled Trelleborg CRP to become the worldwide
leader in syntactic foam engineered systems. These highly engineered systems have been included in some of the
world’s most notable projects with great success. Today our worldwide network of sales and service coupled with our
newly expanded capacity and technological innovations assures the industry of superior quality and unsurpassed service before and after the sale. Trelleborg CRP: the world-wide provider of comprehensive syntactic foam solutions.

“We have investigated the Hex pump and conducted
design reviews and we have a lot of conﬁdence in them,”
Mr. Hall said. “We have Hex pumps operating in some of
our rigs now.”
Installing ﬁve mud pumps on the ﬁrst and third drillships for Chevron anticipates a drilling program where
a ﬁfth pump contributes additional eﬃciency
to the drilling program. The ﬁfth mud pump
also provides redundancy in the event one
pump is down.
The ﬂuid system volume capacity is about
20,000 barrels of drilling mud and completion
ﬂuids compared with a mud capacity of 15,400
barrels on the earlier Enterprise-Class rigs.
The ﬂuid handling system on the Enhanced
Enterprise-Class rigs have separate and independent pits for mud and completion ﬂuids.
The dedicated piping, pumps and pits for drilling mud and completion ﬂuids removes the
requirement to wash out all of the piping, the
pumps and the pits before converting from
drilling mud to completion ﬂuids and back,
which typically can take several days.

and we now monitor engine events and the power plant
longer before deciding to take part of the plant off line,”
Mr. Hall said.
The system also includes an advanced generator–protection scheme that works to counter electrical problems.
This particular system, developed by Transocean, is used

Revolutionary power system
In order to power all of the Enhanced Enterprise-Class rig’s systems, Transocean selected
MAN Diesel engines, which are very robust
with plenty of additional power capacity. Each
rig will have six engines divided into two engine
rooms. The new rigs feature DP2 dual redundant dynamic positioning systems for station
keeping. Transocean worked with Siemens to
implement an electrical distribution system designed by
Transocean to signiﬁcantly reduce the possibility
ty of electrical power interruptions during operations. The system begins by not automatically shutting down an engine
gine when it
behaves erratically.
Instead, the system’s special diagnostic software analyzes situations in conjunction with a number of modeling techniques that aid in predicting what could happen.
The engine will shut down automatically if the system’s
prediction is for failure.

While many enhancements made from lessons learned
are designed for signiﬁcantly improved operating performance and eﬃciency, safety remains the number one
priority in the vessels’ operation. All equipment has been

“We are trying to eliminate the risk of anything coming loose and dropping from the derrick onto the rig

any kind of operations that require manriding. “We don’t
pick up people in a riding belt unless it is absolutely necessary,” explained Mr. Hall. “Most of the systems are designed where all routine maintenance and repair work
occurs at a location where we can access the equipment

MAN Diesel Powers Latest State-of-the-art Drillships
With 250 years experience as a business, 110 of these in the diesel industry,
MAN Diesel is a well-reputed company with a thoroughly tested product. Last
year, the U.S. drilling contractor Transocean chose MAN Diesel to provide the
power to ﬁve new Enhanced Enterprise-Class drillships, thereby ensuring a
reliable and efﬁcient result.
It is a complex and technical challenge to provide a complete power supply system to a
modern drillship. For this task, you need a reliable and experienced provider. Transocean
chose MAN Diesel as the provider of the power supply system for ﬁve new Enhanced
Enterprise-Class drillships on order and under construction at Daewoo Shipbuilding and
Marine Co. Ltd. (DSME) in Korea. The six generating sets ordered for each drillship use
the MAN 14V32/40 engine which will be manufactured by STX Engine Co., a MAN Diesel
licensee in Kor
Korea. Even though the engine is manufactured by a licensee, it is built according to the drawings and speciﬁcations provided by MAN Diesel, and all tests are
performed as sspeciﬁed by the customer.

shipyard has “learned a lot of good lessons from past vessels
that they’ve carried over to our subsequent drillships.”
“Working with the shipyard is really a partnership. We
work together and try to help each other where we can, and
so far it has worked out very well,” Mr. Adcock concluded.

Ongoing quality assurance
Transocean’s engineering team includes 10 people who
are responsible for reviews and approvals during the ongoing engineering process. Inspections during construction ensure that the shipyard is following the correct
procedures that will result in the delivery of the highest
quality product.
The inspection and quality control staﬀ includes construction managers, supervisors and inspectors who are
responsible for ensuring inspections during construction,
equipment FATs and various installations on the rigs.
The shipyard is basically responsible for the engineering,
construction, commissioning and
delivery of the drillships.
“The shipyard uses a system
called In Process,” Mr. Adcock said.
“The job is never stopped or held
up for the inspections; they are
done in process jointly by Transocean inspectors and the DSME
QA/QC department.”

coverer Inspiration, which entails assembling the various
“blocks” that will be welded together to make up the vessel. In this case, most of the inspection relates to this construction phase, such as ensuring good welds.
Almost all of Transocean’s inspection team members at
DSME are Koreans who speak English with the inspection
team’s managers. As a result, the Transocean inspection
team communicates eﬀectively not only with the engineers on DSME’s staﬀ but also with the shipyard workers,
including welders, pipe ﬁtters and electricians.

Factory acceptance testing
All the equipment is subject to a FAT before it is shipped
to DSME. The test is conducted for all critical equipment;
that is, engines, generators, drilling equipment, electrical
switchboards and switchgear, among other items. Transocean’s shipyard inspectors go wherever the equipment is
being tested. There is also a team in Houston which will at-

Inspection schedules
Juggling the schedules of the inspection team among the multiple drillships under construction is not an
easy task. However, because inspections are organized around the current construction phase, scheduling
is made less complex. For example,
the Discoverer Clear Leader was in the
commissioning phase in mid-2008
with a commissioning team aboard the
he vessel. Most of the
heavy construction on the Discoverer Americas, the second
rig, had been completed at that time and
nd equipment was being installed. An inspection team assigned
gned to that rig monitored equipment installation and commissioning.
Heavy construction was ongoing for the third rig, Dis-

to other priorities in the shipyard. Should any issues arise
during the testing, the equipment manufacturer corrects
the situation before the equipment is shipped to DSME.

Only a few instances have prevented equipment from being shipped as originally scheduled, due to remedial work,

but that is the reason for the testing.
The Enhanced Enterprise-Class drillships under construction and on order at DSME are almost identical. Although certain equipment may be similar or even identical, each undergoes the testing process. For example, in
mid-2008, the engines for the second vessel had been installed after testing while the factory acceptance testing
for the third rig’s engines was in progress. This process will
continue until all ﬁve of the drillships’ engines have been
tested and accepted.

Validating the system software
With these state-of-the-art drillships, it is important that
the software for running the vessels’ systems is correct.
Mr. Adcock’s quality control/quality assurance team also
gets involved here. The team ensures that the software is
accurately monitoring and operating the various systems

during the FATs. In some cases ﬁnal software conﬁguration takes place on board the rig during the testing and
commissioning phase.
“When we ﬁnalize the software for the ﬁrst vessel,” Mr.
Adcock said, “we should be able to download the software
for the subsequent vessels with few modiﬁcations.”
“That should reduce our future commissioning time
on the subsequent vessels significantly,” Mr. Adcock
emphasized.
“Also, at Transocean, we have speciﬁc ways we want to
operate our dynamic positioning control system and our
power management system,” Mr. Adcock said. “As a result,
we work with the vendors to adapt their software to meet
our operating philosophies.”
Once again, it’s a team eﬀort, and everyone involved
looks forward to a successful startup of the Discoverer
Clear Leader and her sister units.

Discoverer Clear Leader

Operational readiness
key to success

T

he single most important key to Transocean’s success of more than 50 years of
pioneering new generations of oﬀshore drilling rigs has been its people, and the ultra-deepwater drillship Discoverer Clear Leader is no exception. Led by Dan Haslam,
Rig Manager – Performance, the rig in August 2008 was in full swing of becoming operationally ready and crewed with the best possible personnel – from ﬂoorhands to toolpushers, motormen and chief electricians. Going from the shipyard to drilling in the U.S. Gulf
of Mexico requires thousands of hours of work by people from Transocean, Chevron, the
shipyard and third-party companies. But it’s Mr. Haslam who takes the lead with every key
entity, as well as with Transocean’s functional departments, including Human Resources,
Engineering, Technical Support, Operations, QHSE, Maintenance and Procurement.

The consummate drilling rig
For Chevron, which is contracting the Discoverer Clear Leader and Discoverer Inspiration to
operate in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Mr. Haslam ensures that everything the client requires
will be ready. All newbuilds are complex, but the Discoverer Clear Leader goes beyond standard features. Besides Transocean’s patented dual-activity drilling systems, the rig has a
new and enhanced top-drive system, an expanded high-pressure mud-pump system, and
expanded completions facilities.
Working with Chevron on the Discoverer Clear Leader and Discoverer Inspiration has led
to this ultimate drilling machine.
“Chevron has a lot of experience operating the Discoverer Deep Seas, one of our Enterprise-Class drillships,” Mr. Haslam said. “They have been a phenomenal partner in helping
make the Enhanced Enterprise-Class rigs the exceptional drilling rigs that they are going
to be. Transocean knows how to operate a rig but Chevron has been able to tell us, from
an operator’s standpoint, everything they need to drill a deepwater well.”

Assembling the rig crew
While the rig was being constructed, Mr. Haslam continued the challenging task of assem-

Deepwater testing
If you want to put a valve and actuator to the test, lower it 11,000 feet beneath the sea. The Magnum Subsea Gate
Valve and Actuator are a prime example of WOM’s engineering, design, and manufacturing abilities. Thoroughly
tested and approved, Magnum Subsea Gate Valves and Actuators surpassed the stringent API 17D Speciﬁcation for
Subsea Wellhead and Christmas Tree Equipment. A 3-1/16” 15,000 psi Magnum Subsea Gate Valve easily passed
the required number of cycles at 4038 meters (13,250 ft.) of water depth. An additional non-required test was
conducted by WOM where the actuator was cycled 4,500 times at full working pressure, proving reliability and
safety in tough subsea operations. The results were veriﬁed by DNV.

bling a well-experienced rig crew. Fortunately, Transocean
across its ﬂeet has experienced crews available who have
been working with highly technical operating systems and
equipment for years. The majority of the senior and midlevel crew are being chosen from among Transocean’s three
Enterprise-Class drillships and the rest of the company’s
p y
Fifth-Generation ﬂeet, which have technology similar to that on the Enhanced
Enterprise-Class vessels.

ing Transocean ﬂeet, the company has implemented various programs to accelerate recruiting and training.
“For recruiting, we have launched an internal, Webbased system so that people can be found from within
our own workforce using the theme: ‘We’re Building More
Than Just Rigs.
g We’re Buildingg Careers,’” Mr. Haslam said.

Crewmembers already on the rig
About 55 people for the Discoverer Clear
Leader crew were in Korea while the rig
was being built, supporting the project
team by providing operational input
and assisting with commissioning. This
process aided in a smooth commissioning phase, and ensured the crew became
intimately knowledgeable about the
rig’s equipment and systems. The crew
members performing these tasks primarily ﬁlled supervisory rig positions.
Additional crew will be assigned to
transit the rig to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.

vron.
“We are in a much better position to crew our state-ofthe-art rigs than we were seven or eight years ago with the
last round of newbuilds,” Mr. Haslam said, “At that time
we didn’t have any Fifth-Generation drillships or semisubmersibles from which to draw our crews.
“As such, all the crews at that time came from conventional, single-activity rigs that had nowhere near the level
of mechanization we see on the latest-generation units.”
Transocean has been continuously training crews to
operate the Enhanced Enterprise-Class vessels. “We have
been taking advantage of any extra beds available on our
existing rigs to expose personnel to similar systems, making them ready to support the Enhanced Enterprise-Class
rigs as they are delivered,” Mr. Haslam said. “Again, we are
leaps and bounds ahead of where we were with the last
round of newbuilds.”
In order to man the Enhanced Enterprise-Class vessels
and maintain a high level of competency within the exist-

Overall, Transocean’s recruitment plan for newbuild
rigs includes approximately 2,000 new hires during the
next few years as the new rigs are delivered and crews are
transferred from other rigs to operate them.
“We have people right now within the Transocean
ﬂeet that are ready for promotions. These individuals
have been identiﬁed through our succession planning
and employee appraisal process, and we know what additional training they need to become outstanding operators on the new vessels,” Mr. Haslam said. “The existing
rigs that provided the newbuild drillship crews will promote internally and the new hires will ﬁll in their positions,” he added. “Across our ﬂeet, we have eﬀective programs to recruit high-potential people from areas such
as maritime academies for our marine departments, and
from the military who have received training in electrical
areas. So our focus remains on hiring the best people,
training them with the best on-the-job training program,
and mentoring them so we can provide the safest, most
reliable and eﬃcient services for our clients.
In short, success is all about the people.

Discoverer Clear Leader

Innovative system to
radically raise reliability
and availability of power
generation, propulsion
and drilling systems

T

he power generation and propulsion system on Transocean’s newbuild ﬂeet is
designed to fully meet the most demanding conditions during the missions of
these modern drilling vessels. Developing such resilience in a Marine Power and
Propulsion System required a step change in overall system predictability. Transocean
achieved this step change during the deployment of the “Sixth-Generation Power and
Propulsion System.” The Sixth-Generation system’s eﬃciencies also will help reduce
emissions on the Discoverer Clear Leader and on the four other Enhanced EnterpriseClass drillships. Eventually, the system will be installed on other rigs in the Transocean
ﬂeet. In addition, the technology already is attracting the interest of wind farms and
hybrid ship power systems which are seeking the same beneﬁts.
“The whole point of the Sixth-Generation power plant is to improve predictability,” said
Ed Bourgeau, Engineering Discipline Manager, Electrical and Power Systems. “If you can
predict the behavior of the machinery, you can take action to accommodate it.”
The new system takes the guesswork out of addressing “hidden” faults that are
not obvious in conventional or older systems. Key elements of the Sixth-Generation
Power System have already been installed on the recently upgraded DP (dynamically
positioned) semisubmersible rig Sedco 702 and the operational results have surpassed
design expectations. Transocean’s Discoverer Clear Leader and its four other future Enhanced Enterprise-Class vessels will be ﬁtted with this system not only on the power
generation and propulsion systems, but also on the drilling power system. In addition,
Transocean plans to install the power system or certain components of it on other existing vessels in its rig ﬂeet.

Three initiatives to improve predictability
Transocean focused on three areas to improve predictability in the power system to
avoid and eliminate faults and the possibility of a power interruptions on a rig. These
initiatives include the Advanced Generator Protection (AGP) for power generation
equipment, Advanced Thruster Control and Protection (ATCAP) for power consump-

tion equipment and Intelligent Power Distribution (IPD)
for power distribution equipment.

AGP initiative
The AGP initiative eliminates the complex real power (KW)
and reactive power (KVAR) load-sharing schemes found
on typical power generation systems. In a surprising return to the forefront of technology, the simple and robust
“droop” regulation technique handles the real and reactive
load sharing. “Droop” regulation is where the main bus
frequency and voltage droops slightly when loaded. This
allows for independent generator operation. This key element of autonomy results in highly predictable behavior
of speed and voltage regulators, so that any faults can
be detected and isolated before they escalate. In short, a
conventional PLC runs a simple real-time diesel/generator
model, compares the model results to the actual situation
and takes action accordingly.
The autonomy of the AGP power system also greatly
reduces the possibility of faults. Unlike conventional sys-

26

tems, there are no real or reactive load-sharing communication lines. This simpliﬁed control and autonomy makes
fault identiﬁcation much easier. In addition, AGP speed
and voltage droop control enables intelligent loads to independently initiate power-management functions.

ATCAP Thruster Control improves load response
“The ATCAP initiative allows intelligent loads like
thrusters and drilling drives to take full advantage of
the droop plant regulation to confirm the main power
plant health and independently modify their power
consumption based upon actual power plant conditions,” Mr. Bourgeau explained.
It eliminates many of the complex requirements and removes the possible fault conditions on these loads.
ATCAP also eliminates large in-rush currents when
connecting large loads such as a propulsion transformer.
The in-rush current (from the initial magnetizing current into the transformer) creates signiﬁcant stresses on a
transformer, pulls the bus voltage down and creates high

currents in the generators. Often, the currents are so high
that multiple generators are needed on the bus to allow a
transformer to be brought on line.
“As part of the ATCAP initiative, Transocean looked at
the loads and asked what can be done to reduce or eliminate this shock loading,” Mr. Bourgeau said. “By using the
drive to magnetize the transformer, we are able to eliminate the shock load entirely and verify with certainty that
the load is healthy before it is connected to the vessel’s medium voltage bus. The elimination of the risk of connecting a faulty transformer or drive is a major step forward on
a DP2-class drilling vessel.”
“Because we have removed the sudden impact of a load
connecting to a bus, for the ﬁrst time we can connect multiple loads simultaneously,” Mr. Bourgeau continued. “As a
result, each diﬀerent load can intelligently decide if it is in

The IPD initiative focu
focuses on distribution transformers,
tie breakers and feeder

ATCAP features, the step load of connecting distribution
power transformers is eliminated. IPD also removes the
possibility of connecting a faulty transformer to the main
bus. This initiative includes several innovations designed
to improve “Tie Breaker” performance by dynamically
changing the tie breaker’s trip levels based on the number
of generators connected and allowing normally opening of
bus ties only after the power transfer is reduced to zero.

System development
One of the major issues involved with a modern power
distribution system is controlling and verifying software
packages on the many digital controllers.

“To write the software and use it on the vessel and
make sure it was tested properly was a challenge,” Mr.
Bourgeau explained. “It took a lot of record keeping. The
equipment we used is much more sophisticated than
that used before.”
Transocean, with the assistance of AKA, an independent engineering ﬁrm, developed a process tool called
“DeviceTrak” TM to aid in the control and veriﬁcation that
the right software is deployed in the right controller now
and for many years of service to come.
“The dynamics of active front-end power-conversion
technology was challenging due to the numerous innovations on the Enhanced Enterprise-Class vessels that are
not present on other rigs,” Mr. Bourgeau continued. “For
example, Transocean runs DC voltage directly on the AC
power cables in the emergency feeders. This has never been done before,
and certainly attracted the attention
of the shipyard engineers.”
The Enhanced Enterprise-Class
vessels also will be the ﬁrst ﬂoating drilling rigs with a 100-meter
DC bus, operating at 1kV and 3,000
amps. This innovative distribution
of power addresses the dynamics
seen in some 20 megawatts of drilling process loads, including two active heave compensated drawworks.

tremely reliable but as technical leaders, we are committed
to continuously improving our performance to meet our
clients’ increasing needs,” Mr. Bourgeau concluded.
Through the companies that worked with Transocean
and Siemens, the key technologies developed for the
Sixth-Generation power plant are being directly exported to the so-called green power industry. IDS of Zurich and AKA of Canada are moving innovations such as
multiple voltage regulators on a common DC bus, direct
use of DC power on AC power lines and energy-based
predictive models directly to wind farms and hybrid ship
power systems.
The Sixth-Generation Power System is a major step
toward the goal of infallible, single diesel, DP operations
with a greatly reduced carbon footprint.

Upgrading existing rigs
Existing Transocean rigs are built to
industry standards; however, plans
call for applying the advantages of
these power innovations ﬂeetwide
wherever possible.
“Sometimes it is just not possible
to modify an entire rig,” Mr. Bourgeau
said. “But there are many elements
of these three initiatives that can be
applied with relatively low impact to
cost and service time on an existing
vessel that will improve power reliability and availability.”

Environmental performance;
reaching the fullest potential

T

ransocean’s Enhanced Enterprise-Class drillships feature state-of-the-art drilling equipment and power management systems for drilling clients’ wells in the
most eﬃcient and cost-saving way. What’s not always visible but is just as important are the rig’s environmental systems to assure nothing goes overboard that could
harm the environment. These preventions include everything from a detailed drainage
system for all ﬂuids, containment systems across all deck spaces, ﬂuid separation systems, biodegradable hydraulic ﬂuids, a moonpool skimming system, an improved mud
system and an innovative power-management system that allows for the computerized
control of the rig’s power for more eﬃcient use and minimized emissions.
Crew training and the establishment of a rig-based “Green Team” ensure that all environmental systems are operated and managed to their fullest potential. The goal: continuous environmental improvement.

Environmentally friendly shipyard
The environmental culture begins at the shipyard in South Korea.
“One of the things that impressed me was the degree of environmental management
at Daewoo Shipyard and Marine Engineering,” said Ian Hudson, Ph.D., Transocean’s
Corporate Environmental Manager. “They have one of the most comprehensive shipyard environmental management systems I have ever seen.”
“DSME implemented a diligent waste segregation system across the entire shipyard.
When the yard sets up a project it brings in a full waste management system and everybody is 100 percent in support of the recycling process. There is not one item out of
place in the entire shipyard,” Mr. Hudson said.
“That is something that impressed me as part of the building process itself. That is
good because it shows environmental responsibility from the yard during the building
process, and because the moment you walk onto the new vessel you are presented with
a very clean space.”
“Anyone who takes that amount of pride in their workplace also takes pride in their

workmanship,” Mr. Hudson continued. “It suggests that
you are in a place where the culture is right and that reﬂects on their performance.”
That results in a premium rig for Transocean, which also
takes extreme pride in its workplace as part of its drive for
optimum drilling performance.

through a ﬁltration system.
Additionally, the rig ﬂoor is built with a containment
pan so that everything that falls on the rig ﬂoor will go
into the pan. It is piped separately to the weir system and
then to a tank system. Also, any ﬂuids from the deck areas
will drain to a separate tank via a unique set of piping, in
eﬀect creating a double containment system for ﬂuids.

Environmental lessons learned
As Transocean applied drilling improvements
learned from the Enterprise-Class vessels to
the Enhanced Enterprise-Class, numerous environmental lessons were applied to the Discoverer Clear Leader to upgrade the environmental
aspects of it and Transocean’s other new SixthGeneration drillships. Beginning from the bottom of the vessel and working up, an important
enhancement is the drainage and containment
system on the rigs.
“The Enterprise-Class vessels feature an excellent ﬂuid containment system but the new
system takes it to a diﬀerent level,” Mr. Hudson
said. “We are able to take speciﬁc ﬂuid streams
from speciﬁc areas of the rig, which have their
own drainage system, through a triple barrier
or ‘weir’ system.”
The idea is that most of the solids are removed before the ﬂuid goes into a complex
array of settling tanks in the vessel’s hold.
When a speciﬁc area of the rig is cleaned, the
drainage could contain unusable mud or other
er drilling
ﬂuids. Due to the diﬃculty of moving that ﬂuid
d through
the containment system, it’s best to avoid mixing
xing ﬂuids
if possible. To mitigate that situation, the Enhanced Enterprise-Class design goes to great lengths to keep the
diﬀerent areas of the vessel drained to separate tanks.
“This Transocean-designed drainage and containment
system is a real advantage because it means we can treat
diﬀerent ﬂuids speciﬁc to their attributes,” Mr. Hudson
explained. “For example, drainage from the drill ﬂoor has
diﬀerent components than drainage from the deck areas.
It means we can treat the speciﬁc ﬂuids rather than treating them holistically.”
The diﬀerent, large-volume tanks below deck are used
to remove the solids, skim the oil oﬀ the top and run it

30

Another scenario involves retaining ﬂuids that cannot
be diverted overboard. During heavy rainstorms, the deluge needs to be moved oﬀ the rig quickly, which is accomplished with double plugs to release the clean-deck space
seawater and rainwater. If it is suspected that the rainwater contains anything that could aﬀect the environment,
the drainage system has the capability to re-route the water to below deck for treatment.
“If the decks are clean and the rig is clean, it’s just rainwater falling on the deck and there is no problem diverting
that overboard,” Mr. Hudson said. “If we have any doubts,
we do a visual check and inspection, and keep the drainage
plate sealed so the water will go into the rig’s drainage system and through an oil and water content monitoring and
separating system. It is then discharged at a speciﬁc level

based upon compliance to clean water regulations.”
In this case, if the water meets a certain discharge standard (15 parts per million),
million) the system automatically allows the separated water to discharge overboard. If the
water doesn’t meet the standard, it is automatically routed
back to the separator for separating and cleaning.

Additional containment areas
Transocean also has provided additional containment for
the spaces below and above the deck where materials designated as hazardous are accumulated. For example, ﬂuids
move through pipework in one of the machinery areas below deck, which includes a containment system for handling
potential leaks. If there is a leak, it is contained in a pan that
is routed to the speciﬁc tank for cleaning. This approach prevents any potential leakage from entering a lower deck.
“I call it bunding, some people call it combing,” Mr.
Hudson noted, “and basically every conceivable space
or area below something that can drip or lose containment is bunded.”
“We paid a lot of attention to details such as this so that
all spaces from top to bottom are contained when it comes
to potential ﬂuid leaks. Every conceivable internal and external space that can be bunded is bunded,” he explained.

Should small spills occur, kits are located around the rig
with cleanup and containment supplies speciﬁc to the different areas of the rig,
rig such as places where chemicals or
hydraulic ﬂuid are used.

Biodegradable hydraulic ﬂuid
Transocean has worked to mitigate or minimize other
potential environmental situations. As an Enhanced Enterprise-Class drillship is highly mechanized, much of its
operations are performed using hydraulics. “We employ
the best hydraulic ﬂuid available in the industry for our
hydraulic systems,” Mr. Hudson said, “and we are ﬁlling
all of our hydraulic systems with what is termed readily
biodegradable hydraulic ﬂuid.”
The non-toxic hydraulic ﬂuid is biodegradable to over 95
percent in seawater. In addition to being used on all of the
Enhanced Enterprise-Class rigs, the ﬂuid is being rolled out
to other rigs in Transocean’s ﬂeet to replace standard hydraulic ﬂuid. Uses include ﬂuid for operating cranes and the
central hydraulic systems. The point behind the biodegradable ﬂuid is that in the unlikely event of a hydraulic ﬂuid
spill, its potential environmental impact is vastly reduced.
The blowout prevention system (BOP) and riser tensioner system also use biodegradable hydraulic ﬂuid, re-

ducing the potential impact due to ﬂuid losses.

Assuring a clean moonpool
Should debris fall into the rig’s moonpool, which is the
open area to the sea just below the drill ﬂoor, the rig is
prepared to recover it immediately with its skimming system, essentially a rotating boom deployed to “sweep” up
moonpool debris.
“We keep the moonpool as clean as possible,” Mr. Hudson said, “but if wind blows something in it we can deploy
the system and skim oﬀ the product.”
The skimming system also means that crewmembers
don’t have to visit the moonpool to keep it clean, further
increasing safety. Besides cleaning debris that has fallen or
been blown into the moonpool, the system also can help
retain any ﬂuids that may have dripped there by accident.

Power management system
Another key area that Transocean focused on is the rig’s
power management system and the engines used to provide power to the rig’s systems.
“We wanted to optimize our engines and the way they
perform to provide a maximum reduction of emissions,”
Mr. Hudson said. “We have the engines conﬁgured for that
and we have a system that will allow us to get the maximum from the engines with the least emissions.”
“The comprehensive power management system on
these rigs will allow us to automatically control and vary
the way we set up the power,” he continued. “There is a
diligent methodology behind matching the power requirements with the engine requirements resulting in more
fuel-eﬃcient and lower-emission engines.”
The low-emission and fuel-eﬃcient engines, supplied
by MAN Diesel, are designed and built to meet current
and anticipated emission standards.

Other improvements
Numerous other improvements, while not as high a proﬁle
as engines, are just as important. For example, in the mud
pit rooms, speciﬁc locking systems and blanking plates
have been installed to eliminate an incorrect valve being
inadvertently opened that could result in a discharge. A
color-coded system lets the crew member know which
valves are not to be opened.

32

Another feature is the use of ﬂuid transfer hoses with
quick-release, dry-break connections, which are used on
the rig’s loading hoses for fuel and other ﬂuids. Should
a hose inadvertently come loose from a connection, the
dry-break feature shuts oﬀ the hose entirely. Transocean
also implemented a rigorous hose replacement program
so hoses are not in use over extended periods, potentially
resulting in breaks and leaks.
Also, much of the rig’s electrical wiring and piping are
in an enclosed tunnel running the entire length of the rig
and removed from the elements to provide an extra level
of protection. That also means that if repairs are necessary, the electrical engineers can work in a protected area,
resulting in a safer and healthier workplace.

Training assures ongoing environmental standards
All of Transocean’s rig crews are trained in the use of
the company’s Environmental Management System. It
is the same on the company’s rigs worldwide so a crewmember changing rigs knows the system regardless of
where he or she works.
“Another thing the crew does is to create a Green Team,”
said Mr. Hudson. “These team members are the environmental champions on the rig.”
Each team helps run the management system, which
includes a comprehensive waste-management program
to minimize waste. Data is collected on areas such as
emissions and waste generation as a way to reduce them.
Waste-segregation stations are color coded and located
in several areas on the rig. State-of-the-art waste compacters compact the waste into diﬀerent recyclable components such as cans, cardboard, paper and rubber. For
three of the Enhanced Enterprise-Class rigs operating
in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, these items will be sent to a
waste-recycling program onshore.
“We will set up every rig with a waste management
plan, display that plan everywhere on the rig so the crew
knows where the waste stations and segregation stations
are, and we can then track the type and volume of waste,”
Mr. Hudson explained. “We will examine the waste volumes and the types of waste and learn how we can reduce the volumes.”
Constantly learning: a major key to Transocean’s continuous environmental improvement.

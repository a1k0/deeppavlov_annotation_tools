COVER
Refining catalyst supply, cost, and availability are concerns at
Marathon Oil’s Garyville, La., refinery, which is nearing completion of a 180,000-b/d expansion from 256,000 b/d. Start-up
will take place later this year or early 2010. Final project cost
has risen to $3.7 billion, from the initial estimate of $3.2 billion
made in 2006. New process units include a 44,000-b/d coker,
a 70,000-b/d hydrocracker, a 65,000-b/d CCR platformer, a
47,000-b/d kerosine hydrotreater, and a 40,000-b/d naphtha
hydrotreater. Oil & Gas Journal’s exclusive Catalyst Report, which
begins on p. 44, updates the outlook for the catalyst market in
the current global recession and reviews some important changes
among producers. Photos from Marathon Oil and Haldor Topsoe.

Interest

Norway eyes $2 trillion oil industry expenditure
Norway hopes to tap into $2 trillion of the oil industry’s expenditure over 2009-13, according to a report published by DouglasWestwood.
The study, which focused on 19 target countries and 26 key
onshore and offshore market areas, was commissioned by Norwegian oil and gas partners INTSOK. The organization works with
Norwegian companies throughout the petroleum chain to do business abroad promoting the nation’s experience, technology, and
expertise.
The report found that increasingly oil and gas will be produced
from deepwater provinces—opening a buoyant market over the
coming decades. Other drivers underpinning the huge rise in expenditures include rising energy demand from the developing
countries, growth in oil prices, and tightness in global energy supplies.
John Westwood, chairman of Douglas-Westwood, said, “The
current economic environment has hit activity levels hard, however, by 2011 it is forecast that overall expenditure will have recovered and beyond this the majority of the selected market sectors are
expected to exhibit growth through 2013.”
He added: “Within the offshore target markets, expenditure is
expected to grow from $163 billion in 2009 to $222 billion in
2013 and onshore markets from $170 billion to $229 billion.”
“Over the next 5 years, we forecast that the total expenditure
within the onshore and offshore INTSOK target markets will total
nearly $2 trillion, compared to about $1.4 trillion over the previous period,” said Westwood.

Indonesia pegs oil, gas spending at $5 billion
Indonesia’s domestic firms will increasingly benefit from expenditures of oil and gas contractors this year due to “aggressive
efforts” by the government, according to a senior official.
R. Priyono, chairman of the country’s upstream oil and gas
regulating agency BPMigas, said domestic firms might be able to

Exploration

&

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

absorb as much as 50 trillion rupiah ($5 billion) from the annual
spending of oil and gas contractors now estimated at 110-150 trillion rupiah/year.
“We don’t set high targets as we have just begun intensifying
the use of local content in the industry,” said Priyono. “We will be
very happy with the 50 trillion rupiah if it can be realized.”
Priyono acknowledged 50 trillion rupiah is not an optimal figure but said it is significantly higher than in previous years when
most contractors spent only 20% of their annual outlay through
local firms.
In an effort to raise the figure to 55% by the end of 2010 and
to 91% by 2025, Priyono and Industry Minister Fahmi Idris signed
an agreement Aug. 21 aimed at increasing the use of locally made
heavy equipment, machines, ships, and offshore rigs for the country’s oil and gas industry.
“We expect to follow up the agreement with more concrete actions,” Priyono said, without providing details.

Seadrill looking into Timor Sea oil spill
Seadrill Ltd. reported that it is working closely with the National
Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority to investigate an Aug. 21 oil
spill involving the Montara platform complex off West Australia in
the Timor Sea.
Seadrill’s West Atlas jack up drilling rig is operating under contract to PTTEP of Thailand. PTTEP owns and operates the Montara platform complex. An oil leak developed on a well adjacent to
where the West Atlas was working, Seadrill said.
All personnel on the West Atlas were safely evacuated, Seadrill
said. The cause of the leak is yet unknown. The Australian Maritime
Safety Authority sent planes to spray chemical dispersants on the
water to help break up the resulting oil slick.
Seadrill said it is making another jack up, the West Triton, available to PTTEP to drill a relief well. Seadrill also sent an accident
investigation team to Australia.
Once the leaking well is under control, Seadrill said its crews
will reboard the West Atlas and assess any damage. ✦

Development

BP’s Tiber one of industry’s deepest wells
BP PLC has reported a giant Gulf of Mexico Lower Tertiary deepwater discovery that is also one of the world’s deepest wells.
Named Tiber, the well went to a total depth of 35,055 ft on
Keathley Canyon Block 102 and found oil in multiple Lower Tertiary (Paleogene) reservoirs, BP said.
The company said Tiber, after appraisal to determine its size,
should be larger than the 3 billion boe that BP expects to recover
from its 2006 Kaskida discovery 45 miles to the southeast.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Kaskida, with more than 800 ft of net pay on Keathley Canyon 292, is under appraisal through 2010. The Kaskida unit covers
51,840 acres on nine blocks. The Kaskida discovery well went to
32,500 ft in 5,860 ft of water. Kaskida interests are BP 73.33% and
Devon Energy Corp. 26.67%.
Andy Inglis, chief executive, BP Exploration & Production, said,
“These material discoveries together with our industry leading
acreage position support the continuing growth of our deepwater
Gulf of Mexico business into the second half of the next decade.”

BP is the gulf’s largest oil and gas producer with net production
of more than 400,000 boe/d. It is working on nine Gulf of Mexico
projects: Atlantis Phase 2, Tubular Bells, Kodiak, Freedom, Kaskida,
Isabela, Santa Cruz, Mad Dog tiebacks, and Great White.
Tiber is nearly 300 miles east-southeast of Corpus Christi, Tex.,
in 4,132 ft of water. It is also 35 miles southeast of the Gunnison

Large gas resource seen in Quebec’s Utica shale
Consulting engineers estimated a prospective resource of 4.28
tcf of natural gas in place in the Ordovician Utica shale in the deep
fairway of Quebec’s St. Lawrence Lowlands.
The estimate of 150 bcf/sq mile is 66% higher than earlier industry figures, said Questerre Energy Corp., Calgary. The range of
the resource is 2.2-8 tcf.
The estimates relate only to company lands that have geology
validated by successful wells, Questerre said.
“The evaluation is focused on the acreage between the two
main geological features, the Yamaska growth fault and Logan’s
Line, where Questerre holds approximately 833,000 gross acres in
the deep fairway,” the company said.
The assessment does not include the shallower Ordovician Lorraine interval but did include results from the recently completed,

NAPE: Frac regulation Washington’s ‘worst threat’
A move to regulate hydraulic fracturing federally is the “biggest threat our industry has ever seen in Washington,” Bruce Vincent, vice-chairman of the Independent Petroleum Association of
America, said Aug. 26.
Joel Noyes, IPAA director of government relations and industry affairs, expressed a low expectation for passage of most of the
Obama administrations frenzied agenda, much of which contains
negative provisions for oil and gas producers.
The atmosphere in Washington is one of “almost chaos,” said
Noyes, and the environment is very partisan. The agenda is so congested because of the Democratic desire to push contentious legislation through before the 2010 election year, he said.
Ninety percent of wells are hydraulically fractured, some dozens
of times, Vincent told the Summer NAPE E&P Forum in Houston.
In the 60 years that the industry has been fracturing wells under
state regulation, no case of fresh water contamination by the procedure has been documented, he said (OGJ Online, July 2, 2009).
Greater frac regulation is coming, predicted William Coates,
president, Schlumberger Oilfield Services North America. The
question is whether the industry can manage enough input that
final rules are formed in a cooperative manner, he said. ✦

NAPE: Rockies gas output just starting to decline

Cairn India starts oil production at Rajasthan

Rocky Mountain operators are just now seeing natural gas production begin to decline, almost a year after they began idling
drilling rigs as prices at the wellhead plummeted.
Prices may fall even farther, however, because the volume of gas
in underground storage is above the average of the last few years
and Colorado figures show production was still growing in this
year’s first and second quarters, said Alan Harrison, vice-president,
Denver region/Piceance basin, Williams Exploration & Production
Co., Tulsa.
The Colorado rig count peaked at 140 in the second half of
2008 and fell to a low of about 40 in recent weeks, Harrison noted
at the Summer NAPE E&P Forum in Houston. Williams, lead operator in the Piceance basin in Garfield County, Colo., is running 8
rigs, down from 28.
Various operators have shut-in at least 300-350 wells in each
of the Barnett, Piceance, and Fayetteville plays, said Bob Fryklund,
vice-president, IHS-Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
Harrison predicted that the rate of decline will steepen fairly
rapidly but didn’t estimate a time frame.
In the Piceance valley area, Williams has driven costs down to a
low of $1.6 million/8,000-ft well by drilling as many as 22 wells/
pad, pumping frac jobs from 2 miles away from the rig, and drilling, completing, and producing gas simultaneously from the same
pad, Harrison said.
It also built a 3,200-ft tunnel and a road with drillsites along
switchbacks to access 60 otherwise undrillable locations in the
highlands part of the basin.

Cairn India Ltd. started oil production at its Mangala field in
Rajasthan state in part of the larger complex of Mangala, Bhagyam,
and Aishwariya (MBA) fields.
Representing the largest of 25 discoveries made by the firm in
the Barmer basin on Block RJ-ON-90/1, Mangala’s initial output
of 30,000 b/d will increase to 130,000 b/d by first-half 2010,
with production rising to a peak of 175,000 b/d over the next 2
years.
According to Cairn, the MBA fields hold nearly 1 billion bbl of
oil recoverable, including proved plus probable gross reserves and
resources of 685 million boe with a further 300 million boe—or
more—with enhanced oil recovery potential.
The firm said initial volumes of oil will be produced through
the first processing train with a capacity of 30,000 b/d. Production will continue to increase until all four processing trains, with a
total capacity of 205,000 b/d, are built and installed by 2011.
Cairn said it is building a 670-km heated and insulated oil pipeline from the Mangala processing terminal to the Gujarat coast. The
first phase is targeted for completion by yearend.
The 24-in. export line will extend from Barmer in Rajasthan to
a coastal location in Gujarat, via Viramgam. It will have an 8-in. gas
line running most of its length, starting from the Raageshwari gas
field on Rajasthan block.
Cairn said a minimum of 32 intermediate power feeding and
heating stations will be built along the length of the oil pipeline,
aimed at helping to maintain the required temperature within the
pipeline.

Processing
Mideast petrochemical complex doubles capacity
Expansion of the petrochemicals complex at Shaiba, Kuwait,
about 25 miles south of Kuwait City, was completed earlier this
summer, according to its engineering contractor Flour Corp., Irving, Tex. The project spanned 5 years.
Fluor began work on Olefins II in July 2004 by providing overall management consultancy and front-end engineering and design
for utilities and infrastructure. Olefins II doubles capacity of the
existing complex that has operated there since 1998 (OGJ, Sept.
15, 1997, p. 36).
In addition to overall management consultancy and FEED, Fluor
handled FEED and engineering, procurement, and construction
management for seawater cooling towers, polyethylene expansion,
expansion of existing utilities and infrastructure, and new utilities
and infrastructure shared with aromatics.
Olefins II also included Fluor oversight of engineering and construction of:
• An 850,000-tonne/year ethane cracker.
• A 600,000-tpy ethylene glycol unit.
• A 450,000-tpy ethyl benzene/styrene monomer unit.
• A debottleneck expansion of an additional 225,000 tpy of
polyethylene capacity at the existing complex.
In 1998, Fluor completed the original complex at Shaiba. In
2005, after completion of FEED work for Olefins II, Fluor was chosen to expand the plant and build a new facility alongside the existing one while integrating the two facilities into a single complex
(OGJ Online, Nov. 12, 2004).
The complex is owned by a joint venture of Dow Chemical Co.,
Kuwait’s Petrochemical Industries Co., Bubyan Petrochemical, and
Qurain Petrochemical Industries.

Shell restarts Utorogu gas plant
Shell Petroleum Development Co. has restarted its 300-MMscfd
capacity gas plant in Utorogu in western Niger Delta after the vandalized Escravos-Lagos Pipeline (ELP) was repaired by the Nigerian
Gas Co.
The explosions on ELP happened in early August. ELP transports
gas from the western delta to Lagos for electric power generation
and industrial use. It also disrupted power supplies at the Egbin
power station in Lagos and elsewhere, meaning that 1,000 Mw was
lost on the national grid.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
According to local reports, militant group Urhobo Revolutionary Army admitted responsibility for the sabotage in protest against
the lack of development in their communities.
The incident has threatened to topple the fragile amnesty brokered between the Nigerian government and militant groups, including the prolific Movement for Emancipation of the Niger Delta
(MEND). This was meant to stop sabotages on oil and gas facilities and enhance oil production. But the initiative is controversial
within MEND with several high-profile figures agreeing to it and
other members determined to continue with their campaign after
the 60 days expires on Oct. 4.
An SPDC spokesman told OGJ that the plant would be slowly
ramped up to full capacity. He said, “Utorogu was shut temporarily
as a precautionary measure following damage to the ELP, and was
restarted on Aug. 19 when repairs were completed.”
The plant is operated by SPDC on behalf of joint venture in
which Shell owns 30%, Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. 55%,
Total SA 10%, and Eni SPA 5%.
Shell is yet to complete repairs at its Soku facility in Rivers State,
which was closed last year following attacks and bunkering of condensate (OGJ Online, Dec. 12, 2008). It supplies about 40% of the
feed gas for the Nigeria LNG plant on Bonny Island.
Soku was briefly restarted for 4 days in April, but was shut again
after condensate theft occurred again.

Costs spiral for Brazil-Venezuela reﬁnery project
Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras), already under fire
from legislators, said the estimated cost of the joint-venture Abreu
e Lima refinery project tentatively stands at $12 billion, or nearly
three times more than the original estimate of $4.05 billion.
"It's important to clarify that the total investments are under
evaluation and will be subject to approval by the executive board
after a technical and economic feasibility study," Petrobras said.
The Brazilian firm said the original estimate of $4.05 billion
came in 2006 during the conceptual project preparation phase,
when the expected capacity of the plant was 200,000 b/d of oil.
At that time, it said the cost of building a refinery was estimated at
about $20,000/bbl of capacity.
Petrobras said the cost rose to $12 billion with the finalization
of the basic plans for the project and the decision to increase its
refining capacity by 15% to 230,000 b/d. It said the upward cost
estimate fits with current construction costs for a refinery, which
have risen to $50,000/bbl of capacity.

Petrobras said in addition to the increase in construction costs,
the budget for the refinery was affected by the depreciation of the
dollar relative to the Brazilian real.
The Petrobras statement came after complaints by opposition
members of a legislative committee, which is investigating alleged irregularities at the mixed capital firm.
The legislators based their complaints on an investigation by
the office of Brazil's controller-general, which allegedly has found
irregularities and over-invoicing and overpricing by companies
hired to build the refinery.

The Abreu e Lima refinery is under construction in Brazil's
northeastern Pernambuco state by Petrobras in association with
Venezuela’s state-own Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA). Site work
at the refinery project, which started last year, is near completion,
the company added.
Earlier this month, Petrobras and PDVSA reached an agreement
in principle on the final details of the joint venture, and the accord is expected to be signed in September, during bilateral trade
talks between presidents of the two countries (OGJ Online, Aug. 6,
2009). ✦

Tr a n s p o r t a t i o n
Energy Transfer completes gas line projects
Energy Transfer Partners LP (ETP) has completed construction
of the 160-mile Texas Independence Pipeline (TIP), which increases its gas takeaway capacity in Texas by an incremental 1.1 bcfd. ETP
also completed the Rulison expansion project in Colorado.
The 42-in. OD TIP system will transport gas from Waha, the
Bossier sands, and Barnett shale in east and north central Texas to
southeast Texas. Originating just west of Maypearl, Tex., and ending near Henderson, Tex., the TIP system connects ETP’s existing
Central and North Texas infrastructure to its East Texas pipeline
network. With the addition of compression, the project can be expanded to transport gas volumes in excess of 1.75 bcfd.
Completion of the TIP system follows the Aug. 1 start of operations on the Midcontinent Express Pipeline (MEP), between Delhi,
La., and Butler, Ala. ETP is a partner in MEP with Kinder Morgan
Energy Partners LP (OGJ, Aug. 10, 2009, Newsletter).
The Rulison expansion project includes the 10-mile, 24-in. OD
Rulison pipeline and the Holmes Mesa compressor station in Garfield County, Colo.
These projects are designed to increase the capacity of ETP’s
South Parachute-Rifle pipeline system. The project will also create
an outlet for producers to access the Meeker processing plant at the
White River hub.
The Rulison line will initially add more than 70 MMcfd of capacity, with the ability to expand to more than 200 MMcfd. The
Holmes Mesa compressor station has more than 9,000 hp of compression.

Tesoro starts ﬂow through Panama pipeline
Tesoro Corp. announced shipment of the first barrels of oil
through the reversed 81-mile Petroterminal de Panama Trans-Panamanian Pipeline from the Atlantic side of the isthmus to the Pacific. The reversal establishes a new conduit for the flow of oil from
the Atlantic Basin to the Pacific and will enable Tesoro to source a
broader range of crude oils to supply its Pacific Rim refining system, Tesoro said.
The first oil shipped through the pipeline was Castilla blend
crude sourced from Colombia, which Tesoro will process at its refineries in California.
Very large crude carriers with 2 million bbl of capacity will
be able to transport West African and other crudes to the port of

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Chiriqui Grande, Bocas del Toro, on the Caribbean for the journey
across the isthmus of Panama.
Crude will be piped to the port of Charco Azul on the Pacific
Coast where it will be received by tankers and shipped to US West
Coast refineries.
BP Products North America signed an agreement with PTP to
ship oil to its US West Coast refineries through the reversed TransPanama Pipeline in May 2008 (OGJ Online, May 28, 2008).

UK’s Dragon LNG begins operations
The UK’s 4.4 million-tonne/year Dragon LNG terminal at Milford Haven, South Wales, has recently completed commissioning
and begun commercial operations (OGJ Online, July 2, 2009).
Commissioning formally began on July 14 with arrival of BG
Group LNG’s the 145,000-cu m carrier Methane Lydon Volney. BG
Group holds a 50% interest in the terminal with Petronas (30%)
and 4Gas (20%).
BG Group (50%) and Petronas (50%) also have agreements
governing capacity rights for a 20-year term, allowing them each
2.2 million tpy of throughput.

Licenses push Gorgon LNG towards reality
Chevron Corp.’s Gorgon project, including a planned three-train,
15 million-tonne/year LNG plant, took another step to realization
Sept. 1 when Australia’s resources and energy minister and Western
Australia’s state petroleum minister revealed they had offered to the
Gorgon partnership five production licenses to cover Io-Jansz and
Gorgon gas fields that will back stop the project.
Partners for the $42 billion project are Chevron 50%, ExxonMobil Corp. 25%, and Royal Dutch Shell PLC 25%.
The offshore gas fields that are the subject of the licenses will
be developed via subsea wells and two pipelines bringing gas to
Barrow Island where three LNG trains will each produce 5 million tpy.
There will also be a 300-terajoule/day domestic gas plant
feeding into a pipeline to the mainland and a carbon dioxide
sequestration plant that can store in deep formations beneath the
island the high levels of CO2 from Gorgon fields (OGJ, July 20,
2009, p. 10).
Reports have been circulating for some weeks that Chevron expects to make a final investment decision soon. ✦

Fully informed markets?
The editorial “Politics and fuel choice”
hit a point with me as you noted, “Energy
choices are best left to free markets, fully
informed” (OGJ, Aug. 10, 2009, p. 18).
Here our industry and society must come
to grips with the definition of the “market” and what constitutes the concept of
“fully informed.”
The free market is not only those who
directly participate with their own dollars but all of society, as everyone must
consume energy. If we ignore or neglect
this Man-on-the-Street, we do so at our
own peril because it is this segment of
the market that will dictate energy policy
and all of its ramifications.
The real crux of the matter is who
to get that market to be fully informed.
Is having an informed, energy-literate
consumer base even worthwhile? If that
answer is yes, then the next question is,
whose job is it to teach the public (market) about the role energy plays in their
daily lives?
It is all well and good to see this
statement in print once again. But what
are we, the energy industry, going to do
about it? We can all point to the literally
hundreds of programs that foist themselves off as energy education. Indeed,
our industry is the deep pockets funding
a great deal of these efforts. In addition, the various trade associations that
represent all forms of energy also put
out some very good yet appropriately
focused material about their specific btu.
These programs are a great effort toward
this goal. However, I do not think that
any can say that “fully informed” has
been achieved. Shouldn’t we expect a
real positive return for this investment in
energy education?
There is no real coordinated effort
at informing the public about just plain
btus. We do a great job on our particular
form of btus, but where is the fundamental information about energy? Society is missing the prerequisite course
in Energy Literacy 101 that they need to
have to fully appreciate Oil & Gas 212,
Coal 240, Wind and Solar 310, Nuclear
431, or even Energy Policy 550.
Talk is cheap. Isn’t now the time to
walk the walk and take it upon ourselves
to develop a truly “fully informed free
market?” It is either that or let’s admit
that society will always need our product
and we will be able to pass along any
cost that we may incur so that energy
choices and their prices really do not
matter after all.

Suspicion and speculation
Evidence grows in support of the longstanding suspicion by many oil and gas operators that
trading of financial instruments related to crude
oil, oil products, and natural gas unduly influences
prices of those commodities. In the shorthand of
the day, speculation increases price volatility. In the
politics of the day, speculators are demonic.
Speculators—or noncommercial traders, who
seek trading profits with no intention of taking
possession of what they trade—are in fact essential to market fluidity. Among other things, they
assume price risks unwanted by buyers and sellers
of physical commodities.
But a recent increase in speculative activity
coincides with a decrease in regulation and a
surge in oil and gas prices unexplained by events
in physical markets. Hence the boiling suspicion,
from which grows political efforts to tighten
market regulation. The issue is important beyond
financial dimensions of the oil and gas business.
It carries a political charge capable of affecting
operations.

Tracing relationships
A new study from the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University traces relationships between the activity of noncommercial
traders, the value of the US dollar, and oil prices.
It shows that, since relaxation in the regulation of
speculative trading in oil and gas derivatives, the
share of market activity represented by noncommercial trading has grown. Movements in oil
prices, meanwhile, have coincided with changes
in the dollar’s value to an extent previously not
evident. The speculation and dollar-value phenomena, argue study authors Kenneth B. Medlock III
and Amy Myers Jaffe, are related.
“As the market presence of noncommercial
traders increased between 2003 and early 2008,
the stance of these noncommercial traders has
fairly consistently been to hold bullish, long positions that supported rising prices,” Medlock and
Jaffe write. “And, when their market share was
highest, so was their net long position, which
again roughly coincided (acting as a slight leading
indicator) with the peak in oil prices at $147/bbl
in the middle of 2008.”
The increase in noncommercial activity and its
20

orientation toward price strength occurred after
enactment of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act (CFMA) late in 2000. The law exempted
oil and gas financial instruments traded outside
formal exchanges from regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).
“While correlation does not imply causation, the trends evident in open-interest data are
impossible to ignore,” the study authors say. “It is
striking that only after the CFMA was enacted did
the composition of players in the market significantly change and oil prices rise to unprecedented
highs.” CFTC officials have testified to an absence
of evidence that speculation boosted commodity
prices. Medlock and Jaffe say the commission’s
analytical methods don’t account for changes in
market composition.
Since January 2001, the authors note, oil prices
have been strongly correlated with the dollar’s value,
rising when the dollar value falls and vice versa.
The correlation was negligible during 1986-2000.
Medlock and Jaffe warn that “the dollar risks getting
caught in a vicious cycle where continually rising oil
prices feed the US trade deficit, leading to increased
US indebtedness and thereby an even weaker dollar,
which further drives oil prices higher.”
The authors call for a review of market structures and regulations as well as of the role of
government intervention—via purchase and sale
of oil to and from strategic storage—in “extreme
circumstances.” Some of that review is under way
in Congress and the CFTC.

Government’s role
To much of the oil and gas industry, an increased role of government in markets is anathema. Properly so. But the market can’t be said to
work well when prices appear to have disengaged
from physical supply and demand.
Those fundamentals couldn’t explain the zoom
in oil prices to extremely high levels in mid-2008,
when speculative activity, according to the Baker
Institute study, peaked. The price surge inflamed
a political assault that remains a threat to oil and
gas operations. To the extent it resulted from unbridled speculation, the industry should support
whatever regulation may be needed to prevent a
recurrence—though not a paragraph more. ✦

INTERNATIONAL
PETROLEUM
AGREEMENTS—1

T E R E S T
International petroleum agreements
(IPAs) have structures that are wellestablished yet strongly influenced by
changes in political relationships and
markets. The large swings of oil prices
in recent years and the related pressures
on existing agreements call attention to
the need for IPAs to be flexible if not
fundamentally changed (OGJ, Aug. 24,
2009, p. 20).
Modern IPAs are
generally either production-sharing contracts or
modernized concession
agreements—with more
host-country (HC) control over petroleum operations and state participation—although risk service contracts
also exist on a more limited scale. Those
structures have evolved both to accommodate the political ambitions of HC
governments and to adapt to gyrations
in the price of oil.
In years of oil scarcity and high
prices (particularly in 1979 and 1980),
international oil companies (IOCs)
competed fiercely among themselves
and were forced to accept very harsh
terms, even on marginally attractive
prospects.
With the advent of low prices in
the 1980s and 1990s and the perception of increased political risk in
many developing countries, the respective bargaining power of HCs and
IOCs shifted. Many IOCs redirected
their new investments to exploration
ventures in the US and Canada or
in other politically stable areas, and
many HCs renegotiated their earlier
agreements at the request of IOCs,
leading to less stringent contractual
terms in order to encourage exploration and production (E&P) invest-

ments in a low-price environment.
A clearly opposite trend was observed in the 2003-July 2008 period as
a result of increasing oil prices.
This review of the evolution of IPAs
shows how changes in IPAs have followed closely the political evolution of
relationships between countries, especially relationships between the industrialized world and developing countries. Still, economic considerations,
especially the increasing volatility of oil
prices, are obviously important to the
particular fiscal terms imposed on, or
offered by, investors over time.

Early concessions
At the beginning of the petroleum
industry in the US in 1857, dealmaking parties adopted the traditional
concession agreement, derived from
contracts used in the mining industry.
The lease issued on Dec. 30, 1857, to
Col. Edwin L. Drake on the tract of land
in Titusville, Pa., where oil was first
discovered in 1859 follows the pattern
(see box).
Brief as it is, the Drake lease contains core elements that exist in basic
petroleum concession agreements today,
namely:
• The award by the lessor to the lessee (or “licensee” or “concessionaire”)
of exclusive exploration and production
rights in a specific area for a given term
with a possible time extension (although Drake’s rights also covered coal
and other minerals, which is not common in modern petroleum contracts).
• Payment of a royalty (called a
“rental” in the Drake lease) corresponding to a fractional share of the production (one-eighth or 12.5% was traditional at that time for mining activity),
payable in cash or in kind to the lessor.
• The obligation of the lessee to
carry out the operations as soon as
practicable, without undue delay, or
otherwise the lease could be terminated.
Legal instruments used for petroleum exploration and exploitation have
undergone far-reaching changes since

variety of agreements now exists, IPAs
can still be reduced to a few different
types of legal documents and contractual arrangements used throughout
the world today. There is, however, one
paramount difference: The modern concession agreement (like other international agreements) is now usually 100
pages long, not a mere paragraph as in
the 1857 contract.

Proﬁt-sharing principle
In 1948, Venezuela took the lead in
instituting the 50-50 profit-sharing
principle, which is the idea that the
IOCs and the HC should share equally
in the profits from oil development in
the host country.
Saudi Arabia followed suit in 1950
and negotiated an agreement with
Aramco which was signed on Dec. 31
of that year. For the first time in the
Middle East, an income tax on petroleum revenues was instituted and
the principle of 50-50 profit-sharing
established. The royalty hitherto paid by
Aramco continued to be paid and was
credited against a 50% income tax as an
advance payment for the tax. As a result
of that arrangement, Saudi Arabia nearly
quadrupled its petroleum revenues.
Because other Middle East producers
were in a similar situation, the new system rapidly spread to other countries.
However, the IOCs retained complete
control over both the conduct of operations and the pricing of petroleum; in
particular, the control of production
schedules remained their exclusive
prerogative.
The respective positions and relative
strength of HCs and IOCs nevertheless underwent a steady and gradual
change. As early as 1952, the 50-50
profit-sharing principle was applied in
most countries, except in Iran. There,
the more radical approach of nationalizing the oil industry was taken in 1951
by the Mossadegh government. At that
time, however, the dominance of the oil
market by the major IOCs was such that
they succeeded in imposing an embargo on Iranian oil.
This eventually led to the downfall of

Mossadegh and the reinstatement of the
shah. Nationalization of the oil industry was nevertheless preserved, and the
Anglo-Iranian concession was replaced
by an agreement between the National
Iranian Oil Co. (NIOC) and an international consortium dominated by US
companies that became major players
in Iran for the first time, along with the
Cie. Francaise des Petroles (CFP), now
called Total.

Evolving relationships
The events in Iran accelerated the
evolution of the relationship between
HCs and IOCs. On Aug. 24, 1957, NIOC
entered into a joint venture with AGIP,
the Italian national oil company. AGIP
sought new forms of joint venture
agreements with HCs in an effort to
challenge the dominance of the seven
sisters, as the seven largest IOCs were
collectively named, contending that
AGIP had been excluded from their
marketing systems.
Thus, somewhat ironically, it was the
arrangement between the national oil
company of a western nation and the
national oil company of a developing
HC that led to the advent of “association” (the so-called state participation)
between IOCs and HCs. The AGIP/NIOC

agreement led for the first time to a
75% HC-25% IOC profit-sharing split
through two mechanisms: first, a 50%50% participation in the venture to take
effect upon declaration of a commercial
discovery and, second, imposition on
net income of the 50-50 profit-sharing
principle.
The AGIP contract was followed in
1958 by similar agreements made by
NIOC with Pan American and Sapphire.
Similar state participation schemes were
introduced by AGIP in Tunisia in 1960
and in Egypt in 1961. The introduction
of HC participation in most Middle East
countries took place later in the 1970s.

Risk service agreements
The risk service agreement differs
significantly from the traditional concession. Under this type of agreement,
the IOC is no longer a concessionaire
but a contractor of the HC, performing at its own risk exploration and, in
the event of commercial discovery, the
development and production of oil and
gas.
Risk service contracts were first used
in Latin America, where concession
arrangements became unacceptable to
several countries that had created their
own NOCs and granted them a monop-

OPEC’s role
An event of utmost importance
occurred in 1960 with the establishment of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries. OPEC was created in Baghdad in September 1960 by
the major oil-exporting countries of
Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, and
Kuwait. Current membership includes
those countries and Algeria, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates,
Angola, and Ecuador.
The original objective of OPEC was
to prevent the continuing drop in crude
oil prices which had resulted from
the discovery of huge reserves by new
entrants lacking marketing systems.
The OPEC founders sought to forestall
a reduction in their income. However,
events led OPEC to enlarge its role. The
individual countries in OPEC, with the
support of their organization, began
challenging IOCs on such matters as
ownership rights, pricing of oil, production levels, and types of agreements.
An example of the challenge was the
Declaration of Sovereigns and Chiefs
of State of OPEC countries in Algiers
on Mar. 6, 1975: “The sovereigns and
heads of states reaffirm the solidarity which unites their countries in
safeguarding the legitimate rights and
interests of their people; reasserting the
sovereign and inalienable right of their
countries to the ownership, exploitation, and pricing of their national
resources; and rejecting any idea or
thought that challenges these fundamental rights and, thereby, the sovereignty of their countries.”
During the 1970s, OPEC’s leverage
strengthened as its combined production went from 9 million b/d in 1961
to 30 million b/d in 1973. As a result,
OPEC enjoyed a near monopoly on
the external supply of crude oil to the
industrialized world.
The remaining traditional concession
agreements were to undergo important
changes after Sept. 1, 1969, in the wake
of the coup d’etat by Col. Moammar
Qaddafi of Libya. Libya demanded a
substantial increase in the posted price
of petroleum.1

The major IOCs recognized the
leapfrog implications of Libya’s demand
and its effect on their production in the
Persian Gulf area. After Shell’s Libyan
production of 150,000 b/d was shut in
when the company refused to accede to
Libyan demands, Occidental Petroleum,
an independent oil company almost entirely dependent on Libyan production,
entered into a settlement with Libya.
Other independents like Marathon, Amerada Hess, and Continental followed
suit. Libya then turned to the large
IOCs with an ultimatum: Settle within a
week, or be nationalized. Like wildfire,
other HCs copied Libya’s demands.
In February 1971, Iran sought the
same terms Libya had obtained from
Occidental. After seeking assistance from
the US State Department, Texaco and
Standard Oil of California agreed to Tehran’s terms.2 Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani,
the Saudi Arabian minister of petroleum
and minerals, noted the shift in bargaining power brought about by the Tehran
agreement of 1971, which resulted in a
substantial increase in the government
take.3 This agreement raised posted prices
used for tax assessment and generally
established a 55% tax rate on profits
as well as an expensed-royalty scheme
(in lieu of the previous credited-royalty
scheme against profit tax).
The 50-50 principle was a relic of
the past in the major Middle Eastern
oil-exporting countries. In the future,
HCs would receive a majority share of
the profits from production.
Next week: How the 1973 embargo
and later political and economic developments changed international petroleum agreements.

Study lists House clean air bill’s possible reﬁning impacts
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
US refining investments could
plunge because of soaring business
costs if clear air legislation that the US
House passed in June becomes law, a
study commissioned by the American
Petroleum Institute concluded.
Production at US refineries also
could drop as product output rises in
countries without similar greenhouse
gas limits, effectively making any GHG
reductions minor, API said on Aug. 24 as
it released the analysis by EnSys Energy,
an independent consulting firm based
in Lexington, Mass.
“This study clearly shows the devastating impact this legislation could have
on US jobs and US energy security,”
said API Pres. Jack N. Gerard. “Climate
legislation should not come at the
expense of US economic and energy
security. Congress needs to analyze carefully the impact of any climate policy
on ordinary Americans, American jobs,
and American companies,” Gerard said.
A deep US refining decline would
create ripples throughout the general

economy, affecting jobs beyond the oil
and gas industry, Gerard said, adding,
“Steelworkers, construction workers,
even the shopkeepers, school teachers,
and waitresses working in communities
where refineries operate would feel the
pinch.”

Allowance distributions
API and other oil and gas groups
have criticized HR 2454, which the
House passed June 26 by a 219-212
vote, because of the free emissions allowances it would distribute to various
industries as part of its carbon cap-andtrade program.
Refiners would receive 2.25% of the
allowances but be held responsible for
44% of total emissions, including those
from their oil-processing operations
(about 4%) as well as consumer emissions from planes, trains, automobiles,
heating oil, and other oil product uses,
API said. In contrast, some other industries and businesses would receive free
allowances that match or exceed their
carbon reduction obligations, it noted.
EnSys warned in the study that HR

2454, if it were to become law, could
by 2030 cut US refining throughput by
as much as 4.4 million b/d to 12.2 million b/d, with California and Gulf Coast
refineries hit particularly hard. Refining
throughput in the rest of the world,
meanwhile, could grow by as much as
3.3 million b/d, it said.
US refining investments could drop
by $89.7 billion, or 88%, to $12.2 billion by 2030, while projected utilization rates could plunge from 83.3% to
as low as 63.4%, the study continued.
Increased costs from complying with
the new regulations would make US
refineries less competitive with product
suppliers in countries without similar
carbon limits and increase US reliance
on imported products, it indicated.
For its base-case, the EnSys study
used the US Energy Information
Administration’s latest reference-case
projection of future energy liquids
supply and demand without climate
legislation. It also used HR 2454’s basic
case allowance costs and other market
impacts, and the bill’s no international/
limited case allowance costs and other
market impacts. ✦

NGSA, AGA react to FERC’s pipeline ﬂow data proposals
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The Natural Gas Supply Association
and American Gas Association responded differently to proposed new federal
requirements requiring the daily posting of the scheduled flow of natural gas
on pipelines.
NGSA said in comments filed
with the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Aug. 31 that the
requirements will provide market
participants with enhanced insight
into supply and demand fundamentals
26

influencing price formation.
“FERC has taken a constructive
approach that enhances transparency
without distorting competition or efficiency in the market,” said David Murphy, NGSA’s analyst for energy markets
and government affairs. “With implementation of requirements on posting
pipeline flow data, the commission
will achieve the final step in facilitating
transparency in the physical natural gas
market.”
In separate comments, AGA expressed concern that the proposed posting requirements could not only fail to

accomplish FERC’s transparency goals,
but would potentially yield confusing,
and false or misleading market information if applied to the local distribution companies which make up AGA’s
membership.
“The ability of an LDC to deliver gas
at any point on its system downstream
of its city-gates is a function almost exclusively of the actual consumption by
end-use customers behind that point.
Thus, the amount of capacity that may
be ‘available’ for an LDC to receive or
deliver at any given point on its system
beyond its city gates is driven by endOil & Gas Journal / Sept. 7, 2009

leases upheld

‘False or misleading’
AGA maintained, “Therefore, the
commission’s mathematical equation of
‘posted capacity minus scheduled volumes equals available capacity’ underlying the proposed rules does not hold
true for LDCs and can often yield false
or misleading market information when
applied to LDCs.” It recommended that
FERC exempt LDCs from the posting
requirement as originally proposed.
NGSA noted that the new flow
posting requirements were imposed
in FERC Order No. 720 as part of the
commission’s efforts to further expand
information about physical market
transactions and fundamentals. The flow
data complements the annual transaction data collected in FERC’s new Form
552 earlier this year and extensive market data already available on the commission’s web site, NGSA said.
In its filing, NGSA also asked FERC to
consider adopting a standard conversion factor of 1,000 British thermal
units per standard cubic foot for the
threshold determination of whether a
point must post, increase the de minimis flow threshold on certain pipelines
to 12,000 MMbtu/day in recognition
of divergence between actual flow and
design flow capacity, and confirm that
the posting obligation is for aggregated
flow information and consider adopting
an exemption procedure to protect confidentiality concerns in locations with a
single market participant.
Overall, NGSA praised FERC’s decision to require the posting of scheduled pipeline flow data. “In addition to
providing the market with important
information regarding underlying
supply and demand fundamentals, the
availability of pipeline flow information
will have the added benefit of spurring
new innovative services resulting in
more efficient pipeline grid utilization
and infrastructure development decisions,” it said in its filing.

A

federal appeals court upheld a
lower court’s decision that the
US Minerals Management Service did
not need to prepare a supplemental environmental impact statement
before conducting a 2007 lease sale
in the Beaufort Sea off Alaska.
A three-judge panel in The 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously
said on Aug. 27 that MMS satisfied its
duties under the National Environmental Protection Act.
It said that MMS took the requisite
“hard look” at new information concerning the impact of rising oil prices
on OCS Lease Sale 202 before issuing
a finding of no new significance.
The North Slope Borough and the
Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission
said in their lawsuit that MMS did not
adequately consider seismic and other
impacts on whales and other wildlife.
“The agency did not act arbitrarily
or capriciously in determining no
supplemental environmental impact
statement was required to address
new information about the impact
of seismic activity on Inupiat subsistence activities,” the appeals court
said in a memorandum.

‘Adequately analyzed’
“The impact of this new information, and the effectiveness of the existing and new proposed mitigation
measures, were adequately analyzed
in the 2006 Final Programmatic Environmental Assessment, which was
incorporated by reference into the
2006 Environmental Assessment for
Lease Sale 202,” it continued.
Alaska Gov. Sean Parnell welcomed
the news. The decision means that
Shell Alaska can continue with its
plans to explore and develop its Beau-

fort Sea leases, he said on Aug. 28.
“Outer Continental Shelf development is critical to the state’s longterm economic future. The OCS offers
the greatest opportunity for new oil
discoveries in the Arctic, and barriers
against exploration and development
there continue to fall,” Parnell said.
US Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alas.)
said the ruling was good news not
just for the state, but also for US
energy security. “That the 9th Circuit
rejected all of the claims brought is
not surprising,” she said. “I’ve always
felt that the MMS met the ‘hard look’
standard in their environmental assessment of the 2007 lease sale.”

Sees other delays
Murkowski added that she remains
concerned about continued delays
in exploring more of the OCS off
Alaska, however.
The Alaska Wilderness League, meanwhile, noted that US Interior Secretary
Ken Salazar will face several Alaska OCS
decisions during September.
It said that a 30-day comment
period on Shell’s Beaufort Sea exploratory plan will end on Sept. 6, and
MMS will decide whether additional
environmental reviews are needed
“in the same area where thousands
of endangered bowhead whales were
seen in a 2007 survey by Shell.”
The extended public comment period ends on Sept. 21 for a proposed
new offshore leasing program for
Alaska that MMS is developing, the
group continued. And on Sept. 26,
it said, Salazar is due to give his first
report to the federal appeals court,
which vacated the Alaska portion
of MMS’s current 5-year OCS plan
earlier this year. ✦

Other AGA points
In addition to urging FERC to exempt LDCs from the posting obligation
as originally proposed, AGA also recommended that those LDCs that the commission might require to comply with
the proposed regulations be required
to post scheduled volumes only at their
city gates.
“No wholesale price formation occurs downstream of an LDC’s city gates.
Price index publishers provide city gate
index prices but do not report prices

T E R E S T
at any points downstream of an LDC’s
city-gates because there is no wholesale
trading of gas downstream of an LDC’s
city-gates. Information regarding volumes delivered on LDC systems beyond
an LDC’s city gate would not meaningfully contribute to the understanding
of supply and demand fundamentals
that affect wholesale natural gas price
formation,” it said.
AGA also recommended that FERC
clarify that the threshold for report-

ing of a nonphysical point is reached
when the point has a maximum volume
scheduled to it equal to or greater than
15,000 MMbtu/day on any day within
the three preceding calendar years.
It also urged the commission to
permit LDCs to treat the noncontiguous portions of their systems on a
facility-by-facility basis for purposes
of determining whether they meet the
threshold requirement for posting and
whether they qualify for the end-use
delivery company exemption. ✦

way from having enough votes to pass
what he considers the largest tax increase in US history. “With the climatechange debate on Capitol Hill, it’s safe
to report that bipartisanship is nowhere

“Cap-and-trade has pitted Democrat against Democrat or, put another
way, it centers on those in the party
supporting the largest tax increase in
American history against those in the
party who oppose it,” Inhofe continued. “As to just who will win this
intraparty squabble, I put money down

learned anything from Scotland’s
decision to release Abdelbasset Ali
al-Megrahi, the Libyan convicted of
the 1998 Pan Am airline bombing, it
should have learned the meaning of
the word “scapegoat.”
That view clearly emerged when
US Sen. Joe Lieberman urged an independent investigation of Scotland’s
decision to free the convicted Lockerbie bomber, expressing concern that
British interest in Libyan oil may have
played a role.
In urging the investigation, Lieberman pointed to “shocking” suggestions by Libyan leader Mu’ammar
al-Qadhafi, his son Saif, and the head
of the British Libyan Business Council
that the release was mixed with Britain’s interest in exploring oil in Libya.
“I don’t want to believe that they
are true, but they are hanging so
heavily in the air that I hope that

but it is a different legal system. It is
a Scottish legal system and therefore
we have to follow the tenets of Scottish justice,” Scottish First Minister
Alex Salmond told Sky News.
But adding fuel to the outrage was
a claim by Seif al-Islam, al-Qadhafi ’s
son, that the issue of Megrahi’s fate
“was always on the negotiating table”
in talks with Britain over Libya’s huge
reserves of oil and gas.
Sen. Ben Cardin, a Democrat, said
Lieberman’s questioning of Scottish
motives in releasing Megrahi “raises
a very valid point.”

Compromise over oil?

“I think we need to know what
this oil deal was all about and whether there was a compromise to the
judicial system for commercial gain,”
he said on the same CNN program.
Both Lieberman and Cardin said

Putin touts Russia’s oil
reserves; seeks funding
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Russia’s Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin, on a visit to the town of Igarka
in Krasnoyarsk Territory, boasted that
the region will eventually provide more
than 115 million tons/year of “additional oil and condensate” on reaching
its estimated capacity.
“We ourselves find it hard to imagine the riches that fill our country,”
said Putin at the launch of the Vankor
oil field, adding that “It is possible
and necessary to develop the resources that we have for hundreds of
years.”
He said on national television that
Vankor is “the first, and therefore a
highly significant step in implementation of the large-scale, strategic project for the integrated development of
hydrocarbon deposits in the north of
Krasnoyarsk Territory and the YamalNenets Autonomous Area.”
“In the coming years, a whole new
Russian oil and gas region should
appear here. Hundreds of kilometers
of gas and oil pipelines will be laid,”
Putin said. “Roads and power stations
will be built, literally from scratch.
Dozens of fields will be developed,” he
said.
“According to specialists’ calculations, this region will provide over
115 million tons of additional oil
and condensate each year when it
reaches its estimated capacity,” Putin
said. “Of course, this will significantly
strengthen the raw material base of
the Russian economy and our export
potential.”
Production in the oil and gas region
should reach full capacity in around 10
years, said Putin, who also spoke about
measures planned to improve infrastructure in the region.
“The government has taken a decision about integrated development

of this, essentially new, oil and gas
region,” said Putin, who proposed a
partnership between the government
and private oil companies.
“In our view, this approach will
make it possible to consolidate the
efforts of the state and resource-extracting companies and to significantly
reduce costs,” he said.
Putin said such a partnership would
also “create a common transport
network, energy supply system and
social provisions much more effectively, quickly and—the most important
thing—cheaply, than if each company
built such infrastructure individually,
just for itself.”
Public-private partnerships should
be used in the development process,
said Putin, who said that “top-notch
development of infrastructure needs to

be ensured for the development of these
new fields.”
Putin said, “We are talking about
the construction and modernization of
roads, pipelines, and power stations. It
would be expedient to widely use the
possibilities of state-private partnerships
for this.”
Putin, who said that infrastructure
bonds should be issued to help finance
the projects, also suggested that a zero
rate of tax on the extraction of subsoil
resources could be extended to oil deposits in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous
Area.
“A subsidized, ‘zero’ rate of the subsoil resources extraction tax is already in
effect for a whole series of oil deposits,”
he said, adding that “this norm should
be extended to the whole territory of

the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Area.”
Putin also urged the swift introduction of a zero rate of customs duty on
oil exported from eastern Siberia.
“A fundamental decision has been
taken regarding a ‘zero’ customs duty
on the export of oil extracted from certain oil deposits in eastern Siberia,” he
said, adding, “Vankor is on this list.”
At the launch, Putin said that fields
in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Area
and the north of Krasnoyarsk Territory contain 67% of Russia’s natural
gas, 15% of its oil, and 60% of its gas
condensate.
“What’s more, geological exploration work here is far from complete and
it promises new discoveries,” he said,
adding, “The degree of resource exploration is 20% for oil, 35% for gas, and
just 17% for condensate.” ✦

StatoilHydro shutting down Hammerfest LNG for 3 months
StatoilHydro’s Hammerfest LNG
plant on Melkoya Island in northern
Norway will be shut down on Aug.
15 for upgrading and maintenance
for as long as 3 months, the company
announced. Since the plant’s 2007
start-up, upgrading and replacement
of equipment have been carried out to
increase the plant’s production.
From February, said the company, the
plant has produced at about full nominal capacity of 4.1 million tonnes/year.
“To secure this level, the plant has to be
made more robust,” the announcement
said.
A major operation will be replacing 15 heat exchangers, which form
the core of the process that liquefies
Snohvit development gas. During the
shutdown and before the mechanical
work can begin, all gas must be removed from the plant. Some flaring will
therefore take place during the first day
of the stoppage.
Hammerfest LNG will resume production in November, said the company.
Although the company claims official
start-up in second-half 2007 and the
plant did send out its first cargo in late
October (OGJ Online, Oct. 25, 2007),
the plant was plagued by outages for
the remainder of the year and into
2008 (OGJ Online, Feb. 25, 2008).

The development
Snohvit, which encompasses the
subsea field development as well as the
Hammerfest LNG plant, is the first offshore development in the Barents Sea.
It has no surface field installations and
brings natural gas to Melkoya Island for
liquefaction and export. Hammerfest is
the first plant of its kind in Europe, the
world’s northernmost LNG plant, and
the only one inside the Arctic Circle.
Subsea production facilities in the
Barents Sea stand on the seabed, in
water depths of 250-345 m, according to company information. From the

Snohvit, Askeladd, and Albatross fields,
20 wells are to produce gas to be transported through a 143-km pipeline.
For Snohvit, 9 wells are planned,
including 8 for production and 1 for
reinjecting carbon dioxide. During
2004-05, 6 of the producers and the
CO2 injector were drilled, with the
remaining two to follow in 2011.
Production wells on Albatross were
drilled in 2005-06, according to the
company. Snohvit and Albatross wells
came on stream in 2007. The Askeladd part of the development is due on
stream in 2014-15. ✦

formations. Shale thickness ranges from
1,000 ft to 3,500 ft. The extremely
complex reservoir is mostly a shale but
with bits of most every other facies,
Marquez said (see map, OGJ, Jan. 9,
1984, p. 75).
Venoco is “working toward completion techniques that can replicate the
productive capacity” the company sees
in the naturally fractured Monterey
shale offshore and believes the shale
holds oil that is lighter in gravity than
typical California heavy oil.
Venoco has been producing from
Monterey shale offshore for more than
a decade in South Ellwood and Sockeye fields in the Santa Barbara Channel.
South Ellwood’s production is entirely

from Monterey, and Sockeye produces
from Monterey and conventional formations.
Venoco is anxious to frac the
Monterey at Sockeye, but no mobile frac
equipment is available off California,
Marquez said. The company hopes to
access purpose-built frac equipment or
bring it in from Alaska’s Cook Inlet by
late 2009 or in 2010.
Marquez said the former ARCO Oil &
Gas Co. discovered Monterey’s potential
as a reservoir and not just a world class
source rock when a well on South Ellwood’s Platform Holly developed a hole
in the casing and flowed 1,500 b/d of
oil. ✦

Seismic-while-drilling technology advance hailed
Technology International Inc. of
Kingwood, Tex., has developed a breakthrough borehole imaging system that
is nearly commercial, according to the
US Department of Energy, which is
sponsoring the project.
By pushing the limits of seismicwhile-drilling technology, the patentpending SeismicPulser system provides
more accurate geosteering for oil and
gas discoveries, facilitating field development and improving well economics,
DOE’s Fossil Energy Office (FEO) said.
It said drillbit SWD technology uses
a downhole acoustic source and receivers at the surface to create real-time images that allow operators to “see” ahead
of the drillbit. The SeismicPulser system
was developed to withstand high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) environments in deep onshore and offshore
deepwater wells that require special
imaging technologies, DOE said.
DOE said no drillbit SWD system
available currently has the new system’s
full capabilities. It said the system,
which is built into or attached to the
drillstring, emits broadband low-frequency sounds that, based on seismic
calculations, can be transmitted to
surface receivers from depths beyond
30,000 ft.

Project managers have indicated that
SeismicPulser is the only system that
meets the requirements of those companies planning to drill HPHT wells to
as deep as 35,000 ft in ultradeep water,
according to DOE.
It said SeismicPulser provides accurate drillbit location relative to
predrilling reservoir models and gives
the operator real-time images roughly
1,000 ft ahead of the drillbit, all without interfering with normal drilling
operations.
The system costs less than conventional vertical seismic profiling systems
and increases safety and cost savings by
detecting unexpected increased pore
pressure ahead of the bit, DOE said. It
also provides new operational capabilities by allowing operators to visualize
and steer towards more optimal targets
when drilling deep formations, it
added.
DOE said funding for the project
came from FEO’s oil and gas program.
Field testing was performed at the
University of Texas’s Devine seismic
test site and DOE’s Rocky Mountain
Oilfield Testing Center near Casper,
Wyo. The project was managed by the
FEO’s National Energy Technology
Laboratory. ✦

Indonesia’s CBM resource is estimated at 453 tcf in place, of which 183 tcf
is attributed to the South Sumatra basin.
An estimate earlier this decade put
the resource at 337 tcf (OGJ, Oct. 22,
2001, p. 40). OGJ estimated Indonesia’s
proved gas reserves at 106 tcf (see table,

of 2009. The company said the wells
will target three shallow gas and deeper
oil reservoirs at 2,000-7,000 ft.
“Several older wells flowed gas to

Drastic improvements needed in shale gas
Efficiency improvements of at least
an order of magnitude are needed in US
shale gas plays because field costs will
not stay at the levels to which they have
dropped since late 2008, said a speaker
Aug. 26 at the Summer NAPE E&P Forum in Houston.
Now that the industry has mastered
combination of horizontal drilling and
multiple frac stages, the rate of technology growth seems to be slowing, said
William Coates, president, Schlumberger Oilfield Services, North America.
Taking more measurements in each well
may be the key.
Drilling and completion capital costs
are not going to stay low, and field service costs may begin to increase within
a few months, said Coates.
The proliferation of frac jobs to as
many as several dozen per well is inefficient, and most operators don’t take
enough measurements in the vertical or
horizontal portions of shale gas wells
once they have completed their initial
reservoir characterization drilling, he

said. The move from science mode to
gas manufacturing is too abrupt.
Companies should set a goal of
obtaining the same ultimate recovery by
“doing less,” Coates urged. They must
find ways to cut the drilling time of a
typical shale well to 7 days from 28, for
example, by attaining the capability for
a single bit run for the vertical part of
the hole and one bit run for the curve
and lateral.
Landing the lateral at the depth of
the sweet spot at any given well location
could result in twice to three times the
ultimate recovery if an operator spent
an extra $100,000 on measurements,
Coates estimated.
Other steps toward efficiency could
come in the use of friction reducers
and biocides to halve the amount of
water required for fracs, laying fiber
optic cable outside casing to measure
vibration to learn which frac stages
are producing, and learning how to
conduct fewer inefficient fracs by using
log-while-drilling measurements to
select perforated intervals. ✦

The MMS requires offshore oil and

Companies in the gulf in 2008 held
about $1.2 billion in bonds. Supplemental bonding ensures that operators
meet their decommissioning obligations and in 2008 accounted for the
largest bond type at $556 million,
followed by area-wide development at
$426 million.
Of the 120 operators that produced

Rate determination

In the surety industry, rates generally range from 1 to 2.5%/year of the covered loss.9 In the
offshore surety industry, rates typically range from 1 to 3%/year but may be as high as 5%.6
Offshore supplemental bonds often require collateral.
In the traditional insurance industry, insurers manage their risk by charging premiums or
deductibles. In the surety market, rates are typically low and used primarily to pay the cost of
doing business and deductibles are not an option.
As a result, sureties use increasing rates of collateral to decrease their risk. In some cases,
sureties may require bonds to be 100% collateralized, either through cash deposits or through
letters of credit. In this case, the surety serves not so much as an insurer, but as a banker or
middleman, holding on to property (either cash or an LOC) and using its reputation and collateral to ensure that the principal’s obligations will be met.
One way to obtain a rough estimate for the rate that a surety might charge a principal is to
take the interest rate a company typically would be asked to pay on a loan, subtract the LIBOR
rate, and take half of the remainder.
For example, if the LIBOR is 3%, and a company is charged 7% on its loans, then a surety
might charge 2% of the insured losses.3
The Surety & Fidelity Assoc. of America has published rate tables as guidelines for the
construction surety industry. These rates decrease from 2.5% for the ﬁrst $100,000 of a bond
to less than 1% for bonds over $5 million. These guidelines probably are too simplistic for
offshore supplemental bonding because of risks involved and the fact that the success of an
offshore oil company is linked closely with the geology and production potential of a lease site.

According to industry sources, about
one-third of the premiums sureties
collect are available for losses. The other
two-thirds are associated with taxes, reinsurance, overhead, and salaries.3 Thus,
a surety company that charges 2% on a
given sized liability has to collect about
150 annual premiums (on similarly
sized liabilities) to cover a single loss.

Mitigation
Oil and gas price increases allow
small and medium-sized companies to
generate more revenue and to qualify
more easily for noncollateralized or

they do not qualify for noncollateralized bonds, high commodity prices
may make it easier for them to produce

companies time to produce the cash

sureties the time to add capacity.
Regulators could also change the
requirements for supplemental bond
exemptions to make them either more
or less strict. They could do this by
changing the current ratio of value to
liabilities, changing the allowable debtto-equity ratio, or changing the total
required value of the company.
If MMS made these regulations
stricter so that fewer companies qualified for exemptions, this could have
a positive effect on the supplemental
bond industry, as it would force companies with less risk to obtain surety

bonds. These companies likely would be
charged lower rates than smaller, riskier
companies, but this would provide a
source of relatively low risk accounts
with which supplemental sureties could
pay for losses.
Tighter limits on exemptions also
would increase the number of companies needing supplemental coverage,
especially the number of companies
needing coverage near the limits of the
market.
Lowering the exemption standards so that more companies were
exempt from bonding would reduce
the increase in capacity that the surety
industry would need to build; however,
it would also increase the government’s
risk of being forced to decommission a
site at its own expense.

Prior leaseholders
Raising supplemental bond requirements damage the profitability of small
independents while reducing liabilities
to the previous owners of the lease.
Producers often sell leases down the
food chain, but they cannot entirely
pass all decommissioning liability to
a new owner. That is, MMS can hold a
former lease owner liable for platforms
it did not even place on the OCS if the
new lease owner goes bankrupt. Thus,
increases in supplemental bonding requirements will protect both MMS and
former leaseholders from having to pay
for decommissioning. ✦

Refinery demand for processing catalysts will continue to flatten over the remainder of 2009 and into 2010 as the
global recession winds out and energy
prices remain soft. Operators, however,
will continue to seek the greater efficiencies in energy use and productivity
that processing catalysts permit.
Requirements for cleaner fuels and
pressures from stiffer environmental regulations will
continue to support
catalyst use, even as
product prices and
demand sag over the
remaining months of

Inc., Cleveland, predicted overall catalyst
demand among chemical, petroleum
refining, and polymer companies would
rise at 6%/year to $16.3 billion in
2012. Volume demand would grow at
2%/year to 5.3 million tonnes.
For refining catalyst trade, Freedonia
forecast a growth of 5.9%/year through
2017. Demand would reach more than
$5.6 billion in 2012 and more than
$7.6 billion in 2017.
Catalyst demand in petroleum refining, said the report, would be “quite
strong due to healthy volume growth
in hydroprocessing catalysts and higher
refined product output” in Africa, the
Mideast, and Asia-Pacific. Global efforts
to reduce air pollution by lowering sulfur content in motor vehicle fuels will
“boost catalyst loadings,” as will the
ongoing shift toward heavier grades of
crude oil, and development of unconventional petroleum resources such as
Canada’s tar sands.
That was then, however—October
2008; this is now.

nificantly lowered chemical, polymer,
and refined-product volumes, which
then directly affected worldwide catalyst
demand. The drop in catalyst volumes depressed average prices as well,
although a drop in commodity and
platinum-group metal prices from their
2008 highs “helped ease the pain.”
Freedonia Group, said Zimmerman,
have lowered expectations for future
world economic growth that informed
the late 2008 report. Those expectations
have contributed to prospects for slower
growth in world oil consumption and
world refined-products production.
In general, Freedonia Group now
expects somewhat slower average annual global growth in refinery catalyst
demand through 2012 in most regions,
with the biggest difference occurring
in North America due to the size of its
market and reduced expectations of US
oil consumption.
The situation in the US reflects not
only slower forecast average annual
economic growth but also shifting fuel
efficiencies of the motor vehicle fleet,
changing motorists’ driving habits, and
the potentially greater impact of biofuels on the US motor fuel needs.
Reduced North American refinedproduct consumption will also affect
such other regions as the Middle East
and Asia-Pacific, said Zimmerman.
In both regions, countries have been
building surplus refining capacity, at
least some of which has been targeted
toward North America.
On the whole, refining catalyst volumes by 2012 will likely increase from
their 2007 base, although growth will
be quite slow. This pace in turn would
reduce value growth of the market as
well. Growth in value terms is harder to
project, he allowed, as averaging pricing
tends to be much more volatile.
From the perspective of refining
catalysts types, fluid catalytic cracking
and alkylation catalysts will be the most
severely affected by the slowdown in
North America. Demand growth for
hydroprocessing, reforming, and other
catalysts will also be slower than previously expected but not nearly to the

same degree.
Stricter environmental standards,
particularly for reduced sulfur content
in distillate fuels, will help support
hydroprocessing catalyst demand, he
said. This will occur in many regions of
the world, not just in North America,
which is why hydroprocessing catalysts
will fare much better than most other
refining catalysts.
Also supporting hydroprocessing catalyst demand will be efforts to
extend low-sulfur fuel requirements to
off-road vehicles and to ships operating
in the coastal waters of many countries.

Activity
The following recounts some major
activity among refining-catalyst suppliers and refinery operators since the last
OGJ review of catalyst suppliers (OGJ,
Oct. 1, 2007, p. 52).

Operations
In September 2008, Abu Dhabi Oil
Refining Co. (Takreer) selected UOP
LLC, a Honeywell company, to supply

technology and engineering services for
expansion at its Ruwais refinery. The refinery will produce propylene, unleaded
gasoline, naphtha, LPG, aviation turbine
fuel, kerosine, gas-oil, bunker fuel, and
other hydrocarbon derivatives (OGJ
Online, Oct. 10, 2008).
The refinery, to start up in 2014, will
use UOP technologies for production
of low-sulfur distillate and gasoline,
said UOP. Its Unicracking process with
its Distillate Unionfining process will
upgrade heavy feedstocks to produce
ultralow-sulfur diesel.
UOP’s Merox process will remove
sulfur from saturated LPG streams, and
its BenSat process will manage benzene
content in the gasoline pool.
The refinery will also include a hydrotreating unit that will use the UOP
Naphtha Hydrotreating process and
Distillate Unionfining unit to produce
low-sulfur kerosine. The unit is the largest kerosine-fed hydrotreating unit ever
licensed by UOP, said the announcement.
In addition, through a 2006 alliance
with Albemarle Corp., Baton Rouge,
UOP is providing catalysts for the new
Takreer units.
In June 2008, UOP joined with
Rentech Inc., Los Angeles, to offer technology for production of cleaner fuels,
specialty waxes, and chemicals.
The nonexclusive agreement between UOP and Rentech will provide refiners, petrochemicals, and
synthetic-fuel producers the ability
to convert synthesis gas to ultraclean
fuels, specialty waxes, and chemicals.
The plan aligns Rentech’s process to
convert synthesis gas from biomass and
fossil resources and hydrocarbons with
UOP’s hydrocracking and hydrotreating processes that process and upgrade
hydrocarbons to fuels and chemicals,
said the company.
In February 2008, Hunt Refining
Co. selected UOP to supply technology,
basic engineering services, and equipment as part of Hunt’s plan to double
its gasoline and diesel output for the
Southeastern US.
Hunt had installed two new units

UOP’s CCR Platforming process and its
Unicracking process. The units increase
crude throughput by more than 30% to
69,000 b/d and double production of
gasoline and diesel, according to a UOP
announcement.
Hunt also converted an existing UOP
Fixed-Bed Platforming process unit to a
UOP Par-Isom process unit to enable a
gasoline product to meet expected benzene regulations. The US Environmental
Protection Agency had mandated that
refineries adhere to 0.62%/year benzene content in gasoline by 2011.
Construction on the new units began
in 2008. They are scheduled to come on
line this year with the revamp scheduled for completion in 2010.
UOP said its CCR Platforming is a
continuous catalytic reforming process
used to produce high-octane gasoline from naphthenes and paraffins.
Unicracking technology upgrades

In December 2007, Newfoundland
& Labrador Refining Corp. selected UOP
to supply technology, basic engineering
services, and equipment for a new fuel
refinery to be built in the Placentia Bay
area of Newfoundland and Labrador
(OGJ, Apr. 7, 2008, p. 24).
Start-up of the complex is scheduled for 2011. The plant will process
300,000 b/d Middle Eastern crudes for
the production of transportation fuels
for North America and Europe. The
NLRC facility is the first new refinery
constructed in North America since
1984.
It will employ UOP technologies to
produce low-sulfur, high-quality clean
fuels, said the announcement. Technologies include UOP’s Unicracking
and Unionfining processes to remove
sulfur and upgrade distillate materials
for production of clean fuel. UOP’s CCR

In addition, Nebula enables production of ultralow-sulfur diesel with no
additional capital investment and can
enhance hydrotreating unit revamps to
reach higher throughputs or achieve
higher product quality standards. It has

since its introduction in 2001, said the

pore structure and optimized active
site distribution,” says the company.
The catalyst technology uses a matrix
composition.
In March, BASF Catalysts launched a
technology that, it said, enables refiners
to use their current gasoline-oriented
FCCUs to meet the increased global
demand for diesel fuel.
BASF’s HDXtra catalyst “helps
increase diesel yields by maximizing production” of the light-cycle oil
produced from the FCC unit. The LCO
can be blended or further upgraded
to augment the refiner’s production of
high-quality diesel fuel. This technology, combined with optimized operating
conditions, according to the company,
enables refiners to increase LCO yield
by up to a 10% volume increase, with
nearly half of the benefit attributable to
catalyst selectivity.
HDXtra combines high matrix activity with good coke selectivity, said the
company. The catalyst also uses moderate zeolite activity, which “better
controls the amount of LCOs cracking
into gasoline while also offering low Htransfer activity, which preserves more
hydrogen in LCOs for minimal cetane
penalty.”
In July 2008, Albemarle announced
development and production of a
new catalyst that can help improve the
performance of hydrodesulfurization
units by up to 35% over the then most
active catalysts in the hydroprocessing
marketplace.
The new product, Ketjenfine 770
hydrodesulfurization catalyst, would
enable ultralow-sulfur diesel refiners to
improve operating margins by increas-

ing catalyst cycle length, increasing
throughput, or running cheaper, lower
quality feedstocks, all without additional, new capital expenditure, according
to the company’s announcement.
In November 2007, UOP announced
it had expanded its slate of technologies
to help refiners produce clean gasoline
from heavier crude oil. UOP’s slurry

hydrocracking process is designed to
upgrade bitumen and heavy crudes to
lighter distillates. It is based on a technology originally developed by Natural Resources Canada and was further
developed and proven commercially
viable, said UOP, at the Petro-Canada
plant in Montreal over 15 years starting
in 1985. ✦

Background
REX is a three-part project, with
Phase I extending from the Greasewood-Meeker, Colo., area in the
Piceance basin to interconnections
with Wyoming Interstate Pipeline and
Colorado Interstate Gas at the Wamsutter hub in Sweetwater County, Wyo.,
and then eastward to the Cheyenne hub
in northeastern Colorado. Phase I was
completed in February 2007.
Phase II, called REX-West (shown
in red in Fig. 1), moved gas from the
Cheyenne hub to Panhandle Eastern
Pipeline, near Mexico, Mo. (Audrain
County), and also interconnected with
Northern Natural, Natural Gas Pipeline
Co. of America, and ANR Pipeline Co.
This segment of the project, completed
during the early months of 2008, provided a new, cheaper supply source to
markets in the Midwest.
Transportation cost and pricing
advantages of REX shippers vs. traditional suppliers in the Midcontinent
led Midwest buyers to take volumes
from REX and reject traditional supplies
from Midcontinent producing basins
and Canada. Regional prices responded,
changing gas prices and bases in several
regions, particularly the Midcontinent, where pricing points were under
downward pressure for much of 2008
and early 2009.
New REX supplies also displaced
traditional gas supplies in California
and Canada, resulting in much higherthan-average storage levels in both areas
during the initial months of the 2009
injection season.
These market developments were
transient, with REX-East shifting
volumes away from the four pipelines
feeding Midwest markets in July 2009.

The shift
Fig. 2 shows the nine Phase IIIa
(REX-East to Lebanon) interconnects on
the way to Lebanon. At Lebanon, REXEast connects to Dominion, Columbia
Gas (TCO), Vectren, Texas Eastern, Texas
Gas Transmission, and ANR. Within days
of reaching Lebanon, REX gas deliveries shifted away from the Midcontinent

Traditional sources of supply for these
pipelines were basins in the SoutheastUS gulf including offshore Gulf of
Mexico and the Barnett Shale.

Pricing implications
REX-East has had a number of market effects.
The shift in gas deliveries to Ohio
markets has put substantial downward
pressure on Ohio spot market basis
(regional price less the Henry Hub
benchmark). Dominion South Point
basis in July averaged only 15¢ more
than Henry Hub cash, which was 14¢
less than the injection season average
through the end of June, and 25¢ less
than the year-to-date average through
the end of June.
Similar declines occurred at the
other Ohio market locations, including
TETCO M2, where July basis was down
to +30¢ for the injection season to date

through June. Columbia Gas basis fell
to only +9¢ compared with +13¢ in
June, and +20¢ for the injection season
through the end of June.
The exact opposite has taken place
in the Midcontinent. As REX supply
has moved away from Midcontinent
pipelines and to Ohio delivery points,
space has become available on Panhandle, NGPL, ANR, and NNG to allow
more Midcontinent production to flow
north, lifting basis at all Midcontinent
locations.
Regional July basis was up an average of 50¢ compared with June and
64¢ compared with year-to-date levels
through the end of June. Similar adjustments have occurred in the forward
market where Panhandle basis for
August delivery has been steadily rising
and far exceeds basis levels seen for the
same contract month in both 2008 and
2007.
The shift in REX gas displacements to
the Southeast-US gulf from the Midcontinent also has pressured gulf prices and

basis. For example, as of early August
2009, Texas Gas Zone SL August basis
had dropped to –12¢ from only –6¢ for
the August 2008 contract at the same
time of the year. Trunkline August basis
slipped to –13¢ compared with –4¢
last year for the August 2008 contract.
Much of the pressure on outright prices
at the Henry Hub has resulted from
competition between Southeast-US gulf
supplies and new supplies from the
Rockies.

The future
REX-East into Lebanon is only a
preview of what can be expected when
the pipeline arrives at Clarington, Ohio,
a larger hub with more connectivity to
pipelines traditionally moving gas from
the Southeast-US gulf region into huge
Northeast demand centers. REX’s transportation cost structure will prompt
its shippers to continue to take their
gas as far east as possible, into markets
accessible at Clarington. Incremental
gas supply, however, will have difficulty

reaching downstream markets in the
Northeast during winter heating season
because of downstream pipeline capacity constraints.
The downward price pressure will
push Ohio prices low enough for both
REX shippers and Southeast-US gulf
suppliers to shift their volumes to markets in Michigan and Chicago, flattening
prices between the three markets (Ohio,
Michigan, and Chicago). This effect is
already occurring.
Much of the competitive pressure
will likely land on producers in the
various unconventional shale plays
located within or feeding the Southeast-US gulf region. While REX exerts
displacement pressure on long-haul
gulf pipelines, shale-gas producers will
try to send much more supply eastward
to the same markets. ✦

Tool offers clearer picture of formations
The new GEM elemental analysis tool
offers rapid and precise evaluation of formations with complex mineralogies.
As the newest addition to the company’s portfolio of formation evaluation
technologies, the GEM tool offers operators a complete elemental analysis solution
for complex reservoirs and complements
this firm’s existing cuttings evaluation
service performed while drilling. When
combined with real-time data acquisition
software, it offers customers on site and
remote visualization of formation elemental data quickly and accurately.
The tool improves the measurements of
magnesium in carbonates and aluminum
in clays and shale. It measures manganese,
a common constituent of carbonates and
sheet silicates. Use of these three additional elements—magnesium, aluminum,
and manganese—to determine mineralogy
is designed to help improve estimates of
porosity, saturation, permeability, detection of swelling clays, and rock mechanical

properties. The firm says that operators
can obtain more accurate estimates of
their reserves, design optimal completion
and stimulation programs, and maximize
production. GEM’s attachable cooling system and insulating flask allow the tool to
run for long periods downhole, operating
in conditions of as much as 350° F. and
20,000 psi.
Combining the sensitivity of the GEM
tool in the vertical sections of wells with
the LaserStrat cutting evaluation service
in the horizontal sections is designed to
provide operators with an understanding of reservoir mineralogy for the entire
well. The two services can also be used in
conjunction to improve geosteering of
horizontal sections.

The patented MTM seal consists of
flexible material contained inside a metal
shell. The structure creates a complete
metal barrier in the well, and when fully
energized, protects it from downhole
conditions.
Meanwhile, the firm has added a
second size of its safety valve, which is
suited for high pressure, high temperature
developments and dewatering gas wells,
adding a 41⁄2 in. size to the existing 27⁄8
in. version. Improving on a basic flapper
type safety valve design, the Torus allows
for a central conduit to pass through the
core where the conduit may be hydraulic
(minicoil or capillary string), electrical, or
fiber optic. This allows for the installation
of artificial lift or downhole monitoring in
existing wells without the requirement of
a full workover.

controls can yield
unsavory surprises
New attempts to moderate energy-price
movement with controls on commodity
trading might, like much regulation of markets, yield unsavory surprises.
The US Commodity Futures Trading
Commission is considering new controls on
off-exchange trading of energy derivatives.
And the Department of the Treasury has
sent Congress a plan for trading reform.
Propelling this regulatory push is the be-

lief that excessive speculation aggravates
swings in energy prices and makes markets
susceptible to manipulation.
Little about the effort—other than the
proposed extension to energy of regulation
now focused on agricultural commodities—is new, points out Michael Lewis of
Deutsche Bank AG’s London ofﬁce.
Congress has tried to pass laws limiting
commodities speculation for more than
100 years, Lewis writes in Deutsche Bank’s
Commodities Weekly of Aug. 14. The effort
accelerated in the 1920s.
“In 1921, legislation was introduced to
ensure grain futures trading was conﬁned
to regulated exchanges that allowed federal
scrutiny,” he writes. “In 1936, the Commodity Exchange Act was introduced to combat
excessive price declines in grain and cotton
prices, which were being blamed on speculators.”
Legislation in 1947 provided for the
publication of the names, addresses, and
market positions of large traders. Commodity prices were rising after World War II.
Lewis lists other attempts to curb
speculation, calling “the most draconian”
a 1958 law banning trading of an onion
futures contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Research published during
the 1960s said onion prices were more
stable before than after imposition of the
ban, Lewis reports. The research later was
challenged. But the ban didn’t keep onion
prices from swinging wildly in the 1970s.
In fact, Lewis says, the onion price
record suggests “the presence of a futures
market might actually reduce the price
volatility of a commodity.”
Of course the consequences of regulation often contradict intention. The push to
regulate energy derivatives, for example,
might cut activity on the New York Mercantile Exchange, Lewis warns, adding:
“Perversely focusing on regulation to curb
speculative activity may possibly increase
the pricing power of OPEC over time at a
time when the US government is attempting to do the exact opposite.”

Crude ﬁnds ‘comfortable’ price range
The “most comfortable” range for crude prices would be $65-75/bbl—“$10/bbl
below the minimum of what is the desired price in broad terms for the key producers” within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, said Paul Horsnell, a
managing director and head of commodities research at Barclays Capital in London.
Horsnell does not expect crude prices to remain locked between $65-75/bbl. However, he said, “If prices moved outside the range, we would expect them to move
back within it in a reasonably short time.” Horsnell reported Aug. 26, “After the initial
pullback in prices in early July, the range has held very ﬁrm indeed. Front-month
Brent prices have remained completely within the $65-75[/bbl] range throughout every trading day since July 20, while front-month West Texas Intermediate has stayed
within the range at all times since July 24.”
During the most recent price rollback, he said, “WTI bottomed intraday at $65.23/
bbl. Likewise, during the past week’s move to the top of the range, the highest intraday price for front-month Brent [was] $74.97, while the highest for front-month WTI
was $75 exactly.”
The front-month October crude contract traded “in a perfect $70-75/bbl range”
Aug. 24-28 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, said Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix,
Zug, Switzerland. In that last full business week of the month, the contract failed to
climb above $75/bbl, then tested but failed to break through the $70/bbl ﬂoor, ﬁnally
ﬁnishing the week by closing at $72.74/bbl on the New York Mercantile Exchange—
down a little more than $1/bbl for the week and “very close to the mid-range of
$72.50/bbl,” Jakob said. “From equity to currencies to oil, it seems that the focus of
all markets is the lack of liquidity,” Jakob said earlier that week. “In that environment,
ranges are hard to break.”
Horsnell sees “a strong fundamental reason” for the $65-75/bbl range to remain
dominant this quarter. “The range brings the market to the threshold of meeting
the price targets of key producers, but still leaves a discount,” Horsnell said. It is “a
signiﬁcant enough” increase from second quarter prices to reﬂect improvements in
market data and macroeconomic prospects “without sending a signal for supplyside pressure to be eased signiﬁcantly.” He added, “Likewise prices in that range
would not appear to be discounted so much in the face of weak short-term data ﬂow
as to create any impetus for further tightening. All in all, looked at from a purely fundamental and policy basis, the $65-75 range looked to us like the Goldilocks range
for the quarter.”
Japanese politics
Crude and other commodities were down further in early trading Aug. 31, as
weakness in Asian markets pressured US equities and a strengthening dollar undercut oil prices. “Markets in Japan, Asia’s second-largest consumer of oil, were down
upon news that Japanese manufacturers only increased output by 1.9% in July after
posting a 2.3% increase in June,” said analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond
James & Associates Inc.
They reported, “With the left-of-center Democratic Party set to form Japan’s new
government after its landslide victory on [Aug. 30], Japanese climate change policy
is likely to become more ambitious, i.e., more aligned with Europe. Historically,
Japan has been closer to the US in taking an ambivalent stance on climate issues.
While Japan already has some of the world’s highest levels of energy efﬁciency,
there is room for more pro-renewables policies. Also, Japan is likely to play a more
active role in the global climate talks leading up to the Copenhagen conference in
December.”
Jakob said, “The concern in the global economic picture is that while there has
been some improvement in manufacturing activity, it is not yet certain that it will be
followed by sustained consumer spending.” He said, “With the European consumer
already ﬁlled up on heating oil stocks and large layers of distillate stocks aﬂoat on
the water, the solver to this overhang would be a strong reduction of reﬁnery runs
in front of the winter. However, with the rebounding industrial demand, any strong
reduction of reﬁnery runs could seriously tighten the naphtha markets.”
At the end of August, Norway’s Frontline, the largest independent oil tanker
shipping group, estimated 40-45 very large crude carriers (VLCCs), or 10% of the
world ﬂeet, were storing crude oil, down from a peak of 60 VLCCs that were storing
crude in April. In New Orleans, analysts at Pritchard Capital Partners LLC said, “This
gradual unwind appears to be ﬂattening the crude curve and will most likely lead to
lower volatility across the crude curve.”

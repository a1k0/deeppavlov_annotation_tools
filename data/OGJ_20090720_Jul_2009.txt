Advancing Reservoir Performance

We Take the Heat
Hughes Christensen Vanguard Bits
Geothermal drilling and other hot-hole applications subject drill bits to extremely high
temperatures and pressures. These harsh drilling environments have always had a punishing
impact on bit performance ‚Äî until now. Finally, there‚Äôs a drill bit that‚Äôs engineered to withstand
the specific challenges of high-temperature drilling: The all-new Hughes Christensen Vanguard
series brings unique capabilities to these demanding applications ‚Äî next-generation drilling
technology you won‚Äôt find anywhere else.
 High-temperature elastomer compounds provide reliable, continuous service at
temperatures in excess of 500¬∞ Fahrenheit.
 Metal-sealed bearings use a metal-to-metal sealing system that delivers superior
performance under the most strenuous conditions.
 Specially formulated bearing grease extends bearing life with its thermal stability and
high viscosity.
Vanguard premium Tricone drill bits are customized to meet the individual requirements
of each application, for performance that simply can‚Äôt be beat. Only from
Hughes Christensen.

Oil sands investment to recover by yearend
The expected economic recovery in developing the oil sands in
Alberta may start in late 2009 or early 2010, said Robert J. Mason,
managing director, head of oil sands, investment banking, global
energy, and power group, TD Securities Inc., Calgary.
‚ÄúSome producers are thinking about restarting projects because
oil price forecasts are more definite,‚Äù Mason said, speaking July 14
at PennWell Corp.‚Äôs Oil Sands & Heavy Oil Technologies Conference
& Exhibition in Calgary. He added that capital cost have come down
by 30% in the last 9 months.
Projects he thought might be slow in restarting are those involving upgraders. Upgrader projects are still in question with
some deferred and others canceled, he said.
Mason noted that since fall of 2008, development activity has
been in a ‚Äúpause and evaluate‚Äù mode because of low oil prices, lack
of available financing, high borrowing costs, and inability of small
companies to raise capital.
One higher cost the companies will have to contend with is the
cost for handling carbon emissions. He said in past years, companies had expected this cost to add 25-30¬¢/bbl but now additional
costs of $2-3/bbl are more likely.
Labor forecasts have also come down. He noted that projections
are that new projects will need 25,000-28,000 fewer workers if
the pace of development is as slow as now expected.

Investor convicted in scheme targeting SOCAR
A federal jury in Manhattan convicted a US investor on July 10
of trying to bribe senior government officials in Azerbaijan in a
scheme to privatize the country‚Äôs national oil company in a rigged
auction, the US Department of Justice said.
Frederic A. Bourke Jr. of Greenwich, Conn., conspired with
Czech investor Viktor Kozeny and members of their consortium
to make a massive profit on the auction using options and vouchers to bid for shares of the State Oil Co. of the Azerbaijan Republic
(SOCAR), DOJ said.
DOJ said evidence presented during the 6-week trial showed
that the group flew millions of dollars in cash into the country for
Oily Rock Ltd., a company which Kozeny allegedly controlled, to
buy the options and vouchers.
Bourke, a neighbor of Kozeny‚Äôs in Aspen, Colo., invested about
$8 million in Oily Rock for family members and friends as well
as on his own behalf, DOJ said. Evidence also showed that Bourke
obtained directorships, salary, and stock options with other companies Kozeny allegedly set up and funded, DOJ said.
DOJ said that starting in August 1997 through the fall of 1998,
Bourke and others conspired to pay or cause to be paid millions

‚Äî Q u i c k Ta k e s

of dollars in bribes to Azeri government officials. In return, the
government officials were to ensure that the Bourke-Kozeny investment consortium would gain, in secret partnership with the
Azeri officials, a controlling interest in SOCAR and its substantial
oil reserves.
Bourke also arranged for two of the corrupt officials to travel to
New York City on different occasions in 1998 to receive medical
treatment, for which Oily Rock paid, according to DOJ. Thereafter,
in interviews with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in April-May
2002, Bourke falsely stated that he was not aware that Kozeny had
made the alleged payments to the Azeri officials, it said. DOJ indicted the two men in October 2005.
The jury convicted Bourke of conspiracy to violate the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Travel Act, and of lying to the
FBI. It acquitted him of a money laundering charge. At sentencing, which is scheduled for Oct. 13, Bourke faces up to 5 years in
prison and a $250,000 fine for each of the two charges on which
he was convicted.

BLM Colorado to hold its Ô¨Årst on line lease sale
The US Bureau of Land Management‚Äôs Colorado state office
posted a proposed list of parcels on July 13 for what will be the
agency‚Äôs first on line oil and gas lease sale.
Congress directed the US Department of the Interior agency to
conduct an online lease sale as part of DOI‚Äôs fiscal 2008 budget as
a one-time event to determine whether it is feasible, BLM said. It
selected Colorado for the event, which will be held entirely on line
and run from 9 a.m. on Sept. 9 to noon on Sept. 17.
The auction pilot‚Äôs web site is at www.blm.gov/leasingpilot. It
lists 38 parcels totaling 28,489 acres. BLM said the parcels will be
split into two groups and become available for bids on a staggered
basis over 2 days, with each group being offered for 7 days.
Similar to typical on line auctions, bidders will have the option
of submitting one-time set bids on parcels and proxy bids, which
automatically increase to a set amount indicated by the bidder, according to BLM.
It said bidders would have to register online to actually bid and
encouraged them to do so early to become familiar with the web
site and the auction guidelines.
Credit card information and a sworn statement of an intention
to buy are required. An on line tutorial is available at the web site,
which will remain available for viewing for 30 days after the sale
closes.
There will be no charge for filing protests, BLM said. Protests
of parcels being offered must be in writing and delivered by hand,
mail, or fax. BLM has not made any provision for filing protests on
line or by e-mail. ‚ú¶

is in Minden field 6 miles south of the Lutheran Church-5H well
that had an initial rate of 9 MMcfd. The company has 100% working interest.
The company reached total depth at two other Haynesville shale
horizontal wells, T. Swiley-4H in Minden field and Beard Taylor-1H
in Beckville field.
Goodrich Petroleum also held interests in three wells completed by Chesapeake Energy Corp. in Bethany-Longstreet field, Caddo
and DeSoto Parishes, La.
Initial rates were 12.5 MMcfd with 7,800 psi on an 18‚ÅÑ64-in.
choke at Johnson 32H-1, Goodrich 31%; 15.4 MMcfd with 6,100
psi on a 22‚ÅÑ64-in. choke at Wallace 36H-1, Goodrich 22%; and 14
MMcfd with 4,000 psi on a 22‚ÅÑ64-in. choke at the Bryan 25H-1,
Goodrich 13%.

Operators are climbing the learning curve in the Williston basin
by drilling long lateral wells in the Bakken and Three Forks formations with as many as 24 frac stages.
One operator, Brigham Exploration Co., Austin, Tex., said it is
continuing to see drilling and completion costs fall.
Initial rate at the Strobeck 27-34, in the Ross area of Mountrail
County, ND, is 1,788 b/d of oil and 1.4 MMcfd of gas from a long
lateral in Three Forks. Brigham Exploration completed the well
with 20 frac stimulation stages, 18 of which were effective.
Strobeck 27-34, which appears to have had the basin‚Äôs second
highest initial rate for a Three Forks completion, cost $3.9 million,
33% lower than company late 2008 authority for expenditures at
similar wells.
‚ÄúThe Strobeck 27-34 results also confirm the core taken from
our Anderson 28-33, which indicated that both the upper Three
Forks and middle Bakken formations were heavily saturated with
oil,‚Äù the company said.
Anderson is 1 mile west of Strobeck and about a mile southwest
of Brigham Exploration‚Äôs Carkuff-22 1H, which went on production at 1,110 b/d of oil after 12 frac stages in a short lateral.
The company recently drilled the lateral of its Anderson 28-33
on a 1,280-acre unit in the Ross area to 19,900 ft in the Bakken and ran 24 swell packers to bottom. A 24-stage frac operation,
believed to be a record number for the basin, is planned in early
August.
Brigham Exploration has spud the Brad Olson-1H 9-16 well in
the Rough Rider area of Williams County, ND, and plans 24 frac
stages in an intended 20,000-ft Bakken lateral at an estimated cost
of $6.25 million, 34% less than 2008 AFEs.
Brigham Exploration controls 35,200 net acres in the Ross area
and 100,345 net acres in the Rough Rider area. It is participating
in 20 Mountrail County Bakken wells operated by others in various
stages, including 12 already on production.

Daylight Resources Trust, Calgary, said it is working on a strategy to develop a gas resource play in the Jurassic Nikanassin zone
just below Cretaceous Cadomin at Elmworth in the Alberta Deep
Basin.
Two vertical wells in the first quarter found more than 100 m of
sand in the Nikanassin at 2,700-3,200 m and came on production
in March and April at initial rates of 2-3 MMcfd of gas.
Daylight Resources plans to drill one more vertical delineation
well and a horizontal well before the end of the 2009-10 winter
drilling season. It holds Nikanassin rights in more than 51,200
acres at Elmworth.
The company said it is investigating the potential for using the
same advanced horizontal drilling and multistage fracturing technologies on the Nikanassin that it has applied in the Cadomin.
Due to weak natural gas prices, Daylight Resources has deferred
the majority of its planned gas expenditures for the 2009 second
quarter and early third quarter to late third quarter and fourth
quarter.

Haynesville well results encourage operators

US nets $700 million for GOM leases

Forest Oil Corp., Denver, and Goodrich Petroleum Corp., Houston, reported results from recent Jurassic Haynesville horizontal
well completions in Louisiana and East Texas.
Forest, meanwhile, said it operated only four rigs in this year‚Äôs
second quarter and continues to defer significant investments until
drilling and completion costs are reduced to acceptable levels to
support a larger drilling program at current natural gas prices.
In Red River Parish, La., the Driver 13-1H well produced into
a sales line at 20.3 MMcfd of gas equivalent with 6,500 psi flowing casing pressure in early July. It had 10 frac stages in a 3,500-ft
horizontal leg and cost $9 million.
Forest has identified 110 potential horizontal locations on the
11,050 Haynesville prospective net acres it holds in Louisiana. It
will maintain a one-rig program in the parish for the rest of 2009
and one rig in other prospective areas of the play in Texas and Louisiana.
Goodrich Petroleum said the Taylor Sealey-3H in Panola County,
Tex., produced at 9.3 MMcfd with 5,200 psi on a 24‚ÅÑ64-in. choke. It

The US Department of the Interior‚Äôs Minerals Management Service said it accepted high bids valued at $700 million and awarded
328 leases to the successful high bidders who participated in the
Central Gulf of Mexico Oil and Gas Lease Sale 208.
MMS said funds from the total high bids will be distributed to
the general fund of the US Treasury, shared with the affected states,
and set aside for special uses that benefit all fifty states.
It said the leases were awarded following the completion of
an extensive, two-phase bid evaluation process to ensure that the
Federal government receives a fair monetary return for the public
mineral resources it makes available.
Seventy companies submitted 476 bids on 348 tracts in the sale,
held on Mar. 18. The total for high bids submitted on all tracts was
$703,048,523. Using the bid evaluation process, MMS rejected
high bids totaling $12,673,983 on 19 tracts as insufficient for fair
market value.
In addition, MMS said that a successful high bidder forfeited the
lease and the 1‚ÅÑ5th bonus which was submitted with the bid. As a

Production

Murphy starts producing Thunder Hawk Ô¨Åeld
Murphy Oil Corp. has started producing oil and associated gas
from Thunder Hawk field on Mississippi Canyon Block 734 in the
Gulf of Mexico. The field lies in more than 5,700 ft of water, about
145 miles southeast of New Orleans.
The facilities on the semisubmersible floating production unit
have a capacity to handle 45,000 bo/d and 70 MMscfd of gas.
Initial production is from three subsea completed wells tied
back with flowlines to the semisubmersible.
Operator Murphy has a 37.5% interest in Thunder Hawk. Partners are Eni Petroleum US LLC 25%, Statoil Hydro USA E&P Inc.
25%, and Marubeni Oil & Gas USA Inc. 12.5%.

Apache lets contract for Forties oil platforms
Apache North Sea Ltd. has contracted Petrofac Ltd. for the onshore engineering and offshore construction that will support the
five fixed platforms in Forties oil field in the UK North Sea.
The deal is worth ¬£25 million/year and it will last 3 years with
Apache holding two optional 1-year extensions.
Forties field is producing more than 70,000 b/d of oil and
Apache has spent more than $1.2 billion on the mature assets since
its acquisition in 2003. Apache is confident that Forties could produce oil for another 20 years and has identified 60 targets ranging
in size from less than 0.5 MMboe to 1.5 MMboe to drill; most of
the prospects are less than 1 MMboe.
In June, Apache started oil production from its Forties Charlie
6-3 well with 10,500 b/d (OGJ Online, June 22, 2009). The well
is the seventh development well brought on production at Forties this year. The well‚Äôs initial production rate is the field‚Äôs highest
since 1994, Apache said.

US drilling count drops

‚Äî Q u i c k Ta k e s

early September, US drilling is down by 12 units to 916 rotary rigs
working the week ended July 10, Baker Hughes Inc. reported.
That compares with 1,922 rigs drilling in the US during the
same period a year ago.
Land operations led the latest loss, down 7 rigs to 871 drilling.
Offshore drilling declined by 5 rigs to 37, all in the Gulf of Mexico.
Drilling in inland waters was unchanged with 8 units drilling.
Of the rigs still working, those drilling for oil increased by 5
to 234. Those drilling for natural gas declined by 16 to 672. There
were 10 rigs unclassified. Horizontal drilling decreased by 6 rigs to
390. Directional drilling increased 4 to 165.
Among major producing states, Louisiana was down 4 rigs to
130 drilling. California dropped 3 to 20. Texas and New Mexico
were down 2 each to 336 and 38, respectively. Wyoming was down
1 rig to 30; Alaska was down 1 to 5. States with unchanged rig
counts included Oklahoma, 82; Colorado, 45; and North Dakota,
40. Arkansas‚Äôs rig count increased by 1 to 45.

The coker contract is one of 13 process packages for which the
joint venture approved an awarding plan in June after a delay last
year during which Aramco assessed projects in light of global economic problems (OGJ, June 22, 2009, Newsletter).
Aramco and Total formed the joint venture in third quarter
2008. Aramco holds 62.5% and Total, 37.5%. Aramco plans to offer 25% of the joint venture to the Saudi public out of its share in
an initial public offering in the last quarter of 2010.

Venezuela acquires stake in Dominican reÔ¨Ånery
The Dominican Republic, struggling to pay off oil debts to Venezuela, agreed to transfer a 49% stake in its 34,000-b/d, stateowned Refineria Dominicana de Petroleo SA (Refidomsa) to Venezuela‚Äôs state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA.
The Dominican Republic has owned 100% of the refinery since
last December, when it bought the 50% stake formerly held by
Royal Dutch Shell PLC for $110 million.
Reports say the Shell sale was part of the firm‚Äôs strategy to exit
all of its businesses in the Caribbean in order to focus on other
regions of the world.
The sale of the 50% stake in the refinery, which began operating in the mid-1970s, coincided with a visit to the Dominican
Republic by Venezuelan officials, led by PDVSA commercial director Ramon Herrera.

The Venezuelans were in the Dominican Republic for talks on
how the island nation could use goods and services to pay off $1
billion in debt to Venezuela for oil supplied under the Petrocaribe
initiative.
The Dominican Republic is one of 18 Central American and
Caribbean nations that participate in the PetroCaribe energy initiative under which Venezuela offers its crude and refined products to
buyers on favorable terms.
The Herrera-led delegation discussed matters with Dominican
Finance Minister Vicente Bengoa. The Dominican Republic currently receives 33,000 b/d of Venezuelan oil under the Petrocaribe
initiative but wants an increase to 50,000 b/d.
In June of this year, Bengoa announced a plan for the repayment
if its $1 billion oil debt, saying the bill would be ‚Äúpartially‚Äù settled
with black beans and tourist packages‚Äîamong other goods and
services.
Bengoa said PDVSA would acquire its 49% share of the refinery
by foregoing 60% of the payment it normally receives from the
Dominican Republic for PetroCaribe oil over a 3-month period‚Äî
about $130 million.
Venezuela‚Äôs Energy and Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez said his
country‚Äôs plan is eventually to integrate the Dominican refinery
into a network of eight refineries in various countries that are being upgraded or built by Venezuela as part of its PetroCaribe initiative. ‚ú¶

Chevron Australia awards construction contract

BLM schedules times to discuss Ruby Pipeline

Chevron Australia Pty. Ltd. has awarded a $500 million (Aus.)
contract to Thiess Pty. Ltd. for site preparation and construction of
temporary facilities for the proposed 3-train LNG and domestic gas
Gordon Project on Barrow Island off Western Australia.
The project will be supplied from the Greater Gorgon gas fields,
including Jansz and Io.
Theiss is in a joint venture with Decmil Group Ltd. and Kentz
Corp. Ltd. that in June was awarded another $500 million (Aus.)
contract to design and construct an accommodation village capable
of housing 3,300 people on the island.
Project scope for the new contract includes preparation of finished earthwork levels for the LNG plant and associated storage
tanks, along with production of road base material and feedstock
for concrete aggregate production. It also includes reticulation of
site services, a material offloading facilities causeway and breakwater plus temporary construction facilities to be used by other
contractors later.
The offshore gas fields will be developed via subsea wells and
two pipelines bringing gas to Barrow Island where three LNG
trains will each produce 5 million tonnes/year. There will also be
a 300-terajoule/day domestic gas plant feeding into a pipeline to
the mainland and a carbon dioxide sequestration plant with capability of storing the high levels of carbon dioxide contained in the
Gorgon field in deep formations beneath the island.
Chevron has 50% of the project while ExxonMobil Corp. and
Royal Dutch Shell PLC have 25% each.

The US Bureau of Land Management will host seven public
meetings during July to discuss a proposed natural gas pipeline
that would extend from southwestern Wyoming across Utah and
Nevada and into Oregon.
Meetings are scheduled July 21 in Malin, Ore.; July 22 in Lakeview, Ore.; July 23 in Winnemucca, Nev.; July 27 in Brigham City,
Utah; July 28 in Elko, Nev.; July 29 in Kemmerer, Wyo.; and July 30
in Hyrum, Utah. All meetings will begin at 7 p.m.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission published a draft
environmental impact statement on June 19 for the proposed 675mile pipeline, which would have an initial design capacity of as
much as 1.5 bcfd. Ruby Pipeline LLC, an El Paso Corp. subsidiary, is
the sponsor. FERC will accept comments on the draft EIS through
Aug. 10.
BLM said the federal Mineral Leasing Act makes it responsible
for issuing rights-of-way on public lands. It said it is working with
the US Bureau of Reclamation, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the
US Forest Service, the US Conservation Service, the US Army Corps
of Engineers, the Utah Public Lands Policy Coordination Office,
and the Lincoln County, Wyo., Board of County Commissioners.
Cooperating agencies have jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to resources potentially affected by the proposed
project and participate in the analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act, BLM said. ‚ú¶

In the US market, Sprague said,
‚ÄúDiesel still seems to be somewhat of a

traditional petrol,‚Äù said Sprague. Such
markets make a diesel model ‚Äúalmost a

For Kia to bring its diesel vehicles
into the US, Sprague said, ‚ÄúThere are a
lot of US regulations, and the company
would have to ameliorate its diesel engines to meet the very strict US requirements.‚Äù ‚ú¶

Nigeria and the market
The oil market has lost 300,000 b/d of supply
in 2 months from a single exporter, and the price
of crude is falling. Until demand began faltering
as the world entered recession at the end of 2007,
the mere threat of such a loss would have boosted
prices at least temporarily. That it didn‚Äôt happen
this time shows how thoroughly conditions have
changed.
The supply loss came in Nigeria, where rebellion is crippling production and transportation. In
its July Oil Market Report, the International Energy
Agency estimated June oil production in Nigeria
at 1.72 million b/d from capacity of 2.55 million
b/d. The 300,000 b/d loss due to a surge in violence adds to shut-ins totaling 500,000-600,000
since insurrection began at the end of 2005, according to IEA. Nigerian National Petroleum Corp.
on June 25 said 1.4 million b/d of production
was offline.

company‚Äôs Nigerian output, because of sabotage to
pipelines.
Obviously, the threat to Nigerian production,
spread vulnerably among 600 fields and carried
by 6,000 km of pipeline, is serious. Yet a market
that 2 years ago would have been in panic has
shrugged off the loss as though it doesn‚Äôt need the
oil.
Alternative supplies indeed are at hand. Oil
inventories held by economically developed members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development are strongly above average
both in volume and relative to expected consumption rates.
Replacement supply is available, too, from production that‚Äôs promptly available but not on stream.
In its latest report, IEA put spare production capacity among members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, excluding Iraq, at 6.34

Unconventional Gas:
New Methods. New Supply.

Change happens fast in this industry and keeping clients aware of new
technology and solutions is essential.
Over the last decade technology advancements improved our capabilities to
predict, drill and produce natural gas in areas previously thought impossible.
These more sophisticated technologies have led to new opportunities in
re-examining existing wells and bringing untapped on line reserves leading
to new supplies.
Plan today to exhibit and sponsor at the Unconventional Gas International
Conference & Exhibition, September 29 ‚Äì October 1 at the Fort Worth
Convention Center. Come by and meet decision makers who are willing to
discuss their next project.

Demand for oil will shrink this
year‚Äîas will demand for almost all
sources of energy in the US‚Äîbecause
of economic contraction. Gas, coal, and
nuclear energy demand will decline,
but the use of hydroelectric power generation and all other renewable energy
sources will grow from last year.
Global oil demand will decline from
2008, led by a decrease in oil consumption by the world‚Äôs
advanced economies.
Production of crude
and condensate in the
US this year will increase, and imports will
decline almost 6% from
a year ago.
Volumes of crude and products in
storage are abundant and are expected
to remain that way even though worldwide oil production this year is forecast
to shrink in excess of 2 million b/d on
average.

Weak energy demand

Worldwide outlook
Worldwide oil demand will average
83.8 million b/d this year, down from
the 2008 average of 86.2 million b/d.
This is the latest demand estimate from
the International Energy Agency, which
has lowered its outlook repeatedly
during the lingering global economic
slump.
Economic weakness will cause oil
demand inside the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development to slump by 2.4 million b/d from
last year‚Äôs 47.5 million b/d, according
to the latest estimates from IEA. Demand will fall in North America and in
the OECD countries in Europe and Asia.
Outside the OECD, demand for oil
will be unchanged from 2008, averaging 38.7 million b/d. IEA estimates that
demand will decline in the former Soviet Union (FSU) but climb slightly in
the Middle East and in China. In other
non-OECD Asian countries, demand

Midyear Forecast

The US will consume less natural
gas this year due to weaker industrial,
commercial, and residential demand,
but supplies of gas will be plentiful.
Inventories of gas are hefty as a result
of a surge in production last year. The
amount of gas produced in the US in
2009 will decline slightly as a result
of much lower prices compared with

will move a little lower from last year.
Oil demand averaged 87.5 million b/d in the first quarter of 2008,
and then slid each successive quarter
to bottom out at an estimated average 83.1 million b/d in the second
quarter of this year. IEA forecasts that
worldwide oil demand will climb
in the third quarter to average 83.6

aging 83.9 million b/d.
Meanwhile, supply from producers
outside the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries also has been in
decline. In particular, countries that are
members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
will post a 5.1% supply decline this
year vs. 2008, according to IEA.
Declining oil production in the UK
and Norway will lead the slump in
OECD Europe oil supply this year, but
OECD Pacific and North America will
log small increases in 2009 oil output.
Among the non-OECD members, IEA
forecasts sizable production increases
this year in Brazil and China. Oil supply from FSU is expected to increase
to average 13 million b/d this year, up
from 12.8 million b/d last year. Russian
production will be almost flat year-onyear, but IEA expects output increases in
Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan.
Starting in September 2008, OPEC
has agreed three times to lower crude
output by a cumulative 4.2 million b/d.
IEA reported that by June of this year,
OPEC had reduced production by 2.9
million b/d, pegging effective spare
production capacity at 5.2 million b/d.
Although the organization‚Äôs crude
production has been waning since it
implemented the lower output ceilings, OPEC‚Äôs NGL production has been
climbing. NGL output from OPEC
members this year will average 5.2 million b/d, up from 4.7 million b/d last
year.
OGJ forecasts that OPEC crude output will average 28.4 million b/d this
year, putting upward pressure on inventories. Combined with IEA‚Äôs outlook
for demand, the global stockbuild will
average 500,000 b/d.

that all OPEC crudes averaged $121.52/

to $35.48/bbl on Jan. 1, 2009, before

tals; rather it was due to optimistic
expectations of future demand based on
early signs of economic recovery. Investors saw oil as a safe commodity and a
good store of value in which to invest.
Oil prices retreated in early July due
to signs of continued economic sluggishness and therefore a further delay
in oil-demand recovery. Lower forecasts
of 2009 oil demand sent futures prices
below $60/bbl by July 10.

Product prices
Like crude prices, retail prices for
all oil products will be sharply off their
2008 highs. This will be the first year
since 2002 that annual average retail
gasoline prices have declined.
OGJ forecasts that the pump price
for all types of motor gasoline in the
US will average $2.30/gal this year.
Last year the pump price of regular and
premium unleaded gasoline averaged
$3.317/gal, according to EIA.
Heating oil prices also will retreat
from their 2008 record average of
$3.22/gal excluding taxes. OGJ expects
heating oil will decline 29% this year.
Prices of diesel fuel, jet fuel, and
propane also will post lower averages
this year as compared with 2008 prices.

US economy
OGJ forecasts that gross domestic
product in the US this year will decline
2%. The US economy shrunk 5.5% in
this year‚Äôs first quarter, as reported by
the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
As the Federal Reserve Board reported following its latest decision to
leave the federal funds interest rate unchanged at ¬º% or less, new data show
that the pace of economic contraction
is slowing. Household spending has
shown further signs of stabilizing but

remains constrained by ongoing job
losses, lower housing wealth, and tight
credit, the FRB said.
Consumer credit has been in decline
since the fourth quarter of 2008, and
unemployment at the end of June
reached 9.5%‚Äîthe highest level in 26
years.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that since the start of the recession
in December 2007, the number of unemployed persons has increased by 7.2
million, and the unemployment rate has
risen by 4.6 percentage points.
Last year GDP grew by 1%, posting
declines in the third and fourth quarters
following a first half with economic
growth.
US energy demand this year will
contract faster than the economy. OGJ
forecasts that demand for energy will
shrink in 2009 such that energy efficiency improves to 8,430 btu/dollar
from 8,520 btu/dollar a year ago.

electricity demand and increases in the
use of other energy sources for electric
power generation. OGJ expects coal
demand will total 21.07 quads, comprising 21.9% of the US energy market.
This compares with coal‚Äôs 22.6% mar24

ket share a year ago.
The use of nuclear power will be
little changed from last year and will
total 8.45 quads, a decline of only
0.1%. The number of operable nuclear

units has held at 104 since 1998, and
this year nuclear energy‚Äôs share of the
US energy market will be 8.8%. Nuclear
energy accounts for about 20% of all
electric power generation in the US.
Hydropower and the use of other
renewable forms of energy will climb
2% this year, totaling 7.6 quads. This
includes demand for wind, solar, and
biofuels, as well as geothermal electric
power generation and wood and waste
energy. In total these renewable energy
sources will account for 7.9% of all
energy consumed in the US this year,
up from 7.5% last year.

US oil demand
Demand for petroleum products in
the US will fall to average 18.732 million b/d, down from the 2008 average
of 19.497 million b/d.
Against weak second-half 2008
demand, gasoline demand in 2009 will
grow, but only by 0.2%. OGJ forecasts
that gasoline demand will average 9.01
million b/d this year.
Demand for gasoline plunged last
year amid economic weakness, higher
retail prices, and rising unemployment.
Fewer miles are being driven as fewer
workers commute and vacationers have
cut many discretionary road trips.

transportation as well as in power and

is in the form of products rather than
crude.

Oil inventories
US inventories of crude and products
at yearend will be slightly larger than at
yearend 2008.
At midyear, about 350 million bbl
of crude were held in commercial
stocks, including 30 million bbl at
Cushing, Okla. A year earlier crude
stocks at Cushing totaled about 20 million bbl.
Declining imports will relieve some
of the pressure on these inventories
through the rest of the year. OGJ forecasts that crude stocks, excluding crude
held in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve
(SPR), will stand at 330 million bbl at
the end of this year. Crude held in the
SPR will total 726 million bbl at yearend, OGJ forecasts.
Product inventories will total 720
million bbl at the end of this year, down
from 760 million bbl at midyear. Total
products in storage stood at 709 million
bbl at yearend 2008.
Stocks of distillate at mid-2009 were
27% higher than a year earlier, while
the amount of gasoline in stocks was
little changed from mid-2008. Resid
in storage at the middle of 2009 was
down about 10% from a year earlier.

ReÔ¨Åning
Poor refining margins and large oil
product inventories amid weak demand
will weigh on refinery utilization this
year, bringing the average utilization
rate at US refineries to 83.6%, down
from 85.3% a year ago. Operable capacity will total 17.675 million b/d.
First-half 2009 refining margins
moved sharply lower from those a year
ago. West Coast refiners incurred the

Modest US, Canada drilling pickup seen in second half
Alan Petzet
Chief Editor-Exploration
Drilling in the US and Canada could
recover modestly in the last 6 months
of 2009 if oil and gas prices stabilize or
improve.
As oil prices tumbled from highs
near $150/bbl in mid-2008, the rig
count followed to 2009 lows. Rig activity has seemed to begin to
stabilize and pick up again
only in the last month.
What little strengthening the US rig count has
been able to muster lately
has been tied mainly to rigs
drilling for oil, but oil price
fluctuations have tested
even that firmness in recent
weeks.
Still, several onshore
shale gas plays have shown
strength through the drill28

ing downturn.
Rig counts in the US and Canada
have averaged about 37% lower in the
first half of 2009 than they did in the
first half of 2008.
Elsewhere in the world, comparing the same period shows declines of
10% in Africa, 7% in Europe, 5% in the
Middle East, 4% in Asia-Pacific, and 2%
in the Western Hemisphere outside the

US activity
US rig utilization in January through
June year to year was down 38% onshore and 14% offshore, according to
Baker Hughes Inc.
Areas of first half year to year
increase were in shale gas plays that
buoyed rig counts in North Louisiana,
Pennsylvania, and Arkansas, and in conventional drilling in Kansas.
Many operators responded decisively
to the drops in commodity prices. Continental Resources Inc., Enid, Okla., for
example, had been running 32 operated rigs in October 2008 with plans
to increase to 35 by the end of the year
but instead trimmed to 7 rigs on Feb.
26, 2009.
Wyoming, state of busiest drilling in
terms of numbers of wells due to the
Powder River basin coalbed methane
play, fell about the same percentage as
the total US onshore.
Most of the Texas districts were
down 30-58% on the year, drilling off
Texas was cut in half, and Texas inland
waters drilling almost ceased.
Oklahoma averaged 109 rigs/week
in the first half of 2009 versus 203 in
the first half of 2008, and Colorado slid
to 59 from 114.
Baker Hughes shows a slight increase
in Alaska, but state officials who follow rotary and coil tubing drilling say
the year to year first half well count is
down 44%.
At the end of 2008, they said, the
North Slope had 2 coil and 9 rotary rigs
drilling and Cook Inlet had five rotary
rigs running. As June ended, however,
North Slope work fell to 7 development
drilling operations (3 coil and 4 rotary)
and only two rigs were drilling in Cook
Inlet.
Geothermal drilling eclipsed oil and
gas activity in Nevada. Operators spudded only one oil well in the first half
of 2009 compared with four in early
2008 and 3 in the second half. Geothermal work has been running about
60% exploratory and 40% development
drilling.
OGJ‚Äôs Canadian forecast is based on
a shrinking number of gas wells drilled,

Stalemate likely
on Section 526

US

House and Senate committees have each approved
amendments to Section 526 of the
2007 Energy Independence and Security Act. But the devil, once again, is
in the details.
Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.)
fought for insertion of the section
into the energy bill late in its conference. The section bars government
agencies from signing contracts for
fuel from unconventional sources
with a bigger carbon impact than
conventional sources.
Waxman‚Äôs primary concern was a
US Air Force coal-to-liquids program.
But it quickly became apparent early
in 2008 that the prohibition could
be extended to oil produced from
Canadian oil sands.
Waxman exchanged letters with
US Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff
Bingaman (D-NM) on the matter,
and the House passed a measure that
aimed to clear things up. To many
people, however, it did not.
‚ÄúLast year, the House apparently
tried to set a precedent,‚Äù an oil industry lobbyist told me on July 10. ‚ÄúThe
problem is that while the House went
on record, its language didn‚Äôt really
clarify what‚Äôs on the books.‚Äù

the Brownback-Bingaman amendment
to the House Rules Committee that
was marking up the federal defense
authorization bill, but it was ruled out
of order. The committee also rejected
a proposal by Rob Bishop (R-Utah) to
give the US Defense secretary authority
to waive Section 526‚Äôs requirements if
he considers it appropriate.
Instead, it approved an amendment
on June 24 offered by a freshman,
Gerald E. Connelly (D-Va.), which essentially reiterated the 2008 measure
with language about fuel produced
from a predominantly unconventional
source. A day later, the full House
passed the defense authorization bill,
with the amendment, in a 416-0 vote.

Arguably conventional

‚ÄúSection 526 originally had so
many ambiguous provisions, and last
year‚Äôs amendment didn‚Äôt help it. We
would argue that oil from oil sands
has been produced for decades and
could reasonably be considered a
conventional source, for example,‚Äù
the lobbyist said.
The goal remains to let US refiners
keep using crude from Canadian oil
sands, she said, adding that some
people hoped the Senate would insert

counterparties to all customized and
noncentrally cleared OTC derivatives.
Given their higher levels of risk, capital
requirements for derivative contracts
that are not centrally cleared must be
set substantially about those for contracts that are centrally cleared.‚Äù
Committee members asked what
steps could be taken to assure full
international cooperation so contracts
don‚Äôt simply move to significantly
less regulated overseas venues. ‚ÄúOil
has driven the calls to reform how we
regulate these markets, but it‚Äôs globally
traded,‚Äù said Rep. David Scott (D-Ga.),
a member of both committees.
Geithner said he approved of CFTC
Chairman Gary G. Gensler‚Äôs July 7
announcement that he would hold a
hearing to establish federal limits on
energy commodity speculation and
consider whether various market participants should be exempt. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clearly
an effort to begin to address price
volatility issues, but I believe more
steps need to be taken to make markets
more transparent,‚Äù he said.
He also conceded that there‚Äôs a risk
that some countries might not want
to match new, tougher US regulations
of OTC derivatives. The administration is working closely with governments in Europe and Asia to coordinate
reforms, Geithner said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying
to do something that‚Äôs never been
done, to move together so that trading
doesn‚Äôt move abroad, so we‚Äôre trying
to involve all global financial centers,‚Äù
he said.
Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank (D-Mass.) suggested
that legislation authorizing reforms
could contain a provision allowing
bilateral sanctions against any country
which clearly tries to attract commodity trading business with looser regulations. He and Agriculture Committee
Chairman Collin C. Peterson (D-Minn.)
said that work on actual legislation
probably won‚Äôt begin until September,
but that a hearing was needed now to
discuss initial proposals and air concerns. ‚ú¶

US senators introduce bill to promote NGVs
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
US Senate Majority Leader Harry
M. Reid (D-Nev.) joined Sens. Orrin G.
Hatch (R-Utah) and Robert B. Menendez (D-NJ) in introducing legislation
on July 8 to increase use of natural gas
in US motor vehicles.
‚ÄúEach day, our nation consumes
about 21 million bbl of oil, more than
25% of the world‚Äôs supply. Nearly 70%
is imported from outside our borders. With only 3% of the world‚Äôs oil
reserves, we cannot produce our way
to a safe and secure energy future,‚Äù
said Reid. ‚ÄúWe must get serious about
using cleaner-burning natural gas and
renewable energy, and this legislation is
a strong step in the right direction.‚Äù
The three senators said their bill, S.
1408, would expand the alternative

fuel vehicle and refueling property tax
credits in several ways. It would make
all dedicated NGVs eligible for a federal
tax credit equal to 80% of the vehicle‚Äôs
incremental cost, instead of only some
NGVs as is the case now. It would make
all bifuel NGVs eligible for a 50% federal tax credit for the first time.
The bill would increase allowable incremental cost limits to more accurately
reflect costs of producing or converting NGVs. For a light-duty vehicle, the
purchase tax credit cap would climb
to $12,500 from $5,000. For all other
vehicles, the cap would be doubled.
The bill also would extend for 10
years alternative fuel credits for natural
gas used as vehicle fuel, for the purchase of an NGV, and for installing NGV
refueling equipment. It would let state
and local governments issue tax-exempt
bonds to finance NGV projects. It would

authorize grants for light-duty and
heavy-duty NGV engine development.

Other provisions
It would allow 100% of the cost of
an NGV manufacturing plant that is
placed in service before Jan. 1, 2015,
to be expensed and to be treated as a
deduction in the taxable year in which
the facility was placed in service. This
would decrease to 50% after Dec. 31,
2014, and would be phased out by Jan.
1, 2020.
S. 1408 also would require federal
agencies, when complying with mandatory federal fleet alternative fuel vehicle
purchase requirements, to buy dedicated alternative fuel vehicles unless the
agency can show that alternative fuel
is unavailable or that purchasing such
vehicles would be impractical.
‚ÄúWe saw last summer how the wild

fluctuations in oil prices helped to
wreck our economy and we‚Äôve seen
how pollutants from dirty fuels are
wrecking our planet,‚Äù said Menendez.
‚ÄúOur economic crisis has shined a
spotlight on the urgent need for alternative, cleaner, and cheaper sources of
energy that we don‚Äôt have to import. By

OPEC expected to add 2 million b/d to NGL capacity
Natural gas liquids and condensate

provide about half of the growth, with
peak capacity of 300,000 b/d by about
2011. The project‚Äôs start-up was delayed
to 2009 from 2008, said IEA.

Expanding the value chain
Deloitte LLP recently issued a

calls for 11.1 billion gal of renewable

year, escalating to 36 billion gal by

Deloitte foresees trouble for US reÔ¨Åning industry
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
Refining margins in the US are likely
to shrink in coming years because
stricter fuel economy standards and
rising mandates for blending ethanol
and other biofuels will reduce gasoline
demand, Deloitte LLP said in a recent
study.
Roger Ihne, a principal with Deloitte
in Houston, wrote a study entitled ‚ÄúA
Tsunami of Change Bearing Down on
the Refining Industry.‚Äù He spoke with
36

reporters about his findings during a
news briefing on July 9.
‚ÄúOver 15-20 years, we can expect to
see a reduction in gasoline demand,‚Äù
Ihne said. He estimates 1.5 million b/d
of US refining capacity will shut down
although he did not give a date for
when he expects that to happen.
He emphasized that he was not
projecting ‚Äúthe demise of the refining
industry.‚Äù A lot of uncertainty exists
while refiners await the outcome of
proposed legislation about stricter fuel

economy standards and renewable fuels
mandates.
Climate change legislation also could
add costs because refiners are expected
to have to invest in ways to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.
‚ÄúIn the short run, refiners can reduce
throughput or shut down less efficient
units,‚Äù Ihne said. ‚ÄúOver the long haul,
though, it‚Äôs hard to justify keeping a
refinery operating while selling less
output at a time when profit margins
are declining and costly upgrades are
required.‚Äù

History repeating
‚ÄúThe golden age of refining ended last year

won‚Äôt be back any time soon.‚Äù He said the age ended
a 4-year run of good refining margins. ‚ÄúA lot of the
assumptions refiners had just 2 years ago are likely to
be turned on their head.‚Äù
Ihne compares the current scenario that refiners
are facing to the shakeout that followed the oil price
shock in the late 1970s.
‚ÄúThe average refinery utilization rate dropped
in the US to 84% in 1979, a little above where it is
now,‚Äù Ihne said. ‚ÄúIt then fell to less than 80%, where
it stayed until 1986. Over the next 2 decades, the
number of US refineries was halved from 319 in
1980 to 149 in 2000.‚Äù
The US Energy Information Administration has
forecast the utilization rate for US refining will slide
to 78.5% in 2010 as a result of reduced demand. The
last time utilization rates were that low was 1985.
EIA expects gasoline demand will decline by 13% by
2030. ‚ú¶

Egyptian authorities have announced
the arrest of 26 men, most of them engineers and technicians suspected of links
with the terrorist al-Qaeda organization,
on charges of plotting attacks on oil pipelines and ships transiting the Suez Canal.
The Egyptian Interior Ministry allege
that the suspects, 25 Egyptians and a Palestinian, who had prepared remote-controlled detonators and explosives, were in
contact with the Islamic Army of Palestine
and were awaiting instructions from an
al-Qaeda operative based abroad.
Egyptian authorities, who confiscated
explosives, electronics, and diving suits,
alleged that the suspects had prepared the
remote-controlled detonators and explosives out of armaments left in the Sinai
Desert from Egypt‚Äôs wars with Israel.
The US Energy Information Administration considers the Suez Canal and the
nearby Suez-Mediterranean pipeline as
one of the world‚Äôs seven most important
chokepoints or transits for oil, whose
closure ‚Äúwould add 6,000 miles of transit around the continent of Africa.‚Äù

according to a recent risk report.
The report, entitled ‚ÄúResource Industries & Security Issues in Northern

of Canada‚Äôs petroleum reserves.
The five main threat groups include
individual saboteurs, ecoterrorists,
mainstream environmentalists, First

constitute a distinct Aboriginal nation
largely based in western Canada.
‚ÄúAll except the M√©tis have, at various times, used some combination of

He says the Peace River country

‚ÄúThese people may see roads,

Remote homesteaders

These remote homesteaders are

Both of the blocks that drew bids are
in the Punta del Este basin. Uruguay
has no hydrocarbon production, and
Argentina has none in this part of the
Atlantic Ocean.
Brazil‚Äôs Petroleo Brasileiro SA, YPF

Area 4 covers 3,000 sq km in
50-200 m of water 125-150
miles off Montevideo. Area 3
borders Argentina waters, and Area 4 is
north of Area 3.

Interests are Petrobras and YPF 40%
each and GALP Energia 20%.
YPF, a subsidiary of Repsol YPF of
Spain, is Argentina‚Äôs largest oil producer.
Ancap will evaluate the offers on
behalf of the government and decide
whether the bids should be accepted.
The initial term of the licenses, if issued, is 4 years, and Ancap has the right
to participate in the exploitation phase
if hydrocarbons are discovered.
Uruguay had offered 11 blocks in

Total, Novatek to develop Termokarstovoye gas Ô¨Åeld
Total SA will develop the onshore
Termokarstovoye gas field in Russian
Arctic under a joint venture with OAO
Novatek, Russia‚Äôs largest independent
gas producer.
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin said the deal indicated Russia‚Äôs
strategic gas fields are open to foreign
investment.
According to a heads of agreement,
Total will take a 49% interest in Terneftegas, a wholly owned subsidiary of Novatek, with the remaining 51% interest
in Novatek‚Äôs hands.
A final investment decision on the
estimated $900 million project is expected in 2011 once Novatek and Total
complete appraisal and development
studies. Termokarstovoye is 250 km east
of Tarkosale where Novatek operates a
processing facility for its own onshore
production. The field has a potential of
more than 47.3 billion cu m of gas and
about 10.3 million tons of condensate.
Total‚Äôs ‚Äútechnological capabilities will complement our experience
developing complex geological assets
and facilitate the effective development
of the remote Termokarstovoye field,‚Äù
said Leonid Mikhelson, chief executive
of Novatek.
The deal shall be closed upon approval of the Federal Antimonopoly
Service.
It builds upon Total‚Äôs other projects in Russia, including Shtokman
gas-condensate field in the Barents Sea
where the final investment decision is
to be made next year. The Shtokman
first development phase will produce
23.7 billion cu m/year, including 7.5
million tons/year that will be exported
as LNG.
Total also operates Kharyaga field in
the Nenets Autonomous Region. Under
the third phase current production level
will rise by 50% to 30,000 boe/d by
2011.
According to an analyst report from
the Royal Bank of Scotland, the partner-

ship between Total and Novatek could
lead to expanded LNG cooperation on
the massive South Tambey field.
‚ÄúTermokarstov holds less than 6-7%
of overall Novatek reserves, and we
believe that by 2013 the field would
contribute only about 1 billion cu m,
or less than 2%, to Novatek production
based on the 51% stake,‚Äù the report said.
‚ÄúNovatek needs an international partner
to develop this field and build an LNG
facility, and we believe that Total, one of
the top three companies worldwide in
LNG and with an existing relationship
with Novatek, is an ideal partner. Future
cooperation on LNG is also facilitated by
the enthusiastic support of the Kremlin,
with Putin also calling for higher Russian
LNG production.‚Äù

Foreign investors have been hesitant
to develop projects following Royal
Dutch Shell PLC‚Äôs significant cession of
its stake in Sakhalin-2 to OAO Gazprom
under intense government pressure.
Under a draft law, the government stipulated foreign companies need approval
from a special government commission
if they want to participate in developing
strategic oil and gas fields.
Christophe de Margerie, chief executive officer of Total, told the Moscow
Times, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs difficult to
work in Russia. One only needs to
learn to work efficiently with Gazprom,
Novatek, and Rosneft. We‚Äôre prepared
to invest more into the Russian economy.‚Äù ‚ú¶

USGS lists 76 billion boe on Barents Sea shelf
More than 76 billion boe may be
technically recoverable on the Barents
Sea shelf, the US Geological Survey said.
The mean estimate of undiscovered,
conventional, technically recoverable
petroleum resources in four geologic
provinces on the Barents shelf included
11 billion bbl of oil, 380 tcf of natural
gas, and 2 billion bbl of natural gas
liquids.
The US Department of the Interior
agency completed the assessment in
2008 as part of its Circum-Arctic Oil
and Gas Resource Appraisal. The shelf

lies entirely north of the Arctic Circle
covering 1.76 million sq km off northern Norway and Russia. Most lies in less
than 500 m of water.
‚ÄúThis area shares important characteristics with many Arctic basins, such
as sparse data, high geologic uncertainty, substantial petroleum-resource
potential, and technical barriers that
impede exploration and development,‚Äù
the USGS report said.
Most of the undiscovered petroleum
appears to be in the East Barents basin
province, it indicated. ‚ú¶

Shah gas Ô¨Åeld development agreements signed
ConocoPhillips and Abu Dhabi
National Oil Co. (ADNOC) have signed
joint venture and field entry agreements
for developing Shah gas-condensate
field in Abu Dhabi.
The development involves onshore
sour gas-condensate reservoirs in Shah
field, about 180 km southwest of Abu
Dhabi city.

The field, discovered in 1966, had
original reserves of 500-600 million
bbl of 30¬∞ gravity oil in Cretaceous carbonates at 8,000 ft. The gas-condensate
is in the deeper Jurassic Arab formation
(see map, OGJ, Aug. 18, 2008, p. 44).
The development includes construction of gas gathering systems, gas
processing trains, and product pipe-

Return of most reserves lost in Gustav, Ike predicted
Mark J. Kaiser
Yunke Yu

Baton Rouge
From our assessment,
Production
the gas structures damaged during Hurricanes Gustav and Ike
in the Gulf of Mexico present better
economics and redevelopment potential
than oil structures, and we predict that
companies will redevelop 196 million
boe, or nearly 95% of the remaining
reserves.
Each destroyed structure is a candidate for redevelopment and is unique
in its production capacity and damages
incurred.
During August and September 2008,
Hurricanes Gustav and Ike passed
through the gulf and damaged and
destroyed many offshore oil and gas
structures.
The final official government assessment listed 60 destroyed platforms and
31 extensively damaged structures. The
destroyed platforms represented 1.6%
of the oil and 2.5% of the gas produced
in the gulf. Remaining reserves from
these platforms are estimated at about
234 million boe valued between $4.610.9 billion.
Although the number of structures
destroyed by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike
was half the total destroyed from the
2004-05 hurricane seasons, we estimate
that the reserves at risk are about twice
as large and three times as valuable.

bent conductors at the mud line (Fig. 1). Rendition from Twachtman Synder and Byrd Inc., now Proserve Inc.

Hurricanes
Powered by heat from the sea, a
hurricane acts as a gigantic heat engine
transforming warm ocean water into
powerful wind fields. Hurricanes are
typically about 300-350 miles wide and
have extreme horizontal pressure gradients that generate powerful winds.
Wind speed and precipitation intensity both increase toward the center and
generate waves and currents that stress
offshore structures and may lead to
catastrophic failure.
Hurricane force winds usually extend 25-50 miles on each side of the
storm path and represent approximate
boundaries where structures are most
vulnerable. Typically, hurricanes destroy
2-4% of structures exposed to hurricane force winds and damage another
3-6%.
Old structures especially are vulner-

able because these facilities have lower
environmental criteria designs.
Structures fail in different modes
and any wells underneath the deck and
substructure usually bend at the mud
line and require complex and expensive
intervention to abandon.
Hurricanes may topple structures
completely (Fig. 1) or leave the jacket
structure standing (Fig. 2). Platform
owners often declare leaning structures
as destroyed (Fig. 3). In some cases,
they may also declare as destroyed
severely damaged structures that no
longer can carry out their function.
In all cases, destroyed platforms present a hazard to navigation and require
immediate identification as navigation
hazards.
Hurricane Gustav entered the Gulf of
Mexico on Aug. 31, 2008, as a Category 4 storm and exposed about 677

force winds, MMS requires owners, in
accordance with the API Recommended
Practice 2A-WSD, to conduct a Level I
survey (above water visual inspection)
before manning. If damage occurred,
MMS also may require additional surveys such as underwater visual inspection, close visual inspection of areas of
known or suspected damage, or underwater nondestructive testing.
Platform owners report the inspection results to MMS and indicate if platforms had no damage, incurred minor
or major damage, or were destroyed.
The MMS coordinates with the
platform owners who report on their
48

assessment on a periodic basis. The
MMS final official list reports the total
number of damaged and destroyed
platforms by category. Our analysis used
these public data.1
The number of platforms declared
destroyed usually increases over time,
but upon release of the final official list,
typically 8-12 weeks after the event,
platform owners have finished most of
their damage assessments.2 3 The data set
still may be incomplete when MMS releases the official list because a platform
owner may require additional time to
determine the economics of replacing
the structure or it may uncover addi-

tional damage to the structure overlooked in the initial inspection.
An owner also may remove a structure if a pipeline or platform that was
part of the operation scheme is no longer in service or removed from service
later.

Destroyed structures
Offshore structures have designs that
meet the environmental conditions in
which they operate. The platforms have
an extremely good day-to-day operational safety record and historically have
met an acceptable rate of failure.

storm or hurricane, however, the risks
of damage and destruction increase
dramatically because structures must
sustain wind speeds, wave forces, and
potential mudslides that in extreme circumstances may equal or exceed their
design capacity.
Old structures in particular are
vulnerable because they have designs
usually with lower environmental
criteria than current designs. A wave
crest hitting a platform deck creates
very large loads that likely will damage
and in some cases collapse a platform. A
key ingredient for a platform to survive
a hurricane is for the deck to have an
elevation above the largest hurricane
waves.
Platform owners must decommission destroyed structures for removal.
The work is challenging and needs to
be undertaken in a way that ensures no
harm to people, property, or the environment.4
Decommissioning costs of destroyed
structures often are 5-25 times more
than conventional abandonment. Likewise, risks are much greater.

Decision-making economics
If the estimated value of remaining
reserves exceeds the expected cleanup
and redevelopment cost, companies
likely will redevelop the field. The field
has little or no exploration risk, and for

a young field, higher production rates
are possible. These higher rates may
help offset the capital expenditures of
the redevelopment.
Companies likely will redevelop assets capable of producing at high rates
or having more remaining reserves because these will have better economics
than fields with low production rates or
fewer reserves. In some cases, new drilling opportunities may arise that will
improve the redevelopment economics.
A rational operator would not spend
more than the estimated value of remaining reserves to replace a destroyed
structure or repair a damaged structure.
Fields early in their lifecycle likely
will support the production rates and
reserves necessary for redevelopment.
Mature assets and small producers
are least likely to meet the economic
thresholds, and in most cases, will face
abandonment.
Companies make all decisions on a
case-by-case basis on criteria such as
cost information, reservoir formations,
redevelopment opportunities, and other
proprietary data generally unavailable in
the public domain.
The decision to repair, replace, or
decommission damaged and destroyed
infrastructure is often difficult because
of the uncertainty involved in estimates.
The return on investment that a company expects to receive depends upon

future production rates and hydrocarbon prices, as well as on the cost to
clean up and redevelop the site.
Under normal circumstances, redevelopment decisions are no different
from an initial development decision,
but in the case of destroyed or severely
damaged assets, companies need to account for additional complications and
uncertainties regarding the procedures
and costs. They have to weigh all costs
against the potential revenue generating
capability expressed through the remaining reserves, expected production
levels, and future prices.

Production classiÔ¨Åcation
One can classify offshore structures
in different ways, but using the physical aspects of the infrastructure and the
characteristics of the production stream
is the most common.
An active structure is one that produces any amount of oil or gas during
the year, while an idle structure is one
that once produced hydrocarbons but
has had no production for at least 1
year.
Auxiliary structures are structures
that never have had production and
serve in a support role such as a storage,
compression, or metering facility.
GOR is a common means for classifying reservoir fluids and field production. We classify oil-producing strucOil & Gas Journal / July 20, 2009

less than 5,000 scf/bbl. Gas structures

Shut-in production
Figs. 6a and 6b depict the shut-in oil

shut-in profile has three distinct bumps.
In 2008, Ike followed Gustav within 2
weeks.
The speed of the approaching
storm and collective operator response
determines the upward slope of the
shut-in curve. The storm‚Äôs impact on
the offshore and coastal infrastructure
determines the downward slope and
the speed at which the curves approach
the origin.
If the storm destroys much infrastructure (structures, pipelines, gas
processing facilities, and refineries),
production will remain offline and the
shut-in curve will not return to the
origin during the period sampled.
If the storm causes no damage to
offshore infrastructure or onshore gas
processing plants and refineries, then
shut-in production will approach zero
and operations will resume without loss
of production.
The term ‚Äúlost production‚Äù refers to
production associated with destroyed
structures that companies plan not to
redevelop.

and gas profiles in recent storms as a
percent of daily production at the time
of the event. Shut-in curves may have
more than one peak depending on the
timing of successive events. If a second
storm enters the gulf before operators
assess damage or restart production,
then the shut-in curve will have two
peaks.
In 2005, Katrina, Rita, and Wilma
occurred in quick succession, and the

MMS‚Äôs final tally listed 60 structures
destroyed by Hurricanes Gustav and
Ike. Of these, one-third (20) were idle,
meaning that they had no production
on them for at least 1 year before the
hurricanes. Nine structures never had
production and are auxiliary, nonproducing structures.
Companies are unlikely to redevelop
idle structures because in most cases
they have extracted all the commercial
reserves at the site and will schedule
decommissioning of these structures
when the lease stops producing.
The nine auxiliary structures served
in a nonproducing role and depending on the facility requirements and
redevelopment options, companies may
or may not reinstall them.
Fixed platforms producing gas were
the most common structure destroyed
(Table 1). About 60% of these structures
were 25 years or older (Table 2).
We classify as idle structures, the
structures without any producing wells

Table 3 presents the
average prehurricane daily
production and revenue
based on calculated production 1 year
before each hurricane and normalized
on a daily basis.
For calculating the average daily
and annual revenues, we used monthly
average oil and gas prices reported by
the Energy Information Administration
and then adjusted them based on the
consumer price index through August
2008.
We did not adjust prices for quality
differences in gravity and sulfur con-

company will likely redevelop the sizable remaining reserves.
We estimated the remaining reserves
and associated discounted gross revenue
under constant future price scenarios
and a discount rate of 10% for each asset. Production models specific to each
structure estimated remaining reserves
using a combination of forecast methods and heuristic techniques. Discount-

ed revenue calculations assumed first
revenue would occur 1 year after initial
investment.
Table 5 presents reserves as a range
based on future prices that vary from
$60 to $140/bbl. Remaining reserves
estimates show varying degrees of
sensitivity to changes in future prices
depending on the age of the asset and
nature of the production profile, but in
aggregate, the amount of variability is
unremarkable because of the assumption that after redevelopment
companies will expend no
additional capital to increase

For several assets (Structures 305, 927, 1286, 21009,

fell below the structure‚Äôs revenue threshold or economic
limit, and therefore future
production is not commercial
and depicted as zero.
It is possible that companies may
identify additional targets at these sites
or redevelop them in conjunction with
nearby fields, but such information was
unavailable for analysis.
Discounted revenues increase
significantly with changes in future
prices. The analysis aggregates remaining reserves estimates and discounted
gross revenue using three categories for

most likely.
Companies likely will decommission structures with production of
fewer than 100 boe/d, may redevelop
structures with production between
100-1,000 boe/d, and likely will redevelop structures with production of
more than 1,000 boe/d.
We selected these cutoff values from
historical data based on the redevelopment rates of previous hurricane
events.

54

At $60/bbl oil, companies may redevelop 31 millon boe and likely redevelop 201 million boe with discounted
values of $677 million and $4.0 billion
(Table 5).
At $100/bbl oil, companies may redevelop and most likely will redevelop
reserves equal to $1.1 billion and $6.7
billion, respectively.

Redevelopment potential
Redevelopment strategies available to
companies are site-specific. It is dif-

ficult or impossible to assemble many
relevant factors such as the geologic
conditions of the reservoir and drilling opportunities available, cleanup
and redevelopment cost, and strategic
decisions.
Fortunately, there are many other accessible factors with a reasonable degree
of accuracy, such as production and
drilling profiles and lease inventories.
Estimates of remaining reserves
and valuations have a larger degree of
uncertainty.

Note: Remaining reserves correspond to oil prices that range from $60/bbl to $140/bbl. Revenue computed based on the assumption that Ô¨Årst
revenue occurred 1 year after initial investment. Structures with no remaining reserves are uneconomic at the time of the assessment. Subtotal A
computed from all structures with prehurricane production less than 100 boe/d and designated as unlikely to be redeveloped. Redevelopment rates
from this class are estimated at 10-20%. Subtotal B computed from all structures with prehurricane production greater than 100 boed and less than
1,000 boe/d designated as a possible redevelopment opportunity. Only a percentage of these reserves are likely to be recaptured in the future,
estimated at 40-60%. Subtotal C computed from structures with prehurricane production greater than 1,000 boe/d and are considered highly likely
to be redeveloped. Most of these reserves are likely to be recaptured, estimated at 90% or greater.

LOW CO2 SLIP‚Äî
Conclusion

This article concludes
a two-part series that
presents experience
in 2008 with various
marketed process simulators modeling Suncor‚Äôs
Gas Processing
85-MMscfd Simonette
sour-gas plant in northwestern Alberta. This experience showed
that predicted results differed widely
from actual operating
conditions.
The
concluding
article focuses
on the actual
simulation
output comparisons and selected
parameter sensitivities. In addition, a
nontraditional contacting three-stage
static mixer design employing very
short clear liquid residence times will
be introduced.
Modeling results comparing the
addition of DEA are shown, and other
high-pressure methyldiethanolamine
(MDEA) plants exhibiting DEA contamination reviewed. A theoretical model
proposing a novel reaction method is
presented as well as a discussion of the
proprietary nature of amines.
That plant, while designed for a CO2
slip application using MDEA and operating at about 1,000 psig, was experiencing low levels of CO2 slip. The plant‚Äôs
inlet acid-gas concentrations were 2-3%
H2S and CO2 in varying proportions.
The downstream stripped acid gas from
the regenerator, subsequently flowing
to a Claus sulfur unit, created operating
problems due to the low-btu content of
the acid-gas stream.

MDEA systems investigated

Simulator comparisons
Simulation results were compared to
field data at the Simonette plant for:
‚Ä¢ CO2 slip.
‚Ä¢ Temperatures (selected absorber
and stripper trays, stripper overhead,
and boil-up).
‚Ä¢ Lean-amine loadings (stripper
performance).
‚Ä¢ Sweetened gas H2S compositions.
58

Further comparisons were made to
actual equipment heat exchanger duties; the accompanying table lists the
results from process simulator Nos. 2
through 5.
Based on the comparison of simulators used, as noted in the table, Simulator 2, Case 2d-2 appeared to provide
the closest matching field results. A
subsequent smaller study looked at the
effects of varying certain parameters
using the baseline case.
Fig. 1 shows certain parameter variance to the effects of H2S in the treated
gas, CO2 slip, and clear liquid residence
time (CLRT, discussed in Part 1). Many
other studies were performed, such as
varying the inlet temperature, leanamine temperature, amine feed tray, and
lowering amine strength. All produced
slight variations, but none of the modeled results showed great promise for
effecting changes to CO2 slip.
During the simulation work, other
solutions were experimented with to
fulfill initial speculations discussed with
Suncor.
‚Ä¢ Packed columns. The trayed column
was substituted with packing but was
not seen to yield improvements in slip.
‚Ä¢ Pumparounds with cooling, heating.
Pumparounds were tried around the
predicted column temperature bulges
both by decreasing and increasing the
stage liquid temperatures. The column
convergence proved to be difficult and
the results obtained were marginal.
‚Ä¢ Case study for a process configuration with
a three-stage crossflow absorption (mixer-settler
configuration). A static mixer was incorporated in the feed with a proportional
amount of amine diverted that showed
some favorable results. It was not determined, however, whether the configuration of a cocurrent column could
model the system.
While a two-stage countercurrent
contactor was implemented, it was not
determined whether the settings for
the ideal-real stage ratios or the tray
efficiencies corresponded to accurate
system behavior.
Based on the single static mixer
results, a system was modeled similar in

pickup). Conversations with other
researchers revealed that the particular simulator chosen for the baseline
study may inherently over predict the
amount of CO2 removal.
Fig. 3 shows the results of varying selected parameters with respect
to H2S in the outlet gas and CO2 slip,
comparing the MDEA system with
and without DEA.
What do the results of the study
tell? According to one popular process
simulator, taking out a small amount
(1.4%) of DEA shows a jump in
CO2 slip, by an order of magnitude
in some cases. Accompanying the
CO2 rejection, however, the simulator also predicts a worsening of H2S
concentration in the treated-gas outlet
stream.
The simulation seems inconclusive,
considering results from the other
process simulators that either promised adequate slip, an adequate H2S
outlet-gas specification, or both.
Are the results believable?

Operating experiences
Discussions with industry people
indicated a consensus that small
amounts of DEA in MDEA at high
pressures could cause large amounts
of CO2 pickup. A similar situation was
experienced by a northern Alberta gas
plant, initially slipping a high percentage of the feed CO2. In 1994, the
plant operated at about 500 psig inlet
pressure, processing some 25 MMscfd
feed with 3.5 mol % CO2 and 1.5 mol
% H2S. It was initially held that a small
amount of DEA added caused the slip to
decrease virtually to zero.
A second gas plant in central Alberta
has a system of two HP amine contactors operating in parallel at about 1,000
psig and flow rate of about 180 MMscfd
of 7% H2S and 5% CO2 feed. This plant,
which initially had about 10% CO2 slip,
went virtually to zero unexpectedly.
Upon analyzing the lean amine,
the plant found it had been contaminated with small amounts of DGA and
DEA thought to have come from cross
contamination when the amine system

had been topped up. (The concentration was suspiciously equivalent to a
truckload of amine.) The CO2 slip has
not improved back to the initial design
levels; in spite of replacement of lost
system amine over 11‚ÅÑ2 years, the current DEA component being about 1.6%.
While the reported operating experience from two plants alone may not
indicate DEA causing low slip operation, unofficial discussion with others
in industry seems to substantiate this
phenomenon. This led to speculation
that any DEA in the mix will absorb
most of the CO2 in addition to the H2S
at high pressures.
The small amounts of DEA in solution appear to be able to pick up a
disproportionate amount of CO2 in
the solution mix, leading to speculation that DEA may be acting as a shuttle
mechanism within the MDEA system.
Subsequent discussions with commer-

cial amine suppliers, however, failed to
reveal any proposed mechanism to account for this apparent phenomenon.

Proprietary amine blends
Many MDEA suppliers have ‚Äúdoctored‚Äù their products with specific additions of primary and secondary amines,
making them proprietary. In many
instances, lab amine testing precludes
reporting certain blends and, depending who does the testing and where
the results are from, may exclude these
specific known blended components or
else provide component data as relabeled pseudonyms.
For example, it was speculated by one
amine supplier that a component NMEA
or MMEA could have been present
but had not shown up in previous test
reports. Specific testing for that component, although mentioned possibly being
present, was not subsequently shared.

One process simulator vendor told
of having certain components available
in the simulator provided to special customers that were unavailable to general
industry, the reason being that certain
amine suppliers have developed specialized kinetic variables they are unwilling
to share.
Other process simulator vendors
have provided certain components in
their packages that are not active. For
example, it was found that Piperazine
was included in one of the available
process simulator components but was
rendered inert because the equilibrium
coefficients were not included.

DEA-MDEA model
First, the box presented in Part 1
(‚ÄúBasic MDEA/DEA reactions,‚Äù OGJ,
July 13, 2009, p. 48) is a look at the
usual published MDEA/DEA chemistry.
With MDEA in solution, the box shows

the normal mechanism for H2S pickup.
DEA as a secondary amine can indirectly insert CO2 between its N-H bond,
forming a carbamate via hydrolyzing
first into water and bicarbonate.
The carbamate formed by this
reaction is very stable, translating into
more regeneration energy required (on
average) for DEA in comparison with
MDEA, which does not form carbamates due to its trisubstituted nature.
(MDEA can only form various salts
through acid-base equilibria.)
The presence of DEA in MDEA
speeds up formation of bicarbonate,
which otherwise has to be formed by
the direct (but slow) reaction between
CO2 and H2O, forming carbonic acid.
DEA acts as a catalyst to the reaction of
MDEA with CO2.
In studying the currently accepted
mechanisms for CO2 and H2S interaction with secondary and tertiary

amines and following discussion with
industry representatives and a literature
search (partially listed3 4) for a probable
mechanism to account for Simonette‚Äôs
zero slip, attention was focused on SN2
reactions.

SN2 reactions
The SN2 reaction (also known as
bimolecular nucleophilic substitution) can occur when one of the atoms
bonded to carbon is weak or highly
polarized (i.e., making the carbon more
electrophilic), potentially rendering
this atom into a good leaving group.
As an example, the bond between
carbon-chlorine is highly polarized; the
Cl‚Äì presents as a good leaving group
because it is a stable anion in solution.
If NaOH is added into an aqueous
solution of CH3Cl, the HO‚Äì (the nucleophile) will displace the chloride
because the HO‚Äì anion is much less

needs. Part 1, presented here, describes
new deterministic and stochastic
predictive models for external pitting
corrosion in underground pipelines.
The deterministic model considers local
chemical and physical properties of soil
as well as pipeline coating to predict the
time dependence of pitting depth and
rate in a range of soils.
Researchers used this model, based
on results from a field study, to conduct
Monte Carlo simulations establishing
the probability distribution of pitting
depth and growth rate in the studied
soils and their evolution over the pipeline lifetime.
In the last stage of the study, researchers developed an empirical
Markov chain-based stochastic model
for predicting the evolution of pitting
corrosion depth and rate distributions
from the observed properties of the
soil. Part 2 (next week) will illustrate
these models using real-life case studies
involving the Monte Carlo simulated
and experimental pit depth distributions.

Fig. 5 illustrates how the shape
parameter of the fitted GEV distribution
varies with exposure times for the all
soil class.
The increase in the shape parameter
of the GEV distributions fitted to the
Monte-Carlo-simulated maximum pitdepth distributions can be associated
with the fact that, for sufficiently long
exposures, the deeper pits are the most
apt to continue growing. This causes
the maximum pit depth distribution
to skew toward large pit depths and
the tail at large depths to become more
extensive, as Fig. 5 shows. This behavior
also occurs for the micropitting regime
of aluminum alloys in tap water18 and
for line pipe steel in laboratory-simulated soil corrosion conditions.19
The simulations also revealed the
shape parameter of the maximum
pit depth distribution as different for
different soil categories and that the
higher the soil corrosivity and the
longer the exposure time, the larger
the value of the shape parameter. Other
authors previously reported this result
in a practical extreme value analysis of
steel storage tank pitting.20 Fig. 6 shows
how the type of extreme distribution
varies from one soil class to another for
a 20-year service lifetime.
The increase in the variance of the
distribution of maximum pit depths
with exposure time observed in Fig.
3 seems to be related to the sustained
growth of the deepest pits. The difference in the growth behavior of the
deepest pits with respect to the rest of
the pit population increases with the
corrosivity of the soil. This explains
why the Frechet distribution becomes
the best fit for the distribution of maximum pit depths earlier in clay soils than
in the rest of the soil categories.
In the case of the corrosion pitting
rate (as in the case for the maximum
pit depth), the Weibull, Gumbel, and
Frechet models become the best fitting distributions as the exposure time
increases. The Frechet distribution best
fits the pitting rate data for exposures
longer than 20 years in all soil environments considered in this study. The

previously explained long-term stability
of pit growth explains these results. A
further detailed discussion of this subject can be found elsewhere.16
Fig. 7, for example, shows how
the GEV distribution fit to the Monte
Carlo-simulated pitting rate distributions evolves with time for the sandy
clay loam soil class. After long-term
service times, the deepest pits in the
pipeline are the most likely to grow, but
they do so with a slightly decreasing
rate (Fig. 2). The lower rate limit is zero,
concentrating the mass of the pitting
rate distribution at the lower rate values
(left) with increased exposure time.
Concurrently, the higher growth
rates of new and short-life shallow pits,
though less numerous, contribute to
the increased importance of the upper
tail of the distribution. Therefore, the
variance of the pitting rate distribution
becomes more dependent on the less
frequent extreme growth rate of the
short-life pits. The Fr√©chet distribution
provides the best model to fit the rightskewed, leptokurtic Monte Carlo-simu-

lated distributions of long-term pitting
rate data.
Based on these results, the long-term
(‚â•25 years) the Frechet distribution
reasonably approximates pit growth
rate in the soils considered in this work,
with parameters and cumulative probability functions (CDFs) shown in Table
5 and Fig. 8, respectively.
The 80% probability bound (x80)
for the pit growth rate obtained by
the present study is lower than those
published elsewhere.9 21 22 Taking the all
soil class as an example, Table 5 shows
the value of x80 as 0.087 mm/year (3.5
mils/year). This value is four times less
than the NACE recommended 80% upper bound of 0.4 mm/year (~16 mils/
year)21 and three times less than the
maximum rate of 0.31 mm/year (~12
mils/year) proposed in ASME B31.8S
code.22
The differences between the value
of x80 for the all soil category in Table 5
and the NACE and ASME recommended
bounds for pit growth rate are easily explainable. The results of up-to-17-year

Furthermore, pm, l (ti,t), allows an
estimate of the probability distribution
of the damage rate f (v; m, ti, t) associated with the pitting corrosion process
over the interval of length Œît = t ‚Äì ti,
when the damage depth is at the m-th
state in the moment of time ti. Equation

Using Equation 10 from f (v; m, ti,

of the probability distribution of the
damage rate associated with the entire

Two transmitters added to wireless family
Two discrete-input transmitters have
been added to the family of XYR wireless
devices: The STXW 500 and the STTW 401
transmitters can convert any measurement
device with a contact-closure switch input
into a wireless input, enabling manufacturers to decrease costs and improve
efficiency by wirelessly monitoring more
processes at their plants.
The transmitters are suited for applications such as wirelessly monitoring level
switches, pump status, and system alarms.
The new devices can transmit signals
from as many as three contact switches.
The STXW 500 transmitter accepts three
discrete-digital inputs while the STTW
401 transmitter accepts a thermocouple
input and two discrete-digital inputs.
Both transmitters carry intrinsically safe
approvals for use in hazardous areas from
FM Global and the Canadian Standards
Association.
These new XYR 6000 transmitters

enable plants to convert existing measurement devices to wireless solutions without
needing to replace the equipment.
The STXW 500 and STTW 401 transmitters complement the other wireless
transmitters in the firm‚Äôs XYR 6000 product line, which includes: absolute and differential pressure transmitters, temperature
transmitters, analog transmitters, corrosion
monitoring transmitters, and gauge pressure transmitters.

Signs scrambled
on the inevitable
start of recovery
Global economic recovery has to start
sometime. Now seems like as good a time
as any.
The signs, however, are scrambled.
On July 2, the US Bureau of Labor
Statistics reported disappointing data for
June. Nonfarm payroll employment fell by
467,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate
loitered at a gruesome 9.5%.
The number of unemployed Americans

is now 14.7 million‚Äîup 7.2 million since the
start of the recession in December 2007.
The International Monetary Fund, however, sees hope, asserting on July 8 that,
‚ÄúThe world economy is stabilizing, helped
by unprecedented macroeconomic and
Ô¨Ånancial policy support.‚Äù
A contemporaneous case in point is GM.
With the help of a $50 billion commitment
from US taxpayers, the once mighty automaker was poised, as the IMF updated its
World Economic Outlook, to emerge from
bankruptcy. The turnaround came sooner
than had been expected.
But the company‚Äôs sharply diminished corpus now bears marks‚Äîsome
say scars‚Äîof that ‚Äúpolicy support‚Äù IMF
mentioned. GM will be 60.8% owned by
the US government, 11.7% by the Canadian
government, and 17.5% by the United Auto
Workers.
According to news reports, it might
change the color of its logo from blue to
green.
On the broader economy, IMF doesn‚Äôt
gush optimism.
‚ÄúThe recession is not over, and the recovery is likely to be sluggish,‚Äù it said.
In Ô¨Årst-quarter 2009, the global economy
contracted by almost as much as in fourthquarter 2008.
The IMF now expects global economic
activity to contract by 1.4% in 2009 and to
expand by 2.5% in 2010. The 2010 forecast
exceeds the outlook IMF made in April by a
not-so-whopping 0.6 percentage point.
‚ÄúThe downward drag exerted by the Ô¨Ånancial shock, the sharp fall of global trade,
and the general increase in uncertainty and
collapse of conÔ¨Ådence is gradually diminishing,‚Äù the IMF said. ‚ÄúHowever, supportive
forces are still weak.‚Äù
Among those are housing markets yet
to bottom out, Ô¨Ånancial markets still impaired, and bank balance sheets that ‚Äústill
need to be cleaned.‚Äù
To that list might be added questions
about GM‚Äôs ability to sell cars designed by
politicians and labor bosses.

CFTC undercuts crude prices
It was more than a resurgence of economic pessimism that slashed the August
contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes by $11.60/bbl through seven of eight
trading sessions to a $59.89/bbl close July 10 on the New York market, said Paul
Horsnell, a managing director and head of commodities research at Barclays Capital
in London. Market fears that a faltering global economy will further reduce demand
for oil probably couldn‚Äôt have taken the price below $65/bbl, especially against a
background of tightening crude supplies, determination of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise prices to a sustained $75/bbl, and
‚Äúbroadening fears‚Äù that inadequate investments today in exploration and development threaten potential mid-term market stability, Horsnell said.
No, what kicked a hole through the previous price bottom and dropped crude
another $5 plus change was Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Gary Gensler‚Äôs announcement that his group will consider imposing position
limits on energy commodities for speculators and will review whether swap dealers,
index traders, and exchange-traded fund managers should be exempted. ‚ÄúFaced
with somewhat imprecise statements suggesting a series of possible regulatory
actions, a strong incentive was created for market participants of all types to draw
back‚Ä¶particularly from the long side of US markets,‚Äù Horsnell said.
He warned, ‚ÄúAll traders, regardless of whether they might be classiÔ¨Åed as speculative or not, were likely to view the CFTC chairman‚Äôs statement as the renewal of
a regulatory wildcard. The most likely belief, again by all types of traders, would be
that action would likely be more damaging for holders of longs rather than shorts,
and hence an immediate reaction was to close out or scale back longs, or even to
open shorts, in response to the reappearance of concerns about the potential instability and unpredictability of the US oil regulatory regime.‚Äù
Horsnell said, ‚ÄúRegulators are rarely short-run market neutral in the implementation of their actions, and when they speak of potential actions well in advance of
specifying and implementing any regulatory changes, the scale of their involvement
in the market as an indirect but active part of price determination becomes greater.‚Äù
In London, the InterContinental Exchange‚Äôs August contract for North Sea Brent
closed at $60.52/bbl on July 10, 64¬¢ more than the price for benchmark US crude on
the New York market, which it usually trails. That price difference ‚Äúis in effect almost
a Gensler risk discount‚Äù against US crudes, Horsnell claimed, even allowing for continued tightness in Atlantic crude markets and production outages in Nigeria.
‚ÄòRegulatory McCarthyism‚Äô
The primary market risk is politicians attempting a quick and easy Ô¨Åx for complex medium and long-term Ô¨Ånancial issues. ‚ÄúQuixotically attacking a perceived but
unproved speculative problem may play very well to the galleries in the short run,
but it risks diverting policy attention from the real issues; it may increase the volatility it is supposedly trying to reduce, and it may result in the consumer paying more
in the long run. In particular, a period of regulatory McCarthyism in relation to the
operation of oil markets is unlikely, in our view, to be a good substitute for effective
domestic and international energy policies,‚Äù Horsnell said.
Gensler ‚Äúseems to hint at a potentially prolonged period of regulatory uncertainty, which is rarely a good factor to increase in any market. In particular, those
worried by the extent to which investment is falling behind that necessary to balance
the market at reasonable prices are likely to be alarmed by the additional volatility
and short-term price weakness caused by regulatory uncertainty,‚Äù Horsnell said.
Like the trickle of water down a hillside, Ô¨Ånancial markets tend to follow courses
of least resistance. If blocked in one market, traders likely will move naturally to
more favorable exchanges abroad. Therefore, Horsnell said, ‚ÄúThe ultimate price
impact of regulatory decisions‚Ä¶is likely to be very limited indeed. However, in the
short run, oil prices do now seem to have an additional determining factor, namely
market concerns about the risk of clumsy regulation and implementation.‚Äù
To prevent escapes to other markets, Sens. Maria E. Cantwell (D-Wash.) and
Olympia J. Snowe (R-Me.) asked CFTC to revoke exemption of ICE‚Äôs US crude contracts from direct US oversight.
House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank (D-Mass.) suggested
that any market reform legislation also authorize bilateral sanctions against any
country that tries to attract commodity trading business with looser regulations. It is
not clear how that would affect private exchanges competing for business in countries that simply maintain their current less-stringent regulations, however.

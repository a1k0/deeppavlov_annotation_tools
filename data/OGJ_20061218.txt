Without a cost-effective way to remove high levels of nitrogen, you’ve bypassed
would-be opportunities again and again. Now is the time to stop, go back,
tap into those reserves and start making more money.

BCCK Engineering will help you remove nitrogen from your gas streams quickly, efﬁciently and affordably.
And with nitrogen out of the picture, all that gas — and all those proﬁts — are there for the taking.
Thanks to BCCK, it’s time to get both.

For a personal consultation, call BCCK at 888-518-6459,
or for more information, go to www.bcck.com.

Woodside Petroleum Ltd. operates Chinguetti field off Mauritania.
With peak oil production capacity of 75,000 b/d, production
from the field began Feb. 24, 2006, through wells on the seabed
connected by flowlines to an FPSO. Berge Helene is a converted
tanker, permanently moored over the field, as illustrated on p. 20.
Oil stored in the FPSO is periodically offloaded to trading tankers for transport to markets in the US, Europe, and Asia. Images

refinery.This grassroots 11,000-b/sd hydrotreater will reduce
the sulfur content in diesel fuels manufactured and processed by
Countrymark to meet the regulated lower sulfur-content levels
mandated by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Mustang

Interest

Gazprom may buy half of Shell’s Sakhalin-2 stake
Royal Dutch Shell PLC, under stepped-up pressure from the
Russian government, is close to making a deal that would allow
Russia’s OAO Gazprom a stake in the Sakhalin-2 oil and natural
gas project.
Dmitry Medvedev, who serves as chairman of Gazprom chairman as well as Russia’s deputy prime minister, Dec. 12 said talks
with Shell were going quickly and that the Russian side hoped to
reach a deal soon.
Reports suggested that Shell’s share in the project would drop
from 55% to 25%, while its Japanese partners Mitsui (25%) and
Mitsubishi (20%) would each sell 10% of their shares to Gazprom.
However, it was expected that Shell would remain as operator of
the project since Gazprom has never before run an LNG project.
Medvedev did not confirm those reports, saying only, “as far as
the size of the stake is concerned, it is important but not critically
important.” He told a press conference in Moscow, “We are looking
at all options ranging from cash to an exchange of assets.” The announcement of a deal coincided with further threats by the Russian
government to undertake legal action against the Shell-led project
for alleged violations of the country’s environmental laws.
Oleg Mitvol, deputy head of natural resources watchdog
Rosprirodnadzor, Dec. 12 claimed that damages inflicted by the
operator of the Sakhalin-2 hydrocarbons project are estimated at
$10 billion, according to preliminary calculations.
Mitvol said the agency would come up with a more-precise
figure by the end of next summer, but that the estimated amount
included damage to the environment, lost revenue, and compensation for lawyers that Rosprirodnadzor would hire for litigation.
He said Rosprirodnadzor plans to start court proceedings in
March over violations at the Sakhalin-2 project, and that it would
file Sakhalin-2 suits in several court jurisdictions, including in Russia and in the Stockholm Arbitration Court.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

The announcements followed earlier pressure from the Russian
government which last week withdrew key environmental permits
from Shell and its Japanese partners. As a result of the withdrawn
permits, construction on the project has effectively come to a halt
(OGJ Online, Dec. 7, 2006). Japan’s Economy, Trade and Industry
Minister Akira Amari Dec. 12 underscored the urgency of reaching
an agreement, urging the operators of the Sakhalin-2 project to
abide by a plan to supply LNG to Japan beginning in 2008.
“It is important that the resource is properly delivered to the
final user,” such as Japanese electric power and gas companies,
Amari told a news conference in Tokyo.

Kazakhstan to decide on mineral rights
Kazakhstan’s Energy and Natural Resource Minister Baktykozha
Izmukhambetov said the Kazakh government will decide by Dec.
30 whether to seek oil and natural gas rights in that country now
held by Canada’s Nations Energy Co.
Commenting on the pending sale of Nations Energy and its Kazakh assets to China’s state-owned Citic Group, Izmukhambetov
said, “In principle, we have the right to bid for any offer, for any
deal, or stake that is being sold.”
Izmukhambetov said the Kazakh government has 45 days to
reach a decision according to the law on subsurface operations and
that the deadline for it to decide on the Citic-Nations deal expires
on Dec 30. “By Dec. 30 we should reach a decision,” he said.
At the end of October, Nations Energy said Citic would acquire
its assets in Kazakhstan in December under an agreement that includes its interests in Karazhanbas field, where Nations produces
50,000 b/d of oil equivalent and has an estimated 340 million bbl
in reserves. In early December, however, the government of Kazakhstan was reportedly planning to block the Citic-Nations agreement in order to acquire the Karazhanbas development for itself
(OGJ Online, Dec. 11, 2006). ✦

Development

Sakhalin-2 water-use licenses suspended
Russia’s Ministry of Natural Resources has suspended 12 wateruse licenses for the Sakhalin-2 oil and gas project after discovering
what it called major violations of environmental law (OGJ, Nov. 6,
2006, Newsletter). Natural Resources Minister Yuriy Trutnev said
a comprehensive inspection of the project showed that “in the
course of implementing the Sakhalin-2 project major violations of
Russian environmental law have been committed.”
As a result of the inspection, Trutnev’s ministry said it has suspended 12 licenses for water use granted to Starstroi, a RussianItalian joint venture building natural gas and oil export pipelines as
a subcontractor of the Sakhalin Energy consortium.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

The ministry said Russia’s environmental watchdog, Rosprirodnadzor, had uncovered violations of water law requirements by the
company during the laying of pipelines in the Piltun-Astokhskoye
and Lunskoye regions.
It gave the company 2 months to remove the designated violations; otherwise, it will annul the licenses, which are mandatory
for any construction affecting rivers and other water resources.
Royal Dutch Shell owns a 55% stake in Sakhalin Energy, Mitsui
25%, and Mitsubishi 20%.

strategy to invest heavily in Russian oil and gas work, said R.S. Butola, managing director of ONGC Videsh Ltd. (OVL).
OVL, the overseas subsidiary of state-owned Oil & Natural Gas
Corp., initiated discussions with OAO Rosneft and OAO Gazprom
for compiling a joint bid to buy into Sakhalin-3.
Butola’s comments came during a formal function to receive

Petrobras gets OK for FPSO in Gulf of Mexico
Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) has received approval from
the US Minerals Management Service for the conceptual subsea development plan of Cascade and Chinook oil fields in the Gulf of
Mexico.
This is the first time the agency approved a plan that includes
the deployment of a floating, production, storage, and offloading
vessel in the gulf.
Oil production from the project is scheduled to start in 2009,
since field operator Petrobras intends to use its new technologies
to allow a fast-tracked development approach.
Petrobras proposes to use six technologies, which are new to
the US gulf, including a disconnectable turret buoy allowing the
FPSO to move offsite during hurricanes and severe weather, crude
transportation via shuttle tanker, free-standing hybrid risers, subsea
electric submersible pumps, torpedo pile vertical-loaded anchors,
and polyester mooring systems.
The development plan consists of the installation and operation of a FPSO in about 8,200 ft of water. It provides for at least
two subsea wells in Cascade and one subsea well in Chinook, each
drilled to about 27,000 ft and to be tied back to the FPSO. Based on
reservoir performance, the development plan could be expanded
to include additional wells on each unit.
More detailed engineering studies will now be carried out, including the preparation of the Deepwater Operations Plan which
will include all technical details demonstrating that these technologies will meet or exceed the current requirements for operations
in the gulf.
Petrobras holds 50% and 66.67% interests respectively in the
Cascade and Chinook units. Devon Energy Corp. owns the remaining 50% of Cascade unit and Total E&P USA Inc. owns 33.33% of
Chinook unit.

E&P ﬁrms compete to drill wells in UKCS
Oil and gas exploration and production firms operating in the
UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) are planning to drill about 180 wells
in 2006-08, according to a report published by UK based North
Sea consultancy Hannon Westwood. Around $2 billion/year of investment will be required to boost production from the mature
province.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Companies will compete intensely for drilling rigs, the consultancy added, noting that there is a rig utilization rate of 93100% of Europe’s 72-rig offshore fleet. There are 143 companies
with UKCS interests, many of which are small independent North
Sea companies and listed on the Alternative Investment Market in
London. The wells are expected to add 500 million boe/year of
reserves.
A key problem for small companies is accessing finance for their
drilling operations, but this has been particularly exacerbated recently because of the growth of small companies looking for oil
and gas in the UKCS, delegates told OGJ at the Prospects Fair in
London. The event, organized by the UK government’s Department
for Trade and Industry, and the Petroleum Exploration Society of
Great Britain, which brings small companies together to seek partners in developing their prospects.
“With more opportunity than available funds over the next
few years, we can expect a wave of mergers or acquisitions among
those 80 companies who have exploration licenses but do not have
North Sea production,” said Charles Westwood, Hannon Westwood
founding partner. “Perhaps 30 of these 80 new-start companies
will survive in the long run.”
The strong competition for exploration opportunities has been
demonstrated by the record number of applications for acreage under the UK’s 24th licensing round. The results have not yet been announced although they are meant to be reported in the fall. About
141 companies have applied for licenses. DTI said the results have
been delayed because it is carrying out additional environmental checks against the applications to comply with the European
Union’s Habitat Directive.
The report added that the ownership of licenses and acreage has
dramatically changed also: “We have gone from a license system
where acreage could be held with little effective challenge for up
to 40 years, to a system where a three year lull in activity will now
place the property on the ramps for either third-party investment
or relinquishment.”
The UKCS has entered into a dynamic period “when value is
no longer measured simply by traditional production, but is also
much more a function of exploration acreage and secured drilling
activity”, the report concluded.

Stringham to the 2006 annual meeting
of the Independent Petroleum Association of America in October showed that
the association expects the total number
of wells drilled in Canada to decline 6%
in 2007. The number of conventional
gas wells drilled in western Canada is
expected to decline next year, while
the number of coalbed methane wells
in that part of the country, especially in
Alberta, is forecast to increase.
Finding and development costs
for natural gas in Canada have risen
dramatically since 1987. Stringham’s
figures showed that the 5-year rolling
average had soared to nearly $2.50/Mcf

(Can.) in the late 1980s.
Stringham predicted that in 2007
lower commodity prices and reduced
capital investment will be realities in
Canada, as drilling and land sales decline. But he said costs will continue to
rise. Globally, the cost of steel and other
materials will rise next year but will
begin to plateau.
In addition, the cost of labor will
remain tight in Canada, as demand for
workers to mine and upgrade oil sands
stays strong. CAPP projects that capital
expenditures for oil sands in 2007 will
be the one growth area, with outlays up
$1.5 billion (Can.) from this year. The
good news is that the overall decrease
in E&P activity should mean that land
and drilling costs will begin to moderate. ✦

Cynicism and corruption
The first foe in any fight against corruption
is cynicism. Corruption thrives where people
consider it part of the natural order. And where
corruption thrives, economies struggle, political
systems decay, and people suffer. Any program
to combat poverty must address corruption. Any
effort to improve political systems must address
corruption. Any oil company seeking rights to
make money developing resources must address
corruption.
Apparently, cynicism about corruption remains
high. Transparency International (TI) this month
released its annual Global Corruption Barometer,
a public opinion survey indicating that people
around the world lack confidence in anticorruption efforts by governments. According to the
barometer, conducted for TI by Gallup International, 69% of nearly 60,000 people surveyed in 62
countries believe their governments are ineffective
in fighting corruption or worse. At least some of
this failure of confidence must flow from the belief that corruption is an incorrigible part of life.

Global cynicism
The cynicism is global. Shares of respondents
calling government anticorruption efforts ineffective were 42% in Europe and 50% in North
America. What’s more, 19% of North Americans,
15% of Asians, and 23% of Latin Americans believe their governments encourage corruption. The
concern in North America and Western Europe is
about widespread corruption, the survey showed;
direct involvement in bribe-paying is lower in
those regions than in developing countries. “In
spite of the lack of day-to-day experience with
bribe-paying,” TI said, “respondents in North
America think that the business environment
(85%) and political life (89%) are affected to a
moderate or large extent by corruption.”
Changing the cynicism that fosters corruption
requires leadership.
At the World Bank, Pres. Paul D. Wolfowitz has
tried to make resistance to corruption in poor
countries a priority. Under his administration, the
bank has withheld financing of several projects
because of suspected corruption. Lately, however, the institution has undermined his effort. In
September, shareholder governments on the bank’s
development committee took over management
of the anticorruption program. Comments quoted

in the New York Times by a former World Bank
senior vice-president revealed a troubling attitude.
Saluting anticorruption efforts as “an essential
part of development finance,” the former official
nevertheless said, “The bank should not overemphasize its anticorruption agenda at the expense of
other policies required for development.” In other
words, acknowledge that corruption is a problem,
but don’t let concern about it stop the money flow.
No wonder people are cynical.
On Dec. 11, outgoing United Nations Sec. Gen.
Koffi Annan, in a speech at the Truman Presidential Museum and Library in Independence, Mo.,
described five lessons he’s learned in his decade of
UN leadership: collective responsibility, global solidarity, the rule of law, mutual accountability, and
multilateralism. He didn’t mention corruption.
Since the multibillion-dollar Oil-for-Food scandal, of course, corruption has been an especially
touchy subject at the UN. While Annan wasn’t
personally implicated in that mess, it’s hard to
imagine how lessons on the subject failed to make
his top-five lessons list. The omission relegates
corruption to the nether realms of UN concerns
and makes the Conference of States Parties of the
UN Convention Against Corruption, which was
meeting in Jordan as Annan spoke, look like a forgettable sideshow. It deserves more support than
that from the UN boss.

An example?
Annan’s speech irked some commentators
because of the backhanded scolding it gave the
US on subjects such as human rights, the use of
military force, and unilateralism in foreign affairs.
Some commentators saw a rebuke of the Bush
administration in Annan’s appeal for “far-sighted
American leadership.” Maybe. Or maybe Annan
was just recognizing US stature and the obligations that come with it. One of those obligations
must be to set a standard of zero toleration for
corruption in any form at any time. As recent scandals in Congress show, this area needs work.
With words and action, the oil and gas industry
must respond to any lapse it sees into popular or
official cynicism on corruption. Its right to work
depends greatly on economic and social benefits
associated with resource development. Corruption dissipates those benefits. It’s not inevitable. It’s
intolerable. ✦

Worldwide oil and gas reserves rose
in 2006 as oil production posted a
small increase from a year earlier, according to Oil & Gas Journal’s annual
worldwide survey of production and
reserves. Remaining oil reserves still exceed estimated cumulative production.
Reserves estimates for oil are up 2%
from the previous survey, while gas
reserves estimates are 1% greater (OGJ,
Dec. 19, 2005, p. 20).

Oil reserves in Brazil and Argentina
are higher, while gas reserves in those
countries moved lower. Collectively, oil

The Canadian reserves estimate is

The country’s conventional oil reserves are estimated at 5.2 billion bbl,
up 20% from a year ago, according to
the Canadian Association of Petroleum
Producers (CAPP). The increase is due
in large part to revisions to the three
producing projects off Newfoundland,
CAPP said.

OLOKOLA GAS SUPPLY PROJECT (OKGS)
Gas Production Platform Complexes
and Wellhead Platforms
CHEVRON NIGERIA LIMITED
(Operator of the NNPC/CNL Joint Venture)
Invitation to pre-qualify for inclusion on the bid list for the lump
sum contract covering Engineering, Procurement, Installation
(Fabrication + Offshore Installation), and Commissioning (EPIC)
of two Gas Production Complexes and five Wellhead Platforms
(NWPs) in association with the Olokola Gas Supply Facilities;
offshore Delta and Bayelsa states, Federal Republic of Nigeria.
Note: CNL will allow either single awards or a combined contract
award (GPP Complexes and/or NWPs) against this Invitation.
INTRODUCTION
Chevron Nigeria Limited (CNL), the operator of the Joint Venture between itself and the Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), intends, on behalf of the Joint Venture, to install two (2) Gas Production
Complexes comprised of a Gas Production Platform (GPP) with associated Living Quarters Platforms (LQPs),
flare tripods with interconnecting bridges and five (5) Wellhead Platforms as part of the Olokola Gas Supply
Project (OKGS) Facilities. The platforms are to be located offshore Delta and Bayelsa states in Nigeria.
The NNPC/CNL Joint Venture is committed to providing opportunities for Nigerian companies and Nigerian
labor to participate and develop their expertise in line with the Federal Government Policy on Local Content
Development and consistent with the project objectives of safety, schedule, cost and quality. Accordingly,
the NWPs (jackets and topsides), the LQP jackets, decks and LQ modules, GPP jackets, FPs, and
interconnecting bridges will all be fabricated in Nigeria. In addition, all the pressure vessels and the decks
that are on both Okan and Funiwa GPPs must be fabricated in Nigeria.

SCOPE OF WORK
Capable national engineering and construction firms and International EPCI contractors who are committed
to including local Nigerian firms in their execution strategy are hereby invited to submit pre-qualification
documentation for the OKGS GPPs, NWPs, LQPs, and FPs lump sum tender for Engineering,
Procurement, Construction and Installation (EPCI) of the following preliminary scope of work as
summarized below:
1. Okan / Funiwa Gas Production Complexes (GPPs/LQPs/FPs) - two each as described herein
• Okan GPP Platform: One (1) new 1400 MMSCFD capacity gas production platform containing gas
separation, dehydration, export gas compression, and various utilities with an integrated topsides
module weight of approximately 22,400 short tons (20,000 tonnes), in a water depth of 57 feet (17
meters). The current design philosophy is trending to a “Float Over” installation of the integrated
topsides module due to the water depth and overall weight. The facility complex also contains a remote
flare tripod platform, intermediate flare bridge tripod support platform, and two (2) bridges to connect
the remote flare to the Okan GPP (bridges are approximately 255 feet, 78 meters in length each).
• Funiwa GPP Platform: One (1) new 700 MMSCFD capacity non-associated gas production platform
containing gas separation, dehydration, export gas compression, and various utilities with an integrated
topsides module weight of approximately 18,700 short tons (17,000 tonnes), in a water depth of 57
feet (17 meters). The current design philosophy is trending to a “Float Over” installation of the
integrated topsides module due to the water depth and overall weight. The facility complex also
contains a remote flare tripod platform and one (1) bridge to connect the remote flare to the Funiwa
GPP (bridge is approximately 350 feet, 107 meters in length).
• Living Quarters Platforms (2): One for each GPP Complex consisting of new Living Quarters
Platforms each containing one (1) 87 person 1,122 short tons (1,020 tonnes) Living Quarters Module,
LQP deck, associated utility equipment and systems, and a single bridge (approx. 164 feet, 50 meters
in length) for connection to the Okan and Funiwa GPP Platforms. The lift weight of each of the LQP
deck supporting the Living Quarters Module is approximately 550 short tons (500 tonnes) with the

*Second quarter.

US-based operators
The group of oil and gas producers
and refiners based in the US recorded
a combined 20% jump in net income
for the recent quarter, and for the first
9 months of this year, their earnings
climbed 30% from the prior year (Table
1). Leading these gains were large
increases in the earnings of Anadarko
Petroleum Corp., Chevron Corp., Marathon Oil Corp., and Valero Energy Corp.
Meanwhile, 14 of the 74 companies
in this group posted a net loss for the
third quarter.
For Anadarko, the 144% quarterly
earnings gain to $1.46 billion was partially due to the inclusion of the results
of Kerr-McGee Corp. and Western Gas
Resources, beginning on their respective
Aug. 10 and Aug. 23 acquisition dates.
Downstream earnings drove Chevron’s 40% earnings increase for the
third quarter. The company reported
that its downstream earnings increased
nearly $900 million to $1.4 billion on
improved product margins and refinery
utilization. Meanwhile, upstream profits
26

of $3.5 billion were up 5% on greater
production volumes and higher oil
prices.
Solid refining and marketing margins
also were key to the Marathon and
Valero earnings increases.
Marathon’s downstream segment
income was $1 billion in the third
quarter of 2006, compared to $473
million in the third quarter of 2005.
The main driver behind this increase
was the company’s refining and wholesale marketing gross margin, which
averaged 32.7¢/gal in the recent quarter
vs. 17.7¢/gal a year earlier.
Valero’s Chief Executive Officer
Bill Klesse said, “We had the highest
third-quarter earnings in the company’s
history despite the drop in gasoline
margins that began in early August.
Throughout the third quarter, though,
distillate margins and sour crude oil
discounts were very favorable.”
Klesse said, “Gulf Coast conventional
gasoline margins averaged $12/bbl for
the quarter, and (US) Gulf Coast offroad diesel margins averaged around

$9/bbl throughout the quarter. More
importantly, Gulf Coast on-road diesel
margins averaged almost $17/bbl.”
Klesse added, “We continue to
believe that the combination of slowerthan-anticipated growth in global refining capacity, cleaner fuel specifications,
and continued demand growth should
keep the supply and demand balance
for refined products tight.”
One of the firms in the sample that
posted a net loss for the quarter is
McMoRan Exploration Co. Increased
exploration expenses and greater depreciation and amortization outweighed
higher revenues from increased production volumes and higher oil price
realizations for the company, resulting
in a loss of $18.6 million for the third
quarter vs. earnings of $7.1 million in
the comparable year-earlier period.

Service, supply companies
OGJ’s sample of service and supply
firms (Table 2) outperformed the US
operators and Canadian companies for
the third quarter. For the period the

service and suppliers collectively posted
a 77% year-on-year surge in earnings.
Offshore drilling contractor GlobalSantaFe Corp. reported net income for
the third quarter was up 97% from a
year earlier. For the first 9 months of
2006, the company reported its net
income grew 132% year-on-year.
“Reflecting the continued strength of
international offshore drilling markets,

our contract drilling segment improved
significantly on a strong second quarter
performance with record revenues and
operating income in the third quarter,” said GlobalSantaFe Pres. and Chief
Executive Officer Jon Marshall. “These
positive results were diminished by an
unusually large loss on one turnkey well
in the US Gulf of Mexico and by timing
of oil sales in the North Sea.”

GlobalSantaFe attributes its earnings improvement to higher contract
drilling revenues from increased day
rates and continued high fleet utilization. But higher labor, insurance, repair
and maintenance, and other operating
expenses compared with the same 2005
period partially offset those gains, the
company said.

increased to $130,500/rig, up 60%
from the third quarter of 2005. The
company reported average fleet utilization at 97% in the third quarter of
2006, compared with 98% in the same
period of 2005.

Canadian ﬁrms
A sample of 16 companies based in
Canada recorded a 53% gain in combined earnings for the third quarter vs.
the same quarter in 2005 (Table 3). For
the first 9 months of this year, their net
income climbed 105% year-on-year.
Despite the group’s overall gain, the
third-quarter results of six of its mem-

bers declined from the third quarter of
last year. One of these is Nexen Inc.
Earlier this year, a court of arbitration concluded that Nexen breached
an obligation with respect to Block
51 in Yemen. Nexen announced that
while the amount of damages is not yet
determined, the company reduced its
net income by $93 million to reflect its
estimate of this liability. For the recent
quarter, Nexen reported net income of
$193 million (Can.), down from $615
million (Can.) a year earlier.
Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.
(CNRL) reported the largest earnings
increase among the firms in this group.
Up 639% from a year earlier, CNRL’s

net income in the third quarter included a pretax gain of $754 million
for the unrealized risk management
activities relating to oil and gas hedges,
the company said.
CNRL’s gas production increased 1%
from the third quarter of 2005 despite
reduced gas drilling activity in the second and third quarters of this year. The
company’s third quarter 2006 crude oil
production volumes declined 4% from
a year earlier due to scheduled maintenance turnarounds in the North Sea and
sand screen issues on four production
wells at Baobab, offshore West Africa,
CNRL said. ✦

Programs aim
at gas ﬂares

C

ritics may consider the idea of
environmentally aware oil and
gas producers an oxymoron. Others
who are willing to take a closer look
quickly learn that it’s an increasingly
vital part of the business.
An example is the worldwide
emphasis on using instead of flaring
associated gas.
A leader in this effort is Global Gas
Flaring Reduction (GGFR), a partnership of government agencies and oil
companies led by the World Bank
and International Finance Corp. The
group was scheduled to hold a forum
on flaring reduction and gas utilization Dec. 13-15 in Paris.
In early November it announced
that a project in Nigeria, which
leads the world in reported flared
gas, would be the first in the African
nation to put associated gas to work
generating electricity. GGFR officials
would like to see many similar efforts.

Flaring in US
It’s hardly surprising that much
flaring involves stranded gas in developing nations. But I was surprised
when Rashad Kaldany, director of the
IFC and World Bank’s oil, gas, mining
and chemicals department in Washington, DC, said gas is still being
flared in Canada and the US. “Most
of the flaring in the US is at small
onshore wells regulated by states,” he
told me.
That led me to the Interstate Oil
& Gas Compact Commission, which
put me in touch with Lynn D. Helms,
director of the industrial commission in North Dakota’s Department of
Natural Resources.

32

“We’ve had a program since
1985, when the state legislature
passed an antiflaring law. It said that
if a producer is going to flare a well,
he has to get an exemption from
the industrial commission and still
pay royalties on the flared gas,” he
explained.
Producers flared 20% of their gas
in North Dakota before the law took
effect more than 20 years ago, he
said. Now, the level is 2-4%. “In 20
years, we reduced our gas flaring by
90%. The big reduction happened
quickly—within 2 years of the law
being passed,” said Helms.

Some exceptions
He said that for operators in North
Dakota to obtain an exemption, they
must demonstrate that they can’t
get a 10% rate of return from laying
a sales line and processing the gas.
There are provisions for emergency
situations, such as shut-downs when
a plant is closed.
Also, when a new well comes
on production, the operator is allowed to flare for 2 months while
testing.
Helms said North Dakota’s flare
rate has been around 2% until
recently, when several projects have
had nitrogen breakthrough problems.
One producer is building a $75 million plant, which should be running
by the end of January, to separate the
gas and nitrogen.
“That should give you an indication how hard our producers are
working to not flare gas,” said Helms.
Or, basically, producing with flair
instead of flares. ✦

consumers over several years, was not
the only energy element in the bill. It
also includes tax credits and provisions
covering renewable resources, energy
efficient home and building construction, photovoltaic devices, fuel cells,
coal gasification and production of
methanol and ethanol from coal, and
cellulosic biomass ethanol plants.
“I have always believed that increased
production of fossil fuels is effective
only if we also expand our production
and use of renewable energies and make
a concerted effort to use less energy,”
Domenici said. “This package achieves
all three goals. It complements last
year’s energy bill in charting a course
for this country toward a future of
clean, abundant, and affordable energy.”

Earlier compromise
S. 3711 itself was a compromise. The
Energy and Natural Resources Committee passed S. 2253 on Mar. 8 to reopen
eastern gulf tracts that President Bush
withdrew in 2001 at the request of his
brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.
But Mary L. Landrieu (D-La.) and
seven more senators from Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi objected
because it did not contain a provision
to share future revenues from the offshore leases with affected coastal states.
Florida’s two senators, Republican Mel
Martinez and Democrat Bill Nelson, also
protested that a provision barring leases
within 100 miles of the state’s coast beyond the Sale 181 area was inadequate.
Domenici withheld the bill until July
12, when Majority Leader William H.
Frist (R-Tenn.) announced that compromises had been reached with the 10
Gulf Coast senators. The Floridians won
an addition of 25 miles to the no-lease
buffer zone, which would be in effect
through 2022. The other four Gulf
Coast states won a 37.5% share of future federal leases in the area covered by
the bill, while another 12.5% would go
to the state side of the Land and Water
Conservation Fund.

strong support for Louisiana and the
entire Gulf Coast by passing the DoOil & Gas Journal / Dec. 18, 2006

menici-Landrieu fair-share bill, which
after nearly 60 years, provides for
Louisiana a significant share of oil and
gas revenues produced off our shores.
In August, 71 senators agreed to the bill
because they recognized that a dedicated stream of revenue is necessary for
Louisiana to protect itself from future
storms. [Hurricanes] Katrina and Rita
showed us what devastation can ensue
if our communities remain vulnerable,”
Landrieu said following the Senate’s
Dec. 9 vote.
Nelson said that the bill’s final passage made it “a huge day for Floridians... [who] can take comfort in the
fact that there will be no drilling off the
state’s shores. This is major protection
for our state’s $50 billion tourismdriven economy and its unique environment.”
Oil and gas and other industry
trade associations immediately hailed
S. 3711’s passage through Congress.
National Petrochemical & Refiners Association Pres. Bob Slaughter said that it
represents the best opportunity for US
energy exploration in 25 years. “Reliable supplies of affordably price natural
gas are essential to the operations of
both the refining and the petrochemical industries, and to the consumers
who rely on the essential products they
produce,” he said.

Twenty-ﬁve-year supply
“While the bill does open as much
acreage to exploration as NPRA and

others would have liked, we hope that
additional action affecting other OCS
areas will eventually take place,” Slaughter said. “Allowing full access to the
OCS could bring as much as 633 tcf to
the domestic market, enough to provide
the US with 25 years of affordable
natural gas.”
Independent Petroleum Association
of America Pres. Barry Russell said the
bill was not a solution, but a necessary
first step. “The federal government still
maintains its unnecessary moratoria on
the East and West coasts as well as the
eastern Gulf of Mexico. It’s now time
as a nation, and as the new Congress
convenes in January, to look at frontier
areas both onshore and offshore for safe
energy development,” Russell said.
American Gas Association Pres.
David N. Parker said that Congress “has
ensured that an increasing share of
domestic natural gas supplies will be
available for use by all Americans” and
said the bill is a step in the right direction. But he added that more work will
need to be done to open additional OCS
tracts.
Natural Gas Supply Association
Pres. Skip Horvath said Dec. 11 the bill
“cannot be the final answer when it
comes to ensuring access to the most
economical supplies, but it has taken
strong leadership in both parties in
both houses to achieve this initial step,
which represents the first congressional
expansion of available offshore resources in several decades.”

Horvath said, “It is vital that the
110th Congress continue to work together to ensure greater access to even
more supplies to meet the resource
needs of our country, while letting
markets allocate supplies where they are
needed most.”
National Association of Manufacturers Pres. John Engler said that the
legislative package contained several important trade provisions for his
group’s members, but immediately
cited the OCS segment. “Exploring
the OCS is an important step toward a
more abundant, flexible, and affordable
energy supply that is critical to the US
economy,” he said.
American Chemistry Council Pres.
Jack N. Gerard called the bill’s passage “an enormous victory in the fight
against a 6-year-old natural gas crisis
that’s been killing American jobs, making the United States less competitive
with other nations and costing households across the nation more for home
heating and electricity.”
He also said there’s a relationship between restricting access to gas resources
and development of energy alternatives.
“One of the biggest sources of rising
natural gas demand is for generating electricity, and more natural gas
also will be needed to produce ethanol, hydrogen, ultra-low sulfur diesel
fuel, solar panels, wind power blades,
and energy-efficient materials such as
insulation and plastics for light-weight
cars,” Gerard said. ✦

US Senate follows House, approves pipeline safety bill
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
The US Senate passed an amended
pipeline safety bill by voice vote on
Dec. 7, following House passage of the
measure on a similarly expedited basis
(OGJ Online, Dec. 7, 2006). HR 5782
now heads to the White House, where
President George W. Bush is expected to
sign it.

The bill would authorize a 50% increase in the number of federal pipeline
inspectors, give additional enforcement

Safety and states to prevent third-party
excavation damage, and federally regulate low-stress oil pipelines and local
gas distribution systems for the first
time, according to Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ), one of the main sponsors
earlier this year of the Senate’s original

pipeline safety bill.
But Lautenberg added that one of the
bill’s most significant features is its provision establishing the mandatory use
of excess flow valves, which he helped
to write. “These important safety devices can shut off gas flow when a service
line is ruptured, preventing a potential
explosion. One lesson we learned after
the 1994 gas explosion in Edison, NJ,
is that technology must be used to shut

off gas flow after a rupture,” he explained.
Lautenberg said excess flow valves
would be required in every new singlefamily residence or replacement line
to a single-family residence under HR
5782. He added that Thomas J. Barrett,
who heads the Pipeline and Hazardous
Materials Safety Administration within
the US Department of Transportation,
indicated that he intends to exempt
operators of master meter and liquefied petroleum gas systems from the
requirement, but only because excess
flow valves have been shown to be ineffective on such systems.

Passage welcomed
Oil and gas trade associations and
citizens’ groups both welcomed the
bill’s passage through Congress.
“This legislation is a significant step
in protecting natural gas distribution
pipelines from damage by third-party
excavators,” said David N. Parker, president of the American Gas Association,
which represents 200 local distribution
companies. Parker said HR 5782 contains provisions and financial incentives
to encourage states to adopt excavation
damage prevention programs containing the same elements which have been
successful in Minnesota and Virginia’s
programs.
DOT safety statistics show that the
number of serious incidents caused by
third-party excavators hitting utility
lines has more than doubled in the last
4 years, Parker said.
Lois Epstein, a senior engineer with
Cook Inletkeeper, an Alaskan citizens’
organization dedicated to protecting the
region’s watershed, human population,
and wildlife, called HR 5782 “a strong
bill that will move pipeline safety forward.”
Referring to leaks in BP Alaska’s
oil-gathering operations at Prudhoe
Bay, which eventually led to shutdowns
of several portions of the system this
past summer, Epstein added, “Ironically, BP’s corrosion problems this past
year helped federal regulators improve
pipeline safety overall.” ✦

e never imagined—never for a
minute—that Chinese officials
would react so swiftly to our comment last week about the increasing
use of biofuels and the upward pressure that puts on food costs, particularly grains (OGJ, Dec. 11, 2006, p.
32). But react they did—and very
swiftly, too.
On Dec. 12, Zhu Zhigang, China’s
vice-minister of finance, assured the
public of sufficient food supplies
amid concerns over the rising cost
of food resulting from the use of
grains like corn in the development
of biofuel.
Zhu made the comments in the
face of rising costs for grain—particularly for corn as the main raw
material for ethanol used as vehicle
fuel. Zhu said biofuel can be developed only if China’s food supplies are
guaranteed first.
Other Chinese officials chimed in
with similar remarks.

of the biofuel project and its influence on the food chain. He also said
the government would impose strict
controls on any biofuel project using
grain as the raw material.
In that regard, the Chinese might
take a leaf out of Japan’s book of
ethanol production. Instead of relying
on the food chain as a supply source
for the production of ethanol, the
Japanese are developing a sweet tooth
for ethanol produced in Brazil.

Sweet tooth

In fact, Brazil’s state-owned Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras)—in
cooperation with Japan’s Mitsui &
Co.—has concluded a deal to sell
Japan ethanol produced from sugarcane for use in electric power plants
starting in 2010.

Existing state gas-storage statutes
and regulatory frameworks should
govern future carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects, says an Interstate
Oil & Gas Compact Commission task
force leader.
Lawrence Bengal, chair of the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission and head
of IOGCC’s Carbon Capture and Geological Storage Regulatory Task Force,
told a Dec. 4-5 carbon management
workshop in The Woodlands, Tex., that
the oil industry must prepare for carbon
regulation.
Others at the event echoed the warning, which relates to concerns about
the climate effects of carbon dioxide
emissions. The workshop, sponsored
by various oil companies, is associated
with the CO2 flooding conference in
Midland, Tex.
For more than a year, the IOGCC task
force examined technical, policy, and
regulatory issues related to CO2 storage in depleted oil and gas fields, saline
formations, and coalbeds.
Protocols developed through CO2
enhanced oil recovery projects probably
will guide early CCS efforts. The main
difference will be that EOR CO2 comes
from natural sources, while future CCS
projects are expected to capture and
store CO2 from industrial sources.

Proposals
The task force issued an initial report
in 2005 and expects next year to release
recommended regulatory guidelines.
Bengal said the task force believes carbon regulations need to be flexible and
responsive to emerging CCS technologies and experience.
“It’s a certainty that one size will
not fit all projects,” he said. “The most

important element will be a positive
public presentation of the issues. CCS is
part of a solution with economic and
environmental benefits and not a waste
problem.”
Scott Anderson, Environmental
Defense energy policy specialist for the
organization’s Texas office, said carbon
management regulations are inevitable.
He said the only questions are when
and how such regulations might be
implemented and administered.
“The political context in which CO2
sequestration regulations are developed
is very important,” Anderson said, adding that transparency will be vital.
The US Department of Energy and
its National Energy Technology Laboratory provided funding for the IOGCC
task force, which included representatives from IOGCC member states and
international affiliates, state oil and gas
agencies, DOE, DOE-sponsored regional
carbon sequestration partnerships, the

Association of American State Geologists, and others.

States
Bengal said the task force plans to
propose a state-administered CCS regulatory framework under the authorities
of states wishing to participate. The US
already has more than 3,500 miles of
high-pressure CO2 pipelines.
Texas state officials have 30 years
of experience with CO2 injection for
EOR, Bengal said. Many states regulate
EOR under the Underground Injection
Control Program of the Safe Drinking
Water Act.
“States have the necessary regulatory
analogs in place to facilitate development of a comprehensive CCS regulatory framework,” Bengal said. “CO2
should be regulated as a commodity
to allow the application of oil and gas
conservation laws that will facilitate
development of storage projects.”

The task force will propose state oil
and gas regulatory agencies are the best
vehicles for implementing regulatory
CCS frameworks, he said.
In addition, the task force plans to
suggest that states administer longterm caretaker responsibility for CCS
projects. It believes regulations will
be needed to determine long-term liability and also to establish long-term
monitoring and verification to confirm that injected CO2 remains in its
intended storage place.
Experience in those areas is limited,
Bengal said.
“Given the long timeframes proposed for CO2 storage projects, innovative solutions to protect against
orphaned sites will need to be developed,” the 2005 task force report said.
“This can be accomplished through
state and provincial government administration of federally guaranteed, industry-funded abandonment programs.” ✦

specifically for microhole coiled tubing
drilling to depths as great as 5,000 ft.
Earlier DOE research had proven this
capability to only a few hundred feet,
the federal agency said.
GTI and its partners field tested this
state-of-the-art hybrid coiled tubing rig
by drilling a few inexpensive microbore wells to about 1,200-1,400 ft in
the Niobrara chalk formation along the
Kansas-Colorado border. The results far
exceeded expectations, with drilling
cost savings averaging 38%, DOE said.
It said the project’s initial success and
strong commercial follow-up also demonstrated the potential for coiled tubing
drilling of exploration and development
wells in the Lower 48 states. For the first
time, a Canadian coiled tubing drilling
company, Xtreme Coil Drilling Corp. of
Calgary, is drilling grassroots wells in
the Lower 48 for Anadarko Petroleum
Corp. Xtreme Coil is using its newly
patented coiled tubing design to drill
wells in the aging, marginally eco-

nomic, shallow oil fields of Colorado’s
Denver-Julesburg basin.
By the end of this year, said DOE,
Xtreme Coil also is expected to deploy
its coiled tubing drilling at depths as
great as 10,000-12,000 ft in deep gas
fields such as Pinedale and Jonah in
Colorado’s Green River basin for another operator, EnCana Oil & Gas (USA)
Inc.
DOE said that microhole coiled
tubing drilling technology has the
kind of game-changing potential that
could be applied to bypassed resources
in thousands of oil and gas reservoirs
across the US, particularly for shallow
reservoirs in mature or even apparently
depleted fields.
DOE estimates the volume of bypassed oil in US oil fields at less than
5,000 ft subsurface at more than 218

targeted untapped resource equates
to an amount equal to 10 years of oil

Gazprom seeks role
in US LNG market
Angel White
Associate Editor
Russia’s OAO Gazprom hopes to become a “serious player” in the US LNG
market, said Deputy Chairman Alexander Medvedev.
With the anticipated amount of LNG
to be produced in Russia after 2015, the
company can “play a substantial role in
the North American market,” Medvedev
said at a Dec. 1 press conference.
These statements follow Gazprom’s
recent decision to develop giant Shtokman gas-condensate field in the Barents
Sea without foreign partners and to
pipe the gas to Europe rather than liquefy it for North America as had been
planned. “Before the first LNG train will
begin producing LNG in Russia,” Medvedev said, “[Gazprom] will require
experience in handling LNG cargoes
from different parts of the world.”
Medvedev said, “Ownership of
infrastructure is a key to the market” in
North America, adding, “[Gazprom], as
a responsible supplier, wishes not just
to produce or to leave product somewhere in the middle between producer
and consumer but to be as close to the
consumers to meet the need of the
consumers.”
Gazprom has been applying the strategy in Europe. On Nov. 24 it launched
Gazprom Marketing & Trading France in
Paris to develop an upstream-to-downstream gas export strategy. Describing
France as “a strategic market,” the company said it intends to sell gas directly
to consumers rather than through
wholesalers. GM&T France seeks access
to transport networks and infrastructure
to deliver gas directly to endusers. Medvedev said Gazprom would acquire local
companies and set up joint ventures for
this purpose. ✦

This is the second of two parts on
the use of seismic emission tomography
(SET) to directly map reservoir permeability fields. The first part appeared last
week (OGJ, Dec. 11, 2006, p. 37).
Burlington Resources Inc., now part
of ConocoPhillips, in conjunction with
STRM LLC, has conducted a series of
field studies to test the validity of the
fluid pressure (Pf) wave geomechanical
model using SET for direct mapping of
the reservoir scale permeability field.
Two studies were done: a tight gas
sand discovery well in northern British
Columbia and a frac in the Barnett shale
in North Texas. Data for both studies
were acquired and processed by MicroSeismic Inc., Houston, with further
processing of the raw SET data and
analysis by STRM. The following criteria
were used to determine the success of
the technology.
1. Acoustic energy (AE) emission
trends should parallel known tectonic
trends of folds, faults, and jointing.
2. A change in fluid pressure at the
well should produce AE patterns consistent with known tectonic trends, e.g.,
jointing, faulting, etc.
3. The AE patterns produced by the

4. The AE emissions must be demonstrably related to crack failure.
5. It should be possible to acquire
data in a production environment.

An initial network of nine 6channel Kinemetric K2 portable

to monitor a cube with an 8x8
km map area and a 4-km depth. Each
station consisted of one 3C and three
1C Sercel geophones for a total of 54
channels for the entire network.
Three stratigraphic intervals were
monitored during the study period,
which extended over a month. The lowest two intervals were flow tests, and
the third was a frac.

The drilling industry
appears to be on the
upside of a supercycle,
keeping most rigs busy
in North America.
Both oil and gas prices
Drilling
have stopped their rapid
upward climb, but rigs
are still working. The total number of
US oil rigs is up slightly but relatively
flat over the last 5 years. The bigger
story is in the number of rigs drilling
for gas in the US, which has doubled in
only the last 3 years.
December contracts on the New York
market for US crude oil benchmarks expired Nov. 17 at the lowest closing price
in 17 months (OGJ Online, Nov. 20,
2006). In some areas, reduced natural
gas prices have caused operators to scale
back development drilling. Yet operators
are proceeding with major exploration
projects and leaving few rigs idle, on or
offshore.
Day rates in the Gulf of Mexico are
depressed only relative to other international markets; rig profitability in the
gulf has increased 223% over the last 5
years. Yet the local day rates have caused
a steady flow of rigs out of the gulf,
while overall worldwide utilization has
remained high.
Land rigs in North America are
susceptible to fluctuations in gas price,
yet rig construction and refurbishment
continues at a rapid pace, with most
new rigs anchored by term contracts.
Modest softening in gas drilling
has caused some companies to shift
assets to oil-oriented regions such as
the Permian basin and California’s San
Joaquin basin.

Outlook
Marshall Adkins, managing director of Raymond James & Assoc. expects
the global drilling market to be “pretty
healthy” for the next 5 years,” and said
that the US land fleet will continue
to grow at 10-12% (net) for “at least
the next year, and probably the next 3
years.”1
Richard Mason uses three indicators
(drilling permits, trailing 6-month oil

O D U C T I O N

prices, trailing 12-month gas prices)
to forecast US drilling activity 60, 180,
and 270 days out, for The Land Rig
Newsletter’s “drilling activity oscillator.” He was unusually pessimistic in
October, publishing the most negative
report yet. Based on his indicators, he DRILLING MARKET
forecast reduced drilling over the next
2, 6, and 9 months.
The last few times Mason came close
to issuing such a negative prognosis
were in July 2003 and July 2002, when
he forecast 60-day drilling outlook
down and 180-day and 270-day outlooks flat.
In the October 2006 issue, however, Mason reasoned that some of the
indicators might be unreliable, and
said the latest forecast might be a “false
negative.”

Mason observed in his recent newsletter that operators are “pushing hard
for rollbacks in rig rates, typically by
threatening to let rigs go.” But he also
noted that a lot of E&P firms are still
looking for rigs, and to give one up voluntarily means risking delay in getting
a replacement. “Demand for drilling
services has risen in tandem with commodity prices.”1

Gulf of Mexico
The offshore fleet working in the
Gulf of Mexico is about 112 rigs: 70
jack ups, 29 semisubmersibles, and 6
drillships. Overall utilization at the end
of November was about 80%, according
to ODS-Petrodata Group. Although the
drillships were 100% engaged and the
semisubs 94.5%, only 73% of the jack
ups were working.
The Rowan Paris jack up is the latest
rig to leave the gulf, after finishing a
$160,000/day contract. It will spend
31⁄2 months in a Qatar shipyard before
starting a 2-year contract with Maersk
Oil at $190,000/day.
GlobalSantaFe Corp.’s monthly summary of current offshore rig economics
(SCORE) was about 111 for the Gulf
of Mexico in October, down nearly 6%
from the previous month but up 16%
from a year earlier and up 223% from 5
years earlier.
Regionally, the gulf has the lowest
SCORE for any of the regions tracked
worldwide, suggesting that prices are
locally depressed for jack ups and floaters.
This is borne out by a continuing exodus
of rigs from the gulf into other areas.

Service rigs
The Weatherford-AESC well-service
rig count increased to 2,440 rigs for
October 2006, up 2.5% (60 rigs) from
the previous month and up 5% from a
year earlier. Rig utilization was at 74%.

From Ottawa on Oct. 31, Canada’s
Harper government announced plans to
end the tax-free status of trusts in 2011,
raising the possibility that the E&P
industry would be affected by the flight
of capital from energy trusts. Dow Jones
reported on Nov. 2 that six of top 10
funds on the Toronto Stock Exchange
were Calgary-based oil and gas trusts
and all had dropped in value.3
“It’s going to be harder for larger
companies to take their mature properties and sell those to energy trusts, then
take the cash for that and go do exploration,” said Bill Schulz, at Calgary’s
Haskayne School of Business.3
In response to the government’s action, 40 different energy trusts formed
the Coalition of Energy Trusts, which
claims that the sector plays a “vital role
in developing lower production fields
that are avoided by larger oil and gas
companies.” The Coalition said the

Husky’s partners at North Ben Nevis
are ExxonMobil, Petro-Canada, Norsk

In West Newfoundland, NWest Energy Inc. bid $550,008 on two parcels

Mexico
Baker Hughes reported that 82 rigs
were drilling in Mexico in October
2006, including 58 land rigs and 24
offshore rigs. This is 11% fewer rigs
than a year earlier, when 92 rigs (62
land; 30 offshore) were drilling in
Mexico. Most (48) of the rigs were
drilling for oil in October 2006; 31
were drilling for gas, and 3 others were
listed as having “miscellaneous” objectives. ✦

O C E S S I N G
The worldwide refining industry
added a slight amount of crude distillation capacity in 2006. For the fifth
year in a row, worldwide capacity is at
a record high. The number of refineries
remained relatively stable.
Last year’s refining report showed
a worldwide capacity of slightly more
than 85.1 million b/cd in 662 refineries as of Jan. 1, 2006. This year, OGJ’s
survey reflects a total
capacity of nearly 85.2
million b/cd in 658 refineries, an increase of
less than 52,000 b/cd.
The increase is the
smallest net gain in
refining capacity since
2001, when refining capacity decreased.
Fig. 1 shows the trend in operable
refineries and worldwide capacity. The
large jump in number of refineries in
1999 was due to improved information
from China.
Capacity creep was the main reason
for the increases in capacity for the latest survey.
Asia-Pacific showed the largest increase in refining capacity, up 105,000

in capacity. Africa, Western Europe, and
South America all lost capacity according to the latest survey numbers,
decreasing 18,250 b/cd, 81,500 b/cd,
and 8,000 b/cd, respectively.
This year’s survey lists four fewer
refineries than last year’s survey due to
corrections and reflections of refineries
that had shut down in previous years.

New crude capacity
This year’s survey does not list any
new refineries. All the increases in
refining capacity occurred at existing
facilities.
The largest single-facility increase
occurred in Formosa Petrochemical
Co.’s Mailiao, Taiwan, refinery, which
increased capacity by 70,000 b/cd, to
520,000 b/cd from 450,000 b/cd.
In the US, the largest reported
capacity increase occurred in Western
Refining Inc.’s El Paso refinery. Western reported a 27,000-b/cd increase,
growing to 117,000 b/cd in this year’s
survey from 90,000 b/cd reported in
last year’s survey.
Other major increases in reported
capacity occurred in Grupa Lotos SA’s

North America, Eastern Europe, and
the Middle East showed smaller changes, increasing 27,000 b/cd, 28,000
b/cd, and 4,300 b/cd, respectively.
US capacity increased more than
146,000 b/cd.

Reﬁnery closures, delistings
Few refinery closures occurred
throughout the world in 2006, mainly
due to high refining margins that made
even the smallest plants profitable.
The only closure reported in this
year’s survey is the 2,000 b/cd Norilsk,
Russia, refinery. Two other refineries
were removed from this year’s survey.
Petro-Canada’s Mississauga, Ont.,
plant was removed because it feeds no
raw crude and produces only lube oil
and greases. Removal from the survey,
therefore, has no effect on overall crude
distillation capacity.

ConocoPhillips, on the other hand,
added sufficient capacity to become
the fifth largest refiner in the world,
up from eighth largest last year. The
deal was completed too late in 2005 to
include it in last year’s survey.
On Feb. 28, 2006, ConocoPhillips
announced that it had completed a
deal, announced in November 2005, to
purchase the Wilhelmshaven, Germany,

capacity. The company fell to seventh
largest global refiner.
Lyondell’s acquisition allowed it to
meet the minimum 200,000-b/cd requirement for inclusion in Table 2. It is
the fourteenth largest refiner in the US.
On Nov. 23, 2005, Aramco Overseas
Co., a subsidiary of Saudi Aramco, and
Motor Oil Holdings SA, announced
that Motor Oil had completed the
acquisition of remaining interest in
the 100,000-b/cd Corinth refinery
in Greece. Previously, the refinery was
owned 50/50 by the two companies.
For the year, Saudi Aramco decreased
refining capacity by 48,000 b/cd.
Pemex also decreased refining capacity in 2006. Last year’s survey indicated
the company had 1.85 million b/cd of
refining capacity, which fell to 1.7 million b/cd in 2006. The loss, however,
was not enough to move it in Table 1 in
relation to other companies.
One deal that was not included in
Table 1 last year was Total AS’s trading of
refining capacity with Royal Dutch Shell
PLC. On July 12, 2005, Total acquired
Shell’s 20% stake in the 89,000-b/cd
Raffineria di Roma in return for Total’s
18% interest in the 79,800-b/cd Compagnie Rhénane de Raffinage refinery in
France.
Table 2 shows this change—both
refiners have ownership stakes in fewer
refineries this year.
Newcomers to Table 2 this year
include Lyondell in the US and Ineos
in Western Europe, both due to deals
previously mentioned.
In other deals, Petroleo Brasiliero SA
acquired a 50% interest in the 100,000b/cd Pasadena Refinery System Inc. The
refinery was previously 100% owned
by Astra Oil Trading NV. Petrobras paid
$370 million in the deal.
Petroplus announced on June 1,
2006, that it acquired the Belgian Refining Corp. including the 115,000-b/cd
refinery in Antwerp. The acquisition
increases Petroplus’s total refining capacity to 300,000 b/cd.
The company also announced that
it intends to buy ExxonMobil’s Ingolstadt, Germany, refinery. The deal for

As demand for hydrocarbons continues to rise, it becomes increasingly
important not only that new sources of
supply are found and developed, but

also that the resulting production can

efficient
manner.
Transportation
solutions
are often
integrated
into the overall development plan for
a new field and have direct bearing on
the feasibility of developing otherwise
marginal resources. Failure to effectively
address transportation issues can lead to
bottlenecks in development of projects otherwise deemed economically
feasible (witness current efforts to move
Arctic natural gas south from Alaska
and Canada’s Mackenzie Valley).
As a more than 20-year veteran of
the oil and gas industry and current
president, pipelines of TransCanada,
Russ Girling holds a front-row seat
on such issues, overseeing a 41,000km pipeline network that transports
the majority of Western Canada’s
natural gas production to Canadian
and US markets. Previous experience
as TransCanada’s executive vice-president, corporate development, and
chief financial officer speak to his
knowledge of industry finances, risk
management, and project evaluation,
among other areas for which he has
had overall responsibility at TransCanada.

“I think one need only
look at the Mackenzie
Valley to see the impact
of the regulatory process
if it’s not deﬁned as well
as it is under the Northern Pipeline Act.”
—Russell K. Girling,
president, pipelines,

With an in-service target of late
2008-early 2009, the project is currently going through regulatory
approval, part of which addresses a

Keystone
Known primarily as a transporter
of natural gas, TransCanada’s largest
and highest-profile current project,
the Keystone Oil Pipeline, will carry
435,000 b/d of oil-sands crude
1,830 miles from Alberta to the US
Midwest (Fig. 1).

request by TransCanada to transfer 530
miles of Canadian line from gas to oil
service. With 1,070 miles of the line
to be built in the US, the 530-mile
converted stretch represents the bulk of
the Canadian portion, making approval
of the service transfer key to the overall
project.
The National Energy Board public
hearing considering TransCanada’s Section 74 application to transfer a portion
of its Canadian Mainline natural gas
transmission facilities to the Keystone
Oil Pipeline Project for the purposes of
transporting crude oil took place Oct.
23., with Girling expecting a decision
by late first-quarter 2007.
TransCanada’s Section 52 full-facilities application for Keystone has yet to
be heard, but the Section 74 application
is the key, he says. “Once we know that,
the rest of the facilities application will
be more akin to what we’ve done in
the past, and we’re really comfortable
with that process, so we’d become a lot
more comfortable with the spending of
capital” to meet the in-service target,
he says. Even without full approval of
Section 52, “we’ll start spending money
in larger amounts post the Section 74
decision.”
Little debate surrounds the need for
the additional crude capacity. Instead,
concerns regarding TransCanada’s transfer request center on its potential effects
on the existing gas infrastructure. According to Girling, such concerns are
unwarranted; the capacity that would
be transferred represents a long-term
excess in the Canadian system.
Forecasts in the 1990s which showed
continued growth in Canadian natural
gas supply prompted approval of the
1.5-bcfd Alliance Pipeline. When Alliance came on in late 2000, Girling says

it removed 1.5 bcfd from TransCanada’s
system. This capacity has yet to be replaced, even while in-Alberta consumption has grown, and TransCanada now
has between 1.5 and 2 bcfd of spare
capacity that the company forecasts will
not be called on again.
But others wonder what will happen
if coalseam gas is larger than currently
forecast, or traditional supplies increase
faster than is currently forecast. They
also wonder what will happen when
Mackenzie and Alaskan gas is brought
online.
Girling says TransCanada has run several scenarios including each of these
variables as well as the possibility that
Fort McMurray oil sands operations will
become less gas-intensive as technology
advances, and all have concluded that
the capacity will not be needed for gas
transport.
Even TransCanada scenarios involving mid-winter peak days indicate that
the capacity will not be needed for gas
service again. Others disagree, insisting that the capacity will be needed
for short increments in the middle of
winter. The industry is divided, with
CNRL, Conoco, and Suncor agreeing
with TransCanada’s figures, while EnCana and Devon foresee the possibility
that the capacity will be needed at some
point.
Opponents have also raised concerns
regarding the fuel-based costs of the
increased compression that would be
required to move the same quantity of
gas through a smaller system. Girling
says TransCanada forecasts a negative net
present value to gas shippers of about
$100 million over a 10 to 15-year period for incremental fuel costs.
This would be balanced, however, by
removal of rate-based costs associated
with the line of roughly $110 million.
These forecasts are based on underlying
TransCanada forecasts of gas prices and
throughput, with those who disagree
with these figures using different underlying price and throughput bases.
Girling believes the NEB will end up
adjudicating the issue in the end. He
also believes, however, that the transfer

responsibility for the company’s regulated businesses, including natural gas and oil pipelines in Canada, the US, and Mexico.
Employment
Prior to his current post, Girling was executive vice-president, corporate development and chief ﬁnancial ofﬁcer of TransCanada. He had overall responsibility for ﬁnance,
accounting, treasury, taxation, risk management, corporate strategy, corporate development, investor relations, and project evaluation. Girling was responsible for TransCanada’s
$4 billion debt reduction and balance sheet restructuring during 2000.
Through 2001, he was also president of TransCanada Gas Services and was responsible for its ultimate disposition. He earlier served as executive vice-president, power,
where he had overall responsibility for the creation and management of subsidiary TransCanada Power. Prior to joining TransCanada in 1994, Girling held marketing and management positions at Suncor Inc., Northridge Petroleum Marketing, and Dome Petroleum.
Education

proposal serves the greater public interest.
Even those who oppose the change
would admit that “at best we’re going to need this capacity a few days a
year. Our view is that the greater public
interest is served by using it every day
as a crude oil pipeline, especially with
the constraint we see in terms of crude
oil capacity requirements in the 200809 timeframe, when the industry could
face apportionment,” Girling says.
“If you take a look at the detrimental
impact of not having this pipeline in
place at that particular point in time,
compared to any kind of scenario you
can run on costs on the gas side, the
benefit far outweighs the cost,” Girling
says. The National Energy Board’s mandate is to look at the broader public interest; TransCanada’s argues that interest
is better served by using this pipeline as
a crude oil pipeline. “The benefits are
substantial.”
TransCanada is also considering extending the Keystone project to Cushing
and has been gauging consumer interest both in Cushing and on the US Gulf
Coast before holding an open season.
Potential customers have responded
favorably, but only the open season will

show if there is commercial interest in
the system beyond the current PatokaWood River, Ill. terminus.

Not alone
Given the continued upswing in activity in Alberta’s oil sands, other companies are also eager to participate in
bringing future production to market.
Between these competing proposals and
Arctic gas projects such as the TransAlaska Gas Pipeline and Mackenzie Valley Pipeline, concern has emerged over
the availability of material and human
resources needed complete them all.
Girling expects that market forces
will act effectively to stage the projects,
rather than allowing each to proceed
independently. He sees the first stage
of Enbridge Energy’s Southern Access program and Keystone as the first
two projects to advance, both having
secured commercial underpinning and
now able to begin securing pipe and
labor.
“The further you move away from
Fort McMurray and Alberta, the easier
[finding labor] gets,” Girling says.
“You’re still competing for steel and we
need to make certain decisions around
steel. But what we have is a commercial underpinning that says our project

should go, assuming we get regulatory
approval.”
Girling expects that similar market
forces will guide the direction of resources to other projects further down
the road but is hesitant to speculate
regarding the sorts of constraints that
might be encountered by future projects or the viability of any particular
pipeline plan. He describes the securing
of long-term commitments from shippers, which TransCanada secured for
Keystone in early 2006, as the most difficult part of any large pipeline project
and the key to each of them.
Beyond these two projects, there
is “going to be need; no question,”
Girling says. “If the NEB curves are
correct, and we would concur generally
with those, we’ll need another pipeline
or expansion, probably a couple years
out from ours. What is less clear, according to Girling is the route – south,
west, or a different direction altogether
– that the next pipeline will follow, and
how much of the capital involved in
66

building it will actually get spent in Ft.
McMurray.
“The market isn’t making those
commitments,” Girling continues. “The
market has committed to the first part
of Southern Access and to our pipeline.”
The next expansion associated with
Round 1 would be associated with the
Cushing or Gulf Coast extensions, and
“right now we’re still testing whether
people are willing to underpin that or
not. They’re all still working on their
internal plans on how they’re going to
spend their capital and whether they
need that crude to show up and when
they need it to show up.”

TAGP
As the state of Alaska continues
negotiations with ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, and BP to establish the terms
dictating the southward movement of
North Slope natural gas, TransCanada
remains on the sidelines as a very interested observer. “We’ve stepped away
from our rights [in Alaska] and said

whoever’s going to build this project,
we’ll grant our rights to them in order
to expedite the project,” Girling says.
“We just want to make sure, once we
hit the Canadian border, that our historic rights are recognized in whatever
negotiated arrangement we come up
with to move that gas further downstream.”
The historic rights to which Girling
refers are part of 1985’s Northern
Pipeline Act, which TransCanada sees as
giving it rights-of-first-refusal regarding any plans to move Alaskan natural
gas through Canada.
“I think one need only look at the
Mackenzie Valley to see the impact of
the regulatory process if it’s not defined
as well as it is under the Northern
Pipeline Act,” Girling says. “It’s mired in
the joint-review panel process,” which
incorporates thousands of agencies that
have to “opine, grant permits, and approve the project.
“There already was a hearing before
the NEB, 30 years ago, and they granted

the certificates to TransCanada to build
this pipeline,” Girling continues. “We’ve
been saying that for a number of years,
and people say that there could be an
alternate way of doing this.”
“And maybe there could be, but our
view is that you’d have to change the
law to do it. But even if you were to
change the law, our question would be
why you would do that and put yourself just in the position that Mackenzie’s
in right now.”
In addition to its regulatory footing,
Girling cites TransCanada’s experience
in both building and operating Arctic
and near-Arctic transportation systems
as factors which give it an advantage in
the TAGP project, pointing in particular
to TransCanada’s rights-of-way from the
Alaskan border through the Yukon and

its already-established Alberta system.
“Once you bring the gas from Alaska
to Alberta, rather than having to build
from Alberta to a market, dropping all
that gas off in one market and spending that capital, you can integrate with
TransCanada’s system and the ultimate
outcome will be something that’s far
less expensive than [building] downstream,” Girling says.

Looking forward
Looking beyond the current projects
at the health of the energy industry in
general, Girling remains skeptical of
those who project a linear pattern of
demand growth based on the current
rapid expansions of economies such
as China’s and India’s, noting that any
sort of economic disruption will lead

rapidly to a reduction in demand and
with it, price.
“Production comes on in chunks,
usually,” Girling says, remarking that
price will continue to impact field development in both gas and oil and that
a low gas price in North America for an
extended period will impact producers’
willingness to commit capital to moving Arctic gas to market.
Girling sees similar forces at work
regarding new facilities in the oil sands.
“I’ve been in this business for more
than 20 years,” he says, “and I’ve seen
the predictions of $100 oil and I’ve
seen oil at $10. I don’t think we’re going back to $10. But price volatility still
exists [and affects production] decisions
for both conventional and nonconventional supplies.” ✦

Congress seethes
about the wrong
OCS money issue
Congress is coming unhinged about
federal revenue from offshore oil and gas
activity.
A new Department of the Interior inspector general’s (IG) report has invigorated
congressional suspicion about royalty
management by the Minerals Management
Service.
The suspicion arose last January with
disclosure that price thresholds designed to

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

limit deepwater royalty relief were missing from Outer Continental Shelf leases
awarded in 1998 and 1999. The new IG
report criticized MMS procedures; MMS
responded with a see-there announcement
that it was billing BP for $32 million in underpayment of coalbed methane royalties,
which had been under dispute (OGJ Online,
Dec. 8, 2006).
Democrats assuming power next year
aren’t likely to ease the pressure. If they
want a scandal, though, they’ll be looking
in the wrong place.
The IG report didn’t say MMS let OCS
royalties go unpaid; it cited procedures that
might let that happen. The ﬁnding wouldn’t
have made news if Congress weren’t
already feverish over those missing price
thresholds, which might not be the lapses
they’re made out to be. Whether MMS had
authority to impose price limits in deepwater leases issued during 1996-2000 is an
open question (OGJ, Dec. 4, 2006, p. 17).
Still, lawmakers from both parties are
crusading for the supposedly lost royalty
money. They say the missing thresholds
have cost the Treasury $2 billion and estimate eventual losses at $10 billion. Their
estimates ignore revenues that wouldn’t
exist from the leases in question without
the incentive: bonus bids already paid and
royalties payable when production exceeds
volumetric thresholds.
If Congress really cared about government OCS receipts it would lease more of
the OCS.
At present, 85% of federal water off the
Lower 48 and 3% off Alaska is unavailable
for oil and gas leasing.
In the single ﬁscal year that ended Sept.
30, the government collected $7.6 billion
from royalties, rents, and bonuses from the
small part of the OCS that can be leased.
Someone do the math.
The US surely has a problem where
OCS revenue is concerned. But it has little
to do with royalty collection and much to
do with outrageously stingy leasing.

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

Storage uncertainties undercut gas prices
The January natural gas contract registered the lowest closing price in 10 weeks
on the New York futures market after the Energy Information Administration reported
the withdrawal of 11 bcf of gas from underground storage in the week ended Dec. 1.
The contract ﬁnished at $7.67/MMbtu Dec. 7, down 5.6¢ after trading at $7.58-7.82/
MMbtu that session on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The withdrawal was less than expected by Wall Street analysts and left storage
in excess of 3.4 tcf. “US natural gas withdrawal rates look modest so far, but the key
period for withdrawals is yet to come,” said analysts at Barclays Capital Inc., London.
Meanwhile, large withdrawals of gas from storage due to an abnormally cold
spell during the same period in 2005 “may lead to a possible increase in the yearover-year natural gas storage surplus over the next few weeks,” said J. Marshall
Adkins in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc. “Despite this
small hiccup, we still believe we will be an average of approximately 5 bcfd tighter
throughout the withdrawal season.”
That’s based on Raymond James’s estimates that gas supplies will be tighter by
250 MMcfd this season, while demand will be higher by 4.5 bcfd due to “the combined effect of a 1.75% year-over-year increase” in industrial demand. “Finally, we
are forecasting a normal winter (as it relates to weather), which should translate into
running about 2 bcfd tighter for the duration of the winter season. Based on these
assumptions, we believe that the natural gas overhang experienced throughout the
injection season will dissipate and winter storage levels should be in the range of
1.2-1.3 tcf, more in line with historical averages,” Adkins said. As a result, he said,
“We remain comfortable with our 2007 gas price forecast of $10[/MMbtu].”
OPEC production
After falling for three sessions, the January contract for benchmark US light,
sweet crudes increased 30¢ to $62.49/bbl Dec. 7 on NYMEX when tanker-tracer Oil
Movements reported the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries apparently
had reduced production by 800,000 b/d.
That was still short of the 1.2 million b/d cut that OPEC members agreed to in October, effective Nov. 1, but up from the 550,000 b/d reduction previously estimated.
By Dec. 8, the price was down again, to $62.03/bbl. Some observers expected crude
prices to escalate on a “risk premium” preceding the Dec. 14 OPEC meeting in Nigeria, “as well as the increased risk that Nigerian rebels use the occasion to embarrass the hosting government,” said Olivier Jakob, managing director of Petromatrix
GMBH, Zug, Switzerland. Meanwhile, a second production cut proposed by some
OPEC members was already being priced in, he said. Any additional cut would “need
to be higher than 500,000 b/d to be a surprise,” Jakob said.
Raymond James analysts in Houston said, “OPEC seems determined to defend
and maintain oil prices above $60/bbl.”
In a Dec. 6 report, Barclays Capital’s Paul Horsnell said: “OPEC’s next decision has
been complicated because of exchange rate effects and because all the tightening to
date has happened in oil products. We would not expect ministers to want to lessen
the pressure on the supply side of the crude oil market. The overhang in US oil product inventories above their 5-year average has now completely disappeared.”
Import outlook
EIA expects US imports of energy to grow moderately as a share of total demand
during the next 25 years as rising prices spur domestic production of crude and
reduce demand growth. It projects imports will rise to 32% of total US energy consumption in 2030 from 30% in 2005.
US demand for liquid fuels and other petroleum products is expected to escalate
to 26.9 million b/d in 2030 from 20.7 million b/d in 2005, while domestic liquids production is projected to increase to 10.5 million b/d from 8.3 million b/d through expansion and improvement in reﬁning capacity. EIA predicts US crude production will
increase to 5.9 million b/d in 2017 from 5.2 million b/d in 2005, with output expected
to decline after 2017 to 5.4 million b/d in 2030. The additional US oil is expected to be
produced primarily from the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico, said EIA ofﬁcials.
US imports of natural gas are projected to grow to 26 tcf/year by 2030 from 22
tcf/year in 2005, with increased LNG imports compensating for an expected decline
in Canadian supplies. Because of permitting problems, a new pipeline to transport
Alaskan gas to the Lower 48 likely will not come on line before 2018, almost 3 years
later than previously expected, said EIA ofﬁcials.

REVIEWING
THE OIL ISSUE
IN DEPTH
AND BRINGING
NEW SOLUTIONS
TO THE SURFACE
Total has been an innovator in oil exploration for forty years.
Today, we are drilling to ever greater depths in response to
an urgent need to access new energy resources. We have
also been preparing the way for the future of solar energy
since the 1980s. Through our active involvement in the
development of photovoltaic systems, Total is already
equipping populations far from electricity networks.

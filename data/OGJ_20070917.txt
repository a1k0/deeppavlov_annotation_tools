AT BALON, VALVE SAFETY IS
NO ACCIDENT.

WE DO IT BY DESIGN.
Really. Not a single injury caused by a Balon valve in over 40 years.
Now, that’s a rewarding achievement, but it’s not that surprising. At Balon, we do it by design. We design our valves
to be safe – even in extreme conditions. Moreover, our valves are made exclusively in America using only high quality
domestic materials. The pride our people take in their work is reﬂected in our products.
At Balon, we’ve established a reputation for delivering ball, check and needle valves that have not only proven their
excellence; they’ve become the standard by which all others are judged – for dependability, endurance and safety.
Want to know more about Balon valves? Give us a call and you’ll be greeted by a knowledgeable professional rather
than an automated voice-mail system. Or, if you prefer, check out our website. We’ll show you what’s behind the valve
safety our customers have relied on for 40+ years. And why it’s no accident.

Venezuela state oil ﬁrms to pay ‘back taxes’
Venezuela’s tax authority Seniat has received or been promised
payments from two state-dominated joint venture firms after imposing large back-tax bills on recently nationalized heavy oil development projects in the country’s Orinoco belt.
In a statement, Seniat said Ameriven paid some $400 million
in back taxes from September 2001-December 2004, while Petrozuata agreed to pay $172 million for 1996-2006. The statement
also said Cerro Negro was billed for $46 million in back taxes from
2001-04.
Petrozuata, now known as Petro Anzoategui, is 100% owned by
state-run Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which also owns 70%
of Ameriven, renamed Petro Piar in July. PDVSA controls 83.4% of
Cerro Negro, now known as Petro Monagas.
The announcement, which comes after the state’s recent takeover of majority control of Venezuela’s energy projects, likely will
be interpreted as a setback for ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil
Corp., which have been seeking compensation for the loss of their
operations in the country.
When PDVSA started its takeovers, several international oil companies—among them BP PLC, Chevron Corp., Statoil ASA, and Total
SA—came to terms over their continued minority involvement in
the projects.
ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil, however, failed to agree to
handover terms that would have granted PDVSA at least a 60%
stake in their projects. Failing any agreement, PDVSA appropriated
ConocoPhillips’s 30% share and ExxonMobil’s 42%.

waxy residue, and low-sulfur crude.
The 8.2 Gw Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant is expected to remain
closed through at least next March and might require at least a
further year to return to full operation.

Firm applies for nuclear plant in Alberta
A privately held Canadian power generator has taken the first
step toward construction of a nuclear power plant in the heart of
Alberta’s oil sands region.
Energy Alberta Corp., Calgary, filed an application for a license
to prepare a site on private land adjacent to Lac Cardinal, 30 km
west of Peace River.
The application is for as many as two, twin-unit Canadian deuterium uranium (CANDU) reactors. The first unit ultimately would
have capacity of a net 2.2 Gw of electricity. Energy Alberta envisions a start-up date in early 2017.
Canada has seven commercial nuclear power plants, none of
them in Alberta. They are in Ontario, New Brunswick, and Quebec.
Nuclear power has been examined as a way to meet the large
energy needs of oil sands production, which now rely heavily on
natural gas, while lowering the air emissions associated with hydrocarbon combustion.
But the nuclear option has strong environmental resistance.
Energy Alberta said its application to the Canadian Nuclear
Safety Commission represents “the first of many steps in getting
licenses to build the plant.”

Nuke plant shutdown strains Asian markets

Nigeria to launch national energy council

The July shutdown of Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s KashiwazakiKariwa nuclear power plant will strain Asian LNG and oil markets.
Tomoko Hosoe, senior consultant at Facts Global Energy, Honolulu, said Tokyo Electric will have to buy 1.3 million tonnes more
LNG than it planned in its current fiscal year and 87,900 b/d more
fuel oil and crude for direct burning because of the shutdown.
The plant has been idle since June 26 because of an earthquake
(OGJ, Aug. 6, 2007, p. 76).
Tokyo Electric now expects to need 18.8 million tonnes of LNG
in fiscal 2007, compared with actual consumption of 16.8 million
tonnes in 2006. It will need 180,900 b/d of fuel oil and crude vs.
69,600 b/d last year.
In a report, Hosoe described how Tokyo Electric’s increased fuel
requirements will affect Asian markets.
“An additional 2-3 million tonnes of LNG, which need to be secured from the spot market in 2007-08 in a very tight LNG market,
is a serious problem,” she said.
Tokyo Electric’s increased oil demand, she added, will have “a
dramatic impact” on prices of low-sulfur heavy fuel oil, low-sulfur

Nigeria is to establish a new National Council on Energy in
the next few weeks to discover ways to develop sufficient electric
power capacity in the country over the next decade, according to
Nigeria President Umaru Yar’Adua.
The council will invite experts in electric power and natural
gas to propose ideas on the future development of the power sector. Yar’Adua has promised to declare a national emergency in the
power sector to focus attention on it after the council is inaugurated.
Nigeria needs adequate electric power generation to transform
it into a modern economy and electricity networks are vital infrastructure, Yar’Adua said during a 3-day retreat for ministers, special
advisers, and permanent secretaries in Abuja.
The council also will look at stabilizing the Niger Delta to get
Nigeria back on track in oil and gas production. Militants from the
Niger Delta have damaged infrastructure to pressure the federal
government into granting them greater allocations of oil and gas
revenues and development of their areas.
Nigeria’s Vice-President Goodluck Jonathan has been in talks

Development

Wyoming Baxter shale gas ﬂows without frac
Questar Corp., Salt Lake City, said it still has much to learn about
the Cretaceous Baxter shale in the Vermillion subbasin in southwestern Wyoming after it began gas sales from a second horizontal
well without treatment.
The Trail 14D-10H well in Sweetwater County, averaged 7
MMcfd of gas on 12⁄64-in. to 20⁄64-in. chokes in the first 24 hr with
7,100 psig initial flowing wellhead pressure. The well flowed from
a 2,900-ft lateral in Middle Baxter after encountering multiple indications of natural fractures.
Questar set 41⁄2-in. liner across the horizontal interval, perforated 850 ft of interval, and opened the well to sales. TD is 14,500
ft. Bottomhole location is in 9-13n-100w with surface location in
Sec. 10.
The well, which produced at rates up to 9.1 MMcfd in the first
4 days on line, was making 2.7 MMcfd on a 12⁄64-in. choke on Sept.
4 with 3,300 psig flowing wellhead pressure. Questar’s working
interest is 100%.
The early results are encouraging, said Charles Stanley, president
and chief executive officer of Questar E&P.
“We mapped, targeted, and drilled into multiple natural fractures. We perforated less than one third of the 2,900-foot horizontal section, and we produced gas at good initial rates without
fracture stimulation,” he said. “We believe natural fractures are the
key to this play, and we think that the best way to tap the natural
fracture network is with horizontal wells, but we still have much to
learn about how to drill and complete these Baxter shale wells to
optimize rate and recovery.
“We intend to produce the naturally completed 850-ft interval for a few weeks before making a decision to either fracturestimulate the currently perforated section, or simply perforate the
remaining 2,000 ft of lateral section.”
Questar’s first horizontal well in the play, Trail 13-15J, flowed
65 MMcf of gas in its first 11 days on production (OGJ Online,
Feb. 27, 2007).

Iraq Taq Taq well tested at high oil rates
The fourth appraisal-development well in Taq Taq field in northern Iraq’s Kurdistan area flowed 48º gravity oil at a combined rate
of 37,560 b/d from three reservoirs, said Addax Petroleum Corp.,
Calgary.
The TT-7 well made 10,240 b/d from a 232-m barefoot interval in Shiranish, 10,250 b/d from a 111-m interval in Kometan,
and 17,070 b/d from a 53-m interval in Qamchuqa, said Taq Taq
Operating Co., a joint venture of Addax and Genel Enerji AS of
Turkey. The flows were on 128⁄64-in., 76⁄64-in., and 128⁄64-in. chokes,
respectively.
TT-7 is 2.9 km southeast of TT-4, which was on the crest of the
structure. TD is 2,187 m. The companies are drilling the fifth and
sixth wells in the program and have started shooting 290 sq km of

3D seismic over the field.
This is the highest rate of any Taq Taq well to date and will contribute to the Kurdistan regional government’s goal of producing
1 million b/d of oil within 5 years, said Ashti Hawrami, minister
of natural resources.
Addax said recent constructive efforts of the Kurdistan region
and Iraq could result in a legal framework that will enable the corporation to begin full field development in 2008.

Gas-condensate ﬁnd tested west of Shetland
Total SA gauged a gas-condensate discovery on Block 205/5a
100 km northwest of Sullom Voe west of the Shetland Islands.
The Tormore discovery well flowed 32 MMcfd of gas with 75
bbl of condensate per million cubic feet. TD is 3,936 m. The well
is in 610 m of water 15 km southwest of the Total-operated Laggan
discovery, successfully appraised in 2004 (see map, OGJ, Aug. 20,
2007, p. 38).
Total plans to evaluate the discovery’s reserves in coming
months.
Total operates Tormore with 47.5% interest. Partners are Eni UK
Ltd. 22.5%, DONG E&P (UK) Ltd. 20%, and Chevron North Sea
Ltd. 10%.
The Total group’s proved and probable reserves in the UK exceeded 1 billion bbl of oil equivalent at the end of 2006. Total UK
E&P’s equity production on the UK Continental Shelf is 280,000
boe/d.

Imperial has two discoveries at Tomsk, Siberia
Imperial Energy Corp. reported two discoveries on its interests
at Tomsk in Western Siberia.
Imperial said its North Chertalinskoye 403 exploration well
identified potentially large oil deposits.
“The reservoirs are in the Bajenov, Jurassic, and Tyumen sections, with net oil pay in aggregate estimated at 68 m identified
through logs and cores,” Imperial said. The firm expects to flowtest the Tyumen section “by fraccing later this month, with the
other sections to be tested during the winter period.”
Imperial also said its Nyulginskoye-2 exploration well, which
was spud in July, has identified “promising intervals of oil” in the
Cretaceous and Tyumen sections.
“Net oil pay is estimated in aggregate to be 7 m through logs
and cores,” Imperial said. This well also is expected to be flowtested later this month.
Meanwhile, Imperial said, its Tamratskoye-3 exploration well
that was spud Aug. 27 is deeper than 1,000 m of its targeted depth
of 3,000 m, while the Buranovskoye-2 exploration well on Block
74 was spud on Aug. 30 and is at 800 m of a targeted depth of
3,000 m.
The British firm said it expects to spud its South Maiskoye 395
exploration well on Block 70 later this month. ✦

Production

Production starts from North Sea’s Blane ﬁeld
Talisman Energy (UK) Ltd. has begun production from Blane
oil field, which straddles the UK and Norwegian sectors of the
North Sea.
Blane is about 160 miles east of Aberdeen on UKCS Block 30/3a
and NCS Block N1/2. The field has been unitized at 82% and 18%
respectively across the median line.
Production from two horizontal development wells drilled in
2006 is expected to peak at 17,000 b/d of oil equivalent.
The Blane development wells in the UK sector are tied back by
pipeline to the Ula platform in the Norwegian sector.
Oil will be transported via the Ula Tambar system and Norpipe
pipeline network to Teeside, UK.
Talisman said an injection well will be drilled in the fourth
quarter.
Blane field was discovered in 1989 by well N1/2-1, which encountered oil in Paleocene Upper Forties sandstone. The structure
was appraised via the 30/3a-1 well in the UK sector (OGJ Online,
July 6, 2005).
Talisman Energy operates Blane field and holds a 43% interest.
Partners include Eni UK Ltd. 13.9%, Eni ULX Ltd. 4.1%, Nippon
Oil Corp. subsidiary MOC Exploration (UK) Ltd. 14%, Bow Valley
Petroleum (UK) Ltd. 12.5%, and Roc Oil (GB) Ltd. 12.5%.

Whiting begins CO2 ﬂood at North Ward Estes
Whiting Petroleum Corp., Denver, has begun a field-wide carbon dioxide flood project in its North Ward Estes field covering
58,000 net acres in Ward and Winkler counties in Texas.
This represents the initial phase of a five-phase development
project being carried out in the field through 2012 at an estimated
cost of $639 million. The project’s Phase 5, which would begin in
2013, has not been finalized, a company spokesman told OGJ.
The company began injecting 1 MMcfd of CO2 in North Ward
Estes field in May. Its current rate of injection is about 16 MMcfd.
By first quarter 2008, the company expects the injection rate to
reach 100 MMcfd of CO2.
Whiting has increased the field’s injection wells to 440 from
180 and its producing wells to 935 from 580. These additions are
the result of more drilling and converting inactive wells to producers, the spokesman said.
The field currently produces a net 5,300 b/d of oil. Peak production of 13,000 b/d of oil is expected in 2014. The field holds
about 127 million boe in proved reserves as of Dec. 12, 2006.

ExxonMobil plans Singapore steam cracker
ExxonMobil Chemical Co. plans to build a second world-scale
steam cracker complex at its existing site in Jurong, Singapore (OGJ
Online, Nov. 29, 1999).
The multibillion plant will be fully integrated with the company’s 605,000 b/cd refinery and chemical plant, providing feedstock, operating, and investment synergies. The initial chemical

Whiting acquired the field in 2005 from Celero Energy LP, Midland, for $459 million (OGJ Online, Oct. 7, 2005).

Aker completes Blind Faith semisubmersible hull
Aker Kvaerner ASA has completed the Froya deep-draft semisubmersible (DDS) hull for Chevron Corp.’s Blind Faith platform,
which will use steel catenary risers for more-efficient exploration
in ultradeepwater Gulf of Mexico.
The semisub is in a gulf integration yard to be outfitted with
topsides. Once complete, the Blind Faith platform will be installed
on Mississippi Canyon Block 650, about 162 miles southeast of
New Orleans, in 6,500 ft of water.
The platform will produce 45,000-60,000 b/d of oil and 45150 million cu m/day of gas from the high-temperature, highpressure field that will start producing in first-quarter 2008. Initial
production will be through three wells at rates of 30,000 b/d of
oil and 30 MMcfd of gas (OGJ, Oct. 17, 2005, Newsletter).
Aker Kvaerner’s DDS concept will enable the Blind Faith platform to reduce Chevron’s operating costs, as operators will not
have to continually change the flexible risers, and the platform will
not move as much in the water, compared with others.
Chevron, with partner Anadarko Petroleum Corp., awarded the
original engineering, procurement, and construction contract to
Aker Kvaerner in October 2005.

GSF orders newbuild ultradeepwater rig
GlobalSantaFe Corp. is adding to its deepwater drilling fleet and
has signed a turnkey contract with Hyundai Heavy Industries Ltd.
for a newbuild ultradeepwater drillship.
The vessel, to be built in Ulsan, South Korea, at an estimated cost
of $740 million, is scheduled for delivery in September 2010.
It is a next-generation drillship that combines the best features
of GSF’s drillships and semisubmersibles in a single unit, said GSF
Pres. and Chief Executive Jon Marshall.
The vessel is an enhanced version of company’s GSF C.R. Luigs
and GSF Jack Ryan drillships, which entered service in 2000. Like
those rigs, it will be capable of drilling in as much as 10,000 ft of
water and upgradeable to 12,000 ft.
Also, the rig will feature advanced dynamic-positioning capabilities, triple activity load paths, a derrick rated for 4 million lb,
dual liquid-storage systems, larger quarters, and an efficient deck
design that provides more space than previous-generation drillships. ✦

Total to build desulfurization unit at German reﬁnery

Total SA will invest $163.6 million to construct a 1 million
tonne/year desulfurization unit at its Leuna refinery in Germany
by fall 2009. Total will supply the domestic market with ultralowsulfur heating oil.
Leuna, which Total described as one of the most efficient refineries in Europe, has a capacity of 227,000 b/cd and is able to
process sour crude without producing heavy fuel oil.
Total said the project is part of its strategy to upgrade its refining
base. It follows the commissioning of a distillate hydrocracker at the
140,600 b/d Normandy refinery in late 2006, the construction of
a desulfurization unit and steam methane reformer at the 221,280

Skanska’s share of the project comprises detailed engineering,
$3.5 billion to enlarge the complex.
A refinery and a port that can accommodate ships as large as procurement, construction and assembly, commissioning, and
250,000 dwt also will be built as part of the project, Tien said. The start-up assistance, and is valued at $55 million.

Konys-Kumkol oil pipeline opens in Kazakhstan
KuatAmlonMunai, a Chinese-Kazakh joint venture, has commissioned a 73-km crude oil pipeline from Konys field in Kazakhstan
to Kumkol. It will deliver as much as 2,000 cu m/day of oil from
Konys field to the Atasu-Alashankou export pipeline.
Built at a cost of 1.7 billion tenge, the Konys-Kumkol pipeline
and pumping station will upgrade oil transportation in southern
Kazakhstan, which earlier relied on deliveries by tanker truck from
Konys to Kyzylorda and then by rail to eastern Kazakhstan.
KuatAmlonMunai, a 50:50 joint venture of China National Petroleum Corp. Ltd. and Kuat Holding Co., plans to produce 721,300
tonnes of oil this year, up more than 50% from the 417,500 tonnes
produced in 2006. Officials said the new pipeline will speed deliveries of oil to China and will greatly reduce transport costs.

Gazprom seeks Japan Bank funding for Sakhalin-2
Russia’s OAO Gazprom, said to be faced with financial constraints over the Sakhalin-2 LNG energy project, has resumed negotiations with the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC)
to secure needed funding.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which
had been central to Sakhalin-2’s initially planned lending syndi10

cate, withdrew in August due to concerns over Gazprom’s efforts,
perceived as illegitimate, to gain control of the development.
In April Gazprom acquired a 50%-plus-one share in the Sakhalin Energy Investment Co. for $7.45 billion under an agreement
with SEIC shareholders (OGJ Online, Apr. 24, 2007).
SEIC stakeholders—Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Mitsui & Co., and
Mitsubishi Corp.—were forced to sell their majority stake to Gazprom following Russia’s halting construction on the project for
alleged environmental infractions.
Absent EBRD, Gazprom is seeking new backers to meet the
project’s 2-trillion-yen cost. Gazprom Deputy Chairman Alexander Medvedev said his firm and the three minority partners have
reached a memorandum of understanding for JBIC financing.
Medvedev also said JBIC would consider financing other oil and
gas development projects in such areas as East Siberia, a region of
key concern to Japan.
Russia has long insisted that development of hydrocarbon resources in East Siberia would be essential to the development of the
East Siberia Pacific Ocean oil pipeline that Japan has long sought.
In February, Russian Minister of Industry and Energy Viktor
Khristenko made clear that his country would like Japanese investment in the development of East Siberian crude and gas reserves as
part of the ESPO pipeline project (OGJ Online, Feb. 26, 2007). ✦

Ethics questions

________________

12

I incorporate a lot of ethics discussion
in the finance classes I teach. In particular, the last assignment my finance
graduate students have before completing the masters program is a lengthy
paper that focuses on governance at a
public company of their choosing.
So I found the column, “Ethics survey”, of interest (OGJ, Aug. 27, 2007, p.
17. Unfortunately, it raises more questions for me than it answers.
First, I have no idea what standards
Ethisphere (the organization that conducted the survey) actually has. The closest I can come from the column is that
the standards are (per Step 7) influenced
heavily by “nearly two dozen nongovernmental organizations and socially
responsible investment firms.” This criterion is weak and subjective, especially
since we do not know the biases of the
sampled group.
Let me use Wal-Mart to illustrate the
problem with this standard. Most new
stores the company opens have far more
job applicants than positions available.
Evidently, potential employees do not
find the company’s employment practices exploitative.
Nonetheless, Wal-Mart is berated routinely as exploitative by various “nongovernmental organizations.” Are these
groups among those in the Ethisphere
sample? Arguably, these organizations
have an axe to grind: unionizing the
stores. In any event, the organizations’
views amount to saying that people who
want to work at Wal-Mart under the
company’s current policies would be
better off unemployed.
My point isn’t to defend or promote
Wal-Mart. Rather, it’s to argue that “nongovernmental organizations and socially
responsible investment firms” have their
own agendas; why should I (or anyone
else) accept them unquestioningly as
arbiters of my ethical views?
Let me address three other points
in Ethisphere’s “Eight steps”: Steps 1
(litigation), 6 (governance), and 8 (programs and systems).
Step 1: Why should litigation be
indicative of anything but the “deep
pockets” of the party being sued? Filing

lawsuits is essentially free in the US,
which does not normally require the
loser to pay legal and court costs. Litigation in countries such as the UK, which
has a “loser pays” rule, might be more
indicative of substantive issues.
Step 6: I have little idea what constitutes “governance” in this context.
In terms of the rest of your column,
I infer that that governance has to do
with established written policies and
procedures. If one believes that written
policies establish the presumption of
ethical behavior, however, I suggest that
one read the constitutions of, say, Russia
and China and compare the text with
reports of actual actions. Closer to home,
Fortune held Enron up as a model of
corporate governance in, I believe, 2000,
based on its explicit policies (including
board membership).
Finally, Step 8 is out of this world.
In essence, if a company chooses not
to respond to Ethisphere, Ethisphere

won’t consider it as highly ethical. Who
is Ethisphere to insist on cooperation?
And, if Ethisphere is entitled to insist on
a response, how about the next hundred organizations that call? Who pays
the costs of responding substantively to
everybody who might come calling?

on p. 20.
That listing of 400 industry firms
differs greatly from the current report.

Data collection
Data for this mammoth report come
from companies’ 10-K reports filed
with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission. Additional data items
come from companies’ annual reports.
Every company must file a 10-K
report with the SEC by deadlines that depend on the reported value of its public
float, its stock shares available for trading.
For instance, a corporation is deemed
a “large accelerated filer” if it has more
than $700 million of public float; it must
file with the SEC within 75 days for fiscal years ending before Dec. 15, 2006,
and 60 days for fiscal years ending on
or after Dec. 15, 2006. An “accelerated”
firm, with $75 million to $699 million
of public float has 75 days, and a “small
accelerated” firm has 90 days.
Smaller businesses can file an optional form for annual results or a transitional report called a 10-KSB; this form
contains all data items that OGJ needs
for inclusion to the OGJ200 listing.
OGJ starts collecting the data as soon
as the information is available and continues to collect it up to our deadline.
Occasionally, firms must file amendments to restate their financial results.
In those cases, OGJ gathers and edits the
data before going to print.
As a supplement to this report,
quarterly financial results for the same
group of companies are compiled and
published in OGJ’s sister magazine, Oil
& Gas Financial Journal. Only financial data are available quarterly for
this group. They’re ranked in the same
categories as the annual OGJ200. The
August 2007 edition of OGFJ posts
results for the quarter ending Mar. 31,
2007. ✦

Ozone and ethanol
Before it tightens standards for ozone pollution,
perhaps unnecessarily, the US government should
fix programs that make current standards difficult
to meet.
The Environmental Protection Agency proposes
to lower the 8-hr primary ozone standard to 7075 ppb from the current level, set in 1997, of 80
ppb. The primary standard is designed to protect
human health. The agency further proposes to
tighten its secondary standard, which is designed
to protect “welfare,” such as vegetation and crops.

costs for emissions control. This might yield some

The OGJ200 group of companies
posted a 16% gain in earnings for
2006, as capital expenditures surged
and production and reserves increased.
The number of companies qualifying
for the group climbed for the first time
since 1999, when the list was limited to
the largest 200 firms.
OGJ began publishing its list of
US-based, publicly traded oil and gas
producing firms in
1983 as the OGJ400.
This year’s compilation
contains 144 companies, up from last year’s
all-time low of 138.
Collectively, the

OGJ200 expands as 2006
earnings, spending surge

List changes
Eleven companies appear in the
OGJ200 for the first time this year, and
another firm, Atlas America Inc., returns
to the list.
Atlas America ranks No. 71 by assets
and was previously included in the
results of Resource America Inc., which
last appeared in the report 2 years ago.
In June 2005, Resource America spun
off its oil and gas operations to Atlas
America, with which Resource America
formerly consolidated.
Six firms from the previous edition
of the OGJ200 no longer appear in the
compilation because of mergers and
acquisitions (OGJ, Sept. 4, 2006, p. 20).

The OGJ200 companies benefited
from higher oil prices last year than
during 2005, but natural gas prices
declined, and earnings were tempered
by rising operating costs.
Worldwide economic growth and ensuing growth in oil demand combined
with little spare production capacity and
refinery glitches to put a floor under oil
prices last year. The futures and wellhead
prices of crude peaked in July amid
tight refining conditions and strong

ing margins last year than during 2005,
according to Muse, Stancil & Co. Strong
demand in these markets limited product supply and buoyed prices, especially
during April-August of 2006.
Although they were strong in the
second quarter of 2006, average margins for US Gulf Coast and East Coast
refiners dipped last year from their fullyear 2005 averages.
Exploration and production operating costs climbed as greater upstream
activity increased demand for the inputs
necessary to produce oil and gas. Companies paid more for labor, supplies,
and services as a result.

Annual results
In addition to improved financial
results, the OGJ200 companies reported
a collective increase in worldwide oil
and gas production and reserves during
2006.
Last year, growth in the OGJ200
companies’ spending and drilling
programs surpassed 2005 growth rates.
The group’s capital spending last year
increased 40%.
The 2006 capital spending surge resulted in a 27% increase in the number
of US wells that the group drilled. The
OGJ200 companies drilled 21,394 net
wells in the US last year.

In 2005, the group’s spending
climbed 34%, and the number of US
net wells that these companies drilled
increased 24%.
The OGJ200 details each company’s
liquids and gas production and reserves
worldwide and breaks out the results
for the US. The group reported collective gains in nearly all categories
for 2006. Results for natural gas were
stronger than for oil.
The group’s liquids production last

Is your CP
worthless?
NACE Standard
RP0169-2002 states:
“Materials....that create
electrical shielding
should not be used on
the pipeline” 1.

CONSIDER: If you use solid
film backed corrosion coatings,
you may be crippling your CP
investment.
There is a common sense reason for
this. CP systems protect pipelines by
delivering electrical current to the
steel surface. Solid film back
corrosion coatings have the property
of high dielectric strength, which
means they block electrical current.
This blocking effect is called cathodic
shielding. Cathodic shielding has

been the subject of dozens of
technical papers since the mid 1980's.
Two corrosion coatings are proven to
be non-shielding, and allow passage
of protective CP currents. One of
these coatings is FBE. The other is
Polyguard RD-6.
If you are concerned that your
organization is behind this curve, visit
www.polyguardproducts.com/failsafe
coating.htm and review the large
_______
body of information about shielding
problems.

Polyguard Products’ has been certified to these
quality systems requirements:
- American Natl. Standards Institute
- Dutch Council for Certification
- Deutscher Akkreditierungs Rat

Oil production slumps, but OGJ100 ﬁrms’ earnings climb
Marilyn Radler
Senior Editor, Economics
Leena Koottungal
Survey Editor
Oil & Gas Journal’s survey of the 100
leading oil and gas producers based
outside the US shows year-on-year earnings increases for most, while national
oil companies again dominate lists of
oil production and reserves leaders for
2006.
Averaging 85.2 million b/d, global
crude oil and NGL production last year
climbed 800,000 b/d from 2005, according to the International Energy
Agency. Output of crude only from the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, however, was unchanged from
2005 at 29.7 million b/d.
The OGJ100 list allows comparison
of size and performance of prominent
oil and gas companies around the world.
OGJ does not attempt to rank the firms by
assets or revenues because many do not
report financial results.
Instead of being ranked as in the
OGJ200, the companies are grouped by
region according to the location of their
corporate headquarters.
All financial results in this report are
shown in US dollars.

Annual results
Financial results are available for most
of the companies profiled in four of the
regions: Latin America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Canada. Each of these groups of
companies reported collective increases
in revenues, earnings, and capital spending for 2006 vs. 2005. In addition, each
group posted an increase in total assets
SPECIAL

The improved annual results of Petroleo Brasileiro SA and Petroleos Mexicanos boosted the Latin American oil and
gas companies’ combined earnings. The
group’s combined oil production was
little changed from 2005. Pemex reported
that its total 2006 sales were up 10%,
but crude oil production decreased 2%
mainly as a result of a 12% decline in
production at Cantarell field. The group of
companies based in Europe posted a 7%
increase in 2006 earnings, and the AsiaPacific group reported a combined 20%
gain. Each of these groups saw a decline
in oil production last year.

Production, reserves leaders

from a year earlier.
Led by Canadian Natural Resources
Ltd. and Suncor Energy Inc., the group of
26 companies based in Canada recorded
the best annual results on a regional basis.
Compared with their 2005 results,
the group of companies based in Canada
posted a 42% increase in earnings on
16% higher revenues. This group’s combined capital spending grew 36% last
year, and its total assets at yearend 2006
were up 22%. The group’s worldwide oil
production declined 1%.

This year’s top 20 companies in oil
production and reserves are the same
as those in the previous edition of the
OGJ100 (OGJ, Sept. 4, 2006, p. 36).
Saudi Aramco and National Iranian
Oil Co. lead the lists of oil producers and
oil reserves holders. At 17.2 billion bbl,
the top 20 firms’ combined production
for 2006 was down from 17.6 billion
bbl a year earlier. But their combined oil
reserves as of yearend 2006 were up 1.5%
to total 984.6 billion bbl.
Among the reserves leaders, Russian
giant OAO Rosneft moved up two places
to No. 9, while Malaysia’s Petronas fell to
No. 20 from No. 16 a year ago. ✦

Uncertainties cloud Arctic gas pipelines outlook
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
Recent developments have created
uncertainties for proposed natural gas
transmission systems from Canada’s
Mackenzie River Delta and Alaska’s
North Slope to markets farther south,
said Canadian and US government
officials. But their potential positive
contributions to domestic gas supplies
should not be ignored, they added.
“Security and supply are likely to
become more, not less, important,”
said Brendan Bell, minister of industry,
tourism, and investment in Canada’s
Northwest Territories. Displaying a
photograph of Venezuelan President
Hugo Chavez, he said: “A country that’s
inclined to change its constitution so its
president can stay in office is also likely
to change export terms for the energy it
produces.”
If both pipelines are built, the
Mackenzie Valley and ANS pipelines
could deliver a combined 8 bcfd of
gas to markets in southern Canada and
the Lower 48, Bell said Sept. 5 during
a discussion on the outlook for North
American Arctic gas pipelines sponsored
by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Drue Pearce, US federal coordinator
of Alaska gas transportation projects,
said Alaska holds 35 tcf of conventional
reserves, an estimated 72 tcf of undiscovered unconventional gas resources
onshore and 97 tcf offshore, 44 tcf of
coalbed methane resources, and 102 tcf
of gas hydrates. A proposed 2,100-mile
pipeline would track the Alaskan Highway through Canada. “We are finally
beginning to see companies come up
and look for gas,” she said.

Attitude changed
The Alaska state government’s attitude toward the project changed in
2006, when the legislature rejected a
contract submitted by then-Gov. Frank

Murkowski, who lost his reelection
bid in a primary soon afterwards. His
successor, Sarah Palin, determined that
Alaskans wanted a more transparent
process for the massive undertaking and
developed the Alaska Gasline Inducement Act, Pearce said.
AGIA, which the new legislature
adopted in February, is designed to get
North Slope gas to US and southern Canadian markets and to provide in-state
gas use, reasonable tariff and expansion
terms, and jobs for Alaskans for generations. “AGIA kick-starts the construction
of a gas line through an open, competitive and reasonable process,” Palin’s
official web site says.
Pearce said AGIA calls for potential
pipeline developers to compete for a

license, which the state would award
in exchange for its cooperation and
support after conducting due diligence.
Applications are scheduled to be made
public in mid-December, with the winner to be submitted to the legislature in
January.
Enbridge Inc. said it would not apply,
but TransCanada Corp. will, Pearce said.
BG Group, Repsol-YPF SA, and Chinese companies also may be interested,
although they might prefer to build
a pipeline to a liquefaction plant and
export terminal near Valdez, she said.
“Some producers may get together and
prepare their own proposal,” she added.
Producers were displeased with oil tax
reforms Alaska enacted in 2006 when

Palin announced on Sept. 4 that she was
calling state lawmakers back into special
session in October to consider additional
oil and gas taxes. Her plan came after the
state’s revenue department determined
that the new Petroleum Profits Tax would
produce $800 million less in revenues
than Murkowski’s administration had
predicted.
Palin said the new plan, Alaska’s Clear
and Equitable Share (ACES) is a hybrid of
a gross and net tax system that includes
a 10% tax based on gross receipts for the
North Slope’s legacy fields, with a 25%
net tax to encourage new development
and reinvestment in existing facilities.
ACES also would permit tax credits on
future work, restrict capital expense deductions to scheduled maintenance, and
implement strong audit and information-sharing provisions, she said.

‘2018 or later’
Although federal predictions suggest that gas could flow through an
Alaska Highway gas pipeline starting in
2017, Pearce said 2018 or later is more
realistic. “It’s always been expected that
the Mackenzie project would go first.
There’s not enough steel or labor to
proceed with both at the same time,”
she observed.
Bell said Canada’s National Energy
Board is reviewing the Mackenzie Valley
project.
He expects permits to be awarded
by spring or late summer of 2008 and
for gas to begin flowing in 201314, although he conceded that major
unanticipated expenses could create
setbacks.
Many questions concern who will
pay for the proposed gathering system

in the Mackenzie Delta, Bell said. The
Northwest Territories government suggested that Canada’s federal government
build it because it could be a facilities
investment extending beyond oil and
gas, he said.
“All of this gas would go into the Alberta system, which includes oil sands,”
said Bell. “That segment recognizes that
gas prices are high, and it is exploring
nuclear and other alternatives to process
the bitumen.”
Bell, saying, “We’re interested in
seeing the Alaskan project happen too,”
maintained that it will be necessary
to reduce the cost of shipping gas, to
provide clear policy directives with set
timeframes, and to develop closer USCanadian cooperation for both Arctic
gas pipelines to be built. ✦

GAO: Increase needed in oil spill liability trust fund
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
Although major oil spills do not
occur frequently, the federal oil spill
liability trust fund should be increased
to cover higher cleanup costs, the US
Government Accountability Office said
in a Sept. 7 report.
“To date, the fund has been able
to cover costs from major spills that
responsible parties have not paid, but
risks remain,” GAO said in a report to
leaders of the US Senate Commerce,
Science, and Transportation Committee and the House Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee.
While the 2006 Coast Guard and
Maritime Transportation Act increased
liability limits, the new limit for tank
barges “remains low relative to the cost
of such spills,” said GAO. Similarly, the
1990 Oil Pollution Act (OPA) required
that liability limits be adjusted above
levels set in the law to reflect increases
resulting from inflation, but such
changes were not made.
Such inaction during 1990-2006
44

“potentially shifted an estimated $39
million in costs from responsible parties
to the fund,” GAO maintained.
The US Coast Guard assumed OPA
enforcement responsibilities in 2005.
GAO recommended that the US Coast
Guard determine whether and how
OPA liability limits should be changed,
by vessel type, and submit those findings to Congress. GAO also suggested
that the liability limits for vessels be
adjusted every 3 years to reflect inflation changes.

Spills since 1990
Since the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill
in Prince William Sound off Alaska,
which was the impetus for authorizing the fund’s usage, no spill has come
close to matching its $2.2 billion in
cleanup costs, GAO noted. It estimated
that 51 spills costing $1 million or
more to clean up have occurred since
1990, requiring $240 million in
outlays from the fund and $620-840
million in expenditures from responsible parties.
But payments from the fund could

have been reduced by $39 million during that period if liability limits had
been adjusted to reflect increases in the
Department of Labor’s consumer price
index, it suggested.
GAO’s report said the oil spill liability trust fund also faces other challenges. Additional claims can be made for
as long as 3 years after spills have been
cleaned up; costs and claims may occur
on previously sunken vessels that may
discharge oil in the future; spills may
occur without an identifiable source
(and responsible party); and a spill
could be so catastrophic that it strains
the fund’s resources, the congressional
watchdog’s analysis suggested.
Responding, Steven J. Pecinovsky,
director of the GAO’s Inspector Liaison Office in the US Department of
Homeland Security, of which USCG
is part, said the service addressed
liability limits in a January report to
Congress and intends to adjust such
limits annually to reflect inflation
where appropriate. However, this action alone cannot ensure that the fund
will remain viable, given expenses

FTC chief’s letter chills Democrats’ ‘hot fuels’ crusade
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
US Federal Trade Commission
Chairwoman Deborah Platt Majoras
has questioned proposed cures for socalled “hot fuels” distortions alleged
by some US House Democrats, saying
the proposed “solution” may be worse
than the problem, said Rep. Darrell E.
Issa (R-Calif.) in releasing a letter from
Majoras.
Issa, ranking minority member of
the House Oversight and Government
Reform Committee’s Domestic Policy
Committee, asked Majoras for FTC’s
view after subcommittee chairman
Dennis J. Kucinich (D-Ohio) held a second hearing this summer to determine
whether new federal regulations are
needed to measure gasoline volumes
more accurately.
“In considering whether to enact legislation concerning this issue, Congress
may wish to gather facts and weigh carefully the benefits and costs that may result from such legislation,” Majoras said
in her letter. “Although the FTC has not
conducted an investigation of this matter,
it appears that the sale of ‘hot fuel’ might
not cost consumers extra money, while
the solution under consideration may
raise consumer prices.”
Issa, who has criticized Kucinich’s
allegations that major oil companies
cheat motorists out of billions of dollars during summer months when
gasoline expands, said Majoras’s letter
shows that Democrats have wasted
time with contrived problems. “Using
suspect accusations to stir up anger

hen the International Finance
Corp. financed its first coalbed methane project in China in late
August, the venture involved much
more than simply producing CBM
instead of coal. The $15 million equity investment in Houston-based Far
East Energy Corp.’s project in Shanxi
and Yunnan provinces reflected IFC’s
broader mission of minimizing
adverse social and economic impacts
while encouraging local development
and investments.
“We exist to assist the private
sector in emerging markets, but
with a broader view of making sure
countries and communities fully benefit. We always look for added value
beyond a project—and each project
is different,” explained Somit Varma,
who recently became director and
global head of IFC’s oil, gas, mining
and chemicals department.
Consequently, the World Bank
affiliate also uses environmental,
community development, health,
political, and other specialists in addition to finance experts as it considers possible projects, he told me. “We
always ask what impacts we’ll have
beyond supplying dollars,” he said.
While it still invests in oil development projects where they can help
countries develop economically and
alleviate poverty, the IFC department
has focused increasingly on gas,
which grew from 10% of its portfolio in fiscal 2004 to 60% in fiscal
2007. Oil projects had a 30% share in
2007, while the remaining 10% was
for pipelines, gathering systems, and
other infrastructure.

tutions that invest in all phases of oil
and gas from exploration and production through transmission to refining
and retailing. It uses long-term debt
and mezzanine financing as well as
equity investment. It has an approximately $2 billion upstream portfolio,
with Latin American projects representing 30%, the single largest share.
“We are long-term players. Our
clients look at 25-year commitments.
Emerging markets come with risks,
but this is our only business. We
have offices all over the world which
provide intelligence on the ground,”
Varma said.
National oil and gas companies
may be partners in projects which
IFC helps finance, but the agency
normally works with smaller private
firms, including privately held independent producers. It also works hard
to head off corruption.

Due diligence

“For us, the issue of corruption is
first and foremost. We always ask, as
we invest, if we know our customer.
That’s a critical issue of due diligence.
There’s an anticorruption clause in
our legal documents,” Varma said.
Other lenders have adopted aspects
of IFC’s operating agreements. “Fifty
banks follow environmental and social
policies which we developed to mitigate their own risk—to a point that
85% of all new projects worldwide are
covered by them,” said Varma.

profits as well as oil and gas. “Profits

[the] implementation of long-term
program of the country’s economic
development,” Mynbayev told Scaroni.
At the meeting with Scaroni,
Mynbayev also expressed Kazakhstan’s
readiness for an open dialogue aimed at
resolving the issue related to the implementation of the Kashagan project, but
asked that “our well-founded demands
related to the mineral developers’ fulfillment of their commitments not to be
politicized.”
For its part Eni confirmed that Scaroni held face-to-face talks with Kazakh
Prime Minister Karim Masimov. It said
the talks were held in a “climate of cooperation” and that the “basis was set”
for future negotiations over Kashagan
between the consortium and Kazakh
authorities.
The Eni-led consortium has come
under pressure from the Kazakh government due to cost over-runs and a delay
in starting production, originally scheduled for 2005 but now due in 2010.
The Kazakh government, which
claims that the overall cost of the
project has grown to $135 billion from
$57 billion, last month announced a
3-month suspension of the project saying it had environmental concerns (OGJ
Online, Aug. 28, 2007).
Such pressure has prompted comparisons with the tactics used last year
by Russia’s OAO Gazprom to seize the
Sakhalin-2 oil project from a consortium
led by Royal Dutch Shell PLC. According
to Konstantin Batunin, an analyst with
Moscow-based Alfa Bank, Astana wants
to increase its interests in Kashagan to
increase its shares and oil profits.
That view was supported last week
when Masimov, speaking at a gas
conference, announced that “in accordance with orders and demands” by
President Nursultan Nazarbayev, state
energy company KazMunaiGaz “should
become a joint operator of this project.”
Eni, Total SA, ExxonMobil Corp.,
and Shell each hold 18.52% stakes in
the consortium; ConocoPhillips holds
9.26%, while Inpex and KazMunaiGaz
each own 8.33%. ✦

Cuba’s oil, gas production rising, Politburo member says
Eric Watkins
Senior Correspondent
Cuba is producing nearly 50% of
the oil and gas it consumes, according
to Carlos Lage Davila, a member of the
country’s Politburo and secretary of the
Council of Ministers’ Executive Committee.
Lage made the claim in the Havana
municipality of Santa Cruz del Norte at
the end of a tour in July through facilities belonging to Western Petroleum
Drilling & Extracting Enterprise (EPEP).
He said EPEP operations in 2007
produced an additional 85,000 tonnes
of oil and 98 million cu m of gas
compared with 2006, surpassing the
government’s production plans and
guaranteeing gas delivery for electric
power production and residential use.
Earlier this year, officials said the
country produced about 65,000 b/d
of oil, much of it for electric power
production, and 3.45 billion cu m/day
of gas—of which about 335,000 cu
m/day go directly to Havana for home
use by almost 1 million people.
On his visit to EPEP, Lage said new
exploration wells are being completed,
which will increase the country’s reserves and maintain current production
levels.
Lage also stressed that Cubans are
increasingly able to service their own

oil and gas industry. Until now, he said,
Cuba depended on foreign companies
for drilling rigs, repairs, and cement
and other supplies. The country currently has 12 rigs, he said, which allows
it to assume control of wells belonging
to Cuba’s state-owned Cuban Petroleum
(Cupet) and to lease rigs to foreign
companies.
Lage said, “We have five machines to
repair wells [and] another two for the
cementing processes. All this shores up
our own capacities, and it is something
that we must continue to make progress
on.”
Still, foreign companies are responsible for most of Cuba’s production, and
Cuban officials are seeking additional
foreign investment of some $300-400
million to raise oil and gas production
to 100,000 boe/d from 85,000 boe/d
by 2009.

Cuba’s largest producer is Sherritt
International Corp, Toronto, which
holds 40-100% indirect working interest in 10 production-sharing contracts.
Most of Sherritt’s Cuban oil production
is derived from near-shore oil fields at
Yumuri, Varadero, Canasi, and Puerto
Escondido. Average net production in
2006 was 30,000 b/d.
Another 19,500 b/d of oil comes
from operations on Block 7 run by
Pebercan, Montreal, which specializes
in exploration and production in Cuba.
In June, while announcing further investments by Sherritt, Lage said
about 39 oil wells would be drilled this
year—13 by Cupet and 26 by foreign
firms.
Repsol-YPF SA, India’s ONGC Videsh,
and Norsk Hydro AS have plans to explore for oil beginning in 2008, while
Vietnam’s state-owned Petrovietnam is
expected to sign in the near future, following a cooperation agreement inked
last October with Cupet.
Last year, Venezuelan state-owned
Petroleos de Venezuela SA formed a
joint venture with Cupet to revamp the
unfinished Cienfuegos refinery (OGJ,
Apr. 17, 2006, p. 28). Current reports
say the project is on schedule to start
by yearend 2007 or early 2008. Initial
production, according to officials, will
be around 65,000 b/d. ✦

Greek Cyprus receives bids for offshore licenses
Doris Leblond
OGJ Correspondent
During 2006-08 the Republic of Cyprus will have completed its first hydrocarbon prospectivity assessment off its
coast to promote exploration, launched
two licensing rounds, and granted exploration licenses for the first.
This speedy program was outlined

in Paris Sept. 5-6 at the North African
Oil & Gas Summit organized by London-based Energy Exchange Ltd. IHS
Energy’s director for industry relations
Andrew Hayman described the exploration strategy of Cyprus as “North
Africa’s contribution to European security of energy supply.”
Cyprus decided to exploit its
resources after the northeastern Medi-

terranean island became part of the
European Union in January 2004.
“We waited until then because of the
national security the EU gives us,” said
Solon Kassinis, director of energy service at the Cyprus Commerce, Industry,
and Tourism Ministry.

populated Republic of Cyprus and the

Northern Cyprus, which has been
controlled by Turkey since 1974, is not
internationally recognized, and is not
part of the EU. Strong antagonism exists
between the Republic and Turkey, which
until 2004 prevented any exploration
off Cyprus.
A nonexclusive MC2 seismic survey
that Norway’s Petroleum Geo-Services ASA carried out in early 2006 on
70,000 sq km of the Cyprus Exclusive
Economic Zone (EEZ) launched the
hydrocarbon assessment program with
the acquisition of 6,770 line-km of
2D seismic data. The survey provided
high-resolution, subsalt deep imaging
and ties to key wells in Shell’s NorthEast Mediterranean deepwater block off
Egypt.
The seismic report, together with
regional geological background, formed
the basis of a geological interpretation
carried out in 2006 by France’s private
petroleum consulting firm Beicip-Franlab, of which Institut Francais du Petrole
is the sole shareholder.
Companies interested in participating in the first licensing round off
Cyprus purchased this interpretation

report, which was made available Feb.
15. The closing date was Aug. 16, with
evaluation of applications set for as long
as 6 months later.
Eleven offshore blocks totaling
60,000 sq km were offered for licensing. Blocks 3 and 13, which are undergoing a 3D seismic survey, will be
available during the second licensing
round, which will take place in 2008
following a regional 2D seismic survey
in the eastern Mediterranean.
Kassinis said the first round generated three applications: one from Noble
Energy Inc. and two from the consortium of Norway’s Larsen Oil & Gas AS,
the UK’s DNO ASA, and the UAE’s Dove
Energy.
The selected applicants will be offered a production-sharing contract
with exploration and exploitation
license terms and conditions, and they
will be bound by a strategic environmental assessment being carried out to
evaluate likely effects of hydrocarbon
activities on the environment.
The Republic entered into an agreement with Egypt to develop cross-median line hydrocarbon resources and
has entered into international agreements with Lebanon and Egypt to de-

lineate the EEZ. Negotiations with Israel
and Syria are under way and should be
finalized at yearend.
Summing up E&P consultant BeicipFranlab’s assessment of the Cyprus
offshore hydrocarbon prospectivity,
senior consultant Lucien Montadert said
although the offshore Cyprus was “virgin territory,” hydrocarbon discoveries
have been made in the vicinity in Egypt,
Gaza, and Israel, and source rocks that
generated the hydrocarbons have been
discovered and could be projected to
the offshore Cyprus area.
Montadert also pointed to “encouraging” seismic anomalies and direct
hydrocarbon seismic indicators as well
as to the evidence of a great variety of
play concepts and play fairways based
on interpretation of the seismic profiles
and regional geological background.
Seventeen major plays have been
identified, and the play fairways have
considerable size, reaching tens of
kilometers, Montadert said, adding that
offshore Cyprus is a new 70,000 sq
km frontier area with thick sedimentary basins and an extended seal: the
Messinian Evaporites. “The existence of
active petroleum systems is ensured,”
he said. ✦

ConocoPhillips to spend $10 million on GHG offset
ConocoPhillips has agreed to spend
$10 million to offset greenhouse gases
(GHG) that would be created by a
proposed expansion of its northern
California refinery, said California Atty.
Gen. Jerry Brown on Sept. 12.
“This agreement is a groundbreaking step in California’s battle to combat
global warming and gives the state an
early edge in meeting the [GHG] reduction goals,” Brown told reporters during a news conference in San Francisco.
In 2005, ConocoPhillips proposed
the Clean Fuels Expansion Project
involving the 120,000 b/cd Rodeo
and Santa Maria refinery in California’s
Contra Costa County.
Project plans include a hydrogen
50

plant to make cleaner gasoline and
diesel fuels from heavy crude. The
hydrogen project initially would have
emitted 500,000 tonnes/year of carbon
dioxide.
Brown appealed to the board of
Contra Costa County, challenging the
environmental documentation for the
project, saying there was a failure to
mitigate increased GHG emissions from
operation of the hydrogen plant. The
state will now withdraw its appeal, he
said.
“Under this unprecedented global
warming reduction plan, ConocoPhillips becomes the first oil company in
America to offset [GHG] emissions
from a refinery expansion project. This

is a breakthrough,” Brown said.
ConocoPhillips will take the following actions as part of its efforts to offset
these emissions:
• Audit all of its California refineries
and identify all GHG emission sources
and reduction opportunities.
• Conduct an energy efficiency audit
at Rodeo to identify feasible energy efficiency measures.
• Fund a $7 million offset program
that the Bay Area Air Quality Management District will use.
• Fund $2.8 million for reforestation in California, with an estimated
sequestration of 1.5 million tonnes of
GHG over the life of the reforestation
projects.

• Fund $200,000 for restoration of the San Pablo
wetlands.
• Surrender the operating permit for the calciner at
the Santa Maria unit, which ConocoPhillips estimates
emits 70,000 tonnes/year of GHG.
If ConocoPhillips reduces its GHG emissions, it
will get credit towards its contribution to the Bay Area
Air Quality Management District offset fund.
ConocoPhillips also agrees to offset any CO2 emissions that exceed 500,000 tonnes/year from the
hydrogen plant if the company decides to increase its
use of hydrogen. ✦

Gorgon LNG project clears
environmental hurdle
Rick Wilkinson
OGJ Correspondent
The Western Australian government has given final
environmental approval for Chevron Australia-operated Gorgon LNG project proposed for Barrow Island
off Western Australia (OGJ Online, Sept. 10, 2007).
The approval comes with 36 stringent environmental
conditions.
Among the government requirements, said Environment Minister David Templeton, were stipulations
that the project include carbon geosequestration and
panels of experts to protect the environment of Barrow Island and surrounding waters. Barrow is a Class
A animal reserve containing species extinct on the
mainland.
The environment plan includes an additional $60
million (Aus.) commitment by the Gorgon joint venture to conserve endangered species, particularly the
rare flatback turtles that come to the island to lay eggs.
The companies also must submit annual audits of
compliance and environmental performance reports.
Chevron called the environment minister’s decision
an important project milestone. The company said
the JV would incorporate the conditions into current
design optimization work.
Chevron is well on its way to implementing the
geosequestration proposal. As operator, it plans to reinject about 3 million tonnes/year of carbon dioxide
into a reservoir formation deep below Barrow Island.
However, as currently configured, the LNG plant
will still emit as much as 4 million tonnes/year of
CO2 into the atmosphere.
The project’s environmental approval is based on
construction of a facility with two LNG trains, each

Originally budgeted at $11 billion

price negotiations with several potential
suppliers in Asia Pacific. Talks with the
Gorgon partners—Chevron 50%, ExxonMobil, and Shell, 25% each—broke
down in 2005 when they refused to
sell LNG as cheaply as China wanted on
terms similar to its 25-year, $25 billion
(Aus.) supply deal with North West
Shelf LNG for Guangdong province.
Western Australia premier, Alan Carpenter, described the agreement as one
of the most significant deals since the
North West Shelf, and it firmly seals gas
relations between Australia and China,
the second of its kind.
Previously, Shell intended to market
its 25% share of Gorgon LNG to the
US market though Sempra’s Costa Azul
terminal under construction in Baja
California, Mexico.
Both Petrochina and Shell plan to
execute a detailed LNG sales agreement
before December 2008. ✦

Several thousand wells in Kansas
have been drilled into the Precambrian
basement, which usually signals the
depth limit of drilling for oil and gas
prospecting.
Most of these wells have penetrated
only a few feet or tens of feet and a few
cut several hundred feet of basement;
17 are known to have penetrated more
than 1,000 ft into the basement, so the

By any standard this well was a rank

The Wilson well is the central Forest
City basin,3 4 which extends northeast
into Nebraska and Iowa and is a shallow
cratonic basin filled with Paleozoic sediments ranging in age from Cambrian to
Permian with a thin veneer of Cretaceous, Tertiary, and Pleistocene.

at 4,000 ft under the Upper Cambrian Reagan (Lamotte) sandstone. The
Precambrian section consists of 510 ft
of a brown, lustrous biotite schist with
milky quartz interpreted as aplite veins.
The next 80 ft is a dark greenish gray
crystalline amphibolite with a subtle
change at 4,590 ft to a more gneissic
texture to TD. No granite was encountered in contrast to other Precambrian
wells in this part of the state.
A suite of wireline logs including
gamma-ray, density, and neutron porosity log, was run that give diagnostic
clues as to the rock composition of the
Precambrian rock section (Fig. 4). The
sharp break at 4,510 ft from biotite
schist to layered gneisses was substantiated. There were several shows of gas
after extensive testing, but the well was
plugged and abandoned.6
The nearest Precambrian well, drilled
in 1986, is the Hodgden & Associates
No. 201 Mosquito Creek, in 20-5s14e, Nemaha County, about 25 miles
southwest. The Hodgden wildcat well

UNCONVENTIONAL
GAS—2

Understanding of the unconventional-gas resource base has improved
in the past decade, but many unknowns
remain.
Data from drilling more than
100,000 wells and developing 120 tcf
of reserves in the past 10 years have
provided a more solid foundation for
estimating the resource
potential of tight gas
sands, coalbed methane,
and gas shales.
Yet questions remain,
such as:
Production
• Where are the

productive limits of the emerging gas
plays?
• What is the optimum well spacing?
• How will advances in well drilling
and completion technologies change
well productivity?
Because of these questions, estimates
of the recoverable portion of the large
in-place unconventional-gas resource
may change many times during the
next decade.

Note: For wells drilled through 1997

A prime example is how horizontal
drilling, restimulation, and closer well
spacing converted the Barnett shale
from a 3-tcf marginal gas resource (as
evaluated by the US Geological Survey
in 1996)3 to a major 26-49 tcf gas play
as determined in an ARI internal assessment. The ARI estimate for the Barnett
shale differs from the USGS assessment
in that it includes expectations for gas
recovery from drilling horizontal wells
in extensions of the core areas.
At the same time, as an unconventional-gas play matures, its well productivity and success rate will start declining unless technology can outpace
resource depletion.

Resource assessment steps
Because unconventional-gas resources are dynamic, the plays need frequent
reassessment, every 2-3 years, not once
per decade. ARI’s preferred resource
assessment method for continuous gas
plays has five key steps:
1. Gas in-place and play area. Establish the play outline using various
measures such as thermal maturity or
minimum net pay and than map the
gas-in-place contours to define the ultimate resource target and establish the
quality portions of the gas play.
2. Well drainage and spacing. Use
production data, reservoir proper-

Its assessment method combines use of
total petroleum systems and cell-based
resource estimates, involving play area,
well density, well productivity, success
rate, and play access.
To note is that the USGS has yet to
include in its estimate the continuous
gas resources in many large basins, such
as Anadarko, Big Horn, and East Texas.
In another assessment, the US Energy
Information Administration uses a
combination of USGS and ARI data and
contracts with ARI for annual updates to
tight gas reserves, drilling, and production estimates. These input data are incorporated into EIA’s UGRSS module of
its Oil and Gas Supply Modeling system.

gas resource base is 580 tcf, however,
the industry has a good potential for
maintaining today’s domestic natural
gas production rates, with advances in
technology potentially providing additional production.
It also matters whether a particular
unconventional-gas play has only 3
tcf or more than 40 tcf of remaining
undeveloped resource. For example,
as shown in Table 4, two resource
estimates exist for the Williams Fork
(Mesaverde) lenticular tight gas play
in the Piceance basin. USGS with data
through 1999 shows 3.1 tcf, while the
ARI estimate with data through 2005
shows 42.5 tcf.

Both the USGS and ARI use high success rates because most South Piceance
wells are infill wells.
USGS estimates a 0.9 bcf/well ultimate recovery, while ARI estimates a 1.3
bcf/well recovery for South Piceance
and a 1.85 bcf/well recovery for North
Piceance. ARI’s higher assessment is due
to recognizing that improved technology is being used in new wells and that
older wells are being recompleted. The
USGS acknowledges that “the EUR’s
presented in this report (Uinta-Piceance
Province) represent current completions
only, and do not include the anticipated
production potential for behind pipe
gas that is not yet being produced.
When this is added, the EUR’s should
be considerably higher...,” citing Reference 7.
The USGS well database is current as
of 1999 and contains 822 wells, while
the ARI well database is current as of
2005 and contains 2,920 wells.
Table 5 illustrates the time-slice
method used by Advanced Resources
for establishing success rates and recovery per well for this tight gas play. This
table shows:
• All wells drilled and completed by
key time periods, to isolate basin maturity
(depletion) and technology progress.
• Trends for well performance, the
distribution of current well performance, and trends in well success rates.
A major assessment uncertainty
exists for determining the portion of
the play that can and will be developed
in the near future. USGS assumed that
industry will develop only a relatively
small portion of available drill sites in
30 years and applied a 28% quality-accessibility factor to the play. ARI, after
mapping the high gas-in-place portion
of the South Piceance basin and examining the federal leasing regulations for
this basin, used an 87% quality-accessibility factor.
This discussion provides an insight
into the difficulty in making resource
assessments for unconventional gas and

Frequent updates
Improvements in technology and
knowledge rapidly can change the
outlook for unconventional-gas plays.
To see these changes requires frequent
assessments, particularly for resources
where technology progress is helping
unlock a gas play.
A prime example is the Williams
Fork (Mesaverde) play where multizone
stimulation and new understanding of
reservoir geometry has led to better
well performance and has justified several rounds of downspacing, resulting
in a substantial increase in the recoverable resource base.
The knowledge gained from such
assessments is vital for guiding industry investments and for formulating a
sound energy and natural gas policy. ✦

As the Deepwater Operations Conference & Exhibition moves back to
a fall schedule this year, the conference is already showing interest
among exhibitors and attendees. Building on the success of the
past four shows, this year’s advisory board has chosen to highlight
performance issues critical for success. This year, the conference
program will address many topical areas including subsea operations
and maintenance, new deepwater start-ups, FPSO’s in the Gulf of
Mexico, metering and allocations, emergency response and security
and deepwater repair and maintenance.

PennWell conferences and exhibitions are
thought provoking events that cover your area
of expertise, allowing you to stay ahead in a
constantly changing industry.

blocked the flow by isolating the gas
pockets, in effect re-establishing permeability to water and decreasing permeability to gas.
The sulfur-recovery unit (SRU) was
restarted in March 2004 to handle the
acid-gas volume and avoid flaring. A
follow-up workover to inject a combination of CO2 and methanol to enhance
mutual solubility of the reservoir phases
and re-establish permeability to acid gas
was completed. Some of the workover
fluid was also flowed back and recovered, which required safety precautions
for sour gas since some acid gas was
entrained.
The combination of these actions
returned the wellhead pressure to a
typical shut-in value of less than 1,100
psig. Injection was then restarted in July
2004 in parallel with operation of the
SRU.

ing injection rate. The shut-in pressure
during the well was greater than 2,000
psig and a slow decline as the pressure
leaked into the formation. The rapid
drop in pressure to 1,100 psig from
1,800 psig occurred at the end of May
2004 due to the last workover injecting
CO2 and methanol and then recovering
some of the injected fluid.
Fig. 4 then covers the operating
data from restarting injection in July
2004 through August 2007. Injection
temperature has been fairly constant at
about 90° F., although precise control is
limited due to the common cooler. The
composition of the acid gas has gradually trended downward with the H2S
decreasing steadily to about 30% from
40% as the mix of inlet gas to the plant
changed.
The data in Fig. 4 also show the relationship between injection pressure and
injection rate. Following restart of injection in July 2004, the well was operated
in parallel with the SRU at injection
rates of about 400 Mscfd. The pressure
is generally flat at this low injection
rate, at about 1,500 psig. There are also
periods when the well is shut-in, the
wellhead pressure drops to 1,200 psig,
and the SRU takes the full volume.
Finally, there are periods when the
SRU is shut-down for maintenance
and the well handles the full volume

of 700-1,000 Mscfd and the pressure
increases to 1,800 psig or higher. The
rate (slope) of this increase in pressure
has decreased as the well continues to
clean up with time. The system has been
successfully injecting the entire volume
of acid gas since April 2006 allowing
shutdown of the SRU.

Reservoir model
The performance data through December 2005 and well data were used
to prepare a single-well radial model for
the reservoir. The model has 16 vertical layers of varying permeability using
data from the sidewall cores adjusted
to match the drillstem tests. One 3-ft
high layer has a permeability to air of
32 md indicating a natural fracture. A
second layer has 1.5 md, and the rest of
the zone has low permeability with a
height-weighted average of 0.56 md for
the unadjusted core data.
The porosity ranges from 3% to 17%
with a weighted average of 6%. These
values compare unfavorably to average
permeability of 40 md and average porosity of 10% reported for 225 Permian
basin reservoirs.9
The model also divided the reservoir
into six quadrants in a circle and 50
radial rings spaced logarithmically to
an outer boundary radius of 10,560
ft (2 miles). The model was tuned by
adjusting relative gas permeability and
skin factor to match operating data for
injection pressure vs. injection rate.
A key assumption in the model
is that the high permeability layer is
continuous to the model boundary.
Performance to date does not suggest a
smaller boundary distance for either.10
The history-match results for the model
show continued improvement of well
performance with time.
A convenient way to show the results
is equivalent fracture length, which is
calculated from the skin factor. Table 2
shows the improvement in equivalent
fracture length with time.
The design-etched length predicted
for the initial fracture stimulation was
173 ft; for the second stimulation,
396 ft. The model performance for the

March 3 – 5, 2008 / Moody Gardens Hotel & Convention Center, Galveston, Texas

SUBSEA TIEBACK
Forum & Exhibition

PennWell invites you back to the 8th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition.
SSTB has become the premier event for one of the fastest growing field
development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March 3 – 5, 2008 in
Galveston, TX at the Moody Gardens Hotel & Conference Center. Over 2,000
people and 150 exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference.You can’t
afford to miss it.
As our industry confronts new challenges, it has never been more important
to submerse yourself in them. This year’s theme is “Subsea is here, the game
is changing.” As our game changes, the sharing of knowledge and collective
experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety,
and economics of the subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by
industry leaders. As in the past, only by participating in this conference will you
be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will not be published and no
Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room
stays inside the conference room. We hope you will join us.

The unit was then started up and put
into operation. Even though the plant
has operated at maximum inlet-gas
capacity, the acid-gas rates are currently
about 700-850 Mscfd. The injection
pressure had fallen to about 1,600 psig
during the shutdown and has only
increased to about 1,900 psig by August
2007.
The plant has seen one amine or other plant upset during this time in which
the injection pressure climbed rapidly
to 2,100 psig. The compressor was able
to stay online through this event with
the new cylinder configuration.
The new design has allowed the
plant to sustain injection at higher rates
for short periods of time and even at
elevated summer injection temperatures
and provides for the expected injection
rates for the life of the facility.

Efﬁciency; CO2 sequestration

The plant has experienced good
control efficiency during the 3 years of
injection operation.
The cumulative efficiency has been
98.5% from start-up to mid August
2007 and 99.2% for the last 3 years
of operation (August 2004 to August
2007). Operation of acid-gas injection
in parallel with the sulfur-recovery unit
has also improved SRU efficiency by
about 2%, primarily due to base-load-

ing the SRU.
The plant has sequestered about
25,620 tons of CO2 by mid August
2007. The current CO2 sequestration
rate is 11,000 tons/year. These figures
exclude any CO2e emissions related to
the generation of power by the utility
company used to power the injection
compressor.

Operating issues

During winter operations and especially during turndown when excess
intercooler area is available, the intercoolers can run colder than design. This
is predicted to cause condensation of
an acid-gas/BTEX hydrocarbon liquid
phase in the scrubbers.
When this liquid is expanded to
lower pressure, the fluid can auto-cool,
reach hydrate temperature, and plug the
liquid line. This effect can be demonstrated with process-simulation calculations and is the cause of level control
and freezing problems.
The electrical heat trace was also
found to be insufficient, and steam trace
was added to provide more heat input
and address areas lacking heat trace.

Corrosion rates
The plant has experienced a few
operating issues during 3 years of
operation. The main ones are excessive inter-stage liquids, hydrates, and
corrosion. These are compounded by
turndown issues.

After 3 years of operation, ultrasonic
thickness readings have shown possible

Increased ethanol
production capacity in
the US requires a new
transportation paradigm.
Boutique production
Pipelines
facilities serving regional
hubs via truck or short
line rail are not a sufficient or realistic
solution. Dedicated ethanol and ethanol
blend pipelines are the only option that
is safe,
efficient,
and cost
effective,
but only
if legal,
technical, and
financial problems are addressed in a
coordinated manner.
Several oil and pipeline companies
are already looking at such pipelines
as an investment opportunity. Private
equity funds and investment banks
will likely follow. Legal, technical, and
economic problems are manageable,
provided that government and industry
closely coordinate efforts.

2012, with production jumping more
than 30% between 2005 and 2006 (Fig.
1). Current estimates have US ethanol
production capacity, already the largest
in the world (Fig. 2), growing to more
than 10 billion gal/year by 2009, if not
earlier.
The US uses alternative fuels for
around 6% of its transportation energy demand, while countries such
Brazil use a much higher percentage.
Supply and demand—aided by subsidies—are both likely to increase in the
US especially once cellulosic ethanol is
perfected.
In January 2007, US Pres. George W.
Bush established a new goal of reaching
35 billion gal/year of ethanol production by 2017. Ethanol is already present
in nearly half of all gasoline sold in the
US, as a component of various gasolineethanol blends, making attainment of
Bush’s goal likely.

Pipeline transportation remained too
expensive for the volumes involved, despite being the most cost effective mode
of transportation. Only 5 years later,
logistics and economics have changed.
Trucking ethanol will inevitably play
a role in the supply chain, but trucking
is not cost efficient or feasible for the
volumes now anticipated. Rail transport,
similarly, will play a role in the supply
chain, but there are both volume and
cost limitations to rail as an option.
Barge shipments are more cost effective, but less time efficient. A serious
question also exists about the availability of Jones Act vessels (those built and
registered in the US, as required by law
for shipment within US boundaries) or
vessels that comply with the requirements of the 1990 Oil Pollution Act.
Pipelines are the safest, most efficient, and most cost effective mode
of transport for ethanol. Whether the
infrastructure exists or warrants the
significant investment necessary to
establish it, however, remains an open
question.

dedicated ethanol pipelines prevent
water infiltration.
Petroleum products, by contrast, tolerate water infiltration with little problem, any contact water from infiltration
or condensation being removable at
tankage facilities.
Blends of ethanol and petroleum
products are only marginally more
flexible for transportation than pure
ethanol, the degree to which this is the
case depending on the proportion of
ethanol being piped.
Industry and agencies will need to
agree on the gasoline-ethanol blends to
be most used moving forward because
of its effect on transportation alternatives. Higher concentrations of ethanol
increase concern for water infiltration,
contamination from pipe residue, and
such metallurgical issues as stress corrosion cracking.
Light gasoline-ethanol blends may
be able to move in existing pipeline
infrastructure with no modifications,
while higher concentration blends will
require increased pipe cleaning and
maintenance. Pure ethanol will likely

its feasibility in test projects using both
pure ethanol and ethanol blends.
The US Department of Transportation’s Pipeline & Hazardous Materials
Transportation Administration regulates
all interstate pipelines transporting
natural gas, hazardous liquids (including petroleum), and carbon dioxide.
PHMSA promulgates rules governing
pipeline design, construction, operation, and maintenance. In the past few
years, at the direction of Congress and
the White House, PHMSA has promulgated new rules requiring improved
integrity management planning for
pipelines, raising the bar for operation
and maintenance of all existing and
new petroleum product pipelines.
Ethanol is not currently within
PHMSA’s jurisdiction, but in a Federal
Register notice dated Aug. 10, 2007,
PHMSA proposed to subject ethanol to
the same regulations governing petroleum pipelines. PHMSA stated that it
finds “all biofuel-gasoline blends” to
meet the definition of “petroleum products” subject to its pipeline regulations.
The notice also stated PHMSA’s intent to
regulate transportation of all “unblended ethanol and other biofuels.”

the notice, simply including ethanol
and biofuels in the list and definition

plish its regulation, making all ethanol
pipelines subject to the design, construction, operation, and maintenance
standards of PHMSA. It is likely that additional rule changes, requiring actions
specific to ethanol transport will also
occur, but the PHMSA regulations are
well suited to this evolution.
Several other federal agencies also
have potential jurisdiction over interstate ethanol pipelines. The Department
of Energy provides informational and
research and development support,
but defers to PHMSA on oversight and
operational regulation.
The US Environmental Protection Agency also regulates ethanol as
a hazardous substance, which—like
oil—requires reporting and response
when released to the environment. EPA
currently has a higher threshold for
reporting ethanol releases than for oil,
but this may change.
The US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms has additional regulatory oversight for ethanol production
activities (due to potential illegal consumption issues), but not for ethanol
transportation. Among these agencies,
the legal framework governing ethanol
pipelines is already in place, with PHMSA likely taking the lead. Coordination
of agencies should not be a significant
obstacle to infrastructure development.
The remaining piece waiting to fall

in place is the financial investment for
ethanol pipelines. Some companies are
planning to convert existing petroleum
pipelines to ethanol-blend use. Such
efforts will be cost effective, but higher
blends or pure ethanol transport will
likely require new pipe and increased
system integrity reconfiguration and
maintenance.

Infrastructure opportunity
New, dedicated ethanol pipelines will
be costly to install. There may, however,
be cost savings available in creating this
new energy infrastructure.
Some ethanol pipelines could be
placed within existing oil and gas
pipeline rights-of-way, minimizing
the costs of obtaining new ROW and
permitting. The existing petroleum
pipeline infrastructure is also aging and
nearing capacity, with construction of
a new ethanol infrastructure providing
a potential opportunity to replace or
upgrade certain adjacent existing lines
or segments, thereby realizing economies of scale.
In areas of increasing population
growth around the US, notably the
South and West, dedicated ethanol
pipelines could also follow the routes
of new or reconfigured federal highway
projects. Such construction projects
will have already obtained all necessary
ROW, and the environmental impact

statements obtained for transportation
purposes would shorten project review
and permitting delays, and decrease
costs. ✦

Enhancements added to offshore thrusters
New enhancements to the Pleuger
brand of azimuthing thrusters are designed to help improve offshore operations.
These thruster units are multidirectional propeller pods installed on platforms
and ships to allow for intricate vessel
positioning.
A recent modification to the tilted-shaft
design of the units helps improve the net
thrust of operation in offshore uses.
The newest technological contribution is the underwater-mountable, L-drive
and fixed-pitch thruster line for offshore
applications. The WFSD-type thruster with
this tilted-axis propeller is designed for
optimum net thrust output and maintainability. This tilted-shaft propeller design
helps assure minimum thruster-hull and
thruster-thruster interaction, which results
in higher net thrust for the vessel, the
company points out.
The newly designed thrusters are avail-

able for custom optimization to as large
as 5 m in propeller diameter. This design
provides for greater than 4,000 kW input
power with a fixed-pitch propeller.

From the Subscribers Only area of

Dingell steers
toward classic
US energy folly
“Properly addressing climate change requires us to address the issue of consumption. We do that by making consumption
more expensive.”
Give Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.)
credit for cutting to the heart of the matter
(OGJ, Sept. 3, 2007, p. 28).
His two sentences contain all the ingredients of wrong policy on climate change
and energy. “Wrong” here means wasteful

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

and ineffective.
First the congressman presumes to
know how “properly” to address climate
change.
What does he mean? Moderating emissions of greenhouse gases, which is feasible but expensive? Or inﬂuencing global
average temperature, which might not be
feasible and therefore should elicit caution
with regard to cost?
From this ambiguity Dingell concocts
a requirement that government “address”
consumption, which means telling people
how much and what types of energy to use.
Past intrusions of this type have come to
expensive grief.
Governments can have only one notion
about ideal levels of energy consumption:
less than current levels. The extended pursuit of such a target represents an economic death spiral, the only escape from which
is a return to market principles.
These days, alas, attention to market
principles in energy politics is scarce. In the
US, political allegiance to markets weakens as fuel prices rise. So Dingell shamelessly lurches to a fanciful need for the
government to make “consumption more
expensive.” This, of course, means relieving
consumers of cash they would rather spend
on something other than energy.
When markets divert consumers’ funds
in such a manner, consumers ferociously
complain. They should complain louder
when elected ofﬁcials propose to hike
prices. In fact, consumers always should
prefer price increases occasioned by the
market to those forced upon them by the
government.
The market tensions that raise energy
prices eventually relax. The taxes and mandates essential to government control of
consumption never subside until consumers recognize what’s happening to them.
The oil and gas industry should wonder
how much money Americans would waste
on Dingell’s version of classic energy folly
before they woke up and demanded an end
to his raid on their wealth.

Gas shut in due to low prices
Natural gas futures prices temporarily strengthened Sept. 4-5 on news that
Chesapeake Energy Corp. of Oklahoma City, the largest independent gas producer
in the US, is reducing its gross production by 200 MMcfd through a combination of
production curtailments and deferred pipeline hook-ups for the rest of 2007 due to
poor market conditions.
That translates into a net loss of 125 MMcfd for Chesapeake, 6% of its current production. The reductions will be in the company’s most proliﬁc areas in the Fort Worth
basin Barnett shale, South Texas, Deep Haley, and Anadarko basin.
“This news may spur other E&P companies to slow drilling activity as we approach what is shaping up to look like another year of high summer-ending storage
levels,” said analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc.
Chesapeake also is cutting its drilling program to 140-145 rigs by the end of this
year from 155-160 rigs currently. That will reduce the company’s previously budgeted
capital expenditures by 10% in both 2008 and 2009, or a combined $1 billion.
Despite the recent drop in gas prices, Chesapeake ofﬁcials apparently used the futures market as an effective hedge. “So far this year, we have realized approximately
$630 million in gains from our natural gas hedges, and, as of the middle of last week,
the mark-to-market gain on our remaining 2007-09 natural gas hedges was approximately $1.5 billion,” company ofﬁcials reported Sept. 4. Chesapeake hedged 60% of
its 2007 second-half gas production, 70% of its 2008 production, and 27% of its 2009
production at weighted average prices well above the Sept. 7 spot market price of
$5.57/MMbtu at Henry Hub, La.
Despite the earlier jump in prices, gas futures fell Sept. 6-7 to within pennies of
the week’s opening price on the New York Mercantile Exchange as the hurricane
premium evaporated from the market and US inventories expanded. The Energy
Information Administration reported the injection of 36 bcf of gas into US underground storage in the week ended Aug. 31. That pushed US gas storage to just above
3 tcf for the ﬁrst time ever in August, 30 bcf above year-ago levels and 284 bcf above
the 5-year average.
With predictions for moderate weather for the rest of the summer and a current
lack of hurricane activity, Raymond James analysts warned, “Look for continued
weakness in the natural gas market as we near the end of this injection season.”
Oil prices climb
Crude prices climbed to a 5-week high over ﬁve consecutive trading sessions
through the ﬁrst week of September, topping $77/bbl in intraday trading Sept. 6-7.
The EIA reported US commercial crude inventories fell 3.9 million bbl to 329.7
million bbl in the week ended Aug. 31. Gasoline stocks dropped 1.5 million bbl to
191.1 million bbl in the same week, well below average for the time of year. Distillate
fuel inventories increased by 2.3 million bbl to 132.2 million bbl (OGJ Online, Sept.
6, 2007). That put US crude stocks below last year’s inventory levels for the ﬁrst time
in 12 weeks.
Paul Horsnell at Barclays Capital Inc., London, said, “US gasoline inventories fell
further below the seasonal norm, to a new 2-year low in absolute terms and to a
new all-time low in terms of days of forward demand.”
However, Olivier Jakob, managing director of Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland, noted a build of crude stocks in Cushing, Okla., storage—“the ﬁrst substantial
build since April,” he said. “More importantly, the Cushing build is happening despite
the front West Texas Intermediate spreads [being] at a multiyear high backwardation
(for the season).” In backwardation, prices for promptly delivered crude exceed those
of futures contracts with more-distant delivery dates.
Moreover, Jakob said imports of crude from Canada into Petroleum Administration for Defense District 2 [the US Midwest including Oklahoma] were 190,000 b/d
higher in August than in July, resulting in a rebound of stocks. “With reﬁnery maintenance in PADD 2 during September and higher Canadian crude oil production, the
ﬂag remains for further stock build in the Midwest, which does not correlate with the
current level of WTI backwardation. The Cushing statistics are the ﬁrst serious alarm
bells in many weeks for the WTI backwardation, which will be in greater danger if the
Cushing trend is conﬁrmed next week,” he said.
Meanwhile, there was virtually no expectation that ministers of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries would take any action at their Sept. 11 meeting in
Vienna. “Several of the oil ministers...have publicly stated they are in favor of not
changing current production quotas,” said Raymond James analysts.

INVESTMENT SOARS AS OUTPUT RISES!
The oil sands of Alberta are undergoing an investment boom worth more than $100 billion. From 2007 to
2016, the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board (EUB) projects total real investment in Alberta’s oil sands (surface
mining, upgrading, in situ, and support services to reach Canadian $118 billion. Output from oil sands is set
to rise from about 1.2 million barrels a day to an expected 3 million b/d by 2016, and perhaps 4 million
plus by 2020. That could make Canada the world’s fourth-biggest oil producer after Saudi Arabia, Russia and
the United States.
Today’s oil pricing levels have made extraction of oil from oil sands much more attractive than in the past. The
reserves in Alberta will support production for a least the next century. Canada is the new frontier in non-OPEC
oil developments.
Don’t miss this opportunity to present your expertise to a powerful, inﬂuential audience. Join PennWell Petroleum
Events in this second year conference and exhibition.
As the boom continues, share your ideas, experiences, technology, and expertise with major industry players who
must react quickly to the rapid expansion. Plan to present a technical paper at the the second annual Oil Sands
and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition, July 15 – 17, 2008, at the Calgary TELUS Convention
Centre in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

COVER
Ample financing is available for US independents through private
equity markets, public equity markets, and bank loans. A special
report beginning on p. 22 outlines the ways independents raise
capital to finance exploration and development projects. Some
companies are establishing upstream master limited partnerships.
Others are turning to multilateral financial institutions for support. International Finance Corp., the private-sector arm of the
World Bank, backed BPZ Energy Inc. with its operations in Peru.
The cover shows BPZ’s CX11 platform in Corvina field. During
testing for oil in September, this well, the CX11-14D, tested a cumulative 2,400 b/d and 104 MMcfd of gas.The platform started
oil production on Nov. 1. Photo from BPZ.

Saudis foil Al Qaeda terrorist plots, arrest 208
Saudi Arabia said it has preempted a terrorist attack on its oil facilities in the eastern region of the country with the arrest of eight
suspects said to be linked to the Al Qaeda terrorist organization.
An Interior Ministry statement said the eight were part of a terrorist cell led by a non-Saudi man, who also was arrested. It said
the arrest of the eight pre-empted an imminent attack on an (unnamed) oil installation.
The ministry said the men were arrested as part of a security
sweep that netted some 208 suspects either for plotting various
terrorist activities in the country or supporting the Al Qaeda network.
One group of 18 suspects, led by an alleged expert in launching
missiles, was arrested separately. “They were planning to smuggle
eight missiles into the kingdom to carry out terrorist operations,”
the ministry said.
In August, Saudi Arabia announced plans to establish a
35,000-person strong special force to protect its oil facilities due
to the increasing threats against them by the Al Qaeda network.
In April, Saudi authorities conducted a sweep that netted 172
alleged militants, including pilots authorities said were trained for
attacks on oil refineries using civilian airplanes (OGJ Online, Apr.
27, 2007).
There have been several terrorist attacks on the country’s facilities in recent years linked to the Al Qaeda network.
In February 2006, Saudi officials confirmed that a terrorist attack failed to disrupt operation of the Abqaiq crude oil processing
facility, which handles as much as two thirds of the country’s production and most of its exports from the Persian Gulf (OGJ Online,
Feb. 24, 2006).
In May 2004, Saudi Arabian officials pledged better security in
the country after a terrorist attack at its oil and petrochemical hub
at Yanbu on the Red Sea, which left 6 dead and as many as 33
wounded (OGJ Online, May 3, 2004).

Petroecuador president named to quell unrest
Ecuador has appointed Navy Rear Admiral Fernando Zurita to
head Ecuadoran State Petroleum Enterprise to deal with an emergency situation facing the state-run oil company.
The action was taken partly due to an urgent need to restructure
Petroecuador but mainly to quell a public protest that has caused a
drop in production at the Auca Sur, Auca Central, and Cononaco oil
fields. “The forced interruption affects 47 oil wells, which means
a daily loss of approximately $3 million, since they have stopped
producing 36,000 b/d of oil, plus the damage done to oil field
infrastructure,” said Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa in a statement.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Zurita’s first mission will be to indict “on grounds of sabotage
the unpatriotic people who inflicted the damage,” a presidential
decree said. The administration said it had not ruled out declaring
a state of emergency in Orellana province.

Activists curb Petroecuador’s Auca Sur oil output
Ecuador’s state-owned Petroecuador said it has lost some 5,000
bbl of oil output due to a continuing protest by local villagers that
disrupted operations in Dayuma, Orellana Province.
Petroecuador said a set of protesters blocked a bridge on Nov.
25, while other militants forced their way into the Auca Sur station
and electric plant, “demanding that operators shut down the entire
oil power system, provoking disorder and acts of vandalism.”
On Nov. 26, the company said, more protesters reached the
Auca 61D well and used dynamite to disable a hydraulic pump,
effectively shutting down the installation.
The villagers are demanding jobs, electricity, and paved roads.
But Petroecuador, describing the occupation as a terrorist action,
said it had already met the villagers’ demands to improve basic
public facilities in the district.
Meanwhile, the firm warned of adverse effects from the protest,
saying that “production losses will go on increasing every hour”
that the complex remains shut down. Normal daily production at
the Auca Sur field is about 176,000 b/d.
In March a blockade by protesters in the Amazon region forced
the company to cut oil exports by 36,000 b/d for about a week.
Ecuador produces around 500,000 b/d of oil, making it the
fifth-largest producer in South America.

Gas key to climate change, executive says
Natural gas must continue to be a major fuel in Germany’s
energy mix if climate change is to be addressed successfully, said
Burckhard Bergmann, chairman of E.On Ruhrgas.
It is not enough to focus only on renewable energy to reduce
carbon emissions, Bergmann said. Energy efficiency and cost input
are also necessary.
“A policy ‘away from gas’ will lead into a blind alley in energy
policy,” he said. “If the climate benefits of natural gas are not used,
people will be buried by an avalanche of costs.”
Investment in technology and the promotion of renewable
energy must both be reflected in relevant legislation, Bergmann
added.
E.On Ruhrgas has launched Erdgas.On, which will focus on
technologies that are environmentally friendly for the gas market.
It also will develop the biogas market on a commercial scale and
introduce the renewable as a motor fuel. ✦

Apache ﬁnds gas with Jade-4 well in Egypt
Apache Corp., Houston, will complete the Jade-4 exploration
well in Egypt’s Western Desert as a gas and condensate producer
after it flowed 23.8 MMcfd of gas and 2,107 b/d of condensate
from the Jurassic Alam El Bueib-3G (AEB) formation.
Apache logged 234 ft of net pay in the AEB, which it described
as one of the “most prolific reservoirs” in the greater Khalda concession. Jade-4 is adjacent to the Jade-1x discovery, which logged
217 ft of AEB pay and 66 ft in the Jurassic Upper Safa formation in
March (OGJ Online, Apr. 3, 2007). “The discovery was completed
as a gas producer from the Upper Safa after a test of 25.6 MMcfd
of gas,” Apache said.
It will carry out appraisal and development work next year
along the Jade trend and will drill other prospects. After drilling
three wells in Jade field along the Matruh Ridge, Apache has found
hydrocarbons in four discrete reservoir intervals.
“The Jade-2x well is producing gas and condensate after testing
over 20 MMcfd of gas from each of two AEB sands,” Apache said.
“In addition, oil pay was identified in another AEB sand behind
casing in the Jade-1x and Jade-4.”
G. Steven Farris, Apache president and chief executive officer,
said the Jade discovery “was one of several higher-risk, higherreward exploration prospects we have developed across the 37
million acres we have assembled in [the company’s] core growth
regions of Australia, Canada, and Egypt.”
Jade is in the quarter-million-acre Matruh concession in which
Apache holds a 100% interest.

Brazil awards ﬁve Santos basin blocks to Karoon

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

five contiguous offshore exploration blocks in the Santos basin off
Brazil—the same region as the recent 8 billion bbl Tupi oil discovery (OGJ Online, Nov. 16, 2007).
Karoon said the Brazilian permits are 300 km east-southeast of
Tupi and 100 km from producing Caravela and Coral oil and gas
fields.
The blocks—1037, 1101, 1102, 1165, and 1166—will be officially awarded next March when Karoon pays $25 million in nonrefundable signature bonuses and refundable bid bonds.
Karoon has pledged a work program consisting of geological
analysis along with the reprocessing and interpretation of existing
seismic data. The company must acquire an additional 170-sq-km
3D seismic survey in three of the permits during the first 3 years.
In an optional second 3-year term, one well is committed to each
block.
Karoon was one of the successful companies that bid a total
$1.5 billion in cash for 117 exploration blocks.

StatoilHydro stops Ormen Lange gas production

CNOOC starts up platform in PL 19-3 ﬁeld

Natural gas production from Ormen Lange field, the largest gas
field in development on the Norwegian Sea’s continental shelf, was
stopped because of a gas leak in the export compressors. Ormen
Lange, which lies 120 km northwest of Kristiansund, holds 397
billion cu m of proved gas reserves.
Field operator StatoilHydro AS expects production to resume
Dec. 2 after it has carried out an inspection and repair work.
Gas from Ormen Lange is transported to the UK via the 600-km
southern leg of the Langeled pipeline, which is expected to supply
as much as a fifth of the UK’s gas needs at full capacity rates.
The field, expected to supply 70 million cu m/day of gas and
50,000 b/d of condensate at peak rate, will position Norway as
the world’s second largest gas exporter after Russia. Gas can also
be transported to European markets after it has been processed at
the Sleipner hub.
The partners expect to produce gas from 24 subsea wells on the
field and Royal Dutch Shell PLC assumed operatorship on Dec. 1.

CNOOC Ltd. has brought Platform C on stream in Peng Lai (PL)
19-3 oil field on Block 11/05 in Bohai Bay.
This is the first wellhead platform starting production in the
field’s Phase II development.
The facilities in Phase II development include five wellhead platforms, a central processing facility, and a world-class floating production, storage, and offloading vessel with a processing capacity
of 190,000 bo/d and the capability to handle 510,000 b/d of total
fluids (OGJ Online, Mar. 21, 2007).
PL19-3, the largest oil field off China, is being developed jointly
by operator CNOOC 51% and ConocoPhillips China Inc. 49%.
Phase I of PL 19-3 went on stream in December 2002 from a
single wellhead platform and a leased FPSO.

gas, and to inject about 300,000 b/d of water into the reservoir
(OGJ Online, Nov. 7, 2006). It is installed in 1,800 m of water, a
Brazil record.
The platform initially will handle volumes of about 20,000
b/d but is expected to reach its total capacity of 180,000 b/d in
mid-2008 when it will be interconnected to 18 production and 11
water injector wells.
The platform’s hull was built in Singapore, and its operating
modules were manufactured in Brazil.

The project, designated South Heart, will use coal in a chemical
process to create substitute natural gas.
The South Heart project involves seven British Gas Lurgi gasifiers that will use North Dakota lignite to produce up to 100 MMcfd
of pipeline-quality synthetic gas.
Existing pipelines will transport the gas throughout North
America, GNPD said.
The BGL technology is owned jointly by Envirotherm and Advantica Ltd., both of which will provide the technology license,

Fire shuts down second Saudi reﬁnery
Fire has shut down a Saudi Arabian refinery, according to a statement by Saudi Aramco Lubricating Oil Refining Co. (Luberef). It is
the second fire-related accident at an Aramco facility in a month.
Luberef said the fire broke out Dec. 1 at one of its refineries
south of Jiddah but was put out quickly with no casualties. It did
not mention which of its two refineries was closed.
Luberef operates refineries in Jeddah and Yanbu for the production of lubricating base oils. The combined design capacity of Luberef’s two refineries is 550,000 tonnes/year.
In the statement, Luberef Chief Executive Omar Bazuhair said
the fire would not affect the company’s supplies, and the refinery
would be reopened “within a short period of time after carrying
out some tests on the products.”
Bazuhair said the fire started in a storage tank when a malfunctioning cooling fan ignited a propane leak.
In an earlier accident, 28 people were killed and another 10
injured on Nov. 18 when an explosion ignited a fire along the
Haradh-‘Uthmaniyah gas pipeline in Saudi Arabia’s Eastern province. Saudi authorities ruled out any terrorist connection with the
accident (OGJ Online, Nov. 19, 2007).
In late November, the Saudi government reported that it had
preempted a terrorist attack on its oil facilities in the eastern region
of the country with the arrest of eight suspects said to be linked to
the Al Qaeda terrorist organization (OGJ Online, Nov. 29, 2007).
Luberef was founded in 1976 as a joint venture of Saudi Aramco
70% and ExxonMobil 30%. In early November, Saudi Aramco said
Jadwa Investment Co. had reached an agreement to acquire ExxonMobil’s 30% stake in Luberef.

Total, Sonatrach plan Algerian petchem complex
Total SA and Algeria’s Sonatrach have signed a framework agreement to build a $3 billion petrochemical complex with a 1.4 million tonne/year ethane cracker in Arzew, near Oran, by 2012. The
signing follows a memorandum of understanding signed in July
(OGJ Online, July 19, 2007).
The facility will produce 1.1 million tonnes/year of ethylene,
which will be processed into polyethylene (two units with a total capacity of 800,000 tonnes/year) and monoethylene glycol

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
(550,000 tonnes/year). The companies plan to issue technology
tenders for the units.
Total will invest over $1.5 billion in the complex, which will
export most of its products. Feed gas from fields in southern Algeria will be used at the complex.
Total Chief Executive Christophe de Margerie said the project
would expand the company’s petrochemical activities based on
world-class facilities. “It signals our entry into Algeria’s petrochemical industry and strengthens the existing partnership between Total and Sonatrach in oil exploration and production.”
Total holds a 51% stake in the joint venture and Sonatrach
49%.

China’s NDRC okays Sinopec, KPC JV
China’s economic planning agency, the National Development
and Reform Commission (NDRC), has approved a joint refinery venture project between China Petroleum & Chemical Corp.
(Sinopec) and Kuwait Petroleum Corp. (KPC) in southern China’s
Guangdong province.
Sinopec last year agreed to establish a $5 billion joint venture
refinery with KPC in the Guangdong city of Nansha, with a refining capacity of as much as 15 million tones/year and an ethylene
capacity of 1 million tonnes/year.
Sinopec gave no timetable for the project, but once it is online,
NDRC has ordered Sinopec to shut down its 200,000 tonne/year
capacity ethylene facility operated by Sinopec Guangzhou.

PetroSA mulls major South Africa reﬁnery
Petroleum Oil & Gas Corp. of South Africa (PetroSA) has hired
KBR to assess the feasibility of constructing a 200,000 b/d refinery
at Coega in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, by 2014-15.
The refinery, entitled Project Mthombo, is expected to cost $6
billion. KBR described the proposal as one “of the largest post-2010
investments in South Africa.”
Under the 6-month prefeasibility study, KBR will examine the
economic optimum configuration for the refinery, including crude
oil type and costs, required product slate, prices, and specifications, and capital and operating costs. “After the configuration has
been approved, Project Mthombo will move on to the feasibility

phase, which will define the engineering scope of the refinery,”
KBR said.
Project Mthombo is an important strategic element to cut South
Africa’s reliance on imported automotive fuels. If successful, it
could be expanded to allow for products exports or other growth
opportunities and could be integrated with downstream petrochemical opportunities.

Job opportunities for 20,000 South Africans will also be available if the refinery is constructed in one of the most impoverished
provinces in the country.
PetroSA said several South Africans would work closely with
KBR on the prefeasibility study. KBR is the engineering and construction unit of Halliburton, Houston. ✦

UK’s Milford Haven gas pipeline commissioned
UK pipeline operator National Grid PLC has commissioned the
final section of the Milford Haven-Tirley pipeline, which will deliver gas from the Milford Haven LNG terminal into the national
transmission system at Tirley in Gloucestershire.
Gas transport along the 316 km pipeline will start by mid-December. National Grid completed the project in 3 years.
The Milford Haven-to-Aberdulais pipeline was commissioned
last month, and the section from Brecon to Tirley also has been
tested and filled with gas.
Opening the valve energy minister Malcolm Wicks said: “National Grid’s new pipeline will be able to carry 20% or more of the
UK’s gas needs once imports into Milford Haven start next year,
and it will also help to secure Wales’ energy supply for many years.”
In the past, Wales’s gas has been piped through England and Scotland. “Now for the first time, Wales is at the front end of the UK’s
gas supply system,” said Wicks.

Gazprom, Eni sign South Stream pipeline deal
Russia’s OAO Gazprom and Eni SPA of Italy signed an agreement to build the projected 560-mile South Stream gas pipeline
under the Black Sea and through Bulgaria.
The agreement, seen by both sides as a strategic development in
the supply of energy to Europe, was signed as part of Italian Prime
Minister Romano Prodi’s visit to Russia for talks with President
Vladimir Putin.
“Russia and Europe are interdependent. Europe needs Russia
and Russian needs Europe,” said Prodi, who added, “We need to
move as quickly as possible toward a strategic partnership.”
“The South Stream project is of strategic importance for Europe’s energy security,” Putin said. “It is being implemented based
on principles of transparency and taking into account interests of
energy suppliers and consumers,” he said. Officials from Gazprom
and Eni signed the agreement to establish 50:50 joint venture to
develop a marketing and feasibility study for the pipeline.
On completion, the $10 billion line eventually could distribute
gas to northern and southern Europe, with an estimated annual
capacity of 30 billion cu m. “The new pipeline system, which
complies with the strictest technological and environmental criteria, will significantly improve the security of supply of the whole
of Europe,” Eni CEO Paolo Scaroni said.

Gasunie joins Nord Stream, BBL consortiums
JSC Gazprom has formally accepted NV Nederlandse Gasunie into
the consortium that plans to build the 27.5 billion cu m/year Nord
Stream pipeline to deliver Russian gas to Europe starting in 2010.
10

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Gasunie also will join the partners that developed the Dutch Balgzand Bacton Line (BBL), which started operations last year and sends
gas from the Netherlands to the UK. The deal builds on a memorandum of understanding signed last October in which Gasunie expressed an interest in cooperating on Nord Stream and BBL.
Under an umbrella agreement signed Nov. 6 by both companies, Gasunie will acquire a 9% share in Nord Stream AG, with
consortium members Wintershall AG and E.On Ruhrgas AG reducing their interests by 4.5% each. Gazprom also will have an option
to acquire a 9% interest in BBL Co. When the deal is executed,
shareholdings in Nord Stream will be Gazprom with 51% share,
Wintershall and E.On Ruhrgas with 20% each, and Gasunie 9%.
According to the agreement, Gazprom also will gain access to
transport capacity within Gasunie’s network, which has an annual
throughput of about 100 billion cu m. The Netherlands’ position
as a gas hub for northwest Europe is of particular interest to Gazprom.
The revised shareholdings in BBL Co., if Gazprom utilizes its
option, will be Gasunie will keep 51%, E.On Ruhrgas and Fluxys
20% each, and Gazprom 9%. Gazprom Chairman of the Management Committee Alexei Miller and Gasunie Chief Executive Marcel
Kramer said the new partnership would enable delivery of secure
gas supplies to Europe, particularly as domestic production is falling and gas demand increasing.

Cosco Busan detained in US following spill
Audet & Partners LLP, attorneys who earlier filed a class action
lawsuit representing the fisherman, boat operators, and other alleged victims of the Nov. 7 oil spill into San Francisco Bay, have
obtained a court order authorizing the “arrest” of the Cosco Busan
to keep the vessel from leaving the country.
“Under well-established maritime law, in these circumstances,
it is appropriate to make sure the vessel involved in the oil spill
does not leave the jurisdiction of the United States,” said William
M. Audet of Audet & Partners.
The US District Court issued an order Nov. 20 granting the plaintiff attorneys’ request to arrest movement of the Cosco Busan.✦

Shale shaker screens
The article “Norwegians develop
new method to measures shaker screen
performance” indicated correctly that
the simple designation of a “mesh” size
could no longer be used when describing current shale shaker screens (OGJ,
Nov. 19, 2007, p. 37). An American
Petroleum Institute task group working
on solids control procedures also found
that the optical image size distribution
curve resembled a classic cut point curve
but failed to match field data.
The task group first sought to develop
a universal procedure similar to that
described in the OGJ article to describe
performance of shaker screens. This
seemed to have too many variables to
be universally applicable for all shaker
motions and all water-based fluids and
all nonaqueous fluids (NAFs). The most
prominent of these screen performance
modifiers is the fact that the bound
liquid layer affects the effective screen
opening size particularly with screens
having very small openings. The most
dramatic, of course, is the blinding of
these screens in a NAF when the screen
becomes water-wet. The bound layers of
wetting fluid have different thicknesses.
Some of the properties controlling
this involve surface tension properties
(that are usually not measured) and gel
strengths depending upon the viscosifiers used in the drilling fluid. This will
greatly affect the opening size for particles to pass through. The task of defining
screen performance for all fluids and all
shaker motions seemed too large for the
API task group to develop recommended
procedures (RPs) that could be universally applied.
As indicated in the article, the new
API RP 13C does not attempt to describe
shaker screen performance. The objective of the test procedure is simply to
describe a shaker screen in a reproducible manner. Aluminum oxide particles
were selected because they were the only
particles which gave reproducible results
in blind comparison tests.
Sand was the first choice because sand
can be found in abundance worldwide.
Blind comparison tests revealed that
the data was not reproducible. The next

choice was glass beads. Blind comparison tests by the service companies represented on the task group revealed that
these data were not reproducible. Glass
beads were also not a good representation of cuttings arriving at the surface
in a borehole that had adequate cuttings
carrying capacity. Rounded cuttings on
the shaker indicate poor hole-cleaning
from tumbling action in the annulus.
Aluminum oxide grit provided good reproducibility, and microscopic examination revealed that the particles resembled
shale cuttings that had been circulated
from boreholes with good hole-cleaning.
As mentioned in the article, it was
never the intention of the API task group
to describe shale shaker screen performance. API RP 13C simply provides an
indication of the largest openings in a
shaker screen. The distribution of openings does not give a good picture of
performance because the small cuttings
do not seek only holes their size. Many
go through the large openings. However, if a screen is labeled a 200 mesh,
it should retain particles larger than 75
μm. Testing with the new API procedure
revealed that many of the screens that
were labeled as 200s were not retaining particles that were 150 μm in size.
Needless to say, many manufacturers
were very upset because screen designations had to be changed from 200 to 80.
As an International Organization for
Standardization document the concept of
“mesh” would make no sense. “Mesh”
is defined as the number of openings
per inch in each direction. Changing
to metric units would mean that the
“mesh” would need to be openings
per millimeter. Clearly, rig hands would
have trouble translating this from their
previous knowledge base. This is the
reason that the new screen designation
is the alternative designation of an API
number. An API200 screen would have
the equivalent of a 200 mesh opening.
Below that number, the actual measured
largest particles retained on the screen
would be recorded in microns. The word
“mesh” is no longer being used to describe shaker screens.
While the new API RP 13C does not
give any information about performance, it would seem reasonable that a

screen that retains 75 μm dry particles
would remove more solids than a screen
which lets all of those particles pass
through.

OGJ on the move
Marilyn Radler
Senior EditorEconomics
The Houston offices of OGJ are moving this week. After 10 years at 1700
West Loop South, this staff and all other
PennWell employees in Houston will
relocate. The “old” office is abuzz with
extra activity while staffs continue to
meet daily and weekly deadlines.
The new office is across the freeway
a couple of blocks away, but the proximity doesn’t ease the transition. Or the
packing. So much material, like conference proceedings, notes, and publications, can accumulate in a decade.
The last time OGJ’s Houston staff
relocated offices, this editor had only
been on board for slightly more than
a year, and so the task of packing—
and deciding what to throw out—was
simpler. There wasn’t as much stuff on
the shelves.
But now the contents of my bookcases and filing cabinets hadn’t been
properly culled in a while. So once the
process began, it was a dusty trip back
into the oil and gas statistical world.
There were issues of world energy
forecasts from various agencies, some
dating back to, yes, 1997.
Many of the regular publications,
such as IEA’s Monthly Oil Market
Report, EIA’s Natural Gas Monthly, and
API’s Quarterly Well Completion Report,

are no longer available in print. Instead,
they are now only available to download or access online. This helps when
moving offices.
The large orange trash bin conveniently located near my office space
soon began to look like the purging of
an energy economist’s library. Following about an hour’s worth of expung-

during 2002.
Since 1997, the oil and gas markets
have seen volatility, of course. That year,
the average front-month futures price
of oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange was $20.59/bbl. The following
year the average sank to $14.42/bbl.
Last month, the closing price for
crude on the NYMEX reached as high as
$98.18/bbl. And for 2007, the frontmonth closing price will average about
$71/bbl.
Regular unleaded motor gasoline
pump prices averaged $1.23/gal during
1997, and this year the average will be
about $2.78/gal.
Worldwide demand for crude oil
has climbed more than 15% in the past
decade. According to IEA, demand averaged 73.6 million b/d 10 years ago and
will average 85.7 million b/d this year.

Looking ahead

Typical sight around the office.

ing, a couple of bookshelves looked
barer. Hopefully much of this discarded
material will be recycled.

Milestones
OGJ celebrated 100 years in print
while we occupied this office. That was

This time of year not only brings
this office move for OGJ, it also brings
forecasts for 2008. The recent climb
to near-$100/bbl for crude brought a
lot of attention to such predictions for
oil supplies and demand. How much
demand growth we can expect depends
on assumptions about the health of the
economy. Much speculation is swirling.
OGJ will publish its short-term
forecast next month. After we’re settled
in our new space, we will have a clearer
view to the future.
Our new physical and mailing address will be 1455 West Loop South,
Suite 400, Houston, TX 77027. Phone
numbers and e-mail addresses are unchanged. ✦

Energy and tax reform
A wisp of hope drifts around the murk of energy legislation under development in the US. It’s a
federal tax system on the verge of self-destruction.
As the first session of the 110th Congress approaches its end, Democratic leaders are desperate
to pass an energy bill. Because reconciliation of
disparate measures passed by the House and Senate requires a political fight no one seems to want,
the House leadership has been circulating revised
legislation they hope can pass.
The discussion draft first jettisoned then reimposed tax increases on the oil and gas industry. But
it retained a martial approach to energy markets,
with toughened fuel-economy standards for new
motor vehicles and aggressive mandates for fuels
from biological and other renewable sources.

Hamstringing markets
Like all such intrusions, these measures would
hamstring markets and reward uncompetitive
energy sources. They should be resisted. Current
experience with mandates for ethanol in vehicle
fuel—with the extraordinary pressure on corn
prices, increases in diesel demand, and erosion of
federal tax receipts—shows what happens when
politicians make fuel choices for consumers.
An essential tool of governmental fuel manipulation is the tax regime. No one will sell mandated
fuels that lose money. When the government
requires sales of uncompetitive fuels, therefore, it
must compensate the sellers. The handy way to do
this is to provide tax breaks, such as the 51¢/gal
tax credit for ethanol blenders and $1/gal credit
for producers of biodiesel. The Energy Policy Act
of 2005, in fact, is a cornucopia of tax breaks for
suppliers of politically preferred fuels and vehicles.
It’s also an affront to market efficiency.
The tax tool’s future, however, is in doubt. Two
politically intolerable tax increases loom, calling
attention to the need for systemic reform.
Next year, unless Congress acts, hoards of
middle-class taxpayers will find themselves newly
subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT).
Congress enacted the levy to ensure that the very
wealthy pay income tax. But it didn’t account for
inflation, which over time has pushed liability

thresholds into lower and lower incomes. And in
2010, again unless Congress acts, income tax bills
for many voters will leap as rate cuts enacted in
2001 and 2003 expire.
In anticipation of the AMT trap, House Ways
and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel
(D-NY) has proposed what he calls tax reform.
It’s really a huge tax hike on Americans earning
above $200,000/year to offset what Rangel sees as
revenue losses from repeal of the AMT. While Rangel’s economically poisonous measure deserves no
serious consideration, it does perform two useful
services. With its prospective increase in marginal
tax rates—those applying to new increments of
income—of nearly 5 percentage points, the initiative calls attention to flagging US competitiveness
in a crucial area. And it gives a needed push to tax
reform as a political issue.
Reform is overdue. The US tax regime is unfathomable, largely because Congress has added
layers of credits, deductions, exclusions, and other
adjustments over the years to advance political
agendas and enrich friends. For many Americans,
compliance with tax law requires guesswork or
payment to tax experts whose interpretations often
differ. The ambiguity makes a sham of the rule of
law and is reason for simplification to have occurred years ago.

Pressure for change
With millions of Americans facing two painful tax increases—one in an election year and the
other as a new President faces off-year congressional elections—pressure will grow for fundamental change, such as with a flattening of rates
or national sales levy in place of income taxation.
Either move would involve elimination of most or
all deductions and credits, which in turn would
deprive politicians of a vital lever of fuel control.
Oil and gas companies should welcome tax
reform as a way to liberate markets and give fuel
choice back to fuel consumers. Yes, reform would
deprive them of some tax breaks. But the reward
would be an energy market more resistant than it
has been to distortion by the government and to
corruption by special interests. ✦

Robust oil and gas prices have
contributed to an abundance of capital readily available to the oil and gas
industry through the public equity market, the private equity market, and bank
financing. An independent producer
must negotiate a maze of financing options.
John Schaeffer, managing director
and head of oil and gas investing at GE
Energy Financial Services, sees “a plethora”
of financing choices for
small oil and gas companies.
“There have never
been more options for
the small producer to
get financing, and it’s never been more
confusing,” Schaeffer said. He believes
independents now have the most
financing options available since 1975
when he entered the energy finance
business.
Any financing product introduced
since the 1970s is available currently, he

Financing Energy Supply

Currently, $50/bbl for benchmark
US light, sweet crudes on the New York
Mercantile Exchange is considered low.
The year-to-date price for oil as of late
November was $70/bbl, he said.
“Prices in the high $90s to $100/
bbl and over push both the economy
and geopolitics into uncharted waters,”
Burkhard said. “The unprecedented $30
surge in oil prices since August—from
$70 to $100—reflects a sharpening
mix of concerns about the value of the
dollar, the adequacy of oil supplies, and
economic weakness—combined with
an Iran premium.”
He said if oil prices were to average $110/bbl for 6 months, it would
increase the world economy’s vulnerability to a serious downturn of the
early 1980s. But he foresees some limits
on oil demand.
“It’s likely that by the end of that
timeframe, it would be that demand
had softened. Then, the market would
react to that softening, and prices could
come off that $100 mark,” Burkhard
said.
Another scenario is that oil supply difficulties or perceived difficulties
could offset any demand weakening, he
noted.
“But if the level of supply anxiety
stays roughly where it is today, and
there is no worsening of that anxiety,
then demand could begin to pull prices
down after several months,” Burkhard
said.

Various investors available

said, adding that this includes master
limited partnerships (MLPs) for upstream companies.
James Burkhard, managing director

loans while small companies and startups require public equity as well. The
two main types of private capital are equity and mezzanine or structured debt.
Forms of mezzanine financing include subordinated debt, project debt,
preferred stock, and volumetric production payments.
“People who are willing to do mezzanine finance historically show up
when the prices are good and disappear
when prices aren’t so good,” Schaeffer
said.
Numerous private equity options are
available. Private equity providers invest
in oil companies, often taking 50-80%
ownership of a company. Schaeffer said
the GE product does not require the
small producer to dilute ownership.
It remains to be seen how long current levels of ample capital will remain
available for oil and gas companies,
Schaeffer said, adding that some financial providers not backed by big companies such as GE might not remain as
aggressive energy investors.
“Word on the street is that some of
the money available to producers for
exploration and production financing
is being pulled because some of the
people who put that money up need

said. “I have no crystal ball.”

concept will get much bigger, although
it will go through fits and starts.”
“In the 1980s, over 100 MLPs were
formed, of which 31 were upstream
MLPs. We believe that E&P MLPs could
again represent at least 30% of the MLPs
in this era,” Soler told participants of an
Independent Petroleum Association of
America seminar in August.
The MLP structure will continue to
attract private equity because oil and
gas fundamentals remain strong, offering investors above-market rates of
return, he said.
Quantum Energy reports that during 1995-98, six energy private equity
firms collectively raised $2.57 billion to
fund overall energy investments. During
2005-06, seven energy private equity
firms raised $16 billion to finance energy investments.

IFC promotes economic growth
in developing countries by financing
private sector investment, mobilizing
capital in international financial markets, and providing advisory services to
businesses and governments.
Lance Crist, IFC’s head of oil and gas
investments, said IFC’s role evolves over
time, and it represents a stable, longterm source of capital. The role of IFC
varies on a project-by-project basis.
IFC sometimes is an equity investor and sometimes is a lender. It offers
a large range of financial instruments
from senior debt to quasiequity and
equity investments and also works with
banks worldwide to set up large syndicated loans for IFC clients.
“In times of high capital availability,
we become more selective in working
with more junior players who are less
able to access international markets,
and where we can support best practice environmental and social standards
and meeting community development
needs,” Crist said. “We adjust our approach according to liquidity.”
IFC is BPZ’s second-largest shareholder, owning 10% of the company’s
stock. BPZ also relied upon private
placements of common stock, primarily with institutional investors in the US
and a few in Europe.
Recently, BPZ closed on $15.5 million convertible debt financing with
IFC. This is the first tranche of a threetranche IFC loan package worth an
estimated $165 million that will enable
BPZ to continue developing Corvina
field.
BPZ’s gas-to-power project involves
the generation and sale of electricity in
Peru along with gas sales into Ecuador
for third-party power generation. This
project is being done parallel with developing Corvina oil field and redeveloping Albacora oil field.
Manolo Zuniga, BPZ president and
chief executive officer, said IFC’s commitment and BPZ’s production revenue
helped BPZ grow without accessing
equity capital markets.
Zuniga said the company’s transparency and experience in monetiz24

ing gas has helped attract financing.
Initially, the company was funded by a
reverse merger transaction in 2004 that
transformed BPZ into a publicly traded
company.
BPZ has license agreements for oil

properties in northwestern Peru. It
also owns a minority working interest

MegaWest and heavy oil
A start-up company is working to
develop heavy oil in the US. MegaWest
Energy USA Corp., a unit of MegaWest
Energy Corp. of Calgary, used an OTC

Special Report

Bulletin Board company and a series of
private placements for its initial funding.
“MegaWest emphasizes the redevelopment of large bypassed US heavy
oil projects,” said George Stapleton,
president and chief executive officer.
The company plans to use the best thermal recovery technologies developed in
Canada.
During December 2006, the founders of what is now MegaWest bought
Brockton Capital Corp. to establish a
means to raise capital and acquire properties. Brockton—an inactive company
that once sold keyboards for personal
digital assistants—became a heavy oil
company.
Brockton Capital entered into a
series of letters of intent for property
acquisitions. In February, the company
changed its name to MegaWest.
Through December 2006 to March
2007, MegaWest organizers raised $34
million through three private placements and issued a number of share
purchase warrants. If the warrants are
exercised, Megawest has potential additional proceeds of nearly $23 million.
As of late November, the company
had acquired four US heavy oil project
areas with operatorship and ownership
or the right to earn an interest in over
100,000 acres in Texas, Kentucky, Montana, Missouri, and Kansas. The property
acquisition strategy continues.
MegaWest produces 100-150 b/d
of 18-20º gravity oil through the
Chetopa pilot project in Labette County
in southeastern Kansas. MegaWest has
100% interest in Chetopa field where
producing sands are analogous to Bluejacket and Warner sands in Missouri.
In October, MegaWest Energy USA
closed a deal for over 33,000 acres in
Montana for an estimated $2.25 million, including cash, shares, a carried
work interest, and warrants.
Stapleton believes MegaWest can
acquire heavy oil assets cheaper in the
US than in Canada.
“The last 2-3 years, there has been
tremendous interest in the oil sands of
Canada,” he said. Operators in Canada

ist admitted. He said agreement looks
closer on new Corporate Average Fuel
Efficiency (CAFE) requirements than on
renewable fuels and ethanol.
Another said House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi (D-Calif.) wants to see an energy
bill with an environmental component
such as higher CAFE standards before
the 2007 session ends. “Some people
have told me, including a member
yesterday, that she has quit talking about
the killer provisions” that the Natural
Resources Committee passed, he said.
“So the question is whether they
have been dropped, or if they simply will be tucked into the bill later.
Our best hope is for the first bill to
go through without the unfavorable
provisions so we can be ready to fight
them in a second bill,” the lobbyist said,
adding that lawmakers will be under
heavy pressure to find revenue sources
for new programs.

my sincere hope that we pass an energy

A renewable fuels component could
be more elusive, particularly since
federal lawmakers seem significantly

“You have the ‘food and fodder’ guys

that the enthusiasm for moving forward

industry lobbyist said.

Climate debate
and gas prices

US

gas utilities are closely
watching the way global
climate change legislation evolves
because it potentially will affect the
price of gas supplies.
“More and more electric utilities are using natural gas to generate
power, which is a problem for local
distribution companies (LDCs),” said
American Gas Association Pres. David
N. Parker. LDCs don’t benefit, because
power generators deal directly with
producers. Increased demand simply
leads to higher prices for gas utilities,
Parker said during an AGA meeting
with Washington energy reporters.
The climate change debate indicates more gas use in power generation, added David M. McClanahan,
president and chief executive of CenterPoint Energy Inc. in Houston and
AGA’s 2008 chairman. “The energy
industry has gone through a seismic
shift. Climate change is coming at us,
and the country is discussing how
it gets and uses its resources,” he
observed.
“With the first new nuclear plant
at least 15 years away—although
we’re on the cusp of building
more—the electric industry is going
to use more gas,” McClanahan said.
“A 20% increase is likely in the next
15-20 years if it expects to meet its
customers’ needs. That’s going to put
more pressure on supplies.”

McClanahan said.
The US will need to import more
LNG, although competition from
other countries could be heavy, he
added. “The shale plays in Oklahoma
and Arkansas are good news. We’re
holding our own in production for
the first time in decades.”
AGA and its members were mildly
concerned as 2007 began because
Democrats were due to take control
of Congress. “The election created a
different environment,” said Parker.
With the year nearly through, it looks
as if gas utilities were more successful
dealing with regulators, particularly
in states, than with federal lawmakers, he said.

Decoupling rates

“We have reduced consumption,
but we’re being asked to reduce
it more. So we have to decouple
prices,” McClanahan said. “We have
to get away from our companies’
financial health being tied to the
volumes they deliver.” Decoupling is
a regulatory step that treats a utility’s recovery of fixed costs separately
from volumes delivered.
Looking at proposed legislation,
McClanahan expressed concerns.
“Cap-and-trade could affect gas
consumption. We want to be constructive, but we also are part of the
solution,” he said. “We have to work
with the policy-makers and have a

“The proposed legislation also

said. ✦

the Caspian Sea—360 km via Turkmenistan and another 150 km through
Kazakhstan—and connect with the
existing Central Asia-Center gas pipeline
network on the Russian-Kazakh border.
The decision to accelerate construction of the line followed reports that
Gazprom on Nov. 27 signed a contract
amendment for the supply of gas from
Turkmenistan.
Under the amendment, the price
of gas in first half 2008 will be
$130/1,000 cu m and will rise to $150
in the second half. Starting Jan. 1, 2008,
the rate will be determined by a price
formula based on market principles.
Earlier Russia and Turkmenistan had
agreed on $100/1,000 cu m for the
period ending in 2009.
“The price formula that will come
into force in 2009 will define the
price of supplies under a long-term
contract up to 2028,” said Gazprom’s
Miller. “The Turkmen side expressed the
readiness to increase the volume of gas
supply to Gazprom, compared with the
volume of the current year.”
Following the announced price
increase, Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia’s ambassador to Ukraine, said the
increase will be passed on to customers
in that country, the main recipient of
Turkmen gas via Russia.
“Naturally, the gas price for Ukraine
will also be changed. We do not know
yet what price they agreed upon,” said
Chernomyrdin, who expressed surprise
at the new rate. ✦

Corruption
feeds on oil

T

hese days, it is very fashionable
to unmask corruption in the oil
and gas industry. Consider a recent
conference in South Africa where international experts argued that oil has
all too often proved a curse to Africa,
greasing the palms of foreign firms as
well as corrupt national leaders.
“Oil wealth is a mild toxin,
much like alcohol. If you don’t have
a strong constitution, it tends to
make you unstable,” said Diarmid
O’Sullivan of London-based Global
Witness at the conference held by
the South African Institute of International Affairs.

the Africa program at Britain’s Royal
Institute for International Affairs, Angola is the world’s leading importer

ruption in connection with oil and
gas revenues. Look at the news about
Turkmenistan, where former President Saparmurat Niyazov’s opacity
and 21-year misrule are said to have
turned his gas-rich country into Central Asia’s version of North Korea.
In April 2006, Global Witness
published a report entitled “It’s a
Gas,” which revealed Turkmen bank
accounts at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt, thought to contain a staggering
$3 billion or more in oil, gas, and
cotton revenues.

Accountability low

by Niyazov himself, and none of this

Offshore energy insurers have traditionally been defined by their willingness to take risk without relying on
technical analysis to model or quantify
their exposure.

and rigs not including business interruption and operator extra expense
losses.

Catastrophic modeling
The purpose of catastrophe modeling is to anticipate the likelihood and
severity of potential future events so
that companies can prepare for their
financial impact.
Physical damage, business interruption, and contingent business interruption losses depend on both subjective
and objective inputs related to natural
and man-made conditions. Probabilistic modeling allows the frequency and
severity of potential hurricane losses to
be quantified so that rational pricing
and risk decisions can be made.

Design codes
Hurricanes have played a significant
role in the design evolution of offshore
structures, since the most significant
learning and subsequent changes to
standards has come from the performance of facilities during hurricanes.2

Across the water depth categories
0-200 ft, 201-1,000 ft, 1,000+ ft,
structure exposure is roughly uniform
(Table 4). Drilling rig exposure is concentrated in the deep water, where the
most expensive and sophisticated rigs
operate.
About half of the total exposure in
the gulf is concentrated in six geographic regions, in Green Canyon 15%,

be different from the actual losses for
these events. Hurricane Andrew would
be expected to cause structure and
contents damage of $2.3 billion if it
were to occur today; Hurricane Camille
would cause $1.6 billion in property
damage.

Offshore exposure
It may be interesting to speculate
on what the loss today would be from
another Hurricane Camille or Andrew,
but since these events have a near-zero
probability of occurrence, the more interesting question involves the expected
losses from potential future events.
The annual exceedance probability

Physical damage
High wind speed, high wave height,
and landslides are the main weatherrelated threats to offshore infrastructure
(Fig. 2). Failure of primary structural
components such as main braces, jacket
legs, deck legs, and piles often leads to
listing or capsized units. Deck inundation increases the horizontal load and
overturning moment, resulting in the
potential failure of structural members
and collapse. Bottom-current loading or
foundation failure may also lead to failure because of soil instability and mud
slide conditions. Moorings on mobile
offshore drilling units may fail, setting
units adrift.
Vulnerability assessment is an estimate of losses due to physical damage,
business interruption, and contingent
business interruption. Physical damage is generally easier to model than
business interruption and contingent
business interruption, since the losses
are localized, and vulnerability curves
can be constructed based on historical
data and physical models.
Historic storm events can be used to
estimate the risk posed to an individual
structure, a portfolio of platforms,
regional assets, or the entire gulf inventory. For the current gulf inventory of
structures and rigs, we examine the impact of historical storm events, leading
to the ground-up loss estimates shown
in Table 5.

Site clearance and

comprise the last stage of
offshore decommissioning in which abandoned
well and platform locaProduction
tions are cleared of all
debris remaining from
oil and gas activities. Net trawling
uses a reinforced net assembly that is
dragged along the ocean bottom to pick
up debris.
This final of two articles on decommissioning oil and gas platforms in the
US Gulf of Mexico presents descriptive
statistics based on 308 net-trawling jobs
performed between 2001and 2005,
updating previous analysis covering
1997-2001.1 (The first part appears in
OGJ, Dec. 3, 2007, p. 44.) We summarize costs relative to structure type
and water-depth categories and discuss
factors that impact the cost of SC&V
operations.

Federal regulations
In the US, federal regulations require
that all wells and offshore structures in
the Outer Continental Shelf be completely removed to a depth 15 ft (5 m)
below the seafloor within 1 year after
production on the lease ceases. After
wells are plugged and abandoned and
the structure is removed, regulations
require that the site be cleared and
verified “clear” by an independent third
party.
A variety of techniques may be used
to perform SC&V operations, but net
trawling and diver survey are the most
common in the Gulf of Mexico.
In diver salvage, divers identify
targets and attach lift lines to the debris,
and a crane on a surface support vessel
lifts the debris from the water bottom
and places it on deck for subsequent
disposal on land.
Net trawling uses conventional trawling techniques with a reinforced net assembly to pick up debris. Net-trawling
operations offer advantages in analysis
relative to diver surveys because net
trawling focuses exclusively on clearance and verification and the data are

transparent and easy to interpret. Diving
spreads typically perform many different services throughout decommissioning, and it is usually not possible
to isolate clearance services from other
activities, such as structure preparation,
pipeline cutting, dredging, and others.
In 1981, the US Minerals Management Service introduced site-clearance
regulations for the Gulf of Mexico
Region.
Current gulf
OCS siteclearance

are performed in
accordance
with the MMS GOM Region Notice to
Lessees 92-02.
According to MMS regulations, all
abandoned well and platform locations
in water depths less than 300 ft (91 m)
must be cleared of all obstructions present as a result of oil and gas activities.2
Clearance requirements are specified
according to well and structure type:
• Temporarily abandoned wells;
working radius centered on the well.
• Delineation or exploratory wells
drilled with a mobile offshore drilling unit; 300-ft (91-m) radius circle
centered on the well.
• Single-well caissons and well protectors; 600-ft (183-m) radius centered
on the well.
• Platforms; 1,320-ft (402-m)
radius centered on the geometric center
of the facility.
For temporarily abandoned wells,
the operator must protect the apparatus
with a net guard. To establish the effectiveness of the guard, standard shrimptrawling nets are pulled over the device
to ensure 100% coverage. For a delineation or exploratory well, clearance can
be verified with a trawl or a 500-khz
sonar search scan.
The MMS-preferred clearance-verification technique for structures is to
drag a standard trawl net across 100%
of the site in two directions with each
pass 80 ft (24 m) apart. According to
federal regulations, trawls should be

CONDENSATE EAST OF SUEZ:
NGL and its Naphtha Impacts in
Asia Pacific and Mideast Gulf
Condensate and the Light-End Products Squeeze
By Asia Paciﬁc Energy Consulting

• This is the “deﬁnitive” report on
condensate in the fastest growing,
critical regions of the world, Asia
Paciﬁc and the Mideast Gulf.
• The study provides a complete guide
to optimizing value in future condensate production, utilization, and trade.

Condensate coming into its own
Condensate, one of the two groups
deﬁned as Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs),
is ﬁnally coming of age in world trade,
marketing, reﬁning and petrochemicals. Condensate sales are moving
from a niche marketing specialty to
a mainstream segment of crude and
products trade, and nowhere is this
more evident than in the Mideast Gulf
and Asia Paciﬁc.
This report explains how the protean
nature of condensate allows it to be
used in a wide range of sectors: as a
reﬁnery slate component; in specialized distillation towers called condensate splitters; in direct feed to ethylene crackers; in gasoline blending and
as a substitute for gas in turbine power generation. It can be deﬁned as a
base material, a blending component,
a feedstock or a boiler feed.

THE RETHINKING CONTINUES
By rethinking recovery methods, producers have brought to a hungry market gas from reservoirs
once considered economically and technically impossible. Tight gas sands, shales, and coalbeds
now represent large and growing sources of an essential form of clean energy. But they’re still
unconventional. The reservoirs are complex. The costs of drilling into and completing wells in them
are high and rising. They present unique environmental problems. Producing gas from unconventional
reservoirs proﬁtably, safely, and in amounts demanded by the market requires continuous rethinking the kind of thinking that shoves back limits on what’s possible with gas supply.
Rethinking of recovery methods will continue Sept. 30 - Oct. 2, 2008, at the Unconventional Gas
International Conference & Exhibition at the Hilton Fort Worth in Fort Worth, Texas. Planned by
editors of Oil & Gas Journal and an advisory board of industry experts, the event will highlight
innovation from unconventional gas plays around the world. It will be your chance to meet and
learn from other professionals in the fastest-growing sector of the gas-producing industry.
Don’t miss this opportunity to present your ideas to a powerful, inﬂuential audience. Join PennWell

increase the refinery’s unleaded gasoline
capacity by 8,000 b/d, and the unit’s
down time will be reduced. The CCR
project’s construction was completed in
June 2006.

Yanbu reﬁnery
The Yanbu refinery is a hydroskimming refinery on the west coast of
Saudi Arabia. The refinery started up in
1983 with a capacity of 170,000 b/d
to satisfy local demand for petroleum
products.
Currently, the refinery processes
235,000 b/d of Arabian Light crude
and produces about 295,000 b/d of
petroleum products, including imports.
Production includes fuel oil, low-sulfur
diesel, two grades of premium gasoline,
LPG, jet fuel, and butane.
The Yanbu process units include atmospheric crude distillation, LPG Merox,
heavy straight-run naphtha (HSRN)
hydrotreating, reformer and CCR, light
straight-run naphtha (LSRN) hydrotreating, isomerization, saturation-gas concentration unit (SGCU), amine treating,
and diesel hydrotreating (DHT).
Fig. 1 shows a flow diagram of the
Yanbu refinery.

Fixed-bed reformer
The Yanbu reformer was originally
designed as a fixed-bed unit to process
35,000 b/d of HSRN and to produce
26,250 b/d of platformate at 94 RON.
In 1995, the unit throughput rate was
increased to 38,000 b/d and an operating severity of 96 RONC. The unit was
shutdown every 6-8 months as part of
a cycle to regenerate and restore the
activity of the platforming catalyst.
The reformer originally consisted
of three fixed-bed reactors that used
UOP platforming R-56 catalyst. The unit
reheat section has one charge heater
and two interheaters to maintain the
required reaction temperature at each
catalyst bed. In addition, four vertical
combined-feed exchangers preheat the
charge feed and cool the last reactor effluent product platformate.

the hydrotreating units. The unit has a
gas-liquid separator to separate the rich
gas from the product liquid platformate.

Revamp objectives
In October 2002, Saudi Aramco approved a capital project to convert the
old fixed-bed reformer to a CCR unit.
Foster Wheeler performed the project
proposal and detailed design, procurement, and construction was awarded to
Snamprogetti.
The revamp’s main objective was to
increase the volume of the refinery’s
unleaded gasoline pool to help meet
Saudi Arabian gasoline demands and
to reduce imports. The additional 95
RON gasoline production specification
amounted to about 8,000 b/d and the
annual revenue will be in the millions.
The additional production reduces
the requirement for expensive purchased blending components such as
MTBE and allows for blending of higher
volumes of LSRN, butane, and other
lower-cost components into the gasoline pool. The revamp also increases the
unit service factor because downtime
for regenerations will be eliminated.
The revamped unit performs the
same function—reforming heavy
naphtha to high-octane reformate. The
revamped CCR reformer produces 100
RON platformate at 75.5% C5+ yield,
230.3 cu m hydrogen/cu m of feed,
and at a 40,000 b/d charge rate. The
old fixed-bed reformer production was
96 RON at 76% yield and 38,000 b/d
maximum charge rate.
Continuous catalyst regeneration
maintains RON, yield, and charge rate
capability without the need for regeneration downtime.

Revamp strategy
After completing all construction and precommissioning activities,
Saudi Aramco planned to shut down
the old fixed-bed unit to perform the
required modifications to change the

unit configuration to CCR. Also during
the shutdown, regeneration of the old
catalyst was completed before starting
the mechanical activities. Regeneration
of the old catalyst was done to prepare
the catalyst for dumping, screening, and
platinum recovery.
The regeneration included only the
carbon burn step without chloride
injection, which saved about $12,000.
The regeneration was completed successfully and the carbon level after
carbon burn was 0.35 wt %.
After completing the regeneration,
the old fixed catalyst R-56 was unloaded and screened for metal recovery.
Then the old three reactors were de-

molished. About 256 mechanical tie-ins
were completed during this shutdown,
which took 28 days to complete.

Revamped reformer
The Yanbu fixed-bed reformer unit
was revamped to CCR on June 2006.
The major changes for this conversion
were:
• Reforming stacked reactors. The old series reforming fixed-bed reactors were
replaced with three new reforming
stacked reactors. The important feature
of the stacked reactors is the low pressure drop to facilitate the catalyst movement from the reactor to the regenerator. The design pressure drop is 0.24,

Lessons learned
During the revamp, we experienced
several obstacles, but preparedness and
teamwork effectively minimized their
effect on the project. Here are the major
lessons learned from the experiences of
this revamp project:
• Implement a team approach
and culture for other projects. Project
stakeholders included project managment team, Yanbu refinery, contractors,
loss-prevention employees, inspectors,
and other parties. Traditionally, the various stakeholders had different interests,
lack of common objectives, lack of
transparency, and inadequate planning
and communication. This often led to
project delays. Saudi Aramco initiated
the team concept for this project, integrating all stakeholders into one overall
team.
Benefits of the team concept included reduced project costs because everybody worked for the same company;
shared and achieved common objectives; prepared planning and coordination for common activities such as the
distributed control system, instrumentation, electrical, etc.; and it created a
positive environment for operations.
• Use an automated mechanical completion acceptance system to
manage exception items and mechanical completion certificate approvals.

Previous projects used a conventional
manual hardcopy report system for
tracking exception items. Yanbu projects
have successfully used an automated
system automatically to log, track, and
close exception items.
The automated system helped us expedite exception item handling through
an easy-to-use system, improve transparency, achieve project accountability,
support focusing on project completion
and closure, better track exception items,
generate many variety of useful reports,
reduce documentation, and save time.
• Ensure consistencies in vendor
data. During commissioning, we observed that one of the equipment nameplate recommend using an oil-type
material while the equipment document and manual referred to different
material types. The team contacted the
vendor, which confirmed that the manual was correct. Equipment nameplate
and manuals should match each other.
• Consider inspecting equipment.
One of the vessels failed during startup. The investigation revealed that there
was no requirement governing the internal inspection of vessels. We learned
that the vendor and plant owner should
inspect vessel interiors to avoid unexpected problems. ✦

The COESD section plan and available

define the COESD procedures to further
minimize a potential oil spill in an
emergency. Integrating COESD section
plans and procedures within sophisticated GIS systems provides main control
center operators with straightforward
access to these procedures.

Background
COESD procedures form the first part
of the overall emergency intervention
procedure plan mandatory for every oil
pipeline. The COESD procedure contains
mainly remote-controlled operational
actions. The second part consists of
the oil spill emergency response plan,
which lies outside the focus of this
article.
Fig. 1 provides an overview for
the organizational implementation of
COESD procedures.
The release of COESD procedures has
priority over the release of an oil spill
emergency response plan. The release of
both plans, however, may occur simultaneously so long as this does not delay
the COESD.

Shutdown criteria
The two general
classifications of shutdown include a normal
(operational) shutdown and an emergency shutdown.
A normal shutdown
occurs upon either operational instructions
or detection of failure
or faults on safety
equipment. A COESD
occurs upon detection
of leaks or suspected
leaks or in case of
danger or potential
damage.
Emergency shutdowns usually cause
higher operational load
variations, subsequent
operational faults, and
longer downtimes,
leading to higher costs
than normal stops.
Management should

The individual sections of the
pipeline covering the threat location, as
identified on the section plan, should
always be as short as possible.
Besides the code number in the
COESD procedure heading of each section, the catalogue of COESD procedures also shows the type of station or
important hydraulic points and their
location in total pipeline kilometers
for the beginning and the end of each
section.
The procedure heading also shows
the worst-case oil spill within sections
B, C, and D. The actual scale of any spill
depends on the exact location of the
leak.
When completing measures for
individual sections described in the
catalogue of COESD procedures to be
executed, operators must adhere strictly
to the specified control sequence.

the particular measures to be taken.
These measures are defined in the catalogue of COESD procedures to be executed (Fig. 3). Depending on pipeline
length and elevation profile the number
of individual COESD procedures could
easily reach 400 or more.

In order to assist the pipeline operator in a timely manner, especially in
emergency situations, COESD procedures should be easily accessible
within a modern electronic database.
The database tool should provide quick
access to relevant COESD section plan
drawings as well as to the identified
COESD procedures. Combining the
COESD procedures and section plans
with other information sources and
databases inside a GIS data warehouse
provides the control center operator
with a powerful tool.
A simple Microsoft Office database
application can provide this functionality early in a project (e.g., during
pipeline commissioning or line-fill
activities). During operation, however,
the database must also support crossreferences with other geographical
pipeline information (e.g., maps with
pipeline markers, right-of-way records,
a land registry database, etc.), requiring
use of a modern GIS system.
The pipeline-specific requirements
of the operator typically guide design
of this kind of system. Figs. 4-5 show
screenshots from the 348-km, 28-in.

Studies won’t
ﬁx unintended
consequences
What does a government do when
unintended consequences highlight its
mistakes? It conducts a study.
Democrats in the US House of Representatives adopt this approach to problemsolving in draft energy legislation they’re
circulating while Congress is in recess.
They want to act on energy despite
the growing likelihood that disparate bills

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

passed by the House and Senate won’t be
reconciled. One of many problems of those
bills is a wildly prescriptive approach to fuel
choice, a matter best left to markets.
One version of the draft legislation
is even more prescriptive and therefore
worse. It mandates sales volumes higher
than current levels for renewable fuel,
advanced biofuels, cellulosic biofuel, and
biomass-based diesel.
Confusion doesn’t end with the multiple
categories. The requirements include market share thresholds and tests for greenhouse gas abatement. There are tradeoffs
and a system for earning and trading
credits in years when supplies don’t meet
target levels.
In short, the legislation is a formula:
target volumes and secondary requirements growing as a function of time. That
21st-century adults think fuel markets can
be managed this way is astonishing. That
anyone thinks they should be is appalling.
In less than 2 years, formulaic renewable-fuel requirements of the Energy Policy
Act of 2005 have made a mess. Leaping
demand has raised the price of corn while
a government-sponsored building binge
brought too much corn-based ethanol to
market too fast. So corn farmers are getting
rich, while distillers and taxpayers are getting squeezed. Food prices are soaring.
Except for the enrichment of corn growers, these are unintended consequences—
market distortions born of government
activism.
And the House would respond with
more activism—higher and more complex
mandates. It thus answers a mistake with a
bigger mistake of the same species.
The discussion draft, though, offers
something new. It calls for periodic studies
of the legislation’s market and environmental effects. That way, lawmakers can have a
record of their handiwork’s consequences.
There will be many of them if Congress
passes an energy bill like the one now
making the rounds, all costly—unintended,
perhaps, but not unforeseen.

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

NYMEX suffers week of losses
During Nov. 26-30, the last full week of trading prior to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ Dec. 5 meeting, the front-month contract for benchmark
US light, sweet crudes “suffered in absolute terms” both its largest weekly change
and largest weekly decline ever, said Olivier Jakob, managing director of Petromatrix
GMBH, Zug, Switzerland.
The January US crude contract dropped a total $9.47/bbl during the week, closing at $88.71/bbl Nov. 30 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That surpassed “by
exactly $1/bbl the collapse of March 2003 that followed conﬁrmation of the strike on
Iraq,” Jakob said. The January IPE contract for North Sea Brent crude was “relatively
stronger” with a loss of $7.50/bbl over the week to close at $88.26/bbl.
Despite the sharp drop in near-month crude prices, the Societe Generale Group,
Paris, said the 5-year forward price was more resilient, declining to $83-84/bbl from
$85-86/bbl in that period. “The backwardation has become signiﬁcantly shallower,
and in fact the low point on the forward curve is now December 2010; beyond this
date, the curve is in shallow contango. The ﬂattening of the curve indicates growing
uncertainty about how tight the near-term physical markets will be and about the
direction of front-month prices,” said SGG analysts.
The market provided mixed signals during the week. The NYMEX sweet, light
crudes contract dropped $3.80 to $90.62/bbl Nov. 28 after federal ofﬁcials reported
the ﬁfth draw of US oil supplies in 6 weeks. But even as analysts were predicting the
market’s loss of momentum would prevent another surge toward $100/bbl crude,
an explosion and ﬁre shut down a key pipeline system transporting 1.5 million b/d
crude from Canada to Midwest US reﬁneries—representing 15% of total US oil imports. As a result, crude futures prices jumped to $95.17/bbl in overnight electronic
trading, again illustrating how quickly a potential threat to oil supplies can turn a
volatile market.
Enbridge Energy Partners LP, Houston, reported two employees died in an explosion and ﬁre on its oil pipeline system 3 miles southeast of its Clearbrook, Minn.,
terminal Nov. 28. All four pipelines in that system were immediately shut down and
isolated.
News of the mishap prompted speculation that the US government would offer
emergency supplies from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve while OPEC might increase production. But by Nov. 29, Enbridge had restarted three of the four lines and
said the line where the explosion and ﬁre occurred should return to service in a few
days. Cause of the mishap was still under investigation in early December.
But fast action in restarting most of the pipeline system helped cool the market,
with the January crude price climbing to $91.02/bbl Nov. 29 on NYMEX. Since a
major disruption of crude supplies to Midwest reﬁneries “did not materialize,” the
market quickly resumed “its corrective pattern,” Jakob noted.
Waiting for OPEC
Through late November and early December, crude prices were “exposed to
sound-bite headlines” of the possible outcome of the OPEC meeting. SGG analysts
acknowledged the possibility OPEC might raise crude production quotas. However,
they said, “We are skeptical about signiﬁcant, sustained actual output increases.”
More likely, they said, “OPEC will keep crude supply fairly tight. Production will not
exceed the current quarter’s 31.2 million b/d in any quarter next year and will be cut
back in the second and third quarters.”
SGG analysts said there was “no reason for OPEC to change its strategy of tight
crude stocks and backwardation, especially with growth in NGLs output and with
prices easing from current levels.” They therefore predict US crudes will average $81/
bbl in 2008, up from $72/bbl in 2007. “Geopolitical risk also is expected to support
prices next year. Price premiums will wax and wane, depending on developments.
Nigeria, Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia are the usual suspects [for political risks]. Russia
and Venezuela add spice to the mix,” SGG analysts said.
Jakob said, however, “We need to keep in mind that [Saudi Arabia] surprised
everybody by sponsoring a 500,000 b/d increase at the [Sept. 11] meeting. At the
time West Texas Intermediate was trading between $75/bbl and $78/bbl with a low of
$68.60/bbl 2 weeks before the meeting, and by increasing production OPEC took the
risk of a drop to $65/bbl.” He said, “This time around WTI has been trading between
$95/bbl and $98/bbl with a low of $88.45/bbl 1 week before the meeting. We are still
$20/bbl higher than the acceptable price levels set at the last meeting while the fear
of economic recession is much stronger.”

“We are very pleased to have helped open up the deepwater business

oﬀshore Sabah, Malaysia through ﬁrst exploration and now ﬁrst oil produc-

tion. The successful commissioning of Malaysia’s ﬁrst deepwater development marks a signiﬁcant milestone for us and our partner Petronas Carigali.
The Kikeh Field is a demonstration of our team’s expertise and our dedication and commitment to the long term development of Malaysia’s oil and
gas resources.
With all that has been accomplished, I believe that we have demonstrated
how global expertise infused with homegrown capabilities can work seamlessly to bring the country
one step closer to becoming South East Asia’s deepwater hub.

”

“We were delighted when we made Malaysia’s ﬁrst deepwater oil discovery

in July 2002 and to have it come on stream within ﬁve years is a tremendous
accomplishment. Despite being one of the most challenging deepwater
developments, Kikeh has set exemplary records and standards in safety, ex-

ecution and timing. We could not have achieved this if we didn’t set ourselves
high standards from the onset of the project.
I would like to thank the entire Kikeh team for their hardwork, dedication and
professionalism on this project.

alaysia and Murphy Oil’s future changed with
the discovery of the Kikeh ﬁeld in 2002. As
Malaysia’s ﬁrst deepwater project, Kikeh brought the
country new opportunities for technology transfer
and greater interest from the oil and gas industry
looking for new hydrocarbon reserves. For Murphy
Oil, Kikeh represented a project that eventually will
double the company’s oil production.

Asia,” said Roger W. Jenkins, Vice
President for Sabah Operations
of Murphy Sabah Oil. “Two more
delineated wells conﬁrmed the
Kikeh prospect, estimated initially
to be in excess of 400 million barrels of high quality crude oil.”

Planning and development
On July 30, 2002, Murphy Sabah Oil Co Ltd, using Diamond Oﬀshore’s semi-submersible drilling rig Ocean
Baroness, made Malaysian history with the Kikeh No.
1 well. Until this time, Malaysians only knew “kikeh” as
a small deepwater ﬁsh, but Murphy’s Kikeh development soon became known as a project that featured
many industry innovations and one that would
become Malaysia’s ﬁrst deepwater project.

Jenkins immediately began building a team to manage one of the largest resource developments in
Southeast Asia. The original three-man project team
of 2002 eventually evolved into a core group of top
professionals leading a staﬀ of more than 85 people.

Located 65 nautical miles north of the eastern Malaysian state of Sabah, the development was discovered
in Block K in water depth of 1,320 meters.

“For most of 2003, we planned and drilled four appraisal wells and carried out a well test for what is
today an eight-reservoir large ﬁeld,” Jenkins said. “We
were quick to ﬁnish development plans, and by 2007
had completed and developed the ﬁeld in ﬁve short
years from discovery — a new industry benchmark.”

“It was our third deepwater well oﬀshore Malaysia,
and we knew early we had a major discovery on our
hands — an exciting challenge for Murphy to grow in

The project, with an estimated US$1.7 billion in
investment, was sanctioned in April 2004, while

its parent, the Malaysian national oil
corporation, Petroliam Nasional Berhad
(Petronas), approved the ﬁeld development plan in November 2004.
Steve Dechant, the
Kikeh Project Facilities Manager helped
craft the contracting
strategy to put the
project in the fast
lane. “The strategy
involved a small team approach that allows for timely decision making and clear
accountability,” says Dechant. The team
was committed to selecting experienced
and qualiﬁed contractors with a good
industry track record. “Being Malaysia’s

team wanted to “lock in” to fixed prices with
the busy outlook for the oil and gas industry in
2004 and beyond.
“Murphy awarded major contracts in December 2004
for the Floating Production, Storage and Oﬄoading (FPSO) vessel, and the Dry Tree Unit (DTU),” said
Jenkins. In early 2005, contracts for pipelines and
the innovative Fluid Transfer Line (FTL) also were
awarded. J.P. Kenny Mustang assisted with the Front
End Engineering and Design (FEED) concept for developing the ﬁeld in water depth of 1,320 meters. “It
took us 10 months to complete the engineering and
selected the ﬁnal project concept,” Jenkins said.
“Everyone at Murphy was under enormous pressure when working on the documentation of
the field development plan, and today the work,
which was drawn some three years ago, was finished on schedule.”

Interface management at work
Managing a project of this magnitude is another
challenge and an Interface Management group
consisting of a Facilities Management team as well
as Site Management teams, which were formed

immediately, handled this. Cash ﬂow and project
payments also were handled by the project controls
team, which managed milestone payment plans for
each contract.
Work on the various contracts was carried out on
a global scale — in the United States, Monaco,
the Netherlands, Finland, Australia, Singapore,
and in Kuala Lumpur as well as various other sites
throughout Malaysia. “We had the project implemented in a multitude of places, which was a challenge. Through our Interface Management concept,
we were able to manage the benchmarks of each
contract,” said Jenkins.
“We also had a strategy that required each bidder
to meet local content requirements outlined in
their contract, and we followed up with experts
overseeing the progress of each of them,” he said.
“We did all this while maintaining a top level
safety record and are proud to have delivered this
project successfully.”
“Eventually we will have 13
producing wells on the Spar
and three subsea wells,” said Bill
Hughes, Kikeh’s Senior Production Manager. “We should be
up to 120,000 bpd production
by the end of 2008. We will also
have six water injection wells on the Spar and 11
subsea wells, plus one gas injection well subsea until
such time as the gas pipeline to Labuan (Petronas
methanol plant) is completed in March or April 2008.”
“The happiest moments were when we awarded the
contracts within a six-month time frame — the last
quarter of 2004 and the ﬁrst quarter of 2005, and
the day we achieved ﬁrst oil — Aug 17, 2007 just
ﬁve short years from when the development began,”
said Jenkins. “I am delighted we have successfully
accomplished the development of this mega energy
project in Malaysia.” ✹

or the Kikeh project, Murphy Sabah Oil chose to
utilize a “ﬁt-for-purpose” Interface Management
approach. The Facilities Team management consisted
of a core group of people on the Project Management Team (PMT) based in Kuala Lumpur. That group
included Facilities Manager Steve Dechant, Interface
Manager Melih Oran, QA Manager Philip Howard and
Installation Manager Doug Smiley.

Putting the team together
Each of Murphy’s EPCIC (Engineering, Procurement,
Construction, Installation and Commissioning) Contract
Teams, or Site Management Teams (SMT), varied in number of personnel and depth of coverage. Key to each
SMT was the Contract Manager and Interface Engineer.
Most teams also designated an Engineering Manager,
who often was the same person as the Interface Engineer. Murphy’s Operations and Drilling and Completions
Teams also interfaced with the Facilities’ PMT and SMT’s.
In total, approximately 85 people made up the Murphy
PMT and SMT. Other oil and gas operators generally
have project management teams twice that size. Because of the relatively small size of these teams it was
essential that the key positions be ﬁlled with well-qualiﬁed and highly experienced engineers and managers.

Kikeh’s Interface Management Approach saw a core team of
85 qualiﬁed managers and engineers managing the project

“By industry standards, the Murphy PMT and SMTs were
small sized team,” said Interface Manager Melih Oran. “As
a general rule, our Facilities Team management approach
was to trust the contractors to do what they are experts at
doing and provide a ﬁt-for-purpose facility in accordance
with codes, rules and regulations and the contracts.”

Face to face communications
Interface Management requirements built into the EPCIC contract requirements included a Dedicated Interface Manager from each EPCIC and encouragement
of direct communication between EPCICs. “Murphy
was copied and kept in the loop, and helped facilitate,
but generally we let the EPCICs request and exchange
data as needed,” said Oran.

The wealth of deepwater knowledge, capability and technology for Kikeh came from all four corners of the world

Murphy had stressed that all parties involved in the
project hold party-to-party discussions. This resulted
in every element of the development completed as
per design, ﬁtting into the functions of each component — for example the functioning and operation of
the DTU, FPSO, FTL and TAD.

The EPCICs were also required to attend Quarterly
Interface Meeting (QIM) held in Kuala Lumpur over
two days. “Face-to-face communications proved to be
invaluable,” said Oran.
Each EPCIC was encouraged to utilize their own
interface management system, data sheets, format,
numbering, etc. Oran noted that Murphy did not
impose a unique “Murphy system” on them.
Ultimately, seven QIM sessions from April 2005 to
August 2006 were held along with an Installation
Campaign Readiness Review (ICRR) in late-January
2007, all in Kuala Lumpur.

Five main contracts
The interface program covered ﬁve main contracts,
and the challenge was to keep information ﬂowing
between all parties involved in a timely fashion. “We
had to coordinate with every one involved in the project including the contractors to keep to the schedule.
A lot of energy was spent on ensuring smooth operations,” Oran said.

Interfaces between EPCICs could have posed substantial commercial and technical risk to Murphy. “ If
EPCIC ‘A’ hardware, controls, process, or installation
activities did not mesh with Contractor ‘B’, then Murphy could have been exposed to cost and schedule
delays to make it mesh as well as potential technical
issues to make the interface work,” said Oran. “Also,
when we were planning for installation, we tried to
be aware of places where two groups would need
to work at the same time so as to minimize simultaneous operations and any potential conﬂicts that
might have resulted.”
“It was a learning process,” said Oran. “Sometimes we
had to reel people back from focusing on the details,
but we accomplished our goal to have ﬁrst oil within
ﬁve years of discovery.” ✹

Brainstorming sessions were held among the managers, both at Murphy and with the contractors,
he explained, noting that easily more than 100,000
management and engineering man-hours were spent
on Interface Management.
All these hours were spent on daily communications, correspondences, weekly and bi-weekly project
team meetings, weekly and monthly status reports,
monthly multi-contractor Interface Teleconferences
and the Quarterly Interface Meetings.

More than 100,000 management and engineering manhours

alaysia has gained extensively from the implementation of the Kikeh deepwater project
through technology transfer.

The FPSO, Spar, FTL, and subsea manifolds were
fabricated in Malaysia, while a portion of the subsea
trees was assembled in the country.

Kikeh is one of the largest oil and gas projects to
be undertaken in the country and that, too, on an
accelerated pace in the award of ﬁve Engineering,
Procurement, Construction, Installation and Commissioning (EPCIC) contracts.

Government support
“Murphy and Malaysia have demonstrated that we
can handle projects of this magnitude,” he stressed.
“Petronas’ collaboration has been unwavering in
terms of project support and procurement, especially in facilitating tender approvals.”

Global project, local capabilities
The Malaysian national oil
corporation, Petroliam Nasional
Berhad (Petronas), had set up a
special tender committee for the
project, the ﬁrst deepwater development that has introduced
technologies for building Spars,
and other components of deepwater oil exploration
and production to Malaysia, according to Tengku
Saifuzzaman Tengku Ahmad Shahruddin, Development Manager at Murphy Sabah Oil Co. Ltd.
“Technology transfer has taken place in every aspect
of the high-end equipment, plants and materials
that are being used at Kikeh,” he said.

Malaysian governmental agencies lent full support during the importation of equipment and
material, ensuring a smooth ﬂow of items for
the mega project, Tengku Saifuzzaman noted.
Most of the components were brought into the
country within one year, starting from the second
quarter of 2005.
The 2005 construction period was a big challenge,
he added, amongst which:
• Getting the equipment and materials into the
country on time
• Interfacing with the EPCIC contractors as well
as their subcontractors and vendors
• Maintaining project schedule

“We had a design competition and invited all four
manufacturers of the DTU. But we decided on the
Spar design as the most economically suitable option for producing oil from the ﬁeld,” he said.
The Kikeh deepwater ﬁeld development is a major landmark project for the Malaysian upstream
industry, as it marks the country’s successful foray
into deepwater production of hydrocarbons, thereby
establishing the credentials necessary for the country to realize its aspirations of becoming the region’s
deepwater hub, stressed Alﬁan Mohamad, Murphy’s

n areas of the world where pipeline infrastructure has
not yet been developed, Floating, Production, Storage and Oﬄoading (FPSO) vessels are an integral part
of oﬀshore projects. Murphy Oil’s Kikeh development
is similarly using a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) for
its production, processing, storage and oﬄoading of
crude oil and managing natural gas output.
Malaysia International Shipping Corp Bhd (MISC) and
Single Buoy Mooring (SBM), the global FPSO operator,
joined forces to provide one of the best production
options for Kikeh, and converted the 1974-build Atlas
VLCC for FPSO Kikeh.

Atlas’ hull is made of thick mild
steel with 35 mm bottom plates,
which provide ideal fatigue characteristics for a 20-year oﬀshore
ﬁeld life. “As a VLCC trading vessel
it was well maintained, and, as
such, a signiﬁcant amount of the
vessel systems and equipment have been retained
and refurbished to support the new operation,” said
Barry Courtney, Murphy’s FPSO Manager.

FPSO Kikeh takes shape

A Kikeh project-speciﬁc SafeHull A analysis was performed on the Atlas, as were extensive inspections.
Indeed, in addition to superior fatigue resistance, the
thick plates provide larger corrosion margins.

Responding to Murphy Oil’s call for a world-class
FPSO, MISC and SBM formed the joint venture, Malaysia Deepwater Floating Terminal Sdn Bhd (MDFT),
which acquired the VLCC formerly owned by the
Stena Group and converted it into a Class A1 FPSO to
standards set by ABS Group.

The Stena series is well known by SBM, which has
been operating a Stena Concordia class tanker as an
FSO for more than seven years and owns two other
Concordia class sister-ships for conversion to FPSO in
present market. The Atlas design is typical of the pre-

MDFT signed the letter of intent
with Murphy Oil in December 2004
and immediately began engineering and design for now-renamed
FPSO Kikeh to accommodate the
ﬁeld life span of 20 years. “Its topside
facilities are designed to handle and
store 120,000 barrels a day of crude
oil, 150 million standard cubic feet
per day of natural gas output and
260,000 barrels a day of water injection,” said Courtney.

FPSO Kikeh was converted at the MMHE shipyard in southern Peninsular Malaysia

The FPSO has plants for compression and conditioning of the
associated gas for gas injection
and future export of gas. The
target is to have zero gas ﬂaring
on the FPSO. Treated gas from the
produced hydrocarbon is used
to fuel the main boilers and the
topsides gas turbine generators on
the FPSO deck.
Space has been reserved on the
FPSO Kikeh to add another equipment module in case of enhanced
production or future tie-in from
related ﬁeld development. Utilities such as power generation,
heating medium, cooling medium, and instrument air will either
come with this new module or
that the available utilities on the
FPSO will accommodate the
incremental demand.

Tree Unit (DTU) via production ﬂowlines supported by
the Fluid Transfer Line (FTL). The three-phase production
ﬂuid then enters the turret manifolding system where
it is directed into production manifolds, one high-pressure production, one low-pressure production and
one test manifold. The crude passes through dedicated
torodial swivels and onto the FPSO’s process system.

Turret technology
The external turret mooring system on FPSO Kikeh
consists of an extension from the vessel’s bow called
the rigid-arm, which supports a turntable, a gantry,
a slewing bearing, two manifold decks and a chaintable. Anchor lines are attached to the chain-table by
means of unijoints. The bearing allows the turntable
to freely weathervane around the anchoring system
so that the vessel can take up the position of least
resistance to the prevailing weather at all times.

High-pressure gas and water pass in the reverse
direction from the FPSO process system through the
turret via similar means for injection into the ﬁeld to
provide enhanced means of oil recovery. Provision for
future handling of a subsea tie-back, as well as future
processed oil and gas has been allowed in the turret.
Electro/hydraulic umbilicals carry power, instrumentation signals, and utility ﬂuids to the subsea manifolds
and the DTU.

tensioning being carried out by a chain pulling electro/hydraulic winch which is permanently located
on the turret and energized with temporary jumpers
from the FPSO.
The horizontal position of the turret structure relative to the vessel is determined by the so-called
extreme “overrun” condition. This is the condition
where the vessel moves ahead of its center position, so that the anchor lines, which are below the
keel of the vessel, are tensioned. “The usual design
case for the overrun condition is the tail end of a
storm, when the wind speed drops, but waves are
still strong.

The bow extension, the distance between the turret

The lower deck supports the upper manifold deck,
by means of structural columns, where the rigid
piping is grouped underneath the swivel before
being passed through the dedicated swivel paths.
The swivel foundation is supported oﬀ the upper
manifold deck by columns.
The riser interface with the turret is designed on the
basis of ﬂexible risers, each equipped with a sliding
bend stiﬀener. The riser interface with turret is based
on a series of I-tubes of typically two to three meters
in length.
The base of each I-tube is designed with a support
ﬂange and bolt circle to interface with the ﬂexible
riser bend-stiﬀener. The purpose of the bend-stiﬀener
is to maintain ﬂexible pipe curvature at the turret
interface within allowable limits.

— pitch and heave.
The turret ﬁxed part, geo-stationary, forms the nonweathervaning side of the vessel mooring. It includes
the chain table at the lower rim, and is suspended
from the main slewing roller bearing mounted on
the upper side of the turret turntable. The ﬁxed part
houses the riser termination and the piping between
the riser and the swivel entry. The ﬁxed part structure
transfers the mooring loads from the anchor legs to
the extension structure, rigid arm, via the turntable.

The anchor legs are arranged in a pattern of three
bundles of three equi-spaced legs, each bundle 120
degrees apart to each other. The mooring legs are
conﬁgured with an angle of ﬁve degrees between
each line within a bundle.

20-year ﬁeld life
All operations on the DTU/Spar, which is rated as
an unmanned platform, are being handled from

The vessel has accommodation for 118 people with
lifeboats and rescue boats as a full part of the safety and
rescue operations. It is also equipped with a helideck
designed for a Sikorsky S61N and S92A helicopters.

The SPAR Option

The SPAR Option

T

he Kikeh Spar project was a new engineering
challenge for Malaysia and the team of international engineers tasked to design and build the Spar.
A Dry Tree Unit (DTU) on a cylindrical ﬂoater was
deemed the best economical and technological option for oil and gas production from the deepwater
Kikeh ﬁeld.
Early planning and about 15 parallel studies were
carried out for Malaysia’s ﬁrst Spar project as soon as
Murphy Sabah Oil selected the economical Spar option for the Kikeh project instead of other deepwater
choices, including a tension leg platform (TLP).

“This was a fast track project for
which we did various studies
parallel to design work,” said
David Sims, Murphy’s topside
client representative. “In addition to the studies, we designed
models modiﬁed to suit Malaysian waters,” he adds.

(MMHE) shipyard based in Pasir Gudang, Johor, on

the southernmost tip of peninsular Malaysia and
international engineering group, Technip, took on the
challenge of building the country’s ﬁrst Spar.

Work began in February 2005
“The Spar is easier to move over the drilling areas,
especially the deepwater basins and it may actually
help speed up the drilling,” Sims said. However, it still
was a challenge to work on the Spar. “We began with
the basic piping and instrument drawings, and had to
consider various elements including the well condition and temperatures.”
Considerable attention was paid on how to manage
weight on the deck. Though the Spar is moored on
site, it is subject to movement based on the sea waves
and wind ﬂow.
Geotechnical study on the seabed covered the current ﬂow and wind direction among other aspects,
and environmental, safety and hazardous studies all
helped in the design of the Spar.
“We even did a study on heat dispersion for the two
ﬂares on the Spar as wind directions are very impor-

tant, given the highly sensitive materials on
the deck,” said Sims.
Other materials on the Spar topside include
corrosion inhibitors and demulsyiﬁers. Engine exhaust study was another major contributor to the deck planning for the Spar,
which houses a large quantity of methanol
to be used for well injection to help with
the oil ﬂow from the well-depth as well as
through the 1,320 meters of water depth.
“Oil ﬂow from such deep sea environments
tend to freeze,” said Sims.

Continuous studies and reviews

The Spar is easier to move over the drilling areas especially in deepwater basins

A highly crucial study — the Reliability, Availability and Maintainability (RAM) study
— helped select all the main components for the
Spar deck. Sims singles out one example of the generators. “We wanted to ensure we have generators
that were reliable, available on schedule and were
maintenance friendly.”

The Murphy team continuously reviewed the designs
and studies. The challenge was to build an unmanned
Spar-based production platform. Once the production/development well drilling program is completed,
the unmanned DTU platform would be operated from
the FPSO Kikeh, located 1.6 km away.

The Spar’s topside design was completed in about six
months at Technip oﬃce in Kuala Lumpur.

The SPAR Option

“There are no plans to shut any well once it starts
producing, but we have taken precautions as it will be
necessary to shut wells in case of emergencies, such
as ﬁres or blow-outs,” Sims explained. It is called the
Emergency Shut Down (ESD) system.

Safety ﬁrst
Other main equipment on the Spar deck includes
ﬁre-ﬁghting equipment, water pumps to ﬁght ﬁre,
almost all of which are housed in the Mechanical and
Electrical Building (MEB).
The Spar’s topside will also have diesel pumps for
supplying fuel to the two cranes and the 1,000-kilowatt generators.
“We have also placed two 22-man lifeboats and two
25-man rafts on the deck,” he adds.

Transferring personnel to the Spar

erations Room with the DTU. The heavily coated FTL
has three 10-inch lines, one 8-inch line and umbilicals.
It transmits operational signals and power supplies for
the plants on the Spar.

Handling the Spar
Three cameras located in the FPSO Operations Room
monitor operations at the DTU and the surrounding
area of the Spar. “These will be the eyes,” Sims said.
The Kikeh Spar topside is designed for 25 wells, but
the initial ﬁeld production will come through 14
wells, including three water injection wells through a
manifold system.
A multi-phase ﬂow meter will be used to monitor and
manage the ﬂow of oil to the FPSO production/processing system. “We have designed the system to
pump ‘dry oil’ or the processed oil from the FPSO to
DTU,” said Sims. This oil will be pumped into wells to
re-start wells or if any one becomes hydrated.

16

All these are safety measures for drilling crew and
crew that would be sent on the deck during well
work-over programmes and wire logging of wells.
On average a six-man team is expected to be on the
Spar/DTU deck during maintenance work.
Technip Finland, which has designed some 15 hulls
for Spars, designed the Kikeh Spar hull while MMHE
fabricated it at the Pasir Gudang yard.
“Work on the hull started during the rainy season of
2005 but fabrication process was continued around
the clock,” says Rahim Mamat, Murphy’s Site Engineer
with 25 years of ﬁeld experience and in charge of the
Project Control and Scheduling.
“It was a learning curve for the ﬁrst tank, and it took
us 14 months to fabricate the hull, which was also a
ﬁrst-time project at MMHE and in Malaysia,” he adds.
Twenty engineers from Technip Finland along with
the Murphy and MMHE teams met the challenge of
completing the largest section of the Spar, weighing
some 13,000 tonnes.

component of the project. It was important to design the Spar to accommodate the mooring point of
the TAD. ✹

Innovative Flowlines System

Innovative Flowlines System

O

ne of the unique features of the Kikeh project
was the industry introduction of a Fluid Transfer
Line system between the Spar and the FPSO.
Single Buoy Mooring (SBM) developed this concept, also known as the Gravity Actuated Pipe (GAP)
system, for the near-surface transfer of hydrocarbon
ﬂuids between two ﬂoaters, such as a Spar and FPSO,
on deepwater oil ﬁelds. The Kikeh Spar and FPSO are
located 1,600 meters from each other.
“There were several challenges
with using seabed flowlines,”
said Geoff Stone, Kikeh Project
FTL Manager. “The FTL was built
as an alternative solution to
these hurdles.”
The Kikeh ﬂowline challenges included:
• Flow assurance due to low seawater
temperatures
• The high discharge pressure to overcome
the pressure drops induced by much longer
flowlines length
• Seabed congestion

The EPCIC contract for the provision of the
Kikeh FTL system was awarded to SBM in April
2005 with a targeted completion date of September 2007.

Continuous steel pipe suspended
between ﬂoaters
The Kikeh FTL system bundles the production
flowlines and power/control umbilical around a
carrier terminated with two towheads, the latter
being suspended from the Spar and FPSO by
tether chains.
“The carrier-pipe is a continuous steel pipe,” said
Stone. Its diameter is 1.2m increased to 2.3m at its
extremities with internal bulkheads for ensuring
its structural integrity in case of damage (buckling
under external pressure). “The diameter of the
carrier-pipe is determined so that its buoyancy
keeps the bundle within the prescribed high and
low water depth limitations when it is subjected to
the density variations of the conveyed fluids. The
submerged weight of the bundle is adjusted by
trimming chains installed along the bundle length,”
he added.

Kikeh’s FTL is the ﬁrst in the world that uses gravity actuated pipe (GAP) technology

Preparing the FTL towhead for its launch

The towheads, located at each carrier extremity,
support the fluid and mechanical connections of
the bundle to the Spar and FPSO. Specifically:
• Flexible steel jumpers and intermediate steel
pipe spools connect four 10 diameter flowlines, which include two high pressure and
one low-pressure product lines, as well as one
water injection line, to the Spar and FPSO.
The towhead includes also two heavy clump
weight chains for stability
• On the Spar side a taut twin tether chains
arrangement connects the towhead to the
Spar at 60 m water depth (one of the chain
is redundant),
• On the FPSO side a catenary twin tether

added stability,
• The umbilical, which is connected between
the two topside facilities via the FTL system
in a continuous length, provides high voltage
electric power to the Spar and enables instrumentation data exchange via optical fibers.

Fabrication and launching
SBM fabricated the FTL on a temporary purposedeveloped site near Bintulu, Sarawak. This site
consisted of a reclaimed strip of land, 1,600m ×
100m, perpendicular to the coastline, on which a
railway track was installed to run the bogies used to
support the system during launching to sea.
The carrier 20m sections were prefabricated using
a high quality fabrication shop process and assem-

bled on the launching bogies into a continuous
system 1,300 m long. Semi-automatic welding and
automated ultrasonic inspection (AUT) were of the
highest quality. The towheads’ caissons and wing
tanks were prefabricated at Johor Baru and Bintulu
and assembled at the ends of the carrier.
“The flowlines were fabricated using quality
pipeline fabrication methods on either side of the
launching track and later lifted into the articulated
supports clamped to the carrier-pipe,” said Stone.
The jumpers/umbilical termination supports were
installed and the connecting rigid pipe spools (to
be installed offshore) were prefabricated and field
tested using dummy jumper termination. All flowlines and spools were hydro-tested on site.

T

he Kikeh ﬁeld was discovered using Diamond
Oﬀshore’s Ocean Baroness. The Baroness was
then used for two appraisal wells in the ﬁeld before
being released from the site in late 2002. The two
rigs used for development work on the project were
Diamond’s Ocean Rover, a semi-submersible, and
Sea-Drill’s West Setia, a semi-tender assist drilling rig.
The average development well depth ranged from
3,000 to 5,000 meters in 1,320 meters water depth.
The variable sand quality, number of reservoirs and
shallow hazards make the project unique, according to Michael McFadyen, Senior Drilling Manager
at Murphy Sabah Oil Co Ltd.

Managing logistics
“One of the biggest challenges
on the drilling and completions
side was managing logistics in
an area where we were the first
to develop in deepwater,” said
McFadyen. “This involved keeping the rig operation supplied
with equipment, materials and specialists to continue uninterrupted operations to avoid downtime
and meet the schedule.”
The batch-set operation for the structural and surface
casings was the largest of its kind for Murphy and
Diamond Oﬀshore, setting 23 wellheads in 63 days.
More than a million sacks of barite were transported
to the shore-base facility, mixed into liquid mud and
consumed oﬀshore on the Rover. These large volumes
and quantities of materials required a major upgrade
of the shore-base facility before the project start.
Additionally, the supply base had a very small
number of berths available for the larger deepwater vessels, requiring berth sharing with other
operators. “The successful Kikeh batch set operation was very intense and required a strong team
effort, solid planning, and clear communication,”
said McFadyen.

Semi submersible Ocean Rover will be responsible for the
17 sub sea wells

Ocean Rover and West Setia
The West Setia will drill and complete a total of 18
wells from the Kikeh Spar while the Ocean Rover
semi-submersible will be responsible for the 17
sub sea wells. “The West Setia represents another
first for the industry by utilizing a semi tender assist
drilling rig on a Spar host facility,” said McFadyen.
“The key challenge to overcome on this was to
make the installation and rig-up during the monsoon season.”
The Kikeh development drilling and completion
cost is in the $15 million range for each Spar well
and $25 million per sub-sea well.
The total drilling completion budget was in excess
of $800 million, says McFadyen, who oversaw well
engineering, cost estimation, well design and well
delivery for the project. At ﬁrst oil, there were 11 subsea and ﬁve Spar wells drilled on the development.
Typical casing designs for a Kikeh subsea well is 36",
20", 13-5/8" and 9-5/8" casings. The Spar wells were
similar but used 16" instead of 20" to slim down the

uality Assurance and Quality Control management
is a mammoth task for a project
of Kikeh’s scale. Industry expert
Philip Howard spearheaded
Murphy’s eﬀorts which ensured
that every piece and item used
in the development and operation of Kikeh ﬁeld
for 20 years was tested, audited and classiﬁed to
international standards — ISO 9000, ASME, API, AWS,
DNV and ABS.
Cost-conscious Murphy conducted Quality Assurance
(QA) at a much reduced cost of similar projects of this
magnitude by relying on the contractors to perform
the Quality Control (QC) function.
“To achieve this, we had at least one dedicated QA
expert assigned per Engineering, Procurement,

Construction, Installation and Commissioning (EPCIC)
contract performing Quality Assurance oversight of
the contractor’s activities and sites,” said Howard, the
QA/QC Manager at Murphy Sabah Oil Co Ltd.

Periodic audits
“Periodic audits were also carried out with independent third parties to ensure we have the best quality
products in place for the ﬁeld which is designed to
produce for 20 years without signiﬁcant maintenance
shutdown,” according to Howard.
Specialists and experts were taken on to assist in
auditing the contractor and its various vendors’ work
practices and sites where the work was being carried
out as well as the ﬁnished product, in the case of safety
or production critical equipment. “We felt that was the
most suitable way of handling Quality Assurance, without having to take on a lot of staﬀ,” he explained.

“One other aspect of the Quality Assurance role was to

Welding was one of the most critical issues in the process of putting together the Fluid Transfer Line due to
the extremely minute welding defect sizes allowable to

he Kikeh ﬁeld has a dedicated supply base to ensure a smooth ﬂow of supplies for producing up
to 120,000 b/d of crude oil and 150 million standard
cu ft per day of natural gas for the next 20 years.
Murphy’s Logistics Manager
Mark Adams led the base development, which is located
at the Asian Supply Base on
Labuan island, off Sabah. Other
oil and gas companies have
operations located in other

parts of the base.

Gearing for fast growth
Murphy invested $6.5 million on upgrading its portion of the 55,000 sq acre base, where its staff of 26
runs the daily operation. The base upgrading was
accelerated with work started in September 2005
and completed by April 2006 as installation work
began in the field.
Located some 120 km from Kikeh field, the base is
geared for the fast-paced development, especially
the installation and initial three years of production.
“After three years, the focus shifts totally to support
for the production function,” said Adams.
In addition to the building of a new pipe yard, the
existing jetty and pipe yard have also been upgraded, noted Adams. Five offshore support service

boats, four anchor handling tug and supply boats,
one crew boat, and two helicopters ferried supplies
such as OCTG tubular goods, drilling equipment
and people to work on the drilling rigs as well as
the FPSO and the DTU.
Sikorsky S-76 C+ helicopters lend aviation support
to the field’s structures. The hangar was especially
upgraded for the two helicopters.

Peak activity
The challenge was at the peak of activity when
the base contained huge stocks and inventories,
including 6,000 tonnes of conductor/casing, 40,000
tonnes of dry bulks, 34,000 tonnes of liquid mud,
and 6,500 tonnes of fuel and water.
The liquid mud plant at the base was upgraded to
1,000 barrels of oil-based mud capacity and the
addition of 10,000 barrels of water-based mud new
capacity as well as 8,500 barrels of brine capacity.
The base has supported the transportation and
installation of 13,000 tonnes of the Spar hull, and
4,500 tonnes deck ﬂoatover during the development
phase while the production wells were being drilled.
“The goal was to have suitable resources available to support the peak activity as the project
moves into a mature operating environment,”
says Adams. ✹

Proﬁle: Schlumberger

Schlumberger delivers innovative technologies and
collaborative support to the Kikeh development
Drilling and completing deepwater wells is a major challenge, but
to be the first to undertake a deepwater development in an area
with no prior infrastructure takes courageous leadership. Murphy
took on the challenge to move Malaysia into the realm of deepwater producing countries. That leadership demanded Murphy select
partners with the experience, expertise and innovation to operate
and deliver on this important project.
Well construction and service contracts for Murphy’s Kikeh
field development were awarded in late 2004 and early 2005. Schlumberger received multiple related contracts including providing
electric wireline and perforating services; well testing and tubing
conveyed perforating; measurement- and logging-while-drilling
(MWD and LWD) equipment and services; cementing services;
downhole completion equipment and services; and rig networking and communication services.
Working closely together, Schlumberger and Murphy have
been able to achieve record batch drilling times, with completions
being delivered in less than 14 days—half of the industry average
and half of Murphy’s forecast.
To deliver first oil in five years after initial discovery is an outstanding result for Murphy and its partners. Multiple benchmarks
testify to the success of the project, including the speed at which
the various phases are being completed, the cost against budget,
and first oil within five years of discovery.
Schlumberger deepwater technologies and support have
been integral in delivering these results. This deepwater expertise
extends to a multitude of services including wireline evaluation,
LWD/MWD, cementing, communications, subsea, completions,
testing, perforating, and interpretation.

Expansion of Labuan facility for advanced
drilling and completions support
Schlumberger built an infrastructure within Malaysia to deliver a
complete range of drilling and completions services with a focus
on deepwater operations. This investment included construction of extensive maintenance facilities; the addition of resources
capable of handling and storing huge quantities of cement and
chemicals; enhancements to quality control processes and procedures with a focus on equipment assembly; and the addition of
computerized pressure testing and equipment make up.
The outcome is the Schlumberger Deepwater Center of Excellence in South East Asia, which is dedicated to expanding the
deepwater industry inside Malaysia, and is operated with a growing Malaysian and regional workforce.

The Schlumberger-Murphy collaboration
The impact and value of the collaboration between Murphy and
Schlumberger has been recognized in both organizations. To produce first oil within five years of the initial Kikeh discovery, it was
important for multiple disciplines to provide and apply a range of
technologies for optimal drilling and completion solutions.
The initial drilling phase was performed within budget, with
the completions phase on track to be below budget. Major collaboration benefit comes from less obvious deliverables, such as
a reduction in the number of wells required to deliver anticipated
production levels. Additionally, lessons learned from the Kikeh development can be transferred to other deepwater projects within
Malaysia and the region, and Murphy will be able to apply the lessons to its deepwater projects in the Gulf of Mexico and Congo.

The Schlumberger Completions team has been working on Murphy’s Kikeh Project at Labuan.

reduce costs and increase productivity as part of this project. Many
of these innovative solutions have
been, or will be, presented in technical papers at industry conferences around the world. A full session
at the 2008 Offshore Technology
Conference (OTC) will be dedicated
to Murphy and the Kikeh project,
with multiple papers focused on
the successful application of various Schlumberger technologies.
Murphy and Schlumberger jointly
focused on moving routine activities
oﬄine, out of the critical path of drilling and completion operations. A major reduction in critical path activities
was possible after thorough review.
The impact is clear: completion times
have been reduced by half, to less
than 14 days per well, with massive
saving on rig day rate and increased
cash ﬂow by bringing production on
stream earlier.

Well construction and
evaluation solutions

Formation Isolation Valve (FIV) systems provide “no kill” perforating.
Schlumberger provided a support team to manage the work
scope under the Murphy contracts, in most cases working as
a team from within Murphy’s offices. Additional support was
available from the Schlumberger regional office based in Kuala
Lumpur, including a Drilling Engineering Center, a host of geoscience, engineering, data processing and data handling expertise,
plus extensive lab capabilities. Specific to the completion work,
Schlumberger provided a project manager and a focused team of
experts. This team accessed engineering support from a range of
global resources, including multiple engineering and manufacturing centers and the Schlumberger InTouch Lessons Learned database—bringing experiences and best practices from deepwater
operations throughout the world.

Innovative technologies and solutions
A range of innovative solutions were applied to mitigate risks,
30

The Schlumberger DeepCEM* and
DeepCRETE* cementing systems
support deepwater operations with
increased cement strength and stability, reduced time to deliver and set, all
without requiring special equipment
or personnel. These attributes were
key as the Kikeh development wells’
surface casing was batch set and
required fast, reliable and quality cement supporting those casings.
Shallow water flows challenge
drilling operations and have been observed in a number of the
Kikeh wells. DeepCRETE technology is able to isolate the formation
with a lighter fluid, and reduces waiting on cement time without
complicating the deepwater operations. The DeepCRETE system
enhances both early gel and compressive strength developments,
thus combating shallow water flows. Its low densities minimize the
risk of losses associated with low fracture gradient in deepwater.
The DeepCEM slurry systems focus on the long-term
durability of the set cement, not just the effective slurry placement and short-term isolation. Such systems enable cemented
annular sheaths to withstand a wide range of downhole stresses
without failure.
Kikeh’s cementing operations were monitored in real time
using the Schlumberger InterACT* monitoring and data delivery
system, allowing Schlumberger and Murphy engineers to make
quick decisions, mitigating operational delays.

SenTREE 7 provides safety and control at the ocean ﬂoor during completions and testing operations, using a 4,300 ft umbilical back to surface.
When Murphy engineers needed to compute the oil reserves
in thinly bedded turbidite sections of the Kikeh reservoir, Schlumberger geoscientists worked with Murphy to develop a methodology to compute the cumulative sand thickness. Three high-resolution log measurements were used to separately identify the
thin beds, using thresholds to identify the reservoir quality sands.
Schlumberger geoscientists and Murphy engineers were able to
quickly deliver cumulative and consolidated sand counts from the
three methods. Correlations and sensitivity analysis were used to
verify the results culminating in quantification of the reserves in
the thin sand laminations.
During the deepwater exploration operations, Schlumberger
and Murphy jointly developed an Imploding Sphere technology,
a solution enhancing seismic signals during wellbore seismic
surveys. This improved the quality of information and resulted in
better decision making in an area where signal quality and data
have been historically weak.
An ultrasonic imager tool is traditionally used to evaluate
cement and casing. On Kikeh this measurement was adapted to
measure the wear on the deepwater drilling riser, helping to evaluate exposure to risk and to mitigate the need to invest in expensive backup drilling risers.
www.murphyoilcorp.com

As the network and communications provider, Schlumberger
combined wireless Local Area Networks (LAN) and satellite
technology to enable Murphy to deliver and monitor its well data
in real time, permitting key personnel to stay connected and to
collaborate effectively.

Well completion solutions
In completing the subsea production wells, a full SenTREE* 7
completion and test tree is used to provide operations safety and
full downhole control of the well during completions and testing
operations. Unique to Kikeh is the modified SenTREE 7 for water
and gas injector wells. For these wells, select features are used,
permitting the use of the rig’s BOP system while the subsea test
valves are removed. Both systems were custom designed to integrate flawlessly with Murphy’s subsea tree and the Schlumbergerinstalled completions. Without utilizing SenTREE 7, a completely
different subsea tree design would be required, adding cost and
complexity to the development and potentially delaying cleanup
and production testing.
A solution specific to the Kikeh development was a one-trip
tubing conveyed perforating (TCP) system. To provide reservoir
protection and well control, the Schlumberger QUANTUM maX*

Schlumberger Regional
Deepwater Technology
Hub in Kuala Lumpur
—
Southeast Asia is fast becoming a major deepwater E&P
region. Murphy’s Kikeh project is only the ﬁrst, as additional
exploration and ﬁeld development plans are processed
and evaluated. A large investment in people, facilities, and
a range of other resources is essential for deepwater ﬁeld
developments to be viable.
In providing deepwater support to Murphy for the
Kikeh development, the expansion and upgrade of the
Schlumberger Labuan operations facility was a major step.
Meeting the stringent demands of deepwater operators,
the facility has become the ﬁrst Schlumberger Deepwater
Operations Center of Excellence in Southeast Asia.
With the anticipated growth in deepwater E&P activity
in the Middle East and Asia, early in 2007 Schlumberger
formed a “Deepwater Technology Hub” based in Kuala
Lumpur. The goal of the Technology Hub is to align the
company’s research and technology eﬀorts, with the
deepwater goals and challenges of the various deepwater
operators. Through working with deepwater operators like
Murphy and Petronas, both in the Middle East and Asia,
Schlumberger is able to focus and invest in the real deepwater challenges, to apply lessons learned, to bring value to
new deepwater projects as risks are mitigated, eﬃciencies
are incorporated, productivities are enhanced, and new
ways of doing business are developed.
The Schlumberger Middle East and Asia Deepwater
Technology Hub has brought together a core team of
experts in deepwater well construction, completions and
production. These experts will inﬂuence the direction of
Schlumberger investments in future deepwater technologies. They are already engaged with regional operators
on a diverse array of challenges ranging from subsea
interventions, to ﬂow assurance and the ability to identify
producible reserves in thin bed reservoirs, a solution that
Schlumberger applied to help Murphy conﬁrm a commercial reservoir in the thin bed laminations of the Kikeh ﬁeld.
The commitment from Schlumberger to deepwater
technologies and solutions, with regional and local experience and expertise, and an established deepwater center
of excellence and deepwater technology hub, all point to
a service provider uniquely positioned to respond to any
deepwater challenge.

gravel-pac system for HPHT conditions was modified to function
with a deepwater Full Bore Set Down (FBSD) service tool coupled
with the company’s FIV* Formation Isolation Valve tool, and run
as an integral part of the 7-in TCP PURE* perforating system. The
objective of this unique system is to achieve the field production
plateau quicker, with a reduction in the number of wells required
to deliver that level of production.
The need for an oriented 7-in TCP system was identified early
in the completion design analysis. The Schlumberger Reservoir
Completions group developed the 7-in oriented perforating gun
system utilizing much of the proven OrientXact* tubing-conveyed
oriented perforating system, originally designed for high-performance deepwater application. With some wells requiring sand
control and the use of expandable screens, the 7-in oriented TCP
system maximized the number of perforations open to flow, mitigating expandable screen erosion and ensuring maximum production with the screens in place. Use of this system saved Murphy up
to $15 million in alternate sand control options.
Downhole pressure monitoring is being provided by the Schlumberger NPQG Permanent Quartz Gauge. The gauges were originally
identiﬁed by the production team as a requirement for reservoir and
well monitoring. The gauges allow pressure monitoring for the life of
the ﬁeld and provide data and information for informed decision making. The gauges have proved invaluable as a completion operations
tool, in addition to monitoring and documenting tool operations
downhole. The monitoring capability increased conﬁdence in tool
operations and subsequently reduced rig time.
The downhole NPQG Permanent Quartz Gauge system has
been instrumental in understanding the dynamics and formation
of hydrate plugs. With access to pressure data, ﬁt-for-purpose planning and action can be taken, and in at least one case, inhibition
chemicals were injected downhole. Key to providing ﬂow assurance
for the deepwater wells is the capability to inject chemicals to inhibit hydrates, scale and wax. Schlumberger has provided chemical
injection capability with its Dual-Check Chemical Injection (DCIN)
gauges, installed on all of Kikeh’s production and injection wells.
Schlumberger has made a commitment to deepwater technologies and solutions. The experience, expertise and innovation have
established Schlumberger as the one service provider uniquely
positioned to deliver, whatever your deepwater challenge.

Proﬁle: Diamond Offshore Drilling

Diamond Offshore conducts
Kikeh’s development drilling operations
a very eﬀective unit in performing ﬁeld development operations in
their Kikeh deepwater development program.

Ocean Rover upgraded for Kikeh project
The Ocean Rover is an enhanced “Victory” class heavy-duty semisubmersible drilling unit that underwent a major structural, stability and
equipment upgrade in Singapore prior to the commencement of the
Kikeh project. The rig is currently equipped to operate in water depths
up to 6,500 feet with an eight-point self-contained combination
mooring system and is in the process of further water depth enhancement to drill in water depths of up to 8,000 feet
The rig has a nominal drilling depth capability of 35,000 feet with
a variable deck load of 5,000 long tons. Signiﬁcant features include a
dedicated riser gantry crane, and the ability to hang-oﬀ the blowout
preventer and riser assembly and casing strings away from the well
center using the Hydralift Tripsaver. The rig also features an integrated
pipe-handling system consisting of knuckle-boom crane, tubular
conveyor and pipe-racking system that provides the ability to make
up tubulars oﬀ the critical path.
To maximize the oﬄine eﬃciencies of the Ocean Rover without
impeding the critical path operations, Diamond Oﬀshore, in conjunction with Neural Services, worked closely with Murphy to continuously evolve and improve the rig’s operating procedures. The changes
required additional crew members including extra crane operators,
deck coordinators and assistant drillers to be on duty at all times.

Safety is our number one priority
Diamond Offshore’s semisubmersible Ocean Rover is conducting
development drilling operations for Murphy’s Kikeh ﬁeld project. The
rig has been drilling offshore Malaysia for Murphy since July 2003.
Diamond Oﬀshore provides contract drilling services to the energy
industry around the globe and is a leader in deepwater drilling. The
company owns and operates one of the world’s largest ﬂeets of
oﬀshore drilling rigs, consisting of 30 semisubmersibles, 13 jackup
units and one drillship. Two additional premium jack-ups are under
construction in Singapore and U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The company’s
headquarters are in Houston with regional oﬃces in Louisiana,
Mexico, Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Scotland, Qatar, Singapore, the
Netherlands, Norway and Malaysia. Approximately 4,500 personnel
work for the company on board our rigs and in our oﬃces.

While the equipment and technology make these types of operations physically possible, ultimately it is the crews that convert it into
true value for the client. Throughout the evolution process, safety has
remained the number one priority and the Ocean Rover has now operated for more than 725 days without a lost time accident (LTA). This
is a signiﬁcant achievement as the rig has a diverse crew complement
of up to eight diﬀerent nationalities on board at any one time. There
are currently around 100 Malaysian nationals employed onboard the
Ocean Rover. Diamond Oﬀshore, in conjunction with Neural Services,
employs 29 Malaysian nationals onshore in support roles.

Malaysian drilling operations
In 2000, Neural Services Sdn. Bhd entered into an agreement with
Diamond Oﬀshore to represent their interests in Malaysia. In 2001,
this partnership registered its ﬁrst success with Murphy Sabah Oil Co.
Ltd., contracting the Ocean Baroness deepwater semisubmersible
drilling rig. The contract was extended and amended to allow for the
substitution of the then newly upgraded Ocean Rover deepwater
semisubmersible drilling rig in July 2003. The Ocean Rover has been
drilling for Murphy oﬀshore Malaysia since then and has proven to be

Proﬁle: Aker Kvaerner

Murphy’s Kikeh is the First Deepwater Development
in Malaysia … and Aker Kvaerner was there
Murphy Oil, in partnership with Petronas Carigali, awarded Aker
Kvaerner to provide the subsea production system for its historic
Kikeh development. As a leading global provider of engineering
and construction services, technology products and integrated
solutions within the energy sector, Aker Kvaerner was well suited
to successfully execute this landmark project. Aker Kvaerner is part
of Aker Group, a Norwegian-based industrial conglomerate with
over 23,000 employees and 11,000 agency workers in nearly 30
countries.

The Project
The Kikeh field, which is located in approximately 1,350 meter
water depth offshore Sabah in Eastern Malaysia, consists of a
combination of production and injection trees and multiple drill
centers with a contract value of $100 million for the subsea scope.

Kikeh subsea ﬁeld layout

The Subsea Scope of Work
Aker Kvaerner, through its Aker Kvaerner Subsea unit, provided
Kikeh with 16 subsea wellsets comprising three production
trees, 12 water injection trees and one gas injection tree, related
controls, five manifolds, 17 km of umbilicals, connection systems, subsea distribution equipment, project management and
engineering, IWOCS and associated tooling. All equipment was
designed for a 20-year life of field.
The subsea tree system comprised 16, 5-in. x 2-in. subsea
Christmas tree systems rated for 10,000 psi working pressure, and
designed for 5,000 ft water depth and in accordance with API 6A
and API 17D specifications. Deliveries for the project commenced
in May 2006 with one water injection tree and one production tree
and will continue through 2007. The project for the trees was managed from Houston with the Work Package Manager, Cody Moffitt,
relocating to Norway for the assembly and test phases of the first
eight trees, then to Malaysia for the final eight trees to manage the
process on site.
The Kikeh subsea trees represent a new chapter in design and
innovation for Aker Kvaerner Subsea. The design was optimized to
save weight and maximize on reducing any flow assurance issues
by greatly reducing the amount of flow loops. The Kikeh trees also
incorporate PassThru™ technology in the tubing hanger to allow
the customer to have continuous monitoring and control of critical downhole functions during installation of the tubing hanger.
Additionally, the tooling that is used for installation of the trees
and components has also been optimized to save time during
installation or retrieval by making all of the tools multifunctional in
their design and use. The tooling also is being optimized to allow
for future business in Malaysia that may run 15,000 psi trees.
The subsea production controls system is an electro/hydraulic
Mux system comprised of 16 subsea control modules (SCM), subsea distribution equipment and topsides equipment. The SCMs
incorporate Aker Kvaerner’s iCon Subsea Electronic Module (SEM).
The iCon SEM brings advanced technology to subsea production

controls and monitoring with higher data rate retrieval and lower
power consumption. Additionally, the iCon SEM accepts a wide
range of third-party device input.
For Kikeh, Aker Kvaerner also provided subsea distribution
equipment including steel-tube hydraulic flying leads (HFL), electrical flying leads (EFL) and subsea umbilical termination assemblies (SUTA). In combination, the SUTAs , HFLs and EFLs allocate
hydraulic supplies and electrical power to the subsea Christmas
trees and pressure and temperature sensors.
Kikeh topside controls include a master control station where
operators can control the subsea system and monitor reservoir
conditions. Additional topside equipment includes a hydraulic
power unit (HPU) that supplies adequate and timely hydraulic
volume subsea to actuate tree valves and other functions.
Approximately 17 km of steel-tube umbilicals were contracted
for Kikeh. This comprised two main umbilicals that were hung-off
the host facility and four infield umbilicals plus one transfer umbilical. The Kikeh umbilicals were manufactured to Murphy specifications and included Aker Kvaerner’s patented “profile” method that
protects the individual elements within the umbilical and extends
the product’s operational life.

Another First
As a sign of its commitment to the Asia Pacific petroleum sector,
Aker Kvaerner opened a new purpose-built facility in Port Klang,
Malaysia, just west of Kuala Lumpur at a cost of over $100 million. The new facility opened in April 2007 with over 400,000 sq.
ft. under cover. This state-of-the-art plant is the first capable of
manufacturing the complete line of subsea production equipment
at one location.

Proﬁle: Frank’s International & Frank’s

The Kikeh “Hercules” Challenge
In anticipation of the Murphy Oil Kikeh project,
Malaysia’s ﬁrst major deepwater development, Frank’s
International opened two new bases in Labuan, East
Malaysia and Kememan, West Malaysia. The infrastructure is now in place with experienced management,
seasoned all-Malaysian oﬀshore crews and specialty
deepwater operation supervisors from Frank’s Casing Crew & Rental Tools’ U.S. Deepwater Team. Drew
Gardenier, Frank’s International Regional Manager for
Southeast Asia, coordinated all these eﬀorts.

Where Experience Meets Technology
When you think of Frank’s, you immediately think
of casing — we’re still the leader in casing services.
After all “Casing is where we made our name.” But
over the years, Frank’s has transformed from a small
casing business into a multi-service tubular company that provides superior equipment and welltrained personnel in the fields of safety, pipe and
fabrication, riser fabrication, connector technology,
hammers, casing and handling tools, cementing
equipment, completion and installation services,
and equipment design and manufacturing.
An often overlooked service is one of the most
notable services Frank’s offers it customers — its
ability to design and manufacture custom/specialty
equipment. When Frank’s opened its manufacturing
department in the mid-1970’s, each piece of equipment was designed, engineered and manufactured
with precision to be durable and dependable.
Equipment manufactured by Frank’s set the
standard for excellence and earned the
reputation of being “Frank’s Tough”.
The development and evolution of Frank’s engineering and
manufacturing departments
allows Frank’s to maintain the
highest standards of safety, efficiency and dependability from
concept to completion.

The New Genesis 7000H
Riser Tong — The “Hercules” Tong
This service was put to the test on the Kikeh deepwater project.
“Engineering and building a new kind of large diameter, high
torque riser tong for the landmark Kikeh development was a monumental effort — but Frank’s Genesis 7000H is in use today and
exceeding all expectations,” said Dave Helmick, Frank’s Manager of
Technical Support. The new tong was designed and purpose built
for Murphy and is being used to make up their threaded drilling
risers. Working under a very short timeline, the tong had to go
from concept to a finished project in less than six months. Material

shortages and a 300,000 ft. lb. torque requirement only added to
the challenge.
The Genesis 7000H, dubbed the Hercules, is track mounted,
remotely operated and will accommodate pipe sizes through 25in. O.D. The unique gripping system exceeds the design requirements for maximum die penetration and torque output specified
by Murphy. The rail system was custom built to interface with
the customer’s spar mounted rig. Make up torque will be monitored and controlled by Frank’s Data-Trek Computer System. Mike
Webre, Frank’s Vice President of Engineering, sums it up best: “This
program was a tough challenge, but our people met it — on time
and as promised,” he said. “The new Genesis 7000H offers operators
a significant new tool for deepwater projects.”

concurrent activity capable rigs, Murphy utilized the Frank’s
stand enabled, air-powered, remote operated Single Joint Slip
Type Elevator system.

More Than 65 Years of Dependable Service

State of the Art Tubular Handling
& Running System
For Kikeh’s trend setting driller riser, Murphy chose an innovative, custom designed and custom built handling system to
augment their choice of the Hercules tong. They chose a double
elevator-shuttle table system with the shuttle table custom built
to fit the rotary of the West Setia and hydraulic side door elevators custom built to fit the connector profile of the riser joints.
This system also includes a specialized heavy capacity weight
compensator and the Stab-Rite.
Also on the project, Murphy chose a variety of Frank’s deepwater specialty tools and systems available in Frank’s extensive
inventory. Frank’s stabber-less Stab-Rite system and the FC-1
based Flow Back Tool were chosen for the casing work. For
their spar and subsea completions with many control lines and
umbilicals, Murphy utilized the Backpacker single joint weight
compensator, the Stab-Rite system, and Frank’s RS-350 Flush

For more than 65 years, Frank’s has served its customers with
a relentless dedication to safety, quality and dependability.
Established in 1938, Frank’s has expanded into international
operations through a separate company, Frank’s International.
Headquartered in Houston, Texas, Frank’s International has bases
in over 50 countries including the two new bases in Malaysia.
Frank’s and Frank’s International both find their roots in the
entrepreneurial spirit and dedication of Mr. Frank Mosing, the
founder of Frank’s. While each is a separate and independent
company, the two organizations cooperate on all levels to meet
the challenges of the worldwide oil industry. Recently both
Frank’s and Frank’s International were honored as the “Best
Oilfield Service Company” in the 2006 EnergyPoint Research Inc.
Customer Satisfaction Survey of Drilling and Wellsite Contractors. The independent customer satisfaction survey summed it
up best as saying, “Frank’s sets the standard when it comes to
installing casing and production tubing around the globe.”

Providing high accuracy
positioning services
Fugro provided rig positioning services to the Ocean
Rover and Ocean Baroness semisubmersibles during
the exploration phase, utilizing its Starﬁx high precision
GPS systems to achieve decimeter accuracy. To ensure
the highest integrity, Fugro operated two independent surface positioning systems. Additionally, Fugro
provided multiple support vessel tracking and control
from the rig for safe anchoring positioning operations,
resulting in fewer oﬀshore personnel required.

Above: High resolution multibeam echosounder, sub-bottom proﬁler data
and all of the relevant 3D seismic data available were loaded into a computer workstation for interpretation, preparation of seaﬂoor images, ﬁnal
graphics and animated seaﬂoor ﬂyovers.

comprehensive overview of seabed topography, features, gradients,
inferred soil variability, geological conditions, seaﬂoor stability, buried
faults, gas and gas hydrates.

Geotechnical site investigation
for each inﬁeld facility
Fugro designed and performed a geotechnical site investigation for
each inﬁeld facility requiring foundation support, including the drilling tender unit, ﬂoating production, storage and oﬄoading (FPSO)
vessel, mobile oﬀshore drilling unit, manifolds and riser tiebacks. The
investigation was performed from the geotechnical drillship SRV
Bavenit, a purpose-built vessel operated by Fugro since 1986 and
with the capability to drill to depths of 1700m and perform seabed
testing to 2000m.
The project scope for each foundation element was diﬀerent as
it was found that soil conditions varied across the site. The following
type of borings, samples and in situ tests were performed to depths
of up to 80 m below seabed: Wheeldrive PCPT’s, Wheeldrive in situ
Vanes, STACOR’s®, Downhole PCPT’s and push samples. During the
course of the investigation it became apparent that due to the presence of sands and stiﬀ clays in an interval of turbid-ﬂow deposits at
shallow depths (15 m) the suction type anchor solutions would not
work for every anchor position. This required a major change in investigation scope moving away from shallow PCPT’s and STACOR’s® to
deep borings for a driven pile design at certain anchor points. Having
a dedicated drillship with permanently installed equipment enabled
maximum ﬂexibility in this regard and led to a successful campaign of
data collection for detailed foundation design.

During the development phase, subsea positioning services
were provided to the Ocean Rover and MV Normand Ivan for the
batch set drilling, ﬂying leads installation and tie-ins. Wideband
acoustics enabled the vessel, ROV and rig positioning operations to
be conducted 2–3 times quicker when compared with conventional
acoustics. An array of reference transponders were placed in seabed
frames around each development site to provide positioning control to better than 30cm during the development well installation
and associated tie-in work.

BJ Services Technology Meets Kikeh Challenges
BJ Services Company proudly supplies coiled tubing services for Murphy Oil Corp. and Petronas Carigali Sdn. Bhd. from the Kikeh spar.
BJ has performed reliable, high-quality coiled tubing (CT) operations on spars from Brazil to the South China Sea. The Kikeh CT operations have been challenging due to the lack of heave compensation
in the derrick.
In the ﬁrst Kikeh CT operation, BJ used its Roto-Jet® nozzle and
a 60% glycol solution to remove a hydrate plug between 1110 and
1650 m. BJ’s exclusive rotary jetting technology uses less ﬂuid than
typical “spray” tools and provides the most eﬀective high-energy pressure jetting for removing tough wellbore deposits. In another Kikeh
CT operation, a BJ unit helped displace a drilling riser to corrosioninhibited seawater.
Beyond CT work, BJ provides nitrogen services aboard Kikeh for
pressurizing the marine tensioner system and well dewatering. In the
dewatering operations, BJ pumps nitrogen down the risers, displacing brine up small capillary lines. Future Kikeh CT operations will
include gas lifting, solids cleanout, ﬁshing, cementing, acidizing and
additional services.

Where crane lift capacities limit the size of CT reels, BJ DuraLink connectors offer an economical way to enter deep or extended-reach wells.

The BJ deepwater portfolio
BJ Services oﬀers a range of unique capabilities to deepwater operators. For example, the BJ DuraLink™ CT connector provides eﬀective
mechanical means to quickly join two CT strings oﬀshore. Where
crane lift capacities limit the size of CT reels, DuraLink connectors oﬀer
an economical way to enter deep or extended-reach wells.
Deepwater cementing is another discipline where BJ technologies oﬀer advantages. LiteSet™ low-density lightweight slurries help
prevent lost circulation in weak formations and provide more consistent downhole properties than competitive lightweight cements.
BJ EnviroSet™ slurries use environmentally acceptable additives that
present little or no risk (PLONOR) as deﬁned by North Sea regulations,
and BJ is the ﬁrst to successfully pump a gas-tight PLONOR slurry on
the Norwegian Continental Shelf. This technology is applicable in any
environmentally sensitive area. BJ XtremeSet™ slurries withstand extreme pressures and temperatures in HPHT wells (where exothermic
chemical reactions can change cement properties). BJ pumped an
XtremeSet slurry in the highest-pressure deepwater GOM well and BJ
experts have developed XtremeSet slurries to perform in bottomhole
temperatures to 600° F (349° C) and pressures to 30,000 psi.
Precision cementing requires advanced equipment. BJ’s innovative new Seahawk™ twin cement units combine advanced density
control with critical component redundancy and unmatched operational ﬂexibility. These high-performance skids improve cementing
reliability and provide back-up pumping capacity for emergency well
control. Seahawk units use an adaptable, automated mixing system
accurate within 0.1 ppg, ensuring precise consistency over a wide
range of slurry weights.
Saving time can be critical for cost-eﬀective deepwater completions, so BJ’s family of ComPlete™ single-trip systems performs all
essential completion tasks with one trip into the wellbore. The ComPlete MST system facilitates gravel- or frac-packed completions across
40

multiple production intervals. It allows ﬂexibility in sand placement,
including positive, selective isolation of all zones during completion,
stimulation and production, eﬀectively reducing completion cycle
time — and cost — by 20 to 40 percent.
Flow assurance is a common concern in deep water. A synergistic
blend of thermodynamic, anti-agglomerate and kinetic chemicals in
BJ Ice-Chek™ inhibitors controls gas hydrate formation and removes
accumulations caused by temperature or pressure changes. Used
with methanol inhibitors and equipment, Ice-Chek technology
reduces required methanol volumes by over 70% with increased
hydrate control.
The insulating properties of BJ InsulGel™ packer ﬂuids protect
deepwater wells where shut-ins or other operations may cause parafﬁn deposition. With greater heat capacity than commonly used gases
at shut-in conditions, and lower thermal conductivity than traditional
packer ﬂuids, InsulGel ﬂuids minimize waxing due to cooling eﬀects
from conduction and convection.
From cementing to completions to well intervention, BJ Services
Company oﬀers one of the industry’s most complete service packages for eﬃcient deepwater operations.

Proﬁle: INTEC Engineering

INTEC provided broad range of
engineering services to Kikeh
INTEC Engineering (INTEC), a leading engineering and project
management company, provides frontier technology leadership for
the oﬀshore energy industry’s most challenging ﬁeld development
projects. Established in 1984, INTEC has oﬃces on four continents, including its headquarters in Houston, as well as Rio de Janeiro; Woking,
England; Delft, The Netherlands; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and Perth,
Australia. This ﬂexibility enables INTEC to execute multi-oﬃce international projects providing our clients technical excellence, execution
eﬃciency and local content.
INTEC brings innovative and cost eﬀective solutions from
concept evaluation, FEED and detailed design, to construction and
commissioning management services, and operations support. Its
technical disciplines include oﬀshore ﬁeld development, oﬀshore
pipelines, marine production risers, subsea systems, and ﬂow assurance and operability.
While part of the industry leading Heerema Group, INTEC has
maintained its independence as trusted advisors to its clients on
oﬀshore oil and gas ﬁeld development and transportation projects
around the world. Our record breaking projects include the ﬁrst
submarine Arctic production pipeline (in Alaska), the longest subsea
gas tie-back to shore (in Egypt), the deepest subsea system (in the
Gulf of Mexico), the largest FPSO (in Nigeria) and now Kikeh, the ﬁrst
deepwater ﬁeld development oﬀshore Malaysia.

Kikeh development execution
In early 2005, INTEC Engineering (SEA) Sdn. Bhd., based in Kuala
Lumpur, was awarded a contract by Murphy Oil to provide “Follow-On
Engineering” services to the Kikeh project team. Under this contract,
INTEC has been deeply involved in Kikeh throughout the execution
phase of the project.
The scope of INTEC’s involvement includes ﬂow assurance, preparation of operating procedure for the subsea production systems and
DTU system and detailed design review of the ﬁeld facilities including
the gas export pipelines. HSE and risk assessment included safety case
development; Hazid/Hazop studies; and construction site occupational safety. INTEC also provided HUC coordination; interface management assistance; technical and personnel support to the construction
management team.

INTEC meets the challenge of several “Firsts”
The Kikeh project presented numerous challenges to the project
team. The project touts several industry ﬁrsts and creates an industry
model for continued deepwater ﬁeld development. The DTU is the
ﬁrst Spar installed outside of the Gulf of Mexico and is also the ﬁrst to
use tender assisted drilling (TAD). The Spar deck was installed using a
catamaran ﬂoat over, another ﬁrst for the Kikeh project.
One of the Kikeh development’s unique features and another
project ﬁrst is the Fluid Transfer Lines (FTL) between the Spar and
the FPSO (1.6 km span). The FTL is a mid-water steel pipe ﬂowline assembly to transfer produced crude from the Spar to the FPSO, return
treated sea water for water injection from the FPSO to the Spar and

provide electrical power, controls and communication between the
FPSO and the Spar. The FTL system was selected to minimize or avoid
hydrate formation and wax deposition risks, slugging and excessive
hydraulic pressure losses. INTEC has made signiﬁcant contributions in
the assessment of system operability issues and in developing operating philosophies/strategies to avoid the formation of hydrate or wax
at any time during system operation.
INTEC also supported Murphy in developing a gas pipeline to
shore through provision of FEED support, bid document preparation
and bid evaluation. This support will extend through the execution
phase of the project. The 12-in. gas pipeline will allow the produced
gas to be monetized rather than re-injected into the reservoir.
To help facilitate a smooth start-up, INTEC will continue to
provide technical support throughout commissioning and through
the ﬁrst few months of operation. Murphy and its partners have
championed a new vision for reliable deepwater development in
Malaysian waters. We’re proud to have contributed our expertise to
such a dynamic project.

Proﬁle: InterMoor, Inc.

InterMoor designs, fabricates and installs
mooring systems worldwide
InterMoor was responsible for the complete delivery of the
Ocean Rover drilling rig preset mooring lines in Murphy
Sabah Oil Company’s Kikeh ﬁeld oﬀshore Malaysia, performing detailed engineering, fabrication and installation of the
suction anchors. Installation occurred during the ﬁrst quarter
2006, marking the ﬁrst-ever use of suction piles for mooring
oﬀ the coast of Malaysia. The permanent drilling rig mooring
system includes a combination of drag embedded anchors
and suction anchors, all of which have subsea connectors.
The mooring spread includes nine drag embedment anchors and associated preset mooring lines. Water depths at
the Kikeh ﬁeld drilling locations range from 4,200–4,400 ft.
The mooring system was designed to allow relocation of
the drilling rig and facilitate drilling operations in an area with
complex subsea architecture that includes permanent mooring systems, ﬂowlines, wells and other structures. Because the
mooring lines are in place for the life of the ﬁeld, an oﬀshore
drilling rig can eﬃciently relocate to the ﬁeld to serve the
ﬁeld’s four drilling centers during the course of development.

The tender assisted rig hooked up to the dry tree unit (spar).

InterMoor’s continued support in Kikeh ﬁeld
InterMoor’s involvement with Murphy’s Kikeh ﬁeld included more
than the design, fabrication and installation of the drilling rig’s mooring system. The company also provided design and fatigue analysis
of the 84-in. Kikeh spar dry tree unit (DTU) and tender assisted drilling
(TAD) driven mooring piles. InterMoor also provided services for the
TAD hookup to the DTU, including procedure development and onsite installation management.
Additionally, InterMoor provided oﬀshore crew services for the
spar’s topside ﬂoat over and hull integration, mooring pile installation, and Hawser hookup between the spar and the tender assisted
drilling unit.

InterMoor provides full range of
mooring services
The oﬀshore industry continues to challenge the boundaries of deep
and ultra-deepwater, moving to drill and produce in water depths approaching 10,000 ft. The industry’s newest rigs can drill in up to 12,000
ft of water. In addition to preset mooring systems, InterMoor provides
conventional mooring installation and retrieval, vessel and platform
towing, hook up and disconnect, wire/chain inserts and pipeline
crossing alternatives.
The company has engineering oﬃces in Houston and Amelia,
Louisiana, and also operates two full service logistic/fabrication yards
in Amelia and Fourchon.

Vast global experience
InterMoor has vast suction pile and pre-set mooring experience
around the world, including many of the industry’s largest development projects ranging from semisubmersible drilling rigs to ﬂoating
production, storage and oﬄoading (FPSO) vessels. Several of its prewww.murphyoilcorp.com

set mooring projects utilize polyester mooring lines in water depths
approaching 7,000 ft. A number of the company’s projects involved
mooring rigs over pipelines.
InterMoor also provides its patented unique suction embedded plate anchor (SEPLA) that is a novel combination of two proven
anchoring concepts. A suction follower similar to a suction anchor is
used to embed a plate anchor deep into the seaﬂoor. The suction follower is retracted when the anchor is at the installation design depth,
and can be reused to install additional plate anchors. Due to their efﬁciency, the plate anchors are up to four times lighter than equivalent
suction anchors, signiﬁcantly reducing costs. Additionally, total project
costs savings can be greater than 50% even though SEPLAs require
use of a suction follower for installation.
InterMoor has also developed a compensated anchor handler
subsea installation method (CASIM) that is a safe and cost eﬀective solution for the deployment of a wide range of subsea hardware, including anchors, subsea trees, manifolds, hammers and pumps. CASIM
utilizes less expensive vessels for the project, minimizes entangling of
rigging, requires less deck space and involves fewer deck operations,
thereby increasing eﬃciency and safety of the operation.

Proﬁle: SBM Offshore

First Malaysian Deepwater FPSO and GAP™ ﬂuid
transfer system for the Kikeh ﬁeld development
SBM Oﬀshore (SBM) supplies, leases and operates ﬂoating production,
storage and oﬄoading (FPSO) and ﬂoating storage and oﬄoading
(FSO) units for numerous major oil and gas projects worldwide. The
Kikeh FPSO is the largest such unit converted in Malaysia and features
the largest external mooring turret ever built. The FPSO was designed
and built in 26 months following contract award from Murphy. The
contract included the charter of the vessel as well as operation and
maintenance of the FPSO for an eight year duration. The 273,000 dwt
FPSO has a storage capacity of 2 million barrels of oil. The ﬁeld’s peak
oil production is 120,000 barrels per day. SBM was also contracted to
supply its patented Gravity Actuated Pipe (GAP™) system for the ﬁeld.

SBM’s Gravity Actuated Pipe (GAP™) system
SBM was contracted for the engineering, procurement, construction
and installation of its GAP™ system for the transfer of multiple live
produced ﬂuids between the spar Dry Tree Unit (DTU) and FPSO Kikeh
over a distance of 1,600 meters. This near-surface ﬂuid transfer system
signiﬁcantly reduces ﬂow assurance problems caused by hydrate
formation and waxing. The GAP™ bundle consists of a neutrally buoyant steel carrier pipe supporting steel ﬂowlines and a power/control
umbilical. The bundle is tensioned at a depth of approximately 200
meters below the water surface by a combination of chains and
weights. Fluid transfer between the ends of the ﬂowlines and the
FPSO and DTU is by means of ﬂexible lines.

The FPSO Kikeh’s external turret mooring is the largest and heaviest
external turret ever built by SBM.
The FPSO’s topsides consist of 15 modules and the central pipe
rack, which provides all of the interconnections between the various
modules, between the modules and the turret, and between the
modules and the vessel’s systems. Among the modules are high
pressure and low pressure separators, centrifugal gas compressors,
injection pumps, heating system, gas turbine driven power generators, and seawater treatment equipment.

Largest and heaviest turret built by SBM

SBM’s patented Gravity Actuated Pipe (GAP™) near-surface ﬂuid transfer system signiﬁcantly reduces ﬂow assurance problems caused by hydrate
formation and waxing.

FPSO Kikeh converted from a VLCC tanker
The former Stena Conductor, which was one of several VLCCs
purchased by SBM, was delivered to Malaysian Marine and Heavy
Engineering for conversion, outﬁtting and integration work. The FPSO
is owned and operated by Malaysian Deepwater Floating Terminal
(Kikeh) Ltd. (MDFT), a joint venture company between Malaysia International Shipping Corp. (MISC) and SBM.
The unit’s machinery space provides general services including
steam, fresh water, ﬁrewater and foam, diesel and power for the
accommodation and marine systems. Two 12 Mw steam turbines
powered from the vessel’s refurbished original boilers provide
power for the topside facilities. The boilers were converted to run on
both oil and gas.

The FPSO’s external turret mooring is the largest and heaviest external turret ever built by SBM. The external turret mooring provides
FPSO Kikeh’s permanent mooring. The turret also provides the ﬂuid
transfer and control functions to and from the FPSO to the DTU.
SBM pioneered the design during the early 1980s and the concept
became reality in 1985 when an external turret was ﬁtted to the
stern of a 140,000 dwt ﬂoating storage and oﬄoading (FSO) vessel.
A year later, SBM supplied an external disconnectable Riser Turret
Mooring (RTM) system for an FPSO in a cyclone prone region oﬀ the
north coast of Australia. SBM has supplied forty-nine diﬀerent types
of turrets to date worldwide.
SBM is proud to be involved in this monumental project marking
the ﬁrst converted Malaysian FPSO and the ﬁrst usage of the GAP™
ﬂuid transfer system.

Proﬁle: Technip

Technip’s innovative solutions support the success
of Murphy’s deepwater Kikeh ﬁeld
Technip was contracted by Murphy Oil Corp. for the engineering,
procurement, construction, installation and commissioning (EPCIC) of
the Kikeh spar production platform. The contract included the topsides
facilities, hull, mooring system and riser and wellhead system for the dry
trees. The 12,000 ton spar hull was fabricated and installed within a very
tight time frame of only 23 months from contract award to completion
of the topsides installation oﬀshore.
Technip’s Malaysian engineering center in Kuala Lumpur managed
the entire project as well as designed the spar’s topsides and provided
topsides installation. The Group’s subsidiaries in Perth, Houston and
Pori, Finland provided support for the project including riser system
engineering and the spar hull detailed engineering. Technip continues
to assist in the project through its support maintenance team.

Technip provides Kikeh pipeline and riser system
Technip also was awarded the contract for the engineering, design,
supply and installation of the Kikeh development area subsea pipeline

AIChE focusing on undergrad
retention to build chemical
engineering talent pool
By Bob Williams, Managing Editor

The American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) is moving aggressively
to build up the talent pool of chemical engineers so desperately needed by
the petroleum processing and other industries.
Efforts are focused on retaining undergraduates in chemical engineering
and stemming the tide of students leaving the discipline, developing and
maintaining online and other career development resources, and utilizing
retirees to a greater extent in knowledge transfer.
Those are the key strategies for the organization as it moves into its centennial year, according to Larry Evans, 2007 AIChE president and founder and
former chairman (until his retirement in 2005) of Aspen Technology. AIChE was
founded in 1908 with 500 members. Today it is the world’s leading organization for chemical engineering professionals, with more than 40,000 members
from 93 countries.

CURRENT STATE OF INDUSTRY
Evans acknowledges that there is a strong need for more chemical engineers across the breadth of the reﬁning, petrochemicals, and gas processing
industries—as well as in other industries.
“My sense is that all ﬁrms are becoming more aggressive about stafﬁng
and that this will continue in the upcoming year,” he says. “The key, of course,
is attracting the right number and the right caliber of engineers.”
Evans ﬁnds it difﬁcult to single out just one critical stafﬁng need for chemical engineers in the petroleum processing industry, given the breadth of
industry operations.
“The key for many ﬁrms is to think long-term and understand the stafﬁng
issues they will face over the next 5-10 years, and to be appropriately prepared,” he notes.

Evans is optimistic that “today’s energy challenges are likely to capture the
imagination of a new generation excited by technological possibility. However, we are not leaving anything to chance, either.”
For starters, AIChE is taking steps to encourage improved retention of current chemical engineering students at the undergraduate level.
“The fact is we still have too many students leaving chemical engineering between their sophomore and senior years,” Evans says. “So AIChE just
launched a program to give all undergraduate chemical engineering students a free membership in AIChE. We believe the exposure they will gain to
mentors and to other chemical engineering students and professionals will
hopefully help stem some of the attrition.”
AIChE’s energy-speciﬁc initiatives directed at students include some

attractive incentives.
“Recognizing that sometimes the best way to capture a young engineer’s
imagination is to offer a reward, AIChE is launching a prize competition for
undergraduate chemical engineering students,” Evans notes. “This competition will ask participants to address one of the industry’s pressing technological
concerns. Students may compete individually or in teams for one of 24 prizes
to be awarded annually.
“Likewise, to encourage more graduate students to turn their interest
towards energy issues, AIChE is establishing a number of energy research
fellowships. Those selected for the fellowships will focus their efforts on energyrelated issues, including those facing the [petroleum processing] industry.”

ADVICE FOR YOUNG ENGINEERS
Evans offers this advice to a young chemical engineer considering employment in the petroleum processing industries:
“If you want to make a difference by solving problems that help make
the world a better place, then go for it!” he says. “Learn as much as you can
while you’re in school about chemical engineering, leadership, and world
economics. I’d make a special effort to learn more about different cultures.
Today’s petroleum processing industry is a global business, and ambitious
engineers must be comfortable in a multinational and multicultural environment. So use your time at your university to develop colleagues from other
nations. That global network could come in handy!”

UTILIZING RETIREES
The AIChE president also thinks that retired chemical engineers can be an
invaluable resource in addressing stafﬁng issues in the petroleum processing
industries.
“Retirees hold large amounts of tacit knowledge, and it is to a ﬁrm’s competitive advantage to capture as much of that knowledge in whatever ways
it can,” Evans says. “Methodologies to capture that knowledge include creating a computer-based expert system around key decision and logic trees;
videotaping a retiree discussing how they did a particular job, or made a
particular decision; asking the retiree to teach training classes of younger
engineers; and having the retiree do actual work part time while assigning a
full-time ‘understudy.’
“For many experienced engineers, passing on their knowledge and experience in this way can be tremendously rewarding.”
How to take the most effec-

tive career development

Evans has a simple response to the question of how to take the most effective career development steps for a chemical engineer today: “That’s easy:
work and more work. Gain real experience as quickly as possible and continue to build your knowledge base. In the demanding environment facing
engineers today, keeping current and being committed to lifelong learning
are a must.”
Evans also recommends that young engineers get involved in leadership
activities outside of work early in their careers.
“That way they can develop leadership skills simultaneously with developing chemical engineering skills,” he says.
Evans cites AIChE’s Young Professionals advisory group and its implementation of special programs at the association’s national meetings to help
younger engineers gain technical as well as leadership skills.
Given time and staff constraints in the petroleum processing industries
today, it’s a challenge for chemical engineers to expeditiously pursue continuing education today, Evans acknowledges.
Still, he asserts,“Not all education comes in a classroom.The ability to have
the majority of information available anytime, anyplace, asynchronously,
makes a big difference in today’s educational processes. Universities are
reaching out to nonconventional students in unconventional ways, so there
are many options if one really wants to learn new information.
“In any case, today’s reality is that the onus is on the professional to do so,
and our job is to provide the tools and venues that enable them to do it in the
manner that’s best for their situation.”

AICHE CAREER DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES
AIChE offers a wide variety of resources for career development for the chemical engineer, Evans says.
“Today’s engineer faces an ever-changing work environment that for
many will include periods at both larger and smaller ﬁrms and, for some,
self-employment,” he notes. “Part of AIChE’s mission is to serve as the Lifetime
Center for professional and personal growth, and we’ve dedicated signiﬁ-

cant resources to delivering both technical information and the ‘soft skills’ so
critical in today’s workplace.”
These efforts include face-to-face seminars at national and local meetings and mentoring of young professionals by members who are established
in their careers, Evans points out.
“And because we live in a wired world, we’ve taken our efforts onto the
web,” he adds. “We’re currently offering a series of soft-skills webinars that are
free for members but available to nonmembers at a modest cost.
“In addition, we continue to publish technical books, guidelines, and
papers. Members who are located at some remove from an AIChE local section can connect through our Virtual Local Section.”
Engineers who own their own businesses, as well as those who work in
commercial ﬁrms, can use tools such as the AIChE eLibrary to level the playing ﬁeld, says Evans. In addition, members have access to a suite of career
development tools from CareerTools Plus.
“So if the member is willing to make the effort, we can provide them the
tools they need to help them succeed,” Evans says. “Any of your readers who
are interested in the details should visit www.aiche.org.”

Parker Drilling’s Bullard:
People skills key to toolpusher’s
success
By Bob Williams, Managing Editor

People skills and the ability to manage personnel are critical to a toolpusher’s
successful job performance, says Parker Drilling Co.’s Tom Bullard.
And those skills are especially important while taking on the responsibility
for everyone’s safety in a hazardous working environment.
Bullard is toolpusher on Parker’s Barge Rig 77B, which is the newest rig in the
drilling contractor’s Gulf of Mexico ﬂeet and currently operates in ultra-shallow and open waters in the gulf. The barge rig, with a drilling depth capacity
of 30,000 ft, is specially equipped for drilling high-temperature/high pressure wells. Because of the extremely high temperatures and high pressures
encountered downhole, the risk of tool or even well failure is high, and that
raises the risk for dangerous situations compared with drilling conventional
oil and natural gas wells.
But that’s icing on the cake for Bullard: “I love the challenge of managing
a drilling rig that is drilling deep, critical wells.”
Bullard, who says he also enjoys the schedule of working 7 days on and 7
days off on a barge rig, has been with Parker Drilling for 20 years. Overall, he
has worked on offshore rigs for 31 years.

In short, a toolpusher has a big responsibility, overseeing all operations on
a drilling rig.
A less colorful title would be rig manager; on some offshore mobile drilling rigs or drillships, he’s known as head of the drilling department.
The toolpusher hires and manages the entire drilling crew, plans schedules, and makes sure that the rig meets all safety requirements. Toolpushers
also are in charge of keeping the rig provided with all needed tools, equipment, and supplies. In addition, a toolpusher will engage third-party
companies for specialized drilling support services.
Typically a toolpusher works closely with the drilling superintendent of
the company operating a well, coordinating the drilling plan and execution. He also serves as the liaison with any operating company personnel or
other visitors to the rig.
The job in recent years has evolved from that of a “rig boss” to more of an
administrative role, “pushing paper” as much as pushing tools, i.e., paperwork related to payroll, beneﬁts, and the like.
Although a toolpusher typically directs drilling operations from his ofﬁce,
he also must be prepared to ﬁll in on the rig ﬂoor if needed.

TOOLPUSHER QUALIFICATIONS
Typically, a toolpusher is someone who has started as a roughneck or roustabout on a drilling crew and has worked his way up through the ranks.

Experience is essential to becoming a toolpusher. No drilling contractor
would entrust the safety of a rig and its crew to someone without adequate
experience on drilling crews—4 years’ worth, at a minimum, including a stint
as a driller.
That kind of experience and understanding of all drilling operations and
activity on a drilling rig is needed in order to direct and monitor drilling operations ranging from move-in and rig-up to rig-down and move-out.
A toolpusher should be level-headed, quick-witted, have common sense,
and show a real dedication to safe working conditions.
Safety is Job No. 1 on every drilling rig. There are always risks of falling or
getting snagged by or hit by equipment, and the industry must follow the strictest of occupational safety and health standards. In the event of an accident
or an emergency, it falls to the toolpusher to secure the well and the rig and
ensure the safety of everyone on the rig, including organizing and controlling
evacuation of personnel.
A toolpusher also must be well-organized, due to his responsibility for
delegating and scheduling a wide variety of tasks that arise during drilling
among roustabouts, roughnecks, drillers, and other derrick hands.
Although a college degree isn’t required, it’s expected that a toolpusher
have some basic mathematics and physics knowledge in order to anticipate
and deal with the huge and sometimes unpredictable physical forces and
downhole conditions encountered in drilling a well several miles below the
earth’s surface.

skills also come into play for
a toolpusher in setting up a
drilling schedule and then
dovetailing work shifts with that
schedule.
Another crucial aspect of a
successful toolpusher is good
communication skills. A rig crew
must be work as a well-oiled
machine, so clearly communicating instructions is important
for sustaining efﬁciency and
avoiding accidents.
Physical ﬁtness and stamina
also are important in a toolpusher, given the occasional
need for getting on the rig ﬂoor
to lend a hand.
Being away from home for
long periods of time is one drawback to the job. Although some rig workers
working in the Gulf of Mexico might be on duty 1-2 weeks and off the same,
with home just a short plane ride away, rig workers in overseas operations
might not see home for months at a time.
In the end, leadership qualities and a dedication to safety are what drilling contractors look for most in a toolpusher.

responsibility.”

In Bullard’s view, a toolpusher’s qualiﬁcations and responsibilities include the
following.
“A toolpusher:
• Maintains a safe working environment.
• Plans various rig activities such as repairs, daily maintenance of drilling ﬂuids, rigging up or down, etc. Sees that activities are coordinated
efﬁciently.
• Coordinates safety meetings and pre-job safety meetings.
• Must have excellent well control skills.
• Sustains the upkeep of rig equipment and suggests improvements.
• Maintains the paperwork (including morning reports, IADC daily log
report, etc.).
• Keeps the superintendent updated on operations; inspects for hidden
hazards; inspects lifesaving equipment and safety equipment.
• Coordinates rig move with staff.
• Plans job repair and maintenance; orders rig supplies, parts, and
materials.
• Is responsible for compliance with all government regulations.
• Must be able to perform ﬁrst aid/CPR.”
In addition, being on a barge rig takes it up a notch, according to Bullard:

“Toolpushers on barge rigs work with a smaller crew than toolpushers on
other offshore rigs and therefore have greater responsibilities in keeping
crews on board safe, alert, and focused on their jobs.”
During a typical work day for Bullard, he would be:
• “Having a meeting with all employees to discuss the tasks that we are
facing and how we will accomplish those tasks in a safe and productive
manner.
• Discussing well and rig issues with the operator’s representative.
• Keeping all personnel issues taken care of.
• Always seeing that everyone is doing their job a safe manner.”
For Bullard, the biggest change for toolpushers today compared with how
the job was conducted in the past is that “toolpushers [today] do much
more personal training with crew members due to ﬂuctuating personnel.”
Noting that toolpushers generally have worked their way through the ranks
of a drilling rig crew, Bullard offers this advice to anyone considering a career
as a toolpusher:
“Personally, I would recommend setting your goals higher than you can
reach, always having a plan, working as a team member, and having a
strong sense of responsibility.”
For a good long-term career goal, Bullard recommends “working with a
well-established company that continues to grow, trains, and provides opportunities for their employees. That’s a true strong statement!” ◊

New online tool helps recruit
retired oil personnel for
occasional work
By Bob Williams, Managing Editor

A leading executive recruiter in the petroleum industry has developed a new
web-enabled software and database designed to more fully utilize the large
and growing talent pool of retired oil and gas professionals.
The Expert Alumni service is intended to tap the sorely needed knowledge
and hands-on experience of oil and gas industry professionals who have
retired from the industry but still want to stay involved to a limited degree—in
particular not wanting to return to permanent employment. With the prospect of half of the petroleum industry’s geoscientists, engineers, and other
professionals looking to retire in the next 5–10 years, such a service is seen as
an attractive solution to the much-talked-about “brain drain” that already is
hobbling the industry today and is expected to worsen in the coming years.
Jon Glesinger, principal of The Glesinger Partnership Ltd., London, describes
the Expert Alumni service as a proﬁling software designed to capture the
“career DNA” of retired petroleum industry professionals. Easily navigated
and customizable to be as complex or as easy as the professional wants it
to be, Expert Alumni helps the retired professional create a proﬁle that details
not only expertise and experience but also his or her preferences for limited work engagements. This provides a comprehensive tool that allows the
Glesinger executive recruiting consultancy to match the right retiree with
oil and gas operating and service/supply companies’ temporary or limited
needs—from mentoring individuals to managing projects. It also serves to
help develop an expert faculty for training and certiﬁcation of professionals
in various disciplines.

EXPERT ALUMNI

Glesinger on new webenabled proﬁling tool:
“What we’re doing with the
Expert Alumni technology...
will effectively be able to
proﬁle a career DNA.”

10

Glesinger maintains that Expert Alumni is really all about creating and managing data.
“We’re just doing it in a more complex way than what we really do in
the headhunting business,” he says. “I’m not decrying the industry at all,
because while Expert Alumni is doing what it says ‘on the box,’ we also have
the Glesinger Partnership, which is doing some headhunting, so it’s still a
good business.”
In a conventional “headhunting” exercise, the executive recruiter charged
with a search would seek a professional who is already working at the kind of
position that needs to be ﬁlled.
“Now that person’s background is obviously important, but it’s not a critical
factor in the top end of the search; it’s not my main criteria what you could do
20 years ago, it’s what your doing currently that’s interesting. The complexity
of [a typical executive] search mechanism is pretty much nonexistent.
“But what we’re doing with the Expert Alumni technology...will effectively be
able to proﬁle a career DNA, if you will, so we’ve all got our career footprint.”

Glesinger gave as an a example a new plant manager at a reﬁning complex in Baytown, Tex., who’s been promoted “a little too quickly” and needs
some hands-on guidance.
The client might say,“We’re looking for somebody who can actually understand what’s going on with this guy rather than, ‘Oh, yeah, here’s a fellow
who’s been running a plant for 20 years,’” Glesinger offers. “It might not really
be a good match, or he might not really know what’s going on, so we’re putting a lot of things in place that will help clients be much more discerning
about who they’re actually going to be hiring. And, of course, we’re hoping
the candidates themselves will be more speciﬁc about what they want to be
doing now that they’re not working full time and possibly don’t have to.”
Typically, a fresh retiree seeking to continue part-time and/or occasional
work would use the Expert Alumni online database to register himself and
produce a proﬁle as complex or as uncomplicated as he prefers. Client
companies would contact The Glesinger Partnership to recruit a retiree for
temporary or part-time assignments. The consultancy in turn searches the
Expert Alumni database to pinpoint the right candidate and then connect
client with prospect.
“It’s very much like a recruitment thing at that level, but it’s also managing
people’s interests and desires to determine what their work pattern is going
to be: This is X, actually, he doesn’t do Mondays, and he plays golf on Fridays,
so during the 3 days in the middle, what do you want?
“We can look at career DNA. We’ll also be storing information—again,

as complicated or easy as you’d want—things like, ‘Do you still go to SPE
meetings?’”
The Glesinger Partnership has been in talks with the Society of Petroleum
Engineers about working together to add further detail and credibility to the
Expert Alumni database professional proﬁles.

MENTORING

Glesinger on the Expert
Alumni recruiting target:
“The boomers who are
retiring now from the
majors are ﬁnancially independent, but they may
have an afﬁnity to go back
to work. It’s just that they’re
not going to back on
the same terms to do the
same job with the same
company. This is where the
system works nicely, where
the guy who’s worked 30
years at Halliburton or Shell
doesn’t necessarily want
to go back to Halliburton
or Shell and just carry on
where he left off. But he
might have huge value
for another company in a
reduced capacity and in
a slightly different job that
takes advantage of his
career experience rather
than being the product of
the last book that he wrote.
He’s the product of his
entire career.”

Glesinger’s consultancy also has been working with Robert Gordon University,
Aberdeen, and Rice University, Houston, to provide mentoring accreditation
at distance- mentoring facilities.
“Robert Gordon University has a lot of technology and experience and
capability to provide for this sort of distance-mentoring; they also have a
mentoring and accreditation program,” he says. “For example, if you were
looking at twin brothers with identical experience and you want to mentor
them, say that Brother A is accredited and Brother B is not—now you’ve got
two choices.”
Mentoring training is partly classroom-based and partly online, Glesinger
notes, adding that Robert Gordon University has developed some criteria by
which to measure potential mentors,“as educators know how to do.” SPE also
has an electronic mentoring program.
Other organizations developing mentoring accreditation include the
London-based Energy Institute, which is working with Glesinger and recently
named him a Fellow on the basis of a study he did on the effects of the aging
workforce on the oil and gas industry’s leadership.
Glesinger takes pains to differentiate mentoring from coaching.
“Coaching is a lot like counseling, and it might include elements of mentoring. But mentoring has a lot more to do with speciﬁc on-the-job training,
such as ‘Don’t touch that button, it’s dangerous’ or “When I was faced with
this situation back in days when we were trying to prevent Thunder Horse from
falling over, if we’d done the following things, it might have been different, so
you might like to think about those things.”
In short, mentoring has more to do with direct, hands-on sharing of
experience.
“[It’s] not necessarily teaching, although I think that is a direct outcome,”
Glesinger adds.“I think it has more to do with providing a shoulder to lean on,
the place to go to for advice, and the person to go to who can say, ‘Do you
really think that’s a clever idea? Or, ‘Yeah, that’s fantastic.’”
Mentoring is growing in importance for the oil and gas industry because
of the tremendous value offered by retired professionals who come back into
the workforce.
“I won’t be so dramatic as to say that the industry can’t possible survive
without these people, but it sure is going to be difﬁcult,” Glesinger says, citing
a recent Cambridge Energy Research Associates study that pointed to skills
shortages and burgeoning retirements of professionals creating a major stumbling block for a lot of projects going forward, high project cost overruns, etc.
“Mentoring is an important part of what we’re providing with Expert
Alumni.”

PART-TIME AND TEMPORARY ENGAGEMENTS
The Expert Alumni service also provides clients with the opportunity to locate
professionals with just the right kind of expertise in high-need temporary or
part-time assignments.
“If someone at Total [SA] comes to me tomorrow morning and says,‘I need
someone to go to Tulsa, Okla., to just run through some labor relations stuff for
3 days next week, what have you got’—then we can do that.
“The focus is more on the people and the time rather than the pure contractor mentality, which is different. If I want to contract you a scientist, I’m
going to give any number of [candidates] a call, and I’m going to get someone under contract. Those people I consider mainstream workforce, whereas
the retired people, they’ve got a different view on life. “This is where the baby
boomers meet Generation Y. The baby boomers say,‘I want to do what I want
when I want and how I want,’ and they’ll have the means to do it. The Generation Y types are going to run out of cash. The boomers who are retiring now
from the majors are ﬁnancially independent, but they may have an afﬁnity to
go back to work. It’s just that they’re not going to back on the same terms to
do the same job with the same company.
“This is where the system works nicely, where the guy who’s worked 30

of the last book that he wrote. He’s the product of his entire career.”
The lack of complications over beneﬁts and pay are part of the real value
that Glesinger sees for his clients in taking on retired professionals for temporary or part-time assignments,
“Retirees have their own arrangements,” he says. “Their beneﬁts and pay
are much less complicated because they’re independent. The nature of the
beneﬁts they’re looking for is quite different. In a lot of cases, they already
have their pensions and their medical care taken care of. It’s a lot less complicated than hiring people directly.”

COMPANY-DIRECTED DATABASES
The other major area where Expert Alumni is going to provide service is
directed to companies who want their own alumni database.
“Basically what we can do is effectively replicate the Expert Alumni
database or its technology, and we can ‘own-brand,’ if you will, let’s say, for
Halliburton, Shell, ExxonMobil, or Schlumberger,” Glesinger says. “Very few of
these companies have extensive alumni databases, and we can put that
technology to good use. We can provide them with consulting services so
that they can understand what they’re actually trying to achieve through this.
We can provide them with web-enabled software solutions that will be a corporate alumni database that either can or doesn’t link into Expert Alumni. So
you can have this big central database and all these little satellites around it,
providing companies’ access to their own [pool of retired personnel]. So you
don’t have to come to us; you can set up your own thing.”
Early feedback on Expert Alumni has been extremely positive, says
Glesinger. Although he wasn’t set up to undertake assignments for Expert
Alumni just yet, one client had two immediate opportunities.
Another client found the concept ideal for setting up training centers of
excellence around the country: “They don’t have enough people to do it,
they don’t have the people to set it up, and they need a ﬂexible workforce
to run one full-time course. You would probably need three part-timers, and
you would need to schedule that, so that was a slightly different application.
The database is set up so that we can handle the scheduling. That might
well turn into a headhunt as well, because they would need a full-time senior
manager to run the program.”
The other aspect to consider is the difﬁculty that companies in Europe and
the US encounter in bringing their own former employees back into the fold
under temporary or part-time arrangements because of legal complications
over tax and beneﬁts issues.
“The difﬁculties [with tax and beneﬁts issues] are not insurmountable, but
it’s not a slam-dunk, either, so again, we’re providing a service in that area.”

TEACHING FACULTY
Another initiative Glesinger is undertaking with Expert Alumni is a Houstonbased effort to provide a supply of professionals with the right mix of expertise
and capabilities who can be developed into a teaching faculty for technical
training purposes.
“There aren’t enough people in education now, and the retired fraternity

provides a unique and ideal talent pool because they have knowledge and
experience, and they’ve got the desire because they want to get out of the
house and do something different from playing golf, but they don’t want to be
in a high-pressure job every day. This sort of transfer of knowledge is fantastic.
“We’ve been asked about people who would be interim managers—‘Is
there someone on the Expert Alumni database who can go here and do
that for a little while and then stop?’—to set up a special program or set up
a new department somewhere without some of the long-term effects or the
complexities attached to just adding more contractors.”

ADAPTABILITY
Glesinger thinks that Expert Alumni will quickly evolve into a multi-sector
product because “it’s not just the energy sector that’s affected by the aging
population, it’s every sector: automotive, IT, construction—the guys who have
all the experience are baby boomers who are looking at retirement.”
Glesinger says his consultancy is already looking to expand Expert Alumni
into other business sectors now.
In addition, Expert Alumni can provide additional proﬁle services to
existing member communities of other organizations such as SPE and the
Energy Institute.
“There are ways we can enhance [proﬁles of] members of Expert Alumni
with other things, keeping them up to date with information about other
things so that you’ve got more of a single place to go to manage work-

related stuff, like, ‘Am I up to date with the latest papers that are coming out
of the institutes,’ or ‘Am I attending training opportunities?’
“The sky’s the limit; if the membership is big enough and willing enough,
they may well be interested in other products and services to boot.”

FOREIGN PERSONNEL
Glesinger doesn’t see signiﬁcant relief to alleviate the petroleum industry’s
shortage of skilled staff, as is speculated in some quarters, coming from rapidly developing countries with large populations of well-educated technical
professionals.
“Some consulting ﬁrm said, ‘We’ve got to wake up to the fact that there’s
a lot of talent in China, India, and Brazil, and we should go and hire them,’
but it’s not really that simple,” he asserts. “You’re in competition with the indigenous workforce and the indigenous companies, which is quite political to
start with. While some people do aspire to work for western companies, I think
we need to get over ourselves a little bit and realize that’s not necessarily the
case. Not everybody wants to work for western companies and their western
ways because they may just not want to—anymore than we’d necessarily
want to work for, say Petrochina or Reliant.
“It’s a very different world. I know a very senior guy who went to work over
in India and found that it’s so wildly different culturally—not just the country
but the corporate culture as well—that it was beyond his wildest dreams and
imagination. Once the honeymoon’s over, suddenly it’s not his wife’s cup of
tea, so she’s going to move back to England. What started out as a great
idea and a ﬁne adventure for a little while, now he’s...suddenly ﬁnding himself
in very awkward situation and thinking, ‘Well, I’m not sure I want to do this.’
How much of your retirement are you going to want to do that?
“So I don’t think we’re going to ﬁnd that all of these foreign workers will
suddenly come into Europe or North America—not to mention the immigration issues that we’re facing that still exist. The NOCs [national oil companies]
are as interested in the baby boomers as much as the IOCs [international oil
companies] are.”
Glesinger adds, “We’ll be providing a service that will appeal to the Indias
and the Chinas as much as it does the Americans and the Brits.”

EXPERT ALUMNI ROLLOUT
Glesinger at presstime in October was in the process of rolling out the launch
of Expert Alumni and expected to have an online presence by early November and to be fully up and running by yearend. The website address will be
www.ExpertAlumni.com. Retired professionals at that time can start creating
their own proﬁles.
He promises that the website will very easy to navigate and that developing a proﬁle will be a straightforward process.
“Compared with other job sites, an important feature is its simplicity and
ease of use,” he explains.“It can go very deep but isn’t very wide. People sign
up to be available in the way they want to be available.”
Glesinger isn’t concerned about competition from other, established job
search websites that offer extensive CV data access at a low cost.

“It may seem cost-effective, but people these days are so pushed for time
that they don’t have the time to troll through the entire database,” he contends. “You have a lot of potential applicants, but you don’t know whether
any of them are any good. If you’re a stafﬁng guy and you’re already short of
time, you deﬁnitely don’t have time for doing more.
“We’re offering a graduated service. There are assisted and super-assisted
services...We’re offering people the opportunity to say, ‘Take care of this for
me and just give me a short list,’ and we will deliver the goods.”
Using the focused approach that Expert Alumni offers also will help avoid
the problem of the talent candidates being deluged with e-mails from a lot
of companies, Glesinger adds:
“It’s still a high-touch service, we’re not just automating everything.”
The consultancy will be incorporated in Houston as The Glesinger Partnership Inc. and in London as The Glesinger Partnership Ltd., while the
web-enabled proﬁling services will be known in Houston as Expert Alumni Inc.
and in London as Expert Alumni Ltd.
Prior to forming The Glesinger Partnership, Glesinger headed the oil and
gas branch of UK-based executive search ﬁrm Norman Broadbent. ◊

Recruiter: Staff shortage fix
requires petroleum company
leadership
By Bob Williams, Managing Editor

Fixing the U.S. petroleum industry’s stafﬁng problems will require leadership
from oil and gas companies, according to one of the industry’s leading
executive recruiters.
At the moment, that leadership is lacking, said Mike Ayling, president of
Tulsa-based MLA Resources Inc. (www.malresources.com).
__________________
Ayling, involved in the personnel recruiting business since 1975, founded
MLA Resources in 1981 and is its president. He previously was a personnel
director for an integrated international oil and gas company.
Ayling specializes in recruiting geologists and geophysicists, and, to a
lesser degree, petroleum engineers, landmen, and computer support technicians. He also conducts annual salary surveys for the American Association
of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) and Society of Petroleum Engineers.

Demonstrating leadership and commitment is the best recruiting tool for
securing skilled professional talent in the US, although that is not the preferred tool being used by oil and gas companies today. says Ayling.
“The tool that’s being the most used is money,” he said.“I’ve regularly seen
salaries for 20+-year people in the $150,000-160,000 range. He also recently
heard from a fellow recruiter of an individual being offered $250,000—for a
staff job.
“So simply buying what they can’t produce themselves seems to be the
most expedient choice. I’m not sure that that’s the most effective way to do
things. When you start talking about salaries at that level, money—even with
the somewhat better tax policy now—becomes a bit irrelevant.”
Ayling contends that the best way for US oil and gas companies to attract
quality candidates for a geoscience or engineering position is “some conﬁdence that the company that they’re going to work for is going to stay
around. And some sense of mission that is not just verbally communicated
but is communicated by action.
“Everybody likes to be part of a winning team, a team that’s doing something and accomplishing something. And the people who I talk to that
aren’t interested in changing jobs are the ones that feel that that’s the case
where they are.”
According to Ayling, it isn’t a question of whether or not a skilled technical professional can earn more money somewhere else, it’s a question of
“am I convinced that what I’m doing is really going somewhere, that these
people are in it for the long haul—or that this is a company where the
stated goal is to build it up and then sell it in 3 years.”
Ayling tells his clients that while paying a competitive salary is necessary,

they need to convince prospective recruits of their commitment by their
actions, not their words.
“You can talk all you want. But if you are committed to moving forward
and exploring and ﬁnding oil and gas, and they feel that they’re a part of
it and that their decisions and input are valued, and that they’re a valued
member of the team, then that goes a long, long way.”

INDUSTRY IMAGE

“[When it comes to recruiting], you can talk all you
want. But if you are committed to moving forward
and exploring and ﬁnding
oil and gas, and they feel
that they’re a part of it and
that their decisions and
input are valued, and that
they’re a valued member
of the team, then that
goes a long, long way.”
— Mike Ayling,
president,
MLA Resources Inc.

Ayling acknowledges that one of the hurdles for a recruiter in the US these
days is dealing with the industry’s negative image.
“A lot of the guys that are teaching at universities are guys that got laid
off in the industry, and they’ve got a pretty negative attitude towards the
industry, and that doesn’t help,” he said. “I think that you need to send some
of the big guns, some of the famous people in the industry, out to these universities and talk to the students, talk to them realistically about what sort of
future there is in the industry. I think the industry itself has not done a great
job at doing its own publicity about itself.”
Another issue is the broad public perception that the petroleum industry
is not environmentally friendly.
“The industry has reputation of not caring about the environment, and I
think that that’s really unfortunate because it’s not true,” Ayling said. “For the
most part, they do care about the environment. If the industry did a better
job of publicizing what it does right, instead of trying to hide when it does
something wrong, then it would help.”
Another issue frequently cited as a hurdle for attracting young people
to the industry is its historical boom-and-bust cycles. But cyclicality isn’t an
issue in recruiting seasoned professionals, Ayling contends.
“I don’t think that people are concerned about cyclicality in the industry
right now. Even if the price of oil were to plummet to $40/bbl, that’s a whole
better than $17,” he said. “In terms of cyclicality—in terms of people—most
companies are absolutely desperate for people. There aren’t any.
“So many people have left the industry, there are so few young ones
coming into the industry, and there is so little training going on in the industry, that most people are not concerned about whether they’ll be able to
ﬁnd another job. A large number of them really don’t think that this [up
cycle] has to last very long, because they’re close to retirement anyway. A
guy 54 years old isn’t looking for another 30 years.
“The average age of a geologist is close to that 54 right now, and for a
petroleum engineer, I’m sure it’s not too much different.
But the industry’s negative image nevertheless remains a hurdle for
attracting young talent to its ranks—a view underscored by the dearth of
university students on an oil and gas career path.
“I was at the AAPG convention last spring, and I walked back one evening with a young guy who was a student from the University of Texas,”
Ayling recounted. “I was rather impressed when he told me that they had
200 people in the geology department. Then I found out that almost half of
them were foreign. And almost another half of them are interested only in
environmental geology. And that got the number down to maybe 50, and

that was spread among 6 years of study...That’s a drop in the bucket.
“The other serious problem is that when these young people come out
of school, there’s nobody there to train them.”
Training a geologist is especially difﬁcult because it is an interpretive science, Ayling noted.
“You certainly don’t want people to overlook data, and there are some
things that can be trained, like how to draw a map. But [stimulating] the
ability to see the forest for the trees, the ability to recognize a prospect,
[while avoiding] the danger of crushing somebody so that they quit recognizing prospects, that’s a bit tricky. For an engineer, it might be a bit more
straightforward.”
If he were to advise a young person to pursue petroleum geology as a
career, Ayling said he would ﬁrst question the person’s underlying motive.
“If they said they liked solving difﬁcult problems acting on a limited
amount of information, and they really liked the challenge of understanding
how the earth produced petroleum, I’d encourage them. If they said they
wanted to be a millionaire, I’d tell them they might want to try to become an
investment banker instead.
“I think that there are people who ﬂat fall in love with the idea of looking
at rocks and ﬁnding oil and gas, and they’re the people who are going to
ﬁnd your oil, and they’re the people you want in the industry.
“I could tell them that I think that there’s going to a demand for oil and
gas well into their lifetime, that it’s always going to pay well for people who
can ﬁnd a scarce resource, that it will be challenging, and that it will be multidisciplinal. But they ought to ﬁgure out whether or not they can think and
envision in three dimensions. Because it is the one thing that is absolutely
necessary—I’m not sure you can do it without that capability.”

RECRUITING IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES
The veteran recruiter doesn’t see a real solution in recruiting candidates
from other countries, citing what he contends are common cultural differences that make for a difﬁcult ﬁt in the U.S. petroleum workforce.
According to Ayling, Americans have an advantage over their non-US
counterparts that go beyond education in that, being more grounded in
their approach to problem-solving and gaining a broader exposure to the
disciplines they’ve studied, they seem to be more capable at solving practical problems in geoscience and petroleum engineering.
“You take a guy from West Texas or West Virginia and you educate him
about oil and gas, and he brings an American ingenuity, a type of work
ethic, and a variety of other things to the job that [professionals from other
cultures] don’t bring. I don’t mean to be jingoistic in saying that, but that’s
part of the problem.
“[Americans are] problem solvers. It seems that that’s one thing that, going
back generations, has been built into the way that we approach life.”
Ayling also sees advantages Americans have in the US industry in terms
of their ability to communicate—not just in terms of their linguistic skills, but
in terms of their innate forthrightness that isn’t shared by other cultures.
“Some societies don’t reward people for being as candid as I am,” he joked.

Difﬁculties in obtaining work visas are another challenge for US oil and gas
companies recruiting from abroad, he added.
While he doesn’t see foreign recruiting as a solution to industry’s stafﬁng
woes, that’s not to say that American oil and gas companies can’t ﬁnd quality technical staff in other countries, Ayling demurred: “You could get bring in
some people from overseas and get them visas and train them to work here,
and they’d be very happy to stay here and work at the high salaries we have
to pay people and probably do a very good job for you—if you pick the right
ones and if you spend enough time training them.”

TRAINING CRITICAL
Industry’s stafﬁng shortage has become so severe, Ayling contends, that it
is creating a corollary problem for the people who are being hired: a lack
of training.
“All of the chief executives are saying, ‘Our No. 1 problem is people, but I
haven’t seen anyone adapting this strategy: That you have to hire enough
extra people so that your people have enough free time that they can train
others. And, instead, what [companies] are doing is that they’re running so
lean that they can’t [have time to train others]. A guy working 60 hours a
week can’t train somebody; in fact, he can’t train himself.”
Ayling recounts a conversation he had about 10 years ago with a chief
geologist for a large independent producer, who complained about his
lack of success in convincing his staff to take training course.
“I said, ‘Well, man, I can explain why: They’re working 60 hours a week.
Who in his right mind is going to take off 2 weeks to go to a training class
and come back and have to work 80 hours a week for the next 6 weeks just
to get caught up?’ You can’t train a bunch of young people when you’re
trying to do that, when there’s more work than you can do already. It takes
away from your efforts to train others, to do it right.
“And you also can’t train them by sitting them down at a computer and
telling them to ﬁnd oil. You’ve got to build in some slack. You’ve got to build
in time for them to go out and sit at a well and watch it get drilled and realize what happens and what sort of information comes out of the ground
and what its ﬂaws are, because [petroleum geology] is still an interpretive
science.
“And I guess petroleum engineering is a tad easier, but it still has some
of the same problems. You can’t take a fresh kid engineer and send him out
to drill a 15,000 ft overpressured or underpressured well and expect him not
to kill somebody. You have to send him out there with somebody who knows
what he’s doing, and that means you’ve got two guys out on the well.”
“So I think we’ve got ourselves a mess, and I don’t know how we’re managing 1,700 rigs [in the US].”
Part of the solution, said Ayling, calls for getting people who have been
out of the industry for the last 5-10 years back into the industry.
“They didn’t forget everything they learned. They could help ﬁll the training gap. Or they could ease the workload of other people to help ﬁll the
training gap, if they have the right kind of personality. It takes a particular
kind of person to be an effective trainer.”

COMPANY LEADERSHIP NEEDED
It all boils down to leadership at US oil and gas companies, Ayling says.
Ayling sees what he terms as a “leadership vacuum” at many of the larger
oil and companies—a condition endemic in the American business world
at large.
“So many of these people have risen to the top not by being leaders.
They’ve risen to the top by being good politicians. There’s a big difference
between a leader and a politician.
“There are an awful lot of people that have done very well in this industry
that I think owe it something—like going out to schools and telling kids what
sort of rewarding career they can have in the oil industry.
“[They should] tell them that if all they want is to do is make $150,000
a year, then that isn’t the way to do it. I’m ﬁrmly convinced that people
shouldn’t work to make money, they should work because they love what
they’re doing.”
In addition, an unhealthy emphasis on short-term proﬁtability makes it
difﬁcult to “convince a team of people sincerely that you have a plan of
action and that you’re going to follow it.”
By way of example, Ayling related an anecdote about a geophysicist
friend at a small privately owned company in Texas that had conducted
extensive seismic work on a salt dome and drilled a well with poor results.
The company reprocessed the seismic data based on the information they
had and drilled a second well with better results. The third well was a company-maker. Ayling’s geophysicist friend told him that if the company had
been partners with a public company or had taken any public money,
“We’d have been out of there after the ﬁrst well.”
Ayling contends that another piece of advice that the petroleum industry’s
leaders should give students is that the old standard of lifetime employment
and career advancement at one company has been discarded.
“Rising in the corporate ranks is a futile effort today,” he said. “It probably
always was, to some extent, but people more and more are realizing that
that’s maybe not what they want to do.
“But there’s still an awful lot of opportunity in the oil and gas industry for
geoscientists and engineers who don’t want to rise in the corporate ranks. [At
the outset], everybody thinks that they’re going to go to work for a Texaco, and
that’s where I’m going to work for the rest of my life, and that almost never
happens. There are more and more people making a living in the industry as
consultants—and a very good living. There are more and more opportunities
for people to work for small companies and to be part of a team that is committed—that isn’t being run by a Harvard MBA who decided to adopt a ‘K-Mart
approach’ to stafﬁng. But that message doesn’t get across very well.” ◊

Aussie study shows
learning-conducive workplaces
key to developing oil sector skills
By Bob Williams, Managing Editor

Developing leading-edge skills in the oil and natural gas industry depends
on the ﬁt between the opportunities for learning by companies and the motivation of workers to pick up on those opportunities.
The key is for oil and gas companies being alert to—and sophisticated
about—creating workplaces that by their very nature are conducive to
learning.
That’s the main lesson learned from a study conducted for Australia’s
National Centre for Vocational Education Research (NCVER).The study report
was written by Jane Figgis, with AAAJ Consulting Group, and Alf Standen of
Training & Assessment Services.

STUDY RATIONALE
The NCVER study was undertaken to explore ways that established workers
develop advanced skills in a technically demanding industry. The driver for
the study was the recognition that it is critical to develop workforces operating at the leading edge of skill and knowledge if Australian enterprises are to
be globally competitive.
At the same time, the study was fashioned to understand whether the practices and policies of the Australian government’s formal vocational education
and training (VET) sector—which in recent years have emphasized entry-level
training—apply equally to advancing the skills of experienced workers.
The oil and gas industry was chosen for study for two reasons, according
to Figgis and Standen: 1) Oil and gas companies take training seriously,
spending many millions of dollars each year on training, but deal with it as a
proprietary matter for competitive reasons; and 2) the Australian petroleum
industry has developed a new interest in connecting with the formal VET sector through its response to new industry-wide training standards.
(Following the 1998 explosion and ﬁre at Esso Australia’s Longford,Vict., gas
plant that killed two workers—which the Royal Commission later blamed on
Esso’s failure to adequately train its employees—Australia’s petroleum sector
developed new incident response and emergency management competencies for its industry competency standard, the Chemical, Hydrocarbons,
and Oil Reﬁning Training Package PMA02.)

For their study, the researchers homed in on the oil and gas production sector, which they likened to a processing operation that has analogs in other
industries. It also is an area where workers’ skills and knowledge are required
to reach a legal standard in line with Australia’s “safety case” regime that’s in
place today.
Figgis and Standen then identiﬁed the key steps along the path to devel-

and provides some insight into
that elusive phenomenon.”
The authors contend that technical difﬁculty is not a signiﬁcant barrier to
learning and that the difference between an operator taking 3 years or 7 to
gain this expertise is due to the employee’s personal inclination—and not the
employee’s failure to learn or the employer’s failure to teach. In short, it is the
individual worker who tends to play the crucial role in determining whether
training is taken up, not the employer.
Figgis and Standen cite these factors as crucial for enabling production
operators to develop advanced skills through work:
• Expectation. Operators are told upon recruitment that there were chosen because they were perceived to have both the aptitude and attitude
to master the required skills.
• Challenge. Operators recognize and appreciate high-quality training.
• Continuity of practice. Operators are imbued with the importance of
asking questions about what they are doing and what they see others
around them doing.
• Targeted training. Formal training is still important in technically difﬁcult
areas.

FINDINGS
The operators and supervisors who work in oil and gas production have two
main responsibilities: ﬁrst, safety; second, meeting production targets.
“The skill of installation operators and managers, then, lies in responding
to upsets, maintaining and ﬁxing equipment, keeping ﬂow within optimum
parameters, and staying vigilant at all times,” the authors wrote.

minimum stafﬁng, one might assume that technical competency would be
the keystone to advancement in the production sector. In fact, the researchers
found that attitude typically trumps technical skills in career advancement
in this sector.
Figgis and Standen developed these observations about the skills transition points from their interviews and research:
• For an entry-level process operator, unlike many other industries, entry
to oil and gas production is basically restricted to experienced workers:
“Recruits to process operations have typically worked elsewhere for at
least 5 or 10 years ...The youngest are in their mid-20s, but often people
enter the industry in their 30s and even 40s. There are real and important
barriers to achieving this entry step.” The authors conclude that entry into
the production sector hinges more on aptitude and attitude than on technical qualiﬁcations. In a paradoxical way, the industry “wants individuals
who are willing to carry out their tasks precisely and yet retain a questioning frame of mind and conﬁdently experiment when problems arise.
Operators need to be team players and capable loners. They must want
to go on learning long after they have mastered routine operations.”
• In the transition from outside process operator to inside panel operator, it takes usually 3-7 years: “The skill and knowledge acquired through
those years of experience constitute a very gradual but nonetheless identiﬁable skill transition point. However, the term ‘point’ is possibly misleading;
in some ways, the process is more like a balloon which slowly inﬂates.” This
process is described by interview respondents as an almost mystical process, getting a gut feel for how the signals on a computer screen relate
speciﬁcally to outside equipment.This underscores the researchers’ ﬁnding
that skill transition points “are more often a gradual integration of insight
and expertise than the acquisition of a speciﬁc, discrete competency.”
Accordingly, it is critical to maintain a work environment that is stimulating
to operators even after they have mastered routines.The lessons that move
a novice process operator into the control room show that informal—but
intentional—learning is mixed with formal training, with both channeled to
a clear goal. This is accomplished through initial formal induction, workplace supervision, on-the-job training, constant reinforcement, mentoring,
and project assignments.
• In the ﬁnal transition, from control room operator to production coordinator/installation manager, this move is seen “as a ‘steep step,’ since broad
managerial skills are required, as well as a signiﬁcantly extended set of
incident response and emergency management competencies.”
One gap the researchers found in process operators’ workplace education is a lack of thorough understanding of the phase properties of a well
stream: “The problem is that isn’t possible to get an intuitive understanding of
this by observing and tinkering—the ﬂuids stay quite invisible, hidden away
in pipes.”
Another concern is the intermittent nature of employment in the oil and
gas industry, which has “serious implications for skill development and, importantly, skill maintenance.” However, just because so much of the learning in
such situations seems opportunistic, that does not mean it isn’t recognized.

Even without agreement on worker competency certiﬁcation, individual
companies do a good job of keeping track of their workers’ capabilities—
increasingly through computerized learning management systems.
Figgis and Standen also found shortcomings in the ways production
supervisors are enabled to develop effective skills for managing people; for
acting as a fair, two-way conduit between the home ofﬁce and ﬁeld workers;
and for managing emergencies.

STUDY IMPLICATIONS
One of two chief implications of the researchers’ study for advancing skills
development in the oil and gas producing sector is the need for underpinning
knowledge with technical instruction—for example, a thorough understanding
of chemical and physical processes that the ﬂuid mixtures are undergoing as
they move via production tubing, ﬂowlines, and installation piping.
A downside of reliance on experiential learning, this shortfall needs to
be addressed by instilling the relevant scientiﬁc and technical knowledge
through “astute instructional design and delivery.”
The other major implication for the oil and gas production industry is the
need for cooperation among oil and gas companies in the development of
leading-edge skills.

PMA02 has established a uniform set of competencies that the industry helped
design and supports. Also, the establishment of Australia’s safety case regime
commits oil and gas companies to regular, detailed evaluations of safety and
emergency management competence. And the growing shortage of skilled
operators and controllers is spurring an industry-wide approach to establishing
an industry-wide apprenticeship program for process operators.

CONCLUSIONS
Figgis and Standen offer a number of key conclusions from their study,
among them:
• “A lack of engagement with the [formal VET] sector is something the oil
and gas producing sector might reﬂect on.
• “Workers’ attitudes are key in developing a high-performance/high-skill
workforce. Commitment to safety, a willingness to question and learn are
attitudes required to be recruited to the oil and gas industry. They are nonnegotiable. VET providers working with candidates at entry level need to
understand that developing appropriate attitudes in students is as important as their acquiring specialist skill and knowledge.
• “Skilled workers are different from entry-level learners in that, on the whole,
they are far more conﬁdent learners and, in this industry, thrive on challenge. In a workplace that affords them the opportunities, they effectively
take charge of their own learning program; they act like the autonomous
professionals they are. This is a reminder that VET produces professional
workers in the true sense of the word.
• “Advanced skill learners reported requiring training with ‘bite’... This
requires thoughtful instruction design where the trainer perceptively
judges the degree of challenge (‘bite’) in light of each worker’s capacity
to meet the challenge.
• “Enterprises ought to conceptualize the workplace as a learning environment, as well as the site where products/services are created. Learning
environments are characterized by the tasks people are given, the
resources at their disposal to complete the tasks, and the support offered.
Experience suggests that it is of real beneﬁt for employers to envisage their
workplaces in terms of this trio of learning ‘affordances’ and observe the
quality of the learning that emerges.”
Figgis and Standen point to recent Norwegian research that produced
a chart of learning-conducive conditions of work, which is reproduced in
the accompanying table. The researchers contend that this list needs further
reﬁnement.
“For example,” they wrote, “it implies that the employer does all of the
‘affording’ of learning, but this study demonstrates the ways many employees
design learning situations for themselves—so ‘autonomy’ may be another
conducive condition for learning.
“Likewise, ‘trust’ is not mentioned, but operators asking tough questions is
central to workplace learning and critically depends on trust.” ◊

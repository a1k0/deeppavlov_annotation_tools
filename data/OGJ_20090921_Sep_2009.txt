Hughes Christensen EZCase Bit
By any measure — safety, schedule, or ultimate cost — there’s no substitute for the only
steel casing bit system in the industry: EZCase from Hughes Christensen. Casing-while-drilling
accomplishes two objectives in a single run, saving days of drilling time and associated costs.
With its exclusive steel crown and full PDC cutting structure, EZCase does both jobs without
compromising on performance. Any formation, any application — there’s no better choice than

COVER
After several years of dwindling to fewer than 150 companies
and known as the OGJ200, our exclusive report has a new name:
OGJ150. Despite high prices for oil and gas in 2008, many companies in the annual ranking of the US-based, publicly traded oil
and gas producers posted negative net income.The group as a whole
posted a 32% loss compared with a year ago.This special report,
along with the annual results of the OGJ100 group of oil and gas
producers based outside the US, begins on p. 22.

General

Interest

Gorgon LNG partners given final approval
The giant Gorgon-Jansz-Io LNG and domestic gas project off
Western Australia has been given a final investment green light by
the joint venture partners Chevron Corp., ExxonMobil Corp., and
Royal Dutch Shell PLC.
In 2009 dollars, the cost of the development is $43 billion
(Aus.).
With a total gas resource estimate of 40 tcf, the project will be
the largest for resources development in Australia’s history.
Preparatory work on the proposed Barrow Island LNG and domestic plant site will begin immediately with full construction
timed to begin in February 2010.
Contracts valued at $2 billion (Aus.) have already been let and
a further $10 billion (Aus.) worth of contracts will be awarded
before yearend.
First LNG deliveries are expected to start in 2014. Domestic gas
is slated to come on stream by yearend 2015.
The project comprises two subsea pipelines, one each from
subsea wells on the Gorgon and the Jansz-Io fields. The gas will
be piped to Barrow Island where three 5 million tonne/year LNG
trains will be constructed along with a 300 terajoules/day domestic gas plant. Domestic sales gas will be piped to the mainland to
connect with the main Dampier to Bunbury gas trunkline. LNG
will be shipped direct to customers overseas from a loading jetty
to be built on Barrow.
Carbon dioxide extracted from the project—mostly from Gorgon field—will be geosequestered by injection directly into storage reservoirs 2,000 m beneath the island.
The estimated economic life of the project is presently put at
40 years.

Exploration

&

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Gorgon field was first discovered by West Australian Petroleum in 1981 while nearby Jansz and Io were found in the 1990s
by ExxonMobil and BP PLC, respectively.
Chevron has signed sales agreements with Osaka Gas, Tokyo
Gas, and GS Caltex (of South Korea) for a total of more than 4 million tonnes/year of LNG. ExxonMobil has sales agreements with
Petronet of India and PetroChina for its share of LNG production.
Shell has yet to confirm its supply deals.
Chevron has 50% of the project (47.75% once equity sales are
approved to Osaka Gas and Tokyo Gas). ExxonMobil and Shell each
have 25%.

BP sees US biofuels consumption climbing
BP PLC expects biofuels will become a larger part of the US
motor fuel market, probably displacing more gasoline than diesel,
said Katrina Landis, chief executive officer of BP Alternative Energy, at the Offshore Europe Conference.
“Diesel use is growing in the US, following the trend set by
Europe, and biodiesel is expected to provide around 8% of the fuel
for diesel-powered engines by 2030,” Landis said.
During that same period, biofuels are expected to take the
place of about 25% of the gasoline market, she said. “US production of biofuels is expected to grow from less than 0.5 million b/d
in 2007 to 2.3 million b/d in 2030,” she added.
BP has a joint venture with Martek Biosciences Corp. to produce ethanol from sugarcane, and BP is working with DuPont
Corp. to produce biobutanol at Saltend, Hull, UK.
In the US, BP has a joint venture with Verenium Corp., Cambridge, Mass., to develop a commercial-scale cellulosic ethanol
plant in Highlands County, Fla. Plans call for the plant to produce
36 million gal/year by 2012. ✦

Development

Libya to invest $10 billion in development
Libya plans to invest 12.1 billion dinars ($9.92 billion) in the
development of 24 wells in fields it calls “technically, financially,
and economically proven.”
The investment will be undertaken by Libya’s state-owned
National Oil Corp (NOC), its subsidiaries, and current foreign
partners, according to an official statement issued after a cabinet
meeting.
“No new parties would be allowed to participate in that plan,”
said the statement, according to the government news agency
Jana.
The government’s plan calls for boosting production from the
Waha-Jalou oil field by 100,000 b/d at a cost of 1.6 billion dinars

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

and increasing output at the Nafoora-Oujlaa-Khleej oil field by
130,000 b/d at a cost of 1.3 billion dinars. No other details were
released.
Analyst BMI said Tripoli’s move to prioritize contract awards to
existing players in the Libyan upstream “may present opportunities” to Italy’s Eni SPA, France’s Total SA, Spain’s Repsol YPF SA,
and Austria’s OMV AG.
However, the analyst expects “BP and Royal Dutch Shell to
avoid making any high-profile new investment deals with Libya in
the immediate term” in order to disassociate themselves and the
British government from suggestions that oil industry concerns
in Libya may have motivated the release of convicted Lockerbie
bomber Abdel Baset al-Megrahi on Aug 20.

Last week, US Sen. Charles E. Schumer called on the British
government not to bid on or agree to any oil contract with Libya
after speculation that Megrahi’s release was due to a secret deal
between the British and Libyan governments.
“If the British government wants to dispel these disturbing rumors once and for all, agreeing to Libyan oil contracts is not the
way to do it,” Schumer said. “The Libyans have clearly shown
their disdain for the international community by holding a welcome home ceremony for this terrorist, but it’s up to the British to
show the world that they reject the Libyans’ foul actions.”
BP nonetheless plans to drill its first Libyan well in the second
half of 2010 as part of a $900 million exploration program, according to company spokesman, David Nicholas.
BP signed an accord with NOC in May 2007 during a visit by
then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair. The agreement allows
BP to explore 21,000 sq miles and in 2007 the company said it
planned to drill at least 17 exploration wells.

West of Shetland gas find under appraisal
A group led by DONG Energy AS is considering whether to
drill a sidetrack to appraise a gas discovery on the Glenlivet license
west of the Shetland Islands off the UK.
The well in the P1195 license encountered the prognosed gas pay
in Paleocene sandstone. Cores, logs, and sampling revealed 61 m of
net gas pay with excellent reservoir and saturation parameters.
The Transocean Rather deepwater semisubmersible is drilling
the well near the Laggan and Tormore gas discoveries, in which
DONG Energy holds 20% interest, in the Faroe-Shetland Channel
(see map, OGJ, Aug. 20, 2007, p. 38).
DONG Energy operates P1195 with 80% interest. Faroe Petroleum PLC and First Oil Expro Ltd. have 10% each.
DONG Energy was awarded interests in 21 exploration blocks
covering 3,600 sq km in the region around the West of Shetlands
in November 2008. DONG Energy operates four of the blocks.

Pan Orient to buy Indonesian interests from Fuel-X
Pan Orient Energy Corp., Calgary, agreed to buy Indonesian
interests held by Fuel-X International Inc. of Alberta, which was
placed in receivership in September 2007.
The main interest is a 30% nonoperated interest in the 2,285
sq km Tungkal production-sharing contract in South Sumatra. The
other interest is a $5 million receivable payable upon first commercial gas delivery from Ruby gas field in the Sebuku PSC off
East Kalimantan (OGJ Online, May 2, 2007). Development was
approved in mid-2008.
The purchase price, $7.5 million (Can.) in Pan Orient stock,
will be adjusted for revenue, expenses, and capital outlays related
to the 30% participating interest in the Tungkal PSC from Aug. 31
to the closing date, and these adjustments will be paid largely in
cash.

Kulczyk Oil Ventures Inc., Calgary, formerly Loon Energy Inc.,
offered to buy private Sydney firm Triton Hydrocarbons Pty. Ltd.,
which has a 36% interest in 744,000-acre Block M that contains
undeveloped Belait oil and gas field.
Shareholders of more than 75% of Triton stock accepted the
offer. Closing is expected in mid-September.
Tap Oil Ltd., Perth, operates Block M, which is just south of
550,000-acre Block L, in which Kulczyk Oil holds 40% interest
(OGJ Online, Sept. 1, 2009).
Tap Oil shot 118 sq km of 3D seismic and 60 line-km of 2D
seismic on Block M in the second and third quarters of 2009. It
plans to drill two wells in 2010 and a third well by August 2011.
Kulczyk Oil noted that four prospects on Block M were categorized as prospective resources because of the lack of discovery
wells and production tests.
Once Kulczyk Oil acquires Triton, Brunei National Petroleum
Co. Sdn. Bhd. has the right to acquire Kulczyk Oil’s interest in
Block M.
Nations Southeast Asia Ltd., Calgary, operator of Block L, shot
350 sq km of 3D seismic in the southwest part of the block earlier
this year near adjacent Seria oil field, which had produced more
than 1 billion bbl of oil by 1991.
Nations plans to drill two exploration wells starting in the first
quarter of 2010 on Block L, where the last well, Jerudong-11, was
drilled in 1986, Kulczyk Oil said.
Brunei Shell Petroleum Co. announced a large dry, sweet gas
discovery in three formations just offshore at Bubut, less than 1
km from the Block L boundary (OGJ Online, Nov. 15, 2007).
Kulczyk Oil noted that Triton also owns 35% of Mauritania
International Petroleum Inc., which holds 100% interest in four
contiguous exploration blocks off Mauritania.
Triton also owns 50% of Triton Petroleum Pte. Ltd., or Triton
Singapore, which owns a 20% beneficial interest in a productionsharing agreement that covers Syria’s Block 9, where Kulczyk Oil
plans to shoot a large 3D seismic survey by June 2010. Triton Singapore will be led by the current management of Triton, who are
pursuing development opportunities in southern Iraq. ✦

The Tungkal PSC has several discoveries, including Mengoepeah South in 2007, the discovery well encountering 70 m of net
oil pay and testing at a combined rate of more than 2,000 b/d of
oil above 1,200 m true vertical depth. Gross production is 800
b/d, of which 240 b/d is net to the Fuel-X interest.
Indonesia approved a revised Mengoepeah development plan
in April that includes up to 10 development wells and the workover of existing wells. Development drilling is under way and
anticipated to be completed by yearend with a target of gross
production of 2,000-3,000 b/d, or 600-900 b/d net to the Fuel-X
interest.
One high impact exploration well is to spud in the fourth quarter
and be completed by yearend. Tungkal is next to the Pan Orient-operated Batu Gajah PSC, where seismic is being shot and a multiwell
exploration drilling program is to start in the first half of 2010.

Volund field off Norway starts producing

Talisman farms into Papua New Guinea permits

Marathon Petroleum Co. (Norway) LLC started production
from Volund field on Block 24/9 in the Norwegian North Sea.
The field consists of three subsea-completed wells tied back 8
km to the Alvheim floating, production, storage, and offloading
vessel. Water depth at Volund is 120-130 m.
Volund is the second tieback to the Marathon-operated FPSO.
The StatoilHydro-operated Vilje field began producing to the FPSO
from two subsea-completed wells in August 2008 (OGJ, Aug. 11,
2008, Newsletter).
Marathon says current oil production to the Alvheim FPSO is
about 140,000 bo/d, or about 20,000 b/d more than the nameplate capacity. The first Volund well, therefore, will function as a
swing producer until a natural decline starts in the Alvheim fields,
likely by the middle of 2010, the company says.
Marathon expects Volund to reach a peak oil production of
about 25,000 b/d, the timing of which is subject to available processing capacity on the FPSO.
Operator Marathon holds a 65% interest in Volund, while its
partner, Lundin Norway AS, holds the remaining 35%
Production from Alvheim started in June 2008 (OGJ, June 16,
2008, Newsletter). Operator Marathon holds a 65% interest in the
Alvheim field and the FPSO. Partners in Alvheim are ConocoPhillips Skandinavia AS 20% and Lundin Norway AS 15%.
Interest owners in Vilje are operator Statoil 28.85%, Marathon
46.9%, and Total E&P Norge AS 24.24%.

Talisman Energy Inc., Calgary, signed a $60 million deal with
Horizon Oil Ltd., Sydney, to farm into Horizon’s gas and condensate interests in the western province of Papua New Guinea.
Talisman will acquire 50% interest in retention lease PRL 4 that
contains the Stanley gas-condensate discovery and a 50% interest
in PRL 5 that contains the Elevala and Ketu gas discoveries.
Talisman paid $30 million in cash and an additional $8 million
to be drawn down at any time and applied to Horizon’s share of
capital expenditure on the permits. The remaining $22 million
will be drawn down after Papua New Guinea approves the working interest transfers.
Talisman’s entry comes immediately after Horizon’s recent announcement that it terminated its earlier $55 million deal with P3
Global Energy after P3 failed to make the required payments.
Horizon’s short to medium-term plan for development of its
Papua New Guinea assets involves production of 140 MMcfd of gas
from two wells, and extraction from that gas of an initial 4,000
b/d of condensate, and potentially 40 tonnes/day of LPG before
reinjecting the dry gas until a gas market develops in the region.
Horizon says the Stanley gas resource likely would be used
for electric power generation to supply local domestic and industrial customers while the larger Elevala and Ketu gas resource
would rely on export by pipeline or as a liquid via a small LNG
facility.
The deal also adds to Talisman’s recently acquired assets in
western Papua New Guinea via its takeover of British company
Rift Oil PLC earlier this year. Rift holds two permits, one of which
contains the Puk Puk and Douglas gas discoveries. ✦

Processing
Pemex refineries due low-sulfur fuel units
Pemex Refining let engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contracts worth $638 million to ICA Fluor for lowsulfur gasoline projects at two refineries in Mexico.
In addition to the EPC work, ICA Fluor will test and start up catalytic gasoline desulfurization plants, amine regeneration units,
offsites, and utilities at the 275,000-b/cd refinery in Cadereyta,
Nuevo Leon, and the 185,000-b/cd refinery in Ciudad Madero,
Tamaulipas.
The Cadereyta project involves a 42,500-b/d catalytic distillation train. The Madero project involves two 20,000-b/d catalytic
distillation plants.
ICA Fluor is a joint venture of Empresas ICA SAB de CV and
Fluor Corp. Pemex Refining is a subsidiary of state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos.

Irving Oil to upgrade St. John refinery
Irving Oil will spend $220 million to upgrade its 250,000-b/d
refinery at St. John, NB.
The privately held company said it will spend $170 million to
upgrade the resid FCCU and a gasoline desulfurization unit.
When installed in 1998 with capacity of 70,000 b/d, the resid
FCCU was the largest such unit in the world.
The refinery has another FCCU fed by vacuum gas oil. Total

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
FCC capacity is 95,000 b/d (OGJ, Dec. 22, 2008, p. 48).
The refinery also has 35,000 b/d of catalytic reforming, 34,000
b/d of hydrocracking, and 92,000 b/d of hydrotreating capacity.
In addition to the FCCU and gasoline desulfurization work, the
60-day project will include general maintenance on other processing units to reduce flaring and fugitive emissions.

Agreement supports more Marcellus processing
A natural gas processing agreement announced Sept. 15 will
underpin a new 120-MMcfd gas plant in the Marcellus shale gas
play.
MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources LLC, a partnership
between MarkWest Energy Partners LP and the Midstream & Resources Funds, announced it had reached agreement with Chesapeake Appalachia LLC, a subsidiary of Chesapeake Energy Corp.,
and Statoil Natural Gas LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of StatoilHydro, to process gas at MarkWest Liberty’s new Majorsville
processing plant in the panhandle of West Virginia.
This agreement is in addition to one MarkWest Liberty executed earlier this year with Range Resources to process gas at
the Majorsville plant. All agreements include “significant acreage
dedications and other commitments,” according to MarkWest’s
announcement. The Majorsville plant is to be completed in mid2010.

With its infrastructure in Marshall and Wetzel counties in West
Virginia, NiSource Gas Transmission & Storage’s affiliate Columbia Gas Transmission will gather the rich gas produced by Chesapeake and Statoil. Per arrangements by MarkWest and Columbia
announced in August 2008 (OGJ Online, Oct. 24, 2008), Columbia will deliver the gas to MarkWest’s Majorsville processing plant,
which is planned to be adjacent Columbia`s existing Majorsville
compressor station.

NGLs produced at the Majorsville plant will move via pipeline to MarkWest’s Houston, Pa., processing complex (OGJ Online,
Apr. 9, 2009). MarkWest Liberty plans a 37,000-b/d fractionation
plant at the Houston complex, as well as transportation, storage,
and marketing infrastructure, to sell the NGLs into markets in the
US Northeast.
The company currently operates a 22,000-b/d fractionation,
storage, and marketing facility near Portsmouth, Ohio. ✦

Regency expands Haynesville takeaway capacity
Regency Energy Partners LP, Alinda Capital Partners LLC, and GE
Energy Financial Services announced plans to construct a $47 million pipeline extension of the Haynesville Expansion Project (HEP)
in North Louisiana to increase capacity on the Regency Intrastate
Gas System (RIGS). The extension, called the Red River Lateral, will
add 100,000 MMbtu/day of capacity to the current project, bringing
the total capacity to about 1.2 bcfd. Regency described the Red River
Lateral as the first of several opportunities to extend the HEP.
The lateral will add 12.5 miles of 36-in. pipe to the HEP, reaching
further southwest to the west side of the Red River into Red River
Parish, La. All the incremental capacity on the Red River Lateral has
been contracted and 75,000 MMbtu/day of additional capacity on
the Haynesville Expansion has been contracted as well. The expansion’s 1.2 bcfd of capacity is fully subscribed with the exception of
incremental space held back for operational flexibility.
Construction of the expansion project—including the Red
River Lateral—is on schedule to meet a planned in-service date
of Dec. 31, according to Regency. The 46 miles of 36-in. pipeline
used is now being commissioned. Construction continues on 75
miles of 42-in. pipeline. Regency plans to begin construction of
the Red River Lateral later this month.
The lateral will be funded by each of the partners of the RIGS
joint venture in accordance with their ownership percentages. Regency has a 43% general partnership interest in the joint venture,
while Alinda, and an affiliate of GE Energy Financial Services,
have a 50% and a 7% general partnership interest, respectively.
The companies formed the joint venture late first-quarter (OGJ
Online, Apr. 1, 2009).
The expansions are underwritten by firm transportation agreements with 10-year terms, and roughly 85% of projected revenues
will come from reservation fees.

China, Japan committed to PNG LNG project
Papua New Guinea’s Public Enterprises Minister Arthur Somare
completed a “positively satisfying and successful” visit to Japan
and China in connection with the PNG LNG project.
“Asian governments contracting for long-term purchases of
[LNG] wanted assurance that the PNG LNG project has the support
of the PNG government,” Somare told local media on his return.
“The Chinese and Japanese governments believe that the
strong commitment of the PNG government is necessary to ensure
smooth progress of the PNG LNG project,” Somare said, adding
that they are concerned about the role these imports would play
in their respective economies over the next 30 years.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

“We have been able to satisfy both governments on this score
and to hold highly satisfactory meetings with prospective LNG
customers that are in advanced sales negotiations with the project
operator, ExxonMobil,” Somare said.
Somare travelled to Japan and China as a special envoy of Prime
Minister Michael Somare, accompanied by four members of Parliament
Anthony Nene, Martin Aini, Jimmy Miringtoro, and Francis Potape.
In Beijing, the delegation held talks with Zhang Ping, who
heads China’s National Development Reform Commission, the
supreme government body that sanctions all international business transactions conducted by China’s state-owned corporations,
including Sinopec.

Enterprise enters Eagle Ford shale agreement
Enterprise Products Partners LP entered into a long-term agreement to provide natural gas transportation and processing services
on dedicated acreage owned by one of the largest and most active
producers developing the Eagle Ford shale. The agreement covers
more than 150,000 acres in the play.
Enterprise declined to name the producer but has publicly identified Anadarko Petroleum Corp., Petrohawk Energy Corp., ConocoPhillips, and Apache Corp., among others, as potential partners for its
midstream services. Anadarko holds 350,000 acres in the Eagle Ford
shale. Petrohawk’s holdings in the play reached 210,000 acres in August. ConocoPhillips holds 300,000 acres, and Apache 400,000.
Stretching from the Mexico border along the Gulf Coast to near
Louisiana, the Eagle Ford shale covers more than 10 million acres
in Texas and lies beneath or near Enterprise’s assets in the region.
Enterprise said the proximity would require it make only modest capital expenditures to begin providing the transportation and
processing services required under the agreement.
The bulk of the modifications to Enterprise’s existing system
would consist of filling gaps in its current gas gathering system,
the company said. Enterprise would not comment regarding either the expected pipeline mileage required or the timeframe over
which the work would be completed.
Enterprise completed expansion of two of its seven South Texas
processing plants during first-quarter, increasing its processing
capacity in the region to more than 1.5 bcfd, and said these expansions will largely address any capacity needs brought about
by the new agreement. Enterprise increased capacity at the Shilling plant in Webb County, Tex., to 110 MMcfd from 60 MMcfd
and expanded capacity at its Thompsonville natural gas processing
plant in Jim Hogg County, Tex. to 330 MMcfd from 300 MMcfd

Doing-nothing fantasies
Among the myriad falsehoods that attach
themselves to oil and gas in politics, one of the
most persistent is also one that should be easy to
see through. It’s the idea that doing nothing makes
money. And it’s once again steering energy legislation toward costly senselessness.
Like most fantasies, this one has a tentative
link with reality. At times, the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries does make money
doing nothing—or at least doing less than everything possible. It sometimes elevates crude prices
by not producing oil above certain rates. Success,
though, is intermittent. Historically, price management has been difficult to implement and even
harder to sustain.
Still, many people think OPEC consistently makes
money by not producing crude. From there, analogy
runs wild, and critical thought hides its head.

Loitering tankers
News stories after the Iranian Revolution of
1979, for example, gushed about tankers anchored
off New York City, waiting for the price of crude
to rise before discharging cargos. Prices were
indeed rising because of the disruption to oil supply. So a reporter took a helicopter ride away from
land and, sure enough, there they were: full tankers going nowhere. What else could they be up to
except deliberately doing nothing (not selling oil)
in order to make money (by profiting on future
price increases)?
The question had less sinister answers, of course.
The tankers were waiting on harbor pilots or
berthing space in New York Harbor or responding
to any of many other routine reasons for tankers
not to steam into port from open sea without stopping. While they were at anchor, carrying costs and
various daily fees mounted on cargos and ships,
giving owners strong incentive to dock and unload
promptly, whatever the price of crude.
But routine explanations make dull news. So
a myth was born: In the oil industry, it’s possible
to make money at the expense of others by doing
nothing. Persistence of the myth became evident
last year, when news stories preposterously accused companies of closing refineries to limit oil
supply and raise gasoline prices. Refineries that do
20

nothing don’t make money and never will.
With oil and gas, however, ungoverned suspicion suspends disbelief. Politicians thus have
managed to persuade themselves and others
recently that oil and gas operators need the federal
government to prod them into action on leases
on the Outer Continental Shelf. After discovering
that drilling has not occurred on a large number
of OCS leases, lawmakers concluded that companies delay the work to hold oil off the market and
await, if not aggravate, price increases.
Like tankers at anchor near a port, leases with
no drilling under way have routine explanations
for the inactivity. Operators must secure permits
before they can work on OCS acreage, which takes
time. Environmental and other challenges create
delays. Seismic and other surveys usually precede
drilling. Operators often must wait on rigs. And
they assemble leaseholdings according to their
best guesses about how plays might develop, never
planning to drill well on every lease or to make
holes in the seabottom as fast as mechanics and
logistics allow.
These are sound, routine reasons for a large
number of OCS leases to be undrilled at any given
time. And operators have incentive to keep that
number as low as they can. They have bonus
money tied up in leases and pay rentals until production starts. While they have good reasons to
do nothing at certain times on certain leases, they
surely don’t make money that way.

Enforced diligence
Yet last week the House Committee on Natural Resources held hearings on legislation that
would require the interior secretary to define and
enforce “diligent development” of OCS leases. The
measure would impose government judgment on
decisions that rightly belong to companies risking
money on leases.
Inevitably, the distortion to investment planning would discourage leasing and slow OCS
development—in rich conflict with the bill’s
aims. And at the bottom of this pile of energypolicy rubble would lie the assumption, forever
discredited yet apparently immortal, that doing
nothing somehow makes money. ✦

now contains only 141 companies. A
year ago, there were 147 firms in the
compilation.
Totaling $72 billion, the combined
2008 earnings of the firms in the group
fell 32% from a year earlier, although
revenues climbed 23% over the period.
The group’s oil production volumes
moved lower from 2007, but gas production volumes were up.
To qualify for the OGJ150, oil and
gas producers must have their headquarters in the US, be publicly traded,
and hold oil or gas reserves in the US.
The total yearend 2008 assets of
the 141 firms in the group were
$1.077 trillion, and the companies’
combined stockholders’ equity was

During 2008, the OGJ150 group’s
capital and exploratory expenditures
totaled $162.8 billion, up from $123.7

Bayou City Exploration Inc. sold its US

price of crude oil was $94.04/bbl, up
from $66.52/bbl a year earlier. The US
Energy Information Administration
estimates that the US wellhead price of
gas last year climbed 27% on the previous year to average $8.07/Mcf.
Lower crack spreads and refining
volumes in the US hit the downstream
earnings of the integrated firms. US
refinery utilization averaged 85.3% last
year vs. 88.5% in 2007, according to
EIA, whose figures show that capacity
utilization has declined each year since
it averaged 93% in 2004.
No. 5-ranked Marathon Oil Corp.
reported that its refining, marketing,
and transportation segment income for

2008 was down 43% from a year earlier
to $1.179 billion on lower refining and
wholesale marketing gross margins,
and its manufacturing expenses were
relatively higher in 2008 due primarily
to higher energy costs and maintenance
related activities.
The US Gulf Coast cash refining
margin last year averaged $9/bbl, down
from the 2007 average of $12.60/bbl,
according to Muse, Stancil & Co. Meanwhile, the composite refiners’ acquisition cost of crude in the US averaged
$94.73/bbl last year, up from $67.94/
bbl a year earlier.

entire OGJ150 group.
Also, with net income totaling
$76.32 billion, the 2008 earnings of the
top 20 firms exceeded the earnings of
the entire group by $4 billion.
Only one company in the top 20
was not among these leaders last year.
Questar Corp. is now ranked No. 19,
up from No. 22. Based in Salt Lake City,
Questar had yearend 2008 assets of
$8.63 billion and $3.4 billion in stockholders’ equity.

20 firms at the end of 2008 dropped
sharply from a year earlier. As of Dec.

Earnings leaders
The OGJ150 also ranks the companies by their earnings. And the list of
the top 20 earners during 2008 varies somewhat from the top 20 firms
ranked by assets.
ExxonMobil leads both lists as
ranked by assets and by 2008 earnings,
posting net income of $45.22 billion

Financial results
As they did the US-based producers,
high operating costs affected the 2008
financial results of the OGJ100 companies.
Although Shell reported 29% higher
revenues, higher costs and taxes resulted in a 15% decline in the company’s
2008 earnings.
In terms of total assets at yearend
2008, EnCana Corp. is the largest
Canadian operator. The Calgary-based
company, which plans to split into two
companies by the end of this year, reported assets of $47.2 billion and a 50%
jump to $5.9 billion in earnings from
a year earlier. The earnings gain was
primarily due to an after-tax unrealized
mark-to-market hedging gain.
Collectively, the Canadian companies
in the group posted a 38% increase in
2008 earnings from a year earlier. The
group’s combined capital and exploration spending climbed 26% to $50.2
billion.
The group of firms based in Europe
reported a combined 34% surge in
2008 capital spending, led by StatoilHydro, BP, and Shell. Capital spending
by the Asian producers jumped, also,
led by PetroChina Co. Ltd. ✦

Administration attempts to justify tax proposals surprise API’s Gerard
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
American Petroleum Institute Pres.
Jack N. Gerard expressed surprise
at an Obama administration ofﬁcial’s
apparent attempt on Sept. 10 to justify
proposals to repeal oil and gas tax
incentives by saying that it is looking at
other industries’ tax breaks too.
“It seems that they got the cart
before the horse. If they want to look at
the tax code generally, we’re satisﬁed
with that. But they obviously didn’t
analyze the entire tax code before they
suggested repealing our industry’s tax
provisions,” Gerard told reporters during a Sept. 15 teleconference.
Alan B. Krueger, assistant US Treasury secretary for economic policy,
mentioned that the administration was
looking at other industries’ tax breaks
during a Sept. 10 hearing by the Senate
Finance Committee’s Energy, Natural
Resources, and Infrastructure Subcommittee on the White House’s Fiscal 2010
oil and gas tax proposals.
When a subcommittee member,
Jim Bunning (R-Ky.), asked him if the
administration was currently singling
out the oil and gas industry as it seeks
tax incentive repeals, however, the
US Department of the Treasury ofﬁcial
replied, “That is correct.”
Gerard said he continues to be
amazed by Obama administration
statements that oil and gas tax incentives should be repealed to prevent
overproduction of domestic resources.
“The Treasury Department’s Green
Book says there’s too much oil and gas
production in the United States. We
think that’s laughable. We think there
needs to be some serious dialogue

more than a negligible increase in consumer prices, would decrease domestic
production, and would adversely affect
local economies and cost jobs, he suggested.

about what these proposals mean and
about ways to get back to producing
more oil and gas,” he said.

‘Ludicrous’
Citing a PricewaterhouseCoopers
study commissioned by API that it
released on Sept. 9, Gerard said the US
oil and gas industry supports 9 million
jobs and contributed more than $1 trillion, or 7.5%, to the US gross domestic
product in 2007. “For the administration to focus [tax incentive repeals] on
an industry that is such an economic
engine seems ludicrous during a recession,” he maintained.
“We’re deeply troubled by what
the administration has put forward
for a variety of reasons, not the least
of which is its apparent belief that
there’s overproduction of oil and gas
in the United States. At a time when
it’s almost universally accepted on the
Hill that there’s a need for more energy
security, we hope cooler heads will
prevail and these proposals will be
rejected,” he continued.
He said that API has made progress
in the past 2 months in getting US
House Natural Resources Committee
Chairman Nick J. Rahall (D-W.Va.) to
modify some of his proposals to reform
federal minerals management. But the
oil and gas trade association remains
concerned with the bill that Rahall
introduced on Sept. 8, and that will be
the subject of committee hearings on
Sept. 16-17, according to Gerard.
“The legislation that’s being put
forward actually will result in less
domestic energy,” he explained. “In a
preliminary analysis, outside sources

Nichols noted that they would: “We
believe these proposals are antijobs, anticonsumer, and antienergy. They will
depress investment in new domestic oil
and gas projects, weaken the nation’s

say it could result in 18% less natural
gas production over the next 30 years.
Likewise, it could result in a $37 billion
loss to our economy and a $4.7 billion
loss in government revenue.”

Other concerns
Rahall’s bill also would hamper domestic production growth by increasing bureaucracy, and eliminate the
federal royalty-in-kind program, which
Gerard conceded has been badly managed but which remains a good idea.
He said that in public forums in
19 states during August in which API
participated, citizens showed a surprisingly high interest in energy issues. “In
Farmington, NM, which is a relatively
small community, it was estimated that
1,000 people came to talk about oil
and gas. Places like Detroit, where you
wouldn’t expect many people to show
up, attracted hundreds. A surprising
number of people came from the farming community,” he said.
“Clearly, health care was Issue No.
1 over the August break. Energy was
Issue No. 1-A,” he added.
Most of the concerns expressed
at these forums centered on efforts
to control greenhouse gas emissions
through a carbon cap-and-trade program, Gerard said.
“I’ve had a number of conversations
with members of Congress and believe
that if the Waxman-Markey bill went to
the House ﬂoor today, it wouldn’t pass.
When you look at the Senate dynamic,
with a lot of different people from both
parties, you see several Democrats
concerned about job loss and fuel loss,”
he said. “I think the public is speaking
up, and it’s having a clear impact on
public ofﬁcials.”

testimony. “In addition, the proposals jeopardize the jobs of millions of
industry workers across the country in

a time when so many Americans are
unemployed and economic recovery
remains uncertain.”
In written testimony, Kleemeier said,
“The Obama administration’s budget
request would strip essential capital
from new American natural gas and oil
investment by radically raising taxes
on American production. American gas
and oil production would be reduced.
It runs counter to the administration’s
clean energy and energy security objectives.”

“We believe these proposals
are antijobs, anticonsumer, and
antienergy. They will depress
investment in new domestic oil
and gas projects, weaken the nation’s energy security, and slow
the economic recovery.”
—J. Larry Nichols, American
Petroleum Institute chairman

‘More, not less’
Kleemeier told OGJ that he remains
astonished at Obama administration
statements that developing and producing less domestic oil and gas is in the
nation’s best interest. So, apparently,
does Nichols. “I have never heard anyone, before the Treasury Department
produced its Green Book, say that the
United States produces too much oil
and gas. Every president since Richard
Nixon and before Barack Obama said
we need to produce more, not less,” he
told the subcommittee.
But Krueger said the administration
believes it is no longer enough to address US energy needs simply by finding more fossil fuels, and that dramatic
steps toward becoming a clean energy
economy must be taken. “The tax subsidies that are currently provided to the
oil and gas industry lead to inefficiency
by encouraging an overinvestment of
domestic resources in this industry….
[The tax subsidies also] result in distortions within the industry by favoring
investment in nonintegrated firms,” he
said in his written testimony.
“Tax provisions that encourage
investment in a specific industry may
be justified in cases where they address
a positive externality associated with
either production or consumption of
certain goods. Private market decisions
can be inefficient when market prices
do not reflect the full social costs,” the
Treasury official continued.
Oil and gas prices, for example, do
not reflect environmental harm caused
by the release into the atmosphere

of greenhouse gases associated with
production, Krueger maintained. The
price of oil also does not reflect risks
associated with US dependency or the
costs of traffic congestion, he said. “Tax
provisions can address this problem by
incorporating the social costs into the
price of the resources,” he said.
Removing federal tax preferences
would have little adverse impact on oil
and gas prices, production, and employment, Krueger said. “The relatively
small share US share of global [oil]
production means that any change in
domestic production will have a limited
impact on the world supply,…[which
the Treasury Department estimates]
would fall by less than one-tenth of one
percent due to the elimination of these
tax subsidies,” he said.

Price impacts
Even if additional costs to domestic
oil companies were fully passed on
to consumers through higher gasoline prices, “which is highly unlikely
because prices are set on the world
market, the cost would be equivalent
to less than 1¢/gal,” Krueger indicated.
He conceded that a change in domestic
producer costs could cause production to move from US independents
to domestic and foreign integrated oil
companies, but added that total oil
finding and lifting costs would rise by
less than 2%.
“Of course, the increase in costs
would not translate into a one-for-

one decrease in production,” he said.
“Based on estimates of short and longrun supply elasticities, we estimate that
the decrease in domestic production
due to these proposals will be less than
one-half of one percent, even in the
long run.” Oil production employment
would fall by a similar percentage, he
added.
Since gas is a North American
instead of global commodity in the
US market, Krueger said impacts from
removing tax preferences would be
larger, but still modest. Estimates by the
Treasury Department’s Economic Policy
Office said the subsidies are equal to
about 1% of total gas industry revenues
over the last 2 years, suggesting that
their removal would result in about a
maximum 1% price increase, he said.
Consumers probably would reduce
demand by less than 0.5% as a result,
he suggested.
“Over the long term, employment in
the natural gas production and supply
industry could change by an amount
similar to the change in production.
As in the case of oil, eliminating the
distortionary influence of the tax
preferences for gas will result over
time in new jobs being created in other
sectors,” said Krueger. “And, like oil
production, the natural gas industry
is highly capital-intensive relative to
the US economy as a whole, suggesting these tax subsidies are not effective
means for domestic job creation.”
He said policies that reduce US

and gas, if any, would help us conserve energy, and adjust to alternative energy sources and high energy
prices in the future. The government
should get out of the business of
subsidizing oil and gas, especially via
the tax system.”
The two industry witnesses contended that the costs to the nation
would be high. Nichols said, “The
proposals will make it more difficult,
and more expensive, to meet our
country’s energy needs; will undermine our goal of energy security;
will reduce jobs, investment, and

Unconventional Gas:
New Methods. New Supply.

Change happens fast in this industry and keeping clients aware of new
technology and solutions is essential.
Over the last decade technology advancements improved our capabilities to
predict, drill and produce natural gas in areas previously thought impossible.
These more sophisticated technologies have led to new opportunities in
re-examining existing wells and bringing untapped on line reserves leading
to new supplies.
Plan today to exhibit and sponsor at the Unconventional Gas International
Conference & Exhibition, September 29 – October 1 at the Fort Worth
Convention Center. Come by and meet decision makers who are willing to
discuss their next project.

for: Developing our own resources will
bring an estimated $2.2 trillion to $3.7
trillion in federal revenue. With this
bill, we truly began the path toward
a clean energy future by investing in
clean energy, creating US jobs immediately and long into the future, [and]
cleaning the environment, all without
raising taxes,” he maintained.

‘More robust’
Following the hearing, the subcommittee’s chairman, Jim Costa (D-Calif.),
told reporters that he and the bill’s 36
other cosponsors would like to talk to
the full committee’s chairman, Nick
J. Rahall (D-W.Va.) about moving HR
2227 forward. Noting that Rahall on
Sept. 8 announced his own energy
bill, which would make major changes
in the federal mineral leasing system,
Costa said: “We think a more robust
proposal has a better chance.” He added
that he also would encourage US Interior Sec. Ken Salazar to expedite a new
5-year OCS plan.
“Chairman Rahall knows about this
bill’s existence and our desire to move
it forward,” added Abercrombie, who
was sitting nearby. “So far, our talks
have been collegial.”
In addition to distributing $440
billion, or 20%, of projected new
federal OCS revenues to a renewable
energy and energy efficiency reserve
for research and development, HR
2227 would send $660 billion, or
30%, to producing states which work
with the federal government to allow
exploration and production of offshore
resources; $220 billion, or 10%, to fund
clean coal technology and carbon capture and sequestration research; $220
billion, or 10%, to an environmental
restoration reserve; and $220 billion, or
10%, for the general federal treasury.
A further $176 billion, or 8%, would
go to a conservation reserve; $110 billion, or 5%, to a carbon-free technology deployment and nuclear energy
reserve; $110 billion, or 5%, to a clean
water reserve; and $44 billion, or 2%,
to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).

T E R E S T
The measure also would approve
the 2010-15 OCS plan and expedite
reviews; expedite lease sales; extend
coastal states’ boundaries from three to
a uniform 12 nautical miles, providing
jurisdiction for state royalty payments
within the 12 miles; establish an expedited inventory of offshore energy
resources; repeal the ban on oil and gas
development within 125 miles of shore
in the eastern Gulf of Mexico; and establish procedures to expedite judicial
reviews of oil and gas leases.

‘Aren’t in stone’
When Hastings asked Abercrombie
if he would object to HR 2227’s being
offered as a substitute to Rahall’s or
another House Democratic energy bill,
Abercrombie said he would not. But he
also urged House Republican leaders
to join the working group for his and
Murphy’s bill and present ideas from
their own plan.
“The members who worked on this
bill didn’t agree to every provision, but
they kept working on it. The numbers
aren’t written in stone,” he said. Attaching HR 2227 to other legislation also
would be acceptable, he added.
It’s imperative for Congress to pass
an energy bill, Murphy said. “I don’t
want to repeat the mistakes of the
1970s, when oil prices went down and
America went back to sleep. Members
of [the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries] want oil back at
$90/bbl soon and $200/bbl within 2
years,” he said. The US should continue
pushing for efficiency, conservation,
and alternatives and developing more
of its domestic oil and gas resources, he
maintained.
Speaking with reporters, Murphy
said the bill’s core working group
involved six to eight House members
and their staffs, with input from several
other members. Responding to Hastings and Lamborn’s suggestions that the
bill falls short of what is needed, the
Pennsylvanian said: “This bill has so
many elements in it I’d be hard-pressed
to think of what’s been left out. But
we’re one oil embargo away from eco-

nomic catastrophe. Being too dogmatic
just leads to a big coughing session.”
Responding to Costa’s question about
what Abercrombie thinks the Obama
administration’s energy policy approach
is, the member from Hawaii replied: “I
see a policy that’s trans-Cabinet” with
the energy and interior secretaries and
Environmental Protection Agency administrator working together under the
direction of Carol M. Browner, White
House coordinator of energy, environmental, and global climate change
policy.
He also suggested that, as others in
Washington concentrate on health care
and overall economic issues, recognition is growing in Congress that nonpartisan, constructive energy legislation
needs to be passed. “Every day, we get
more information that something needs
to be done, that we can’t keep sending
billions of dollars overseas, and that
this country needs to use all technologies to be energy-independent,” he said
following the hearing.

Other witnesses
Two witnesses on a second panel
presented contrasting views. Doug
Morris, the American Petroleum Institute’s upstream and industry operations
director, reiterated API’s position that
the nation needs a balanced, fact-based
energy policy promoting efficiency and
conservation and greater supplies of
all forms of energy, including oil and
gas. “Passage of this legislation would
mean new jobs; more revenues for
cash-strapped local, state, and federal
governments; and greater energy security for our country,” he said.
Athan Manuel, the Sierra Club’s
lands protection program director, said
the environmental organization supports most of HR 2227’s provisions but
opposes oil and gas activity on the OCS
where it is not taking place already.
He said wind power would be better,
prompting Lamborn to suggest that the
Sierra Club’s own estimates project that
300,000 windmills, or 166 for every
mile of shoreline, would be required
to fully realize wind energy potential

off the East Coast. Manuel responded
that the number probably would be less
as the wind energy industry develops
more efficient technology with smaller
windmills and uses floating, instead of
fixed-leg, production platforms.
Several organizations said they were
pleased that the subcommittee held the
hearing, which more Republicans than
Democrats attended.
“While some of the debate in
Washington continues to focus on
how to discourage domestic oil and
gas production, through burdensome
federal regulations and even higher
taxes, today’s hearing was an honest,

forthright, and energizing discussion
about the role that affordable, available
energy will continue to play in our
economy,” said Independent Petroleum
Association of America Pres. Barry Russell. “It is encouraging that Democrats
and Republicans are coming together,
joining hands, and working to end the
ban on offshore energy production.”
David Holt, president of the Consumer Energy Alliance, called the hearing timely. “In less than 2 weeks, the
Interior Department’s public comment
period regarding the upcoming 5-year
OCS plan will close, and the fate of do-

mestic energy production for the next
several years, and possibly well beyond
that, will in part be determined,” he
said.
Thomas J. Pyle, president of the
Institute for Energy Research, said he
hoped the hearing sent a message to
Salazar. “If we are to remain competitive in a highly competitive global
economy, we cannot continue to turn
our backs on America’s energy,” he
said. “Instead of putting up endless
roadblocks to energy production, the
Obama administration should be standing shoulder to shoulder with these
responsible policymakers.” ✦

CFTC’s role
in cap-and-trade

T

he US Commodity Futures
Trading Commission expects to
actively participate in any federal carbon cap-and-trade regulation, CFTC
Chairman Gary G. Gensler told a US
Senate committee on Sept. 9.
The commission should be ready
because it already has experience
regulating in three of the five broad
regulatory components he believes
would comprise a US cap-and-trade
regime, Gensler said in testimony
to the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition,
and Forestry Committee.
“Over the past year, we have
witnessed the consequences that
regulatory gaps and inconsistencies
can have on our financial system, the
economy, and the American people,”
he said. “As Congress moves forward
with potential cap-and-trade legislation, I believe it should ensure that
there is a comprehensive regulatory
framework over the expanded carbon
markets, both the futures market and
the cash market, without exception.”
Effectively regulating carbon allowance trading will require several
regulators’ cooperation, Gensler said.
The effort will need to involve standard setting and regulation, recordkeeping (including maintaining a
registry), trade execution system
oversight, clearing of trades oversight, and protection against fraud,
manipulation, and other abuses, he
said.

Regulating trade
The first two components fall
within other agencies’ expertise
because they “are better equipped to
regulate the ‘cap’ part of ‘cap-andtrade’,” Gensler told the committee.

48

But the agency has broad experience
in the three other areas, he said.
“The commission already oversees
trading and clearing of futures and
options contracts based on sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and carbon dioxide allowances and offsets listed on
the New York Mercantile Exchange
and the Chicago Climate Futures
Exchange [CCX],” said Gensler.
In August, Gensler said, under authority it received in last year’s Farm
Bill, the commission sought public
comment on possibly classifying the
carbon financial instrument contract
traded on the CCX as a significant
price discovery contract.

‘Abundant experience’
Gensler added that the CFTC has
“abundant experience” regulating
centralized marketplaces and would
be well-suited to regulate cash
markets for emissions instruments if
Congress desired.
“The emissions trading markets
that the CFTC currently regulate are
small relative to the expected growth
of the carbon market as a result of
cap-and-trade legislation. Still, the
agency has the expertise to apply the
same oversight to the much larger,
national and mandatory market,”
Gensler said.
The agency would need more
money to expand its staff and implement technology to oversee new
carbon markets, he warned. CFTC is
only now getting back to its staffing
levels of the late 1990s, which were
cut by 20% as markets grew fivefold and contract volumes climbed
sixfold, he said.
But Gensler said his agency could
do the job. ✦

offsets. If we were to look at completely
eliminating them in favor of only a
price collar, there would be additional
uncertainties.”
“Part of setting up a cap-and-trade
system is establishing a market, which
is the best mechanism for setting
prices,” said Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH).
“The question then becomes how to
avoid volatility and interference.”
“A price collar is the kind of intervention we want because it would be
beneficial,” said Jason Grumet, president of the Bipartisan Policy Center.
But another witness, Michael Wara, an
assistant professor at Stanford University’s law school, said that a price floor
also matters. “The key to having a price
floor is to have something for innovative firms to take to potential investors.
Without one, financial markets set the
[carbon] price at zero,” he said.
Witnesses also discussed international offsets in cap-and-trade programs,
which apparently primarily involve restraining deforestation. “Where I come
from in Louisiana, we’re grinding up
new-growth cypress wood into pellets
for shipment overseas so factories in the
European Union can meet their carbon
emissions reduction goals,” he said.
“Where is the sense in that?”
The hearing was the first of two on
global climate change issues that the
committee scheduled during the week.
The second was held on Sept. 17. ✦

GAO says MMS may
be forfeiting millions
in RIK gas revenue
Nick Snow

The US Minerals Management
Service may be forfeiting millions of
dollars in natural gas royalties under its
royalty-in-kind (RIK) program because
it apparently isn’t identifying and collecting on imbalances, the Government
Accountability Office said.

The MMS, part of the Department
of the Interior, estimates that it is owed
$21 million for past imbalances but says
it lacks the information to calculate the
full amount due, GAO said. “MMS does
not have sufficient data to determine
whether it received its full percentage
of RIK gas,” it added.
GAO released the assessment 2 days
before US House Natural Resources Committee hearings on legislation Chairman
Nick J. Rahall (D-W.Va.) introduced on
Sept. 8 that would restructure the federal
minerals oversight system. The bill would
eliminate the RIK program.
GAO’s report said MMS’s estimate
does not include interest on some
unpaid amounts because the agency has
not determined when interest begins to
accrue, as required by law.
“Further, MMS monitors imbalances
on a monthly, rather than daily, basis,
which leaves open the possibility that
some companies owing RIK gas could
provide less to MMS when prices are

relatively high, making up the difference when prices are relatively low,” it
continued. “[This] could cost MMS additional revenue because it could miss
the opportunity to sell gas on the days
when prices are high.”

Rahall introduces major federal mineral policy reform bill
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
US House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Nick J. Rahall (D-W.
Va.) introduced a major federal minerals policy reform bill on Sept. 8. Its
provisions include consolidation of the
US Minerals Management Service and
Bureau of Land Management.
HR 3534 also would eliminate the
royalty-in-kind program and federal
reimbursement on interest accrued on
overpayments a lessee erroneously
makes, raise onshore rental rates for
the ﬁrst time since the 1980s, require
new rules to ensure diligent development of leases, and assess a fee on
existing leases that are not producing
oil and gas, according to the committee
majority’s summary of the bill.
The committee will hold hearings
on Sept. 16-17 to discuss the measure,

Rahall said on Sept. 10. He added that
US Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and
representatives from the US Department of the Interior Inspector General’s
Ofﬁce and the Government Accountability Ofﬁces are expected to testify,
along with representatives from energy
industries, environmental organizations, and other stakeholders.
“Last year, upon lifting the moratorium on oil and gas drilling in the
Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), Americans were handed an opportunity to
explore the vast potential of our public
energy resources in offshore waters,”
said Rahall. “This legislation lays the
groundwork to ensure those resources
are developed as efﬁciently and expeditiously as possible so that domestic oil
and gas can begin ﬂowing from those
newly opened areas.”
Doc Hastings (R-Wash.), the committee’s ranking minority member, at-

tacked the measure at a Sept. 9 hearing
as “a big government bill that throws
up more bureaucratic roadblocks on
the path to American energy production and job creation. Instead of pushing to open additional areas for drilling,
Democrats are raising fees and taxes,
ballooning government bureaucracy,
rolling out more red tape, and delaying
greater wind, solar, oil and natural gas
production.”
His remarks came at the opening of
the committee’s Energy and Mineral
Resources Subcommittee hearing on
HR 2227, an OCS bill that Reps. Tim
Murphy (R-Pa.) and Neil Abercrombie
(D-Ha.) introduced on May 4. Hastings
and Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.), the subcommittee’s ranking minority member,
said that this measure falls short of the
House Republican leadership’s socalled “all of the above” energy bill.

Romania’s
on the map

R

omania’s oil and gas industry is
beginning to turn some heads
these days, with an international
energy conference scheduled for
Sept. 30-Oct. 2 and new production
commencing offshore.
With a host of prominent speakers lined up, next week’s Black Sea
Energy & Economic Forum looks to
be a major focal point for high-level
discussion about the region and its
place on the world energy map.
Among the initial speakers are
Romanian President Traian Basescu,
US Sen. Chuck Hagel, Chairman of
the Atlantic Council, Ambassador
Richard Morningstar, US Special Envoy for Eurasian Energy, and Eni SPA
Chief Executive Paolo Scaroni.
It looks to be an informative occasion especially given the hopes
for the region’s oil and gas, to say
nothing of the politics which, in the
past, have sometimes hindered their
development and export to world
markets.

SOCAR interested
Other interests are meanwhile
eyeing Romania, including the State
Oil Co. of the Azerbaijan Republic
(Socar), which continues to show
interest in refining in the country.
“This issue is on the agenda, and it
is attractive enough,” said one Socar
official.
In Romania, all refineries are
private, he said, so negotiations
can be conducted only with private
entrepreneurs. “This requires a long
period of negotiations and evaluation,” the official said.
As those negotiations get under
way—or not—Romania’s largest oil
company Petrom started production
50

at its recently drilled Delta 6 and
Lebada Vest wells on Histria XVIII
block in the Black Sea.
According to Petrom, the production of the two new wells together
accounts for 10% of Petrom’s daily
offshore production.
“This recent production start-up
on Delta field is a great achievement,
taking into consideration the technical difficulties we have experienced
during drilling Delta 6,” said Johann
Pleininger, Petrom executive board
member responsible for exploration
and production.

Extended reach
“As the concept of extended reach
drilling has proved to be successful,
Delta 6 might become our most valuable well in Romania,” Pleininger
said.
Petrom is currently operating five
producing commercial fields: Lebada
Est, Lebada Vest, Sinoe, Pescaru, and
Delta. The country’s offshore production stands at 32,000 boe/d or about
18% of Petrom’s domestic production.
Word of the new offshore production will be welcomed in the
country, especially given recent
reports that Romania’s energy output
fell by 7.7% on the year in the first
7 months of 2009, while imports
decreased by an annual 39.3%.
According to the National Statistics Institute, Romania’s energy
production totaled 13.277 million
tonnes of oil equivalent (toe), while
imports reached 5.960 million toe
through July.
Romania saw a 6.7% decrease in
its production of oil to 2.413 million
toe. ✦

OPEC sees world oil
demand to rise in 2010
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, standing by an
earlier forecast, predicted that world
oil demand will decline slightly in
2009 but will resume growing in
2010.
In its September report, OPEC said
world oil demand in 2009 would
contract by 1.56 million b/d to 84.05
million b/d. Last month, OPEC said that
the contraction would be slightly larger
at 1.65 million b/d for this year.
However, reiterating a figure it used
in last month’s report, the group said,
“In 2010, global demand is forecast to
return to growth following 2 years of
consecutive declines, increasing 0.5
million b/d to stand at 84.6 million
b/d.”
According to OPEC, “The US is
playing a significant role in world oil
demand, showing a comeback and
reducing the contraction from 0.7
million b/d in July to almost flat in
August.”
OPEC attributed the comeback in
the US to “improved economic activity, summer driving consumption, and
the low base in the same month of
2008.”
It also said oil demand is strong in
developing countries such as China,

that those same regions would remain

“As seen in recent years, most of the

Exploration is planned in eastern and
northwestern Arizona in the Holbrook
basin and in a subbasin of the Basin
and Range Province.
An oil, gas, and helium exploration
program with capital spending of as
much as $29 million is on tap in eastern Arizona’s Holbrook basin.
And explorers will look for oil and
gas in northwestern in Arizona southeast of Las Vegas, Nev., in a subbasin
west of Kingman.
Both programs involve acreage
farmed out from PetroSun Inc., Scottsdale, Ariz.
Arizona’s oil and gas production
comes from Dineh-bi-Keyah field and
several small fields in northern Apache
County in the Four Corners area.
June’s production totaled 4,126 bbl
of oil, 93% of which is from Dineh-biKeyah, and 58.8 MMcf of gas, 73% of
which came from the large field.
Arizona, which also has produced
helium in the past, has produced no
carbon dioxide since July 2003.

A study has shown
that steamflooding
distillation effects would
improve crude recovery
from thin reservoirs with
less viscous crude.
Production
Steam distillation
means that steam injection will cause some volatile components of the crude to enter a vapor
phase.
At present, the industry mostly uses
steamflooding for exploiting heavy oil
reservoirs. In recent years, however,
some interest has been shown in using
steamflooding for recovering crude
from thinner reservoirs containing
lighter crudes.1 2 One example of a successful application was a reservoir in the
NPR-3 oil field in Wyoming.
The reservoir was first developed in
1922, but its primary recovery was only
5%. In 1985, steam injection started in
the reservoir and by the end of 1996
the recovery had increased to 13.5% of
the oil in place.3

Distillation effects
Steam distillation in porous media
is an important mechanism in steamflooding, especially for thin oil reservoir.4 5
Our study showed that steam distillation of crude is not the major mechanism during steamflooding of heavy oil
reservoirs and it can be ignored when
crude viscosity is greater than 1,000 cp.

O D U C T I O N

But for steamflooding in thin, lightoil reservoirs, steam distillation of the
crude becomes an important mechanism, contributing about 30% of the
recovery.
The distillation effect depends
mainly on crude oil properties, and
reservoir temperature and pressure. In
normal cases, the distillation effect is
more pronounced with a lower forma-

thin, light-oil reservoir recoveries
tion pressure.
Steamflood recovery improves when
the reservoir has higher remaining oil
saturation after a conventional waterflood. Therefore, it is favorable to start
steamflooding at an earlier stage.
The favorable effects of steam distillation include:6
• Decrease in flow resistance because
of a lower gas viscosity.
• Formation of a solvent drive in the
frontal zone.
• Transfer of light components in
dead-end pores to the connected pores.
• Reduction in crude oil viscosity by
self-dilution.
During steam injection, the evaporation pressures of crude oil and water
increase with increasing temperature.

relative density, temperatures, pressure,
and initial oil in place on distillation.
The effect of steam distillation mostly depends on the crude properties. In
the normal case, a smaller relative crude
density results in more distilled components. A smaller crude viscosity leads to
a greater steam distillation ratio.
Figs. 1 and 2 show the effects of
dead oil viscosity and density on distillation.
Table 6 shows the results of steamflooding in thin reservoirs at four
water-cut stages. As seen from Table 6,
an increased water saturation leads to a
poorer steamflood, but the effect of the
water storage volume on the distillation
effect is not significant because when
the water saturation increases, the corresponding oil saturation decreases.
The solvent banks formed in the
steam drive process are small and

the thermal recovery process, the steam
does not need to enter all the rock
pores. Maintaining the temperature of
the heat carrier can increase the heat
effect.
Increasing steam quality is the main
method for maintaining the temperature of the heat carrier. Regarding the
thermophysical parameters of steam,
steam has high latent heat of vaporization and specific volume, and the heat
of high quality wet steam is greater
than that of low quality wet steam.
Furthermore, the energy of a vapor

water molecule is greater than that of
the liquid state and results in a stronger
steam distillation effect.
Table 7 shows the effect of steam
injection rate on steam distillation.
Steam injection rate and steam injection
pressure are two related parameters.
Increased steam injection rate needs an
increased steam injection pressure.
Increasing steam injection rate helps
in reducing wellbore heat loss and
improves steam quality at the bottom
of the hole and thus increases steam
distillation. High pressure, however,
will suppress steam distillation, so that
injection rate has a limited effect on
steam distillation. ✦

and generality. The predicted flue-gas
sulfuric-acid dewpoints are in excellent
agreement with experimental data with
the root mean square deviation of 0.73.

Flue-gas SOx
Sulfur compounds such as H2S,
methyl mercaptan (CH4S), and sulfur
(Sx) are present in industries chiefly as
undesirable by-products of fossil fuel
processing, including natural gas and
petroleum. These pollutants burn in the
incinerator to produce sulfur oxides in
the flue combustion gas.1 2
Flue gas always contains substantial
water vapor. Sulfur trioxide and water
have a great affinity for each other:
When temperatures are lowered to the
dewpoint, the two combine rapidly
to form sulfuric acid. The condensed
sulfuric acid also has a powerful affinity
for water to the extent
that the concentrations of sulfuric acid
occurring at elevated
dewpoint temperatures
are corrosive to steel

and almost all plastics,
as well as hydraulic cement composites.3

some disagreements between experimental data and the Verhoff and Banchero correlation, especially at low SO3
concentration and high H2O content.
Dewpoints predicted in the range of
120-140° C. have a positive deviation
of 4° C. and more. Also in the range of
100-121° C., the predicted dewpoints
are 2.5-4° C. low.
Okkes proposed a correlation to
overcome some of these shortcomings that can be written as Equation
2, in which the partial pressures are
expressed in atmosphere and the dewpoint is in °C.6 Although this correlation
is more accurate at H2O concentrations
higher than 25%, but it significantly
under predicts the acid dewpoints at
low H2O concentrations prevailing in
the oil and gas industry.

P ROPOSED CORRELATION VS. EXPERIMENTAL DEWPOINTS

New correlation

190

This work proposes a new correlation (Equation 3), based on all verified
experimental data, for accurate prediction of flue-gas sulfuric-acid dewpoints.
A set of 188 validated data points7 has
been used to derive the correlation.
Fig. 2 uses Equation 3 to predict
flue-gas sulfuric-acid dewpoints and
compares them with experimental data
at different SO3 and H2O concentrations
in Fig 2. As shown, the acid dewpoint
is very sensitive to the flue-gas SO3
concentration so that a small increase
in SO3 concentration leads to a large increase in acid dewpoint at a given H2O
concentration.
The effect of moisture concentration
on acid dewpoint is moderate, however, especially at high SO3 concentrations. As shown, the SO3 species has a
very strong influence on sulfuric-acid
dewpoint at SO3 concentrations of less
than 100 ppm (vol). Thus accurate
prediction of acid dewpoints, especially
at low SO3 concentrations prevailing in
petroleum industries, is very important
to mitigate corrosion problems in process equipments.8
Flue gas always contains a substantial
amount of water vapor. Also, the added
moisture during turbine inlet-fogging
operations affects the sulfuric-acid dew-

China had at least 300 million bbl
of crude storage capacity at the start of
2009, of which Sinopec owns nearly
half, CNPC-PetroChina around 40%,
and CNOOC-SinoChem-others the rest.
Actual and effective sizes, however, vary
and because these storage tanks—old
and new—are all over the country, their
overall utilization rates, particularly at
old facilities, are low.
Sinopec established its Sinopec Commercial Crude Reserve Center in 2008
to manage its oil storage. The center will
manage financing of oil procurement
and flows into and out of storage.

Exploration, production software adds improvements
Newly released DataVera Version 8 includes improvements to existing DataVera
functionality and introduces a module for
exploration and production master data
management (MDM).
The suite of tools leverages a repeatable
and scalable E&P specific rules engine to
solve complex data issues. It contains five
modules to quickly complete data profiling and assessment, large scale data cleansing and consolidation, and continuing data
quality monitoring.
DataVera MasterSet is the latest addition
to the family and can achieve enterprisewide MDM. In collaboration with clients
who have used DataVera to implement
MDM, the new module combines features
that existed in the other DataVera modules into a single module with improved
functionality.
MasterSet has advanced MDM rules to
help users consolidate individual DataVera HealthCheck quality metrics across
multiple data stores, and it includes more

matching algorithms and E&P specific
rules.
More than 400 new E&P specific data
quality rules have been added to the
DataVera repository of 10,000+ rules
as part of Version 8. This empowers E&P
companies with an enhanced solution and
the high quality data. In addition, a new
“rules builder” wizard has been added so
that users can quickly and effectively create
complex rules.
Google Earth has been integrated into
the whole suite of modules. In addition,
continuous work has also been completed
around the integration with other applications, such as PetrisWINDS Enterprise and
OpenWorks.

Obama team sheds
green-job leader
but keeps his ideas
The imprudence over which Van Jones
lost his job should not divert attention
from the conviction that had propelled him
into the administration of US President

Jones resigned Sept. 6 from his position as special adviser for environmental
jobs following reports about politically
indelicate utterances in his past.
His resort to vulgarity to describe

Republicans caused some concern—although it was hardly unprecedented.
More damaging was his signature
on a 2004 petition suggesting that the
administration of former President George
W. Bush allowed the attacks of Sept. 11,
2001, to occur so as to have an excuse to
wage war on Iraq. After disclosure of that
indiscretion—which supporters incredibly
attributed to failure to read before signing—Jones looked irretrievably radical.
Conservatives, led by television analyst
Glenn Beck, hyped the image in what
Jones, to no help to himself, branded at
the time of his resignation as “a vicious
smear campaign against me.”
The worst part of the affair is that the
Obama camp has shed itself of Jones but
not of the commitment he embodied to
“green jobs.” Before his brief career in
federal government, Jones had attracted
attention for his work linking environmentalism with advocacy for the poor.
In his vision, the government creates
green jobs that simultaneously lift unemployed people out of poverty and save
the planet. While the vision glitters with
sales appeal, it can’t work. Its assumptions
about the link between environmental
progress and employment are specious.
Government jobs require money diverted from private enterprise by taxation.
That money can’t be spent on private-sector salaries. And green employment is the
core rationale for heavy subsidization and
forced sale of energy too costly otherwise
to compete.
Economic theory questions the effectiveness of work programs rooted in
noncommercial energy. Experience, documented recently in a Spanish study noting
the loss of 2.2 jobs for every renewableenergy position financed by government,
substantiates the doubt (OGJ, Apr. 20,
2009, p. 64). Costs and inefficiencies make
governmentally sponsored green employment a net job destroyer.
Jones and his former boss do the poor
no favors by insisting otherwise.

Surprise rally in gas prices
A four-session natural gas rally from a 7-year low culminated with a 15% jump
past $3/MMbtu Sept. 10—the largest 1-day gain in almost 5 years in the New York
market. The October contract closed at $3.26/MMbtu, up 42.7¢ for the day on top
of an earlier 35% surge through the three previous sessions.
In Houston, analysts at Raymond James & Associates Inc. reported, “While
most economic indicators are pointing towards a quicker-than-expected rebound
from the recession (and consequential snap-back in industrial demand), with 8
weeks left in the injection season and [US gas] storage levels already at 3.4 tcf, a
record high for this time of year, it is hard to see the move as anything other than a
technical rally.”
In New Orleans, analysts at Pritchard Capital Partners LLC said, “The gain was
driven by short covering as shorts came to the realization that natural gas makes a
seasonal low in September and tends to rally through the winter months.” Another
“bullish indicator” is that in the first and second quarters, “89% and 96% [respectively] of all wells drilled were completed vs. an average of 85% the previous
six quarters; we believe that the inventory of drilled but not completed wells is
relatively insignificant at this time and the 1,900 uncompleted well inventory from
fourth quarter 2008 has declined significantly,” they said.
Adam Sieminski, chief energy economist, Deutsche Bank, Washington, DC,
said, “At the current rate of increase, we believe [gas] storage is nearly certain to
exceed the all-time high of 3.565 tcf reached in late October 2007.” As a result, he
said, “The strong rebound in US natural gas prices this week will therefore be difficult to sustain.”
Sure enough, the rally ended Sept. 11 when the contract dropped to $2.96/
MMbtu, perhaps marking the end of buying to cover short positions, Pritchard
Capital Partners said. However, they said, “Meaningful declines in natural gas supply from reduced production and higher demand should cause natural gas prices
to spike in the first quarter of 2010.” Gas prices were up in early trading Sept. 14.
CFTC changes
The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s plan to divide investors into
“more precise” categories to improve transparency in the commodities market includes “some flaws that could lead to wrong trading conclusions if the data is not
properly analyzed,” said Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland.
CFTC’s “Disaggregated Commitment of Traders” report covers 22 different
commodities, “but not all of them,” Jakob warned. The CFTC plans to extend
coverage to more commodities in the coming months. “But energy traders need to
consider that the new report while it covers the InterContinental Exchange’s West
Texas Intermediate [positions] does not cover the WTI financial futures,” he said.
On Sept. 8, Jakob said, “Large speculators are net short 24,813 WTI financial
contracts so excluding them from the new report will overestimate the net length
and price impact of large speculators.” Likewise, he said, the report does not cover
the natural gas swaps-on-futures. “Large speculators are net short in natural gas
futures but net long in natural swaps-on-futures; hence the…report will overestimate the net short of large speculators in natural gas.”
The “main interest” of the report is that it breaks down what was previously
the “old commercial” category into producer, merchant, processor, and user—“a
category that uses futures to hedge their commercial activities and that we will
qualify as real ‘commercial’ and ‘dealers’ that use futures to hedge swaps exposure (i.e., the provider of a commodity index but as well a bank offering hedging
through swaps to a commercial entity),” Jakob said.
However, he said, “The ‘old noncommercial’ category (what we call the large
speculators) is split between ‘money managers’ (defined as commodity trading
advisors, commodity pool operators, and hedge funds identified by the CFTC
regardless if they are registered) and ‘other reportables,’ a category that includes
other nonidentified speculators.” Jacob said, “This means that true hedge funds
are likely to find their positions mixed between the money managers and the other
reportables. We can not read much in that split (i.e. money managers are net long
and other reportables are net short in WTI), and we think that the old aggregated
numbers for the large speculators leads to a better read of the financial flows.”
Therefore, Jakob said, the Petromatrix analysis of the disaggregated report
will merge the money managers and other reportables into one large speculator
category “until the CFTC can provide a better definition of other reportables.”

Networking To Top Talent OR
Networking Your Way to Top Talent

I

t would seem that during an economic slump, finding employees would be one of the
easiest tasks. The truth is, finding top talent is still quite difficult.
An unemployment rate over 9% means companies are sifting through an even larger sea
of unemployed people to find their talent. Unfortunately, many employers are still working
within the status quo of hiring methods. It is commonplace to post a job, wait for the resumes
to pour in and select talent based on those resumes. As the old saying goes, “work smarter
not harder.” Updating the recruitment strategy is a crucial step to increasing the number of
talented individuals joining your company. So what should your new strategy look like? It
is actually not a novel approach at all. Your strategy should be about leveraging the art of
networking. Although many talk about the importance of networking, it is still a second rate
practice in most organizations.
One efficient way of networking is through social
Networking should be

for openings you have now and in the future.
Networking technology puts important information at a
hiring manager’s fingertips.
A second important type of networking is through face-to-face events. Face-to-face
meetings give a recruiter or hiring manager one more dimension of detail. Job fairs are
certainly one way of face-to-face networking, but they are really only one step up from sifting
through resumes. A more effective networking strategy should include industry events. Just
like online targeted recruitment, industry events provide an entire pool of potential candidates
from a given industry. HR and hiring managers should become skilled at observing and
evaluating people at these events; as if watching on-the-job interviews in progress.
Many of the people you target at these events will be gainfully employed and may not be
looking for employment. Do not let this be a discouraging factor. Everyone is willing to hear
about an opportunity. This opens the door to a long-term connection. There will also be some
individuals actively seeking out new employment at conferences and tradeshows. Pay attention
to this active candidate pool as well. If they are trying to get in front of you at an event, they are
more savvy than the person who did nothing more than apply to an advertisement.
Networking should be an ongoing activity regardless of whether or not you currently
have a position open. It is important to build up your arsenal of identified talent for openings
you have now and in the future. The quality of individuals you identify through networking
will be greater because you have not limited your pool of candidates to only those who apply.

Stanna Brazeel,

Separating Yourself Post-Renaissance
By Jason McAuliffe, ERI

When I received a call from PennEnergy about
writing a short article on the current employment
landscape in the Refining Sector, I thought to
myself, “oh boy, this isn’t going to pretty.” If asked
to write on the same subject this time last year or in
2007, I may have declined because of our workload.
The perfect storm that led to the boom in refining
investment and expansion earlier this decade would
be a great article to write, but maybe next time.
While my eternally optimistic personality hopes we
see a resurgence in the Golden Age of Refining, it is
more realistic to conclude that the renaissance the
industry experienced earlier this decade will be a
subject we wax nostalgic about with our children.

The aptly dubbed “meltdown” that set in late last year and its
lingering aftermath has continued to weigh on the refining
sector. From 2001 to 2008, refiners were printing money with
fat margins on gasoline & diesel and major integrated oil
companies were even happier with the crude run up to $140+/
bbl. Most refiners were investing in their physical and people
assets. Mandates for Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel, ethanol as
oxygenate and environmental upgrades became an acceptable
cost of doing business. All of these investments created
an intense demand for a wide variety of engineering and
economic disciplines. These were good times.
Today’s look is that while crude oil has backed off 50 percent
from the historic high prices of last year, the demand
destruction caused by refined products prices has held
firm. Bottom line? There is little margin in the complex
manufacturing process of refining, and where you cannot find
margins, there is little support for investment. Welcome back
to the good old days, when the refining business was not a
profit center…make money on the crude, process at near cost,
then make money on the sale of taking the product to market.
The demand in today’s refining job market is about maintaining
assets. There is a fair amount of hiring taking place for
disciplines of reliability, maintenance, safety, instrumentation,

and process controls. We have seen little movement in roles
pertaining to design, planning, and construction of new units,
which undoubtedly is the result of major expansions being
shelved if there was room to walk away. What to expect moving
forward? The industry’s current players will either rationalize
the sale of assets or will hang on with minimal investment until
the market firms up and demand is on a consistent upswing.
Pressures from overseas refiners will put further short and
mid-term pressure on domestic refineries to cut costs or divest
marginal assets. We may see assets sold, but the counterparty is
likely to run the business with rational expectations for return
on investment and will need the best people to extract every
penny. The question for professionals seeking opportunities
in today’s and tomorrow’s refining industry is how to separate
yourself from the crowd.
Eighty percent or better of experienced professionals will
find their next career opportunity through a peer network
or industry association. When you add in those who find
employment by applying directly to a company (e.g., dropping
off a resume or applying online), you probably cover 95
percent. If you are in the unfortunate situation of being
unemployed, find a passion in networking or you will be
relying on fate. Applying through a website is easy but you

Energy Cycles Shouldn’t Deter the Next Generation
Why we still need to invest in future workforce staffing needs
By David Dunlap, BJ Services Company & Steve Nance, Steele Creek Investment Company

The current commodity price doesn’t change things.
As more petroleum specialists reach retirement age, we
need bright, innovative minds to enter the business to
help us meet the energy needs of the future.
What has been referred to as the “Great Crew Change” will
happen irrespective of high or low commodity prices. Now,
more than ever, our industry needs to focus on ensuring that we
keep a stream of new talent interested in entering our workforce
so we can meet the technical and environmental challenges
facing our national and global energy needs.
The fourth annual Industry Salute to Interns event, held on
July 21, 2009, provided an excellent opportunity for industry
representatives to meet with students who have demonstrated a
specific interest in a career in the oil and gas industry. Students
employed during the summer by Apache, Chevron, El Paso,
Halliburton, Noble Energy, Red Arrow Energy, Sanchez Oil &
Gas, Schlumberger and Shell participated in this one-day event
in Houston, hosted by the Offshore Energy Center.
The central theme of this year’s event was the future of the
industry, in light of the dramatic changes in oil and gas prices,
and the impact of the current economic crisis on hiring and job
opportunities. Presentations and panel discussions during the
day reinforced the message that the future of our industry is
bright, and opportunities for motivated and talented people in
our industry are tremendous.
Salute co-chairs were presented information and fielded
questions regarding the fundamentals of the energy industry and
the importance of hydrocarbons in the long-term global energy
future. Robert Drummond of Schlumberger, Anthony Gallegos
of Scorpion Offshore, Darrell Hollek of Anadarko, and John
Kelly of El Paso Exploration & Production Company participated
in a discussion in which each panelist described their company’s
strategies in the current market environment and the impact of
these strategies on future manpower requirements.
In addition to the panel, Laura Schilling of Halliburton and
Libby Cheney of Shell discussed career path options and offered

6

advice on how students can proactively manage their career and
ultimately get into their “dream job.”
The event included entertaining and informative presentations
from Jan Hargrave and Marilyn Moats Kennedy who discussed
body language and the challenges of communicating across
generation lines.
Questions asked by the interns at this year’s Industry Salute
event centered on the future of the oil and gas industry. Most
interns are aware of workforce reductions that have occurred in
the industry during the past year and a “boom-bust” perception
of the industry still exists.
Presentations and discussions during the day put this question
at the forefront and attempted to provide information to
these students to calm their concerns about the long-term
opportunities in the oil and gas industry.
In the end, the message conveyed during this event was this: The
energy business is indeed a great place to pursue a career. Yes, this
is a cyclical business. There have been cycles before and we will
encounter cycles in the future. But there is always a great career in
our industry for people who are motivated and willing to work hard.
A tremendous number of professionals in this industry will
retire over the next 10 to 15 years and the future is extremely
bright for talented individuals who enter the energy business.
In addition to oil and natural gas, we need all types of energy
professionals to meet our future needs. We need highly skilled
technical people to help unlock the resources, both renewable
and non-renewable, to meet future demand. We need people
focused on integrity, leadership and involvement in professional
societies and their communities.
The current economic environment coupled with recent increases
in supply will be short lived when looking at the macro energy
supply and demand picture. Companies have reacted differently
to the recent drop in commodity prices. Virtually everyone has
cut back on activity levels as evidenced by the dramatic drop in
North American drilling rig activity. Today, many companies are
focused on production optimization programs and developing

inventory for the inevitable upturn in prices. The greatest challenge these same
companies face is having an adequate workforce to support this activity when that
recovery begins.
There is no question that hiring interns and new employees has slowed for most,
if not all, companies during the past 12 months. We need to be careful that we
don’t let the pendulum swing too far and exacerbate the workforce issue facing our
industry as many reach retirement age over the next few years.
Hats off to the Offshore Energy Center and in particular, Sandra Mourton, the
Executive Director, for hosting such a great event. As an industry, we need to
maintain efforts to continue to attract talent and encourage students to seek careers
in oil and gas and once again the Industry Salute to Interns event proved to be a
great opportunity to convey this message. —EW

will likely find a better response trying
to communicate with office furniture. I
have seen hundreds of good articles on
networking and networking etiquette so
learn them and live them. Find out where
your hired peers were found and establish
yourself there, whether it be a trade
association, social networking site, or
coffee shop. Luck favors the prepared.
For a final word and note on my beloved,
albeit sometimes misunderstood,
profession: recruiters do not place many
people. . . I repeat, recruiters do not place
many people. Recruiters spend 90 percent
(or better) of their time searching for
professionals that have a very specific
background and experience in a particular
discipline. Find the recruiter(s) that are
the best in your industry and befriend
them. Mental note: “befriend” and “stalk”
are two very different concepts (research
networking etiquette). Experienced
recruiters love to network and hopefully
they will make some time for you. My
final word for today is to not let fate
determine your future. The worst time to
plan your future is when you are in the
situation that forces you to. Be proactive
and manage your own brand. —EW

Innovative Recruiting- Targeting Passive Professionals
By Evan Cohen, EVCO

As an HR professional, you might notice that
the recruiting landscape is changing rapidly and
that there is an immediate need to shift your
approach when recruiting employees. In order to
stay ahead of the curve and remain competitive,
HR management and recruiting professionals
must develop strategies to address these
challenges. Two such strategies include:
Defining your company’s description of a
“qualified-best match” candidate.
Developing the best strategy for targeting
and recruiting the best candidate, which
is typically the top performing industry
professional.

A “Qualified-Best Match”
This process starts with articulating exactly who your ideal
candidate is.
With a systematic approach to candidate profiling, you
should be able to identify the hard and soft skills, experiences
and attitudes, education and background that a candidate
should possess—traits that will ultimately translate into a top
performing employee.
One way to identify your “best match candidate profile” is by
interviewing your current top performers and isolating the
common traits that they all share.
Once you know exactly the type of candidates you are looking
for, you can begin to identify where you might find them.
The Difference Between Active and
Passive Candidates
Active job seekers are motivated by any number of
circumstances, are not necessarily working, and are typically

easier to find; that is, they probably have their resume posted
on a few job boards, are leaning heavily on their network of
professional associates to assist them in their search, and are
calling companies directly to learn about current and future
opportunities of employment.
Passive candidates are typically employed and satisfied with
their employer and are content in their current role. That is not
to say that if the right opportunity presented itself, they would
not be interested in learning more. However, they are most
likely not out in the field broadcasting their desire to find a new
opportunity. These professionals are probably looking to move
a bit slower, will have more questions, and will likely be a bit
more hesitant to risk leaving a good job for a new challenge and
increased risk.
Active and Passive candidates are not different people with
different skills sets and abilities. Candidates from one group are
not necessarily any better or worse than the other, they are just
at different points in their employment cycle.
Candidate interest and availability can be quite dynamic and
is dependent upon a number of factors. Changes in current
management, workloads or personal circumstances can
accelerate the transition from passive to active candidate. In
extreme cases, layoffs, natural disasters, lost contracts and other
forms of sudden shifts can lead this to happen overnight.
That being said, the true measure of your best candidate has
less to do with her state in seeking out a job, and more to do
with how she measures up to your company’s “best match”
candidate profile.
The Search Begins: Your Strategy
for Targeting and Recruiting the Best
Candidate
Why is it important to continuously search for both types of
candidates? To keep your candidate pipeline full! Successful
recruiters continually source both Active and Passive
candidates to ensure a wider pool from which to choose.
Doing so ultimately results in reducing the time-to-fill and the
cost per hire.

R e c r u i t e r ’ s

Active candidates typically will come to you, either by applying
directly for your positions, which may be posted on a job
board or corporate career site, or by placing a direct call to
your office. These inbound responses are easier to manage
because usually, the candidate has a working knowledge of
your company and is interested in joining the team. The only
“selling” that has to take place on the recruiter’s behalf occurs
during the compensation negotiation. Other than that, the
candidate rarely offers an objection to submitting an updated
resume or scheduling phone and face to face interviews.
Passive candidates are typically more difficult to find, so
sourcing a passive industry professional requires more
investigating through phone calls, referrals from network
partners and consistent and persistent relationship-building.
Professional recruiters are adept at being able to manage
both responsibilities: maintaining a steady flow of active
candidates to fill immediate needs, and establishing strong
industry relationships that yield passive candidate results over
time. By focusing on both types of candidates, the disruption
caused by vacancies can be minimized, and sometimes
avoided altogether. In addition, by making proactive attempts
to network, you are creating a competitive advantage by
spreading the message that you represent an employer of
choice within your industry.
The challenge that HR professionals and their recruiters face is
that they source and recruit both types of candidates using the
same approach.
The 5 Steps of Getting to “I accept!”
To attract the top performing passive industry professional,
HR managers must work closely with their recruiters to
develop and deliver the right message with the right frequency
to keep their company and current opportunities at the top of
their target candidate’s mind. That way, when the time is right
and the candidate is open to exploring new opportunities, her
first call is to the recruiter with whom she has an established,
long term relationship.
Once you identify your best match passive candidate, you
must provide her with the information she needs to evaluate
an opportunity objectively. When done correctly, you will
use a series of different recruiting and information-sharing
approaches and will move the candidate smoothly along a
path of increasing knowledge and interest until ultimately, she
decides to make the move.

E n e r g y Wo r k f o r c e

P r a c t i c u m

The following steps will guide you in ensuring that you stay on
track through the process:
• Hold an information-gathering session. Use your first
conversation to open dialogue and learn about interested
individuals as potential candidates. Have them tell you a
little about themselves first. Don’t go too fast, even if the
match seems perfect. Provide the person with a brief, highlevel overview of the job, and schedule an exploratory call
sometime later. Be a bit vague, and mention the importance
of the job to the company’s strategic direction. This approach
also gives you the option of networking with the candidate
and meeting with professionals they feel are top performers.
• Shift decision-making from a short-term emphasis to
a more long-term one. The basic goal of the preliminary
discussions is to have the candidate consider the strategic and
tactical issues associated with making a change and accepting
a new opportunity. Too often, candidates lose interest
and opt out early because the recruiter did not effectively
communicate the short-term goals and the long-term growth
opportunities. Understanding the candidate’s needs and
balancing the correct message will give a candidate enough
short-term information to understand how she can make an
immediate impact and enough long-term information to get
her excited about future projects and goals.
• Don’t rush the process. Passive candidates need time to absorb
the information you provide. While you can try to speed the
process along, you don’t ever want to come across as being
desperate. Ask questions and listen. If you’re talking too much,
you’re pushing. It’s better to find out what the candidate would
need to know to move to the next step in the evaluation process.
Scheduling an informal meeting, such as a lunch date, is a
great way to build your relationship and understand what she
is currently doing, and what underlying concerns or questions
you will need to address as your recruiting process continues.
• Create competition. Of course, the goal of this exercise is
to move this professional from candidate status to applicant
status as quickly as you both deem appropriate. Once you
are sure this candidate is a top professional and you have
addressed her major concerns, it is time to create a sense of
urgency. A great way to do this is by informing the candidate
that there are a number of professionals showing great
interest in the opportunity, but you consider her to be a
top candidate. Remember, a great job is always better when
there’s competition.

• Set the table. Invite the candidate to the office to meet the
team. In sports, as in recruiting, nothing is more important
and beneficial than utilizing the home court advantage.
When every employee the candidate will meet with
works together and understands her role in the recruiting
process, the candidate will have a true understanding of
the company’s culture and atmosphere and will be better
equipped to make the decision to join the organization.

You Should Post Your Resume
on PennEnergyJOBS.com

When recruiting passive candidates, use a professional, stepwise approach to provide them with small doses of information
that keep them engaged. You will know you’re successful when
the candidate starts asking you more questions, calls to see how
the interview went, or asks about the other candidates.

Post. Search. Work!

In time, the information you provide will be enough for the
candidate to realize that this is an opportunity worth pursuing,
so be aware, maintain control and be ready to move the process
towards closure.
Keep in mind, when the demand for talent outstrips the supply
of candidates, you are most likely to find the largest number
of top performing professionals among the ranks of passive
candidates. So maintain your relationships, ask for referrals and
always be recruiting! —EW

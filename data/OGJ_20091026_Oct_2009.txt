The View is Much Better
with 100 Levels
If your large seismic surveys are burdened by high costs, flawed data and lengthy acquisition times,
trust the new 100-level digital array SeisX service from Baker Hughes to deliver the fast, accurate
seismic data you need while lowering your operational costs.

Many multi-level seismic technologies still require repetitive shooting and multiple tool settings, which
can lead to inconsistent data, additional acquisition time and frustration. Our 100-level seismic array
uses superior data transmission rates and securely coupled tools to record the same shot at every
level, reducing acquisition time while delivering consistent, high-quality signals from shot to shot.
Wide aperture and large-fold coverage capabilities of the SeisX service – requirements for 3D VSPs
and walkaways – can now be achieved in one pass. Consistent SeisX signal acquisition across all
100 three-component receiver levels improves timing and wavefield separation to enhance data
migration, allowing operators to optimize well planning and streamline operations.

Take your seismic exploration to the highest level – select the SeisX service.

PLAN TO ATTEND & REGISTER TODAY!

MANAGING
THE WAVES
OF CHANGE
November 10 – 12, 2009
Moody Gardens Hotel and Convention Center • Galveston, Texas

Plan today to attend the 2009 conference and exhibition as the
technical focus shifts to “Managing the Waves of Change.”
CONFERENCE HIGHLIGHTS
Plan to attend this year and listen to speakers who bring insight to this complex industry. Opening and closing
session speakers include:
Keynote Speaker: Scott Tinker, Director, Bureau of
Economic Geology & State Geologist of Texas –
“What I Learned About Energy This Last Year.”

Charlie Morecraft – “Remember Charlie”

Scott Tinker is also Professor, Edwin Allday Chair of
Subsurface Geology, University of Texas at Austin,
and President of the American Association of
Petroleum Geologists.

Having been critically injured in an explosion that burned
over 45% of his body, Charlie Morecraft conveys, in the
most penetrating way, the lesson he so painfully learned.
Seldom are people confronted by the real consequences
of an abuse in safety practices. Anyone who hears
Charlie’s story will be deeply moved and motivated to
never again take safety for granted. Charlie’s emphasis is
on the signiﬁcance of attitude and personal responsibility.

The Deepwater Operations Conference & Exhibition is an annual event addressing the pertinent production
operations issues. It is directed toward operations staff as well as engineering and management personnel across
the spectrum of offshore exploration and production.
This year’s theme is “Managing the Waves of Change” and our advisory board has recruited speakers from
throughout the industry that will address real-life issues and solutions relevant to deepwater operations today.

“This conference has filled a real need in the industry; a forum for sharing deepwater production operations
practices and lessons learned among operators and contractors on a global scale.”
Mike Autin – BHP Billiton Petroleum

ExxonMobil ordered to pay in MTBE case
A US District Court in Manhattan found ExxonMobil Corp. liable for contaminating New York City’s ground water with methyl
tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and awarded the city $104.7 million
in damages, New York City officials said.
On Oct. 19, the New York City’s Law Department said a jury
awarded the compensatory damages after an 11-week trial in a
product-liability case. The city sued ExxonMobil for the costs of
removing MTBE from drinking water wells in southeast Queens.
The case was tried before Judge Shira Scheindlin of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. The trial focused
on six water wells.
A spokesman for ExxonMobil downstream issued a statement
saying the company was disappointed with the decision, and it
will consider all its legal options.
“As we’ve maintained throughout, our service stations were not
the source of the MTBE contamination” at the six wells, ExxonMobil said. “We do not believe we should be required to compensate the City of New York for someone else’s contamination.”
Several other large oil companies previously settled claims
from New York City against them for a total of $15 million.

Gazprom signs gas deal with Azerbaijan

OAO Gazprom will import 500 million cu m of Azerbaijani gas
starting in January 2010 under a contract signed with State Oil Co.
of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR).
“The contract doesn’t limit the maximum purchase volume.
The gas price will be defined under a price formula,” said Gazprom. Gas volumes may increase, it added, and signified a long
term partnership with Azerbaijan.
Alexey Miller, chairman of the Gazprom’s management committee, recently led a delegation to Azerbaijan. Miller said, “Gazprom owns the world’s largest contract portfolio for gas supply
to the domestic and foreign markets as well as an advanced and
flexible gas transmission system; Russia and Azerbaijan have a
common border and have already been connected by the unified
infrastructure.”
Azerbaijan holds up to 1.5 trillion cu m of proved natural gas

Petrobras, PDVSA resolve refinery terms
Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) said it has resolved
all outstanding issues with Venezuela’s Petroleos de Venezuela SA
over development of the Abreu e Lima refinery planned for Suape,
near Recife in northeastern Brazil.
Paulo Roberto Costa, Petrobras director for supply, said there
were no more obstacles to construction of the refinery, and that
there is no change in the proportion of investment required from
either side, with Petrobras to supply 60% of the refinery’s investment and PDVSA the remaining 40%.
However, PDVSA will have to pay Petrobras at least $400 million when it signs the final agreement for the Abreu e Lima refinery, according to a Petrobras spokesperson.
“This amount represents the obligations PDVSA has in this
project calculated until December 2008. A consulting company is
now reviewing all investments that both companies have to take
responsibility for as from January 2009,” the spokesperson told

“We expect the revised amount to be paid by cash immediately
after the agreement is signed,” the spokesperson added.
Asked if Brazil’s President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva would sign
a definitive agreement with Venezuela’s President Hugo Chavez on
an upcoming state visit, Petrobras Pres. Jose Sergio Gabrielli said
he didn’t know. Lula was to visit Caracas on Oct. 17-18, according
to Brazil’s foreign ministry.
Meanwhile, Costa said there had been several obstacles holding
up the refinery agreement, including the rising cost of the project,
which has escalated to about $12 billion from a preliminary estimate of $4.06 billion.
Petrobras said the increased cost of the joint venture was normal for such projects because pricing always increases once more
detailed plans are developed. Petrobras also said that $2 billion of
the cost increase came from the appreciation of Brazil’s currency.
Other areas of disagreement came over rights to purchase
products from the refinery and Venezuela’s desire for higherOil & Gas Journal / Oct. 26, 2009

China begins commissioning third LNG terminal
China’s Shanghai LNG terminal received its first LNG cargo of
45,000 cu m aboard the 88,000-cu m Arctic Spirit LNG carrier
from Bintulu, Malaysia, Oct. 11. A second cargo is slated for later
this month.
China National Offshore Oil Corp. owns 45% of the 3-million
tonne/year terminal with Shenergy Group (55%), the Shanghai
government’s power investment group. CNOOC last year signed a
25-year agreement to buy 2 million tpy from Qatargas Operating
Co. Ltd. with supplies to start later this year from the 7.8-million
tpy Qatargas 2 project. The terminal also has another 25-year supply contract with Malaysia for 3.03 million tpy.
Capacity at Shanghai is to be expanded to 6 million tpy at some
as yet unannounced date. China has two other operating LNG
terminals: the 6.2-million tpy Dapeng LNG terminal in southern
Guangdong Province and the 2.6-million tpy Fujian terminal,
which began operating earlier this year and is to be expanded to
5.2 million tpy (OGJ, June 1, 2009, p. 12).

Ban sought on Russian gas re-exports
Turkmenistan, now negotiating with Russia’s OAO Gazprom, is
seeking to ban the Russian firm from re-exporting the natural gas
it purchases from the Central Asian nation.
“The new contracts will include a clause banning re-export
of gas,” said Turkmenistan’s Deputy Premier Baimurad Khodzhmukhamedov at a conference in Ashgabat earlier this month.
Khodzhmukhamedov’s statements came ahead of this week’s
meeting between Turkmenistan’s President Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov and Gazprom Chief Executive Officer Alexei Miller
aimed at resuming Russia’s import of Turkmen gas that were suspended in April after a pipeline blast.
Both sides have since said they expect gas supplies to resume
before the end of October, but they are still negotiating the terms
of an amended supply agreement.
Prior to the blast, Gazprom had been buying 50 billion cu m/
year of Turkmen gas and re-exporting most of it to Ukraine, much
to the chagrin of Ashgabat.
While Turkmenistan wants to include the re-export ban, Gazprom wants to reduce its purchases of Turkmen gas to 30 billion
cu m/year and to establish a flexible pricing formula that will
ensure prices are in line with the international gas market.

that the 6.7-million tonne/year (tpy) Yemen LNG plant produced
its first LNG from the first of two planned trains. The second train
remains under construction.
The announcement did not specify to which customer this
first production was to be sent, saying only that the plant’s first
cargo is “scheduled in the coming weeks.” Three gas sales agreements were signed in 2005 with Kogas, GDF-Suez, and Total Gas
& Power Ltd.
The $4.5-billion project supplies gas from Block 18 in the
Marib region of central Yemen through a 320-km (nearly 200
miles) pipeline to the LNG plant at the port of Balhaf on the country’s southern coast of the Arabian Sea.
Counting this first train of Yemen LNG, this year has seen
nearly 30 million tpy of new production capacity come on line.
Sakhalin added two trains of 4.8 million tpy each earlier in the
year. Qatargas 2 started up its 7.8-million tpy Train 4 and hopes to
start up the 7.8-million tpy Train 5 by yearend.
In Asia, debottlenecking at Malaysia Dua was to have added 1.5
million tpy at some point in the year. And Indonesia’s 7.6-million
tpy Tangguh formally began operations but has been plagued by
outages and is currently shut down.
At last week’s World Gas Conference in Buenos Aires, BP’s Ton
Hayward said the project would produce from both trains this
week, declining to specify amounts or destinations.
Expected to start up very early in 2010 is Peru LNG’s 4.4-million tpy plant.

Midsize Chinese LNG plant to supply locally
China’s Ningxia Hanas Natural Gas Co. will employ Air
Products’ LNG process technology and equipment for a
midsize LNG project in Yinchuan, China, according to an
agreement with overall project manager Technip announced
Oct. 15.
Air Products will supply single mixed-refrigerant process
technology, engineering, design, and manufacturing of the

A friend of the journal
Alan Petzet
Chief EditorExploration
Publishing Oil & Gas Journal magazine and web site has always been a
challenging and rewarding task for the
small group of people whose names
you see on the masthead.
The group of editors, reporters, and
correspondents has been minimal compared with the magnitude of the task,
but that fraternity depends on a much
larger cadre of individuals: our sources
in the industry.
With mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, new startups, oil and gas price
fluctuations, technology development,
and so on, just keeping up with sources
is a time-consuming job.
Yet a relatively small number of folks
in the industry make unusually selfless
and long-lasting efforts to keep in touch
with OGJ and help us understand the
trends, technologies, economics, and
other complexities that make up the
industry we cover.
At some point we began referring to
those folks as “Friends of the Journal.”
The late Edward F. Durkee was one of
those friends.

The exploration life
OGJ doesn’t publish obituaries, but
Durkee’s business partner Selmer Pederson wrote a memorial to him in the
October 2009 issue of the American
Association of Petroleum Geologists
Bulletin.
The memorial was updated with
information provided by Durkee’s
daughter, Debora, and Dr. Tom Haskell
of New Zealand.
14

Durkee wasn’t president of a major
oil company or an emir or sheikh or
sultan, just a geologist who knew geology and economics and the exploration
business inside-out.
He was engaged at one time or
another in exploration on nearly every
continent except Antarctica, and at the
same time he was often working prospects of his own in the US.
He was involved in oil and gas
exploration since graduating from the
University of Wyoming in 1952.

Durkee and OGJ

No one here now can remember
how long Durkee maintained contact
with OGJ editors. He lived most of his
later life in Manila, where he opened
a consulting office in 1994, and was
involved in exploration throughout
Southeast Asia.
His written contributions go back
at least to 1985, when he cowrote
an exploration article on the Papuan
basin. We also published his articles on
Turkey, Myanmar, and several on the
Philippines.

US refining under threat
The threat to US refining from misguided
climate-change legislation has become chillingly
clear. Indeed, the clarification elicits a question:
Why would the US, as a matter of policy, swap
a large chunk of domestic refining capacity for
trivial cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases?
The American Petroleum Institute has released the full report of a study by EnSys Energy,
Lexington, Mass., on the effects on refining of
climate-change legislation passed in June by the
US House. The bill, whose sponsors are Henry
Waxman (D-Calif.) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.),
would cap emissions and create tradable emission
allowances.
API, which commissioned the study, in August
published a summary warning that enactment of
the Waxman-Markey bill would cut US refinery
throughput by as much as 4.4 million b/d by 2030
(OGJ, Sept. 7, p. 26). New details illuminate the
nature and extent of the hazard.

of 250,000 b/d by 2020 and 900,000 b/d by 2030.
The higher allowance costs raise consumption
cuts to 330,000 b/d by 2015 and 1.65 million b/d
by 2030.
In the EnSys model, cost increases hurt the
ability of US refiners to compete in this shrunken
market. While falling in the US, the study says,
throughput would be rising elsewhere—by
900,000-3.3 million b/d in 2030, necessitating US
product import gains of 14-19%.
For refiners, Waxman-Markey’s biggest effect
would be on variable operating costs. Allowance
costs for direct refinery emissions, net of free
allowances, would average 50¢-$1.20/bbl in 2015
and $2.70-7.20/bbl by 2030. The higher figure in
the 2030 range is nearly three times the operating cost EnSys considers typical. “These increases
would be a prime driver of the reductions in US
refineries’ ability to compete, in their projected
reduced throughputs, and the offsetting increases
in non-US refinery throughputs and investments,”

The perspective well

sandwiched 25 years with a

and now consults.
Here, for example, is
how Hill assesses time-lapse seismic,
also called 4D, in which sequential 3D

mainly source and receiver locations. Because the aim was to monitor changes in a specific set of survey
measurements, other conditions had
to be constant. The experiment, in
other words, had to be repeatable, a
requirement complicated by the marine
environment in which most time-lapse
surveys were and still are conducted.
Since the early days of time-lapse
work, Hill points out, increasingly precise survey geometry and other factors
of repeatability have given rise to new
information about the subsurface. Geophysicists now assess changes not only
in boundaries between reservoir fluids
but also, because production changes
reservoir volumes, movement in rocks surrounding
the reservoir.
“So we’ve learned some
things about rock physics
as a result of time-lapse
that make us better scientists,” Hill says.
He uses the same
framework to judge the
application of geophysical
methods to an emerging
technological frontier:
subsurface sequestration of
carbon dioxide as a way to
mitigate climate change.
“It’s going to be interesting to see where that
technology goes in the
future,” he says. “But it’s going to be
good for science because we’re going to
learn stuff.”

He offers examples from both science in general and geophysics
in particular.
Many years ago nuclear
physics joined astrophysics to help explain the distribution of
elements in the universe. Similarly,
nuclear physics expanded into medicine
to produce advances in health care. And
in modern geophysical work, solidstate detectors are replacing mechanical
geophones in land surveys, the result of
a combination of electrical engineering
with physics.
Similar mergers of geophysics with
other disciplines have fostered geophysical progress in the past: with electrical
engineering in the 1960s and 1970s
to bring geophysical methods into the
digital world, for example; with physics

Seismic attributes

Hill, who becomes SEG’s president at the group’s annual convention
this week, points to interpretation of
seismic attributes as an area of great
promise but one “still very much in its
infancy.”
Attributes can be basic signal parameters such as frequency, amplitude,
or phase—or any other measurable
qualities within a volume of seismic
data that enable interpreters to compare
traces with one another, looking for
patterns and discontinuities. Traces are
the lines on seismic records on which
wiggles indicate sound reflections.
Hill says he didn’t fully appreciate
attribute interpretation until he edited a
book on the subject by Satinder Chopra
of Arcis Corp., Calgary, and Kurt Marfurt of the University of Oklahoma.

New oil shale leases also will contain diligence milestones that were not

lessees will be required to obtain state

and deploy infrastructure within 24
months, as well as submit quarterly
progress reports.
If an RD&D lease’s conversion

minimum of 10,000 b/d of commercial

These are among the conclusions
of a study released by the US Energy
Information Administration of the 6%
of the earth’s surface above the Arctic Circle that falls in eight countries:
Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden,
and the US.
The prospect of recovering 5,000 to
16,000 tcf of shale gas in more accessible geologic provinces could defer
Arctic development generally, although
growing European gas demand may be
a strong incentive for Russian Arctic gas
development, EIA concluded.
Large Arctic discoveries began at
Tazovskoye in Russia in 1962 and at
Prudhoe Bay in the US in 1967.
EIA tallied 61 large oil and gas
discoveries above the Arctic Circle in
four countries, 43 of them in Russia.
Fifteen of the 61 were found in the
1970s-80s and are undeveloped due to
the expense. Thirteen of the 15 are in
North America.
The US Geological Survey released
mean estimates in 2008 of an Arctic
undiscovered resource of 90 billion
bbl of oil, 44 billion bbl of natural gas
liquids, and 1,670 tcf of gas, 84% of
it offshore (OGJ, Aug. 4, 2008, p. 17).

T E R E S T
That study of 25 geologic provinces left
eight other provinces unassessed as being too minor.
The three largest Arctic provinces
account for 65% of the total resource,
and the top 10 for 93%. The high concentration might reflect that little if any
exploration has occurred in the lowestimate provinces. The Arctic resource
mix is judged to be 78% gas and NGL.
The estimates embody considerable
uncertainty, even for the two assessment units in the province judged to
hold the largest Arctic resource, the
West Siberian basin.
Eurasia has 63% of the Arctic resource base and North America 36%,
and the Eurasian base is 88% gas and
gas liquids while the North American
side has 65% of undiscovered Arctic oil.
Three North American provinces have
54% of the Arctic’s total undiscovered
oil resource: Arctic Alaska, the Amerasia basin just north of Canada, and the
East Greenland Rift.
Even without the shale gas proliferation, the Arctic presents imposing
development hurdles.
Denmark, Canada, Norway, Russia,
and the US have overlapping economic
sovereignty claims in Arctic waters.

Some claims stem from a 1982 United
Nations convention that permits countries to claim as much as 350 nautical
miles beyond the point where sea depth
exceeds 8,200 ft of water, EIA pointed
out.
Duplicate claims exist, for example,
between Denmark and Russia in the
Arctic Ocean, Norway and Russia in the
Barents Sea, and Canada and the US in
the Beaufort Sea.
Development impediments include
harsh weather, poor soil conditions, no
summer access, facilities damage and
supply hindrance from ice, long supply
lines, and higher worker inducements.
One study found Alaska North Slope
onshore development costs to be 1.5-2
times as expensive as a similar project
in Texas, but costs and risks can be
significantly greater due to long lead
times, lack of infrastructure, supply
chain delays, weather, and court challenges.
This suggests “that only the world’s
largest oil companies, mostly likely as
partners in joint venture projects, have
the financial, technical, and managerial strength” to tackle the Arctic, EIA
said. ✦

MMS conditionally approves Shell’s Beaufort Sea leases
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The US Minerals Management
Service approved Shell Offshore Inc.’s
exploration plan for two Beaufort Sea
leases with stringent conditions, the US
Department of the Interior agency said
on Oct. 19. Environmental groups immediately protested the action.
MMS said Shell obtained the two
leases during US Outer Continental
Shelf Lease Sales 195 and 202 in 2005
and 2007, which were part of the
2002-07 5-year leasing program. They
were not affected by the recent federal
court decision which sent the 2007-12
program back to MMS for additional
22

analysis under Section 18 of the OCS
Lands Act, MMS said.
It said that Shell plans initial activity
on the leases during the July-October
open water drilling season. Operations
would be conducted using the M/V
Frontier Discoverer, a modern drillship
retrofitted and ice reinforced for operations in arctic OCS waters, it said.
Shell also plans to take a midseason break beginning Aug. 25, 2010,
and remove the vessel from the area
to accommodate subsistence bowhead
whaling by the Alaska Native villages of
Kaktovik and Nuiqsut, MMS added. Activity may resume following the hunts
and run through Oct. 31, depending on
ice and weather, it said.

The company’s exploration plan also
will have to be consistent with Alaska’s
Coastal Zone Management Plan before
drilling can commence, according to
MMS. It also will need to obtain drilling permits from MMS, and meet US
Environmental Protection Agency air
and water quality rules and Marine
Mammal Protection Act requirements
of the US Fish and Wildlife Service and
National Marine Fisheries Service, MMS
said.
Shell’s plan is limited to the far western area of Camden Bay, including the
use of one drillship with one tending
ice management vessel, it indicated.

Eight environmental organizations,
including the Sierra Club and Earthjustice, protested the decision. “Once
again, MMS approved a drilling plan
without a full analysis of the potential
consequences,” said David Dickson, the
Alaska Wilderness League’s Western
Arctic & Oceans program director.
The plan would involve use of a
drillship “and an armada of support

ate industrial noise in the water while
emitting tons of pollutants into the air
and thousands of barrels of waste into
the water,” the groups said in a joint
statement.
The risk of an oil spill in the area’s
waters is high, yet there is no technology and very little capacity to clean a
spill up in icy Arctic conditions, they
added.
“The reality of offshore oil drilling is that accidents will happen, and
when oil spills in Arctic ice, there is

no cleaning it up,” said Chuck Clusen,
the Natural Resources Defense Council’s national parks and Alaska projects
director.
“A blow-out like the one that recently despoiled waters off the coast of
Australia would leave oil in the waters
off the coast of the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge for decades, killing
whales, seals, fish, and birds, and turning irreplaceable spawning and feeding
grounds into an ecological wasteland,”
he declared. ✦

Amended commodities
reform bill clears
House FS panel
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The US House Financial Services
Committee approved a bill on Oct.
15 that would regulate over-thecounter trades in commodity markets
for some—but not all—participants.
Energy producers and consumers using
commodity hedges to control prices apparently would be exempt.
The exemption was part of a
manager’s amendment offered by the
committee’s chairman, Barney Frank
(D-Mass.), which clarifies that the bill’s
marginal requirements would allow
use of noncash collateral for commodity hedges. Independent producers have
said that this is essential so they can
continue using their reserves instead
of cash. Airlines and other commercial
fuel customers also support an exemption.
The administration of US President
Barack Obama indicated earlier in the
week that it could support an exemption for such commercial commodities
traders after initially opposing it. Top
officials at the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the US
Securities and Exchange Commission,
which would be jointly responsible for
enforcing any new OTC commodities
regulations, apparently remain uncomfortable with it.

The categorical
exclusion target

A

2005 National Energy Policy Act
(NEPACT) provision designed
to facilitate onshore drilling permit
processing remains a target of advocates for far-reaching US oil and gas
leasing reforms.
NEPACT’s Section 390 authorizes
the US Bureau of Land Management’s
use of categorical exclusions (CXs) to
streamline environmental analysis of
onshore drilling permit applications
in certain instances. Congressional
and other critics charge that it has
been used to bypass the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).
They point to a Sept. 15 Government Accountability Office report
that found BLM’s use of the provision
“has frequently been out of compliance with both the law and BLM’s
guidance.”
It noted violations that included
approving more than one well under
a single decision document, approving projects inconsistent with the
law’s criteria, and drilling a new well
after time frames had elapsed.
GAO also found cases, in 85%
of the BLM field offices it studied, where officials did not follow
guidance, most often by failing to
adequately justify a CX’s use.

The Energy and Commerce Committee’s Energy and Environment Subcommittee approved HR 2868, the Chemical Security Anti-Terrorism Act of 2009,

If it becomes law, the measure
would give the secretary of the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
authority to designate a chemical as a
“substance of concern” and set limits
on how much of such substances could
be used, stored, processed, manufactured, or distributed at a regulated
installation. Risk-based regulated tiers
would be assigned for each covered
site, which would be notified within
60 days of its designation or any change
in it.
The DHS secretary also would have
to develop regulations establishing
risk-based and performance-based
standards, protocols, and procedures
for mandatory security vulnerability assessments (SVAs) and site security plans
(SSPs) and set deadlines by tier for
completing both. The secretary would
approve or disapprove SVAs and SSPs
within 180 days of their submission.
Covered plants would have to review
and resubmit SVAs and SSPs at least
every 5 years.
The bill also would establish an Office of Chemical Security, and require
covered plants to establish security
background checks for employees
and others with access to the plant’s
restricted areas.

‘Making a mistake’
The measure drew fire from the full
committee’s ranking minority member. “I think we’re making a mistake. I
think we’re making significant changes
to a chemical facility security program
that’s not even been fully implemented
yet,” said Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.) as
markup of the bill began before the
vote. “I think we should wait until it
is implemented before we decide to
change it.”
Chemical security applies to a
broad swath of the US economy, from
hospitals to farms to factories as well
as chemical plants, Barton said, adding, “We should at least identify and
understand the problem we are trying
to fix before we rush head-long into
legislation. We seem to be approaching
this from the perspective of crafting a

solution in search of a problem.”
In a statement following the vote,
National Petrochemical & Refiners Association Pres. Charles T. Drevna also
noted that current federal chemical facility antiterrorism standards still are in
the process of being implemented and
should at least have the opportunity to
take effect before changes are made.
NPRA also believes mandating an
“inherently safer technology” (IST)
program for facilities in the two highest tiers, as the legislation proposes,
is unnecessary, he added. “IST is an
engineering philosophy, not a technique, nor is it a panacea for security.

Forced chemical switching under an
IST mandate will not necessarily result
in safer operations, and in fact, may result in increased risks to facilities, their
employees, the public, and the environment,” Drevna said.
Increased regulatory and financial
burdens under an IST mandate would
likely cause many petrochemical and
refining businesses to consider simply moving their operations overseas,
he warned. “Unfortunately, this bill
appears to be nothing more than an
attempt to further a partisan environmental agenda in the name of security,”
he said. ✦

Whodunit
in Georgia?

A

s if the oil and gas industry
didn’t already have enough
problems on its hands, bombers
struck a train in Georgia this week
and reawakened memories of the
conflict that occurred there just over
a year ago.
“According to preliminary
information, TNT was used in the
explosion,” said Georgian Railway
spokeswoman Irma Stepnadze, who
confirmed no one was injured in the
blast, which damaged 100 m of track
and overturned 16 tanker cars.
The explosion took place on the
rail line between Senaki and Georgia’s Black Sea port of Poti, a major
center of oil exports. Stepnadze said
repair work was under way, but it
was unclear when traffic on the line
would resume.
The cause of the explosion was

Europe as an important segment of

are especially painful for Georgia
since its rail network is essential for
transporting oil.
“Georgia owes much of its foreign
direct investments to the fact that
it has become a vital oil and gas
transport corridor,” said IHS Global
Insight, which added that attacks
have also been staged against the
Baku-Tblisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline.

Maximum damage

“It is clear from the repeated attacks to essential infrastructure that
the instigators of these acts are interested in causing maximum economic
damage to the country rather than
human casualties,” IHS Global Insight
said.
According to the analyst, the
Georgian government has yet to
present evidence to support the allegation that the Abkhazians from
the breakaway region in the northwestern part of the country, close
to Senaki, are responsible for the
attacks.

“Those contracts stipulate that
Gazprom give priority to the three
firms once it obtains the development
rights to the project and decides to seek
cooperation with foreign businesses,”
he said.
Regarding disagreements over where
to send output from Sakhalin-1, Medvedev said the Russian government,
under its industrial development plans
for the Far East and eastern Siberia,
has clearly stated natural gas from the
Sakhalin-1 project will be supplied to
the domestic market.
“Sakhalin-1 shareholders are calling for the output to be exported to
China, but we cannot agree with such a
move,” he said, referring to ExxonMobil, Itochu Corp., and Marubeni Corp.
“We will likely consider exporting LNG
to China and South Korea from other
gas fields in eastern Siberia,” he said.
When asked about the disruption
of gas supplies from Russia to Europe
early this year, Medvedev said it was
caused by a domestic political conflict
in Ukraine and that there should be no
concern for markets in Asia Pacific.
“We can promise that we will be
able to fulfill our gas supply contracts
for the Asia-Pacific region. We only
have economic motives. We have never
intended and will never intend to use
gas supplies as a political tool,” he
said. ✦

said the reduction will cut investment
requirements.
“We will save approximately $110
million of previously required regulatory capital costs versus our initial $150
million estimate,” Clifton said. “We
also expect the integrated facility will
reduce expected capital expenditures
for forthcoming reduced benzene in
gasoline requirements from approximately $30 million for the Holly facility
alone to approximately $15 million for
the integrated complex.”
Holly will pay $54.5 million in cash
and $74 million in common stock for
the refinery and about 2.3 million bbl
of storage. It also will purchase the refinery’s inventory of about 500,000 bbl
at market value at the time of closing.
Holly will agree at closing to provide
as much as 50,000 b/d of gasoline and
diesel fuel to Sinclair’s Midwest marketing network.
Holly Energy Partners, a midstream
master limited partnership of which
Holly Corp. owns 41%, will buy an
additional 1.4 million of storage at Sinclair’s Tulsa refinery as well as various
loading racks and related facilities.
Holly expects to enter into a long-

T E R E S T
term agreement with the partnership for storage, loading, and delivery
services.

The refineries
The company said Sinclair has invested more than $300 million in the
past 5 years to enable the Tulsa refinery
to meet low-sulfur gasoline standards
and to produce 100% ultralow-sulfur
diesel. Holly expects to invest $16
million to finish emission-reduction
projects in progress.
Integration will allow Holly to
charge gas oil from its existing Tulsa
refinery to the fluid catalytic cracking
unit at the refinery it’s buying from
Sinclair to produce gasoline and diesel.
The company will use a desulfurizer at
the Sinclair refinery for diesel from its
existing refinery.
Holly expects about half the diesel
from the combined facility to meet
ultralow-sulfur standards. It plans to
invest $10 million over the next 2 years
to expand the Sinclair refinery’s desulfurization capacity in a project that will
raise the complex’s yield of ultralowsulfur diesel to 100%.
Holly also expects to invest $30 mil-

lion to add sulfur recovery capacity and
to expand the flare gas recovery system
at its existing Tulsa refinery.
Clifton said crude capacity of the
integrated refinery could be expanded
“through relatively modest capital expenditures if future market conditions
and economics warrant.”
According to Oil & Gas Journal’s
2008 Worldwide Refining Survey,
capacity of the Sinclair refinery’s fluid
catalytic cracking unit is 16,200 b/cd.
Other capacities include 10,800 b/cd
of catalytic reforming, 2,700 b/cd of
sulfuric acid alkylation, and 5,400 b/cd
of pentane-hexane isomerization.
The refinery Holly purchased from
Sunoco has processing capacities of
8,500 b/cd of delayed coking, 17,500 b/
cd of catalytic reforming, and 24,000
b/cd of catalytic hydrotreating. It also
has 8,500 b/cd of lubes capacity. Holly,
Dallas, also operates a 100,000-b/sd
refinery in Artesia, NM, and a 31,000b/sd refinery in Woods Cross, Utah.
Sinclair operates two refineries
in Wyoming, one near Rawlins with
crude capacity listed in OGJ’s survey at

to take a great interest in this topic in
the months ahead.”
The committee’s ranking minority
member, Lisa Murkowski (R-Alas.), said
it will be important to make certain
climate change legislation does not endanger a domestic economic recovery.
“The proposals before us will affect not
only climate change, but every facet of
our economy for decades to come,” she
maintained. “It’s incredibly difficult to
conduct a sensitive and comprehensive
analysis of climate change bills, but it’s
equally important to know how those
bills might work and what they may
cost.”
Four federal analysts testified at the
hearing: Douglas W. Elmendorf, director of the Congressional Budget Office;
Richard G. Newell, US Energy Information Administration administrator;
Reid P. Harvey, a branch chief within
the EPA’s climate economics division;
and Larry Parker, of the Congressional
Research Service.
Addressing climate change could
entail substantial costs domestically
since the US accounts for roughly 20%
of total global carbon dioxide emissions, Elmendorf said in his written
testimony. “Achieving such reductions
would probably involve transforming
the US economy from one that runs
on CO2-emitting fossil fuels to one that
increasingly relies on nuclear and renewable fuels, accomplishing substantial improvements in energy efficiency,
or implementing the large-scale capture
and storage of CO2 emissions,” he said.
Climate legislation also would
permanently shift production and
employment away from industries
which produce carbon-based energy
and energy-intensive goods and toward
alternative energy sources, goods, and
services, Elmendorf said. “While those
shifts occurred, total employment would
probably be reduced a little compared
with what it would have been without
a comparably stringent policy to reduce
carbon emissions because labor markets
would most likely not adjust as quickly
as would the composition of demand for
different outputs,” he indicated.

Aspects of HR 2454
Other witnesses discussed studies of
HR 2454 since its passage. Newell said
EIA found carbon capture and storage
and other key technologies for reducing emissions face a variety of technical
challenges and, in some cases, additional questions regarding their widespread
deployment.
“EIA’s results also suggest that the
free allocation of allowances to electricity and natural gas distributors
significantly lowers direct impacts on
consumer electricity and natural gas
prices prior to 2025, when it starts to
be phased out,” he continued. “While
this result may serve goals related to
regional and overall fairness of the
program, the overall efficiency of the
cap-and-trade program is reduced to
the extent that the price signal that
would encourage cost-effective changes
by consumers in their use of electricity
and natural gas is delayed.”
Harvey said in his written testimony
that EPA’s analysis of HR 2454 and
related Senate bills indicates cumulative reductions over several decades
affect overall costs more than a particular year’s cap level. “Because HR
2454 allows emissions allowances to be
banked over time, its 2050 cap (an 83%

reduction from 2005 levels by 2050)
drives overall behavior and encourages
banking in the early years of the capand-trade program,” he observed.
“In other words, just changing the
2020 cap alone does not have a significant effect on total costs if all else
stays the same. Costs will be lower the
sooner we start acting, but a national
commitment to meeting these long-run
emission targets is key,” Harvey said.
Parker said the ultimate costs of
HR 2454 would be determined by the
economic response to the bill’s technical challenges, that the distribution of
allowance value (either through free
allocations or auction revenue) would
determine who bears much of the program’s costs, and that the availability of
offsets, especially international allowances, will be significant.
“The interplay between nuclear
power, renewables, natural gas, and
coal-fired capacity with carbon capture
and storage among the cases emphasizes the need for a low-carbon source
of electric generating capacity in the
mid-to-long term,” he continued. “A
considerable amount of low-carbon
generation will have to be built under
HR 2454 to meet the reduction requirement.” ✦

NGSA: Economic recovery biggest
variable in winter fuel outlook
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The strength and pace of an economic recovery could be the single
biggest variable in natural gas demand
this winter heating season, the Natural
Gas Supply Association said as it issued
its annual forecast.
“This winter, we expect the state
of the economy to potentially be the
dominant factor affecting natural gas
demand,” said NGSA Chairman Patrick
J. Kuntz, who also is vice-president of

natural gas and crude oil sales at Marathon Oil Corp. in Houston.
“Winter weather remains important, but the strength and pace of any
economic recovery could be even more
significant this year,” Kuntz said.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted
near-normal to slightly warmerthan-normal winter temperatures in
the coming months, he said. NGSA
expects neutral pressure on gas prices

demand, and production, which has

remained relatively steady despite
dramatically reduced drilling activity,
Kuntz said.
NGSA anticipates that any economic
recovery in the US in the next few
months will be fragile, Kuntz told reporters at a briefing. “Unemployment is
the looming question mark. Compared
to last winter, however, we expect the
economy to exert modest upward pressure on gas demand,” he said.

Demand outlook
Citing data supplied by Energy
Ventures Analysis Inc., NGSA said it
expects US gas demand to reach 75.2
bcfd this winter, slightly less than the
75.6 bcfd that was reached a year ago.
It anticipates that demand will decline
by 0.5%, compared with the 1.7% drop
during the 2008-09 winter heating
season, while annual electric power
generation additions will total 6.8 Gw
compared with 7.3 Gw a year earlier.
The forecast anticipates that industrial gas demand will increase slightly,

levels of about 2 bcfd of gas substituting for coal this past winter so it’s still
significant,” Kuntz said.
“A relatively mild summer in some
parts of the country, combined with
production which remained steady,
has led to record storage,” Kuntz said.
“It’s going to be an overhang, putting
downward pressure on the markets this
winter.” NGSA expects storage heading into the heating season to reach
3,822 bcf, compared with 3,412 bcf a
year earlier. New storage capacity could
reach 123 bcf this winter, up from 82
bcf in the 2008-09 heating season, its
forecast said.
Kuntz said US gas producers have
responded to reduced demand by
curtailing their drilling substantially.
NGSA’s latest forecast calls for annual
well completions to fall to 18,800 this
winter from 30,591 in 2008-09, and

production to average 55.7 bcfd this
winter, up slightly from 55 bcfd a year
ago, however.

Shale gas impact
“In spite of lower rig counts and
fewer wells being drilled, shale gas
activity has kept production relatively
steady,” Kuntz explained. “Horizontal
drilling is helping recover resources
which were ignored 10 years ago.
We’re seeing a fairly wide variation in
forecasts for production this winter.
Everyone is trying to get their arms
around what’s going on in shale plays
relative to well completions and rig
counts.”
Access is less of an issue than it has
been in previous years, he conceded.

“It has slipped a notch or two as part
of the message, but it’s still an issue.
I don’t want to consciously take away
from this country the ability to find
resources, either offshore or onshore.
State regulations are increasingly important,” he said.
Growing shale gas production could
revolutionize the domestic industry
since it is geographically diverse and
could make the country less reliant on
Gulf Coast and Gulf of Mexico supplies,
which are vulnerable to hurricanes,
Kuntz said. “We don’t know if and
when a pricing environment can affect
shale gas production. I have to believe
it can’t be ignored. But the long-term
prospects for shale gas development are
good,” he said. ✦

Economic uncertainty, volatile oil
and gas prices, and frozen capital markets, combined with growing reservoir
complexity, are having a significant
effect on oil and gas exploration and
development, causing a renewed focus
on managing risk and reducing costs.
Restricted access to locations, environmental sensitivities, high drilling costs, and problematic production
options are all driving the demand
for new technologies that increase the
probability of success in discovering,
delineating, and developing oil and gas
reservoirs. At the same time, companies
must effectively reduce costs through
efficient project execution.
One such technology that addresses
this industry need is low frequency
(LF) seismic, the spectral analysis of the
natural seismic wavefield of the earth
between 0.1 and 10 Hz. The methodology uses very sensitive broadband
seismometers—not the standard 3C
geophones—to directly acquire the
earth’s low frequency (<10 Hz) seismic background data (Fig. 1). Each
instrument station includes a portable,

Based on the work of the British mathematician Thomas Bayes in
the 18th century, Bayesian inference
has applications in industrial quality
control to discard faulty (vs. nonfaulty)
products from a conveyor belt and
is being used in both upstream and
downstream oil and gas applications.
In LF seismic surveys, the Bayesian
methodology captures basic empirical relationships between recorded LF
seismic data and the subsurface properties, represented as statistical probability distributions, accounting for both
uncertainty and variability (Fig. 3).

Hydrocarbon likelihood
As Fig. 3 demonstrates, an LF survey
over a field in Texas was conducted to
identify areas with increased prospectivity.
As a first step, a small set of receivers, representative for hydrocarbon
(HC) and nonhydrocarbon (NHC)
areas, is selected. The attributes of these
sets are used to construct HC (green)
and NHC (blue) Probability Density
Functions (PDFs) over the two-dimensional space shown. In a Bayesian
approach, receivers in new areas are

moval of anthropogenic or man-made
noise sources are necessary prerequisites for the analysis of LF seismic data,
acquired passively at the surface.
In the context of anthropogenic
noise contamination, the European
survey presented a worst case scenario
with various sources of noise crisscrossing the survey area. The northern
line ran through an industrial quarter
and crossed a much-used waterway,
while the southern line ran across highways with high traffic volumes.
Fig. 4 shows the average daytime and
nighttime noise spectra in the survey
area in comparison to the New Global
Noise Model. The arrow in Fig. 4 denotes machinery noise at 2.083 Hz.
Intensive data analysis was required
to identify and separate various types of
anthropogenic noise from the records
in order to isolate the signals due to the
uncontaminated seismic background
wave field. For LF seismic signal analysis, anthropogenic noise can generally
be categorized as two source types: (i)
broadband transient signals, created
by traffic, fauna, explosions, or falling
objects, and (ii) stationary sources of
narrow bandwidth, created by machinery, running water, or the structural
resonances of buildings or bridges.
Transient noise was the most abundant in the European data and was
filtered out by a statistical approach.

Spectraseis calculated spectrograms using 40-sec time windows with a 20-sec
overlap. Fig. 5 demonstrates the removal of transient cultural noise, and Fig.
5a shows the nighttime spectrogram of
station 17 before (top) and after (bottom) the muting of transient noise.
For each spectrum representing a
40-sec period, the average power spectral density (PSD) was calculated over a
specified frequency band. For each frequency band, the power spectral densities of all periods were then arranged
in a histogram. In Fig. 5b, the spectral
variance is dominated by transient
noise. After data conditioning (bottom), the variance is reduced and the
stationary background noise emerges as
the lower end member of the spectral
variance. Colors denote frequency of
occurrence of the respective PSD level.
A bimodal distribution was observed
in the histogram, with the higher mode
attributed to time periods of transient
noise contamination, and the lower
mode representing the desired, uncontaminated background.
Transient noise was then removed
by “muting” the data in all time periods above a fixed, threshold level in
the histogram. For quality control, the
spectral variance was examined over
the selected time period (Fig. 5c). Fig.
5c is a histogram of average spectral
levels between 0.1 and 10 Hz show-

transient noise contamination. Removing the higher mode of the distribution
effectively mutes transients in the data
(as compared with Fig. 5a).
An overall reduction in spectral
variance was observed and convergence
was obtained for the average to the
lower level in the histogram, which
represented the natural background
level, plus stationary noise.
In addition, a frequency-domain
despiking algorithm was developed that
removes narrow-banded peaks created
by stationary noise.
Two attributes were calculated from
the clean, despiked data with transients
removed. These attributes were used
for the quantification of: (i) integration
of the Power Spectral Density (PSD)
spectrum of the vertical component,
over a data driven frequency band, and
(ii) integration of the spectral ratio of
the vertical and horizontal components
(called V/H). The V/H attribute is more
robust with respect to transient noise
contamination and was the attribute of
choice for this survey due to the urban
setting.
Spectraseis observed a statistically
significant increase in the spectral
ratio of V/H, between 1.5 and 3.5 Hz,
over the reservoir. Because the lateral
variation of attribute values in the
anomalous region is larger than the

standard deviation, it can be concluded
that the observed anomaly is statistically significant. Furthermore, a check
of the near surface statics revealed that
the observed, anomalous V/H ratio
could not be attributed to site effects or
noise in the shallow subsurface. It was
therefore concluded that observations
made from the LF seismic data are in
fact, an expression of the earth’s modified, background seismic wavefield that
is directly related to the fluids in the
reservoir structure.
In this survey, careful identification
and removal of anthropogenic noise
sources from the LF seismic data were
achieved.

Hiking exploration confidence
LF seismic technology remains a
work in progress.
Spectraseis, in close collaboration
with the Swiss Federal Institute of
Technology (ETH Zurich), is spearheading the industry’s biggest research
program focused on the theory, methods, and applications of low frequency
spectral analysis.
Through new innovations such as
the introduction of Bayesian statistics,
the ability to reduce man-made noise,
developments in time reverse modeling (TRM) for depth imaging, and
the capability to carry out surveys in
environmentally sensitive locations, LF
seismic is becoming a powerful and
cost-effective derisking tool. LF seismic
is today a tool with applications across
the entire reservoir lifecycle, from
exploration bid rounds, to exploration
and delineation, through to prospect
ranking and development.
Conventional oil and gas has become
harder to find and produce economically, leading to an increase in exploration for, and development of unconventional reserves. Due to the geological
complexity and expensive production
methods typically found with unconventional reserve plays, the growth
of independents, the number of “less
giant” but potentially economic fields,
and operators’ relentless focus on reducing costs while managing risks, the

emergence of LF seismic technology
could not have been more timely.

Low-btu gas

Pipeline specifications for natural
gas in the US vary, but a heat content
of 950 btu/cu ft is required for sale
and transport. US reserves of natural
gas are about 238 tcf.2 “Subquality” gas
may constitute as much as 17.5 tcf of
reserves in the Midcontinent, 9 tcf in
the Rocky Mountain region,3 and 60 tcf
in the US.4
Overall, 33% of the 1,253 gas
analyses5 recorded in Kansas in the
last 50 years are low-btu (<950 btu/cu
ft). Low-btu gas is more common in
Permian and Upper Pennsylvanian reservoirs in Kansas,
but it is found in
reservoirs of all ages
and lithologies.5 In
the Midcontinent,
the presence of N26

often results in
natural gas being low-btu, while

due to N2 contamination. Thus, N2 is
a major target for

(Mehra process),16 but such economyof-scale is not feasible for smaller and
often isolated fields.
A significant portion of N2-induced
low-btu gas is found in modest to small
fields that are owned and operated
by small independent producers.4 At
present, most of this low-btu gas is
either shut-in behind pipe or simply
abandoned because it cannot be burned
locally or blended with readily available
higher-btu gas.
Development of inexpensive N2rejection technology, designed for lowvolume, low-pressure gas wells, can
significantly increase the contribution
of marginal low-btu gas to the nation’s
gas supply.

NRU process
Pressure swing adsorption is a proven commercial technique that is widely
used in many industries to separate
gases by use of an adsorbent bed. This
bed selectively adsorbs one or more
components from the feed gas under
pressure while allowing other components to pass through unadsorbed. The
adsorbed components are then recovered by reduction of pressure on the
bed, and the reactivated bed reused for
adsorption in the next cycle.
The demonstration NRU discussed
here uses the process of vacuum swing
adsorption,17 a variation of PSA in
which the bed is desorbed under subatmospheric pressure (i.e., vacuum). The
NRU uses readily available and nonpatented activated carbon (made from

coconut husks) as an adsorbent bed to
adsorb methane and heavier hydrocarbons under pressure while rejecting the
entrained N2 as a vent stream.
Adsorbent beds vary between PSA
plants. Some, as the NRU discussed
here, have fixed pore openings (as in
activated carbon or molecular sieve),
while others have custom-designed
pore openings (as in molecular gate) to
trap targeted gas molecules.
In general, PSA processes differ by
the number of towers and the number
of stages in each tower required to
separate the feed hydrocarbons from
the entrained N2.
This NRU has two towers and uses
three stages:
1. Adsorption under pressure.
2. Venting to 2 psig.

*Feed gas charges up the evacuated Tower 1 to set pressure (20-75 psi), depending on plant settings determined by feed-gas quality, while Tower 2 is evacuated to vacuum (22-28 in. Hg).

3. Desorption under vacuum.
Between the adsorption and desorption stages, many PSA systems employ
the product (upgraded) gas to purge
each tower of residual unadsorbed
gas. Instead of this purge stage, which
complicates plant controls and increases
compression costs, the demonstration
NRU vents the unadsorbed gas from
each tower at the end of adsorption.
The degree of separation13 achieved in
PSA process depends on feed-gas composition, charge and vent pressure, and
system temperature.
The NRU was designed to have the
following characteristics:
• Nonpatented processes and
off-the-shelf equipment to minimize
construction costs.
• Easily obtained adsorbent bed of
inexpensive, non-patented activated
carbon.
• Skid-mounted modular units that
provide mobility and scalability.
• Small environmental footprint (≈
400 sq ft).
46

• Few moving parts (outside engine
and compressor) to minimize maintenance costs.
• Powered by solar panels and lowbtu feed gas for operations at remote
locations outside electric grid.

NRU layout
Fig. 1 shows the compact layout of
the NRU.18 Feed gas enters the plant
through a 2-in. line, passes through
a scrubber for removal of entrained
moisture, and then passes through a
flow meter into the adsorption/desorption towers. Each tower, made of
carbon steel, has a 48-in. diameter, is
8 ft tall, and is designed to handle feed
rates of around 100 Mcfd.
The modular design allows additional sets of towers to be added or
removed to handle increases or decreases in feed volumes. Electronically
controlled solenoid valves allow feed
gas to flow into one tower for adsorption while isolating the other tower
for desorption under vacuum. A small

fraction of the N2-rich vent (waste) gas
is used as instrument gas to operate the
pneumatics of the control panel.
Ports at the base of each tower
provide access for removal of spent bed
materials and tower cleanup. Off-theshelf activated carbon made from coconut husks (Fig. 2a) was used to charge
the towers (Figs. 2b and 2c). Each tower
was charged with about 2,200 lb of this
material, purchased in 1,100-lb bags at
a cost of 7¢/lb.
A 6-cyclinder, 50-hp VGG-330
engine (Fig. 1), operating on the lowbtu feed gas, drives the compressor,
designed for vacuum service, which
pulls a vacuum on each tower during
its desorption cycle. Desorbed methane flows through a 2-in. line to a gas
scrubber and then to the compressor
via a 3-in. line. N2-rich vent gas from
each tower travels to a flare tower by a
2-in. line. The compressed (upgraded)
gas passes through a condensateremoval tower (Fig. 1) before flowing
into a surge tank (5 ft diameter and

*Tower 1 is vented to 2 psi after having been charged to set pressure, thus allowing removal of N2-rich unadsorbed gas from tower. This venting results in some loss of CH4 but also prevents the

Anticipating a maximum operating

check for leaks. Thereafter, it was tested

NRU performance
Feed gas (average: 715 btu/cu ft and
C2H6+/CH4+ ≈ 7.9%) consisted of commingled production from several wells,
some of which produced slugs of water
along with gas. These conditions, along
with valve adjustment at the upstream
central manifold to maintain minimum flow rates and pressures, resulted
in variation in feed-gas composition.
It is not uncommon for the feed-gas
composition to fluctuate under real-life
operating conditions of marginal gas
wells.
During initial testing, the feed gas
averaged around 687 btu/cu ft. Under
this condition, the plant was optimized
to produce pipeline quality gas (>950
btu/cu ft) by charging the towers to 34

psig, then venting unadsorbed N2-rich
gas (from the top) to 2 psig, followed
by vacuum desorption (25 in. mercury).
These settings (Table 1) resulted in
a sales/feed ratio of 0.54 (i.e., 54% of
the low-btu feed gas by volume was upgraded to pipeline quality). Thus a feed
gas with 63% average hydrocarbon
content (CH4+ % mole) was upgraded
to a product stream containing around
84% hydrocarbon content resulting in
73.2% of hydrocarbon recovery and
75.7 % of btu recovery.
The btu recovery is calculated as the
ratio of the product of total btu coming
into the plant (i.e., feed volume times
feed btu/cu ft) to that recovered in the
sales stream (i.e., sales volume times
sales btu/cu ft). Under these settings,
the vented gas contained about 63.1%
N2 (% mole) resulting in an average N2
rejection efficiency of 76.7%.
The sales/feed ratio critically determines the plant economics. Given
similar feed compositions, higher sales/
48

feed ratios result in greater recovery of
the hydrocarbons and higher volumes
of pipeline-quality gas for sale.
Given unchanging feed composition and bed adsorption characteristics,
the sales/feed ratio depends on the
differential between the tower charge
pressure (34 psig, as stated earlier) and
the vent pressure (2 psig), the dead
volume within each tower, and volume
of gas desorbed from the beds during
the venting process.
Variation in feed composition imparted some uncertainty to optimization of plant settings. For example, the
pressure differential between tower
charge pressure and vent pressure was
reduced to 20 psig and 2 psig, respectively, to increase the sales/feed ratio.
By the time the plant could be operated
under lower tower charge pressure,
however, the feed-gas composition
changed to an average of 743 btu/cu ft.
The plant produced pipeline-quality gas
(964 btu/cu ft) at a higher sales/feed
ratio of 0.60 (Table 1).

It was difficult to determine, however, if the lower tower charge pressure
resulted in slightly higher CH4 recovery
efficiencies (75.4%) and slightly lower
N2 stripping efficiency (72.6%), or if
these were caused by improved feedgas quality.
Later in the optimization process,
the plant was connected to a different
combination of wells resulting in a feed
with poorer average heat content (622
btu/cu ft vs. 715 btu/cu ft). Also, the
ratio of the heavy hydrocarbon fraction
(C2H6+/CH4+) decreasing to 3.8% from
7.9% necessitated higher tower charge
pressures to produce pipeline-quality
gas. The variation in feed btu content
was less than 5% during this plant optimization study (Table 2).
When the plant was run with tower
charge pressures of 15 and 30 psig and
vent pressure of 2 psig (i.e., settings
close to that necessary to upgrade feed
averaging 715 btu/cu ft with a heavy
hydrocarbon fraction ≈ 7.9%), the
product gas was of subpipeline quality,

i.e., 831 and 881 btu/cu ft, respectively.
Raising the tower charge pressure to 70
and 66 psig, followed by venting to 13
and 9.5 psig, increased the heat content
of the desorbed gas to around 920 btu/
cu ft but also resulted in lower sales/
feed ratios, i.e., 45% and 49%, respectively.
Higher tower charge pressures result
in greater pressure differential during
the vent process and therefore greater
loss of hydrocarbons and lower sales/
feed ratios.
In the current tower design (Fig. 6a),
the grate supporting the adsorption bed
was incorrectly designed to be located
above the tower access hole resulting
in 20 in. of dead volume at the bottom
of each (8-ft) tower. This dead volume
is not filled with any activated carbon,
and N2-rich low-btu gas (at 2 psig)
occupies the dead volume at the end of
the vent phase when venting is taking
place solely from the tower top.
During the desorption stage, this
low-btu gas in the dead volume entered
the surge tank and lowered the btu of
the product (sales) gas. To remediate
the problem, attempts were made to
50

see if simultaneous venting from both
the top and bottom of the tower would
help better vent the residual unadsorbed N2-rich gas.
This replumbing met with some
success; the product gas was of pipeline quality (at 958 btu/cu ft) when
the tower charge pressure was set at 69
psig and vent pressure to 3 psig. This
setting resulted in a sales/feed ratio of
0.39. The sales/feed ratio was improved
slightly to 0.40 when the tower charge
pressure was set to 72 psig and the vent
pressure was set at 4 psig.
It is apparent from these results that
this NRU can upgrade a feed gas with
heat content as low as 633 btu/cu ft and
a heavy hydrocarbon fraction around
3.8%. It is critical to note that both the
heat content and the amount of heavy
hydrocarbons in the feed stream dictate
the optimum operational settings for
the plant to attain pipeline-quality sales
gas. Any deterioration in the quality
of the feed will require towers to be
charged to higher pressures resulting in
higher pressure differentials during the
venting process, in greater volumes of
gas lost, and in lower sales/feed ratios.

Also, poor quality feed gas has lower
amounts of hydrocarbons to recover
and thus will naturally result in lower
sales/feed ratios. With the poorer
quality feed (at 633 btu/cu ft), the bturecovery (Table 2) efficiency decreased
to about 59% as compared with 75+%
obtained with a superior feed whose
heat content averaged 715 btu/cu ft.

Plant controls
Only two parameters, the tower
charge pressure and the vent pressure,
are critical to optimizing the plant for
upgrading a low-btu feed to pipeline
quality. Different combinations of
these two parameters must be tested
to determine the settings for obtaining
pipeline-quality product stream with
minimum hydrocarbon loss in the vent
stream.
A programmable logic controller
pneumatically opens and closes the
solenoid valves controlling the flow
of gas into and out of the two towers.
Charge and vent pressures (or times)
are input to the PLC for continuous operation monitored by a once-a-day visit
by the plant operator.

The following guidelines will help
optimize plant settings due to changes
in feed-gas composition:
• If the feed btu and heavy hydrocarbon fraction increase, the towers
may be charged to lower pressures to
obtain pipeline-quality sales stream.
Sales/feed ratios tend to improve with
higher quality feed.
• If the feed btu and heavy hydrocarbon fraction decrease, the towers
may be charged to higher pressures to
upgrade to pipeline quality. Sales/feed
ratios will decrease with poorer feed
quality.
• With pipeline-quality product
stream attained by adjustment of the
charge pressure, the vent pressure may
be fine tuned to optimize the sales/feed
ratio.

Operational problems
During the initial testing period, the
sales/feed ratio would suddenly decline
despite minor variations in feed composition and unchanging operational

settings after a few days of operation.
Visual evidence of carbon particles being ejected from the vent tower during
each vent phase confirmed that bed
blowout was taking place.
This was caused by the absence of
any filter in the upper flange connecting the tower to the vent line and by
the pressure shock (release) of the venting process. With bed material being
blown out, the dead volume increased
at the top of each tower, resulting in
performance degradation.
Opening the flange atop each tower
allowed a visual check for bed blowout
and revealed that each tower had lost
about 18 in. of bed from the top of the
column (Fig. 6a). This problem was
solved after the towers were topped off
with fresh activated carbon (Fig. 6b)
and an appropriately sized screen filter
was set below the upper flange.
It was also discovered that the
bottleneck affecting the NRU sales (volume) throughput is primarily the time
taken to desorb a tower from vent pres-

sure (≈ 2 psig) to 22-25 in. mercury.
The tower evacuation time depends
on the tower (or bed) volume and the
compressor capacity and is normally
longer than the tower charge-up time
given sufficient pressure and rate in
the feed line. Thus, the tower charging
process often had to be slowed to make
the charge time equal to the evacuation
time for continuous operation.
One important lesson learned from
this project is that a strong compressor,
capable of evacuating the tower (volume) as quickly as possible, should be
employed to reduce process cycle time
and increase plant throughput.

Heavy HC adsorption
A mass balance of the heavy hydrocarbons (C2H6+) conducted on the
feed and respective upgraded sales gas
showed that about 98% of the heavy
hydrocarbons entrained in the feed
were recovered in the product stream.
The bed of activated carbon was therefore efficient in capturing the incoming

heavy hydrocarbons and the desorption
process was equally effective in recovering the heavy hydrocarbons.
Methane was less efficiently captured—only 58-68% of methane in the
feed gas was recovered, depending on
gas composition. The vent stream was
mostly made up of unadsorbed nitrogen and some methane, which limits
the feasibility of capturing and upgrading the vent gas to pipeline quality.

for installing a Subsea

SSGT technology mechanically connects an off-take fitting to an existing pressurized
pipeline, providing an alternative method of hot-tapping
into high and low-pressure

Applying the technique to marginal

JIP sponsors (BP, Total, and ConocoPhillips) supported conversion of the
technology for subsea use with the
vision of taking it to ultradeep diverless
applications.
Following completion of the JIP,
Subsea 7 carried out further testing on
the technology in test tanks and laboratories and conducted offshore trials in
June 2009, mobilizing a grout mixing
and injection skid, complete with test
tee assemblies, on its Seven Pelican
dive-support vessel. Divers conducted
installation and hookup once the skid
was deployed to the seabed.
Skid recovery followed grout injection into a test tee assembly and a 24-hr
grout curing period. A successful grout
quality test supported the technology’s
readiness state for subsea operations.

CBO: Climate bill
threatens oil and
gas employment
US oil and gas workers have extra
reason to find interesting the Congressional Budget Office’s confirmation that
cap-and-trade legislation passed by the
House of Representatives would diminish
employment.
A disproportionate number of job
losses would occur in their industry.
CBO Director Douglas W. Elmendorf
told the Senate Committee on Energy and

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

Natural Resources on Oct. 14 that a House
climate-change bill passed in June would
suppress economic growth and employment.
Pointing out losses against expectations without cap-and-trade would be
small relative to overall economic growth,
he nevertheless refuted claims that the
bill would do no damage at all. He said
implementation of the House bill would
lower gross domestic product from what it
otherwise would have been by 0.25-.75%
in 2020 and by 1-3.5% in 2050.
“CBO projects that real (inflationadjusted) GDP will be roughly two and a
half times as large in 2050 as it is today,
so those changes would be comparatively modest,” Elmendorf said in written
testimony. Aggregate loss of household
purchasing power would be 0.1% in 2012
and 0.8% in 2050, averaging 0.4% over
the entire period. The bill, Elmendorf
said, “would probably have only a small
effect on total employment in the long
run.” Because it would “shift production,
investment, and employment away from
industries involved in the production of
carbon-based energy and energy-intensive
goods and services,” however, oil and gas
workers can take no comfort.
“The industries that produce carbonbased energy—coal mining, oil and gas
extraction, and petroleum refining—would
probably suffer significant employment
losses over time,” the CBO chief warned.
Elmendorf didn’t focus any further on
refining, but job losses in that industry
might be extreme. The bill makes refiners
responsible for nearly half of all required
emission cuts but allocates to it a relatively tiny share of total emission allowances.
The costs would be huge.
Elmendorf pointed out that a cap-andtrade system would open career fields in
emerging energy industries.
Indeed, unofficial reports from the
field indicate that people who like being
outdoors and are comfortable with height
have no trouble finding work scraping bird
droppings off windmill blades.

Crude climbs to higher price range
On Oct. 14, the front-month crude contract closed above $75/bbl on the New
York Mercantile Exchange for the first time since the same date in 2008, ending a
long period when intraday prices were “neatly shoe-horned” into a precise $10/bbl
range. The next day, it traded as high as $77.97/bbl before closing at $77.58/bbl. “If
the dollar does not strengthen, crude will probably test $80 within the next week,”
predicted analysts at Pritchard Capital Partners LLC in New Orleans.
Benchmark NYMEX crude “first got within range of $75/bbl all the way back in
June,” said Paul Horsnell, managing director and head of commodities research
at Barclays Capital in London. “Barring a few days in early July when fears about
spare storage at Cushing, Okla., running out got somewhat overblown, it has been
$65 to $75 range trading all the way.” Now, he said, “For the first time in months,
the future exists.”
It won’t be a radical change from the market’s past performance, however—
more likely a transition to a new $70-80/bbl spread, with $70/bbl “perhaps starting
to seem more like the bottom of the range than the middle,” Horsnell said.
The price breakout occurred amid continued optimism that the economy is
recovering, even as the US dollar hit a 14-month low against the euro. On Oct. 14,
the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed above the 10,000 level for the first time
since early October 2008—the latest in a series of indications of a more robust
economy.
Yet industry analysts looked in vain for major improvements in supply and
demand fundamentals to support the oil price increase. Instead, the dollar index
appeared to be the main influence on crude prices. Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix,
Zug, Switzerland, expressed the outlook of many market observers when he said:
“Based on [supply and demand] fundamentals, we have no confidence at all in the
current oil rally.” The world economy was not able to digest crude prices above
$100/bbl in 2007, Jakob noted. “So we need to stay cautious before thinking it can
digest $80/bbl oil now,” he said.
Jakob said, “To be convinced that we are not in the middle of a dollar bubble
and that genuine recovery is behind the rise of the stock market and genuine oil
demand behind the rise of the oil markets, we would want to see both of them continuing their advance under a stable dollar. For now we have nothing but a falling
dollar and because of that we have to remain extremely cautious about the current
dynamics in equities and energy.”
Gas and winter
The Energy Information Administration reported the injection of 58 bcf of natural gas into US underground storage in the week ended Oct. 9. That boosted the
total working gas in storage above 3.7 tcf, approaching total capacity of 3.9 tcf with
3 weeks left in the gas-injection season. Storage was then 450 bcf higher than a
year ago and 474 bcf above the 5-year average. “While the next few injections may
appear bullish, we are experiencing a record cold mid-October and, with storage
almost full, continue to face storage constraints,” said analysts in the Houston office of Raymond James & Associates Inc.
Meanwhile, Joe Bastardi, chief meteorologist for AccuWeather.com, predicts a
fading El Nino will produce “the stormiest and coldest” winter in recent years over
an area from Maryland to the Carolinas.
“The areas that will be hit hardest this winter by cold, snowy weather will be
from southern New England through the Appalachians and mid-Atlantic, including the Carolinas,” he said in mid-October. Eastern Seaboard areas that had little
snowfall the past two winters should expect above-normal snowfall. New York,
Boston, and Philadelphia could get up to 75% of their total snowfall in “in two or
three big storms,” he said. Snowfall in some parts of the Appalachians could reach
50-100 in.
Bastardi expects the winter storm track to bring storms into southern California,
across the South, and up the Eastern Seaboard. That would differ from the last 2
years, when storms tracked farther west from Texas into the Great Lakes, bringing
unseasonably mild weather to major East Coast cities. In the South, the Interstate
20 corridor from Dallas to Atlanta will be “a strike zone for ice and snow,” Bastardi
said. “It is not out of the question that snow and ice are as far south as College Station and San Antonio, Tex.”

The View is Much Better
with 100 Levels
If your large seismic surveys are burdened by high costs, flawed data and lengthy acquisition times,
trust the new 100-level digital array SeisX service from Baker Hughes to deliver the fast, accurate
seismic data you need while lowering your operational costs.
SM

©2009 Baker Hughes Incorporated. All Rights Reserved. 26627.

Many multi-level seismic technologies still require repetitive shooting and multiple tool settings, which
can lead to inconsistent data, additional acquisition time and frustration. Our 100-level seismic array
uses superior data transmission rates and securely coupled tools to record the same shot at every
level, reducing acquisition time while delivering consistent, high-quality signals from shot to shot.
Wide aperture and large-fold coverage capabilities of the SeisX service – requirements for 3D VSPs
and walkaways – can now be achieved in one pass. Consistent SeisX signal acquisition across all
100 three-component receiver levels improves timing and wavefield separation to enhance data
migration, allowing operators to optimize well planning and streamline operations.

Take your seismic exploration to the highest level – select the SeisX service.

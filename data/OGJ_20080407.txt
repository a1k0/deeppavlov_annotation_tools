Yeah, cheap
imitations
make us
laugh, too.

There is only one.
Pretenders have tried to match the performance of our Tricone bits.
And why not? Hughes Christensen has defined the industry standard for
roller cone bits since, well, since we created the first one back in 1912.
Of course our commitment to improvement and the industry’s largest
R&E spend make Tricone a pretty tough act to follow. After all, there is
only one king.
Thank you…thankyouverymuch.

Semi-annual construction updates are provided in the following areas:
• Petrochemical
• Gas Processing

• Refining
• LNG

• Pipeline
• Sulfur

The Excel format enables efficient and rapid analysis of planned construction
projects. The data collected includes Company, Location, Capacity, Expected
Competition Date and Current Status, Contractor, Cost, Engineering and
Process Design (when available). Some of these surveys are also available
in historical version going back to 1996.

Production Projects
Worldwide
Major upstream mega-projects
throughout the world: location,
project name, peak year,
production volume, operator

Your ov
verfill alarm doesn’t howl very often.
Are you sure it’s alert??

Many conventional overfill alarm sensors you may choose for your storage tanks will have one major weakness:
You can never be absolutely sure that they still work after a long period of inactivity.
The Rosemount TankRadar® Rex gauge from Emerson offers a better solution. It provides continuous feedback to the
operator by checking the tank level four times per second.
Moreover, it is TÜV tested and approved for overfill protection according to the German WHG (Wasserhaushaltsgesetz) regulations. And, thanks to its highly reliable design, it has been found suitable for SIL 2 applications by third
party in accordance with IEC 61508/61511. There really isn’t a better gauge to protect your plant.

MMS issues production, royalty reporting rules
The US Minerals Management Service published on Mar. 26
amended final regulations for reporting production and royalties
of oil, gas, coal, and geothermal resources from federal and Native
American lands.
The new rules are designed to align the reports with current
MMS business practice, MMS said. They reflect changes implemented after the agency’s financial systems were largely reengineered in
2001, as well as other changes required by law, it said.
Among other changes, the new rules align regulations with updated reporting forms, eliminate references to forms and codes
that no longer apply, update other references, and move up the due
date for production reports submitted electronically.
They also clarify the requirement for reporting production inventory, eliminate references to some electronic reporting options
that no longer exist, and clarify the reporting requirement for taxpayer identification numbers, MMS said.
The new rules will take effect in 30 days, it said.

Alberta: ﬁrst oil sands reclamation certiﬁcate
The Alberta government presented its first oil sands reclamation
certificate to Syncrude Canada Ltd. for converting a 104-hectare
area known as Gateway Hill into forest and wetlands 35 km north
of Fort McMurray.
Syncrude began planting trees and shrubs in 1983 to create a
forest interspersed by several wetlands and a 4.5-km hiking trail.
The company is committed to overall sustainability, said Syncrude
Pres. and Chief Executive Officer Tom Katinas.
Under Alberta’s reclamation standards, companies must remediate and reclaim Alberta’s land so it can be productive again. Alberta
requires reclaimed land to be able to support a range of activities
similar to its previous use.
Alberta Environment Minister Rob Renner said it takes time to
confirm a successful reclamation. “Both operators and government
want to ensure that the reclamation is successful before a certificate
is granted.”
Typically, oil sands mining requires the use of land for several
decades. The reclamation process occurs throughout a project’s life,
and reclamation certification occurs when the land has been fully
reclaimed.
Overburden material removed during oil sands mining was
put on Gateway Hill. By the early 1980s, the area was no longer
needed, and Syncrude began replacing topsoil and planting trees
and shrubs.
Katinas said Syncrude reclaimed more than 80 additional hectares in 2007 and plans on reclaiming another 100 hectares this
year. In 2006 alone, the company reported spending $30.5 million
on reclamation activities.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Syncrude is a joint venture operated by Syncrude Canada Ltd.
and owned by Canadian Oil Sands Ltd., ConocoPhillips Oilsands
Partnership II, Imperial Oil Resources, Mocal Energy Ltd., Murphy
Oil Co. Ltd., Nexen Oil Sands Partnership, and Petro-Canada Oil &
Gas.

Colombia offers 43 blocks in licensing round
Colombia has invited operators to bid for 43 blocks in its latest
licensing round, with contracts expected to be signed with successful applicants by October.
The acreage, spanning over 7 million hectares, is in the natural
gas-prone Sinu North area; Cesar Rancheria area, which is also gas
prone and holds the potential for unconventional gas; Cordillera
area, a frontier province; and Crudos Pesados West, a heavy oil region.
Armando Zamora, director general of Colombia’s National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH), told delegates at the London roadshow
that 17 blocks were on offer in the heavy oil zone. “According to a
study by Halliburton, it is estimated to hold 20 billion bbl of oil in
place.” Seventeen fields have been discovered near the blocks and
three petroleum systems have been found in the basin.
About 122 wells have been drilled on the San Jacinto basin in
the Sinu North area with 17 wells in the Guajira basin in Cesar
Rancheria; four in the Eastern Cordillera basin, and 61 in the Llanos basin in Crudos Pesados West.
Separately, Colombia is offering operators the chance to develop
8 frontier heavy oil blocks in the East Llanos basin.
Colombia also is keen to attract small and medium-sized operators for its mini bidding round that will be launched shortly,
Zamora added. “There will be 100 blocks available, and we will
offer those that have been surrendered to the ANH in productive
areas. The round will close in September.”
Foreign investment in Colombia’s petroleum sector is expected
to be more than $5 billion this year compared with $3.5 billion in
2007. Colombia hopes to sign 70-80 exploration and production
contracts by yearend compared with 56 last year.
Operators drilled more than 70 wildcat wells in 2007, and Colombia wants this to increase to 90 in 2008. Technical success rates
were over 40%.
Carolina García, licensing coordinator at ANH, told delegates
that operators must be prequalified before they can submit applications for acreage. Production will last 24 years unless operators
seek an extension. They must acquire seismic data under the first
phase of the exploration program and drill wells or shoot 3D seismic during later stages.
“In the ’90s, people were worried about Colombia’s sufficiency
in oil, but now that’s stabilized, and the outlook is for increased

Kazakh ﬁeld gets deeper pool gas ﬁnd

Sapex begins ﬁrst Arkaringa push in 25 years

Tethys Petroleum Ltd., Guernsey, Channel Islands, UK, gauged
an apparent Cretaceous deeper pool gas discovery on the Akkulka
Block in Kazakhstan’s North Ustyurt basin.
The AKK-14 exploration well, drilled on a prospect between the
AKK-13 and AKK-04 discoveries, flowed a combined 13.3 MMcfd
of gas from two intervals. The company’s highest-rate test on the
block, it appears to be the first commercial discovery in Cretaceous
Tasaran sand.
The Tasaran sand stabilized at 7.5 MMcfd with 163 psig flowing
tubinghead pressure on a 30-mm choke, while the overlying Paleocene Kyzyloi sand stabilized at 5.8 MMcfd with 152 psig flowing tubinghead pressure on the same size choke.
The Tasaran is made up of several units of up to 20 ft of blocky,
medium-grained sandstones and are more conventional reservoirs
than the generally thinner and finer-grained Kyzyloi sandstone, the
company said.
The company plans to examine existing seismic for potential
untested Tasaran zones in several older wells and for new leads.
The discovery opens a new play on both the Akkulka and Kul-Bas
blocks.

Adelaide-based Sapex Ltd. has signed a contract with Terrex
Seismic to shoot a seismic survey in the Arkaringa basin in South
Australia beginning in late April.
The 6-week program, comprising 428 km of 2D survey onshore, will be the first seismic work in the basin since the early
1980s when the Santos-Delhi group held permits in the region.
Sapex said that half of the program will provide detailed coverage over two key portions of the Boorthanna Trough, where interpretation of previous data indicated several prospects and leads. The
company anticipates that the work will identify locations suitable
for exploration drilling. Sapex plans to spud two wells before the
end of this year, subject to the seismic results and its ability to secure a suitable rig.
The second part of the survey will be a regional program to
determine the southward extension of the Boorthanna Trough.
Sapex holds 100% interest in seven permits totaling 65,000 sq
km and covering virtually the entire Arkaringa basin. In addition
to conventional petroleum work, Sapex has announced a farmin by
Sydney-based Eastern Star Gas Ltd. to undertake the first coal seam
methane investigation in the basin’s coal measures. ✦

Crew returns to Neptune TLP; analysis continues

Workers’ strike shuts in Shell Gabon production

BHP Billiton Ltd. said Mar. 27 that it is continuing its structural
analysis of a hull anomaly identified on the Neptune tension-leg
platform.
The anomaly was discovered during the TLP’s commissioning
(OGJ Online, Mar. 26, 2008). Personnel working on the TLP were
removed temporarily, but they have returned to work on the platform, BHP Billiton said.
A BHP Billiton spokeswoman told OGJ Mar. 27 that it is still too
early to answer questions regarding if or how the anomaly might
impact future production. Previously, BHP Billiton said production
was expected to start “during the March quarter.”
No details have been released yet regarding the nature of the
anomaly.
“We do intend to update our schedule for first production as we
know more. We believe the impact to fiscal year 2008 production
will be minimal,” she said.
The 5,900-ton TLP was equipped to produce as much as 50,000
b/d of oil and 50 MMscfd of natural gas from an initial seven subsea wells. The TLP was installed June 5, 2007, and the topsides processing facility was set atop the hull later that same month (OGJ,
Aug. 3, 2007, Newsletter).
BHP Billiton is the operator and holds 30% interest. Its partners
are Marathon Oil Corp. 30%, Woodside Energy 20%, and RepsolYPF SA subsidiary Maxus (US) Exploration 15%.

Gabon last week asked Shell Gabon to restart 6,000 b/d of oil
production at its Gamba site, leaving around 54,000 b/d of production still shut in amid an oil workers’ strike.
Shell Gabon, a joint venture of Royal Dutch Shell PLC 75% and
the government of Gabon 25%, shut in 60,000 b/d of production
Mar. 20 following the start of the workers’ strike.
An additional 30,000 b/d of production from Total Gabon and
Perenco SA, which passes through the Gamba terminal, also has
been curtailed.
Shell managed to undertake some maintenance work at its
strike-hit operations in Gabon on Mar. 31, as union officials threatened to extend the worker protest to the whole of the country’s
oil industry.
“Some vital equipment has been restarted [on Mar. 31] to prevent damage to our infrastructure,” Shell Gabon reported in a statement.
Gabon’s National Organization of Petroleum Workers (ONEP)
is demanding various labor concessions from the oil industry on
working hours and time off. Marathon Oil workers notified the
union that they would be joining Shell Gabon workers on strike.
Gabon produced about 270,000 b/d in 2007, according to the
US Energy Information Administration.

NWS to develop North Rankin off W. Australia
The Woodside Petroleum-led North West Shelf gas project joint
venture has made its final investment decision to go ahead with the
North Rankin B platform development off Western Australia.
The $5 billion (Aus.) project is aimed at recovering the remaining low-pressure gas from the North Rankin and Perseus gas fields
and includes installation of a second steel platform at North Rankin.
The structure, with a topsides weight of 23,600 tonnes, will house
gas compression facilities, utilities, and a living quarters module.
The platform will be placed in 125 m of water close to the existing North Rankin A platform and connected by to it via a 100-m
bridge and walkway.
The development work will also include systems tie-ins between the two platforms plus a complete refurbishment for North
Rankin A, which has been in place since the mid-1980s.
Once the work is completed, both platforms will be operated as
a single integrated facility.
The North Rankin B project will extend the life of the North
Rankin and Perseus fields and will support the JV’s onshore gas
commitments to supply customers past 2013. The announcement
also follows approval of a fifth LNG train on the Burrup Peninsula
fed by the NWS gas project fields.
This train will produce 4.4 million tonnes/year of LNG, bring-

ing the total project output to 16.3 million tpy.
The North Rankin B Project is expected to come on stream in
2012.

Chevron lets Platong platform work contract
Chevron Thailand let a contract to J. Ray McDermott SA to build
a central production-processing platform, living quarters, and associated facilities for the Platong Gas II project, Gulf of Thailand.
The value of the engineering, procurement, construction, and
installation contract was not disclosed.
However, executives said it represents a major part of the $3.1
billion investment required for developing the gas structure, which
is about 200 km offshore.
Engineering for this project has commenced at J. Ray’s Singapore office, and installation is expected by the end of 2010.
Platong Gas II’s offshore facilities are designed to produce 420
MMcfd of gas.
The field is scheduled to come on stream in 2011 and to produce more than 330 MMcfd of gas, which will be piped to the Thai
eastern coast for domestic consumption.
Chevron operates Platong Gas II in which it has a 69.8% share.
Other stakeholders are Mitsui Oil Exploration Co. 27.4% and PTT

China faces diesel, gasoline shortages

Petrobras buys into, will upgrade Nishihara plant

China is facing shortages of diesel and gasoline as the gap widens between rising international crude prices and centrally controlled fuel markets.
Shortages first reported in southern and inland China apparently are spreading to the wealthier areas in the north and east as
filling stations struggle to obtain fuel shipments from refiners.
In Beijing, workers at 20 retail outlets said they were either rationing or had run out of diesel because of shortages. Four outlets
in Shanghai said their daily diesel shipments had not arrived. Staff
at another outlet said they were on duty all day and night, waiting
for diesel shipments.
Shanghai authorities played down the shortages and urged drivers not to hoard fuel. The municipal economic commission said the
city has enough diesel to last 10 days. Shanghai and other major
cities experienced brief shortages in the second half of last year, but
those shortfalls disappeared after the government ordered oil companies to ensure supplies and then raised fuel prices by about 10%.
Now with inflation at its highest level in a dozen years, Chinese
officials are resisting pressure from refiners for price increases.
After decades of supplying its own energy needs, China became
a net importer in the 1990s as its economy boomed. Imports rose
12.3% last year to 1.1 billion bbl, and they now supply nearly half
of China’s demand.
With crude priced close to or above $100/bbl on the world
market, independent refiners have reduced or stopped production.
Under orders to ensure supplies to major cities and key sectors
such as farming and public transport, state-owned major oil companies such as Sinopec and PetroChina reportedly limited sales to
independent retail outlets in some regions.

Brazil’s state-owned Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) has acquired an 87.5% stake in the 100,000 b/d Nishihara refinery in
Okinawa owned by Japan TonenGeneral Sekiyu KK, the Japanese
subsidiary of ExxonMobil Corp.
Nansei Sekiyu, in partnership with Petrobras, has Sumitomo
Corp. as a shareholder that will retain its 12.5% stake in the company.
Sumitomo and Petrobras are expected to spend as much as
¥100 billion to upgrade the Nishihara facilities and boost the cost
competitiveness of the refinery as an export base.
Much of the output from the refinery is said to be low-value
heavy oil, so Petrobras will build facilities for producing highvalue gasoline and kerosine along with a variety of petrochemical
materials.
The refinery has an oil and derivative terminal capable of storing as much as 9.6 million bbl, three piers with potential to receive
large vessels, and a monofloat for very large crude carriers.
Petrobras said the agreement, valued at some $50 million,
marks an important first step in its strategy to launch downstream
operations in Asia.
Petrobras, which has discovered fields in Central and South
America as well as Africa, is trying to boost exports. This latest
move illustrates its plan to be involved in the refinery process and
to secure refineries in proximity to markets.
In February, TonenGeneral Sekiyu KK said its net profit plummeted 82.4% last year. The company blamed the earnings erosion
on its inability to pass on higher oil prices and shipping charges
to its oil products.

Cienfuegos reﬁnery on line; expansion mulled
Processing at Cuba’s 65,000 b/d Cienfuegos refinery is on
schedule 2 months into operations with gasoline output beginning
in March and expansion plans on the drawing board, according to
a senior official.
PDV-Cupet SA—a joint venture of Venezuela’s state-run Petroleos de Venezuela SA and CubaPetroleo—owns the refinery, which
is in the port city of Cienfuegos, 155 miles southeast of Havana.
Julio Sanchez, director of refinery expansion, said the facility
began processing crude Jan. 8. It has reached its initial capacity and
was to begin producing gasoline Mar. 21, he said.
He said the refinery is expected to produce 48% fuel oil, 18%
diesel, 12% gasoline, 10% jet fuel, and 10% LNG for the domestic
market and for export to other countries in the Caribbean region.
Further development plans call for the refinery eventually to
process 150,000 b/d of crude and supply feedstock for a planned
petrochemical industry in the area (OGJ Online, Feb. 3, 2008).
Sanchez said the $1.3 billion expansion of the facility would get
under way in 2009 and begin operation in 2013.
Cuba has two other refineries, Nico Lopez in Havana and Her-

manos Diaz in Santiago de Cuba, 860 km east of the capital. The
two facilities have a combined capacity of 65,000 b/d.

World biofuels demand rising, report says
World biofuels demand is expected to expand at 19.5%/year to
92 million tonnes in 2011 despite concerns about the impact of
biofuels on the environment and food supplies, Freedonia Group
Inc. said in a report.
The Cleveland market research firm said 2006 world biofuels
demand was 37.7 million tonnes, and that the annual growth rate
was 19.9% during 2001-06.
Future market expansion will come from a more-than-doubling
of ethanol demand and even faster increases in global biodiesel demand. Other biofuels also will experience strong growth but at a
slower pace than ethanol or biodiesel, Freedonia said.
The annual growth rate for biofuels demand from 2006-11 is
forecast at 35.3% in Asia Pacific, 22.1% in Western Europe, and
19.5% across North America. In terms of absolute gains in expanding biofuels demand, North America will be the leader, Freedonia
said. ✦

First LNG cargo for Sabine Pass terminal
A carrier is bound from Nigeria with the first cargo of LNG
for Cheniere Energy Inc.’s Sabine Pass LNG terminal in Cameron
Parish, La.
The 145,000 cu m-capacity Celestine River LNG vessel, owned
and operated by Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. (“K” Line) is scheduled to arrive Apr. 12 at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal.
Sabine Pass LNG, under construction for 3 years, is the largest US
regasification facility with an initial send-out capacity of 2.6 bcfd
and peak capacity of 4.3 bcfd. It has 16.8 bcf of LNG storage capacity
and two berths capable of handling the largest LNG vessels.
In February, Cheniere Energy hired Credit Suisse as its financial
advisor in evaluating the future of the Sabine Pass LNG terminal.
Options include taking on partners or selling Cheniere’s 2 bcfd
portion of the terminal’s 4 bcfd capacity. Total SA and Chevron
Corp. each hold 20-year agreements for 1 bcfd capacity (OGJ Online, Feb. 28, 2008).

Tepco plans LNG import terminal at Sendai
Japan’s Tohoku Electric Power Co. (Tepco) will build a new LNG
import terminal at Sendai, aiming to disperse its LNG sites in order
to minimize the risk of supply disruptions from earthquakes and
other problems.
Tepco, which currently receives all of its LNG at its Niigata
terminal, said the new facility will have storage capacity of 1 million tonnes of LNG and is expected to begin operations around
2016.
On Mar. 6, Tohoku Electric received some 70,000 tonnes of
LNG on a spot basis from Qatar that arrived at the Niigata terminal
aboard a Q-Flex vessel. It was the second Q-Flex cargo to arrive
in Japan after the first shipment in January (OGJ Online, Jan. 11,
2008). In December 2007 Tepco signed an 8-year agreement to
purchase gas from North West Shelf Australia LNG. Tepco would
10

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

purchase about a million tonnes/year from 2010.
Tepco’s territory covers seven prefectures in the Tohoku region
of northeastern Japan, providing gas to electric machinery makers
and other large-lot electricity users.

Japanese LNG buyers make deal with Indonesia
Japanese buyers have agreed to forgive Indonesia’s failures to
supply 72 cargoes of LNG as part of a 10-year extension to supply
contracts that were due to expire in 2010 and 2011.
Iin Arifin Takhyan, deputy director of Indonesia’s state-run PT
Pertamina, said his country has been released from liability for failing to deliver 72 LNG shipments to Japan last year and causing a
gas shortage.
The new contracts are for 3 million tonnes/year over the first
5 years of the contract and 2 million tpy over the next 5 years. The
extensions represent a significant cut over the current contracts,
which call for 12 million tpy.
The reduced supplies follow earlier announcements by the Indonesian government that it was planning to reduce LNG exports
to Japan because it wants to use more gas for domestic purposes.
Iin said LNG will be sold at $15-16/MMbtu fob and that the
price of the gas is linked to the worldwide price for oil. If the crude
price drops, the price of the LNG could also be lowered.
Analysts said that Indonesia’s deal to raise LNG prices to Japan
sets a new benchmark for Asian term contracts and increases the
pressure on other gas deals currently under negotiation. ✦

Problems with hydrogen
This letter responds to the article
“Shell Oil executive outlines 12-point
energy plan” (OGJ, Mar. 10, 2008, p.
35).
Step 8 of Shell’s 12-point program
in the referenced article is “Developing
a hydrogen fleet and fueling infrastructure.” Shell’s statement is made without
any reference to the source of molecular
hydrogen, H2, for vehicle fuel. H2 is not
found significantly in nature; therefore, it must be manufactured by very
energy-intensive processes. H2 production involves unburning water. That fact
means it is necessary to input energy
into H2 manufacture. That input energy
is subsequently made available when the
H2 is used to power a vehicle.
Water can be unburned with electricity by electrolysis for H2 production, but
today most hydrogen is manufactured
by the reaction of water at high temperatures with the carbon and hydrogen
contained in fossil fuels, although biomass could also be reacted with water
for H2 production. Domestic coal could
be used for H2 production and reduce
our dependence on imported petroleum
and natural gas. The resulting coproduced CO2 from H2 manufacture could
be sequestered in geologic formations,
if desired.
A better use for manufactured H2 is
to upgrade heavy oil and residues plus
distillates containing sulfur and nitrogen
into transportation fuels. In this manner,
one pound of hydrogen would provide
considerable amounts of specification
transportation fuels using proven, largescale processes. These fuels would enter
the present fueling infrastructure and
not require a new infrastructure that
would be necessary for retail distribution of H2.
Shell scientists and engineers certainly
understand the above circumstances concerning H2 and much more. It is a great
disservice for the public formulation of
our nation’s long-term energy policies
for Shell and other oil companies’ PR
personnel to make public pacifying, simplistic statements, as per the example of
their Step 8—“Developing a hydrogen
fleet and fueling infrastructure.”

Windmills in paradise

Bob Tippee
Editor
To drive regularly between Abilene
and Lubbock, Tex., is to witness the
industrialization of the Llano Estacado.
This Houston resident and his wife
make the trip frequently thanks to
daughters who attend Texas Tech University.
Each time, we see more wind
turbines than we saw the trip before.
Thousands of the structures now spike
the landscape westward from just
outside Abilene along Interstate 20
and northwestward along Highway 84
toward Lubbock.
They used to sit mostly atop the
crooked red ridges that make the vast,
mostly tree-free flatness out there interesting. Now they’re sprouting everywhere, in many places right next to the
road.
My wife dislikes what the proliferation of wind turbines does to the view.
It seems to me there’s plenty of view
to go around in West Texas, but I don’t
argue.
I just wonder why so many of the
things don’t spin, even when the wind
blows.

Wind research
These observations, voiced during
a conversation in Houston, inspired
Tom Standing, a San Francisco engineer
and energy analyst, to conduct a little
research.
Actually, a lot of research. Standing,
who has written articles for Oil & Gas

Journal, squeezes a subject hard when it
gets his attention.
Standing says new and expanded
wind ranches planned for the next
few years will “add about 10,000 new
turbines across the Texas prairie, all of
which would be visible from up to 7
miles distant.”
A certain Houston lady won’t like
hearing that. But Standing has different
concerns: how much power all those
propellered units actually will produce
and variability of the power profile.
He points out that nameplate capacities of wind turbines are rated at wind
speeds of 30-32 mph, that power output is proportional to the third power
of wind speed, and that the capacity
factor of a turbine is defined as instantaneous power output divided by the
rated power output. Capacity factor can
be calculated from the ratio of instantaneous wind speed divided by the wind
speed at which the turbine is rated,
raised to the third power.
Standing says a turbine needs a wind
speed of 80% of the rated speed to
register a capacity factor of 50%. At the
9-10 mph of wind needed to overcome
inertia, a turbine generates power at
about 3% of rated capacity.
Standing uses these relationships
and wind-speed data from the University of Wyoming, interpolated to 80 m
above the surface to account for the hub
height of large turbines, to calculate
capacity factors for hypothetical wind
turbines in windy US locations.
He observes that the largest area with
the strongest winds in the Lower 48
stretches between Amarillo and Dodge
City, Kan. To the north and south, wind
speeds decline gradually. To the east and
west, they fall rapidly.
Standing’s calculated capacity factors

are for windy March and April and calm
August 2003 in seven cities in the highwind corridor.
The highest capacity factor is 50%
for Dodge City in April, the second
43% for Amarillo in the same month.
That means a 100 Mw wind ranch near
Dodge City would have produced 50
Mw of power, and a comparable facility
near Amarillo, 43 Mw, when winds
were strongest. Calculated capacity factors are much lower for Midland and
Fort Worth, other cities demarcating the
area of fast wind construction in Texas.
“Far more important than monthly
averages is that capacity factors are erratic with respect to time, constantly
gyrating from a low end of 0-10%
when winds are light to brief periods
at the high end when windy conditions
give capacity factors between 50% and
100%,” Standing says.

Surges and lulls
Calculated capacity factors can
remain at 0-20% for 2-3 days then
jump to nearly 100% in barely 12 hr.
Contrary to assurances of wind-power
proponents, Standing adds, surges in
some areas usually don’t offset lulls in
others; the surges and lulls tend to happen at the same time across the windy
corridor.
Between Amarillo and Midland,
capacity factors can rise or fall by 60%
within 12 hr. So by 2011, when Texas
has about 10,000 Mw of installed wind
capacity, power generation might rise or
fall by 6,000 Mw in half a day, requiring the sudden start-up or shut-down
of 15-20 peaking plants to balance load.
This might create more problems
than the sight of windmills in rattlesnake pasture, but please don’t tell a
certain Houston lady that you encountered that judgment here. ✦

Spurning unconventional oil
An energy-craving country obsessed by fear
of oil from the Middle East should welcome
prospects for a new 7-8 million b/d from North
America. Not the US. Not as long as congressional
leaders remain blind to how they boost oil prices
when they limit supply.
Without question, the Middle East will dominate supply of conventional oil for the next several
decades. Important supplementary production will
grow from countries of the former Soviet Union
and Africa. Notwithstanding exceptions such as
Brazil, future growth in conventional oil production will occur mainly in the Eastern Hemisphere.

Unconventional oil
On the other side of the planet, production
nevertheless can grow. But the Western Hemisphere’s potential is mainly unconventional
oil—heavy fluid hydrocarbons dependent on large
inputs of energy for production and processing.
While output now is relatively low, it is growing
from resources of enticing scale.
Production exceeds 1 million b/d and will approach 4 million b/d by 2020 from 170 billion
bbl of reserves of bitumen and heavy oil in Alberta. Venezuela has capacity to produce 580,000
b/d of synthetic crude from its huge resource of
extra-heavy crude. And the US has more than 2
trillion bbl of shale oil in place and resources of
heavy oil for which development is advanced in
California and just beginning elsewhere.
Political leaders who motivate energy policy
with panic over Middle Eastern oil should at least
want to know how much oil supply might be possible from the massive unconventional resources
of Canada and the US. Instead, congressional luminaries are foreclosing the potential.
Last December, Congress voted to deny funding for federal oil shale lease sales approved in the
Energy Policy Act of 2005. On Mar. 13, the Senate
passed an outright moratorium on oil shale leasing (OGJ, Mar. 24, 2008, p. 34). Unlike bitumen
and heavy oil in Alberta, production of shale oil
isn’t commercial; by refusing to allow access to
the resource, Congress keeps it that way. It ensures
that technology never advances and that no part of
a huge domestic resource can be developed.

Last year, a study required by the 2005 energy
bill said the US might be able to produce 2.5 million b/d of shale oil by 2035 (OGJ, Nov. 5, 2007,
p. 20). The study further envisioned production in
that year of 530,000 b/d from US tar sands and
750,000 b/d of heavy oil, up from the current
2,700 b/d in California. Achieving those levels of
production, representing together nearly 40% of
the recent import rate for crude oil, would require
government help such as price floors and a $5/bbl
production tax credit until investment payout, the
study said.
Congress, however, is in no mood to support
anything related to oil. In fact, its Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 explicitly limits US
imports of oil from unconventional sources. According to Sec. 526, “No federal agency shall enter
into a contract for procurement of an alternative
or synthetic fuel, including a fuel produced from
nonconventional petroleum sources...unless the
contract specifies that the life-cycle greenhouse
gas emissions associated with the production
and combustion of the fuel supplied under the
contract must, on an ongoing basis, be less than or
equal to such emissions from conventional petroleum sources.”

Intentional limit
Congress mainly wanted this provision to
prevent the US Air Force from developing liquid
fuels from coal. But after the Canadian ambassador
voiced concern that an “expansive interpretation”
might crimp oil exports to the US from Canada,
the author of the measure said his handiwork applies to oil sands, too. Because of greenhouse gas
emissions, said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.),
“It is important to ensure that the federal government does not subsidize or otherwise support the
expanded use of these fuels through government
purchasing decisions.”
An elective body that professes concern about
oil from sources deemed hostile to US interests
thus precludes assessment of a huge, secure,
domestic resource while acting to limit imports
from a friendly neighbor. This is colossal self-contradiction, the continuation of which will become
colossally costly to energy users. ✦

“This is a milestone project for both
Repsol-YPF and Fluor as it is the largest
refinery upgrade and expansion project
in Spain in the past 30 years,” said David Seaton, president of Fluor’s energy
and chemicals group.
The $4.8 billion project includes the
design and construction of new units
and the refurbishment and expansion of
existing units, as well as construction of
utilities and offsites. Commissioning is
scheduled for 2011.
Vietnam’s central Phu Yen Province
licensed a joint venture of the UK’s

Capitalized at more than $1.7 billion,
the Vung Ro refinery in the province’s
Dong Hoa district will be the country’s
first wholly foreign-owned refinery. It
will be operational in 2012.

Petrochemicals
Jurong Aromatics Corp. let a contract to UOP for the basic engineering
and design for an aromatics plant to
be built on Jurong Island in Singapore.
When completed in 2011, the complex
will produce 800,000 tonnes/year of
paraxylene, 200,000 tonnes/year of
orthoxylene, and 450,000 tonnes/
year of benzene (OGJ Online, Jan. 31,
2008). It will be one of the largest
privately owned petrochemical facilities
in Singapore.
Total and Sonatrach signed a framework agreement to build a $3 billion
petrochemical complex with a 1.4
million tonne/year ethane cracker in
Arzew. The signing follows a memorandum of understanding signed in July
(OGJ Online, July 19, 2007).
The facility will produce 1.1 million
tonnes/year of ethylene, which will
be processed into polyethylene (two
units with a total capacity of 800,000
tonnes/year) and monoethylene glycol

(550,000 tonnes/year). Total holds
a 51% stake in the joint venture and
Sonatrach 49%. Commissioning is
scheduled for 2012.

Pipelines
Oneok Partners LP plans to construct a 78-mile NGL gathering pipeline to connect a gas processing plant being built
by Devon Energy Corp. in Hughes Co., Okla., and a recently
constructed gas processing plant owned by Antero Resources
Midstream Corp. in Coal Co., Okla. It is scheduled for completion in the second quarter. Project cost is $25 million.
Aspen Aerogels was awarded a contract to supply its
advanced Spaceloft aerogel insulation for a 13-mile, subsea
gas pipeline being built by Technip for Petroleo Brasileiro SA
(Petrobras) in Brazil. The pipeline will connect the Canapu
field (in 1,700 m of water) to the Cidade de Vitoria floating
production facility (in 1,400 m of water). This will be the
first pipeline in Brazil to use a pipe-in-pipe design (production pipe surrounded by carrier pipe with insulation in
between). It will be completed in the fourth quarter.
Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline plans to invest $240
million to expand the capacity of the 330-mile US mainline portion of its gas pipeline system (OGJ Online, Feb. 7,
2008). The decision followed a successful open season for
the additional capacity.
M&NP will install additional compression at existing
compressor stations and lay about 4.5 miles of 24-in. loop
on its existing 24-in. mainline to enable transmission of
as much as 170 MMcfd year-round and an additional 30
MMcfd during winter months. The expanded system will be
in service in November 2010. ✦

Lawmaker urges majors to
spend more on alternatives
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Saying that the poorest US families now spend 10% of
their annual incomes on gasoline because of high oil prices,
a US House committee chairman said that major oil companies should direct a similar portion of their profits to
alternate energy research and development.
“There’s been a windfall of revenue which has fallen to
these oil companies the last few years, and it is expected to
continue. They are the world’s leading oil companies and we
can’t solve these problems without their help,” said Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) as he ended a nearly 3-hr hearing
of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and
Global Warming Apr. 1.
He was particularly critical of ExxonMobil Corp., which he
said plans to spend only $100 million over 10 years on alternate and renewable energy research and development when
several of its competitors individually plan to spend billions.

API: Oil costs remain key gasoline price inﬂuence
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Oil costs, and not reﬁnery turnarounds, are primarily responsible
for higher gasoline prices, American
Petroleum Institute ofﬁcials said.
“We have signiﬁcant gasoline inventories on hand. We also have relatively
soft demand. So it’s no great surprise
that turnarounds are taking place,” API
Pres. Red Cavaney told reporters during a Mar. 31 teleconference.
Diesel fuel prices may be climbing
more rapidly because governments in
Europe have created greater demand,
and imports from there are harder to
ﬁnd, Cavaney said. “The increase from
Jan. 1 through [Mar. 28] was 95¢. Unlike gasoline, which is about 20¢/gal
less, it seems to be in lock-step with
crude,” he said.
“You have a tighter market for diesel
than for gasoline,” added John C.

ExxonMobil Senior Vice-Pres. J.
Stephen Simon, one of five major oil
company executives who testified,
said, “After we put the brightest minds
in the company to work addressing
the prospects for renewable energy
prospects, we determined that current
technologies won’t do the job. Consequently, we are examining ways to
develop future technologies.”
He subsequently said ExxonMobil is
concentrating its research on ways to
mitigate carbon and other climate impacts of burning fossil fuels, which the
multinational oil and gas firm believes
will remain the dominant near and
mid-term energy source.
Markey said,“You can’t have it both
ways, Mr. Simon. You can’t nickel-anddime renewable energy R&D when your
company made $40 billion in profits
last year and paid several billion dollars
in dividends and executive compensation.”

Felmy, API chief economist, who also
participated in the teleconference.
Their remarks came 3 days before
the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee’s scheduled hearing
to examine whether nonoil institutional
investors are inﬂuencing crude prices.
They also followed a Mar. 26 Consumer
Federation of America report that
alleged that reﬁners are performing
maintenance now to reduce inventories
and increase proﬁts during the summer
driving season.
Turnarounds normally take place as
reﬁners deplete inventories of winter
fuel blends and before they begin to
produce fuels with summer formulations, Felmy explained.
“The reason we’ve seen increased
gasoline prices has been higher crude
costs. Reﬁners’ returns aren’t good
right now. On [Mar. 28], the price of
crude was $2.51/gal. Add in about 47¢
for taxes, then consider the costs of re-

Other steps
Markey said the companies also
should support, instead of oppose, HR
5351 which would shift $18 billion in
financial incentives from the biggest US
oil companies to alternate and renewable energy research and development
programs as a way to give consumers
some relief from high prices.
“Finally, the [President George W.]
Bush administration must stop filling
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve during
periods of high prices to send a signal
to the market and oil speculators that
Americans won’t be held hostage,”
Markey said.
Shell Oil Co. Pres. John D. Hofmeister, BP America Inc. Chairman and
Pres. Robert A. Malone, Chevron Corp.
Vice-Chairman Peter J. Robertson, and
ConocoPhillips Executive Vice-Pres.
John E. Lowe also testified at the hearing, “Drilling for Answers: Oil Company
Profits, Runaway Prices, and the Pursuit
of Alternatives.”

ﬁning and distribution, and the proﬁts
don’t look great,” Felmy said.
Unlike 2007, when there were
several unplanned US reﬁnery outages, maintenance is following normal
seasonal patterns early in 2008, Felmy
said. “I think higher prices are starting
to have an impact on demand, but the
change is at the margin. We learned in
the early 1980s that permanent changes
occur when consumers change the kind
of cars they drive and the number of
trips they take. There’s no question that
fuel’s share of total household expenditures has gone up from 4.6% in November 2006 to around 5% now, with
gasoline representing about 20-25% of
the increase,” he said.
He and Cavaney also questioned
whether institutional investors are driving oil prices higher. “Alan Greenspan,
when he was chairman of the Federal
Reserve, said it about as well as anybody. When people buy oil for noncommercial accounts, they provide liquidity
for the markets,” Cavaney said.

Hofmeister said in his written statement that crude prices have climbed
past $100/bbl because global oil demand growth has accelerated in recent
years from rapid economic expansion
and industrialization of China, India,
and other countries. Geopolitical events
in Nigeria and other producing nations;
higher costs for labor and engineering
services amid scarce supplies; increasing
difficult access to oil and gas resources
worldwide, and available supplies increasingly being found in areas that are
more technically challenging, more remote from markets, and more costly to
develop also have contributed, he said.
The US dollar’s declining value and
global investment firms rebalancing
their portfolios to include more commodities, including oil and gas, were
also factors contributing to the higher
prices, he said.
“Most of these factors are not controlled by or even much influenced by
the actions of oil companies. However,

our business is developing energy and
delivering to consumers in the most
efficient and cost-effective manner we
can. We will continue to strive to contain costs and to deliver these energy
products to consumers at competitive
prices in a secure and reliable manner,”
Hofmeister said.

More sensitive markets
Global oil demand’s accelerated
increase since 2004 has reduced spare
capacity, creating a tighter relationship between supply and demand and
heightening market concerns, said
Robertson. “This new reality and the
impact on oil prices are compounded
by the weakening of the US dollar.
The higher oil price is in part a market adjustment that reflects weakening
purchasing power of oil exporting
countries that sell their oil in US dollars
but buy goods with stronger currencies
such as the euro,” he said in his written
testimony.
While biofuels potentially could
play an important transportation role,
they still face commercial challenges,
Robertson said. “One of the country’s
largest biodiesel facilities in Washington state, for instance, has an annual
production capacity of 100 million gal.
This amount would serve the country’s
demand for transportation fuels for
about 6 hours of 1 day, and it roughly
equals the amount of transportation
fuel that Chevron’s refinery in Pascagoula, Miss., produces in a single week,” he
said.
Worldwide investments in renewable and alternate fuels have increased
nearly fourfold since 2004, and nearly
$150 billion has been poured into the
sector in the past 12 months, he continued. Their total volume is expected
to increase by about 45% by 2030 to
meet demand but still will represent
only about 10% of the total energy
mix, their current share, because overall
global demand is growing so quickly,
Robertson said.
“Energy efficiency is the most immediate and important action that each
of us can take to start to reduce energy

Security Act of 2007 (EISA 2007) to
keep the US Air Force from developing coal-to-liquids (CTL) fuels
could limit imports of Canadian oil
produced from tar sands.
While the requirement in Section 526 of EISA 2007 applies only
to federal fuel contracts, it would be
significant. US military services are
the biggest single domestic purchaser
of petroleum products. During fiscal 2007, they bought nearly 136.1
million bbl worldwide, according to
data from the Defense Energy Supply
Center.
Canadian Ambassador to the US
Michael Wilson expressed his concern on Feb. 22. “Canada would not
want to see an expansive interpretation of Section 526, which would
then include commercially available
fuel made in part from oil derived
from Canadian oil sands,” he said in
a letter to US Sec. of Defense Robert
M. Gates.
Noting that the two countries operate under the North American Free
Trade Agreement, and that Canada is
the largest, safest, and most secure
source of imported energy for the
US, Wilson said: “Canadian oil production and Canada’s share of US oil
supply are increasing, mainly because
of oil sands production in Alberta.”

Not alternative fuel
Wilson’s main point was that
Canada does not consider oil extracted from oil sands an alternative fuel
because it is processed in conventional facilities and is produced commercially. The US Energy Information
Administration has classified 174

“There
There is little fuel on the US marmar
ket that is 100% petroleum extracted
only by conventional methodology.
Oil sands-derived petroleum represents approximately 5% of US supply
and is not segregated from other
petroleum,” unlike biofuels, the ambassador said.
House Oversight and Government
Reform Committee Chairman Henry
A. Waxman (D-Calif.), who was the
provision’s author, disagreed. While
it was originally a response to Air
Force CTL development proposals,
Section 526 also applies to tar sands,
“which produce significantly higher
greenhouse gas emissions than are
produced by comparable fuel from
conventional petroleum sources,”
Waxman said.

Implied subsidies
Waxman maintained, “The development and expanded use of these
fuels could significantly exacerbate
global warming, with highly dangerous effects. Thus, it is important to
ensure that the federal government
does not subsidize or otherwise support the expanded use of these fuels
through government purchasing
decisions.”
Section 526 was not intended to
keep federal agencies from buying
generally available fuels, such as diesel or jet fuel, that may contain incidental amounts from unconventional
petroleum sources, Waxman said. But
it would apply to any contract for a
CTL or other alternative fuel, or for
“a fuel produced from a nonconventional petroleum source such as tar
sands,” he added. ✦

prices. The United States must become
a nation of energy savers. In short,
we need a ‘Made in America’ solution
enabled by everything from human ingenuity to ‘smart’ buildings to advanced
vehicles and transportation systems.
Markets are indicating that consumers
are already taking action. You and your
committee have a critical role to play
to engage the US public and put the
United States at the forefront of responsible energy use,” he told Markey.

Recognizes negative effects
Malone said the US faces tremendous energy challenges now because
of short-sighted government policies,
poor market dynamics, and decisions
that limited access to resources, discouraged development, and constrained
investments to meet growing demand.
“BP recognizes the negative effects high
prices have on the economy and the
consumer. We alone can’t change the
conditions that brought us here. Energy
companies, policymakers, and consumers all have a role to play in creating a

T E R E S T
new US energy future,” he said.
The company strongly supports
renewing incentives for wind, solar,
and biofuels R&D, he continued. “They
are an important part of why the US
has been so successful in developing its
renewable energy sector, but we cannot
support a tax package that discourages
efforts to bring on other much-needed
energy sources such as oil and gas production,” Malone said.
“Despite the growth and development activity we are experiencing
in alternatives, they cannot close the
supply gap that is projected to occur
over the next 20-year period. Fossil
fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas
will be critical to meet expected energy
demand growth,” he continued. The US
must also produce more of the energy
it consumes and increase its energy efficiency, Malone said.
Lowe said Congress should encourage development of more domestic
conventional supplies, optimize biofuels production, and encourage development of both alternate and uncon-

ventional sources. “Although oil sands
and unconventional fossil fuels such as
oil shale and coal gasification are more
energy and carbon-intensive than
conventional sources today, they could
substantially improve energy security
because these resources are abundant
in the United States and Canada,” he
said.
He noted that ConocoPhillips is testmarketing unbranded E-85 in a number
of states with more than 2,500 potential sites, provided participating marketers meet certain image, safety, and fuel
quality guidelines. “Results from our
test are pending, but industry data have
shown that the consumer response to
E-85 to date has not been very good.
Many retailers who have installed E-85
dispensers report insufficient consumer
demand to justify the expense of the
conversion,” he said.
“We have a pilot project testing
E-85 at some of our company-owned
subjects in the Chicago area. So far, consumer response has been poor,” added
BP America’s Malone. ✦

Under a strategy that simply uses
immediately expedient solutions, there
could be an even bigger squeeze on oil

Growth of wind, solar, and other alternates could take place locally but would
be limited, he said.
Under the “blueprints” scenario,
new coalitions emerge, initially within
cities or regions and sometimes across
national borders, Bentham continued.
“Meaningful CO2 pricing may emerge
around 2012, not due to political altruism but from local responses to emergency situations,” he said.

environmental impacts, which are
acknowledged and addressed under
the “blueprints” scenario, Van der Veer
said. The tools for doing this include
cap and trade programs, CCS, moreefficient transportation, credible wind
and storage targets, and more-efficient
building and appliance standards, he
emphasized.
“Europe may be having some problems as it implements its cap and trade
system. But it’s based on the US sulfur
dioxide trading system from the 1980s,
which was very successful and provides
a good model,” Shell’s chief executive
said.

He said Shell has tried to take the
lead by putting high CO2 penalties on
new construction the last 8 years. The
company also has become the world’s
largest biofuels distiller, benchmarks
operations to be in the top environmental quartile, and works with other
companies to conserve energy. “There’s
still a lot of low-hanging fruit on the
energy conservation tree,” Van der Veer
said.
The two executives made a similar
presentation a day earlier in New York.
The company also plans to hold a webcast on its new energy scenarios with a
live online question and answer session

crashed, and credit markets today are worse than in a decade.”
Oil prices hit $112/bbl on Mar. 17 and natural gas prices
rose to $10.30/MMbtu—the highest since January 2006.
Wickland thinks the upward trend in oil and gas prices will
continue, as did most of the attendees, who thought oil
would reach $120/bbl before it would reach $90/bbl.
Exploration continues to thrive, with drillers experiencing
a 54% increase in revenue per rig since the second quarter
of 2004. The international rig count is up 14% since January
2006 and the US rig count up 21%. Canada is the exception
with its rig count down 46% in that 2-year period.
Wicklund predicted that offshore drilling growth will
continue. It has increased operation income by 700%, more
than triple that of onshore drilling.
Wicklund also sees caveats ahead, however. Political
instability and restricted access will continue to plague the
industry.
Oil companies face the prospect of peak oil—with what
he called “twilight in the desert” (the Middle East)—and
Russian oil production is down for the first time ever. Mexico
is considering changing its constitution to allow international investment to offset its production drop in Canterell field,
Wicklund said.
Gas companies will see more cost competition with
substitutes as prices continue to move up. LNG imports will
decline due to global competition, Canadian production
is declining, and conservation is biting into demand. For
example, US production has increased 3.8% in 2008, but
demand is up only 1.7%.

Government challenges
According to the National Petroleum Council, to meet future energy demand to 2030 without jeopardizing economic
growth, the US must take five actions: moderate demand by
increasing energy efficiency, expand and diversify US energy
supplies, strengthen global and US energy security, reinforce
US technology and capabilities to meet new challenges, and
address carbon constraints, said Rod Nelson, Schlumberger
Ltd.’s vice-president for innovation and collaboration. He also
served as chairman of the technology task group for the NPC
study.
NPC gave the recommendations to Secretary of Energy
Samuel Bodman last July in response to his 2005 query regarding such strategies (www.npc.org).
_________
Nelson said NPC’s in-depth study reported that global
energy demand would grow 50-60% by 2030 because of
improving living standards in a growing global population
and that coal, oil, and natural gas will remain indispensable
in meeting that demand growth because, although the use of
alternates will grow during that time, so would fossil fuels
proportionately, and the energy “pie” would retain the same
proportions.
“Coal is not the flavor of the day,” Nelson said. “Maybe [it

US” because the technology for “cleaning” it is not yet economically feasible.
Two thirds of the study participants
were not from the energy industry, Nelson said, but from such diverse entities
as universities and environmental and
financial groups.
Other findings from the study, Nelson said, were that although the world
is not running out of energy resources,
there are growing risks to continued expansion of oil and gas production from
conventional resources and that these
risks present major challenges to meeting total demand.

T E R E S T
Mitigating those risks will require
expanding all economic energy sources,
including biofuels and other renewables, nuclear, coal, and unconventional
oil and gas. Each of these in turn will
face such challenges as safety and environmental, technical, political, economic, and feasibility hurdles, Nelson said.
Moreover, Nelson said, the study
emphasized that “energy independence” is not realistic in the foreseeable
future, but US energy security can be
enhanced by strengthening global trade
and investment, diversifying domestic
supplies, and moderating demand.
For instance, Nelson said, new

corporate automobile fuel efficiency
standards could save 1 million b/d for
each increased mile per gallon gained
nationwide.
The study, which gave specific
methods for accomplishing the goals
identified, said that the workforce must
also be replenished and trained, and
that policies aimed at curbing carbon
emissions will alter the energy mix, increase energy-related costs, and require
reduction in demand growth.
Nelson said Schlumberger is working on methods for sequestering carbon
dioxide in the ground but it hasn’t been
done on a large scale. ✦

IEA: Non-OPEC output decline rates lower than believed
The combined production decline
rate for countries outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
is steadier and less steep than is generally believed, according to the International Energy Agency, Paris.
Failure since 2004 of non-OPEC
production to achieve predicted output
gains has created the impression that
decline rates are accelerating.
In fact, IEA says in its March Oil
Market Report, the aggregate decline
rate for mature non-OPEC fields already
in steady decline averaged 7.7%/year

during 2000-07 and did not “accelerate
markedly” during the study period.
IEA’s analysis focuses on production of conventional crude oil and
condensate from fields with sustained,
yearly output declines for at least 12-18
months.
The agency believes the net decline
rate for non-OPEC production, accounting for fields not in decline as well as
those that are, is 4-5%/year.
“We believe that sluggish non-OPEC
performance is being driven by other,
largely aboveground constraints, not
solely by resource depletion, important

though this is for the longer term,” IEA
says.
The agency says decline-rate surges
in 2005 and 2006 reflect distortions
such as those caused by hurricane damage in the Gulf of Mexico, extended
shut-ins in the North Sea, and asset
divestments in Russia.
Decline rates are greatest in mature
producing regions of the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development, exceeding 15%/year in the
North Sea, Australia, and offshore US
(Fig. 1).
Decline rates generally are greater for
OECD than for non-OECD producers
(Fig. 2).
In the US onshore and Canada, excluding mining and upgrading operations, they are about 5%/year.
“The surprisingly static overall
profile of decline in OECD basins may
actually suggest the beginnings of a
price response on the supply side,” IEA
says. Renewed drilling and enhanced
oil recovery might be starting to offset
natural declines, it adds, although the
effect may be limited by engineering
shortages.

EPA signs more-stringent air quality standard
The US Environmental Protection
Agency on Mar. 12 signed its most
stringent standard for ground-level
ozone, revising the standards for the
first time in more than a decade.
As widely anticipated, the new
National Ambient Air Quality Standard
(NAAQS) is 0.075 ppm. That compares
with the previous standard of 0.08
ppm.
EPA said the change was based on
the most recent scientific evidence
about the effects of ozone, the primary
component of smog.
The American Petroleum Institute
said it was disappointed with the EPA
decision.
“The uncertainty in the latest science
does not support tightening the standards,” API said. “Changing the ozone
standards (NAAQS) will not, by itself,
improve air quality, but will result in
unnecessary negative economic conse36

quences for the American people.”
The National Petrochemical and Refiners Association said the change was
unnecessary and could have a negative
impact on some communities.
Charles T. Drevna, NPRA president,
said, “At a time when analysts are warning of an impending recession, the last
thing the federal government should do
is impose a standard that would reduce
growth and result in higher costs for
consumers without requisite health
benefits.”
EPA Administrator Stephen L.
Johnson announced the decision from
Washington, DC. “By meeting the
requirement of the Clean Air Act and
strengthening the national standard
for ozone, EPA is keeping our clean air
progress moving forward,” he said.
Johnson also recommended four
principles for the CAA and the NAAQS:
• They must protect the public

health and improve the overall wellbeing of citizens.
• They should allow decisionmakers to consider benefits, costs, risk
tradeoffs, and feasibility in making
decisions about how to clean the air.
• They should provide greater accountability and effective enforcement
to ensure that not only paper requirements but also air quality requirements
are met, especially in areas with the furthest to go in meeting these standards.
• They should allow the schedule
for addressing NAAQS standards to be
driven by the available science and the
prioritization of health and environmental concerns, taking into account
the multipollutant nature of air pollution.
Various public health organizations
argued for a 0.060 ppm, based on scientific studies of ozone and its impact
on health. ✦

Colombia’s state-owned oil company Ecopetrol SA recently resumed
sending oil through its trans-Andean
oil pipeline after operations were suspended following several attacks in the
southern provinces of Narino and Putumayo near the border with Ecuador.
Ecopetrol normally sends about
60,000 b/d of oil through the pipeline from oil fields in the southern
province of Putumayo to the Pacific
port of Tumaco. The left-wing Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,
or FARC, are suspects in the multiple
attacks on the pipeline.
Attacks on pipelines by hostile
forces are hardly an irregular occurrence anywhere in the world. But this
attack is suspect due to the fact that
the FARC forces—although Colombian—are actually based in Ecuador.

Why are the three nations opposed to Colombia? That’s not hard
to say, and no one doubts that oil is
involved. Colombia produced about
540,000 b/d of oil last year, and
much of its output was exported,
primarily to the US.

High aims

But it would certainly like to
increase those figures, according to
Armando Zamora, chief of Colombia’s oil licensing agency ANH, who
said Ecopetrol aims to raise output
first to 700,000 b/d by 2015 and to
1 million b/d by 2020.
“Our goal is no longer just to

depending on the wildlife present.
Existing rules do not address provisions
to protect wildlife.
Neslin called the proposed wildlife
standards “less extensive than originally contemplated.” Draft rules include
90-day periods for restricted drilling in
designated wildlife areas (primarily in
western Colorado).
If an operator or surface owner finds
a timing restriction to be unacceptable,
they can consult with OGCC to find a
mutually agreeable solution to allow
drilling in exchange for alternative
mitigation.
Operators also may receive an exemption by limiting the density of their
development to two pads per section
(one pad per section in sage grouse

Europia: EU must issue
policies that help
reﬁners compete
Doris Leblond
OGJ Correspondent
The European Union should provide
its refining companies with “a globally
competitive level playing field” to help
them face the “important” challenges
of the next years and make the needed
investments, said Panos E. Cavoulacos,
president of the 17-member refining
trade group Europia. He spoke at the
ninth annual meeting of the European
Fuels Conference held in Paris Mar.
11-12 and organized by the World
Refining Association and The Energy
Exchange Ltd.
Of special concern for Europia are
the EU’s environmental and energy policies which are not being matched by
any other region in the world. They are
increasing constraints and uncertainties
and are creating “unequal cost burdens
for our industry,” insisted Cavoulacos.

Stable policies needed
“We need a stable and predictable

policy framework that does not expose
the European refining industry to unfair
competition and supports long-term
investments,” he said, adding that EU
policies “impact heavily on our industry
and profitability.”
These policies include cutting greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 20% of
1990 levels by 2020, possibly by 30%
as urged by the current Slovenian EU
presidency in a recent draft statement.
The policies also require that 20% renewables be used for power production
and 10% biofuels be incorporated in
transport fuels by 2020.
Central to the EU’s climate change
efforts is an emissions-trading scheme
under which auctioning of CO2 emissions permits will become compulsory
by 2013. Full auctioning, points out
Europia, at €30/tonne of CO2 will substantially narrow refining margins and
may cause imports to increase if CO2
costs exceed freight costs to the EU.
Europia also warned that, while
cleaner fuels help improve air quality
when burned, their production emits
more CO2 so that market demand
and cleaner fuels imply that European
refineries will emit more—not less—
CO2.
Europia further warns that the Inte-

grated Pollution Prevention Control will
render industrial operations more costly
“with negligible additional human
health benefits.
The fuel quality directive, which
aims to regulate GHG emissions from
liquid road fuels and proposes a target
of 1%/year reduction during 2010-20,
will impose new constraints on products, fears Cavoulacos, who believes that
in the 2020 time frame, the only way to
lower GHG emissions is by increasing
biofuels content.
An additional concern is the global
marine fuel specifications proposals, which he says are not sufficiently
well-targeted to achieve public health
benefits at a reasonable cost.

China, where capacity could exceed
demand in 2012. This will lead to
competing gasoline exports to the US
and jet fuel and diesel into Europe. At
the same time there is an emphasis on
distillation capacity investments and
upgrading worldwide, the former to
reach nearly 240 million tonnes/year
over 2007-12 and the latter to exceed
75 million tonnes/year within the same
period.
There also are diesel and kerosine
hydrotreating capacity investments during 2007-12 which will reach 120 million tonnes/year. All of which means
that “conversion capacity investment
will be significantly higher outside
Europe,” cautioned Cavoulacos.

SUCCEEDING In A Changing Environment
As the industry shifts to deeper water, the environment in
which we work becomes more complex, hazardous and
expensive. Successful companies recognize early the
changing conditions and environmental challenges facing
the industry. At the Deepwater Operations Conference &
Exhibition in 2008, participants and attendees will discuss
how to succeed under these extreme conditions.
The seventh Deepwater Operations Conference & Exhibition
will be held on November 4 – 6, 2008 in Galveston, Texas

and will see a return to the luxurious Moody Gardens Hotel
and Conference Center.
Plan to attend, sponsor and exhibit at the 2008 conference
and exhibition as the technical focus shifts to “Succeeding
in a Changing Environment.” As with our past conferences,
proceedings will not be published and the press will not be
invited to assure conﬁdentiality between the attendees and
the speakers allowing the most up–to–date information to
be shared.

plays elsewhere in the Midcontinent
although he could not elaborate yet on
specifics.
“There are a couple of tests we will
be doing this year to see if we can find
some more areas other than just the
Woodford,” Dunn said.

“We found ways to reduce total fluid
volume, i.e. costs, and still get the same
recoveries. We continue to work with
fracture stimulations to cut costs.”
The company declined to give specifics, citing proprietary information.
Newfield expects large cost savings
from using common pads. Pad size
ranges from 1 to 2½ acres depending
on the number of wells to be drilled.

mined. Geology is one limit, and regulatory or unit issues are another limit.
“There is nothing (mechanical)
stopping us at 5,000 ft, and that is
really the only answer I can give right
now,” Dunn said. “Other companies in
other geologic provinces have drilled
farther than that. But nothing in the
Woodford yet has told us how far we
can go.”
Spacing for the Woodford shale to
date is 640 acres. Oklahoma regulations
limit a company to producing a lateral
within that unit. Counting standoffs on
either end, that means about 4,700 ft in
terms of the portion being produced,
which Newfield has done, Dunn said.

Multilateral testing planned
Newfield’s next major step will be
to test multilateral technology, which it
plans to do later this year. Multilateral
drilling hasn’t been tried in the Woodford shale, but the technology has been
tested in the Bakken shale in North
Dakota and Montana.
“What we will test initially is just
trying to get two laterals in,” Dunn said.
“There is certainly the technical ability
within the service industry to do more
than that.”
For instance, in areas where Newfield
cannot drill extended laterals, it might
be able to drill two laterals at whatever
spacing, 40-acres or 80-acres, apart
down the same vertical well bore, Dunn
said, adding that could have the same
effect as drilling extended laterals.
Meanwhile, Newfield has several
40-acre and 80-acre pilot programs
under way to determine its ultimate
development well spacing.
Newfield has cut its drilling time for
Woodford wells in the last 2½ years
through using combined technology
advances for both the vertical and horizontal sections.
Drilling time for vertical sections
was cut by learning where to set casing
strings and by using air drilling in some
areas, he said.
“In certain areas, our horizontal
sections have utilized things like rotary

as spare-part inventory tracking. The
systems are in place now and working, although they require rigorous
double-checking to make sure nothing
is missed.
The PMS is now being installed on
other rigs owned by local drilling contractors, working internationally, aiding
their competitive advantage.
Another cause for initial concern
among the local people was the way
the Wells team handled environmental
aspects of the project. Correct cutting
disposal, for example, is very important, since the region is a major water
catchment area and fresh water in most
48

places can be found as shallow as 10
m below the surface. The subcontractors that handled transport had to be
educated to upgrade their standards,
including be it the use of safety belts or
sealing trucks with tarpaulins to prevent
drilling fluids leaking onto the road.

Setting drilling records
It was clear that the first well target
duration was going to be hard to reach,
but carrying out several trials in the
first well was essential, especially on
BHA and bit design. It became quickly
obvious that the biggest problem areas

are the 121⁄4-in. buildup section, landing the surface casing, and the speed of
drilling in the hard and abrasive 81⁄2-in.
laterals.
The first well, CB1-1 took 239 days
to complete versus 135 days planned.
The production of the first wells clearly
showed the importance of drilling long
reservoir sections (Fig. 6). Tortuosity
was quite severe in the first well due to
the large variety of bits and tools that
were used and the geosteering used to
find the sweet spots in the reservoir. For
this reason the torque kept creeping up,
resulting in having to call total depth
early.
While drilling the second leg in the
first well, Shell established the RTOC in
Miri. Here, with help of the well planners, torque and drag were modeled
and monitored, and well paths were
optimized.
Communications with the rig were
intensified, and the crews successfully
tried various torque-reducing agents.
They were successful, especially using
the Cosmo lubricant made in China for
Shell under license. With these technologies, it was possible to drill the legs of
well CB3-2, to a record length of 2,251
m. Steerability improved drastically as
well. After the first goal was achieved,
it was time to try to bring down the
number of bit runs and increase the
rates of penetration (ROP) without
compromising safety and drilling tool
integrity.

Operation delays
Two issues created operational delays
while the first six wells were drilled,
despite improvements in ROP and operational efficiency:
1. The bottom section of the 121⁄4-in.
buildup section penetrated several
carbonaceous layers that were prone to
caving, resulting in an oversized hole. In
this environment, the drillstring cannot
be adequately stabilized and excessive
side loading may occur, leading to BHA
failures, particularly with the mud motors.
2. Drillers made the unpleasant
discovery while drilling the reservoir

sections that the sands proved to be a
lot more abrasive than initially thought.
The sand in Changbei consists primarily of coarse quartz arenite, the worst
rock for wearing out bits and tools.
Although the bit runs and ROP were
increasing over time, all drilling tools,
and especially the drillstring, started to
show serious wear.
As a result, several drillstring failures
happened, including parted motors,
connection washouts, under-gauge
sleeves and stabilizers, and undergauge
bits with dropped cones.
The solutions included improving
drillstring management and adding good-quality hardbanding. After
studying the production casing wear
and concluding that the protrusion
was acceptable, the 7-in. tool joints on
the 51⁄2-in. drill pipe had four rows of
Arnco 300 hardbanding applied.
Crew training is key to improving
drillstring management and a lot of effort has gone into making sure that the
drillstring was treated ‘like a queen.’
Drilling parameters had to be adapted
to suit a minimum wear policy and
slow speed motors were applied.
Tricone bits have been successfully
designed under the guidance of a bit
expert in Miri, with a maximum volume of carbide and diamonds on the
gauge. Failures in bottomhole assembly
components also led to a decrease in
aggressiveness of drilling parameters,
resulting in reduced ROP, but an overall improvement in well delivery.
Similarly, it has been a challenge to
run the production casing to bottom,
requiring large running loads with
the risk of damaging the casing in the
process. The Changbei drilling team
implemented stronger casing connections and developed special coal drilling
procedures to prevent these problems
in the future. In parallel, new casing
schemes are being studied.
Currently, the target is a 170-day
well, with a stretch target of 140 days.
From the time-depth graph in Fig. 6, we
see the wells have flat spots indicating
nonproductive time (NPT). The top of
the learning curve is still far away, but

the best composite curve indicates the
target can be beaten.

Start-up
The Changbei drilling project has
started up on time with minimal HSE
impact, while the exposure has been
large due to the local culture and the
harsh and remote environment. Drilling has continued through two harsh
winters without a noticeable increase
in incidents and without much invisible lost time. The multilateral well
design with 2 km horizontal laterals
has proven to be superior in terms of
productivity. The Shell team has grown
to 65 from 24 employees and is delivering first-class drilling practices. It is
only a question of time before the first
140-day well will be drilled.
In the next issue, part two of
the Changbei wells story: technical
details, working toward the planned
learning curve, and key points
gleaned during the start-up.

bore and wellhead design for Jubarte
wells.
The JUB-6 tree needed to be qualified for 2,500 m of water, although
the tree had been already qualified for
2,000 m of water. The qualifying did
not delay the project.
The tree incorporates a new tree cap
actuated by a 100-hp remotely operated
vehicle (ROV) and has new subsea connector designs. Landing of tubing hangers in horizontal subsea trees involves
the rotation of a key through a helix to
land in a keyway.
This wellhead hanger has the same
configuration; proper landing during
installation is critical for preventing
damage of the lines.

The well is about 2,900 m from the
floating production, storage, offloading
(FPSO) vessel. All production flowlines
are insulated, flexible 6-in. diameter
pipes, with a thermal exchange coefficient (TEC) of 8 w/m-K.
The project required development of
a special umbilical integrated with the
power cable. Beyond its conventional
functions as hydraulic control, chemical injection, and electric signal carrier
(including pressure and temperature
sensors) for the subsea tree, the umbilical contains an electrical supply cable.
The field development concept allows for a minimal number of risers
to the FPSO, as well as an optimized
subsea layout.
The ESP power cable conductor size
is 240 sq mm and designed for 8 kv
and a maximum 200 amp. The maximum temperature limit of the umbilical is 43° C. because of the polymeric
hydraulic duct limitations. The umbilical has a 4-km length.

than had been used previously with
this drive. This could result in variances
in the setup. Although the step-out
was relatively short, the VSD parameter
settings for the higher rated ESP were
unknown.
2. The interaction of the VSD with
the pump and how the higher rating
would affect system performance resonances were unknown.
3. The cost of replacing a damaged ESP after installation in the well
is extremely high, particularly when
compared with the cost of the test. In
previous tests, the setting of the drive
damaged the downhole ESP equipment.
The test eliminated the risk of damage
due to incorrect VSD parameter settings.
Table 1 lists the instruments and the
parameters monitored.
Several issues arose from the string
tests. In the locked rotor test, the motor
shaft is locked while attempts are made
to start the motor. During the test, the
drive did not give a message to differentiate this status from starting against a
short circuit at the motor terminals. This
was solved with minor modifications in
the setting parameters of the drive.
Otherwise few other modifications
were necessary to the drive because of
what had previously been learned from
previous tests.
This was the first time the string test
included a vibration test. This test was
in accordance with API RP 11S8 and
performed simultaneously with tests
recommended in the API RP 11S2. The
tests included accelerometers attached:
• On the middle of the lower and
upper motor.
• Next to the thrust bearing on each
seal section.
• On the base and middle of each
pump.
• On the pump discharge.
A computer stored all the data for
later analysis. For each stabilized operating condition, the test collected about
1
⁄2 million data points at a sampling
frequency of 4,096 hz for generating
each spectrum.

Lessens learned
Several problems occurred during
installation:
• The standing valve run to pressure
test the capsule did not seat on the test
nipple. The reason was that the crossover below of the nipple had a smaller
diameter than the centralizer of the
standing valve. Running the standing
valve without the guide (distance from
the rig floor to the setting nipple was
only around 50 m and totally vertical)
solved the problem.
• The chemical injection line thread
was damaged while it was passed
through the shroud hanger. The 3⁄8-in.
NPT threads needed to be redone.
• The umbilical to run the drill
pipe showed a good electrical reading,
but when the umbilical started to be
introduced into the seawater the insulation went down. A new umbilical was
brought in to continue the installation.
Because the time to tie back the
well to the FPSO was unknown and
for preserving the ESP downhole set,
the project called for filling the capsule
with a plug of oil-based n-paraffin that
had a density similar to diesel.
The n-paraffin is friendlier than
diesel or brine for the ESP elastomers.
The elastomer’s metallic materials were
selected for the completion fluid and
could survive for some time immersed
in diesel or brine. But these fluids are
not recommended for extended periods
such as months.

control will prolong the ESP run life.
Damage to the ESP can occur from back
flow, dead heading of the pump, or motor overload.
The ESP control system (ECS)
provides for monitoring, protection,
start permissive, run permissive, alarm
and trip logic, and interface with the
FPSO distributed control system (DCS).
A simple and robust architecture is
important for this task and appropriate
communications with the other systems
is essential (ESD/SPCS/ESP control
system).
Most important systems that interact with the ECS are HPU (hydraulic
power unit), variable-speed drive, and
downhole monitoring surface panel to
monitor and protect the ESP:
The variable-speed drive controls the
ESP operating amps and is the primary
method of monitoring the ESP. This is
the most valuable parameter for controlling the ESP.
The downhole monitoring surface
panel shows the intake and discharge
pressure, motor temperature, and vibrations. All are useful for checking the
health of the ESP.
The HPU opens, closes, and monitors the condition of subsea valves and
ESP control

Due to the nature of the ESP, its vul- interface with HPU is set for permisnerable position in the production well, sion to start up. For example, if any
and associated equipment, diligent ESP valve is closed and needs to be open, no
54

permission to start up the system will
be given until the valve opens. If any
valve is closed, the system will shut off
the ESP.
Also, the drive is hardwired to the
ESD system. For any ESD the drive
would trip the ESP.
The ECS also will shut down the ESP
for flowline pressures below the maximum differential pressure capabilities
of the ESP to protect the system against
flowline leak.

Natural ﬂow, gas lift
ESP pump performance traditionally
is shown on a curve with the flow as
the abscissa and the head is the ordinate
(Fig. 4). This representation is intended
for normal pump operations, that is, the
pump turning in the correct direction at
an appropriate speed, producing positive head (higher at the discharge than
the intake), and positive flow (flowing
from the intake to the discharge).
When a pump stops, and if the fluid
weight is greater than the intake pressure, the flow will fall back through the
pump, and in that case the fluid is negative (flowing from discharge to intake)
and pressure is also negative (higher at
the discharge than the intake).
At certain flow the pump will start to
rotate. The fluid volume to start to move
the ESP must be sufficient to break the
inertia of the pump and motor. The
system acts like a generator. If flow rate
is sufficient to rotate the ESP, one needs
to take into consideration two issues:
• The bearings of the operating
ESP acquire a lubrication film between
runner and bearing. Fluid viscosity and
rotational speed create this film. At low
speed, there is the metal-to-metal contact that wears out the bearings.
• In a flowing well, the flow through
the pump is still in the positive direction, but since the pump is not energized, it impedes the flow and creates
a pressure drop. This places the operation of the unit in the second quadrant
(Fig. 5) and affects the thrust forces in
the pump. The pressure-created down
thrust is now negative and acts with
rather than balances the up thrust

forces. The stages can be damaged due
to the heavy up thrust forces.
Petrobras did not operate the ESP
after connection of the flowline to the
FPSO. Initially the well produced with
natural flow about 10,000 b/d for 2
months. This is harmful for the ESP and
several precautions were taken.
Each pump has its own four-quadrant curve. As an example, Fig. 5 shows
the limits to start rotating the stages.
As a general rule, a –25-30% flow rate
of the best efficiency point (BEP) at 60
hz will generate enough energy to start
rotating the pump.
The pump in Well JUB-06 has a BEP
of 27,000 b/d, and the well produced
around 10,000 b/d natural flow (+37%
of BEP). This is above the maximum
recommended. But each pump and motor has a different curve and therefore
should be tested to ensure the correct
production range through the pump
from natural flow or gas lift production.
A damaged pump requires a workover; so it is recommend to control from
surface the flow rate with a choke if the
well is on gas lift or flows naturally.
Another way to avoid damage is a
Y-tool (Fig. 6). These tools have been
used for dual completions, and also
to produce the well through an ESP
pump. In the case of a capsule, or even
a packer above the ESP, the tool act is as
a shrouded hydraulic sliding sleeve that
helps to bypass the pump when it is
stopped. This could maximize production because it would not be limited to
producing the well through gas lift or
natural flow.
Using this tool is still under study
because the tool could fail. Reliability
must be the first concern in subsea
installation.

ESP start-up
The well began producing with an
ESP on Apr. 24, 2007, and produced as
expected. No major operating problems
have occurred since start-up.

The Russian petroleum tax structure
encourages the country’s operators to export
refined products rather
than crude oil; therefore
Refining
Russian crude throughput averaged 4.6 million
b/d in 2007, a new post-Soviet era
record, according to the International
Energy Agency’s
“Oil Market Report,” published
on Feb. 13,
2008.
The crude
processing rate
was an increase
of 4% compared with 2006 and 15%
more than the 5-year average (Fig. 1),
according to IEA.
Although this strategy is common
among oil-producing countries, Russian
tax structures may result in strategies
that fail to promote long-term investment in the industry.

Russian reﬁning tax structure
fails to promote investment

Tax codes
The 2004 change to the tax code
contributed to sharply higher product
exports, concentrated in six refineries

(Table 1), which accounted for more
than half the increase in Russian crude
throughput in 2007, according to
IEA. Because upstream producers own
these refineries, they face a clear choice
between selling crude domestically,
exporting it, or refining it.
The factors that influence this decision include:
• Domestic refining capacity and
domestic product sales.
• Crude and product pipeline capacity, both domestic and export.
• Access to alternative export infrastructure, e.g., rail or barge shipments.
• The incentive that the Russian tax
code provides to optimize between
domestic and export sales of both crude
and products.
According to IEA, the Russian tax
code heavily influences these companies’ revenues, which can change
dramatically depending on world oil
prices, providing significant incentives
to integrated Russian oil companies to
adjust their sales methods. Russian oil
companies pay three separate taxes on
their activities:
1. Royalties on crude production;
taxed at 22% after certain allowances.
2. Export tax; based on the market

price of Urals crude in the preceding
2 months. Light products have a 30%
discount on the tax charged and fuel
exports benefit from a 60% discount.
3. Corporate profit tax of 24%,
charged on net income, which is similar to other industries.
When the IEA report was written, Russian government tax revenues
were around $65/bbl and integrated
oil companies reported net income of
about $10/bbl. The lagged nature of
the current tax structure can also distort
significantly the economic incentive to
refine crude oil and, at times, sell products into the domestic market, rather
than export them, according to IEA.
The lower tax burden on fuel oil
reduces the incentive to invest in
upgrading capacity, with the posttax
margin between hydroskimming and
cracking refineries much narrower than
in Europe.
Figs. 2a and 2b show the incentives
created by the tax system.
According to IEA, the Russian tax
structure clearly encourages running
crude through a refinery, targeting the
products either for domestic or export
sale, vs. the alternative of exporting the
crude. The increase in refining crude
runs, however, has also been influenced by other factors such as pipeline
capacity constraints, local demand for
transportation fuels, and the imperative
to sustain gas availability for export.
The overall price trend dramatically
affects the net income per barrel that
companies achieve—in a falling market
the lagged nature of the export tax can

materially depress net income. Similarly,
in a rising market, the impact of the export tax is offset as revenues rise ahead
of the calculated tax burden, according
to IEA.

Global reﬁning
In Europe, throughput has increased
in complex refineries and simple refineries have been upgraded to a more
sophisticated configuration; however,
in Russia more than half of the refiners
who have increased runs are hydroskimming operators rather than catalytic
cracking, based on fuel oil yields.
According to IEA, this is partly due

2007

2008

to the current tax structure, which appears to reduce a refiner’s incentive to
invest in upgrading equipment in the
medium term. In the short term, this
is not necessarily a problem as long as
the market is able to absorb or reprocess
partly refined fuel elsewhere.
The tighter fuel specifications taking
effect in many countries around the
world may make it harder for importing countries to readily process partly
refined fuel. In particular, given the
uncertainty of sustainable supplies from
Russia in a fluctuating oil market and
the high cost of installing upgrading
and desulfurization equipment, Euro-

pean or American refiners may not want
to install surplus additional capacity to
handle Russian exports, according to
IEA.
The potential for Russia to require
greater domestic fuel oil use as a substitute for tightening gas supplies complicates matters further.
In the future, the Russian tax

structure as it currently stands may fail
to deliver long-term benefits to the
refining industry. A simpler tax system
could have provided Russian refiners
with the same incentive to boost crude
throughput, while investing in upgrading capacity, as has been seen in the
OECD and that has delivered significant
results. ✦

index increased 40 points during 2007.
The process unit index dropped during

2006 and then gained during 2007,
starting at 890.2 and ending at 924.6.
These two indexes varied during 2006

based on raster data models can efficiently manage and analyze this data.
This article presents the raster-based
GIS model developed for pipeline routing and lists the model’s advantages in
pipeline implementation. Routes defined with network analysis techniques
over raster-based GIS models minimize
economic, environmental, and time
costs, depending on the quality of data
used.

Background
Route selection is the most important step in the pipeline planning
process; affecting technical, economic,
sociological, and time components of
the project as a whole.1 This primacy
requires defining the factors affecting
route selection and weighing these factors, organizing the resulting data into a
usable database. GIS technologies allow
these steps to be taken in the integral
manner required to make accurate routing decisions (OGJ, June 22, 1998, p.
63).

An interface
based on the proposed model examined its applicability.
Development of the interface used the
C# software language and ArcGIS 9.2
software, allowing the user to choose
which factors determined route selection. Users can increase or decrease the
weight of any factor on the basis of cost
criteria. The user can enter areas that
will definitely act as barriers (flora and
fauna areas to be preserved, active erosion areas, fault lines, etc.) in advance,
effectively defining the route. The user
can also define stops between the start
and end of the route.
The interface then allows calculating
the cost of alternative routes. Finished
pipeline projects and their cost reports
provide unit costs. Fig. 2 shows the
work flow of the model and the process
steps of the database.

• Creating a friction surface for each
evaluation criterion, where each cell in
the grid is assigned a value based on the
relative cost of traversing that cell.
• Weighing and combining multiple
friction surfaces to create a cost-of-passage surface, representing the total cost
associated with traversing each cell.
• Using a spreading function to
combine separate grids representing
source points and destination points
with the cost-of-passage grid to calculate an accumulated cost surface.
• Tracing the lowest cost line down
the accumulated-cost-surface from a
departure point to a destination.14
Testing the model required attempting to optimize the route of current gas
pipeline with it. Process steps for the
optimum route defined over the model
include:
• Type of project, factor selection. The first
process step is defining the type of
pipeline planned. According to the type
of project selected, the user receives
factors that affect the route and factor

weights as defaults. The user can select
any of the factors over this interface on
the basis of the existing data and can
change factor weights according to the
details of the project. Classifying data
into a geo-database organizes them for
use in this step.
• Raster conversions, classification. The
model then makes projection conversions for the vector-based positional data organized in a database and
converts data into raster format. The
data scale (pixels of the pipeline used
equalled 50 × 50 m) allows adjustment of the required pixel dimension
identification. Sub-factor classifications
(complexity grading) required for the
data converted into raster format occur
automatically in line with data obtained
from current engineering activities and
operations (Table 2).
• Pixel-based calculation, weighted surface.
Factor weights and classified raster data
layers enable pixel-based mathematical
calculations, obtaining the weighted

absolutely impossible to be passed and
the areas with high passage costs to be
modeled as barriers on the surface. This
step used ∞ value in subunit classification for absolute barriers (earthquake
areas, flora and fauna areas, etc.). An
algorithm prevents the route from passing over pixels to which this value is assigned. A value of 9, assigned to places
with high passage cost (roads, streams,
and erosion areas), means passage is
quite difficult.
• Source, destination, stops. A user can
model the route’s source, destination,
and stops on a weighted surface. The
model marks related points for this procedure and records them in the database
as a separate file. This process step allows the route points over the interface
to be shown (Fig. 2).
• Optimal routing. After these interim
procedures, a cost distance algorithm
using ArcGIS 9.2 software generates the
final route. Fig. 4 shows the optimum
route defined by these steps.

Route examination
Model development first subjected
the current route to evaluation of economic, sociologic, and environmental
factors affecting route selection. Route

data guided passage characteristics
increasing cost (Table 2). Distance and
population data provided the basis
for examining environmental damage
caused by the route and social problems
resulting from proximity to settlement
areas.
Calculations on the 10 m either side
of the pipeline route determined 22
hectares of forest and 15 hectares of
agricultural field (hazel nut and green
tea) were damaged and detected three
passages over landslide areas, 13 passages over highways, and 9 passages
over streams. The average distance from
the pipeline of 18 settlements measured 470 m. The optimal route would
damage 20 hectares of forest and 15
hectares of agricultural fields, crossing
11 highways and 6 streams. It lies 870
m from settlement areas (Table 3).

Results
Construction costs of the optimal
route run nearly 23% lower than construction costs of the constructed route.
The lower number of streams, highway
passages, and passages over landslide
areas in OR than in CR drives the cost
difference. Other factors affecting cost
include elevation differences, geological elements, and soil structure. OR
passes through fewer forests and
biologically important fauna areas
than CR. The shorter route length also
causes less damage to the environment. OR also maintains a 1,430-m
distance from tourist areas. ✦

Free online engineering calculator tool

New laser range measuring, tracking tool

A new free online engineering calculator tool is designed for use by engineers
and students worldwide. The developer
says the tool calculates complex engineering equations at the click of a button.
Web site: http://www.calculatoredge.
com
___

The new PD 4 laser range meter measuring device provides accurate measurements at the push of a button.
With a sensor-automated backlight
and simple, one-button operation for
measuring and tracking functionality, the
PD 4 measures distances with laser precision of ±1⁄12 in. from 7.8 in. up to 230
ft. Requiring only one person to operate,
the laser range meter is able to measure
quickly and safely in places where access
is difficult, the firm points out.
The unit has durable rubber protection
surrounding its edges, creating a dusttight, water-resistant casing. Tested in up to
2 ft of water for up to 8 hr, the durability
of the PD 4 allows the meter to withstand
the harshest of job site conditions, the
company says.
Under lifetime service, the PD 4 will
be serviced quickly and reliably, if needed,
with no additional cost for 2 years.

Deepwater GOM knowledge base offered
A new 2008 deepwater Gulf of Mexico
knowledge base—Reservoir KB—is directed towards gulf exploration and appraisal
reservoir engineers.
The company says its database provides
coverage of all the deepwater reservoirs
currently either in production or sanctioned for development. And it provides
continually updated reservoir performance
metrics, analogs, lessons learned, and
regional knowledge.
Reservoir KB is provided on a subscription service as a hosted portal to a group
of 18 operators in the region. Updates are
presently provided on an annual basis, this

date including fresh data and information
covering 2007 as well as updated analysis.
Reservoir KB has grown, together with
deepwater activity in general, to 182 fields
and 379 reservoirs from an initial coverage
of 26 fields.
The database features a map-based
interface that lets users select a field then
drill down to reservoir and well information or navigate into the system using a
search engine. The photo above shows a
zoomable user interface.

Climate bill seen
raising gas use,
lowering supply
Climate-change legislation in the US
Senate would boost demand for natural gas
while limiting supply, according to analyses
by two industry groups.
The Climate Stewardship and Innovation
Act sponsored by Sens. Joseph Lieberman
(I-Conn.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) would
raise gas demand by an average 14%/
year against reference-case levels during
2020-30, warned the Natural Gas Council in

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s

a Mar. 11 letter to lawmakers (OGJ Online,
Mar. 12, 2008).
NGC challenged a US Energy Information Administration assertion that the
legislation could lower gas use. It said EIA
assumed construction of 145 nuclear plants
by 2030 and argued the number more likely
would be 25.
Since the council began its study, the
Lieberman-McCain bill has evolved into the
Climate Security Act, with Sen. John Warner
(R-Va.) replacing McCain as lead cosponsor.
Like its predecessor, the newer bill
would impose a declining cap for greenhouse gas emissions, enforced with tradable allowances. Emission targets are more
aggressive in the newer version of the legislation, which the Environment and Public
Works Committee passed last December.
If NGC is right, the new legislation, with
its toughened emissions targets, would raise
gas demand by more than its study projects.
But the measure also would discourage investment in gas supply, warns the
American Exploration & Production Council
(AXPC).
The new law would require gas producers
and processors to buy allowances for emissions by gas end-users, AXPC says. Contract
and market structures would keep them from
passing through all the new costs.
The effects: Lower proﬁts on production,
lower spending on gas drilling and development and, therefore, lower supply.
“Less natural gas supply in the face of
increased demand will drive consumer
prices sharply higher,” the council says.
Political pressure is strong to cut emissions of greenhouse gases without regard
to cost. But the costs, according to recent
studies of climate-change legislation by the
Environmental Protection Agency and National Association of Manufacturers working with the American Council for Capital
Formation, are high.
The simultaneous if unintended suppression of gas supply and stimulation of
demand can only drive overall costs even
higher.

Dollar value, crude prices ﬂuctuate
The May benchmark US crude contract jumped above $107/bbl Mar. 27 in the
New York market following the bombing of a primary export oil pipeline in southern
Iraq. It fell nearly $2/bbl Mar. 28 when Iraqi ofﬁcials said shipments through that
system were back to normal. However, the price rebounded above $106/bbl in early
trading Mar. 31 as the US dollar slipped to a low of $1.5895 against the euro. Longterm weakness of the dollar encouraged investors to hedge against the tumbling
currency by buying crude and gold futures.
The attack was the ﬁrst since 2004 on one of two main pipelines to Iraq’s primary
oil export terminal. Consequently, Paul Horsnell, Barclays Capital Inc., London, said,
“We see events in Iraq as having taken a dangerous turn, with the stability of the
southern oil system now starting to become a potential concern.” He said, “Arguably
considerations of the current geopolitical context have been playing a very minor
role in oil trading strategies in recent months. Equally arguably, they perhaps should
now be playing a larger role, given that the key geopolitical issues have remained
raw and unresolved, and because the reduction in global crude inventories has
meant less cover and more potential for volatility.”
Although traders previously focused on the disruption of Iraq’s oil exports from
its northern ﬁelds, Horsnell said, “In the short term, the main danger has always
been an unraveling of the precarious balance between competing factions and other
interest groups in the south of Iraq. What has occurred so far is not yet a full unraveling, but it certainly represents a series of steps towards some potentially dangerous
outcomes.”
Oil at ‘turning point’
Oil is “at a turning point” for a $10/bbl move in either direction, depending on the
strength or weakness of the dollar, said Olivier Jakob, Mar. 28, at Petromatrix, Zug,
Switzerland. “The dollar index is now back to testing the record low support, and it
will remain the trigger for West Texas Intermediate to test the record-high resistance.
If the euro manages to climb towards $1.60, WTI will break $110/bbl towards $115/
bbl, and if the dollar manages to rebound like in mid-March, WTI will break $100/
bbl towards $95/bbl.” He said, “The gasoline crack is falling back to counter-seasonal
values and will remain under pressure in any dollar rally.”
As the dollar index gave back its gains during the week of Mar. 23-29, the May
crude contract also “gave back its losses,” Jakob said Mar. 31. “The euro is now
facing a strong resistance line and the fate of crude oil will depend very much on
whether the euro manages to break the $1.585 resistance towards $1.60. If the euro
was to break towards $1.60, then the correlation trade should push West Texas
Intermediate to break $110/bbl towards $115/bbl. There is nothing really fundamental
about that, but it is a prevailing technical trade.”
Meanwhile, Paul Sankey, senior energy analyst for Deutsche Bank, New York, said
it’s not the speculators who are pushing up oil prices as many claim. “Oil supply is
weak and global demand is strong, so the oil price is high,” he said. “Supply spare
capacity is terribly weak, almost scarily so.” Sankey noted, “Spot delivery global gas
(LNG) is trading at $20/MMbtu, or $200/bbl of oil equivalent. There are no ‘speculators’ in that market.”
On Mar. 28, Adam Sieminski, global energy economist for Deutsche Bank, lifted
his average price estimates to $95.75/bbl for crude and $9.25/MMbtu for natural gas
in 2008 and to $102.50/bbl and $10.75/MMbtu in 2009. “These 2009 forecasts still
leave upside room to prior peaks in both oil and gas when adjusted for inﬂation and
income growth,” he said.
Sieminski said, “World oil markets are starting to loosen up ‘fundamentally,’ but
the degree of tempering does not appear to be acute and corrective forces are taking
time.” His latest forecast for the global economy puts world gross domestic product
growth for 2008 at 3.5%—“signiﬁcantly less than the 4.6% forecast in December
2007, but not a recession,” he said. “Higher prices and slower GDP are starting to
erode demand; nevertheless, oil demand is expected to rise by at least 1 million b/d
in 2008 and by even more than this in 2009,” said Sieminski. “Current non-OPEC supply growth forecasts look for a rise of 1 million b/d for 2008 and 2009. This suggests
that the ‘call on OPEC’ for 2008 and 2009 will not be under much, if any, downward
pressure. Markets remain tight while geopolitical forces and asset allocation factors
provide support.”

Yeah, cheap
imitations
make us
laugh, too.

There is only one.
Pretenders have tried to match the performance of our Tricone bits.
And why not? Hughes Christensen has defined the industry standard for
roller cone bits since, well, since we created the first one back in 1912.
Of course our commitment to improvement and the industry’s largest
R&E spend make Tricone a pretty tough act to follow. After all, there is
only one king.
Thank you…thankyouverymuch.

Capacities and new regulations top
pipeline protection concerns
Pipeline protection technology
challenges center on corrosion,
inspection

Public concerns over pipeline integrity and safety flared anew following the March
2006 spill of 5,000 bbl of crude oil—the largest ever on Alaska’s North Slope—from
a gathering line, operated by BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc., that delivered North Slope
crude to a gathering center for ultimate delivery to market via the Trans-Alaska
Pipeline System (TAPS), shown on the cover. The gathering line leak was attributed
to undetected corrosion, the No. 1 concern of industry’s efforts to protect pipelines.

Most noteworthy among regulatory concerns for the pipeline industry in recent years is the 2002
US Pipeline Safety Improvement
Act (PSIA), which has ushered in
a daunting new set of challenges
for industry to meet in maintaining
pipeline integrity.
PSIA requires enhanced maintenance programs and continuing integrity inspections of all pipelines in so-called high-consequence areas (HCAs). Initially, the industry had voiced concerns
about its ability to meet PSIA deadlines for implementing effective pipeline integrity management programs. Of special concern
are mandates to ascertain and maintain the integrity of the US’s
vast network of aging pipelines—much of it unpiggable.
Pipeline companies were required to identify all HCAs by Dec.

Education and training

Skills gap

The greatest concern regarding regulatory and environmental
issues really is the education and training of pipeline service
companies and regulators alike, contends Richard Norsworthy,
director, Lone Star Corrosion Services division of Polyguard
Products Inc.
“The industry has grown so rapidly in recent years, the
experienced folks are being hired by the new companies so
quickly that it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd experienced replacements,” he
points out. “Service companies have been especially hard hit
by this problem, as major companies are hiring the better service company employees, which leaves them in a continuous
training mode.”
Educating and training their employees, as well as the education of regulators and those using these services and supplies, should be of the utmost concern, Norsworthy claims.

The lack of qualiﬁed personnel is having an impact on construction of new pipelines, according to Barden.
“In the new construction business, the demand for new
pipelines is certainly stretching the industry beyond its existing
capacity,” he says.” The big issue is a shortage of skilled labor
rather than equipment.”
Bubenik believes that industry can keep up with growing
demand for skilled workers, “but only through well-planned recruitment, training, and retention programs.
“The workforce is aging, and there is ﬁerce competition for
talent. It is important to recruit, train, and retain this talent in
order to be able to continue to supply the best possible service
to our customers and keep up with growing demands.
“It is also important to transfer the knowledge and experience gained by more-experienced staff members to less-experienced staff members.”

“I see companies ignoring the real causes of external corrosion, while embracing certain technology
that only allows the problem to continue. In some
cases, companies simply do not want to spend
the money and time to correct the external corrosion problems before they require more expensive
repairs, leaks, or more serious complications.”
— Richard Norsworthy, Polyguard Products

Other capacity concerns
Beyond the human element, there
remain other concerns about capacity of the pipeline protection
service and supply industry, especially given an outlook for growing
demand for new pipeline mileage,
while simultaneously trying to address the heightened emphasis on
pipeline integrity and safety of the
existing aging infrastructure.

RECOVERY METHODS

™

September 30 – October 2, 2008
Hilton Fort Worth
Fort Worth, Texas USA

THE RETHINKING CONTINUES
By rethinking recovery methods, producers have brought to a hungry market gas from reservoirs once considered economically and
technically impossible. Tight sands, shales, and coalbeds now represent large and growing sources of an essential form of clean energy.
But they’re still unconventional. The reservoirs are complex. The costs of drilling into and completing
wells in them are high and rising. They present unique environmental problems.
Producing gas from unconventional reservoirs proﬁtably, safely, and in amounts demanded by the
market requires continuous rethinking – the kind of thinking that shoves back limits on what’s possible
with gas supply.
Rethinking of recovery methods will continue Sept. 30 – Oct. 2, 2008, at the Unconventional Gas
International Conference & Exhibition at the Hilton Fort Worth in Fort Worth, Texas. Planned by editors
of Oil & Gas Journal and an advisory board of industry experts, the event will highlight innovation
from unconventional gas plays around the world. It will be your chance to meet and learn from other
professionals in the fastest-growing sector of the gas-producing industry.
So mark your calendar.

This year’s Guide once again offers a broad and diverse array of upstream, midstream, and downstreamapplicable products and services. It presents, cross references, and indexes products and services by
petroleum application as well as product/service type. Sections include major oil and gas categories of exploration/development, drilling/production reﬁning, petrochemical, and gas processing — with additional
emphasis on a large number of related services. As always, complete company information, contacts, and
websites data are provided.
Once again, special acknowledgement is due PennWell’s Nashua New Hampshire-based Buyers’ Guide
Group. Without their tireless, diligent, focused, disciplined, and accurate attention to detail — this Guide
would not highlight nearly 1,000 companies from 31 countries with its 4,000+ listings.

without regard to decreased sulfur
capacity, variable gas flow, or changes
in H 2S load — without any adjustment to
the system. With LO-CAT, you get the
increased sulfur capacity you need, with
lower capital costs, lower operating costs,
and guaranteed chemical consumption.

Advanced V-Cone Flow Meters for FPSO Vessels, Offshore Platforms & Sub-Sea Production
McCrometer’s V-Cone is an advanced flow meter that takes
differential pressure flow measurement to a new level. The
V-Cone has proven its performance in the oil/gas industry in
some of the harshest operating conditions and for a wide variety
of fluid types. In these applications, the V-Cone consistently
outperforms traditional DP devices, such as orifice plates and
venturi tubes, and other technologies.

The V-Cone offers a number of unique advantages
that include:
• High accuracy: up to ±0.5% of reading and 0.1% repeatability
• Handles high turndowns of 10:1 or greater without accuracy loss
• Space-saver design reduces straight pipe runs by up to 70%
• Testing to API 22.2 confirms V-Cone’s performance
• Measures liquid, steam or gas in challenging flow conditions,
such as swirl
• Ideal for wet gas and condensate measurement with high
repeatability
• No-moving parts sensor design rarely (if ever) requires recalibration
• Design flexibility: operates in line sizes from 0.5 to 120 inches
• Long-life with exceptionally low total cost of ownership

Pipe flow profiles are rarely ideal. Practically any change to
the piping can disturb even a well-developed flow profile.
The contoured shape and location of the cone in the
V-Cone Flow Meter overcomes this challenge by reshaping
the velocity profile upstream.
As the flow approaches the cone, the flow profile “flattens”
toward the shape of a well-developed profile -- even in
extreme flow conditions.

cone. These short vortices create a low amplitude high
frequency signal for excellent signal stability.

w w w. M c C r o m e t e r. c o m

The V-Cone’s contour-shaped cone directs the flow without
impacting it against an abrupt surface and minimizes
headloss. As a result, the beta edge of the cone is not subject
to wear by dirty fluids. Because it remains unchanged, the
V-Cone rarely, if ever, require recalibration.

The Worldwide Leader
in Level Measurement
for Liquids
The MagWave combines a highly visible magnetic
level indicator with the true level measurement of a
guided wave radar transmitter. Featuring single probe
transmitters in a standard 1.5 inch secondary chamber,
the MagWave provides the measurement capabilities
of a coaxial probe without the potential for fouling.
Redundant level control can be achieved by adding a
magnetostrictive transmitter or switches to the float
chamber.
Let K-TEK assist you with your next level measurement
solution, please call 800-735-5835 or visit
www.ktekcorp.com/ogpe

Options:
• Magnetostrictive Level • Magnetically Coupled
Transmitter (shown)
Switches
• Capacitance Level

Answer your machine

BEFORE IT KNOCKS
When your machine knocks, it’s a sign that something is wrong. Metrix Impact Transmitters provide
early detection of impacts so you can prevent knocking or shock from occurring.
These two-wire, loop-powered transmitters connect to PLC, DCS,
SCADA or other alarm systems for detection of:
* Loose rod nuts
* Cracked rods
* Broken or loose bolts
* Liquids in the process

* Loose or worn wrist pins
* Excessive clearance in slipper
* Other loose or broken parts
* High shock levels

Metrix was the rst to patent an Impact Transmitter and is a trusted
leader in quality, innovative vibration monitoring solutions.

Stop the knocking before it starts with the original Impact Transmitter!

www.metrix1.com
An ISO 9001:2000 Certied Company

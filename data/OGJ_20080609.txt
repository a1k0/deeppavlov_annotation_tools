COVER
In late May,Technip Offshore Finland Oy’s Pori yard finished
fabricating the hull of the Perdido spar.The 555-ft long, 118-ft
in diameter, 19,000-tonne hull then was loaded on a barge that
transported it to Kiewit Offshore Services Ltd.’s yard at Ingleside,
Tex., for outfitting. Once moved to Alaminos Canyon Block 857 in
the Gulf of Mexico, the Shell Offshore Inc.-operated spar, moored
in 7,817 ft of water, will receive production from Great White,
Silvertip, and Tabago fields (photo from Shell).The illustration
above shows the Petrobras PRA-1 pump platform that receives oil
from several producing fields in the Campos basin off Brazil and
then offloads the oil to tankers.The deep water off Brazil and the
Gulf of Mexico has numerous development projects under way, as
seen in OGJ’s special report on Major Upstream Projects starting
on p. 54.

Study assesses threats to oil market stability
Even as oil prices climb, threats to market stability are starting
to abate, Amy Myers Jaffe told an energy forum last month at Rice
University’s James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy in Houston.
The institute’s new study, “The Global Energy Market: Comprehensive Strategies to Meet Geopolitical and Financial Risks—The
G8, Energy Security, and Global Climate Issues,” identifies a series
of policy frameworks that can be used to strengthen the current
market system and ensure that it can respond flexibly to an array
of possible threats.
The study assesses the US economy, financial markets, resource
nationalism, terrorism, and climate change, as well as Iran’s nuclear
standoff, risk scenarios for Russian natural gas, dynamics in China
and Iraq, the militarization of energy, and growth in transportation
fuel demand.
Jaffe, an energy fellow at the Baker Institute, said the key finding in the study is that many of the risks driving today’s oil price
premium may be less catastrophic than they seem at first glance.
And to achieve energy security—here defined as reducing the vulnerability to a reduction or cut-off of energy supplies—consumers
must increase their elasticity of demand by increasing their flexibility and using alternative fuels.
Looking at cheap and available fuel supplies, the study says that
while fuel subsidies in many countries are often justified on the
grounds that they address income inequality and assist the poor,
they mostly benefit the largest consumers of oil products, who are
not society’s poorest members.
It’s in the US’s interest to work with international institutions
such as the International Monetary Fund to help oil states liberalize their domestic energy markets and begin to foster energy efficiency by easing subsidy programs, replacing them instead with
more sound fiscal policies to aid their poor, the study says.
Regarding energy security issues, the study says that consuming
countries benefit when global oil production comes from as diverse a base as possible. “Active policies that attempt to use bilateral
influence, aid, conflict resolution assistance, and other diplomatic
leverage to remove some of the barriers to investment and technology transfer to oil producers in Indonesia, Central Asia, Russia,
Asia, and Africa could dramatically reduce the pressure on oil markets in the years to come,” according to the study.

UK prime minister, oil leaders discuss challenges
UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown and his chancellor Alastair
Darling have met with oil industry leaders in Aberdeen to discuss
methods of controlling soaring fuel prices.
Brown warned that high oil prices were here to stay because
global demand was outstripping supply over the long term. Mem-

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

bers of the British legislature and the general public have called
for policy changes on road and fuel taxes to help families and to
thwart protests by the haulage industry that have disrupted traffic
and increased pressure on Brown to address the problem.
The oil group focused on how investment decisions are made
for projects on the UK continental shelf and analyzed various measures for advancing oil and gas developments and enhancing recovery from existing fields.
Oil and gas production in 2007 was 2.8 million boe/d, down
from production of 4.2 million boe/d in 2001. The UK is estimated to have as much as 25 billion boe left to produce.
Malcolm Webb, chief executive of offshore trade association Oil
& Gas UK, which met with Brown and Darling, said, “This was
a highly constructive engagement, and the proposals discussed
could have a significant impact on the near-term production. We
look forward to continuing our discussions with government to
develop these ideas.”
But the subsea operators also called on Brown to acknowledge
their contribution to developing and producing the country’s resources. David Pridden, chief executive of Subsea UK, said, “With
almost half of North Sea production now coming from subsea
wells, the subsea sector has a significant role to play in more efficiently extracting the remaining hydrocarbons in the UKCS.”
Pridden said more government support was needed for the offshore industry, which he said could add “a further 10-15%” of
reserves from the UKCS in the next few years, “i.e., a further 2-3
billion boe.” Last year the UK subsea industry generated £4.3 billion in revenues.
Brown wants the issue of high oil prices on the agenda for the
Group of Eight summit in Japan. He’s also pressing the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase its production.
The Department for Business, Enterprise, and Regulatory Reform (BERR), which grants licenses for the UK North Sea, has
unveiled changes in its licensing regime to increase production.
Secretary of State John Hutton said another 20,000 b/d of peak oil
could be produced from 30 fields that would be created by carving
them out from unprofitable areas of some existing fields.
“The change will mean production from these new fields would
be unaffected by Petroleum Revenue Tax,” BERR said.
BERR received 193 applications covering 277 blocks in its 25th
Offshore Licensing Round, the highest number since 1974. The
round closed on May 22. The government has also just launched
97 new licenses—a record number—through the 13th Onshore
Round.
A spokeswoman from OGUK told OGJ that the association has
been talking to the Treasury for the past year seeking reform of
the tax regime to attract investment. Talks are expected to close
by the end of June. “We have been looking at targeted incentives

That’s how much U.S. oil and natural gas companies
spent in 2006 drilling and equipping new wells. But
you already knew that because you subscribe to API’s
Joint Association Survey (JAS) on Drilling Costs. After
all, it’s the only long-term source of information on
detailed U.S. drilling expenditures. So you already
figured that in to your big presentation you gave to
the Board, right?

UK announces winners of onshore licenses
The UK government has awarded 54 companies onshore licenses in its 13th licensing round designed to encourage investment in
the mature basin.
It awarded 97 petroleum exploration and development licenses
to a variety of independent companies, including Northern Petroleum, Providence Resources, and IGas.
Northern Petroleum will operate PEDL240 in partnership with
EnCore Oil on Blocks SZ38 South and SZ48 West South on the Isle
of Wight.
Operator Providence Resources and its partner NP Weald will
examine the Baxter’s Copse oil discovery and the Burton Down
exploration prospect on Block SU91.
IGas, a coalbed methane developer in the UK, will explore seven
blocks in northwestern England with its partner Nexen Exploration
UK. The acreage is within 15 km of existing drilling operations.
Egdon Resources was offered six licenses covering eight blocks
or partial blocks in the round in the East Midlands and Wessex
basin. They expand the company’s acreage and opportunity base
within core areas.
The government awarded Europa Oil & Gas an exploration license in North Lincolnshire. Europa will operate the license and
hold a 50% working interest; Valhalla Oil & Gas Ltd. will hold the
remainder.
The block is in the Humber basin, which contains Europa’s
Crosby Warren oil field and the 90 bcf Saltfleetby gas field. One
well has been drilled on the license area to date.

cessfully appraised Hess Corp.’s 2006 Pony discovery in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
The Pony-2 sidetrack, drilled from a surface location 7,400 ft
northwest of the discovery well, encountered the same objective
Miocene sands as the Pony-1 and Pony-2 wells. The main pay sand
was oil filled throughout the interval drilled.
Hess is evaluating development concepts before making a final
investment decision for Pony, which it now says has 200 million
boe recoverable and is 100% owned by the company. It had previously estimated 100-500 million boe.
The acreage, just north of the Knotty Head area, is in 800-1,599

New Brunswick gas shale under evaluation
Corridor Resources Inc., Halifax, NS, plans a $32 million program this year and next to step up economic assessment of the
Mississippian Frederick Brook shale near Elgin, NB.
Corridor will drill three widely spaced vertical wells on 2D seismic to obtain log and core data for full analysis followed by a horizontal well with a lateral as long as 1,000 m in the most prospective part of the shale and multiple fracs in all wells. It plans a 65 sq
km 3D seismic program over the most promising area.
Corridor’s Elgin licenses, excluding McCully field area holdings,
cover 118,000 acres.
Meanwhile, the company has a $14.4 million plan to drill a
horizontal development well to the overlying Hiram Brook sands
in northeastern McCully field and horizontal wells in the Hiram

Shell launches Perdido spar production facility
Royal Dutch Shell PLC is transporting by barge its enormous
Perdido spar production facility from the shipyard in Pori, Finland,
to Ingleside, Tex., to prepare for installation in the ultradeep Gulf
of Mexico on Alaminos Canyon Block 857.
Perdido, which has the capacity to produce 130,000 boe/d, will
float on the surface in nearly 8,000 ft of water. “The spar will be
secured in place by nine chain and polyester rope mooring lines,
spanning an area of the seafloor roughly the size of downtown
Houston,” Shell said. Production will start by 2010.
On the Alaminos Canyon seafloor, 22 wells, each drilled to
more than 14,000 ft below the water’s surface, will be linked to the
Perdido spar above. Oil will be brought to the surface against the
extreme pressure of the deep water by 1,500-hp electric pumps,
and gas will be separated on the sea floor to rise naturally to the
production unit on the surface.
“The remotest producing platform in the entire Gulf of Mexico
region, Perdido will float 220 miles from Galveston, Tex., and will

provide living quarters for 150 industry personnel. The helicopter
landing deck also will set new industry records, simultaneously accommodating two long-range Sikorsky S92 helicopters, each holding as many as 24 passengers and crew,” the company said.
Shell, the 35% shareholder of the Perdido Regional Development Spar, is operator on behalf of partners BP PLC 27.5% and
Chevron Corp. 37.5%.

Gupco starts output from Egypt’s Saqqara ﬁeld
Gulf of Suez Petroleum Co. is delivering more than 30,000 b/d
of oil from offshore Egyptian Saqqara field in the Gulf of Suez and
will start gas production shortly.
Saqqara is 12.5 m in the central Gulf of Suez and was discovered
in mid-2003 (OGJ Online, May 13, 2005).
The technically complex field was developed via a jacket and
unmanned topsides, four wells, and a 13 km pipeline to a new
dedicated onshore separation and gas processing plant at Ras
Shukeir, Gulf of Suez.

StatoilHydro lets contracts for reﬁnery simulator

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

StatoilHydro has let a contract to Honeywell International Inc.
for a plant process simulator and operator training system that will
be used at the company’s Kalundborg refinery in Denmark.
The refinery is Denmark’s largest, with an annual throughput
capacity of 5.5 million tonnes of oil, and its oldest dating back to
the early 1960s.
The new simulator, using Honeywell’s trademarked simulation
technology, will be installed in three phases, with final delivery
planned for yearend 2009. StatoilHydro will use the simulator to
train new plant operators and provide refresher courses and selftraining modules.
The simulator also will be used as a design, development, and
implementation platform for advanced process control in order to
improve operational efficiency at Kalundborg.
In addition, Honeywell will supply tools that allow process and
system data to be imported into the simulator, thereby supporting
alignment with any future configuration changes at the refinery.
The value of the deal was not reported.

phases. It will have an initial design capacity to process 77,000 b/d
of bitumen blend, with two subsequent 77,000 b/d expansions
planned for the future.
Site preparation has begun for the $2.4 billion first phase. All
three phases are expected to be operating by 2016.
UOP LLC, Des Plaines, Ill., was awarded design and licensing of
a hydroprocessing unit for the facility (OGJ, Aug. 15, 2005, Newsletter). This integrated distillate Unionfining and Unicracking unit
will produce a synthetic crude oil blend. It will have parallel reactors for hydrotreating naphtha and distillate-range feedstock and
partial conversion hydrocracking of distillate and vacuum gas oilrange feedstock. A common section will stabilize reactor effluent
and compress recycle gas.
“An important element of [the upgrader is its] use of gasification to make hydrogen from the heaviest components of the bitumen, and its carbon capture-ready design,” said North West.
The company also said it has concluded a commercial arrangement to sell carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery, thereby sequestering most of its greenhouse gas emissions.

North West Upgrading awards LCFining prefab

Aramco taps Axens for Jubail reﬁnery units

Privately owned North West Upgrading Inc., Calgary, has awarded KBR a $275 million (Can.) contract to construct and fabricate
an LCFining processing system for the heavy-oil upgrader it is
building 45 km northeast of Edmonton in Sturgeon County, Alta.
KBR will prefabricate 40 modules to be assembled later. This
phase of the project is expected to take 30 months.
The LCFining technology is being supplied by Chevron Lummus Global LLC (CLG)—a 50-50 joint venture of Chevron USA
Inc. and ABB Lummus Global. CLG is providing the engineering
package, including reactor design, follow-up technical support
during detailed engineering design, training prior to start-up, ICR
catalysts, and start-up support during commissioning of the upgrader (OGJ, Nov. 27, 2006, Newsletter).
The upgrader, which will produce light, low-sulfur products
such as ultralow-sulfur diesel and diluent, will have a total processing capacity of 231,000 b/d of blended feedstock over three

Saudi Aramco and Total SA have awarded a contract to Axens,
Paris, to design a 32,000 b/d vacuum gas oil fluid catalytic cracker
and other units for the planned 400,000 b/d refinery in Jubail,
Saudi Arabia.
Aramco and Total recently confirmed plans to construct the refinery under a joint venture company, whereby Aramco will supply Arabian heavy crude and both companies will share marketing
responsibilities.
Axens will also produce an aromatics complex with a capacity
of 700,000 tonnes/year of paraxylene and 143,000 tonnes/year
of benzene. The refinery will start operations in 2012.
Axens said the technology suite comprises a 68,000 b/d naphtha hydrotreater and continuous catalytic regeneration reformer to
produce gasoline blend stock and mixed xylenes.
The FCC unit is designed to produce more than 10 wt % propylene. ✦

Petrobras plans ethanol export pipelines
Jose Sergio Gabrielli, president of Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras), said the state-owned firm plans to have its first ethanol pipeline operating by yearend 2009.
“We are currently working on several phases of this pipeline
and believe that the first phases should be operating by the end of
2009,” said Gabrielli, who explained that the line is part of a larger
export strategy.
“Petrobras has a very clear strategy of becoming a great international player in the trade and logistics of ethanol,” he said. “We
are establishing an export program, mainly to Japan, establishing
logistics chains to take the product from the new areas to ports,
through two large ethanol pipelines.”
Petrobras announced plans to construct the two lines last year:
an ethanol line from Goias state to Sao Sebastiao, Sao Paulo state
port, and a line for both ethanol and biodiesel, to run from Cuiaba,
Mato Grosso, to Paranagua in Parana state (OGJ, June 11, 2007, p.
31).
Of the two, Gabrielli said this week, the most advanced is the
$1 billion, 1,150-km line that will connect Senador Canedo in the
state of Goias to the Paulinia Terminal in the state of Sao Paulo.
The line will pass through the cities of Uberaba, Ribeirao Preto,
Guararema, and Sao Sebastiao, as well as the Ilha d’Agua terminal
in Rio de Janeiro. The project also includes a stretch connecting the
Tiete-Parana Waterway to the Paulinia Terminal.
The project is based on a joint venture agreement signed between Petrobras, Mitsui & Co., and Brazilian construction company Camargo Correa, creating PMCC Ethanol Transport Projects SA
(OGJ, Mar. 24, 2008, Newsletter).
Regarding the second planned line, connecting Cuaiba and
Paranagua, Brazilian Energy Minister Edison Lobao announced
in March the development of viability and environmental impact
studies.
The studies, to be undertaken by Petrobras and technicians
from the states of Mato Grosso do Sul and Parana, are expected to
be completed in June 2008.
Meanwhile, in April, Brazil Renewable Energy Co. (Brenco) said
it plans to invest $1 billion to build a 1,100-km, 4 million l./year
ethanol pipeline extending from Alto Taquari in Mato Grosso state
to Santos—the country’s largest port—in Sao Paulo state on the
country’s south Atlantic seaboard (OGJ Online, Apr. 29, 2008).

Pipeline would ship gas from Bakken play
A proposed 100-mile, 16-in. pipeline in northwestern North
Dakota would transport associated gas from the Mississippian-Devonian Bakken oil play in the Williston basin.
Capacity would be 100 MMcfd expandable to double that volume. The pipeline would be in service in mid-2010 subject to
shipper commitment and regulatory approvals, said Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Co., a subsidiary of MDU Resources Group
Inc. affiliate WBI Holdings Inc. An open season is to run from June
16 through July 11.
The Bakken pipeline would originate at an interconnect with
Williston Basin’s existing pipeline in Mountrail County, ND, near
10

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Tioga, and extend to the Alliance Pipeline in Bottineau County.
The pipeline will provide producers the option to deliver certain natural gas liquids out of the Bakken play in Montana and
North Dakota, reduce gas processing requirements, and provide
market opportunities for NGLs that do not currently exist.

FERC authorizes Rockies Express for REX-East line
The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authorized
Rockies Express Pipeline LLC to construct and operate its planned
1.8 bcfd REX-East interstate natural gas pipeline. REX-East will have
a 42-in. OD and extend 639 miles from the eastern terminus of
Rockies Express’ REX-West pipeline in Audrain County, Mo., to an
interconnection with the Dominion Transmission Inc., Dominion
East Ohio, and Texas Eastern Transmission LP pipelines at the Clarington Hub in Monroe County, Ohio.
The REX-East project also will entail the construction of two
compressor stations on Rockies Express’ already existing facilities;
one in Carbon County, Wyo., the other in Phelps County, Neb.
REX-East is the third leg of a project to bring Rockies gas to
Midwestern and Eastern markets. REX-Entrega, which extends 327
miles from Colorado and Wyoming to the Cheyenne Hub in Weld
County, Colo., at a capacity of as much as 1.1 bcfd, entered service
Feb. 14, 2007. REX-West consists of 717 miles of pipeline between
the Cheyenne Hub and Audrain County, Mo., with a capacity of as
much as 1.5 bcfd, Its first 503 miles entered service in January at a
rate of 1 bcfd (OGJ, May 12, 2008, p. 68), with the balance authorized for service on May 16.
FERC ordered work on REX-East to be completed in time for the
pipeline to enter service within 18 months.

Independence Trail pipeline resumes operations
Enterprise Products Partners LP has completed repairs to the
flex-joint assembly of the Independence Trail natural gas pipeline,
the source of a leak that occurred Apr. 8, and had forced production
to be halted since. Dive teams successfully replaced the flex-joints’
o-ring gasket. Initial test results showed the flex-joint operating
normally.
The flex-joint, in about 85 ft of water, allows the pipeline to
withstand movements of the Independence Hub platform. Reduced volumes began moving through the line while final testing
was under way, with the pipeline’s 1 bcfd full capacity expected to
be reached during the first half of June.
The gas trading community had been expecting a mid-May restart of the pipeline and production hub, consistent with the outside edge of Enterprise’s own initial predictions that service would
be restored in 1-4 weeks. However a mid-May announcement that
repairs would take until mid-June prolonged the current gas price
upsurge, which began in September 2007 (OGJ Online, May 14,
2008).
Independence Hub, stationed in Mississippi Canyon Block 920
in 8,000 ft of water, produces its 1 bcfd from 10 initial anchor
fields. The 24-in. Independence Trail pipeline extends 134 miles on
the seafloor from the hub to an interconnect with Tennessee Gas
Pipeline at West Delta Block 68. ✦

WITH RIGHT

QUESTIONS
IT’S A STATEMENT OF THE OBVIOUS, BUT IN
OUR EXPERIENCE, IT’S ONE THAT OFTEN GETS
OVERLOOKED – PARTICULARLY WHEN THE
QUESTIONS BEING TACKLED MAY BE HIGHLY
COMPLEX. OUR GETTING TO THE HEART OF
SOMETHING COMES FROM BEING ABLE TO
PUT TOGETHER AN INTEGRATED TEAM FROM
DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS – ONE THAT
SPECIALISES IN ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS.
THIS PRETTY MUCH SUMS UP HOW WE
WORK, BOTH AMONG OURSELVES AND WITH
OUR CLIENTS.

Attention to cost
As lawmakers debated whether to raise US
energy prices last week, a new government report
reminded Americans how much governmental
misjudgment costs. The Senate began deliberation of the Climate Security Act, a complex bill
that would cap emissions of greenhouse gases and
foster trading of emission allowances. That the
measure should come up while energy prices are
setting records and the economy is tottering testifies to the political influence of fear about global
warming. That serious people think the US might
implement an aggressive cap-and-trade scheme
without hurting energy consumers testifies to the
power of alarmist propaganda.
In April, the US Energy Information Administration estimated costs of the legislation: motor
gasoline prices higher than a reference-case forecast by 22-49¢/gal in 2020 and by 41¢-$1.01/
gal in 2030; average annual, nontransport energy bills up $30-325/household in 2020 and
$76-723/household in 2030. EIA estimated the
measure would lower US gross domestic product
during 2009-30 by $444 billion-1.308 trillion
(0.2%-0.6%).

Who pays?
Most Americans probably don’t want their government to raise energy costs and limit economic
growth. But many Americans apparently think—
erroneously—that “cap-and-trade” means someone else pays. While external factors certainly are
at work, much of the extraordinary elevation in
prices of oil products relates to costs of past such
action—and inaction—by the federal government.
Large in the category of inaction is leasing of a
small part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
in Alaska. Thought to contain the largest untested
onshore structures in the US, the ANWR coastal
plain encompasses a resource estimated by the US
Geological Service at 5.7-16 billion bbl of technically recoverable oil, with a mean value of 10.4
billion bbl.
ANWR is an old story and, in view of recent
stresses, a sad one. The coastal plain resource
can’t be assessed until it’s drilled, and it can’t be
drilled until it’s leased, which requires approval by
Congress, which isn’t considering it. Along with
moratoriums on the leasing of 85% of federally
owned offshore, ANWR embodies consistent US
20

refusal to act against environmental opposition on
behalf of energy supply.
Last month, responding to a request by Sen. Ted
Stevens (R-Alas.), EIA produced a report showing
what the US may be missing. The report surmises
ANWR production on the basis of each USGS
resource estimate, assuming coastal-plain leasing is
approved this year and production starts 10 years
hence.
Under the USGS mean estimate, EIA projects
that ANWR production would peak in 2027 at
780,000 b/d. Cumulative production during
2018-30 would be 2.6 billion bbl. The boost to
domestic supply, EIA estimates, would cut the cumulative US expenditure on foreign oil during the
period by $202 billion (2006 dollars). The extra
supply would lower the price of light, sweet crude
from reference-case projections by a maximum
75¢/bbl in 2025.
Benefits like these might now be in full force
if Congress had approved ANWR leasing 20 years
ago. It was then, in fact, as close as it had been in
years to doing so. But the Exxon Valdez oil spill in
March 1989 spoiled the politics. A shipping accident thus thwarted leasing and whatever oil and
gas supply might have resulted.

Governmental habit
Opponents to ANWR leasing will say EIA’s projections are too small to warrant risks to the bleak
coastal plain. They’re the same politicians and
interest groups who make similar claims while opposing leasing off the East and West Coasts. They’re
the politicians and groups arguing in Washington,
DC, last week that the US must implement sacrificial warming precautions that might not affect
global average temperature at all. Their cumulative triumph is a governmental habit of erring on
the side of environmental caution and ignoring
costs—including those of forgone supply—in
decisions ranging from fuel chemistry to federal
permitting.
Decisions made this way add costs in steps that,
viewed in isolation, can seem minor. Yet the accumulated effects constitute a large and overlooked
part of the economic load now crushing fuel
consumers. Congress needs to change its decisionmaking habits. Environmental protection shouldn’t
mean economic strangulation. ✦

2006, pp. 33-59), but not on the issue
of this multiple.4
Similar claims are made regarding crude oil futures trading. NYMEX
in 2006 said: “The futures contract is
the most liquid trading instrument for
crude oil, with daily trading volume
averaging the equivalent of 230 million
bbl of crude, approximately three times
physical daily output.”
The multiple of three
times appears to refer
to total global crude oil
production, not just that for the US.5
These large multiples are presented
by participants from both sides of the
energy market manipulation debate.
On the one hand, it is argued that the
multiples indicate a high degree of
liquidity that helps lower the costs faced
by participants in the physical markets,
who are interested in both risk mitigation and price discovery services.
On the other hand, it is argued that
these multiples have the appearance, or
are given the appearance, of hedge ratios,
and hedge ratios of these magnitudes
are quite unlikely to be optimal. Optimal hedge ratios rarely exceed a value
of one, so a multiple of, say, 12, assessed
in terms of hedge ratios, would likely
suggest excessive, nonoptimal trading.
These multiples are not hedge ratios and
should not be interpreted as such.
The multiples are argued to be
indicative of the excessive amount
of energy trading activity carried out
in the energy markets by noncommercial parties (often referred to as
speculators or, more recently, as a lump
called hedge funds), which subject the
markets to manipulation. Each of these
positions is wrong.
The cited large trading multiples are
devoid of meaning and are the result of
miscalculation. The multiples amount to
comparing the average daily consumption to quantities to be delivered over
the next 3,100 plus days. Comparing
1 day to 3,100 days clearly violates the
“apples-to-apples” analyses that would
carry economic and common sense
meaning.
However, since these claimed mul-

tiples in the energy markets are repeatedly introduced into the policy debate
regarding the role of speculators, and
the potential for increased prices and
price volatility, the basis for the calculations should be analyzed and corrected
where wrong.
If observations regarding the relation
between futures trading and physical
usage are to provide meaningful input
into new policy development, they
must be based on correct analysis. And
a correct analysis of these relationships
shows that futures trading volumes
actually account for only a fraction of
physical usage.

The numbers
The multiples are typically calculated by converting the total volume of
contracts traded for the commodity of
interest on a given day (or an average
or maximum for some time period)
into the units used to discuss consumption of the underlying commodity. For
example, gas is discussed in terms of
daily consumption in billions of cubic
feet. A single gas futures contract on the
NYMEX represents 10,000 million btu.
At 1,000 btu/cu ft, a single contract accounts for 10 MMcf of gas, or 0.01 bcf.
Oil is discussed in terms of barrels
per day, with daily usage in millions of
barrels per day, and each NYMEX oil
contract represents 1,000 bbl.
A summary of US average daily oil
and gas usage in 2007 is reported in
section 1a of Table 1 along with a summary of the daily trading volumes for
futures contracts on the NYMEX for oil
and gas. Section 1a of Table 2 reports
similar information for 2008 through
May 20.
The average oil consumption is typically stated as about 18 million b/d.
The “correct” number to use for the
average daily crude oil consumption is
not a simple issue. The refinery feed in
the US is about15-16 million b/d, but
the futures contracts on the NYMEX are
employed to hedge positions beyond
just the US. Global crude oil use currently is about 87 million b/d, but not
all of that will attract hedging interest

through the NYMEX contract.
The units specified by each contract
imply that the highest trading volume
for oil in any single day during 2007,
for all contracts open, amounted to 880
million bbl. When this total trading
volume number is used, it includes
contracts covering maturities through
December 2016—roughly 3,130 days
into the future.
Average gas consumption amounts to
about 64 bcfd. For gas, the highest daily
futures trading volume represents 2,230
bcf. The average trading amounted to
485 million b/d of oil and 1,200 bcfd
of gas. These daily values are reported in
the first three rows of Table 1a.
The results of the “typical” method
used to compare the futures traded
volumes with physical use are shown
in rows 4 and 5, where on average
this method suggests that 27 times
the physical use of oil is traded on the
NYMEX and 19 times for NYMEX gas.
The maximum trading volumes lead to
calculations of 49 times and 35 times
for oil and gas, respectively.
As noted, this approach compares
the average consumption for a single
day to traded volumes for delivery over
more than 3,100 days.
Alternatively, we may calculate the
relationship between futures trading
volume for the near-month (spot)
contract to that of the average daily use
volumes, and these figures are reported
in rows 8 and 9. This approach suggests
multiples of 13 for oil and 9 for gas for
2007. This approach shows significantly
reduced multiples for both traded commodities.
Nevertheless, while this analysis has
adjusted the focus to the near-month
contract, where just under 50% of the
daily trading activity typically occurs,
this approach is still deeply flawed
and produces misleading, meaningless
results, because we have simply traded
a comparison of one day to 3,100 days
for one day versus 30 days—still not
“apples-to-apples.” This still does not
reflect actual traded futures contract
characteristics.

Alternative methodology
The trading activity each day for
gas and oil futures contracts, as well
as that for gasoline and heating oil,
is for delivery over an entire month,
not any one specific day. For example,
near-month futures contracts traded
during any trading day in May—up to
the last trading day, which differs across
commodities—are for quantities of the
commodity to be delivered throughout
the month of June.
The last trading day for the crude oil
contract is the third business day prior
to the 25th calendar day of the month
before the delivery month.
For natural gas, the last trading day is
3 business days before the first business
day of the delivery month.
For gasoline and heating oil, the
last trading day is the last business day
of the month preceding the delivery
month.
To gain meaningful insight into the
relative volumes traded under futures
contracts relative to actual physical
requirements or consumption, the daily
volumes of the commodity represented

divided by the number of days in the

trading volume representing contracts
that account for 13 times the daily
usage, but for delivery into a month
consisting of 30 days, actually implies
trading activity that represents just 43%
of the requirements for that month.

The large multiples, therefore, are an
artifact of aggregating the trading volume
for all contracts traded on a given day,
including those for many months and
years into the future. The analysis of the
near-month trading activity, the month
that typically carries the largest trading
volume, results in much smaller multiples, but these values also fail to reflect
the actual nature of the trading activity.
Sections 1b and 2b of Tables 1 and 2
report values for near-month contracts
for delivery into a 30-day month. The
volumes in rows 10 and 11 are derived
by dividing the corresponding volumes
in rows 6 and 7 by 30. It is immediately
obvious that large multiples of the physical commodity usage in the US are not
represented by the daily traded volumes
on the futures exchange when both are
put in comparable terms—when apples
are being compared to apples.
Even if the highest volume trading
day is evaluated for either commodity
during 2007, the volumes of the underlying commodity accounted for by the
traded contracts amount to 93% of the
daily usage for oil and just 50% of the
daily usage for gas.
The average daily futures trading activity during 2007 represented volumes
of roughly 44% of actual daily usage for
oil and 29% for gas. For 2008, through
May 20th, the averages are 51% for oil
and 38% for gas.

Assessment
These results do not support the
large multiples typically claimed, but
they also do not suggest that the futures
trading activity represents an insignificant share of the market. To assess the
significance of futures trading activity
it is also useful to observe the open
interest associated with the near-month
contract.
The open interest on futures contracts represents the number of contracts, and therefore the volumes of the
underlying commodity, that are active
and still constitute obligations on the
part of buyers and sellers.
According to NYMEX, “The exchange’s core energy contracts...stipulate physical delivery, although deliveries usually represent only a minuscule
share of trading volume—less than 1%
for energy—overall.” That a very small
share of the traded volumes goes to
delivery is not indicative of speculation.
The majority of contracts (i.e., open
interest) are held by commercial traders
who are likely hedging the price risk
they face on the physical units bought
or sold in separate transactions.6
By itself, trading volume for futures contracts provides only a partial
picture because trading volume may
add to, decrease, or leave unchanged
the number of open contracts. Thus, a
more complete picture is gained by also
examining the volumes of the commodity represented by the open interest

mum open interest
represents average
daily volumes of
60 bcf.
These open
interest positions,
therefore, represent roughly 82%
of the average
daily usage for
oil and 94% for
gas. These clearly
account for a
substantial share
of the US physical
commodity market that underlies
the futures market.
Comparable values
for 2005 show
50% for both
commodities. Because open interest
is the measure of
market activity
that represents positions held open,
one interpretation
of this change is
that the energy
sector is hedging a
larger share of its
exposure in 2007
and 2008 than it
was in 2005.

positions in the futures market.
Tables 3 and 4, for 2007 and 2008,
respectively, present the average and
maximum daily open interest for the
two commodities. When assessing the
relation between near-month contract
open interest and daily usage of a commodity, it is reasonable to focus on the
maximum, rather than the average. This
is because open interest, by definition,
rises and falls during the life of the contract, beginning at zero just before the
contract is listed for trading and declining back to zero at the maturity of the
contract. The maximum open interest
typically occurs during the near-month
28

trading period. The open interest for the
near-month contract is also typically the
largest for any traded contract maturity,
just as is the case for futures contract
trading volume.
For oil, the maximum open interest
for a near-month contract during 2007
was 442,000 contracts, and for gas it
was 181,350 contracts. These maximum
open interest positions represent 442
million bbl of oil and 1,814 bcf of gas.
Because these volumes were for delivery
over an entire month, on a 30-day
month basis the oil maximum open interest represents average daily volumes
of 15 million bbl, and the gas maxi-

Modernization Act, oil open interest increased by nearly 230%, while gas open
interest increased by more than 150%.
Trading volumes in these energy futures
markets have grown commensurately.
Placing trading volume in the context of the open interest positions may
be instructive as an indicator of what
may or may not be excessive trading.
On a monthly basis, for 2007 the total
trading volume relative to the average daily open interest for near-month
(the most active contract) oil was 20
trades/month. Because typically there
are about 21 trading days/month, this
implies fewer than 1 trade/day relative
to open interest. For gas the comparable
number is 17 trades/month. The values
for 2008 through May 20 are 22 and
16 trades/month, respectively.
Price discovery occurs only through
transactions and trades that allow the
market to incorporate new information
into the price. While there is no unambiguous theoretical number of trades
that could be designated as excessive, 1
trade/day does not seem excessive for
the purpose of providing both price
discovery and liquidity in the market.

Speculators dominating?
It frequently is said that in recent
times speculators have taken over the
market. They are said to dominate
otherwise commercial traders in the
market. This is not the place to argue the
importance of the role of speculators
who bring liquidity to the market and
reduce the cost of risk mitigation faced
by hedgers.
Without these participants it is likely
that energy prices would be even higher
due to higher costs associated with risk

mitigation if such mitigation services
were still available. However, it is worth
a few words to correct the image of an
overwhelming speculator class in these
trading activities.
CFTC produces weekly reports on
the activities of all futures exchanges
under its jurisdiction, differentiated by
trader type. Figs. 2a and 2b report open
interest for oil and gas traded on the
NYMEX for the 2000-08 (through May
20) period. The dominance in these
industries is fairly clear, even while the
roles of the traders have evolved.
Commercial traders are those
deemed to have an interest in actually acquiring the physical commodity, while noncommercial traders do
not have such an interest. Historically,
commercials have been associated with
hedgers, while noncommercials have
been associated with speculators.
Clearly, however, commercial traders
have dominated, even in the recent past
associated with the run-up in prices.
For 2000-08, as much as 53% of the
increase in long positions is attributable to commercial traders. So, more
than half of the growth on the long
side—the side typically associated with
pushing prices higher—has been from
commercial traders rather than noncommercials.
Moreover, of the 44% of the long
positions’ growth attributable to noncommercials, 20% represents one side
of an offsetting calendar spread position. This suggests that commercial participants, not the noncommercials, have
been leading the markets rather than
being whipsawed or manipulated.
Gas, shown in Fig. 2b, has had a
different evolution. While commercials

dominate the market in both long and
short open interest positions, noncommercials have been responsible here
for most growth in open interest in the
recent past.
Nevertheless, in terms of outright
long positions (those not associated
with a calendar spread), the commercials lead noncommercials with 28%
of the growth vs. 23%. Noncommercials, however, were responsible for
43% of the growth in long positions
through spread trading. However the
increased role of spread trading may
be viewed both as a representation of
increased risk aversion on the part of
noncommercials and an enhancement
of their role as liquidity providers in
the market.
Typically it is found that the volatility
of returns to a calendar spread position
is less than that for an outright position.
Therefore, increased reliance on spreads
over outrights may be seen as a shift toward safer assets. The enhanced liquidity comes from the fact that a spread
has two legs—a long and a short—but
in different maturities. That means that
a single noncommercial entering into
a spread position may provide both a
long and a short position to offset the
hedging positions of two commercials.
So one interpretation of this phenomenon is that noncommercials are
providing increased market liquidity
through a shift to lower risk positions.
We should not be introducing policies
that will diminish this type of activity.

commodity usage in trading on the

miscalculations and incorrect analyses,
which do not properly allocate the trading volumes over the delivery month.
The proper allocation of futures trading
volume over the delivery month demonstrates that this activity represents but
a fraction of the daily US oil and gas
usage, not a multiple.
The share of the average usage represented by the maximum open interest
leads to the conclusion that the energy
futures markets provide the basis for
transparent price discovery and risk
mitigation. Moreover, the number of
open interest positions provides no
indication of excessive trading. Commercial traders remain the dominant
players in these markets, and noncommercial traders appear to be providing
the liquidity that allows for both risk
mitigation at relatively low cost and
transparent price discovery.
No level of trading has been identified such that surpassing it implies a
state of excessive trading, but the results
presented herein refute claims of currently or recently excessive trading on
the energy futures exchanges. ✦

Illinois objections
to Indiana permit

US

Sen. Richard J. Durbin (DIll.) and three US House
Democrats from Illinois asked a US
Environmental Protection Agency
Region 5 official to object to a construction permit BP Products North
America Inc. seeks for its Whiting,
Ind., refinery.
Durbin and Reps. Melissa L.
Bean, Rahm Emanuel, and Janice D.
Schakowsky said in a May 30 letter to
Bharat Mathur, acting administrator
at EPA’s Region 5, they are concerned
about possible additional flaring if
the BP America division is allowed to
proceed with a $3.8 billion modernization.
The project would allow the plant
to process more Canadian heavy
crude oil and increase motor fuel
production by about 1.7 million gpd,
a BP America spokeswoman said. The
4-year project is designed to shift
crude inputs at the 405,000 b/d
refinery to 90% from 30% Canadian
heavy crude.
The Indiana Department of Environmental Management issued a
permit for the project in May which
overlooks flaring and possible increases in carbon dioxide and other
emissions above previous permit
levels, the federal lawmakers charged.

be accounted for in a US Clean Air
Act netting analysis.
That view, Durbin and the House
members said, is wrong and contrary to the federal law, which does
not allow a permitting agency to
remove a large emissions category
from its calculations entirely, to make
an unsupported assumption that
such emissions would be netted out
based on narrative assurances that the
emissions would be minimized, or to
completely exclude emissions from
unplanned events.
“The applicable regulations
expressly specify that all (not just
planned) startup, shutdown, and
malfunction emissions must be
factored into netting calculations.
Particularly in light of EPA Region 5’s
issuance of a notice to BP’s Whiting
refinery for flaring violations, we
believe that flaring at the expanded
Whiting site must be accounted for
in the permit,” the lawmakers said.

the increased regulation and transparency needed to ensure that oil markets
are functioning properly.”

‘Rampant speculation’
US House Energy and Commerce
Committee leaders said the commission’s announcement was encouraging
but fell short of what is needed. “Unfortunately, the CFTC has not proposed
how to close off the loopholes that allow commodity index funds and others
to take such massive positions that possible distort oil futures markets. The failure to corral this rampant speculation is
not only ravaging consumers, but harming businesses such as airlines, trucking, and auto manufacturers,” chairman
John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) said.
Bart Stupak (D-Mich.), who chairs
the committee’s oversight and investigations subcommittee, said the announcement was welcome but added, “There
is much more that needs to be done to
improve transparency and ensure that
futures markets are not turned into
a cash machine for speculators. Our
subcommittee is identifying the driving
forces that have caused excessive speculation in the oil markets, which has
inflated oil prices to the point that they
are no longer tied to underlying supply
and demand.”
Pete V. Domenici (R-NM), the Senate
Energy and Natural Resources Committee’s ranking minority member, said
that it was appropriate for CFTC to take
steps to increase oil market transparency and investigate whether market
manipulation is occurring. “While it
is clear that fundamental supply and
demand issues are mostly to blame for
the current high price of gasoline, it
is certainly worth examining whether
speculators are also having an impact. I
look forward to the results of this investigation, which should help Congress
decide if any legislative action on market manipulation is warranted,” he said.
Federal lawmakers have said that
some futures traders are making deals
for US crude oil commodities on
overseas markets to escape domestic

tives. It said that while it normally conducts enforcement investigations on a
confidential basis, it decided to disclose
this inquiry because of current unprecedented market conditions. Specific
aspects of the investigation will remain
confidential, it indicated.
CFTC also said it has outlined terms
under which Britain’s Financial Services
Authority (FSA) and ICE Futures Europe
will share more information about West
Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil
and other futures contracts that trade
on both New York Mercantile Exchange
(NYMEX) and ICE. While the ICE contract is a cash-settled instrument that
does not allow physical oil delivery in
the US, its price is linked to the NYMEX
contract’s settlement price, the federal
commodities regulator said.
The agreement includes expanded
information-sharing to give the CFTC
daily large trader positions in the British
WTI contract, large trader positions
for all and not just the near contract
months, near-term commitments to
supply more-detailed market end-user
identifications and improved data formats so information can be integrated
more quickly into the CFTC’s data system, and a commitment by ICE Futures
Europe to notify CFTC when traders on
the foreign exchange exceed position
levels that are established on US markets
for WTI crude oil contracts.
CFTC said that since 2006, Britain’s
FSA has supplied weekly trading information to the US regulator and daily
trading information during the final
week to facilitate rigorous oversight
of trading in related contracts on the
two countries’ exchanges, specifically
the linked crude oil contracts on both
NYMEX and ICE. It said NYMEX currently maintains about 75% of the open
interest in these contracts, while ICE
accounts for about 25%.
The increased transparency initiative
mainly involves index trading, which
CFTC said is relatively new to futures
markets. The commission said it will
use its existing special call authority to immediately begin to require

Senate to FTC, CFTC: police markets more aggressively
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Two federal regulatory agencies
are moving too timidly in response to
record crude oil prices, US Sen. Maria
Cantwell (D-Wash.) said during a Senate committee hearing on energy market manipulation and federal regulatory
regimes.
Cantwell will press both the Federal
Trade Commission (FTC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(CFTC) to regulate oil and commodity
markets more aggressively, Cantwell

said following the June 3 Commerce,
Science, and Transportation Committee
hearing, which she chaired.
She wants FTC to issue an interim
rule under the oil market investigation
and regulation authority it received
under the 2007 Energy Independence
and Security Act while it completes its
formal regulatory rulemaking process.
She also intends to continue pressuring CFTC to revoke “no action” letters
issued by its staff that allow electronic
exchanges operating outside US borders
to continue trading West Texas Intermediate crude oil and related commodi-

ties without being directly regulated,
Cantwell said. “Our oil futures markets
were substantially deregulated by CFTC
staff decisions that were made behind
closed doors,” she said in her opening
statement.

London, Dubai loopholes
Such decisions created loopholes for
exchanges based in Britain and Dubai to
continue operating in the US, Cantwell
said. “This is no different than when US
businesses take out a post office box in
the Cayman Islands to avoid US business
laws...,” she said.

Cantwell and 21 other senators
wrote CFTC on May 23 demanding that
it revoke the no-action letters and start
policing all US oil markets. The commission responded on May 29 that it
has been investigating oil markets since
December and that Britain’s Financial
Service Authority intends to supply it
with more information about trades
under its jurisdiction.
That response was unsatisfactory, she
said: “First, there are still no large speculation limits that are critical to preventing fraud, manipulation, and excessive
speculation. Second, the CFTC will not
collect the same kind of information
that it would collect from other fully
regulated exchanges. The information
will be unaudited and unverifiable. Third,
unlike fully regulated US exchanges like
[the New York Mercantile Exchange],
there are no enforcement mechanisms.
And fourth, the CFTC approach is partly
just an agreement to agree—there are
no firm commitments—so all of these
measures may not even be put in place,”
Cantwell said.
Other committee Democrats agreed
that speculation has become rampant.
Crude oil prices jumped at about the

investors moved into commodity markets, said Byron L. Dorgan (ND). Many
trades occur in unregulated, or “dark,”
markets, he said.

of the impact of speculators on crude
oil prices: George Soros, chairman of
Soros Fund Management LLC in New
York, said speculators are a factor but
declining production from maturing oil
fields and growing demand in China,
India, and other expanding economies
are bigger influences. “I find commodity index buying eerily reminiscent of
a similar craze for portfolio insurance,
which led to the stock market crash of
1987. In both cases, the institutions are
piling in on one side of the market, and
they have sufficient weight to unbalance
it. If the trend were reversed and the
institutions as a group headed for the
exit as they did in 1987, there would be
a crash,” he said.
An oil market crash is not imminent, Soros quickly added. “The danger
currently comes from the other direction. The rise in oil prices aggravates
the prospects for a recession. Only
when a recession is well and truly in
place is a decline in consumption in
the developed world likely to outweigh
other factors I have listed. That makes
it desirable to discourage commodity
index trading while it is still inflating
the bubble,” he said.

directed CFTC’s trading and markets
division in the late 1990s.
Greenberger said FTC could use the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s template to regulate oil futures
markets as aggressively as FERC regulates natural gas and electricity markets.
“All the questions FTC has asked have
been answered by FERC.” He said, “As
it is, we can’t expect regulations before
sometime this fall.”
Lee Ann Watson, deputy director of
the investigations division in FERC’s enforcement office, agreed, saying FERC’s
experience implementing authority it
received under the 2005 Energy Policy
Act to prevent manipulation in wholesale electricity and natural gas markets
might prove helpful. FERC used the
prohibited activity in Section 10(b) of
the Securities Exchange Act as a model
to provide guidance and certainty to
electricity and gas market participants
operating under the Federal Power Act
and Natural Gas Act, she said.
Gerry Ramm, president of Inland Oil
Co. in Ephrata, Wash., testifying on behalf of the Petroleum Marketers Association of America, said Congress should
push CFTC to revoke the no-action
letters, raise margin requirements for
noncommercial entities in energy commodity markets and require them to
have the ability to take physical delivery
of at least some of the product, and
greatly increase CFTC funding, which
has had to cut staff as commodity trading has grown.
Mark Cooper, research director at the
Consumer Federation of America, said,
“Large traders should be required to
register and report their entire positions
in those commodities across all markets.
Without comprehensive reporting, there
will always be room for mischief that is
out of sight of the regulator. Registration
and reporting should trigger scrutiny to
ensure the good character, integrity, and
competence of traders,” Cooper said.
“Failure to comply should result in mandatory jail terms. Fines are not enough
to dissuade abuse in these commodity
markets because there is just too much
money to be made,” he added. ✦

NGC: Lieberman-Warner bill would drive up gas demand
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
A recent study from the Natural Gas
Council concluded that legislation to
be debated this week in the US Senate
is likely to increase natural gas demand
without addressing the need for increased supply.
American Gas Association Pres. David
N. Parker was one of several council
members to respond to the study’s findings. “We take global climate change seriously and believe that natural gas will
be a key part of any effective climate
change initiative,” he said.
“Our analysis suggests that achieving
the carbon reductions required under S.
3036 [the Lieberman-Warner Climate
Security Act] requires a mix of technologies and energy sources. Our study
also found that demand for natural gas
could increase by more than 30% by
2030,” Parker said.
NGC, whose member organizations
also include the Independent Petroleum
Association of America (IPAA), Interstate Natural Gas Association of America
(INGAA) and Natural Gas Supply Association (NGSA), released its study as
two major national business organizations announced their opposition to the
bill.
Officials from the US Chamber of
Commerce and National Association of
Manufacturers separately said the bill
could lead to the loss of up to 4 million
jobs by 2030, increase electricity prices
by as much as 129% and gasoline prices
by up to 145%, and reduce the average
US household income by as much as
$6,752/year.

“The importance of offsets really

Horvath. “Congress needs to carefully
think through the role of domestic

and international offsets, because this

United States’ ability to achieve the
legislation’s carbon-reduction targets.

to meet their own carbon reductions,”
he added.
Under S. 3036, a company could
meet as much as 15% of its compliance
obligations with specified domestic
offsets, while another 15% could come
from Europe and other areas of the
world.
The study found that in addition to
driving up gas demand, the legislation
would increase electricity production
from nuclear power plants, wind, and
solar power units. The bill also includes
incentives to install carbon sequestration technology, now under research
and development, which would remove
carbon from emissions and sequester it
underground.
“Given the uncertainties surrounding new energy technologies and
implementation of the cap and trade
program, we suggest that Congress
incorporate a strong natural gas supply
and infrastructure portfolio that will allow us to achieve the goals of a climatechange bill,” INGAA Pres. Donald F.
Santa said.

Model System (referred to as NEMSNGC version). NEMS-NGC used alternative input assumptions provided by the
council.
An American Petroleum Institute
official noted that NGC’s study follows
one that API issued in May, which concluded that the legislation would likely
reduce US natural gas production.

“The business community wants to
be a leader in crafting a logical plan to
address climate change. This is why the
Chamber believes a major focus of any
climate change strategy must be the
development and rapid deployment of
new energy technologies, not burdening businesses and consumers with
new taxes,” he told reporters at a June 3
briefing.

‘Troubling questions’

No technology funds

“Taken together, the two studies raise
troubling questions,” said API policy
analyst Lou Hayden. “The high cost of
allowances could lead to less US production of clean-burning, low-carbon,
natural gas just when consumers are demanding more. The legislation appears
designed to work at cross purposes.”
API’s study, which ICF International
conducted, estimated that the cost of
allowances could lead to a US gas production decline of 12% by 2030. It also
estimated a shift overseas of 3 million
b/d of petroleum refining capacity.

While Congress has discussed addressing climate change, it has failed
to seriously fund development of the
64 nonfossil fuel technologies that
the 2005 Energy Policy Act said were
needed to address the issue, Kovacs said.
He said that the current bill, which
Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman (I-Conn.)
and John W. Warner (R-Va.) introduced
in October and Sen. Barbara Boxer (DCalif.) amended before it was brought
to the floor on June 2, does not recognize the importance of technology in
addressing global climate change.
“If we are to truly move away from
fossil fuels, we must be able to replace
these fuels with low or zero-carbon
alternatives,” Kovacs said. “A great deal
of the technology isn’t commercially
available yet, and several of these technologies don’t even exist.”
In a June 3 letter to all 100 senators,
National Association of Manufacturers
Executive Vice-Pres. Jay Timmons said
the organization and its members are
committed to reducing greenhouse
gas emissions provided any US action
is mirrored by comparable commitments by trading partners, is based on
sound science and cost-effectiveness,
and is applied equally throughout the
economy.
He said S. 3036 fails this test because its nationwide cap-and-trade
program does not pre-empt conflicting
state and local climate change laws and
regulations, imposes new requirements
without adequately protecting US competitiveness or funding research and
development of essential new technologies, and unnecessarily increases natural
gas demand, among other reasons. ✦

NGSA: US natural gas
supplies strong now,
in foreseeable future

_______

US natural gas supplies are strong
and will remain that way for the foreseeable future, according to an association of gas producers and marketers.
The amount of gas in storage is on
track to meet this year’s expected winter demand, which should help lower
prices, said Jenny Fordham, director of
energy markets and government affairs
for the Natural Gas Supply Association
(NGSA).
Fordham said that while gas production from the Gulf of Mexico has been
dropping in recent years, producers
have met consumer demand by developing new gas finds in unconventional
shale fields in Texas and in Marcellus
shale field, which stretches from New
York to West Virginia. NGSA also expects
US LNG imports to strengthen in future
years, although competition from world
demand will continue to limit imports
in the near term.
Separately, in a research report to
clients this week, Raymond James &
Associates analyst Marshall Adkins said
the bank’s gas model shows that the
US will be on the verge of shutting
in gas production—resulting in a gas
price collapse—if it experiences normal
summer weather, based on the recent
10-year average.
Raymond James expects domestic gas
production growth to continue to grow
at a 4-5 bcfd rate throughout 2008, as
drilling activity ramps up, potentially
offsetting production decline rates
for several years. “We put the odds of
a natural gas price collapse at 50%,”
the report said. “If summer weather is
warmer than normal, incremental cooling demand should eat away at storage
levels, bolstering double-digit natural
gas prices. If the weather is milder than
normal (i.e., colder than the 10-year
average), then natural gas storage could
exceed 3.65 tcf, and late summer natu-

WoodMac: Alberta oil sands triggers investment wave
The projected growth of Alberta oil
sands production, which has in place
some 1.75 trillion bbl of resources, is
triggering a wave of investments, said
Wood Mackenzie Ltd., Edinburgh.
Pipeline companies and refiners
plan to invest more than $31 billion by
2015 to export and distribute oil sands
products and to process them in the
US refining system, based on disclosed
project costs. That’s not counting investments in internal pipelines in Alberta,
the Canadian refining and upgrading
system, or undisclosed refining investment, officials said.
“Overall planned investments are
well positioned to ensure sufficient
pipeline and refinery capacity to
2015, but any delays to key pipeline
projects could result in significant
bottlenecks,” warned Lindsay Sword,
global refinery research manager for
Wood Mackenzie.
The Gateway and Texas Access pipeline developments “could determine
the destination of oils sands products
in the US and outside North America
and influence US import patterns,”
Wood Mackenzie reported. Texas Access
is a 768-mile, 30-in. diameter pipeline
system being built by Enbridge Inc. and
ExxonMobil Pipeline Co. from Patoka,
Ill., to the Texas Gulf Coast to transport
crude from the Canadian oil sands region in Alberta and from the upper US
Midwest to refiners in Nederland and
Houston, Tex.
The Gateway Pipeline is to be
built by Enbridge to transport some
400,000 b/d of oil sands crude from
near Edmonton, Alberta, to a tanker
terminal in British Columbia for shipment to China, other parts of Asia, and
to California.
42

The report forecasts that production
of synthetic crude oil and Canadian
heavy blends will grow by 2 million
b/d during 2008-15, with half to be
heavy blends. Wood Mackenzie said incremental pipeline capacity will exceed
the new supply through 2015, and new
US refinery capacity will keep pace with
the expected new volumes.

US Gulf vs. Midwest
According to the report, by 2015
only small volumes of oil sands products will reach the US Gulf, where the
vast majority of heavy oils are now
processed. “There are two reasons for
this: pipeline limitations and the new
capacity being built in the Midwest
aimed specifically at processing Canadian heavy blends,” said Agustin Prieto,
senior downstream analyst for Wood
Mackenzie and primary author of the
report. “Canadian heavy blends are only
likely to reach the US Gulf if projects
in the Midwest do not proceed as
planned,” he said.
This raises a question over future
supply of heavy crude oil in the US
Gulf, where a large number of projects are targeting the processing of
additional volumes of heavy oils, and
where there likely will be strong price
competition for Canadian heavy blends,
the report said. Pipeline investments

are focused on expanding the export capacity to Petroleum Administration for
Defense District (PADD) 2, which encompasses the US Midwest, and to the
Pacific Coast as well as expanding the
domestic US network to new markets in
the US Gulf.
“We forecast new and incremental
pipeline projects to provide an additional 2.1million b/d of capacity
between 2008 and 2015,” Prieto said.
“The majority of new refinery capacity to process Canadian heavy blends
will be located in PADD 2. Companies
are investing in processing oil sands
not only because of the new supply
but also the attractive price differential
vs. conventional light crude oils. BP,
ConocoPhillips, and Marathon lead
investment plans to process Canadian
heavy blends in US refineries: these
three companies and their JV partners
plan to invest about $13 billion by
2015,” Prieto said.
The report said Canada ranks as
having one of the world’s largest oil
reserves, behind only Saudi Arabia and
potentially Venezuela. Strong growth in
oil sands production over the past few
years has been an important contributor to global supply and has provided
the US with the prospect of a secure
source of supply from its neighbor and
ally. ✦

The Saudi view
of speculators

S

audi Arabia’s oil officials will
doubtlessly feel exonerated—if
not downright pleased—by a report
last week blaming speculators for the
steep rise in global oil prices over the
past year or two.
KBC Market Services last week said
that rather than market fundamentals, investors—who seem to brush
aside news regarding the physical oil
balance—are responsible for today’s
high oil prices.
“The greed and mismanagement
that led to the credit crisis in the US
and caused economic weakness has
spilled over to the crude markets,
with high oil prices imposing a further burden on the global economy
and leading to major concerns over
inflation,” KBC said in its Monthly
Oil Market Outlook.
KBC also took issue with some
high oil price predictions issued by
large investment banks, saying that
they helped to increase prices by
issuing bullish possible future price
ranges that seem to be based on little
more than extrapolations and herd
mentality.

At the time, Toronto’s Globe and
Mail newspaper did not seem to
take to al-Naimi’s view of things,
mocking his “expansive thoughts”
on the volatile oil market and the
“pessimists,” “gurus,” and “experts”
preaching Peak Oil that are “agitating
the speculators.”
But Newsweek magazine, writing at the same time, took a different tack: “Al-Naimi’s view has
lately been echoed by oil-company
executives and Wall Street analysts,”
the magazine said. “Indeed, hedge
funds, investment banks, program
traders, and ordinary investors have
been piling billions into oil futures,
gas options, and complicated energy
derivatives.”

Money players

Investment banks like Morgan
Stanley have made up to a quarter
of their recent profits from energy
trades, Newsweek said, citing hedgefund tracker Peter Fusaro.
“While the oil analysts polled by
Newsweek last week differ on the
extent of the impact, they all agreed
that the money players have helped

advised to exercise extreme caution in
these waters,” it warned.
Nigeria accounted for 10 of the 49
pirate attacks registered worldwide in
first-quarter 2008, making it “the number one hotspot” for piracy, IMB said.
It marked the first time in 16 years of
reporting that another country has surpassed Indonesia for that position. The
most pirate-infested zones are around
Nigeria’s economic capital, Lagos, and
in the oil-rich waters of the southern
Niger Delta.
Nigerian officials say their country
is ill-equipped to combat pirates, who
operate in the nation’s waterways with
speedboats, machine guns, and radios
to target tankers, trawlers, barges, and
other oil industry support vessels. “Between Bayelsa and Delta (two oil-rich
southern states) there are some 3,014
creeks leading to the ocean. With just
11 [operational Nigerian navy] vessels,
it’s extremely difficult to control these
zones,” said Nigerian navy spokesman
Henry Babalola.
Meanwhile, Nigerian security forces
located the MV Lourdes Tide, a supply
vessel owned by Tide Waters firm and
working for Chevron Corp. that was
hijacked May 13 by armed militants
in route from Onne in Rivers state to
Escravos in Delta in southern Nigeria.
Authorities are said to be drawing
up a strategy to free the vessel’s 11-man
crew after Chevron opposed an initial
plan by security forces to storm the

High oil, diesel prices
cause protests in Europe
Doris Leblond
OGJ Correspondent
The soaring price of diesel oil, which is jeopardizing fishermen’s already meager profits, has led to protests in France
that are spreading to Spain, Portugal, and Italy. Truckers and
farmers are joining the protest movement.
In France, the protest actions are fluctuating and sporadic.
Total spokeswoman Christine de Champeaux told OGJ that
product depots and ports are blocked for short periods and
that demonstrations occur irregularly and in varied areas.
“Refineries, she said, must take different measures to supply service stations or see that refineries are supplied despite
blocked ports. But, so far, the protests have been a hindrance
rather than doing actual harm to oil companies.” Protests are
nevertheless being monitored on a daily basis.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said he is standing by
his request that the European Union lower the value-added
taxes (VAT) on oil, a decision that requires unanimous approval of the 27 EU member countries. France’s Finance and
Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said May 29 that the EU
should be more flexible in adjusting its policies to “exceptional circumstances,” including the current soaring price of
oil.
Lagarde also asked her colleagues within the Group of
Seven richest countries to discuss the issue of high oil prices
“among consumer nations,” the outcome to be then presented to oil-producing countries.
France’s Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Michel Barnier
would like a “direct European subsidy” to keep Europe’s fishing industry alive. He said at a meeting in Brussels that the
EU should lift the ceiling on aid that a country can provide
without referring to the EU Commission. It currently allows
€30,000/fishery. Many countries, including Italy, consider
this too low.
However, there is no consensus in Brussels on this proposal; governments fear that such a subsidy would have a
domino effect on other economic areas also hit by high oil
prices.
Meanwhile regarding production increases, Total CEO
Christophe de Margerie confirmed to OGJ that he had
indeed said on a recent visit to Angola accompanying
President Nicolas Sarkozy that he “hoped that in 2-3 years”
Total would become “the leading operator on the Angolan
market” with its production reaching 700,000 b/d, up from
the current 290,000 b/d. ✦

This is the second of two parts on
the critical role of accurate seismic
velocity measurements in subsurface
imaging.
The next example illustrates the link
between the interpretation of seismic
velocity trends and geologic interpretation of subsurface depth structures.
The example is taken from the Perdido fold belt in US territorial waters.
A series of southwest-northeast trending compressional folds is the norm;
however, a nearly circular anticline is
apparent in the middle of the trend (see
Figs. 13 and 14). The central circular
structure has been drilled on its flank,

The area, including the circular

Summary
The examples presented illustrate the
power of integrating seismic velocity
information with subsurface interpretations at an early stage.
For instance, we presented an example demonstrating a lateral variation
in velocity that can be attributed to
lateral thinning of sand bodies. Hence,
using the velocity information as part
of the interpretation process can lead
to valuable insights in the lithologic
setting. Lithological information may be
extracted from simple, densely sampled,
maximum coherency seismic velocity measurements using time migrated
data, as illustrated by the subsurface
channel clearly visible in a Dix interval
velocity slice (Figs. 1 and 2).
With other examples, we demonstrated a good fit between proven hydrocarbon pay and slow seismic interval
velocities (Figs. 5, 7, and 8), suggesting
that accurate seismic velocity measurements can be used to help evaluate the
potential for pay.
The velocities slow near hydrocarbon
accumulations due to changes in rock
properties that result from the presence of hydrocarbons, and as there is
no perfect seal and the accumulation is
a dynamic system over geologic time,
areas near the pay zone may also display
slower velocities.

The time map was converted to depth vertically using a smoothed, laterally varying, velocity obtained from measurements
made in prestack time migrated data. Semblances were interpreted on a 1,000 ft by 1,000 ft spatial grid. Note that with this
smoothed, laterally varying ﬁeld, the circular anticline begins to elongate along the southwest-northeast trend similar to the
neighbor folds (Fig. 13). The Dix interval velocity is shown in color with the darker, blue colors, indicating faster velocities.

used to create Fig. 20 are shown in Fig.
21; they come from the same location
as those of Fig. 19. These depth gathers
demonstrate flatter events at the horizon
of interest, indicating that these velocities are more appropriate. Note that the
depth image shows the presence of two
folds, similar to those present in the
depth map of Fig. 17. The 2D seismic
velocity trend is similar to the time migration velocity trend—each preserved
more of the lateral variations by employing less smoothing of the velocity
data. Smoothing can be reduced simply
by sampling at finer increments, in both
time and space. The twofold concept
has not been tested as only one well has
penetrated the structure.

This conversion uses a seismic velocity that preserves detail of the 500 ft by 500 ft interpreted grid.
Outliers have been removed but this smoothing preserves shorter wavelengths variations measured in the data.
The circular time anticline has begun to split into two folds. Depth contours are shown together with the Dix
interval velocity; the red color corresponds to the slowest interval velocities.

In Fig. 8, the depth contours did not
fit the pay zone, whereas the seismic
interval slow velocity fit well. All information available, such as compaction,
burial history, well information, and
lithology components need to be taken
into account when using velocities to

identify hydrocarbon bearing targets, as
all slow velocity zones are not pay.
We demonstrated that velocity trends
are not overly sensitive to acquisition
geometry (Figs. 9-11), but the information available in the velocity field can be
lost by oversmoothing the data set (Fig.

2D PRESTACK DEPTH MIGRATION ACROSS INTEREST AREA WITH VELOCITY MODEL

Fig. 18

The velocity model is overly smoothed, and the depth gathers of Fig. 19 indicate the model does not ﬁt the data.

D EPTH GATHERS USING THE VELOCITY MODEL THAT GENERATED FIG. 18

Flatness of the gathers is a diagnostic for validation of the velocity model. A ﬂat line is used for reference.
The velocity model is unacceptable because of its poor quality; the image generated does not honor the data.

12). Here, oversmoothing can result
simply by using too gross an interval
between velocity samples, both in time
and space.
As shown by the two orthogonal
3D survey velocities, the time velocities from both surveys showed similar
50

trends, but the depth velocities used
in the depth migrations for the two
surveys varied. Valid information
was lost in one survey’s depth velocity model due to oversmoothing and
coarse sampling. Because the time and
depth velocity trends complement each

other, both types of velocity information should be examined to ensure that
valid information is preserved when
transforming between domains.
Another example from the Perdido fold belt, deepwater US Gulf of
Mexico, demonstrated the variation in
the structural picture when converting
to depth using smooth velocities vs.
finely sampled, less smoothed seismic
velocities. The depth maps that incorporated finer velocity detail better fit the
expected geologic structural features
found in the area.
In addition to impacting the imaged
structures and other attributes based
directly on seismic velocities, such as
seismic based pore pressure estimation, undersampling and smoothing of
the seismic velocity trends can lead the
interpreter to miss valuable information that should be integrated into the
interpretation.
As the examples demonstrated,
smoothing the velocity trends should
be done with care, as oversmoothing
can destroy useful information while
undersmoothing can result in unwanted
noise. The interpreter should provide
guidance on the degree of smoothing
to be used, including guidance on the
sampling intervals.
We have obtained excellent results
with dense sampling, and in critical
areas, we recommend velocity measurements be considered at every subsurface
location. Smoothing of the data should
take into account geological boundaries, loss of velocity resolution with
depth, the quality of the data, maximum recorded offset, etc.
In cases where salt or salt welds
separate younger synclinal basins from
older basins with structure, many velocity models incorrectly force the seismic
velocity to be laterally invariant across
the salt boundary by extrapolating the
young basin’s velocity into the subsalt
region. The inability to make travel time
vs. angle measurements under the salt
indicates that the problem needs to be
addressed at the acquisition stage.
If the subsalt velocity model cannot be validated by the data, this fact

The updated velocity model honors shorter velocity variations and results in properly corrected depth gathers. The depth image
shows similar structural picture independently derived by the depth map shown in Fig. 17. Essentially, the 2D PSDM seismic
velocity trend matches the time migration velocity trend that preserved more detail with ﬁner sampling and lesser smoothing.
The interval velocity color scale is the same as that used in Fig. 18. Darker colors correspond to faster interval velocities.

the 25% interest to Petro Vista.
The block, east of Cicuco oil and
gas field, has four to five large prospects identified. Drilling could start in
October.
Phase 1 of the exploration and
production contract is for 12 months
and requires reprocessing 138 line-km
of seismic data, already completed, and
drilling one exploration well to at least
5,000 ft.

WesternZagros Resources Ltd.,
Calgary, spud its Sarqala-1 wildcat in
early May on the 2,120 sq km KalarBawanoor Block in Iraqi Kurdistan.
The well, first of a multiwell program scheduled for the next 3 years, is
projected to 4,800 m to evaluate four
potential reservoirs.
Meanwhile, the company continues

to shoot seismic. By shooting more
than 1,265 line-km, it has exceeded its
seismic commitment under the production-sharing contract.
WesternZagros is operator with 40%
working interest, and it carries the
Kurdistan Regional Government for
20%. The KRG is to allocate the other
40% to a third party by August 2008.

A wide variety of oil and gas projects
will start producing in next the few
years.
The accompanying table lists projects
in 47 countries that will have a peak
production in 2008 or after. If all the
projects’ peak production rates occurred
in the same year, world production
capacity would increase by 28.5 million
b/d of liquids and 74.7 bcfd of gas.
The list includes
individual fields and in
some cases the required
infrastructure. Listed
are:
• Discoveries that
have announced publicly available development plans.
• Field redevelopments for recovering bypassed oil.
• Stranded-gas projects and projects
to eliminate gas flaring. These projects
often include new infrastructure such as
pipelines for transporting the gas to end

methane gas.
Although joint ventures operate
some projects listed in the table, for
simplification, the table only includes
name of one company in each joint
venture (see accompanying table listing
the parent companies’ full names).
The year shown in the project list is
when production may peak or enter a
peak production plateau that could last
for several years.

Asia-Paciﬁc

LNG projects continue to dominate
the Asia-Pacific region with Australia
having several. Greater Gorgon will
develop fields containing about 40 tcf
of gas. The proposed Gorgon project
will have two 5-million tonne/year
LNG trains and a domestic gas plant on
Barrow Island. The project also includes
reinjection and sequestration of carbon
dioxide on Barrow Island. Gorgon may
start shipping LNG in 2013.

DEVIN towers
over the
competition.
DEVIN's new Track Stack Coiled Tubing Drilling (CTD) Tower allows for
a viable alternative for workover rigs. This tower is conveniently rigged
up and ready for operation in under six hours with two platform levels
and guard railings meeting OSHA requirements, demonstrating
DEVIN's commitment to safety.
Versatility is the key to the Track Stack CTD Tower, whether you are
re-entering the well using coiled tubing or jointed pipe, or working with
bottom hole assemblies, the ease of deploying the necessary
equipment is what makes this tower a benefit.
The Track Stack CTD Tower contains a 10,000 lb. capacity gin pole
allowing for bottom hole assemblies to be completely assembled on
the ground and then deployed, or the swing arm crane and false rotary,
with the capability to handle tongs, can be used to make and break
jointed pipe while setting the slips. When coiled tubing is being used to
re-enter, the tower has a designated position for the injector head.
This multifunctional tower is designed to eliminate unnecessary down time
and labor intensive equipment. DEVIN remains committed to finding new
innovative ways to increase production safely and economically.

Indonesia’s largest new oil development is Banyu Urip field in the Cepu
block on Java. The field will go onstream in 2010 and the project calls for
exporting the oil from a floating storage
vessel moored off Tuban in the Java Sea.
ExxonMobil Corp. and the government of Indonesia are still discussing
terms for proceeding with the development of Natuna D-Alpha field in the
South China Sea. The field, discovered
several decades ago, contains about 40
tcf of gas. Delaying and complicating
field development is the large presence
of carbon dioxide.

India has both onshore oil and gas
discoveries. The gas off the eastern coast
will be produced through subsea-completed wells brought ashore with long
flowlines.
New projects will develop fields off
China in both the South China Sea and
Bohai Bay.
Development of gas fields in the
Southern Highlands of Papua New
Guinea includes construction of a gas
liquefaction plant. As now proposed,
gas from reserves in the PNG Southern
and Western Highlands would go to a
6.3 million tonnes/year, two-train LNG
liquefaction and storage facility near
Port Moresby. The gas would come from
Hides, Angore, Juha, Gobe, Moran, and
Kutubu fields.

Oil and gas developments continue
off the UK and Norway. Many of these
developments will tie into the extensive
existing infrastructure.
In Italy, the onshore Tempa Rossa
project will develop an estimated 200
million bbl of heavy oil reserves.

Eastern Europe, FSU
Phased development of Tengiz field,
in Kazakhstan, continues with a $9.5
expansion project that will increase oil
production by 260,000 b/d after 2010.
Also in Kazakhstan, an expansion of Karachaganak field will increase production by 1.6 bcfd in 2012.
Because of delays, the first phase
of the 13-billion bbl Kashagan field,
off Kazakhstan, is now slated to start
producing not before 2012. With future
phases, the field’s production may surpass 1 million b/d.
The largest proposed development
in Russia is the 130-tcf Shtockman field
in the Barents Sea. The first phase of the
Shtockman field may start producing
gas in 2011 at a rate 2.1 bcfd. Subsequent phases may increase production
to 8.7 bcfd in 2014-19.
Another large field under development is the 70-tcf Kovykta in eastern
Russia. Gazprom now operates the field
that will require new pipelines for moving the gas to potential users, such as in
China.

Middle East
Iran continues to develop light and
heavy oil resources, including the
phased development of the offshore
South Pars gas field, which is an extension of Qatar’s giant North field.
Iraq has been slow in developing its
considerable potential. The table lists
some of the potential fields that might
be developed, possibly with assistance
from international oil companies listed.
Kuwait continues to redevelop several fields that will increase its production capacity by 450,000 bo/d in 2012.
In Oman, several enhanced oil recovery projects will improve recovery
factors from several fields. The main

Petrobras, besides its phased development of several giant fields in the
Campos basin, also has several substantial discoveries particularly in the Santos
basin, such as Tupi and Carioca. These
new fields will add several billion bbl
of reserves and may provide oil production rates greater than 1 million b/d
when fully delineated and developed.
Although Petrobras is the main
producer in Brazil, new companies with

• $53.7 billion on development gas
wells, up 72%.
For the 19th consecutive year, companies spent more drilling for natural
gas (54%) than for oil (34%), with
12% of the total drilling spend resulting
in dry holes.
The number of wells and total footage drilled increased from 2005, pushing the average cost per well and per
foot to the highest levels ever.

5 years ago, from about 50 in secondquarter 2003, to about 500 rigs in firstquarter 2008.
The number of US rigs drilling vertical wells has decreased to about 1,300
from about 1,450 in early 2006.
Directional drilling has remained
essentially flat in the US over the last 2
years.
Overall drilling activity in Canada
has declined over the past 3 years,
driven predominantly by a 30%/year
reduction in Alberta gas drilling in the
2007-08 winter season. The drop has
been attributed to adverse changes in
currency exchange rates, lower natural gas prices, and changes in Alberta’s
royalty regime.2

Newbuilds

With 154 mobile offshore drilling
units under construction, the MODU
fleet is set to increase 22%, to 871 units
from 717 units (Table 1).

L&T plans to double revenues from
its offshore business by getting into rig
construction. In 2007, it built a port at
Sohar, Oman, to serve a shipyard where
it plans to build rigs and other offshore
equipment. L&T also plans to construct
two new ports at Dhamra in Orissa and
Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh.

Billion-dollar drillship
Last month, Stena Drilling, a wholly
owned subsidiary of Stena AB, announced it’s building a new Arctic-class
drillship at Samsung Heavy Industries
shipyard in South Korea. The estimated
total delivery price for the dynamically
positioned Stena DrillMAX IV is $1.15
billion. It will be delivered in December
2011.4
The ship is designed with a thickened hull for drilling in harsh, high-latitude environments, and will be capable
of drilling in ultradeep water. It will
have six propellers and a total displacement of 97,000 tons.
Stena’s existing drilling fleet includes
four semisubmersibles, active off Norway, Great Britain, Angola, and Australia,
and three drillships. The Stena DrillMAX
I operates off Brazil under a 4-year contract with options for Repsol-YPF; two
other drillships, Stena DrillMAX III and
Stena Carron, are under construction at
Samsung in Korea.
The two unfinished drillships
have contractual commitments when
delivered. The Stena Carron, named
for a Scottish river, will be completed
mid-2008 and begin a 3-year contract
with Chevron, drilling off northern
Europe. The Stena DrillMAX III will
be delivered in mid-2009 and begin a
5-year contract with Hess Corp.

eration (CCR) tower in
Saudi Aramco’s Yanbu
refinery. This solution allowed the unit
to avoid shutdowns that would have
cost the refiner about
$600,000/day.
The CCR section of
the Yanbu platformer
unit was experiencing successive catalyst
blowouts, which led
to shutdowns of the
regeneration section. This caused the
platformer section to operate at reduced
feed rates, 30,000 b/d vs. 40,000 b/d,
and severities, 95 RON vs. 100 RON.
Saudi Aramco’s Yanbu refinery and
process department and the control
system department worked jointly to
troubleshoot and resolve the successive plugging of the CCR tower. They
concluded that the problem’s root cause
was that the regeneration gas blower
had 10% too much capacity.

it—was to lower the regeneration gas

platformer operations resumed.

Yanbu platformer
The Yanbu platformer unit was
revamped in June 2006 from a fixedbed unit to a CCR unit (OGJ, Dec. 10,
2007, p. 52). Coked spent catalyst from
platforming reactors continuously flows
to the regeneration tower where coke is
burned off and spent catalyst is regenerated in four steps:
1. Coke burning.
2. Oxychlorination, which disperses
catalyst metals and adjusts catalyst
chloride.
3. Catalyst drying.
4. Reduction, which changes catalyst metals to a reduced state. Finally,
regenerated catalyst circulates back to
the first platforming reactor.
Because the catalyst is in continuous movement, catalyst fines will plug
the regenerator screen over time. The
CCR must be shut down and the screen
removed for
cleaning every

when the blower switched to low speed
at 350° C., a blowout again occurred.
We observed a similar phenomenon
when we switched the blower to high
speed (3,565 rpm) from low speed
(1,785 rpm) during the reheat. But unit
performance did not improve.
The refiner, therefore, again shut
down the regeneration section due
to a repetitive blowout between the
disengaging hopper and regeneration
tower. We reduced the CCR platformer
throughput to 30,000 b/d from the
40,000-b/d design rate and the operating severity to 95 RON from 100 RON

to the blower operation because it had
happened on two occasions when the
blower speed was switched.
The inspection team conducted a
detailed analysis of the blower data.
During unit start-up, we conducted
a test run to evaluate blower performance. The head delivered was equivalent to 29.53 in. H2O vs. a design head
of 30.94 in. H2O. Based on the blower’s

performance curve, this motor was delivering 13,300 actual cfm vs. a design
of 12,986 actual cfm (Fig. 3).
The team concluded that the blower
flow was 2.4% above design, even with
a partially plugged screen, indicating
that the actual degree of overdesign was
even higher.
Once the screen was cleaned, the
flow increased, causing catalyst to pin

How Can Petroleum Companies Make Better Decisions?

Analysis, ﬁndings
It is unusual for a blowout to occur
in a CCR because it is normally full of
catalyst. During normal operations, the
catalyst flows down due to gravity.
The disengaging hopper operates at
about 9 kg/sq cm gage (128 psig) and
the regeneration tower operates at about
2.5 kg/sq cm gauge (35.55 psig). Pipes
between the disengaging hopper and
regenerator are full of catalyst, which
balances the large pressure drop across
the two vessels.
If a void is created in the regeneration tower, the huge differential pressure will force the catalyst downward,
which will cause a pressure fluctuation
and generate fines and dust. The fines
will block the regenerator screen, causing the temperature profile to slip.
The problem analysis included these
facts:
• One probable cause could be
something blocking the catalyst transfer
pipe. But this would be a one-time occurrence that would automatically clear
after the blowout. Because the blowout
recurred, it was obvious that the blowout was not due to plugging of transfer
pipes.
• The only difference between the
two start-ups was the screen’s condition. Since initial start-up, the unit
operated with a plugged screen. The
recent start-up was the first one with a
clean screen.
• The blowout was clearly related

(stick to the screen instead of freely
flowing downward) in the regeneration tower. The lock hopper’s removing
catalyst created a void at some location
in the regeneration tower.
When the differential pressure
between the disengaging hopper and
regeneration tower was high enough, it
forced catalyst to fill the void, creating
a blowout. This would also explain the
blowout occurring when the blower
speed changed.
The first time, when the blower
switched from high to low speed, the
catalyst unpinned, which caused an
immediate blowout. The second time
the blower switched from low to high
speed, this caused the catalyst to pin.
The blowout did not occur immediately, however. During subsequent
heat-up, the catalyst slumped, created a
void below the pinned area, and caused
a blowout.
The licensor, convinced that the
blower was a likely cause for the blowout, agreed to:
• Size a restriction orifice to reduce
the regeneration gas flow by 15-20% to
avoid pinning. Yanbu refinery engineers
kept it ready until the unit was immediately shut down for a screen cleaning.
This was installed in the regeneration
tower gas outlet line.
• Conduct an inspection of the
disengaging hopper and regeneration
tower screen.
• Install the restriction orifice in the
regeneration-gas outlet line and observe
unit performance during restart if the
inspection revealed no obvious reason
for the blowouts.

fresh catalyst in the disengaging hopper.
This clearly indicated that the catalyst
was not moving due to localized catalyst pinning on the regeneration tower
screen.
There were no clumps or debris
between the disengaging hopper and
regeneration tower. The regeneration
screen was heavily plugged, and there
was no sign of integrity loss or severe
damage to the screen.
The team concluded that the root
cause for this problem was oversizing
of the regeneration-gas blower.

Recommendations
The main available option to reduce
pinning was to lower regenerationgas flow. The least costly option was
to install a restriction orifice in the
regeneration-gas blower’s suction line
to reduce regeneration-gas flow, which
would increase the pinning margin.
After discussions with Saudi Aramco
engineers, the unit licensor recommended the optimum size for the restriction orifice. It concluded that a 15%
reduction in total regeneration-gas flow
would improve the pinning margin to
25%.
The licensor designed a restriction
orifice with a bore size of 340 mm,
which we fabricated and installed in
the regeneration-gas outlet line. Higher
burn-zone oxygen offset the reduced
burn-zone capacity, which fell due to
less regeneration gas flow. Oxygen levels increased to 0.95-1.10 mole % from
a normal operating value of 0.85-0.95
mole %.

to 95% of design and slowly reduced
oxygen concentration to 0.8 mole %
from 1.0 mole %.
Laboratory results showed that there
was less than 0.07 wt % carbon on
the catalyst, which indicated complete
regeneration. The test results indicated
that there was no major reduction in
unit capacity. ✦

A simple economic
procedure applied to
NGL pipelines can help
operators determine
whether abnormalities
Pipelines
detected during periodic
magnetic-flux leakage
pigging are large enough to shut the
pipeline for repair or if operations can
continue.
An Argentine
NGL plant in
Neuquén separates
rich components
of gas and pumps
them 600 miles
through a pipeline
to the Bahía Blanca
fractionating plant (Fig. 1). Pipeline
construction used low-carbon API-5LX65 steel, electric resistance welding,
and an external three-layer extruded
polyethylene coating to prevent external
damage.
In September 2004, after 4 years of
uninterrupted operation, the operator
used a magnetic-flux leakage intelligent
pig1 to conduct internal inspection,
fulfilling its maintenance plan. The final
report showed some internal defects,
only one of which was of major inter-

est, having a 44% thickness reduction
and a rectangular shape.
Pipeline failure would likely result
in a stoppage of production or safety
incidents, such as fire, explosion, environmental pollution, injury, or death.
Identifying and recognizing defects
and failures in hydrocarbon pipelines is
important and necessary.
This first of two articles uses a simple
economic procedure to help operators,
engineers, and general managers make
the right decision should a leak be
detected, based on its behavior under
different scenarios.
The procedure consists of three
steps:
• Identification. A magnetic-flux
leakage intelligent pig report and ultrasonic Scan B testing located the defect.
• Quantification. Ultrasonic thickness measurement and Scan B results
use gammagraphic inspection to determine the defect’s size and location on
the wall pipe.
• Assessment. A simple finite element analysis model simulates the real
defect and then corroborates results
against API Recommended Practice 579

An MFL intelligent pig inspection

pipeline maintenance plan. The MFL pig
inspection, though not the focus of this
work, is an important step of a pipeline
integrity management plan.
The procedure presented here applies
to all pipelines after an intelligent pig

and consists of the three steps listed
earlier (Fig. 2). Table 1 shows different
scenarios analyzed in the defect zone.

Ultrasonic inspection preformed
NDT on the NGL pipeline through its
protective coating (three-layer polyethylene extruded, PE-3PL) without
breaking it. Successful application of
ultrasonic techniques requires good
adhesion between the protective layer

UT Scan B conducted on the pipeline
exposed the defect profile and determined where the gammagraphic film
should be located on the pipeline wall.
Analysis of the UT Scan B screen images
yielded the following results:
• Axial scan. The defect resembled a
keyhole; rectangular with sharp sides
increasing the hoop stress on the pipe
wall. Real internal metal loss equaled
1.2 mm, or 23%, instead of the 44%
reported by the MFL pig
inspection.
• Circumferential scan. The

Quantiﬁcation
Following identification and location of the defect with UT Scan B, a
gammagraphic inspection identified the
defect’s real dimension and position on
the pipe wall.
Radiography detects features of an
assembly exhibiting a difference in
thickness or physical density compared
to surrounding material. Radiography
generally only detects features with an
appreciable thickness parallel to the radiation beam. Radiography can be used
to inspect most types of solid material;
metallic and non metallic. Inspection of
this pipeline used gamma-rays.
82

Lost pipe material

Successful in-service pipeline radiographic inspection depends on knowledge of NGL’s absorption coefficient
(the attenuation of electromagnetic
radiation) because its density varies
between water and gasoline.
Field-development of the radiographic film revealed a 40 × 60-mm

defect, circumferentially oriented. The
dimensions corroborated the rectangular defect predicted by UT Scan B and
the pig inspection report, but revealed
a surface area difference of 44.4%
between the defect reported by pig inspection and radiographic examination.
No cracks were found on the corner
defect, which could have been created
by the notch effect.
This part of the procedure completely quantified the real defect, combining
the UT Scan B and radiographic examination results. Fig. 5 clearly shows the
three-dimensional defect image.
Table 2 shows the difference between
the defect reported by MFL pig inspection and that reported by ultrasonic and
radiographic examination.

Defect origin
Fitness For Service assessment
requires identification of the damage
mechanism. Skipping this critical step
can lead to failure; creating false conclusions from a stress perspective.
Identifying the damage mechanism
requires the appropriate NDT method,
an estimate of the future damage rate to
find remaining life, and proper monitoring and mitigation methods.
NGL’s non-corrosive nature makes it
unlikely the defect occurred in service,
raising the probability it occurred during manufacturing. Electric-resistance
welded line pipe consists of plates,
longitudinally butt welded by heat from
electric current, without filler metal and
rolled until uniform in their OD. It is
unlikely either rolling or storage created
the defect. Quality inspection at the
steel manufacturer likely failed.
This type of damage is not accepted
by the international standard API 5L
Specification for Line Pipe.3

Assessment
This part of the procedure ensures
the mechanical integrity of the pipeline
under different loading scenarios based
on the real defect quantified. The need
for more accurate and reliable assessment results forces use of both analytical and numerical methodologies. This

New Envelop protective covers are de- corrosive environments, helping to protect
signed specifically for use in drilling oper- drilling equipment from the weather.
By virtually eliminating the penetration
of moisture and humidity, Envelop covers
have proven to reduce equipment corrosion by as much as 90%, the company
says.
Protected by three patents, Envelop’s
four-layered design is waterproof yet
breathable, allowing moisture vapor to
evaporate from underneath and reducing
rust.
Envelop products incorporate special
materials to absorb condensation trapped
underneath the cover and hold it away
from the metal being protected, until it
evaporates it into the air. In addition, longlife vapor corrosion inhibitors released
into the enclosed atmosphere help prevent
oxidation.

New in-line pipeline inspection service
The new CPCM in-line
inspection (ILI) service is a
method to assess effectiveness of a pipeline’s cathodic
protection system from inside
the pipe.
Pipeline operators can
utilize an ILI tool to identify
gaps and flaws in their cathodic protection systems.
ILI utilizes a smart pig
traveling through the line,
performing high-resolution
cathodic protection measurements of the entire pipeline.
There are no gaps in the data
stream due to rough terrain,
lakes or streams, and other
inaccessible areas. The system is also suited
for assessing offshore pipelines.

Latest oil-price
investigation
targets traders
Oil and gas companies have reason to
welcome but be wary of the latest report of
an oil-price investigation.
Most such probes start in Congress,
focus on operating companies that sell
gasoline, and ﬁnd nothing. The one lately in
the news started at the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, targets traders,
and remains under way. There’s a difference
between operating companies and traders,

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

although some traders work for operating
companies. The oil industry should hope
these distinctions stay clear. The CFTC on
May 29 unveiled an investigation begun
last December into “the purchase, transportation, storage, and trading of crude oil
and related derivative products.” It called
disclosure of a continuing investigation
“an extraordinary step,” taken “because of
today’s unprecedented market conditions.”
The step also might have something to
do with pressure from Congress. On May
27 Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), chairman of the
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, asked CFTC to examine commodity
trading on foreign exchanges and challenged its assertions discounting speculation as a factor in oil-price elevation (OGJ
Online, May 28, 2008). In its statement
announcing the investigation, the CFTC reported an agreement with the UK Financial
Services Authority and ICE Futures Europe
increasing the exchange of information
about commodity contracts with US delivery points.
Although the statement didn’t say so,
that move responds to concern about the
so-called Enron loophole, which exempts
from CFTC oversight forward contracts
traded outside the US covering US commodity deliveries. The statement also
reported measures to enhance the transparency of index trading.
Whether misbehavior in any of these areas can account for recent leaps in the price
of crude oil is questionable. Yet individual
traders of various types have been known
to misbehave, sometimes with spectacularly damaging consequences. Oil companies
don’t beneﬁt from anything that distorts
markets, including trading shenanigans.
They should applaud government exertions to keep markets honest. But they’ll
face guilt by association if the CFTC probe
uncovers trading irregularities anywhere.
And if problems center on any of their
own traders, they’ll have to deal with political hostility that will make the currently
nasty mood on Capitol Hill feel tame.

J o u r n a l

www.ogjonline.com

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

Energy is top political issue
From a record intraday high of $135.09/bbl May 22, the contract for benchmark
US light sweet crudes closed at $127.35/bbl May 30, down 3.7% during the four trading sessions following the May 26 Memorial Day holiday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. For the whole of May, however, the price of crude was up 12%.
By the end of May, the average retail gasoline price exceeded $4/gal in more than
a dozen US states, with the national average just a few cents below the same mark.
“Prices have never been this high. California has become the ﬁrst state where diesel
fuel prices average $5/gal” said analysts at Pritchard Capital Partners LLC, New
Orleans.
Because of public outcry against high energy costs, said Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland, “The price of oil has now become the No. 1 issue for
politicians.” Under pressure from Congress to change the limit rule or at least bring
more transparency to the futures market, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is investigating possible manipulations of energy futures prices. However,
Jakob warned, “Any change of regulation on index trading will likely not materialize
overnight (although the current political pressure is making for quicker than usual
developments), but it exposes the long-term passive investors (pension funds) to a
new risk; basically that the rules change by the time they want out, or force them out
of positions.” Such “system risk” should start to price a higher premium, he said.
Hundreds of British truck drivers tied up trafﬁc in London, and ﬁshermen blockaded ports in France in protests against high fuel prices. French President Nicolas
Sarkozy proposed a European Union cap on fuel sales tax. UK Prime Minister
Gordon Brown met with oilmen in Aberdeen to discuss how to maximize production
from the UK’s depleting North Sea ﬁelds, including possible tax reductions. Brown
increased taxes on North Sea production when he was chancellor. Two years ago,
he joined other European leaders in increasing taxes on large vehicles, fuel, plastic bags, and air travel in an effort to reduce carbon emissions 60% by 2050. Now
Brown pledges global action on high oil prices will be the top topic at the Group of
Eight (G8) July summit in Japan.
With the current public push to reduce energy prices, some observers are
saying—perhaps prematurely—that the political power of the Green Party and other
environmentalists may be broken. A recent poll sponsored by the National Center for
Public Policy Research, a conservative think-tank and policy institute, found 65% of
US residents don’t want to spend even a penny more for gasoline in order to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.
Demand destruction
“Higher prices are causing demand destruction, but only in regions where
consumers see price signals,” said Richard Berner, co-head of global economics
at Morgan Stanley & Co. Demand for crude within the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development in 2008 is expected to decline for the third year in a
row, although perhaps by less than 1 million b/d. However, Berner said non-OECD
demand led by China and the Middle East is likely to remain strong even if oil hits
$150/bbl.
Demand destruction “is a much abused term, which refers to demand that is not
only lost when prices rise, but that stays lost even if prices fall back to their original
levels,” said Paul Horsnell, Barclays Capital Inc., London. “It is a concept about an
asymmetry in demand response to price movements. The reduction in OECD power
and heavy manufacturing sector use of oil in the early 1980s was genuine demand
destruction. However, there is no suggestion as yet that demand destruction is
currently taking place, and, by deﬁnition, what was destroyed in the 1980s cannot
be destroyed twice.” Instead, he said, “What we are looking at in the numbers is
straightforward demand reduction with no necessary implication that lower prices
would not price that demand straight back in.”
Jakob said, “On the demand side, Taiwan is added to the list of countries going
through the process of price revisions with an increase of 16% on diesel and 13%
on gasoline. India should be the next country in line to lower internal subsidies. The
problem is that these budgetary imbalances have not been created by $130/bbl but
by $100/bbl oil and will likely be followed by more revisions.”
The South Korean government is considering cutting more oil taxes, including the
tax on diesel, to help ease price pressure on households. The government lowered
oil taxes by 10% in March.

THE RETHINKING CONTINUES
By rethinking recovery methods, producers have brought to a hungry market gas from reservoirs once considered economically
and technically impossible. Tight sands, shales, and coalbeds now represent large and growing sources of an essential form of
clean energy. But they’re still unconventional. The reservoirs are complex. The costs of drilling into and completing wells in them
are high and rising. They present unique environmental problems. Producing gas from unconventional reservoirs proﬁtably, safely,
and in amounts demanded by the market requires continuous rethinking – the kind of thinking that shoves back limits on what’s
possible with gas supply.
Rethinking of recovery methods will continue September 30 – October 2, 2008, at the Unconventional Gas International
Conference & Exhibition at the Hilton Fort Worth in Fort Worth, Texas. Planned by editors of Oil & Gas Journal and an advisory
board of industry experts, the event will highlight innovation from unconventional gas plays around the world. It will be your
chance to meet and learn from other professionals in the fastest-growing sector of the gas-producing industry.

OTC shows value of conferences to energy professionals

T

his year’s Offshore Technology Conference (OTC) in Houston demonstrated in
its typically big way why industry trade conferences are invaluable for an energy
professional’s career development.
OTC is a powerfully effective amalgam of strong technical content and jaw-dropping
exhibits. Attendance this year reached 75,092, a 26-year high, as energy professionals from 110
countries met to learn about the latest
technology to find and produce offshore
oil and natural gas resources. Some of
A truism in the energy industry today:
the exhibits are truly, if you pardon the

countries participated in OTC 2008,
many of them displaying in an area the
size of 13 football fields at Reliant Center.
Beyond the gee-whiz technology and imposing equipment is the transfer of knowledge, as
more than 300 technical papers were presented at the Houston conference. Conferences such
as OTC excel as opportunities to learn and to network among all oil and gas professionals. But
of special note this year was the conference’s emphasis on networking among and education
of young minds. The Next Wave event was a special OTC session devoted to issues important
to industry professionals under the age of 35. In addition, the second OTC Energy Education
Institute brought 100 Houston area elementary and secondary teachers to OTC for a workshop
on bringing energy topics to their classrooms.
Facing a potentially crippling shortfall of skilled talent due to the impending retirement of
more than half of its workforce in the coming decade, the oil and gas industry is pulling out all
the stops to recruit and retain talent. Many of the exhibits featured displays and kiosks managed
by company recruiters. PennWell’s own large booth featured a room-length wall displaying
hundreds of PennEnergyJOBS listings, such as those featured at the back of this issue; young
professionals often were seen clustered around our wall of career opportunities.
But it wasn’t just youth being served by these recruiting initiatives; seasoned professionals
could often be seen visiting recruiting stations as well. That underscores part of the message
of the article on p. 5 of this issue that, for now, retention is a bigger concern than recruitment
for many oil and gas operating and service/supply companies. And judging by the way that
PennWell books, magazines, and marketing materials were flying off the shelves, there is an
unquenchable thirst for knowledge by young and mature alike, demonstrating that learning
is a constant in a successful career. Those two circumstances add up to what must be a truism
in the energy industry today: Companies that don’t make every effort to keep continuing
education and training of skilled professionals uppermost in their retention initiatives will fail
to grow and succeed.
Sincerely,

Jamie Matlin,
Publisher & Director of Recruitment Advertising

Whose ‘ox’ is getting gouged?

O

il prices are in stratospheric territory these days.
Not only are oil prices at record highs, some see
even higher prices on the horizon. Goldman Sachs recently
concluded that oil prices are in the midst of a “superspike”
that could last for years and even reach $200 per barrel.
There are a number of drivers for this:
• A weak dollar (oil is priced in US dollars) spurring
a speculative frenzy by investors in commodities,
especially oil. Some analysts say speculative buying
of oil futures contracts accounts for 30% of the
runup in oil prices.
• A small sliver of surplus productive capacity, leaving
the supply/demand balance on a razor’s edge (and
an unwillingness by OPEC to expand production,
thereby trimming that sliver even thinner).
• Production disruptions caused by domestic strife in
major producing countries such as Nigeria.
• Larger threats to oil supply caused by war in the
Middle East.
• Oil field megaprojects slowed by soaring costs and
staff and equipment constraints, as well by some
changing government fiscal regimes.

The list goes on. But for many people, especially in the
US, the cause of sky-high prices boils down to one thing: oil
company greed.
And so begins anew the chorus of complaints, the cries for
legislation to punish the oil industry as companies post record
profits. The oil companies are gouging us, the public cries, and
pandering politicians feel compelled to confiscate oil company
revenues via imposition of a “windfall” profit tax.
But is the industry’s financial performance that
impressive? Sure, tens of billions of dollars is a lot of
profit for ExxonMobil, but that must be measured against
company revenues measuring in the hundreds of billions.
In recent years, oil companies’ return on capital has been
in line with most other businesses and industries—and
much less than that of others, such as cosmetics and
pharmaceuticals. Most profits are pumped back into finding
and producing more energy.
Are consumers getting “gouged” at the pump? Gasoline
approaching $4 per gallon sounds like a lot to Americans,
but that cost is up only 50% from a year ago, and crude oil
prices have more than doubled in that timespan. So refiners
are making less profit than they did a year ago.
Oil companies don’t set prices—Wall Street does, on the
futures exchanges. “Big Oil” controls only about 12% of

E n e r g y Wo r k f o r c e

global oil production. And oil companies are also spending
more: Finding and development costs are up about 50% in
the past 5 years.

There are many drivers for oil prices, but in the
end, it all boils down to supply and demand.
And the price of oil today reflects the perceived
directions of supply and demand.
Compare the cost of gasoline to that of other liquids. A
gallon of gasoline is cheaper than a gallon of milk, soda
pop, orange juice, vegetable oil, rubbing alcohol, shampoo,
etc. Yes, you say, but I don’t need to put 30 gallons of soda
pop into my Hummer to get to work each week. And the
counter-argument would be: Maybe you need to cut back on
those Starbucks frappuccino iced coffees that cost five times
per gallon what the gasoline cost, if the need is so great.
OK, maybe that was uncalled for, but the underlying
question is this: Why should oil be exempt from the law of
supply and demand? Higher pump prices are already having
an effect—gasoline demand in the US fell significantly in the
first quarter. But oil demand worldwide is expected to climb
another 1 million b/d or more this year, thanks to the soaring
economies of China, India, and other developing nations.
You want to talk price gouging? Ever buy roses for your
sweetheart on Valentine’s Day? A 300% markup in 24 hours.
I recently bought tickets for an October concert that officially
list at $118 apiece; but the only decent seats were available
through a scalper—pardon me, online ticket broker—for
$225 apiece plus a $41.40 “handling” fee (!) apiece. Let’s
say you were lucky enough to have purchased an Xbox
or Cabbage Patch doll or Miley Cyrus concert ticket at
face value when those items were the focus of a consumer
buying frenzy. Thanks to hysterical preteen girls and their
exasperated parents, Miley Cyrus tickets last fall were going
for as much as $3,000 apiece on E-bay. What would you have
done with that $100 ticket? Now let’s talk “greed” vs. “need.”
There are many drivers for oil prices, but in the end, it all
boils down to supply and demand. And the price of oil today
reflects the perceived directions of supply and demand.
Whether or not that’s “fair” depends on whose “ox” is
getting gored, uh, gouged.

Managing Editor

think the writer’s risk model holds up for engineeringintensive companies or positions. I think he is mixing risk

being responsible for a working group, or being responsible
for the success of a company.

f the letter you received (Letters to the Editor, p. 4,
EnergyWorkforce, Winter 2008) is correct, and salary
is determined on risk, then engineers should be the
highest paid. To say that a engineer does not have the
risk factors that a doctor, lawyer, or even CEO does is just
unfounded. A doctor makes a mistake, and one patient
dies. A structural engineer doing bridge calculations
makes a mistake, and hundreds die. (Don’t get me wrong:
Doctors go through a lot more schooling and deserve a
higher salary—just not based on risk.)
A engineer in an auto company makes a mistake, and a
recall is required. The company loses millions of dollars,
the engineer is fired, and the CEO is given a bonus for
addressing a safety issue. Worst case, the CEO is fired with
a $10 million severance package. Where is the risk in being
a lawyer—trial record? That is purely reputation. If you fail
at one or two projects as a engineer, you can’t get a job. If

Just to let you know that I thoroughly enjoyed the article
on energy futures trader and risk hedging advisor Steve
Mosley (Humility seen as key trait for energy futures
trader’s success, p. 14, EnergyWorkforce, Winter 2008). I
originally picked the article because of the word “humility”
in its title, something that you do not normally hear next
to the word “trader” in boom times. The article went along
the lines of what I was expecting, and more. Although some
of the terms are difficult to understand (I am a neophyte
on hedges and trading), the overall message from Steve
was not that self-glorifying and provided attitudes that
could apply in other roles. Being a semi-mature Young
Professional, I thank him for his advice.

In-depth workforce analysis needed
to resolve energy stafﬁng challenges
Brad Kamph, Interliance Consulting Inc.

This is the second of three articles analyzing the
bottom-line approach to knowledge retention in
the energy industry.
What on earth is wrong with the workforce? It would be great
if one simple answer prevailed, applicable to all organizations
across the energy sector. However, broad generalities not only
don’t apply, they can be downright dangerous.
Witness the fact that fad after fad has swept across the business
world over the past couple of decades. All it takes is one isolated
and unusual success, and suddenly everyone is doing it. Largescale downsizing, Y2K, e-business, and other fads have all come
and gone. While there were certainly victories recorded in some
companies by virtue of these initiatives, the losses outweighed

the gains in many cases. And the reason is obvious: Attempting
to shotgun the one solution into all businesses without evaluating
the existing situation at your specific business is a sure route
to failure. Or if, as a manager, you take the latest fad from a
magazine article and assume it applies to your own situation.
The fact is that each organization is uniquely different. What
works in one power plant might have no relevance for a sister
plant in another state. What brought miracles in a Fortune
50 empire might not translate well into a mid-sized utility
environment. What improved profitability at a natural gas
processing facility might prove to be destructive when forced
into play at a transmission outfit.
What it takes, then¸ is an accurate estimate of the current

stand, it is impossible to set correct strategy. This applies
in particular to the workforce. The key to correctly solving
any organizational problem is to fully and comprehensively
understand where your workforce currently stands.

many instances, perfectly valid systems were tossed aside to
be replaced by inferior technologies. And what happened in
the end? Y2K turned out to be largely a myth with almost no
instances of system failures at midnight on Jan. 1, 2000.

Management fads
Fad after fad has overtaken the nation over the past two decades.
Remember “Chainsaw” Al Dunlap? That man may have
salvaged Scott Paper by taking drastic measures to eliminate vast
overstaffing that had accumulated over time. But how did that
one limited success end up becoming “the way to run American
companies?” Overnight, literally everyone was laying off people
in droves. Certainly other economic factors were at work,
but this kneejerk movement contributed to dark economic
days in the late 1980s and early 1990s. And what happened to
“Chainsaw” Al himself? His subsequent efforts to apply similar
methods to Sunbeam resulted in his dismissal.

Around that same time, Enron Corp. was being lauded as a
“revolutionary paradigm.” The kudos continued right up to
the day the whole house of cards collapsed. Businesses were
encouraged to throw out the dated (i.e., tried and true) ways
and adopt this new model. Much of the language was steeped
in e-commerce buzz words (another fad), not to mention
vague pronouncements about “diversified portfolios,”
“proactivity” and “divesting old-economy assets.”

Yet this craze wreaked havoc across the energy sector. Some
would go as far as to say that the industry has yet to fully recover.
Power plants, oil refineries, natural gas processing facilities, and
energy transmission units no longer have the in-house resources
they once possessed. Gone are the internal maintenance crews
and massive parts and equipment inventories.
A 1,000-MW power plant, for instance, may have once
retained a full-time maintenance crew of anywhere up to 100
people. Many of them were long-term veterans who knew
every inch of the facility and just about anything there was to
know about the machinery in their charge. While they looked
after outages and overhauls, another team of up to 35 people
was available for day-to-day maintenance duties. While this
number of resources may not now be economically viable in
a more deregulated world, it appears that the downsizing fad
has thrown the baby out with the bathwater. Surely a middle
ground would have been a more optimum solution instead of
the current pictures, where plants are largely dependent on
outsourced maintenance or expensive consultants—in many
cases the very same people that were offered early retirement
or were let go as surplus to requirements.
Another fad of note was Y2K. The very fabric of civilization
was to be torn apart once a single digit changed on aging
computer systems. In response, every business spent a fortune
updating its systems. Utilities, for instance, abandoned
mainframe computing on a wholesale basis as it contained the
dreaded Y2K bug. In a good number of cases, the computing
infrastructure did indeed need upgrading. But in just as

6

Speaking of e-commerce, what havoc that whole movement
wrought! All of a sudden, every aging manager felt the
urge to get with it and transform a stable brick-and-mortar
establishment into an e-commerce play. Fortunately, at least,
the energy sector didn’t buy into this to the same degree as
other sectors.
Let’s cover one more past fad: core competency. A couple of
successes in the information technology sector were trumpeted
as business strategy de jour for the new millennium. With chip
manufacturers and computer firms no longer actually making
any hardware—they outsourced the physical production
to firms in Asia—companies were told to reevaluate their
core strengths. Were you really a manufacturer or a power
producer? Perhaps in reality, your core competency was power
marketing or distribution. That led to the big “therefore”—
throw out everything else and just focus on this imagined core
competency. Sell off your plants, or your coal mines or your
refineries and throw all your efforts into selling energy. This
gave a new impetus to earlier downsizing trends, and again
threadbare organizations resulted.
Aging workforce fad
Of course, there have been a few movements that were more
positive. Total Quality Management, ISO 9000/2000, and Six
Sigma quality can perhaps be placed in this camp. But even
here too many jumped aboard the bandwagon and overinvested
in programs when capital could perhaps have been better spent
elsewhere. Some companies, for example, poured millions
into such programs without seeing a significant return on
investment. Perhaps it was the case that those who truly
understood these initiatives reaped the most reward. But on the
other side of the coin, some got swept along in the latest thing.
It is that mentality the energy industry has to avoid.

So how can you guard against the overexuberance of analysts
and management gurus? Without a firm knowledge of where
things stand, it is impossible to set correct workforce strategy.
The key to correctly solving any organizational problem,
then, is to only conduct improvement programs that are
based upon an accurate estimate of where your workforce
currently stands.
A case in point: Survey top management across the industry
about the No. 1 workforce issue, and what is the top response?
In all likelihood, it will be the aging workforce. Obviously, this
is an issue of importance. And it is certainly getting enormous
play in the both the trade magazines and in popular culture. It
is hardly possible to go through a day without hearing about
the baby boomers hitting retirement in droves, or the average
age of American engineering talent getting older and older.
But is this really our most pressing workforce challenge?
The statistics belie that argument. The Department of Labor
recently estimated, for instance, that annual retirements in
the utilities field amounted to 4.4% of the workforce. That’s
actually less than a quarter of the total number of people
leaving employment overall for the year. Conclusion: a large

number of people nearing retirement does pose a direct threat
to operations, but other areas of the workforce merit even more
serious consideration.
But the aging workforce theme, in effect, has developed into
a sort of mini-fad within the energy sector. In some firms it is
the situation. But for most firms, it is only one of several factors
that add up to a serious problem. Thus if you are investing hard
to prevent the loss of the skills of retirees from walking out the
door, even more serious workforce situations could be developing
unnoticed that could wreck any hope of long-term expansion.
Further, Interliance surveys reveal that only one out of
every eight companies currently has a goal of addressing
nonretirement attrition. Whatever these nonretirement
attrition challenges are, very few organizations are actually
facing up to them.
This isn’t to say that everyone should immediately reverse
course, abandon aging workforce problems, and dive off in
some new direction. The pendulum-swing mentality has
prevailed for too long. After all, each organization has unique

needs. No two organizations are alike. So no one program is
ever going to be a universal winner.
Zeroing in on the correct target
To succeed with your workforce, it is essential to zero in on
the correct target or targets and set strategy as well as priorities
accordingly. That can be done only by following an in-depth
analysis of the workforce as a whole. Such an analysis opens
the door to remedial actions that not only can relieve the
immediate workforce pressure but also set the organization on
the right path for future prosperity.
In one company, for example, Interliance researchers conducted a
workforce analysis to determine those workers most at risk from
nonretirement attrition. Within a few days a pattern emerged:
Personnel most likely to leave were those who had worked with
the company for 2–7 years. Another interesting fact also emerged:
Of those leaving, 35% took positions in other companies within
the industry. Armed with factual data, management could
correctly set strategy to address these priorities.
To be effective, though, a workforce analysis has to be
embracive. It can’t dwell only upon training or retirees or
recruitment, but most span all these zones and more. In our
experience, retention, knowledge management, and process
design can be just as important. Typically, several factors
dovetail together to present a comprehensive solution.
Further, an accurate workforce analysis is an excellent way to
marry up workforce requirements with immediate business
needs. For example, attrition risk can be correlated to the
various skill levels that exist within the organization. When this
is done properly, it exposes the skills that pose the highest risk
of being lost. This lets management set strategy to immediately
recruit two experienced engineers for Turbine X or Boiler Y,
as the personnel in those areas are due to retire within a year
without replacement. This can be paralleled with mid-term and
long-term actions to restore full health to the workforce.
Ideally, a workforce analysis should also identify key areas of
organizational knowledge to capture. Once again, this should
not be done too broadly or too haphazardly. In the example
above about the two people about to retire, it is wise to analyze
their areas for efficiency as part of the workforce analysis
process. This might reveal that one of those workers is the very
model of excellence, while the other is responsible for a unit
that has suffered long-term downtime issues and continual
problems. By investigating detailed performance metrics as

8

part of the analysis, it is possible to determine which knowledge
to capture and which areas where process improvement is the
more advisable path to follow.
Achieving ROI from workforce programs
What this is really about is changing the game when it comes
to workforce programs. Historically, such programs as
training, knowledge management, and process improvement
have tended to be so vague that it was hard, if not impossible,
to determine any actual return on investment (ROI) from
them. Thus they tended to be viewed as costs, as opposed to
investments in the future.
An in-depth analysis takes away the mystery and presents
workforce issues within a workable framework. This framework
can then be translated into tangible ROI. How? By creating an
exact business case, i.e., by investing X dollars in very specific
training, process improvement, recruitment, and retention
efforts, savings can be achieved in the range of millions to tens
of millions of dollars for Plant Y.
A workforce analysis, therefore, is both a strategic and tactical
tool. It is designed to isolate the exact organizational skills and the
depth of knowledge that currently exist, and relate specific skills
to the business reasons for each performance requirement of the
job position. It categorizes the strengths and weaknesses of the
workforce, provides a detailed attrition analysis, and assesses the
impact on critical business skills, as well as defining key areas of
required training, process improvement, and knowledge capture.
In reality, this represents an opportunity. By finding out the
actual workforce situation inside your company, you will be
given the tools to rapidly bring about a substantial reduction
in the level of turnover. And by instituting precisely tailored
changes in recruitment requirements, it is possible to save
millions of dollars on workforce development costs alone.

PETROLEUM

INGAA study: Gas pipeline industry
not addressing staff shortfall
Bob Williams, Managing Editor

The natural gas transmission industry is falling short when
it comes to addressing the tough challenges of maintaining
an adequate technical workforce today.
And the challenges will get only tougher in the coming
decade, as companies are ill-equipped to cope with the
rising attrition of qualified employees in the skilled trades,
operations, and professional engineering fields.

is responsible for design, construction, operation, and
maintenance of pipelines.”
This means:
• Pipeline, storage, corrosion, civil, and project
management engineers.
• Dispatch and station operators.
• Welders, electricians, pipefitters, mechanics, and
instrumentation and control technicians.

Given the comparably daunting challenge of
accommodating the public’s growing demand for
natural gas with an aging infrastructure and increasingly
stringent regulatory regime, it’s imperative that the
natural gas transmission industry put workforce
planning strategies and action steps at the forefront of
their business planning.

Marketing, accounting, sales, and management were not
included in the study scope but may be considered in a
follow-up study. Midstream and gathering segments were
deemed outside of the report’s scope and were considered
as an external industry that competes for the same
workforce resources.

Those are among the chief conclusions of a comprehensive
study conducted for the Interstate Natural Gas Association
of America (INGAA) by Interliance Consulting Inc.,
Santa Ana, Calif. The study, conducted specifically for the
INGAA Foundation Inc., was concluded in 2007.

“The overall strategy incorporates external trends and
influences with internal company actions and policies,
providing an effective strategic roadmap for the INGAA
Foundation and its members in terms of short-, medium-,
and long-term actions,” the report said.

Scope and methodology
The INGAA study assessed the risks to industry’s workforce
and knowledge assets resulting from current internal
company activities, along with external factors.

Roadmaps
The INGAA Foundation described its workforce strategy as
a customizable roadmap for companies in the natural gas
transmission pipeline industry, helping them to manage the
impending challenges in workforce and knowledge management.

The analysis was based on data gathered from executives,
managers, and operations and human resources
professionals within the natural gas transmission industry
and secondary data sources.
The study also recommended strategies for the INGAA
Foundation and member companies to follow, along with
short-, medium- and long-term actions necessary to meet
the workforce challenges. The complete study, with strategic
action plan roadmaps, is available at http://www.ingaa.org/
cms/31/43/4913/5332.aspx.

E n e r g y Wo r k f o r c e

The roadmap’s key components for maintaining a capable
workforce in the natural gas industry are:
• Supply. Ensure there are enough new, skilled
workers willing to take on positions in the
transmission industry, now and in the future.
• Recruit. Attract the required numbers of new
hires in a timely manner by offering competitive
compensation packages and well-defined,
challenging positions.
• Develop. Employ effective skill development
and knowledge management that maintains
the company’s knowledge assets for use in
preparing new employees for their positions,

allowing fully qualified employees to develop
new skills, and supporting corporate-wide
operating improvements.
Maintain. Retain skilled, committed,
and motivated employees while meeting
budgetary goals.

The study noted that the workforce supply goal will be
a key focus for the INGAA Foundation and its industry
roadmaps, along with supporting members’ actions for
reaching the other three goals.

“Companies are adding external recruiting resources to
counteract the limited pool of skilled new hires, as most
companies prefer to hire fully qualified candidates,” it said.
“At present, four out of five new hires are experienced,
with an average of 7 years in their field of work. The most
successful recruiting methods involve extra monetary
incentives for candidates, such as hiring bonuses or
relocation allowances.”

Pointing out that DOL does not track specialties within
the natural gas industry, the study acknowledged that
the supply of engineers in these specialties is not easily
quantifiable: “Supply shortages for expert natural gas
engineers are being experienced by the human resources
professionals surveyed in the management study. Human
resources professionals report engineers as the most
difficult job position to recruit—in particular engineers
with natural gas experience, such as pipeline engineers,
project engineers, storage and reservoir engineers, and
engineers with skills in friction stir, nondestructive
evaluation, and plastics.”

The study also found that natural gas industry salaries
are competitive when compared with other industries
and other types of utilities: “At present, utility companies
pay their technical employees an average of 2% more for
engineering positions and 21% more for other technical
positions (e.g., supervisors, electricians, operators, controlvalve installers).”
Among utilities, the electric utility industry pays an average
of 5% more than the natural gas industry, the report added.

The study also said that attrition is reducing the number
of experienced natural gas engineers by 10%/year, as
forecasted growth is increasing the requirements by
3–5%/year.

The INGAA study used a baseline of 11,000 pipeline and
39,000 technical services employees and an employment
growth rate of 3%/year to calculate the recruitment
requirements for replacing employees that retire or leave
the industry, additional workers for employment growth,
and replacement workers for those that change positions
within the industry (Fig. 2).

Recruitment
The INGAA report noted that it takes an average of 3
months to hire a technical employee today, and this time
span has been increasing over the last several years.

The resulting recruiting requirement estimates
indicate that:
• At least 5,200 new technical workers must be
brought into the natural gas transmission industry

According to the INGAA study, a complete
skill development and knowledge management
program includes:
• Training and competency development
requirements at the line level.
• Forecasted future competency development
requirements, paying special attention to at-risk
skills and expert knowledge requirements.
• Organization needs assessment for scheduling
training and curriculum development.
• A formal and cost-effective system for
developing best practices for achieving gains
in efficiency, productivity, and quality and for
minimizing losses.
• Fully tested and documented best practices
that have undergone a job safety analysis and
have been developed into standard policies
and procedures.
Retention
Among the natural gas transmission industry’s poorest
showings was the area of employee retention.

PETROLEUM

The study found that retention was mentioned by only
one in eight respondents as a method of reducing the risk
to workforce and knowledge management, with 87% of
companies not having a target for non-retirement attrition.
In addition, two-thirds of companies surveyed do not
measure employee satisfaction, “which is the best predictor
of future attrition.”
DOL statistics show that employees are changing jobs
faster today than they were a decade ago, the study pointed
out: “Delaying the average employee’s attrition by 1 year
can save $75 million overall for the industry, or $770,000
a year for a 500-person company. For the 11,000 pipeline
technical workers and 39,000 services employees, this is a
total attrition cost of $575 million annually, and is expected
to increase by $93 million in 5 years.”
Of that total attrition cost, $165 million is caused
by the 34% of nonretirement attrition attributed to
employees changing companies within the natural gas
transmission industry.

The INGAA study observed that reducing nonretirement
attrition is mainly a matter of increasing job satisfaction.
Job satisfaction is increased by earning compensation
commensurate with the position and doing interesting
and challenging work; job satisfaction is decreased
by physically and psychologically straining work
environments, restricted social opportunities because of
long or irregular hours, and work inhibitors, such as poor
policies, bureaucracy, and inadequate resources.
“After receiving a competitive salary, younger
workers tend to be more attracted to positions that
have performance-based pay or career advancement
opportunities,” the report said. “Older workers report
more interest in health and retirement benefits. Almost
two-thirds of retirement-age employees would like to
work part-time before retiring completely.”
Training increases capability and commitment, in
addition to maintaining a skilled workforce in the
presence of changing technologies and attrition, the
study added.

Conclusions, action steps
According to the INGAA study, many executives believe
their companies are adequately managing their workforce
and knowledge assets. In a critical disconnect, however,
lower-level managers reported that their companies are not
committing sufficient time or resources to that effort.
“While 29% of executives were ‘very confident’ of their
company’s ability to maintain their workforce and knowledge
assets, less than 3% of managers, operations, and human
resources respondents were equally confident,” the report
said. Only 1 in 20 company managers reported that their
company had allocated sufficient time to plan and implement
workforce and knowledge initiatives.

The study recommended that INGAA and its member
companies should build awareness that understanding and
acting on workforce issues are critical to successful business
operations. That should be followed up with efforts to increase
communication among INGAA Foundation, executive
leadership, and company management and to develop a
workforce business case to justify additional resources.

Another key finding was that few natural gas transmission
companies focus on retaining existing employees. Instead,
companies try to cope with an average annual attrition
rate by simply training new employees faster.

The present level of attrition costs an average company
more than $10,000/year per employee, the study added.
Survey respondents blamed a lack of time and resources
for the limited strategic planning and implementation of
workforce initiatives.

EnCana Quick Facts

“When asked what actions are underway, 49% of
respondents reported increased efforts in developing new
employees, 30% reported increased recruitment efforts,
13% reported retention efforts, and 9% reported initiatives
to increase the supply of skilled technical candidates,” the
report said.

• Approximately 6,500 staff
members.

The natural gas transmission industry should do more to
emphasize retention of the existing workforce, the study
recommended, and follow that up with a plan to target
a specific goal for reducing attrition through phased
retirements, longevity benefits, improved employee
satisfaction, and compensation benchmarking.

Such steps could help support companies’ efforts at

The study also found that companies’ skill development

reports that they hire four experienced employees for
each new graduate. This level may not be sustainable
with the expected growth rate of 3–5% and the 10%
attrition out of the industry each year.”

The study recommended that natural gas transmission
companies take steps to safeguard existing critical
company knowledge and develop the organization’s
capabilities. Two key steps toward this end are to identify
knowledge management risks and mitigate them through
knowledge capture, job shadowing, mentoring, and
documentation of processes, procedures, and standards
and to prioritize skill development plans according to the
risk to operating capabilities.

Thus it becomes crucial for the industry to build a
good industry reputation by marketing the natural gas
transmission “brand,” according to the study. Steps
toward this end include the creation of a marketing plan
to make natural gas transmission careers attractive to
students and the general public, the development of this
natural gas brand in collaboration with other industry
organizations, and an outreach effort targeting secondary
schools and career centers to make them aware of
opportunities in the industry.

The study concluded that transmission companies will
need to add 3–5%/year to their workforces during the
next 5 years. This will add even greater burden to a
company’s recruitment resources.
“Experienced engineers are the most difficult technical
employees to recruit,” the study said. “Human resources

The report contended that companies also must increase
opportunities for technical training in the natural gas
transmission industry by using available government
resources, standardized curricula, apprenticeships, and
scholarships for training new technical employees—and
then utilizing their own resources when required.

The study also called for an effort to improve
recruitment effectiveness and ensure attractive
job positions and compensation. This could be
accomplished by first reviewing and revising
recruitment methods and resources and then
considering alternative pools of candidates outside the
local area or from other industries. Secondly, companies
should review their baseline hiring requirements and
then look into the possibility of hiring lower-skilled
candidates for work/study or apprenticeship programs.
Despite the critical nature of addressing workforce
issues is to the continued success of the natural
gas pipeline industry, many natural gas companies
often fail to consider adequately all of these issues
in their planning.
“Since these workforce issues affect every area of the
industry and individual companies, from operations to
human resources to company leadership and beyond,
they must be—and deserve to be—examined from all
perspectives and brought to the forefront of business
planning,” the study concluded.

The report and roadmap comprised the completion of
the first phase of the INGAA Foundation’s workforce
strategy, underscoring a real urgency for industry to
take the next necessary steps toward implementing the
study recommendations and strategic action plans.
“Key findings show that the workforce issues facing
the industry are causing concern among company
managers, and these issues are only expected to worsen
over the next 5 years,” the study said. “Only 3% of

“The hardest and most important step is to get the
industry ‘on board’ to take action. Tackling these tough
workforce issues will require a concerted, united effort
on the part of the INGAA Foundation, other industry
organizations, and individual companies willing to face
the critical issues, commit the necessary resources—and

Shaw Group: Power industry grappling
with ‘hypercompetitive’ labor market
Bob Williams, Managing Editor

The power industry today is grappling with a
“hypercompetitive” labor market as it seeks to address
staffing needs, according to two top human resources
executives with The Shaw Group Inc., Charlotte, N.C.
Innovations in recruitment and retention are essential
for ensuring viable workforce levels as the industry’s
employment demographic continues to age. A huge
contingent of skilled professionals and technicians will
reach retirement age in the next 5 to 10 years. At the same
time, there aren’t enough potential replacements coming
up through the educational and training systems to keep
staff shortages at bay.

“This has caused us look at other industries and
nontraditional sources for talent, with the understanding
that we will need to provide intense training so those new
hires have the specific industry knowledge and skills they
need to be successful,” he said.
Addressing the shortfall
Shaw is experiencing shortages in all of the engineering
disciplines, construction management, and project
controls, according to Kiser: “The most critical shortages
are in civil and structural engineering.”

The entire industry is working diligently to identify
new talent to bring into the power industry, says Clark:
Shaw HR executives Lacy Kiser and Harry Clark discussed
“If you attend any college recruiting event around the
these issues in recent interviews. Kiser is human resources

director for the Fossil Power division of Shaw; Clark is

The need for experienced professionals in the power
industry is growing at a tremendous pace, notes Kiser.
“If you combine the current industry need with the fact
that we have gone through an extended period in which
we did not bring in large numbers of new hires to develop
and grow, we are now faced with a hypercompetitive labor
market,” he said.
The situation is even more competitive on the nuclear

Energy Institute.

the work site to professional positions
such as engineering, safety, accounting, human resources,
IT, and other office jobs that support our power projects.”
Recruiting initiatives
Shaw is turning to special recruiting initiatives to address
its most critical staffing shortages, notes Kiser.
“We are committed to a robust college recruitment
program,” he said. “We are looking to identify the most
qualified talent coming out of today’s top universities with
programs that align with our needs.
“For experienced workers, we look at industries that are
similar to ours for opportunities to recruit people who

valuable assets at Shaw.”
The company is also strengthening its partnerships with
a select few recruiting agencies. “We want to build strong
relationships with these key organizations to ensure that
they point top talent in the industry to Shaw,” Kiser said.
Clark added that Shaw has implemented a “comprehensive
orientation process to provide new hires with all of the
information they will need to quickly understand and
embrace Shaw’s culture.
“This is an important piece of our recruitment process,
because it conveys to job candidates that we are committed
to employee development.”
Retention initiatives
Asked whether Shaw is undertaking special retention
initiatives as well, Clark responded, “I wouldn’t call these
initiatives ‘special,’ since we continuously work to retain
talent at Shaw.”
According to Clark, Shaw’s retention strategy is
three-pronged:
• Longevity/security. “We strive to provide employees
with job security by having a strong backlog of work.
Employees want to know that their company will have
significant work in the future, as well as today.”
• Growth opportunities. “Employees want and need
opportunities to grow and develop. Our ‘Professional
Development Program’ provides learning and
developmental opportunities for employees at all stages

of their careers. We also work to ensure that employees
have challenging and rewarding jobs so they feel they
are making a contribution to Shaw’s success.”
• Rewards/recognition. “We are committed to providing
competitive compensation and benefits packages, and
we have programs that provide immediate and longterm rewards for outstanding performance.”
Women and minorities
There are plenty of opportunities to improve recruitment of
qualified women and minorities, Kiser contends: “At Shaw,
we participate in and sponsor a number of job fairs and
other events that focus on women and minority recruiting.
“We are also creating a work environment that is familyfriendly by offering flexible work schedules, telecommuting,
and similar programs.
“We are confident that as word gets out that Shaw is a
family-friendly workplace, we will be seen as employer of
choice, and we will have greater success in recruiting and
retaining top talent—including women and minorities.
Mentoring
The power industry’s workforce is dominated by two
demographics: people nearing retirement age and
employees who were recently in school, notes Clark.
“To help bridge the gap in experience, we are establishing
mentoring programs that will allow our industry veterans
to share their experience and knowledge with lessexperienced employees.

“We are also developing initiatives that will facilitate

HR Insights: The Executives
As human resources
director for The
Shaw Group Inc.’s
Fossil Power business
unit, Lacy Kiser is
responsible for all
human resourcesrelated activities for
that unit.
He has an MS in manageme
management/human resources
management and a BS in organizational
management.
Prior to joining Shaw, Kiser spent a year
with Centex Homes as a division human
resources director. He also spent several
years with Bechtel Corp., holding several
roles of increasing responsibility in human
resources, eventually serving as the human
resources director for one of Bechtel’s global
business units.
Kiser spent 2 years as a Six Sigma Black Belt with
Bechtel. He has 9 years of direct engineering,
procurement, and construction experience.

“There are—and will be—plenty of opportunities for
development and growth in our industry; you just have to
be patient and willing to learn everything you can about
our industry.”
Each employee is responsible for managing his or her own
career, he adds.
For a veteran employee who is approaching retirement but who
wishes to remain somewhat engaged in the industry, Clark
suggests, “Ask your employer what types of programs they have
or are contemplating to allow for more flexible work solutions
to meet your changing lifestyle.

Harry A. Clark Jr. joined
Shaw in April 2007 as director
of human resources for the
company’s nuclear power business
ss
unit. He manages all human
resources activities and is overall
responsible for employee relations,
ns,
management and organization
developments, staffing, diversity
and assisting in general start-up for
China and the US.
Prior to Shaw, Clark was vice-president of human resources
at Greyhound. Before that, he was a consultant for Fischer
Group International—a human resources, executive search, and
executive coaching company—and spent more than 20 years
with ABB Combustion Engineering, most recently as a vicepresident, worldwide nuclear power human resources.
Before entering consulting, Clark had over 25 years experience
in the power, chemical, petrochemical, manufacturing,
and service businesses. Early in his career, he worked for a
multinational oil and gas company, where he assumed overall
responsibility for technical training. Shortly thereafter, Clark
headed up worldwide training and organizational development
for Combustion Engineering.

Time conﬂicts
As most workers in the power industry already know, it can
be extremely difficult to deal with time conflicts while they are
juggling training, continuing education, and mentoring with
an already heavy workload.
“This is an ongoing issue for virtually every organization,”
Kiser noted. “At Shaw, our leadership views training and
development as a benefit rather than a cost. As a result,
Shaw’s managers are very supportive of the company’s
training initiatives.”

“Communicate your desires to remain in the workplace but
express your concerns and identify the types of conditions that
are acceptable.

To help employees balance their workload and the time
required for training, Shaw is experimenting with several ideas.
“For example, we are finding ways to break training programs
that are 1 or 2 days into smaller modules that are spread out
over several weeks.” —EW

“In return, be flexible on the type of work you will accept and
be willing to mentor, share job knowledge, and coach others.”

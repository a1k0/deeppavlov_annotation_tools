Without a cost-effective way to remove high levels of nitrogen, you’ve bypassed
would-be opportunities again and again. Now is the time to stop, go back,
tap into those reserves and start making more money.

BCCK Engineering will help you remove nitrogen from your gas streams quickly, efﬁciently and affordably.
And with nitrogen out of the picture, all that gas — and all those proﬁts — are there for the taking.
Thanks to BCCK, it’s time to get both.

For a personal consultation, call BCCK at 888-518-6459,

COVER
Capital expenditures in the US and Canada will head in different
directions this year, according to OGJ’s annual outlook of upstream
and downstream oil and gas outlays. In the US, budgets call for
capital spending for exploration and production, refining, and other
segments to climb. In Canada, oil sands development is one of the
few growth areas for budgets this year. Meanwhile, spending for
both upstream and downstream projects will continue to climb this
year outside North America.

One 30" Cynara® membrane replaces
75 of our original products, reducing
weight and footprint more than 90%.
Since 1983, we’ve been advancing the science of CO2 removal
from natural gas with Cynara membrane technology. Our latest
fourth generation Cynara membranes are breaking all previous
records for system efﬁciency and cost-effectiveness.
After nearly two years of actual ﬁeld operation, the new 30"
membranes have proven to increase processing feed capacity
while signiﬁcantly reducing total weight and footprint. This is
extremely important on offshore platforms and space-constrained
onshore facilities.

General

Interest

ROV industry to see increased spending
The work-class remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV)
industry has had strong growth as a result of recent sustained high
oil prices. Particularly since 2002, expenditure on work-class ROV
operations has more than doubled, and further strong growth is
expected over the next 5 years, said Douglas-Westwood Ltd. analysts in a recent report.
Total expenditures for the ROV market is forecast to reach $1.46
billion/year by 2011, according to the report entitled “The World
ROV Report 2007-11,” which is based on analysis of demand drivers. “Offshore utilization and ROV dayrates have increased dramatically over the past 5 years and stand at an all-time high,” said lead
analyst Rod Westwood. “Between 2002 and 2006 alone, the workclass dayrate increase was around 30%,” he said.
In 2006, Westwood estimates, $827 million was spent on the
operation of work-class ROV units worldwide, an increase of 86%
on the 2002 value. This is forecast to increase by a further 76% to
a 2011 value of about $1.46 billion—more than three times the
market over the 10-year period, he said.
The study suggests that North America and Western Europe
are expected to account for the largest proportion of ROV activity.
About half of the total ROV units expected to operate in 2007 are
associated with these regions, the report said.
High oil prices have resulted in high levels of drilling activity
and increased installations of subsea wells, pipelines, control cables, and other hardware. Increasing underwater resources, therefore, are required to service the growing numbers of underwater
installations, progressively more in deep waters beyond the economic reach of manned intervention. This all manifests itself in the
building of new drilling rigs and offshore construction vessels, all
of which use ROVs in subsea operations, Westwood said.
The report contends that by the end of the period, more than
120 work-class ROVs/year will need to be built to meet demands
of market growth and attrition of the existing fleet.
“Based on an average cost per unit” the study predicts that
“work-class ROV capex will increase from its 2006 level of $186
million to $247 million by 2011—an increase of 33% over the
period.” Cumulative expenditures, meanwhile, are expected to be
slightly higher than $1 billion over the forecast period.

lowing the latest federal royalty in-kind natural gas sale, the Minerals Management Service said on Mar. 27.
Ten companies submitted successful bids in the Mar. 8 sale for
the 13 contracts involving 137.5 bcf of gas produced from federal leases in the Gulf of Mexico. The gas will be delivered over
7-month or 12-month terms beginning Apr. 1, MMS said.
Winning bidders included Bear Energy LP, Eagle Energy Partners,
Coral Energy LP, Louis Dreyfus Energy Services, National Energy &
Trade LLC, Williams Power Co., BG Group, Total Gas & Power North
America Inc., Fortis Energy Marketing & Trading, and Constellation
Energy Commodities Group Inc.
MMS said bidding was strong in the sale, as 20 companies submitted 152 offers for the RIK gas. It said it based its revenues estimate on the current $7.50/Mcf gas price.

Chavez, Manning sign cross-border gas treaty

Trinidad and Tobago has signed a cross-border treaty with Venezuela, following an agreement concluded in March to jointly develop an estimated 30 tcf of natural gas in offshore fields straddling
the borders of the two nations (OGJ, Mar. 12, 2007, Newsletter).
It is the first such agreement in the Western Hemisphere and is
designed to provide for the production of gas out of the Deltana
area.
Venezuela President Hugo Chavez and Trinidad and Tobago
Prime Minister Patrick Manning, who signed the agreement in Caracas, hailed the treaty as a major step forward, allowing the countries to develop one of the world’s most prolific gas regions.
The first fields to be developed will be Loran and Manatee,
which are estimated to hold 10 tcf of gas—7.3 tcf on the Venezuelan side and 2.7 tcf on the Trinidad and Tobago side. Chevron Corp.
operates Loran and is a partner with BG Group on the Trinidad side
(Manatee), which BG Group operates.
The treaty sets the framework for taxation and other production
issues. However markets for the gas have yet to be determined.
The two countries will decide by mid-April where Loran-Manatee gas will be piped for processing. Manning wants it processed as
LNG in the Caribbean island nation, where it would form the basis
for an additional LNG train.
“We are a producer of LNG at this time and can do it much
quicker than in any other route,” Manning explained. The country
RIK gas sale to bring in $1 billion in revenues
is conducting talks with BG about adding another LNG train at

development. Royale will target the shallow, unconventional Monterey shale and more-conventional deeper reservoirs.
The first project is to complete the Weber 27-27 well in Monterey shale, source rock for the San Joaquin basin. The vertical well
had good oil and gas shows in several intervals before being drilled
horizontally in the deepest of the show zones.
Texas Crude, EOG Resources, and Chevron have produced more
than 7 million bbl of light, sweet oil from Monterey shale in North
Shafter field, the closest analog to Rio Bravo, Royale said.

Paciﬁc Stratus details Colombian ﬁnds
Pacific Stratus Energy Ltd., Toronto, started production tests at a
Llanos basin multizone oil discovery and reported final drillstem
test results at a gas discovery in the Lower Magdalena basin.
The company, operator of the Moriche Block, said the Mauritia
Norte-1 wildcat went to 10,000 ft TMD and cut 6 ft of net pay in
Carbonera C7 topped at 8,726 ft, 5 ft of net pay in Mirador topped
at 8,973 ft, 9 ft of net pay in Gacheta topped at 9,520 ft, and 23 ft
of net pay in Ubaque topped at 9,693 ft.
Oil quality is 38.5° gravity in Mirador and 12.8° gravity in
Ubaque. The Carbonera C7, Gacheta, and Ubaque reservoirs had
253, 214, and 296 ft of gross thickness, respectively.
Pressure gradients were made based on repeat formation
test data, and well-defined water oil contacts were confirmed in
Ubaque and Mirador.
Meanwhile, Pacific Stratus plans to spud the La Creciente2 appraisal well in early April. Calculated absolute open flow at
the discovery well was 208.1 MMcfd of gas based on reservoir
depth pressure data vs. the initially estimated 71.8 MMcfd based on
wellhead surface pressure from Tertiary Cienaga de Oro at 10,93311,572 ft.
Colombia’s National Hydrocarbons Agency awarded Pacific
Stratus 100% working interest in the 216,123-acre Guama Block
near La Creciente.
The company committed to reprocess 300 line-km of seismic
surveys and shoot 200 line-km of new 2D surveys in the first 18
months. The commitment for the second phase is to drill a well.
Pacific Stratus has mapped five gas and oil prospects in the
block. One prospect was proved almost 20 years ago when the
Ligia-1 well flowed 500 Mcfd of gas and 450 b/d of 39° gravity
oil on short tests.

Chevron, partners awarded acreage off Australia

Tower Resources to drill two wells in Uganda
Tower Resources PLC plans to drill two exploration wells on
Block EA5 in western Uganda by 2008 and may also drill a contingent well under the second exploration phase of its Ugandan
license. The government also has extended the company’s initial
exploration period for another 6 months, meaning the license will
now end on Mar. 28, 2008.
Tower Resources will shoot a 250 km, 2D seismic survey in
July and hopes to drill the exploration wells in first half 2008. The
extension of its license will “facilitate optimum management of
the seismic program and implementation of an early exploration
well,” Tower said.
Tower said the drilling program was appropriate, given the recent success in other similar licenses in the Rift Valley, in reference
to Heritage Oil Corp.’s oil find in nearby acreage; Heritage is operator of the Kingfisher-1 exploration well in Uganda (OGJ Online,
Feb. 16, 2007).
Tower’s onshore block covers 6,040 sq km and has Tertiary rift
sediments that hold oil and gas-bearing segments to the south. The
company said the main exploration risk for the unexplored block
is the thermal maturity of source rocks.

Statoil, Sonatrach gauge Hassi Mouina well
Operator Statoil ASA reported its Hassi Mouina exploration and
appraisal well in Algeria has produced gas at 7,083 standard cu m/
hr from a depth of 1,131-42 m. About 9,012 standard cu m/hr of
gas flowed at 1,113-29 m, Statoil said. These results were achieved
through a 32⁄64-in. choke.
Hassi Mouina, drilled to a TD of 3,200 m, is the first onshore
well for Statoil in Algeria. The Norwegian state company partnered
with Algeria’s Sonatrach. The well targeted Devonian reservoir
rocks.
The Hassi Mouina license was awarded in June 2004. It comprises four blocks within an area of 23,000 sq km in the Gourara
basin. The area lies in Algeria’s western desert, northwest of the In
Salah gas field, where Statoil has a 31.85% share.
Statoil and Sonatrach are now drilling their second well, Hassi
Tidjerane West 1 (HTJW-1), in the Sahara Desert. Statoil’s share in
Hassi Mouina is 75% and Sonatrach holds the other 25%.

ExxonMobil signs PSC for Mandar block
ExxonMobil Exploration & Production Indonesia (Mandar) Ltd.
has signed a production-sharing contract with Indonesia for Mandar block in the Makassar Straits off West Sulawesi.
ExxonMobil was the successful bidder for block in Indonesia’s
2006 exploration tender round; the company holds 100% participating interest.
Mandar block, which covers 4,200 sq km, is in the Southern
Makassar basin in water as deep as 2,000 m.
ExxonMobil said Mandar block ownership augments its acreage
position in the Makassar Straits, where it also has a PSC in place for
Surumana block from a previous tender round.

Chevron Australia Pty. Ltd., Perth, and partners have been awarded exploration rights to the W06-12 permit area in the Carnarvon
basin off northwestern Australia.
The acreage, in the Greater Gorgon area of the basin, covers
1,150 sq miles and lies about 60 miles offshore.
Chevron will serve as operator, with a 50% interest in the permit, while partners Shell Development Australia and Mobil Australia Resources Co. Pty. Ltd. each will hold a 25% interest.
The 3-year work program for the permit includes geotechnical
studies, the shooting of 110 miles of 2D seismic, and the drilling

Timan-Pechora joint venture producing oil
The OOO Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG) joint venture has begun oil production from six wells in Yuzhno Khylchuyu field in the
northern Timan-Pechora basin of the Russian Arctic.
Unspecified volumes of oil are being trucked to an existing terminal on Varandey Bay on the Barents Sea for export via tanker
to international markets. An 80-mile pipeline to replace the truck
shipments is due for completion this winter or next winter.
Interests in the joint venture formed in 2005 are OAO Lukoil
70% and ConocoPhillips 30% (OGJ Online, July 1, 2005). ConocoPhillips also has an equity interest in Lukoil.
ConocoPhillips said it expects to spend $1 billion in 2007 in
Russia, split evenly between NMNG and its 9.3% interest in supergiant, Eni-operated Kashagan field in the Caspian Sea.
ConocoPhillips has booked 170 million bbl of reserves or 15%
of the combined ultimate expected bookings from the two projects. Yuzhno Khylchuyu field is the anchor field on the NMNG
acreage block.
The terminal is to be expanded to 240,000 b/d capacity by the
end of 2007. NMNG is expected to be producing and shipping
about 200,000 b/d of oil at peak.

wellhead, itself connected to the Alwyn North processing platform.
“The additional output should enable the Alwyn facilities to continue producing at full capacity until early next decade,” Total said.
Jura, discovered 4 months ago, holds more than 170 million
boe of proved and probable reserves in the Alwyn area, 160 km
east of the Shetland Islands and 440 km northeast of Aberdeen.
The Alwyn area holds the Alwyn North, Dunbar, Ellon, Grant, and
Nuggets fields.
Total is continuing exploration in the UK North Sea with an
appraisal well on Kessog, a high-temperature, high-pressure field
near Elgin Franklin, followed by another exploration well on the
Jura East prospect. Recent discoveries lifted Total’s proved and probable reserves in the UK to over 1 billion boe in 2006.

Pokohura platform off New Zealand on stream
Gas and condensate production from the first of six planned
offshore wells in Pokohura field off New Zealand has begun.
The other wells will be drilled from the production platform,
completed, and tied in to the pipeline to shore during the next 12
months. After drilling, the platform will be unmanned and controlled from onshore facilities.
Three extended-reach wells drilled from onshore locations into
the southern part of the Taranaki basin field started up last September.
Pokohura output will bring the onshore processing plant near
New Plymouth in the North Island to its full capacity of 20 MMcfd
of gas plus condensate during first-quarter 2008.
Pokohura has an estimated 750 bcf of gas reserves. The condensate content is rich, believed to be around 50 million bbl.
The field is operated by Shell Exploration New Zealand Ltd. with
48% interest. Todd Energy and OMV New Zealand hold 26% each.

Construction has begun on a gas-oil separation plant (GOSP)
that will boost production capacity of Saudi Arabia’s Shaybah oil

Energy and venture capital

Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
As a business reporter covering
the peak of the dot-com craze years
ago, I wondered how start-up companies intent on making a fortune off
the internet could attract millions of
venture capital dollars while oil and gas
companies could raise little, if any, VC
financing.
Today, renewable and alternative energy is attracting VC dollars. US Energy
Sec. Samuel W. Bodman acknowledged
this during his February speech to a
Cambridge Energy Research Associates
conference in Houston.
“I can honestly say that for the
first time in my life we are seeing the
venture capital community put sizable amounts of money into energy,”
Bodman said. “This is real money. They
are betting, if you will, that clean, safe,
affordable energy represents the new
innovation frontier.” Formerly, Bodman worked for a VC firm before he
was chief operating officer of Fidelity
Investments.

VC contributions
The National Venture Capital Association is forming a committee of
its members who invest in alternative
energy. One committee goal will be to
educate lawmakers about VC’s contribution to energy-related innovations, a
NVCA spokeswoman said.
Although representing a fraction of
today’s energy supply mix, renewable
and alternative energy is generating

growing revenues and attracting escalating investments, reports Clean Edge
Inc., a research and consulting firm.
Clean Edge collaborated with Nth
Power LLC, an energy technology VC
firm, on Clean Edge’s annual report
“Clean Energy Trends.” Both firms are in
San Francisco.
The report shows US VC investments
in energy technologies rose to $2.4
billion in 2006 from $917 million in
2005. Of total VC investments, energy
tech increased to 9.4% in 2006 from
4.2% in 2005. Over the last 7 years,
investments in energy technologies have
increased from less than 1% of total VC
investments to nearly 10% (see table).

invested $1 billion primarily for infrastructure plays associated with ethanol,
biodiesel, and solar rather than for
technology development, he said.
The Clean Edge report said global
annual revenue for four benchmark
technologies—solar photovoltaic
(PV), wind power, biofuels, and fuel
cells—“ramped up nearly 39% in 1
year—from $40 billion in 2005 to
$55 billion in 2006. We forecast that
they will continue on this trajectory to
become a $226 billion [worldwide]
market by 2016.”
Clean Edge cofounder and principal
Ron Pernick attributed annual revenue
growth rates in these technologies
to various factors, including growing concern about response to climate
change. He said market growth for solar
and wind has been “more akin to the
computer, wireless, and internet than
traditional energy sectors like coal,
natural gas, oil, and nuclear.”

Costs rising

Pernick noted increased production

SUSTAINABLE ENERGY—1

The economic dimension
In discussions about world energy systems,
sustainable development properly has become the
central topic. While the subject is a vital concern,
however, the phrase itself can mean nearly anything.
Phrases that mean nearly anything too readily become tools of propaganda.
Well-meaning groups have defined “sustainable development” in many and mostly constructive ways. The classic statement came from former
Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland,
who said sustainable development “meets the needs
of the present without compromising the ability of
future generations to meet their own needs.” Little
improvement is needed.

‘Not hydrocarbon’
Applied to energy, however, Brundtland’s statement too readily comes to mean “not hydrocarbon.” In popular judgment, an energy form is
unsustainable if it comes from a depleting resource
or alters the environment when produced or used,
especially if it emits carbon dioxide. So if it’s oil,
gas, or coal, it’s unsustainable. Anything else is
sustainable and therefore preferable. This reasoning,
motivated by a wholesome yearning for sustainability, explains the frantic political favor now bestowed
around the world on renewable and other alternative energy forms. It also sometimes conflicts with
good sense.
Both the lack of sustainability ascribed to fossil
energy and the sustainability attributed to everything else tend to be exaggerated. The ambiguity
allows propagandists to bend the concept to suit
political and commercial agendas.
For example, hydrogen enthusiasts contrast the
virtually limitless supply of their favorite energy
carrier with the finite nature of fossil energy resources. Yet depletion isn’t the only limit applicable
to energy forms. Hydrogen itself has a daunting
constraint: the need to detach it from other atoms
and to use large amounts of energy to do the job.
Similarly, the supply of plant wastes that might
someday be feedstock for ethanol can seem limitless, too. But accumulating the material into concentrations useful for energy-intensive processing
requires external work comparable to what nature
already has performed for fossil energy. If fossil

forms are unsustainable because they come from
depleting resources, alternatives that require more
energy to make usable than they yield are no less so.
Just as all energy forms have limits that in some
way compromise sustainability, all energy sources
affect the environment when produced and converted into work. The allure of hydrogen—to cite
that example again—is that its combustion or use
in a fuel cell yields only water. But the same can’t
be said of the energy required to liberate hydrogen
from carbon or oxygen. And nearly every energy
form that substitutes for CO2-emitting fossil energy
has oil, gas, or coal burning somewhere in its background.
Sustainability distortions typically fail to account
fully for the economic imperatives of meeting
current and future needs of people. A fuel cell that
propels a passenger vehicle seems more sustainable
than a gasoline engine when the analysis considers
only vehicle emissions. But if hydrogen for the fuel
cell costs more than gasoline and represents more
energy used in processing than reaches the vehicle,
the fuel cell is in no way sustainable. It can’t compete. To be sustainable, an energy form has to be
affordable to use and profitable to produce—preferably without subsidies, which are to sustainable
energy what bribes are to responsive government.

Macro sustainability
Furthermore, the economic dimension of sustainability applies at the macro level. Developed
economies usually pollute less overall than undeveloped ones do; economies that use fossil energy develop faster than those that do not. Ideas about sustainability must accommodate the proposition that
people who drive to work in automobiles tend not
to be people who must burn dung in their homes
to cook and stay warm. Both economic systems pollute; the mobile one supports life better. Sustainable
energy thus might be said to meet present needs
efficiently while bequeathing future generations
economic progress, social stability, and technical
advance—everything any generation should need to
solve its problems, environmental and otherwise.
Lately, the global energy system has taken some
unsustainable turns, about which more will be
written here next week. ✦

Capital spending for oil and gas activities in the US will rise this year but
at a slower rate than last year. In 2006,
upstream spending surged as a result of
increased activity and high costs as oil
prices held firm.
Meanwhile, total capital spending
in Canada will decline this year, but
spending for oil sands development
there will continue to climb.
Total capital
expenditures for
upstream and
downstream oil
and gas projects
in the US during
2007 will be $183
billion, up from
$176 billion last year. In 2005 spending
totaled $135 billion.
In Canada, total capital spending will
dip to $50 billion from $53 billion last
year and $45 billion 2 years ago.
Upstream spending outside the US
and Canada will also increase, but indi-

SPECIAL

Capital Spending Outlook

cations are that such expenditures will
grow much more slowly than they did
a year ago. Oil and gas activity in Asia
remains heavy, with a wealth of upstream and downstream projects under
way and planned.
OGJ’s 2007 upstream spending
forecast is based on estimates of drilling activity and costs, as well as what
companies report for their upcoming
18

budgets and past capital expenditures.
Annual changes to downstream spending are determined by the capital budget plans reported by refiners, petrochemical plants, pipeline operators, and
others, in addition to individual project
announcements.
All amounts reported are in US dollars unless otherwise indicated.

US upstream spending
Upstream oil and gas expenditures in
the US this year will climb nearly 4%.
Total spending for exploration, drilling,
and production activity will total almost
$162 billion, OGJ forecasts.
The basis of this estimate is OGJ’s
drilling forecast, which projected that
the total number of well completions in
the US will be 47,003 this year (OGJ,
Jan. 15, 2007, p. 31).
Outlays for drilling and exploration
in the US this year will be $135.1 billion, compared with $130.5 billion last
year and $96.7 billion in 2005.
Included in that total
are geological and geophysical expenditures,
which this year will
amount to $12.6 billion.
Capital outlays for production also will climb
3.5% this year to $25.7
billion.
Companies collectively
will spend less on bonus
payments related to Outer
Continental Shelf lease
sales this year. OGJ forecasts that such payments
will total $850 million,
down from $914 million
last year.
The US Minerals
Management Service has scheduled
three lease sales for 2007. One each is
scheduled for tracts in the Western Gulf
of Mexico, the Central Gulf of Mexico,
and the Beaufort Sea.
During 2006, the MMS held two
lease sales. The first one, for acreage in
the Central Gulf of Mexico, resulted
in $582 million in bonus payments.
The other sale, for the Western Gulf

of Mexico, produced $332 million in
bonus payments.
The 2007 capital budgets of large
integrated oil and gas companies based
in the US show that much of these
firms’ upstream spending will occur
outside the US. At the same time, most
US-based independent producers will
devote the majority of their expenditures to projects in the US.
Chevron Corp. has budgeted $19.6
billion for capital and exploratory
expenditures during 2007, with $14.6
billion earmarked for upstream spending. The majority of this is likely to
be spent on projects outside the US.
During 2006, Chevron spent 68% of
its upstream capital outlays on projects
outside the US.
ExxonMobil Corp., which has announced a 2007 budget of $16 billion
for worldwide upstream capital expenditures, last year spent just 15% of such
outlays in the US.
In contrast, Marathon Oil Corp.
announced that it has allocated the
majority of its exploration and production (E&P) spending to projects in the
US. With total upstream spending set at
$2.23 billion this year, Marathon will
spend 60% on US projects.
Meanwhile, large independent
producer Anadarko Petroleum Corp. has
budgeted $4 billion to this year’s capital
program and plans to spend 25% of it
in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and
28% in the Rocky Mountain area. The
company plans to spend up to 16% of
its budget outside the US.

Processing expenditures
OGJ forecasts that capital spending in
the US in all other oil and gas categories
will grow 9% from last year. These categories include refining, petrochemicals,
pipelines, LNG, corporate, and others.
Refining expenditures will decline
following an upsurge during 2006.
OGJ projects that capital spending at
US refineries this year will decline to
$8.3 billion from 2006 spending of $9
billion.
Last year, capital improvements at
refineries to meet clean-fuels require-

ments caused a 25% surge in outlays.
This year spending will shift toward
expanding capacity at existing refineries. There still are no advanced plans to
build a new refinery in the US.
Holly Corp. will expand the crude
capacity at its Navajo refinery in New
Mexico and at its Woods Cross refinery
in Utah with revamps to existing units
and new equipment.
And Marathon will increase the
crude processing capacity at its
Garyville, La., refinery by 180,000 b/d
in a project expected to cost $3.2 billion.
Valero Energy Corp. has estimated its
capital budget for 2007 at $3.5 billion,
down from $3.73 billion last year. In
2005, the refiner’s capital spending
totaled $2.6 billion. This year’s declines
are due to a $775 million drop in
clean-fuels and other regulatory outlays
as its strategic and sustaining expenditures climb 25% from a year ago.

Other US outlays
Pipeline expenditures in the US will
grow following last year’s big decline.
OGJ forecasts that spending for US
natural gas lines will climb 50%. Meanwhile, outlays for crude and product
lines will total $970 million, up from
$162 million last year.
Plans call for a total of 2,050 miles
of gas pipelines to be completed this
year, mostly larger than 30 in. in

in diameter.
Capital expenditures at petrochemical plants will total $840 million this
year, up nearly 8%. In 2006, petrochemical spending in the US moved
up at about the same rate, but the big
growth area for petrochemicals is Asia,
especially China.
Last year ExxonMobil increased its
capital spending for US petrochemicals
to $280 million from $243 million in
2005. Also last year, Chevron’s petrochemical capital spending in the US
climbed 35% to $146 million.
Huntsman Corp. plans to spend $40

its US base chemicals and polymers
business and will require additional
outlays to repair its olefins plant in Port
Arthur, Tex., which was damaged by a
fire in April 2006. The total cost of the
clean-up, engineering, and rebuild was
estimated at $110 million.
Marketing expenditures in the US
this year will decline 3.5%. Marathon

plans to reduce these expenditures from
a year ago, while Hess will leave such
outlays unchanged. Hess plans to expand its retail network and add convenience stores to existing retail gasoline

Miscellaneous expenditures, which
include capital expenditures for LNG
terminals, will climb this year to $4 billion. Four LNG terminals are currently
under construction in the US. The total
costs of these projects are reported to
range from $400 million to $1 billion
each.
Corporate costs and other nonpetroleum activities are also included in the
miscellaneous category. OGJ forecasts
that the total of these expenditures will
increase more than 10% from last year.

Expenditures in Canada
Total oil and gas industry capital
expenditures in Canada will decline 6%
this year.
E&P spending will be down 10% as
rising costs and a shortage of labor and
equipment suppress activity. Allocations
for spending in most upstream and
downstream categories are lower from
a year ago, but oil sands spending will
continue to increase.
OGJ forecasts that exploration and
drilling capital expenditures in Canada
this year will be $23.5 billion. This
compares to the all-time high of $26.1
billion last year and $21.8 billion
spent 2 years ago. Production costs will
decline at the same rate, totaling $9.75
billion this year.
In 2005 there were 26,951 well
completions in Canada, according to
the Canadian Association of Petroleum
20

Producers (CAPP). Of this total, 59%
were gas wells.
OGJ’s most recent drilling forecast
estimates that well completions in
Canada during 2006 totaled 24,185.
The forecast called for 22,233 well
completions this year.
CAPP’s latest figures also show that in
2005 capital expenditures for oil sands
development in Canada totaled $10.4
billion (Can.). That was up 69% from a
year earlier. These figures include capital
expenditures for in situ developments,
mining, and upgraders.
OGJ forecasts that capital spending
for oil sands in Canada this year will
rise to $12 billion from $11 billion last
year.
Downstream capital expenditures
in Canada will decline 8% from last
year. Refining outlays are the largest
component of this group but will be
little changed from a year ago. Pipeline
spending is the most flexible component in the group.
Canadian refinery outlays will
decline 1% to $3.05 billion. Last year,
such outlays were a bit lower than during 2005, when projects to meet cleanfuels regulations were gearing up.
One firm that has budgeted more
money this year than last for capital
spending at its refineries is PetroCanada. The company has earmarked
funds for a conversion of its Edmonton
refinery and for engineering a coker at

its Montreal refinery.
Pipeline spending in Canada will
post the biggest decline of all expenditures this year, as plans call for little
construction. OGJ forecasts that outlays
for crude and products pipelines this
year will be $78 million, down from
$510 million last year and $660 million 2 years ago. No capital outlays are
expected for gas pipelines in Canada
this year.
Petrochemical capital expenditures
will grow to $300 million from $270
million last year, mostly due to projects
required to meet environmental regulations.
Nova Chemicals, for example,
estimates that its 2007 environmental
capital spending will be $32 million
for pollution abatement and remedial
programs. This is up from $8 million
last year and $12 million in 2005.

Spending elsewhere
Capital spending outside the US
and Canada will grow again this year,
spurred by international oil companies
and national oil companies ramping up
production.
ConocoPhillips announced that its
2007 E&P capital program in Europe,
Asia, Africa, and the Middle East will
be about $4.9 billion. The company’s
projects in the North Sea include continued development of Britannia field
in the UK and development of Alvheim
and Statfjord fields, as well as ongoing
development of existing and new opportunities in Norway’s Ekofisk area.
In the Asia Pacific region, most of the
funding will support ConocoPhillips’s
continued development of Bohai Bay in
China, oil and gas reserves offshore in
Block B and onshore South Sumatra in
Indonesia, and fields off Malaysia and
Vietnam.
ConocoPhillips also said its funding
in Africa is primarily for the ongoing
development of its Waha concession in
Libya and several oil leases in Nigeria.
And in the Middle East, the company
will focus its spending on the Qatargas
III LNG facility in Qatar.

BP, OSHA, API draw ﬁre in hearing about reﬁnery blast
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
Questions during a US House committee hearing about the fatal 2005
refinery explosion in Texas City, Tex.,
hinted at toughened plant inspections
and an end to voluntary industry standards.
Members of the Education and Labor
Committee criticized BP America Inc.’s
failure to implement process safety procedures developed by the oil industry at
the company’s 446,500 b/cd Texas City
refinery and the US Occupational Safety
and Health Administration’s enforcement of federal workplace safety laws.
They also slapped American Petroleum
Institute safety standards with which
members can choose not to comply.
The Mar. 23, 2005, accident, involving C5-C6 isomerization unit, killed 15
workers and injured 180.
“The BP explosion was the biggest
workplace disaster in 18 years, yet it
received very little congressional scrutiny until today. Even more upsetting is
that 2 years after this catastrophe, we’re
still seeing a disturbing pattern of major
fires and explosions at US refineries,”
said Chairman George Miller (D-Calif.).
He said that over several months the
committee will examine issues including “OSHA’s failure to issue important
standards to protect American workers,
the Bush administration’s transforma26

tion of OSHA from a law enforcement
organization into a so-called ‘voluntary
compliance organization,’... the chronic
under-reporting of workplace injuries
and illnesses, and the agency’s ineffective penalty structure.”
Howard P. “Buck” McKeon (R-Calif.), the committee’s senior minority
member, said primary responsibility for
the accident rests with BP. “The repeated
accidents and number of citations at the
Texas City facility should have alerted
management to the potential for imminent danger,” he said. BP “cannot
be—and, indeed, has not been—given
a pass for its failings,” McKeon said,
noting that the company will pay “the
largest fine in OSHA’s history.”

Recurring problems
In its final report issued on Mar. 20
about the accident, the US Chemical
Safety Board said many recurring safety
problems previously identified in BP
internal audits, reports, and investigations led to the accident (OGJ Online,
Mar. 20, 2007).
The refinery is regulated under
OSHA’s Process Safety Management
(PSM) standard, which was issued in
1992 as a result of chemical accident
provisions included in the 1990 Clean
Air Act amendments, CSB Chairwoman
Carolyn W. Merritt told the committee.
The accident likely would not have occurred if the standard, which requires

covered facilities to implement 14
management elements to prevent catastrophic releases of hazardous substances, had been applied, she explained.
“Federal regulators did not conduct
any comprehensive, planned process
safety inspections at the Texas City
refinery. In fact, our investigation found
that in the 10 years from 1995 to 2005,
federal OSHA only conducted nine such
inspections anywhere in the country,
and none in the refining sector,” Merritt
said.
Other witnesses included API Pres.
Red Cavaney; Nuclear Safety Institute
Pres. Frank “Skip” Bowman, who served
on the independent panel chaired by
former US Sec. of State James A. Baker
III which BP assembled to investigate
the fire and explosion; Kim Nibarger,
health and safety specialist with the
United Steelworkers of America; and
Eva Rowe, whose parents died in the
accident.
The panel did not include representatives of either BP or OSHA. Edwin D.
Foulke Jr., assistant US labor secretary
for OSHA, said in a statement on the
day CSB issued its final report that it
confirmed OSHA’s findings.
The agency will conduct more than
100 refinery inspections this year and
is implementing a national emphasis
program “to ensure that every refinery
under its jurisdiction is inspected and
all employees are protected,” Foulk said.

Infrequent inspections
But committee member Phil Hare
(D-Ill.) said it was inexcusable that
OSHA had not conducted frequent
inspections at the Texas City refinery
before the accident. “What is the problem? Does it have enough inspectors?”
he asked Merritt. “The rule is there for
inspections to be done,” Merritt replied.
“OSHA intended to do this every few
months or years, but it was never able
to implement its plan. We’ve found
states and local governments, including
Contra Costa County in California, that
do a better job, including inspections
every 3 years.”
Cavaney said he agreed that more
frequent inspections would be an
improvement because situations at
refineries and chemical plants change
over time. He also said the US oil
industry has an active program of 500
recommended standards and practices,
including approximately 110 related to
refinery process safety.
While these did not include recommendations for safe placement of contractors’ trailers in a refinery before the
fire and explosion at the Texas City refinery, API began to develop one as soon
as this was identified as a major factor
in the accident. The association expects
to be ready to adopt the recommendation later this spring, Cavaney said.

‘No teeth’
Other committee members and
witnesses wondered if this voluntary
approach is sufficient.
“I’m deeply disturbed that one of
your members can decide not to implement your practices while still getting
the benefit of being part of your organization with its high standards,” said
Rep. Carol Shea-Porter (D-NH). “Basically, your organization has no teeth.”
Merritt observed, “The problem
with voluntary programs is that not everybody volunteers.” She noted that in
its other investigations and examinations of refineries, CSB has found some
that surpass API’s standards, others
that meet them, and others that ignore
them.

Plant safety
under review

M

ore than 2 years later, shock
waves from the Mar. 23, 2005,
blast and fire that killed 15 people
and injured 180 at BP America’s
Texas City installation are increasingly
being felt in plant safety. Everyone
agrees that improvements are needed.
The most likely results include
stronger enforcement of existing
rules and enactment of additional
regulations. Witnesses at the US
House Education and Labor Committee’s Mar. 22 hearing criticized
the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration for not conducting
more planned process safety management (PSM) inspections at the Texas
City refinery and other refineries and
chemical plants. OSHA announced
the same day that it is hiring more
inspectors and doing more inspections.
Proper inspections take time
and money. When the federal PSM
standard was created in the 1990s,
OSHA envisioned a highly technical, complex, and lengthy process
called a program quality verification
inspection for regulated facilities, according to US Chemical Safety Board
Chairwoman Carolyn W. Merritt.“The
inspections would take weeks or
months at each facility and would be
conducted by a select, well-trained,
and experienced team. Indeed,
thoroughly inspecting a 1,200-acre
complex with 30 major process
units, such as the Texas City refinery,
is no small undertaking and requires
at least that level of effort,” she said.

Near misses
Several witnesses want more.
Kim Nibarger, a health and safety
specialist with United Steelworkers,

estimated that 98% of all releases of
hazardous substances, especially hydrocarbons, never result in ignition.
“Any number of these releases, had
they found an ignition source, could
have resulted in consequences as
tragic as Texas City,” Nibarger said.
Such “near-misses” troubled committee members because they are not
always formally reported. They may
be discussed in oil industry forums
such as the American Petroleum
Institute’s standards and practices
committees. But the procedures that
emerge are recommendations, not
requirements. API Pres. Red Cavaney
told the committee that the existing
program works because it is voluntary.

Other initiatives
Cavaney said API is part of the
OSHA Alliance, which has brought
stakeholders together to examine
process safety issues. He also said the
industry will join the steelworkers
union in studying worker fatigue,
which CSB said contributed to the
Texas City accident. “Safety is a continuous improvement process,” he
observed. Committee members want
more enforcement. “A terrific case
has been made this morning about
why we need mandatory oversight
from OSHA and how we should give
it the necessary resources,” said Rep.
John P. Sarbanes (D-Md.).
President George W. Bush has
requested from Congress an increase
to $490.3 million for OSHA in fiscal 2008 from the agency’s $472.4
million budget under the 2007
continuing resolution. The enforcement budget would increase to $183
million from $172.6 million. ✦

Responding to an inquiry by Miller,
Bowman said the Nuclear Safety Institute requires its members to follow
standards or be expelled. The group
adopted this policy following the 1979
incident at the Three Mile Island power
plant in Pennsylvania. Bowman said the
Baker report recommends that oil refiners implement a similar approach.
Refiners already are applying recommendations from the Baker and CSB
investigations to their operations, according to Cavaney. He said API intends

to work with the United Steelworkers to
develop new refining workplace safety
procedures as CSB has recommended.
But Rep. Rush D. Holt (D-NJ) was
skeptical. He asked Cavaney if API
would support increasing OSHA’s staff,
training, and general resources; making OSHA require reporting of close
calls and warning events; requiring
that injury reports be kept for each site,
including for contractors and others
involved in dangerous activities; imple-

menting a process to review audits; and
requiring OSHA to devote its resources
to enforcement instead of voluntary
programs and partnerships. Cavaney
said he would supply answers as soon
as he could get them.
Miller also was critical. “Companies
can say they belong to an organization
that’s on the cutting edge of technology
and safety but not follow its recommendations,” he said. “I think we’re reaching a point where API could become an
enabler of very bad behavior.” ✦

Orr said. In the future, the petroleum

international. “There are a couple of

of [western] expatriates, as we interviewed companies and
talked about their strategies, what we heard more was very
definitive plans and strategies to build those national workforces.” US and European companies are recruiting experienced professionals from other parts of the world “because
that is good for them in the work that they’re doing in those
countries but also because that’s where some of the newer
talent is coming from,” he said.
“Good project mangers are the new rock stars of the
industry,” said David Hobbs, vice-president and managing
director of global research at Cambridge Energy Research
Associates, during the group’s annual energy conference in
Houston in early February.
At that same meeting, Farouk Al Zanki, chairman and
managing director, Kuwait Oil Co. said his company plans to
increase its oil production to 4 million b/d by 2020, which
means finding new ways to develop relationships with international oil companies. He also emphasized the need for a
highly skilled workforce; KOC expects to have 8,000 employees by 2015, up from 5,000 today.
MMC did an external labor market analysis of the current
population of workers on a global basis to understand the
trends for people entering engineering and other programs.
The purpose is “to understand what the trends will be over
time” compared with “companies’ perceptions of where
their own labor forces are going,” Orr said.
The study found that employers need to be looking to
provide more challenge to younger employees. Oil and gas
companies are able to recruit new employees, although “they
have to pay them a surfeit of money these days, but the real
challenge is in holding onto experienced workers,” said Orr.
“So once folks have been there some years and salary levels
tend to plateau, those workers are looking for more challenges in their careers. They want more responsibility. They
want to move up to next level. And often when they are
leaving one company for another, they’re not leaving only for
more money but for what they think is going to be a better
opportunity.”
To cope with such problems, companies are developing
more structured career paths, especially for skilled workers
or those approaching managerial levels. Under such systems,
Orr said, “Workers can understand where they may go over
a 15-year period, what kind of moves might they actually
make over that time, so they continue to be excited and continue to see that company as a good place to stay.”
He said, “It may sound intuitive, but I think that in the
past only a few companies have done a really good job at
that, with maybe the service companies doing a better job
than some of the big oil companies.”
When it comes to retaining experienced workers, Orr
said, “I think there’s a common perception that it is all about
money. I think the reality is you have to be competitive [in
pay], but what you also have to provide is the right culture,
the right opportunity for growth over time, and the flexibilOil & Gas Journal / Apr. 2, 2007

of a corporate culture “that will be selfperpetuating, in people wanting to stay,
wanting to excel, and wanting to push
the company forward. Some companies
are beginning to do this; others are just
now starting to recognize this and to
put some programs and priorities into
place.”
A number of companies are establishing training centers in countries
where they want to build national
workforces, establishing coordinated
programs with local universities, and
integrating that national workforce into
the international company’s broader
workforce. What that may mean for
those companies and their employees
“is something that companies are just
now starting to consider in their career
paths. Do those national workforces just
stay there [in their native countries]?
Do they get integrated into the company over time? Do they become expatriates in other places?” Orr asked.
“I think the industry has a large
opportunity to have a culture shift to
allow it to be more successful on the
people front. Industry has lot of smart
people who recognize this as well but
who need to focus their efforts and
attention,” he said. “There are a lot of
dollars at stake, so it benefits companies
to make sure their dollars are spent
wisely by testing some of these things
before committing those dollars to it.”
It is not a simple matter of putting
equal money into each “bucket,” he
said. “It’s about setting priorities and
dealing with them in order.” Most
companies have strength in some areas
and should invest more in the areas
where they are weak. Some employers
have the perception “that it is all about
the aging workforce,” said Orr. Loss of
workers through retirement is certainly
an issue in the US. “But it is not a
global issue,” he said. “While we may
expect to see larger experience gaps in

the US, in places such as Asia, that is
not the case.”
More mergers and acquisitions are
likely over the next few years. “But I
think that has settled some,” said Orr.
“Related to that, one of the areas where
companies probably are not doing as
good today is effective integration of
workforce planning with operation
plans.” He said, “A number of companies know what they want to do
within the next year and have plans for
that. But if you ask them where they
are going to be 3-5 years from now in
terms of the fields they are going to be
operating in, they may have some ideas
but they probably have not yet linked it
back to the resources they need to do it,
including the people.”
Orr said, “Acquiring the people
resources as well as rigs and other infrastructure becomes a longer planning
horizon in terms of what companies

need to do. That means they need better development of strategic planning
capabilities and linking those to resource requirements and securing those
requirements much earlier.”

Performance simulation
Performance simulation “is one
way to capture the loss of experience
and transfer it to new employees,” said
Parrish K. Potts, a partner in Accenture,
at the Cambridge Energy Research Associates annual energy conference in
Houston in early February.
Performance simulation is similar
to a flight simulator applied to business situations, enabling users to gain
“job experience” in the same way that
a flight simulator allows a pilot to gain
“flight experience” on the ground that
will improve his performance at the
controls of a real airplane. Accenture’s
website quotes one satisfied client as

saying, “Twenty-four hours on a performance simulator is equal to 4 years of
job experience.” Learners are challenged
to achieve specific, real-world business
objectives and master the fundamentals of general business skills or those
unique to their business, said company
officials.
It can teach sales staff the best
practice behaviors for traditional and
nontraditional interactions with customers that result in increased sales and
sales conversion rates. It generally can
improve the efficiency and effectiveness
of customer service representatives, resulting in increased sales, reduced cost,
and greater customer satisfaction. The
company provides several ready-to-use
simulations available in supply chain
management, customer relationship
management, leadership development,
and other general business operations. ✦

close our eyes and cross our fingers,”
Miliband said. We need to step up our
action to tackle it, building on our
considerable progress so far. And time
isn’t on our side. Government must
rightly lead from the front on this,
but we want everyone—the public,
industry, Parliament—to have their say
to help us ensure that the bill really
delivers.”
A spokeswoman from the UK Offshore Operators’ Association (UKOOA)
said the industry was already moving
to reduce emissions, particularly the
growing switch from coal and oil to
gas, which has helped the UK meet its
Kyoto target.
“Despite an increase in energy demand of 10% over the last 15 years and
a slight increase in CO2 emissions since
2002, overall the UK has recorded a reduction in CO2 emissions since 1990,”
she added.

Many oil companies are involved in
the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. “Carbon capture and storage in a geological
structure such as a suitable mature oil
or gas reservoir under the North Sea is
being promoted as a possible method
of enabling low-carbon electricity
production. This is emerging technology, and there are still not insignificant
economic and operational hurdles to
overcome,” the UKOOA spokeswoman
said.
Critics have scorned establishing
another independent body to produce
reports and monitor progress on reaching carbon targets, and it is unlikely that
the government can get the bill through
Parliament without changes.
Michael Woods, head of the environment group at Stephenson Harwood
law firm, told OGJ that many more
details were needed before businesses
could plan their future operations with

certainty. “It is important for business
to engage and influence the outcome
because they will be significantly affected.”
Woods said one very contentious
issue is whether the 5-year cycles to reduce emissions should be transformed
into annual targets. “Under the bill,
the emissions-trading element is set up
with enabling powers, but it doesn’t go
into the nitty-gritty of the social and
economic effects; it’s one thing to target
big polluters, but quite another to look
at big businesses, retail, and the general
public.”
The government’s public consultation period closes Jun.12, but whether
Parliament can enact the bill any time
soon remains to be seen, as the ruling
Labour Party faces difficult times ahead
when its leader Tony Blair leaves later
this year, opening the door to a possible
leadership contest. ✦

e recently were talking with a
Turkish friend who said intelligent oil people are not going to
be fooled by the latest efforts of the
Greeks. According to our friend, under
the guise of conducting yet another
archaeological investigation of Homer,
their great epic poet, the Greeks have
really authorized a search for oil.
The Turk was agitated last week
when word broke of a geological engineering company agreeing to help
in an archaeological project to find
the island of Ithaca, which Homer’s
legendary hero Odysseus was supposed to have ruled.
Although the western Greek island
of Ithaki is generally accepted as the
Homeric site, scholars have long been
troubled by a mismatch between its
location and geography and those of
the Ithaca described by Homer.

Seeking Ithaca
In fact, Robert Bittlestone, a
management consultant, believes that
the peninsula of Paliki on the Ionian
island of Cephallonia, near Ithaki, is
the real location of Odysseus’ homeland. Bittlestone thinks that Paliki
used to form a separate island before
earthquakes and landslides filled in a
narrow sea channel dividing it from
Cephallonia.
To test Bittlestone’s theory, engineers and geologists will examine
rock where Bittlestone believes a narrow sea channel once existed.
Our Turk, though, said we need to
consider a little more about Bittlestone and Odysseus Unbound, the
book he has written with two other
people. In our Turk’s narrow-eyed
view of the Greek enterprise, the
evidence points to conspiracy.
34

Bittlestone was educated in classics
and science before reading economics at the University of Cambridge. But he also is the founder of
Metapraxis Ltd., a company specializing in the detection of early warnings
for multinational companies.

Seeking signs
Our Turkish friend raised his
eyebrows at that expression, “early
warnings for multinational companies” and gave the nod-nod, winkwink to let us know the signs the
archaeologists are seeking: hydrocarbons under the Mediterranean.
As evidence of that, he said John
Underhill, one of Bittlestone’s coauthors, is chair of stratigraphy at the
University of Edinburgh and associate professor in the department of
petroleum engineering, Heriot-Watt
University.
He then began to tell us how
Fugro Group, along with Bittlestone
and the Greek Geological Society, will
use high-tech surveying equipment
that might be used in oil-and-gas
exploration for the Ithaca project.
Personally, I think our Turk was a
little overexcited due to the issue of
oil in waters off Cyprus, which Turkey disputes, where international oil
companies are lining up for lucrative
permits.
He also may have read that Mediterranean Oil & Gas PLC swung to
a first half pretax profit and expects
to spud its key Monte Gross and
Ombrina Mare wells in 2007. Who
knows what Homer found on Ithaca,
wherever it may lie. But in the search
for Ithaca, pace our Turk, should we
worry if a lot of oil is found along
the way? ✦

US natural gas reserves increased for
the eighth consecutive year in 2006 as
producers drilled a record 30,000 wells,
the American Gas Association reported
in its latest annual estimate of domestic
supplies.
Reserves grew to more than 205 tcf
at yearend 2006 from 204 tcf a year
earlier, placing them at their highest
point since 1978, according to AGA.
Its annual estimate is based on
reported figures from a sample of 30
reserves holders representing more than
half of the total US booked reserves and
slightly less than half of all US production, AGA said. Noting that 2006’s total
US gas completions were a record last
year, Chris McGill, AGA’s managing director of policy analysis and the report’s
author, said most of the wells were
drilled onshore in shales, tight sands,
and coal seams.
“It takes many of these smaller wells
to sustain production. Growing reserves
inventories do not necessarily mean
that domestic production capacity is
dramatically increasing,” he said.
AGA’s latest analysis predicts that
annual US gas production capacity will
remain at 18-19 tcf for the foreseeable
future without significant policy decision to open access to more potential
gas resources.
McGill also said the “shelf life” of
current US gas reserves has increased
to an estimated 11 years in 2006 from
about 9 years in 2001. He attributed
this to a marked shift to lower-yield
reservoirs such as shales and coal seams
from traditional producing wells.
“The good news is that a solid
productive capacity baseline is being
established. The bad news is that it takes
many more wells to sustain productive
capacity as more traditional production
is depleted,” he pointed out. ✦

GIANT FIELD
TRENDS—1

& DEVE

Giant fields (estimated ultimate recovery of 500 million bbl of oil and-or
3 tcf of gas or more) exist in every major region of the world, and have been
discovered throughout the history of
the petroleum industry (Figs. 1a to 1g).
The seven world regional maps represent 15 decades. The period extends
from 19th century discoveries dependent on oil seeps and surface structures, drilled
and produced
with minimal
technology; to
21st century
discoveries dependent upon
sophisticated
geophysical tools and elegant geologic
models and highly technical drilling
and production techniques.
No better example of the application
of modern production technology is
found than at the largest oil discovery
of the present decade: Kashagan field

Kashagan is expected to recover 13
billion bbl of oil. To be developed in
phases, its expected production steps
are 75,000 b/d at first, gradually increasing to 450,000 b/d, and ultimately
reaching 1.2 million b/d.
Of the 33 giant oil field discoveries in the decade that began with the
year 2000 in addition to Kashagan,
the following are the most important:

Production

O D U C T I O N

A multiphase meter used for testing wells producing heavy oil led to
increased production and improved
the understanding of reservoirs in the
Yombo field, off Congo (Brazzaville).
A unit of Perenco SA operates the
field that produces an average 17°
gravity oil with a 2,200 cp viscosity at
80° F.
Well testing of heavy oil production is
complex
because
most
conventional
surface
testing
equipment provides unreliable measurements. This unreliability derives
from test-vessel instability (low GOR),
foaming, or fluid separation problems.
Well tests in the off-Congo field
before use of multiphase meters overestimated oil production by more than
25% even when total liquid flow rate
was more or less acceptable.

Perenco operations
Off Congo, Perenco operates Yombo
and Emeraude fields (Fig. 1). Yombo
fields has a relative simple anticlinal
dome structure with little faulting.
Halokinetic movement of underlying
salt created the structures.
The Sendji carbonate is the primary
reservoir. This reservoir is heterogeneous with very variable permeability.
The variability creates uncertainties in
predicting the performance of this single layer reservoir that is predominantly
sandy dolomite with sand interbeds.
The reservoir has good 20-25% porosity and permeability up to 3,000 md,
but the low reservoir pressure makes
production difficult.
Another secondary reservoir is the
Tchala sandstone, composed predominantly of dolomitic sands with 25-30%
porosity and permeabilities up to 2,000
md. The Tchala has multiple layers in
which Perenco has identified all oilwater contacts.
The Yombo field, discovered in 1989,
began producing in 1991. Perenco
acquired the field in 2003 and began
producing it from two platforms tied
to a floating production, storage, and
offloading (FPSO) vessel (Fig. 2).

Oil production, 1,000 b/d

Production from the fields during
the last 4 years has decreased by more
than 35% to the current 10,000 bo/d,
while bs&w increased to 80% from
70% (Fig. 3).
Perenco, therefore, needed a strategy
to monitor the wells in real time and
decrease the rapid oil production decline, which was assumed to be caused
by numerous electric submersible
pump (ESP) failures, bs&w increases,
difficulty in managing the reservoir
due to tight emulsions, impossibility
of monitoring well performance with
a test separator, problems with test
repeatability, and large flow fluctuations
in some wells.
The company first tried conventional
periodic testing of the wells, but this
showed large variations between real
production and well tests of up to 25%
(Fig. 4).
The centrifuge-measured bs&w from
the separator was much less than the
actual value. A mass balance indicated
that the bs&w should be about 83%
instead of the 75% obtained with the
centrifuge. Bs&w measurements were
also not repeatable, with some various
between two measurements greater
than 25%.
Because of the inconsistent data,
Perenco could not fine tune production parameters for each well. It was
impossible to select the best size of
ESP for each well. This led to oversizing the pumps and higher electrical
consumption. Overall it was impossible
to optimize consistently the production
on a well-to-well basis. Perenco had to
find an innovative solution for this high
viscosity, high-emulsion production.
Three possible solutions could

variation from the different producers would remain. And this option
would require a desmulsifier to break
the emulsion and work to get the best
retention time.
2. Install a static mixer on the
separator liquid line with an automatic
sampler. This will increase the emulsion,
but production fluctuating (bs&w)
would remain a main concern. Moreover, this would increase moving parts,

leading to problems with accuracy and
maintenance. And this option would
not obtain the high accuracy needed on
long-term tests.
3. Install a multiphase flowmeter
capable of handling heavy and viscous
oil. This option eliminated the need
for flow stabilization and separation.
The meter eliminates phase dispersion, which means that flow would
remain in a continuous oil or water
phase and allow accurate measurements of water/liquid ratios (WLRs)
or bs&w. The meter also provides for
proper real-time monitoring.

Schlumberger’s Vx meter measures
the total mass or total volumetric flow
rates and then the oil, water, and gas
flow rates of a producing well at line
conditions (Fig. 5). Pressure-volumetemperature (PVT) software then
converts these line-condition measurements to standard conditions.
The meter has four simple sensors:
1. A sensor measures the differential
pressure between the inlet and throat of
the Venturi. This measurement provides
the total mass flow rate, Q, and the total
volumetric flow rate, q.
2. A nuclear dual energy fraction
meter measures the count rate of
gamma ray transmitted from source to
detector at two different photon energies. The nuclear gamma-ray fraction
meter obtains the fraction of each constituent in the flow based on knowledge of each phase’s constituents
(density and mass attenuation). This
allows calculation of mixture density
(the density of the three phases flowing in the main pipe).
3. The process-fluid pressure sensor measures the line pressure at the
Venturi throat.
4. The process-fluid temperature
sensor measures the fluid temperature
upstream of the Venturi section, including an ambient temperature TAMB, for
increased safety.
The Vx technology is based on the

As of February 2007, PKKR had

• Obtain current reservoir pressure
from each well, from pressure build
up if available, and from fluid dynamic
level, from nodal analysis on flowing
well, or with direct measurement.
• Estimate current prefrac PI from
liquid rate, reservoir pressure, and bottomhole flowing pressure (BHFP).
• Calculate the postfrac PI. The
prefrac PI can be influenced by well
damage, but this is not accounted for in
hydraulic-fracture candidate selection. If
the well is damaged, the actual incremental increase will be higher than
estimated, with the frac treatment more
economically attractive.

Hydraulic-fracture candidate selection should include only wells that have
not been fractured and wells with less
than 35% water cut. Other considerations include:
• Completion history.
• Workover history.
• Water-oil contact (WOC), gas/oil
ratio (GOR), and bubble point (Pb). If
GOR is high and Pb is lower, the well
could produce primarily gas and create
gas coning.
• Well location (close to WOC, gasoil contact, end of reservoir, etc.).
• Pressure maintenance.
• Wellbore deviation and azimuth.
• Fracture plane.
• Injector-well locations.
• Oil viscosity. High oil viscosity
may cause more drawdown and sand
production after frac.
• Location of faults, natural fissures,
or fractures, etc.
Note that if a well is completed in
multiple zones or has poor cement
bonding across a zone suspected of
being water-productive, a workover,
including zonal isolation or repair, can
possibly allow for an efficient frac in an
oil-bearing formation.
Next, calculate the increment increase of oil keeping the water cut value
identical to the pre-frac value. (Water
cut will normally be higher during

Finally, sort the wells in order of
decreasing tons of incremental oil
calculated.

Evaluating logs, maps
Use logs and field maps to evaluate
the following information:
Log review of mechanical well condition:
• Verify operator knowledge of
hardware weaknesses that could affect
pressure application, such as wellhead
limitations, casing leaks, casing weak-

ness, and improperly functioning
packers.
• Verify location of perforated intervals and distance between intervals.
• Determine presence of water zones
or flooded zones near the targeted frac
interval.
• Determine condition of cement to
sustain fracture operations.
Review offset wells with field map:
• Study condition of water-front
advancement from nearby wells.
• Determine whether pressure support is available from injectors in the
area.

Frac design considerations
PKKR completes most wells with
146-mm production casing and uses
wellhead isolation tools to protect the
wellhead on the surface. Combining retrievable packers and sand plugs enables
multiple-zone fracturing, working from
the bottom zone upward.
The primary frac fluid used is 30 to
35-lb borate-crosslinked guar/1,000
gal (Mgal) water. If the pay zone is
of low porosity or is near a wet sand,
however, a 25-lb/Mgal, borate-crosslinked guar fluid is used.
PKKR used an intermediate-strength
ceramic, 16/30-mesh proppant, and

Note that at this point, there should be
no pumping into the formation, nor
swabbing from the formation.
2. Remove the wellhead isolation
tool and immediately pull the packer,
run tubing in, and begin removal of
proppant from the wellbore. Frac fluid
may not have completely broken by this
time; however, that can be an advantage
because less fluid will be lost to the
formation during circulation.
3. To help ensure there is no proppant in suspension in tubing above the
shoe, inject into the annulus at least
11/2 tubing volumes of diluted frac
fluid, after the packer is released, to
circulate proppant that may still be in
suspension.
4. Use leftover 25-30 lb/Mgal base
gel and 10-lb/Mgal linear gel to wash
proppant out of the wellbore instead
of simply disposing the gel. Dilute the
base gel with water to about 10 lb/
Mgal; this will leave the KCl concentration of 3-4% for the total diluted gel.
Using diluted gel instead of 2%
KCl water as a washout fluid has these
advantages:
• Better proppant-carrying capability.
• Limited amount of fluid lost to the
formation.
• Lower pumping friction and more
efficient proppant cleanout.
• The high percentage (7%) of KCl
in the base gel raises the washout fluid
KCl concentration to 3-4%.
5. Add 1 l. surfactant for every 1 cu
m of all fluids used to kill wells and to
all fracturing fluids to aid in recovery of
fluids lost and help prevent formation
of emulsions from mixing of formation
oil with completion fluids.

Learnings
PKKR believes that the keys to its
successful fracture-stimulation program
are well evaluation, candidate selection, and the postfracture completion
practices outlined above. The first order
of business was to determine the field
potential to yield an adequate ROI. Determining the current PI and estimating

the postfrac PI were critical steps.
In its 2006 fracture stimulation campaign, PKKR did not include any wells
that had been fractured before or wells
that had water cut higher than 35%. ✦

ministration.1 A concentration of only
0.0000001 mole fraction of pentane
in water will provide about 7,000 ppm
(vol) of pentane in air at the air-water
interface, which greatly exceeds the 600
ppm (vol) TLV.
To ensure safe operations, a lower
explosion limit (LEL) for pentane in
air is reportedly 1.4%.2 A concentration of only 0.000001 mole fraction of
pentane in water provides about 7% of
pentane in air at the air-water interface.
To illustrate environmental effects,
consider a spill of pentane in contact
with water. The water will become
saturated; at saturation, the solubility of
pentane in water is about 0.0000385
weight fraction, or 0.00000916 mole
fraction, according to Yalkowski.3
This concentration at saturation leads
to a pentane level of 64.4% in air at the
air-water interface, which is considerably higher than the TLV and LEL.

In an earlier work by Yaws and
coworkers, water solubility for various chemical types was correlation as a
function of the boiling point temperature of the compound.2
For the new correlation, we determined that the boiling point method
was also applicable for correlating water
solubility of crude oil hydrocarbons.
Equation 1 (see accompanying equation
box) shows the new correlation.
The range of boiling point temperatures for the hydrocarbons studied was
298-560 K.
Table 1 shows the regression coefficients for a wide variety of hydrocarbons: alkanes, olefins, diolefins, acetylenes, cyclopentanes, cyclohexanes,
benzenes, mercaptans, thiophenes, and
sulfides. The table also shows the boiling point range (minimum, maximum)
for which the correlation is applicable.
The correlation should not be used for
compounds with boiling points outside
the boiling point range.
We determined the coefficients using
regressions of available data. In preparing the correlation, we conducted a
literature search to identify data source

Costs for six selected equipment items
used in refining construction operations have been surveyed for the 3 years,
2004-06. The accompanying table shows
Nelson-Farrar equipment indexes for
these items of equipment.
Bubble trays showed the greatest
increases in cost, rising from 1,227.8 in
first-quarter 2004 fourth-quarter 2006.
Four other items showed more modest increases. The tanks and pressure

I TEMIZED REFINING COST INDEXES
The cost indexes may be used to convert prices at any date to prices at other dates by ratios to the cost indexes of the same
date. Item indexes are published each quarter (first week issue of January, April, July, and October). In addition the Nelson
Construction and Operating Cost Indexes are published in the first issue of each month of Oil and Gas Journal.

The Feb. 14, 2007,
opening of the first leg of
Kinder Morgan’s Rockies
Express (REX) pipeline
between Wamsutter, Wyo.
Pipelines
and the Cheyenne Hub
in northeastern Colorado, will narrow the Opal-to-Cheyenne
pricing differential even while increased
gas-on-gas competition in the region
forces regional price
differentials lower
until completion
of REX Phase III in
2009.
Kinder Morgan
began flowing natural gas through the
192-mile section of the Rockies Express
pipeline (REX) between Wamsutter and
Cheyenne hub on Feb. 14. Completion of this first leg of REX along with
several smaller projects extending
the western end of the system from
Wamsutter to Opal lets producers flow
an additional 500 MMcfd from major
Rockies basins to Cheyenne.
Since then, about 300 MMcfd of REX
receipts from the Uinta-Piceance flowed
directly to Cheyenne. At the same time,
REX deliveries at Wamsutter dropped to
zero. This shift in flows opened capacity on the Wyoming Interstate pipeline
(WIC) through Wamsutter, letting WIC
increase the flow of Green River (Opal)
gas to Cheyenne.
The additional flow of gas into
Cheyenne has started to narrow the
Opal-to-Cheyenne differential. On Feb.
14 and 15 the differential remained

demand along the front range of Colorado. By Mar.15, the differential had
dropped to less than $0.01 MMbtu.
This article examines the reasons
behind this compression in differentials
and discusses how completion of REX’s
Wamsutter-to-Cheyenne leg is likely to
affect the market.

Geography
REX Phase I’s initial segment went
into service in February 2006 with
completion of the length formerly
called Entrega, a 136-mile leg connecting Uinta-Piceance production with
WIC and Colorado Interstate Gas (CIG)
pipeline at Wamsutter (Fig. 1).
The segment completed in February
extends REX east to Cheyenne and west
to Questar Corp.’s Overthrust pipeline
at Kanda.
Through a long-term lease with
Overthrust Pipeline, REX Phase I also
can move up to 1.5 bcfd from the
Green River-Overthrust area (around
Opal) to Kanda and on to Cheyenne
Hub.
REX Phase I is the first phase of a
project that will become the largest
natural gas pipeline built in the US in
the last 20 years. REX West (Phase II)
will begin operations in early 2008 and
extend the system to Mexico, Mo. Addition of compression will also increase
capacity at Cheyenne to 1.6 bcfd. REX
East (Phase III), planned for completion
in 2009, will extend the pipeline to
Clarington, Ohio, and increase overall

a range averaging about $1.00
below Henry.
But in the summer of
2006, the specter of transportation curtailments started
to rear its head. Unrelenting
increases in production had
again tightened capacity out
of the region. By November
2006, Opal was running
$2.50/MMbtu under Henry,
spiking to $5.00/MMbtu
below Henry Nov. 14 due to
mechanical problems at Opal.
It is this kind of pricing
pressure that REX will ultimately relieve.

Opal vs. Cheyenne
REX will also equalize pricing pressures within the Rockies region, reducing, if not eliminating, the differential
that exists between Opal and Cheyenne.
Opal typically trades below Cheyenne Hub. During 2005, Cheyenne
exceeded Opal by an average of $0.16/
MMbtu, increasing to $0.39/MMbtu
in 2006 (Fig. 3). The differential has
continued to grow in recent months,
averaging $0.81/MMbtu since Sept. 1,
2006.
Cheyenne Hub connects to multiple
Midwestern markets as well as markets along the front range of Colorado.
Particularly with the completion of
Cheyenne Plains in 2005, gas from
Cheyenne has significantly improved
access to Midwest and Eastern markets,
which provide the highest value market for Rockies gas most of the time.
Demand at Cheyenne Hub is typically
strong, drawing supply from Rockies
producing basins.
REX Phase I gives producers the opportunity to move more gas to the Cheyenne Hub, thereby increasing supply
relative to demand and narrowing the
differential between Opal and Cheyenne.

Basis effect
After three weeks of operation, the
anticipated compression of Opal and
Cheyenne differentials became evident.
Fig. 6 compares the average price at
Cheyenne Hub and Opal from Feb. 13
to Mar. 7. Just after the pipeline went
into service, Cheyenne prices remained
high relative to Opal, but by Feb. 16 the
premium had begun to shrink. During
the next two weeks, the differential narrowed to less than $0.10/MMbtu.
The premium for the first few days
portends an inter-Rockies pricing trend
that will likely persist: local Rockies demand will swing the Opal to Cheyenne
differential.
The price at Cheyenne
Fig. 6
will likely stay strong relative
to Opal in spite of REX when
it is cold along the front
range of Colorado.
This is not just a winter
phenomenon. During the
summer, hot weather will
also increase front-range
demand, likely with the same
result.
When Colorado needs gas,
the extra demand still drives
the price upward at Chey-

enne. Conversely, when weather reaches
extremes along the Wasatch Front, the
differential may reverse.
The longer term implications of REX
are less clear than its short-term effects.
The changes in pipeline flow patterns
since REX brought the Wamsutter-toCheyenne section online make clear at
least two immediate benefits will accrue: improved ability to flow gas from
southwest Wyoming to Cheyenne and
a narrowing of the basis differentials
between Opal and Cheyenne.
Whether REX drives a reduction in
the spread between Rockies production and production in other regions of
the country will depend on takeaway
capacity east of Cheyenne, northwest
and west of Opal, south of Greasewood,
and local demand. In this regard, Rockies producers may be their own worst
enemy.
Bentek estimates that between 2001
and 2006, the Rockies region generated 441 MMcfd/year of incremental
production. During the last 6 months of
2006, incremental growth in the region
exceeded 656 MMcfd. Bentek also
estimates that all of the export options
combined will create only 150-250
MMcfd of unused takeaway capacity.
Weather along the Wasatch front and
front range that is either hotter than
last summer or colder than this winter
might absorb another 100-150 MMcfd.
Bentek believes that by summer
2007 the disparity between production
growth and unused takeaway capacity
will cause gas-on-gas competition to
intensify at Opal and Cheyenne, forcing
cash prices lower. Once this situation
develops, it is likely to persist until REX
reaches Clarington in 2009. ✦

Pipe basket transports drillstem components safely
Here’s an advanced level pipe basket
that promises safe and secure transporta-

tion of drillstem components.
The pipe safety basket features integral
ratchet straps, helping to ensure a safe and
secure load. The elevated and enclosed
bottom frame of the
safety basket also
complies with newer
dockside mandates
for Dropped Object
Regulations.
The basket is
proof full-load tested
to 55,000 lb—or 2.5
times the maximum weight limit
of 22,000 lb. The
rigging components
of the basket are
rated to 1.5 times
the maximum load
weight. And the

baskets are postload tested with full magparticle inspection of all lifting points.
Units are designed for single-line lifts
on offshore locations.
Because the safety baskets can be
stacked two high, their dimensions and
maximum weight limits allow for the
transportation of two baskets on a standard
18-wheeler float, the company points out.
The basket also includes a protective
enclosure—helping reduce damages that
often occur during shipping. Reinforced
end area enclosures shield connections and
offer protection from load shifts during
handling and shipping.
The safety basket also allows for crane
or forklift accessibility for loading and
unloading.

From the Subscribers Only area of

Busy with gotcha
games, Congress
ignores energy
The best hope for US energy policy
these days is embodied in Alberto Gonzales, Valerie Plame, and Al Gore.
Gonzales is the US attorney general,
whom congressional Democrats are trying
to run out of ofﬁce.
The Democrats want to know why eight
federal prosecutors got ﬁred. When asked
about it, Gonzales couldn’t manage to say
simply that President Bush wanted them to

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

be ﬁred, which is reason enough.
So lawmakers have started an inquisition. No crime has appeared yet. Democrats
hope to cross up an administration ofﬁcial
under oath and score a perjury or obstruction indictment.
Plame is the Central Intelligence Agency
something or other whose cover was blown
when columnist Robert Novak reported
her connection with administration critic
Joseph Wilson. The connection: She’s his
wife and had a hand in his assignment by
the CIA to investigate suspected efforts by
Iraq to buy uranium from Niger.
Wilson sniffed no Iraqi scent in Niger
and wrote articles alleging that Bush
juiced intelligence to justify war with Iraq.
Attention-grabbing from a CIA-sponsored
platform isn’t behavior normally associated
with a husband concerned about keeping
his wife’s employment at the agency secret,
of course. But when an appropriately curious Novak reported what he learned about
it (from the State Department), Washington’s scandal machine presumed that the
White House outed Plame to punish Wilson.
On Mar. 16, Plame told receptive Democrats in a House committee hearing—only
two Republicans showed up—that, sure
enough, the Bush folks revealed her secrets
“from purely political motives.” Nobody
asked where she got the information.
On Mar. 21, former Vice-President Al
Gore preached his global-warming sermon
before a rapt joint House-Senate committee, likening the planet to a baby with a
fever—and on and on.
It’s all political theater.
“Ten weeks into the new Congress,”
wrote columnist David Broder recently, “it
is clear that revelation, not legislation is
going to be its real product.”
Good. While busy with gotcha games,
Democrats aren’t threatening national interests with loopy energy bills like the one
that the House passed Jan. 18 and that the
Senate, so far, has ignored.

Middle East tension hikes oil prices
Escalation of political tensions Mar. 23-25 appeared to threaten Middle East supplies and set the stage for another likely spike in crude prices.
Crude futures prices peaked at $62.65/bbl in intraday trading Mar. 23 in the New
York market and settled at $62.28/bbl, up 59¢ for the day, after naval units of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard seized eight UK sailors and seven Royal Marines who had boarded a
merchant ship for inspection in Iraqi waters of the Persian Gulf.
Meanwhile, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Salam Zaubai underwent surgery Mar. 23
at a US military hospital after being injured in a double bombing in Baghdad in which
nine people were killed. Iraqi police said a suicide bomber blew himself up and a car
bomb exploded as Zaubai was leaving a mosque near his home in the Iraqi capital.
The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously over the weekend to
tighten sanctions on Iran after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad cancelled his
planned appearance to defend his country’s uranium enrichment program. The latest
resolution embargoed all sales by Iran of conventional weapons and froze the foreign
assets of 28 Iranian individuals, institutions, and companies, including Bank Sepah. It
called for restriction of new ﬁnancial grants, credits, and loans to Iran. A Dec. 23 resolution banned trade with Iran in sensitive nuclear materials and ballistic missiles.
Iranian ofﬁcials said the UN’s move will limit their cooperation with the Atomic
Energy Agency, the UN’s nuclear watchdog. Iran has 60 days to halt its uranium enrichment program or face new sanctions.
Analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates reported crude
futures prices near a 3-month high in early trading Mar. 26. “Geopolitical concerns and
supply disruption possibilities are on the forefront of traders’ minds,” they said. With
the proposed build-up of US military forces in the region, analysts said, “The tension
is expected to increase in the foreseeable future. Roughly a quarter of the world’s
oil supply ﬂows through the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway between Iran and
Oman. Therefore, any transportation disruptions through that waterway would have a
large impact on the world’s crude oil supply.”
UK demands release
In the interim, UK ofﬁcials demanded the immediate safe return of military personnel seized as they concluded an inspection for possibly smuggled goods aboard a
merchant ship just outside the Shatt al-Arab waterway dividing Iraq and Iran. Jurisdiction in that area has long been contested between the two countries. Iranian ofﬁcials
said they may charge the sailors and marines with violating its waters.
According to UK and US reports, ships of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard naval
corps—which operates separately from Iran’s navy—darted out of Iranian waters into
Iraqi waters to capture the sailors and marines. There was speculation that the seizure
might be in retaliation for US detention of ﬁve Revolutionary Guard operatives following a January raid on the Iranian consulate in Irbil, Iraq, as part of the effort to counter
Iran’s growing inﬂuence in Iraq.
European imports
Meanwhile, imports of Saudi Arabian crude by European members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development steadily declined during 2006. Therefore, by keeping its OECD crude exports steady, Libya has taken over Saudi Arabia’s
former spot as the second largest supplier of crude to Europe OECD, behind Russia.
Iraq, Venezuela, and Iran have helped replace former Saudi supplies to those European
customers. “Imports from Algeria have dropped and [were] replaced with increases
from Azerbaijan,” said Olivier Jakob, managing director of Petromatrix GMBH, Zug,
Switzerland, in a Mar. 22 report.
Overall, OECD imports of OPEC crude were essentially unchanged in 2006 from
2005, with the largest difference coming from a drop of Saudi imports (mostly to
Europe). “Algeria has decreased ﬂows to Europe to rebalance instead towards North
America and the Asia-Paciﬁc. Venezuela on the other hand is reducing its exports to
the US and increasing to Europe, while Iran is reducing exports to Asia-Paciﬁc and
increasing to Europe,” Jakob said.
European imports of gas oil—middle and light distillates—from North America have
steadily increased. “While the US is by far the largest importer of European gasoline, European exports to Mexico have seen the largest increase, offsetting slightly lower exports
to the US and Nigeria, while exports to Iraq have mostly phased out. Exports to Iran are
stable [for] the year but mostly due to shipments in the ﬁrst half of 2006 while they come
down to a trickle in the ofﬁcial statistics for the fourth quarter 2006,” Jakob said.

With LNG Observer’s focus on Europe in this issue, its main section (beginning on p. 3) has
been expanded to four articles. Each addresses different topics relevant to European LNG
development. Spain’s terminal at Cartagena (cover) represents the rapid expansion under way
in Europe’s LNG import system. Operator Enagas added a 127,000-cu m storage tank there
in October 2005 and has current plans to increase sendout capacity to 10.5 billion cu m/year
from 7.9-billion cu m/year. Photo from Enagas.

T

his issue of LNG Observer recognizes the ascending role
of Europe as the world’s LNG industry grows and matures.
The central section—Issues, Trends, Technologies that
begins on p. 3—has expanded to four, rather than the usual
three articles.
Each focuses on an area of critical importance for development of Europe’s LNG business:
• Its place and function in the growing Atlantic Basin
trade.
• The evolution and complexity of Europe’s LNG and
natural gas regulatory schemes.
• The importance of terminal-use agreements.
• The thorny issues of natural gas quality and regional
interchangeability.
These and more concerns fill the agenda for the 15th
International Conference and Exhibition on Liquefied Natural
Gas (“LNG15”), in late April in Barcelona.
The location is important.
In 2004, for LNG14, industry gathered in Doha, Qatar.
That location signified the country’s path toward becoming the
world’s largest producer of LNG, a status it will likely attain
before LNG16 in 2010.
For LNG15, a site in Spain, Europe’s most prolific LNG
importer, and in Europe, a region whose appetite for natural gas
draws large pipeline supplies from Russia and Africa, is appropriate as Europe vies with the US to supplant Asia as the world’s
largest LNG market.

Turning point

And, like Europe, the world’s LNG industry gathers at a
critical point in its history.
In 2006, more than 20 million tonnes/year of production
capacity came on line. 2007 will likely see more than 22 million
tpy of production capacity start up. In these 2 years, capacity
will have advanced by nearly 30% over what was available in
2005.
Such growth seems striking, until we realize that in 2008
alone, if plans advance on schedule, more capacity will come on
line than in both 2006 and 2007.
These numbers alone, however, don’t tell the story of
industry’s evolution. A study released earlier this year by the

consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers notes the changing
nature of the industry, saying the world’s LNG market has
become “characterized by both complexity and globalization,
in which the disaggregation of dedicated LNG chains opens up
new potential opportunities.”
Gone or at least fading is the dominance of LNG trade by
single, large Asian suppliers (Indonesia and Malaysia) feeding
large Asian markets (Japan and Korea) under long-term contracts.
The report notes that in recent years, a “host of new supply
and destination countries [has] emerged, bringing greater volume and dynamism to the LNG market.” Of most significance,
it says, is the establishment of LNG production in the Middle
East, principally among Qatar, Oman, and Egypt. Joining Abu
Dhabi, these production centers can serve markets East and
West, adding a level of volatility and flexibility unknown in the
formative years of industry’s growth, 1960s to 1990s.
In the East, as Indonesia struggles to remain an important
LNG supplier, new supplies from Australia and Russia are poised
to add greater choice and complexity to that area, even as new
demand grows in China and India, while Japanese demand flattens.
And as Asia’s market landscapes rumble with changing
dynamics, Europe and the US stare at each other over the
Atlantic Ocean in intense competition for Middle East new
supplies as well as volumes from such newly developing Atlantic
Basin producers, as Nigeria, Angola, and Equatorial Guinea.
Such evolution of markets and suppliers has sparked
intense debate of whether an LNG spot market is developing.
PricewaterhouseCoopers is in no doubt: “A short-term ‘spot’
LNG trading market has developed, accounting for around
11.4% of LNG sales in 2004 if swaps and diversions are included...,” adding “the rise of short-term trading in LNG has been
dramatic”
The consensus at a session on LNG spot trading at
CERAWeek 2007 earlier this year was that spot trading, however defined, would settle at nearly 20% of global LNG trade
and that traditional long-term contracts would steadily become
less long-term.

It’s a curse, remember

These are, no doubt, interesting times. But perhaps we
should pause to remember: That saying is a curse, not a blessing.
Living in these interesting times, especially if you are trying
to survive and grow commercially, often seems more curse than
blessing. But would we have it any other way?
Being only a disinterested watcher and listener as one of
the world’s great enterprises wrestles with its future ... now that’s
a privilege. LNG

T

he near-term future of the Atlantic
Basin LNG market is exciting,
with many new import terminals
and several new suppliers set to begin
operations.
With Middle East suppliers about to
take a prominent role in providing swing
supplies to the Atlantic, the definition

of the Atlantic Basin LNG market is
itself changing. Although the Atlantic
and Pacific LNG markets are beginning
to blend, significant differences between
them continue to exist, however, especially with regard to pricing and contractual
terms. Whether these differences will fade
in the coming years remains to be seen.
This article will review the origin
and current state of the Atlantic Basin
LNG market and name some of the
drivers shaping this market near-term. It
will define the contours of the Atlantic
Basin LNG market and highlight key
participants, as well as some likely future
players. It will examine how this market

has risen to prominence in the worldwide
LNG industry in a relatively short time.
The discussion will then analyze
characteristics of the Atlantic Basin LNG
market and how it can be differentiated
from the older, more traditional Pacific
Basin LNG market. It will examine how
geopolitics and other factors are affecting
the Atlantic Basin LNG market’s continued development and the roles of major
Middle East LNG suppliers in serving as
swing provider of LNG supply security.
Finally will be a view of how competition between these two primary LNG
markets will shape the near-term of the
Atlantic Basin LNG market.

and tributaries that empty into any of
these bodies of water.
With this rather broad expanse as a
reference point, the Atlantic Basin LNG
market can be seen as that segment of
the world LNG market capable of commercially producing or consuming LNG
in or adjacent to the Atlantic Basin.
Others have simply defined this
market as all LNG producers and
consumers physically located west of the
Suez Canal, although this definition
excludes the three primary Middle East
LNG producers who have been serving
and will no doubt continue to serve
Atlantic Basin LNG markets.
Under our preferred definition,
Atlantic Basin LNG markets specifically
include current LNG producing countries Abu Dhabi, Algeria, Egypt, Libya,
Nigeria, Oman, Qatar, and Trinidad &
Tobago, and LNG consuming countries
Belgium, Dominican Republic, France,
Greece, Italy, Mexico, Portugal, Spain,
Turkey, the UK, and the US (including
Puerto Rico), as well as future LNG
producers Angola, Equatorial Guinea,
Norway, Russia, Venezuela, and Yemen,
and possible future LNG consumers
Brazil, Canadian East Coast, Germany
and the Netherlands.
The Bahamas and Jamaica have
also announced plans to join Atlantic
Basin LNG market consumers, although
both have to date encountered significant
political obstacles that have delayed
progress.
By way of contrast, the Pacific Basin
LNG market consists of present LNG
producers Abu Dhabi, Australia, Brunei,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Oman, Qatar, and
the US (Alaska), producing projects
under construction in Peru, Russia
(Sakhalin), and Yemen, and current LNG
consumers China (including Taiwan),
India, Japan, and South Korea, together
with future Pacific Basin LNG producers Iran and Papua New Guinea, and
future LNG importers Canadian West
Coast, Mexico’s West Coast, Indonesia,
Pakistan, Singapore, Thailand, and the
US West Coast.

LNG imports slowly began to
recover, and by the end of 1999 and into
2000, it began to become clear to many
US gas market observers that the growing
supply-demand imbalance resulting from
flattening domestic gas production and
rising gas demand (propelled mainly by
new power-generation capacity) would
cause long-term US gas market pricing to
remain at or above $3/MMbtu. At the
time, this was widely viewed as the minimum price that would provide sufficient

Four new LNG terminals are currently under construction in Louisiana
(Sabine Pass, Cameron, and Golden Pass)
and Texas (Freeport LNG) that, when
completed in 2008-09, will significantly
increase import terminal capacity of the
US in the Atlantic Basin. Several other
US terminal projects have received necessary governmental approvals and may,
depending on market conditions, commence construction in the near future.

that is due to such an important part of
the Atlantic Basin LNG market.
Europe at present has more LNG
import capacity than the US, with at least
15 operational LNG import terminals
spread across 8 different countries. Astute
European gas-market observers have been
planning for significant additional LNG
import capacity for the past several years
as they have watched UK and Dutch
domestic natural gas production beginning to flatten in the face of consistently
increasing demand. To be fair, however,
it is important to note that Norwegian

hydroelectric power generation and led to
diverted LNG cargoes as gas-fired power
generation stepped in to fill the gap.
Today, the map of existing and
planned LNG import terminal capacity
in Europe (Fig. 2) closely resembles the
multi-colored pin cushion that has come
to characterize the ever-expanding US
LNG import terminal development map
maintained and published by the US
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
Thus far, Europe does not appear
to have suffered from the on-again,
off-again starts and stops of the early US
LNG import market, and the practice
of mothballing LNG import terminals
for extended periods of time seems to be
largely a US phenomenon.

and the Pacific Basin LNG market relates
to market pricing.
While the Pacific Basin LNG market
is largely priced against a few key Pacific
market crude oil indexes (the Japanese
Crude Cocktail, or “JCC,” and the
Indonesian Crude Price, or “ICP”) that
maintain a significant degree of parity,
the Atlantic Basin LNG market enjoys
a host of different and divergent points
of import and market pricing indexes,
with the Henry Hub (La.) index used in
most US and Caribbean Basin (including Mexico) LNG and natural gas sales
contracts, the National Balancing Point
(NBP) index being frequently used in
the UK, and Brent oil-based and other
regional gas-pricing indexes, such as
Zeebrugge, carrying the day in still other
areas.
There has been little correlation
between the Henry Hub and European
gas pricing indexes in the past few years

(although the gap generally appears to be
closing), which has at many times led to a
transatlantic price competition in which
LNG volumes, particularly spot or swing
volumes, find their way to their ultimate
markets based solely upon comparative
seasonal price fluctuations between the
US and Europe.
While the US has not seen the
anticipated tremendous increase in
LNG import activity in the past year or
so due to European pricing that has at
most times been significantly higher than
US market prices, it remains to be seen
whether this higher European pricing will
hold up over the longer term. Of course,
none of the world’s LNG producers is yet
ready to forget the recent season of $14/
MMbtu natural gas in the US. Although
with a little more discipline and foresight
in planning gas-storage volumes, many
in the US believe this may have been a
one-time aberration.

Pacific Basin LNG buyers have also
traditionally been very comfortable with
long-term, high-volume take-or-pay LNG
supply contracts. By contrast, significant
gas buyers in the Atlantic Basin LNG
market (and in certain places in the
developing Pacific Basin LNG market)
are often regulated US utilities, such as
power producers or local gas distribution companies, that either by habit or
regulation are often loathe to sign up for
large commodity volumes on a long-term
basis, particularly on the type of take-orpay terms that predominate in the LNG
industry.
In addition, many of these US
consumers maintain gas supply and
transportation arrangements for which
disruptions due to occurrence of a forcemajeure event are somewhat unlikely and
even when they do occur are frequently
remedied (either contractually or practi-

cally) within a short time due to widespread availability of substitute supplies.
As such, many Atlantic Basin LNG
market consumers are very unfamiliar
with, and uncomfortable taking on, the
types of long-term force-majeure risks
that are assumed as a matter of course
by many of the large, traditional Pacific
Basin LNG market consumers that simply
have no other source of gas supply.
Finally, from a total LNG import
capacity standpoint, the Pacific Basin
LNG market enjoyed a significant
advantage for quite some time, but
new and recommissioned LNG import
terminal capacity in North America and
Europe appears to have closed this gap
significantly. Many of these new facilities
are multi-user terminals, with detailed
terminal-use agreements providing the
terms of LNG terminaling services being
executed by at least six terminals in the
last 3 years.
The Pacific Basin LNG market has
yet to see terminal-use agreements used
by traditional LNG buyers (that generally
own and are sole users of their import
terminals), the primary exception being
Sempra’s Energía Costa Azul terminal in
Mexico, which has executed TUAs with
Shell and Sempra affiliates.
An accompanying box shows an
example of Atlantic Basin terminal-use
agreements.
Lastly, there may also be key differences between the sizes of ships serving
these two LNG markets in the near-term,
as there are several LNG import terminals
planned and under construction in the
US and Europe which, when operational,
will be able to receive new-generation
200,000+ cu m LNG tankers designated
for service out of Qatar. To date it does
not appear that many importers in the
Pacific Basin LNG market are planning
for ship sizes in excess of 165,000 cu m,
and many of the traditional Pacific Basin
LNG market customers may never be
able to accommodate the 200,000+ cu
m vessels due to significant harbor and
terminal draft issues.

Emerging market dynamics
At present, the UK, France, Spain,
and Italy are projected to be the primary LNG consumption drivers in the
European market, with numerous LNG
import terminals in service and planned
in each country. (In fact, Italy will soon
open the world’s first offshore gravitybased terminal, in the Adriatic Sea). The
US East Coast is still projected to be a significant source of overall demand growth
in the US, although due to political
obstacles much of this growth is likely to
be served by LNG import infrastructure
on the US Gulf Coast.
Perhaps the most interesting dynamic
emerging in today’s worldwide LNG
trade, however, relates to developments
(or lack thereof) in supply, in both the
Atlantic and Pacific basins. LNG demand
now far outstrips LNG supply in both
markets, and prospects are not bright for
a near-term balance between the two.
Geopolitical issues, in particular,
continue to hinder LNG production
growth. For example, many of the countries with the world’s largest gas reserves
(Table 1), which generally are not close to
the Atlantic Basin LNG market, have no
or limited plans for constructing new or
additional LNG production facilities.
Moreover, with LNG production
shortfalls predicted from Indonesia and
delays affecting key proposed Australian
projects, several Pacific Basin customers
that are concerned about long-term supply
security appear to be looking to Middle
Eastern producers, such as Qatar, for
longer-term large-volume supply security.
Very recently at least one long-term
Middle Eastern supply volume that
appeared to be originally destined for
delivery into the Atlantic Basin LNG market was contracted long term to a Pacific
Basin LNG market customer.
This makes good commercial sense
as well when LNG pricing in the Pacific
Basin LNG market is attractive relative
to the US or European markets as it is
today. To the extent that this diversion
trend continues, and we see Middle
Eastern LNG producers stepping in to

become the supply-security providers to
the traditional Pacific Basin LNG market
players, LNG volumes will be increasingly
diverted away from the Atlantic Basin
LNG market. LNG

Gas-market access key element in

A

recent survey on access to LNG
terminals, ordered by the Council
of European Energy Regulators,1
concluded that “the state of development
of liberalization and competition in the
market downstream of the terminal is in
many instances more the determinant of
access than the terminal itself.”2
This conclusion explains why this
article on European regulation covers
not only regulations applicable to LNG,
but also the main principles governing
access to transmission networks.
An overview of the European grid
appears in “Gas Infrastructure Europe.”3
Given the high and growing import
dependency of the European Union
(EU), there is currently no European liquefaction plant for exporting LNG. LNG
terminals perform three main activities: berthing, and unloading, storing,
and regasifying, and occasionally such
services as blending and truck loading.
Liberalization consists mainly of
breaking into four segments the supply
chain that was vertically integrated in
incumbents’ groups:
• Production and other upstream
activities; unfortunately most European
countries have no natural gas production.
• High-pressure networks for
domestic transmission and transit, storage, and LNG.
• Distribution through local
medium to low-pressure grids, which can
represent 30% of the consumer’s bill.
• Gas trade, covering importation,
activities around gas exchanges, wholesale, retail.

In most cases, construction of

economically viable: Domestic transmission and distribution are considered
natural monopolies. The corresponding
network operators are appointed as legal
monopolists in most countries. Access

activities and the gas trade are obviously
left to competition. The grey zone consists of transit, storage, and LNG, with
big national disparities.

of the electricity directive 2003/54/EC
and the gas directive 2003/55/EC cover
the following topics:14 unbundling, role
of regulators, public service obligations,
distribution, exemptions from certain
provisions of the TPA regime, security
of supply, labeling, and gas storage.15
The EC is preparing additional notes
related to the gas regulation, whose
drafts were submitted for consultation
to the Madrid Forum and that deal with
calculation of available capacity, congestion management, tariff methodology,
and transparency.
To ensure implementation of the
regulatory framework in this respect, the
Second Gas Directive requires creation
of national energy regulators. Their main

roles include approving and controlling
tariffs (or tariff methodologies), ensuring
nondiscriminatory network access and
effective unbundling, and dealing with
complaints.
In 2004, the EU issued a Directive
on Security of Gas Supply, which was
a first difficult step towards a more
common approach of security of supply
among countries that cherish their
national sovereignties over energy.16 This
directive clarifies roles and responsibilities of different instances and categories
of market players.

Considering that TPA has serious
advantages in terms of competition, efficient use of infrastructure, and security
of supply and considering that hoarding
of capacity is a fact, mainly on LNG
terminals, legislation should leave room
for long-term regulation. In some cases
in which an exemption is deemed necessary, it could be limited to an exemption
from tariff regulation (negotiated TPA).
Exempt infrastructure is still subject
to control from the competition authority and from the sector regulator, when
conditions have been imposed. Control
on the conditions can raise interpretation difficulties and subsequent regulatory risk for the system operator.22 Such
risk disappears in the case of rTPA,

Gas market liquidity
Gas hubs can be virtual in character,
allowing trading of gas that has been
physically injected into any point on a
national grid. This is the case for the UK
hub (National Balancing Point; NBP)
and the recent hubs in the Netherlands
(title-transfer facility, TTF) and Italy
(punto de scambio virtuale, PSV). In
these cases, gas is usually traded on an
“entry-paid” basis, meaning that entry
capacity into the networks has been
settled.
Others are “physical,” requiring gas
to be transported to and from a particular trading point or zone. This is true
for Zeebrugge (Belgium), Baumgarten
(Austria), and Emden (Germany), for
instance. CEER strongly promotes the
establishment of liquid gas hubs, allowing hub-to-hub trade all over Europe.38
The most important hub in
Continental Europe is at Zeebrugge.39 In
2005, the Belgian regulator published a
report assessing liquidity on this gas hub
and outlining the measures launched to
improve the liquidity. At present, the difference between the gas-quality specifications in the UK and on the European
continent is maybe the biggest inhibitor
of liquidity. Construction of gas conversion facilities between Zeebrugge and
NBP in UK is the object of urgent
feasibility studies.
During a recent investigation, many
respondents advocated to promote
liquidity through obligatory trading
on hubs and gas release programs (i.e.,
imposed auctions of parts of contracted
volumes bought by the incumbent under
long-term import contracts).40 Other

and national regulatory requirements for
third-party access to the terminal.
Although it is possible to secure an
exemption from third-party access requirements, qualifying conditions and terms
of that exemption vary from country to
country. With exception of the UK, the
emerging general rule is that only a partial
exemption will be granted. For example,
Italy allows only up to 80% of terminal
capacity to be exempt from third-party
access. In all cases, failure fully to utilize
terminal capacity may result in loss or
qualification of the exemption.
Companies exploring the possibility of
securing access at a multiple-user terminal
must be aware that these terminals present
unique issues.

Threshold operational assessment
Simply identifying the perfect site and
terminal design in the optimal market does
not adequately address whether proposed
terminal services will be available to the
capacity user or users when desired. As a
threshold matter before acquiring any terminal capacity, especially at a multiple-user
terminal, a prospective user should assess
early in its evaluation process certain fundamental operational factors to determine
whether the proposed terminal is viable.
Importantly, these operational factors
include not only terminal considerations
but also the associated waterway. For
example, physical (e.g., number of terminal berths and their maximum and
minimum capabilities), navigational (e.g.,
water depth, bridge clearances, and tides)
and regulatory (e.g., LNG carrier transit
windows and environmental—fog and
wind—limitations on vessel transit and
berthing) restrictions should be thoroughly assessed to determine whether they
preclude meaningful marine access to the
terminal for capacity users.

European gas quality, interchangeability

the 25 European Union countries 200030 are predicted to nearly treble.
Many European countries, including the UK, are constructing new LNG
importation terminals (Fig. 2 ) and
increasing gas imports via additional
pipeline interconnectors. These moves
raise the issue of gas interchangeability
because the source and quality of natural
gas across Europe will not be constant.
LNG supplies and Norwegian pipeline imports will generally be of a higher
calorific value than UK Continental Shelf
North Sea gas. Dutch pipeline imports,
however, may possibly provide low calorific value gas supplies.
Of additional concern is that the
large volumes of gas from LNG terminals
and from new pipeline interconnectors
will change the traditional flow and mixing patterns within existing gas networks
so that many more parts of Europe may
see a wider change in gas quality over
short time and possibly at the extremes of
gas specification limits.
The issue is therefore how to ensure
security of gas supply at reasonable cost,

Interchangeability
This discussion employs a definition of gas interchangeability recognized
internationally: The ability to substitute
one gaseous fuel for another in a combustion application without materially
changing the operational performance of
the application (its safety, efficiency, or
emissions).
This would include the need for any
gas-fired equipment or appliance firing
on the substitute gas to continue to meet
the performance standard for which it was
originally approved.
Gas interchangeability is not a new
concept with considerable work completed, particularly in the US and Europe in

his article will look at gas quality from the perspective of downstream interchangeability and concentrate on current issues surrounding
increased dependence of many countries
around the world on imported natural
gas.
The rise in gas trading across international borders through new pipeline
interconnectors and LNG shipping brings
with it concerns for the variability of gas
quality delivered from different sources.
To trade natural gas as a truly international commodity, industry needs to agree
on the definition and measurement of
natural gas.
It may be a surprise that these are
not already in place, given the maturity
of most natural gas industries. Each gas
market, however, has been almost isolated
from other markets until now, with its
own indigenous reserves. The need to
secure gas supplies from many different
sources is quite new.

in which water vapor in combustion is
assumed to be entirely condensed and

(same as net calorific value in which heat

Heating value is not the best parameter to represent interchangeability because
it does not account for flow through a
burner.

the 1960-70s. This work was triggered by
the need for step changes from a manufactured (town) gas to natural gas.
And, as might be expected, different
researchers concluded their work on the
gas appliances of their region and time
with different definitions and measures.
The result has been no consistent, internationally recognized way of interpreting gas
interchangeability. Different countries,
and even different regions within the
same country, use a variety of dissimilar
parameters and limits of acceptable performance to assess the impact of variable
gas quality on gas supply and consumer
operations.
Also, in pursuit of increased equipment efficiency and lower emissions, we
have seen development of a new generation of gas-fired appliances, with premixed and staged combustion, that may

gas quality and may not be appropriately

parameters, found empirically with appliances popular more than 30 years ago.

Different parameters
Many parameters are in use worldwide to represent gas interchangeability.
In many cases, including Europe, more
than one factor may be used to set
maximum and minimum thresholds that
form an envelope of acceptable operation
for downstream plant and equipment. A
selection of the following factors is typically used:
• Heating value or calorific value.
• Wobbe Number or Wobbe Index.
• Relative density or specific gravity.
• Weaver indices.
• AGA indices.
• Incomplete combustion factor.
• Lift index.
• Soot index.
Heating value or calorific value
represents the energy content of a gas usually given in units of MJoules/std. cu m
or btu/scf and can be expressed as higher

Since the volumetric flow of gas in
a pipe is inversely proportional to the
square root of gas density (as is the definition of Wobbe Index), thermal input
through a burner nozzle is proportional
to Wobbe Index and not to heating value.
It can also be shown that Wobbe Index
is proportional to the equivalence ratio
or stoichiometric air requirement for a
burner. And, it therefore gives a good
indication of gas combustion and energy
flow through a burner nozzle.
Relative density or specific gravity, as
a measure of gas density relative to air at
reference conditions, is used for interchangeability specifications to limit the
higher hydrocarbon content of the gas.
An increased higher hydrocarbon content
could lead to such combustion problems
as increased carbon monoxide emissions,
soot formation, engine knock, or spontaneous ignition on gas turbines even at the
same Wobbe Index value.
Incomplete combustion factor, lift
index, and sooting index are parameters developed for the UK appliance
market, as are Weaver and AGA indices
for the US. AGA is currently reviewing and updating AGA Bulletin 36
(Interchangeability of Other Fuel Gases
with Natural Gases).

The UK gas specification is set by Gas
Safety (Management) Regulations, which
use the Wobbe Index as the main parameter of interchangeability. The GSMR
set the limits of Wobbe at between 47.20
MJ/cu m and 51.41 MJ/cu m. This is a
narrower band of acceptable Wobbe, however, than many other countries specify,
including those in mainland Europe.
In response to the likely harmonization of future European gas-quality specifications, discussed later, the UK’s DTI has
led a program to identify the issues for the
UK, review options for gas processing at
entry points, assess appliance performance
under various gas-quality conditions, and
consult with industry on future policy.

appliance operation of Wobbe between
51.41 and 47.20 MJ/cu m and shows the
15 sample gases used as part of the DTI
test program to test some 25 different UK
appliance types representing more than
two-thirds of the UK appliance population.
The test program was designed to be
as representative as possible of the UK’s
existing gas appliance population. Testing
was on both new and used appliances
with the objectives of establishing the
impact on combustion performance and
emissions of operating on test gases at,
and beyond, GSMR limits, measuring
emissions and efficiency performance.
The program also examined the effect of
diluting natural gases with an inert gas
such as nitrogen.
It might be expected that modern
appliances would be less influenced than
older models by a change in the Wobbe
index. The drive for higher efficiency and
reduced emissions, however, has led to
new appliances tending to have burners
with a narrower Wobbe operating range,
in effect being tuned to the expected gasquality specification.
A summary of the program’s results
reported that:
• Ignition was OK for all test gases.

• Flame lift was not generally a problem.
• Little or no soot measured in the
flue gas, but some was deposited on the
decorative coals of the fires (for the higher
Wobbe Number test gases).
• NOx emissions increased as Wobbe
index increased.
• Little change in efficiency with Wobbe
index change.
• CO emissions increased with Wobbe
Number.
Industrial and commercial gas-fired
equipment was not tested as part of the
UK program but in general should be
more tolerant to a wider range of Wobbe
index and calorific value due to the
investment in more sophisticated process
controls such as air-fuel ratio and flue-gas
feedback and trim control systems. Gas
turbines for power generation, however,
would be particularly sensitive to rapid
changes in gas quality.
Other examples of processes and
equipment that could be adversely
affected include:
• Float glass and fiberglass production.

60

• Furnaces with controlled atmospheres.
• Ceramics and glazing processes.
• Gas engines.
• Direct-fired textile processes.
• Fertilizer manufacturing with natural
gas as a feedstock.
Changes in flame shape and radiation temperatures could affect most of
these industrial processes.
It is most likely, as a result of the
2-year gas quality program managed and
recently completed by the DTI, that
UK government will wish to retain the
GSMR specifications for a time, requiring
off-specification imports to be blended or
processed to comply with existing Wobbe
limits.1

European position
European Commission Directives
98/30/EC and 2003/55/EC aim to create a fully operational internal natural gas
market with common rules for transmission, distribution, supply, and storage of
natural gas. The differences in gas-quality
specifications across EU member states
have been a barrier to cross-border trade.

ISSUES, TRENDS, TECHNOLOGIES

Most European countries currently operate a narrow band of acceptable Wobbe Index. There
is agreement, however, that the Wobbe Index is the primary interchangeability factor. Several
European countries operate completely separate networks for high and low calorific natural
gas (Fig. 4; photo from Marcogaz).
The European Union Gas Regulatory
Forum (Madrid Forum) consists of representatives of member states, national regulatory authorities, gas industry operators
and suppliers, large industrial gas consumers, traders, and producers. In 2002, the
forum established EASEE-gas (European
Association for the Streamlining of
Energy Exchange), with a group objective
of giving all participants in the gas chain
a forum voluntarily to agree on a set of
common business practices. One part of
this has been to establish such a practice
for harmonization of natural gas quality.
The EASEE-gas specification for gas quality includes a proposed Wobbe range of
13.60 kw-hr/std, cu m to15.81 kw-hr/std.
cu m (47.0 MJ/cu m to 54 MJ/cu m).
Fig. 4, widely published via
Marcogaz,2 shows that most European
countries currently operate a narrower
band of acceptable Wobbe than the proposed EASEE-gas specification, but there
is agreement that the Wobbe Index is the
primary interchangeability factor.
It is also worth noting that several
European countries operate completely
separate networks for high and low
calorific natural gas.

24

April-June 2007 Vol. 4, No. 2

The European Commission has also
mandated CEN, the European standards
organization,3 to create a European
standard for gas quality giving the broadest limits of acceptable performance as
possible within reasonable cost. The CEN
mandate identifies the need for a survey
of all gas-fired equipment and appliances
across all European Union countries and
the need for a Europe-wide testing program
of a representative sample of appliances.
This would be similar in activity to,
although larger in numbers than, the
UK Gas Quality Programme. This effort
will provide data to analyze the impact
on safety, efficiency, and environment,
particularly for domestic appliances.
Following this work, CEN will
consider creating new test standards and
appliance performance standards to build
up a population of new appliances that
will be able to tolerate and work effectively
across a wider variation of gas quality.

US; rest of the world
The US has both state-by-state regulation and federal regulation related to gas

quality and gas interchangeability. In an
attempt to harmonize this position the
Natural Gas Council (NGC) has generated a guidance White Paper that reviews
the issues in great detail and concludes
that a Wobbe range of +/- 4% around the
typical or historical local gas value would
be acceptable.
This finding has been submitted
to the US Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission. Inputs were provided to this
work by Advantica, Gasunie, and Gaz de
France demonstrating a genuine enthusiasm to gain international consistency.
Within the last year, there has been
increasing activity in sharing knowledge
and awareness of gas quality and interchangeability development work because
it is being raised as an issue across the Far
East, particularly Japan, China, and Korea,
where LNG imports are significant, and in
India, where the impact of gas-quality fluctuations on natural gas vehicle operations
is becoming important. LNG

PROJECT UPDATES

Nigeria Train 6 nears start-up;
Turkey terminal receives ﬁrst LNG
Colleen Taylor Sen
GTI
Des Plaines, Ill.
African exports are poised to increase dramatically as Nigeria
LNG’s 3.7 million tonne/year (tpy) Train 6 nears start-up and
Equatorial New Guinea’s first 3.7-million-tpy trains came on
stream later in the year.
Final investment decisions are still pending on NLNG’s Train
7, Brass LNG, Olokola LNG, and Angola LNG, which together
would be able to produce more than 45 million tpy. Egypt’s two
LNG operations are also considering additional trains.
In Europe, Turkey’s Aliaga terminal and Excelerate Energy’s
Teesside GasPort received their first cargoes.

Africa
Nigeria LNG Ltd. signed five sales contracts for production from proposed Train 7 of the NLNG project, which with a
nameplate capacity of 8.4 million tpy, will be the world’s largest
single train. A final investment decision, however, had not been
announced in early March. Deliveries would start in 2012 and be
on an ex-ship basis.
A call for construction tenders has been issued. Shareholders
in NLNG are Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. (49%), Shell
Gas BV (25.6%), Total LNG Nigeria Ltd. (15%), and ENI
International (NA) Sarl (10.4%).
Agreements are with the BG Group, 2.25 million tpy; Royal
Dutch Shell, 2 million tpy; Total, 1.375 million tpy; Italy’s ENI,
1.375 million tpy; and Occidental Petroleum Co., 1 million tpy.
NLNG’s 3.7-million-tpy Train 6 is under construction and
will come on stream this year. Its output will be marked by Endesa,
Total, and Shell Western LNG for destinations in Europe and
the US. When it becomes operational, the entire complex will be
capable of producing 22 million tpy of LNG and 4 million tpy of
LPG and condensate from 3.6 bcfd of feed gas.
In Equatorial New Guinea, a mid-year start-up is slated for
EG LNG on Bioko Island. Participants are Marathon Oil (60%);
national gas company Sonagas (25%); Mitsui & Co. Ltd. (8.5%);
and Marubeni Corp. (6.5%). The entire output of the first 3.7million-tpy train, built by Bechtel, was sold to BG Gas Marketing
Ltd. for 17 years. Bechtel is also performing the front-end engineering and design work for a second 4.4-million-tpy train, which
could be fed by gas from Nigeria and Cameroon.
Other West African projects awaiting final investment decisions include:

• The two-train, 10-million-tpy Brass LNG project in
Nigeria’s Bayelsa State, owned by NNPC (49%) and Total, AGIP,
and ConocoPhillips (17% each), has signed memoranda of
understanding, each for 2 million tpy, with BP, BG Group, and
Suez, starting in 2011.
• The four-train 22-million tpy Olokola LNG project in
western Nigeria is proposed by NNPC (49.5%), Chevron (18.5%),
Shell (18.5%), and the BG Group (13.5%).
• Angola LNG is a 5-million-tpy project proposed by stateowned Sonangol (22.8%) and affiliates of Chevron (36.4%), and
ExxonMobil, Total, and BP (13.6% each). Contracts have been
awarded to Bechtel for advanced engineering and to a Dutch
joint venture for dredging work. The Angolan cabinet has passed
enabling legislation. If the decision is made soon, exports could
start in 2012. A second train is under discussion.
In Egypt, where BP reported a major gas discovery off the
Nile Delta, BP, Italy’s ENI, and the Egyptian government are
discussing addition of a second train to the SEGAS project at
Damietta. Shareholders are Spain’s Union Fenosa and Italy’s
ENI, which together have 80%, Egyptian Natural Gas Holding
Co. (10%), and Egyptian General Petroleum Corp. (10%). BP
would become a partner in the second train.
A third train is under consideration for Egypt’s other LNG
liquefaction project, Egyptian LNG at Idku, which currently has
two trains with total capacity of 7.2 million tpy. Partners are BG
Group (35.5%), Petronas (35.5%), EGPC (12.0%), Egyptian
Natural Gas Holding Co. (12.0%), and Gaz de France (5.0%)

Europe
In December 2006, the Egegaz terminal at Aliaga 60 km
south of Izmir, Turkey, received its first shipment of LNG since
it was completed in 2002. The 50,000-tonne cargo from Algeria
was delivered on the Larba ben M’Idi. Two more cargoes were
delivered in January, one from Trinidad, another from Algeria.
The first terminal in the world to be built on a purely speculative basis, the Aliaga facility never started operations because
there was no connection to the pipeline grid. Built by Chicago
Bridge & Iron, it has a capacity of 6.5 billion cu m (4.1 million tpy), two 140,000-cu m storage tanks, and a jetty for vessels
40,000 to 160,000 cu m in capacity. It can also accommodate
Q-flex vessels up to 215,000 cu m. Owner and operator Egegaz is
a subsidiary of the privately owned Colakoglu Group.
In the UK in February 2007, Excelerate Energy LLC received
its first cargo at its Teesside GasPort in northeast England, the second terminal now operating in the UK. The cargo from Trinidad
was regasified aboard the 138,000-cu m Excelsior and delivered
into the National Transmission System. The terminal can import

into the UK up to four cargos/month, which will be marketed by
the German company RWE Trading GmbH.
The delivery was preceded by the world’s first commercial
ship-to-ship (STS) transfer of LNG when the conventional carrier
Excalibur transferred 132,000 cu m to the Excelsior at Scapa Flow
in the Orkney Islands north of Scotland. The transfer followed
several months of test runs in the US Gulf of Mexico (LNGO,
Oct.-Dec. 2006, p. 4; and OGJ Online, Sept. 6, 2006).
Both ships are owned by Exmar and leased to Excelerate. The
Society of International Gas Terminal and Tanker Operators has
been drawing up draft guidelines for the STS transfer of LNG.
Exmar is looking to develop an offshore receiving terminal facility in Belgium, perhaps in partnership with Excelerate.
Antwerp and Zeebrugge are potential sites. Belgium’s only terminal at Zeebrugge, owned by Fluxys, will double its capacity to 9
billion cu m/year.

Middle East
The first train of the Yemen LNG project, 45% completed
at the end of 2006, is to ship its first cargo at yearend 2009.
A second train at the 6.7-million-tpy plant is to go online in
mid 2009. Partners are Total (39.62%), Hunt Oil Co. (17.22%),
Yemen Gas Co. (16.73%), SK Corp. (9.55%), Korea Gas Corp.
(6.0%), Hyundai Corp. (5.88%), and the General Authority for
Social Security & Pensions (5.0%).
Hunt Oil, in early 2007, was reported to be in talks with
China National Offshore Oil Corp. to sell its share for $600
million. The engineering contractor is the Yemgas Consortium
consisting of Technip, JGC Corp., and KBR.

In February, the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
approved two LNG terminals in Pascagoula, Miss.: Chevron
Corp.’s Casotte Landing terminal next to its refinery and Gulf
LNG Energy LLC’s terminal. In 2005, Sonangol acquired what
Gulf Energy called a “significant equity interest” in its project.
Chevron also holds 1 bcfd of capacity at Cheniere Energy’s
Sabine Pass terminal in Louisiana, set to start operations in
2008. FERC also approved Sempra Global LNG’s application
to expand the Cameron LNG terminal, under construction near
Hackberry, La., from 1.5 bcfd to 1.8 bcfd and eventually to 2.65
bcfd.
Dutch company 4Gas has acquired options for all the federal
and state permits issued for ExxonMobil’s proposed 7.5-milliontpy Vista del Sol LNG import terminal at Ingleside, Tex., as well
as pre-engineering and other technical materials related to the
project. Occidental Petroleum is re-evaluating the original 2008
start-up date for its planned terminal at Ingleside.
The US Maritime Administration granted deepwater
port licenses to Excelerate’s second US project, the Northeast
Gateway Deepwater Port 13 miles southeast of Gloucester, Mass.,
and to Suez LNG’s Neptune LNG facility 22 miles northeast of
Boston.
Both companies made commitments to hire a certain percentage of US mariners on ships visiting the ports and on their
existing fleet of carriers serving the US. (Under 2006 legislation,
Marad is to give priority to US-flagged ships in approving deepwater port projects.) Both projects were also given the go-ahead
by the state of Massachusetts.
Elsewhere, Marathon Oil Corp. and ConocoPhillips filed
for a 2-year extension of their Kenai, Alas., LNG plant’s export
license to Mar. 31, 2011. Since 1972, the plant has been shipping around 1.7 million tpy to Tokyo Gas Co. and Tokyo Electric
Power Co.
In South America, Peru LNG awarded a $1.5 billion engineering, procurement, and construction contract to Chicago
Bridge & Iron for its 5-million-tpy liquefaction plant in Pampa
Melchorita 168 km south of Lima. Participants are operator Hunt
Oil Co. (50%), Korea’s SK Corp (30%), and Repsol YPF (20%).
Gas from the Camisea field will be transported to the plant
through a 408-km, 34-in. OD pipeline. Repsol is responsible for
marketing the LNG. New terminals in Chile and Manzanillo,
Mexico, are potential destinations.
On the Atlantic side, the government of Trinidad and Tobago
is studying the feasibility of building a fifth train at Atlantic LNG,
called Train X. The study will evaluate the availability of reserves
and future domestic demand. In March, Jamaican Prime Minister
Portia Simpson Miller and Venezuelan Pres. Hugo Chavez signed
a memorandum of understanding for sale of 2.5 million tpy of

LNG starting in 2009. Details of the project are to be worked
out by Venezuelan and Jamaican officials. The regasified LNG
will be used in Jamaica’s beauxite and alumina industry and for
power generation.
Trinidad and Tobago 2 years ago singed an MOU to supply
Jamaica with 1.15 million tpy of LNG but the agreement was
abandoned, the Jamaica Gleaner reported. Although an LNG
project has been discussed in Venezuela since the 1970s, no plant
is under construction. One possibility is to ship Venezuelan gas
from offshore fields that lie between Venezuela and Trinidad to
Train X.
Brazil’s state-owned Petrobras has signed an MOU with
Russia’s Gazprom to “identify cooperation opportunities for
oil and gas project development,” including LNG projects. To
reduce its dependence on Bolivian natural gas imports, Brazil is
planning to build at least two offshore LNG terminals by 200809, one in the southeast near Rio de Janeiro, the other in the
northeast.

delivery this year to supply India’s burgeoning demand in the
face of declining domestic production.
Petronet, a partnership of four government oil and gas agencies, plans to double capacity at its 5-million-tpy Dahej terminal
and is leasing capacity at Shell’s LNG terminal in Hazira. Shell
and Total aim to import 24 cargoes into their 2.5-million-tpy terminal in Hazira, this year, about 56% of the terminal’s capacity.
Petronet partner GAIL has proposed to transport some of
the regasified LNG from Dahej and Hazira to Dabhol through a
new pipeline to the power plant at Dabhol, where an LNG plant
built by Enron has been mothballed since 2001. The government
is considering selling the terminal to a company, such as Reliance
Industries or Gujarat State Petroleum Corp., that can roll in the
price of imported LNG with domestic gas supplies.
Iran is studying the feasibility of building an LNG terminal
and power plant in Mirissa, Sri Lanka. Shell and Repsol YPF
are negotiating with the National Iranian Oil Co. to develop
two blocks in South Pars Field and a 16-million-tpy liquefaction
plant, while Total and Petronas are working with NIOC on
another LNG project.LNG

Petronet LNG, India’s largest LNG importer, is seeking as
many as 40 spot cargoes (equivalent to 2.25 million tons) for

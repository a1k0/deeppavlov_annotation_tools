COVER
Independence Hub LLC, a venture of Enterprise Field Services
LLC (80%) and Helix Energy Solutions (20%), owns the
Independence Hub (IHUB) semisubmersible natural gas processing platform. Anadarko Petroleum Corp. will operate processing
on the hub on behalf of gas field owners that include Anadarko,
Dominion Exploration & Production, Devon Energy Corp., Hydro
Gulf of Mexico, and Murphy Oil Corp. Production from the fields
served by IHUB, stationed in water 8,000 ft deep on Mississippi
Canyon Block 920, is to begin in second-half 2007. Enterprise
hired Heerema Marine Contractors Nederland BV for installation
of the IHUB, including all risers. Heerema used its Deepwater
Construction Vessel Balder for the IHUB installation. More on the
installation of IHUB’s export riser, the largest steel catenary riser
ever installed, forms part of Oil & Gas Journal’s exclusive annual
report on Offshore Petroleum Operations that begins on p. 57. Photo from Enterprise Products Partners LP.

Iraq study sees output hike, conﬁrms reserves
Iraq could double oil production capacity to 4 million b/d in 5
years with little effort, according to a 12-month study of its reservoirs by IHS Inc., London.
The study, to be published in May as an Iraq Atlas, confirmed
longstanding conventional wisdom that Iraq has 116 billion bbl of
proved and probable oil reserves and 100 tcf of gas reserves. Basin
studies indicated that another 100 billion bbl of oil and a large
volume of gas can be recovered from the country’s hardly explored
western desert.
The study group assessed 435 undrilled prospects and noncommercial discoveries and 81 producing fields and commercial
discoveries. The group evaluated the reservoirs using new information and reassessed and validated all field reserves and production
numbers.
The government, which needs $20-25 billion in investment in
its E&P sector, is expected to launch a bid round for 65 exploration
blocks and 78 fields in 2007.
The western desert estimate, which IHS said has a large error
margin, was developed from new play concepts generated in a recent study of the Western Arabian platform. Iraq has made only one
discovery in the region, which is expected to hold oil in Silurian
rocks and gas in Ordovician formations.
Given a stable political and civil environment, Iraq could boost
its capacity from just under 2 million b/d presently by restoring
shut-in wells to production in northern fields and drilling infill
wells in southern fields without using new technology or enhanced
oil recovery methods, the group found.

averaged 7.2 million b/d, slightly higher than in our last report,
bringing yearly growth to 6.9%,” IEA said.
The agency said January’s relatively modest—by Chinese standards—pace of growth is explained by the fact that oil product
demand was particularly strong in January 2006, buoyed by Lunar
New Year festivities, which prompt a surge in demand, particularly
of gas oil as many Chinese citizens travel home.
The 2007 celebrations, by contrast, took place in February. In
anticipation, the government ordered refiners to cut gas oil exports
in February to meet the surge of domestic demand that month.
In late January, the government also reduced jet fuel surcharges
for domestic airlines by 17-20% to encourage air travel—the surcharges had been raised in August 2006.
Meanwhile, citing recently released data from the China Electric
Power News, IEA said that over the next few years the country
is unlikely to see a repeat of its 2004 oil demand surge, when
electricity shortages were met mostly by small diesel generators,
especially in rural areas.
China expanded its generating capacity by 102 Gw in 2006 to
a total of 520 Gw, IEA said. As a result, China’s generating margin—the spare capacity available to meet peak demand—is “likely
to reach some 10 Gw this summer, compared with [a] 40 Gw
shortfall in 2004.”
However, IEA said, 90% of China’s new power plants are coalfired, while hydropower accounts for another 9%. It said nuclear
and other forms of energy represent less than 1% of China’s capacity.

IEA raises China’s 2007 product demand estimate
The International Energy Agency, Paris, has revised upwards its
forecast for China’s 2007 total oil product demand by 6.1% to 7.6
million b/d due to refining and trade data showing stronger-thanexpected apparent demand in the first 2 months.
IEA said its projections for Chinese apparent demand in the first
quarter have also been revised upward by 300,000 b/d to 7.61
million b/d. The agency also said it lowered its second quarter demand projection by 600,000 b/d to 7.7 million b/d.
According to preliminary data, January’s apparent demand increased by 4.1% on an annual basis, IEA said. Apparent demand is
defined as refinery output plus net oil product imports adjusted for
fuel oil and direct crude burning, smuggling, and stock changes.
The Asian giant’s demand increases were driven mostly by
naphtha (up 12.4%), gasoline (up 3.3%), gas oil (up 5.9%), and
other products (up 27%).
“Following further revisions to last year’s monthly data, particularly in fourth-quarter 2006, we estimate that demand in 2006

Australia Resources Minister Ian Macfarlane has rejected calls
from the oil and gas industry for government to provide tax breaks
to stimulate investment in LNG projects (OGJ Online, Apr. 17,
2007).
The minister told delegates to the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association (APPEA) conference in Adelaide that
the industry should seize the opportunity to expand its gas programs before overseas customers decided to “leapfrog” this fuel
and go straight to the nuclear solution to greenhouse-gas emissions.
He said the Australian industry already has plenty of incentive in
high world oil and gas prices, and that the government has given
industry accelerated depreciation on upstream assets already and
provided a 150% tax break for working in frontier exploration areas.
“If the industry does not get down and go hard, companies may
find customers go straight to the one proven base-load, zero-emission technology for the production of electricity,” he said. “That’s
nuclear.”

projects quickly to optimize the high gas prices, particularly for
LNG, that we are now seeing around the Asia-Pacific Rim.”
Macfarlane was responding to a 64-point strategy document
released on the eve of the conference that called for stimulation of
the industry by providing tax relief and depreciation allowances.
He said his comments were delivered to industry as a caution
rather than a warning.

Chevron, Weyerhaeuser jointly assessing biofuels
Chevron Corp. and Weyerhaeuser Co. agreed to jointly assess the
feasibility of commercializing biofuels production from cellulose
sources. The companies will focus on developing technology that
can transform wood fiber and other nonfood sources of cellulose
into biofuels for cars and trucks.

Apache tests Zaina-2 oil well in Egypt
Apache Corp.’s Zaina-2 well in Egypt’s Western Desert tested
1,067 b/d of oil from 12 ft of pay in the Abu Roash G-10 sand,
the company reported. Zaina field, which Apache operates, is in the
company’s East Bahariya concession.
The discovery well, Zaina-1, flowed on test 1,165 b/d of oil in
July 2005 from 55 ft of oil pay in the Upper Bahariya sand. The
Abu Roash G-10 sand is a new producing zone in the field. The Abu
Roash G-10 and G-20 sands, with 39 ft of total indicated oil pay,
are behind-pipe recompletion targets for Zaina-1, which currently
produces 560 b/d of oil.
Apache, which had acquired a 50% interest in the East Bahariya
concession in 1997, became operator and gained its 100% contractor interest in 2001. Apache and Repsol YPF SA made the first
discovery on the concession, the Karama-1X, in early 1997. The
concession has produced 21 million bbl of oil since Apache began
operations, with 18,500 b/d currently flowing. The company plans
to drill 39 development wells there this year.

Egypt continues Meleiha concession until 2024
Egypt has extended until 2024 the length of its concession
agreement with the group developing Meleiha Block in the Western Desert. The group plans to produce 840,000 tonnes of oil in
2007 compared with 800,000 tonnes in 2006.
Melehia holds 34 million tonnes of initial oil reserves. On the
block are 129 operating wells that have produced more than 17
million tonnes of oil during the past 30 years.

Bass Strait’s future as a major oil province will continue for some
years, according to operator ExxonMobil Corp. The company’s lead
country manager Mark Nolan said he is confident that the area’s
140,000 b/d of liquids output can be held steady.
Speaking at the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration
Association conference in Adelaide, Nolan said ExxonMobil and its
50% partner BHP Billiton were under constant production pres-

Agiba—a joint venture of state-owned Egyptian General Petroleum Corp., IEOC, and IFC—operates the development project.

Partners spud Golitza-1 well in Bulgaria
JKX Bulgaria Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of JKX Oil & Gas
PLC, has spudded the Golitza-1 exploration well targeting Jurassic
sands, Triassic limestones, and Triassic sands on the B-Golitza exploration permit in Bulgaria, said Aurelian Oil & Gas PLC. Aurelian’s
wholly owned subsidiary Balkan Explorers Bulgaria Ltd. is 50%
partner on the permit.
The onshore well aims to reach 4,900 m TD and will hit a large
tilted fault block through near vertical drilling during the next 120
days, Aurelian said. Romanian driller Dafora SA will use a 2,000-hp
rig to drill Golitza-1.
B-Golitza is on the southern edge of the Moesian platform
where the Miocene Balkan Thrust Front strikes east-west across
Bulgaria. A number of wells have been drilled in the area, but none
has penetrated the target formations in a comparable structural setting, according to Aurelian.
Aurelian said nothing has been tested to date along the trend
that Golitza-1 will target. “We are therefore not underestimating
the risk of the play,” it said. “However, all the required elements for
a discovery are interpreted to be present.” ✦

The venture combines Chevron’s technology capabilities in molecular conversion, product engineering, advanced fuel manufacturing, and fuels distribution with Weyerhaeuser’s expertise in the
collection and transformation of cellulosics into engineered materials, land stewardship, crop management, and biomass conversion.
Feedstock options include a wide range of materials from Weyerhaeuser’s existing forest and mill system and cellulosic crops
planted on its managed forest plantations.
Chevron already was involved with biofuels research through
alliances with the Georgia Institute of Technology, the University
of California at Davis, the Colorado Center for Biorefining and Biofuels, and the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory. ✦

sure because of Bass Strait’s annual 20%-plus natural production
decline rate.
Thanks to high oil prices, however, production from wells flowing as little as 1,000 b/d has become attractive.
After completing a $100 million (Aus.) 3D seismic program
early this decade, ExxonMobil has carried out extensive infill drilling in Bass Strait.

Federal judge ﬁnes Sinclair Tulsa Reﬁning
A federal judge ordered Sinclair Tulsa Refining Co. on Apr. 4
to pay a $5 million criminal fine and sentenced two of its former
managers to 6 months of home detention and 3 years of probation
for violating provisions of the US Clean Water Act (OGJ Online,
Dec. 19, 2006).
US District Judge Claire V. Eagan also ordered the Sinclair Oil
Corp. subsidiary to make a $500,000 community service payment
to the River Parks Authority, which strives to maintain, preserve,
and develop the Arkansas River and adjacent land. She also sentenced the company to 2 years of probation. Eagan fined one former

manager, Harmon Connell, $160,000 and ordered him to provide
100 hr of community service. The other, John Kapura, was fined
$50,000 and ordered to provide 50 hr of community service.
The company and its two former employees previously admitted to knowingly manipulating refinery processes and wastewater
flows and discharges to create unrepresentative samplings during
mandatory sampling under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit program. The US Department of Justice said
the manipulated samples were intended to influence analytical testing results reported to the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality and the US Environmental Protection Agency. ✦

Consortium plans Papua New Guinea LNG plant
Santos Ltd. has joined a consortium of ExxonMobil Corp., Oil
Search Ltd., and Nippon Oil in planning a 5-6.5 million tonne/
year gas liquefaction plant in Papua New Guinea.
In joining the consortium, Santos signed a cost-sharing agreement to carry out a preliminary front-end engineering and design
study for the stand-alone LNG plant that would rely primarily on
gas feedstock from Hides field in the central highlands.
The $60 million pre-FEED phase, to be completed by yearend,
will evaluate the technical and commercial merits of establishing
the LNG facility, planned to come on stream by 2012-13.
The study also will determine the best development concept, select a preferred site—likely to be on the Papuan Gulf coast—determine the best field configuration and unitization framework, and
examine fiscal terms with the Papua New Guinea government.
Although Hides would be the primary gas supply, additional
feedstock could come from nearby Angore and Juha fields (OGJ
Online, Apr. 3, 2007).
Santos agreed to buy FEED data previously undertaken for the
upstream part of the now-defunct Papua New Guniea gas pipeline
to Queensland and to reimburse ExxonMobil for a proportionate
share of costs already incurred for LNG studies.
ExxonMobil, which holds 49% interest, will operate the plant.
Oil Search will have a 32% interest, Santos 17%, and Nippon Oil
2%.

Petrobras unit to add to oil tanker ﬂeet
Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) shipping subsidiary Transpetro, following a favorable court order last month, has signed
contracts valued at $866 million for the construction of nine oil
tankers.
Petrobras said the Rio Naval consortium will build five Aframax
tankers for $517 million and four Panamax tankers for $349 million. The ships, part of a $2.48 billion program to buy 26 oil vessels, will join Transpetro’s fleet in 2009-11.
The signing was enabled by a Mar. 23 ruling of Brazil’s Tribunal
de Contas da Uni’o (TCU), which lifted an earlier suspension of
contracts for 16 tankers. The court reversed its earlier decision after
consideration of a detailed submission presented to Brazil’s internal auditor on Mar. 9, as well as a presentation by Transpetro Pres.
Sergio Machado on Mar. 12.
Aroldo Cedraz, the minister responsible for the TCU, had blocked

the contracts at the end of February, claiming that was a clear possibility of damage to the company due to the absence of detail of
the indirect costs and inadequate criteria to fight and forecast any
readjustment in prices.
Petrobras wants to increase the number of its oil vessels to 42
under a plan financed by Brazil’s National Development Bank. Under the plan, BNDES aims to reduce Petrobras’s costs for chartering
foreign ships and revitalize Brazil’s shipbuilding industry.
The Rio Naval consortium comprises Brazilian shipbuilders
MPE, IESA, and Sermetal, in partnership with South Korea’s Hyundai Heavy Industries.

China mulls formation of two LNG shipping JVs
Chinese authorities are considering plans to establish two
LNG shipping ventures, both to be under the supervision of
the state-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC).
The official Shanghai Securities News said China Shipping
(Group) Co. Ltd., China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC), and
China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (Sinopec) plan to set up an LNG
shipping joint venture, with an initial agreement to be reached by
the end of June, according to China Shipping Group Pres. Li Shaode.
Li told the newspaper the JV will order carriers from Hudong
Shipyard, which is controlled by China State Shipbuilding Corp.
The second JV, Hong Kong-based China LNG Shipping Holdings Co. Ltd. (CLNG)—a JV of China Ocean Shipping (Group) Co.
and China Merchants Group—is talking with China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC), the newspaper said.
CLNG has ordered five LNG shipping vessels from Hudong
Shipyard, one of which is due for delivery in November, the paper
said. Current plans call for three of the vessels to ship LNG imported from Australia to Guangdong, while the other two will ship
LNG imported from Indonesia to Fujian.
The paper said that under SASAC requirements, the two JV firms
will supply different regions of the country.
The China Shipping, CNPC, and Sinopec JV will ship imported
LNG to terminals in northern China such as Qingdao, Dalian, and
Yingkou.
The CLNG and CNOOC JV will ship imported LNG to terminals
in Shanghai and the southern provinces, including Guangdong,
Fujian, and Zhejiang. ✦

“In a way,” said Barry Russell, IPAA’s
current president, “he was a throwback

even though he wasn’t an elected official or part of the government, because
he cared so much about this country
and its energy policies.”
Unsell worked with other groups on
issues like tax reform and energy policy,
said Russell, who joined IPAA in 1980,
adding: “He never talked negatively
about anybody, even political adversaries.”

’Environmental purism’
In the foreword to his memoirs,
Unsell recalled the industry’s political critics since World War II, “some
who could justify industry-bashing
as a strategy to advance their controlling philosophies, and some who were
opportunists adept at recognizing any
vulnerable target when it entered their
field of vision.”
He wrote, “Much of that has
changed now. In fact, sheer antioil
demagoguery once rampant in Washington has all but disappeared, but
environmental purism has become so
identified with the public weal that
political actions addressing the nation’s
energy policy dilemmas seem less likely
than ever.”
Less known than Unsell’s IPAA

Mall in the early 1980s. He was cochair

which raised more than $1 million
in contributions. The US petroleum
industry provided more than any other
business. ✦

The painful climate step
ConocoPhillips has adopted a thoughtful approach to climate change that comes up one step
short of comprehensive. Room remains for argument about whether the US truly needs the “mandatory national framework to address greenhousegas emissions” for which the company declares
support. Yet political pressure has intensified to the
point that some form of mandatory action seems
inevitable. If nothing else, such a move would end
the uncertainty now plaguing business decisions. It
might even quell the extremism that has made reasoned discussion about a complex issue impossible.

companies should take the step sooner rather than
later. It’s the only way to assure the transparency,
cost visibility, and efficiency upheld by ConocoPhillips.
For oil companies, however, the step requires
crossing what should be a painful line. It’s support

Securing future energy supplies has
become a key aim of China’s energy
and foreign policies. Beijing officially
joined the World Trade Organization
in December 2001. Around this time,
then-Premier Zhu Rongji, and Hu Jintao, general secretary of the Communist
Party, called on Chinese companies to
pursue a Zou Chu Qu or “going-out”
policy, which should be seen as part of
a broader policy of global economic
engagement.4
Three major characteristics of this
policy can be identified:
• Chinese oil companies have only
a short history of mergers and acquisitions abroad. The policy was launched
and gained momentum only in the last
several years. In the mid-1990s most of
China’s oil deals were in three countries—Indonesia, Oman, and Yemen.

South America, Africa, Asia, and the
Middle East.
• Chinese companies have sought to
establish presence mostly in countries
where American and European companies are absent or have withdrawn.
These targeted countries, such as Iran,
Sudan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela, have
adopted domestic and foreign policies
that are largely in contrast with the
interests of Western powers.
• Despite conscious efforts to
diversify import sources, China’s oil
suppliers are heavily concentrated in the
Middle East and Africa. These regions
are likely to continue providing the
bulk of China’s oil needs.
Following are profiles of countries
and regions in which China has shown
special interest:

Russia
On the bilateral level, China’s relations with Russia have substantially
improved since the early 1990s. Close
cooperation between the nations was
enshrined in the Friendship and Cooperation Treaty of July 2001.

Since June 2005, Russia and China
signed the final demarcation of their
long borders. Bilateral trade has experienced exponential growth. China has
become Russia’s second-largest trading
partner after the European Union.
Despite similar perceptions and joint
interests, some Russian policy-makers
are concerned about China’s rising economic and strategic power. In addition,
Russia’s Pacific provinces are vulnerable
to China’s legal and illegal immigration.
Finally, Beijing’s and Moscow’s interests
differ in Central Asia, where both seek
influence.
These contradictory strategic trends
have restrained energy cooperation between China and Russia. In 2006 CNPC
wanted to buy $3 billion of the shares
in the Russian energy giant Rosneft, but
it was allocated a bloc of shares valued
at $500 million.
However construction has begun on
parts of the long oil pipeline Russia is
laying between Taishet in Eastern Siberia
to Skovorodino on the border with
China.

facilities, Reliant Center (706,213 gsf

Reliant Stadium, Reliant Arena and
Reliant Astrodome.

Central Asia
Central Asia is particularly attractive
to China for many reasons: The region
is known to have large hydrocarbon reserves; imports from Central Asia would
reduce China’s overwhelming dependence on the Middle East; and shipping oil and gas by land from Central
Asia would help China avoid sea lanes
largely dominated by the US navy.
Central Asian producers, for their
part, can reduce their equally overwhelming dependence on Russia by
exporting some of their oil and gas to
China.
Within this context, China and Central Asian producers have pursued their
mutually beneficial energy interests. In
April 2006 Chinese President Hu Jintao
signed agreements with the late Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov for
Turkmenistan to sell gas to China and
to build a pipeline to deliver it. In June

In May 2006 China began receiving
crude oil from its first transnational oil
pipeline. The pipeline was developed by
the Sino-Kazakh Pipeline Co., a 50-50
joint venture of CNPC and Kazakhstan’s
KazTransOil. The Kazakh and Chinese
governments also have explored the
possibility of laying a gas pipeline parallel to the oil pipeline.5

The Middle East

Like African states, Middle Eastern oil
producers share significant commercial
and strategic interests with China. With
oil, Middle Eastern producers want
to secure a buyer, and China wants to
secure a reliable supplier.

IEA sees 2.6 million-b/d near-term gain in OPEC capacity
Members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by
Angola and Saudi Arabia, will increase
total capacity to produce crude oil this
year and next by a net 2.6 million b/d.
The International Energy Agency
made that forecast in its April Oil
Market Report, warning of uncertainty
about developments in Nigeria, Venezuela, and Iraq and noting that the crude

streams due on stream will be “relatively sweet.”
Net of assumed declines in existing
fields, OPEC production capacity will
rise to 34.8 million b/d by the end of
this year from 33.9 million b/d at the
end of 2006, IEA said. By yearend 2008
it will reach 36.5 million b/d.
The assessment assumes decline rates
ranging from 1-5%/year for onshore
fields in the Persian Gulf region to 12-

15%/year for deepwater fields.
The projected increase for 2008
assumes partial resumption of the
450,000 b/d of production in Nigeria
now shut in by political violence. The
projection for both years assumes no
change in capacities of Venezuela and
Iraq.
“Clearly, developments in all three of
these countries are surrounded by risks
both on the downside and the upside,”
IEA said. The agency also warned of development delays that might result from
tight service and drilling markets.
Of nearly 4 million b/d of new
crude supply coming onto production
from OPEC members through 2008,
56% will have sulfur content of less
than 1%, IEA said. Crude containing
more than 2% sulfur will account for
less than 20% of the new supplies.
The increment will be about evenly
split between light, medium, and heavy
grades. The high crude quality largely
reflects increases in African crudes,
some of which have high wax and acid
contents.

Al Hamli: OPEC ‘fully committed’ to continuous oil supply
Eric Watkins
Senior Correspondent
The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, while seeking
security of demand, is fully committed
to a continuous supply of oil on the
international market, according to the
group’s president.
“There should be no doubt that
OPEC members are fully committed to
ensure regular supplies to consumers
and maintain market stability,” said
Mohamed Al Hamli, who also serves as
UAE’s energy minister.

28

Al Hamli told an oil conference in
Dubai that the organization’s commitment has been proven “time and again,
during crises brought about by severe
weather conditions, geopolitical tensions, or disruption of supplies caused
by unrest.”
But he said the 12-member group
is concerned by subsidies given by
consuming nations to competing fuels
that seek to “divert investments away”
from the oil industry or “discriminate”
against oil.
“Producing countries cannot spend
precious funds needed elsewhere on

expanding facilities when their customers are telling them that they intend to
reduce dependence on OPEC oil,” he
warned.
Underlining the global need for
energy security, Al Hamli said OPEC
members, as a condition of their investment in capacity expansion, want
to know that consuming nations are
committed to the purchase of oil.
“This would greatly strengthen
producing countries’ resolve to invest
in future capacity expansion. The result
would be greater energy security for
all,” he told the conference.

investment and capacity growth is not
enough to meet future oil demand.”

Minister Mohamed Al Hamli countered that the oil market is much better

the same level as in 2006 and will be
“correctly supplied.” He said recent
high oil prices have been pulled along
by geopolitics, and there is no need
for OPEC to meet before the scheduled
September meeting.

Demand security needed
Nevertheless, Al Hamli was concerned about what he called the “mixed
message” on future oil demand during
2010-20. OPEC’s crude capacity is to
increase to nearly 40 million b/d in
2010 from 35 million b/d in 2006. He
insisted that oil-producing countries
need “a backup of [demand] security”
to engage in further investments to
increase oil production.
Besides soaring costs, which are
inflated so much that producers must
scrap some projects, demand security is
being eroded by the widely publicized
environmental concerns that are leading
consumer countries to reduce fossil fuel
dependence by switching to renewables
and biofuels, by energy conservation,
and by increasing strategic petroleum
reserves. “We cannot produce more oil
than the world will buy,” Al Hamli said.
He added that OPEC strongly supports
carbon dioxide capture and storage,
which he described as “a win-win technology” for sustainable development.
Qatar’s Second Deputy Premier
and Minister of Energy and Industry
Abdullah Bin Hamad Al Attiyah, also

fuels or establish subsidies to promote

Tension: the
Iranian view

I

ran’s First Vice-President Parviz Davudi last week said that his country would do its level best to prepare
a proper ground free from tension
for attraction of foreign investment
in the oil, gas, and petrochemical
industries.
Davudi made the statement at the
inaugural ceremony of the 12th oil,
gas, and petrochemical exhibition in
Tehran. Oil Minister Kazem VaziriHamaneh also attended the inaugural
ceremony of the 5-day exhibition.
Reports said that 797 domestic
and 510 foreign companies from 35
countries participated in the event.
The Iranians were pleased to say the
number of participants in the event
increased by 15 foreign and 7 domestic companies from the previous
round.

studying marketing, identifying opportunities for joint ventures, and
holding meetings with final consumers of products as well as current
purchasers.

Unveiled threat

Under the gun of United Nations
sanctions, of course, the Iranians
need all of the friends they can muster. But the Iranians have a funny way
of trying to reduce tension in their
effort to attract more foreign investment. No one said a word about the
country’s stepping away from its
nuclear ambitions. Nor, for that matter, did anyone talk of negotiations
with the UN Security Council.
To the contrary—and to the
amazement of world observers—at
the conference, the Iranian government actually refused to rule out the

economically viable.”
He called on OECD countries to
invest in downstream supply chains
such as refineries and LNG receiving
terminals to complement producing
countries’ efforts.
To achieve OPEC’s mission of a
stable and sustainable energy market,
Al Attiyah said, “We are implementing
important projects aiming at increasing our crude oil production capacity
from approximately 800,000 b/d to 1
million b/d.”
Al Hamli said he believed, like Al Attiyah, that “there is enough oil and gas
to last for many years.” He said, “The
instability we have faced in the past is
because of not recognizing the linkages
in the energy markets.”
Listing “three key uncertainties in
the oil outlook,” Fatih Birol, IEA chief
economist and head of the agency’s
economic analysis division, examined
the pace and nature of China’s economic growth. If China’s GDP growth
should fall to 7% from the current 9%,
the country would need 11 million b/d
of oil over the next 10 years, up from
the past year’s 7 million b/d. If growth
should remain at 9%, oil needs would
jump to 14 million b/d, Birol said.
Other uncertainties he listed were
the expected 8%/year production
decline in mature oil fields during
2007-30 and oil demand coming from
regions where there are subsidies on oil
products.

IOCs and NOCs
The third challenge facing the industry is the changing relationship between
IOCs and NOCs, which is impacting oil
production via access to reserves. Representatives from the four OPEC countries
attending the summit—Qatar, Algeria,
the UAE, and Saudi Arabia—expressed
the necessity and advantages of maintaining partnerships with IOCs, even
through new ways might be found to
suit each of the partners.
Sonatrach’s Pres. and CEO Mohammed Meziane said the concept of
partnership “is central to Sonatrach’s
vision and strategy.” The challenge to

compete successfully in today’s business
environment “is prompting both NOCs
and IOCs to join their efforts along the
value chain for more close cooperation,” he said.
Ibrahim Al-Muhanna, advisor to Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, maintained
that mutual cooperation is needed, adding that Saudi Aramco is itself “an IOC
working closely with oil companies in
different parts of the world.”
But Nader Hamad Sultan, chairman
of Ikarus Petroleum Holdings and former chief executive of Kuwait Petroleum Corp., was more confrontational,
charging that the “new Seven Sisters”

are now the rule makers and want to
control everything. “Are the NOCs
competing with the old Seven Sisters,
or don’t they need them? Have IOCs
become too big with more riches than
the [gross domestic product] of the
countries they work in?” he asked.
Hard-line resource nationalists such
as Venezuela, Bolivia, and Russia did
not attend the summit, but representatives from two IOCs invited as keynote
speakers—Royal Dutch Shell’s Chief
Executive Jeroen van der Veer and Total’s
Chief Executive Christophe de Margerie—favored cooperation with NOCs
rather than competition.

“Easy oil doesn’t need Shell and is
not for IOCs, said Van der Veer. “Difficulties provide more than a number
of opportunities for Shell and room for
others.”
De Margerie also said NOC-IOC
cooperation is needed. New production
“will be largely based on huge hightech projects,” and NOCs should bring
their investment effort more in line
with IOCs, or be more open to let them
invest “because new developments are
an industrial, financial, political, and
human challenge.” What is needed, he
said, is confidence based on “mutual
understanding and respect.” ✦

GAO: Deepwater royalty relief impact hard to pin down
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
Deepwater royalty relief will cost the
US government billions of dollars, but
uncertainty about prices and production
levels make precise estimates impossible
at this time, the Government Accountability Office said in an Apr. 12 report.
It nevertheless found that the US
Minerals Management Service produced
reasonable estimates of future potential
royalties that were lost because deepwater leases in the Gulf of Mexico in
1998-99 were issued without price
thresholds. It said MMS estimated in
February that the amounts lost could
reach $6.4-9.8 billion in addition to the
$1 billion that has already been lost.

GAO saw “considerably more uncertainty” regarding the amount of lease
revenues potentially lost from leases
issued in 1996, 1997, and 2000 because of Kerr-McGee’s challenge of the
US Interior Dept. agency’s authority to
include price thresholds.
“Although MMS has not yet updated
its 2004 estimate of the future potential royalty losses on the leases at issue
in the Kerr-McGee suit, it is clear that
such an update could differ significantly
from its earlier estimate because of
likely changes to price and production
assumptions,” the congressional watchdog service said.
Congress will need more current
information, it continued. It recommended that MMS report the status

of leases and annual amount of royalties lost from the 1998-99 deepwater
leases until the issue is resolved. GAO
also suggested that MMS supply similar
estimates for leases involved in the
Kerr-McGee lawsuit to Congress (OGJ
Online, July 5, 2006).
GAO prepared the report in response
to a January 2006 request from US Sen.
Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), then-chief minority member and current chairman
of the Energy and Natural Resources
Committee. “My fundamental goal in
moving ahead on this serious matter is
to recover the lost funds. I plan to carefully review the report and will soon
introduce legislation that builds on
GAO’s recommendations,” Bingaman
said Apr. 12. ✦

recovery applications so far. “Power
plant-scale volumes of CO2 have been
handled, transported, and injected
into geologic reservoirs for more than
30 years as part of EOR operations
in the Permian basin of West Texas,”
said George Guthrie, fossil energy
and development programs director
at the Los Alamos National Laboratory

(LANL) in New Mexico.
Analog sites can provide information on long-term concerns such as the
fate and impact of CO2 storage, Guthrie said. “Wellbores are an excellent
example. They are a critical component
of the containment system. They are
used to place the buoyant CO2 below
an impermeable barrier. The problem

is that wellbores use cement which
may degrade when exposed to CO2 and
water,” he said.

Field-based study
As part of the LANL’s support of
DOE’s carbon sequestration program,
Guthrie said the laboratory recently
completed the first field-based study of
this issue using samples from a mature
EOR site.
“The results show that interactions
do occur, but complete degradation
may not be an issue for some geologic
environments,” Guthrie said. “In fact,
in some cases, beneficial reactions may
actually improve the integrity of the
wellbore. We need more studies, but
these results demonstrate the importance of field observations in developing a reliable risk framework.”
A major question that emerged during the hearing was whether to fund
pilot projects using available technologies and information or identify future
storage locations and carbon capture,
transmission, and storage techniques.
Another involved liability and whether
treating industrially produced CO2 as
a waste would limit its reuse beyond
EOR.
DOE’s Shope said the department’s
regional carbon sequestration partnerships have identified potential Canadian
and US sites where more than 3,500
billion tons of CO2 might be stored. But
Myers of USGS said more rigorous research, with a full scientific peer review,
is needed. He said it would take a year
to develop the methodology, another
year to conduct the peer review, and 23 additional years to complete.
That led committee member Craig
Thomas (R-Wyo.) to observe: “Sometimes, we get so taken up with research
that we don’t move forward with information we already have.”
Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-NM)
called the hearing to discuss two bills
before the committee. S. 731 would
request the Interior secretary to oversee a USGS study that would develop
a methodology for, and completion
of, a national assessment of geological

Report: Offshore spending to reach $275 billion by 2011
Steady increases in offshore oil and
gas production will drive up industry’s
annual spending to more than $275
billion by 2011 from $219 billion in
2006, according to a forecast published by Douglas-Westwood and
Energyfiles.
The report, World Offshore Oil &
Gas Production and Spend Forecast
2007-11, said offshore oil production
has risen by more than a third since
1991 and is forecast to continue to
rise at about the same rate, reaching
35 million b/d in 2011. Offshore gas
production, meanwhile, has more than
doubled in the same period—to 867
billion cu m in 2006, or 14.9 million
boe/d. It will almost double again by
2011, forecast the report.
While offshore oil and gas fields are
distributed across the world, only three
regions—the North Sea, the Gulf of
Mexico, and the South China Sea—attract more than half of this spending,
said report author Michael R. Smith.
“Yet relative shares are changing, with
growth forecast everywhere except
42

Western Europe,” he said.
“Expensive deepwater projects in
West Africa and the Gulf of Mexico as
well as projects in the Caspian Sea and
Sakhalin and new activity in the Persian
Gulf are disproportionately increasing spending shares in these regions,”
Smith said. Offshore oil output is
expected to peak within 10 years at less
than 40 million b/d but the global peak
for gas is not predicted until at least
2030, he said.

Price effects

higher-specification rigs, new production systems and associated hardware,
and in personnel.”
Over the next 5 years, the forecast
for oil prices is expected to be “erratic,”
the report said, but “generally lower in
2007 as oil demand growth is forced
down by higher oil prices, as new nonOPEC production enters the market, and
as LNG and coal continue to replace oil
use in Asia along with modest amounts
of other alternative energy sources
everywhere.”
Oil prices are expected to escalate
from 2009, however, eventually leading
to more cost inflation. “But, not all cost
escalation can be ascribed to inflation,”
Smith said, adding, “Costs are also going up as more advanced rigs, production systems, and services are used for
deeper and more complex reservoirs
and more extreme conditions.”

The recent spending surge, said
Smith, was driven by a shortage of
spare oil and gas production capacity. “From 2002, prices significantly
increased for equipment, consumables,
and services, and this was especially
so in 2005 and 2006 as demand rose
and fuel costs escalated,” he said. “The

the offshore oil and gas sector over the
next 5 years, the report continued, “the
prime mover will be the less-alluring
operational sector.”
Smith said capital spending (capex)
has nearly doubled since 2002, with
most of the growth occurring in the last
2 years. This spending has been dominated by drilling and platforms. “But
hardly any capex growth is forecast for
the 5 years to 2011, although floating and subsea production solutions,
especially in deep waters, are likely to
continue to expand their shares,” Smith
said.
Conversely, he said, operational expenditures (opex) “will likely increase
by more than 50% to 2011 as a result
of increasing output and a higher share
of more expensive oil.” Last year, Smith
said, opex accounted for 40% of global
offshore spending, “but its share is forecast to begin rising again in 2007, and

by 2011 spending on capex and opex
could be approximately equal.”
Smith said this report is “unique” in
that it determines capex levels based on
“production additions.” He said, “Every
year new production comes on stream,
which both adds capacity and replaces
lost capacity as older fields deplete. The
expected volume of new production is
modeled using these two increments of
output—‘growth’ and ‘replacement’—
the sum of which corresponds to the
amount and cost of new capacity that is
added each year.”
He said, “Shallow-water production
additions are only forecast to increase
in the Middle East and will continue
to increase until at least 2010 as the
region strives to meet global oil and gas
demand. They are also increasing in the
Caspian Sea and Sakhalin.”
Deepwater production additions
meanwhile are increasing in all regions
where deepwater prospects exist, Smith

said. “In particular, additions in West Africa are expected to show considerable
growth, [while] deepwater oil additions
in Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico will
modestly decline towards the end of the
period” but will be supported by new
marketed gas production.

Constraints
Many sectors of the offshore industry up to 2011 will continue to be
constrained by shortages of equipment
and people resources, the report said.
“Consequently, day rates will remain
high, especially for capital assets such
as high-specification drilling rigs and
other vessels,” the report said. “The experienced personnel needed to design,
build, and operate drilling and production equipment will also command a
growing premium.”
Starting to enter the market, however
are new, high-specification rigs and
vessels, which are serving to moder-

This trend is driven by the everincreasing need for spatial density of
energy consumption by the end-user,
that is, the energy consumed per square
meter, especially in urban areas.
“Fuels must conform to what the
end-user will accept, and constraints
become more stringent as spatial density of consumption rises,” he said.

scale of destruction that hydro, biomass,
wind, and solar promise is to denominate each in watts per square meter that
the source would produce. In a well-watered area like Ontario, Canada, a square
kilometer produces enough hydroelectricity for about 12 Canadians, while
severely damaging life in its rivers,”
Ausubel said. “A biomass power plant
requires about 2,500 sq km of prime
Iowa farmland to equal the output of a
single 1,000-Mw nuclear plant on a few
hectares. Windmills to equal the same
nuclear plant cover about 800 sq km in a

very favorable climate,” he said.
“Photovoltaics require less, but
still a carpet of 150 sq km to match
the nuclear plant. And a car requires
a pasture of a hectare or two to run
on biofuels—unwise, as the world’s
vehicle population heads towards
one billion.” Ausubel concluded, “No
economies of scale adhere to any of the
solar and renewable sources, so trying
to supply India or eastern China would
require increases in infrastructure
that would overwhelm these already
crowded lands.” ✦

Problems for European reﬁners
seen in EC sulfur-cut proposals
European refiners face new investment requirements at a difficult time,
warns the International Energy Agency.

48

A Jan. 31 proposal of the European
Commission on fuel quality would
impose new sulfur specifications in a
relatively short period and necessitate
investment in hydrotreating, hydrocracking, and hydrogen production
capacity, IEA says in its April Oil Market
Report.
The move comes while “anecdotal
evidence suggests refinery reliability is
deteriorating due to existing sulfur-removal requirements, lowering average utilization rates,” the agency says.
Regulations are limiting sulfur content
of gasoline, diesel fuel, and other distillates, or gas oil.
The EC’s proposal would:
• Confirm the mandatory date for a
10 ppm sulfur limit in diesel as 2009.
• Reduce to 8% the maximum
polyaromatic hydrocarbon content of
diesel, beginning in 2009.
• Cut maximum sulfur content of
nonroad gas oil to 10 ppm from 1,000
ppm for land uses and to 300 ppm
from 1,000 ppm for inland waterways.
• Increase the allowable oxygenate
content of gasoline to encourage use of
biofuels, including gasoline containing
as much as 10% ethanol, and increase
the vapor-pressure limit of gasoline to
accommodate ethanol.

• Require refiners to monitor greenhouse gas emissions and to cut emissions of greenhouse gases by 1%/year
beginning in 2011.
• Adjust vapor-pressure standards to
encourage development of a biofuels
industry.

Desulfurization hike
The EC proposal responds to requirements in the European Union for
greenhouse-gas emission cuts and for
a 10% biofuel share of the transportation-fuels market by 2020.
IEA notes discussions about displacement of fuel oil by distillate in marine
bunkers and points out that Germany
soon will cap the sulfur content of heating oil at 50 ppm.
“The changes to gas oil specifications
in Europe would effectively increase
European desulfurization requirements
by 50%,” it says.
Refiners would have to increase
high-severity hydrotreating or hydrocracking of high-sulfur gas oil from
cokers and catalytic crackers.
“These processes involve significant
amounts of hydrogen and energy, neither of which is inexpensive or without
significant greenhouse-gas emissions,”
IEA notes.
Under current regulations, refiners
are increasing the frequency of maintenance shutdowns to keep hydrotreaters
able to meet product specifications. Operation of the units at high severity and
high capacity utilization has increased
failure rates.
Hydrotreating problems can lower
overall throughputs temporarily
because refiners have less spare hydrotreating capacity than before new
sulfur limits took effect and fewer outlets for off-specification product.
Refiners also are less able than before
to perform partial turnarounds.
While the proposed changes would
further lower sulfur levels in gas oil, IEA
says, “they could have far-reaching and
possibly unintended consequences in
terms of reduced product supply and
higher greenhouse-gas emissions.” ✦

The world is consuming oil at a
rate that will result in oil production
peaking in 15 to 25 years, a group of
geoscientists told the American Association of Petroleum Geologists’ annual
convention in Long Beach, Calif.
When world oil production reaches
the peak by 2020-40, the rate will be
90-100 million b/d, only 10-20%
higher than it was in 2005. Depending on the level of
world oil resources, which is
highly uncertain,
that peak is likely
to last 20-30 years
before production
begins its ultimate
decline.
The estimates are released for the
first time following an AAPG Hedberg
Research Conference on Understanding
World Oil Resources held in November
2006 in Colorado Springs.
Richard Nehring, chairman of that
conference, said present estimates
of conventional and unconventional
world oil resources range from 3.4 to 5
trillion bbl. “These estimates of technologically and economically feasible
world oil potential fall in the optimistic
range of published estimates of world
oil resources,” Nehring said.
The world took more than 140 years
to consume the first trillion barrels
produced since the Drake well in Pennsylvania in 1859. Consumption of the
second trillion barrels will occur within
only 30 years.
Additions to world oil resources
will come from three sources: recovery
growth, undiscovered, and unconventional.
Recovery growth from existing
fields, not discoveries, has been the major contributor to world oil production
in the last 25 years. Growth in recovery
from existing fields is also likely to be
the largest source of future additions to
world oil supply.
Worldwide, about 300 billion bbl of
known oil, or about a 10-year supply, is

either being developed or planned for
future development.
About 50% of the world’s oil has
characteristics acceptable for enhanced
oil recovery application, but EOR is
currently applied to about 11%. More
intensive development, either through
tighter well spacing or the extensive use
of horizontal and multilateral wells, also
promises to increase recovery.
Extrapolating past trends of recovery
growth from existing fields adds about
1 trillion bbl to the overall ultimate
production expectation, about 200
billion bbl of which would come from
EOR.
Undiscovered resources are the best
understood source of future additions.
They are the most thoroughly studied, a
study that increasingly has strong theoretical support.
Worldwide estimates of undiscovered oil resources presented at the AAPG
Convention, drawn from an augmented
version of the USGS Worldwide Assessment, range from 480 to 1,550 billion
bbl.
Nine geologic provinces (each with
a mean estimate of 25 billion bbl or
more) account for 65% of the mean
world estimate.
Given the locations of the undiscovered potential, most is 15-40 years
away from initial production.
Unconventional resources—tar sands
and extra-heavy oil, oil shale, and oil
from mature source rocks—provide
a massive in-place resource. Each is
known to have at least 3-4 trillion bbl.
The problem with these unconventional resources is recoverability. Each
faces a major challenge, whether poor
quality oil (extra-heavy oil), poor quality reservoirs (oil from source rocks),
or both (oil shale).
Production of extra heavy oils and
oil shale also requires substantial energy, enough so that oil shale production may be severely constrained by
being mostly uneconomic due to a low
net energy gain.
The 75 Hedberg conference participants came from 18 countries on all six
populated continents. ✦

pendence project in the
eastern Gulf of Mexico.
Anadarko Petroleum Corp. operates
the project that will bring on line 1
bcf/day of previously stranded gas.
The $2 billion project, scheduled to
begin production in fall 2007, will tie
together 10 gas fields in record-setting
water depths of 8,000-9,000 ft (Fig. 1).
These fields would be uneconomical
to develop on a standalone basis (OGJ,

O D U C T I O N

Nov. 27, 2006, p. 43).
The project’s production will add
about 2% to the US supply of natural
gas and account for about 10% of the
natural gas produced from the Gulf of
Mexico.

To reduce installation time, Anadarko
became the first operating company
successfully to pre-assemble and test
90-ft plus completion assemblies and
install them as a single unit rather than
multiple components.
Anadarko and Baker Oil Tools devoted 18 months to project planning
that involved equipment design, as well
as designing and implementing lifting
and transportation devices. This work
thus far has enabled five successful intelligent well completions in four fields,
while saving 12-14 hr of rig time/installation.
Fewer connections and pre-assembling and testing in controlled shop
conditions away from the rig have
improved reliability and assembly integrity, as well as reduced risk.

Extending technology
The Independence project is one of
the industry’s most ambitious attempts
to extend the limits of production technology. The fields are in deeper water
than any other offshore development,
and they will produce through a floating production system, subsea tieback,
and pipelines installed in the deepest
water to date.
The subsea umbilicals will contain
about 1,100 miles of steel tubing, and
flowlines will exceed 200 miles in
length.
Flow-assurance measures will include chemical injection to control paraffin and scale, with hydrates controlled
from subsea trees. Subsea wells will be
frac-packed for sand management and
production optimization.
For Anadarko and its partners
(Dominion Exploration & Production, Devon Energy Corp., Murphy Oil
Corp., and Hydro Gulf of Mexico),
water depths and subsea infrastructure
required team members to reach new
levels of collaboration and technical
innovation. The project complexity was
heightened by the fact that the development involved contracts with several
different service companies rather than
a single vendor.

Completion design
Spiderman field will be one of the
first to come on stream, in fall 2007.
The dynamically positioned Transocean Deepwater Millennium drillship
drilled and completed the wells in
Spiderman.
The operator based the well completion design on the need to remotely
control two frac-packed zones, produce
the zones sequentially, monitor downhole conditions, and provide flow assurance. In addition, reducing rig time
and ensuring reliability and safety were
other critical needs for optimizing the
installation.
The selection of the InForce intelligent well system (IWS) was based on
its functionality, inherent simplicity, and
proven reliability. The selected intelligent control system (Fig. 2) includes:
• Two 41⁄2-in. flow control valves:
one shrouded to control flow from the
lower zone, and the other nonshrouded
to control the upper zone.
• A 97⁄8 × 41⁄2-in. feed-through removable production packer V0 (zero gas
leakage) rated as per ISO 14310.
• A splice sub above the packer to
house all control lines and cable splices.
The hydraulically operated control
valves are controlled from surface and
provide open-close functionality for
multizone applications. The system
includes a subsea control unit with
hydraulic control lines that operates a
balanced hydraulic piston for actuating the sliding insert in the valves. The
piston develops an axial load exceeding 15,000 lb in both upward and
downward directions to help overcome
debris and scale buildup.
The valves have a diffuser ring
system and equalizing slots that allow

dressing several concerns:
• Would it be possible to safely pick
up long assemblies on the single-activity drillship?
• Would it be possible to eliminate
bending and damage to intelligent well
components?
• Could components be tested on
deck prior to going in hole?
• Could logistics, such as transportation, be addressed satisfactorily?
Handling of the BHA required
compensating slings. To ensure the
functionality of these slings, the project
team developed proper procedures and
performed lift tests before shipping the
equipment offshore (Fig, 3). Finding
the balance point for the subassemblies
and rehearsing the process several times

The work also included building an

operations.
Another key complication addressed
during subassembly make-up was
the alignment of key components to

The situation
A major international operator
wanted to determine the value of
replacing three standard shaker
units with two M-I SWACO*
MONGOOSE* PT shakers. An
online test while drilling compared flow capacity, cuttings
dryness and time savings.

Onshore Argentina:

Two MONGOOSE PT
shakers outperform
three standard units;
screen usage drops
from 45 to 4
The solution and results
M-I SWACO installed two MONGOOSE PT shakers over holding tanks on the operator’s land rig and connected them to a
manifold carrying fluid evenly to both shakers in the course of
drilling 15 wells. The MONGOOSE PT shakers successfully handled
the same circulating fluid volume as the three standard shakers:
140- to 250-mesh screens at flow rates of 450 to 460 GPM (1,703 to
1,741 L/min) and a drilling rate of 63.6 ft/hr (19.4 m/hr). Improved cuttings dryness (WOC) resulted in 8% waste reduction and 5,283 gal (20 m3)
per well of drilling mud saved — an average of $18,156 per well. The ability to convert the MONGOOSE PT shaker’s motion from linear to elliptical
helped reduce fluid loss by 8%, for an average mud-cost savings of $2,570. The
15-well program required only four screens, compared to the 45 screens consumed for the same number of wells drilled with the standard shakers. Screen
savings amounted to $17,835.

SAKHALIN RMR—1
This two-part series describes how
the riserless mud-recovery system was
implemented in a remote exploration
drilling operation off Sakhalin Island.
The first part covers project planning
and engineering. The concluding part,
to be published May 7, discusses the
RMR system installation and operation.
After the company’s Sakhalin experiences in 2004-05, a clear business case
emerged with the underlying drivers of
limited weather window, shallow gas,
and stringent discharge regulations.3
Accordingly, a formal project was
established and several critical riskreduction studies were carried out in
relation to shallow gas and integrity of
the return hose under high current conditions. Correct interfacing aboard the
rig required careful choice of location,
power supply, wellhead, and remotely
operated subsea vehicle. There, changes
were verified by means of a formal
hazard and operability review.
A significant part of the effort
involved gaining certification of the

diameter heavy-duty hose joined by
quick-connect couplings. The tensile
strength of the hose is enhanced with a
pair of load-bearing wires strung from
integral lugs on each connector.
A special hose coupling and
load-bearing wires enable efficient
deployment and retrieval of the mudrecovery line. A remotely operated
vehicle-friendly connector connects
the recovery line to the pump module.
The recovery-hose handling platform
(Fig. 3) includes a safe handling system
for deployment and retrieval of the
recovery hose and a hang-off shoulder
to take the weight of the recovery hose
during operations. Hard piping connects the return hose landing platform
manifold to the shale shaker header
box.
5. Control containers and power supply. Two
purpose-built containers (Fig. 4) were
installed. One pressurized unit is a crew
work area and operator workstation.
The second pressurized unit contains
the variable speed drive, transformer,
filter, and control system to provide
the interface between the rig and the
system. A 3-kv transformer provides the
high voltages to enable cable sizes to be
optimized.
The container is the hub to which
all control systems are interfaced. The
control system monitors pump speed
and pressures and also monitors and
maintains a stable mud level in the wellhead suction module. The containers are
fabricated to Norsok Z-015 and DNV
2.7.1 standards.
6. Control system. The control system

controls the speed of the pump motor
to keep the mud level below the top of
the wellhead suction module, thus preventing escape of fluids to the sea. The
control system is distributed between
the control container and the subsea
pump module. The system is controlled
from a dedicated explosion-proof computer in the driller’s cabin.

7. Shutdown system. Emergency shutdown elements are part of the control
system. The system was configured with
two shutdown buttons, one on the drill
floor, the other in the control container.

projects. Experience repeatedly demonstrates the benefits of a careful review of
options and assessment of risks in the
early stages of a project. Accordingly,
the Sakhalin RMR project was broken
into five steps with a formal “stage
gate” review required before the project
could progress to the next step.
• Appraise. The objective of this stage
74

was to assess the feasibility of the
concept. A review of available literature
pointed to a candidate system. Discussions with the manufacturer suggested
that a system could be developed and
mobilized to commence operations in
June 2006. A high-level risk assessment
was carried out, a preliminary schedule
prepared, and cost estimate developed.

Special Report

Further work showed that the risks
could be overcome and a system delivered within the required timeframe.
This plan was networked with other
business units and technical specialists who endorsed the viability of the
project in June 2005. Funding was
approved to carry out the necessary
risk-reduction studies.
• Select. The purpose of this stage
was to develop sufficient confidence
in the concept to allow a commitment
to be made to proceed with detailed
engineering design and then, potentially, to full-scale system procurement
and mobilization. Building on the risk
assessment, planners visited the rig and
carried out a series of preliminary risk
reduction studies, specifically in relation to shallow gas and integrity of the
recovery hose in the high currents.
During this phase, regular contact
was maintained with another BP business unit employing the system as part
of a template drilling operation in the
Caspian Sea. An outline design of the
system was developed with input of
actual rig data, actual environmental
data, and a rigorous input of operational procedures based on likely well
designs. The output from this stage was
a frozen design that demonstrated how
the major risks were to be mitigated,
how the system eliminated the need for
pilot hole, and what effect it had on the
chosen waste-handling method.
A detailed execution plan, budget,
and commercial proposal were prepared and externally reviewed and
approved in August 2005. At this stage
the concept was de-risked to the point
that funding for long-lead procurement
items was approved.
• Define. The purpose of this stage
was to develop a detailed design and
specification of the system in order to
proceed with manufacturing, certification, and installation. Given the schedule, it was necessary to identify and
order long-lead items before the design
freeze. The work to date had been carried out under a study contract, thus an
agreement for the operational phase had
to be developed.

2006.
• Execute. The object of this phase was
to deliver a working system to the rig
in Busan, South Korea. It was necessary
to procure the equipment, fabricate,
and commission the system in Norway before disassembly and shipment
to South Korea. Once in South Korea,
in May 2006, the system was installed
aboard the rig and commissioned.
Detailed procedures for deployment
and operation were developed and
integrated with the main drilling operations plans for the wells. At this point,
the RMR system was handed over to the
well operations team.
• Operate. Use procedures for drilling operations, evaluate performance,
capture lessons learned, and plan for
next season.
• Project organization. Personnel in the
UK coordinated the technical risk-reduction studies and contracting activities, but overall program administration and supervision was carried out
in Sakhalin. Special consultancies in
the UK and Norway performed the
risk-reduction studies. The contractor
in Bergen carried out the bulk of the
engineering activity.
Interfaces between drilling contractor, wellsite supervision, wellsite service
companies, and wellhead vendor were
critically important. They were managed through a series of meetings in
Singapore and South Korea. High-level
peer reviews took place in Sakhalin and
Houston.
• Key project risks. An initial high-level
project risk assessment, carried out during the appraisal stage, formed the basis
for a number of activities during the
remainder of the project. The key risks
and their mitigations were:
• Shallow gas: detailed engineering
analysis.
• Integrity of umbilical in high current conditions: detailed engineering
analysis.

We found a way to keep oil rigs drilling 10 times longer.
Will anyone else? Don’t hold your breath.

What problem can we solve for you? One drilling operation was tired of bringing up nothing but worn
bearings. So they asked us to extend the life of these critical components. Today they average 300 hours of
uninterrupted operation, up from just 30. Our metallurgical engineers can find similarly innovative solutions
to the problems you’re facing, then deploy and support them globally. Find out more at kennametal.com.

Special Report

anticipated during drilling of top-hole sections. Calculations
indicated that breaching of the hose liner was unlikely to occur before 1,000 hr of circulation at maximum pump rates.
As the operation period was estimated to last some 2-5 days
(100 hr maximum), this risk was considered negligible.
Concern was also expressed about the possibility of the
hose kinking while in service. Kinking would not lead to
damage of the hose, but simply a blockage of the recovery
hose. Therefore, this was regarded as matter to be addressed
through operational procedures as opposed to being an issue
of fundamental technical integrity.
The possibility of gas entering the pump and recovery hose during a shallow gas blowout was evaluated even
though the dual-gradient nature of the system, with the
ability to control mud weight, makes it almost impossible for
conditions to develop under which an influx can occur.
The Norwegian technology company, SINTEF, had already
carried out some general scoping studies of this problem as
part of the initial system development.5 SINTEF carried out
a further, more detailed study using input data specifically
related to the well design, hole sizes, mud properties, operational procedures, and anticipated geological conditions. The
results of the analysis showed that:
1. Use of the system in conjunction with a suitably
weighted drilling fluid would greatly reduce the likelihood
of a gas kick because of the “dual-gradient” behavior of the
system.
2. With a conventional influx volume of 3 cu m (20 bbl)
as the detection threshold, kick detection is possible before
gas reached the wellhead for all the kick scenarios and hole
size combinations likely to be encountered.
3. Subsea pump power consumption is a sensitive method of detecting an influx. Fig. 5 illustrates the case of a 26-in.
hole, in which it takes 2 min for the influx volume to reach
3 cu m, by which time the power demand has increased by
a factor of 3. The control system is set to trip out following
a 10% increase in power, in this case triggering a kick alarm
within 15 sec.
4. With kick development times ranging from 30 to 300
sec, ensuring no gas is taken into the pump and recovery
hose demands a high degree of alertness and prompt action
by the crew. The most rapid influx times were associated with
pilot-hole configurations.
Further details of Elvary Neftegaz’s work with a riserless
mud recovery system off Sakhalin will be published in the
concluding part of this series. ✦

Lower operating cost makes Mesabi
the right engine cooling solution.
Value-conscious drilling, well-service and geophysical
contractors know that when downtime, repair expense
and lost revenue are included in the cost equation, a
"cheap" radiator can be very expensive. That’s why a
Mesabi radiator is the most economical engine cooling
solution.
ENGINEERED QUALITY Each Mesabi radiator is
engineered to meet exact cooling specifications and
fit a specific physical layout. Built to ISO standards,
every Mesabi radiator also inherits lessons learned
from thousands of field tests.
NO SOLDERED SEAMS Mesabi’s unique design
absorbs shock, vibration, and thermal expansion by
mounting individual tubes in headers with flexible
rubber seals. There are no soldered seams to crack
and leak, or corrode.
EASY FIELD REPAIR When accidents happen, damaged tubes can be
replaced using simple hand tools without removing the radiator.
A BETTER BOTTOM LINE A Mesabi radiator’s long, trouble-free service
life means continual operating savings on every retrofit or OEM application.

In this article, we have
updated and extended
the refinery investment
cost curves presented in
Gary and Handwerk’s
“Petroleum Refining:
Refining
Technology and Economics.”1 2 This article presents the methodological framework,
data sources, and normalization procedures used for cost estimation,
along with a discussion of the
limitations of analysis.
Cost functions are summarized for the main refinery
processes.

The best public sources of information for cost data are technical articles
found in OGJ and other trade publications, material presented at such professional conferences as National Petrochemical and Refining Association’s
annual meeting, and industry studies.
Robert Meyer’s “Handbook of Petroleum Refining Processes” is an excellent
source of process and economic data for
a wide compendium of technologies.
Maples, Raseev, Sadeghbeigi, and various other texts provide cost estimates
for mid-1990 and earlier configurations

For some units, it is not possible
to develop useful curves from its feed
capacity, while in other cases, if a large
number of factors influence the design
parameters, unrealistic uncertainty
bounds may result. To manage these
issues we frequently cross-correlated
cost data, based on two or more process
descriptors, and in cases where data
were extremely sparse, (unit) cost data
on a per-barrel basis are presented.

Analysis limitations

differences, market conditions, vendor
profit, and other considerations. The
cost curves can be assumed to have an
accuracy limited to ±25%.
Working capital, inventories, start-up
expense, the cost of land, site preparation, taxes, licenses, permits and duties
are not considered in the estimation.
The cost curves that we established are
inappropriate for benchmarking studies.
The level of uncertainty in estimation can be reduced through a detailed
front-end engineering design based on
site-specific information. For definitive
economic comparisons and estimations,
other factors such as feedstock, production specification, operating conditions,
design options, and technology options
must be considered.

Utility requirements
Utility requirements for each process
are usually presented on a per-barrel
unit feed or product basis and correspond to average characteristics
associated with the mid-point of the
construction cost curve. Wide variability
in utility values can result, depending
upon the capacity of the unit and other
process-specific factors.

data.

that IHUB had been successfully installed and had started earning demand
revenues. Independence Hub LLC, a
venture of Enterprise Field Services
LLC (80%) and Helix Energy Solutions
(20%), owns IHUB. Anadarko Petroleum Corp. will operate processing
on the hub on behalf of the gas field
owners that include Anadarko, Dominion Exploration & Production, Devon
Energy Corp., Hydro Gulf of Mexico,
and Murphy Oil Corp. Production from
the fields served by IHUB is to begin in
second-half 2007.
IHUB is the deepest offshore platform ever installed and, at 1 bcfd, also
has the largest production capacity,
representing a 10% increase in current
natural gas deliveries from the Gulf, according to Heerema.
The Independence Trail Natural Gas
Pipeline is a wholly owned affiliate of
Enterprise Products Partners LP. The 134
mile, 24-in. pipeline connects Independence Hub to an interconnect with
Tennessee Gas Pipeline on West Delta
Block 68 (Fig. 1).
Allseas Solitaire completed S-lay of
the pipeline in August 2006.
The pipeline has a maximum operating pressure of 3,640 psi and a capacity
of 1 bcfd. It has two subsea dual tees
of 16-in. and 12-in. in water depths of
about 6,500 and 4,500 ft, respectively,
for future tie ins.
The 24-in. line consists of API 5L
X-65 DSAW (double submerged arc
welded) pipe coated with 14-16 mils
thin film fusion-bonded epoxy (FBE)
and an additional 2-3 mils rough coat
FBE (OGJ, Nov. 27, 2006, p. 43).
The export SCR has a 1.21-in. WT,
9,000 ft of vortex induced vibration
strakes, a dry recovery weight of 460
tonnes, and a wet recovery weight of
900 tonnes.

Built as semisubmersible crane vessel
in 1978, Balder completed conversion
into a Class III dynamic positioning
system DCV in 2001.
Balder has an overall length of 522
ft, overall breadth of 371 ft, and gross
tonnage of 48,511 tons. Its Class III DPS
produces 350 tonnes thrust using nine
thrusters (2 × 4,400 kw, controllable
pitch; 7 × 3,500 kw, 360° azimuth)

with seven independent engine rooms.
The system can be operated manually, via joystick, autopilot, or in full
dynamic-positiong mode. Special DP
functions include:
• Track follow.
• Heavy lift.
• Follow floating object.
• External force compensation.
• Pipelay.

Equipment
Heerema used its Deepwater Construction Vessel (DCV) Balder for the
IHUB installation. This section focuses
on equipment Balder used while installing the export SCR.

Balder also features:
• Two heavylift cranes with a
combined capacity
of 6,300 tonnes at
110-ft radius. The
starboard crane includes two traction

Enhanced diamond protection offered for drillbits
This drillbit supplier has expanded its
offering of enhanced diamond protection
for customers drilling with the company’s
roller cone products.
Because of higher drilling rig costs and
increased extended reach applications,
more diamonds are being used to improve
roller cone bit life, the firm notes, adding
that the company customizes the bit to the
specific application; e.g., builds sections in
directional drilling and horizontal applications where maximum abrasive resistance is required. The objective is to keep
the cutting structure sharper for better
penetration rates and maintain gauge for
longer on-bottom time.
Diamond protection occurs during the
manufacturing process of the bit, when
polycrystalline diamond capped inserts
are inserted along the gauge, back row,
and-or the leading edge of the shirttails
to provide added protection to the bit in

abrasive formations. Diamond protection is
recommended on motor, directional, and
rotary steerable applications, particularly
those drilling through abrasive formations
such as sandstone, siltstone, granite, and
limestone.
These diamond protection options are
offered:
• Enhanced back row increases gauge holding in abrasive applications—available in
varying percentages.
• Enhanced gauge row maximizes 100%
of gauge rows and provides longer gauge
hold in abrasive and directional uses.
• Enhanced shirttail protection provides wear
resistance in extreme drilling environments.
Enhanced diamond protection packages are available on Challenger tungsten
carbide insert bits and steel tooth bits.

World Bank chief
loses ground in
corruption ﬁght
To the oil and gas industry’s detriment,
World Bank Pres. Paul Wolfowitz has sustained a blow likely to destroy his effectiveness in a crucial ﬁght.
Normally, Wolfowitz can take a punch.
Before moving to the World Bank in 2005,
the former university professor and longtime federal ofﬁcial was deputy defense
secretary in the administration of President
George W. Bush. Because he helped plan

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e

the invasion of Iraq, the president’s political
antagonists regularly depict Wolfowitz as a
demon.
Political pressure followed him to the
World Bank, where he is said to have
angered much of the staff for imposing
change and exercising an apparently unbeloved style of management.
He also irked staffers and many governments by acting on his conviction that the
bank can’t ﬁght poverty without also ﬁghting corruption (OGJ, Dec. 18, 2006, p. 19).
That position deserves the oil and gas
industry’s full support. Expatriate companies need their presence to beneﬁt
host-country populations. Where corruption
dissipates wealth generated by resource
development, the popular welcome of
resource developers suffers. It’s Wolfowitz’s
commendable and controversial stance
against corruption that now teeters.
The World Bank chief acknowledges
that he participated in negotiations that
helped a former bank worker with whom
he is romantically involved make a lucrative
transfer to the State Department.
The move occurred because Wolfowitz
properly raised concerns about the conﬂict
of interest that developed when he became
World Bank president while the woman was
a bank employee. To some extent, though,
he involved himself in dealings that ﬁnancially beneﬁted his girlfriend.
That’s enough to have agitated his detractors at the World Bank, who by Apr. 12
were calling for his resignation. Opponents
of Bush, especially of his policies on Iraq,
will see political opportunity in Wolfowitz’s
troubles. The biggest question, however,
should be whether the World Bank chief can
effectively pursue his already beleaguered
campaign against corruption after these
disclosures.
Seriousness of the offense doesn’t matter. The indiscretion will make it impossible
for the World Bank president to confront
corrupt governments effectively.
Wolfowitz should recognize how seriously his potency in an important campaign
has been hurt and act accordingly.

Supply outlook pressures prices
Energy prices ﬂuctuated Apr. 9-13 with fast-paced changes in US inventories and
political threats to Middle East crude supplies.
The May contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes fell $2.77 to $61.51/bbl
Apr. 9 on the New York Mercantile Exchange following Iran’s release of 15 UK sailors
and marines. It was the biggest price reduction for a front-month crude contract in 3
months. Yet an Apr. 10 rally in gasoline and heating oil boosted May crude to $61.89/
bbl for its ﬁrst gain in ﬁve sessions on NYMEX. The price inched up to $62.01/bbl Apr.
11 as US gasoline stocks fell for the 9th consecutive week, plunging 5.5 million bbl to
a below-average level of 333.4 million bbl during the week ended Apr. 6, the lowest
level since 2001. The crude price escalated to $63.85/bbl Apr. 12 on evidence that US
gasoline inventories had gone from adequate to tight in less than a month. It slipped
to $63.63/bbl Apr. 13, resulting in roughly a 1% loss in volatile trading that week.
“The US gasoline crack is taking back its driving position. Demand is holding well.
Geopolitics moved to the back seat,” said analysts at the Société Générale Group in
an Apr. 16 report. Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
won’t increase supply until crude prices climb above $70/bbl, said Société Générale.
Analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc. said, “It is
not often that a single reﬁnery outage has a material impact on the US oil market,
but that is precisely what has happened in the wake of the ﬁre at the Sunray, Tex.,
reﬁnery. The temporary glut of crude oil at Cushing, Okla., has kept the price of West
Texas Intermediate stagnant year-to-date, even as global oil prices surged higher.”
Valero Energy Corp.’s 158,000 b/d Sunray reﬁnery in the Texas Panhandle is expected
to restart this month. Once that happens, Raymond James analysts said, “We believe that WTI prices could rise by up to 10% within the next 6 weeks.”
Raymond James analysts said reﬁnery shutdowns have led to a build-up of crude
oil in inventory and depressed WTI prices compared with Brent Sea crude prices on
the London Stock Exchange. “Iran remains a catalyst for high oil prices, however. The
country asserts it is enriching uranium on an industrial scale in deﬁance of global
sanctions,” they said.
Reﬁnery problems in the Midwest helped inﬂate the local stock build, while
Canadian crude exports to the same area made market prices for WTI “incredibly
weak” vs. North Sea Brent crude. The primary problem, said Société Générale was
“not enough crude on the Atlantic Basin and too much in Cushing.” Crude supplies
in Cushing surged by 12% in the week ended Mar. 30.
Gasoline inventories
With the ofﬁcial the start of the summer driving season approaching on May 28,
Société Générale analysts were expecting the ﬁrst seasonal build of gasoline stocks
after an “unrealistic” draw of 5 million bbl to 205.2 million bbl during the week
ended Mar. 30. Instead, the Energy Information Administration reported Apr. 11 that
US gasoline stocks fell for the ninth consecutive week, plunging 5.5 million bbl to a
below-average level of 333.4 million bbl during the week ended Apr. 6, the lowest
level since 2001.
Commercial US crude inventories increased by 700,000 bbl to 333.4 million bbl
during the same period, well below the jump some analysts had expected in the
face of recent reﬁning outages. Distillate fuel inventories inched up just 100,000 bbl
to 118.1 million bbl, with a modest gain in diesel offsetting a drop in heating oil.
Propane and propylene inventories rose 700,000 bbl to 25.8 million bbl in the same
week.
Imports of crude into the US fell 441,000 b/d to 9.8 million b/d during that period.
However, the input of crude into US reﬁneries increased by 231,000 b/d to 15.1 million b/d, with units operating at 88.4% of capacity. Gasoline production declined to
8.5 million b/d while distillate fuel production increased to 4.2 million b/d.
The International Energy Agency in Paris said Apr. 12 that inventories of crude
and petroleum products among member countries of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development fell by 80 million bbl in February due to seasonal
reﬁnery maintenance in North America.
IEA estimated that members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (excluding Iraq and Angola) reduced their total production by 200,000 b/d to
26.5 million b/d in March. That was 1.2 million b/d below September 2006 levels and
contributed to declining crude stocks. EIA revised its 2007 “call-on-OPEC” down by
200,000 b/d to 31.5 million b/d.

Subsea sector facing challenges
amid booming demand

ubsea oil and natural gas ﬁeld development has mushroomed in
size from its status just a few years ago as a minor niche in the
offshore industry to a major market category in its own right.
The numbers tell the story, according to London-based
analysis group Inﬁeld Systems Ltd. Inﬁeld forecasts that worldwide
capital spending on subsea systems will explode to $44.6 billion by
2010. That represents a 94% increase from 2005 levels.
Inﬁeld estimates that subsea spending will rocket to $16.5 billion
in Africa from $5 billion in 2005 and to $15.8 billion in the Americas,
a rise of 58% in the same timeframe. In Asia and Australia, subsea
outlays are expected to jump to almost $5 billion in 2010 from $1 billion in 2005. In Europe, spending on subsea installations will remain
steady at $6.9 billion.
Inﬁeld predicts that a total of 2,060 subsea wells will be installed
during 2006–10, compared with 1,204 such wells in 2005.
The drivers are a frantic search for new hydrocarbon plays by major oil companies plunging into ever-deeper waters and advances in
technology that are enabling drilling and production in water depths
that were unassailable just a decade or so ago.

in 2007, with independents responsible for 29% and NOCs 3%. What
happened in the intervening 5 years was a surprise to Inﬁeld: During
2002–07, independent operators accounted 52% of the deepwater
wells brought on stream in the gulf vs. 44% for majors.
The subsea story is one of technology advances, and more are
needed as plays move further into ultradeep waters and into deep
waters of the Arctic.
Meeting those technology challenges will be an industry already
constrained by rising costs and shortages of qualiﬁed personnel.
In addition, heightened concern over the fragility of ocean
ecosystems has service and supply companies pursuing new
technological innovations to ensure subsea installations are
environmentally friendly.

Cost issues

The specialized nature of subsea operations is a contributing factor to the high costs affecting that industry sector today, says Jarl
Kosberg, senior vice-president of trees/processing and boosting for
Aker Kvaerner.
“The subsea sector has perhaps
experienced higher inﬂation rates in

“Furthermore, the pool of niche

Costs will continue to rise as demand increases for more sophiserators as well. Once mainly the arena of international oil companies

and improved technologies,” he says. “The new technologies strive
to improve productivity and project economics.
“However, mature solutions are available that use proven equipment and processes that are available for lower cost than the latest hardware or processes. For projects, and operators, that utilize
these lower-cost solutions, costs can be reined in to some degree.
But another major cost contributor is the cost of rigs to drill and
complete the wells and vessels to perform marine installation and
construction. New construction activities are under way, or planned,
to increase the ﬂeets’ sizes, and cost is tied to demand—and a ﬁxed
supply. Current utilization rates are high—and costs are also high.
When the newbuilds arrive, there may be some softening of prices,
but that is yet to be seen.”

In the end, cost inﬂation will subside as victim of its
own “success.”
B.K. Chin, CEO of Global Industries Ltd., contends that “it is likely
to be a few years before prices in the subsea world stabilize at a
more normal level. The only thing likely to curtail the present inﬂation in subsea equipment and contracting is deferring major projects,
which may occur naturally as costs increase and deliveries slide.”
Chin adds, “One action that could reduce cost to the industry in the
near term would be for oil companies to work cooperatively with
suppliers and contractors, sharing schedule information and compromising to allow the best use of available manufacturing and installation equipment and personnel.”

Manpower/capacity concerns
The subsea service and supply sector continues to scramble to meet
operators’ needs as it copes with
shortages of manpower and manufacturing capacity.
“Attracting and keeping qualiﬁed
personnel is the most difﬁcult aspect
to address for the subsea service and
supply industry,” says Carter. “Manufacturing solutions will continue to evolve

Flow assurance tops subsea
technology challenges

T

he game-changing technologies for subsea installations today center on such challenges as ﬂow assurance, high temperatures and pressures, and control
and communications.
Service and supply companies must address these challenges in a way that is both economic and environmentally friendly.

Flow assurance
As industry continues to move into ever-deeper waters, subsea
operators continue to grapple with ﬂow assurance concerns
posed by hydrate formation and wax and scale deposition.
“The industry continues to improve our capability to analyze
ﬂow assurance from a producing reservoir to surface facilities,”
says Bruce Crager, president and CEO of Intec Engineering.
“This has allowed us to minimize operational problems and to
properly design pipelines and other key systems, particularly for
difﬁcult or unusual reservoirs. The development of hydrate inhibition technologies such as chemical inhibitors, novel techniques
such as cold ﬂow, and electric ﬂowline heating will enable very
long offsets.”
Software solutions are now available to optimize production
across a multiwell network, predict hydrate formation, measure
multiphase ﬂow, and control slugging, notes Dave Lamont, president, Eastern Region & Subsea for VetcoGray, a GE Oil & Gas
business. (In January GE agreed to acquire VetcoGray from investor groups Candover, 3i, and JP Morgan Partners for $1.9 billion.). Other software applications are condition monitoring and
the introduction of planned maintenance to the subsea world,
he adds.
VetcoGray’s Cold Flow technology is an enabling technology
for long step-out oil ﬁeld developments, Lamont points out. It entails cooling the well stream to form tiny hydrate particles from
the associated gas and water before they enter the pipeline; the
hydrate then ﬂows with the oil in a three-phase ﬂow together
with eventual surplus gas, from wellhead to production site.
For gas systems, Lamont contends that methods for controlling hydrates are available and economically viable, and the technology for recycling hydrate inhibitors is available and reliable.
It’s a different matter for long step-out oil developments,
because the production threats go beyond hydrate formation,
Lamont says.
“The methods for controlling hydrates are available and eco| April 23, 2007 | Technology Forum |

nomically viable but not 100% ﬁeld-proven for this application
(subsea separation with back-up chemicals); the use of chemical
technology for wax and scale deposition is available but expensive in this application; and the use of thermodynamic technology
for wax and scale suspension is available but not ﬁeld-proven.”
For second-generation multiphase ﬂowmeters (MPFM) , the
solution is simple, assures Lamont: “Move the computations
back to the surface, dumb down the device, and increase reliability by allowing for back-up sensors. The MPFM becomes just
another part of a VFM (a ‘virtual’ ﬂowmeter).”
FMC Technologies developed an innovative ﬂow assurance
solution for Ormen Lange, Europe’s deepest subsea development, operated by Shell Norway. An especially daunting hurdle
was ﬂow assurance in the project’s long pipelines, given that the
subzero temperatures on the seabed made hydrate formation
and icing a constant threat. In addition, the seabed itself is an
irregular mix of rocks and soft clay, creating low spots in the gas
pipelines that tend to trap liquids that accumulate and freeze.
In response to the challenge, FMC integrated three ﬂow
assurance systems based on its FlowManager real-time ﬂowmanagement software and provides continuous monitoring of
Ormen Lange’s critical production variables.
Continued, improved conﬁdence in two-phase ﬂow analysis
will reduce the contingencies designed into today’s subsea systems, according to B.K. Chin, CEO, Global Industries Ltd.: “This
will allow conﬁdent selection of the most economic method of
solids control for a particular system.
“For the hub-and-spoke development and on long subsea tiebacks, ﬂow assurance issues, along with subsea pigging, will be
an issue to contend with. There are several design options available to the operator today to mitigate the potential ﬂow assurance issues. These include passive systems such as insulated
pipe and pipe-in-pipe solutions, as well as active systems such
as DEH (direct electrically heated) pipe and chemical injection.”

Long tiebacks
Industry continues to push the envelope on technology for long
tiebacks, routinely setting new records for distance every year.
The pipeline and umbilical systems are commonly the key
considerations in terms of technology and economics for long
tiebacks, notes Jarl Kosberg, senior vice-president of trees/processing and boosting for Aker Kvaerner.

reservoir to surface facilities.”

Manifolds are becoming more sophisticated and ﬂexible,
notes Crager: “One of the key design aspects of these
systems is to try and envision future needs and make sure
the capability for future tie-ins is considered during the
design process.”
Kosberg contends that reliability and simple solutions have
always been the main drivers for manifolds and tie-in systems.
“In today’s market conditions, reducing installation vessel
time and moving away from heavy lift vessels are also important considerations,” he says. “In deep water, cost efﬁciency is
achieved by performing operations on the seabed rather than
having to move tooling and equipment between the seabed and
surface. Wet tow of manifolds is another example where vessel
cost is reduced.”
Large-bore (30 in. and more) connection systems for gas
trunkline systems and next-generation deepwater connection
systems are being developed with minimized support infrastructure, Lamont points out.
“Like other subsea equipment manifolds and connection
systems, these are being designed for HPHT [high-pressure/
high-temperature] applications,” he says. “Metal bellows
are being used for high piping ﬂexibility in manifolds and
jumper applications.”
Lamont also notes that manifolds are becoming more
intelligent with integrated HIPPS (High-Integrity Pipeline
Protection Systems) technology, for pressure protection of
export pipelines.
Improved multiphase meters and chemical distribution metering valves will increase the acceptability of comingling multiple
reservoirs to common subsea manifolds, contends Chin.
In addition, an improved understanding and detection of solids formation will lead to the development of simpler and more
reliable subsea pigging facilities, Chin says: “These will be serviced by free-ﬂying, construction-class autonomous underwater
vehicles operating from remote locations without the use of a
surface vessel.”

Control systems
Increased demand for sensor technologies and functionality of
the well, management of the subsea production system, and
new technology, such as boosting—“all these require increased

other solutions, such as ﬂoating power/control facilities located
near the subsea facility with control signals transmitted by satellite from the beach to this ﬂoating control facility. This will greatly
reduce the required length of power lines, subsea power systems, and umbilicals with the resulting cost in both [capital expenditure] and installation.”
Lamont concurs, noting that control systems are currently
being designed “to incorporate IWIS and SIIS for IP communications with subsea and downhole instrumentation. This is a move
towards commercially available communication protocols, which
reduces the risk of obsolescence associated with proprietary
technology. Other developments include ﬁber optical modems
running at 100 Mb/s, and the associated connectors. As the systems open up, a number of software solutions can add additional
value to the control system. These include ‘virtual’ ﬂow metering, optimization, and real-time asset management.”

Umbilicals
For production control umbilicals, “the electriﬁcation of subsea
systems will reduce the size, weight, and cost of the umbilical,”
Lamont points out. “The use of high-pressure hydraulic intensiﬁers on the seabed has already removed the need for a high-pressure hydraulic line in the same way.”
One interesting development is the use of integrated supply umbilicals (ISU) that might include larger ﬂow passages for
chemical injection or even for production, in addition to the power and control functions.
“This makes installation simpler, and it may reduce cost in
those cases where an ISU can replace the need for both the
ﬂowline and an umbilical,” says Crager. “The development and
application of all-electric control systems will reduce, but not
eliminate, the number of ﬂuid conduits required in umbilicals.”
Floating control facilities can signiﬁcantly reduce capital outlays for umbilicals and their related installation, Crager notes.
“There are ﬁve of these in the world, with the sixth currently
being installed,” he adds. “Combination power/control buoys
may also provide functional and cost advantages.”

“Further, the data can be entered into simulation software to
allow optimized production of a whole ﬁeld, taking into account
reservoir characteristics, dependency between wells, and pipeline and processing facility constraints.”
Lamont notes that using intelligent wells will increase
the need for hydraulic and electrical connections through the
subsea completion: “This in turn means more functionality
within the control system and increased bandwidth to exchange data and software.”

BP Drills Deepest
Oil Well in the World
Thank you to the following companies and their staff
who contributed to this signiﬁcant achievement.

BP’s Tiber discovery, situated approximately 250 miles offshore in the
Gulf of Mexico, reached a world record total vertical depth of 35,050 feet.
At almost seven miles below the sea surface, Tiber is the deepest well
drilled for hydrocarbons in the world. Each of these companies were
essential to the success of this record-breaking project.

COVER
Federal tax and legislative proposals could pose enough problems to
make many US independent producers lose sleep despite dramatically improved natural gas prospects in the Marcellus and other
tight shale plays. Many states’ officials also are looking for ways
to make up lost revenues and seem ready to seek higher oil and
gas taxes, while others remain more cautious. OGJ checked in
with several of them, as well as state and regional independents’
association executives, for its special report on Independent Operations starting on p. 20. Cover photo and above, both depicting a
Marcellus gas well, from National Fuel Gas.

BP identifies midstream assets to divest
BP PLC has identified 22 US properties for divestment in a midstream asset review aimed at bolstering profitability of its refining
and associated operations.
According to a company document, the review seeks to reduce operational flexibility of BP’s logistics infrastructure and “to
create a sustainable, long-term business for the fuel value chains
(FVCs) and [450,000-b/cd] Texas City refinery.”
FVCs, created in a 2008 refining and marketing reorganization, are regionally integrated refining, logistics, marketing, supply, and trading activities. BP has six of the groups worldwide,
two in the US.
According to the document, the asset review aims to “identify
the assets that create strategic sources of value as a direct benefit
of owning and operating the asset.”
Identified for divestment so far are crude and product pipelines,
pipeline interests, and terminals on the Gulf and West Coasts and
in the Midwest.
The document said BP at present has no plans to shut down
properties identified for divestment for which it finds no buyers.
In the past 2 years, the company has been selling companyowned, company-operated service stations in the US.
Profitability is under stress for all US refiners. For the third
quarter this year, BP reported a loss from US refining and marketing of $229 million on a replacement-cost basis before interest
and tax, compared to a profit of $338 million in third-quarter
2008. In this year’s second quarter, the loss was $326 million.
BP reported a third-quarter 2009 profit of $1.145 billion from
non-US refining and marketing, compared with $1.634 billion in
third-quarter 2008 and $1.006 billion in this year’s second quarter.
In the US, BP operates 10,000 miles of liquids pipeline and five
refineries with 1.5 million b/d of total capacity.

PDVSA acquires stake in ConocoPhillips project

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Venezuela produces 6.3 bcfd of gas, but is working on projects
to double that output by 2012; currently, the Andean nation has
South America’s largest proven reserves of gas at more than 170
tcf.
ConocoPhillips and the Venezuelan government are locked in
a dispute over compensation for oil operations in the heavy-crude
Orinoco belt of eastern Venezuela.
Venezuela’s President Hugo Chavez’s administration nationalized four heavy oil projects in 2007, seizing control of ConocoPhillips’s operations after the companies failed to agree on terms
for a minority stake.
ConocoPhillips later initiated international arbitration against
Venezuela to secure compensation for its oil investments and operations.

Toreador to exit Turkey, Hungary
Toreador Resources Corp., Paris, has entered into two definitive agreements to sell separately its Turkish subsidiary, Toreador
Turkey Ltd., and its Hungarian subsidiary, Toreador Hungary Ltd.
The company’s Turkish unit will be purchased by private Norwegian energy company Tiway Oil for a total consideration of
$10.6 million paid at closing, plus exploration success payments of
up to $40 million plus contingent future net profit payments.
Toreador’s Hungarian unit, meanwhile, will be acquired by
private Austrian company Rohol-Aufsuchungs AG for $5.8 million
plus a contingent payment of $2.9 million to be paid upon posttransaction completion of agreements relating to certain assets of
Toreador Hungary.
The Toreador Turkey transaction is expected to close on Oct. 7
and the Toreador Hungary deal has closed on Sept. 30.
Total combined cash proceeds upon closing of both deals will
be $16.4 million (which excludes contingent future payments).
Both transactions are subject to standard post-closing purchase
price adjustments.
Craig McKenzie, Toreador president and chief exploration officer, said, “We expect that the proceeds of these transactions will
enable us to continue repurchasing a portion of our convertible
notes, and to continue delivering our corporate strategy to develop the low-risk conventional exploration of our French acreage
and to plan our ‘proof of concept’ phase for the unconventional
exploitation of the Paris basin oil shale.”

Venezuela’s state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA said it has
acquired from ConocoPhillips a stake in the Deltana Platform—a
joint natural gas project with Chevron Corp.
PDVSA said the acquisition will result in the creation of a new
joint venture to exploit the Deltana Platform, with the Venezuelan
company having a 61% stake and Chevron 39%. The Deltana Platform is in the Atlantic Ocean between the mouth of the Orinoco
KNOC to buy Harvest Energy Trust
River and Trinidad and Tobago.
Korea National Oil Corp. plans to buy Harvest Energy Trust for
PDVSA said output will reach 750 MMcfd of gas, which will be
transported via a 300-km pipeline to the Gran Mariscal de Ayacu- $1.8 billion (Can.) plus the assumption of $2.3 billion in debt.
KNOC Pres. Young-won Kang said the acquisition fits into the
cho Industrial Complex, now under construction in Venezuela’s
company’s North American growth strategy.

BP to ply tight sands gas of Jordan’s Risha
BP PLC plans to join Jordan’s state-owned National Petroleum
Co. (NPC) to exploit the onshore Risha concession in northeasternmost Jordan.
Subject to government and parliamentary approval, BP is to
farm into the Risha concession as a partner with NPC. The concession borders Syria, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia.
The Risha concession, awarded by the government to NPC,
covers about 1.7 million acres. The concession includes Risha gas
field, 170 miles northeast of Amman, where the first successful
wells were drilled in the late 1980s.
BP said it will conduct initial exploration and appraisal work
that will involve shooting seismic, working on existing wells, and
drilling new wells. If that is successful, then the company will
move to agreeing on a substantive development.
The gas reservoir appears to be tight sandstones of Lower Paleozoic (Ordovician or Silurian) age at 8,000-8,500 ft. Several
Risha wells are nearly astride the Jordan-Iraq border.
Husseini et al. wrote in 2007 that Jordan’s Paleozoic Risha field
produces 30 MMcfd of gas from more than 30 wells. BP said the
present rate is more than 20 MMcfd.
It extends across a 10 by 50 km area, “but the reservoir is a thin
sheet of complex sandstones in faulted glaciofluvial channels, ranging
in thickness from 2 to 12 m. Its proven reserves are 180 bcf of gas, the
equivalent of only 32.4 million bbl of oil (OGJ, July 2, 2007, p. 40).”
Indications are that Risha shares similar geology with the undeveloped Akkas discovery about 125 miles east in Iraq’s western desert.

Four Chesapeake shales set output marks
Chesapeake Energy Corp., Oklahoma City, achieved record
gross operated production from its four main US shale gas plays.
The company reported exceeding 1 bcfd in from the Barnett
shale, reaching 500 MMcfd from the Haynesville shale, topping
400 MMcfd from the Fayetteville shale, and attaining 100 MMcfd
from the Marcellus shale.
The production levels came from 1,500 Chesapeake-operated
Barnett wells, 125 Haynesville wells, 450 Fayetteville wells, and
60 Marcellus wells.
Since entering the Barnett shale in late 2004, the company has
become its second largest gas producer.
Chesapeake said the 125 operated Haynesville wells are 20%
the number needed to reach the same production level in the
Barnett. Plains Exploration & Production Co. is Chesapeake’s 20%

joint venture partner in the Haynesville.
Chesapeake is also the second largest gas producer in the Fayetteville, where BP America Inc. is its 25% joint venture partner.
Chesapeake said it’s the largest leaseholder in the Marcellus,
where StatoilHydro is its 32.5% joint venture partner, and expects
to become the play’s largest producer by the end of 2009.
Among recent completions:
Barnett—The Day Kimball Hill A1 in Tarrant County, Tex.,
peaked at 16.4 MMcfd and is expected to average more than 13
MMcfd in its first month and exceed the previous monthly industry Barnett output record established by two Chesapeake-operated
wells in mid-2009 that averaged more than 9 MMcfd.
Haynesville—Caspiana 13-15-12 H-1 peaked at 20.2 MMcfd,
and Bradway 24-15-12 H-1 peaked at 18.6 MMcfd. Both are in
Caddo Parish, La.
Fayetteville—Reva Deen 7-8-1-15H9 in White County, Ark,
peaked at 8 MMcfd, and Collinsworth 7-16 2-10H in Conway
County peaked at 6.2 MMcfd.
Marcellus—Clapper 2H in Susquehanna County, Pa., peaked at 10.1
MMcfd, and Otten 2H in Bradford County peaked at 8.9 MMcfd.

SEG: Group to research low frequency seismic
Five multinational oil and gas exploration and development
companies have joined a 3-year project to research low frequency seismic technologies for hydrocarbon reservoir detection and
characterization.
Early participants are Cairn Energy PLC, Chevron Corp., ExxonMobil Corp., GDF Suez, and Petroleos Mexicanos. An Asian national oil company is expected to join the group, known as Low
Frequency Seismic Partnership, within months, said Spectraseis,
Zurich, Switzerland.
The program will cover key application elements of low frequency seismic technology, such as data acquisition and processing, as well as fundamental theoretical studies, in partnership with
researchers at Spectraseis, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, and the University of Bern, Switzerland.
Participants will be at the leading edge of the latest research on
low frequency seismic applications and will learn how to extract
the maximum value from this technology for their companies,
Spectraseis said (OGJ, Oct. 26, 2009, p. 33).
Established in 2003, Spectraseis is the principal technology and
service provider in the fast-emerging field of low frequency seismic geophysical surveys and data analysis. ✦

Plains All American buys Tulsa storage
Plains All American Pipeline LP has bought receiving pipelines,
a manifold system, and 400,000 bbl of crude oil storage capacity at
Holly Corp.’s 85,000-b/d refinery in Tulsa for $40 million cash.
Holly, the seller, entered a 15-year tank lease and minimum

three crude oil receiving pipelines covered by the transaction.
Holly retains ownership of 2.8 million bbl of intermediate and
finished product storage at the refinery, which it acquired from
Sunoco Inc. last June.
The companies agreed to explore use of the Tulsa storage facilities to capture trading opportunities that may arise from Tulsa’s
proximity to Cushing, Okla., an important pipeline hub and pricing location.
Holly recently agreed to buy from Sinclair Oil Corp. a 75,000b/d refinery 2 miles from its Tulsa facility. It plans to integrate the

Enterprise, Duncan to expand Acadian gas line
Enterprise Products Partners LP and Duncan Energy Partners LP
announced plans to extend their jointly owned Acadian Gas LLC
subsidiary’s Louisiana intrastate natural gas pipeline system into
northwest Louisiana. The expansion will provide producers in the
Haynesville shale access to nine interstate pipelines (Florida Gas,
Texas Eastern, Transco, Sonat, Columbia Gulf, Trunkline, ANR,
Tennessee Gas, and Texas Gas) via Acadian’s existing 1,000-mile
south Louisiana network.
The project, dubbed the Haynesville Extension, will have capacity to move 1.4 bcfd through 249 miles of 36-in. and 30-in.
OD pipeline connecting to both Acadian’s system and its affiliated
Cypress Gas Pipeline. Acadian will build two new compressor station totaling 67,000 hp as part of the project. Additional long-term
commitments could boost capacity to 2 bcfd. Enterprise expects
the Haynesville Extension to enter service in September 2011.
The current Acadian system has access to more than 150 enduse markets between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, a rapid-cycle
salt dome storage cavern, and the Henry Hub. The Haynesville Extension will intersect with Acadian in Pointe Coupee and Assumption Parishes and with the Cypress system in Point Coupee and
West Baton Rouge. Initial upstream connections will include nine
Haynesville shale locations in DeSoto and Red River Parishes.
Regency Energy Partners LP, Alinda Capital Partners LLC, and
GE Energy Financial Services announced plans in September to
construct a $47 million pipeline extension of the Haynesville Expansion Project (HEP) in North Louisiana to increase capacity on
the Regency Intrastate Gas System (RIGS). The extension, called
the Red River Lateral, will add 100,000 MMbtu/day of capacity to
the current project, bringing the total capacity to about 1.2 bcfd.
Regency described the Red River Lateral as the first of several opportunities to extend the HEP (OGJ Online, Sept. 14, 2009).
Energy Transfer Partners LP also in September entered into a
10-year contract with a shipper to transport 300 MMcfd of gas on
its Tiger Pipeline system, bringing total capacity commitments on
the proposed line to not less than 1.8 bcfd. ETP said the new volume commitment further demonstrated the need for additional
pipeline capacity out of the Haynesville shale. Pending necessary
regulatory approvals, ETP intends to start construction of the line
by June 2010 and have it in service in the first half of 2011.

fields to supply the proposed Wheatstone LNG project in Western
Australia.
The arrangement also provides for Apache and Kufpec to take
a respective 16.25% and 8.7% interest in the Wheatstone facilities.
Chevron will retain a 75% stake in the project.
The deal means Wheatstone is the first LNG project in Australia
to attract large volumes of third-party gas supplies. It will also extend the life of Wheatstone as it will unlock 2.1 tcf of gas reserves
at Julimar and Brunello and generate a production for 15 years.
Apaches says the likely net capital expenditure for its part of
the project will be $1.2 billion for the upstream development of its
two fields which lie in permit WA-356-P plus $2.9 billion for its
share of the Wheatstone facilities, including the LNG plant.
First phase of Wheatstone development is planned as a twotrain LNG facility capable of producing 8.6 million tonnes/year of
LNG along with pipeline gas from a domestic gas plant.

Turkmenistan completes gas line spur to China

Turkmenistan has completed construction on its 188-km section of a 7,000-km natural gas pipeline that extends from Turkmenistan to China, according to official media.
“Work on the Turkmen section of the Turkmenistan-Uzbekistan-Kazakhstan-China gas pipeline…is complete,” said the stateowned Neutral Turkmenistan newspaper.
Construction of the Turkmen section of the line, at a cost of
$400 million, was carried out by Russia’s Stroytransgaz. The whole
line, which will transport gas from the Caspian Sea across Central
Asia to China, is scheduled to start up by yearend. The pipeline
starts from Turkmen gas fields near the Amu Darya river. It then
enters Uzbekistan at Olot, then flows on to southern Kazakhstan,
and on to Alashankou in China, where it will be connected to the
West-East Gas Pipeline.
In addition to gas from Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, the $7.3
billion line is to be supplied from Kazakhstan’s Karachaganak,
Tengiz and Kashagan gas fields. China National Petroleum Corp.
has already signed a 30-year agreement for the supply of 30 billion
cu m/year of gas through the new line.
The new development comes at an opportune moment for
Turkmenistan, whose gas historically has been piped to Russia.
But the Central Asian country has been seeking to diversify its

Four “T’s” of subsidies
Your editorial “Confusion over subsidies” begs for a more complete discussion or definition of what subsidies are
and why they exist (OGJ, Oct. 5, 2009,
p. 24). I have been quite concerned
about this for many years as I also look
at percentage depletion, 14¢ gasoline in
some OPEC countries, ethanol tax credits, sugar support, big auto and textile
tariffs, etc.
Webster’s Dictionary describes “subsidy” as “a grant by a government to a
private person or company to assist an
enterprise deemed advantageous to the
public.”
I believe this discussion centers
around this definition from the dictionary. It is a directed funding of money
raised from all of society to a specific
governmental deemed socially important. However, one should also recognize that subsidies have four characteristics. A subsidy should be:
• Targeted. Percentage depletion is
a tax deduction targeted at the US oil
and gas producer as a means to support capital formation. Government had
deemed that domestic production of oil
and gas was needed to give society a
secure source of energy. (Note: Targets
can change just as easily as new governments are elected.)
• Timely. In the case of General Motors, billions of dollars in bailout money
was needed to keep a perceived major
firm in a major industry alive. The
perception by government was that the
cash infusion was deemed to be cheaper
than the cost to society of the collapse of
this firm and its supporting industries.
Timing was deemed critical. This source
of funding is similar to venture capital as seed money, with the associated
equity interest in the firm that could be
liquidated at a latter date. (Note: The
timing of any change in any target is as
swift as a change in government.)
• Transparent. Here I have a real
problem in finding a good example of
transparency. Perhaps this is because
those who create and those who receive
most subsidies would rather not expose
this monetary transfer to public scrutiny. Why should the source of those

funds have a right to know how they are
spent? Isn’t that why the US has a representative form of government where
“We the People” have assigned that duty
to our elected officials knowing that
they always act in society’s best interest?
• Temporary. This last “T” is the
biggest problem with all subsidies. It is
politically difficult to stop assisting special interests deemed to help society or,
at least, one’s reelection coffers. In addition, those who feed at this trough put
up such a hew and cry with even the
threat of being weaned that the social
unrest seen when Iran announced that
the controlled 14¢/gal price was about
to be doubled, no less moved to global
rates, threatened to be truly dangerous.

With this “T” any enterprise deemed
to be in the social good still must prove
itself. While many actions are best done
by government, such as building roads
and maintaining a military, the funding
of nongovernmental activities should
not be allowed an indefinite life span.
Any governmental funding that does
not have the characteristic of these four
T’s is hard to call a subsidy. Rather it
is government support of activities that
members of society will not support on
their own, and if such funding has become engrained in society it evolves into
a supposed right that the government is
obligated to continue.
So what does this all have to do
with the energy industry? Certainly the

industry’s “subsidies” make it easier to
do business. Can it now thrive if any
form of subsidy was terminated (along
with those subsidies for other forms
of energy that are past the start-up
phase)? Frankly I hope so. Otherwise
why should anyone want to be in this
business?
Perhaps looking at subsidies in this
manner will put the entire issue into a
new light. Of course, the observer still
has to be able to see the trees for the
forest. And that is an entirely different
matter.

WTI futures-one month, $/bbl

Oil rig counts rebound

according to the Baker Hughes figures.
The count of gas rigs started to
fall in September of last year, as the
economic recession took a firm grip
and just as Hurricane Ike hit the Gulf
of Mexico and Texas. At that time, rigs
drilling for gas accounted for about
80% of all US rigs.
Gas prices fell, too. The front-month
futures price on the NYMEX plunged
to $2.508/MMbtu in early September
of this year from a high of $13.577/
MMbtu on July 3, 2008.
The shrinking share of gas wells and
the consequent rise in the share of oil
wells in total drilling is a reflection of
oil’s detachment from gas on a btu-value
basis. As the price of oil has rebounded
since its precipitous decline a year ago, it
has left natural gas prices far behind.
While the price of oil has soared—
to past $80/bbl on the NYMEX last
month—gas futures have not moved
much higher than $5/MMbtu since the
start of 2009.
The heat content of crude oil is 5.8

Climate change twists
Twisted legal argument has pushed the US to
the verge of a potentially costly litigation spree
over climate change. And twisted legal argument
might be the only way out of the mess.
The heavy hand of jurisprudence, blind to
scientific distinction, is equating greenhouse gases
with air pollutants because of their contributions to atmospheric warming. Carbon dioxide, a
substance essential to life, thus falls subject to the
same regulatory treatment as airborne toxins. This
makes no sense. But CO2 is the villain of globalwarming politics because of its correlation with
human activity.

US House members launched their

Oct. 21 with a hearing designed to rally

note of reality into the otherwise optimistic proceedings, however.

“If the nation’s tax, financial, resource

country will be the better for it.”
Producers aren’t the only ones feeling the impact of severely reduced
drilling. States’ revenues from oil and
gas taxes have dropped along with
other business levies.
“If minerals are the cornerstone of

natural gas is undoubtedly the cornerstone of the minerals forecast,” the

you to avoid policies that could endanger jobs in the domestic oil and natural
gas industry, an industry that is critical
to both our energy and economic security,” Mark H. Ayers, president of the
AFL-CIO’s Building and Construction
Trades Department, and API Pres. Jack
Gerard said in letters they jointly signed
on the committee’s behalf.
One proposed tax increase, repeal
of the federal tax code’s Section 199
tax exemption, would jeopardize $32
billion of planned US refinery modifications that would create more than
22,000 construction jobs and 3,000
permanent jobs, they told Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and Ranking Minority

Member Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa),
and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles B. Rangel (D-NY)
and Ranking Minority Member Dave
Camp (R-Mich.).
The provision was enacted in 2004
as part of the American Jobs Creation
Act to give US manufacturers a way to
offset foreign government subsidies
of the US firms’ overseas competitors,
Ayers and Gerard noted in their letters.
The proposed tax increase would make
the exemption inapplicable to the oil
and gas industry.
“Between 2005 and 2009, US refining capacity increased by a total of
547,000 b/d. Between 2001 and 2004,
[it] increased by a total of 299,000 b/d.
In other words, the rate of capacity

expansion nearly doubled after the passage of Section 199,” the letters said.
They noted that the oil and gas
industry supports 9 million jobs in
the US, including thousands of building and construction jobs that support
refinery modifications and expansions,
pipeline construction, and fabrication
of equipment used to produce domestic
oil and gas.
The committee, which was formed
in June, includes representatives of the
AFL-CIO’s BCTD, which represents 13
national and international unions; the
International Union of Operating Engineers; and the United Brotherhood of

well as several oil and gas companies’

S

uddenly, members of Congress
are talking about natural gas. It
was one thing when US Reps. Tim
Murphy (R-Pa.) and Dan Boren (DOkla.) formed a gas caucus on Oct.
1. It was another when Sens. Mary L.
Landrieu (D-La.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ala.) formed one in the Senate
on Oct. 23, 2 days after the House’s
caucus held its first hearing.
The reasons are obvious, leaders of each caucus said. “When we
produce natural gas in America, we
produce jobs in America,” Landrieu
maintained. “A reliable and affordable supply of US energy has profound impacts on every sector of our
economy and is the backbone of the
US employment base.”
Chambliss added, “America has
an abundant supply of clean natural
gas and has the means to access these
resources in an environmentally
friendly way. Increasing domestic
production is a critical component of
a comprehensive energy policy that
will reduce America’s dependence on
foreign sources for our energy needs.”
At the House hearing, Murphy
observed that new technologies have
opened up unconventional gas fields
in the Lower 48 in the last 3 years.
“With the recent estimates of 1,836
tcf of technically recoverable gas
reserves, there is enough domestic
supply to power America for more
than 100 years,” he said.

‘Success story’
“The decisions Congress makes
in the near term will determine the
stability of our domestic energy industry and the future of our nation,”
added Boren. “It is our job to help
our colleagues in Congress under28

stand the great success story there is
to be had with natural gas.”
But Bruce H. Vincent, president
of Swift Energy Co. in Houston and
vice-chairman of the Independent
Petroleum Association of America,
told the House caucus that independents who produce most of the nation’s gas already face problems.
“The current drop in gas commodity prices has reduced drilling
activity to half of last year’s high
levels. Credit market restrictions
bringing less access to capital are also
hampering development,” he said.

‘Important tool’
Vincent noted that bills in Congress to revise trading of commodities could create problems. “Much of
this year’s drilling activity is being
done because of higher revenues
resulting from hedges from earlier
years when gas prices were higher,”
he explained. “The structure of new
commodity legislation could inhibit
or effectively preclude independents
from using this important cash-management tool.”
The Obama administration’s plan
to repeal policies such as intangible drilling and development-cost
exemptions, which have been part
of the federal tax code since its
inception in 1913, and percentage
depletion, which was added in 1926,
could reduce drilling of new wells
25-40% and cut US production of oil
20% and gas 12%, Vincent added.
With active caucuses on both sides

lished markets to control sulfur dioxide
and nitrous oxide emissions contributing to acid rain in the 1990s. “They’re
working. You don’t hear much about
SOx and NOx in the Northeast these
days,” he said. The program provides
both positive and negative lessons in
developing a domestic carbon cap-andtrade program, he added.
One such lesson was that it cost
much less than expected too deal with
SOx and NOx, Berlin noted. “I don’t
want to sound overconfident, but
business has shown that it can develop
technologies to meet new challenges,”
he said.
Europe took the initiative after the
administration of former President
George W. Bush began and eventually
instituted its own carbon cap-and-trade
program in 20 countries, Gitlin said.
He said that perceptions that Europe’s
program failed are unfair because measured carbon emissions fell from 2007
to 2008, well before the worldwide
recession began last fall.
Although the European Union did
not include motor vehicles in the first
phase of its cap-and-trade program,
gasoline and diesel fuel costs already
were high enough that it didn’t matter as much, Gitlin said. “In Europe,
carbon prices closely follow energy,
particularly coal. When it gets cheap
relative to gas, carbon prices go up
because companies buy more coal,” he
said. Several US lawmakers are looking
closely at price signals and potential
volatility, he noted.
The discovery of significant US gas
resources in tight shale formations, primarily on private land, could improve
the situation by making domestic gas
prices much less volatile, Cavaney said.
“Power generators have been reluctant
to embrace gas more fully because of
prices,” he said.

Action needed
Participants agreed that action
is needed to address global climate
change. “Over the next 40 years, we’ll
have to change how we generate energy and move away from fossil fuels,”

said Berlin. “New technologies may be
inherently more expensive. Cars will
have to use less energy. The big international debate will be how to fund CO2
reductions in the developing world going forward. The developed world will
have to play a major part.”
Cavaney listed three major challenges: Managing the transition,
because “it’s not clear which companies
would be the low-carbon successors

at the scale we’ll need.” Availability of
capital, and how it is allocated, because
“policy drives where capital goes.” And
establishing regulatory systems with
enough flexibility so that mistakes can
be corrected quickly.
In remarks concluding the discussion, the panel’s moderator, Rebecca
Ramich, director of Deloitte Consulting LLP’s federal energy and resources

practice, said that the situation is
complicated, but that the US and its energy businesses have successfully faced
complicated situations before.
“We spawned a new generation of
oil and gas exploration and production technologies following the 1973

admittedly with fits and starts and zigs

Ramich said. ✦

For example, Paul noted, it takes
$200 billion in exploration and production spending to add 1% of global oil

1% of global liquids production. And
10 Gw of solar would add 1% to US

Conventional oil production will be
inadequate to meet demand, enormous
quantities of new feedstock are available, and low carbon fuel standards are
coming, he said.
Hopefully, the world is coming out
of the worst economic downturn in
our lifetimes, and 2010 liquid fuels demand is forecast to be similar to that in
2006-07, he said. Every form of energy

reminded SEG delegates that the world
took 125 years to consume the first
trillion barrels of oil and is using
the second trillion in 25 years. It is
estimated that another trillion barrels
remain to be discovered, ostensibly at
a cost of $20 trillion over the next two
decades.

Sustainable R&D
Research and development has to
deliver energy, environment, and economic benefits, especially an economic
return if it is to be sustainable, McDonald said. Industry will derive benefits
from independent and collaborative
research and development.
Areas of applied R&D include how
to get biomass to work at commercial scale, how to use lower grade

heat in geothermal processes, how to
eliminate natural gas use in oil and gas
operations, how to make steamflooding work in carbonate reservoirs, and
converting heavier products into lighter
fuels, McDonald said.
The successful pursuit of carbon
sequestration will “sustain a prosperous
future for fossil fuels,” said Raymond
Orbach, director of the energy institute,
University of Texas at Austin.
The processes of capturing, compressing, and storing carbon dioxide
are highly energy intensive, and the
industry needs to reduce the cost of
capturing CO2 from flue gas, which is
extremely high, said Orbach, a former
DOE official.
Public acceptance of the risks associated with CO2 storage cannot be

taken for granted, as demonstrated by
protests in Germany this year against a
project to sequester CO2 at 2,600 ft in a
saline aquifer.
Bob Pavey, partner, Morganthaler
Ventures and past chairman of the National Venture Capital Association, said
energy research projects have become a
new destination for venture capital only
in the past 2 years or so.
Previously most venture capital went
to health care, information technology,
and consumer and business services
companies.
Great uncertainty revolves around
who ultimately will buy the developing
energy companies that venture capitalists are supporting with seed funds
if those companies’ research results
in commercially viable technologies,
Pavey said. ✦

WoodMac: Carbon bill could be costly to US refiners
Proposed legislation on carbon
capture and sequestration potentially
could cost US refiners $100 billion/
year, threatening the sustainability of
the domestic refining industry and
giving undue favor to non-US refiners,
said analysts at Wood Mackenzie Ltd.,
Edinburgh, in a recent study.
“The draft US legislation is much
more onerous on the US refining sector
than its European counterparts,” said
Alan Gelder, head of downstream oil
consulting for WoodMac. “US refiners
will not only be required to purchase
emission credits for both the stationary emissions (from the refinery) but
also the emissions from the subsequent
combustion of the fuels.”
Moreover, he said, “The free
allocation—or cap—for the US refining
sector equates to less than 5% of total
carbon emissions from the production
and consumption of transportation
fuels in the US. We expect US refiners will need to purchase around [2
billion] credits in 2015, to the tune of
$100 billion/year.”
Although the projected costs of
30

credits between the two regions are
similar, refiners in northwest Europe
are expected to purchase only 3 million
credits in 2015, around 0.1% of the US
requirement.
In spite of the cost implications for
the refining sector, WoodMac anticipates that the impact on product
demand will be low compared to other
initiatives such as the US vehicle efficiency and Low Carbon Fuel standards.
Depending on the interpretation and
implementation of the current legislation, the greatest disruption could be to
products supply.
“The current legislation’s provisions
on intrastate trade could offer significant advantages to long-haul gasoline
exporters, prompting rationalization of
the US refining industry. Even if this
intrastate provision is closed, which
we anticipate, the costs of carbon will
increase overall operating costs, significantly reducing the future cash flows
and enterprise value of the US refining
industry,” Gelder said.
The report, “US Refining—The
potentially disruptive impact of car-

bon,” by the independent research
consultants includes a comprehensive
comparison of the potential impact on
US refiners of the proposed WaxmanMarkey climate bill, HR 2454, vs. their
counterparts in northwest Europe
where changes to equivalent legislation,
the existing European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), will progress into
Phase 3 in 2013.
Gelder said, “It is important to
note that the proposed Senate climate
change and energy legislation has even
more stringent emissions targets than
the hotly debated Waxman-Markey bill.
Although the Senate’s goal is to progress the legislation to committees by
Thanksgiving, we believe other priorities with healthcare, financial regulatory reform, and the economy will push
movement on the bill into next year.
That said, the issue will continue to
take center stage as the Environmental
Protection Agency continues to move
forward developing carbon dioxide
regulations for mobile sources followed
by stationary sources.”
Gelder concluded: “The refining

Legal implications
John R. Eldridge, an attorney with
Haynes and Boone LLP in Houston,
notes the lesson for the oil and gas
industry is that it cannot expect immediate dismissal of claims associated
with damages allegedly caused by GHG
emissions.
“This is not saying that a state or
tribe or city or individual pursuing one
of these claims to abate the nuisance
will get an order enjoining an oil company or refinery from emitting carbon
dioxide,” Eldridge said. “We still don’t
know how these cases will ultimately
turn out.”
Meanwhile, he advises oil companies
to be prepared in case they get targeted in a tort claim involving climate
change.
“Companies need to figure out what
their position is about legislation based
on the fact that they may be defending these kinds of cases if there is not a
fix or a resolution by the US Supreme
Court or by Congress,” through GHG
legislation, Eldridge said.

“I think this is going to be a wake
up call for the industry,” he said, referring specifically to the Kivalina case. “I
think most people had some sense that
these claims were so far out that they
would be dismissed upfront as political
or for lack of standing.”
Peter S. Glaser, a partner with Troutman Sanders LLP in Washington, said,
“We are having a cataclysm going on in
federal and state tort law as it applies to
climate change. This is really extraordinary, and I can’t overstate to you the
importance of this.” Speaking during
a webcast briefing arranged by the
Western Business Roundtable, Glaser
said the implication stemming from the
recent court decisions is that any GHG
emitter, including fossil fuel producers,
can be sued.
“The amount of emissions didn’t
seem to matter…basically any emitter
of greenhouse gases and any producer
of fossil fuels…can also be sued,” Glaser said.
For instance, plaintiffs can sue an oil
company and seek an injunction where,
if successful, a judge could say stop
emitting, use some other type of fuel,
or reduce emissions, he said.
“But even worse, you can be sued in
damages,” Glaser said. “The really worrisome part of the case in Mississippi
was that the plaintiffs were property
owners in the Hurricane Katrina area
represented by old-time, well-known
plaintiff trial lawyers. These people
don’t care about global warming, and
they don’t care about proper public
policy. They want money…. It’s even
more worrisome because in effect we
will have global warming policy now
because that is what is really at stake
here,” if judges and juries can tell oil
companies to change their behavior. ✦

Hunt Oil’s
Peru problems

E

nvironmental concerns are growing around the world, putting
increased pressure on the oil and gas
industry. Consider Hunt Oil’s problems in Peru.
Peruvian tribes want Hunt to
abandon its exploration program on
Block 76. To emphasize their point,
the tribes have threatened to forcibly
remove oil workers from a camp near
the town of Salvacion in the Madre de
Dios region of southern Peru.
After their threat, tribal reps last
week said they would hold talks with
Hunt officials. “We have to wait for
the result of this meeting before we
know about the removal,” said Maria
Gonzalez of the Fenamad indigenous
rights group.
The tribes insist that a government
concession to Hunt and Repsol to
look for oil in Block 76 broke the law.
They say the concession strays into the
Amarakaeri Communal Reserve, protected ancestral lands that could hold
billions of dollars of oil deposits.

The second period of the partners’
contract commenced in the first
quarter of 2009.
Hunt also has its supporters in
the region. Marco Pastor Rozas of
Sernanp, the government agency that
oversees protected lands, has said
Hunt’s plan meets environmental
guidelines and that it enjoys the support of at least four of eight communities near the Amarakaeri reserve.
But four of eight does not seem to be
quite enough support for Hunt, which –
in addition to protests from the Amarakaeri reserve – also faced criticism from
two other indigenous associations in the
area, Fenamad and Coharyima.

Tribal plans

Together with the Amarakeri, those
groups signed a letter this month saying they would “take actions to stop
seismic work in the interior of the
reserve and even put our lives on the
line so that our rights are respected.”
According to Fenamad, maps

Exploration field geoscientists have
reported the existence of negative thermal anomalies over oil fields and have
suggested that thermal profiling can
be a useful, cost-effective tool for oil
exploration.1 2
Though the idea appears to possess
much commercial significance, it has
still not been well investigated so far,
owing to the fact that its field proving

can be considered to be largely uniform for all practical purposes over the
scene.
Further, multispectral optical data
can be used to deal with the problems
of vegetation and surface moisture to a
practical reasonable extent.

Cambay basin for possible detection of
thermal anomalies from satellite sensor

pixels are related to the thermophysical characteristics of oil at depth. Oil
has characteristically lower thermal
conductivity, higher specific heat, and
lower thermal diffusivity than the
reservoir rock. It is well known that
there is a general geothermal energy
flux from depth to the earth’s surface.
The presence of oil in a reservoir would
change the effective thermal conductivity, thus causing spatial variations
in heat transfer, resulting in relatively
lower surface temperatures over oil
fields.1
Thus, field data already exist on the
presence of negative thermal anomalies
over oil fields. It is shown here that
processed satellite sensor data also exhibit preferential clustering of anomalous cooler pixels over known oil fields.
Based on the above empirical relationship, a possible prospect (e in Fig.
1) can be identified for further investigation. Finally, it may be mentioned
that there lies a great potential in satellite sensor data which is yet to be fully
investigated and exploited in exploration tasks. ✦

Heavy crude takes up the annulus
space from depth H to l, while the drilling mud and heavy crude mixture occupies the space from depth l to surface.
After heavy oil flows into the borehole and mixes with the drilling mud,
the annulus pressure loss increases
and the flow rate of the mixture in
the annulus decreases because of the
increased viscosity of the mixture as it
moves up in the annulus.
At a certain depth, the mixture
stops moving up when the temperature
reaches the crude oil congealing point,
resulting in the blocked annulus.

One can obtain the annulus blocking
time t with an iteration scheme and a
comparison of the total borehole flowing friction (Δpmoa + flowing friction of
drilling mud in the borehole) and the
standpipe pressure (SSP), ps.
To remove the heavy-oil blockage,
one needs to apply a blockage-relieving

2.0

pressure, which equals to the minimum annulus friction for actuating
circulation.

Blockage relieving pressure
As Fig. 4 shows,3 3.4 hr after the
heavy oil first reached surface, the
minimum annulus friction that the

circulation needs to overcome is 14.55
MPa, and the circulation friction of the
drilling mud in the drilling string is
2.56 MPa, computed using the empirical equation in the equation box.
Thus, the total borehole flowing
friction (annulus flowing friction +
flowing friction of drilling mud in the
borehole) is 17.11 MPa, which is greater
than the SSP of 17 MPa. Hence, the annulus was blocked and drill pipe stuck.
As time proceeds, the minimum
annulus flowing friction that circulation needs to overcome increases; and
therefore, restoring circulation requires
a greater blockage relieving pressure.
As time increases beyond 9 hr, however, this minimum annulus flowing
friction varies very slowly and remains
nearly constant.
Based on Fig. 4, the reverse circulation blockage relieving pressure is 25
MPa.
After the well was shut-in, the drilling crew reverse circulated the drilling
mud and pumped drilling mud into the
annulus to relieve the heavy oil blockage. The drilling mud density was 1.10
g/cc, and the pump pressure was 25
MPa.
The reverse circulation removed the
blockage. After removing the blockage, the crew pumped another 80 cu
m of drilling mud into the annulus
to squeeze the heavy oil back into the
fractured formation.
After the drilling operation returned
to normal, the crew raised the drilling
mud density to 1.15 g/cc. Mud losses,
however, continued while drilling
deeper.
Because of this, it was decided to

Two factors mainly influenced
propane markets and pricing during
second and third quarters 2009.
First, the economic recession continued to limit ethylene production and

production quotas in accord with
agreements reached in September and
December 2008.
Specifically, crude oil production
in the Middle East averaged 21.6 million b/d, or 2.2 million b/d less than
in third-quarter 2008. OPEC’s overall
reductions in crude oil production had
significant bullish impact on crude oil
prices and prices for crude oil-derived
ethylene feedstocks during second and
third quarters.
Equally important for propane markets, LPG production in Saudi Arabia
from gas processing plants declined as
a result of crude oil production curtailments on associated gas production.
Propane exports from Saudi Arabia
averaged 168,000 b/d February-August,
or 76,000 b/d (31%) less than the same
time period in 2008, according to data
complied by Waterborne Energy, Houston. The reduction in propane exports
from Saudi Arabia resulted in a tightening international supply-demand balance, while at the same time propane
supply in the US remained plentiful.

Feedstock demand
During second-quarter 2009, feedstock demand for propane increased
by 55,800 b/d vs. consumption during first-quarter 2009 and averaged
286,000 b/d. This increase was consistent with seasonal patterns, but demand
in second-quarter 2009 was 47,000 b/d
(14%) less than prerecession demand.
We note that feedstock demand for
propane averaged 330,000-360,000 b/d
during first-half 2008 and reached a
peak of 410,000-430,000 b/d in JuneJuly 2008.
Propane demand averaged 335,000345,000 b/d in July and 320,000330,000 b/d in August. We estimate
demand for third-quarter 2009 averaged 325,000-335,000 b/d for thirdquarter 2009.
Table 1 summarizes trends in ethylene feedstock demand for propane.
Ethylene producers operated at 72%

Regional inventory trends
Propane inventory in primary storage in Petroleum Administration for
Defense District II (accompanying box)
reached its seasonal minimum at the
end of February 2009 and totaled 13.0
million bbl, or 4.3 million bbl more
than year-earlier volumes and 2.7 million bbl more than the 5-year average
(Table 2).
According to EIA’s Petroleum Supply
Monthly statistics, propane inventory in
PADD II storage increased to 24.2 million bbl at the end of June and was 6.3
million bbl higher than in 2008. Based
on EIA weekly reports, inventories in
PADD II increased to about 31 million
bbl at the end of September.
Propane inventory in primary storage in PADD III (excluding nonfuel
propylene) reached its seasonal minimum of 17.9 million bbl in mid-March
and totaled 19.5 million bbl at the end
of March, according to EIA’s Petroleum Supply Monthly statistics. During
second-quarter 2009, inventories increased by 13.4 million bbl and totaled
33.5 million bbl at the end of June. At
this level, inventories were 16.1 million
bbl higher than year-earlier levels and
12.1 million bbl higher than the 5-year
average.
According to EIA weekly inventory reports, propane stocks in PADD
III were unchanged during early July
through late September and totaled
about 32.0 million bbl. Typically, inventories in PADD III increase by about
9 million bbl. The surge in waterborne
exports and the slump in waterborne
imports effectively absorbed the typical
increase in inventories during thirdquarter 2009.

strict compliance with their production quotas during second and third
quarters 2009 and forward-looking
crude oil buyers and traders began to
see reasons for optimism for an end to
the economic recession. As a result, the
crude oil price rally during FebruaryMarch 2009 was the beginning of a
strong rebound rather than an overdue
correction, as we had anticipated (OGJ,
May 4, 2009, p. 72). As a result, WTI
prices averaged $60-70/bbl during second and third quarters 2009.
As expected, however, ethane supplies were plentiful and spot ethane
prices remained relatively weak. Competition from ethane for incremental
feedstock demand continued to undermine propane’s feedstock value.
At the end of the heating season,
propane prices in Mont Belvieu averaged 65.2¢/gal in March 2009. The
price average for March was 7.4¢/gal
lower than the average of 72.6¢/gal
for January 2009 despite the increase
in West Texas Intermediate crude oil
prices of $6.25/bbl. Propane’s ratio vs.

WTI declined to 57.0% in March 2009
from 73.0% in January 2009. Propane
prices fell to a low of 63.4¢/gal in April
and the ratio vs. WTI fell to 53.5%.
Prices strengthened in May and June
and averaged 72.7¢/gal for secondquarter 2009, or 5¢/gal higher than the
average for first-quarter 2009. Despite
the price rally in May and June, however, the price ratio vs. WTI averaged
only 51.4% in second-quarter 2009 vs.
66.7% in first-quarter 2009. Prices continued to increase in the third quarter
and averaged 87¢/gal. Propane’s ratio
vs. WTI also improved in third-quarter
2009 and averaged 53.6%.
For second-quarter 2009, propane
prices averaged 72.7¢/gal, but feedstock
parity values vs. light naphthas averaged 87.9¢/gal. The discount of 15.2¢/
gal revealed the full impact of plentiful
ethane supply and weak ethane prices
on propane’s market value.
In third-quarter 2009, propane
prices averaged 87¢/gal and feedstock
parity values vs. light naphthas averaged 97¢/gal. The discount of 10¢/gal

showed that propane remained deeply
discounted in the Gulf Coast ethylene
feedstock market.
These comparisons indicate that the
impact of the economic recession on
ethylene feedstock demand reinforced
the generally bearish impact of the propane inventory surplus. Feedstock parity values vs. ethane, however, averaged
68.4¢/gal in the second quarter (4.3¢/

gal lower than spot propane prices) and
85.8¢/gal in third-quarter 2009 (1.3¢/
gal lower than propane prices). The
narrowing differential between spot
prices and propane’s feedstock parity
values vs. ethane indicate that the surge
in waterborne exports from the Gulf
Coast during third-quarter 2009 began
to counter some of the bearish impact
of the inventory surplus.

Winter 2009-10
We expect key OPEC producers to
continue to maintain strict compliance
with their production quotas during
fourth-quarter 2009 and first-quarter
2010. Furthermore, we expect gradual
improvement in global economic activity to encourage forward looking crude
oil buyers and traders to remain optimistic regarding the global crude oil
supply-demand balance in 2010. WTI
prices will average $68-72/bbl during
fourth-quarter 2009 but will weaken
somewhat during first-quarter 2010
and will average $62-67/bbl.
In the Gulf Coast ethylene feedstock
market, feedstock demand for ethane exceeded production during first
and second quarters 2009 and ethane
inventories in the Gulf Coast declined
by almost 5 million bbl during January
through June 2009. This trend continued during third-quarter 2009.
Most likely, as the ethane supplydemand balance continues to tighten
during the winter heating season, spot
ethane prices will strengthen. As a
result, spot propane prices in Mont Belvieu will average 95-100¢/gal, or 8-18¢/
gal higher than during third-quarter
2009. ✦

Pressure isolation and
hot tapping, traditionally
used for repair, play an
increasingly important
role in the maintenance
and expansion of both
Pipelines
offshore and onshore
natural gas pipeline
systems. An agreement between TDW
Offshore Services AS and Amserve Engineering
to service
Sarawak
Shell
Berhad’s
Malaysian
pipeline assets serves
as one example of this development.

Pressure isolation facilitates
onshore, offshore maintenance
Background

Christopher E. Smith
Pipeline Editor

Pipeline pressure isolation typically occurs in conjunction with valve
change-outs on export lines in the
event of leakage. Offshore isolations of
valves with a 24-38 in. bore typically
require a four-man crew to launch,
monitor, and retrieve a tool such as
TDW’s SmartPlug. Operations take 2-4
weeks depending on circumstances.
The isolation system avoids:
• Gas flaring, displacement of pipeline contents.
• Production during shutdown
repairs.
• Gas, hydrocarbon vapor emissions.

• Holes, future leak paths.
• Decommissioning, recommissioning.
• Hydrate, chemical, contaminated
water disposal.
The tool can isolate any pipeline medium, including natural gas, crude oil,
distillates, treated or untreated waters,
glycol, etc., in pipe of 10-42 in. OD.
Each of its two independent plug modules, activated by an onboard microhydraulic system, can isolate the full
pipeline pressure, providing doubleblock isolation. It self-locks in position
as long as there’s a pressure delta across
the tool and can be unset and recovered
even if communication fails. Differential pressure produces a thrust load on
the tool which it transfers to the pipe
wall. The tool communicates with the
surface via an ELF antenna allowing
two-way contact between it and the
operator.

Tool actuation
Threaded hardened steel segments
immobilize the tool in the pipeline.
Pressurizing the set side of the internal
hydraulic cylinder moves the piston
from right to left, activating the segments and causing them to slide up the
bowl and expand radially.
Machined threads on the outer surfaces of the segments allow their teeth
to penetrate the surface of the pipeline’s
inner wall by a few thousandths of a

millimeter, well
within API tolerances. Engaging
one third of the
segments provides
sufficient grip for
isolation.1
Setting the
SmartPlug at the
end of a dry pipeline before laying
allows dry tie-ins
with less expensive
vessels and prevents
flooding during
handover between
vessel and platform
should a wet buckle
occur. Placing one
tool on either side
of a preinstalled
tee allows tie-in of
pipelines without
shutting down the
pipeline, flooding,
or environmental
remediation.

Malaysian work

A team prepares to load the pressure isolation tool into a pig launcher as part of valve replacement at Sarawak Shell Berhad’s M3
platform offshore Malaysia (Source: TDW Offshore Services AS; Fig. 2).

The project for
Shell, focused on maintaining and
expanding its assets in the region as
opposed to addressing an emergency
leak, will require double blocks in a
number of sections to fully isolate the
work area from hydrocarbons. Attempting to perform the work without such
blocks would require bleeding of the
line, which can be both costly and time
consuming.
Work covers Shell’s facilities in the
South China Sea, off western Borneo,
including the M3, B11, E11 RB, F23 and
F6 platforms, 80-200 km from Miri and
Bintulu, Sarawak. Natural gas currently
travels through four trunklines to an
onshore processing plant in Bintulu.
Shell operates the development for a
joint venture between it and Petronas
Carigali Sdn. Bhd.
Successful isolations of platforms
F23 and M3 have already occurred,
with plans in place to tie-in a new line
to F23 and replace two valves on E11

RB during the balance of 2009. Plugs
used have been assembled, tested, and
mobilized from TDW-Stavanger via
Labuan, Malaysia.
The E11 Hub integrated gas project,
Shell EP Asia Pacific’s largest ongoing project, will centralize production
from surrounding fields through one
integrated hub, shipping processed
gas to Petronas’s Malaysia LNG Bintulu
complex.2
The MLNG Bintulu complex, operating since 1983, consists of the Satu,
Dua, and Tiga projects, with its combined capacity of 1.1 tcf/year ranking
as the largest in the world. An expansion of Dua is scheduled for completion
in 2010.3 As of August 2006 MLNG
Japan bought 65% of Bintulu’s production, with the balance shipped to Korea
(26%) and Taiwan (9%).

Onshore applications
Pressure isolation tools are also
becoming more common in onshore
applications. The difficultly and expense of otherwise interrupting flow
in offshore lines, combined with the
greater strength of the lines themselves,
saw pressure isolation tools first used in
this arena.
As the prices of transported products
have risen, however, and environmental concerns and regulations have
mounted, in-service pressure isolation
has become an increasingly viable alternative for onshore modifications and
maintenance as well. The use of external reinforcing clamps has addressed
concerns regarding insufficient WT
or pipe grade in older high-pressure
onshore systems.
A 2007 World Bank document addressing HSE issues related to onshore
oil and gas development explicitly calls
for safe isolation procedures before

Initial onshore use of the tool for a

km natural gas transmission grid in
eastern Germany prevented the loss of
about 110,000 cu m of natural gas, any

section without interrupting service.
In both instances 38-in. diameter
pressure-isolation pigs were deployed
to an excavated section of pipeline
roughly 100 m from a pig launcher.
Pipeline pressure was held at 50 bar
for 3 days during isolation, with each
operation taking 10 days from arrival to
completion.1 ✦

Tool helps produce marginal wells
The Holey Moley gas diversion tool is
designed as a simple, inexpensive way to
continue to produce a marginal well.
The company says its product allows
you to pump under a packer. It adds that a
lease operator no longer has to fear a hole
in the casing. At the same time that you
avoid an expensive squeeze job you can
lower lifting costs and eliminate gas locking, the company points out.
The Holey Moley is inserted into the
tubing string to restore production quickly
and economically, the firm says. No special
tools are required. This patented device can
bring stripper wells back from extinction,
the company notes. The tool is maintenance free. The Holey Moley also can serve
as a tool for gas lifting.

New items for data management, geoscience uses
Newly released Version 5.3 of Recall,
a program for managing, storing, and

processing wellbore data, includes enhancements to data integration, work flow,
search tools, database security, petrophysical sensitivity, and uncertainty analysis.
In conjunction with the release are two
new products: Raven and Impetus.
Raven is a new suite of applications that
implement an automated validation engine
for Recall. These applications run investigations on the data loaded into Recall databases, and provide rule-based evaluation of
data quality and metrics. Raven features a
graphical explorer-style interactive display,
which allows management and technical
staff to appraise data integrity and decide
how it will be made available to the company’s geoscience community.
Impetus is designed for casual or novice
users of image data and is based on Recall’s Log Image loading, processing, and
interpretation software. The emphasis is on
guidance, visualization, and ease of use,
while adopting a familiar windows-like
interface for all operations, wrapped into
a single Log Imaging package. Impetus

features a guided wizard for preparation
of quality images from raw data (from any
commercial imaging tool), and the image
interpretation module is coupled with 3D
viewer and dip pattern analysis tools.
Version 5.3 also includes the RePhine
module, a new tool for petrophysical sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. Work flow
is further improved through a “transfer
bucket” and WITSML loader. Added to this
is the PWE Recall browser, a new Recall
search tool, and improved Recall database
security. Users will be able to see all data
associated with the well, view attributes,
and select data for download. Individual
logs or curves can be selected to be plotted, and the user has control over the
depth range to be plotted, plot format, and
depth scale.

Climate change
poses new threat:
a litigation spree
Common sense on climate change is
pinned down by crossfire among the three
branches of US government.
Congress is contriving cap-and-trade
legislation that would expensively overhaul energy markets and has potential,
according to a report for the American
Petroleum Institute by Ensys Energy, to
shutter a third of US refining capacity by
2030. The Obama administration craves a

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

climate change bill to flaunt at an international summit on the subject in December.
So the Environmental Protection Agency
threatens to exercise authority it received
in a 2007 Supreme Court decision to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air
Act. That decision, which will be activated
when EPA makes final its obedient finding
last April that greenhouse gases endanger
public health, essentially classified carbon
dioxide, a compound essential to life, as
an air pollutant.
And the tort bar smells money.
Suppliers of fossil fuels are being sued
on grounds their products aggravate
global warming, which have caused geophysical phenomena from which plaintiffs
suffered loss. By that logic, oil companies
and others have been blamed for damage
from Hurricane Katrina in 2005, for erosion
of a barrier island in Alaska, and for other
calamities.
Until recently, defendants’ lawyers have
prevailed with arguments based on absence of merit or plantiffs’ legal standing.
In two cases, though, the plaintiffs have
won reversals on appeal (OGJ Online, Oct.
22, 2009). The result, warns Peter Glaser,
chair of the Climate Change Practice Team
in the Washington, DC, office of Troutman
Sanders LLP, is a “potentially massive
number of lawsuits.”
If weather damage can be blamed on
climate processes presumptively caused
by emissions of carbon dioxide, any emitter of the substance is a potential defendant.
That, of course, would include anyone
who breaths. But oil companies and electric utilities have more money.
Preventing a proliferation of lawsuits,
which would make the MTBE litigation
spree of the early part of this decade look
like a warm-up, might require an act of
Congress.
As Glaser points out, however, the
political cost of legislative repair anytime
soon would be support for the cap-andtrade wrecking ball now under design.

US mileage and oil-price patterns
The Department of Transportation said total miles driven in the US during August were up 0.7% from the same period in 2008, following a 2.3% gain in July.
Total miles driven this year through August equaled mileage driven in the same
8-month period in 2008, DOT said. However, Jacques H. Rousseau, an analyst at
Soleil-Back Bay Research, noted, “It is important to remember that 2008 was a
leap year and included an extra day in February, so on a daily basis, miles driven
are up 0.5% year-to-date.”
Still, said Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland, “What is more worrying is that August is declining vs. July, and this goes against the normal seasonal
trend.” He said, “Apart from the low levels of 2008, we have to go back to 2003 to
find a comparable low Vehicles Miles Traveled during August.”
As crude prices hit a 12-month high of $82/bbl on the New York market Oct. 21,
Jakob said, “Change in driving patterns is a multiweek rather than an overnight
process, and the vehicles miles data shows that the US driving patterns did not
start to change in the summer of 2008 when crude was at $147/bbl but in the fourth
quarter of 2007 when crude prices were starting to break above $80/bbl. They
started to increase again only after a few months of crude oil at sub-$50/bbl.”
Hence, he said, “We have to start being cautious on the forward outlook for US
gasoline demand on a price elasticity basis. With the high level of stocks and poor
refining margins, [US] imports of gasoline have been sharply reduced; but with the
widening premium of West Texas Intermediate to North Sea Brent, the arbitrage
economics on gasoline are starting to improve while the US cracks should at the
same time sponsor some incremental supplies.”
Meanwhile, data released by the Association of American Railroads for the
week ended Oct. 17 showed North American rail volume to be still 18.6% below
last year (US down 15.4%, Canada down 10.4%, Mexico down 9.5%). “These yearon-year comparisons should start to improve due to the base effect of the end of
October 2008 collapse, but they are nonetheless proof of a recovery that is only
timid and in that environment we will have to start watching for any negative price
impact on oil demand if the [recent oil price] rally was to continue,” Jakob said.
US inventories
The Energy Information Administration said commercial US inventories of
crude increased by 1.3 million bbl to 339.1 million bbl in the week ended Oct.
16—the latest period at presstime last week. Gasoline stocks fell 2.3 million bbl to
206.9 million bbl. Distillate fuel inventories decreased by 800,000 bbl to 169.9 million bbl. Imports of crude into the US dipped by 32,000 b/d to 8.7 million b/d that
week. In the 4 weeks through Oct. 16, crude imports were 310,000 b/d below the
same period in 2008.
Input of crude into US refineries declined 27,000 b/d to 14.1 million b/d in the
final week with units operating at 81.1% of capacity. Gasoline production was virtually unchanged at 8.5 million b/d, but distillate fuel production increased slightly to
3.9 million b/d.
Rousseau said, “Refined product inventories (gasoline plus distillate plus jet
fuel) fell 3.3 million bbl (0.8%)…due to lower supply. Refiners continued to operate at very low levels because of weak refining margins, and imports fell to their
lowest level of the year. After showing signs of improvement the last 3 weeks,
gasoline demand dropped to under 9 million b/d, according to the EIA. Inventories
of distillate remain very high heading into winter.” He foresees weak earnings in
the refining sector into 2010.
Meanwhile, Jakob said open interest in reformulated blend stock for oxygenate
blending (RBOB) futures continues to increase, reaching the previous peak levels
of last May. “Gasoline demand on the 4-week average [through Oct. 16] is 4.2%
higher than a year ago, but we need to point to some flags on demand. Comparing
recent demand to a year ago has been made somewhat difficult given the hurricane disruptions last year, but overall demand on the 4-week average is now even
slightly lower than a year ago with a continued deficit of distillate demand,” he
said.
In the rest of the world, German consumer stocks of heating oil remain at multiyear highs, and it will take an extreme winter to make room for the stocks of distillates “that have been sent from Asia to float in European waters,” Jakob said.

BP Drills Deepest
Oil Well in the World
Thank you to the following companies and their staff
who contributed to this signiﬁcant achievement.

BP’s Tiber discovery, situated approximately 250 miles offshore in the
Gulf of Mexico, reached a world record total vertical depth of 35,050 feet.
At almost seven miles below the sea surface, Tiber is the deepest well
drilled for hydrocarbons in the world. Each of these companies were
essential to the success of this record-breaking project.

Why Produce
Diesel from the
Vacuum Unit?
Look ahead five years. The economy is likely to keep tightening
and the rush to control pollution
will inevitably be accompanied
by demands for greater energy
conservation. Consequence? A
growing market for diesel which
yields more energy per unit
volume. Yet many continue to
believe that producing diesel
from the vacuum unit is poor
design—that it should be produced only from the atmospheric
column. Hence many refiners

PROCESS

CONSULTING
SERVICES,INC.

Also: eliminating diesel from
vacuum unit feed cuts vacuum
gas oil (VGO) yield because
it is more difficult to vaporize
the feed in the vacuum column
flash zone. If atmospheric diesel
recovery is very high, VGO yield
is low. As crudes get heavier
it is essential to leave some
diesel in the vacuum column
feed to achieve reasonable VGO
cutpoints.
Lastly, if you process Canadian
oils sands Dilbit and Synbit, you
can’t run the atmospheric heater
hotter than 680°F resulting in very
high diesel boiling range material
in the vacuum feed. To obtain reasonable diesel recovery from the
whole crude you must produce it
in the vacuum unit.

feed 20-30% diesel boiling range
material to their FCCs or hydrocrackers. But where most motor
fuel is diesel, refiners have long
known that producing vacuum
unit diesel can increase production up to 5 volume percent on
whole crude.
Maximum diesel production is
simply not possible in the
atmospheric column because
flash zone temperature would
need to be 760°F or higher.
Moreover, the inherent reflux
rate below the diesel draw results
in molar L/V ratio less than 0.15.
But in vacuum columns it can be
0.4 or higher. And distillation is
driven by L/V!

Study: Tapping off-limit US resources beneﬁcial
Development of US oil and gas resources that Congress has kept
off-limits for decades could generate more than $1.7 trillion in
government revenues, create thousands of new jobs, and enhance
the nation’s energy security by significantly boosting domestic energy production, a new study suggested.
The study by ICF International, which the American Petroleum
Institute commissioned, concluded that developing offshore areas
covered by congressional moratoriums until recently, along with
resources in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and a small portion of currently unavailable land in the Rocky Mountains, could
increase US crude oil production by as much as 2 million b/d by
2030, offsetting nearly a fifth of the nation’s crude imports.
Natural gas production could increase by 5.34 bcfd, or the
equivalent of 61% of the expected gas imports in 2030, the study
added. It also estimated that development of all US oil and gas
resources on federal lands could exceed $4 trillion over the life of
the resources.
US crude production would rise by 36% and natural gas production would increase by 10% if development is permitted in the
studied areas of the US Outer Continental Shelf, ANWR, and the
Rockies, according to the ICF study. About 160,000 jobs would be
created in the process, it indicated.
API Pres. Jack N. Gerard said the study underscores how the
oil and gas industry could enhance US energy security and help
solve domestic economic problems by increasing US oil and gas
production.
“The US oil and gas industry supports more than 6 million
jobs, and more drilling for oil and gas will mean more energy for
America, more well-paying jobs, and trillions of dollars of muchneeded revenues that will help federal, state, and local governments
pay for critical services,” he said.

NPRA sees ﬂaws in regulating GHGs under CAA
Attempts to regulate greenhouse gases (GHG) under the Clean
Air Act (CAA) would have numerous potentially harmful consequences, the National Petrochemical & Refiners Association told
the US Environmental Protection Agency.
“The regulation of GHG under the CAA would constitute EPA’s
single largest and potentially most complex assertion of authority
over the [US] economy and Americans’ lifestyles,” the trade association warned in a Nov. 25 response to EPA’s July 30 Advanced
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.
“Regulation of GHG under the act would have enormous consequences for every facet of the economy, for industry large and
small, as well as for the general population. Indeed, the potential impact on the country to regulate GHG cannot be overstated

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

and makes all prior EPA regulatory efforts pale by comparison,” it
maintained.
It said EPA still has much work to do before making a final
decision on whether GHG emissions from automobiles cause or
contribute to US public health or welfare endangerment. EPA’s
analysis “draws most heavily on reports prepared by only a handful of entities, particularly the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change, and especially with respect to its analysis of human health
and welfare effects,” NPRA said in its filing.
“The agency has an obligation, however, to consider all relevant
science on climate change, impacts, and effects on health and welfare. It may not disregard data without justification,” the association said.
NPRA does not believe EPA should proceed with an endangerment finding at this time nor begin a process of subjecting various
entities to various CAA provisions in an effort to begin GHG emissions, NPRA Pres. Charles T. Drevna said on Dec. 2.
“The act was not designed to address a global pollutant like
[carbon dioxide] and, thus, cannot be used to meaningfully alter
its atmospheric concentration. Indeed, EPA’s suggested approaches
for applying the CAA’s provisions to GHG sources would impose
severe costs on domestic industry, reduce our domestic energy security, and damage the national economy as businesses shift activities overseas to areas where they will not be subject to futile
regulation,” he said.
“Discussion of these issues in the ANPR is woefully inadequate,
and the public should be given the opportunity to consider them
before EPA makes any further decisions under the CAA,” Drevna
said.

EU, Egypt sign energy cooperation agreement
The European Commission and Egypt’s Foreign Affairs Minister
Ahmed Aboul Gheit, signed a memorandum of understanding Dec.
2 to enhance energy cooperation between Egypt and the European
Union. The pact would reinforce energy security for both.
Among five priorities are the establishment of a work program
to gradually converge Egypt’s energy markets with the EU’s and
the development of energy networks such as the Arab Gas Pipeline,
which could transport Egyptian and possibly Iraqi natural gas to
European countries.
Other areas covered include market reforms, promotion of renewable energy and energy efficiency, and technological and industry cooperation.
“Egypt is the EU’s sixth largest natural gas supplier and a key
transit country between the Middle East, Africa, and the EU,” said
EC Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner. “Egypt’s commitment
to energy reforms is crucial for the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean energy market.” ✦

Development

Pioneer drilling lateral in Eagle Ford shale
Pioneer Natural Resources Inc., Dallas, is drilling the horizontal
leg in Cretaceous Eagle Ford shale in an exploratory well in DeWitt
County, Tex.
This is about 90 miles east-northeast of where Petrohawk Energy Corp., Houston, gauged an Eagle Ford gas-condensate discovery
in LaSalle County (OGJ Online, Oct. 21, 2008).
Petrohawk is completing its second well in LaSalle and is drilling in McMullen County, Pioneer said.
Pioneer has logs through Eagle Ford from the more than 150
wells it has drilled in the Cretaceous Edwards Trend along its
310,000-acre spread from LaSalle to Lavaca counties and chose to
horizontally drill the Eagle Ford where it saw the best porosity.
Permeability is the question, the company said Dec. 2.
Eagle Ford shale is the source rock for the Cretaceous Austin
chalk and Edwards formations, Pioneer noted.
Meanwhile, the company’s Edwards gas production is averaging
85 MMcfd.

Reindeer delays gas project off W. Australia
The Apache Australia-Santos Ltd. joint venture has postponed
its Reindeer gas project off Western Australia, citing the poor
global economic outlook that has impacted the project’s main
customer.
The project included an unmanned wellhead platform and an
undersea natural gas pipeline to transport gas 100 km to shore. The
proposed onshore plant, at Devil Creek, 65 km south of Karratha,
included gas processing facilities for supplying the domestic market in Western Australia. The project was to have come on stream
in 2010.
Deferral of Reindeer means that Apache and Santos will have to
suspend or terminate engineering and construction contracts. The
main contractor is Perth-based Clough Engineering.
However Santos said that work will continue on regulatory approvals to ensure that restarting the project can be timely once gas
sales agreements supporting the development are concluded.
Reindeer, which contains an estimated 410-640 petajoules of
gas, was found in 1997 on permit WA-209-P.
Apache has a 55% interest and is the operator. Santos holds the
remaining 45% interest.

Cabot to hike Pennsylvania Marcellus program
Cabot Oil & Gas Corp., Houston, plans to boost production
from Devonian Marcellus shale in northeastern Pennsylvania in the
next few weeks from the current 13 MMcfd as it hooks up six vertical and three horizontal wells.
Meanwhile, the company expects to expand to eight rigs in
2009 from the five currently working.
Cabot’s first horizontal Marcellus well came on line at 6.4
MMcfd after a six-stage frac in its 2,000-ft lateral. Measured total
depth is 8,925 ft.
Marcellus drilling totals 18 wells, 4 of them horizontal. The
2009 program calls for 16 vertical and 7 horizontal wells. Four
vertical and 3 horizontal wells remain to be drilled in 2008.
8

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Typical costs are $1.3-1.5 million for a vertical well and $2.6-2.9
million for a horizontal well. Average footage is 7,200 vertically
and 2,200 ft laterally.
The company has laid 10 miles of pipeline and started up one
compressor with a second unit standing by as produced volumes
warrant.

Haynesville gas ﬂows as high as 28 MMcfd
Three operators reported new horizontal completions in Jurassic Haynesville shale at rates as high as 28.2 MMcfd of gas.
The three companies, Petrohawk Energy Corp. of Houston and
Comstock Resources Inc. and EXCO Resources Inc. of the Dallas
area, plan much more activity in the Haynesville in East Texas and
Northwest Louisiana.
Petrohawk reported the 28.2 MMcfd rate at its Sample 9-1 in
9-14n-11w, Red River Parish, La., about 12 miles south of Elm
Grove gas field. The rate came on a 30⁄64-in. choke with 7,100 psi
flowing casing pressure.
Petrohawk’s Brown 17-4 in 17-16n-11w, Bossier Parish, gauged
23.4 MMcfd on a 26⁄64-in. choke with 7,700 psi FCP. And its Goodwin 9-5 in 9-16n-11w, Bossier Parish, made 21.1 MMcfd on a
26
⁄64-in. choke with 6,750 psi FCP. The company plans to complete
five more Haynesville shale wells by yearend 2009.
Initial flow rate is 9 MMcfd at Comstock’s BSMC LA 7-1H well
in Toledo Bend North field, De Soto Parish. The flow came from
a 4,300-ft lateral at 11,750 ft true vertical depth after a 10-stage
frac.
Comstock is running another 10-stage frac at its Collins LA
15-1H well in Logansport field, also in De Soto. It has a 4,200-ft
leg at 11,350 ft. The company has a 22% interest in the Gamble
24-1H well at Logansport, drilled to 11,800 ft TVD with a 3,950-ft
lateral.
Comstock has drilled the vertical portion of two other Haynesville wells. Bogue A-6H in Waskom field in Harrison County is to
get a 4,000-ft lateral, and Green 13H in Blocker field in Harrison
County is to get a 3,700-ft lateral. Comstock is drilling vertically
at Headrick 1H and Hart 1H in Logansport and Moneyham 7H in
Longwood field. Each is due a 4,000-ft leg.
EXCO said its first Haynesville horizontal well, Oden 30H6
in De Soto Parish, averaged 22.5 MMcfd on a 26⁄64-in. choke with
7,800 psi FCP. It has a 4,481-ft lateral at 12,304 ft TVD.
EXCO has two operated horizontal wells, one vertical well, and
two outside-operated horizontal wells in the play and plans to drill
25 or more horizontal Haynesville wells in 2009.

Busy 2009 seen in western Newfoundland
Vulcan Minerals Inc., St. John’s, expects a busy year in several
exploration plays in Newfoundland and Labrador in 2009.
Vulcan plans to drill a 3,600-m exploration well, Robinson-1,
onshore in the Bay St. George basin that would be the basin’s deepest well ever. It is on a seismically defined structure with several
prospective reservoirs.
A drill pad is being built for the well, which is the culmination
of several years of seismic work and shallow drilling. Vulcan’s 50%

working interest is to be carried fully by Investcan Energy Corp.
Vulcan plans to drill two other onshore wells 1,500-2,500 m
deep onshore in the basin and is reviewing the prospect for completing two 150-m core holes at Flat Bay to sample for natural
fracture systems.
Leprechaun Resources Ltd., private Alberta company, has become operator of three onshore permits at Parsons Pond, western Newfoundland, in which Vulcan holds 7.39-18.57% interests.
Leprechaun is raising funds. The Parsons Pond area covers 100,000
acres of Cambrian-Ordovician platformal rocks in an area of numerous oil seeps, and seismically defined drill targets occur as deep
as 4,000 m, Vulcan noted.
Vulcan owns 19% of the stock of NWest Energy Inc., which
holds 100% working interest in 1.6 million acres off western Newfoundland. The blocks cover a Cambrian-Ordovician-Silurian platform and foreland basin rocks with petroleum potential. NWest is
shooting seismic and seeking partners for drilling.
Meanwhile, Vulcan and Investcan plan to explore 584,466-acre
License 1107 off Labrador. The license offsets two undeveloped
gas discoveries and has several seismic leads. Investcan’s interest
is 50%.

Shell farms into Sicilian offshore licenses
Northern Petroleum UK Ltd. has brought in as a partner Shell
Italia Exploration & Production SPA for its licenses off Sicily under
a farmout agreement.
Shell will acquire a 55% interest in GR17-NP, GR18-NP, GR19NP, and a 70% stake in GR20-NP, GR21-NP, GR22-NP licenses.
Shell has agreed to pay €1.9 million for Northern Petroleum’s
back-costs and various seismic work. Northern will serve as operator during the initial seismic phase, and Shell will serve as operator
once drilling starts.
The assets are estimated to hold unaudited, combined, and unrisked prospective resources of 1.9 billion bbl of recoverable oil.
Derek Musgrove, Northern Petroleum managing director, said,
“Shell will bring to the project Italian thrust belt and production
experience, in addition to its international major project and deepwater expertise. In 2003, we perceived the potential of the thrust
belt play in the Sicily Channel ahead of the new climate of gas oil
prices and have been progressing these licences for several years.
The area under licence in the Sicily Channel is 4,367 sq km and
if drilling is successful it could open up a new Western European
hydrocarbon province.” ✦

Montana BLM okays Bowdoin gas ﬁeld plan

StatoilHydro tables Canadian bitumen upgrader

A decision to drill new and replacement wells at a rate equal to
the retirement of no longer productive wells will keep the Bowdoin natural gas field active for another 35-50 years, the US Bureau
of Land Management said on Dec. 5.
BLM officials in Montana announced a finding of no significant
impact as they approved a proposed alternative with additional
mitigation for the project by Fidelity Exploration & Production Co.
and five other producers who want to drill within one of Montana’s oldest gas fields.
They said that the field, which has been active from the 1930s
and has about 1,450 wells, generally straddles the line between
Phillips and Valley counties south from the Canadian border to US
Highway 2.
“Production from some wells that were drilled in the 1940s
would be restored by drilling new replacement wells from the
original drilling pads. In other instances, areas within the field that
were previously passed over would be tapped to increase productivity,” said Donato Judice, supervisor in BLM’s Great Falls office.
Approved project components include up to 635 wells on individual sites; construction of new access roads and associated facilities, upgrading and use of existing roads; disposal of produced
water with evaporation ponds at each well site; use of solar, wind,
and gas-fired engines as external power sources, and installation of
electric power lines on a site-specific, case-by-case basis, and use
of remote electrical devices to measure temperature, pressure, and
well flow at each wellsite, the decision said.
Fidelity E&P is a division of MDU Resources Group Inc. of Bismarck, ND, a holding company which also operates oil and gas
pipelines and electric and gas utilities from Minnesota to Oregon
and Washington.

Norway’s StatoilHydro has dropped plans to develop a $16 billion (Can.) bitumen upgrader in Alberta because of soaring costs,
poor global economic conditions, and a lack of legislative clarity.
The announcement joins a growing list of major energy infrastructure proposals that operators are delaying or canceling as economic conditions deteriorate and oil prices fall. Royal Dutch Shell
PLC has postponed a planned expansion of the Athabasca Oil Sands
Project and the 100,000 b/d Carmon Creek oil sands project, near
Peace River in northwest Alberta. Petro-Canada also warned last
month that it could cancel its proposed upgrader following a 50%
leap in costs for its massive Fort Hills project that could exceed $28
billion (Can.).
In May, StatoilHydro’s project was initially delayed for 2 years to
2016. The upgrader was going to process bitumen into synthetic
crude from its 257,000 acres of oil sands leases that were bought
last year for $2.2 billion (Can.) to diversify from mature North Sea
assets. During the first phase the capacity would be 80,000 b/d
and this was expected to cost $4 billion (Can.). Later expansion
would boost capacity to to 243,000 b/d.
However, StatoilHydro said it would continue to monitor the
cost and price environment and reassess downstream options.
“This decision does not impact the upstream part of the company’s
oil sands venture. The production from the project will be marketed as unprocessed bitumen,” the company added.
It will continue with its 10,000 b/d Leismer steam-assisted
gravity drainage project that is slated to start up in late 2010. Flint
Energy Services Ltd. has been contracted to construct the facility
160 km south of Fort McMurray, Alta., under a $41 million contract (OGJ Online, Nov. 19, 2008). ✦

Sonangol lets contract for Lobito reﬁnery
Sonangol EP has awarded an engineering, procurement, and
construction management services-site development contract to
KBR for the 200,000 b/d Lobito refinery in Angola, about 373
miles south of Luanda.
Financial details were not disclosed.
The EPC award follows KBR’s front-end engineering and design
contract granted in November. KBR will start its new assignment
immediately on the grassroots refinery, which will process heavy
crudes and reduce Angola’s product imports.
KBR’s EPC work also includes construction of a heavy haul road
to transport materials and equipment to the refinery, as well as a
marine facility that will be used to import and export both raw and
finished hydrocarbon products.

PetroSA lets contract for South African reﬁnery
PetroSA has let a feasibility and front-end engineering and design contract to KBR for its 400,000 b/d refinery in the Coega
industrial development zone outside Port Elizabeth, South Africa.
The value of the contract was not disclosed.
The award builds on the prefeasibility study that KBR carried

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
out for Project Mthombo earlier this year (OGJ Online, Nov. 11,
2008).
KBR will start the work in December, and operations at the $11
billion refinery, which will be Africa’s largest, are expected to start
in 2014.
Feasibility studies will be completed in September 2009, and a
final investment decision is scheduled for late 2010.
The refinery is of strategic importance to South Africa as national demand for refined fuels has outstripped the nation’s refining
capacity. Diesel consumption is forecast to grow at 6% and petrol at
2%/year during 2009-20.
Sipho Mkhize, PetroSA’s president and chief executive, said that
if there were no investment in refining capacity, South Africa would
have to import 10 billion l. of fuel/year by 2015—equivalent to
20% of the national requirement.
“Importing this much refined fuel will have a negative impact
on the country’s foreign exchange reserves and makes national
supply very vulnerable to external factors,” Mkhize added.
KBR will work with PetroSA to outline a competitive supplier
development program to stimulate economic growth, jobs, and
skills development in the eastern Cape under the industry liquid
fuels charter. ✦

Firms charged in Bunceﬁeld storage depot ﬁre
Total UK Ltd., Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd. (HOSL), British
Pipeline Agency Ltd. (BPA), TAV Engineering Ltd., and Motherwell
Control Systems 2003 Ltd. will be criminally prosecuted for the
December 2005 Buncefield oil storage depot fire in Hertfordshire,
UK.
The companies must appear in court on Jan. 23, 2009.
The companies face the proceedings after the Health and Safety
Executive and the Environment Agency investigated and published
its reports.
The agencies are jointly responsible for regulating nonnuclear
hazardous industrial sites in the UK.
During the incident there were a number of explosions, and 43
people were injured.
Total is being accused of failing to ensure the health, safety, and
welfare of its employees, failing to protect persons not in its employment, and polluting groundwater near the plant.
Total said it had sought legal advice and would consider its position once all the relevant papers have been served.
HOSL is facing two charges: failing to prevent a major accident
and limit its consequences to persons and the environment, and
polluting groundwater.
Hundreds of businesses, insurance companies, and local residents are seeking a total of £700 million in damages from Total and
HOSL in a separate civil lawsuit.
BPA was charged with failing to take all necessary measures to
prevent major accidents, and pollution groundwater.
TAV Engineering and Motherwell are being prosecuted for fail10

ing to protect the health and safety of people not in their employment.
In 2006, investigators said 300 tons of gasoline had escaped
from a tank, but they were unable to identify the reason behind the
ignition at the depot, 40 km north of London.
The UK minister for health and safety said in response to the investigation’s recommendations that planning for emergencies was
improving as was the effectiveness of emergency responses at major hazard sites. There also has been careful planning to maintain
the resilience of the UK’s fuel supply.

Kirkuk-Ceyhan line resumes ﬂow after repairs
Iraq resumed sending some 430,000 b/d of crude oil through
its pipeline to Turkey on Dec. 4 after flow was shut down on Dec. 1
due to technical problems.
“Oil is flowing at around 18,000 bbl/hr,” reported a shipping
agent, following the 2-day halt said by Turkish officials to have
been caused by an unidentified technical fault on a section of pipeline in Iraq.
The line had begun carrying oil earlier on Dec. 1 after the completion of repairs to damage caused by an explosion and fire on
Nov. 21 in Turkey’s southeastern province of Mardin.
The Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) rebel group claimed responsibility for the Nov. 21 bomb attack, which triggered the large fire
that stopped flow along the Kirkuk-Ceyhan line.
Turkish authorities confirmed that the blast appeared to be
caused by sabotage, although they said an investigation was ongoing (OGJ Online, Dec. 1, 2008). ✦

Alarmed at legislation
Your editorial “A chance to play
offense” is outstanding (OGJ, Nov. 24,
2008, p. 20).
I am an independent oil man, having
been in the business over 50 years, and
view with alarm impending legislation
repeating past mistakes to the industry
and the national economy.
I think there are some steps, although
expensive, the US can take that will continue to preserve our world position as
number one with the largest market, but
also militarily, and keep our considerable
influence in world affairs.
A start would be get on a war-time
footing and build nuclear generating
plants, upgrade the electrical grid, and
free up more federal lands for drilling
for oil and gas.

Technology, humanly applied
people and the environment around the
world.”

First projects announced
Steven Poruban
Senior Editor
Technology developed by the oil and
gas industry to locate and extract oil
and natural gas from below the earth’s
surface is now being adapted for humanitarian purposes.
The revamped application, in this
instance, was fueled by a devastating
natural event: the Asian Tsunami, or
Boxing Day Tsunami, that followed the Indian Ocean earthquake in December 2004. The
massive deadly wave struck
the coastlines of Indonesia,
Sri Lanka, India, and Thailand,
as well as other more-distant
locations, killing thousands of
people and injuring and displacing thousands of others.
Shortly after the disaster,
Craig Beasley, then-president
of the Society of Exploration
Geophysicists (SEG), summoned a call to action to SEG’s
membership, urging them
to help, stating, “We have
a significant contribution to make as
geophysicists.”
In early 2008, SEG Foundation, a
trust formed by SEG to provide scholarships for students of geophysics,
established a program called Geoscientists Without Borders (GWB). With
a $1 million funding commitment
from Schlumberger (and with further
investment since provided by Australia’s
Santos Ltd.), the program’s mission

45-60 in./year, they said, most of it falls
in only 3 months of the year. “The goal
of this project is to increase the water
supply through water capture, storage,
and usage management,” they said.
Led by Stephen Moysey of Clemson
University and Rangoori Ravindranath
of FES, GWB will provide tools and
knowledge that will assist villagers in
making water management decisions
that will favorably impact water supply
throughout the year, SEG said.

Last month, GWB revealed that India
and Thailand would be the sites for
the first two projects sponsored by the
GWB program.
Hydrogeophysics will play a major
role in both project sites, SEG reported,
adding, “Joining universities and their
students with communities in two

Ranking high in bribery
On some rankings it’s best to score near the
bottom. So it is with assessments by Transparency
International (TI), the anticorruption group, of
the tendency of industries to pay bribes. On two
new rankings related to TI’s Bribe Payer’s Index for
2008, the oil and gas business ranks near the top.
The survey evaluates 22 of the world’s wealthiest exporting countries based on the likelihood
that companies from them pay bribes abroad. It
comes from observations of 2,742 senior business executives from companies in 26 countries,
selected according to the size of their imports and
inflows of foreign direct investment. This year
the survey also produced two evaluations of the
likelihood that companies from specific industries
engage in illicit behavior.

On the country list, unlike the industry rankings, the cleanest countries rank highest. At the
bottom of the ranking are Mexico, 6.6, China, 6.5,
and Russia, 5.9. Other countries with more than
minor oil production and their scores are the UK,
8.6, Australia, 8.5, France and the US, 8.1 each,
Brazil and Italy, 7.4 each, and India, 6.8.
The index, said Huguette Labelle, TI chair,
shows “a number of companies from major exporting countries still use bribery to win business
abroad.” Labelle urged countries to commit to
the provisions of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development Antibribery Convention, which the TI report calls “the foremost
international legal instrument for tackling the supply side of international bribery.”

N T E R E S T
The irreversible decline of Mexico’s
Cantarell field has been the subject of
steady discussion in the industry. The
broad consensus is that Mexican oil
production levels are at serious risk,
with concomitant implications for
international oil markets. For the most
part, however, analysts have focused on
what a drop-off would mean for the
US, 16% of the crude imports of which
come from
its southern
neighbor.
But what
does Cantarell’s
decline means
for Mexico
itself, currently
the world’s sixth largest oil producer?
Consider these issues:
• Oil export revenues form the
primary pillar of Mexico’s drive toward
modernization and economic growth.
Funds from the state-owned oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), represent over 40% of the federal budget.
• Cantarell’s production has declined
to 1.12 million b/d in 2008 from
about 2.1 million b/d in 2006 (OGJ,
Dec. 11, 2006, p. 29, and OGJ Online,
Sept. 26, 2008). Pemex officials believe
Cantarell production will decline at
about 14%/year in the coming years.
• Cantarell has accounted for more
than 50% of Mexico’s production since
2000, and the nation exported most of

its oil during that time, with more than
80% going to the US.
The socioeconomic consequences
of a decrease in oil production, then,
would be profound for Mexico, leaving the country with what one analyst
called a “nightmarish budget crisis.”

New direction needed
As the erosion of Cantarell’s output
proceeds after several years of enhancement from nitrogen injection, pressure
intensifies on Mexico’s oil industry to
offset the decline. Thus, the search is on
to find and develop new fields that not
only replace losses from Cantarell but
ultimately allow Mexican production
rebound. It is increasingly clear, however, that a difficult—and different—
path lies ahead.
Two leading experts on Mexico’s oil
situation have stressed that “business
as usual” will not enable the country
to meet its oil production goals, and
they suggested actions more likely to
succeed:
• Pemex must be permitted to
develop strategic alliances with technologically sophisticated international oil
companies, says George Baker, publisher
of Mexico Energy Intelligence.
• Pemex must pay more attention
to exploration to balance its emphasis
on production if the country hopes to
meet its long-term goals, insists David
Shields, an independent oil analyst and
author of several books on Pemex.
• The company also needs to systematically refurbish and expand its
facilities along the entire energy supply
chain, Shields says.
These changes will require major
adaptation by the country’s leaders. The
2008 energy reform bill, which passed
through Congress in October, does
not offer the sweeping changes the oil
industry needs.
Pemex officials express confidence
that two other oil systems will be able
to compensate for Cantarell’s terminal decline. The onshore Chicontepec
basin and offshore Ku Maloob Zaap
(KMZ) together are estimated to hold
53% of Mexico’s reserves and 72% of

non-Cantarell reserves.1
While these regions will require
extensive capital expenditures, sophisticated technology, and time to develop,
they appear to be Mexico’s greatest
opportunities over the next decade to
compensate for Cantarell’s decline.
Unfortunately, there is a growing
likelihood that even if the key technical
challenges are tractable, aboveground
issues in Mexico will constrain production and limit exports. Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA) contends
that the greatest threats to global production increases are not belowground
but rather from the human conditions
of politics, economics, regulation, and a
hesitancy to proceed.

Resource nationalism
In 1938, Mexico became the first
major producer to expel international
oil companies (IOCs)—mostly American and British—and created Pemex.
This event remains a symbol of sovereignty and a source of national pride.
Numerous politicians have played
on this emotion and railed against any
“theft of the oil industry” by outsiders. Mexico’s leading leftist political
figure, Andres Obrador, has steadfastly
opposed private investment in the oil
sector. “The country’s oil belongs to the
people, even the most humble. We must
defend this historic conquest,” he said.2
Mexico’s oil industry, therefore, has
little opportunity to partner with foreign companies to improve production,
despite the expertise and technology
such firms could provide. The Mexican
people distrust IOCs, especially those
from the US, and proposals for private investment generate mass protests
throughout the country. A recent poll
showed that 62% of the population opposes partnering with IOCs.3
However, the administration of President Felipe Calderon, a former energy
minister, realizes that Mexico must seek
help in developing its energy resources.
In a February interview, Energy Minister
Georgina Kessel said. “We are looking
for (Pemex) to have the flexibility to
form associations like all the companies

in the world.”4 Calderon was even more
explicit in a televised national address.
“We must act now. Time and our oil are
running out,” he said.5
But Calderon’s April initiative, pushing for outside investment in deepwater
oil exploration and production (E&P),
remains unpopular. “We are in complete disagreement with the [Calderon]
government,” said Manlio Beltrones, a
senator from the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), in a radio interview.6
Ordinary Mexicans are understandably skeptical when private investors access state enterprises. Mexican
businessman Carlos Slim was ranked as
the richest man in the world in 2007,
mostly by making billions from the
privatization of Mexico’s national telephone company, Telmex.

Aging infrastructure
Pemex’s financial troubles—exemplified by a staggering increase in debt to
more than $110 billion in 2008 from
$43 billion in 2000—have led to a
patchwork oil infrastructure.7 8
The company lacks funds to modernize because Pemex pays such a high
percentage of its revenues to the government. In 2006, for example, of $97 billion in Pemex sales, $79 billion (81%)
went to federal coffers.9 As the government’s need for revenue escalates, funds
to improve energy infrastructure decline.
In 1997, Pemex had a budget of $2.7
billion for maintenance. In 2007, the
budget was only $1 billion.10
A deteriorating pipeline system
highlights Mexico’s infrastructure
problems. Over the past decade, maintenance expenditures have been only
one third of what is required, and more
than half of the pipelines are operating beyond their 30-year lifespan.11
In an effort to maintain production,
equipment is pushed to the limit, and
ruptures regularly occur from excessive
pressure. Pemex has consistently been
forced to close pipelines because of a
lack of maintenance, and it now needs
over $3 billion for urgent pipeline
repairs.

Recognizing these problems, Calderon has outlined a “National Infrastructure Program,” which includes
investments of $75 billion in E&P and
$27 billion in refining by 2012.8 Unfortunately, the urgency of maintaining
the production system is the squeaky
wheel that demands the grease. Over
80% of Pemex’s E&P budget is funneled
into production rather than exploration
(OGJ Online, Apr. 22, 2008).
Even according to relatively optimistic Pemex data, proved reserves have
fallen 41% since 2000 to about 14.7
billion bbl.12 The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) indicates
reserves have declined 75% since 1997
and now stand at 12.4 billion bbl.
Shields’s March 2008 report for the
University of California at Berkeley
presents an even more cautious view,
estimating Mexican reserves at 11.8 billion bbl.”8

Burgeoning demand
Mexico’s population, like that of
many other energy-producing nations,
is growing rapidly and consuming
more energy, reducing exports.
Its population will increase to 140
million in 2030 from 109 million in
2008—an increase of over 25% in less
than a generation.13
Economic growth is changing the
face of Mexico. The gross domestic
product will increase to $2.9 trillion
in 2030 from about $1.4 trillion in
2007—an annual growth of 3.3%.13
This increase is the foundation of the
rise of an energy-consuming middle
class.
Automobile sales are up, and there is
firm evidence that “gas guzzlers” from
the US are finding their way to Mexico,
raising fuel consumption.14 More
importantly, forecasted growth in the
number of vehicles in the next 20 years
is staggering. J. Dargay, D. Gately, and M.
Sommer, in a 2007 report, projected
that Mexico’s vehicle fleet will increase
to 66 million in 2030 from 17 million
in 2002, an astounding quadrupling
of vehicles in less than 3 decades.15 The
group’s study found that the average

annual growth rate for the number of
vehicles in Mexico is nearly double that
of the US and Canada combined.
This energy demand growth has
huge implications. EIA, in its International Energy Outlook 2008, projected
that during 2005-20 Mexico’s oil consumption will increase by about 24%.
Mexico will need 2.6 million b/d of
oil in 2020—about 500,000 b/d more
than in 2005. Mexico’s oil production,
however, will have fallen to 2.4 million
b/d from 3.8 million b/d during the
same time. By 2020, Mexico’s oil consumption will have outstripped production by 200,000 b/d (Fig. 1).
By 2030, Mexico’s oil consumption will have increased from today’s
by 48%. By then, Mexico will need
300,000 b/d more than it can produce.
Interestingly, EIA is forecasting that
Mexico’s oil production will increase
to 2.8 million b/d in 2030 from 2.4
million b/d in 2020. It remains unclear
what will ignite the 2020’s resurgence
because EIA recognized that Cantarell is
declining at 14%/year, and Pemex officials have admitted that KMZ and the
Chicontepec basin will peak in 2010
and 2016, respectively (OGJ Online,
Feb. 25, 2008).
Even if EIA’s optimistic forecast is
correct, Mexico would still need to
import 300,000 b/d to satisfy domestic
consumption by 2030. But the country
might need even more. What would
20

make oil production increase 17% in
2020-30? Where will this oil come
from?
Mexico’s shift—from US oil supplier
to its competitor for oil imports—could
happen very quickly.
In addition, burgeoning transportation demand has led to a drastic
rise in gasoline imports since 2000.
Mexico now imports about 40% of its
gasoline.16 This growth is expected to
increase by 58%—to a total of 489,000
b/d by 2015 (OGJ Online, Apr. 22,
2008). This demand is driven by the
rising middle class, an increasing
percentage of young people, and rapid
urbanization that was not adequately
planned.
Gasoline is wasted in the standstill
traffic jams that are part of everyday life
in the country’s large cities. Further, the
current pipeline-storage systems are insufficient to handle increasing gasoline
imports, and Mexico faces shortages.
Virtually all gasoline imports come
through the Atlantic port of Tuxpan,
where facilities are outdated and capacity is constrained. Mexico’s northern
states often face gasoline shortages.
As Fig. 2 demonstrates, Mexico is
more reliant on oil as an energy source
than most major producers. Accordingly, socioeconomic dislocations
from inadequate supply colliding with
increasing demand will be severe.
Oil exports are at immediate risk. In

fact, Mexico’s waning ability to export
oil is already apparent. According to
Pemex’s official June “Monthly Petroleum Statistics,” total exports fell to 1.7
million b/d in 2007 from about 1.8
million b/d in 2006—a 6% reduction
and a decline that is expected to accelerate. In May, Pemex’s exports to the
US dropped to 1.2 million b/d, a 21%
decrease in just 1 year.17
Not only is Mexico exporting less
oil, it is exporting heavier oil. Pemex’s
June statistics indicated that 89% of
crude exports this year has been of the
Maya variety, which averages about 22°
gravity. Last year, 87% of crude exports was Maya, up from 83% in 2006.
Mexico is now being forced to keep the
lighter oil that it produces—Isthmus
(34°) and Olmeca (39°)—for domestic
consumption.

Production costs rising
The financial status of Pemex is
particularly vexing given the rapidly
escalating costs of energy production.
CERA, for example, recently reported
that Pemex’s global Upstream Capital
Cost Index has doubled since 2005.18 To
make matters worse for Mexico, CERA
added: “Specialized deepwater equipment…showed the largest increase.”
More than half of Mexico’s prospective reserves lie in deep water. Chris
Salden, British Petroleum’s vice-president of E&P in Mexico, reported that
Pemex would need an investment of
$200 billion during the next decade for
deepwater work.19
Downstream costs are rising steadily
as well. The Nelson-Farrar index of
refining costs, reported in OGJ since
1946, has shown steady escalation
across the board—labor, materials, and
equipment. Escalating refining costs
are an especially important issue given
Mexico’s “need to build a refinery every
3-4 years over the next 2 decades” (OGJ
Online, May 5, 2008).
While costs are rising worldwide,
Mexico’s situation is exacerbated by
the dramatic change in the source and
quality of future oil supply. As the focus
now shifts to other fields, it is becomOil & Gas Journal / Dec. 15, 2008

Early responses
to falling demand

T

he US Energy Information Administration’s latest Short-Term
Energy Outlook said it all on Dec.
9: “The current global economic
slowdown is now projected to be
more severe and longer than in last
month’s Outlook, leading to further
reductions of global energy demand
and additional declines in crude oil
and other energy prices.”
While record prices earlier in the
year led EIA to forecast an average
West Texas Intermediate crude price
of $100/bbl for 2008, it now expects
WTI prices to average $51/bbl next
year, under current economic assumptions and assuming no major
supply disruptions. A month earlier,
EIA projected a 2009 WTI average
price of $63.50/bbl.
“The US economic recession is
also contributing to lower natural gas
wellhead prices. The Henry Hub spot
price is projected to decline from
an average of $9.17/Mcf in 2008 to
$6.25/ Mcf in 2009,” it added.
Companies are reacting cautiously,

of America.

C. Flaherty, Baker Hughes Inc.’s investor relations director. The Houston
company already is seeing a reaction
in drilling statistics, he said. “We
peaked at 2,031 rigs in the US at the
end of September. Looking at the
credit crisis and the price of oil and
gas, we think we’re on pace to exit
the year at 1,840.”
He said Baker Hughes has noticed
that conventional gas drilling in the
Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountains
has fallen, while unconventional
gas drilling from the Haynesville
and Marcellus shales has remained
constant.

‘High-grading prospects’

“We’re seeing operators highgrading their prospects that have the
biggest impacts on cash flow. They
may be more expensive, but they
also have the initial production that
provides a positive contribution,”
Flaherty told me. Service and supply
companies have set up contingencies,
he continued. “We’re doing a lot of
planning right now.”

found that AES does not appear to take
security seriously and assumes that the
Coast Guard will handle all security
at taxpayer expense. “In addition, the

security changes that may need to be
implemented. This is unfair because
the natural gas will be pumped out of

Report identifies specific risk mitigation measures that would be needed to

security risks. “Accordingly, we have
recommended that the proposed facility

by the Coast Guard,” it said.
FERC noted that since the draft EIS
was issued in late April, US Commerce
Secretary Carlos Gutierrez issued a
finding that the project, if approved,
would be consistent with the Coastal
Zone Management Act, as necessary for
the establishment of safety and security
zones for LNG traffic in Maryland and
Virginia waters.
FERC said commissioners would

decision on the proposed project. ✦

Interior Secretary Dirk A. Kempthorne
announced on July 30, Luthi told members of MMS’s OCS Policy Committee
Dec. 9 as it met in Herndon, Va., outside
Washington. “I would ask the incoming
president and Congress not to rush to
reimpose moratoriums. Once they are
in place, they are very hard to remove,”
he added.
Luthi said he hopes to have a draft
proposed OCS plan for the 2010-15
period completed by early January
but emphasized it would be at least 2
more years before it became final. This
will give coastal states and communities, energy producers and consumers,
environmental organizations, and other
groups ample time to supply input, he
explained.
The new plan also will consider
energy production beyond oil and gas
but recognizes that traditional fuels will
be needed as alternatives are developed, Luthi said. “We could provide a
bridge to renewables with traditional
resources. When we release the draft
proposed plan in January, it will ask
questions about buffer zones, environmental sensitivities and other issues,”
he suggested.
Luthi said he also hopes MMS can
complete a revenue-sharing plan with
Gulf Coast states required under the

Act by Mar. 31, 2009, and a GOMESAmandated plan for sharing revenue

Protecting ports
At the start of 2008, some of Iraq’s
ports had been infiltrated by rival militias vying for control of Basra province
and oil smuggling operations.
Fighting between the groups led to
routine blockages of access to oil fields
and ports.
Crucially, the perimeter of Umm
Qasr, Iraq’s only bluewater port and the
entry point for 80% of its imports, was
secured when Iraqi government military forces removed the Mehdi Army
militiamen who had assumed control.

White Nile raises

O

il-gas explorer White Nile Ltd.
recently raised the white flag
in Sudan, saying it plans a change of
mission and will now invest in African agriculture.
White Nile said that’s happening because the current economic
environment and political situation in
southern Sudan are not conducive to
funding nonproducing early stage oil
and gas exploration.
By contrast, it said, the agricultural
and associated civil engineering industries in Africa are resilient enough
to generate returns on investment
even in the current economic environment.
That’s hard to figure until you
add in the fact that White Nile—
soon to be called Agriterra—could
not begin its operations in southern
Sudan until January 2011 when the
region holds a referendum on total
independence.
White Nile, chaired by former
England cricketer Phil Edmonds, said
violence in southern Sudan has prevented its clarifying its exploration
rights on Block Ba.

No guarantees
In fact, the firm doesn’t think it
will be able to clarify its rights any
time soon, and certainly not before
the planned referendum on independence for southern Sudan.
White Nile would have no guarantee that the planned referendum—
assuming it were held—would give
them the desired result. Independence could be turned down, and
there would go White Nile’s deal.
Even if independence were approved, White Nile would still have
no guarantees that its agreement
26

would be honored by the government of southern Sudan. Too many
other things could happen by then.
So, White Nile said it will quit
the oil and gas business in order to
invest in and develop projects with an
already proven business model, and
in areas that attract foreign investment....
As for political stability in Sudan,
things don’t look promising. Events
in the region suggest that White Nile
had seen the writing on the wall insofar as its investment was concerned.

The Army digs in
The Sudanese army recently reinforced its presence in South Kordofan, a region bordering Darfur, in
what the Khartoum government says
is a preventive measure against the
rebel group of the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM).
Ominously, an army spokesman
last week said military forces began
moving into the oil-rich region but
did not disclose if JEM posed a direct
threat.
The announcement came days
after southern Sudan officials accused
the north of building up a large
force in South Kordofan, saying the
deployment violated the terms of the
2005 peace deal that ended 2 decades
of north-south civil war.
That won’t end Sudan’s oil business, as indicated by PetroChina,
which has just completed a crude oil
import terminal at Qinzhou.
The terminal feeds PetroChina’s
10-million-ton-capacity refinery
at Qinzhou, which is designed to

dismissed, and Iraqi marines were
deployed as part of the security crackdown. The capability of the Iraq Navy,
which operates from Umm Qasr port,
was bolstered by the delivery of US
patrol boats.
However, a projected increase in the
capabilities of the Iraqi Navy, including
the delivery of new patrol vessels from
Italy and Malaysia, has been delayed, in
part due to arguments over the cost of
the vessels and mechanics of transferring money, which is likely to extend
into 2009. The new vessels will enable the Iraqi Navy to carry out more
patrols, which have already increased by
almost 100% since the start of the year.

Protecting terminals
In April, the Iraqi Navy assumed responsibility for protection of the Khawr
al-Amaya oil terminal (KAOT) and the
al-Zubayr port. Currently one Iraqi
Navy marine battalion defends the two
oil terminals.
“However it is the al-Basrah oil
terminal (ABOT) that is most vulnerable, given that it is the only functioning oil platform,” EA said, noting that
the terminal is still at risk to attacks by
small boats operated by insurgents or
Iranian Revolutionary Guards, despite
the Coalition naval presence.
Although security issues remain a
concern, they are being replaced by infrastructural limitations as the primary
risks facing Iraq’s six commercial and
oil transit ports on the Persian Gulf, EA
said.

Underinvestment issues
“As security risks decline, it is clear
that the years of underinvestment in infrastructure and a severe lack of modern
equipment, such as container cranes,
are undermining the stability of supply
chains,” it said.
While the Iraqi Navy will take over
responsibility for guarding the two offshore oil terminals at Basrah and Khor
al-Amaya, repair and upgrade work is
essential to expand (or even maintain)
export capacity, particularly with respect
of the terminals’ connection to the

mainland ports.
In October, a study commissioned by
the US Congress warned that the two
50-km subsea oil pipelines that transport the crude to the terminals were at
imminent risk of failing due to “severe
corrosion and vulnerability to rupture,
thus reducing their ability to withstand
attempted interdiction or sabotage.”

Failure would cause a lengthy
suspension in over 1.5 million b/d of
exports, EA said, noting that it was also
reported in October that Basra port
loading rates declined to 1.32 million
b/d, due to a power generation failure.
“Addressing these issues will require
significant investments in dredging,
port construction, and offshore termi-

nal works, as well as several years to
implement projects,” EA said.
Meanwhile, Iraq’s exports risk suffering severe bottlenecks.
Still, British military sources in Iraq
are nevertheless optimistic and confirmed that port facilities are improving
and that navigational access is getting
better. ✦

for Public Policy. “I personally believe
investment in energy is a sound way
to create jobs and get out of economic
crisis.”
Referring to IEA’s World Energy
Outlook 2008 report (WEO2008),
Jones said a new international climate
agreement is the first step toward a
sustainable energy system. Effective
implementation of such a system is
crucial, he said.
Governments will have to provide
financial incentives and regulatory
frameworks that support both energy
security and climate policy goals in an
integrated way, said Jones, a former US
ambassador to Israel, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, and Lebanon. He became IEA
deputy executive director on Oct. 1.
Massive investments in energy are
needed, he said, citing an IEA reference scenario that calls for cumulative
investment of more than $26 trillion
(in 2007 dollars) during 2007-30. That
investment is $4 trillion higher than
IEA calculated in its WEO2007 report,
largely because of increased costs in the
oil and gas industry.

Energy investments needed
The WEO2008 report was released
last month. Of the latest investment
scenario, the power sector accounts for
$13.6 trillion while most of the rest
goes to oil and gas, mainly for exploration and development and mostly in
countries outside the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development.
The current financial crisis is not
expected to affect long-term investment, but could delay bringing current
projects to completion, IEA said. Just
over half of projected global energy
investment in 2007-30 goes simply to
maintain the current level of supply
capacity.
“Much of the world’s current infrastructure for supplying oil, gas, coal,
and electricity will need to be replaced
by 2030,” Jones said. “We have to run
faster just to keep in place.”
Future investments in energy
infrastructure hinge upon successful

negotiations of an international agreement on combating climate change,
he said, noting that on current trends,
energy-related emissions of carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gases will
rise inexorably, pushing average global
temperature by as much as 6° C. in the
long term, he said.
Jones said the 15th Conference of
the Parties (COP), scheduled in November 2009 in Copenhagen, provides an
opportunity for policymakers to negotiate a new global climate change policy
regime going beyond 2012, which is
the final year of coverage of the Kyoto
Protocol’s first commitment period.

The COP needs to establish a framework for long-term cooperative action
toward a clear global goal for stabilizing
the volumes of GHG emissions being
released into the atmosphere, he said.
The energy industry must play the
central role in curbing GHG emissions—through major improvements
in efficiency and rapid switching to
renewables and other low-carbon technologies, including carbon capture and
storage, he said. “Carbon capture and
storage will require creation of a huge
infrastructure,” Jones said, adding that
this effort will create jobs while cutting
GHG emissions. ✦

A three-well test program this year
“generated neither positive nor conclusive results,” said Energen (OGJ
Online, Dec. 1, 2008). The 2009 tests
may involve drilling more wells, testing
alternative completion techniques, andor completing other zones.
Energen doesn’t believe the three
wells have condemned the entire
acreage play, said John Richardson,
president and chief operating officer of
Energen Resources Corp.
Chesapeake chose not to stay in due
to financial considerations, opportunities presented by other known shale
plays, and the lack of positive results,
but Energen has the financial capacity to pursue the plays on its own and
will proceed in a low-risk manner, said
James McManus, president and chief
executive officer of Energen Corp.
“In fact, all of our costs in this program to date, including approximately
$42 million in capitalized unproved
leasehold, are less than the $55 million pre-tax gain generated by the sale

L O P M E N T

of one half of our then-200,000-acre
lease position to Chesapeake in October
2006,” McManus said.
Energen, with a 330,000-acre net
lease position in the acreage plays, faces
little lease expiration pressure in 2009.
The two companies also hold 14,000
acres outside the three areas.
The Energen-Chesapeake agreement
permanently excludes Chesapeake from
9 surrounding sq miles if
it elects not to

by Energen.
Chesapeake
could participate in other wells and could farm out
its 50% interest in the acreage to Energen or others, Richardson noted.
Finding costs of less than $3/Mcf
would be needed to make the shales
economic, he estimated.

County, on Apr. 15, 2008, and drilled to
TD 12,400 ft.
The well, which topped the Conasauga at 2,500 ft and topped a mushwad zone at 4,000 ft, was drilled with
little deviation or sticking, problems
that have plagued the wells at Big Canoe
Creek field 75 miles to the northeast in
northern St. Clair County (OGJ, Feb. 19,
2007, p. 37).
Mushwad is an acronym for malleable unctuous shale, weak-layer accretion
in a ductile duplex. After the ductal Conasauga shale was deposited in Cambrian time, Richardson explained, it “acted
as a lubricant that allowed the overlying
strata to break and thrust upward as
they glide on top of the shale. The shale
is piled up against basement ramps and
becomes thousands of feet thick.”
Energen acquired and reprocessed
more than 1,000 miles of 2D seismic
to enhance the mushwad signature and
gained enough comfort to drill some
distance from Big Canoe Creek field.
Marchant 22-16 had eight strong
shows at 6,500-12,400 ft, and the companies attempted to complete the deepest and most notable, at 11,525-730 ft.
The Conasauga is a carbonate-dominated sequence of interbedded shales
and carbonates alternating every few
inches to every few feet, Richardson
said.
“There is nothing like the Conasauga
anywhere in the country; it is a different kind of formation,” he said.
A Sept. 15 frac at 11,558-723 ft
contained 165,000 gal of crosslinked
gel and 220,000 lb of sand and resulted
in a disappointing flow of less than 50
Mcfd despite strong mud log shows.
This suggested that the completion
technique didn’t work but could be the
result of the geologic complexity of the
mushwad, Richardson said.
“Our theory is that hydraulic fracturing may not be effective in forming
a conduit to enhance the production
from a zone that is so broken and deformed. If so, the question is, does this
apply to all of the mushwad or is it a
localized occurrence?
“Our thought is to hydraulically

“We expected to see significant
gas flows much earlier in the process.
That we did not calls into question the

pressure and produce a more complex
web of fractures, thereby improving the
initial rates and reserves. Simultaneous
fracturing or “simo-frac” technique
is expensive and requires much more
planning, coordination, and logistics
as well as a larger surface location than
single frac jobs.
This article discusses the case history of sequential and simultaneous
fracturing of four similarly drilled and
completed horizontal azimuth wells in
eastern Parker County, Tex. All four wells
were stimulated with near identical
fracture treatments. Three wells with
sequential and simultaneous fracturing
had initial production (IP) of 3.3-3.5
MMscfd with 30-day averages ranging from 2.1-2.9 MMscfd. The fourth
well was a single offset, horizontal well
drilled with effective lateral length of
2,400 ft, located less than a quarter
mile north of the first three wells. But
Well D had significantly lower IP of 2.3
MMscfd and 30-day average production
of 1.2 MMscfd.
The initial comparative test results
are very encouraging and indicate that
the sequential and simultaneous fracturing creates a more complex fracture
network, which results in significantly
improved well production.
Williams continues to evaluate the
benefit of simultaneous fracturing and
has done more simo-frac jobs in other
counties with good results. Due to surface and lease constraints, many of the
simo-frac jobs are performed in wells
that are drilled from the same dual pad
and have well spacing on the order of
500-700 ft. We provide an analysis of
the simultaneous fracturing jobs completed to date in Parker and Johnson
counties.

and 185 active operators in
the Barnett shale, holding
permits for more than 4,500

‘Simo-fracs’
Simultaneous fracturing of
paired, offset wells is one of
the recent trends in Barnett
fracturing and is being increasingly used by many operators. In this technique, two
or more adjacent wells that
are roughly parallel to each
other are fractured simultaneously. The goal is to expose
the shale to more pressure and produce
a more complex, three-dimensional
web of fractures, increasing the density and surface area of the hydraulic
fracture network. The drainage area of
each of the wells is enhanced as the frac
fluid is pushed into the space between
the two wells that would not have been
fractured if the operator had stimulated
only well.3 4
Simo-fracs are expensive and require
more coordination, logistical work, and
a larger footprint than a single frac job.
At the same time, they are cost-effective

because the frac equipment is utilized
more efficiently; two wells are completed in 1 week instead of 2 weeks.
Initially, simultaneous fracturing in
the Barnett involved dual fracs, involving two horizontal wells close to each
other. Today, operators are experimenting with triple simultaneous fracs or
even quad-fracs.

fracture network was created near the
simultaneously fractured wells, contributing to significantly improved well
performance.
The graph in Fig. 3 shows that the
average 5-month production of the
36

three sequentially fraced, simo-fraced
wells was almost double that of standalone Well D. Well D was completed
and had first sales about a month later
than the three sequentially-fraced,
simo-fraced wells. Well B has the best
production among the three wells; it

may be draining a larger area to the
east. The Well A fracture network was
likely enhanced due the subsequent
simo-fracing of Wells B and C, resulting in enhanced production. Well C
has the lowest production among the
three wells, which may be attributed to
interference effects from the two offset
wells.
Successive stimulations using a
multistage treatment often show a significant influence of the previous stage,
including potential charging of the reservoir. The fluid from the previous stage
remains at a somewhat elevated pressure, pushing subsequent stages away
due to increased stress generated by the
volume of pressurized fluid.5
In general, reactivation of existing
fracture networks is thought to be less
beneficial than creating new fracture
networks.6 The production data from
the three wells appear to indicate that
simo-fracing results in more enhanced
fracture network and production gains,
compared to sequential fracturing.
This aspect needs to be further studied;
more data are needed to validate this
inference.
Table 1 compares the IPs of the
simo, sequentially fraced wells with the
stand-alone Well D. The average IP during the first 30 days shows a fourfold
improvement due to sequential and
simo-fracing. Based on IP/linear ft of
lateral drilled, the simo-fraced wells
showed a fivefold improvement.
Table 2 shows a summary of the
estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) and
recovery factor calculations. We based
EUR estimates on decline-curve analysis and estimated gas-in-place assuming a drainage radius of 500 ft from
the toe and the heel of the horizontal
wells.
We calculated the combined drainage area for the three wells (A, B, and
C) at 130 acres and the drainage area
for Well D at 85 acres. Based on a gross
reservoir thickness of 335 ft, a reservoir
porosity of 3%, the calculated corresponding gas-in-place (GIP) was 21.1

quadrant. Of the 104 groups, about
33% (34 groups) had wells drilled on
500-ft spacing. Due to shale thickness
and the presence of the Viola limestone
in the eastern part of Johnson County,
some of the operators began experimenting with 250-ft spacing. About
33% (34 groups) included wells drilled
on 250-ft spacing. About 40% (40 well
groups) were in northeast quadrant and
another 33% (34 groups) were in the
northwest quadrant of Johnson County.
The analysis of the Johnson County
production data for simo-fraced wells
indicated that time lag between first
sales of simo-fraced and stand-alone
wells was a key factor in the success of the simo-frac compared with
stand-alone well performance. The data
suggest that wells that had less than 3
months’ time lag between the simofraced wells and the stand-alone wells
had the best success rate to see incremental production and reserves due to
simo-fracing.
Fig. 10 provides a distribution of
the simo-fraced wells with fewer than
3 months of time lag between first
production from simo-fraced wells and
stand-alone wells, sorted by well spacing and quadrant. Comparing Figs. 9
and 10 reveals that only 20-30% of the
well groups fell in this category while
the majority of the simo-fraced wells
(70-80%) were drilled from 4 months
to 3 or more years after the stand-alone
well was drilled. We identified a few instances where the stand-alone well was
drilled later after the simo-fraced wells
by a different operator on an offset
lease. In such instances, the simo-fraced
wells did better than the stand-alone
well.
Fig. 11 provides a summary of the
production enhancement of simofraced wells over stand-alone wells
sorted by well spacing. We compared
peak monthly production, which for
most of the cases, is in the first or
second month of well life. The average
production enhancement was 56% for
simo-fraced wells over offset, nonsimofraced wells.

As expected, the greater the well
spacing, the lower the interference
and depletion effects. Thus, wells with
1,000-ft spacing had greater incremental gain compared with wells with
500-ft spacing, which did better in turn
than wells with 250-ft spacing.
Where the simo-frac wells were
drilled more than 3 months after the
stand-alone well, the production performance fell significantly and the average
IP of simo-fraced wells was less than
that of the stand-alone well (about 85%
of the stand-alone well). We attribute
this to possible interference and depletion effects, which might change the
stress profile near the wellbore. Again,
wells on 250-ft spacing were most
affected by interference and depletion
effects and had the lowest IPs compared
to stand-alone wells at 80%.
Fig. 12 provides a summary of the
production enhancement seen sorted
by quadrant for Johnson County. The
results indicate an average production
enhancement of 53% in simo-fraced
wells compared with offset, nonsimofraced wells. If a simo-frac well was
drilled more than 3 months later, the
average IP of the simo-fraced well was
87% of the stand-alone well.
Surprisingly, the lowest IPs of simofraced wells compared with standalone wells (70% factor) were in the
northeast quadrant in Johnson County,
which has generally had prolific producing wells. This may be because the
presence of the Voila barrier in most of
the northeast quadrant has resulted in
operators fracturing with high injection rates and there have been excellent stand-alone wells in the area, even
without simo-fracing.

43.3

Moreover, in some instances, the
stand-alone and the simo-fraced wells
(which were identified from maps) may
not have been completed by the same
operator. Again, the contrasting results
could be due to differences in frac design, injection rates, number of stages,
completion design, etc.

Observations
Simultaneous fracturing produces
a more complex web of fractures,
increases the surface area created by the
frac, and thereby enhances initial production rates and ultimate recovery.
Simultaneous and sequential fracturing in southeast Parker County doubled
production rates, on average, compared
to a stand-alone well producing from
the same leasing unit. The data appear
to indicate that simo-fracing results in
more enhanced fracture network and
production gains compared to sequential fracturing.
The analysis of the data from simofraced wells in Parker and Johnson
counties showed an enhancement in average peak IP rates of 21% to 55% over
stand-alone wells, for wells that had less
than a 3-month lag between first sales
from simo-fraced wells and stand-alone
wells.
On the other hand, if the time lag
between first sales from simo-fraced
wells and stand-alone wells was longer than 3 months, the simo-fraced
wells showed lower average IP rates
compared to stand-alone wells. Any
material production from the same
reservoir sink from interference and
depletion effects causes changes in
stress profile near the wellbore, which
affects the production performance of

Wytch Farm wireless
wellhead monitoring
network self-organizes
The smart, self-organizing, wireless transmitters installed recently
in Wytch Farm field
provide for continuous
monitoring of wellProduction
head pressures, thereby
eliminating the need for
operations personnel to read manually
wellhead pressure gauges.
Continuous monitoring eliminates
these daily visits to the wellheads and
enables operators to identify earlier
unusual readings and take action to
investigate and rectify faults before
they develop into serious problems,
according to Emerson Process Management, the company that furnished and
installed the network.
BP PLC operates the field from onshore facilities (see photo) that produce
from three separate reservoirs that extend offshore under Poole Harbour and
Poole Bay, Dorset County, England.

Wireless network
As part of a drive to improve operations, BP says that it wanted to increase
the available information, improve
worker efficiency, and remove the need
for operator rounds.
“Manual reading of pressure gauges
on the wellhead was identified as one
area we could improve, but we found
that wired transmitters were simply too
expensive due to the wiring infrastructure needed, so wireless is the perfect
technology for this application,” explained Chris Geen, BP manager,
The smart wireless network installed
on one wellsite at Wytch Farm includes
40 wireless Emerson’s Rosemount pressure transmitters.

Mounted on
each wellhead are
two transmitters.
A single smart
wireless gateway,
mounted outside the process
area, connects the
transmitters to the

A wave of ethylene investment will
take place in Asia during 2009-11 with
distinct peaks in early and late 2009. A
wave of aromatics investments will take
place in 2008-09.
The scale of new petrochemical
capacity will support pricing for Asian
naphtha through at least 2011 because

three key forces.
The first is the massive expansion of
Asian petrochemicals currently under
way. The second is the rapid emergence
of China as the largest petrochemical producer in Asia. The third is the
sharp rise in production capacity in the
Middle East.
China Petroleum & Chemical Corp.
(Sinopec) and PetroChina are the largest producers in Asia. They both have
an ambitious program of ethylene and
aromatics investments. Joint ventures
have been formed in China to further
develop the industry.
Sinopec is not only entering into
petrochemical ventures with foreign
partners, it is also building integrated
refining-petrochemical complexes in
partnership with ExxonMobil and Saudi
Aramco in Fujian and with Kuwait
Petroleum Corp. (KPC) in Nansha,
Guangzhou. In fact, joint-venture
petrochemical investments in Asia are
predominantly in China.
Condensate splitters will provide a
new increment of Asian naphtha supply.
The massive growth in Asian petrochemicals will support future naphtha markets in Asia as petrochemicals
depend more on naphtha supplies from
outside the region, primarily from the
Middle East. The naphtha market will be
strong despite competition for petrochemicals in Asian markets from low
cost, gas-based Middle East production.

Asian ethylene
Already a significant region in the
global ethylene sector, Asia is adding capacity at an unprecedented rate. Asia has
40 million tonnes/year (tpy) of ethylene capacity currently and is adding 24
million tpy during 2008-15 (Table 1).
This is equivalent to adding more
than 50% of base capacity during an
8-year period. A wave of addition takes
place during 2009-11 with strong
peaks in first and fourth-quarters 2009.
Figs. 1 and 2 show Asia-Pacific ethylene capacity additions by country and

The Indian petrochemical industry is
growing more slowly than the refining

important supplier of naphtha exports.
India, nevertheless, will still double
petrochemical capacity.
Asia’s ethylene industry continues to
be naphtha based rather than gas based.

Aromatics capacity growth is slower
than ethylene capacity growth (Table 2).
Asian aromatics capacity will nevertheless increase more than one-third vs.
current levels. Most capacity additions
will occur during 2008-09 (Fig. 5).
China will be responsible for half of
the expansion in 2008 and nearly all

China will almost double its capacity
and will be responsible for more than
half of all the capacity additions in Asia

Asian refining is becoming increasingly integrated with petrochemicals.
Refiners will try to diversify into petrochemicals to secure wider and highervalue markets for refinery products.
Petrochemical producers will try to
diversify into refining to secure a reliable source of feedstocks and markets
for byproducts.
Dependence on the traded naphtha
market for feedstocks exposes petrochemical producers to naphtha market

Two Asian condensate splitters started up in 2006. Five more condensate
splitters are scheduled to commission
during 2008-12 (Fig. 7).
In China, the CNOOC-Shell consortium started up its $4.2-billion project
in early 2006 at Daya Bay in Huizhou.
It included a 75,000-b/d condensate
splitter and condensate or naphtha
cracker. The heart of the complex is a
world-scale cracker producing 800,000
tpy of ethylene and 430,000 tpy of
propylene.
It is designed to feed naphtha as well
as condensate, the first of its kind in
China. The project may be integrated
with the CNOOC Huizhou refinery,
starting up in fourth-quarter 2008. The
refinery will process Bohai Bay crude,
which could provide naphtha feedstock
to the Shell-CNOOC complex.
In Indonesia, the Tuban condensate
splitter, owned by Trans Pacific Petrochemical Industries, also started up in
2006. Construction started in the 1990s
but was suspended at two thirds of

completion due to the Asian financial
crisis in 1998. The aromatics complex
was completed after a consortium of
Japanese banks granted financing.
Splitter output includes middle distillates, toluene, and xylenes. It does not
have ethylene cracking and is not linked
to a refinery.
In Thailand, the PTT-Aromatics
(Thailand) Public Co. Ltd. (ATC) Rayong complex will be transformed into a
world-class condensate splitting facility
serving a downstream petrochemical
complex. The complex will become the
third-largest aromatics facility in Asia.
The ATC condensate splitter in
Rayong, Thailand, was built in 1999 to
supply downstream aromatics because
the PTT refining system could not
manufacture enough naphtha. Paraffinic
naphtha is sold to other PTT ethylene
crackers nearby.
A second condensate splitter is being
constructed as part of a new arrangement that will integrate the PTT Rayong
refinery with ATC. This integration also

2008

creates benefits for the refinery, as well
as creating links between the new ATC
condensate splitter and new downstream aromatics complex.
The project, scheduled to start up in
third-quarter 2008, includes $387 million for a reforming complex, including
the condensate splitter and a catalytic
reformer to manufacture BTX for the
new aromatics complex. This complex
is a truly integrated refinery-petrochemical operation linking refining,
condensate splitting, and aromatics, and
providing feedstock for PTT ethylene
crackers.
In Japan, a new 60,000-b/d condensate splitter was added to the Kashima
refinery in 2008. Kashima Oil (a group
company under Nippon Mining Holdings Inc., which is affiliated with Japan
Energy) owns the splitter. The condensate splitter is part of the joint-venture
project between Japan Energy Corp.,
Mitsubishi Chemical Corp., and Mitsubishi Corp.

firms constructed a petrochemical
complex, which consists of paraxylene
production facilities (420,000 tpy), a
20,000-b/d catalytic reformer, and the
condensate splitter. The Mizushima condensate splitter is part of the integration
project with Nippon Oil. One of the key
goals is to increase further the level of
integration in the Mizushima region.
The start-up date for the 34,000-b/d
Mizushima condensate splitter in the
Okayama prefecture is second-quarter
2009. This is a venture with Mitsubishi
Chemical Holdings Corp. and Asahi

In South Korea, S-Oil will spend
$1.5 billion to build an aromatics
complex, including a 50,000-b/d condensate splitter, scheduled for start-up
in 2011-12. The aromatics complex
will have 900,000 tpy of paraxylene

capacity. This will be South Korea’s first
condensate splitter even though it is the

however, has grown only marginally in
recent years. Total naphtha consumption
in 2007 was about 850,000 b/d, and
will decline to about 840,000 b/d by
2010 and 800,000 b/d by 2015
Asia-Pacific imports will increase
to about 1.2 million b/d in 2010 and
1.38 million b/d in 2015 from 0.88
million b/d in 2007. India is the only
significant naphtha exporter that still
has a significant petrochemical industry, and is increasing exports as refining expansions outpace petrochemical
expansions.
Asia will experience growth of about
4.0% in naphtha consumption during the next 5 years, mainly due to the
expansion of ethylene capacity in China.
Naphtha output in Asia will grow at
about 2.8% during the same period.
China to a large extent, but particularly Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan,
will always depend on naphtha feedstocks. They will feel the most pressure during periods of higher naphtha
prices. Although naphtha prices will
strengthen in the long run compared
with current prices, there will be periods of weakness due to weaker gasoline
and chemical prices and the availability
of naphtha from west-of-Suez countries.
Producers in Australia, India, Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia may
have easier access to large quantities
of ethane recoverable from natural gas
reserves. This will guarantee lower-cost
ethylene production and sustainability as they switch feedstocks in future
capacity expansions.
Malaysia and Thailand are already
partly gas based. Thailand’s expansions
are either gas based or have gas-naphtha
flexibility.
Asian petrochemicals is undergoing
profound change led by massive growth
in Chinese and Middle East capacity and
the prospect of intense competition for
Asian markets from these Middle East
producers. The growth in Asian capacity lends sustained support to naphtha prices, and competition from the
Middle East will place margins under
pressure.
Low-cost exports from the Middle

East may force the cancellation of
projects in consuming countries due to
expensive gas or naphtha. Although this
theory may prove correct in the long
run, consumer countries may retaliate
by imposing tariffs and dumping regulations to protect their own industries.
It is clear, however, that the demand
for naphtha in Asia-Pacific will outpace
output in the next few years. ✦

is a growing private-sector automotive fleet. High GDP growth translates
directly into higher GDP per capita.

is the pipe WT and xs is the thickness
of the dry soil around the pipeline, beyond which the temperature of the soil
equals the ambient temperature. The

respectively.10-12
Equation 7 approximates the dry soil
thickness; i.e., penetration thickness.
As the compressed hot gas flows
in the pipe, the heat transfer rate will
be highest near the entrance. As the
gas cools along the line, the driving
force for heat transfer decreases and

accordingly the rate of heat transfer to
surrounding soil also decreases. This
in turn will reduce the penetration
thickness along the pipe, suggesting
the value of function f increases with
distance along the pipe.
Equations 5-9 calculate the function
f with experimental temperature and
pressure data for different segments of
pipeline.
The calculated values of function f
support the arguments used in postulating Equation 7. Equations 10-12 also
readily expresses function f.

Experimental data
Dividing an operating transmission
pipeline into segments of roughly 10
miles each allowed for experimental
calculations. Knowing the upstream
temperature, pressure, and gas composition allowed Equations 1-7 to be
solved successively for these pipeline
segments (Fig. 1).
Natural gas after compression at City
1 moved to Point B through three parallel lines; one 35-in. ID and the other
two 23.124-in. ID.
Equations 13-14 calculate volumetric
flow rates of natural gas through these
lines.
From Point B, the gas flows to City
2, Leg M, Point C, and so on. Table 1
shows composition of the flowing gas.
These calculations used the following assumptions:
• Pipeline elevation’s effect is negligible and the corresponding term in
Equation 1 is dropped.
• Upstream temperature at the
selected section for calculation is used

black powder formation and condensation and is being studied to suggest
operating conditions to avoid black
powder formation.

New microbiocide for water-based frac ﬂuid systems
New BE-9 bactericide can be used to
help control bacteria growth in water used
as the basis for fracturing fluids.
The company says the quick-acting,
long-lasting mocrobiocide helps control slime-forming, iron-oxidizing, and
polymer-degrading bacteria encountered
in oil field applications and offers the following features:
• It can be used for batch treatments
and on-the-fly treatments.
• Aqueous solution can easily be mixed
with water.
• Effective over the pH range 2-12.
• Testing shows the bactericide to provide fast and sustained kill.
• Compatible with scale inhibition

• Enables long-term protection since
the BE-9 agent is placed at fracturing rate
into the fracture network.
• Not susceptible to degradation by
ultraviolet light.
• Thermally stable.

‘Windfall proﬁt’
tax move leaves
reason for worry
The US oil and gas industry has reason
to feel relief and worry about Presidentelect Barack Obama’s decision not to pursue a “windfall proﬁt” tax on oil.
The Obama transition team let it be
known on Dec. 2 that it had dropped the
proposal from consideration. Obama earlier
saw it as a way to raise money to help
energy users hurt by high prices.
Industry trade associations appropri-

ately welcomed the decision. But they and
the companies they represent must stay on
guard.
That the idea of a windfall proﬁt tax had
any life at all speaks ominously about US
energy politics.
It indicates failure to see the importance of future oil and gas supply, which
can come only through investment, which
requires proﬁt, which taxation shrinks.
The mere mention of a windfall proﬁt
tax also shows an inability to learn from
history.
Congress imposed a “windfall proﬁt”
tax in 1980. The levy discouraged US exploration and development, thereby limiting
supply in subsequent years, and failed to
meet its revenue targets.
And it didn’t tax proﬁts, “windfall” or
otherwise. It taxed the difference between
the sales price of oil at the wellhead and a
statutory base price that proved monstrously difﬁcult to administer.
The windfall proﬁt tax of the 1980s was
a huge, deceptively named mistake that no
government should wish to repeat.
The Obama team shows no sign of
having learned the lesson. It decided not to
impose a windfall proﬁt tax, said an aide,
because the price of crude oil had fallen
and seemed likely to stay below $80/bbl.
The implication is that if crude prices
exceed $80/bbl again—which they will
someday, quite possibly during the Obama
presidency—a windfall proﬁt tax will receive new consideration.
That’s not good enough. It leaves a factor of uncertainty at work in planning for
investments crucial to US energy supply—a
price trigger for new taxation.
The Obama team would have done
American energy users and taxpayers a favor by saying it no longer was considering
a windfall proﬁt tax on oil because it was a
mistake ever to have done so.

A turbulent year
The waning year of 2008 is sure to be remembered as one of the most turbulent
in the history of the oil and gas industry, said energy analysts.
Some earlier assumed it would take years for crude to climb to the record high
of $147.27/bbl that it achieved in July on the New York Mercantile Exchange. At one
time, it also seemed inconceivable that a front-month crude contract could plunge
from nearly $150/bbl to less than $45/bbl in just 6 months. The January contract for
benchmark US sweet, light crudes dropped to $43.67/bbl Dec. 4—the lowest closing
on NYMEX since January 2005. “It is now becoming apparent that we live in a world
that is much faster moving and more interconnected than we appreciated,” said
analysts at KBC Market Services, a division of KBC Process Technology Ltd. in Surrey,
UK.
Energy markets suffered a psychological blow Dec. 1 when the National Bureau
of Economic Research (NBER) conﬁrmed the US economy has been in recession
since December 2007. NBER said US employment and incomes peaked last December; industrial production peaked in January; and sales peaked in June. “Almost
the entire developed world is, to all intents and purposes, deep in recession with
economic growth almost certain to be negative in 2009,” said KBC analysts. It’s the
ﬁrst time since World War II there have been simultaneous recessionsin the US, the
UK, Europe, and Japan.
Recession cuts demand
In the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc., analysts said, “The
global ﬁnancial meltdown is now likely causing meaningful oil demand destruction around the world. As a result, we are taking down our 2009 oil price forecast
from $90/bbl to $60/bbl. We readily admit that our visibility and conﬁdence in these
new estimates are very low. There are simply too many moving parts to get any
conﬁdence in near-term oil prices.” Still, they said, “Intuition would suggest that the
market’s recent rush to liquidity has caused oil prices to overshoot on the downside.
Unfortunately, we don’t know whether or not the market liquidation of virtually all
commodities is over.”
While short-term issues and energy prices remain anyone’s guess, “eventual
improvements on the demand side and additional OPEC cuts will turn crude prices
around by the second half of 2009,” said Raymond James analysts. The general consensus is that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will cut production
by 1 million b/d Dec. 17 in Oran, Algeria.
Oil markets are so focused on demand rather than supply that a production
reduction of 2 million b/d may not have any more effect on oil prices than a cut of 1
million b/d, said Paul Horsnell, Barclays Capital Inc., London.
Meanwhile, many observers suspect OPEC members have not been consistent in
complying with the 1.5 million b/d production reduction that began Nov. 1. Although
the group’s output declined in November for the third consecutive month, other
sources indicate only 66% of that most recent cut has been made, not yet enough
to offset the decline in oil demand. Total OPEC output was down to 31.2 million b/d
in November from 32.17 million b/d in October. The 11 OPEC members supposed to
comply with the group’s quotas produced 28.07 million b/d in November compared
with 29.06 million b/d in October.
Most reductions have been among some OPEC members bordering the Gulf of
Iran, with Saudi Arabia down almost 500,000 b/d. But no major reductions were yet
evident among economically troubled members such as Iran and Venezuela.
Horsnell said, “Ultimately we expect that the market will get overtightened, but
it will be an incidental effect of further severe disappointments in non-OPEC supply,
rather than the result of any direct OPEC policy to overdo the supply-side contraction.
In New Orleans, Pritchard Capital Partners LLC analysts said, “There is simply no
faith that global supply will tighten in the next 60 days, and the ‘great unwinding’ of
leverage is still an ongoing process. Oil prices are not likely to rebound until either
OPEC makes a substantial production cut or the economy begins to recover and
reﬁned product demand ﬁrms up.”
KBC analysts surmised, “Higher prices will inevitably return.” They expect world
oil demand to grow by 21 million b/d between 2007 and 2030 at an average annual
rate of nearly 1 million b/d, with China in the lead. “Total non-OPEC crude oil production will peak at the end of the next decade, and the world will need more oil from
OPEC—biofuels will barely make a signiﬁcant contribution,” they predicted.

Telecommuting beneﬁts outweigh negatives

D

ear Reader,
How effective would you be in your job if you worked at home?
Some of us would see productivity gains; others would fare better in an office setting.
The high costs of transportation fuel has many companies reviewing their policies for flexible
working arrangements and telecommuting. And with good reason.
The Consumer Electronics Association conducted a study recently that found that telecommuting
has “terrific” potential for reducing US energy consumption. Presently, 3.9 million people in the US work
from home at least 1 day a week. With the average
commute put at 22 miles, this saves 840 million
Telecommuting at least part of the time
gallons of gasoline per year—but that’s against total

US gasoline consumption of 146 billion gallons/year.
However, CEA also found that as many as 53
jobs…[a retention is probably the No. 1 staffing
happier at their jobs…[and]
million people could telecommute. Even at just 1
concern in the energy industry. So even if the energy savings and
day per week, that works out to an 8% reduction in
environmental benefits aren’t enough justification, that would be the annual gasoline use.
clincher in convincing management to be more flexible on the issue.
The study found that the current level of
telecommuting saves the equivalent energy of the
amount of electricity used by about 1 million US households each year. It also reduces carbon dioxide
emissions equivalent to removing 2 million vehicles from the road every year.
The CEA study took into account increased home-based carbon emissions resulting from
telecommuting and found that they were more than offset by the savings in gasoline consumption and,
in some cases, part of the energy consumption associated with commercial office space.
But if millions more workers started telecommuting 1 or more days per week, it would represent
a sea change in the American workplace. Concerns have been raised by management and staff alike
as to what widespread telecommuting would do to the workplace. Some managers remain concerned
about worker productivity and team interaction. Some workers worry about career prospects and the
intrusion of work into the home space.
A recent study by Penn State University revealed some interesting findings about the purportedly
negative aspects of telecommuting. The study found that, overall, it improved productivity, enhanced
morale, reduced conflicts between work and family, did not damage career prospects, and did not—if
limited to 1 or 2 days—harm workplace relationships.
The key finding of the study is that telecommuting gives employees a sense of freedom or greater
control over their work environment. From this the other benefits flow. There seems to be inherent
limits, however. According to the study, working from home more than 2 days a week, while still
benefiting the family, tended to have a negative effect on workplace relationships. And managers have
to adapt to this new workstyle; micromanagers will have the biggest challenge.
Still, the results of the study are clear: Telecommuting at least part of the time makes workers more
productive and happier at their jobs. As articles in this publication have shown, retention is probably
the No. 1 staffing concern in the energy industry. So even if the energy savings and environmental
benefits aren’t enough justification, that would be the clincher in convincing management to be more
flexible on the issue.
Sincerely,

Jamie Matlin,
Publisher & Director of Recruitment Advertising

SEG humanitarian initiative betters the world
as it enhances members’ careers

The Society of Exploration Geophysicists
Foundation has embarked on an ambitious
new program that deepens the foundation’s
involvement in humanitarian activity—and
by turn, SEG members’ commitment to giving
back to the world community.
Geoscientists Without Borders is designed to benefit
disadvantaged communities by funding projects that
apply geophysical and geoscience technologies to meeting
community needs. These humanitarian projects are
intended to create a brighter future for communities
in need while raising the profile of applied geoscience.
Universities and students will be heavily involved.

around 30 m depth—were mapped up to several
kilometers inland,” she said. “Based on the survey results,
recommendations were made to locate shallow, hand-dug
wells and medium-depth (60 m) water wells.”

Program details
Geoscientists Without Borders was largely the brainchild
of Craig Beasley, a Schlumberger executive who was SEG
president for 2004-2005 and who had exhorted his fellow
members to help the tsunami-devastated communities
of Asia with a call to action that “we have a significant
contribution to make as geophysicists.”
Schlumberger stepped up to launch Geoscientists Without
Borders with a funding commitment of $1 million in late 2007.

The seed for the program was planted in a response to the
horrific December 2004 Asian tsunami that killed more
than 230,000 people and displaced millions more.

The SEG Foundation program was launched in May 2008,
when the request for first-phase project proposals was
published and a July 2008 deadline set.

Geophysics played a role in helping recovery efforts of
local populations. For example, Germany’s BGR (Federal
Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources) conducted
a post-tsunami helicopter electromagnetic survey along
the coasts of Aceh, northern Sumatra, to discriminate
between fresh-water and saltwater aquifers, according to
Geoscientists Without Borders committee member Louise
Pellerin of Green Engineering Inc.

Program committee members have recommended the first two
projects for award, and those details were to be announced
after this publication’s presstime, at the foundation’s donor
luncheon at SEG’s annual meeting in Las Vegas in November.
The second round of first-phase proposals was due for
submissions in early October, and those recipients would be
announced in December 2008 or January 2009.

Qualifying projects will be required to demonstrate
that they will deliver humanitarian and environmental
benefits through application of geophysical and geoscience
expertise. These benefits could include a wide range of
projects, such as locating fresh-water supplies, pollution
remediation, natural hazard detection, manmade hazard

“We are proud to be able to help establish a program that
will focus on humanitarian applications of geoscience and
inspire students to use their skills in the geosciences to
make the world a better place.”

mitigation, sustainable resource development, and related
education. Anyone interested in applying for grants or
offering their services as mentors should visit the SEG
website at http://www.seg.org/foundation.
SEG is the global professional organization dedicated
to advancing the science and technology of applied
geophysics. It serves more than 30,000 members
and student sections at 204 academic institutions
worldwide. Members are involved in oil and gas, mining,
environmental, and other industries and research efforts
that benefit from applied geophysics.

Beasley also acknowledges the benefits to the industry that
result from petroleum professionals “giving back”
“Certainly having visibility in helping people improves a
company’s image—for any type of company,” he said. “But
one of the most important aspects of the Geoscientists
Without Borders program is that it establishes links on
a global basis among professionals, their companies,
students, universities, and people in need. This direct,
person-to-person contact can have a large effect on
perceptions of the petroleum industry.”

The SEG Foundation is the society’s charitable organization
dedicated to advancing the mission of the society through
grant and award programs. The foundation provides
scholarship opportunities, travel grants, and funding for
field camp programs and other projects of merit made
available to student members worldwide, as well as global
education programs for practicing members.

Dalton Boutte, executive vice-president of Schlumberger
and president of WesternGeco, underscored the
Geoscientists Without Borders program goals in
announcing his company’s funding commitment to the
SEG Foundation: “When we looked at the technologies we
have developed in the oil and gas sector and the potential
benefits to humanitarian efforts, we were interested in
enabling these applications through interaction with the
academic community, students, and the SEG Foundation.

Program beneﬁts
Beasley, a vice-president of WesternGeco, a business
segment of Schlumberger, and chair of the SEG Foundation
Committee for Geoscientists Without Borders, concurs
with the view that volunteer and charity work enhances the
career of a petroleum professional.

“We are proud to be able to help establish a program that
will focus on humanitarian applications of geoscience and
inspire students to use their skills in the geosciences to
make the world a better place.”

“Like many people in the petroleum industry, I have
had the opportunity to travel extensively and experience
firsthand the poverty in underdeveloped parts of the world,”
he said. “I think it has an effect on all of us when we live
and work with people coming from these circumstances. So
it is gratifying to do something that can directly improve
the lives of people in need.”

Academia beneﬁted
Students and universities also benefit from the important
role they will play in the success of the program. Students
will benefit personally through the experience of planning
and executing such projects.

According to Gabriel Borges, outgoing 2007 president of
the SEG Student Section at the University of Oklahoma,
“The program represents a great opportunity for
geoscience students to provide an early contribution to
the professional community while building their technical

Ten tips for retaining the neXt generation
Justin G. Roy, SullivanKreiss

Generations X and Y will continue to challenge
us as firm owners and managers; they will test
the waters and will sometimes go overboard.
However, their style is here to stay, and trying to fit
them into the what-worked-before model will only cause
headaches
Of course, we all know there are fewer people in the next
generations, making it that much more important to focus
on recruiting and retaining them. How can a firm overhaul
its entire approach to employee recruiting and retention
when half their staff is still sold on and used to the old
way? Baby steps, that’s how.
Here are some tips to implement into your day-to-day
retention strategy.
• Encourage them to use online social networks.
Take the site-block off of MySpace and Facebook
and LinkedIn. These sites offer more than one would
think; besides a good way to blow off steam during the
day (we all need a 5-minute break), they offer much
more. As online social networking grows, these sites
become much larger hubs of information, which, when
used correctly, can benefit your firm. The sites allow
people to keep in touch and see what their friends
and connections are up to. Within a few minutes, you
could know who is looking to make a job change (great
recruiting strategy), who is relocating to your area, what
firms are hiring, etc.
• Flex time. The option to come in early and leave early
or come in late and leave later is very appealing to
these generations. Some are trying to balance a social
life, while others are trying to balance their family
life. Offering your employees the benefit of arriving at
work an hour early or later gives them the flexibility
to schedule “life issues” such as daycare, eldercare, or
doctor appointments. With this flexibility also comes a
great benefit to the employer; it allows the employee to
be in the office for a “full shift” rather than having to
take extra time off for an appointment.

8

• Flex ofﬁce. “If I can get it done, and get it done well,
why does it matter where I work?” From working at a
coffee shop to working from home, the technology age
has allowed us to be more mobile than ever. Put together
a laptop, cellular telephone, and an internet connection,
and you have an instant office. In fact, most people will
never know that you are not in the office (with calls
forwarded to the cell phone).
• Reward based on merit. More and more people
in the workforce do not believe in the old equation of
time put in = promotion. They look at their individual
contribution to the company and to the team as a metric
for promotion and merit rewards.
• Be a socially conscious organization.
“Sustainability” and “green” are the hot words today. The
younger generations are very interested in social and
environmental happenings, both through the media as
well as through their employer. Communicate what your
firm does to better society and benefit the environment.
If you come up empty-handed, ask your employees
to come up with a program. It can be as simple as
volunteering at a reading program, spending a day
rebuilding or renovating a house for somebody in your
community, planning ways to make your office “green.”
Get everybody involved, and you create emotional
equity, making it a bit more difficult for these folks to
leave your firm.
• Training. Offer opportunities for your staff to further
their knowledge, for work-related functions as well
as career-focused training. People are always excited
and interested in furthering their knowledge and see
it as a huge benefit when a firm offers these courses.
If you cannot afford to hold them at your office, send
candidates out to a training program for a day or two
out of the office; when they come back, ask them to
make a presentation to the rest of the company about
what they learned.
• Management style. Flat-line management is top
choice lately, and for a lot of good reasons. How
many times have you been on top of—or at the

• Spend time and mentor.
Make sure you spend time
with every employee, on a
project, by the water cooler,
or even at a one-on-one
lunch. These conversations
will help others understand
who and what management
is and will help you create a bond with your employees.
The same adage goes with being a manager as it does
with networking: If you do not know three things about
the other person that are not work-related, then you
need to rethink your style.

• iPod Friday. Quite a few firms have been banning the
use of iPods in the office, noting the loss of collaboration
opportunities between colleagues, loss of communication,
and missed mentoring opportunities that could have been
seized by simply listening to more experienced staff in

use of iPods, saying they help concentration, allow them

Allow your employees to bring in and wear their iPods

Strategies to Address the Problem of Exiting
Expertise in the Electric Power Industry
Dennis Ray, Power Systems Engineering Research Center
Bill Snyder, Quanta Technology
Fig. 1. The aging of the utility workforce

The coming mass exodus of expertise in technicians and
engineers in the electric power industry is a well-expected
phenomenon. The loss has been the subject of workshops,
conferences, and symposia. It has been the focus of work
by industry professional societies, the National Academy of
Engineering, and the National Science Foundation. A better
understanding of the scale of workforce needs is being
studied: IEEE’s Power Engineering Society has begun a
detailed study of the workforce environment in the electric
power delivery industry in North America, as has already
occurred in other countries.
Manpower issues are increasingly listed among top
strategic concerns of industry executives. The principal
reason for the expertise exodus is the aging workforce.

700
Number of employees

Retirements, restructuring, and technology
changes are producing an accelerating exodus
of expertise from the electric power industry.
In this article, the authors review the major
approaches to address that challenge: managing
available resources, outsourcing, automating,
recording, and educating. The approaches
may all be used in a comprehensive strategy to
overcome exiting expertise. Each approach has
different implications for the resources needed
to be successful. The responses to date have not
been sufficiently comprehensive and of adequate
scale to address the looming workforce losses.
The authors contend that the needed leadership
by executives, policymakers, and academia
to comprehensively address the expertise
exodus challenge will be enhanced by a better
understanding of the diverse approaches and
of where effective intervention with sufficient
resources is needed.

Source: KEMA analysis

Fig. 1 illustrates the distribution of ages in the utility
workforce now and in 5 and 10 years. The Nuclear Energy
Institute estimated that 73.2% of direct employment in the
nuclear generation sector is between the ages of 43 and 57
and that 28% of those employees will retire within 5 years,
with another 18% leaving for non-retirement reasons. The
prediction by Keith Mueller is that the “tipping point”
in accelerating retirements will come at the end of this
decade. Some utilities report that as much as 40% of their
employees will be eligible for retirement in the next 5
years; however, the average may be more on the order of
20% over the next 5 years and 50% over the next 10 years.
Besides retirements, other reasons for the exodus include
industry restructuring and internal reorganizations.

Actions being taken in response to the rapidly approaching
tipping point are summarized in four approaches:
• Human resource management—identification
and evaluation of knowledge and skills at risk and
strategies to address the risk.
• Automating—applying technology to
complete tasks.
• Recording—putting knowledge into
accessible records.
• Educating—transferring knowledge to the next
generation of engineers and technicians.

The responses to date do not seem to be sufficiently
comprehensive and of adequate scale to address the looming
workforce losses. Technology deployment does not appear fast
enough. University power programs face significant shortfalls
in resources and faculty. In sum, the needed leadership by
executives, policymakers, and academia to comprehensively
address the expertise exodus will be enhanced by a better
understanding of the diverse responses and of where effective
intervention with resources can occur to make a difference in
addressing the expertise exodus problem.

The human resources issues associated with an aging
workforce require new practices and policies around
recruitment, retention, and other traditional human resources
concerns. For operations management, the challenges can
require daily juggling of resources and priorities based on
workload, emergencies, manpower availability, and many
other variables. These are not new challenges for operations
and engineering organizations; however, the added variables
of shrinking workforce and diminished organizational

e x p e r t i s e

POWER

experience compound current decisionmaking and
prioritization challenges—and thus increase the probability
of important work being done as a lower priority, to a lower
standard due to lack of time and expertise, or at higher costs.
These are not acceptable options, so risk mitigation is critical.
There are strong parallels to be made between the focus of
the industry today on asset management strategies and the
challenge the industry faces in managing the aging workforce.
Both issues are fundamentally rooted in the need to develop
operating strategies and practices that optimize the available
resources. This could mean scarce financial resources for
system expansion, improvement, and maintenance. It also
could mean scarce human resources (and experience) for
daily work management and task completion.
One asset management philosophy, described by Richard
Brown and Bruce Humphrey, identifies three primary
areas of competency for a robust asset management
structure: management, engineering, and information.
Workforce management must consider people, processes,

During the 1990s, in their efforts to contain costs and
increase efficiencies, utilities endeavored to “reengineer”
business processes, and replace or install information
technology systems to support the newly designed
processes. The practice of “reengineering” evolved to
“business process management,” and then to “operational
innovation.” The concepts underlying these practices have a
place in the overall strategy to manage the aging workforce
challenge. Activities such as codification of information,
knowledge management system creation, business process
redesign, work process automation, and outsourcing are
all elements of a comprehensive strategy. The issue for
management is how to best use these tools and activities.

and technology. To optimize the human capability within
the organization, that capability must be inventoried and
evaluated. In addition, an assessment is needed of the
business processes and technologies supporting those
processes. This comprehensive evaluation offers both the
challenge and opportunity to identify operational strengths
and weaknesses and to prioritize the areas
requiring immediate action. As with asset management,
workforce management requires a comprehensive
understanding of the current condition, the areas of
greatest risk, and the timing of required actions.
Management skills
Operations management today faces the challenges of
workforce attrition, aging physical infrastructure, rapidly
changing technology, increasing customer expectations for
reliable service, and continuing cost pressures to maintain
acceptable financial performance of the company. Significant
workforce attrition due to retirements is an additional factor
to be addressed as part of a holistic management approach
to business operations. Such a comprehensive approach
involves the study and consideration of all tools available
to management to meet the company objectives, not solely
the human resources component. The business processes
and technology currently in place combine with the human
element to create a complete business operations and
management system. When addressing a specific change
in one element of the system, it is necessary to consider all
elements of the system. Attrition due to an aging workforce
can be a driver for improving overall operational efficiency
through a comprehensive review of how people, processes,
and technologies are used.

14

Outsourcing
Utility companies have used outsourcing as a tool to
supplement the permanent workforce and manage peaks in
workload. Here, outsourcing refers to temporary employees
and contract labor forces. For example, utilities often
supplement construction and maintenance forces with line
construction contract companies. The contractors can be
used as workload dictates, and the company workforce can
be used primarily for critical operations activities. Similarly,
temporary workers have been used to supplement many
operations functions when workload dictates the need.
As a temporary workload management option, outsourcing
has been a normal operating process. But what about
outsourcing work as a permanent operating practice?
Can this be successful? Is it confined to specific functions,
and what are they? How do we determine when and how
to apply outsourcing as a primary tool for workforce
management? These are all questions that should be
answered for outsourcing to be a more permanent solution
to workforce attrition due to aging.
Because retiring employees often have an interest in
continuing their professions, outsourcing sometimes
takes the form of contracting with former employees. This
approach avoids significant loss of institutional knowledge,
but it creates a change in the fundamental business
relationship between company and employee. While this
can be a non-issue, it must be addressed to ensure thorough
understanding of the expectations of both parties.
Complete outsourcing of selected business processes is an
option in addressing exiting expertise. As illustrated in Fig.
2, certain administrative functions are already outsourced
by many utility companies, and because the industry

spends an estimated $19.1 billion on selling, general, and
administrative functions, there are many vendors who
offer comprehensive outsourcing options. The outsourcing
of engineering and operations activities is more complex,
however, because those activities involve critical tasks
associated with electric system integrity.
Task and skill analysis
As utility companies evaluate their needs, resources,
and capabilities, they ultimately consider the tasks to be
performed within an organization and the skills required
to proficiently execute those tasks. This is fundamental
job-task analysis. Most often the existing paradigm is to
base workforce planning on in-house execution of the
expected or average work load and to manage workload
peaks by exception, either through overtime, temporary
personnel, or contractors. This is a tried and proven
approach, but not necessarily the most effective approach
when considering limited resources and lack of requisite
skills in any given task area. The challenge is to consciously

e x p e r t i s e

POWER

and actively evaluate specific job requirements to determine
what workforce management philosophy best suits the
needs of the company or offers alternatives that facilitate
achievement of multiple operating objectives.
In the utility industry this may involve determining which
operating tasks contractors can perform and which tasks
company employees must always perform. The determinants
may be issues of safety, security, knowledge, or skills, among
other considerations. In an engineering organization, for
example, this may involve decisions on whether company
employees, contract engineers, or consultants should do
design, planning, or forecasting tasks. The analysis also
forces consideration of what skill level is required of in-house
employees for specific processes and job tasks.
A structured approach to process analysis involves evaluation
of the business process and tasks from several perspectives.
One approach is a formalized job-task evaluation that
includes assessment of what tasks are priorities, what skill

level is required, and how often a task is performed. Once
these parameters are established, an evaluation can be made
of what would be the most efficient and effective manner

tasks and options for completion.

For example, a low-complexity, high-frequency, highpriority process would be an excellent candidate for
system automation. Consider remittance processing as an
example of a process that meets this description. Every day,
companies handle thousands of customer payments that
require immediate handling to properly reflect the customer’s
payment as well as to optimize revenue collection for the
company. This process was automated years ago in most
utilities and has evolved to electronic payment capabilities
to further accelerate the process. Automated meter reading
is an example of a current generation business process that
is being evaluated against these criteria with decisions being
made on how to best allocate limited resources. In the past, a
primary driver for initiating process change was improving
the efficiency and reducing the cost of operations. With the
aging workforce, the driver for initiating process change is
different, but the manner in which the issues are addressed
can be similar, if not the same.
As with all elements of work management and manpower
planning, there is no one right solution for all operations.
The framework for analysis, however, is useful in forcing
discussion and rigorous consideration of all options
available to management to meet overall business
objectives. At the very least, the evaluation provides inputs
to a business decision process addressing the optimal
utilization of financial resources.
The evaluation of work processes, options for carrying out
those processes, and overall effectiveness of the organization
provides information for a business case analysis. Again,

16

applying the premise that the objective is optimal resource
utilization, the analysis must consider the question of
effectiveness of resources consumed, or more directly, what
“bang for the buck” is being achieved. Is it more effective
to buy an employee’s services with all the additional costs
of training, benefits, and facilities, or is it more effective to
buy services from a vendor? Or a third option may be to
buy a technology to do the work. All of these issues carry
different weights and priorities in different companies, and
management must determine what best suits their culture,
business model and service delivery objectives.
Automating
One of the process management options to be considered,
as illustrated in Fig. 3, is automation or the application of
technology to complete tasks. A comprehensive evaluation
of technology available to support business processes is
a fundamental element of process design and, in the case
of replacing an aging workforce, technology can be an
important element of a comprehensive strategy. Recent
industry events as well as operating policies mandated by
legislation demand more sophisticated technological tools
and solutions in the industry.
As processes and operations become more dependent
upon automated solutions, the importance of human skills
to use and support the technology increases significantly.
It is not enough to understand the business processes,
rules, standards, procedures, or science associated with
a job function. The employee must also have a working
knowledge of the technologies or applications that are used
to support or perform the job functions. Each technological
innovation requires some new degree of skill by the
employee using or depending on the technology. Even
without an aging workforce issue, the increasing use of
technology for operations and management demand new
skills in the workforce
The aging workforce again may be the catalyst for automation
that, until now, has been considered too expensive, too
complex, or just too new. As the aging workforce “tipping
point” approaches, management should consider what
additional business functions or opportunities exist with
the application of a particular information technology. With
the automated meter reading example, if the intent is simply
to perform the meter reading function as a cost-reduction
initiative, the business case is generally weak; however, the
business case is improved when management considers

e x i t i n g

that value of the expanded functionality available through
the technology for load control functions, customer data
gathering, and a number of other activities that could drive
additional business revenue opportunities or reduce other
costs in addition to the labor for reading the meter.
Utilities have over the past decade greatly increased the use
of new technologies in operating processes. Automation
expenditures—about $700 million in 2005—will fall into
two principal areas: real-time automation and controls, and
geospatial and field automation. Expenditure growth rates
are on the order of 20–30% per year. Geographic information
systems, substation automation (SCADA), AMR, mobile
work management, outage management, load control
systems, and CMMS are all widely deployed in the industry.
A common issue, however, is the integration of the
various applications both from an information technology
perspective and a business process perspective. Many
automated systems have been implemented to support a
narrowly defined process that is confined to one function
or organization. The future need to address the exiting
human expertise as well as the need to be operationally
efficient and effective will drive an integrated approach
to technology across all operational functions and
organizations. This requires a high-level technology
roadmap that identifies the overall strategy and direction
for using automation in the organization. Developing
the roadmap is another fundamental element of a
comprehensive business operations plan.
The financial evaluations of new technology applications
also require a slightly different approach compared with
traditional methods. Cost-benefit analyses would show
that the costs of many automated tools are still too high to
justify their adoption. In using automation to replace aging
workers, the analysis must go beyond the immediately
identifiable costs and consider the implications of
not implementing the technology for the future. The
technology business case must quantify and evaluate this
risk factor in order to fully address the issue.
Implementation and operational reliance on technology
or automation presents human resource issues in the
areas of recruitment, retention, and employee skills. As
companies work to recruit and retain new workers, they are
continually competing for technologically savvy workers
who do not think of the electric utility industry as a center

E n er gy Wo r k f o r c e

e x p e r t i s e

POWER

of sophisticated technology applications. How much
more successful can utilities be in recruiting and retaining
workers if the technology used to engineer, operate, and
maintain a power grid is leading-edge, both for the industry
and in development of automated tools in general? It is
safe to assume that the odds of attracting technical talent
will be improved. There is no question that “Generation
Y” workers expect to be involved with technology both
as a tool for their work and as the subject of their work,
so any business that does not have a high component of
technology in their work will be less attractive to the best
and the brightest employees of the future.
Recording
The retention of knowledge held by workers about to retire is
an immediate concern and a challenge for utility companies.
Before a knowledge retention program or activity can
begin, the company must have some sense of what is critical
knowledge and where it is held. The task to understand
these issues is daunting and, in many companies, is without
process or precedence. Some early mover companies have
explored this issue for a number of years and have developed
effective process models for determining what is critical
knowledge and who has it. In most cases, the activity to
address knowledge retention involves a comprehensive
organizational survey activity, coupled with a welldefined process for recording, cataloging, and storing the
information acquired through interviews and surveys. How
this is done is a function of the culture and practices within
the specific company. In all cases, however, there is a strong
management commitment to provide the time and resources
to make the process successful.
D.W. DeLong presents a four-pronged strategy for dealing
with knowledge retention in an organization (as illustrated
in Fig. 4). This model calls for a multi-dimensional

approach to knowledge retention that is customized to the
individual company’s needs, capabilities, and culture and
has the long-term commitment of management.
Perhaps most significant in DeLong’s knowledge retention
strategy is the component of knowledge recovery. The
need for knowledge recovery initiatives recognizes that,
regardless of systems and processes and procedures, some
critical institutional knowledge will undoubtedly be lost
with exiting workers. It is imperative that companies
acknowledge this and have an active strategy to deal with
lost knowledge. That strategy may involve hiring retired
workers as consultants or contractors or using expert
consultants to address specific issues. In any case, the
company must be prepared with a strategy and action plan
to mitigate the impact of knowledge loss. Technology can
be a key component of an effective knowledge retention
strategy. Various knowledge management programs and
applications are available “off the shelf ” today, as well as
customized solutions. For operating utility companies,
however, the most effective initiatives for knowledge
retention will likely be in areas other than a technology
for knowledge retention and management. The operating
systems used in the business, as well as ongoing mentoring
and training of new workers, will be the primary vehicles
for retention of information for daily operations.
Education
Education is making a critical contribution to addressing
the exiting expertise problem. Industry is enhancing
in-house education capabilities and working with
education organizations to develop new approaches to
life-long learning and to educating the next generation
of technicians and engineers. Universities are altering
their curricula to respond to the new skill and knowledge
requirements of today’s engineering workforce.
Yet major concerns remain about the sustainability of
university power programs. The good news is that the
number of undergraduate and graduate students has probably
bottomed out or even started to grow after reaching a high in
the early 1980s (although the recent growth in the number
of graduate students at US institutions may be offset by
declines in international student applications due to US visa
barriers and preferences by international governments for
their students to get graduate degrees in their home countries
to avoid “brain drain”). The bad news is that the growth in
students is probably insufficient to meet the coming demand.

18

Worse yet, the university infrastructure for supporting that
growth is weakening. The major US power programs are
not adding new young faculty members at a rate sufficient
to make up for the anticipated loss of retiring faculty
just at the time that major losses will be occurring in the
workforce. The following section addresses the problem of
sustaining university power engineering (PE) programs
Sustaining university power programs
To understand what is required to sustain university power
programs, it is useful to understand the core decision
influences affecting decisions to become a PE student or
faculty member and interactions between faculty and
students. A simple model of the interactions may be useful,
as illustrated in Fig. 5. What this model shows is that
universities, industry, and government can—or indeed
must—contribute to sustaining university power programs.

Assuming for the moment that the objective is to fill Jobs
in Industry (as shown in Fig. 5) to address the exodus
of expertise, it is necessary that potential PE students
consider PE as a career. Since the decision to enter into a
power program, whether as an undergraduate or graduate
student, has to be made in advance of actually going on
the job market, perhaps by as much as 4 years, student
perceptions of future Job Opportunities are important.
They will consider the number of potential job openings,
the challenge and career progression opportunities, salary,
job security, among other factors. Ross Schifo outlined
a comprehensive “professional core values model” that
describes factors that someone might consider in choosing
PE as a career.

e x i t i n g

Potential PE students will also consider the quality and
cost of the education that they will get. Will the tuition be
worth it? Three basic considerations will be the perceived
Program Quality, Curriculum Relevance, and Tuition
Cost. For a potential graduate student, the availability of
Graduate Support will be a prime consideration.
Students taking a Job in Industry will help with the expertise
exodus problem directly. However, sustaining power
programs requires new faculty. Graduate students at the
doctoral level may also consider the possibility of becoming
PE faculty members and enter the pool of Potential PE
Faculty. This pool is also composed of people in industry
with doctorates who want to go back to academia.
A graduate student’s decision to actually pursue a PE
Faculty position will be influenced by a number of
factors. Foremost, there have to be PE faculty positions
available. There are few such positions opening up for
entry by young faculty. The Support of Dean and Faculty
engineering programs has been difficult to obtain in recent
years; they are cutting back on power programs because
of greater research funding opportunities in other fields,
reduced stature of PE as an engineering field due to the
misperception that significant new innovations are not
needed or anticipated, and perceptions about low student
interest in the field.
Even if a position is available, a Potential PE Faculty
member must consider the likelihood of getting tenure.
That likelihood is based on the understanding of the
Support of Dean and Faculty, anticipated opportunities
for Research Support, and Institutional Expectations
regarding teaching load and tenure requirements, among
other considerations. Without Research Support, the young
faculty member will not be able to establish the research
and publishing record necessary for tenure. And that
research support needs to be sufficient to carry graduate
students through their own program: the young faculty
member-graduate student relationship is synergistic,
with each relying on the other for reaching their separate
objectives: tenure and graduation. Faculty need to be able
to attract quality students for the graduate programs, and
the ability to provide Graduate Support is a critical decision
factor for the potential graduate student.
The fundamental interactions among faculty and
undergraduate and graduate students occur either in the

E n er gy Wo r k f o r c e

e x p e r t i s e

POWER

Classroom or on Projects and Theses. It is those interactions
that determine the quality of the education experience. And
the higher the quality of the education experience, the greater
will be the contribution that student will be able to make
in restoring expertise in the industry—and the greater the
likelihood of success of a graduate student as a PE Faculty
member. There is an axiom that says, “What goes around,
comes around.” In this case, a quality education breeds
quality teachers that in turn produces quality education. In
this circle, research provides support of faculty and graduate
students but also enhances the education experience.
What then is the fundamental basis of a sustainable power
program? It is the stature of the program in the eyes of
the Dean, fellow faculty members, industry, and students.
Major drivers of that stature are:
• Ample R&D funding, particularly of a nature
that gives graduate students support through
their program and produces new knowledge that
both solves industry challenges and advances the
quality of education.
• Ample attractive positions in industry that
motivate students to take PE courses and enter
into PE graduate programs.
• High quality and affordable cost of the education.
Producing next PE generation
Using the model given in Fig. 5, it is possible to see where
focus needs to be given to increase the number of PE
graduates to address the exodus of expertise.
Based on the model, a comprehensive strategy to attract
more students to the PE field would:
• Increase the number of Potential PE Students
• Improve power Program Quality and
Curriculum Relevance.
• Control Tuition Costs, perhaps providing targeted
tuition assistance when needed to advance diversity.
• Increase Graduate Support.
• Improve Job Opportunities.
• Improve the quality of interactions among faculty
and students in the Classroom and in Projects
and Theses.
To get more PE Faculty to sustain power programs, the
model suggests such objectives as:
• Increase Research Support.
• Increase support by engineering Deans
and Faculty.

Equitable and reasonable Institutional
Expectations, particularly of new faculty.

Importantly, the model reveals that industry, government,
and universities all have a role to play. For each objective,
strategies can be identified for each of the three vested
interests. For instance, more Research Support is needed
from industry and government to support faculty and
to enhance classroom and project learning experiences;
universities also need to look at new models of industrygovernment-university interactions to make that support
attractive beyond simply supporting power programs.
To get more PE Students requires that industry make Job
Opportunities more attractive relative to other fields, that
industry and government help support Tuition Cost and
Graduate Support, and that universities ensure that they
are offering the best possible education at an affordable
Tuition Cost.
Thus there exists a need for greater attention to the problem
of sustaining power programs while increasing interest in
PE education. A comprehensive strategy is needed with
collaboration among industry, government, and universities
to develop a plan for educating the next generation of
power engineers. As Schifo noted, such collaboration
needs to articulate a “compelling mission,” but with the
realization that industry, government, and university all
have something to bring to (and take from) the table.
Conclusions
The exodus of technical expertise is accelerating in
the electric power industry. Of the four approaches to
addressing this exodus described in this article, utilities
are probably most frequently relying on short-payback,
low-cost solutions, such as operations management
improvements, outsourcing with previous employees, and
in-house training programs. It is necessary to view the
exodus not as a short-term problem, but as a long-term
opportunity to rebuild the companies around the next
generation of engineers and technicians. Decisions on
investments in people are just as important as the decisions
on investments in the aging infrastructure.
A priority investment in people should be in the current
and potential organization leaders who demonstrate the
skills, capability, and forward thinking to envision and
create an organizational capability for self-renewal through

20

knowledge retention and transfer. This capability may occur
through direct human interaction and training, various
technological solutions, or most likely a combination that
supports the organization knowledge base.
The urgency for the investments in people is felt in
professional engineering meetings and in the workplace.
But the public discourse among executives and
policymakers does not reveal the same sense of urgency.
This is also seen in the declining level of research funding
of universities even though research is the lifeblood of the
research and education mission of universities.
The exiting workforce, the limited labor pool for
experienced workers, and the diminished pipeline of
newly educated engineers to fill vacant positions challenge
all electric power interests to evaluate new educational
methods and practices, new work processes, new
technology, and new methods for knowledge retention.
At all levels of the issue there is a need for comprehensive
strategies to address attracting and retaining more power
engineering students, to evaluate and integrate new
technologies into daily utility operations, and to develop
innovative operating models that incorporate the best of
people and technology to optimize the effectiveness of
scarce human and financial resources. —EW

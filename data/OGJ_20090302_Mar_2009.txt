drilling hazards, as discussed in an article in this week’s special
report on Practical Drilling Technology starting on p. 39.The other
article in the report discusses a nonaqueous drilling fluid with a
low-viscosity synthetic internal olefin base that resolved operational
problems in drilling tight gas wells in Western Canada.The cover

Salazar cancels oil shale lease solicitation
The US Department of the Interior will offer another round of
oil shale leases in Colorado and Utah and withdraw the former
Bush administration’s proposal for expanded offerings, Interior
Secretary Ken Salazar said on Feb. 25.
“We need to push forward aggressively with research, development, and demonstration [RD&D] of oil shale technologies to see if we
can find a safe and economically viable way to unlock these resources
on a commercial scale. The [RD&D] leases we will offer can help answer critical questions about oil shale, including about the viability of
emerging technologies on a commercial scale, how water and power
would be required, and what impact commercial development would
have on land, water, wildlife, and communities,” he said.
Salazar said he was withdrawing the previous oil shale RD&D
lease solicitation because it contained several flaws, including locking in low royalty rates that would shortchange taxpayers.
“The previous administration offered their RD&D oil shale leases just days before leaving office, made the parcels four times the
size of the current six RD&D leases, and then locked in low royalty
rates and a premature regulatory framework for those leases. If oil
shale technology proves to be viable on a commercial scale, taxpayers should get a fair rate of return from their resource,” he said.
Offering leases for 640 acres instead of 160 acres was likelier to
provide sufficient reserves to support a commercial operation, BLM
said on Jan. 14 when it announced the proposal that Salazar withdrew. The new lease would go to applicants not using technologies
used in the first round of oil shale leases, it said at the time.
Salazar said DOI has submitted a notice, which will appear in
the Feb. 27 Federal Register, asking the oil and gas industry, local communities, states, and other stakeholders for their advice on
what the terms and conditions of the second round of oil shale
RD&D leases should be. Comments will be accepted for 90 days.
“Following that, the department will move ahead with a solicitation for RD&D leases, based on sound policy and public input. This
will help us restore order to a process that, under the previous administration was turned upside down. We look forward to hearing
from the public, industry, and local communities as we move toward
offering a second round of [RD&D] leases,” the secretary said.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

National Energy Board (NEB).
The current global recession should not bear too heavily on
the growing demand for natural gas in the long run. Countries are
scrambling to secure new sources of gas, “and LNG is definitely in
the running,” NEB reported in a recent energy market assessment.
“LNG provides an option to diversify and enhance the reliability
of natural gas supply, but ultimately it’s the market conditions, stakeholder involvement, and contractual arrangements that will set the
extent of LNG imports,” said Gaetan Caron, NEB chair and chief executive. “In North America alone, the supply of LNG is projected to
exceed 5% (5 bcfd) of the total natural gas requirement by 2020.”
LNG was once considered the most likely source to offset the
continued decline in production of conventional gas, but the expected increase in LNG imports has not yet materialized, said NEB.
In North America, shale gas and other unconventional gas resources have filled part of the gap.
The only Canadian facility equipped to import LNG is the Canaport regasification terminal in St. John, NB. It is expected to become operational this year and will serve markets in Atlantic Canada and New England, where LNG has historically provided up to
25% (184 bcf) of the annual gas requirement.

Indonesian watchdog urges LNG contracts review

Indonesia Corruption Watch (ICW) has urged Indonesia to review contracts on Tangguh as well as Senoro LNG sales and expose
the price formulas transparently, according to a press report.
Bisnis Indonesia said a review by ICW shows that the state received 440.44 trillion rupiahs ($37.4 billion) from LNG sales in
2000-08, while ICW calculates the amount should have reached
515.04 trillion rupiahs, a 17% difference.
The state has incurred the losses due to the lack of transparency
and accountability in the management of the extractive industries,
especially the oil and gas industry, according to Firdaus Ilyas, coordinator of ICW’s data and analysis division.
“The government has never been transparent in explaining their
formulas to calculate prices in the closed sales contracts,” Firdaus
told reporters in Jakarta.
“The prices have also been below the market prices. Contracts
on LNG sales from Tangguh and Senoro really incur losses to the
NEB: LNG demand grows in world market
state. This should be reported to the public,” Firdaus said.
The LNG industry will capture a growing segment of the
He said the profit split is 65% for the state and 35% for the partner
global market as demand for natural gas increases, said Canada’s contractors, some 5% lower for the state than “the usual” 70%. ✦

110 m thickness and the presence of a gas-water contact.
Woodside requires the extra gas to secure its proposed second
LNG train at the Pluto project and roll over the construction workforce currently constructing the project’s first train on the Burrup
Peninsula near Karratha.
Martell-1 was drilled with the Atwood Eagle semisubmersible
to 3,330 m TD. The find is 100 km northwest of Pluto field. It will
be followed up with further drilling on this structural trend later
in 2009.
Woodside is operator of WA-404 and has a 50% interest in it.
Hess Exploration holds the remaining 50%.

Chevron says Wheatstone can support LNG
Chevron Australia’s wholly owned Wheatstone LNG project
off Western Australia has moved a step closer to commercialization following the company’s announcement that the Wheatstone
and nearby Iago fields hold sufficient gas resources to support a
two-train export LNG development onshore and a domestic gas
component.
This assessment comes after a successful seven-well exploration
and appraisal program. Chevron declined to put a figure on the
reserve estimates.
Wheatstone field is on offshore permit WA-253-P and retention
lease WA-17-R and lies about 200 km north of the Pilbara town of
Onslow, Western Australian. The field was found in 2004.
Iago field spans two retention permits WA-17-R, owned 100%
by Chevron, and WA-16-R, in which Shell Development Australia
has a one-third share. This field was discovered in 2000.
Late in 2008, Chevron announced plans to locate the Wheatstone LNG plant at Ashburton North near Onslow. The company
expects to begin front-end engineering and design for the project
during the second half of this year.
In the meantime, Chevron says that, in support of the Wheatstone and Gorgon projects, it will use two drilling rigs to drill
multiple exploration wells in its operated acreage in 2009. One of
the rigs is the large Ensco 7500 ultradeepwater semisubmersible,
which has been contracted until the end of August 2010 at a day
rate of $550,000. The contract includes options to extend by 1-2
years.

Husky proves Liwan as giant ﬁeld off China
A delineation well has confirmed the giant nature of Husky
Oil China Ltd.’s 2006 deepwater Liwan 3-1-1 gas discovery in the
South China Sea.

ect for tender after it obtains results from the next appraisal well on
Block 29/26. Then the rig will drill other exploration wells.
The company previously said it could recover 4-6 tcf of gas at
Liwan, which it said opened a new hydrocarbon province in the
southwestern Pearl River Mouth basin. Husky Oil China didn’t indicate when Liwan production might begin.
The first appraisal well, drilled and tested in 1,345 m of water
350 km southeast of Hong Kong, was drilled to 3,887 m true vertical depth below sea level.
The Liwan 3-1-2 well, which cut 36 m of net gas pay in the
main reservoir zone, flowed at an equipment-restricted rate of 53
MMcfd, indicating that deliverability could exceed 150 MMcfd.
The predrill 3D seismic interpretation indicated a direct hydrocarbon response at the Liwan 3-1-2 location, which the company’s
analysis indicated was present over a majority of the 55 sq km
closure.
Block 29/26 covers 3,965 sq km and is one of six held by Husky Oil China in the South China Sea. China National Offshore Oil
Corp. has the right to participate in the Liwan development with
up to a 51% working interest. Husky Oil China also holds one exploration block in the East China Sea.
Liwan is 330 km east of Hainan Island and 195 km east of Husky’s Wenchang oil development (see map, OGJ, Dec. 17, 2001, p.
62).

Firms press Utica shale gas work in Quebec
Operators reported progress in unlocking gas from fractured
Ordovician Utica shale in the St. Lawrence Lowlands area of Quebec.
Forest Oil Corp., Denver, completed three wells at rates of
100-800 Mcfd each in spite of being unable to fully recover frac
fluids because the area lacks a coiled tubing unit. The company
tested each well, on a farmout from Junex Inc., Quebec City, in a
different section of the Utica shale to gather data for future completions.
“Although sustained rates were not as high as anticipated, the
tests have allowed Forest to identify the section of the shale it intends to target in future test wells,” Forest Oil said.
Forest Oil, which plans to continue tests after winter, said it
“proved the ability to successfully drill the wells horizontally and
pump multistage slickwater frac jobs without major operational
issues.”
Farmor Junex plans to drill two wells to Utica shale on its Nicolet land block in 2009 and frac the St-Augustin-de-Desmaures well
drilled near Quebec City in 2008.
Junex also participated in the Champlain 1H horizontal well
on its Becancour-Champlain acreage in 2008 but didn’t reveal the
results. The well has a 900-m lateral in the Utica shale. ✦

with the government.
However, even under the new dispensation, IOCs still will not
be allowed to book oil reserves—a sign the government intends to
reserve close control over the nation’s oil and gas.
The change of policy came after a 3-day meeting last week in
Istanbul between Iraq oil ministry officials and executives of 32
IOCs, among them Chevron Corp., Royal Dutch Shell PLC, and BP
PLC.
The meeting came amid Iraqi government hopes of having several agreements with IOCs in place by June for the development of
six oil fields and two gas fields, with work to start by yearend.
The policy reversal also coincided with an announcement by
Norway’s DNO that it is preparing for increased production as tiein operations near completion on the link between Tawke oil field,
in Iraq’s Kurdistan region, and the country’s northern pipeline system.
“As a result of the good progress made on the Tawke development during 2008, we are now preparing for increased production
at low cost from a substantial reserve base, without further investments,” said DNO managing director Helge Eide.
The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), following talks
with the Iraqi oil ministry last year, informed DNO that oil exports
from Tawke oil field could begin during the first quarter.
That decision also represented a change of policy by Baghdad,
which previously had said contracts awarded by KRG without federal government approval were illegal.

Processing
Total chemical unit’s explosion trial begins
Trial began Feb. 23 against Total SA’s fertilizer affiliate Grande
Paroisse and the manager of the company’s Toulouse plant where a
workshop containing waste ammonitrates exploded in 2001. The
company and manager are accused of homicide, causing injury to
workers, and involuntary destruction.
In what is considered one of the worst industrial catastrophes in
France since World War II, the Sept. 21, 2001, explosion killed 31
people, injured 2,400, damaged 30,000 buildings, and destroyed
1,000 jobs. While denying blame, Total and its insurance companies have distributed €2 billion in compensation.
The crux of the proceedings will be to determine the cause of the
explosion. Total and Grande Paroisse employees deny responsibility,
rejecting the premise that chlorine got mixed in with the ammonitrates, causing the explosion. A number of other possibilities have
emerged, including that it may have been an act of terrorism.
The trial is scheduled to last 4 months.

BP reports small ﬁre at Carson reﬁnery
BP PLC experienced a small fire on the conveyer belt in its coke
barn at the Carson, Calif., refinery, a company spokesman told OGJ.
No injuries were reported.
The fire happened late on Feb. 23, the spokesman said. “There
was no damage to the coker and the refinery continues to produce
coke. We don’t know what caused the fire, [but] an investigation
is under way.”
The refinery has a capacity of 275,000 b/d and produces gaso-

PTTEP unit lets contract for Montara project
Thai state company PTTEP Australasia has awarded a $116 million (Aus.) contract to Perth-based engineering and construction
firm Clough Australia for the installation of the Montara oil facilities in the Timor Sea.
Clough will transport and install the 750-tonne Montara wellhead platform deck and the 285-tonne mooring buoy with nine
associated mooring legs, about 26 km of infield pipelines, and the
100-tonne Swift field subsea manifold.
The Montara project includes development of the main Montara field along with the outlying Swift and Skua fields all lying
about 690 km west of Darwin in the Ashmore-Cartier region of
the Timor Sea. They lie in 80 m of water in the AC/L7 and AC/L8
production licenses.
Clough will use its upgraded Java Constructor vessel for the assignment. Work is scheduled to begin towards the end of June, and
the vessel will be employed for about 4 months, Clough said.
PTTEP expects the Montara to start producing crude and gas in
the fourth quarter.
PTTEP bought the previous 100% owner of Montara fields—
private company Coogee Resources Ltd.—in late 2008 for $170
million [$248.4 million (Aus.)] (OGJ Online, Dec. 30, 2008). ✦

Doosan lets contract for S. Korean coal gas plant
Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction Co. Ltd. has let a contract to Foster Wheeler Italiana SPA for the front-end engineering
design and technical services for a coal gasification island in South
Korea. The value of the contract was not disclosed.
Foster Wheeler will also help to secure long-lead items, develop
a capital cost estimate, and provide technical training on gasification and technical support during the engineering, procurement,
and construction phase.
This subcontract underpins a coal-based integrated gasification
combined cycle (IGCC) plant, which will be operational from the
end of 2014. Foster Wheeler will use Royal Dutch Shell PLC’s technology for the gasification plant to produce electricity from a solid
or liquid fuel.
“First, the fuel through gasification is converted to syngas,
which is a mixture mainly of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.
Second, the syngas is cleaned to remove sulfur compounds and
finally is converted to electricity in a combined cycle power block
consisting of a gas turbine, a heat recovery steam generator, and a
steam turbine” said Foster Wheeler.
Doosan is the EPC contractor for the IGCC plant. The project is
partially supported by the Korean government as a part of national
research, development, and demonstration projects.

YPF lets contract for delayed coking unit
YPF SA has let a contract to Foster Wheeler Iberia to design a
new fractionation unit and gas plant for the delayed coking unit at
the 189,000 b/d La Plata refinery in the province of Buenos Aires.
The two-drum delayed coker, which can process 27,925 b/sd,
will replace an old one. The fractionation section and gas plant is
expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter.
The delayed coker will use Foster Wheeler’s SYDECSM delayed
coking technology, which is a thermal conversion process that converts heavy residue feed into high-value transport fuels.
La Plata refinery has a conversion rate of 69%.

Nigeria’s Capital Oil plans Lagos reﬁnery
Nigeria’s Capital Oil & Gas Industries Ltd. plans to build a refinery in Lagos with the state government.
The partners want to form a joint venture and are carrying out
an environmental impact assessment for the 100,000-200,000
b/d refinery. They hope to lay the foundation stone by yearend.
Construction is expected to take 4 years.

Capital Oil, a private company, focuses on Nigerian downstream
activities and the importation, local sourcing, storage, marketing,
and distribution of petroleum products.
If the refinery is built, it would be a major initiative for Nigeria
as the nation has a total installed state-owned refinery capacity of
445,000 b/d. However, the refineries have not run at full utilization due to sabotage, infrequent power supplies, fire, poor management, and maintenance turnarounds. Consequently, Nigeria
imports most of its fuel products.
Nigeria National Petroleum Corp. is carrying out a turnaround and
maintenance program to restart the 100,000 b/sd Kaduna refinery in
March, a delay of 2 months on its revised deadline due to congestion
at the port in Lagos and to clearance of materials for imported equipment. Kaduna’s program was expected to be finished last August.
The Warri refinery was restarted in February 2008 after being idle
for 2 years following militant’s sabotage. NNPC’s subsidiaries operating the refineries have struggled to maintain them as they have limited
funds to do so. In addition, authorization for work that exceeds this
threshold requires separate negotiations with NNPC. ✦

Golar, LNG Ltd. agree on Gladstone LNG project
Golar LNG Ltd. has signed a heads of agreement with Liquefied
Natural Gas Ltd. (LNG Ltd.) that outlines covering joint development of a 1.5 million tonne/year LNG liquefaction plant at Gladstone, Queensland.
The plant will produce LNG from coalbed methane produced
from Arrow Energy Ltd.’s gas fields in Central Queensland.
Gladstone LNG Pty. Ltd. will build the plant, and Golar and LNG
Ltd. agreed to each take an equity position of 40% in the joint
venture. Arrow Energy has an option to take the final 20%. The estimated development cost for the LNG facility is $500 million.
The LNG will be loaded onto LNG carriers for export markets.
First production is currently scheduled for late 2012. The project
also offers expansion opportunities.
Under terms of the HOA, Golar will purchase the full LNG output from the project on a fob basis. Deliveries will employ at least
two of Golar’s existing LNG carriers, the company said.
Golar anticipates that, in addition to financing raised at the project level, it also will be able to raise financing in connection with
the offtake arrangements.

Shenzhen LNG terminal could cost $1 billion
A proposed LNG regasification terminal in China’s western
Shenzhen province, designed to supply Hong Kong’s CLP Holdings
Ltd., may require an investment of as much as $8 billion (HK) ($1
billion), according to local media.
The South China Morning Post, citing unidentified sources, said
CLP, which will own 24.5% of the project, would have to invest
about $2 billion (HK), while PetroChina Co. would put in $4 billion for its 51% controlling stake and Shenzhen Gas Corp., $2 billion for its 24.5% interest.
The cost is slightly lower than the $10 billion LNG receiving
terminal CLP proposed for South Soko Island off Lantau Island that

the company scrapped in August 2008 after the Hong Kong and
central Chinese governments agreed to source the fuel from Shenzhen.
“The project won’t be cheaper, because gas storage tanks will
have to utilize imported materials even though construction and
land costs may be lower in Shenzhen,” one source told SCMP.
The preliminary cost estimate of $8 billion marked another step
forward for the LNG project after the parties settled their stake sizes
and construction began 2 weeks ago on the 2,472-km West-East
gas transmission pipeline that will transmit gas to Shenzhen from
Central Asia.
Discussions were continuing on which party would be responsible for building a separate 16-km gas pipeline to transmit the fuel
to CLP’s gas-fired Black Point power plant in Tuen Mun from the
planned LNG processing plant in Dachan Bay west of Shenzhen,
sources said.
The processing plant will receive gas from Xinjiang in the northwest through the West-East pipeline and from LNG shipments from
overseas oilfields. PetroChina owns the 93 billion yuan ($13 billion) pipeline as well as its interest in the LNG terminal project.
A CLP spokeswoman told SCMP that details of the LNG project
such as gas pricing, volume, and timetable were still being discussed. PetroChina declined to comment.
A source estimated that CLP would likely source gas from the
planned LNG terminal and from smaller gas fields of mainland
offshore oil and gas supplier China National Offshore Oil Corp.,
whose existing supplies to CLP from Yacheng, Hainan, would run
out by 2013.
CLP’s Black Point power station consumes 3.4 bcm/year of gas.
Under an agreement between the Hong Kong and central Chinese governments, Hong Kong has been promised a supply of
at least 1 bcm/year by 2013 when the pipeline will come online. ✦

of 100 miles or less and top speeds well
under 60 mph. However, in California
Telsa makes an electric sports car that does
0-60 mph in less than 4 sec, a top speed
of 125 mph and a 221-mile range for
$109,000. The Lightening Car Co. in the
UK has a sports car that accelerates equally
fast with a 250-mile range and a 2008
price of £120,000.
But even the most impressive electric
car would likely be a hard sell to anyone
who has lived through the aftermath
of a Gulf Coast hurricane. When one
is sitting in the dark with a freezer-full
of rotting meat, nothing to open cans
of food in the pantry, no electric stove
to cook food if available, no air conditioning, no television, no electric fans,
windows open to sweltering heat and
mosquitoes, what is one to do with
the electric car plugged into the useless
outlet of what’s left of the garage? ✦

Energy transparency
The US government has new plans to spend tens
of billions of dollars on energy. Taxpayers deserve to
know how much energy this investment yields.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
of 2009 (ARRA) directs at least $65 billion to energy through 2019. Of that total, $22 billion is tax
relief. President Barack Obama wants to spend $15
billion/year on wind and solar power, clean coal,
advanced biofuels, and vehicle fuel efficiency.
The outlays will add to existing spending programs targeting a wide range of energy sources
and uses. In 2007, according to an Energy Information Administration study conducted that year,
US tax expenditures on energy totaled $10.444
billion. Big items on EIA’s list of special tax treatment in 2007 were the alternative fuel tax credit,
$2.37 billion, and alcohol fuel exemption, $2.99
billion.

Oil, gas breaks
For oil and gas in 2007, the biggest tax breaks
were the expensing of exploration and development costs, $860 million, and the excess of
percentage over cost depletion, $790 million. The
value of those breaks topped out at $10.9 billion
(2007 dollars) in 1981, a feverish drilling year.
Since then, tax-law changes have restricted use of
percentage depletion.
Well before the current spate of energy spending, therefore, the US was increasing governmental outlays on energy and conservation overall,
with a tilt toward noncommercial energy. Recently
enacted laws will amplify the effect.
The Energy Policy Act of 2005, according to
government estimates, added about $14.5 billion in tax expenditures on energy over 11 years,
including $4.5 billion for renewables, $3 billion
each for coal and electricity, and $2.6 billion for
oil and gas. The act also set a mandate for ethanol
in gasoline, which the Energy Independence and
Security Act of 2007 expanded to a peak of 36 billion gal in 2022. Because ethanol blenders receive
a tax credit of 45¢/gal, the growing mandate will
raise tax expenditures if Congress continues to
renew the subsidy.
So the ARRA’s preferential spending on energy
is nothing new. It’s just more—much more. The
18

government has been spending tax dollars on energy for a long time and lately has favored sources
other than oil and gas.
Promoters of ethanol and other energy from
renewable sources argue that new energy forms
deserve favorable treatment similar to past subsidies
for oil and gas. The proposition is fair, as far as it
goes. But recent treatment is anything but similar.
In their peak year for tax breaks, oil and gas
contributed the equivalent of 38.1 quadrillion
btu to US energy supply. The $10.9 billion in tax
breaks thus were worth 29¢/MMbtu. In 2007,
according to EIA, tax expenditures for alcohol
fuels totaled $3.2 billion, and ethanol production
represented 550 trillion btu of energy, making
alcohol tax breaks worth $5.82/MMbtu. So a unit
of alcohol energy in 2007 cost taxpayers 20 times
what a unit of oil and gas energy did in an aberrant year when tax breaks were at their highest
level in at least 3 decades.
There’s nothing inherently wrong with spending by the government on energy. The US needs
new supply from diverse, domestic sources, which
characteristically need help in their early years. As
the comparison between alcohol and oil and gas
tax breaks shows, however, it’s possible to spend
a lot of money on relatively small increments of
energy supply.

Dollars and supply
Taxpayers should know how much—or little—
their investment in energy contributes to total
supply. Most of them would be disappointed by
the record. Most taxpayers have no idea how much
their government spends on energy or how little
usable energy results from the expenditure. This
condition makes energy fertile ground for waste,
at best, and corruption, at worst.
In his push for an economic stimulus law with
energy spending at its core, Obama emphasized
transparency. He’s right. Americans deserve a regular accounting of what unprecedented government
outlays really achieve. The accounting should relate
dollars to real supply of usable supply for every
politically favored energy source. It also should say
who gets the money. Anything less straightforward
isn’t transparent enough. ✦

Expectations are falling for bitumen
production from the Canadian oil sands
as the international price of crude oil
languishes around $40/bbl, far below
levels required by new investments in
production and upgrading.
While once-stratospheric operating
costs have fallen in the major oil-sands
producing regions of Alberta, their slide
hasn’t matched that of oil prices, which
peaked last July above $140/
bbl.
Companies have delayed,
suspended, or canceled dozens
of upgrading and extraction

them have announced layoffs. Investment expectations are plunging.
With layoff announcements frequent, the unemployment rate in
Alberta is increasing. After several years
of booming activity and labor shortage, however, it remains relatively low.
The provincial government said the
unemployment rate in January rose to a
seasonally adjusted 4.4% from 4.1% in
December and 3.2% in January 2008.
The new figure for Alberta was still well
below the average unemployment rate
for all of Canada of 7.2%.

increasingly important to the Canadian
economy and global oil supply.
Inevitably, the weakening is taking its
toll on expected production.
Last month the Canadian Energy
Research Institute (CERI) cut forecasts it
made only last November for oil sands
production through 2030 (OGJ, Feb.
16, 2009, Newsletter; Fig. 1).
Senior Economist David McColl,
author of the outlook, said the new
projection uses a CERI database of
mining, in situ, and upgrader projects current as of Jan. 25. The forecast
assumes the industry requires a West
Texas Intermediate crude price above
$70/bbl (US) to resume growth. It
also assumes construction and operating costs rise in step with the oil price,
exceeding the $70/bbl threshold in
2010 (Fig. 2).
The price projections follow forecasts by the US Energy Information
Administration, with “rapid economic
recovery” and “prolonged economic
slowdown” projections reflecting a 25%
rise or fall in the price of crude delivered to the US relative to the “probable”
projection.
McColl’s study says oil sands projects
now in operation should be able to
withstand oil prices below $50/bbl for
a while.

oil prices were high and rising (OGJ,
Nov. 5, 2007, p. 34).

Weakening economics
All these trends weaken the economics of an industry crucial to Alberta and

In its 2008 project, CERI saw
potential for oil sands production to
exceed 5 million b/d by 2015 and 6
million b/d by 2030 (“unconstrained
projection” line in Fig. 1). Its 2008
reference case, however, was lower,
projecting output of 3.4 million b/d
of bitumen by 2015 and 5 million
b/d by 2030.
Its new projection (labeled “2009
economic slowdown” in Fig. 2) assumes the WTI oil price stays below
$60/bbl for most of 2009 and credit
markets continue to lack liquidity. Economic recovery begins in early 2010,
and liquidity returns slowly.

growth resumes only for established
projects and those with financing in
place before the credit collapse of
2008. Many projects will face a period
of reassessment and refinancing that
might last several years.
The new CERI forecast projects a
range of oil sands production: 1.9-2.9
million b/d in 2015, rising to 3.7-5.4
million b/d by 2030.
The projection calls for “modest”
spending on oil sands, McColl says, “at
a level that CERI believes the Canadian
economy can easily absorb.”
Labor and equipment availability
have combined with the economic
slowdown to trim $97 billion (Can.)
of expected spending from the 2008
reference case and $241 billion from
the “unconstrained projection” case
(Fig. 3).
McCall says the oil sands production outlook for 2030 won’t be known
with more certainty for “well over a
decade.”
He adds: “What is clear to us is
that, over the next few years, oil sands
production growth will be almost at a
standstill, and new capital investment
will collapse to levels not seen since
before the turn of the century.”
In 2000, he notes, oil sands investment was “just over $4 billion.”

CAPP’s adjustment
Like CERI, the Canadian Association
of Petroleum Producers has trimmed its
expectations for oil sands production
(OGJ, Jan. 12, 2009, p. 39).
In December, the group updated a
June 2008 forecast to reflect announced
changes to project schedules, reducing its “moderate-growth” case to
show continued but slower growth in
total crude oil production for western
Canada (Figs. 4, 5).
It now sees minimal production
change from the 2008 projection in
2008-12 but as much as 300,000 b/d
less in 2012-17.
Deferrals in upgrader projects, it
adds, will result in more output of
heavier blends and less upgraded,
lighter oil. ✦

Obama, Harper,
and oil sands

W

hen US President Barack
Obama and Canadian Prime
Minister Stephen Harper met Feb.
18 in Ottawa, they pledged to work
together on economic recovery,
international security, and clean
energy.
Their announcement of a “clean
energy dialogue” did not mention
Alberta’s oil sands, which increasingly supply oil to the US and also have
come under attack from environmentalists and some US congressional
leaders.
Obama acknowledged the problem in a Feb. 17 interview with
the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
“What we know is that oil sands
create a big carbon footprint,” he
said, adding, “So the dilemma that
Canada, the United States, China,
and the entire world face is how we
obtain the energy that we need to
grow our economies in a way that
is not rapidly accelerating climate
change.”
No country will be able to solve
the problem by itself, Obama said.
“So Canada, the United States, China,
India, the European Union, all of us
are going to have to work together
in an effective way to figure out how
do we balance the imperatives of
economic growth with very real concerns about the effect we’re having
on our planet,” he said.

sources of energy but also contain
the environmental damage of fossil
fuels, the better off we’re going to
be.”
Harper also did not duck the issue when CNN’s Wolf Blitzer asked
him a question about it on Feb.
18: “The fact is that there are high
emissions from oil sands extraction.
We’re involved, as is the government
of the United States, in funding
technological development, looking at things like carbon capture and
storage [CCS] as a way of minimizing or cutting down on some of
those emissions.”

Weyburn example

His joint announcement with
Obama specifically mentioned the
two countries coordinating CCS
demonstrations. It said this would
build on their experience with
pumping carbon dioxide from a
North Dakota coal gasification plant
for enhanced recovery operations at
EnCana Corp.’s Weyburn oil field in
Saskatchewan.
Harper said he expects CCS
projects to be very important for the
world from now on. Canada has been
wrestling for the past 10 years with
its desire to have a regulatory regime
which would reduce its carbon emissions, he noted.
“But we’ve been trying to do so
in an integrated economy when the
‘Clean energy mechanisms’
United States has not been willing
Obama said, “I think that it is
to do so. I think quite frankly the

fallen behind countries like German
and Japan in producing it. New plugin hybrids roll off our assembly lines,
but they will run on batteries made in
Korea.”
Obama told the joint session of the
111th Congress: “Well, I do not accept
a future where the jobs and industries
of tomorrow take root beyond our
borders, and I know you don’t either. It
is time for America to lead again.”
The nation would double its supply
of renewable energy within the next
3 years thanks to the recently enacted
economic recovery plan, Obama said.
“We have also made the largest investment in basic research funding in
American history, an investment that
will spur not only new discoveries in
energy, but breakthroughs in medicine,
science, and technology,” he said.
Thousands of miles of new power
lines will be built to carry electricity
from alternative and renewable sources
to consumers, and thousands of people
will go to work to make US homes
and businesses more energy-efficient,
Obama said.

Seeking carbon cap
The president said, “But to truly
transform our economy, protect our
security, and save our planet from the
ravages of climate change, we need to
ultimately make clean, renewable energy the profitable kind of energy. So I ask
this Congress to send me legislation that
places a market-based cap on carbon
pollution and drives the production
of more renewable energy in America.
And to support this innovation, we
will invest $15 billion/year to develop
technologies like wind power and solar
power, advanced biofuels, clean coal
and more fuel-efficient cars and trucks
built right here in America.”
His call for a carbon cap produced
different responses from the two leaders
of the US Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Chairman Barbara
Boxer (D-Calif.) applauded it. “President Obama has it exactly right: We
must ‘transform our economy, protect
our security and save our planet from

work with the president and answer
his call,” she said after the president’s
speech.
The committee’s ranking minority
member, James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.),
did not approve of the idea. “Climate
proposals should not be concealed under the guise of a deficit reduction tool.
We learned last year during the Lieberman-Warner global warming cap-andtrade debate that the massive proposal
represented the largest redistribution
of wealth in the government’s history
and predetermined winners and losers,”
Inhofe said.
While Obama’s remarks covered
several topics, his general theme was
that it was time for the US to make
tough, necessary decisions to rebuild its
economy after years of making the easy
choices.

jobs, new industries, and a renewed

will be another American century is

strengthen the economy, it is essential
that we make key investments to expand
access and make health care more affordable, make America energy-independent, and ensure a strong education
for all children. These investments will
help make certain America is a world
leader for generations to come,” she
maintained.
House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) said Congress would follow
through on the rest of Obama’s agenda
that he outlined in his remarks now that
the initial economic recovery legislation
has been passed. “I am also pleased that
he emphasized how important it is that
our nation return to budgetary sanity,”
he said.
“I thought the president gave a great
speech,” said US Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee Chairman
Jeff Bingaman (D-NM). “Clearly he has
a plan for how to solve our short-term
economic challenges, but he also has a
plan for getting our economic house in
order for the long term as well.”

‘Back up our promises’
Republicans said they generally
agreed with Obama’s main goals but
questioned his methods. “Middle-class
families and small businesses across our
nation are making sacrifices and tough

budget decisions. It’s time for Washington to do the same,” said House Minority Leader John A. Boehner, adding, “We
cannot afford to pile mountains more
in debt on our children and grandchildren in order to pay for a spending
spree that we simply cannot afford. It is
time for both parties in Washington to
back up our promises of fiscal responsibility with real action.”
Lisa Murkowski (R-Alas.), the Senate
Energy and Natural Resources Committee’s ranking minority member, said she
agreed with the president that energy
is a top national priority and believes
that developing a comprehensive and
balanced energy policy is imperative to
a strong economy.
“We can change our energy economy, but under the most optimistic
scenarios we will be dependent on
traditional energy sources during our
transition,” Murkowski said, adding,
“We need to develop alternative and
renewable energy sources, but we
also must make sure that any national
energy policy includes provisions that
encourage increased domestic production of the resources that we currently
rely upon to heat our homes, power our
vehicles, and grow our economy.”
Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah), a member of the House Natural Resources

Committee, said, “There is plenty to
agree with, as President Obama spoke
in broad strokes of general policy. But
one legitimate concern is whether or
not Democratic leaders in Congress, like
Nancy Pelosi, can produce legislation
that actually promotes solutions instead
of preventing them. The president
certainly got one thing right: America
is strong and we can get through this.
History has shown that we have been
through rougher times, even recently,
and come out all right, mostly because
of the strength and resolve of individual
Americans. We should remember that
real and permanent solutions come
from American families and businesses,
not from government.”
Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.), ranking
minority member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said the US must
solve problems in four increasingly
interconnected areas: nuclear proliferation, global energy security, global food
security, and climate change. “In these
times,” he said, “it is important that
our great nation does many important
things well, that we lead and do not default to only reacting to the latest crisis.
We need to dedicate our leadership to
significant issues and not be distracted
by petty differences or inconsequential
matters.” ✦

FERC submits seventh report on Alaska natural gas pipeline
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Two proposals for a natural gas pipeline from Alaska’s North Slope (ANS)
into Canada have advanced to the
detailed planning and project development stage, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission told Congress on Feb.
20. A third project has dropped out.
“At this point in project development, both Denali and TC Alaska are
now fully working towards obtaining
quality information to conduct their
respective open seasons to obtain shippers for their pipeline,” FERC said in its
seventh report to federal lawmakers on
the project.
The agency said since it submitted its last report Aug. 29, the Denali
partnership, which is comprised of BP
and ConocoPhillips, continued with the

an innovative, brand new approach to
energy production. I urge those opposed to development in ANWR to take
a close look at my proposal: It will not
harm ANWR’s tundra or ecosystem, or
the Porcupine caribou herd, which does
not travel on state lands,” Murkowski
said.

Gas pipeline warning
While there is still opposition in
Washington to opening ANWR’s coastal
plain to oil and gas leasing, the new
administration strongly supports efforts
to construct a gas pipeline from Alaska
to markets in the Lower 48 states, she
continued. But she warned that the rest
of the country won’t wait forever for
Alaska’s gas.
“Shale gas production is growing by
leaps and bounds. America will purchase its gas from the sources that are
ready to deliver it. If that’s not Alaska,
America will buy elsewhere. That will
really strand our gas, and it may do so
for an awfully long time,” Murkowski
said.

preﬁling process for its project with
FERC, performed some ﬁeld work, and
hired a contractor to evaluate a major
gas treatment plant planned on the
ANS. Denali formally applied to the US
Bureau of Land Management on Oct. 17
for a right-of-way across federal land in
Alaska, the report noted.
At the same time, the State of Alaska
completed the selection of TC Alaska,
which is comprised of two TransCanada
Pipelines Ltd. afﬁliates, as the licensee
under its Alaska Gas Line Inducement
Act program, FERC said. It said this
qualiﬁes TC Alaska to receive up to
$500 million in matching contributions
to cover costs of preparing a federal
application and obtaining related permits and access to streamlined state
administrative permitting procedures.
The Alaska Northwest Natural Gas
Transportation Co., which received ap-

proval to construct a gas pipeline from
Alaska during the administration of
President Jimmy Carter, notiﬁed FERC
in December that its sponsors concluded that their project was no longer
viable, the report continued. The company has dissolved and surrendered
the last of its permits and approvals,
according to FERC.
It said that during the open seasons
in 2010, “both Denali and TC Alaska are
expected to keep most of their information and decisions internal, yet they
will also continue to work with, and
inform various levels of government,
other stakeholders, and the public
about their projects.
“The commission stands ready to
do its part and reminds all stakeholders that construction and operation of
an Alaska natural gas pipeline is the
ultimate goal,” it added.

Two steps are necessary to get the
project moving, she maintained. The
first is to reach a consensus on a single
pipeline project now and not wait for
an uncertain open season next year. “In
order to arrive at that point, we will
need to bring the competing pipeline proponents (the producers who
own the gas, and the state and federal governments) to the same table,”
Murkowski said. The second step would
be to unite around fiscal terms related
to North Slope gas production, she said.
This is one case where Alaskans can’t
blame the federal government for delays
in a major capital project in the state,
Murkowski said. Whether it has been
to mitigate the project’s financial risk,
to streamline permitting, or to open a
federal coordinator’s office, the federal
government has stepped up when it has
been asked to, she indicated.
She also called for a resolution of the
impasse over prices for Cook Inlet gas
and construction of a new pipeline to
deliver gas to people who live in the
49th State. Both gas pipelines need to

move forward, said Murkowski. “If additional federal legislation is necessary
to push this project across the finish
line, I stand ready to press for it,” she
declared.
The Alaska Wilderness League immediately blasted Murkowski’s ANWR proposal. “It’s just Big Oil’s latest scheme
to get its hands on pristine, untouched
lands that millions of Americans have
fought for years to protect. No matter
how you dress it up, the goal is still to
develop one of the few truly wild places
we have left,” said Karen Miller, the
group’s government affairs director. ✦

“While the NGA provides a good
model, even it is incomplete, however,
as a comprehensive scheme for ensuring that energy infrastructure can be
constructed on a timely basis to the
needs of energy consumers,” Santa
said.
He said that despite FERC’s well-established authority under the law, states
and other federal agencies “retain the
ability to delay, deny, or unreasonably

condition other permits required under
federal law. Therefore, even though
FERC may authorize the construction of
an interstate pipeline based on a finding
that it meets ‘the public convenience
and necessity,’ an individual state can
still veto a multistate pipeline project by
denying or withholding certain permits.”
Notwithstanding the interstate commerce implications of this abuse of
authority granted by federal law, the
current statutory framework provides
no process for resolving such conflicts,

according to Santa.
“Consequently, we urge you to
develop an effective remedy as part
of electric transmission siting legislation that also can be applied to
interstate natural gas pipeline siting,”
he said.

“Further, the debate on fossil fuel

our understanding of the adverse effects
of their consumption on our atmosphere. Granted, our economy is still

dependency,” Farr continued.
“If the US goal of reducing carbon

by the same standards, the outcome has
been a total disservice for environmental concerns,” he declared.

Stuck in the 1960s
The same environmental activists
who oppose offshore oil and gas activity also are fighting alternative energy
development on the OCS and in the
southwestern US deserts, according to
Rohrabacher. “I think activists control
policy in America. Many of them are
very sincere, but they’re stuck in the
’60s. We have technology now that is
better. We haven’t had one new hydroelectric dam, nuclear power plant, or
refinery in 30 years. That’s been at least
$1 trillion out of our economy that
would have been there otherwise. We’re
in serious times now, and people need
to look at all the options,” he said.
The two House members agreed that
federal revenue from offshore energy
production should be shared with
coastal states, but they disagreed on the
way it should be handled. Farr said that
a portion should go directly into an
ocean trust fund based in Washington
that would “support the focused efforts
of coastal states, territories, and agencies in addressing the critical ocean
and coastal science, management, and
protection needs of our nation and is
essential to implement the many other
recommendations of the national ocean
commissions.” Rohrabacher said the
money should go directly to coastal
states and communities which feel the
impacts of offshore energy development.
Officials from five states also presented widely varying views. Ted Diers,
the coastal program manager in New
Hampshire’s Department of Environmental Services, who also chairs the
Coastal States Organization, said it is
essential that any offshore energy plan
that is formulated retain provisions
that protect state sovereignty, include
both renewable and traditional energy
sources, and direct portions of federal
revenue to both coastal states and to an
ocean management research fund.

take a much broader approach,” he
said, referring to the concentration of
military bases around Norfolk.
“We in Virginia were pushing this
policy long before $4/gal gasoline and
prior to the current large-scale recession in which we find ourselves. During
peak energy prices last summer, it was
estimated that this nation was spending nearly $700 billion/year importing hydrocarbon energy from outside

figure is surprisingly similar to the

oil and gas development, the 1969

Other businesses thrive
Garret Graves, director of Louisiana’s
Office of Coastal Activities, said other
businesses in the state have benefited
from the oil and gas exploration and
production off its coast. “After several
decades of production, we’re one of the
top tourist destinations in the world.
More than 24 million tourists visited
our state last year. Tourism in the New
Orleans area, including this week’s
Mardis Gras celebration, provides a $5
billion economic impact yearly. It’s one
of the state’s largest economic sectors
and generates an estimated $10 billion
annually,” he said.
In his written testimony, Graves
noted that MMS reported that spills
represent less than one thousandth of
1% of the more than 4.7 billion bbl of
oil which have been produced since

1980. The DOI agency also found that
there has not been an oil spill of more
than 1,000 bbl in the last 15 years from
a US offshore platform, and that during
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005,
there were no identified environmental
impacts from any OCS spills.
“As we look at our economic challenges, we should continue to look at
oil and gas as a source of our energy.
We have extraordinary resources out in
the ocean, which could be recovered,
and significant revenue that could be
generated. I urge the committee to look
at all the tools that are available and not
say ‘no’ to offshore production,” he told
the committee.

there. But as I’ve traveled my district in
East Texas, farmers tell me they looked
for a Prius tractor and couldn’t find one.
They also couldn’t afford diesel fuel and
gasoline,” said Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.).
“Listening to the discussion here, we
seem to agree on some basic concepts.
We need a comprehensive energy policy. We need to be less reliant on foreign
sources. Where we disagree is how we
develop that energy policy. No one has
developed a credible road map using all
the tools in our energy toolbox because
they try to eliminate certain options
such as leasing more federal lands to
generate revenues. I think the American
public is frustrated that we can’t do

She also suggested that the study’s
author did not understand the Renewable Portfolio Standards adopted by all
the WCI states.
“The level of renewable energy generation reflected in the WCI modeling
is a reflection of these standards,” Adair
said. “It is not that we intend to rely
solely on renewable energy and thus
weaken the grid.”

Bezdek concluded it is not feasible
to implement WCI. His analysis also
warned that the WCI plan could result
in negative consequences, including the
following:
• Increase energy costs that could
disproportionately harm low-income
and minority families, particularly
minority families, who are among the

most vulnerable to price shocks.
• Require the establishment of a
large and powerful new government
bureaucracy to set and monitor emissions caps.
“WCI should not be implemented

Bolivian president
accuses CIA of corrupting
state oil ﬁrm
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
The investigation into corruption
at Bolivia’s state-run oil company has
taken a bizarre turn, with the Bolivian
president and other government officials now claiming involvement by the
US Central Intelligence Agency.
“Unfortunately there has been a CIA
presence in Yacimientos Petroliferos
Fiscales Bolivianos [YPFB], and some
of our colleagues have been caught by
this foreign infiltration,” said Morales,
referring to the arrest of his friend and
former YPFB president, Santos Ramirez.
Local media said Morales gave no
evidence of the involvement of the CIA,
but quoted him as saying he could give
details and names.
In his speech, Morales also said he
would speak out against “how from
overseas, from the United States” legal
protection is being provided to the
“corrupt people who were inside YPFB”
with lawyers who are experts “in defending criminals.”
“It’s the group that represents the
savage capitalism, which represents
the large transnationals. They were not
interested in poverty, no interest for life
or humanity, but how to accommodate
the capital in few hands,” Morales said.
Separately, Bolivian Interior Minister
Alfredo Rada accused Rodrigo Carrasco
Jhansen, a former national marketing
manager for YPFB, of being a member
of Bolivia’s Comando de Operaciones
Especiales (Copes) and an informer for
the CIA.
“Rodrigo Carrasco Jhansen was a
member of Copes, a former policeman.
You draw your own conclusions. But I
can tell you that there is going to be no
cover-up here,” said Rada.
“We, as the state, are going to continue the investigations to determine

T

he UK’s Orkney Islands, which
lie just a stone’s throw off Scotland’s northern end, seem far away
indeed from any major contact with
the global oil and gas industry. But
that’s just an illusion.
In fact, the Orkney Islands are
playing a role, whether major or
minor remains to be seen, in helping to stabilize the global price of oil
these days.
While the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is trying
to boost oil prices by implementing
production cuts, its efforts are being

what this gentleman, Rodrigo Carrasco…was doing in YPFB,” Rada said.
Carrasco was arrested last week on
charges of concealing and “making off
with information” together with Julio
Anagua, the former director of administration for YPFB.
“Rodrigo Carrasco was caught redhanded, trying to remove information
from a computer…. In the second case,
manager Julio Anagua was caught redhanded tearing up a sheet of paper (documents),” said YPFB Pres. Carlos Villegas.

Corruption charges
Last week, Villegas said YPFB would
file a complaint against Ramirez and 16
of his associates on corruption charges
in connection with the signing of an
agreement between YPFB and Catler

Uniservice for the construction of an
$86.4 million gas liquids separation
plant in Rio Grande.
According to YPFB, the other defendants include: Julio Anagua Chumacero,
Esther Carmona Nogales, Daniel Alvarez
Gantier, Javier Guzman Navarro, Diego
Argandona Aramayo, Linneth Sclink Ontiveros, Marco Antonio Vega del Carpio,
Elizabeth Morales Troncoso, Ivan Garcia
Coca, Federico Galan Laime, Richard Aguilera Montesinos, Maria Cecilia Palacios
Jimenez, Pablo Valeriano Barroso, Ramiro
Lizarazu Orellana, Mauricio Ochoa
Urioste, and Juan Carlos Arellano Paz.
The complaint presented by YPFB to
Edward Mollinedo, head of the special
commission investigating the case, includes accusations of misconduct, abuse
of power, signing of contracts harmful

to the state, and other wrongdoings.
The scandal over corruption at YPFP
emerged in early February with the
murder of Jorge O’Connor D’Arlach,
head of Catler Uniservice, the firm that
last year won the $86 million contract
from YPFP for the construction of the
natural gas liquid separation plant in
Rio Grande (OGJ Online, Feb. 7, 2009).
O’Connor was killed when entering
the house of some of Ramirez’s in-laws
with $450,000 in cash, alleged to be
kickbacks to the now former president
of YPFB.
The case has been a major political
embarrassment for Morales, as Ramirez,
once described as one of the president’s
closest collaborators, was founder of the
party that currently rules Bolivia—the
Movement Toward Socialism. ✦

Last December, while attending a

“If there was no OPEC reductions

that revenues for Russia were at $40

at the conference, saying, “We are still

Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition
July 14 – 16, 2009

Calgary TELUS Convention Centre, Calgary, Alberta, Canada

Oil for tomorrow
THE PROMISE. THE PRACTICE.
Technologies developed for the oil sands and heavy oil resources of Alberta are vital to more than tomorrow’s oil supply.
They represent solutions to problems encountered throughout the oil industry.
Problems like managing costs during periods of lower oil prices, dealing with labor shortages, handling sulfur, controlling
air emissions, producing oil under difficult conditions, mitigating surface impacts, recycling produced water, capturing and
sequestering carbon dioxide, and more.
While it finds solutions to these challenges, the oil sands and heavy oil industry continues to develop unconventional
resources that are critical to meeting the world’s long-term needs for reliable hydrocarbon supplies.
Continued progress in oil sands and heavy oil producing technologies means progress in ensuring a dependable supply of
petroleum products at a time when traditional recovery methods are strained by additional demand from rapidly developing
industrial nations.
The Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition is the premier forum for the people who make this
innovation and progress possible.
Don’t miss this opportunity to present your product or service to a powerful, influential audience. Join the Oil & Gas
Journal and our conference attendees in Calgary this summer for the third annual Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies
Conference and Exhibition.

Borders & Southern Petroleum PLC
has identified three key play fairways
and two prioritized prospects from
initial review of 1,492 sq km of 3D
seismic survey shot in 2008 on its Falkland Islands acreage.
The survey, which covered less than
8% of the company’s licensed area, led
to identification of a seismic amplitude-supported Lower Cretaceous play
fairway, an Upper CretaceousLower Tertiary structural play
fairway, and a Tertiary seismic
amplitude-supported play
fairway. Multiple prospects
have been generated in the
fairways.
The company said, “The
3D has revealed plenty of evidence for
hydrocarbon generation and migration
in the area. This includes a chain of five
anticlines with gas hydrates located
above the crests or slightly displaced
on the asymmetric limb of the folds.
Additionally, there are many seismic
amplitude anomalies throughout the
survey area.”

islands. The frontier licenses are in 200
to 3,000 m of water.

Lower Cretaceous fairway

The Lower Cretaceous play fairway
comprises sandstone reservoirs in tilted
fault blocks and submarine fans.
The prospects are enhanced by seismic amplitude anomalies that display
a strong AVO response that could be
indicative of hydrocarbons.
“Our prioritized prospect within this
play fairway is the Darwin prospect,”
the company said. “In detail, it comprises two separate tilted fault blocks
which may be joined as one large
accumulation. This prospect is located
updip of a regional migration pathway
to a large source kitchen. Downdip of
the prospect location, the source rock is
modeled to be currently sitting in the
oil generation window, and therefore
oil is the most likely hydrocarbon phase
to be encountered.”
The prospect is structurally robust,
partly fault and dip closed. A strong
AVO anomaly is associated with the
target reservoir that clearly switches off
at the bounding faults and at a closing
contour on the dipping surface.
The total measured area for the AVO
anomalies is 26

leading to the possibility of stacked
reservoirs.

Structural play fairway
The Upper Cretaceous-Lower Tertiary structural play fairway comprises
sandstone reservoirs in major structural
closures measuring up to 150 sq km.
The company’s prioritized prospect
in this play fairway is the Stebbing
prospect with 85 sq km of structural
closure. The structure is a simple fold
with four-way dip closure with a thrust
located in its core.
A well-developed gas hydrate lies
above the crest of the fold a few hundred meters below the seabed. Potential
P50 recoverable reserves for the Upper
Cretaceous-Lower Tertiary reservoir are
570 million bbl of oil.
Additional recoverable volumes related to the possibility of stacked reservoirs occur deeper within the structure.
If this play fairway is successful, there
are numerous robust structural closures
within the portfolio that could deliver
very large volumes of hydrocarbons,
Borders & Southern said.

Tertiary play fairway
The Tertiary seismic amplitude-supported play fairway comprises Tertiary
deepwater distributary sandstone reservoirs partly stratigraphically trapped in
structural closures.
The play is marked by strong seismic
AVO anomalies that could be indicative
of hydrocarbons. The play extends over
several structural culminations including the Stebbing prospect.
Potential P50 recoverable volumes
estimated for the Tertiary reservoirs in
the Stebbing structure are 710 million
bbl of oil.

Prioritized prospects
Borders & Southern said the Darwin
prospect has been prioritized due to its
robust structure, its location at a migration focus in the basin, and the strong
AVO support.
There are good analogs for this
prospect in the Magallanes basin a few
hundred kilometres to the west, where

reported recoveries are about 6 billion
bbl of oil equivalent.
The Stebbing prospect is prioritized
due to the ability to test two separate
play fairways, strong AVO anomalies at
one reservoir level, and the presence of
a gas hydrate above the structure.
The Darwin and Stebbing prospects
are assessed as having the best chance of
success and will be progressed to drillready status. Other than sharing the
same source rock, they are completely
independent, allowing different-aged
rocks and different trapping configurations to be tested.
While these two prospects are
currently the preferred first tests, the

prospect inventory now has significant
depth and with additional work alternative prospects may be high-graded,
Borders & Southern said.
If success is achieved during the
initial drilling program, there is plenty
of scope for developing the prospect inventory outside the current 3D area. The
mapped play fairways extend outside of
the survey area and leads have already
been identified.
With the initial interpretation phase
completed, it is the directors’ intention
to seek partners to help finance drilling.
This effort will start in the first quarter
of 2009. ✦

Lag to ‘production effect’ seen in Rockies
A substantial lag could occur in
Rocky Mountain basins between the
time operators idle drilling rigs until
flush gas production from newer wells
begins to decline, one operator said.
Some in the US have forecast that
the sharp drop in the rig count since
fall 2008 might lead to the completion
of fewer new wells, releasing less gas
into pipelines and allowing gas prices
to strengthen eventually at equivalent
demand levels.
Joseph N. Jaggers, president and
chief operating officer, Bill Barrett
Corp., Denver, said Rocky Mountain
gas production could remain strong
through 2010.
Jaggers told an early February
conference call that the “production effect” could lag the rig count
substantially, especially in the Rocky
Mountain states even though the rig
count there is off by a greater margin

than in the US as a whole.
Through January, rig counts in Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming
are down 35% from a peak of 339 in
the fall of 2008, compared with a drop
of 28% nationally.
Much gas development in the Rockies is on pads with as many as 24 wells,
Jaggers noted.
It takes a week to demobilize a rig,
then 1-2 weeks to build pits for water
and move in tanks, and if a frac crew is
to run 7 frac stages/well on 20 wells
that’s 140 stages to be pumped. The
crew can pump five to six stages/day
and is permitted to pump only 5-6
days/week.
That indicates weeks of completion
work per pad, implying that it may
take the rest of the first quarter to work
through the inventory of completion
operations from the high rig counts
experienced last fall, Jaggers said. ✦

Chesapeake unconventional gas stake deep

equivalent in 2008 and detailed the
depth of the company’s commitment to

technologies were frac-packs and gravel
packs, deemed not appropriate for the
shallow depths and low pressure of A12
sands, Martin said.
As Nicol explained, industry has
had expandable screens available for
several years but Weatherford’s recently
developed 120-μm were the ones that
42

proved effective for A12 wells.
Nicol said that Weatherford has
installed more than 550 expandable
screens worldwide but most had larger
150-200-μm weaves.
He added, “The small size of the
sand grains in the formation made this
one of the most aggressive sand-control

applications yet performed using expandable sand screens.” The formation
is a very fine sand with an average grain
size (D50) of about 63 μm. About 30%
of the sand consists of fines less than 45
μm in diameter. Applications at this extreme end of the scale accounts for less
than 5% of all expandable screen jobs
performed by Weatherford, Nicol said.
Nicol explained “The small sand
particle sizes and unconsolidated nature
of the formation makes it very difficult
to control sand production. Doing so
requires finding a balance between the
screen’s weave size and acceptable solids
production—screens must control the
sand without becoming plugged by
smaller size fines or producing too
many of these fines to the surface.”
For these sands, Nicol said expandable screens were superior to gravel
packs because, as a surface filter-vs.-a
gravel-pack depth filter, there is less
chance of formation damage from fluid
invasion and less risk of sand control
plugging.
Martin added “The primary limitation of openhole gravel packing in the
A12 project was the low frac gradient
in the reservoirs, which increased risk
of fracturing the formation during
pumping operations.” Logistics for
gravel packing also concerned Chevron because of the long distance to
the shore base. Gravel packing would
have required intensive operations for
its downhole components and surface
equipment, Martin said.
Logistics also were a concern for
batch drilling and completing the wells,
he said.
Nicol explained that expandable
screens mitigated these logistic concerns in that the screens expand against
the formation to retain hole integrity
and control sand so that the operation
does not require pumping to place
gravel.
He added, “Weatherford’s experience
and data suggest expandable-screen
completions have low skin, typically less
than one, compared with gravel pack
damage that can exceed a skin of five.
Weatherford believes the expandable

systems should offer equivalent
sand control with higher well
productivity.”
Martin said that Chevron
rigorously tested various alternatives before determining to
use the 120-μm screens. The
testing included slurry tests that
pumped sand systems through
various screen samples to examine retention and plugging
tendencies.
Martin said “These tests showed
significant plugging of the screens and
the potential for severely limited well
production and longevity. As a result,
it was determined that sand control
would benefit from the borehole support provided by a formation-compliant
screen.”
Martin noted that conformance testing on a range of screen types and sizes
showed the wellbore support improved
success, with 93-98% of the formation
sand retained. “This testing validated
the importance of compliant screens
in preventing formation failure and the
remixing or resorting of sand particles
that could lead to plugging,” he added.
Nicol explained that compliant
expandable screen systems are designed to directly retain 10% of the
formation sand (the D10 designation)
and use larger size particles to retain
smaller sizes by creating a stable arch.
“This provides excellent sand retention
capability without adversely effecting
performance as the result of plugging
by the small particles,” he said
Chevron also tested products with
different weaves from several vendors
but found that Weatherford’s 120-μm
screen, the only expandable screen with
this weave size commercially available,
exhibited the best performance, Martin
said. ✦

lb/bbl of simulated drill solids (Table
3).
A comparison of the rheological
properties indicated that differences in
kinematic viscosity and chemistry of
the base fluid can have a large effect on
plastic viscosity (PV), yield point (YP),
and gel strength (Fig. 2). For example,
C14 IO with a low kinematic viscosity
(1.9 cst) resulted in low PV, YP, and gels,
whereas Mineral Oil A and Mineral Oil
B, having similarly higher kinematic
viscosity (3.4-3.5 cst), resulted in a
higher PV with slightly different YP and
gels.
In addition, the PAH content of the
base fluids may account for the difference in YP and gels observed between
Mineral Oil A and Mineral Oil B. The
former, having a high PAH content
(10,000 ppm), seems to enhance the
yield of organoclay more efficiently
than Mineral Oil B, which has a PAH
content of 600 ppm. By comparison,
the C14 internal olefin contains no
PAH.
For fluids without the simulated
drill solids, the effect of the base fluid
on rheology was similar to those with
drill solids. The lab testing indicated C14
IO as better technically compared with
other base fluids for management of
ECD and lost circulation because of its
low kinematic viscosity and rheological
profile. Mud formulation, product, and
product concentration, however, also
may affect rheological properties, thereby requiring further modification of the
C14 IO base fluid before engineering a
final formulation for the targeted field
application.
Compared with the original formulation used in the initial testing, the
final formulation contains less organoclay but a higher volume of wetting
agent and fluid-loss control additive.
This formulation helps reduce further
low-end rheology and gel strengths
while maintaining sufficient fluid-loss
control and solids tolerance.
Table 4 shows the final fluid formulation and its properties after heat aging
with solids contamination.

liability.
Thus, C14 synthetic olefins degrade
faster and more completely than many
other nonaqueous base fluids, according to the results of several tests
performed in a greenhouse lab.2 Fig. 4
shows gas chromatography scans of C14
hydrocarbons, containing 98% IO. The
chemistry of these base fluids allows
for degradation to nondetectable levels
through volatilization and bioremediation.
Laboratory tests simulated the degradation of the base fluid applied to drill
cuttings. The beginning concentration
was 10% total petroleum hydrocarbons
(TPH) by weight, which is a typical
value for TPH retained on cuttings that
shakers at the drilling rig remove.
The tests involved mixing the cuttings and fluid with peat moss and bacteria provided by the native soil from
the area. The experiment maintained the
mound moisture content at 70% field
capacity. The tests included turning and
aerating the mound once a week and
keeping the nutrients in the appropriate
range and ratio to ensure most efficient
growth and reproduction of bacteria.
Because of these efforts, the temperature remained high throughout the
experiment. Decreases in temperature
correlate to lower than normal degradation rates and the consumption of the
food source, thus proving the relation50

ship between temperature and growth
of the bacterial colony. The experiment
lasted about 35 days, at which time
only 0.49% hydrocarbons remained on
the cuttings. This trace amount eventually degraded to undetectable levels.
A recent study determined the toxicity of six different base fluids ranging from diesel to olefins. The study
involved initially applying each base
fluid to clay soil at 2% by weight and
bioremediating it for 90 days. Tests
of the resulting material on various
plant and animal species determined
its residual toxicity. C14 IO showed no
toxicity to barley, canola, or alfalfa in
either categories of emergence or root
elongation. This is true also for earthworm survival; furthermore, C14 IO was
the only fluid to demonstrate no toxic
effect in springtail survival.
Other fluids did not have the same
favorable effects on each of these species, proving that C14 IO-based fluid
is better in the category of nontoxic
effects.
Accordingly, complete degradation
and low toxicity make C14 IO fluids
and other fluids of similar chemistry
better suited for alternative methods
of disposal, such as composting, land
farming, vermiculture, and the use
of bioreactors. In the past, companies
considered attempts to bioremediate
other types of nonaqueous base fluids
unsuccessful due to excessively long

treatment periods and incomplete degradation.

This brief discussion indicates that
solubility of water in hydrocarbons
contained in crude oil is important
in engineering applications involving
processing, safety, hazard, and environmental considerations.

Correlation
Earlier works correlated the solubility of hydrocarbons and other chemical types in water as a function of the
boiling point of the compound.9 11 In
this work, we determined that the boiling point method was also applicable

for correlation of solubility of water in
alkanes:
log10(S) = A + B*TB (1)
where: S = solubility of water in
compound at 25° C., ppm (wt)
TB = boiling point temperature of
compound, K.
A = 2.2740
B = –9.70 E-04
The correlation applies to a range
for boiling-point temperatures of about
280 K. to 590 K.
The coefficients (A and B) for the
correlation were determined from
regression of the available data. In preparing the correlation, we conducted a
literature search to identify data source
publications.1-11 The compilations by
Polak and Lu,4 Schatzberg,5 Sorensen
and Artl,6 and Yaws10 were utilized for
solubility of water and boiling point
temperature.
We screened the publications and
copied appropriate data. These data
were then keyed into the computer to
provide a data base for which experimental data are available. The data base
also served as a basis to check the accuracy of the correlation.
The accompanying diagram shows
the solubility of water vs. boiling-point
temperature of alkanes. The graph discloses favorable agreement of correlation values and experimental data.

These indexes are published in the
ﬁrst issue of each month. They are
compiled by Gary Farrar, Journal
Contributing Editor.

Indexes of selected individual items
of equipment and materials are also
published on the Costimating page
in the ﬁrst issue of the months of
January, April, July, and October.

The accompanying table gives the results for solubility of water and Henry’s
law constant. In the tabulation, the results for Henry’s law constant are based
on water solubility and vapor pressure
at ambient conditions with appropriate thermodynamic relationships.10 The
presented values are applicable for water in a wide variety of alkanes (normal
and branching).
The results in an easy-to-use tabular format are especially applicable for
rapid engineering use with a personal
computer or hand calculator. The tabulation is arranged by carbon number
(C1, C2, C3, so forth). This provides ease
of use in quickly locating data using the
chemical formula.

Examples
The results for solubility and Henry’s
law constant are useful in engineering
applications involving water in alkanes,
per the following examples:
• Example 1. In hydrocarbon processing, hexane (C6H14) comes into contact
with water at ambient conditions (25°
C., 1 atm). The organic and aqueous
phases are subsequently separated. Estimate the concentration of water at saturation in the hexane after separation.
Substitution of the coefficients and
boiling point temperature into the correlation equation yields:
log10(S) = 2.2740 – 9.70
E-04*341.88 = 1.9423
S = 87.57 ppm (wt)
• Example 2. A hydrocarbon spill of
hexane (C6H14) into a body of water
at ambient conditions (25° C., 1 atm).
After separation, the concentration of
water in the hexane at the surface is
0.00033 mol fraction (xi = 0.00033).
Estimate the concentration of water in
the vapor at the surface.
From thermodynamics at low pressure, the vapor concentration is given
by yi = Hi/Pt * xi
Substitution of Henry’s law constant
from the table, total pressure (Pt = 1
atm), and liquid concentration into the
above equation provides yi =72.82/1 *
0.00033 = 0.0240 = 2.40% (mol). ✦

Applying scheduling
software to the design
stages of a complex multiproduct pipeline helps
make the finished line
Pipelines
safer, more reliable, and
more economic. Such
software allows verification and modification of preliminary design to ensure
the full functionality of the final plans,
including pump selection, before
construction.
The long distance, large diameter, multiple delivery points, and
variable hydraulic states of China’s
planned Lan-Zheng-Chang multiproduct pipeline complicate the
process of pump selection.
Designers based delivery plans and
dimensions of the LZCPP on expected
2015 market demand for products
along the pipeline, using scheduling
software to verify pump configuration.
Using the scheduling software in design
exposed irrationalities in pump selection, prompting adjustments.

Background

China University of Petroleum–
Beijing developed scheduling software
used in design of LZCPP. Operators can
schedule virtual shipments on the software platform by inputting profile data
of the pipeline (diameter, distance, wall
thickness, etc.), properties of the products, the pipeline’s initial line pack, the
transportation plan, and flow rates at
the line’s point of origin. The software
also uses start time, delivery flow rate,
and volume at all delivering stations to
draw a delivery plan.
LZCPP represents the first use of the
software in a design application, although it has been successfully applied
to operating a number of multiproduct pipelines in China, including the
Lan-Cheng-Yu pipeline,1 2 the Lu-Wan
pipeline, the Gang-Zao pipeline, the

short and the injection pumping capacity used in preliminary design is small,
requiring flow upstream of the station
be stopped to allow completion of injection. This interruption may increase
contamination costs due to the great
topographic difference between FX and
XY(S) stations (Fig. 1).4 5 Limited injection pumping capacity also requires
establishing a storage operation similar to that at ZZ station, for use when
90-octane gasoline passes the station.

Design improvement
Scheduling analysis allowed designers to adjust the initial design. They
first reevaluated their choice of pump
units, increasing capacity at ZZ station,
avoiding the need to build new floating
top storage facilities, and decreasing the
overall storage volume of the station.
They also decided to upgrade the injection pumps at XY(S) station, increasing that station’s input to the pipeline
and producing the same net storage
benefits as those found at ZZ station.
These pump unit adjustments satisfied the variable hydraulic state of the
pipeline and met its design requirements.

New software designed to help improve plant operations
The new Syncade smart operations
management suite is a class of real-time
production management software designed to help improve plant operations.
The modular, scalable suite extends the
value of PlantWeb digital plant architecture by integrating real-time intelligent
plant-floor data with procedural, off-line
and transactional plant business processes,
decisions, and asset management.
The smart operations management suite
is a replacement for the traditional clientserver, program intense manufacturing execution systems software. By contrast, the
Syncade suite uses the modular, scalable
Microsoft.NET framework-based software
to deliver ISA95 Level 3 standards-based
functionality.
The suite of software modules promises to provide easy, flexible, integrated
solutions in four performance enhancing,
functional areas: resource management,

operations optimization, integrated information, and quality and compliance.

Visor offers face protection
Designed to be lightweight and comfortable, the Venom face protection safety
unit provides workers with protection
against workplace hazards.
Venom visors and the Venom headgear
unit are available separately or as a combination package and are all American National Standards Institute Z87.1+ certified
and Canadian Standards Association Z94.3
certified by Underwriters Laboratories.
Visors are made of a 0.060 in. thick
polycarbonate material that’s been molded
into a fang shape for complete facial
coverage. Visors are available in clear, clear
antifog, and gray, as well as 3.0 and 5.0
infrared filter shades for protection when
cutting, brazing, or gas welding.

The headgear unit has an extra-soft
brow pad and nape strap and features a
three-part comfort adjustment system,
suiting Venom for extended or even all-day
comfort. The easy-to-use tension adjustment helps ensure that visors will stay in
place when raised.

From the Subscribers Only area of

Hasty taxes might
not be what people
of the future need
Raising taxes to fund uncertain beneﬁts
far in the future can be worse than rising
sea levels.
The politics of global warming largely
assumes that people have a moral duty to
act on behalf of future generations, which
obviously have no way now to express
their wishes.
Yet acting now presupposes knowledge
about those wishes. It also denies people

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

of the future options and wherewithal that
might make future environmental responses more efﬁcient that anything undertaken
immediately.
In a report distributed by the National
Center for Policy Analysis, David R. Henderson, a research fellow at the Hoover
Institution, says immediate action relies on
technology inferior to what should become
available in the future.
Furthermore, money spent on immediate responses might instead be invested so
as to increase national wealth. The forgone
return represents opportunity cost.
“Investments people make today are
likely to increase the wealth of their descendants, giving future generations greater
resources to exercise their preferences
regarding environmental protection,” Henderson says. “The higher the rate of return
that can be earned by investing a dollar
today, the more wealth future generations
are deprived of if the money is spent now.”
If the social cost 100 years from now of
carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere
is $300/ton, Henderson says, citing data
from Kevin Murphy of the University of
Chicago, the appropriate immediate tax,
if the prevailing interest rate is 6%/year, is
88¢/ton. If the prevailing interest rate is 4%/
year, the appropriate tax now is $5.94/ton.
Those values equate to 0.3¢/gal and 2¢/
gal of gasoline, the federal tax on which is
18.4¢/gal.
Modern politics won’t ﬁnd much use for
the suggestion that US motorists already
pay fuel taxes sufﬁcient to cover a generous assumption about the social costs of
carbon dioxide emissions a century in the
future.
But Henderson doesn’t stop there in his
challenge to political orthodoxy.
Noting that generations tend to be
wealthier than their forebears, he says,
“If the government taxes people today
explicitly or through regulation to reduce
climate change 200 years from now, the
government will be taxing the poor to help
the rich.”

Crude makes biggest gain of year
Crude prices shot up Feb. 19 in the biggest 1-day gain since 2008, carrying petroleum products with it, but energy prices retreated in the next session as markets
readjusted to continued low demand.
Benchmark US light, sweet crudes jumped by $4.86 to $39.48/bbl as the Energy
Information Administration reported commercial US crude inventories dipped
200,000 bbl to 350.6 million bbl in the week ended Feb. 13. The Wall Street consensus was for an increase of 3.2 million bbl. “For the ﬁrst time in months, we have
seen positive inventory data for crude,” said analysts at Pritchard Capital Partners
LLC in New Orleans.
“This is the third time crude has tested the $35/bbl price level and bounced. The
price action of crude and inventory data imply the [production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries] are beginning to work” with oil prices at
$35-45/bbl, they said.
The March crude contract expired Feb. 20 at $38.94/bbl while the new frontmonth April contract declined slightly to $40.03/bbl on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
In Houston, analysts with Raymond James & Associates Inc. predicted “a high
level of volatility will persist in commodity prices” as economic problems continue
to undercut demand, “which has dropped steeper and faster than supply has been
removed.” They said, “The unstable markets are a result of crude searching for a
price where sufﬁcient demand comes off the sidelines and absorbs enough supply
to produce a true equilibrium price. Since we are uncertain on the timing of a global
recovery that will ultimately translate into a rebounding level of gross domestic
product on a worldwide basis, we believe that the existing, steep contango market
will perpetuate as the front end of the curve is depressed by a lack of industrialized
growth and an unknown amount of excess crude hovering over the market.”
OPEC outlook
However, analysts at the Centre for Global Energy Studies (CGES), London, said,
“Although global oil demand has fallen rapidly, OPEC supply fell even faster in
recent months, removing the oversupply that emerged in the second half of 2008. It
is still unclear, though, whether the organization has actually turned lifters away, or
simply let its production follow falling demand from its customers.”
Reduction of Saudi Arabia’s crude production is nearing that country’s imposed
limit to satisfy its need for associated gas. Meanwhile, CGES analysts said, “Several
other members have yet to make any signiﬁcant cuts in their own production. By
January, OPEC had implemented some 2.3 million b/d of its agreed 4.2 million b/d
cut, with further reductions expected in February and March. Implementing the cuts
in full could tighten the market, but any price recovery would likely be short-lived,
triggering a further weakening of demand, at least until the global economy begins
to pick up again.”
CGES said it will be “almost impossible” for OPEC to raise oil prices “anywhere
near its desired level of $75/bbl” in this economic climate. “It may be that the best it
can do is to cut production in line with demand to prevent further falls in the oil price
until the economy begins to recover,” CGES analysts said.
Crude inventories at the key Cushing, Okla., delivery point remained ﬂat Feb. 13
while oil stocks along the US Gulf Coast increased by 2.1 million bbl. “Keep in mind
that the deliveries to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve will increase during March and
should eat into either the US Gulf Coast stocks or the ﬂoating storage stocks,” said
Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland.
Meanwhile, he said data from various sources indicate that destruction of gasoline demand might be starting to bottom. According to EIA, the 4-week average
US demand for gasoline average is now ﬂat to last year (on the revised basis) and
gasoline implied demand is up by 0.8%. The US Highway Administration indicated
the amount of miles driven by US motorists during December was down only 1.6%,
an improvement over the declines of 4-5% in recent months. The Northeast US was
actually up 0.5% from a year ago. “This improvement comes despite the rough
weather driving conditions and higher unemployment rate and needs to be taken as
a warning ﬂag that price does matter for gasoline demand,” Jakob said.
The latest MasterCard [Spending Pulse] report showed gasoline sales at the
pump to be up 1% in the 4 weeks to Feb. 13, providing a base case that the decline in
US gasoline demand has bottomed, Jakob said.

December 8 - 10, 2009
Shreveport, Louisiana USA
Shreveport Convention Center

The earliest efforts to produce unconventional gas in the U.S. can be traced to
Devonian shales in the Appalachian basin. Then, the Barnett shale stole attention
for more than a decade. Now, the Jurassic Haynesville shale play in Louisiana
and East Texas has burst into view as the next potential big unconventional
play. Alongside the Haynesville, the Devonian Marcellus shale has become a
primary objective in the Appalachian basin, where operators are also pursuing
numerous other shale formations.
PennWell Corp. and Oil & Gas Journal will hold a conference and exhibition
that focuses on the emerging eastern U.S. unconventional gas plays and their
operational differences and synergies. The conference and exhibition will be
held at the Shreveport Convention Center December 8-10, 2009.

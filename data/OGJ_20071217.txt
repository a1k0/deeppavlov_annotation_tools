COVER
Since 2002, Newfield Exploration Co. has drilled and completed
more than 200 wells in the Woodford shale play, now producing
more than 150 MMcfd. Long laterals and increased frac density
are improving capital efficiency—longer laterals could reduce
total number of wells needed for development.The company has
165,000 net acres, largely held by production, operates 13 rigs,
and is testing 40-acre spacing. Industry attention is increasingly
focused on unconventional gas plays, and Oil & Gas Journal’s
special report begins on p. 39 with the first article in a series on
unconventional gas technology. It’s followed on p. 46 by a study of
a newly developed natural gas production model, which estimates
world natural gas production will peak in 2043; conventional
natural gas production, in 2038; and unconventional gas, in 2060.

IDEAS PEOPLE WANTED
ENGINEERS / WORLDWIDE
Ever asked yourself how fish swim in sub-zero waters without freezing? We did. That’s
how we came up with the idea for a new chemical that stops hydrate plugs forming in
our deepwater pipes – based on a protein that engulfs ice crystals inside the fish’s body.
Fresh thinking, innovation, even leaps of imagination are part of our daily lives at Shell.
And we're always looking for creative people to help us tackle the world's biggest energy
challenges. Some call it engineering. We call it creative problem-solving.

General

Interest

Iraq reﬁnery attacked by rocket
Iraq’s Doura refinery burst into flames Dec. 10 after being hit by
a rocket, according to an Oil Ministry official.
Spokesman Asim Jihad said a Katyusha rocket hit a fuel storage
tank at the 110,000-b/d refinery at about 6 a.m., starting a fire that
sent a large plume of black smoke into the sky.
He said there were no casualties and the refinery’s firefighters
expected to extinguish the fire quickly. He did not report what effect the attack had on the refinery’s output.
The facility, just outside Baghdad, refines crude oil from the
north and south of the country to supply products to the Iraqi
capital.

N. Sea tax rules to be revamped, not abolished
Despite strong pressure from the oil and gas industry, the UK
government has rejected calls to immediately abolish the North Sea
Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) even though it announced a proposal
Dec. 6 to shake up tax rules and decommissioning rules to encourage continuous investment in the mature area (OGJ Online, Dec.
7, 2007).
Abolishing PRT immediately would create “a large number of
winners and losers, damage investor confidence, and fail to secure
a fair return for the UK taxpayer,” the government said. It has proposed, instead, some reforms to the PRT regime, including reducing the administrative burden of complying with PRT and providing operators with PRT relief for decommissioning costs.
Trade organization Oil and Gas UK welcomed the suggestions
but said that there are inconsistencies regarding the application of
PRT to decommissioning liabilities and tax relief. The government
is seeking comments on the suggestions by the end of January
2008.
It also has launched another consultation on the tax burden facing operators because of the fear that this is stopping forthcoming
investment. The deadline to submit comments on this and other
issues is June 2008.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

French President Nicolas Sarkozy sought to establish closer ties on
his first state visit to the former French colony.
Sonatrach will continue to supply LNG to Gaz de France during
2013-19 under an extended contract signed in Algiers Dec. 4.
The agreement, valued at €2.5 billion/year, means that Algeria will remain a key supplier, accounting for 10 billion cu m in
2006.
Gaz de France also hopes to receive the Algerian government’s
approval in early 2008 for its development plan for Touat gas field,
in which it holds a 75% stake, in the Sbaa basin. Investment is
expected to hit $1 billion, but discussions surrounding the construction of an 800 km gas pipeline are not yet finalized. Field
production is scheduled to begin in 2011.
In 2006 Gaz de France signed up for 1 billion cu m/year of gas
to be delivered through the proposed Medgaz pipeline, which is
to start deliveries in 2009. The pipeline will send Algerian gas to
Spain. Gaz de France has a 12% share in the project and a 20-year
supply contract.
Algeria’s state-owned gas and power company Sonelgaz let a
€1.3 billion turnkey contract to Alstom and Egyptian Orascom
Construction Industries to build a 1,200 Mw gas-fired power plant
in Terga, 600 km from Algiers. Operations are expected to start in
3 years.
Alstom will supply a full turnkey, combined-cycle power plant
integrating in-house core plant components built around its advanced class GT26 gas turbine with best operational flexibility, Alstom said.

France levies high-proﬁts tax on oil companies

France’s oil companies will pay “an exceptional tax” to help
fund a heating oil reserve granted by the government to low income households. The tax will be levied on the basis of 25% of the
provisions for high prices, which the companies have built up over
the past years.
The companies can either pay the tax directly to the state or to
the fund. They most likely will choose the second option, said JeanFrench companies sign gas deals with Algeria
Louis Schilansky, delegate general of the oil companies’ trade group
France and Algeria have signed several natural gas deals as UFIP. He told OGJ the fund could amount to €102 million. ✦

Petro-Canada to invest in Libyan exploration
Petro-Canada of Calgary signed an agreement Dec. 10 with Libya’s National Oil Corp. (NOC) for the two companies together to
invest $7 billion in exploration and development in the Sirte basin
of northern Libya.
Terms call for NOC to convert existing participation agreements
and old exploration and production-sharing agreements to six new

EPSA IV agreements. New agreements are to last 30 years compared
with an existing 2015 expiration date.
Petro-Canada agreed to pay 50% of development costs and will
receive a 12% entitlement share of production. In addition, PetroCanada will pay a $1 billion signature bonus with the first of three
payments due upon contract ratification, expected in 2008.
“Through these agreements we have achieved our long-stand-

ing objective of extending our partnership with NOC in Libya,”
said Ron Brenneman, Petro-Canada’s president and chief executive
officer.
Petro-Canada estimates gross resources of almost 2 billion bbl
of oil associated with the redevelopment program, which includes
pipeline and facility upgrades, development drilling, and waterflood expansion.
Currently, Petro-Canada’s Libyan concessions produce 100,000
b/d (gross). Under the new agreements, production from the redevelopment program is expected to double in 5-7 years.
In addition to the redevelopment costs and signature bonus,
Petro-Canada also proposes to invest $460 million in exploration
during 7 years in the Sirte region.

StatoilHydro ﬁnds gas in third Hassi Mouina well

Libya where it operates Block 65 in the same basin.
PGNiG will explore Block 113 in the Murzuq basin in western Libya, which covers 5,494 sq km. “The high prospectively of
this area is confirmed both by the adjacent existing fields and the
reported discoveries within this petroleum basin,” PGNiG said. It
plans to sign the exploration and production-sharing agreement
with NOC in the next 3 months.
Libya invited companies to bid for 41 onshore and offshore
blocks earlier this year to improve gas production to 3 bcfd by
2010 from 2.7 bcfd currently. Ghanem said more winners could
be announced in a week.

Total farms into Yemen blocks with Sinopec
Total SA gained a 40% interest in two onshore exploration
blocks in Yemen under a farmin agreement signed with Sinopec.
An exploration well is being drilled on Block 69 following the
acquisition of 2D seismic. The block spans 1,333 sq km and is
in central Yemen’s Marib basin, from which gas is directed to the
Yemen LNG plant. Block 71, which is 1,800 sq km, is in eastern
Yemen’s Masilah basin, near Block 10, which Total has operated
for 20 years. The partners have acquired 2D seismic for Block 71
as well.
Total will work with operator Sinopec (45.5%), state-owned
Yemen General Corp. for Oil & Gas (10%), and the Arabian Group
of Cos. (4.5%). Workers have shot 2D seismic on both blocks, and
a well is being drilled on Block 69.

Natural gas was tested and proved in Tournaisian sandstones in
the third completed exploration well on the Hassi Mouina license
in Algeria’s Sahara Desert, operator StatoilHydro AS said Dec. 11.
The Tinerkouk well (TNK-1) will provide “valuable information on the resource potential in the block,” said Bill Maloney,
StatoilHydro senior vice-president, global exploration. Hassi
Mouina, which spans four blocks within a 23,000 sq km area in
the Gourara basin, is in the western Sahara, northwest of In Salah
gas field.
StatoilHydro and its partner Sonatrach are now drilling the
fourth exploration well, TMS 1. “Several appraisal wells will also be
drilled on the earlier discoveries in order to quantify the volumes
with greater certainty,” StatoilHydro said. StatoilHydro has a 75% Murphy, PTTEP farm in to Australia Block AC/P36

pumps are 15 miles from the Marlin tension leg platform. King is
tied back to Marlin.
Andy Inglis, BP’s chief executive of exploration and production,
said: “In line with our strategy to maximize reserves from our existing fields, the application of this cutting edge technology across
BP’s large deepwater portfolio has the potential to unlock significant resources that would otherwise remain unrecoverable.”
BP is 100% owner and operator of King, which is 75 miles off
Louisiana in Mississippi Canyon Blocks 84, 85, 128, and 129. The
pumps will be powered by an umbilical from the Marlin tension
leg platform in Viosca Knoll Block 915.

Anadarko makes oil ﬁnd with West Tonga well
Anadarko Petroleum Corp. has made an oil discovery in its West
Tonga prospect on Green Canyon Block 726 in deepwater Gulf of
Mexico.
The discovery well, drilled to a TD of 25,680 ft in 4,700 ft of
water, encountered more than 350 ft of net oil pay in three highquality subsalt Miocene sands.
The West Tonga discovery potentially could be tied back to the
Constitution spar, Anadarko said.
Anadarko operates West Tonga with 37.5% working interest.
Partners in the discovery include StatoilHydro AS 25%, Chevron
Corp. 20.5%, and Royal Dutch Shell PLC 17%.

Norway’s Njord ﬁeld starts gas production
After a 2-month delay, StatoilHydro AS produced first gas from
the Njord field in the Norwegian Sea, providing a new gas supply
for Europe along with oil production.
The field, which will produce 6 million cu m/d of gas, required
an investment of 1.2 billion kroner to ensure that Njord will supply gas up to 2020.
A new 40 km pipeline ties Njord gas into the Asgard Transport
line, which in turn connects with the Karstø processing complex,
north of Stavanger, and the trunklines to continental Europe.
Some 20,000 b/d of oil is being produced through 11 wells
from Njord, while four injection wells sent the gas back into the
reservoir as pressure support under the initial phase. Several new
production wells help continue production by phasing in additional resources near the existing infrastructure under the second
phase.
“The new process facility, which has been in operation since
Oct. 1, is functioning very well. Regularity was as high as 99.7%
for the first month,” StatoilHydro said.
It attributed the gas production delay to a faulty weld. The repair
on board the Far Saga vessel took “a long time due to bad weather,”
officials said.

Processing
Proposed Canadian reﬁnery ﬁrst in 23 years
Newfoundland & Labrador Refining Corp. has selected Honeywell International Inc. subsidiary UOP LLC, Des Plaines, Ill., to
supply technology, basic engineering services, and equipment for
a refinery to be built in the Placentia Bay area of Newfoundland
and Labrador.
NLRC’s facility will be the first refinery built in North America
since 1984. UOP is under way with basic engineering design for
the complex, which is scheduled for start-up in 2011. It is projected to process 300,000 b/d of Middle Eastern crudes into transportation fuels for North American and European markets.
The facility also will feature a wide range of trademarked UOP
technologies and processes to remove sulfur and upgrade distillate
materials to produce clean fuels. A continuous catalytic reforming process will be used to produce aromatics and hydrogen from
naphthenes and paraffins. Other procedures will absorb chlorides
from regenerated catalyst to enhance efficiency of chloride management and reduce emissions.

Petrobank to step up Bakken drilling in 2008
Petrobank Energy & Resources Ltd., Calgary, plans to drill 110
horizontal wells next year in the Bakken play in southeast Saskatchewan.
Petrobank expects to operate seven rigs within the Bakken
play—an area in which it is expected to have a drilling inventory
of 600 (565 net) well locations, based on a future well density of
four wells per prospective section.
Drilling will take place after its acquisition of Peerless Energy
Inc. for $334 million, including debt. As part of the deal, Petrobank
is expected to issue about 4 million common shares. The transaction could lead to combined production from the Bakken play to
as much as 7,900 b/d of oil.
Peerless currently is producing about 4,250 boe/d of light oil—
primarily from the Bakken play—and natural gas from Alberta and
British Columbia.
Peerless also has more than 100,000 net acres (156 sections) of
undeveloped land.
Reserves for the acquired properties will be evaluated by
Petrobank’s independent reserves evaluator at yearend.
The deal is subject to approvals, including that of Peerless shareholders. ✦

California to report GHG emissions in 2009
California’s refineries, power plants, cement kilns, and manufacturing plants will be required to report annual greenhouse gas
emissions (GHG) starting in 2009, the California Air Resources
Board agreed Dec. 6.
The mandatory reporting rule, approved unanimously, is expected to affect about 800 industrial sites accounting for 95% of
California’s industrial emissions.
The rule covers emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and
methane. Initial reports will not have to be audited by a third party,
but future reports will have to be verified. Schools and hospitals are
exempt from the new rule.
Carbon emissions reports will be made to the California Climate
Action Registry, a nonprofit agency created in 2000 to encourage
companies to voluntarily track and report GHG emissions.

Contract let for Colombia reﬁnery expansion

Neste Oil to build Singapore biodiesel plant

Refinería de Cartagena SA has awarded to Chicago Bridge & Iron
Co. a contract for a refinery expansion project in Cartagena, Colombia.
CB&I will perform the engineering, procurement, and construction for the expansion, including adding 14 processing units.
The $80 million expansion project is designed to increase processing capacity at the facility to 150,000 b/d from 80,000 b/d.
The upgraded facility will produce ultralow-sulfur gasoline and
diesel from a heavy crude oil slate.
Refinería de Cartagena is owned by Glencore International AG
51% and Ecopetrol, Colombia’s national oil company 49%.

Neste Oil of Finland said it will invest €550 million to construct
the world’s largest biodiesel plant in Singapore.
The plant, to have a capacity of 800,000 tonnes/year, will primarily use palm oil as feedstock, Neste Oil said, adding that it will
use only palm oil certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm
Oil as soon as sufficient quantities are available—probably in early
2008. Singapore was chosen because it is the world’s third-largest
center of refining and occupies a central location in terms of product and feedstock flows and logistics.
Construction of the plant will begin in first half 2008, and operations at the facility are expected to begin by yearend 2010. ✦

Metgasco to extend Casino-Ipswitch gas pipeline
Sydney-based coal seam methane explorer Metgasco Ltd. is
planning to extend its proposed 140 km Casino-Ipswitch gas pipeline further north to BP Australia’s refinery on the Brisbane River.
The pipeline previously was designed to deliver gas from the Casino area in northern New South Wales to CS Energy’s Swanbank
power station near Ipswitch, Queensland.
The extension results from a tentative 15 petajoules/year (about
14 bcf/year) gas supply deal with BP to supply the latter’s Brisbane
refinery. This contract follows an 18 petajoules/year (16.7 bcf/
year) contract signed last year with Queensland-owned CS Energy.
Metgasco says the higher volume through the line will improve
the economics of the entire project.
The new schedule allows for another 30 months to complete
environmental approvals and an additional 8 months for construction of the pipeline. If the timetable holds true, first gas would flow
north towards the end of 2010. Metgasco (formerly Methane Gas
Co., formed as a private syndicate of geologists in 1997) is working in the Clarence-Moreton basin coal fields near Casino.
Metgasco’s immediate priority is to increase its 2P gas reserves
from the 194 petajoules (180.4 bcf) announced in September to
660 petajoules (614 bcf) by mid-2008. The company’s drilling
contractor, Vectra, is working on ways to improve horizontal drilling techniques in the coal seams and speed up completion times
with the aim of bringing on stream as many as 40 wells each year.
Part of the earlier agreement with CS Energy includes CS Energy’s paying some of Metgasco’s exploration and development costs
in return for interests in some of the company’s fields. The BP deal
includes BP’s aid in feasibility studies for the pipeline extension. At
the moment BP is supplied with gas via the Roma-Brisbane pipeline, which transports gas mostly derived from conventional fields
owned by Santos and Origin Energy in the Surat basin. BP uses the
gas for power generation at the refinery, but has been seeking a
second source of supply to maintain its energy security.

Angola LNG receives ﬁnal investment decision
Angola LNG Ltd. will become the latest African export project
as the partners have taken the final investment decision to start deliveries in early 2012 to the Gulf LNG’s Clean Energy regasification
terminal in Mississippi.
The 5.2 million tonne/year onshore liquefaction plant in the

Soyo region in Zaire province will commercialize gas from Blocks
0, 14, 31, 15, and 18; gas from nonassociated fields; and gas that
is otherwise flared. Related gas liquids products will also be produced from the 1 bcfd of gas that will be sent to the plant. Angola
LNG is expected to supply as much as 125 MMcfd of gas to stateowned Sonangol for domestic use.
Cabinda Gulf Oil Co. Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Chevron
Corp., has a 36.4% interest in Angola LNG, which has entered into
an investment contract with the Angolan government and Sonangol
to develop the project. Italy’s Eni SPA also joined the consortium on
Dec. 10 by taking a 13.6% from Sonangol. “The involvement of Eni
in the Angola LNG consortium is part of the strategic cooperation
established between Sonangol and Eni, signed in December 2006,
and aiming at the development of gas resources,” Eni said.
This new development means the Angola LNG shareholders are
Sonagas 22.8%, Chevron Corp. 36.4%, Eni 13.6%, Total SA 13.6%,
and BP PLC 13.6%. Regasified LNG will be sold to the US affiliates
of the partners. Total Gas & Power North America will buy and
market Total’s 13.6% share, around 100 MMcfd.

Marathon signs deal for Piceance production
Marathon Oil Co. is the latest in a slew of major oil and gas
producers that have entered into long-term agreements with Enterprise Gas Processing LLC for the gathering, compression, treating,
and processing of natural gas produced in the Piceance basin of
northwest Colorado. Enterprise will construct 50 miles of gathering lines to connect Marathon’s multiwell drilling sites to the partnership’s 48-mile, 36-in. Piceance Creek Gathering System (PCGS)
for delivery to Enterprise’s Meeker processing complex. Gas production is expected to peak at 180 MMcfd.
The Meeker complex, which was placed into service in October,
is designed to process up to 750 MMcfd of gas and has the capability to extract as much as 35,000 b/d of natural gas liquids (NGL).
Phase II of the Meeker complex, which will double the facility’s
capacity to 1.5 bcfd of gas and 70,000 b/d of NGL, is expected to
begin operations in summer 2008 (OGJ Online, Nov. 15, 2007).
In addition to gathering pipelines, Enterprise also will build
a compressor station to deliver gas into the PCGS. The station, 25
miles south of the Meeker complex in Rio Blanco County, Colo.,
will provide 22,000 hp of compression, as well as condensate handling and natural gas dehydration facilities. ✦

The rise of coalbed methane
Alan Petzet
Chief EditorExploration
Coalbed methane (CBM) production
has spread to several countries since its
meager beginnings in the US.
The US nearly replaced the 1.76 tcf
of CBM it produced in 2006, the Energy
Information Administration reported.
CBM reserves fell 1.4% to 19.62 tcf
at the end of 2006. The reserves-toproduction ratio was 9 at year’s end,
and CBM production was reported in
16 states.
It was 1977 when geologists Ed
Dolly and the late Fred Meissner authored a paper on their “recognition of
the generation and potential production
of gas from coalbeds and carbonaceous
shales,” the AAPG Explorer noted in its
November 2007 issue.
OGJ has ridden along the whole way.
A 1977 article by Frank Getz, NEEG
Inc., Dusseldorf, is titled, “Molecular
nitrogen: clue in coal-derived-methane
hunt” (OGJ, Apr. 25, 1977, p. 221).

US CBM reserves
After rising nearly every year since
1989, US CBM reserves fell slightly in 2
of the last 3 years, EIA reported.
At yearend 2006, Colorado had the
largest CBM reserves, 6.3 tcf, followed
by New Mexico at 4.9 tcf, Wyoming at
2.4 tcf, and Alabama at 2.1 tcf. Virginia,
which EIA reported separately for the
first time in 2006, had 1.8 tcf.
Colorado has been producing
451-520 bcf/year of CBM the past 7
years, and its 2006 CBM reserve figure

is within 350 bcf of the state’s all-time
high reserves of 6.7 tcf in 2002.
Overall, EIA reported CBM reserves at the end of 2006 in 16 states:
Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois,
Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Montana,
New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia,
and Wyoming.
EIA tallied a total of 1 tcf of reserves
in 2006 for Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana,
Montana, and Oklahoma combined.

Drilling-production
EIA figures show 2006 as the peak
year of CBM production in the US.
The 1.76 tcf of 2006 output was up
slightly from 1.73 tcf in 2005 and 1.72
tcf in 2004.
The three largest CBM-producing
states are in the Rockies. New Mexico
led in 2006 with 510 bcf produced,
followed by 477 bcf in Colorado and
378 bcf in Wyoming.
Wyoming’s Powder River basin is the
leader in that state, which has CBM production from several basins (see map,
OGJ, Oct. 1, 2007, p. 50).
Alabama produced 114 bcf of CBM
in 2006. Its output had been as high as
123 bcf in 1998 and 121 bcf in 2004.
US production of unconventional gas
peaked at 24 bcfd in 2006, up from 14
bcfd 1 decade ago, and CBM’s share was
nearly 5 bcfd.
Producers added more than 20,000
new unconventional gas wells in each
of the past 2 years, of which 4,000
wells/year were for CBM and 4,000
wells/year were for gas from shales.

Other trends
US tax credits helped launch economic CBM production in the 1980s,
and output in other countries was slow
to follow.

The emphasis for CBM exploitation in the US seems to have shifted
to deeper coals, lower rank coals, and
the opportunity to develop existing
plays more intensively, said Advanced
Resources International Inc., Arlington, Va., in a six-part series in OGJ on
unconventional gas that concluded last
month (OGJ, Sept. 24, 2007, p. 51).
For example, 85% of the 314-tcf
CBM resource in the Green River basin
occurs below 6,000 ft. And as much
as 4-8 tcf or more of gas is judged to
be in place in Gulf Coast Tertiary coals
between Texas and Florida, with 3.4 tcf
possibly recoverable.
Other countries are hosting CBM
development. In July, Santos Ltd. said
it hopes to make a final investment
decision by the end of 2009 on a 3-4
million tonne/year LNG plant in Gladstone, Queensland, to be fed by CBM
(OGJ Online, July 19, 2007).
That move followed a similar proposal from Arrow Energy Ltd., Brisbane,
last May to supply CBM to a planned 1
million tonne facility, also in Gladstone.
Santos, which has more than 4.65
tcf of CBM reserves and contingent resources, said its Surat and Bowen basin
permits would supply 158-205 bcf of
CBM starting in early 2014.
CBM drilling in Alberta had been
rising since 2002. It peaked at nearly
3,400 wells in 2005 and may have
relaxed in 2006-07 after gas prices
softened, said the Canadian Society for
Unconventional Gas.
Great Eastern Energy Corp., London, made India’s first CBM sale earlier
this year (OGJ Online, July 16, 2007).
China is only beginning to exploit CBM
in its vast coal reserves. And Indonesia
is estimated to have a CBM resource of
as much as 337 tcf (OGJ, Oct. 22, 2001,
p. 40). ✦

A clean-fuel paradox
December 2007 has been an active month for
the climate change issue. Negotiators from around
the world met in Bali, Indonesia, under auspices
of the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change seeking a successor to the
Kyoto Treaty. In the US, the Senate Environment
and Public Works Committee deliberated a bill
that would establish a cap-and-trade system for
greenhouse-gas emissions. And Finland’s Neste
Oil Corp. announced plans for a precedent-setting
renewable-diesel plant that illustrates the conflicts
that can arise in a global grope for simple answers
to complex questions.
Neste Oil’s facility, in Singapore, will make
renewable diesel using a proprietary process able
to run a range of animal fat and vegetable oil feedstocks. The company started up a 170,000-tonne/
year plant based on the process this year at its
200,000-b/d refinery at Porvoo, Finland, and
plans to bring a second unit on stream there in
2009. The Singapore project is noteworthy for,
among other things, its size. The design capacity
is 800,000 tonnes/year, which Neste Oil says will
make the plant “the largest facility producing diesel fuel from renewable feedstocks anywhere.”

emissions associated with a fuel—30-46% that of
gasoline, depending on farming methods. And the
product won’t require special handling or have the
performance drawbacks of biodiesel from transesterification.
Given these advantages, renewable diesel from
palm oil should have unanimous support from
supporters of aggressive precautions against greenhouse warming. It doesn’t.
The market for all edible oils, of which palm
oil accounts for 30%, has grown rapidly in recent
years. According to the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), Kuala Lumpur, the area
under cultivation for palm oil has increased more
than 43% since the 1990s, mostly in Malaysia and
Indonesia. To make room for oil palms, some plantation owners are destroying forests and draining
and burning peat bogs, which act as carbon sinks.
The environmental group Greenpeace has
added palm oil to its list of climate-change threats.
Last month it anchored one of its ships in position to keep a palm oil tanker from leaving a port
in Indonesia. The Greenpeace ship flew a banner
reading, “Palm Oil Kills Forests and Climate.”

Warming antidotes

Greenpeace has been known to exaggerate environmental claims. Neste Oil, though, acknowledges the concern. It committed to process in Singapore only palm oil that complies with a new RSPO
certification system. While the step shows good
faith, it doesn’t annul the boost that consumption
as a fuel feedstock will give to overall demand for
palm oil—and therefore to pressure on oil palm
growers to encroach on forests and peatlands. If
Greenpeace is correct about the extent of the practice, climate-change benefits of diesel from palm
oil are in some measure compromised.
This seems like a paradox: Production of a fuel
that lowers carbon emissions meets resistance because of its association with agricultural methods
that increase carbon emissions. But it’s really just a
reminder: There are no energy panaceas. All energy
forms have advantages and disadvantages. Markets
and science must sort them out and can if allowed
to do so. But the sorting can’t happen by fiat. And
it won’t happen overnight. ✦

In the current political climate, any fuel that can
be called renewable or that bears the prefix “bio”
wins favor. All such fuels are presumed to be effective antidotes to global warming. Yet they’re not all
alike.
Against environmental and performance standards, diesel from the Neste Oil process measures
up well, according to Cal Hodges, president of
A 2nd Opinion Inc., a clean fuels and regulatory
issues consultancy in The Woodlands, Tex. “This
technology is proven and will significantly reduce
life-cycle carbon emissions,” said Hodge, who
is helping Neste win regulatory approvals for its
renewable diesel in the US. In a press release, he
noted the Singapore plant’s capacity exceeds total
current production of biodiesel in all the US.
Neste’s Singapore plant won’t make biodiesel,
an ester. Its product will be a hydrocarbon made
from palm oil. Hodge said diesel from palm oil
has average carbon intensity—a measure of carbon

The collective third-quarter earnings for a sample of US-based oil and
gas producers and refiners declined
from earnings a year earlier, softened
by lower production volumes and weak
downstream margins.
Higher depreciation and operating
expenses weighed on earnings, much as
they did earlier this year. For the first 9
months of 2007, this group of US companies reported
a combined 8%
decline in earnings from a year
earlier.
A sample
of service and
supply firms,
benefiting from a higher cost of doing
business in exploration and production,
together reported a surge in profits for
the third quarter of 2007 compared
with the same 2006 period. Strong
demand for equipment and services
pushed these companies’ earnings 33%
higher in the first 9 months of this year.
Meanwhile, a group of oil and gas
producers and transporters based in
Canada reported a combined 10% decline in earnings for the recent quarter
compared with the third quarter of last
year. Most of these firms reported that a
weaker US dollar relative to the Canadian dollar had a negative impact on
recent earnings.
All figures here are reported in US
dollars.

company’s realized prices for crude oil
were up from a year earlier, but downstream and chemical margins were
lower. Natural gas realizations were
lower, operating expenses were higher,
and the company’s worldwide oil and
gas production volumes declined from
a year earlier.
Downstream earnings of $2 billion
were down $737 million from the
third quarter of 2006, driven by lower
refining and fuels marketing margins,
ExxonMobil reported.
Marathon Oil Corp. reported third
quarter 2007 net income of $1 billion,
down from $1.6 billion in third quarter
2006.
Upstream income was $479 million
in this year’s third quarter, compared
with $572 million a year ago, mainly as
a result of lower oil and gas sales volumes. Marathon’s downstream income
was $482 million in the third quarter

Weak US refining and marketing

man, Billings, Ramsey, & Co. Inc., said
Sunoco’s refining earnings were below
expectations. “Operating earnings of
$171 million were well below our
forecast, primarily due to lower midcontinent refining margins (of $13.10/
bbl) and higher operating costs. Total
throughput volumes averaged 943,000
b/d, 4% above comparable year-ago
levels,” he said.
Bernstein said Sunoco’s marketing earnings were strong on margins
and volumes. “The retail group earned
$31 million, above our forecast, due to
higher gasoline margins,” he said.
Anadarko Petroleum Corp., along
with a handful of other independent
producers, reported a decline in earnings and revenues. Anadarko posted

lower revenue from reduced oil and gas
sales compared with a year earlier, and
the company’s expenses climbed.
In the recent quarter, the company’s
total expenses were up 35%. Anadarko
incurred increased operating, transportation, and exploration expenses, as well
as higher costs for gathering, processing, and marketing and for depreciation, depletion, and amortization.
Refiner Valero Energy Corp. reported
that its third quarter 2007 operating
income was $1.2 billion vs. $2.3 billion
in the same period last year. The reduction was mainly due to higher prices
for light, sweet crude oils and narrower
discounts for sour crude oils, as well as
lower US West Coast refining margins.
Relative to the price of WTI, Valero

said its feedstocks were about $3/bbl
more costly in third-quarter 2007 than
in third-quarter 2006, which resulted
in a more than $700 million unfavorable impact to operating income.

Canadian ﬁrms
A group of oil and gas producers
and pipeline operators based in Canada
reported a collective 9.5% decline
in earnings compared with the third
quarter of 2006, even though the firms’
revenues climbed almost 13%.
For the first 9 months of this year,
the group’s earnings moved 10.4%
lower, and revenues were up 9.6% from
a year earlier.
The companies’ results varied,
though. Canadian Natural Resources

Ltd. recorded a 37% earnings decline
for the recent quarter, but Nexen Inc.
posted $403 million in net income, up
from $199 million a year earlier.
Canadian Natural Resources said its
cash flow in the third quarter of this
year was negatively impacted by the
strengthening of the Canadian dollar compared to the US dollar. Higher
expenses for depletion, depreciation,
and amortization as well as stock-based
compensation expenses, interest, and
risk management activities also decreased earnings.

Nexen said its improved results
reflect increased production from ramping up its North Sea production at
Buzzard field, where daily production
volumes continued to increase and contributed 76,000 boe/d net (177,000
boe/d gross) to third-quarter volumes.
And although the price of WTI increased during the quarter and averaged
$75.38/bbl compared with $70.48/bbl
a year ago, Nexen was unable to retain
the full benefit of the price increase
because of the weakening US dollar.
With net income of $78.1 million,

Enbridge Inc. incurred an 18% earnings
decline from the third quarter of last
year. Revenues for the quarter were up
21% to $2.6 billion.
Enbridge said its earnings were lower due not only to a weaker US dollar,
but also because of a lower contribution
from its Aux Sable natural gas liquids
extraction and fractionation plant,
which had derivative losses during
2007. Also, the company reported increased operating costs in the Enbridge
and Athabasca pipeline systems.

Fourth quarter, full year. 2Second quarter, 6 months.

Service, supply companies
A sample of 28 service and supply
firms posted a 39% surge in earnings
for the third quarter of 2007. None of
the companies reported a loss for the
recent quarter, but 10 firms recorded
a decline in net income compared
with their third-quarter 2006 earnings.
In the final full quarter prior to its
merger with Transocean Inc., Houstonbased GlobalSantaFe Corp. posted an
83% jump in third-quarter 2007 earnings to $448.6 million. Revenue for the
quarter was nearly $1.2 billion. For the

first 9 months, net income was $1.16
billion, up 77% from the corresponding 2006 period.
Transocean’s net income for the
recent quarter was $973 million, up
214%, on record quarterly revenues of
$1.5 billion. Third quarter 2006 revenue was $1 billion.
Transocean said the quarter-toquarter increase in revenues was due
primarily to a higher average day rate,
partially offset by a slight reduction
in the number of days in service. The
third-quarter 2007 average day rate

reached a record high of $219,700, up
8.5% from the second quarter. And the
increase in the average day rate spanned
all rig categories, primarily as a result of
rigs commencing new contracts at the
higher prevailing day rates.
BJ Services Co. reported a 17% slide
in third-quarter earnings from a year
ago to $189.4 million. The company’s
revenue moved 5% higher, but earnings were hit by increased operating
expenses.
BJ Services’ cost of sales and services
for the recent quarter was $910.6 million, up 14% from a year earlier. ✦

Reworked energy bill passes House, stalls in Senate
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
US Congressional Democrats passed
a reworked energy bill in the House by
235 to 181 votes on Dec. 6, only to see
the measure stall in the Senate the following day.

A motion to invoke cloture and limit
debate fell 7 votes short of the necessary
three-fifths majority in a 53-42 vote on
Dec. 7. Senators on both sides pledged
to work to resolve differences, but a
source said on Dec. 10 that Majority
Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) also was
trying to secure additional support for

another cloture vote.
Democrats also denied Republican
charges of being excluded from formulation of the latest energy bill, which
would raise fuel efficiency standards
for cars and trucks to an average 35
mpg, increase the federal renewable
fuels standard to 36 billion gal/year,

arc W. Smith arrived in Washington, DC, from Denver for
his latest visit on Dec. 3 as the US
House leadership announced its latest
energy legislation.
But the Independent Petroleum
Association of Mountain States and its
executive director were doing more
than simply checking in with members and staffs of the 110th Congress
from the Rocky Mountains. They also
were preparing to mobilize 150,000
oil and gas employees and contractors in those states.
“The political landscape has
changed in the Mountain West,”
Smith told me on Dec. 4. “A number
of state legislatures have turned antiindustry. We also have a number of
new governors who don’t understand
the oil and gas business. Even at the
county level, support for the industry
is not a long-term guarantee.”
IPAMS wants to work with state oil
and gas associations on a comprehensive plan to educate and mobilize the
industry’s employees and contractors
in the region. The program would
include a fair method of grading candidates, irrespective of their party.

first is that a renewable energy economy could be achieved in 10 years.
“We’re not against renewable fuels.
We consistently support a diverse energy portfolio which includes them.
But natural gas is critical to a secure
US energy future,” Smith said.
More than half of the states with
renewable portfolio standards for
electricity generation list gas as the
backup fuel for wind, solar and other
intermittent sources, he noted. Biofuels production also requires large
amounts of gas for fertilizer and for
conversion from corn, cellulose, and
other plants.

‘Off a cliff’

The second erroneous assumption is that the Mountain West must
choose between sacrificing its scenic
and recreational assets to develop
energy and preserving large tracts
for wildlife. The third is that nothing
bad will happen if oil and gas activity
in the Rockies is slowed or stopped.
“They don’t appreciate that 50% of
the gas we use today comes from
wells drilled in the last four years,”
said Smith.
Unconventional reservoirs, which

and require that at least 15% of generated electricity come from renewable
sources.
“Even without a conference, we
worked with Republicans, consulting
on and sharing proposed language. And
that is an understatement. Many provisions were removed and modified at the
request of Republican Senate and House
members,” Reid said on Dec. 7 before
the cloture vote.
Minority as well as majority staff
members from Senate and House committees with jurisdiction met over a
2-month period starting Sept. 24 to
work on the bill’s provisions, the House
Energy and Commerce Committee’s
majority staff said in a Dec. 6 e-mail
message to journalists. “In fact, we want
to commend Republican members for
the technical expertise provided by
their staffs throughout this process,” it
said.

‘Fairly one-sided’
Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.), the Energy
and Commerce Committee’s ranking
minority member, took a different view
as the bill arrived on the House floor.
“In the debate so far in this Congress
on energy legislation, it’s been fairly
one-sided. It’s been the majority trying
to put their blueprint for American on
energy...without input from the minority party,” he maintained.
The bill that passed the House also
faced a threatened presidential veto.
“We believe that reducing our dependence on foreign oil and increasing
energy security is an area where both
parties should be able to find common
ground. Unfortunately, Democratic
leaders in the House today pushed a
partisan bill that members had very
little opportunity to study before [and]
which they knew was unacceptable to
the president and had no chance of being signed into law,” White House Press
Secretary Dana Perino said on Dec. 6.
She said the measure would raise
taxes and increase energy prices, points
that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) also made a day later
before the unsuccessful cloture vote.

“It is not a serious attempt to make
law, and is not a serious attempt at an
accomplishment. It is a partisan bill
that must be improved or set aside,” he
maintained.
Senate Democrats expressed their
disappointment after the cloture vote
fell short. One key committee chairman
suggested that “a few smart changes to
some proposals will allow this bill to
move forward,” however.
“The energy tax package, with its
incentives for energy alternatives,
energy efficiency, and new and better
infrastructure, has strong support in the
Senate and will be an essential part of
a good energy bill. The Joint Economic
Committee has determined that the tax
package’s offsets are responsible, appropriate, and will have no negative impact
on consumer prices,” said Finance
Committee Chairman Max Baucus (DMont.).

companies to keep pace with the rising
demand in spite of the numerous restrictions, legislative and regulatory, that
keep many of the areas rich with energy
off-limits to exploration and production,” American Petroleum Institute
Pres. Red Cavaney said in a Dec. 6 letter
to US senators.
Independent Petroleum Association
of America Pres. Barry Russell suggested
in a separate statement that the bill
which passed the House would establish “an unfortunate precedent of funding one energy source at the expense of
another. This country needs to develop
all sources of energy to increase supply
here at home and protect our energy
security. While the growth of renewable energy sources and improvements
in energy efficiency are essential to
America’s energy future and should be
encouraged, we should not be impairing the development of America’s most
viable energy resources.”
Unfavorable tax impacts

American Gas Association Pres. David N.
Parker said on Dec. 6.
The Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States also expressed
concern over the latest bill’s tax provisions, but added that its members were
pleased that public land use provisions
which were part of the House’s earlier
energy measure in August had been removed. “Congress is starting to get the
message from business and consumers
that in this time of economic uncertainty, they don’t want less domestic energy
production; they want more,” IPAMS
Executive Director Marc W. Smith said.
The bill’s provision to expand federal
requirements to use ethanol in motor fuels drew fire from the National
Petrochemical and Refiners Association
as well as API. “NPRA believes that the
timetable for overriding and expanding
the current Renewable Fuels Standard is
unrealistic, and that the broad, mandated reliance on renewable fuels currently
unavailable, such as cellulosic ethanol,
will only add to costs for consumers
and complicate the markets,” Executive
Vice-Pres. Charles T. Drevna said on Dec.
6, just 4 days before his appointment as
NPRA’s president.
“The disguised new tax on refiners and ethanol blenders is also unfair,
requiring the Environmental Protection Agency to issue and sell credits for
advanced biofuels, whether they exist

Global capital expenditures for
exploration and production companies
are expected to increase 11% to $332
billion in 2008, according to the latest
spending survey released Dec. 10 by
Lehman Bros. The survey polled 344
companies—the largest survey conducted by the financial services firm.
Meanwhile, Lehman Bros. said,
spending in 2007 was “moderately
above” original budgets. “As oil prices
remained high, global exploration and
production capital expenditures in
28

2007 increased by 14%, as compared
with gains of 13% in our 2007 midyear
survey, and 9% at the beginning of the
year.”
Of the companies surveyed with
both onshore and offshore operations,
43% expected a larger share of the
2007 budget to be dedicated to offshore spending than was the case in the
prior year. In 2008, however, 28% expect the proportion to increase, Lehman
Bros. reported. “Deepwater spending
continues to increase relative to overall

offshore budgets; 85% of companies
forecasting a shift intend to focus more
on deepwater in 2008 up from 81% in
2007, the study said.
Investment in the US—one of the
principal production regions along with
the North Sea—is expected to grow by
just 3.5% to $81 billion, the study said.
This compares with an estimated 7.4%
gain in 2007. “We believe that several majors will increase their US E&P
spending in 2008,” the study said.

expected that Canadian outlays will
decline for the second consecutive year.
“Spending in Canada is likely to decline
by 12% to $20.3 billion,” Lehman Bros.
reported. This compares with a drop of
10% in 2007. “Perceptions of the economics of drilling have dropped sharply
in Canada over the past 2 years,” it said.
The survey found that increases in
spending outside North America will
be “substantially stronger” than that
in North America. Among the 100
companies surveyed operating internationally, Lehman Bros. estimates they
will increase E&P outlays by 16% to
$267 billion in 2008 vs. $230 billion
in 2007. This gain, the firm said, is
believed to be understated and should
rise even higher.
Lehman Bros. found that oil price
expectations among oil and gas companies has increased. In order to establish
their 2008 budgets, the study found,
companies assumed a price for oil
(West Texas Intermediate) of $67.91/
bbl and an average price for natural gas
in the US of $6.78/Mcf.
Fewer companies this year, the study
said, expect to overspend their cash
flow in 2008. Of the companies surveyed, 37% expect 2008 capital spending to exceed total cash flow. This compares with 43% of companies expecting
to overspend cash flow in 2007. ✦

Chavez
woos Galp

V

enezuelan President Hugo
Chavez recently stopped in Portugal and offered to become a main
supplier of oil and gas to the small
Iberian Peninsula nation.
“Venezuela wants to be a secure
source of energy for Portugal,” said
Chavez. “This is about expanding our
strategic range, our presence in the
world, in a country like Portugal that
we hold in high esteem,” he gushed.
Portuguese oil and gas company
Galp Energia SGPS SA was not shy in
saying it plans to buy as much as 2
billion cu m of LNG from Venezuela.
The Portuguese firm said it might
even help build a liquefaction plant
in the South American nation.
That was back on Nov. 20 and,
given ancient rivalries, it sounded a
bit odd for Spanish-speaking Venezuela to make such offers in, well,
Portuguese-speaking Portugal.
One simply could not help thinking that Brazil—currently Venezuela’s
arch-rival in Latin America—was
somehow the target of this visit by
Chavez.

Modern rivalry
After all, Chavez provoked the
ire of Brazilian lawmakers on two
separate occasions earlier this year
when he said Brazil’s congress was
“submissive” to US interests.
Could Chavez be trying to upstage
his rival in Brazil, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, by wooing Portuguese oil and gas investors?
Just before Chavez’s visit, directors of Brazil’s state-owned Petroleo
Brasileiro SA told Lula that the country’s ultradeep presalt layer could
contain up to 80 billion bbl in oil
reserves.

Brazil will need help getting
the oil. Its presalt area lies in more
than 2,000 m of water, and further
beneath 3,000 m of sand and rocks
below the ocean floor, as well as a
2,000-m thick salt layer.
Getting the oil is highly worthwhile: Petrobras Chief Executive Sergio Gabrielli said Tupi field would put
Brazil’s reserves somewhere between
those of Nigeria and Venezuela. Oops!

Portuguese investment
Petrobras has a 65% operating
stake in the Tupi field, BG Group
PLC holds another 25%, and—guess
who?—Portugal’s Galp Energia has
rights to the remaining 10%.
In a word, Galp Energia has access
to a lot of Brazilian oil as well as the
kind of capital Brazil’s development
program needs. Would that gall a
man of Chavez’s sensibilities? Will the
sun rise in the East tomorrow?
As we know, Chavez views his oil
as a political weapon—something to
be dangled before potential allies or
withheld from supposed enemies.
Chavez already considers his country to be a main source of oil and
gas to much of the world’s underprivileged, whether they live in the
US, the UK, the Caribbean, or Latin
America.
So, word of Brazil’s new potential
power as major producer of oil and
gas might not be welcome news to
his ears. It could undermine his selfproclaimed rule in the region and
around the world.
Hence, his visit to Portugal and
his wooing of that nation’s not inconsiderable oil and gas investment
money. ✦

late 2007. Laterals at 10 operated wells
are 3,400 ft or longer.
“With production information dating back as far as one year on one-third
of this sample, Newfield is confident
that these wells will have a significantly
higher EUR,” the company said. It listed
results from three recent extended lateral
completions with nine frac stages each:
• Patterson 3H-31, with a 4,240-ft
lateral, went on line at 10.3 MMcfd at a

completed well cost of $8.5 million.
• Parker 3H-36, with a 4,252-ft
lateral, went on line at 9.4 MMcfd.
• Tollett 3H-22 went on line at 12
MMcfd from a 4,366-ft lateral.
Parker and Tollett cost $7 million
each to drill and complete.
“The company’s recent well results
demonstrate that extended lateral completions have the potential to [reduce]
finding and development cost toward
$2/Mcf,” Newfield said. “Additional

drilling and recent 3D seismic data will
be used to determine what percentage
of the total acreage can be developed
with extended lateral completions.”
Newfield produces 165 MMcfd from
the Arkoma Woodford, double its flow
this time last year, and holds 165,000
net acres in the play. Industry is running 44 rigs in the play, spudding 90

“For a start, all parts of governments with energy responsibilities must
rapidly engage in designing effective
policies,” he said.

“To realize the tremendous potential
for improvements across the board,
energy efficiency needs a well-designed
and sustained policy push,” Tanaka said,
adding, “This will pave the way for a

Insights (WEO), showing that, absent
new policies, energy-related carbon
emissions will increase by almost 60%,
reaching 42 gigatonnes (Gt) in 2030.
This is higher than last year’s projection
by 1.5 Gt because of much greater coal
use than expected, driven by high oil
and gas prices. Despite many ambitious
policy instruments and rising energy
prices, emissions continue to rise in IEA
countries.
IEA analyses show that a departure
from current trends is possible by
exploiting the immediate benefits of
energy efficiency and deployment of
known technologies, reinforced by new
technologies that will only be available
with much greater effort.
Year on year, IEA projections reinforce the critical role that energy efficiency and a better use of our resources
can deliver on climate, energy security,
and welfare. WEO demonstrates that by

implementing policies under discussion
today, CO2 emissions from OECD countries could begin declining by 2015;
global emissions would stabilize by
2025, with energy efficiency delivering
the bulk of avoided emissions.
The past two G8 Summits have
endorsed 16 IEA recommendations
covering all energy end-uses, such as
buildings (40% of OECD energy use),
transportation (using 60% of world
oil), and lighting. If implemented globally, these initiatives alone could save
5.7 Gt of CO2 by 2030—nearly a quarter of what we need to accomplish.
“The triple-win potential of energy
efficiency—higher economic performance, higher energy security, and
less climate change—leads to three
recommendations: implement, implement, implement,” Tanaka said. This is
required “for developed and emerging
economies alike,” he added. ✦

The Chinese government has called
for the safety of its oil workers in two
African countries, citing the dangers to
operations posed by antigovernment
rebels in Sudan and Ethiopia.
On Dec. 12, China called for the
safety of its citizens in Sudan to be

“Any threats or attacks on Chinese
organizations or people in Sudan are
unacceptable,” said the Chinese foreign

in 2008 is expected to be about the
same as in 2007. In Canada, excluding
integrated oilsands, about $3 billion is
planned for upstream investment, about
10% lower than in 2007.

Nexen’s spending plans
Nexen said the decrease in spending for 2008 vs. 2007 reflects reduced
investment in several of the company’s
major development projects, including its coalbed methane operations in
Alberta, due to uncertainty surrounding
proposed changes to Alberta’s royalty
regime.
Nexen said its 2008 capital spending will focus on value-adding projects, growing net production by about
8-10%, and generating $2.9 billion in
cash flow next year, which compares to
its expected cash flow of about $3.4 billion for 2007. About 29% of the capital
budget will be allocated to major development projects. This will allow Nexen
to bring Long Lake Phase 1 and Ettrick
oil field in the North Sea on stream in
2008 as well as progress Longhorn in
the Gulf of Mexico and CBM at Fort
Assiniboine in Alberta.
About 17% is earmarked for earlystage development projects expected to
contribute production and cash flow
growth beyond 2008. These include future phases of oil sands in the Athabasca
region, Block OPL-222 off West Africa,
and its Knotty Head and Golden Eagle
discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico and
North Sea, respectively.
About 25% will be spent on exploration in North Sea and Gulf of Mexico
growth areas and on shale gas in northeast British Columbia. Another 25% it
allocated toward existing producing
assets. ✦

THE RETHINKING CONTINUES
By rethinking recovery methods, producers have brought to a hungry market gas from reservoirs
once considered economically and technically impossible. Tight gas sands, shales, and coalbeds
now represent large and growing sources of an essential form of clean energy. But they’re still
unconventional. The reservoirs are complex. The costs of drilling into and completing wells in them
are high and rising. They present unique environmental problems. Producing gas from unconventional
reservoirs proﬁtably, safely, and in amounts demanded by the market requires continuous rethinking the kind of thinking that shoves back limits on what’s possible with gas supply.
Rethinking of recovery methods will continue Sept. 30 - Oct. 2, 2008, at the Unconventional Gas
International Conference & Exhibition at the Hilton Fort Worth in Fort Worth, Texas. Planned by
editors of Oil & Gas Journal and an advisory board of industry experts, the event will highlight
innovation from unconventional gas plays around the world. It will be your chance to meet and
learn from other professionals in the fastest-growing sector of the gas-producing industry.

Petroleo Brasileiro SA’s development plans for ultradeepwater Tupi oil
field off Rio de Janeiro state include a
100,000 b/d early production system
to be built by 2010-11, said company
Pres. and Chief Executive Jose Sergio
Gabrielli De Azevedo Nov. 13 at the
World Energy Congress in Rome.
The company expects full development of the Santos basin field to begin
by 2012 once the company collects required
initial data.
Following completion
of its 1-RJS-646 (3-BRSA496-RJS) confirmation
well in the field, Petrobras announced possible
volumes of recoverable 30° gravity oil
from Tupi to be 5-8 billion bbl. If Petrobras’s estimates prove out, Tupi would
belong in a category with supergiant
Kashagan field in Kazakhstan. Industry
geologists expect several more appraisal
wells will be needed to confirm such
volumes.
The discovery well, 1-RJS-628A
(1-BRSA-369A-RJS), was found last
year in 2,126 m of water in a frontier
section of the Santos basin 150 km
south of Rio de Janeiro (OGJ, Oct. 6,
2006, Newsletter; see map, Nov. 20,
2006, p. 43). Drilled to a true vertical depth of 19,680 ft, it penetrated
an evaporitic salt sequence more than
2,000 m thick. Petrobras said the well
flowed 4,900 b/d of 30° gravity oil
and 4.3 MMscfd of gas from a deep
presalt reservoir through a 5⁄8-in. choke.
Petrobras, operator, has a 65% stake, BG
Group holds 25%, and Petrogal-Galp
Energia 10%.
The confirmation well is 9.5 km
southeast of the discovery well. Noble
Drilling’s Paul Wolff semisubmersible
rig drilled it to 2,166 m, and well tests
indicated flows of 2,000 b/d of oil and
65,000 cu m/day of natural gas, with
flow limited by equipment and safety
factors.
Gabrielli told WEC that Petrobras is
“highly confident” about its estimate of
the volumes of recoverable oil, which
would make Tupi one of the largest

and could boost Brazil’s current 14 billion bbl oil and gas reserves “by more
than 50%.”
Petrobras said it has drilled 15 wells
in its new presalt frontier, which ranges
through the Espirito Santo, Campos,
and Santos basins, and has tested eight
of them producing 28º gravity oil. It
said, “Data from these wells, integrated
with a major mapping effort, allowed
the company to determine…that the
presalt rock formations range from an
area extending from the State of Espirito Santo to the state of Santa Catarina.
It is about 800 km long and 200 km
wide and is found in water depths [of]
2,000-3,000 m.”
Gabrielli indicated there may be
more oil beyond the Tupi accumulation
in the Santos basin, but no figures were
offered as to the extent of the reservoir.
He said Petrobras has many rigs under contract that can drill to 3,000 m.
“We think it will take 2 years” to create
a Tupi development plan. Petrobras is
building two other drilling rigs and is
in discussions with other contractors to
secure rigs.
Costs to develop the project are a key
concern because the services market is
tight and costs have escalated. “We have
very high pressure and low temperature
of the oil. Stabilization of casing is a
challenge and so is the hardness of the
rock,” Gabrielli said.
Petrobras had not accounted for Tupi
in its $112.4 billion strategic business
plan for 2008-12 published earlier this
year.
Gabrielli declined to comment on
whether Brazil could join OPEC with
this latest addition to its reserves, saying
that was a decision for government.
“We planned to increase refining capacity by 1 million b/d by 2015 before we
discovered Tupi, and that would make
us self-sufficient. We are probably going
to export more oil products than crude
oil.” This decision, however, would
depend on economics, he said.
Brazil aspires to produce 4.5 million
b/d of oil by 2015 with Tupi coming
on stream. Prior to that, its target was

Brazilian Defense Minister Nelson
Jobim claims that a new oil discovery
off Brazil underlines the need for his
country to develop a nuclear submarine for protection.
“When you have a large natural
source of wealth discovered in the Atlantic, it’s obvious you need the means
to protect it,” Jobim told a defense
conference in Rio de Janeiro.
Jobim’s statement followed a Nov. 8
announcement by the Brazilian government and Petroleo Brasileiro SA that
5-8 billion bbl of oil and associated gas
had been found in the block containing

offshore Tupi ﬁeld in the Santos basin
(OGJ Online, Nov. 16, 2007). The discovery well is in 2,126 m of water.
Meanwhile, Petrobras said it will drill
32 wells to appraise the area around
Tupi ﬁeld, according to Hugo Repsold,
general manager for exploration and
production.
The ﬁeld is in a presalt frontier
extending through the Espirito Santo,
Campos, and Santos basins.
Petrobras has a 65% stake in Tupi
ﬁeld, while BG Group PLC holds 25%,
and Portugal’s Galp Energia has the
remaining 10%.

Seismic to start in New Zealand’s Great South basin
Consortia led by ExxonMobil Corp.
and OMV AG are starting a new wave
of exploration in New Zealand’s Great
South basin off the southern South
Island. Water in the storm-tossed Great
South basin is more than 900 m deep.
ExxonMobil and its partner Todd
Energy were to take delivery of WesternGeco’s Western Trident seismic vessel
in late November to begin shooting
960 km of 2D and 1,340 sq km of 3D
surveys on PEP 50117. This initial phase
of a 27-month exploration campaign
on the permit should be completed by
February 2008.
ExxonMobil also will reprocess
some 1,200 km of existing seismic and
complete a range of geological and
geophysical studies to determine the oil
and gas potential of the virtually virgin
acreage. The initial phase is expected to
cost as much as $37 million. If success-

ful, it could lead to a drilling program
in 2009-10.
ExxonMobil holds 90% interest in
the permit, and Todd holds 10%.
OMV is operator on three new
permits—PEPs 50119, 50120, and
50121—with a 36% interest. Other interest holders are Mitsui Exploration of
Japan 36% and PTTEP Offshore Investment Co. of Thailand 28%.
The Discoverer 2 seismic vessel is
to begin work for OMV in December.
Preparatory work suggests the potential
for structures capable of holding many
trillion cubic feet of gas and more than
100 million bbl of oil, OMV said.
Hunt Petroleum attempted to explore
the region during 1976-84 and found
hydrocarbons in four of eight wildcats,
but nothing of commercial size at that
time (see map, OGJ, July 19, 1999, p.
78). ✦

Colombia
The Colombian unit of Cia. Espanola
de Petroleos SA (Cepsa) plans to take
a farmout of a 50% interest in the
Garibay block in the Llanos basin from
Solana Resources Ltd., Calgary.
Cepsa Colombia SA will fund 100%
of the costs associated with the block’s
third phase exploration well, which
must be drilled by October 2008, subject to an E&P contract with Colombia’s
ANH. Solana shot extensive 3D seismic
in early 2007.
Solana said the farmout furthers
its exploration strategy to concentrate
on the five contiguous blocks it operates in the eastern Llanos—Guachiria,
Guachiria Norte, Guachiria Sur, Colona,
and San Pablo—and the operated Catguas block in the Catatumbo basin.

a growing number of
major operating companies. Twenty years ago, it was largely
overlooked.
However, gas companies were
developing “hard rock” resources in
the 1970s-1990s rather than tight gas
resources. While they needed hydraulic
fracturing, the resources’ permeabilities
were higher and we focused on the
rock. Now we focus on unlocking the
gas that is tightly bound in lower permeability resources.
Unconventional gas reservoirs are
found worldwide, including onshore
US, Canada, Australia, Europe, Nigeria,
Russia, China, and India.
Unconventional gas production in
the US reached a peak of 24 bcfd (8.6
tcf/year) in 2006, up from 14 bcfd
(5.0 tcf/year) 10 years ago. With a 43%
share, it is now the dominant source of
natural gas production.1
Tight-gas reservoirs, shale, and coalbed methane assets are the main sources
of what is generally known as unconventional gas. Their flow mechanisms
increase in complexity from Darcy flow
to Fick’s diffusion flow mechanisms
and combinations of a variety of other
mechanisms.
Nothing regarding the
drilling, completion, or
production can be automatically assumed in these
reservoirs. They require
increased geological understanding and precision

quicker time frame and
often within a higher well

This three-part series
presents technologies and

producing from thick formations or
creating multiple fractures in horizontal
wells.
Hydraulic-fracture stimulation can
improve the productivity of a well in
a tight-gas reservoir because a long
conductive fracture transforms the flow
path natural gas must take to enter the
wellbore.
After a successful fracture stimulation treatment, natural gas enters the
fracture from all points along it in a
linear fashion. The highly conductive
fracture transports the gas rapidly to the
wellbore. Later, the gas in the reservoir
is flowing toward an elliptical pressure
sink and most of the gas enters near the
tip of the fracture.
Conventional wisdom in designing hydraulic-fracture treatments for
tight-gas sands suggests that successful stimulation requires creating long,
conductive fractures filled with proppant opposite the pay zone interval.
This is accomplished by pumping large
volumes of proppant at high concentrations into the fractures, using fluids that
can transport and uniformly distribute
proppant deeply into the fracture.5

SurgiFrac
Combined hydrajetting, fracturing, and jet-pump (CHF) technology
is the first known successful method
to resolve the problem of openhole
fracture placement control by using
dynamic diversion techniques. The technique (SurgiFrac) is a combination of
three separate processes: hydrajetting,
hydraulic fracturing (through tubing),
and coinjection down the annulus (using separate pumping equipment).
One important aspect of this technique is the dynamic sealing capability.
Unlike other techniques that require
hardware-type packers or plugs, or even
chemical plugs, this process essentially
relies upon sealing by using fluid movement. Because packers are not used in
most cases, the existence of passageways
behind liner or through fractures rarely
affects the performance of this process.
The technique is based primarily on
the Bernoulli principle, which states
42

O D U C T I O N

that the energy level of a fluid is generally maintained constant. To perform the
SurgiFrac service, a jetting tool is placed
near the toe of the well and used to jetperforate the casing and the formation
rock, forming a 4-6-in. deep cavity.
Based on the Bernoulli equation, as
pressurized fluid exits the jetting tool
the pressure energy is transformed into
kinetic energy or velocity. Since the
fluid velocity around the jet stream is at
its greatest, pressure in this area is at its
lowest, meaning the fluid does not tend
to “leak” out somewhere. Conversely,
fluid from the other areas of the well
will flow into the jetted area.
The fluid generally contains some
abrasives to help the fluid penetrate the
steel liner and the formation rock. As
cavities are formed by each jet, highvelocity fluid impacts the bottom of
the cavity (e.g., velocity becomes zero,
an energy change from kinetic back to
potential energy or pressure), causing
pressure inside the rock to become high
enough to create a fracture. Annulus
pressure is then increased to help extend the fracture.
After the fracturing process is completed, the tool is moved to the next
fracturing position and another fracture
is placed.
The conversion of low-pressure,
high-velocity kinetic energy to highpressure, low-velocity potential energy is extremely useful for fracture
initiation and fracture placement. The
breakdown pressure in a conventional
treatment requires a tensile failure of
the rock achieved by pressuring up the
entire wellbore.
Because, in most cases, fracture
initiation pressure is much higher than
fracture extension pressure, achieving
multiple fracture initiation points along
a horizontal wellbore requires achieving
multiple fracture initiation pressures.
This is very difficult in practice without some form of isolation along the
wellbore.
Since the energy of the jetting fluid
is converted to pressure inside the
eroded rock, the tensile failure of the
rock occurs at the jetting point without

Special Report

exposing the wellbore to breakdown
pressures. This enables precise control of
the location of fracture initiation in the
horizontal section. Multiple fractures
can be created by simply moving the
jetting tool to another location in the
lateral and using hydrajet fracturing.
Another attribute of the hydrajetting
fracturing process is the creation of a
dominant fracture through continued
hydrajetting during fracture extension.
As the fracture grows in width, the
net pressure increase resulting from
fracture extension induces stress normal
to the direction of the fracture propagation; i.e., reopening previous fractures
becomes more difficult due to the increased stress induced by the dominant
fracture.
The SurgiFrac service has been applied successfully in a variety of fracturing conditions:
• Multiple propped fractures in open
hole.
• Multiple acid fractures in open
hole.
• Deviated cased hole.
• Horizontal slotted liner.
• Coiled-tubing acid-frac to bypass
damage.
• Multiple fractures in a cased horizontal wellbore.
A case history illustrates the utility
of the multizone fracturing method.
The first subsea CHF fracture stimulation was in 1,000 ft of water in Brazil’s
Campos basin. Because the stimulated
well had two branches (abandoned due
to drilling problems), it behaved like a
triple lateral for stimulation design. The
treatment resulted in five acid fractures,
completed in 2.5 days.
Production rate for the first 15
production days following the treatment was almost double the maximum
historical rate of this well and almost
four times the monthly production
rate during the months preceding the
SurgiFrac. As a result of this treatment
and two other treatments for proof-ofconcept, a major international company
has approved SurgiFrac service for all its
scenarios—land, offshore, and subsea—
worldwide.

March 3 – 5, 2008 / Moody Gardens Hotel & Convention Center, Galveston, Texas

SUBSEA TIEBACK
Forum & Exhibition

PennWell invites you back to the 8th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition.
SSTB has become the premier event for one of the fastest growing field
development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March 3 – 5, 2008 in
Galveston, TX at the Moody Gardens Hotel & Conference Center. Over 2,000
people and 150 exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference.You can’t
afford to miss it.
As our industry confronts new challenges, it has never been more important
to submerse yourself in them. This year’s theme is “Subsea is here, the game
is changing.” As our game changes, the sharing of knowledge and collective
experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety,
and economics of the subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by
industry leaders. As in the past, only by participating in this conference will you
be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will not be published and no
Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room
stays inside the conference room. We hope you will join us.

countries as well.10-12
Laherrere estimates the conventional

whereas Rempel’s estimate is calculated

The conventional natural gas URR
estimate was limited to estimates that
were determined geologically and
where the estimate was broken into
regions. Hence only Laherrere and
Rempel’s conventional natural gas URR
estimates were used.
Laherrere’s estimate of 283 tcm is
low, and Rempel’s estimate of 467 tcm
is high, relative to literature estimates

significantly different world conventional natural gas URR estimates, their

The production curve for coalbed
methane is a parabola to the year xd
and beyond that the curve follows an
exponential decay. Regression analysis
is used to fit the parabola portion of the
curve, expressed by Equation 1 (see accompanying equation box), to the data.
At the point (xd,yd), the model shifts
into an exponential decay.
Equation 3 shows the coalbed methane production model M(x).
The point xd (in Equation 3) is assumed is the point where xd – xp/r2 – xp
= 0.15, which ensures the overall shape
of the curve resembles the general coal
bed methane production.24
Note xp and r2 are defined as shown
in Equations 5 and 6.
In this way we make yd a function
of xd. Lastly, xd is solved so that the
area under the curve matches the URR
estimate.

different curve.
This assumption has been based on
the historic production data from the
US. The model indicates that worldwide
natural gas production will peak around
2043. Conventional natural gas peaks
about 5 years earlier. So that, while
unconventional gas is an important
source of energy, it can only slightly
delay the inevitable decline. Natural gas
supply begins to deviate from demand
around 2030. It is noted that European
production remains flat before steadily
declining.
The current resource estimates for
methane hydrates are about 1,000
tcm.39 With an assumption of a 10%
recovery factor, the methane hydrates
URR would be about 100 tcm, which
is about 20% of the natural gas URR
estimate used in this article.
Methane hydrates resource estimates,
however, are decreasing by an order of
magnitude every decade.39 In a decade,
therefore, the methane hydrates URR
may be about 10 tcm and only 2% of
the natural gas URR estimated in this
article. A model of methane hydrates is
meaningless until the resource estimates
of methane hydrates stabilize.

Syncrude Canada Ltd. is a joint venture owned by seven participants:
• Canadian Oil Sands Ltd., 36.74%.
• ConocoPhillips Oil Sands Partnership II, 9.03%.
• Imperial Oil Resources, 25%.
• Mocal Energy Ltd., 5%.
• Murphy Oil Co. Ltd., 5%.
• Nexen Oil Sands Partnership,
7.23%.
• Petro-Canada Oil & Gas, 12%.
It operates a surface-mining oil sands
plant at the Athabasca oil sands deposit in northern Alberta and produces
synthetic crude oil from the extracted
bitumen. Operations started in 1978
and production has increased to 94 million bbl (258,000 b/d) in 2006 from
28 million bbl (77,000 b/d) in 1979.
Cumulative production has exceeded
1.7 billion bbl, while environmental
impacts have been substantially reduced.
Fig. 1a illustrates Syncrude production history. The production volume
in 2006 was equivalent to 12% of the
Canadian crude oil consumption. Fig.

The UE-1 project substantially
increased production capacity and
improved product quality while reducing environmental effects. The new
improved-quality product is called
Syncrude Sweet Premium (SSP), and the
product prior to the UE-1 project was
known as Syncrude Sweet Blend (SSB).
The UE-1 project provided facilities
to improve of diesel cetane number
(CN) and jet fuel smoke point. Syncrude will address the improvement
of heavy gas oil (HGO) quality in a
future expansion project. Improving
the processes for oil sands bitumen
recovery and product quality is part of
Syncrude’s R&D focus.
In an earlier article (OGJ, Apr. 23,
2001, p. 46), we reviewed Syncrude’s
upgrading operations and R&D activities on bitumen chemistry, process
improvement, and product-quality
improvement.
This article highlights the scope
of the UE-1 project in the upgrading
area, updates the configuration of the
upgrading processes for SSP production, reviews new cetane index (CI)
and smoke point correlations suitable
for bitumen-derived middle distillates,
and discusses how the new CI correla-

Hydrogen plants
There are four hydrogen generation units at Syncrude. The fourth was
installed with the UE-1 project in
2005. Hydrogen is produced via steam
reforming natural gas.

Hydrotreating
Syncrude had five fixed-bed hydrotreating units before UE-1: two
naphtha hydrotreaters, one LGO hydrotreater, and two HGO hydrotreaters.
The UE-1 project revamped the five existing units to improve operability and
56

product quality, and added a new LGO
hydrotreater for aromatics saturation to
substantially improve the diesel cetane
number and jet fuel smoke point.
Some key features include:
• Naphtha hydrotreater. There are two
identical units in parallel. Each unit
has three reactors in series: a diolefin
reactor and two main reactors. The
diolefin reactor hydrogenates diolefins
in the feed (mostly coker naphtha) at
a relatively low temperature to prevent
polymerization, which can lead to fouling of the catalyst bed at main reactor
conditions (OGJ, Sept. 6, 1999, p. 64).
Main reactors reduce the nitrogen
content to 1 ppm (wt), so that downstream refiners can use the hydrotreated

naphtha in catalytic reformers with
noble metal catalysts.
The reactor configuration before
UE-1 resulted in gas-liquid mixed phase
reactions, thereby causing flow maldistribution and hot spots in the reactors.
The UE-1 project eliminated the mixedphase reactions by splitting the product
from the diolefin reactor into light and
heavy fractions, and charging them
separately into the two main reactors.
By doing so, flow maldistribution and
hot spots in the reactor are minimized,
and catalyst utilization is enhanced.
Nameplate capacity is 48,500 b/d/
unit.
• LGO hydrotreater. Feeds are LGOs
from the DRUs and VDU, and part of
the HGO from the VDU. The process
objective is to reduce the sulfur and
nitrogen content. Aromatics saturation
is an incidental but desirable reaction.
Compared to the coker LGO that is
treated in the new aromatics saturation
unit, straight run LGO to this hydrotreater contains less sulfur and nitrogen. Target sulfur and nitrogen removal
is therefore easily achieved even with
twice-regenerated catalysts,1 although
the activity of regenerated catalysts is
about 20% lower than fresh catalyst.2
The UE-1 project added three more
parallel reactor vessels to handle higher
feed rates and improve product quality.
The nameplate capacity is 100,000 b/d.
• HGO hydrotreater. Feeds are HGOs
from the coker, LC-Finer, and VDU. Each
unit has two trains and each train has
two reactors in series: a guard reactor
and a main reactor. The guard reactor
protects the main reactor catalysts by
removing metals and entrained matter.
The main reactor, comprised of three
consecutive beds, is intended to reduce
sulfur and nitrogen. Incidental reactions
such as cracking and aromatics saturation also occur.
The UE-1 project revamped the
fractionator to draw an LGO cut from
the total liquid products. The LGO side
stream is further treated in the new
UE-1 aromatics saturation unit. The
nameplate capacity is 75,000 b/d/unit.
• Aromatics saturation unit. This new unit

SY CI based on NMR hydrogen

was installed in 2005 to produce higher
CN diesel and smoke point jet fuels,
thereby producing average 40 CN diesel
and 19 mm smoke point jet fuels in SSP.
The SSB typically had a 34 CN diesel
and 16 mm smoke point jet fuels.
The feeds are combined LGOs from
the DRUs, cokers, LC-Finer, and HGO
hydrotreaters. The unit has two trains
with two reactors in series: a hydrotreating reactor with a typical NiMo
catalyst to reduce sulfur and nitrogen,
and a hydrogenation reactor with a

tively. With more stringent diesel fuel
specifications being developed, refiners continually look for new options
to improve diesel fuel quality. SSP, a
premium product, is designed to meet
such requirements.
For optimum operation of the aromatics saturation unit and SSP marketing, it is now imperative to monitor its
performance and product quality for
not only sulfur and nitrogen, but also
aromatics, CN, and smoke point.

Equation 1 is the same as the one
in D4737-90 adopted in 1990. It was
developed based on a data set of 1,229
fuels, including commercial diesel fuels, refinery blending components and
fuels derived from oil sands, shale, and
coal. It is unclear how many oil-sandsderived diesel fuels were used, but they
were likely coker-derived fuels from
either Syncrude or Suncor Energy Inc.
Equation 2 that was adopted in 2004
is to be used for low-sulfur diesel with
less than 500 ppm (wt), but there is no
explanation regarding what data set this
correlation was based on.
Syncrude installed an LC-Finer hydrocracker and a related hydrotreater in
1987, and a two-stage aromatics saturation unit in 2005. The CN of the diesel
fraction from the Syncrude product was
therefore improved over the diesel fraction from earlier coker-derived synthetic crude oil that might have been used
for developing Equation 1. It is suspected, therefore, that Procedure A CCI may
have a limitation for current and future
oil-sands-derived middle distillates.
Syncrude Research therefore developed new CI correlations that include
density, simulated distillation, and supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC)

matics (Equations 11-13).
Smoke point correlations (Equations
14-16) were also developed using the
same lab items.
The calculated CN (SY CI) and
smoke point were obtained using Equations 11-16. The hydrogen content in
Equations 13 and 16 was obtained by
thermal conductivity measurement after
oxidation, not by NMR.
The correlations were tested with the
diesel and jet fuel samples that were not
used for developing the correlations.3
Fig. 3a shows the results of total 13
samples from various individual and
blended Syncrude commercial LGO
feeds, intermediate and final hydrotreated products, and the diesel cuts from a
typical SSB and SSP. This shows that the
SY CI correlations are more accurate for
oil-sands-derived middle distillates.

Figs. 3a and 4 was obtained by NMR
and thermal conductivity after oxidation, respectively.
These figures suggest that the new
CN and smoke point correlations
should be applicable to oil sands bitumen-derived diesel and jet fuels from
a wide range of upgrading processes,
untreated feeds, and products regardless of sulfur content, and a wide range
of boiling points, as well as to conventional crude-derived diesel and jet fuels,
and their blends with counterparts from
bitumen-derived products.
The correlations may be useful as a
tool for process development, synthetic
crude marketing, and monitoring product quality and the operation of middle
distillate hydrotreaters.

LGO feeds, products
Two ASTM CCIs (Equations 1 and 2)
and the two SY CIs (Equations 12 and
13) were applied to monitor operation
of the new aromatics saturation unit. The
samples of the LGO feeds, intermediate
products from the first reactor, and the
final LGO products from the second reactor are regularly taken, and characterized for sulfur, nitrogen, density at 15°
C., simulated distillation, aniline point,
and NMR hydrogen. SFC aromatics are
not available on a regular basis.
The results for the first 7 months of
operation are shown here.

Fig. 5 compares the CIs based on
various correlations and SY CI based on
NMR hydrogen, Equation 13. We found
that:
• Both SY CIs based on aniline point
Equation 12 and NMR hydrogen Equation 13 are comparable for all three
streams; i.e., LGO feeds, intermediate,
and final products.
• CIs based on ASTM D4737 Procedure A are 3-4 numbers higher than SY
CIs and that based on Procedure B.
Fig. 6 shows daily SY CIs for all three
streams. Fig. 7 shows the incremental
CIs in the first reactor and overall two
reactors, respectively. Fig. 8 shows the
relationship between SY CI and sulfur
content.
These figures show that:
• The SY CI correlations can be applied to monitor the aromatics saturation unit operation.
• The CIs of the LGO feeds are
31-34.
• 50 CI with ultralow-sulfur LGO
products could be produced from the
UE-1 aromatics saturation unit.

Sluggish European
LNG demand helped relax supply tensions in the
first half of 2007, despite
numerous liquefaction
plants producing below
LNG
nameplate capacity. LNG
cargoes were pulled away
from initially targeted European markets and redirected to higher-priced US
or Asian markets.
Outside of an
exceptionally early
cold winter or supply disruptions, the
LNG market should
remain relatively
relaxed. In addition to greater volumes from Equatorial
Guinea, Trinidad, and Norway, European
demand will likely remain sluggish,
freeing supply for the Asian market.
The price-driven nature of the US
market will produce record spot trading
activity between the Atlantic and Asia
Pacific basin in 2007.

LNG demand
Initial estimates for first-half 2007
show global LNG demand at 86 million tonnes, a 6.3 million tonne, or
8%, increase compared to the first half
of 2006. Demand was stronger in the
second quarter of the year, growing by
8.8% on the strength of Asian and US
buying.

Deliveries to the Asia-Pacific region increased by 2.5 million tonnes
(10.5%) in second-quarter 2007
as compared to the same period a
year earlier, reaching nearly 55 million tonnes by the end of June 2007.
European LNG demand continued
to collapse, falling nearly 12% in the
second quarter, with cargoes making
their way to the US instead, leading to a
record high level of LNG imports to the
Americas, up 64.1% in the first half of
2007 (Fig. 1).

Asia-Paciﬁc
LNG demand in the Asia-Pacific region increased by 8.6% to 54.8 million
tonnes in the first half of 2007 from
50.4 million tonnes in the first half of
2006 (Table 1).
Japan, the world’s largest LNG market, continued to show solid growth,
with a 9.8% increase in imports in
second-quarter 2007, compared to the
same period in 2006. Economic recovery and attractive LNG prices compared
to oil prices drove industrial demand,
while power generation sector demand
was bolstered by a series of nuclear
plant closures.
LNG imports into Korea totaled 13.3
million tonnes in the first half of 2007,
a decrease of nearly 9% compared to a
year ago, as warm temperatures, technical problems at four major storage tanks
at the Incheon terminal, and fuel-substitution curbed demand.
In Taiwan, LNG import growth
slowed in second-quarter 2007 to
4.8%, following a strong 19.6%
demand increase for the same period
in 2006. LNG demand in the country
totaled 3.7 million tonnes at the end
of June 2007, drawn mainly into the
power generation sector.
Indian LNG demand remains extremely strong, showing 70.7% growth
in second-quarter 2007, and reaching
4.1 million tonnes at the year’s midpoint. The country has been very active
in the spot LNG market and imports
are nearing the maximum capacity of

The Pacific Basin posted
the smallest nominal
production increase (1.12
million tonnes). The start
of the Darwin liquefaction
plant in February 2006, and
its production ramp-up in
2006, allowed Australia to
increase exports by 18% in
the first half of 2007. In Malaysia, LNG production from
the Bintulu complex rose 7%
in the first half of 2007 due
to 21.5% second-quarter
growth.
Indonesian LNG supply
decreased 10.8% in secondquarter 2007, following a
6% first-quarter drop in the
face of continued production
problems. During the first 6
months of 2007, Indonesian
supply dropped 1 million
tonnes as compared with the
first half of 2006.
Brunei increased its
supply by 300,000 tonnes
in the first half of 2007

New software for well planning, drilling

System keeps track of oil ﬁeld equipment

Newly released Sysdrill Version 3.0 is an
evolved product suite of well planning and
drilling software solutions that combines
new modules with existing functionality
in a single unified application.
Version 3.0 focuses on four areas of
improvement to existing industry software: functionality, efficiency, accessibility,
and interoperability. The software features
enhancements to existing Sysdrill technology, including the following advanced
components:
• Automatic well planning.
• Advanced target definition.
• Casing wear prediction.
• Dual gradient modeling.
• Temperature modeling.
• Well control kill sheet.
• Volume calculator.
• Packer calculation.
• DEX/WITSML interoperability.

New intelligent field resource management (IFRM), a radio-frequency identification-driven solution for oil-field equipment, answers these questions for those
in oil and gas field operations and maintenance (O&M): What do I have? When did I
get it? Where is it?
Previously, those in O&M relied on bar
codes or other inventory control methods
for their heavy industrial material, consumables, and equipment, the company
points out.
The system will tell field engineers
such things as exactly where a piece of
equipment is, what kind of shape it’s
in, whether it’s even functioning at any
precise moment, and if it needs to go back
for a rebuild. All the information related to
the tagged equipment is tied to this firm’s
Navigator process management services
and stored securely online where it is
available for collaborative initiatives. This
means you can not only find the particular
piece of machinery you’re looking for, but

at the same time you can get the manual
on it, the service record on it—anything
about the item you want to know.

The company developed the software in
partnership with Engineous Software Inc.,
a Cary, NC-based company that develops

RECOVERY METHODS

™

September 30 – October 2, 2008
Hilton Fort Worth
Fort Worth, Texas USA

THE RETHINKING CONTINUES
By rethinking recovery methods, producers have brought to a hungry market gas from reservoirs once considered economically and
technically impossible. Tight sands, shales, and coalbeds now represent large and growing sources of an essential form of clean energy.
But they’re still unconventional. The reservoirs are complex. The costs of drilling into and completing
wells in them are high and rising. They present unique environmental problems.
Producing gas from unconventional reservoirs proﬁtably, safely, and in amounts demanded by the
market requires continuous rethinking – the kind of thinking that shoves back limits on what’s possible
with gas supply.
Rethinking of recovery methods will continue Sept. 30 – Oct. 2, 2008, at the Unconventional Gas
International Conference & Exhibition at the Hilton Fort Worth in Fort Worth, Texas. Planned by editors
of Oil & Gas Journal and an advisory board of industry experts, the event will highlight innovation
from unconventional gas plays around the world. It will be your chance to meet and learn from other
professionals in the fastest-growing sector of the gas-producing industry.
So mark your calendar.
Plan to attend the ﬁrst annual Unconventional Gas International Conference & Exhibition.

CONDENSATE EAST OF SUEZ:
NGL and its Naphtha Impacts in
Asia Pacific and Mideast Gulf
Condensate and the Light-End Products Squeeze
By Asia Paciﬁc Energy Consulting

• This is the “deﬁnitive” report on
condensate in the fastest growing,
critical regions of the world, Asia
Paciﬁc and the Mideast Gulf.
• The study provides a complete guide
to optimizing value in future condensate production, utilization, and trade.

Condensate coming into its own
Condensate, one of the two groups
deﬁned as Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs),
is ﬁnally coming of age in world trade,
marketing, reﬁning and petrochemicals. Condensate sales are moving
from a niche marketing specialty to
a mainstream segment of crude and
products trade, and nowhere is this
more evident than in the Mideast Gulf
and Asia Paciﬁc.
This report explains how the protean
nature of condensate allows it to be
used in a wide range of sectors: as a
reﬁnery slate component; in specialized distillation towers called condensate splitters; in direct feed to ethylene crackers; in gasoline blending and
as a substitute for gas in turbine power generation. It can be deﬁned as a
base material, a blending component,
a feedstock or a boiler feed.

New House bill
highlights US
energy instability
When US lawmakers fret about energy
supply from unstable regimes, they should
look closely at themselves.
In the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT),
which became law, Congress created a
bundle of incentives for a variety of energy
forms, including a few selective tax breaks
for oil and gas.
That bill contained one big move and

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

one big omission. The big move was a mandate for vehicle fuels made from renewable
sources—mainly ethanol. The big omission
was meaningful opening of access to federal land off-limits to oil and gas drilling.
The big move and big omission combined to make EPACT, whatever its other
virtues, a big error.
This year, with Democrats newly in
control, both houses have revisited energy.
Each has passed legislation.
Among other things, the House annulled
oil-company tax breaks enacted in EPACT
and other recent laws. The Senate outlawed
fuel prices above nebulous levels during
supply emergencies, toughened fuelefﬁciency standards for new vehicles, and
raised the ethanol mandate.
The House and Senate made no formal
effort to reconcile their bills. Instead, House
leaders stitched together a hybrid.
In its ﬁrst version, the new House measure, which raises the mandate for renewable vehicle fuels and stiffens fuel-economy
standards, contained no taxes on oil and
gas companies.
Now it does—$13 billion or more from
rollbacks of recently enacted incentives for
activities like offshore gas production from
deep reservoirs. Lawmakers say they need
the money to bring uncompetitive energy
to market.
So taxes fall, and taxes rise. Taxes fall
and rise again. Mandates for uneconomic
fuel additives, some of which are raising
food prices, keep growing. No one mentions expanded leasing, the fastest way to
raise supply of the cheapest energy on the
greatest scale.
One stated reason for all this is to
reduce the need of US energy consumers to buy oil—cheaper though it be than
the alternatives being forced to market—
produced in countries that someone in
Congress deems unstable.
There are, to be sure, unstable countries
in the world. With energy, the US is earning
itself a leading position among them.

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

OPEC holds pat on production
As was generally expected, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
agreed Dec. 5 not to raise crude production since commercial oil inventories remained at comfortable levels.
Energy prices fell Dec. 4-5 before rebounding above $90/bbl Dec. 6, then dropping
below $89/bbl Dec. 7. OPEC ofﬁcials blamed the volatility on “the perception of market tightness...exacerbated by nonfundamental factors, including the heavy inﬂux of
ﬁnancial funds into commodities and speculative activity in the markets.”
OPEC assigned production allocations of 1.9 million b/d to new member Angola
and 520,000 b/d to Ecuador, which recently rejoined OPEC. For the 12 members with
ofﬁcial quotas, OPEC production allocations totaled 29.67 million b/d; Iraq, the only
member not bound by a quota, is struggling to regain prewar production levels.
In Paris, the International Energy Agency said OPEC’s inaction “may do little to
calm market anxiety.” However, IEA said OPEC’s actual production has been “much
higher” than indicated at its September meeting when it raised production 500,000
b/d effective Nov. 1. Much of the additional supply comes from Iraq and Angola.
“And there are signs that more OPEC oil may be on its way in December,” said IEA
ofﬁcials. “Our concern is that there are uncertainties that surround the sustainability
of some of that supply, and winter demand is as variable as the weather. The market
is clearly uncomfortable that it has lost some stock cover in recent months and with
prices near $90/bbl it is telling producers it wants to see that ﬂexibility restored.”
The OPEC meeting was “largely ignored” as the market focused on the strength
of the US dollar, said Olivier Jakob, managing director of Petromatrix GMBH, Zug,
Switzerland. “The dollar index gained close to 1% [on Dec. 5] and is now back to the
levels of early November,” he said. “With no clear signs from oil fundamentals, the
dollar index should be a key directional input.”
The only reason for OPEC to increase production would be a rising momentum in
energy prices, said Paul Horsnell at Barclays Capital Inc., London. Besides, the previous OPEC hike “is yet to come through, with that delayed increase having been even
further delayed by heavy UAE maintenance [of wells] in November,” he said.
The ‘Iranium’ issue
A Dec. 3 government report said US intelligence agencies now agreed Iran
stopped its nuclear weapon program in 2003 and hasn’t revived it. That should
reduce some of the “Iranium” risk premium in energy prices, Jakob said. “Nigeria
remains a volatile environment, but we could see militants in the Bayelsa state signing a new ceaseﬁre agreement,” he said.
However, Horsnell said, “The latest US National Intelligence Estimate on Iranian
nuclear intentions and capabilities muddies the waters fairly signiﬁcantly.” He said,
“The emphasis has gone from Iran being considered likely to build a weapon, to
Iran having the material to make a weapon. Different in content, but perhaps not so
different in policy implications. The more signiﬁcant impact of the NIE is in the likely
weakening of the chances of further [United Nations] Security Council action, with
both Russia and China more likely to decouple from the process.”
US inventories
The Energy Information Administration reported benchmark US crude inventories fell 8 million bbl to 305.2 million bbl in the week ended Nov. 30. Gasoline stocks
jumped 4 million bbl to 200.6 million bbl in the same period. Distillate fuel inventories increased 1.4 million bbl to 132.3 million bbl. “The crude oil stock draw was
much larger than any expectations but part of it is probably due to fog delays on the
Houston Ship Channel,” Jakob said. Imports of crude into the US fell 980,000 b/d to
9.4 million b/d during that week.
A Nov. 28 explosion and ﬁre that killed two workers and temporarily shut down
Houston-based Enbridge Energy Partners LP’s main pipeline system carrying 1.5 million b/d crude—15% of total US oil imports—from Canada to Midwest reﬁneries had
“absolutely nothing to do” with the drop in US imports, “particularly into the Gulf
Coast,” Horsnell said. “US crude inventories have now fallen by just short of 50 million bbl over the past 5 months, and are now at their lowest level since September
2005.”
Horsnell said, “The rise in distillate inventories follows seasonal norms and is
made up of a large fall in heating oil and a larger rise in diesel.” He said, “The bearish element is the larger-than-normal build in gasoline, bringing them back close to
their 5-year average.”

1. Practical: Specially designed high resolution MFL tools inspect non-piggable pipelines
with or without pig traps. V-LINE tools are bi-directional and allow for a single point of
entry into difficult-to-access pipeline segments.

2. Thorough: V-LINE Services offer a full picture of the pipeline’s internal and external
metal loss. Our complete, quantified assessment allows integrity decision-making with
confidence, promotes pipeline safety, and facilitates regulatory compliance.

3. Non-destructive: V-LINE Inspection Services is the lower cost, comprehensive
alternative to hydrostatic testing. Costly environmental issues and integrity-affecting
pressure cycles are eliminated. And your pipeline stays dry!

4. Precise application: Target the inspection where you need it! Critical crossings,
short segment HCAs, transfer lines, lines with non-passable fittings, lines with no traps.
And V-LINE inspection tools are great for direct assessment validation.
Contact Baker Hughes PMG and take your integrity program in new directions.

Technology collaboration key in
well intervention today

The frontier of coiled tubing-related technology in the well intervention business is
shown being tested in the Last Frontier state as Western Well Tool loads its drilling
tractor into a well at the site of the Nordic Rig No. 2 at Prudhoe Bay oil ﬁeld on Alaska’s
North Slope. The company contends that, with the aid of advanced drilling tractors,
coiled tubing use will grow as industry drills more extreme-proﬁle wells.

“The opportunities afforded by Smart Intervention technologies are tremendous,” says McGurk. “Smart Intervention integrates real-time bottomhole tool optimization data into well intervention to provide a new level of process control with real-time
decision-making capabilities during well intervention work.”
The Sentio tool contains an array of sensors that simultaneously sample downhole measurements of weight or tension
on tool, torque, RPM, bending stress, vibration, and pressure
at a high data rate. A digital signal processor analyzes the data
stream and provides static parameters and diagnostics.
“This information can be transmitted to a rig-ﬂoor monitor
and a remote real-time operating center,” notes McGurk. “It also

Slickline intervention is a “huge” market for development,
says McGurk, with well intervention specialists moving many
traditional pipe-conveyed intervention technologies to slickline, particularly the setting of solid and inﬂatable plugging and
isolation devices.
“The environmental beneﬁts are signiﬁcant—replacing explosive setting tools and reducing the need to ship explosives,
particularly in areas of higher political risk and times of increasing regulation,” he says.
In areas where the use of slickline intervention is mandated—due

niﬁcantly reduce operators’ risk exposure.”

Fishing
Good data are the key to improving ﬁshing operations, not just
the surface indications but also the downhole measurements
that are going to become available in the near future with the
development of wellbore data gathering systems, according to
Hammond.
“Fishing today is still a black art, and any 10 ﬁshing experts
will have a total of 10 ways to do a given job—it’s the nature
of the beast,” he says. “We believe that with better and more
readily available data on past ﬁshing problems, we may see the
day when those same 10 experts will have only four or ﬁve suggested approaches. That would represent a quantum leap in ﬁshing job evaluation: It’s ﬁshing smarter.”
McGurk cites these breakthroughs in ﬁshing techniques:
• Smart Intervention with the Sentio tool.
• Advanced cutting and milling technologies.
• Innovative new casing exit technologies that are far removed
from traditional methodologies.

Wellbore data
The industry continues to push the envelope on gathering wellbore data in real time, and that is advancing well intervention
technology as well.
| December 17, 2007 | Technology Forum |

Well testing
The advent of real-time wellbore data is changing the game in
well testing as well.
With some exceptions, how a well ﬂows initially can impact
the long-term production capacity of the well, Mayer points out.
“Proper initial ﬂow can prevent irreversible damage to the
wellbore and reservoir,” he says. “Careful attention to well data
as it occurs in real time can be helpful in making the decisions
about ﬂowing the well.
“Technology improvements in data acquisition systems that
can communicate accurate, real-time well data from remote
locations is becoming more useful as reservoirs deplete and
well control becomes more vital to the success of a project.
Information and communication technologies will continue to
inﬂuence well testing.”
As the industry workforce becomes more technologically
proﬁcient, the implementation and utilization of such technology becomes more feasible, Mayer notes.
“ At the end of the day, all the technology in the world will not
help unless the tester on location understands the information
provided by the well itself,” he cautions. “Each well is different
and should be treated as such.” ]

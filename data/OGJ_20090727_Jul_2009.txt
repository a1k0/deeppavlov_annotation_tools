General

Interest

IHS: Global upstream M&A activity rebounded in 2Q
Global upstream mergers and acquisitions (M&A) deals nearly
doubled in the second quarter, up from a 10-year low in the first
quarter, spurred by a resurgence in oil prices and a thaw in equity
and credit markets, according to IHS Herold Inc., an IHS company.
‚ÄúBoth US onshore and international deal counts increased significantly, although North American activity remained well below
historical averages,‚Äù said Chris Sheehan, IHS Herold director of
M&A research. ‚ÄúInternational pricing for proved plus probable reserves held firm on stronger crude oil prices, but falling gas prices
plunged North American asset deal prices to the lowest level since
2005.‚Äù
Sheehan said, ‚ÄúThe upsurge in activity in the second quarter is
encouraging, but the market is still extremely volatile.‚Äù
IHS Herold reported that second quarter total transaction value
increased fourfold outside North America, driven by strong activity in the Africa-Middle East region and upturns in Europe and
Asia-Pacific.
Total worldwide transaction value was flat at $28.4 billion, as
first quarter figures were buttressed by the $20 billion merger of
Suncor Inc. and Petro-Canada. National oil companies represented
nearly 40% of global deal value, including Sinopec‚Äôs $8.8 billion
agreement to acquire Addax Petroleum‚Äîthe largest overseas upstream transaction by a Chinese company.

Saskatchewan reports growing energy momentum
Saskatchewan offers a wealth of oil and natural gas assets, and
officials believe the province‚Äôs resource potential will continue to
grow through anticipated technological innovations.
Of the Canadian provinces, Saskatchewn is Canada‚Äôs secondlargest oil producer and third-largest natural gas producer.
One promising play under production is Saskatchewan‚Äôs portion of the Bakken oil play. Saskatchewan‚Äôs Bakken oil production
reached 57,000 b/d in December 2008 compared with 950 b/d
in October 2004.
Ed Dancsok, assistant deputy minister of the Saskatchewan Ministry of Energy and Resources, attributes escalating production figures to advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing.
The province has not yet established a Bakken reserve estimate.
In 2008, Saskatchewan reported 4,045 oil and gas wells were
drilled, making it the province‚Äôs second-best year in terms of total
wells drilled. In 2007, officials reported 3,451 wells were drilled.
Initial oil in place for conventional crude reserves across the

Exploration

&

‚Äî Q u i c k Ta k e s

province is estimated at 41.2 billion bbl. Currently, more than 35.5
billion bbl remain beyond reach, but Danscok said intensive research efforts are under way to find ways to economically unlock
that oil.
Latest estimates put Saskatchewan‚Äôs remaining recoverable reserves
of conventional crude oil at 1.18 billion bbl. This includes 611 million
bbl of heavy oil, with the rest being medium and light crude.
These figures do not include oil sands or oil shale, and the province is working toward developing its unconventional crude oil.
Saskatchewan has a 2.7 million hectare area with some degree of
oil sands potential.
Dancsok said enhanced oil recovery holds great potential for
Saskatchewan‚Äôs conventional reserves. Current EOR projects include
both steam and carbon dioxide injection. Researchers are studying
vaporized solvent injection methods for heavy oil.
EOR production levels increased steadily from 2,735 b/d in
1982 to 50,788 b/d in 2008. Canada‚Äôs largest CO2 project is the
Weyburn project operated by EnCana Oil & Gas Partnership. In
2005, Apache Canada began CO2 injection in Midale field.

Brazil interested in Russian expertise
Brazil‚Äôs Deputy Foreign Minister Samuel Pinheiro Guimaraes,
on a visit to Moscow, said his country is interested in using Russian
technology to develop oil and gas fields as well as nuclear power.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre interested in Russia‚Äôs technologies of oil and gas output at sea platforms and their transportation,‚Äù said Guimares, who
added that Brazil could share its deepwater oil production technology in exchange for Russian technology.
‚ÄúThe fields have been discovered at a depth of 7 km and some
200 km off the coast, so we‚Äôll have to convert the gas into a liquid
with Russian technology on offshore platforms,‚Äù Guimaraes said.
Guimares also discussed the potentials for cooperation between
the two countries regarding nuclear technology, saying that ‚ÄúBrazil
ranks fifth in the world for uranium stocks‚Äù while ‚ÄúRussia has big
experience on nuclear technologies.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre planning to build eight new nuclear power electric power plants,‚Äù Guimares said, adding, ‚ÄúWe praise Russia‚Äôs participation
in carrying out this program.‚Äù
He said, ‚ÄúBrazil is planning to carry out an infrastructure program within the next 6 months that amounts to $150 billion. The
program includes the construction of new electric power plants,
ports and railways. In each field Russia has indisputable experience
that we seek to use.‚Äù ‚ú¶

Geological extent of the multizone, mostly conventional discovery in Kern County is still undefined. Oxy didn‚Äôt locate the find in
sprawling Kern County by OGJ presstime but said the hydrocarbons are two-thirds gas. Oxy‚Äôs interest is 80%.
The discovery could be California‚Äôs largest in more than 35
years, Oxy said. The company said it is probable that more reserves
exist outside the area so far defined and that similar structures lie
outside its 1.1 million net acre position in California. Oxy plans
to drill wells to exploit the other opportunities in the next 5-10
years.
Oxy, as California‚Äôs largest gas producer, third-largest oil producer, and largest acreage holder, operates more than 7,500 active
wells in 90 fields in the state. The company‚Äôs proved reserves in
California at the end of 2008 were 708 million boe, about 24% of
its worldwide reserves.

ing interests in Angola, the concessionaire and the other Block 32
partners have rights of first refusal.
‚ÄúWith the divestiture of a portion of our Angola interest, we
are able to bring better balance to our overall portfolio by capturing the sizable amount of value we have created and redeploying
capital into other growth regions for the company,‚Äù said David E.
Roberts Jr., Marathon executive vice-president, upstream. ‚ÄúAt the
same time, maintaining a 10% interest in both Blocks 31 and 32
provides Marathon with exposure to this important resource base,‚Äù
Roberts said.
Angola state-owned oil firm Sonangol serves as concessionaire
of Block 32. Block operator Total E&P Angola (Block 32) Ltd. holds
30% interest. Other partners are Sonangol P&P 20%, Esso E&P Angola (Block 32) 15%, and Petrogal 5%.

Murphy makes oil Ô¨Ånd off Congo (Brazzaville)
BLM selects team to evaluate deferred Utah leases
The US Bureau of Land Management named a 12-member multidisciplinary team from three federal agencies to evaluate 77 deferred oil and gas lease parcels in southeastern Utah. The group
does not include anyone involved in any previous decisions concerning the tracts, BLM said.
It includes James Haerter, BLM‚Äôs program lead for oil, gas, and
energy, and eight other employees of the US Department of the
Interior agency, along with two specialists from the National Park
Service and one from the US Forest Service. The team‚Äôs findings are
expected by late September, according to BLM.
Its Utah office originally auctioned the 77 parcels at a Dec. 19,
2008, lease sale. A federal district court enjoined their sale on Jan.
17 and US Interior Secretary Ken Salazar ordered that they not be
issued on Feb. 6.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs essential that any future decisions on these parcels be based
on solid science and a comprehensive evaluation process,‚Äù BLM
Acting Director Mike Pool said. ‚ÄúNo one wants to strengthen the
integrity of BLM‚Äôs oil and gas lease sales more than BLM and this
team‚Äôs role is integral in achieving that.‚Äù
BLM said the team will be asked to produce recommendations
on whether the deferred parcels should be reoffered under the
same conditions, reoffered under different terms, or be withdrawn.
It added that the team also will review protests ledged against each
of the parcels during the original lease sale‚Äôs protest period and
will address those protests in its final recommendations.

CNOOC, Sinopec sign deal for Angola block
Marathon Oil Corp. subsidiary Marathon International Petroleum Angola Block 32 Ltd. signed a $1.3 billion definitive agreement with CNOOC International Ltd. and Sinopec International

and Sinopec will acquire the Marathon unit‚Äôs undivided 20% participating interest in the production-sharing contract and jointoperating agreement in Block 32 off Angola.
The transaction total excluded any purchase price adjustments
at closing and has an effective date of Jan. 1, 2009. Marathon will
retain a 10% working interest in the block.
The companies expect to close the transaction by yearend, subject to government and regulatory approvals. For transfer of work8

Murphy Oil Corp. reported an oil discovery at the Turquoise
Marine-1 prospect on the Mer Profonde Sud (MPS) block off Congo (Brazzaville).
The Turquoise Marine-1 discovery well, which was drilled to a
total measured depth of 12,060 ft in 5,285 ft of water, found more
than 136 ft of net oil pay. The well lies 17 miles from Murphyoperated Azurite field.
The discovery marks the second for Murphy on the MPS block,
said David M. Wood, president and chief executive officer. The rig
now moves to the Diamant Marine-1 prospect, which lies even
closer to Azurite field, Wood said.
Murphy will be ‚Äúlooking at appraisal and development options
for Turquoise Marine-1 in the coming months and seeking to optimize the existing Azurite field infrastructure,‚Äù Wood added.
Murphy is operator with 50% working interest in Turquoise,
Marine-1 and MPS block. Partners are PA Resources, 35%, and Societe Nationale des Petroles du Congo, 15%.

BP reports success of Mad Dog South well in gulf
BP PLC drilled a successful appraisal well in a previously untested southern segment of Mad Dog field in the Gulf of Mexico.
The 826-5 well was drilled on Green Canyon Block 826 about 100
miles south of Grand Isle, La., in 5,100 ft of water.
The well found 280 net ft of hydrocarbons in the objective
Miocene hydrocarbon-bearing sands and also found an oil column
of more than 2,200 ft.
In 2008, BP drilled the A-7 well in the western part of the field,
which found a hydrocarbon column of more than 2,500 ft and
275 ft of net pay.
‚ÄúWith these additional hydrocarbon resources in the west and
south of the field, Mad Dog has been firmly established as the third
giant field in BP‚Äôs Gulf of Mexico portfolio, joining Thunder Horse
and Atlantis,‚Äù said Andy Inglis, BP chief executive officer, exploration and production.
BP is currently reviewing development options to increase production from Mad Dog either through debottlenecking the existing facility or by adding another production facility, the company
said.

Anadarko lets Caesar Tonga Ô¨Åeld contracts
Anadarko Petroleum Corp. has let two lump-sum contracts to
Technip SA to design equipment to bring deepwater Caesar Tonga
field on stream by 2011 in the Gulf of Mexico.
Caesar Tonga is a subsea tie-back to Anadarko‚Äôs Constitution Spa
development. It lies 190 miles off New Orleans in 1,500 m of
water.
Technip will design and supply the components for four pipein-pipe flowlines and install 43 km of flowlines. It also includes the
design, fabrication, and installation of eight pipeline end terminations.
This development will use the pipe-in-pipe technology, which
provides insulation and flow assurance for effective production in
deep and ultradeep water. Offshore installation will be carried out
with the Deep Blue, Technip‚Äôs deepwater pipelay vessel.
The second contract covers the project management, engineering, and fabrication of two control umbilicals and their
termination hardware. This contract, which is scheduled to be
completed in third quarter 2010, will be executed by Duco,

Kurdistan inaugurates reÔ¨Ånery at Arbil
Iraq‚Äôs Kurdistan region, eyeing a broader plan of industrialization, has inaugurated a new refinery near the capital city of Arbil,
one of several planned for the area that will jointly process as much
as 200,000 b/d.
Refinery director Baz Karim said the new facility is operated by
private Kurdish investors Kar Group, and will process crude from
the Khurmala Dome oil field, which will initially provide 50,000
b/d of oil before rising to 100,000 b/d after 6 months.
The new refinery has an initial capacity of 20,000 b/d but is expected to increase to 40,000 b/d by yearend, with eventual plans
calling for an increase to 75,000 b/d.
The Arbil facility will produce gasoline, kerosine, heavy fuel oil,
diesel, paraffin, and airplane fuel, said Karim, who added that the
KRG will pay Kar Group for what the refinery produces.
The new facility will enable the Kurdish region to reduce its
dependence on Iraq and Turkey for its refined products, according
to KRG Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani.
‚ÄúWe cannot rely on foreign fuel and electricity to help us cope
with the heat of summer and the cold of winter,‚Äù said Barzani. ‚ÄúWe
will fulfill our promise that our people must live like citizens of the
developed world in terms of living standards and prosperity.‚Äù
Ashti Hawrami, minister of natural resources for the Kurdistan
regional government (KRG), underlined that view, saying that the
Arbil refinery is one of several planned for the region which will
have the capacity of producing 200,000 b/d within 2-3 years.
The launch of the new refinery also coincided with remarks by
KRG President Massud Barzani, who told an election campaign rally that he will not ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù on longstanding Kurdish claims

Cabgoc starts oil production from Mafumeira Norte
Chevron Corp. subsidiary Cabinda Gulf Oil Co. Ltd. (Cabgoc)
brought the Mafumeira Norte oil project off Angola on stream
ahead of schedule.
Cabgoc developed the field with 14 wells to the existing Kungulo water-injection platform and will deliver a maximum of 30,000
b/d and 30 MMcfd of natural gas in 2011.
This project is in 160 ft of water 15 miles off Angola. This is the
first phase development of Mafumeira field in Area A of Block 0.
Sonamet (Lobito), a joint venture of Sonangol and Acergy, won
the engineering, procurement, construction, and installation contract for the Mafumeira Norte platform. This was the first time
Sonamet was awarded such a contract and the platform was fabricated at its Lobito yard in southern Angola.
Chevron, through Cabgoc, has a 39.2% interest and is operator

‚ÄúWe are committed to the application of Article 140 (of the Iraqi
constitution) and we promise that we will absolutely not compromise on this issue or on the rights of the people of Kurdistan,‚Äù Barzani said ahead of Kurdish regional elections, scheduled for July 25.
He was referring to the article of the Iraqi constitution which
calls for a referendum to decide the fate of Kirkuk, which the Kurds
wish to make the capital of their autonomous region.
In June, Kurdistan began exporting crude for the first time,
sending 100,000 b/d from the Taq Taq and Tawke oil fields via the
Iraq-Turkey pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan. Initial exports
include 40,000 b/d from Taq Taq and 60,000 b/d from Tawke

China approves Tianjin petrochemicals complex
Construction of the $3 billion petrochemicals complex in Tianjin, China, owned by Sinopec and Saudi Basic Industries Corp. is
slated for completion in September.
The complex will have a production capacity of 3.2 million tonnes/
year, including a 1 million tpy ethylene cracker and will produce other
products, including polyethylenes, ethylene glycol, polypropylene,
butadiene, phenol, and butene-1 (OGJ Online, Dec. 15, 2008).
In June 2008, the project‚Äôs costs were expected to surpass $2.5
billion, but have since risen due to the expanded scope of the plant.
The Chinese National Development and Reform Commission
(NDRC) has approved both companies forming a 50:50 joint venture for the complex. It follows a strategic cooperation agreement
signed by both parties on June 21, 2008, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

Sasol to establish GTL plant in Uzbekistan
Sasol has formed a partnership with Petronas and Uzbekistan
state oil and gas company Uzbekneftegaz to establish a 1.3 million
tonne/year GTL plant in Uzbekistan.
The companies signed a joint venture agreement in the capital
of Tashkent on July 15 and will begin a feasibility study on the
$2.5-billion project. No start up date was provided nor were details on which gas fields could produce the feed to produce the
diesel, kerosine, naphtha, and LPG.
Sasol said the GTL facility will use its proprietary Slurry Phase
Distillate process, which produces a clean-burning, high-performance diesel fuel.
Each company will have an equal equity share in the JV. The
plant would have a capacity of 36,000-40,000 b/d.
This deal builds upon a heads of agreement signed in April by
Sasol Chief Executive Pat Davies and Petronas Pres. and Chief Executive Officer Tan Sri Mohd Hassan Marican.

Total reports steamcracker explosion at Carling

Total Petrochemicals France‚Äôs steamcracker unit at the Saint-AvoldCarling site in eastern France killed two people and wounded six
others. The injured were subsequently discharged from the hospital, a Total spokesman told OGJ.
The accident occurred as the steamcracker was being restarted
after a shutdown due to recent heavy storms in the area. The plant
has been made safe and there is no risk of pollution, Total said.
A superheater was thought to have caused the explosion although no reasons have been given thus far for a cause. Total speculates that an accumlulation of gas occurred during the unit‚Äôs operation and caused the blast.
The 250,000 tonne/year steamcracker was one of two crackers on
the site. The second unit was shut down in 2008 and is in the process
of being dismantled following a decision to restructure the Carling
site. The remaining steamcracker had been thoroughly revamped during an October 2007 shutdown and its capacity increased.
Total SA Chief Executive Officer Christophe de Margerie, after
visiting the site shortly after the incident, reassured workers that
‚Äúthe accident does not jeopardize the survival of the site.‚Äù
In view of the current difficulties of the petrochemicals market in France, the Carling trade unions were worried that the site,
which is in the process of being restructured, might be shut down,
thinking that the cost of reconstruction of the damaged steamcracker might be too high to take on in a period of economic
uncertainty. ‚ú¶

CPC inaugurates Taiwan‚Äôs second LNG terminal

a 90% share in the JV, the Fos Faster LNG Terminal SAS, while Societe des Petroles Shell will hold the remaining 10%.
The firms said Fos Faster LNG will be developed as part of the
expansion strategy of the Grand Port Maritime de Marseille and in
close cooperation with the Port Authority.
‚ÄúThe joint venture combines the experience of Vopak in tank
terminal development and operations with Shell‚Äôs position as the
largest equity shareholder of LNG capacity among international oil
companies,‚Äù they said.
The Fos Faster LNG terminal has an initial planned capacity of
around 8 billion cu m/year of gas, more than 15% of the current
annual gas consumption of France.
‚ÄúSubject to market demand, permitting, and approval processes
the terminal could commence operations around the middle of the
next decade,‚Äù the two firms said.
The proposed terminal would further enhance gas supply diversification by providing France and Europe access to new sources of gas.
Fos Faster LNG terminal will be positioned as an independent multicustomer terminal. The business model of the terminal will be similar to the Gate terminal currently under construction in Rotterdam.
Earlier this year, Koninklijke Vopak NV said it would build and
operate a storage terminal for more than 1.1 million cu m of oil

Taiwan‚Äôs CPC Corp. officially inaugurated on July 16 the country‚Äôs second LNG terminal, this one at Taichung in the north, according to press reports. Start-up of the nearly $955 terminal was
more than a year behind schedule.
CPC‚Äôs web site, however, was not updated on the event. Other
press reports have stated delays in the pipeline have delayed completion of the terminal.
For 2009, the Taichung LNG terminal will supply 1.68 million tonnes of vaporized LNG via a subsea pipeline to the staterun 4.4-Gw Tatan electric power plant in Taoyuan County, northern
Taiwan, according to statements attributed to CPC Chairman Shih
Yen-shiang. The remaining gas will meet industrial and residential
demand in northern and central Taiwan.
Shih said combined output from the new Taichung terminal
and the existing Yungan terminal in southern Taiwan will enable
CPC to move as much as 10.5 million tpy of LNG.
Start-up of the Taichung terminal will allow CPC to import
nearly 1.6 million tonnes of LNG from Qatar this year, rising to
2.5 million tonnes in 2010 and to 3 million tonnes in 2011, the
terminal‚Äôs design capacity.

GIS Energy Data for M&A Analysis
The most trusted and utilized provider of GIS data to the pipeline
industry for M&A and asset valuation analysis.
MAPSearch¬Æ provides detailed pipeline and pipeline facility information for use in Merger and
Acquisition Analysis such as:
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

What pipeline assets does company ‚ÄúA‚Äù now own?
What gathering, processing, and storage facilities do they operate?
What local pipeline company owns assets that would be a complimentary acquisition?
If these midstream assets were acquired:
‚Ä¢ What would the combined assets look like?
‚Ä¢ What new markets could they reach?
‚Ä¢ Who would the new competitors be?
‚Ä¢ How might the locally proposed LNG facility construction impact the value of the assets?
MAPSearch tracks interstate, intrastate, and gathering system pipelines and pipeline facilities
for all of North America and provides this information in a format for users to conduct their
own analysis. By staying abreast of developments in the pipeline industry, MAPSearch provides
buyers, sellers, Ô¨Ånancers, and analysts with the information necessary to identify and evaluate
acquisition candidates.

Waxman-Markey omissions
Sixty percent of our annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are emitted
by transportation petroleum-based fuels
and coal-based electric power plants.
Nowhere in the 1,200-page WaxmanMarkey Clean Energy and Security Act
(W-M) can you find an effective substitute for those fuels.
Coal plants can be replaced by nonpolluting nuclear reactors as in France,
but nuclear is not mentioned in W-M.
Most developed countries levy taxes on
transport fuels, especially on gasoline.
That leads to fuel-efficient cars, and the
tax revenue funds and encourages the
use of energy-efficient public transport.
No mention of this approach in W-M.
Instead, we have an array of legislative mandates for renewable energy and
efficiency without any explanation of
how those mandates are to be achieved.
W-M‚Äôs elaborate cap-and-trade system
includes allowances which can be traded
in financial markets. Wall Street eagerly
waits. Polluters can earn up to 2 billion
tons of tradable offsets by supporting
renewable projects of uncertain merit in
the US and abroad, but their pollution
continues.
A complex rebate system is to protect
manufacturers whose costs for allowances affect their international competitive position. Importers can also
be required to purchase international
reserve allowances to raise import costs,
also to preserve the US competitive position. How all that will be administered is
anyone‚Äôs guess.
Electric utilities must meet 20% of
demand with renewable energy and
improved efficiency by 2020. Carbon
emissions are to be steadily reduced,
with carbon capture and sequestration
(CCS) the prime enabling technology.
There are no large-scale working CCS
installations in the world. A study from
scientists at the Universities of Wyoming and Houston estimates a need for
300,000 new injection wells for sequestration to meet W-M targets. Along with
ancillary systems and pipelines, plus CO2
separation costs, CCS costs could exceed
$1 trillion/year.
There is $4 billion to support a cash-

Petroleum Association of

the program.

W-M supports increased mileage
standards for cars and trucks while promoting E85 ethanol fuel, which reduces
mileage performance by about 30%.
The efforts of Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) have added a 49-page
amendment which excludes agriculture
and forestry from the capped sector. It
also excludes indirect land use from the
evaluation of the environmental impact
of biofuel production. Ethanol and biodiesel are exempted for 5 years from the
limits placed on other fuels, although
there is little scientific evidence of an
environmental benefit from those fuels.
The responsibility for determining
which practices are eligible for offsets
is transferred from the Environmental
Protection Agency to the Secretary of
Agriculture. This should result in more
emphasis being placed on organic type
farming practices as these are eligible for
offsets.
The bill creates a program of worker
training, education, and transition for
jobs in renewable energy, building upgrades, and climate change mitigation.
This could be administered under the
new federal agency created by W-M, the
Clean Energy Deployment Administration. There will also be a National Climate Service set up within the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
to support efforts by states to respond to

SPE Asia Pacific Health,
Safety, Security and
Environment Conference
and Exhibition, Jakarta,
(972) 952-9393, (972)

Some funds from allowance sales are set
aside to reward less developed countries
(China?) which have taken verifiable
and measurable emission reduction
programs. This is expected to open up
markets for US environmental technology. And for low-income Americans there
is a system of energy refunds to ease the
impact of higher prices resulting from
W-M.
There are physical reasons that the
Energy Information Administration is
now forecasting that renewables will
provide just over 12% of our electric
energy supply in 2020, nearly all from
hydro and burning biomass. Wind and
solar are at just 2.4% in 2020, and they
will not get renewables to the 20% commanded by W-M. Renewables lack the
energy density and cost benefit of fossil
fuels and fissionable nuclear material.
Legislative laws rarely override the laws
of physics.
Global warming is real. It is time to
grow our nuclear fleet and time to tax
fossil fuels to provide the revenue for
a world-class, electric-powered public
transport system. The marketplace will
then provide the remaining objectives of
W-M without its massive new bureaucracy.

Prudhoe‚Äôs oil and gas future
Alan Petzet
Chief EditorExploration
Forty-one years after discovery on
Alaska‚Äôs North Slope, Prudhoe Bay field
remains the largest oil-producing field
in the US.
It is approaching time for the field,
producing 400,000 b/d, to begin a
transition to gas sales, said Scott Digert,
waterflood/full field resource manager
for BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. BP‚Äôs
Thunder Horse field in the Gulf of
Mexico is a close second.
Prudhoe has produced 12.5 billion
stb of oil and appears headed towards
14 billion bbl of ultimate oil recovery,
up from the 9.6 billion bbl estimated at
discovery. Digert reckons that half the
recovery above the initial figure is due
to increased gas cycling.
The 234-sq-mile reservoir is an anchor for 25 other ANS producing fields.
BP operates Prudhoe for itself and other
owners.
Field life conceivably could reach
100 years, said Digert, who came to BP
from ARCO Oil & Gas Co. in 2000.

Prudhoe Bay today
Besides being an oil supergiant,
Prudhoe has long been known to be a
gas supergiant without a market.
Discovery well celebrations were
muted because the wells penetrated
the giant gas cap weeks before hitting
oil (OGJ, Jan. 22, 1968, p. 40; Feb. 26,
1968, p. 55).
The field is nearly fully developed,
18

Digert said. It has 2,500 penetrations,
including 1,200 active wells. Almost
all new wells are horizontals, including
Alaska‚Äôs first stacked hexalateral with
29,198 ft of hole drilled in 2008.
Prudhoe and its core satellites have
more than 1,000 producing wells, 30
gas injectors, and 140 water injectors.
Wells are drilled radially from 42
central pads. Well spacing is 160 acres
broadly and 80 acres in some areas.
Six gathering stations handle produced oil and associated gas, sending
oil to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and gas
for natural gas liquids separation and
reinjection to maintain field pressure.
The field produces as much as 8.8
bcfd of gas in winter (5 bcfd in summer) that goes into an 8.5 bcfd gas
processing plant, the world‚Äôs largest.
Then 450 MMcfd goes for fuel, making
BP Alaska‚Äôs largest gas user.
The plant extracts 70,000 b/d of
NGL, of which 25,000 b/d goes to
Kuparuk field for blending into miscible
injectant. Some NGL is blended with
produced gas to make miscible injectant
for Prudhoe, and the rest goes down the
oil pipeline.
Gas and water injection have slowed
the field‚Äôs decline rate the past 2 years
to 1-2%/year from the 7-8%/year averaged since 1988. And 450,000-600,000
b/d of water injected into the gas cap
supports at least 10,000 b/d of current
oil production and could lead to recovery of more than 150 million bbl of oil,
Digert said.

Gas outlook
The length of Prudhoe‚Äôs future
depends on continuing to produce
oil while beginning to sell its other
resource, gas.
Prudhoe, with an estimated 24 tcf of

recoverable gas, and Point Thomson, 60
miles east with more than 8 tcf and 200
million bbl of condensate estimated recoverable, are the slope‚Äôs two chief gas
reservoirs (OGJ Online, July 15, 2008).
Other gas may yet be found.
Options being evaluated to move gas
from the ANS range up to a 48-52-in., 4-5
bcfd pipeline (OGJ Online, July 6, 2009).
A 20 billion bbl resource of viscous
and heavy oil extends from western
Prudhoe across through Milne Point
and Greater Kuparuk. With viscosity in
the hundreds or thousands of centipoise, the deposit has not been proven
economic. A research group is working
on the problems.
The oil pipeline corridor‚Äôs next
license extension date is 2075.
‚ÄúAt the very high oil prices we
saw last year, there could be cases that
extend that far out,‚Äù Digert said. ‚ÄúWith
gas and with the successful major
development of heavy oil, those things
look possible. When we look at it under
today‚Äôs prices, we‚Äôre not going to make
it out that far.‚Äù
Beside the 1 million hp gas processing and compression plants is a site
where a gas pipeline consortium could
build a 2-4 bcfd gas treatment plant. It
would strip carbon dioxide, dry residue
gas, set calorific values, and compress
to 2,500 psi from 650 psi for shipment
down a gas pipeline. Gas shipments
would begin around 2018 at the earliest.
Digert said, ‚ÄúWhile Prudhoe is ready
and capable of supporting a gas sales
project in this timeframe, a project
would also benefit from having other
gas sources available at the start. This
would allow us to optimize gas offtake
from Prudhoe and maximize both oil
and gas recovery.‚Äù ‚ú¶

An upstart contradiction

20

Contradictions of energy policy emerge so
spontaneously these days in the US that it‚Äôs rare
to have the chance to warn of one before it has
fully developed and begun gorging itself on the
national welfare.
Examples abound:
‚Ä¢ Officials assert energy independence as a
guiding principle of energy policy yet withdraw
federal land from oil and gas exploration and
propose special taxation of the dominant, domestically produced energy forms.
‚Ä¢ Lawmakers and regulators claim to want to
lower the carbon intensity of energy use yet threaten to impose redundant and inevitably obstructionist federal regulation on hydraulic fracturing, a
technology that has unlocked vast potential of the
hydrocarbon lightest in carbon, natural gas.
‚Ä¢ Politicians promise ‚Äúgreen jobs‚Äù yet refuse to
acknowledge how the essential subsidies and other
imposed inefficiencies corrode employment in
more-productive sectors of the economy.
The list goes on. Contradictions like these arise
when politicians push political agendas at the
expense of national interests. Indebted to antioil
environmentalists and promoters of uneconomic
energy, politicians now in power don‚Äôt worry
about the inefficiencies of manipulating markets.
They use appeals to ‚Äúindependence‚Äù to do anything they wish, sensible or not, on energy. They
want Americans to fear worst-case scenarios about
climate change and the political instability of oil
exporters‚Äîbut not to worry about the costly futility of their remedies.

problems result from too little regulation and to
respond with too much.
Problems of regulation are nevertheless evident.
Otherwise inexplicable oil price extremes recently
have coincided with extraordinary movements
of investment funds into and out of oil futures
positions. More ominously, large maverick trades
have influenced pricing, however briefly. In the
latest reported instance, unauthorized activity by a
PVM Oil Associates Ltd. trader on June 30 elevated
futures prices unreasonably for a while.
More broadly, elaborate trading schemes based
on obscure financial mechanisms masked credit
hyperextension in the US and allowed a serious
problem to become a global crisis. The failure
of governance became only too obvious when
regulators spent the first months of economic
decline providing mistaken assurances that the
meltdown could be confined to specific markets
or was in other ways manageable. Now the few
financial institutions that have been able to repay
their federal bailout money are reporting big profits and reinstating the aristocratic bonus systems
that many observers blame at least in part for the
earlier, catastrophic excesses.
Political flammability in both cases raises
chances for intrusive governance. In both cases,
however, more regulation than before is in order.
The trading business has become too sophisticated
for its own good. Its lavish rewards for risk-taking
too easily obscure systemic exposure to risk. Its
lapses have global repercussions. It needs‚Äîcarefully‚Äîto be changed.

Trading culture

Trader‚Äôs delight

At the center of the upstart contradiction is a
trading culture that has contributed in arguable
degrees to extreme gyrations in the price of crude
oil and to financial collapse in the US. The popular
imagination, shaped as it is by media distortion
and political opportunism, thus conjures twin
scoundrels: ‚Äúspeculators‚Äù and Wall Street bankers.
In response to one, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is considering position limits on
energy commodities for speculators. In response
to the other, lawmakers have begun writing legislation to implement President Barack Obama‚Äôs
plan to overhaul the financial system. The temptation in both cases will be to overreact, to assume

Until constructive change is in place, though, a
system defined by its failures of control should not
be entrusted with a new market contrived by politics.
Yet Congress is working feverishly to do just that
with climate change legislation, which the House has
passed and on which the Senate has begun work.
The cap-and-trade system at the core of that effort would be a trader‚Äôs delight. If passed, it would
be abused‚Äînot by all traders but by scofflaws
willing to bet the market on next quarter‚Äôs bonus.
The system in present form can‚Äôt prevent that kind
of mischief. Until it‚Äôs fixed, introduction of a capand-trade scheme would be the costliest and most
irresponsible contradiction yet. ‚ú¶

COMMENT
Security Act of 2007 (EISA), Congress
and the Obama administration appear
destined to compound their mistakes in
the huge climate bill now making its way through Congress.
The House version of this bill
would require that renewable
energy sources account for 20%
of US electrical production by
2020. President Barack Obama,
both during the campaign and
in office, has asked that 25% be derived
from renewable sources by 2025.
Because of the potential for more
government mandates, some electrical
utilities are planning to build power
plants fueled with biomass. The Energy
Information Administration (EIA) is
forecasting 230 billion kw-hr of electrical energy from biomass by 2030.1
This amounts to about 5.6% of 2008
US electrical energy generation (4,110
billion kw-hr).2
Government policy-makers would
like us to believe there are vast quantities of crops, crop residues, and unused
wood waste that can be easily converted
into energy. The facts are quite different.
Let‚Äôs start with the renewable fuel
standard (RFS) that the Environmental
Protection Agency proposed on May 6.
The EISA mandates the use of 36 billion
gal/year of biofuels by 2022. It also
caps ethanol derived from corn starch
at 15 billion gal. The RFS proposed by
EPA requires the use of 16 billion gal of
cellulosic ethanol (i.e., ethanol derived
from the cellulose in plant material)
and at least 1 billion gal of biodiesel. At
present, 4 billion gal of biofuel remains
unspecified, but EPA may require up to
5 billion gal of biodiesel after 2012.3 4 5

Corn ethanol
Let‚Äôs first look at ethanol derived
from corn starch. Production of 15 billion gal of ethanol, the yield for which
22

lion bushels from 71.6 million harvested acres.6 The area of cropland needed
to produce 15 billion gal of ethanol is
39 million acres.
About 14% of US corn production
comes from irrigated land, almost all
of which is irrigated with groundwater
that is overdrafted from the Ogallala
aquifer. Last year, an area of about 9.5
million acres of corn land was irrigated,
of which about 8.9 million acres was
irrigated with groundwater from the
Ogallala aquifer.7 This irrigated acreage
consumed some 18 million acre-feet of
groundwater.8 To put this in perspective,
the average annual flow of the Colorado
River at Lee‚Äôs Ferry, Ariz., is only about
14 million acre-ft.
If the US were able to produce 15
billion gal/year of ethanol from corn
starch, how much gasoline would this
ethanol displace? The answer is about
7.5% of year 2008 gasoline consumption, estimated by the EIA in its
Monthly Energy Review of May 2009 at
8.964 million b/d. This calculation uses
approximate heat values from the same
source of 5.150 million btu/bbl of reformulated gasoline and 3.539 million
btu/bbl of fuel ethanol.
A policy that requires dedication of
39 million acres of prime cropland to
produce a crop, one seventh of which
is grown with overdrafted groundwater,
in order to replace 7.5% of US gasoline
supply hardly qualifies as environmentally sustainable and surely does little to
achieve energy independence, especially
since the renewable energy content of
corn ethanol has been found to be only
5-26%.9 The balance of the energy input to corn ethanol is primarily natural
gas and coal.

Cellulosic ethanol
Even more daunting is the mandate
for 16 billion gal of cellulosic ethanol

Calculated using an estimate of 80 lb residue/bushel barley from ‚ÄúCrop Residue, Wyoming Biomass Inventory: Crop Production and Residue, 2006,‚Äù Wyoming State Forestry Division.,
Cheyenne, Wyo., 2007. 2Calculation based on the assumption 2,000 lb residue/acre retained for erosion control, the same as wheat. 3Ethanol yield = 69 gal/ton straw. 4Calculated using
an estimate of 50 lb residue/bushel oats from source in footnote 1. 5Katrba, R., ‚ÄúThe Rumplestiltskin of Rice Straw,‚Äù Ethanol Producer Magazine, August 2007. 6Rice straw contains up to
13% silica. Because of the high silica content we have estimated an ethanol yield of 65 gal/ton straw.

by 2022. There is no commercial production of cellulosic ethanol at present. Even if commercial production is
attained, the ability of the industry to
expand production to meet these mandates is very uncertain.
More worrisome, however, is the
availability of potential feedstocks for
cellulosic ethanol. Corn produces the
most residue of any crop grown in the
US. During the 5-year period 2004-08,
when the average corn yield was 152.4
bushels/acre, the average annual residue
produced by the US corn crop was 352
million tons.10 This is based on estimated corn residue of 6,000 lb/acre for
a grain yield of 100 bushels/acre and
9,000 lb/acre for a grain yield of 150
bushels /acre.11
However, agronomists are becoming
increasingly alarmed at the prospect of
residue removal for energy production because of the deleterious effects
on soils‚Äînamely increased erosion;
reduced soil organic matter; loss of
nutrients, especially phosphorus and
potash; and soil compaction.12 13 14 15
Agronomists are advising farmers to
remove no more than 30% of corn residues.12 Corn residue yields about 72 gal
of ethanol/ton.16 If 30% of the residue
were collected from the entire US corn
crop, about 7.6 billion gal of ethanol
could be produced from the 105 million tons of residue.
In reality, probably only half of the
available residue would be collected
because of the economics and fuel consumed in transporting it to a processing plant. Four states‚ÄîIowa, Illinois,

Nebraska, and Minnesota‚Äîaccount for
about half of the US corn acreage. To
put the residue collection problem in
some perspective, collection of half of
the available residue in the US would
be the equivalent of collecting all of the
available residue in these four states.
Small grains‚Äîwheat, oats, barley,
rice‚Äîproduce much less residue than
corn. During 2004-08, wheat produced about 2.1 tons of residue per
acre.17 Agronomists have urged farmers to leave at least 1 ton/acre in place
for erosion control and soil fertility
maintenance.18 19 If the extra 1.1 tons/
acre were removed from the entire US
wheat acreage (50.7 million acres) and
converted to cellulosic ethanol, about
3.8 billion gal of ethanol could be produced. This calculation uses an ethanol
yield of 69 gal/ton of straw.19
Data for crop residue, energy content
of the residue, and potential ethanol
yield from the residue for the major
field crops are summarized in Table 1.
Heat values for specific residues appear
in Table 2.
The data in the table indicate the
maximum cellulosic ethanol production
from crop residue if all of the available
residues, in excess of those needed for

erosion protection, were collected is
about 12.4 billion gal/year. The total
energy content of these residues is only
about 2.6% of total annual US energy
consumption.
In reality, probably only half of these
residues could be economically collected. Soybeans do not produce enough
residue to make removal feasible. Hay,
the other major crop, produces no field
residue. The total acreage of the above
crops is 269 million acres‚Äîalmost 80%
of the land in the US that is used for
crop production.

Biodiesel
As noted earlier, the RFS proposed by
EPA requires the use of at least 1 billion
gal of biodiesel by 2022, although the
EPA may require use of greater volumes
of biodiesel after 2012‚Äîpossibly up to
a total of 5 billion gal.
Virtually all of the biodiesel fuel produced in the US is made from oilseeds,
primarily soybeans. Production of 1
billion gal of biodiesel will require 17
million acres of soybeans or 24% of the
US soybean crop. This is based on the
average soybean yield during 2004-08
of 41.9 bushels/acre and a biodiesel
yield of 0.02357 gal/lb.20 21 And how
much diesel fuel will these soybeans
replace? A miniscule 1.2% of the year
2008 distillate consumption reported
by EIA in May!
Since soybeans require a warm,
humid climate, they cannot be grown
in the West, even with irrigation. Consequently, soybeans and corn compete
for the same cropland. Because of the

Local approaches may help US in oil-rich areas overseas
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The US government should be ready
to engage local and state governments
overseas in addition to national officials
as it tries to secure foreign oil and gas
supplies, a US senate committee was
told on July 16.
The strategy could make a significant
difference in Nigeria, Philip Carter III,
principal deputy assistant secretary of
the US Department of State‚Äôs Bureau of
African Affairs, told the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.
‚ÄúThere have been efforts to have
international oil companies engage in
efforts to improve transparency flows,
but these have mostly involved the
national government there,‚Äù he said
during a hearing entitled ‚Äú$150 Oil:

Disruption.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe key to resolving the problems
of the Niger Delta is engaging the state
governments. The companies which are
there engage with civil governments
on several levels, but their jobs are to
pump the oil. Ours should be to help
those governments solve their pressing
problems,‚Äù Carter said.
Carter was joined by Richard L.
Morningstar, special envoy for Eurasian Energy; William J. Hudson, acting

deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau
for Near Eastern Affairs; and Richard J.
Schmierer, US ambassador to Oman,
who said that the disagreement over the
Kurdistan area‚Äôs substantial resources
has hampered Iraq‚Äôs ability to revive its
oil and gas industry.

where there‚Äôs some ways to go,‚Äù he
said.
The ultimate overall goal is to establish greater financial transparency in
overseas oil and gas producing areas,
starting with the Extractive Industries

four State Department officials agreed.
‚ÄúTransparency is a very major part of
our program in dealing with Eurasian
countries,‚Äù said Morningstar. ‚ÄúWe talk

Iran‚Äôs possibly supplying gas for the

its nuclear weapons programs. ‚ÄúWe have

Responding to committee member Jeanne Shaheen‚Äôs (D-Vt.) question
about how China‚Äôs growing energy
demand is affecting US policies toward
Middle Eastern and African oil suppliers, Carter said: ‚ÄúIt has drawn increasing
attention. China has been an active oil
investor, largely in the Sudan but also
potentially on the West Coast and in
Ghana. We see the Chinese as economic
rivals, but not as a threat to our national
energy security only so far as we work
to make sure the bidding process follows international standards.‚Äù

the Chinese have not fared well when
they have tried to seek a sweetheart

to build a pipeline to move gas from

think Turkmenistan understands that
it shouldn‚Äôt be dependent on one or

California ponders offshore oil project to ease budget crisis
Nick Snow

California‚Äôs legislature might vote
soon to authorize the first new oil
activity off Santa Barbara in 40 years
as a way to help resolve the state‚Äôs

budget crisis.
The proposal reportedly was part of
an agreement Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger reached on July 20 with majority
and minority leaders of the state‚Äôs senate and assembly to eliminate California‚Äôs $26.3 billion budget deficit. It

includes $15.5 billion in cuts, defers

and counties, several news reports said.

E15 opponents
want more tests

A

coalition of eight environmental
and public health organizations
raised objections similar to refiners‚Äô
in opposing a petition for federal approval to raise allowable US gasoline
levels to 15%.
It wasn‚Äôt surprising that refiners
opposed Growth Energy‚Äôs request for
US Environmental Protection Agency
approval to increase gasoline ethanol
levels to 15% as the public comment
period ended on July 20.
The fuel ethanol advocacy organization argues that allowing an
ethanol level higher than 10% will
increase jobs. Opponents, including the American Lung Association,
the Center for Auto Safety, the Sierra
Club, and the Natural Resources Defense Council, contend that it could
simply create problems.
Their primary concern is similar to
that of the National Petrochemical &
Refiners Association. ‚ÄúEthanol should
not be blended into gasoline at levels
higher than 10% for use in nonflexible fuel motor vehicles and nonroad
gasoline-powered engines until comprehensive and independent testing
shows that midlevel ethanol blends are
safe for consumers and do not harm
the environment or public health,‚Äù
NPRA said in its comments.

inadequate foundation upon which to
base such an important change in the
nation‚Äôs supply of gasoline.‚Äù
The eight-group coalition noted
that the 2007 Energy Independence
and Security Act included a new
requirement for the EPA administrator to make an applicant demonstrate
that a new fuel will not cause emissions device or systems failures in
off-road engines. It said that Growth
Energy has not done this.
NPRA also said that potential
approval of Growth Energy‚Äôs petition is not an effective short- or
medium-term solution to avoiding
the ‚Äúblendwall‚Äù problem caused by
the increasing conventional biofuels
volumes mandated under EISA.

Below mandate

It explained that while ethanol is
currently blended into about 75% of
all the gasoline sold in the US, mandated volumes of conventional and
cellulosic biofuels are so high that
making all gasoline 10% ethanol
will fall short of EISA‚Äôs compliance
goal.
‚ÄúHowever, EPA should not rush
approval of E15 in order to postpone
the blendwall,‚Äù it continued. ‚ÄúThe

await final legislative action on the bill,
and remain committed to work with
the state leaders to ensure the legislation allows the benefits of the historic
agreement [Plains E&P] reached with
the environmental community to come
to fruition,‚Äù a company spokesman said
on July 22.
The Houston independent producer
won support earlier this year from Get
Oil Out and other local environmental groups for the Tranquillon Ridge
project, but the state land commission
denied the application in January. The
legislature essentially would be voting
on whether to overturn that decision.
A spokeswoman for Schwarzenegger would not confirm whether the
proposal was part of the budget agreement with the legislature‚Äôs leaders.
‚ÄúThe governor and legislative leaders
have come to an agreement to solve
California‚Äôs budget deficit. Details will
be made available as the legislature
drafts language to be voted on later this
week,‚Äù she told OGJ on July 21.
Schwarzenegger has said, however,
that while he continues to oppose new
oil and gas activity off California‚Äôs coast
in general, he favors the Tranquillon
Ridge project because it would be from
an existing structure, Platform Irene,
and extend into state waters without
disturbing them.

‚ÄòRevenue and jobs‚Äô
Joe Sparano, president of the Western
States Petroleum Association in Sacramento, said, ‚ÄúIt would be new revenue.
It would not require new taxes. It
would generate state and local revenue
and jobs, all of which would help in a
state suffering a severe economic downturn and a very severe deficit.‚Äù
In Washington, US Rep. Doc Hastings
(R-Wash.), the House Natural Resources Committee‚Äôs ranking minority,
called the apparent agreement a responsible bipartisan response to California‚Äôs
11.6% unemployment rate and $26.2
billion budget shortfall. ‚ÄúBy responsibly

21.
‚ÄúThe good news is that the rest
of America can also reap economic
benefits by opening additional areas to
offshore drilling and energy production. The bad news is that the Obama
Administration continues to stand in
the way of all-of-the-above energy
development,‚Äù Hastings said, adding, ‚ÄúWith 9.5% of Americans out of
work and an unprecedented $1 trillion
national deficit, what are Democrats
waiting on?‚Äù
While the proposal could be part
of the budget agreement reached by
the so-called ‚ÄúBig Five‚Äù of California‚Äôs
government, others are criticizing it as
the legislature prepares to work on it
because it would bypass the state land
commission‚Äôs oil leasing approval authority which it has held since 1938.
‚ÄúThe governor just put California‚Äôs

Oil, gas demand drive Asian boundary disputes
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
A subcommittee of the US Senate
Foreign Relations Committee was told
that growing demand for oil and gas is
one of the main drivers of increasing
‚Äúfriction and tension‚Äù over maritime
boundaries in waters of East and Southeast Asia.
‚ÄúIn recent years, we have observed
an increase in friction and tension over
these disputes,‚Äù said US Deputy Assis-

tant Secretary of Defense Robert Scher,
referring to what he called a series of
‚Äúpersistent territorial disputes‚Äù over
maritime territories in Southeast Asia
and the South China Sea.
While Scher said the sources of
the rising friction are varied, he told
members of the Subcommittee on East
Asian and Pacific Affairs that ‚Äúincreased
demand for oil and natural gas naturally
increases the perceived stakes among
claimants in securing resource rights.‚Äù
Scher also said that China, while in-

tent on securing its own interests in the
region, ‚Äúactively opposes any activity
by other claimants to assert their own
sovereignty claims‚Äù and that ‚ÄúChina has
increased and will continue to increase
its force posture in the South China
Sea.‚Äù
Peter Dutton, associate professor at
the US Naval War College, said China
was more likely to use its position of
strength as the means to achieve its
goals, either now or in the future.

China-Vietnam tension
Meanwhile, US Deputy Assistant
Secretary of State Scot Marciel said
Washington remains concerned ‚Äúabout
tension between China and Vietnam,
as both countries seek to tap potential
oil and gas deposits that lie beneath the
South China Sea.‚Äù
Marciel noted that starting in the
summer of 2007, China told a number
of US and foreign oil and gas firms to
stop exploration work with Vietnamese
partners in the South China Sea or face
unspecified consequences in their business dealings with China.
‚ÄúWe object to any effort to intimidate US companies,‚Äù Marciel said,

US biodiesel has taken place, and that
this is harming otherwise competitive
EU industry, with potentially dire long
term effects.‚Äù
Guellner said the temporary measures would come into effect from
Mar. 13 and would remain in place for
4 months while the investigation and
contacts with stakeholders continued.
‚ÄúThe level of the measures, which
are applied together, is set at between
‚Ç¨211.20-237/tonne for the antisubsidy
duties and between ‚Ç¨23.60-208.20/
tonne for the antidumping measures,‚Äù
Guellner said.
The EU decision followed a trade investigation that said US producers sold
biodiesel to Europe at a price far below
the real cost of production, while also
receiving federal tax credits and state
subsidies.
According to EBB, ‚ÄúFor more than 2
years, US biodiesel has been sold in the
European market at a substantial discount,
at an even lower price than the vegetable
oil raw materials purchased by the EU
industry for producing biodiesel.‚Äù
As a result of such discounts, underwritten by the unfair state subsidies and
federal tax credits, Guellner said that
US exporters were able to increase their
share of the EU biodiesel market to
17% from April 2007 to March 2008.
The sharp rise was in marked contrast
to US market share in 2005, which
stood at 0.4%.
‚ÄúBy imposing dissuasive measures
the EU is paving the way for a fair and
sustainable EU biodiesel market, allowing operators to reap the benefits of
their sustained investments in biodiesel
production,‚Äù the EBB said, adding that
it is ‚Äúconfident that the definitive EU
measures will contribute to re-establishing the level-playing field EU producers
have long hoped for.‚Äù
Still, the EBB said it will remain
particularly vigilant regarding ‚Äúany
possible circumvention attempt, and is

Abu Dhabi awards $9 billion in gas project contracts
Abu Dhabi Gas Industries Ltd. (Gasco) has awarded more than $9 billion
in lump-sum turnkey contracts for engineering, procurement, construction,
and commissioning of its integrated
gas development project at Ruwais and
Habshan.
Recipients of the contracts include
a joint venture of JGC of Japan and
Tecnimont of Italy (for $4.7 billion),
Hyundai Engineering & Construction
of South Korea ($1.7 billion), a joint
venture of Petrofac of UAE and GS Engineering of South Korea ($2.1 billion),
and CB&I of the US ($533 million).
Elements of the contract are:

‚Ä¢ Ruwais storage tanks: CB&I.

Ruwais complex
The Ruwais fractionation plant, part
of the Ruwais Industrial Complex and
the Abu Dhabi onshore hydrocarbon
chain, receives feedstock from Gasco‚Äôs
NGL extraction plants at Asab, Bu Hasa,
Habshan, and Bab, as well as LPG from
the neighboring Takreer refinery (Abu
Dhabi Refinery Co.).
The plant has two parallel fractionation trains that can process 7.8 million tonnes/year (tpy) of NGL, storage

facilities, and a loading jetty to export
propane, butane, and paraffinic naphtha.
The two trains send ethane to the
neighboring Bourouge petrochemical
plant to produce ethylene. The other three
products are stored at Ruwais before
transfer via the Gasco Ruwais jetty to gas
carriers or via the refinery jetty to paraffinic naphtha tankers for markets worldwide.
Construction has been under way

The project also involves construction of new product storage. Gasco
awarded the EPC contract for the third

2005; facilities are in final stages of
construction and precommissioning in
advance of imminent start-up.

IGD project
The IGD projects are scheduled for
completion by third-quarter 2013.
At Habshan, the IGD project will
be built at a new location entitled
‚ÄúHabshan 5.‚Äù There will be four gas
processing trains with total processing

capacity of 2 bcfd. Of this, 1 bcfd will
be transported from offshore Umm
Shaif field via Das Island to enable Abu
Dhabi Marine Operating Co. to meet its
planned increase in oil production.
The remaining 1 bcfd will consist of
a mix of associated gas from increased
oil production by Abu Dhabi Co. for Onshore Oil Operations of 1.8 million b/d
from 1.4 million b/d and sour nonassociated gases from Habshan gas fields.
The Habshan 5 complex will also
have four new sulfur-recovery units
with recovery efficiency up to 99.9%.
Gasco claims this capability will reduce
emission of toxic gases to meet the
environment standards of Abu Dhabi

National Oil Co.
After commissioning of these facilities, Habshan 5 will produce 900
MMscfd of sales gas, 12,000 tpd of
NGL, and 5,000 tpd of liquid sulfur.
While the additional products (C3,
C4, C5+, and sulfur) will be exported,
ethane will be transported to the nearby
petrochemical complex for feedstock.
Gasco said the IGD project, in addition to providing sale gas to the consumers in the Emirate, will also provide
a permanent link between offshore and
onshore facilities of the ADNOC Group

The Indonesian government, seeking international investment to boost
the country‚Äôs falling output of oil, has
released 24 new oil and gas blocks for
exploration and production contracts.
Evita Legowo, director general at Indonesia‚Äôs energy ministry, said 17 of the
blocks will be offered through tenders,
while the remaining 7 blocks will be
offered directly. Proposals for direct appointments will be accepted
until July 30 and tender bids
may be submitted until Oct.
13.
The 17 blocks offered
under regular tender are:
Tomini Bay I-V; Gorontalo
Tomini I-II; North Bone;
Kolaka Lasusua; Kabena; Jampea; Buton
III; Menui Asera; Morowali; Sula I-II,
and Bird‚Äôs Head. The 7 blocks offered
directly include: Kubu; North East Ogan
Komering; Offshore West Java; Blora;
North Makassar; East Simenggaris; and
Digul.

Indonesia opens 24 oil,
gas blocks for bidding

Expected revenue

‚ÄúWe estimate the blocks contain huge
reserves, especially gas reserves.‚Äù
According to analyst Global Insight,
‚Äúthe [Indonesian] government recently
put proven and probable reserves of oil
and gas at 8.2 billion bbl and 170 tcf,
respectively, which suggests the results
of exploration could be positive.‚Äù

Eastern basin costs
Most of the blocks offered are in the
eastern part of Indonesia, and Legowo
said the government asked for a lower
production split for those blocks due to
the higher costs involved.
‚ÄúThe split is 65% for the government
and 35% for contractors,‚Äù said Legowo,
who noted that the government normally takes 80-85%.
The reduced government share
should be seen as an incentive for oil
and gas companies to operate in the
more difficult conditions in eastern part
of Indonesia, Legowo said.
According to Edy Hermantoro, director of oil and gas upstream watchdog
BPMigas, the average drilling cost for a
wildcat well off eastern Indonesia can
reach $40-50 million, while in western
Indonesia the cost is $7-8 million.

Legowo said the government expects
to earn at least $56.5 million in signing

The unitization agreement will allow
the partners to reallocate their shares
in the Jubilee unit as further field data
become available.
Currently, Tullow‚Äôs share is 34.7%.
Other partner interests are Kosmos
Energy 23.49%, Anadarko Petroleum
Corp. 23.49%, Sabre Oil & Gas 2.81%,
EO Group 1.75%, and Ghana National
Petroleum Corp. 13.75%.
Kosmos Energy operates the West
Cape Three Points block, which Jubilee

extends into, and it has secured a $750
million loan from the International Finance Corp. and other banks to fund its
share of the first phase of the project.
Kosmos will have to repay the loan
by December 2015.

Financing conÔ¨Ådence
W. Greg Dunlevy, Kosmos executive
vice-president and chief financial officer, said the loan was a major achievement considering the drying up of the
credit market. ‚ÄúThis is evidence of the
confidence of the international financial community in Kosmos‚Äô team of
seasoned executives and employees, as
well as its strong support of investment
in the emerging Ghanaian oil sector.‚Äù
Kosmos operates the West Cape Three
Points block and drilled the Mahogany-1 exploration well in 2007 which
discovered Jubilee field. It has drilled
seven consecutive successful exploration
and appraisal wells, which has proved
oil in all of them.
Although it has the cash to proceed
with Jubilee, Kosmos has been dogged
by reports of seeking buyers for its interests in the Ghanaian licenses it holds.
Companies rumored to be interested
include GNPC and India‚Äôs Oil & Natural
Gas Corp.
Industry sources told OGJ that
Kosmos did not need to sell its assets because it has obtained funding. A
company spokesman told OGJ that its
strategic alternative process continues.
‚ÄúOur debt placement was an integral
part of the process,‚Äù he said. ‚ú¶

ceeded to 2,467 m with few torque
and vibration events. Increases in mud
weight to 2.04 from 2.00 g/cc ensured
wellbore stability but caused light partial mud losses.
The well, however, acted strangely
during opening of the hole to 171‚ÅÑ2 in.
When gas-cut mud surfaced at 2,467
m, the assumption was that the well
had kicked. This led to increasing the
mud weight to 2.06 g/cc.
The hole, nevertheless, continued
to act strangely, at times losing mud,

Attempts for controlling the well
while drilling did not work, yet under
static conditions, the well, even with
the blowout preventers open, remained
stable.
Shut-in drill pipe pressure and shutin casing pressures did not suggest a
well that was kicking.

The drilling fluid used below the
16-in. casing shoe to TD was an inverse
emulsion mud.
Inverse emulsion may break down
due to contamination and mix with formation fluid, allowing the water phase
to come in contact and activate clays.

Supercharging
Some shale or clay formations occasionally have an extraneous seam
with some permeability that contains
fluids. This seam could have subnormal,
normal, or abnormal pressure; however,
in most cases the pressure is abnormal
because the shale or clays being plastic
materials transmit overburden pressure
to the fluid contained in the seam,
If a borehole penetrates the seam, a
well may kick leading to the increase in
mud weight to balance the bottomhole
pressure. The higher mud weight might
increase the bottomhole circulating
pressure higher than the pressure of the
fluids in the seam, inducing partial mud
losses into the seam.
If safety and trip margin considerations add more mud weight, as per
routine practices, annular circulating
pressures exerted during circulation
may cause the seam to balloon from the
partial mud losses.

Under static conditions, no circulation, the seam‚Äôs new pressure may be
higher than the mud hydrostatic pressure, causing the seam to vent to the
wellbore. The venting my increase the
mud level in the wellbore, pit gain, that
may appear to be a kick.
These kick and partial mud loss
cycles as well as routine increases and
decreases of lost-circulation material
to the mud may cause pressure of the
fluid within the seam to reach a supercharged state in which the pressure not
only affects the seam matrix and fluid
but also affects the surrounding shale
or clay.
The formation and seams, in time,
may reach a fluidized state and begin to
slough and cave into the wellbore, producing a high volume of large cuttings.
The sooner one recognizes the supercharging phenomenon, the sooner
one can bring stability to the wellbore
and seam.
The breakdown phase, however,
requires special and lengthy procedures
to unload the hole before resuming
normal operations.
Unloading requires circulating of the
supercharged wellbore to reduce the
amount of suspended cuttings in the
mud within the wellbore. This entails
long circulation periods during which
mud conditioning increases the mud‚Äôs
carrying capacities for lifting large
caved or sloughed cuttings to the surface and simultaneously venting of the
extra pressure of the ballooned zone.
The velocity of the cuttings is a function of gravitational forces and mud
rheology. Larger particles will reach a
depth at which they either float, do not
move, or start to fall back downhole.
Cavities create nests where annular
velocity decreases. In these areas, mud
flow regime changes from turbulent to
laminar or plug regime, inducing flow
channels. These channels allow cuttings
to accumulate in the overgauged hole
and nest that may fall downhole as soon
as circulation stops, especially when
mud properties deteriorate because of
contamination.

Worldwide ethylene
producers added more
Petrochemicals
than 7 million tonnes/
year of capacity in 2008,
according to Oil & Gas Journal‚Äôs latest
ethylene survey. Primarily due to new
plants starting up in the Middle East,
the growth in capacity represents record
additions. It is a significant increase
compared with capacity growth of 2
million tpy in 2007 and only 245,000
tpy in 2006.
Global ethylene production capacity
as of Jan. 1, 2009, was 126.7 million
tpy, an increase from 119.6 million tpy
of capacity reported in last year‚Äôs survey
(OGJ, July 28, 2008, p. 46). The additional capacity represents an increase
of nearly 6%.
The latest survey lists five new
world-scale ethylene production plants
with combined capacity of nearly 6
million tpy, and new trains in two existing plants. None of the ethylene producers surveyed reported any shutdown
plants.
Fig. 1 shows the cyclical nature of
the ethylene industry. In 2008, capacity additions were the highest in the
past 20 years, after recording the lowest addition rate in at least 20 years in
2006.

In 2009, more than 10 million tpy
of capacity is slated to start up, although
the global recession and an oversupplied are likely to make that number
far lower. In last year‚Äôs report, ethylene
producers were reporting that they
would add more than 17 million tpy of
capacity; the actual number was 10 million tpy lower.

New units
Six new ethylene plants appear
in this year‚Äôs
survey, all in Iran
and Saudi Arabia.
In addition,
another plant has

Co. achieved on-spec products in a 1.32
million tpy ethylene plant in February
2008. The Jam Petrochemical complex
is the largest ethylene producer in Iran.
The plant also produces 305,000 tpy
of propylene, 216,000 tpy of pyrolysis
gasoline, and other products.
After several delays in construction, the NPC subsidiary‚Äôs plant started
operations in December 2007 and was
officially inaugurated in June 2008.
Iran‚Äôs Marun Petrochemical Co.
inaugurated its 1.1 million tpy ethylene
plant in August 2007 and achieved production in early 2008. Ethylene from
Marun‚Äôs cracker at Bandar Imam feeds a
300,000 tpy high-density polyethylene
plant and a 400,000 tpy monoethylene
glycol plant.
In Al-Jubail, Saudi Arabia, an ethylene production plant owned by the Tasnee Petrochemical Co. was completed in
September 2008 (OGJ, Mar. 23, 2009,
p. 44). The company is a joint venture
of Tasnee, LyondellBasell, Saudi International Petrochemical Co. (Sipchem),
and Sahara Petrochemical Co.
The Tasnee plant can produce 1 million tpy of ethylene, 285,000 tpy of

largest ethylene production complexes
in the world. Nova Chemical Corp.‚Äôs
2.8-million-tpy Joffre plant retains the
top spot on the list.
Equate Petrochemical Co. is a new
listing in Table 1. The plant more than
doubled its capacity to 1.65 million tpy
when it started up a new train (Olefins
II) at its Shuaiba, Kuwait, plant.
It is now the tenth largest ethylene
production complex in the world. Dow
Chemical Co.‚Äôs 1.64-million-tpy Freeport, Tex., plant fell off the list.
Equate announced on Dec. 1, 2008,
that it was producing 850,000 tpy from
its Olefins II ethylene plant. The train
launched commercial operations on
Nov. 20, 2008.
Equate is a joint venture of Kuwait‚Äôs
Petrochemical Industries Co. (42.5%),
Dow (42.5%), Boubyan Petrochemicals
Co. (9%), and Qurain Petrochemical
Industries Co. (6%).
ChevronPhillips Chemical Co.
slightly lowered the stated capacity of
its Sweeny, Tex., plant. This year‚Äôs survey
listed the plant at 1.844 million tpy of

Lower capacity
Table 3 also shows that only two
countries showed a net decrease in capacity: the Netherlands and the US. The
total decrease in these two countries
was 310,700 tpy.
No plant announced a complete
shutdown; therefore, the capacity decreases were due to partial shutdowns
or companies restating ethylene capacity.
In the US, net increases in ChevronPhillips‚Äôs plants were offset with falling
capacity in two of Shell Chemicals‚Äô
plants. Shell reported that capacity in its
Deer Park, Tex., complex fell to 1.179
million tpy from 1.426 million tpy, and
Norco, La., decreased to 1.451 million
tpy from 1.556 million tpy. This is a
combined drop of more than 350,000
tpy.
In the Netherlands, SABIC slightly
lowered the stated capacity in its Geleen
ethylene plant.

ethylene capacity worldwide. There
were two changes in the company
order.
Iran‚Äôs NPC is a newcomer to the
list, coming in at the seventh largest
ethylene producer in the world. NPC
increased the capacity in its plants to
4.2 million tpy from 1.2 million tpy
stated in last year‚Äôs survey. This is an increase of nearly 250%. Total AS dropped
off the list due to this change.
Starting up a new ethylene plant in
Saudi Arabia allowed SABIC to move up
to the second largest ethylene producer
in the world, passing ExxonMobil Corp,

whose capacity stayed the same as
2007. SABIC‚Äôs capacity increased to 8.4
million tpy from nearly 7.2 million tpy,
an 18% rise in plants in which it fully
or partially owns.
Half of the 10 largest ethylene
producers experienced increases in
capacity of wholly owned or partially
owned plants: Dow, SABIC, LyondellBasell, NPC, and ChevronPhillips. Only
one producer, Shell, had a decrease in
capacity.

capacity slated to start up during 200913.
Last year, OGJ forecast that an unprecedented 17.4 million tpy of new
capacity would come on line in 2008,
based on responses to construction
surveys. The 7 million tpy of capacity
that started up in 2008 did not include
two plants in China, one plant in Qatar,
and two plants in Saudi Arabia that were
listed in Table 5 last year.
According to the latest OGJ construction data, almost 11 million tpy of new
capacity is slated to come on stream in
2009 (Table 5). How much will actually
start up depends on the global econom-

ic situation and demand growth.
All of the new capacity is in the
Middle East and Asia-Pacific. Six of the
projects list capacities of more than 1
million tpy each.
There are currently several new
world-scale ethylene plants under construction in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Qatar,
and the UAE.
Fig. 2 shows that Middle East ethylene production capacity is expected
to increase to about 28 million tpy in
2012 (OGJ, Mar. 23, 2009, p. 44).
These expansions will more than
double the region‚Äôs capacity from a
2007 level of 12.3 million tpy. In 2009

alone, the region is slated to add nearly
7 million tpy of capacity.
Saudi Arabia, in 2009, will start up
two major ethylene production complexes. The first phase of the PetroRabigh complex, a joint venture of Saudi
Aramco and Sumitomo Chemical, was
scheduled to start commercial production in second-quarter 2009.
The plant will produce 1.3 million tpy of ethylene and 900,000 tpy
of propylene. Feedstock to the plant is
about 95 MMscfd of ethane and 15,000
b/d of LPG.
In early 2009, SABIC‚Äôs Eastern Petrochemical Co. (Sharq III) was scheduled

to start up a 1.3 million tpy ethylene
plant in Al-Jubail.
Future plans for Saudi Arabia include
the Saudi Kayan mega complex with a
production capacity of 4 million tpy,
and a Dow Chemical-Saudi Aramco
joint venture to build a 1.2-million-tpy
ethylene plant.
By 2012, Iran‚Äôs ethylene production
capacity will increase to 8.4 million tpy
from the current 4.7 million tpy.
Qatar Petrochemical Co. (QAPCO) is
scheduled to start up a 1.3 million tpy
ethylene plant in Ras Laffan in secondhalf 2009. Other companies with an
ownership share in the plant include Total Petrochemicals, Qatar Petroleum Co.,
and Chevron Phillips Chemical Co.
Qatar Petroleum also has two joint
ventures, one with ExxonMobil and the
other with Shell. Both projects are for
crackers with capacities of more than 1
million tpy; however, neither is expected to start up before 2013.
In second-half 2009, Fujian Petrochemical Co. Ltd. is scheduled to start
up 800,000 tpy of ethylene production.
Fujian Petrochemical is a consortium of
Sinopec, which owns 50%, ExxonMobil
(25%), and Saudi Aramco (25%). The
integrated complex will also reportedly
produce 1.2 million tpy of polymers,
300,000 tpy of benzene, and 700,000
tpy of paraxylene.
PetroChina‚Äôs Dushanzi Petrochemical Co. is slated to start up a 1 million
tpy ethylene production complex near
yearend 2009. The complex will also be
capable of producing 1.5 million tpy of
polymers and 240,000 tpy of benzene.

in 2002 and in 1993 (Fig. 3).
CMAI predicted at its 2009 World
Petrochemical Conference, Mar. 25-26,
Houston, that global nameplate ethylene capacity will increase to about 145
million tpy by 2010 from 125 million
tpy in 2007. Total global demand for
ethylene will remain essentially flat at
about 115 million tpy.
‚ÄúThe absolute level of surplus capacity in the forecast is moderated by the
assumption that the level of closures
during this period will reach nearly 9
million tpy,‚Äù according to CMAI.
Similar to previous downturns in the
ethylene industry, lower profitability
leads to shutdowns of some older, highcost plants.
Closures amounting to about 2.5
million tpy have already been announced in North America and Western
Europe, according to CMAI. Its forecast suggests an additional 6.5 million
tpy will have to be shut down (Fig.
4), spread among North America (4
million tpy), Asia (3 million tpy), and
Europe (2 million tpy).
CMAI‚Äôs energy market forecast favors
light-feed cracking vs. heavy-feed cracking. Therefore, its closure assumptions
focus on assets that heavily depend on
naphtha feedstocks and may not be
integrated with refinery operations. ‚ú¶

Global markets
Ethylene markets are experiencing
weakening supply-demand conditions,
reversing a trend that started in late
2004. Record levels of excess capacity and a global recession are placing
downward pressure on ethylene prices
and operating rates.
According to Chemical Market Associates Inc. (CMAI), Houston, excess
capacity will reach as high as 17 million
tpy in 2010, or about 15% of total
demand. This compares to 7% surpluses

CORROSION‚Äî
Conclusion

New deterministic
and stochastic models for
external pitting corrosion
in underground pipelines
can help improve integriPipelines
ty and reliability analyses.
This concluding article
applies these models to Monte Carlosimulated and real pipeline pitting
corrosion data obtained from field and
in-line
inspections
(ILI).
Part
1 of
this
series (OGJ, July 20, 2009, p. 64) described a deterministic predictive model
relating pit growth to soil and pipeline
characteristics, showing it is possible to
establish a physically sound correlation
between pitting model parameters and
soil and pipeline characteristics.
Part 1 also described a continuoustime, nonhomogenous linear growth
Markov process developed for stochastically modeling external pitting corrosion in buried pipelines, showing this
type of Markov process to be particularly suitable due to the existence of a
closed form solution to the system of
Kolmogorov‚Äôs forward equations.1
Part 1‚Äôs results show Monte Carlo

laboratory studies would otherwise
prevent obtaining this information. The
probabilistic description of corrosion
pitting can realistically estimate the reliability evolution of cathodically protected, coated pipelines, for which the
worst-case corrosion rates commonly
recommended in the pipeline-corrosion
literature might be exceedingly conservative.2-5
This article first applies Part 1‚Äôs
deterministic pitting corrosion model
to experimental data obtained through
ILI and field inspections. A second
example applies the pitting corrosion
rate distribution obtained in Part 1 to
data obtained from repeated ILI. A final
example uses Part 1‚Äôs Markov chain
model to predict the time evolution of
pit-depth distribution in underground
pipelines from soil properties. These
examples show how the proposed models help improve pipeline integrity and
reliability analyses.

sion of pit-depth estimations produces
a longer predicted remaining life for
the pipeline and thus fewer scheduled
repairs. In this example, even when
the typical (average) soil conditions
observed for all collected samples were
used, a positive impact on integrity
management occurred. Collecting the
actual soil and pipe characteristics at
each exposed pipeline section would
likely further improve the accuracy
and precision of maximum pit-depth
estimations.

Example 2
The second real-life example involves
estimation of the reliability trend of a
coal-tar-coated, 82-km underground
pipeline transporting sweet gas. The
pipeline OD and nominal WT measured
355.6 mm and 9.52 mm, respectively.
MFL-ILI inspection of the pipeline,
commissioned in 1981, took place in
2002 and 2007. Fig. 2 shows the results
of these inspections, presenting distributions of the estimated true depths
of identified pits. Calibrating the ILI
reports with a methodology developed
by the authors yielded these distributions (OGJ, Sept. 13, 2004, p. 76). Fig.
2 also shows generalized extreme value
(GEV)6 distributions fitted to the calibrated pit-depth data.
Assuming the soil properties along the
pipeline to be similar to those observed
for all collected samples allowed use of
the time-independent long-term probability distribution of the pitting corrosion
rate for the all soil class (∆í(v)all) (last row

which the GEV distribution fit to the ILIderived pit depth distribution for 2002
(∆í(x)02) was used to predict the pitdepth distribution for 2007 (∆í(x)07),
tested the suitability of this selection.
This prediction used a time interval
(Œ¥) between the two inspections of 5.5
years (Equation 4).

depth distribution and to the corresponding GEV fitted distribution, supporting the use of the long-term pitting
rate distribution associated with the
all soil class to predict the evolution of
pipeline reliability with time.
After corroboration of the suitability for reliability estimations, (∆í(x)07)
(∆í(v)all) estimated the time evolution of
pipeline reliability over a 15-year period,
beginning in 2007. For the sake of comparison, a second estimation used the
pit growth-rate distribution (∆í(v)lin) estimated with a linear pit-growth model.
Assuming pits began forming upon
pipeline commissioning yielded this
estimation from the 2007-ILI pit depth
distribution. A detailed description of the
estimation of ∆í(v)lin lies elsewhere.7
Standard reliability methods predicted the time evolution of the pipeline‚Äôs
annual failure rate/km-year with regard
to corrosion-pitting-caused leakage
failures (OGJ, Jan. 6, 2003, p. 54; OGJ,
Jan. 13, 2003, p. 56). Fig. 3 shows the
results of the reliability estimations
conducted with ∆í(v)all and ∆í(v)lin. The
reliability estimates obtained with f(v)all
are much less conservative than the estimates based on the pitting rate derived
from the linear pit-growth model. Over
the time span considered (2007-22),
the annual failure rate predicted with
∆í(v)all is, on average, three times smaller
and increases much more slowly than
that predicted with f(v)lin.
If these results were to be used for
inspection planning based on a given
reliability level of 1-(5 √ó 10-3/km-yr),

an optimal reinspection interval of
about 6 years would be predicted from
the results of the reliability estimation
based on the linear pit growth model.
Using the long-term pitting rate for
all soils from this study, by contrast,
would produce a reinspection interval
of about 12 years, demonstrating that
a pipeline reliability model based on
the long-term pitting rate distributions
proposed in this work will realistically
predict longer pipeline remaining life,
longer reinspection intervals, and fewer
unnecessary repairs compared to a reliability model based on the commonly
used linear pit growth model.

Example 3
This example uses the proposed
Markov chain modeling framework
for pitting corrosion proposed in Part
1 to predict the evolution in time of
pit-depth distribution in the all soil
category. Researches set the initial damage distribution (pm(ti)) equal to the

depth distribution in the all soil class.
Equations 5-7 yielded the expected
pit-depth distribution pl(t) for different future moments in time. The values
of the parameters t0, n, and k were set
equal to those in Table 1 for the all soil
category.
Fig. 4 shows the results of these
estimations, where the histograms
represent the Monte Carlo-simulated
pit-depth distributions and the continuous red lines represent the Markov
chain-predicted distributions, pl(t).
The proposed Markov chain model can
accurately reproduce the time evolution
of pit-depth distribution. The quality
of fitting in the other soil classes was
similar to the one presented here.8 The
model can reproduce the changes observed in the shape of the pitting depth
distribution over the entire estimation
interval.
Part 1 of this article noted any of
the three extreme value distributions
(Weibull, Frechet, or Gumbel)6 could
arise as the best fit to the pitting depth

data in the investigated soils depending
on exposure time, while the starting distribution is unique for each
soil class. The proposed Markov chain
model, however, adequately reproduces
the variation in the shape of the Monte
Carlo-simulated pit-depth distributions
in all soil categories, from the beginning of the corrosion pitting damage
process through the entire time span
considered.
Another application of the proposed
Markov chain model estimated the
expected 2007 pit-depth distribution
in the pipeline from the preceding
example from the results of the 2002
ILI run. The empirical depth distribution observed in 2002 (Fig. 2) acted as
the initial distribution (pm(ti)) in the
Markov chain-based estimation. WT
divided in 0.1-mm-thick states represented the corrosion pitting damage
through a Markov chain with N = 100
states. The ratio of the number of pits
with depths in the m-th state to the
total number of pits observed during
the 2002 inspection provided estimated
probabilities (pm (ti).
Given pipeline commissioning in
1981 with soil characteristics assumed
to be those of the all category, the
values of the parameters necessary to
conduct the estimation were: ti = 21
years, t0 = 2.9 years, n = 0.780, and t
= 26.5 years (Table 1). The histogram
in Fig. 5 represents measured pit-depth
distribution in the pipeline for mid2007, while the Markov chain-predicted pitting depth distribution, obtained
with Equations 5-7, is shown with a
thick red line. The particular shape of
the Markov chain-estimated pit-depth
distribution in Fig. 5 stems from the
discrete nature of the Markov chain estimations as well as the discrete character
of the pit-depth variable and its initial
distribution pm(ti).
The high level of agreement between
the empirical pit-depth distribution
observed in 2007 and the Markov
chain-modeled distribution also points
to the accuracy of the proposed model.
Validation of its ability to correctly estimate the evolution of the pit-depth disOil & Gas Journal / July 27, 2009

tribution in the studied pipeline points
to the viability of using the proposed
model to predict the time evolution of
the pitting rate and pipeline reliability
over a given time.
Fig. 6 shows the corrosion rate
distribution ∆í(v ;ti,t) associated with
the entire population of pitting defects
2002‚Äì2012, obtained with Equations 8
and 9. The obtained pitting rate distribution is close to a GEV distribution
with a shape parameter negative yet
also close to zero. Either the Weibull
or the Gumbel subfamilies of the GEV
distribution, therefore, seem appropriate for describing the pitting rate in the
pipeline over the selected estimation
period.
One advantage the Markov chain approach has over deterministic and other
stochastic models for pitting corrosion
is its ability to capture the dependence
of pitting rate on pit depth and lifetime. It allows for an estimation of not
only the probability distribution of the
pitting rate associated with the entire
pit population (Fig. 6), but also the
pitting-rate distribution for any subpopulation within specific lifetime and
depth ranges.

Model limitations
A more complete predictive pitgrowth model would incorporate
microbial corrosion‚Äôs role, notably the
effects of sulfate-reducing bacteria,
as well as seasonal fluctuations in soil
properties and their influence on the
pitting damage process. The results described in this article apply to corroding
pipelines in contact with clay, clay loam,
and sandy clay loam soils in tropical
regions. Caution should be exercised
when applying the results to pipelines
in contact with these textural classes in
nontropical climates. ‚ú¶

New high pressure, high temperature packer element

New tool streamlines lease evaluation process

A new high pressure, high temperature
packer element, featuring newly formulated AFLAS compound, is capable of holding pressures as high as 10,000 psi and
temperatures of 450¬∫ F. continuous and
540¬∫ F. short term.
The AFLAS packer element promises a
reliable and robust solution for permanent
and retrievable sealing solutions for completion equipment. The packer element has
a high resistance to H2S, steam, and strong
acids and bases, helping to ensure that it
maintains optimum functionality within
a range of environmental parameters, the
compamy points out.
The company says AFLAS compound
has an excellent chemical, heat, and temperature resistance, suiting it for use in
packer elements for extreme environments.

The newly released web-based Lease
Opportunities Management tool is built
and deployed on the Force.com platform.
As the first component of the company‚Äôs broader Energy Desktop Solution,
the Lease Opportunities Management tool
streamlines and organizes the lease evaluation process. By allowing exploration
and production companies and departments to easily and affordably shift from
using spreadsheets and manual processes,
the Lease Opportunities tool provides an
automated, rules-driven approach that
provides a competitive advantage in terms
of evaluating and securing choice acreage
and lowering the time and cost to do so.
The company says that the Force.com
platform is a fast, secure foundation for
building and deploying demanding business applications. It says that applications
built on the Force.com platform eliminate
risk and barriers to entry.
The Energy Desktop and Lease Opportunities tool promises successfully to de-

liver enterprise class business technology
to all industry participants and at less cost
than traditional software systems. It makes
the process of valuing leases efficient‚Äî
eliminating duplication of data, driving
collaboration between land, geology,
finance, legal, and executives, and enabling
exploration and production companies to
move fast.
This tool also leverages the mobile
capabilities (for the iPhone and BlackBerry
smart phones) of the Force.com platform.
The tool helps E&P companies better
address the increasing demand and complexity of managing land assets‚Äîenhancing the ability for E&P employees to find,
use, and share information. The product
is the first in a suite of tools that will see
the addition of operations, production,
transaction, and other core E&P business
components added and fully integrated
into the Energy Desktop.

Reporting proÔ¨Åts
in recession sure
to stir public ire
The US oil and gas industry should
listen to whatever political problems befall
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for echoes from
its own experience.
The Ô¨Ånancial giant this month reported
its largest quarterly proÔ¨Åt ever‚Äî$3.44 billion. A developing view is that Goldman
Sachs, after a short ride aboard its $10 billion federal lifeboat, now feeds on others‚Äô
Ô¨Çotsam.

P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

‚ÄúWith competitors such as Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. and Bear Stearns
Cos. gone and others like Citigroup Inc.
Ô¨Çailing, Goldman appears to be pulling off
one of the biggest market-share grabs in
Wall Street history,‚Äù the Wall Street Journal
reported July 15.
Suggestions of predation join suspicions
that Goldman has for years enjoyed political favors from its many former executives
who moved into high government positions. In fact, cronyism appears in a Ô¨Çood
of allegations, which the Ô¨Årm has denied,
published in a widely circulated article by
Matt Taibbi in the July 9-23 issue of Rolling
Stone.
Taibbi says Goldman exploited six
Ô¨Ånancial bubbles, including the 2008 zoom
in oil prices. He makes his conclusions clear
early in the article by describing Goldman
as ‚Äúa great vampire squid wrapped around
the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming
its blood funnel into anything that smells
like money.‚Äù Whatever the mechanism,
Goldman does have the money to defend
itself against all this and has paid back the
bailout dollars. Its larger problem may be
timing. For Goldman, prosperity resumes
while masses of Americans struggle. As oil
companies were reminded early last year,
reporting record proÔ¨Åts during recession
can provoke outrage.
When the oil industry encountered that
embarrassment of riches, its public standing already had suffered from disclosure
in 2006, after gasoline prices jumped
following hurricane damage to Gulf Coast
production and reÔ¨Åning, of a $400 million
retirement package for ExxonMobil Chairman Lee Raymond.
At least some stir might be expected
from a public increasingly seeking unemployment beneÔ¨Åts, therefore, from
Goldman‚Äôs $11.36 billion Ô¨Årst-half reserve
for compensation and beneÔ¨Åts. According
to the Wall Street Journal, that‚Äôs enough to
pay each Goldman employee $386,429.
Of course, the analogy isn‚Äôt perfect. Taxpayers didn‚Äôt rescue any big oil companies.

Gas market seeks sign
Four consecutive weeks of smaller-than-expected injections of natural gas into
US storage triggered a 12% price jump for the front-month contract on the New York
Mercantile Exchange in mid-July in what some hoped might be the Ô¨Årst sign that
well shut-ins and reduced drilling may be decreasing supply.
The August contract bumped up to $3.67/MMbtu on July 16 after the Energy
Information Administration reported the injection of 90 bcf of gas into US storage
in the week ended July 10. Still, the price of the front-month gas contract was down
35% since the start of this year and 65% below year-ago levels. There was 2.886 tcf of
working gas in storage as of July 10, up 589 bcf from a year ago and 454 bcf above
the 5-year average.
Recent data ‚Äúshow a marked decline in weekly injection comparisons vs. 5-year
historical averages,‚Äù acknowledged Adam Sieminski, chief energy economist,
Deutsche Bank, Washington, DC. But the data may have been distorted by the Independence Day holiday. Therefore, Sieminski said, ‚ÄúIt makes sense to await a couple
more weeks of data before declaring a new trend. We actually expect a return to
more bearish variances over the next 2 weeks.‚Äù
Meanwhile, drilling permits increased 4.3% in June (adjusted for comparable
numbers of Ô¨Åling days) in 30 states monitored by Barclays Capital Inc., New York.
‚ÄúThe month-to-month increase follows seven consecutive monthly declines. Permitting levels remain depressed, currently down 57% vs. last year, and we expect
continued weakness in rig activity in the weeks and months ahead,‚Äù said Barclays
Capital analysts.
Baker Hughes Inc. reported 920 rotary rigs working in the US in the week ended
July 17. That‚Äôs down from 1,928 rigs drilling during the same period last year.
In New Orleans, analysts at Pritchard Capital Partners LLC said, ‚ÄúStrength in natural gas came from a report showing that US daily LNG usage averaged 1.44 bcf in
the second quarter, well short of the earlier estimates that called for 3-5 bcfd.‚Äù They
added, ‚ÄúAfter checks with the LNG market observers, it seems there is too much
focus on LNG.‚Äù
Current annual global LNG capacity is 180 million tonnes or 8.3 tcf of gas equivalent. However, Pritchard Capital analysts reported, ‚ÄúWe have heard LNG processors
are only running at 70% capacity, or 5.8 tcf/year.‚Äù Even if the US were to import all
global production, LNG would meet only 25% of US natural gas requirements. Unless total LNG capacity increases dramatically, the analysts said, ‚ÄúIt is unlikely that
LNG could ever meet US demand. The long-term implication for US exploration
and production companies is bullish as it necessitates the further development and
production of US shale plays.‚Äù
The China syndrome
Crude futures prices rose above $62/bbl in mid-July following ‚Äúa better-thanexpected report on economic growth in China and a late-day rally in equities,‚Äù said
analysts in the Houston ofÔ¨Åce of Raymond James & Associates Inc.
But in some quarters there was ‚Äúdisappointment that the Chinese gross domestic
product Ô¨Ågure at 7.9% was in-line with the 7.8% estimate and not as high as the plus
8% whisper number some had hoped for,‚Äù said Pritchard Capital Partners.
Improvement in the Chinese economy prompted Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix,
Zug, Switzerland, to question: ‚ÄúIf China can grow at basically 8% when the rest
of the world is into one of its deepest recessions, what will it be when consumer
demand in the West starts to resurface?‚Äù Through April and May, Chinese crude oil
runs were 650,000 b/d higher than a year ago (up 800,000 b/d in May). ‚ÄúAs we have
been writing before, in the oil markets as in the economy one needs to look East, not
West,‚Äù said Jakob.
On the other hand, Sieminski said, ‚ÄúThe main growth risk during the second half
of this year stems from a slowdown in Chinese GDP growth, which we expect will
take some time to reveal itself.‚Äù
At the Centre for Global Energy Studies, London, analysts said, ‚ÄúThe fact that the
Chinese economy is being driven in large part by state-sponsored lending should
perhaps be cause for caution, as is the long-standing suspicion that ofÔ¨Åcial Chinese
growth statistics might be biased upwards by massaged GDP deÔ¨Çators.‚Äù
Sieminski said commodity markets ‚Äúneed to be on alert for a further rise in risk
aversion levels‚Äù that could threaten the global growth outlook, global equity markets, and commodity prices. Nonetheless, Sieminski said, ‚ÄúWe are not yet convinced
that this will prevent the US economy moving out of recession from October.‚Äù

Pemex seeks larger budget to offset exchange rate
Mexico’s state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) is negotiating with the government to increase its exploration budget by 20
billion pesos ($1.53 billion) due to the 30% decline of the peso
against the US dollar.
“Pemex has an important part of its expenses in dollars—the
exchange rate slide that we have seen means that our original budget has distortions,” said Pemex exploration director Carlos Morales Gil.
The requested funds would account for about 20% of Pemex’s
exploration budget, said Morales Gil, who expressed optimism the
government would grant the additional funds, which he considers
essential for the company.
Morales Gil, who noted Pemex’s initial 2009 spending plan
projected an exchange rate level of 11.7 pesos per dollar compared
with the current 13.1 pesos per dollar, said the state firm is working with the ministry of finance to clarify the situation.
“We believe we are going to manage this in the next few weeks
or days even, so we can have a budget set to the exchange rate that
is going to be in effect all year,” he said.
Meanwhile he said Pemex estimates Mexico has 53 billion bbl
of potential reserves, most of it offshore in the Gulf of Mexico.
“That’s where 80% of what we have to look for is. We clearly know
where we have to do it,” said Morales Gil.
“These discoveries [in the gulf] were made at a time when we
need to replace reserves and try to sustain the level of production,”
he said, noting that production in January-April 2009 was 2.66
million b/d or 6.89% lower than in the same period last year.
Nonetheless, he said Pemex this year expects to add 1.05 billion bbl to its reserves, which total more than 14 billion bbl of
crude. Last year, he said, the state firm added 1.4 billion bbl to its
reserves.
In May, Pemex inaugurated its new board of directors, adding
four newly created positions and raising the number of its members to 15 in line with national oil policy reforms enacted last year
(OGJ Online, May 19, 2009).

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

The state’s high court on May 21 rejected a request by the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality to throw out a lawsuit
that a plaintiffs’ group of Arkansas producers filed against ADEQ in
Union County, Ark.
The lawsuit is an attempt to stop ADEQ from issuing two types
of general permits. Oil producers claim the Arkansas Oil & Gas
Commission and the Arkansas Pollution Control & Ecology Commission have regulatory authority over oil and gas activities.
The general permits involve construction of pits at drillsites and
for disposal of wastewater from drilling. Supreme Court Justice
Robert L. Brown said it remains unclear whether the ADEQ went
beyond its powers.
“Whether [those suing] will prevail on this claim remains to be
seen,” Brown said. “In any case, it is clear to this court that the issue
of ADEQ’s legal authority to act as it did needs further development
before the circuit courts.”
No future hearing dates have been set in Union County Circuit
court, an ADEQ spokesman told OGJ. The circuit court previously
rejected ADEQ’s request to throw out the lawsuit.
Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe has said he wants ADEQ to monitor
drilling in the Fayetteville shale. A spokesman for the governor’s
office said it’s too early to tell what effect the lawsuit might have
on ADEQ.

Massachusetts approves offshore wind farm

A Massachusetts state agency granted the state and local permits
needed for Cape Wind Associates LLC to construct a wind farm off
Massachusetts in Nantucket Sound.
The Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board on May 21
voted 7-0 to grant Cape Wind a certificate of environmental impact
and public interest that combines all state and local permits.
Cape Wind Pres. Jim Gordon of Boston said the vote ends a
7-year state regulatory review of the project, which still needs federal authorization to proceed. The $1 billion project involves 130
wind turbines over 24 sq miles in Nantucket Sound within sight of
Cape Cod residences.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Collaboration needed for N. Sea decommissioning industry to innovate and drive costs down.
Operators in the southern UK North Sea must find quick and
cost effective means to decommission oil production facilities, according to trade association Oil & Gas UK.
Decommissioning more than 300 platforms, 13,000 km of
pipeline, and 800 wells in the UK and Dutch sector of the southern
North Sea offers the potential for new technical solutions. Projects
are already under way in the area.
Paul Dymond, OGUK’s operations and supply chain director,
expects to see a critical mass of decommissioning activity within
the next 5 years. Collaboration between asset owners and effective
communication with the supply chain is important to underpin
smarter and more cost effective decommissioning, he said at a decommissioning conference in Newcastle, UK.
Gunther Newcombe, head of decommissioning at BP PLC,
recommended that contracting strategies, simplification, and the
transfer of best practice from the Gulf of Mexico would stimulate
10

Win Thornton, Chevron Corp.’s manager of international decommissioning, added that a steady stream of projects over 2 decades in the Gulf of Mexico had created a well-developed market
for decommissioning. But managing the process is difficult as operators must handle the work breakdown structure, onshore disposal and management, and different contracting strategies.

Protestors force output slow-down in Amazon
Pluspetrol Norte has reduced production at one of two oil
blocks in Peru and state energy company Petroperu may have to
halt work at its Iquitos refinery in the Amazon due to protests by
indigenous people.
“The position in respect to our operations has worsened since
we last released information on May 19,” Pluspetrol Norte said.
“We have had to reduce our production due to a lack of storage
space, and due to the ongoing situation in which we can’t transOil & Gas Journal / June 1, 2009

port petroleum on the North Peruvian pipeline,” said the company,
which produced about 32,000 b/d from the two fields in March:
16,099 b/d from Block 1-AB and 15,511 b/d from Block 8.
“Due to the reduction in production we have been obliged to
temporarily suspend the presence of our workers, suppliers, and
contract workers in the oil fields,” the company added.
Pluspetrol Norte also warned that continuation of the protests
could eventually affect the normal supply of oil to the governmentrun refinery in Iquitos.
Blocks 1AB and 8 lie in northern Peru, where indigenous communities have been protesting against a series of nine new investment decreed by the government, saying the decrees will lead to a
private-sector takeover of their lands, along with their underlying
mineral rights.
In addition to the oil pipeline, the 65-member tribes of the
Peruvian Jungle Interethnic Development Association have blocked
highways and waterways across six jungle provinces since early
April.
Apart from seeking repeal of the nine decrees, the tribes also
want the government to revise oil concessions in the Amazon jungle and establish reserves for so-called “uncontacted” tribes that
live there in voluntary isolation.
Peru President Alan Garcia, who earlier this month declared a
state of emergency and suspended some constitutional rights in
the four provinces most affected, said his government’s nine decrees are nonnegotiable. “The lands of the Amazon belong to the
entire nation, not to the small group that lives there,” Garcia said.

Processing
Iran to help Uganda construct reﬁnery
Uganda President Yoweri Museveni, siding with officials of his
government against plans by international oil companies, said his
country will build a domestic refinery with Iranian assistance.
“We are more inclined to building a refinery than exporting
unprocessed crude oil,” he said, coming down against Tullow Oil
and its partner Heritage Oil, which prefer construction of an oil
pipeline from their fields in Uganda to the Kenyan port of Mombasa to export crude.
Iran and Uganda reached an agreement concerning the refinery
project, as well as other oil and gas developments, during a 3-day
visit by Museveni to Tehran, where he held talks with Iran’s President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
A communique issued at the end of Museveni’s visit said Iran
had signed a cooperation agreement that included funding for the
entire “value chain” of Uganda’s oil production.
“Regarding the field of energy in particular, the two leaders agreed to consider cooperation in building an oil refinery in
Uganda,” the communique said, adding, “Iran also expressed its
readiness to invest in the entire value chain of Uganda’s petroleum
industry.”
Ugandan officials have long disagreed with the views of Tullow
and its partner Heritage Oil over the need to construct an oil refinery versus an export pipeline.
“Our objective is to process the oil. We don’t want to export
it. Our aim is to get an economic return, to get jobs (and) in-

Jackson’s visit includes look at Jonah gas ﬁeld
US Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa P. Jackson completed a 2-day tour of Wyoming on May 21 that included
a stop at the state’s largest developed unconventional natural gas
field.
The federal official also toured a wind farm near Cheyenne and
a coal mine near Gillette and flew over a number of coalbed methane developments. Wyoming is currently the nation’s largest net
exporter of energy, the EPA noted.
Jackson visited Wyoming at the invitation of Gov. Dave Freudenthal (D). “I appreciate her willingness to take the time to visit our
state and see on the ground how coal, natural gas, and wind power
are produced here,” he said as the visit concluded.
“This was an important opportunity for us to discuss issues including carbon sequestration, the management of water produced
in coalbed methane development, and the technologies used to
recover natural gas in unconventional fields in Wyoming,” Freudenthal added.
Jackson stopped at the Jonah field, which contains an estimated
10.5 tcf of tight sand gas, on the second day of her visit. “Wyoming is a place where economic possibilities, environmental and
human health concerns, and the pursuit of energy independence
all come together.
“As a home of wind, coal, and natural gas, Wyoming is at the
heart of America’s energy future,” she said before returning to
Washington. ✦

vestment. We don’t want anything raw to get out,” said Uganda’s
energy minister Hillary Onek at the recent East African Petroleum
Conference in Mombasa.
But Heritage vice-president for exploration and production, Brian Smith, demurred on the idea of a full-scale refinery for Uganda,
saying that estimated production was not high enough to justify
the 100,000 b/d, $1.3 billion plant the Ugandans were reported
to be considering (OGJ, Mar. 16, 2009, p. 40).

Gassco brieﬂy closed Kollsnes gas plant
Gassco AS briefly shut its 143 MMscmd Kollsnes gas processing
plant on the Norwegian North Sea coast because of a condensate
leak.
The production disruption temporarily increased British gas
prices. No personnel were injured during the incident.
“The point of leakage has been identified, and preparations for
repair work have started,” said StatoilHydro, which provides technical services to the plant. A company spokeswoman told OGJ that
the cause of the leak remained unknown.
StatoilHydro is providing gas from other sources for its customers while repairs are under way.
The processing plant at Kollsnes, west of Bergen, treats gas from
Troll, Kvitebjorn, and Visund fields. Installation of a sixth export
compressor in 2005 expanded the plant’s capacity from the original 120 MMscmd.

Abu Dhabi crude export pipeline progresses

Second Chinese LNG terminal begins operations

Germanischer Lloyd (GL) announced it will provide technical
assurance and certification of the 400-km, 48-in. OD Abu Dhabi
Crude Oil Pipeline (ADCOP). The line will transport 1-1.5 million b/d of oil to the main oil terminal (MOT) at Fujairah, UAE,
from Habshan, Abu Dhabi, bypassing the Straits of Hormuz in the
process. The 1.5 million b/d figure represents roughly 60% of the
UAE’s crude exports.
ADCOP also includes construction of 12 million bbl of storage at MOT, three subsea pipelines, a main pumping station, intermediate pump station, and three single-point mooring buoys for
deepwater tanker loading at Fujairah on the Indian Ocean coast.
Construction is scheduled to be completed in August 2011.
GL’s services on the project include third-party inspection both
during and after construction, nondestructive testing, and issuing
a certificate of compliance for the entire project. China Petroleum
Engineering & Construction Corp. (CPECC), ADCOP’s main engineering, procurement, and construction contractor, awarded the
technical assurance, risk and safety, asset management, and industrial inspection contract to GL.
CPECC awarded detailed engineering on ADCOP to Penspen in
2008.

China National Offshore Oil Corp. received the first LNG commercial cargo at its Fujian terminal earlier this month.
Unconfirmed reports said the cargo arrived aboard the
145,700-cu m Tangguh Towuti from Indonesia’s Bontang liquefaction plant. BP’s Tangguh project is contracted to deliver cargoes
to Fujian but its opening has been repeatedly delayed. Fujian is
to receive 2.6 million tonnes/year from Tangguh once the plant
is operating.
Fujian is China’s second terminal to begin operating. BP has
operated the 6.2 million tpy Dapeng LNG terminal in neighboring
Guangdong Province since 2006. The Fujian terminal was commissioned last year.
Later in 2009, CNOOC expects to open a third terminal, at
Shanghai, that initially will be able to import 3 million tpy with
expansion of another 3 million tpy on tap.

Pakistan, Iran sign gas pipeline agreements
Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari and Iran President Mahmood
Ahmadinejad signed an intergovernmental declaration May 24 to
support within the framework of their respective laws and regulations the gas deal between the oil ministries of both countries.
Zardari is in Tehran for a three-way summit with Ahmadinejad
and Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai.
A gas sale purchase agreement was signed earlier by managing
directors of the National Iranian Oil Co. and the Pakistan Interstate
Gas System, set up by the Pakistan government for the project.
The 2,100-km pipeline is to transfer Iranian gas to Pakistan.
About 1,100 km of pipeline would be laid in Iran and 1,000 km in
Pakistan. The project is to transfer about 750 MMcfd of gas. Construction of the pipeline is to be completed in 5 years.
Pakistan and Iran will sign the formal agreement for the multibillion dollar gas pipeline project in a third country within the
next 15 days, according to Asim Hussain, top energy adviser to
Islamabad, capital of Pakistan, and Pakistan leader on the pipeline
project.
UPI wire service reported Iran and Pakistan are set to sign formal agreements on the Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline by June. In that
deal, it said, Pakistan would take 2.6 bcfd from Iran’s South Pars gas
field over the next 25 years.

PNG signs landholder deal for LNG project
The government of Papua New Guinea has signed a benefitssharing agreement with landowners concerning the ExxonMobil
Corp.-led Papua New Guinea LNG (PNG LNG) project.
The agreement is worth about 20 billion kina, or about $9.5
million (Aus.), over the life of the project and gives provincial governments and landholders a 7% stake in PNG LNG. The central government will retain 12.5% interest.
The government has also committed to a number of infrastructure projects, including the construction of a sealed major
highway linking the Gulf of Papua to the country’s north coast.
It will also seal the Gulf-Southern Highlands highway and put
100 million kina towards building the first phase of a Hela city
development.
Meanwhile, it was reported that China’ Sinopec is negotiating to
buy 2 million tonnes/year of LNG from the project.
The project comprises a two-train, 6.3 million tpy liquefaction
plant near Port Moresby with gas sourced from various gas fields
in the highlands including Hides and possibly Juha.
ExxonMobil has 41.6% and operatorship of the project, Oil
Search 34.1%, Santos 17.7%, and Nippon Oil 5.4%. Landholder
interests hold the remaining 1.2%.
Papua New Guinea’s state-owned Independent Public Business Corp. is using its 17.56% stake in Oil Search to raise $1.68
billion to fund the government’s 19.4% share of the project
which will then reduce the interests pro rata held by the other
partners. ✦

The North Sea, 56 40.41 N, 2 56.19 E, 4:15 PM

With nasty corrosive fluids constantly tormenting
his control lines, Ola Hansen is really worried.

Engineered materials.
Sandvik specializes in duplex, super-duplex,
hyper-duplex steels and other advanced
alloys. They are extremely resistant to
corrosion caused by salt and aggressive
chemicals otherwise threatening oil and
gas operations. The remarkable mechanical
strength of these materials also allows
more compact system designs, lighter tube
installations and more versatile wirelines.

If you’re a senior engineer on a busy platform in the North Sea
– and responsible for subsea and downhole operations – then you
know all about the horrors your control lines are exposed to.
Especially at one kilometer below sea level and another kilometer
into the ground.
You’re also fully aware of the nightmare that would result from
a sudden failure or other serious malfunction of those missioncritical lines.
Such knowledge tends to make many people rather nervous.
While others stay remarkably assured, never seeming to give their
installations much of a thought.
Their secret? Tubulars made of engineered materials from Sandvik.

Materials that will resist just about any subsea or downhole torture
imaginable.
As the oil and gas industry is up against more hostile operating
conditions, Sandvik’s cure is more innovative metallurgical technology and more advanced materials.
By continuously developing new, higher grades of these materials,
we’re able to produce lighter, yet tougher tubes. Tubes that withstand corrosion, pressure, high temperatures and mechanical stress
better than ever before.
Engineered materials from Sandvik. Possibly your best insurance
against bad news.

posters, study guide, and web site. The
CD is a collection of 15 energy-related
songs such as “Energy & Me” and “We

science song and dance man. The video
features dances to five of the songs.
API has also teamed up with the
American Association for the Advancement of Science to create a series of

Policy can encourage development of nontraditional energy forms as either supplements to or
replacements for traditional forms. Economically, the
approaches are poles apart.

costlier option and welded its motives to the mitigation of climate change. Soon to be bonded in policy,

A report last year by the Energy Information Administration offers a basis for extrapolating the costs
of deliberately raising the use of renewable energy
to the detriment of oil and gas. According to EIA,
US subsidies for the production of renewable energy
used for electric power generation in 2007 amounted
to 82¢/MMbtu. But that encompasses all renewable
energy, including sources such as relatively lowsubsidy, high-output hydropower, which won’t grow

SECOND OF TWO PARTS

T E R E S T
The question whether success of
Alaskan tax reform with oil foretells
comparable success with natural gas
hinges on a side effect of high progressivity: a very high marginal rate. As
noted in the first part of this series, as
the progressivity charge rises it affects
the tax rate applied to all the taxed hydrocarbons (OGJ, May 25, 2009, p. 20).
This effect is most pronounced, for
example, when the production tax value (PTV) is around
$92.50/bbl, when about 93¢ of
an extra $1/bbl of revenue goes
to the state. Why? Before adding
the extra dollar, the base production tax (BPT) was 25%, and
the combined progressivity tax
(CPT) was 24.6% for a total of 49.6%.
Adding 0.4% times $92.5 is only 37¢/
bbl more in tax—but that is 37% of
the additional dollar that triggered the
higher tax. Add the 49.6% to that 37%
and, on different bases, 12.5% royalty,
9.4% income tax, and 2% property tax,
and you have reached 93% (Table 1).
The table shows the maximal marginal impact on the government’s take
of a $1 increase in oil price on a high
production tax value field. The government takes most of the financial gains
from an incremental price increase at
high oil prices. Below $92.5/bbl the

marginal effect will be smaller.
Such circumstances could encourage
producers to gold-plate field costs in
order to lower PTV. Incremental costs
are met mainly by the state with every
additional dollar per barrel of spending potentially offsetting the increased
state take from an extra dollar per
barrel of revenue (Table 2). The government revenue share absorbs most of
the incremental investment at high oil
prices. Actually, once investment credits
are factored in and even with no boost
from royalty, the marginal rate (or state
underwriting of the investment) can
reach the vicinity of 100%.
These prices have been chosen to illustrate an extreme point: In general for
energy scenarios with both higher and
lower values the marginal tax rate falls.
The rest of this article focuses on one
scenario likely to lead to a much lower
marginal tax rate: A producer of oil adds
a significant gas stream to its portfolio.

Taxes, gas sales

How will this tax work in conjunction with a major gas sale? The progressivity mechanism has been through
one test (high oil prices), and from the
state’s point of view it worked. Prices
went to levels in 2008 only previously dreamed of, and the progressivity
mechanism worked
to produce the

First-quarter E&P earnings plummet on lower prices
Marilyn Radler
Senior Editor-Economics
Laura Bell
Statistics Editor
Lower oil and gas prices and increased costs sharply reduced the earnings of some US and Canadian producers in the first 3 months of 2009. At the
same time, some producers benefited
from lower costs. Also, refiners and
marketers reported stronger earn-

24

ings from a year earlier as a result of
healthier margins and reduced costs.
A sample of 79 producers and refiners based in the US combined for a
$9.5 billion loss in the first quarter of
this year. This contrasts with earnings
of $30 billion for the same group of
companies a year earlier. In the recent
quarter, 47 of the companies posted
a loss—more than twice as many as
incurred a loss in first quarter 2008.
Meanwhile, a sample of Canadian
producers and pipeline companies
recorded a decline in earnings and

revenues for the quarter. Also, a group
of service and supply companies posted
a collective decline in first-quarter 2009
earnings and revenues as a result of a
contraction in exploration and drilling
activity.

Prices, margins
Weak worldwide oil demand
brought on by the global economic recession caused prices to sink from their
mid-2008 highs. In the first quarter
of this year, the front-month contract

closing price of crude on the New York
Mercantile Exchange averaged $43.31/
bbl, down from $97.82/bbl a year
earlier and down from $59.06/bbl in
fourth quarter 2008.
Likewise, US natural gas prices
plunged on weak demand by industrial and electric power customers
and on rising supplies in storage. The
front-month gas contract on NYMEX
averaged $4.468/MMbtu in the recent
quarter, down from $8.74/MMbtu in
first quarter 2008.
Average US cash refining margins in
the first quarter of 2009 moved sharply
lower for Gulf Coast, Midwest, and East
Coast refiners, but West Coast margins
climbed 8% from a year earlier to average $15.04/bbl, according to Muse,
Stancil & Co.
The Gulf Coast margin averaged
$4.32/bbl in this year’s first quarter,
while the East Coast margin averaged
$1.29/bbl, MSC reported.

US operators
The large, integrated US oil and gas
producers posted positive but lower
earnings in the first quarter, while
many independent operators recorded
losses.
But three of the oil and gas producers in a sample of US-based operators
swung to a first-quarter profit from
a loss position a year earlier. These
producers are Abraxas Petroleum Corp.,
Belden & Blake Corp., and Goodrich
Petroleum Corp.
Goodrich Petroleum reported that
its first-quarter earnings were positively
impacted by a $37 million gain on
derivatives not designated as hedges,
including a $21 million realized gain
and a $16 million noncash, unrealized
gain, compared with a $24.5 million
loss on such derivatives in first quarter
2008. First-quarter production volumes
were up 31% from a year earlier.
Meanwhile, just a few of the inde-

pendents, including Cabot Oil & Gas
Corp., Range Resources Corp., and
others, reported an improvement in
revenue and earnings from last year’s
first quarter.
Cabot said its recent earnings
benefited from a gain on the sale of
assets and a gain on derivatives. Range
Resources’ net income climbed to
$32.6 million from $1.7 million due to
noncash hedging gains.
ExxonMobil Corp.’s first-quarter
earnings were $4.6 billion, down 58%
from first quarter 2008 due to lower
oil and gas prices and higher operating
costs.
ExxonMobil’s upstream earnings
were $3.5 billion, down $5.282 billion
from first quarter 2008, the company
reported. Lower oil realizations reduced
earnings by $4.4 billion, while lower
gas prices cut earnings about $500
million. Higher operating expenses
reduced earnings about $300 million.

Excluding the impacts of entitlement
volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production climbed 2% during
the recent quarter from a year earlier.
ExxonMobil’s downstream earnings
were $1.133 billion, down $33 million
from first quarter 2008, and its chemical earnings of $350 million were $678
million lower than first quarter 2008.
Marathon Oil Corp. reported first
quarter 2009 net income of $282 million, down from $731 million in first
quarter 2008. E&P income was $100
million in this year’s first quarter, down
from $684 million a year earlier on
lower oil and gas prices realizations.
Marathon’s oil sands mining segment reported a $24 million loss for
the recent quarter, compared with
earnings of $27 million a year earlier. This was primarily driven by a
57% decrease in average realizations,

Third quarter.

although synthetic crude sales volumes increased slightly and operating
expenses, primarily those driven by
commodity prices, were down, the
company said.
Meanwhile, Marathon’s refining,
marketing, and transportation segment income was $159 million in the
first quarter compared with a loss of
$75 million in first quarter 2008. The
increase was primarily the result of a
higher refining and wholesale marketing gross margin, which increased
to 7.92¢/gal in the first quarter from
–0.26¢/gal in first quarter 2008.

Reﬁners
Houston-based Frontier Oil Corp.
was among the refining and marketing
companies that posted improved earnings from the first quarter of last year

despite a decline in revenues.
Frontier’s quarterly revenues were
down 29% year-on-year to $846 million. Due to lower costs, the company’s
net income in the recent quarter was
$73.5 million, up 60% from a year
earlier.
Valero Energy Corp. and Holly Corp.
also reported higher earnings on lower
revenues. Valero’s net income increased
18% to $309 million, mainly due to
higher refining margins on gasoline,
fuel oil, asphalt, and petroleum coke.
Also, refining operating expenses were
down primarily due to lower energy
costs.
Partially offsetting the increase in
first quarter results was a decline in
sour crude discounts and lower diesel
and jet-fuel margins. Throughput volumes also declined due to downtime at
certain refineries, Valero reported.

Remembering
a forgotten fuel

T

heir timing was good. Earlier
that day, US President Barack H.
Obama announced more stringent
motor fuel efficiency standards. So
the automobile and diesel engine
manufacturers at the Diesel Technology Forum’s late afternoon reception
on May 19 were feeling optimistic.
“People are warming up to the
idea that no single technology is
going to solve the climate challenge.
The economic slowdown is also making them conserve, and diesel fuel
fits the bill. The engine is very clean
and efficient. It does not require new
infrastructure. Diesel is already sold
at 42% of the nation’s gasoline stations,” explained Allen R. Schaeffer,
the forum’s executive director.
“People could start looking at it
now with a sharper eye. It’s here and
available, plus it can use biofuels. The
diesel engine, with some renewable
components, can be close to the front
of the pack,” he told me during the
group’s Capitol Hill reception.
In congressional hearings, however, it’s usually overlooked. The
ethanol lobby is stronger. Diesel is
mentioned only as biodiesel. When
federal lawmakers discuss alternatives
to gasoline, diesel is largely a forgotten fuel.

Beyond prices
Occasionally, a savvy energy
policymaker will take a closer look.
Several US House members stopped
by the reception. Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) used
a Sept. 23 hearing on high diesel
prices to consider benefits and issues
associated with using the fuel more
domestically.
30

The US Federal Trade Commission,
in a May 2, 2007, gasoline column
on its web site, said ultralow-sulfur
diesel’s potential benefits are substantial: “greater mileage, less pollution,
better cars, and health benefits on
top,” concluding, “Maybe a diesel car
is in your future.”
More than 2 years later, representatives from Audi, BMW, Mercedes,
and Volkswagen were at the Cannon House Office Building inviting
people to test-drive their diesel passenger vehicles. “We’re happy to see
them. They’ve become the face of the
business in the US,” said Matti Kylamarkula, Neste Oil vice-president, US
operations.

‘100% sure’
“I’m 100% sure that US consumers will need diesel cars. The alternative as the government attacks global
climate change is smaller vehicles,
which Americans aren’t ready to
accept,” Kylamarkula told me. Neste
already produces a renewable diesel
using palm, flax, and other vegetable
oils and is building additional refineries in Rotterdam and Singapore,
where it could help supply the US,
particularly the West Coast.
Diesel already is the dominant
US trucking fuel. Domestic engine
manufacturers’ smallest on-highway
models are for three-quarter-ton and
one-ton pickup trucks, according to
Jeff D. Jones, vice-president for sales
and market communications at Cummins Inc. “We’re aiming it at work

are greater. The tougher the duty,
the better it works in terms of fuel
economy, performance, and durability,” Jones told me. ✦

alternative technology efforts, and all
while cleaning up the environment.”

‘Gasoline prices above $4/gal’
The problem is that HR 2454 doesn’t
fit Rogers’s description, oil and gas
industry leaders maintained.
API’s Gerard said, “As a recent independent analysis shows, this inequitable approach, by itself, will produce
additional unemployment, driving
annual job destruction totals related to
the legislation to more than 1 million.
Another independent study projects job
losses more than double this: up to 2.7
million net jobs lost annually, even with
new green jobs created. According to
one of these reports, an average family will pay an additional $1,500/year
for energy and 74% more for gasoline. Today, that would mean gasoline
prices above $4/gal, an increase nearly
equivalent to a ten rise in the federal
gasoline tax.”
The bill also would compromise the
ability of US refiners to compete with
overseas oil product processors, Drevna
indicated.
“Imports of refined products, not
simply crude, could actually increase
under HR 2454, thus impeding national
energy security,” Drevna said. “American refiners, who already face stiff foreign competition in the fuels markets,
would be severely disadvantaged with
higher compliance costs under the Waxman-Markey scheme. Foreign refiners,
whose facility emissions are obviously
not addressed in HR 2454 and whose
operating costs are much lower, would
gain a distinct advantage over American
businesses in the marketplace.”
But the American Gas Association,
which represents natural gas utilities,
said the Energy and Commerce Committee took an important step when it
passed the Waxman-Markey bill. The bill
allocates emission allowances to local
distribution companies to cover the carbon emissions of their residential, commercial, and small industrial customers,
it noted. Gas utilities’ residential and
commercial customers would not be

covered by the bill’s carbon cap until
2016, it said.
In a fact sheet that it distributed
following the vote, NPRA pointed out
that US refiners must meet the earliest compliance mandate for fuels in
2013, while other sources would not
be phased in until 2014. “Compared to
other industries, domestic refiners receive a disproportionately low number
of emissions allowances to meet HR
2454’s requirements: just 2% to cover
nearly half of the total US carbon dioxide emissions as covered in the bill,” it
said.
“Assuming a conservative carbon
price of $26/ton with 2% of the emissions allowances, a domestic refinery
with 100,000 b/d of capacity would
have to spend roughly $330 million
annually if it were required to purchase
emissions allowances for the fuels
it produced. Aggregated, these costs
would total roughly $58 billion/year
for the American refining community
and escalate over time as the cost of the
program increases,” NPRA continued.

Ability to compete worldwide
The American Chemistry Council
said that, while committee members
made a number of positive changes in
the bill, several key issues related to US
energy-intensive manufacturers’ ability
to compete globally still need to be addressed.
“Specifically, we are very concerned
that the emissions allocation provision
for trade-vulnerable industries (Title
VII, Section 782) treats energy-intensive
industries differently from other US
sectors,” Cal Dooley, the group’s president, said.
“The bill assigns a baseline year
of 2005 for energy-intensives versus
a flexible, multiyear base period for
other sectors,” Dooley said. “The year
2005 was a low-emission one for the

EIA global outlook sees more
use of unconventional sources
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Unconventional sources including
biofuels could provide nearly half of
the growth in global liquid fuel supplies during 2006-30, the US Energy
Information Administration said on
May 27 in its latest International Energy
Outlook.
The forecast’s base reference case,
which does not assume any changes
from current policies, said worldwide
demand for liquids and other forms of
petroleum could rise from 85 million
b/d in 2006 to 91 million b/d in 2015
and to 107 million b/d in 2030.

“Only in the transportation sector
are liquids relatively unaffected by the
projected high world oil prices,” EIA
said. “Although world oil prices in
2030 in the IEO 2009 reference case
[$130/bbl] are 80% higher than projected in IEO 2008, liquids consumption in the world transportation sector
is only 9% lower in this year’s outlook.”
The forecast’s base reference case expects unconventional resources (including oil sands, extraheavy oil, biofuels,
coal-to-liquids, and gas-to-liquids
fuels) to become increasingly competitive. Their global production, which
was only 3.1 million b/d in 2006,
increases to 13.4 million b/d in 2030

and accounts for 13% of the world’s
total liquids supply.
“The increase in production from
unconventional resources is almost as
large as the increase for conventional
supplies,” said Howard K. Gruenspecht,
acting EIA administrator, during a presentation of the forecast at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies.
Liquids production from conventional
resources climbs 22 million b/d from
84.6 million b/d in 2006 to 106.6 million b/d in 2030 under the forecast’s
base case.

Variety of forces
Gruenspecht repeatedly emphasized
that the actual changes in demand and
prices can be influenced by a wide
range of forces including changes in
governmental policies. “Even over the
long term, it’s important to remember that prices can vary dramatically
because of a wide variety of factors,”
he said. The latest IEO also uses cases
where oil prices reach $200/bbl and
$50/bbl in 2030. It also includes two
economic growth scenarios, one where
global gross domestic product increases
2.4-2.5%/year and another with less
yearly economic growth.
Biofuels and Canadian oil sands
accounted for 78% of the increase in
total unconventional liquids production
in the base case. Biofuels production
jumps from 800,000 b/d in 2006 to
5.8 million b/d in 2030. Oil sandsbitumen production climbs from 1.2
million b/d to 4.2 million b/d during
the same period, while extraheavy oil
production grows from 600,000 b/d
to 1.2 million b/d and coal-to-liquids
production increase from 200,000 b/d
to 1.2 million b/d.
“Recent analyses suggest that the
recovery act legislation early this year,
which was not included in our forecast model, will increase the use of
renewable energy sources in the US.
Wind power could almost double. We
certainly don’t believe that fossil fuels
are done, but renewables are the fastest
growing segment,” said Gruenspecht.
The forecast’s base case predicted a

the impact would be profound,” Gruenspecht said.
The forecast also projected that carbon dioxide emissions worldwide could
climb 39% to 40.4 million tonnes in
2030 from 29 million tonnes in 2006.
“With strong economic growth and
continued heavy reliance on fossil fuels
expected for most of the non-OECD
economies, most of the increase in
[CO2] emissions is projected to occur
among the developing, non-OECD nations,” it said.
Gruenspecht said that while government actions to address global climate
change could significantly affect prices
and production, it’s far from certain
that India and China, where some of
the biggest increases in demand are
expected, would be willing to adopt
policies that have been proposed in the
US.

49-tcf increase in worldwide natural gas
consumption from 104 tcf in 2006 to
153 tcf in 2030. “To meet the projected
growth in demand for gas, the world’s
producers will need to increase annual
production in 2030 to a level that is
49 tcf higher than the 2006 level,” it
said. Much of the additional production
could come from countries outside the
Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development, it added.
Within the OECD, where IEA expects
gas production to climb 7.8 tcf from
2006 to 2030, the largest increase in a
single country, 5.3 tcf, is predicted for
the US. “Unconventional natural gas
production is the largest contributor
to growth in US production, as rising
prices and improvements in drilling technology provide the economic
incentives necessary for exploitation
of more costly resources,” the forecast
said.

WoodMac: No gas price rebound seen in near term
Marilyn Radler
Senior Editor-Economics
Weakness in global natural gas
markets will delay a recovery in US
gas prices and rig counts. Exacerbating the weakness in gas demand has
been a marked downturn in demand
for electric power by both industrial
and residential customers, analysts with
the research and consulting firm Wood
Mackenzie told reporters on May 20.
The economic recession has had a
big impact on US natural gas, electric
power, and coal markets. The contractions in the economy during fourth
quarter 2008 and first quarter 2009

led to a contraction in power demand
at a time when gas supply was increasing from successful development of
shale gas and from an increase in LNG
imports.
Speaking on power markets, George
Given, WoodMac’s head of global power
research, said he expects the global economic recession will last several more
quarters.
Industrial electric power loads were
down sharply in the first quarter, Given
said, and residential demand for power
has declined more sharply than expected based on the extent of the contraction in gross domestic product. Given
said the current downturn increases the

likelihood that electric power plants
will be mothballed and retired to balance supply and demand.
Although gas rigs have been laid
down drastically since September 2008
in response to a gas supply overload
and the resulting crash in prices, an
upswing is not in the offing next year,
according to Jen Snyder, principal analyst for North America gas and power
research at WoodMac.

Snyder said a gas price recovery will
not come from a lower rig count, but a
recovery in gas prices instead will result
from a recovery in gas demand. There
will be a modest upswing in GDP in
2010, she said, but gas demand recovery will lag until 2012. In the meantime, Snyder sees little upside potential
for gas prices.
The US gas market faces three key
challenges in the short-to-midterm,

Snyder noted. The first challenging
condition is a combination of low demand and plentiful coal capacity in the
electric power market.
Also posing a challenge to the US gas
market is LNG, as there is currently a
wave of global liquefaction capacity and
oversupply in Europe and Asia. Time
lags between drilling decisions and
supply responses are the third key challenge to the gas market, Snyder said. ✦

Philippines picks
on ‘Big Three’

T

he oil and gas industry seems
to have become the whipping
boy of choice these days. It’s not just
environmentalists this time, but the
Philippines government and a handful of price activists.
Last week, the Philippines Department of Justice subpoenaed
executives of Petron Corp., Chevron
Philippines Inc., and Pilipinas Shell
Petroleum following a complaint that
they violated the Oil Deregulation
Law.
The subpoenas followed a complaint filed by Cebu Gov. Gwendolyn Garcia against the so-called ‘Big
Three’ for imposing higher oil prices
in her province than in Metro Manila
and other areas.
In an interview, Garcia said her
office found by “mere comparison”
that fuel prices in Cebu are 5-8 pesos
higher than those of Metro Manila
and Mindanao.
She said the oil firms claimed that
prices of their petroleum products
are higher in Cebu because of the
costs for transportation of their fuel
to the provinces—a point she did not
accept.

(Bayan), Petron, Shell, and Chevron
are earning nearly 164 million pesos
a day from selling allegedly overpriced petroleum products.
Based on its estimates, Bayan said
all petroleum products on the average
were overpriced by 5.11 pesos/l.
“Petron is earning 76.64 million
pesos every day from overpriced oil.
Shell, on the other hand, is earning 59.21 million pesos daily and
Chevron, 27.92 million pesos,” Bayan
said.

Protest rally

The group made the allegation as
its members held a protest rally in
front of Shell’s main office in Makati
City to condemn alleged abuses of oil
companies and to press for the repeal
of—guess what?—the Oil Deregulation Law.
According to the group, the Oil
Deregulation Law did not dismantle
the oil cartel but even made it stronger because the important regulatory
functions of government, such as
control on price adjustments, were
taken away.

current legislation “with minor adjustments.”
“I have no reason to believe that the
government will take any type of stance
that will discourage private companies
from investing,” he said.
Speeding up investment into the area
will depend on the conditions offered,
Dias said, noting that there are competing oil projects in Russia, Africa, and
other locales around the world.
The Brazilian government, under instructions from Lula, has been considering possible changes to the country’s
investment laws that could work against
the interests of international oil companies due to the ease of discovering oil
and gas in the presalt layer.
Lobao, who favors legal changes that
would give priority to investment by
Petrobras, underlined the ease of discovery in the presalt layer recently.
“Whenever a drill is placed anywhere in the world, there’s a chance
that nothing will be found,” he said.
“There’s no such risk in subsalt, it’s just
a matter of launching the hook and
catching the fish,” the minister said.
Meanwhile, Petrobras gas and energy
director Maria das Gracas Foster said the
firm will announce the results of studies into how to ship gas extracted from
offshore subsalt finds by 2011.
She said that Petrobras had to decide
whether to develop projects alone or
with partners, adding that its initial
idea is to liquefy the gas offshore on a
platform. ✦

Cepu oil ﬂow may be delayed, Indonesia lawmakers told
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Production of 20,000 b/d of oil
from Indonesia’s Cepu block, which
the government had hoped would play
a major role in boosting the country’s
output, may take longer than expected,
lawmakers have been told.
“The facilities have the capacity
of 20,000 b/d,” said Achmad Luthfi,
deputy for planning at state oil and
gas regulator BPMigas. “We expect the
facilities to begin production in August,
but the first production, of course, will
not immediately reach 20,000 b/d.”
Luthfi told lawmakers during a
hearing with the Indonesian House of
Representatives Commission VII, which
oversees energy and mineral resources,

that production from the block is epected to reach production of 20,000 b/d
sometime in 2010. Luthfi ’s statements
reflect a change in government views
that earlier expressed confidence Cepu
block would begin producing 20,000
b/d in 2009—even including the figure
in its 2009 state budget.
The government also expected
that from December 2009 the block’s
production would continue to increase
from 20,000 b/d until it reached peak
output of more than 150,000 b/d.
However, Luthfi said the level of
production from Cepu would remain
at 20,000 b/d until as late as the third
quarter of 2011. “What I have informed
you [of] was a reality,” said Luthfi in
responses to strong criticism from some
of the legislators.

ExxonMobil Corp. spokesman Maman Budiman did not give a date as to
when the company expects the block to
reach its peak production, saying only
that this would be “as soon as possible.”
Budiman said, “Currently, the main
facilities with the production capacity
of 165,000 b/d [are] in the process of
preparation for the [engineering, procurement, and construction] contract
tender.”
Cepu block lies on the border of East
Java and Central Java and is said to hold
proved reserves of 600 million bbl of
oil and 1.7 tcf of natural gas.
ExxonMobil subsidiary Mobil Cepu
Ltd. and state-owned PT Pertamina each
hold a 45% stake in the block, with
the remaining 10% controlled by local
government administrations. ✦

First, a synthetic seismogram is generated to mark the geologic horizons.
The methodology introduced here is a
calculation of sonic drift from seismic
and well data, which greatly improved
the results by removing anisotropy
from the synthetic seismogram by
calculating the velocity drift using common depth point and log data.
High pressure zone calculations
are made by using log data. The plot
between pressure and velocity indicated the velocity drop for the Sui Main
limestone, which was indicated as a
high pressure zone from seismic data
calculations.
For pore pressure, distortion in pressure values is observed along with the
main increasing pressure trend. These
distortions may be due to the presence
of any fluid or other material in the
pore spaces.

Area geology
Geologically
the investigated
area is in the Mari
Kandhkot high,
central Indus basin
of Pakistan.
It is bounded
on the north by
the Sargodha high,
Indian shield on
the east, marginal
zone of the Indian
plate on the west,
and the Sukhar rift
in the south.2
The surface is
covered by alluvium of the Indus
River floodplain.
The main potential
source rocks are
the Sembar shales.
The shales of the Mughalkot fomation,
the Ranikot formation, and the Sirki
formation are also considered for their
source potential.5
The Sui Main limestone and Sui Upper limestone are the main producer,
whereas the limestone of the Habib
Rahi formation is considered as a secondary reservoir.6 7
The Sui Main is a closed-system
reservoir, having a huge common
aquifer system with all the known and
unknown hydrocarbon fields perched
at different hydrostatic levels. Being a
closed-system reservoir, the gas pools
are expected to experience weak aquifer
support during fields’ producing lives.
This phenomenon has so far been
observed in fields that are in a mature
stage of production, like Sui field.1
Besides Qadirpur, the Sui Main
limestone is gas bearing in many Indus
basin fields (Fig. 2). Eocene limestones
such as Sui Main have good porosity because of their development on
a stable platform, while timely gas

Detection of overpressure before
drilling is more useful as precautions
can be taken and planning can be done
accordingly.
Reflection seismic methods are
commonly used for this purpose and
exploit the fact that overpressured intervals have lower velocities and imped-

economic subsurface drilling.
The importance of determination of this information
has gradually been realized
as some major well disasters
have led to lives lost and
adverse publicity. Besides
drilling a well, the only way
to predict potential hazards
like overpressured subsurface
zones is through the use of
seismic surveys.9
The study involves the
application of interval velocities which are important
for studying the behavior
of rocks and their transit
time, porosity, density, pressure, etc. Velocities slow in
hydrocarbon zones, including the Sui Main limestone
(Fig. 5). The overall behavior
of interval velocities for the
investigated area and around
the well is shown in Figs. 3 and 4.
The zones where velocities drop are
hydrocarbon zones, and pressure values
rise in these zones for the Sui Main
limestone. The estimation of pore pressures from seismic data uses seismically
derived velocities to infer the subsurface
formation pore pressure. The overpressure zone for the Sui Main limestone
is estimated first from seismic data
in which we used interval velocities.
Interval velocities are used in the form

the preservation of the porosity. The limestone reservoir
in this region has following
types of porosities:
• Matrix microporosity.
• Mouldic porosity.
• Vugular porosity.
• Intragranular porosity.
• Intercrystalline porosity.
The most common porosity observed is the matrix microporosity system that is developed by the framework of
clay-sized carbonate matrix.

Since our target is the Sui

an isointerval velocity section to observe the velocity

In well data sonic and
density logs are used for
synthetic seismogram to
mark the geologic horizons as shown in Fig. 6. The
calculated drift is shown in
Fig. 7. The main function
of sonic drift is to remove
the anisotropy from well
velocity so that a synthetic
seismogram can be generated
without anisotropy to mark
the geologic horizons.
Then the concept of sonic
drift is introduced to remove
the anisotropy from the velocities. The drift is calculated
by using the CDP data and
well data by taking the difference between log velocity
and seismic velocities. After
sonic drift calculations, again
a synthetic seismogram is
generated, as shown in Fig. 8,
that is more precise and accurate than
the previous synthetic seismogram.
Overpressure in sedimentary basins
has been attributed to different mechanisms, but the main ones are related
to increase in stress and in situ fluid
generating mechanisms.12 The ability
of each of these processes to generate overpressure depends on the rock
and fluid properties of the sedimentary
rocks and their rate of change under the
normal range of basin conditions like
increases in stress, secondary pressure
mechanisms, structural uplift, etc.13
Changes in pore pressure can be
recognized on regular formation evaluation tools such as sonic, resistivity, porosity, and density logs. These logs show
the effects of pore pressure because of
the relationship between compaction,
porosity, density, and the electrical and
acoustic properties of sediments.14
As a rock compacts, the porosity is
reduced and the density increases (Fig.
9), which also causes the bulk modulus and shear modulus to rise because
of increases in grain contact area and
grain contact stress. In this study, highpressure zone calculation is made by
using log data. After calculating pressure

and topside samples cannot meet these
needs.
The scope says that sampling at or
near the wellhead can provide samples
that represent the fluid flowing through
the meter, yielding more accurate fluid
properties and more accurate multiphase measurements than the current
costly and inaccurate methods for
determining gas properties via topside
samples.
Its plan to develop a method for
ROV-deployed subsea sampling will
provide a means to capture representative fluid samples at the multiphase meter and other locations at various times
throughout the life of the well.
The proposed work will develop a
standardized, ROV-deployed sampling
system that gathers subsea samples in
situ, near the well, resulting in more
timely and accurate fluid properties for
improved allocation, well monitoring
and diagnostics, and reservoir management.
This sampling part of the project will

evaluate the potential of existing sample
systems and conceptual designs deployed via ROV. The work also includes
selection, development, and testing
of a candidate system with an ROV, as
well as development of draft standards
for sampling connections (interfaces),
tools, equipment, and operations.

ROV assisted measurement
The project’s scope notes that verification of deepwater subsea flowmeters
is key to removing risk from both the
allocation of revenue among producers and the collection of royalties in US
federal waters. It says while the meters
may measure multiphase flow from
wells when they are first installed, this
becomes an increasingly difficult task
as fields and equipment age. This drift
away from correct operation will lead
to incorrect fiscal allocation of revenues
and assessment of royalties.
Hall noted that the Canyon Express
development in the Gulf of Mexico
was an example of the need for this

technology. Canyon Express involved
production from eight wells in three
fields with several owners and differing royalty rates commingled in two
flowlines. Each well initially produced
gas with small amounts of condensate
and, in a few cases, water. The production balance from the two flowlines
with topside separator measurements
was about 6-8%, but this deteriorated
to 15-25% within a few months.1
At that point, total production from
all wells averaged about 450 MMscfd,
so that a 20% imbalance represented 90
MMscfd, or more than $250,000/day
at the prevailing 2003 prices of 2003.1
Fig. 2 shows the fields in 2003 (OGJ,
May 19, 2003, p. 64).
The project’s scope for this second task is for developing methods to
convey measurement equipment to the
wellsite where it will be clamped on
at a predefined position. It expects that
production allocations will improve by
making and comparing measurements

properties, system configurations (such
as commingled flow), and pipeline

It notes that knowledge of systemwide uncertainty will facilitate verification of meter performance and fair allocation of produced fluids, provide early
indication of measurement problems
anywhere in the system, and provide
all parties (vendors, operators, partners,
service companies, and regulatory agencies) a realistic picture of the measurement quality. ✦

in Taiwan’s crude throughput. With a
significantly lower demand, Taiwan is
likely to remain a net product exporter
throughout the forecast period by
2015.

Thailand
In 2009, Thailand’s refining sector faces the challenge of operating
in an environment of flat to declining
demand for all products except for LPG.
The initial response of the refining sec-

tor is to export production surpluses
into the region, which already has a
surplus in petroleum products. Thailand will need to keep utilization low
at 81%.

Despite the reduction in utilization,
Asian crude throughput in 2009 and
2010 will still be higher than seen in
2008 due to the increased refining
capacity coming on stream in 2009. The
major changes to refinery capacity are
in China and India. Tables 1 and 2 show
calculations on product balances for
China and India.
Between 2008 and 2010, China
will reduce its import requirements
by around two-thirds due to increased
refining capacity and lower demand
growth. China is adding 776,000 b/d
of crude capacity in 2009, while its demand will grow by only 182,000 b/d.
Despite a reduction in refinery utilization, China will still have more product
output in 2009 and 2010, compared
with 2008.
China will be self-sufficient in

Dung Quat started up in February
2009 (OGJ Online, Feb. 27, 2009). The
refinery will start up at around 30%,
reaching full capacity by yearend 2009.
Vietnam has sharply reduced its products import program in anticipation of
lower demand and refinery startup.
Vietnam is product deficit and its refinery has a massive residue cracker and
reformer. The assumption we made was
that Dung Quat will run at maximum in
second-half 2009.

around 40,000 b/d.
In contrast, Thaioil is well upgraded
and has a history of running at more
than 100% of nameplate capacity.
Thailoil may have to reduce its utilization slightly. Chevron’s refinery has
upgrading plans also but is sensitive to
economics. We expect it to reduce crude
throughput.
In early 2009, Bangchak completed
its long-awaited hydrocracker that will
shift it close to maximum capacity. PTT

390,000 b/d in 2008 down to 310,000
b/d in 2009.
Despite a reduction in utilization,
India will also increase its product
exports in 2009 and 2010. India is adding 674,000 b/d of refining capacity,
while its demand will increase by only
66,000 b/d in 2009. Because import
requirements from Northwest Europe
and the US are falling, India will have to
export more petroleum products to the
Middle East, Africa, Southern Europe, as
well as Asia.

Implications
On average, Asia-Pacific refinery
utilization in 2009 and 2010 will fall
to levels last seen in 2002. For those
refineries that operate where domestic
demand can absorb the refinery output,
however, the downturn in utilization
will be less dramatic (Fig. 4).
Despite the current credit crisis,
the future is not all gloom and doom:
Demand for oil products, especially in
the developing countries in Asia-Pacific,
will increase. The regional demand for
oil products will catch up again with
the growing refining capacity.
On positive impact of the crisis lies
in the reality check it has brought to
the exuberance that led to some refiners to expand capacity at breakneck
speed. Witnessing the drop in refinery
margins, national oil companies, and
private and local refiners have begun to
rethink their growth strategies.
Furthermore, those refiners that
are still gung-ho to expand for political, strategic, or whatever reasons may
face difficulties in getting the necessary
financing from banks that are more
conservative in their lending practices.
Due to delays in refinery buildup
beyond 2010 and the expected recovery in oil demand, existing refineries
should expect a mild recovery in refining margins after 2010. Unfortunately,
this window of improved margins may
close as Middle East expansions come
on line middecade. ✦

article (next week) will detail a leak that
occurred despite these efforts and the
response to it.

Background
Forties field began producing in
1975. Production from the field peaked
in 1978 at 520,000 b/d. Acquired by
Apache in 2003, the field still ranks in
the top four North Sea fields in production and reserves even after having
produced more than any other North
Sea field: roughly 2.6 billion bbl to date.
Apache raised production from 42,000
b/d to a peak of 81,000 b/d. In 2006,
average daily production exceeded
58,000 b/d.1
Forties field consists of five platforms, Forties Alpha, Bravo, Charlie,
Delta, and Echo (Fig. 1). Forties Charlie
acts as the central hub for all Forties
production as well as for several other
UK sector North Sea fields, and ships

Low oil prices in the 1990s led to
cuts and cost savings throughout the
UK North Sea. The corrosion consequences of many of the operational
deficiencies of the 1990s have only
recently become apparent. Higher
oil prices and increased emphasis on
maintenance of ageing pipelines have

prompted operators’ efforts to stabilize
the current corrosion situation and,
where required, take remedial action.
Apache found a number of pipeline
corrosion issues requiring examination
on taking ownership of Forties. This
article examines integrity issues tied to
the in-line inspection program, including:
• Microbial-influenced corrosion
(MIC) modeling of Forties’ in-field
pipelines, operational pigging, and
water cut control.
• An intelligent pig run that failed to
identify a defect, leading to a subsequent leak.

• The importance of rapid response
when pipeline integrity issues occur.

MIC, modeling
CO2 corrosion modeling and risk
assessment have established MIC as the
highest risk corrosion mechanism for
in-field oil transport pipelines.2
Low separator pressures and high
levels of corrosion inhibition kept the
probability of CO2 corrosion in the
oil transport lines low. The in-field oil
transport lines act as feed source for
inhibitor for the entire Forties pipeline
system, requiring the high levels of corrosion inhibition. These lines, however,

Microbial corrosion modeling,
developed by Pots,3 sheds light on these
issues. Parameters influencing MIC rates
include temperature, flow rate, water
cut, pigging frequency, and biocide

Pots microbial corrosion model on Forties Alpha to Forties Charlie and Forties

Installed in 1975, the Delta-to-Charlie pipeline received its first intelligent
pigging in 1998. Risers had remained
in relatively good condition. Pitting and
axial grooving damage, however, existed
at the 6 o’clock position of the transport line. Pipeline wall penetration and

maintaining even 0.2% water entrainment.
Design of many North Sea facilities’
pipelines envisioned peak oil flows well
more than current rates of ≤1 m/sec.
A 1-2% water cut assumption under
these circumstances is not an acceptable
integrity criterion.
Processed oil water cuts in Forties
field under Apache have typically measured <0.5%. Flow rates in the infield
oil transport lines, however, are <1 m/
sec and the water entrainment capability of the relatively light Forties field
crude will be lower than this value. The
key performance indicator (KPI) for
water cut now reflects this situation and
provides a stepped water content target
based on pipeline flow velocity. Table 2
shows the modified KPI.

separate axes (vs. the one or two used
by traditional MFL tools) enabling detection of general and axial defects from
the same inspection data and offering
improved sizing capability compared
with traditional MFL tools. Table 4 offers
a comparison of sizing capabilities.
Anticipated flow velocities in the
pipelines of less than the minimum 1
m/sec for standard MFL required use of
the GE system with its minimum velocity of 0.3 m/sec. Delays in performing
the surveys, however, pushed inspection
of the Forties Bravo to Charlie pipeline
to after the change from transmission
of processed crude oil to the direct export of multiphase water-crude oil-gas,
resulting in increased flow velocity.

A repair program proposed for the
pipeline was to address the highest
metal-loss features, with additional
repairs occurring during the pipeline’s
remaining life (to 2020).
The combination of predicted
lifetime repair costs and future risk of
leakage prompted a decision to replace
the pipeline. Agreements for supply of
line pipe and installation of the replacement pipeline occurred within days.

From the Subscribers Only area of

Treasury: Oil, gas
‘overproduction’ a
threat to security
For oil and gas, the national-security
argument has always been a two-edged
sword. The back edge now slashes savagely.
US producers see security as a reason to encourage domestic production of
oil and gas. Their position makes perfect
sense.
But the politics of energy is rarely
sensible—less so now than ever.

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

When producers base their policy arguments on security, they traditionally have
had in mind the benign goal of lowering
US dependence on foreign oil by raising
domestic production.
The back edge of the security argument
pursues something quite different: lowering dependence on foreign by lowering the
use of oil altogether. And one way to lower
the use of oil is to produce less.
The back-edge logic undergirds a Department of Treasury report explaining the
Obama administration’s revenue assumptions in its budget proposal for ﬁscal 2010.
The budget repeals a series of tax
measures crucial to independent producers—especially small producers—such
as percentage depletion and expensing
of intangible drilling costs. It also denies
oil and gas companies of all sizes use of
the manufacturing deduction available to
companies in other industries since 2004 as
a way to help them compete internationally.
In each case, the “reason” offered by
Treasury reads like this: “The [measure or
its result], like other oil and gas preferences
the administration proposes to repeal,
distorts markets by encouraging more
investment in the oil and gas industry than
would occur under a neutral system. To the
extent the [measure or result] encourages
overproduction of oil and gas, it is detrimental to long-term energy security and is
also inconsistent with the administration’s
policy of reducing carbon emissions and
encouraging the use of renewable energy
sources through a cap-and-trade program
[emphasis added].”
The ﬁrst slash thus amputates the
correlation between domestic oil and gas
production and energy security—the frontedge security argument.
If the budget passes, the next lacerations will befall oil and gas production.
They’ll be deep. Confronted with shrunken
access to economically viable energy and
the need to pay for costlier alternatives,
Americans who buy fuel and pay taxes will
do their bleeding later.

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

Crude tops $62/bbl
On May 20, its ﬁrst day in the front month position, the July contract for benchmark US sweet, light crudes escalated $1.94 to $62.04/bbl on the New York Mercantile Exchange, marking the ﬁrst closing above $60/bbl since early November.
Crude futures were spurred past $60/bbl resistance by gains in the equity market,
a weak US dollar, and the latest wave of unrest in the Niger Delta, with raids on both
oil facilities and militants’ camps reported. However, July crude retreated to $61.05/
bbl in the next session as major US equity stock indexes were hammered and the
dollar gained in value.
Nevertheless, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 2% and a
sharp drop in the price of natural gas, the fact that crude was able to sustain above
$60/bbl was “further conﬁrmation that crude oil is starting to have a trading life of
its own rather than being a pure correlation to equities that even a 5-year-old could
trade,” said Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland.
In New Orleans, analysts at Pritchard Capital Partners LLC said, “On a historic
basis at 17 times the price of natural gas, oil is trading way above the historical 7:10
ratio. However, concerns over the dollar and its sovereign credit rating may help
crude hold the $60 level provided investors see crude as an alternative to the dollar.”
At the Centre for Global Energy Studies (CGES), London, analysts said, “The oil
futures market remains buoyant, despite ample oil inventories in the US and Europe
and over 130 million bbl of oil stored at sea, while US reﬁnery utilization remains
low.”
They said, “The current economic situation remains unremittingly bleak—US
housing starts in April were at their lowest level since records began, and Japan has
posted ghastly ﬁrst quarter gross domestic product ﬁgures.” Nonetheless, CGES
analysts said, “Global oil demand could be at a turning point, and oil prices will ﬁnd
more support from the fundamentals if there is a stock draw during this quarter, as
the Centre expects.”
Demand is not nearly as feeble as it was in the ﬁrst quarter, said CGES analysts.
“During this quarter consumer inventories were run down in most industries, causing stocks to rise at the manufacturing or extraction stage, but such a process cannot
carry on indeﬁnitely. In the oil market, the secondary and tertiary stocks have been
run down so far, and when these come close to tank bottoms a draw down of primary stocks should begin. Indeed, this looks to have already begun in the US,” they
said.
Meanwhile, the main challenge for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries is to maintain a high level of compliance with the group’s ofﬁcial target.
“With Nigeria in disarray, other members might well be tempted to make up this
‘shortfall,’” warned CGES analysts.
Natural gas
During May 21 trading, analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc. said, “The real ﬁreworks were in the gas market where prices plummeted
9%”—the biggest 1-day drop in natural gas futures prices since August 2007. That
came after the Energy Information Administration reported the injection of 103 bcf of
natural gas into US underground storage in the week ended May 15. It put working
gas in storage at 2.1 tcf, up 514 bcf from year-ago levels and 387 bcf above the 5-year
average (OGJ Online, May 21, 2009).
Raymond James analysts said, “The market is still oversupplied, and the drastic
fall in the rig count was most likely too late to save the market from dismal summer
gas prices. Be it delayed completions, choking back wells, or completely unplugging
the christmas tree, we still believe there will have to be substantial shut-ins this summer.”
The drop in gas price appeared “completely trading driven as the price action
on the physical hubs was fairly subdued, and approximately half of the hubs we
monitor traded up on [May 21] despite the pounding NYMEX natural gas took. The
physical markets are not moving in lock step with the NYMEX ‘trading’ market,” said
Pritchard Capital Partners. “If the physical markets do not follow the NYMEX market
in next few days, the sell-off may just have been a trading event.”
Adam Sieminski, chief energy economist, Deutsche Bank, Washington, DC, said,
“At prices near $4/MMbtu, the EIA calculates a 2 bcfd gain in gas use in the southeast
US. In our view, a gain of this amount is required over the rest of the storage build
season in order to prevent a storage peak rising from 3.7 tcf to 4.1 tcf.”

Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition
July 14 – 16, 2009
Calgary TELUS Convention Centre, Calgary, Alberta, Canada

REGISTER TODAY!

Oil for tomorrow
THE PROMISE. THE PRACTICE.
Technologies developed for the oil sands and heavy oil resources of Alberta are vital to more than tomorrow’s oil supply.
They represent solutions to problems encountered throughout the oil industry.
Problems like managing costs during periods of lower oil prices, dealing with labor shortages, handling sulfur, controlling
air emissions, producing oil under difficult conditions, mitigating surface impacts, recycling produced water, capturing and
sequestering carbon dioxide, and more.
While it finds solutions to these challenges, the oil sands and heavy oil industry continues to develop unconventional
resources that are critical to meeting the world’s long-term needs for reliable hydrocarbon supplies.
Continued progress in oil sands and heavy oil producing technologies means progress in ensuring a dependable supply of
petroleum products at a time when traditional recovery methods are strained by additional demand from rapidly developing
industrial nations.
The Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition is the premier forum for the people who make this
innovation and progress possible.
Don’t miss this opportunity to present your product or service to a powerful, influential audience. Join the Oil & Gas
Journal and our conference attendees in Calgary this summer for the third annual Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies
Conference and Exhibition.

Human Resource’s Strategy for the Future

A

t the outset of the economic downturn, companies responded with a typical
reactionary approach. The corporate landscape for 2009 has been rife with
layoffs, salary freezes and stalled recruitment efforts in an attempt to “stop the bleeding.”
Yet, as the recession deepens, and it has, many corporations will face real concern and
anguish over cutting costs versus retaining talent. There has never been a more pressing
time for HR professionals and leaders to develop a long term workforce strategy for
their organizations. Cost cutting is an unavoidable necessity in the midst of a recession;
however, retaining, recruiting, and strengthening top talent are all requirements to
successfully outlasting a recession.
The leading organizations post recession will
be the ones that are able to look beyond the current

define what their future workforce must look like
before conducting any more layoffs. Companies that
do not first establish a strategy for the future run the
risk of not having the right players on board to see them through the recession or compete
successfully when the economy turns around.
Just keeping the right staff is not enough. Forward thinking businesses understand
that the time to recruit for the future is today. The competition for top talent is still very
much alive and well. This is especially true for corporations within the energy industry. The
combination of Obama’s Energy for America plan, which is expected to create more jobs
within the energy sector, and an aging energy workforce, will result in scarce resources. No
one can say for sure when the economy will emerge from this recession, but waiting to start
recruitment efforts at the tail end means being behind the curve in the competition for talent.
With a limited pool of skilled and educated workers, corporations will have to fi nd
alternatives to building a successful workforce. HR professionals taking the long-term view
foresee the need to invest in training and development now to build a stronger workforce
for tomorrow. The need to organically grow talent combined with the rapidly changing
pace of skills and education required within the energy industry suggest that a heavy
focus on training be undertaken immediately. Developing the skills of the workforce not
only strengthens a company’s competitive edge, but also inspires loyalty, organizational
commitment, and encourages continued learning for the future.
HR professionals have the opportunity to lead corporations forward not by tactically
enforcing operational cost cutting measures, but by developing a long-term workforce strategy.

Sincerely,
Stanna Brazeel,

Attractive Employment Potential in the Wind Power Sector
Among just a few industries today with positive
growth and employment opportunities across
all global markets is the wind power sector. It
has experienced steady growth since 2001-2002
in North America, and for a longer period in
Europe where this business got its start. This
article provides a brief summary of current
and potential employment conditions in this
important and growing area of business.
Positive Support for Wind Power Sector
The positive nature of wind power today was validated
quite recently by record attendance at the WINDPOWER
Conference in Chicago during the first week in May. The
number of exhibitors and attendees were both up more than
50% from the 2008 conference held in Houston. The American
Wind Energy Association (AWEA) sponsors this and other
wind energy-related conferences.
There are several drivers for today’s keen interest in the wind
power space:
• Continuing momentum in wind farm installations,
especially in the U.S.
• Wind turbine manufacturers have smartly managed the
2002-2008 run-up and a 2009 “pause”
• Electric power generated from a renewable sources is
needed and will be mandated
• Political support for this space continues, with staying
power in Europe and the U.S.
• Stimulus and investment factors are becoming more
supportive
• A long-term future underlies the wind space worldwide
In an era of reshaped commerce and business that is evolving
today, the wind power space has much predictability for
the future and consequent support for current and future
employment opportunities.

Wind Power Beginnings
Wind turbines convert kinetic energy from moving wind
resources into rotational energy, which in turn is ultimately
converted to electricity. Wind turbines are not new; their

4

beginnings go back many years. The early designs for
the current, modern wind turbine of today were actually
developed by the U.S. Department of Energy through efforts
at their National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in
Denver, Colorado. However it was European manufacturers
who took those designs, improved them and launched a totally
new renewable energy business.
This sector has grown steadily since 2001-2002. The U.S. wind
power business started with the import of turbines, equipment
and technology from Europe. But there is now steady growth
opportunity in the U.S. for domestic equipment and component
manufacturing, parts and supply, contract construction and
ultimately, attractive employment possibilities.

Employment Opportunities
Wind power employment typically falls into three segments:
wind turbine manufacturing, wind farm construction &
development and electric power delivery.
Wind Turbine Manufacturing — The majority of wind turbine
manufacturing capacity today is sited in Europe. But thanks to
huge wind resources across the mid-section of the U.S. there
has been significant growth in U.S. turbine installations. More
than eight new wind turbine manufacturing plants were opened
in the U.S. in 2008 and another 19 facilities announced. In
total, during the 2007-2008 period there were 70 new facilities
announced, added or expanded in the U.S. with 55 of the total
being manufacturing locations (most were European).
There has been significant support and investment by
European manufacturers in U.S. wind power. A good example
is a recently-opened wind turbine manufacturing facility in
Brighton, Colorado owned by the Danish firm Vestas, the world’s
leading wind turbine manufacturer. Vestas is also planning
a 400-employee factory in Pueblo, Colorado to build towers
that support these wind turbines. It’s estimated that about 50%
of all components for U.S. wind turbine installations are now
manufactured in the U.S. with that share increasing steadily.
What kind of occupations are there in wind power
manufacturing? A recent study that included a 250-employee
wind turbine manufacturing facility identified a surprising 126
occupations, ranging from manager to engineer to machinist,
technician and even janitor.

Wind Farm Construction & Development — Wind farms are
the heart of the business and are installed ideally where there
are high-velocity wind resources (“resources” mean the wind
is predictable and strong, as opposed to being intermittent and
unpredictable). The total U.S. wind resource base includes a
broad sweep of the area in the U.S. from West Texas through
the Dakotas, also encompassing areas of the Rockies.
Developers of wind farms are similar to real estate developers,
in that the economics of a facility must be attractive over
time to warrant the investment, construction and operation
of such a facility — in this case a wind farm. Today’s typical
wind farms may have 100 to 300 wind turbines installed and
could cost from $1.4 million to $3 million per installed turbine
(includes all land and infrastructure). A development team
for such a facility will include meteorologists, real estate/land
procurement personnel, engineers, environmental permitting
staff, financial analysts, wind technicians and highly-qualified
engineers. All this to determine feasibility, secure financing,
plan, engineer and construct the facility.
During the construction phase, there are requirements for
construction and installation personnel, lifting/rigging
equipment & cranes and ultimately, testing and startup
specialists. Constructing today’s wind farm will be a fouryear process from planning to startup. It should be noted
that there is significant site research and detailed collection
of data to validate the site in terms of wind resource, overall
economics, satisfaction of permitting & land use regulations,
funding, land owner negotiations & permission, etc. The front
end of these projects can be critical in terms of wind farm
“capacity” or uptime, which can range from 30% to 40%. A
capacity shortfall from plan of 1% or 2% can be a killer in the
economics of a wind farm.
But it doesn’t stop there. Just as in other productive
installations with equipment running on a constant basis,
there are operations and maintenance (or O&M) requirements
for the facility that will extend throughout the next 20 - 30
years. Truly, wind farm installations are quite similar to
power generation, petroleum processing or other types of
plant installations in the way they are conceived, planned
constructed and operated over their lifetimes, and have a
similar employment requirements and opportunities to those
types of facilities.
Electric Power Delivery — Employment opportunities here
are transitioning into the electric power generation sector

6

which also includes the electric power grid. As wind farm
installations are added across U.S., European and other
geographic areas, there is the dilemma of transporting
electric power from areas with high wind resources (typically
less populated) to high-demand areas (typically with large
populations). Thereby, the existing electric grid system of
today is challenged. Additions must be made, and that will be
a part of the future employment opportunities as the electric
power sector will enhance and extend to the existing grid.
Employment opportunities in this segment of wind power will
most often be categorized as planning, engineering, financial,
construction, line maintenance, etc.

Employment in the Wind Power Sector
According to Renewable Energy World Magazine, the European
wind power sector had direct employment of almost 109,000
by the end of 2008. This is more than twice the sector
employment in 2002 and represents an annual increase of over
12,000 jobs per year. If we add indirect employment of 50%
(to include various supply, legal, accounting, financial services
professionals, etc.) then total indirect plus direct employment
exceeded 160,000.
In the U.S., wind power is now considered a mainstream
option for electric power generation, and just slightly behind
Europe in employment. AWEA estimates 2008 employment
in the wind sector at 85,000 jobs. According to the new U.S.
Administration, initiatives extended to renewable energy (that
include production & tax credits, training, outright grants
and other support) would be sufficient to grow the business
so that by 2030 there could be approximately 500,000 jobs in
the overall renewable space. That is quite a jump for a 21-year
period, but this sector now has momentum supported by
politics, financial realities and more attractive economics.

What’s Ahead
Most important, right now there is life in the current wind
sector employment scene with a broad range of openings
continuing to be advertised. Some examples of help-wanted
advertisements dated 13th May 2009:
• Turbine Manufacturer — Currently seeking qualified staff
for openings in Engineering, Quality Control, Production
Engineering, Field Operations and Technical Training
• Turbine Installer — Looking for Site Project Managers,

In summary, our perspective for the wind power sector
and its related employment opportunities is positive, with
potential for uptrending activity by late 2009 or early 2010. The
commitments of financial stimuli, tax breaks and government
investment in this sector along with now-realistic economics
of wind power will be hugely supportive in both the near term
and in future years. —EW

Although there is a worldwide pause in overall manufacturing
and installation of wind power capacity at this time, it is
largely due to credit and financial markets seizing up and not
necessarily because of the economics that drive this business in
“normal” times.

The good news is that this sector is receiving political support
and financial incentives to grow and employ workers — and
fast. In addition, the turbine manufacturers have managed
this current “pause” for installations quite well, so there is
minimum clogging of the supply channel for wind turbines,
which could otherwise negatively impact manufacturing
activity in 2009 and 2010.

Critical Success Factors for Recruitment Process
Outsourcing (RPO)
As the industry landscape for energy and power
changes, addressing key workforce-related
challenges is a critical issue for organizations
looking to gain the competitive advantage. Take
for example the following statistics:
• According to its March 2009 Report, the
Energy Information Administration (EIA)
predicts that approximately 259 gigawatts
of new generating capacity will be required
between 2007 and 2030. (Significantly
increased capacity)
• The total wind power generating capacity
jumped by 50% in 2008, according to the
American Wind Energy Association (AWEA).
(Increased diversification in power generation)
• Nearly one half of the U.S. power worker
population will be retirement eligible within
the next five to ten years according to Carnegie
Mellon University’s Electricity Industry
Center. (Increase in workforce demand)
• According to a 2006 report from Booz Allen
Hamilton, the number of students studying
petroleum engineering dropped to about 1,700
in 17 U.S. universities as compared to over
11,000 in 34 universities in 1993. (Decrease in
workforce supply)

It’s no wonder then, considering these troubling supply/
demand ratios, that talent acquisition has taken on a newfound
significance as a key organizational competency. Recruitment
Process Outsourcing (RPO) can be a vital tool for talent
acquisition, staffing, and recruiting leaders to succeed in this
challenging environment.
The following best practices and benchmarks discuss how to
leverage RPO to gain a strategic advantage.

8

Planning and Setting Goals
Recruitment Process Outsourcing can refer to the entire
recruiting process or key elements of it. As organizations are
under intense pressure to continuously improve business
execution and refocus on their core competencies, they must
objectively evaluate the components of the recruiting process
and determine what they do best internally, and what should be
outsourced to an expert third party. A thorough due diligence
is required to carefully weigh and compare various product and
service options, contract terms, pricing scenarios, efficiencies
gained, and results achieved with the third party options as
compared to maintaining these interventions in house.
When it comes to goal quantification, many organizations
rely too heavily on metrics related to a technology-enabled
talent acquisition function, including time to fill, cost-of-hire,
and total number of open positions. A common theme with
these measures is that they are all internally focused on the
recruiting function and do not consider post-hire metrics
associated with actual on-the-job performance, and the
specific needs of the business. Therefore, an important part of
the goal setting process is to engage business line leaders and
strategic planners in a discussion about the business impacts
they find most crucial. Coupling the recruitment function
goals with the business unit goals will provide a more holistic
set of objectives for the recruitment outsourcing program.
Three best practices for goal setting to consider are:
Optimize Workforce Planning
To maximize the effectiveness of the client-RPO vendor
relationship, the process needs to begin further upstream so as
to consider not only the short term but the long range recruiting
requirements. With vast infrastructure projects on the horizon,
and the emergence of new power subsectors, coupled with
projected labor shortfalls, some organizations need to plan for
hundreds if not thousands of new hires. This undertaking is
highly complex, takes a significant amount of resources, and
must be tightly choreographed. Therefore, recruiting leaders
must partner with human resources, strategic planning,
business line management, and RPO partners to ensure
process integrity and strengthen the recruitment supply chain.
Only with tight integration and strategic business planning
will workforce planning be optimized. Key components of

this process include: a forecast of future labor requirements
predicated on growth plans, new products and services, and
technology and infrastructure build outs; the development of
competency models to identify the specific talent requirements

global labor market tightens—combined with projected rapid
growth within utilities, oil and gas, and alternative energy
sectors—organizations must become very adept at promoting
their employer brand. Much like product marketing, recruiters
must effectively promote the employer brand, enhance name
recognition, and educate candidates on the organization’s
market position and presence, corporate culture, and
differentiators. Employer branding practices must extend to
all candidate touch points, resonate effectively through the
recruiting channels used by the target audience, be leveraged
across all RPO partners, and be consistently reinforced.

to a portfolio that is only marginally related to the acquired
company’s original core competency. The movement towards
offering integrated talent management suites is based on
the perceived benefits of integrating multiple HR processes,
placing the emphasis on software—as opposed to the
interventions that help acquire top talent.

Retention considerations
With stiff competition for top talent among energy and power
companies, as well as from other industries, retaining this
talent becomes a critical concern. Consider these statistics:
The direct and indirect costs associated with premature
turnover average around $3,500 per employee for non-exempt
positions according to the Society of Human Resource
Management. Research from The Center for Creative
Leadership has shown that 66% of Senior Management hired
from outside a company fail in their first 18 months. And
according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average tenure
for 35-44 year olds is declining.

For organizations focusing on talent acquisition, the buy- side
implications of these trends are clear. With the increased
number of consolidations, there are less ‘brand-name’ options
available. The cast may change, product expertise may be
diluted, and support and migration options may be limited.

The problem with many existing employee selection
approaches is that they rely too heavily on subjective
methods of evaluating talent. In order to best ensure that
top talent is selected into the organization, recruiters must
incorporate an objective means of assessing talent. A
critical RPO product that offers this objective evaluation is
validated talent assessments. Vangent’s research has found
that when utilizing (its) validated assessments, significant
and strategic impact can be achieved (e.g., turnover—33%
drop, tangible theft—23% reduction, Return on Investment
(ROI)—12:1 ratio, workplace accidents—23% decrease, and
accident costs—31% drop in average costs incurred due to
accidents).
When evaluating assessment providers consider the following:
• Are assessments the core competency of the provider?
• Are the assessments documented to be valid and reliable
selection instruments?
• Have the assessments demonstrated meaningful ROI?
• Can the assessments be mapped to existing core
competencies?
• Can the assessments be utilized within an existing applicant
tracking system?
• How does the assessment provider keep current with
regulatory compliance requirements?
• Is the assessment provider a member of a reputable industry
association, and do they adhere to the association’s standards
and guidelines?
Taken together, these ideas can help form a framework for a
Recruitment Process Outsourcing program. While each RPO
situation is unique, RPO products and relationships—like any
other strategic decision—requires careful due diligence. And
as these relationships are strategic, an overarching goal should
be to engage the RPO provider not as simply a vendor, but as a
critical supply chain partner. —EW

Operator and Maintenance (O&M) Development:
The BIGGER Crew Change

O&M Challenge

Significant attention has been given within energy publications
to the impact of the of the “big crew change.” Many articles speak
of the change that was to come; today, we find it to be finally
underway. Within the professional engineering ranks, crew change
demographic numbers are stark and well reported. Corporate and
academic efforts have been launched to address this challenge.
What has not been as well discussed or addressed however is the
significantly larger or Bigger crew change taking place within the
operations and maintenance (O&M) discipline. The purpose of this
article is to communicate the attributes and possible solutions to the
industry’s current O&M crew change challenge.

If one looks within the operations and maintenance side of
the business - where front line workers actually turn valves,
monitor pressures and temperatures, start and stop equipment,
and maintain production within expensive assets - industry
demographics are as bad or worse than those of the technical
professional ranks. Senior plant operators with hard-won,
pivotal, real time problem-solving knowledge are disappearing
as the baby boomer demographic begins to edge into retirement.
They move on to their fishing boat, horse farm, small business,
or to the tuning of equipment on their favorite classic car.
Having been “spoiled” by a twenty-year supply of highly trained,
well qualified senior personnel, the industry and its ability to
“grow” new operators has waned. 21st century O&M feedstock

(aka, “potential new hires”) often lacks
the solid, mechanical, hands-on-based
skill sets seen in their generational
predecessors. Additionally, potential
new hires are often faced with career
paths that require relocation across
the globe. New facilities can be located
near the “harder to find” resources
in remote regions of the Middle East,
Africa, Latin America, the “Stans,”
and Asia, either onshore or offshore.
Nationalization programs by the NOC’s
and contract obligations placed upon
the IOC’s within numerous countries
require that the preferred supply of new
operator technicians stem from the local
populations. Many new employees enter
a process or chemical plant for the first
time, having no related mechanical or
operator skills.

Finally, if one considers the typical
makeup of the workforce in both field
and plant operations worldwide, one
would find a healthy supply of expats in

senior positions. It is on the shoulders
of these operator technicians where
much of the responsibility for critical
operations and stable production relies.
As the generational and cultural handover of knowledge to a
younger, less skilled, crew begins, the risks to asset integrity and
production rises. The oil and gas industry is versed on what can
happen when less than skilled operators are at the panel, and a
process upset cascades into an uncontrolled event. These losses
make a downturn in oil price or the economy collapse appear
warm and cuddly.
Some might say that “new technology” will solve many
people problems, that “smart systems don’t need people to be
as experienced to operate them properly.” Certainly there is
some amount of truth to this point. However, note that while
normal operations will be less demanding, the application of
new technologies has historically meant additional training

requirements for maintenance, troubleshooting, turnaround,
etc. New technology drives a need for different, and normally,
more technically demanding skills.
One recent example of this is that automation on drilling rigs
has actually increased both the skill and number of personnel
required. Operations are much more efficient and effective,
but lowering the skill – or even number – of workers has not
happened. Automation definitely means that fewer people
are required to move pipe, but an even higher level of skilled
technicians is necessary to keep systems working properly. Even

The Business-as-Usual approach would really be more
appropriately named the “Do Nothing” approach. Many
operators - from our experience on the order of 33% - have
yet to realize fully the urgency and importance of the big crew
change. They have no reliable program in place to develop the
next generation of O&M personnel. This approach does have
the advantage of being cheap – and perhaps these organizations
will be able to hire personnel away from others who do
develop personnel. Certainly, this approach is fraught with
organizational and operational risk.

leverage costs and experiences from other Co-Op members
to reduce the costs of building and maintaining CSI-type
development programs.
These cost reductions (compared to the CSI-type efforts)
are not insignificant; for example, if ten organizations work
together as part of a Co-Op, since they share development
costs, savings of up to 90% are possible on common skills.
Any unique skills training will need to be developed by each
organization or asset, but leveraging development for common
skills can bring huge benefits. By freeing up the organization
to focus on unique skills, it is also possible that the time to
solution can be reduced.

The SAIT-TTIT/UTT relationship began in 1998 by
providing a variety of services including the licensing of
technical training modules; a field survey for the design and
specifications of the National Energy Skills Center (NESC);
a training needs assessment; long-term strategic planning to
develop an implementation plan for the NESC training center;
classroom instructor support; and curriculum development.
The year 2003 marked the convocation of the first graduates
(120 individuals) from TTIT. Thousands of students since have
been enrolled into the different programs.

expert sequestering him or herself to sit down and write the
procedure using MS Word and a laptop, the time saved was
order of magnitudes quicker. Operators remained at the plant
“on shift” and were integrated into a process methodology
that rapidly captured their knowledge of procedural steps. The
operators were shielded from the actual writing process, but
were able to provide their deep understanding and insights.
Their skills in verbally describing the complex sequences and
series of steps in varied process conditions provided the base
framework of knowledge from which an accurate transcription
could be completed. Procedure writing time shrank
dramatically because operators were able to concentrate
on those tasks in which they held deep skill sets; namely,
espousing their know-how orally.

Summary
This O&M crew change is well underway. By combining
industry cooperation, advances in technology, and process
consulting, the challenge of creating a globally standardized
approach to rapidly skilling and growing competent operator
technicians will be achieved. Building this organizational
capability is an imperative, given the changes in workforce
demographics that will occur over the next decade. The CoOp approach, wherein an industry competes openly in its
unique areas of specialization and advances but collaborates
on important industry challenges like training, will aide in
answering the Crew Change challenge. —EW

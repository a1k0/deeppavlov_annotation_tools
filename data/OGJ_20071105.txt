LO-Gard® Service:
Advanced Fluid Leakoff
Control Helps Improve
Productivity of Horizontal
Openhole Completions

Before

The Challenge:
Repsol-YPF Ecuador had performed three bare screen
completions in which fluid losses prevented maintaining
full circulation returns while displacing horizontal openhole pay sections to filtered completion brine. These
wells produced with pressure drawdowns ranging from
300 psi to 400 psi and productivity indices ranging
from 10 BOEPD to 13 BOEPD per psi drawdown. The
best of these wells produced at a rate of 4,500 bbl of
fluid per day, significantly below Repsol-YPF’s targets.

After

▼

The Solution:
On the fourth bare screen completion planned for
Before LO-Gard® service was applied (top), excessive fluid leak-off
a 1,000-foot horizontal lateral, Repsol-YPF included
resulted in poor cleanout. Filter cake residue and cuttings greatly
inhibited production. After LO-Gard service was applied (bottom),
LO-Gard® service as a contingency measure. After a
cleanout results were excellent.
conventional procedure failed to adequately control
fluid leak-off, a one openhole volume of LO-Gard service fluid was pumped. Fluid losses decreased to only 2 bbl/hr, allowing
the hole to be circulated with filtered brine to a high degree
of cleanup.

▼

The Results:
Stable production rate of the fourth well tested at 7,000 bbl
fluid per day with a productivity index of 80 BOEPD per psi
drawdown. In addition to improved production, the ability to
produce at higher rates at lower drawdown allows the reserves
to be produced with less tendency to cone water from this
water-prone field.
Following treatment with LO-Gard service, productivity
index of the fourth well was over six times the PI of the best
of the first three comparable wells.

For more information about how LO-Gard service can help improve production from your openhole horizontal
completions, visit www.halliburton.com/Reliability or e-mail sandcontrol@halliburton.com.

General

Interest

Senate members question further SPR oil purchases
Noting that crude oil prices have reached the $90/bbl range,
seven US Senate Democrats asked Energy Secretary Samuel W. Bodman on Oct. 18 to suspend further purchases for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
The US Department of Energy deposited 2.6 million bbl in the
SPR during September and plans to buy another 6 million bbl in
the next few months, said Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman (NM) and six other Senate Democrats.
“This action sends a message to the marketplace that the administration is comfortable with current price levels, and can only add
to US crude oil prices and the prices of related commodities,” they
said in a letter to Bodman.
The seven Senate Democrats also criticized DOE’s issuing a solicitation Oct. 10 for 13 million bbl of crude from federal leases in
the Gulf of Mexico under the royalty-in-kind program (OGJ Oct.
22, 2007, Newsletter). DOE said the action was in accordance with
the 2005 Energy Policy Act, which directs that the SPR be filled to
its authorized 1 billion bbl capacity. It added that there are no immediate plans to replace 11 million bbl of SPR crude which were
sold in response to Hurricane Katrina.
DOE’s policy of continuing to fill the reserve is bad for taxpayers
as well as consumers, the lawmakers said. “Based on the department’s own forecasting of crude oil prices and on current futures
prices, a deferral of SPR deliveries for 12 months would allow the
department to acquire the oil at a discount of more than $10/bbl
compared to today’s prices,” they said.
In addition to Bingaman, Sens. Byron L. Dorgan (ND), John F.
Kerry (Mass.), Carl M. Levin (Mich.), Claire McCaskill (Mo.), Jack
Reed (RI), and Ron Wyden (Ore.) signed the letter.

NEB: Canadian oil, gas stocks adequate’ for winter
Supplies of heating oil and natural gas will be adequate for this
winter, Canada’s National Energy Board reported.
Even with a winter that is colder-than-usual, high storage levels
of gas will be more than adequate to meet heating demand, NEB
said in its winter outlook for Canada’s energy markets.
The price for heating oil should track similarly to the price of
crude, which will likely remain in the $75-80/bbl range throughout the winter, NEB said. Also, tightening supply inventories will
continue to raise prices, it said.
North American gas futures prices are expected to hold steady
between $6-8/MMbtu, NEB expects. Stronger gas production in
the US as well as imported LNG will offset any decline in production from Canada.
In mid-October, oil prices crested to new record-highs, NEB

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

said, driven by a combination of market speculation, Middle East
political tensions, the low US dollar, and persistent refinery bottlenecks. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
agreed in September to raise its supply output by 500,000 b/d,
starting in November. NEB said this supply increase should help to
moderate recent high oil prices.
It added that despite high crude prices, Canadian consumers
are not likely to see high prices at gasoline pumps until spring, as
the high driving season, Apr. 1 to Labor Day, increases demand for
gas.

MMS sells more than 91 bcf of RIK gas
The US Minerals Management Service sold more than 91 bcf of
natural gas it received from Gulf of Mexico offshore producers as
royalties in kind to nine high bidders, the Department of Interior
agency said Oct. 23.
The gas will be delivered in 13 sales packages over 5-12 months
beginning Nov. 1 to 13 offshore pipeline systems originating in
the gulf, MMS said. Bear Energy LP, BG Energy Merchants, ConocoPhillips Inc., Louis Dreyfus Energy Services, National Energy and
Trade LP, PPM Energy Inc., Sequent Energy Management LP, United
Energy Trading LLC, and Williams Trading Co. submitted the winning bids.
Bidding was strong for the sale as 21 companies tendered 175
offers for the gas, MMS Director Randall Luthi said. Revenues would
total $641 million at current prices, although actual revenues will
vary based on prices over the life of the contracts, he added.
The gas in the sale was taken as royalties in kind instead of cash
payments from federal Gulf of Mexico leases. MMS then sells such
gas competitively on the open market. It has said that the program
is more efficient, reduces regulatory and reporting costs, provides
early certainty to royalty values, and ensures a fair return on public
royalty assets.
House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Nick J. Rahall
(D-W.Va.) has criticized the program and attempted to impose
limits on its use in legislation which the committee passed last
spring.
Luthi said MMS will continue to use royalty-in-kind sales in
tandem with royalty-in-value, or cash, payments depending on the
particular business case to ensure a fair return on public royalty
assets.

China’s oil production, imports rise during 2007
This year China has imported 18.1% more oil during JanuaryAugust than it did in the comparable period last year, according
to figures published by the country’s General Administration of
Customs (GAC).
GAC said China’s total oil imports were 110.4 million tonnes in

The well was the first test of the AEB reservoirs in the Jade structure along the Matruh Ridge, confirming AEB resource potential
identified in the Jade-1x discovery in March. The Jade-1x discovery
well logged 217 ft of AEB pay and 66 ft net pay in the Jurassic Upper Safa formation. The discovery was completed as a gas producer
from the Upper Safa after a test of 25.6 MMcfd of gas (OGJ, Apr. 9,
2007, Newsletter).
The Jade-2x well, which is 1 mile northeast of Jade-1x, logged
148 ft of AEB pay.
Also at Jade field, the Jade-4 well has reached 12,670 ft TD and
logged 234 ft of net pay in the AEB formation. The Jade-4, a twin

The US government has raised the royalty rate on new offshore
leases for the second time this year.
In proposals for Outer Continental Lease Sales 206, covering
the Central Gulf of Mexico, and 224, covering the Eastern Gulf, the
Minerals Management Service stipulates a royalty rate of 18.75%.
The standard royalty has been 16.7%. The sales are scheduled Mar.
19, 2008.
Last January, MMS raised the royalty on new deepwater leases to
16.7% from 12.5% (OGJ, Jan. 15, 2007, p. 37).
MMS proposes to offer 5,000 blocks covering more than 28.5
million acres in the Central Gulf. Water depths of some blocks exceed 11,200 ft. Sale 206 covers the same area that Central Gulf Sale
205 did Oct. 3.
Sale 205 drew apparent high bids totaling more than $2.9 billion—the second highest total in US leasing history—for 723 tracts
(OGJ, Oct. 15, 2007, Newsletter).
In Sale 224, MMS proposes to offer 118 whole or partial unleased blocks covering 547,230 acres in the Eastern Gulf. Water
depths are 2,675-10,213 ft.
It would be the first offering of these Eastern Gulf blocks since

ExxonMobil starts up Angola’s Marimba North ﬁeld
Esso Exploration Angola (Block 15) Ltd. has begun production
from the Marimba North project in 3,900 ft of water 90 miles off
Angola.
The Marimba North project, designed to develop 80 million bbl
of oil, is a tie-back to the Kizomba A development and has come
on stream ahead of schedule and within budget, and without any
production impact to the Kizomba A operations.
The project includes subsea wells, a single drill center, 30 km
of flowlines, and a unique riser system which ties the production
flowline into the existing Kizomba A tension-leg platform. The Marimba North production and control facilities have been integrated
with the existing Kizomba A development to effectively and cost
efficiently use the existing field facilities.
Marimba North, one of seven major start-ups for ExxonMobil
this year, will add about 40,000 b/d of peak production capacity
to the existing Block 15 production, which includes the Xikomba,
Kizomba A, and Kizomba B developments. With the addition of

SPD raises oil output in Siberia’s Salym ﬁeld
Salym Petroleum Development NV (SPD), a joint venture of
Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Sibir Energy PLC, reported a recordhigh oil production rate at Salym field in the Khati-Mansi autonomous region of western Siberia.
Salym said the rate of production at Salym fields, which include
West Salym, Upper Salym, and Vadelyp, exceeded 100,000 b/d one
month ahead of schedule. An SPD spokesman said the production
increase was due primarily to exploration of West Salym field.

SPD CEO Harry Brekelmans said SPD, which had doubled production in 16 months to 100,000 b/d from 50,000 b/d, has produced more than 22 million bbl of crude this year.
In 2004, SPD began oil production from wells in West Salym,
the largest of the Salym group of oil fields in the region (OGJ Online, Dec. 23, 2004).

BPZ gets tankers, fast tracks Corvina production
BPZ Energy has signed two short-term contracts with the Peruvian Navy for two 6,000-bbl tankers to transport oil earlier than
scheduled from Corvina oil and gas field on Block Z1 off northwestern Peru.
The field is expected to begin production of about 2,500 b/d
of oil in early November. Last month it tested 8,300 b/d of oil and
184 MMcfd of gas, mostly from the Lower Miocene Upper Zorritos formation (OGJ Online, Oct. 10, 2007).
BPZ plans to ramp up production from 2,500 bo/d to 4,000
bo/d using two barges when they become available at yearend or
early next year.
BPZ previously announced that two barges, the Nomoku and
the Nu’uanu, each with a capacity of about 40,000 bbl, had been
leased and would be used as floating production, storage, and
offloading facility and transport barges in the company’s oil production operations. These barges are currently being outfitted with
equipment in the port of Paita, but have encountered some delays
due to scheduling.

CCRL plans to expand Saskatchewan reﬁnery
Consumers’ Cooperative Refineries Ltd. (CCRL) has retained
International Alliance Group (IAG) as program manager for the
grassroots portion of a proposed expansion of its 100,000 b/cd
refinery in Regina, Sask.
The project would increase output of Saskatchewan’s only oil
refinery by 30%. It involves building a fluid catalytic cracking complex to support the additional crude oil processing.
IAG is expected to make a final decision in early 2008 to move
forward with detailed design and construction of the project,
which, if implemented, would increase capacity of the refinery to
130,000 b/cd.
Meanwhile, Mustang Engineering, a subsidiary of John Wood
Group PLC, is providing front-end engineering design services to
IAG for the CCRL refinery expansion.

Galp to expand Porto reﬁnery in Portugal
Galp Energia SA has let a contract to Fluor Corp. for front-end
engineering and design and early procurement services of main
equipment for a conversion project at its 91,000 b/cd refinery in
Porto, Portugal. The contract’s value was not disclosed.
The conversion project will add a grassroots vacuum flash and
distillation unit, a visbreaker, a diesel hydrodesulfurization unit,
and associated utilities and infrastructure. The project is part of
Galp’s investment program to increase production of diesel by

The Nomoku will be used as an FPSO, moored at the CX11
platform, while the Nu’uanu will be used to transport oil between
offshore Corvina field and Petroperu SA’s 62,000 b/cd Talara refinery, 70 miles south of the BPZ’s operations.

PDVSA charters Neptune Discoverer drillship
Venezuela state firm Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) signed
a 4-year contract with Neptune Marine, Nicosia, to charter the
Neptune Discoverer drillship.
The vessel will drill natural gas wells as part of the development
of the Mariscal Sucre gas project under a contract lasting 1,460
days and valued at some $700 million.
Neptune Marine also will participate in a social welfare program together with PDVSA in Venezuela for a total of 8% of the day
rate in the contract.
The drillship will deploy to Venezuela upon completion of its
drilling commitment for Con Son in Vietnam, estimated at the end
of November. The drillship is expected to reach Venezuelan waters
toward the end of February 2008.
In September Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said he wanted
his country—which became a gas importer this month with the
opening of a pipeline from Columbia—to increase gas production
by 3 bcfd to 11 bcfd by 2011.
At the time, Chavez said his government is “launching the socialist gas revolution,” claiming that Venezuela possesses “80% of
South America’s gas reserves” and “30% of the gas reserves in the
Americas (OGJ Online, Sept. 19, 2007).” ✦

The revamp also will enable Galp to process heavier crudes.
Fluor offices in Madrid and in Camberley, UK, will carry out
the refinery conversion work along with local Portuguese companies.
Fluor previously constructed an HDS unit for Galp’s 213,000
b/cd refinery at Sines in 2002.

Pertamina seeks oil supplies for planned reﬁnery
Indonesia’s state-owned PT Pertamina is seeking crude supplies from oil-producing countries to feed its refinery project in
Bojonegara, Banten, after Iran reduced its supply commitment to
100,000 b/d from 300,000 b/d.
“The commitment with Iran is a fragile one, so we are looking
for other sources to supply the crude,” said Pertamina’s director of
refining Suroso Atmomartoyo. “We have to ensure we get the supplies before the refinery is completed.”
Atmomartoyo said Pertamina is in talks with several countries
for the crude supply, but he would not identify them, saying negotiations were still at the early stages.
Pertamina and Iran had signed a memorandum of understanding in March 2005 to jointly build the 300,000 b/d Banten refinery with the understanding that Iran would invest in the $5.6
billion refinery and supply the heavy crude.
In July, they agreed to build the refinery and said construction
would start in 2008, with completion scheduled for 2012. Of-

ficials from the two countries planned an August meeting in Tehran to discuss project details, including equity distribution, project
structure, and crude supply agreements.
However, in September Iran expressed disappointment with Indonesia’s handling of the plan to build the refinery jointly, including the substitution of Pertamina for its 51.38%-owned subsidiary
PT Elnusa to be partner with Iran’s National Iranian Oil Refining &

Distribution Co. in the project.
“The heads of state of the two countries made a commitment
to support the development of the project, but after 3 years there is
no progress toward its implementation,” said Mahmoud R. Radboy,
head of the economic section at the Iranian embassy in Jakarta.
At the same time, Pertamina Pres. Ari Hernanto Soemarno said
implementation of the project would be postponed because of rising costs. ✦

Enbridge plans North Dakota pipeline expansion
Enbridge Energy Partners LP, Houston, said it will proceed with
yet another expansion of the Enbridge North Dakota Pipeline System.
Costing an estimated $150 million, the expansion will add
40,000 b/d of capacity from the western end of the system to
Minot, ND, and 51,000 b/d of capacity from there to Clearbrook,
Minn.
It will increase total system capacity to 161,000 b/d from
110,000 b/d, with an in-service date of late 2009.
Enbridge said it will file with the US Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission a cost-of-service-based expansion surcharge that will
be added to existing tariff rates to fund the proposed expansion.
No long-term volume commitments will be required for existing
or new capacity.
This expansion is in addition to the existing 30,000 b/d expansion project that is under way and slated for completion by
yearend.
The North Dakota Pipeline system gathers oil from production
areas in western North Dakota and eastern Montana and transports
it to Clearbrook, where the system interconnects with the Minnesota Pipeline and the Partnership’s Lakehead System. From Lakehead, shippers can access most of the major refinery markets along
the Great Lakes and in the Midwest.

Tangguh LNG partners ponder additional trains
BP PLC subsidiary BP Berau Ltd., operator of the Tangguh LNG
project, is considering construction of as many as eight additional
LNG trains at the company’s existing site in Papua.
The company has set up a special team to study the possibility
of new trains at the existing plant. Two other LNG trains are nearing completion.
“We are concentrating on getting these [two trains] finished.
We are also looking at further development and opportunities for
building more trains,” said David Clarkson, the project’s executive
vice-president.
BP began construction of the two trains in March 2005, with
the first due to go online in January 2009 and the second in May
2009. The project is said to be 82% complete as of September.
Tangguh will sell LNG to four overseas buyers—China’s Fujian
(2.6 million tonnes/year), South Korean K-Power and Posco (1.11
million tpy each), and Sempra Energy (3.6 million tpy).
Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro
said he would like BP to sell LNG from the trains under consideration as several domestic firms, including state-owned Perusahaan
Listrik Negara and Perusahaan Gas Negara, have shown interest in
buying gas from Tangguh.

Hammerfest LNG exports ﬁrst cargo
The LNG carrier Arctic Princess and its cargo of 145,000 cu m
of LNG has left the Norwegian Hammerfest liquefaction plant and
is on its way to southern Europe. The launch marks Europe’s first
LNG export.
The gas came from Snohvit field in the Norwegian Barents Sea,
with the first gas volumes produced in August and first LNG, in
September. “The LNG production from Snohvit is still undergoing
a run-in phase,” said project partner RWE Dea AG. Stable production is expected to begin by yearend.
Carbon dioxide, accounting for 5% of the Snohvit well stream,
is separated and injected into a different underground formation.
The project has cost a total of €6.5 billion. At full production, carriers will leave port at Melkoya every 5-6 days. Each ship will transport nearly 150,000 cu m of gas as LNG to customers worldwide.
Snohvit has been developed by a consortium consisting of op-

Fos Cavaou LNG terminal in France delayed
Societe du Terminal Methanier de Fos Cavaou (STMFC) has informed France’s Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE) of a major
delay in work being carried out to bring its Fos Cavaou LNG terminal in southeastern France on stream in April 2008. STMFC will
operate the terminal on behalf of owners, Gaz de France 69.7%
and Total SA 30.3% (OGJ, June 11, 2007, Newsletter).
CRE, in turn, announced it would postpone new tariff propositions for LNG terminal users, which originally had been scheduled
for the end of October.
As matters now stand, CRE is unable to propose new tariffs because the current ones for the existing Fos Tonkin and Montoirde-Bretagne terminals had been designed to apply only until Fos
Cavaou came on stream.
Gaz de France told OGJ that, at this stage, it is unable to indicate
when Fos Cavaou will become operational. ✦

Ethanol no palliative
The editorial, “Biofuels meet doubt,”
(O&GJ September 24, 2007) tells us that
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Round Table
on Sustainable Development views the
rush to biofuels as environmentally and
economically unsustainable (OGJ, Sept.
24, 2007, p. 17). This becomes increasingly clear as the domestic production of
ethanol rises, and there is a corresponding increase in the price of corn-based
products. The diversion of foodstuffs
into automotive fuels is, in effect, a
regressive tax and a simple misallocation
of national agricultural resources.
Moreover, government should stop
subsidizing the production of ethanol.
Energy prices have increased to the point
where the 51¢/gal subsidy, which may
have appeared justified at one time, is no
longer tenable. Subsidies should never be
viewed as largess in perpetuity, and Congress should discontinue its unwarranted
subsidy of ethanol production. Can you
imagine the public furor that would
arise if government were to extend the
same $21.42/bbl subsidy to domestic
oil producers? Would that the oil industry had the same clout in Washington
that agricultural lobbyists have!
In August 2005, Congress passed legislation calling for ethanol production to
be increased by 2012 to 7.5 billion gal/
year, up from 4 billion gal/year at that
time. With increasing gasoline prices and
governmental incentives, it appears that
this objective will be attained well before
2012. This level of ethanol production
will cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion/year
in subsidies, and the cost of corn-based
food products will rise accordingly. It is
generally agreed among those who have
studied the issue that ethanol will not
make economic or environmental sense
until it is possible to produce it from
cellulose and not corn.
Proponents of increasing ethanol
production speak glowingly of moving
toward energy independence. This is unrealistic when it is recognized that even
at the 7.5-billion gal/year production

level, ethanol will amount to less than
4% of current US petroleum imports.
More to the point, this does not factor in
the energy required to produce a gallon
of ethanol, which is nearly equal to (if
not more than) the energy that can be
derived from that gallon of ethanol.
Increasing ethanol production is
no palliative to the developing energy
crisis; rather, it is a growing burden on
the nation’s economy. It would be far
wiser to accelerate the application of
higher corporate average fuel efficiency
standards and increase vehicular mileage, thereby making a meaningful start
in reducing our reliance on petroleum
imports.

even organizational culture can hinder

of modern technologies. “Companies
need to be alert to the dangers that free

technology at KPMG.
Energy companies are cautiously
monitoring how online media are
evolving and how they can best use
them to communicate with wider audiences. But their confidence needs to
increase quickly as public debates intensify about climate change, high energy
prices, and energy efficiency. Using new
media to create and maintain existing

Energy bills in context
The worst US energy legislation in years should
be viewed in context. The House and Senate have
passed destructive energy bills while losing control of federal spending and threatening to raise
taxes. Although the energy bills certainly slap the
oil and gas business, the broader context makes
clear that Congress has no intention of confining
pain to a single, unpopular industry.
If enacted along with many of the spending
and taxation measures under consideration, costly
energy law would be just one blow in an official
pummeling of the US economy. Individually, some
proposals can seem affordable. Taken together,
they promise a system of twisted incentives and
punishing costs. And they emerge from a dreadful
ascendance of goodie-bag politics abetted by a tax
system needing reform.

Spending spree
According to the politically conservative
Heritage Foundation, the 110th Congress has
passed legislation in its first 10 months that would
increase federal spending by $454 billion and
taxes and fees by $98 billion over 10 years. Even
larger tax hikes are in prospect. In an Oct. 30
report, Brian M. Riedl, a fellow of the foundation’s
Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy, says
the congressional budget resolution would bring
the projected tax increase to $2.7 trillion.
Lawmakers, of course, always try to camouflage
their gropes for the money, which is partly why
the oil and gas business finds itself under attack.
House legislation would raise taxes on oil and
gas production and spend proceeds on politically
favored, uncompetitive energy forms. For consumers, replacing oil and gas with costlier alternatives
is expensive. In fact, a governmentally induced
jump in energy costs sounds more like a tax hike
than the market-driven increases in oil and gas
prices popularly fitted to the analogy.
Now lawmakers want to hike individual income tax rates. With energy, they coat mistakes
with false virtues like energy independence. With
taxes, they’re disguising mischief with a semblance of reform.
Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-NY), chairman of
the House Ways and Means Committee, on Oct.

24 proposed a bill that he said would cut tax rates
for 90 million working families but that Republicans on his committee called the largest individual
income tax hike in history. The legislation would
repeal the alternative minimum tax (AMT), which
was designed to keep the wealthiest Americans
from escaping income taxation but has come to
threaten millions of middle-class taxpayers. Repeal
is in order. But Rangel’s measure would offset the
revenue effects with, among other things, a 4%
surcharge on upper-bracket taxpayers. Republicans
say it would raise marginal tax rates—the key to
economic effects—to 44% from 35%, well above
the average of industrial countries.
Rep. Jim McCrery, the ranking Republican
member of the committee, called Rangel’s claim
about tax cuts “hokum” because of changes beyond
AMT repeal. And he said insisting that AMT relief
be offset by tax increases elsewhere would “lock
Congress into a system where we are guaranteed to
raise taxes by $3.5 trillion over 10 years.”
The threat of a huge, direct tax hike thus joins
energy costs set to be lifted by government mistakes. The economy hasn’t been in this much peril
since before the presidency of Ronald Reagan.

What’s needed
Neither energy nor tax policy should be this
complicated—or this dangerous.
In tax policy, Congress should first repeal the
AMT. That’s all: Repeal an economic mouse that
became a monster without compensating for
supposedly lost revenue Congress never intended
to collect. Then it should reform the tax code to
lower marginal rates and eliminate complexity.
Lower rates would help the economy. Simplification would deactivate a potent tool of political
misbehavior. Energy goals should be even simpler:
maximum domestic production of commercial
energy in a market free of political influence.
On too many fronts, Congress is yielding to
political impulses at the expense of real virtues like
fiscal responsibility, honest taxation, and economic
energy. Its actions threaten long-term prosperity.
Both political parties deserve blame. The one that
reverses course deserves to win control of Congress and the White House a year from now. ✦

The US government and oil industry must jointly take aggressive action
to slow the growth in oil demand and
to increase oil supply with help from
unconventional sources, reported the
Federal Task Force on Strategic Unconventional Fuels in September.
The higher cost and volume of US
crude and product imports, the task
force charged, have exacerbated the
nation’s
trade deficit,
weakened the
dollar against
other currencies, and
put national
security and
economic stability at risk.
At the same time, international
competition for oil supply is intensifying, and “increasingly unstable sources
pose strategic risks that the nation can
ill afford to ignore,” it said. Global
oil demand is expected to increase to
more than 110 million b/d by 2025
from 84 million b/d in 2005. US
accounts for one fourth of that total
(Table 1). During 1985-2004, US
demand for oil increased by 25% to 20
million b/d, and imports more than
doubled to over 12 million b/d. The
Energy Information Administration
(EIA) projects that US oil and products
imports will increase to 18 million

b/d (65% of demand) by 2030.
In response, the task force—established by the Secretary of Energy under
Section 369 of the Energy Policy Act of
2005 (EPACT)—completed in February an integrated strategy to accelerate
commercial development of unconventional fuels such as oil shale, tar sands,
heavy oil, and liquids-from-coal and
to implement methods of enhancing
US oil recovery (OGJ Online, Aug. 20,
2007).
The task force evaluated the global
and US oil supply outlook and assessed domestic unconventional fuels
resources that could augment supply
(Fig. 1).
It then described a plan for developing an unconventional-fuels industry that it said could supply all of the
Department of Defense’s domestic fuels
demand by 2016 and add as much as
7 million boe/d of liquid fuels to US
markets by 2035 (Fig. 2).

have 19 billion bbl of tar sands resources (Fig 3).
New extraction technology approaches may be required for US tar
sands, which differ in quality and
grade from tar sands in Canada, where
established methodologies have been
in place for 35 years and where technology has greatly improved. Canadian
production is about 1 million b/d,
including both mining-based and thermal production (OGJ, Aug. 9, 2003, p.
16).
US tar sands are oil-wet and consolidated, with variable and unpredictable

grades, and achieving production goals
will require activity in technological,
fiscal, and institutional areas, said the
task force.
The viscosity of the bitumen, which
distinguishes tar sands from extra heavy
oil, may require some tar sands deposits
to be mined.
A constraining factor, then, is the
location of Utah tar sands on state and
federally owned lands, some of which
overlie oil and gas deposits and others
that are in or adjacent to national or
state parks, wilderness areas, or pristine
environments where mining would be
precluded or constrained.

private industry development of a coalto-liquids (CTL) industry. The governments would set an oil floor price
to minimize the risk of a prolonged
oil price collapse; provide economic
incentives such as tax credits, and loan
and purchase guarantees to accelerate
development; and participate in early
design feasibility studies, engineering
design, and permitting for first-of-kind
projects.
Large quantities of coal would have
to be mined and transported. Congress
would be urged to fund the needed
transportation system expansion.
Coal can be converted into liquid fuels via direct liquefaction or by indirect
liquefaction after gasification. Already,
14 proposals for commercial CTL projects have been announced in the US,
although none has been built.
Although Sasol Ltd. has four pilot
plants in South Africa that have successfully been using coal liquefaction technology since the 1950s, no commercial
plant has been built that combines and
integrates advanced coal gasification
with advanced Fischer-Tropsch synthesis technologies. A 50,000 b/d plant
is estimated to cost $3.5-4.5 billion to
build. A strategic CTL industry might
26

produce 2.6 million b/d of liquid fuels
from coal by 2035.
A National Coal Council survey
has shown that the mining industry
and US transportation facilities can be
expanded to accommodate growth in
coal production by more than 2.3 billion tons/year by 2025. However, the
US lacks facilities to build CTL plant
components.

Heavy oil
The goal for a heavy oil research and
development program is to stimulate
private industry development of heavy
oil resources—much of it in California, Alaska, and Wyoming—to increase
domestic production to as much as
1 million b/d by 2025 (Fig. 5). The
cumulative contribution to GDP would
total $108 billion through 2030.
Considerable expansion of production technologies will be required. Use
of steam injection, in situ combustion,
cyclic steam injection, and more-advanced technologies involving horizontal wells, nonthermal recovery technologies, immiscible CO2, and advanced
thermal EOR could increase recovery of
heavy oil, the task force said, particularly from Alaska’s North Slope, which

Producing “stranded oil” from
maturing fields with CO2 for EOR
could add more than 2 million b/d of
production by 2035, according to task
force projections. It would be accomplished with a basin-oriented approach
toward 10 basin studies conducted by
the DOE Office of Oil and Natural Gas.
A major element would be to expand
the supply of CO2, mostly from industrial sources, in a two-pronged benefit
that would also reduce the amount of
CO2 released to the atmosphere. An improved, cost-effective technology would
be developed to capture and supply
“EOR-ready” CO2.

Demand reduction
No single fuel source, however,
is likely to substantially reduce the
country’s dependence on imported oil,
the task force said. Despite adding the
incremental supply from unconventional fuels development, the volume of net
imports in 2035 would be only slightly
reduced because of increases in demand (Fig. 2). Consequently, reducing
demand must also be part of a strategy
for lowering US oil imports.
The most likely place for efficiency
gains relative to liquid fuels is in individual transportation. Increased vehicle
mileage and reduced driving, the task
force said, could lower net miles driven
by 20% in 30 years in a moderate case
and 30% in an accelerated case.

Gas industry, Senate members voice energy bill concerns
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The American Petroleum Institute,
Independent Petroleum Association of
America, and seven other trade associations representing natural gas producers, pipelines and consumers jointly
expressed strong concern Oct. 19 about
US House energy legislation that they
believe would reduce instead of increase domestic gas supplies.
In a letter to House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi (D-Calif.) and US Senate Majority
Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), the organizations said that HR 3221 “professes to focus on energy independence, yet
if enacted would adversely affect natural
gas production and infrastructure development, thereby making the supply of
this important energy resource even less
secure”
The Natural Gas Supply Association,
Interstate Natural Gas Association of
America, National Ocean Industries
Association, American Exploration and
Production Council, Industrial Energy
Consumers of America, Process Gas
Consumers Group, and US Oil and Gas
Association also signed the letter.
It came as the ranking minority
members of three Senate committees urged Reid and Minority Leader
Mitch McConnell (R-Ken.) to convene
a formal House-Senate conference to
reconcile differences between HR 6,
which the Senate passed June 21, and
HR 3221, which the House approved
Aug. 4 (OGJ, Aug. 20, 2007, p. 84).

Bypassing conference
“Last Wednesday, Speaker Pelosi announced her intention to bypass the
appointment of a conference committee to reconcile the differences between
these two bills,” said Pete V. Domenici
(R-NM) of the Energy and Natural
Resources Committee, James M. Inhofe
(R-Okla.) of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and Ted Stevens
28

(R-Alas.) of the Science and Transportation Committee.
“We regret the speaker’s decision to
do this and we are deeply concerned
about the integrity of long-standing procedures in the Congress if the
speaker’s decision is allowed to stand,”
they added in a letter to the Senate’s
leaders.
A House source told OGJ that Pelosi
on Oct. 11 instructed House committee
chairmen who have jurisdiction in energy matters to initiate less formal talks
with their Senate counterparts after
becoming frustrated with what House
Democrats considered delays by Senate
Republicans in convening a conference.
Pelosi said in an Oct. 12 press conference that the bill, HR 6, which the
Senate passed, dealt only with “repealing subsidies to ‘Big Oil’ and creating
a renewable energy fund” and that HR
3221 includes provisions to increase
energy security and reverse global
warming. “There is nothing I would
like better than to have a conference, to
have a full and open discussion of the
issues that are in the House and Senate
bills and come to resolution in a bipartisan, bicameral way,” she maintained.
She also said she hoped the resulting
bill would be legislation that President
George W. Bush could sign. Alan B.
Hubbard, assistant to the president for
economic policy and director of the
National Economic Council, told her in
an Oct. 15 letter that Bush would veto
any energy bill that reduced instead of
increased domestic production, raised
taxes or used the tax code to single out
specific industries, or imposed price
controls.
That led Rep. Edward J. Markey (DMass.), who chairs the House Select
Committee on Energy Independence
and Global Warming, to observe on
Oct. 16: “The Bush administration just
doesn’t get it. Ever since the Cheney
energy plan set America on a foolish
course to try to drill our way to energy

independence, we have been learning the hard way that no matter much
money you heap on the oil industry,
and no matter how much the oil cartel
drives up prices, and no matter how
many new oil wells get drilled, we are
no closer to energy independence than
when this administration took over.”

Most immediate, reliable
In their letter to Pelosi and Reid, the
nine trade associations called natural
gas “the most immediate, most reliable
option available to reduce power plant
emissions as we await the development and deployment of other clean
energy technologies.” The 2005 Energy
Policy Act contains several provisions to
encourage production in frontier areas,
including ultradeep water, ultradeep
gas, and offshore Alaska, which HR
3221 seeks to repeal, they said.
They listed 20 provisions of Title VII
and three provisions of Title XIII that
they said would adversely affect domestic gas development. The provisions
concern taxes, deepwater royalty relief
and price thresholds, water management, federal audits, drilling permit
application processing, and other issues.
“We are puzzled that so far this
Congress has focused so little on natural gas,” the letter said. “Despite the
numerous hearings on climate change
and on energy policy this year, not
a single natural gas industry witness
has been invited to testify at a hearing, House or Senate, on future natural
gas demand and supply dynamics in a
carbon-constrained environment. Given
that natural gas accounts for 25% of US
energy consumption, this is a stunning
oversight.”
Specifically, it said, Congress has
not examined the impact of increased
ethanol production on gas demand.
“Even more significantly, recent modeling of the McCain-Lieberman climate
change legislation, S 280, sponsored by
the Natural Gas Council, suggests that a

20% increase in natural gas demand by
2030 is quite possible given the need
to meet the emissions reduction targets
that would be mandated by that legisla-

The letter urged the House and Senate “to consider carefully how these
and other policies will affect natural gas

demand so that the nation can develop
adequate supplies and infrastructure

Western nations’ oil and gas

nations are renegotiating agreements
with stricter terms. Production-sharing
agreements with incentives to attract
outside investment in exchange for
assuming certain initial risks are rapidly
becoming history. But the deals are still
better than in the Middle East.
“Russia is phasing out PSAs, and
in Kazakhstan a PSA for Kashagan,
one of its biggest fields, has been
reopened for negotiation,” said Ariel
Cohen, an energy security analyst,
last month at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Some
Western companies may not like
what is happening. But with oil prices
close to $90/bbl, we cannot afford to
ignore any major producing basin.”

and financing, Cohen said. Central
Asian governments are likelier to seek
technology agreements, “but it’s a
shifting landscape.”
He said he hopes those countries’
leaders “don’t put all their geopolitical
eggs in one basket,” although it appears inevitable they’ll be pressured by
their larger neighbors to do just that.
Multinational oil companies and
large service and supply firms still
have marketing, financial, and technical advantages. But Cohen warned
that without coordinated national
policies they’ll continue “to try to
beat each other to the next barrel.

Order’s components
The Oct. 25 consent order with the
CFTC requires BP to pay a $125 million
civil penalty, establish a compliance
program, and install a monitor to oversee its commodities trading activities.
It also requires BP to pay $53 million
into a restitution fund for victims, CFTC
said.
Simultaneously, DOJ’s criminal
division fraud section filed a deferred
prosecution agreement under which BP
will pay a $125 million criminal fine
and $25 million into a consumer fraud
fund, CFTC said.
It explained that the TET propane
market refers to propane deliverable
at the Teppco storage facility at Mont
Belvieu, Tex., or anywhere within the
Teppco pipeline that runs from Mont
Belvieu into Ohio, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. The system is the only one that
transports propane from Mont Belvieu
to the US Northeast.
CFTC investigators found that BP
employees used the company’s financial
resources to buy more than the available
TET propane supply in February 2004.
By the end of the month, they controlled enough of the supply to dictate
prices to other market participants and
obtain a significant trading profit. They
also found that BP employees attempted
to corner the TET propane market in
April 2003 by engaging in similar
conduct.
“Although this case was difficult, our
professional staff used strategic techniques during thousands of hours of investigation to uncover BP’s misconduct.
They effectively rooted out evidence of
the defendant’s intentions. This settlement shows that BP has decided to take
positive steps to rectify the situation
and provide relief to those citizens who
were impacted by BP’s misdeeds,” said

Alberta raises royalty rates but rejects oil sands tax
Alberta will raise royalty rates on
production of oil, gas, and oil sands—
but not by as much as a provincial advisory panel recently recommended.
A key departure from the controversial recommendations in what Premier
Ed Stelmach labeled “the New Royalty
Framework” is elimination of an oil
sands severance tax (OSTT).
According to the government, the
new framework will increase royalty
receipts by $1.4 billion in 2010, 20%
34

above the level projected for current
regime but $500 million less than the
increase estimated for the recommendations of the Royalty Review Panel (OGJ,
Oct. 1, 2007, p. 25).
Those recommendations triggered
a flurry of objections from oil and gas
producers, who warned they would
suppress already slumping gas drilling
and discourage oil sands investment
(OGJ, Oct. 8, 2007, p. 32).

The framework
The new royalty framework takes effect at the start of 2009.
In place of the OSST, it will raise the
royalty rate on oil sands production
both before and after operators recover
initial costs (payout).
At present, the prepayout oil sands
royalty is 1%. The new rate will be 1%
until the crude price reaches $55/bbl and
increase in steps to a maximum of 9%
when the oil price is $120/bbl or more.

Rebels target
Sudan’s oil

I

f you were counting on increased
supplies of Sudanese crude to
reduce the worldwide price of oil,
you may need to think once again,
especially given plans made by rebels
in the country.
To be sure, the Sudanese government has dismissed threats to attack
oil fields made by rebels of the Justice
and Equality Movement, who claim
one assault already, kidnapping two
oil workers in the process.
“The JEM say that they will attack
oil fields but these are dreams that
will not come true,” said Sudan’s
Defense Minister Abdel Rahman
Mohammed Hussein, who did not
confirm or deny rebel claims.
JEM field commander Abdulaziz
al-Nur Ashr Oct. 23 said his forces
had kidnapped two workers in an attack on the Defra oil field, run by the
Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Co.

Talks boycotted
Talks on the Sudanese conflict
were scheduled to start in Libya on
Oct. 27, but JEM and the other main
rebel group, SLA-Unity, boycotted
them.
United Nations Sec. Gen. Ban
Ki-moon announced the talks in
September, hoping to achieve a political settlement before the planned
deployment to Darfur of a 26,000strong joint peacekeeping force of
the African Union and the UN.
Sudanese President Omar Hassan
Ahmed Al-Bashir said his government would initiate a ceasefire at the
start of the Tripoli talks, but that he
expected the rebel and opposition
groups attending the talks to do the
same.
Not surprisingly, the two main
36

rebel groups—JEM and SLA-Unity—
declined to attend the talks, saying
the occasion would be a sham due to
ringers introduced by the government.
“The mediation has fallen in the
trap prepared by the government by
making the negotiations an arena
for every Jack, Tom, and Harry,” said
Mohammed Bahr Hamdeen, a senior
JEM leader.
Even a day ahead of the planned
meeting, peace mediators insisted
they would press on with the negotiations despite the decision by the
two rebel groups to boycott the talks,
saying time was running out for the
war-torn region.

Trump card
The absence of the rebels did not
seem to bother the mediators very
much, certainly not enough to recognize the invalidity of the proceedings.
“Anytime a significant movement
figure is not present,” said Salim
Ahmed Salim, the African Unity representative who is helping mediate the
talks, “it’s not a plus for the negotiations.” Not a plus? Goodness, it would
seem to render them impossible.
One meditator, Jan Eliasson, the
UN’s special envoy to Darfur, even
criticized the rebel groups for not
working to settle the conflict. “I don’t
see this as a failure for the negotiations, but as a failure for those who
have not seized the opportunity to
move toward peace,” said Eliasson.
But the rebels held the trump
card: “Whatever happens in Sirte
without JEM and SLA-Nur does not
represent Darfur’s people,” said JEM’s
Abdulaziz.
More to the point, though, where
will that leave Sudan’s oil? ✦

The postpayout royalty, now 25%,
will begin at that level and increase as
the oil price rises above $55/bbl to a
maximum of 40% at $120/bbl.
The government is in discussing
participation in the new system with
Syncrude and Suncor, whose oil sands
mining projects are subject to royalty
agreements expiring in 2016.
By June 30, 2008, it plans to have
adopted a permanent, generic method
for setting bitumen values for projects
with low third-party sales.
The government rejected a recommended 5% upgrader credit envisioned
as an inducement to build bitumen
upgraders in Alberta, saying it would
consider “other options.”
For conventional oil and gas, the
government will replace multitier
systems with unified, elevated rates that
vary with price and production rates,
eliminating most special programs and
vintages.
Oil royalty rates will rise to a
maximum of 50% at an oil price of
$120/bbl. The current oil maximum
rates are 30% for the old tier and 35%
for the new tier under lower price
thresholds.
The maximum gas royalty will rise
to 50% from the current 35%, and tiers
will be eliminated.
The government retained and will
revamp its deep-gas drilling program
and will apply lower royalty rates over a
wide price ranges for wells with limited
productivity.
It also retained a program that
eliminates royalty on gas that would be
flared without the incentive.

Balanced response
One early response to the framework
was balanced.
“Overall, the impact of the government’s proposals will have a significantly less serious impact on oil sands
economics than the panel’s recommendations, although the industry is likely
to remain concerned about the increase
in prepayback take that the increase in
base royalty implies,” said Derek Butter,
head of corporate analysis for Wood

Mackenzie Ltd., Edinburgh.
The consultancy estimates the new
system will reduce the net present value
of current and planned oil sands projects by $10 billion (US) at a long-term,
inflation-adjusted Brent crude price of
$50/bbl. It estimated the value decline

under the Royalty Review Panel’s recommendations at $26 billion.
“From the point of view of new
project development economics, the
new royalty framework clearly recognizes the high break-even costs that the

industry faces in the current operating
environment,” Butter said.
“We believe that there is a much
reduced chance of the cancellation of
proposed oil sands projects under the
new framework than under the panel’s
proposals.” ✦

High gas prices that render alternate fuels for electricity competitive
could lead to gas demand destruction,
impacting demand security, pointed
out a number of speakers. Rahal said
Sonatrach’s approach to such uncertainties involve maintaining flexibility and
portfolio diversification, capacity invest-

ment in LNG regasification terminals
and export pipelines, and the holding
of downstream positions through dedicated affiliates—a strategy that broadly
echoes what both gas consumers and
suppliers were advocating to counter
fluctuating capacity risks.
Adding to the concerns expressed at
the conference, Stuart Bradford, Shell’s

general manager of LNG commercial
advice, introduced what he called “the

generation capacity. “In the short term,
however, uncertainty about the future
of the carbon market may cause delays
in investment in new generating capacity. This underlines the importance of
an early and successful conclusion to
discussions on Phase III of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme,
which is due to start in 2013,” the
report said.
Energy Minister Malcolm Wicks
said it was crucial that the government
not be complacent about delivering
energy security. Around 14 Gw of new
power-generation capacity is under
consideration, and gas import capacity

has quadrupled over the last few years.
The report’s publication coincides with
news that nearly half of the country’s
nuclear power plants have not been
working because of breakdowns and
maintenance.
Jonathan Stern, director of gas
research, Oxford Institute for Energy
Studies, welcomed the report, stressing that it “covers a broader set of
sectors and looks at security of supply
from more dimensions.” Stern said the
consultative aspect ensured that a broad
range of information was gathered
to evaluate future scenarios in energy
markets.

Renewable sources are expected to
play an important role in meeting the
power shortfall, though by how much
is unclear.
Separately, Wicks indicated on Oct.
23 that the government would scale
down its aspiration to source 20% of
Britain’s energy supply from renewables
by 2020. Leaked documents reported in
the national press said there were great
practical difficulties in implementing
the goal. The target is likely to be up
to 15% instead, and Wicks said it did
not mean that the UK was rejecting the
EU-wide target of 20% by the same
date. ✦

GAO report: CFTC’s regulatory reach should expand
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
US Congress should consider
expanding the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission’s authority over
energy derivatives trading, particularly
in exempt commercial markets, the
General Accounting Office said in an
Oct. 19 report.
The report was released days before
the hearing on the CFTC’s reauthorization, which is scheduled for Oct. 24 by
the US House Agriculture Committee’s
General Farm Commodities and Risk
Management Subcommittee. CFTC Acting Chairman Walt Lukken and GAO
Financial Markets and Community

report’s author, are scheduled to testify.

Its staff is developing recommendations, but it is not clear if they will be
presented at the House subcommittee

documented their actions only when
further action was warranted. This lack
of information makes it difficult to
determine the usefulness and extent of
these activities,” it said.

$305 million of ﬁnes
The report said CFTC has noted that
it coordinates its enforcement actions
with NYMEX as well as with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, US
Department of Justice, and others. The
commission also has taken enforcement
actions in cases of attempted manipulation and other abusive energy derivative-trading practices, which resulted in
$305 million in fines during 2001-05.
“While these cases have been successfully pursued, it is difficult to determine whether they have helped deter
market manipulation or the other abusive practices these pursuits addressed,
because the effectiveness of enforcement activities is not easily measured,”
said GAO. It said the White House
Office of Management and Budget has
concluded that the CFTC’s enforcement
program lacks performance measures
that illustrate whether it is meeting its
overall objective.
The GAO report recommended that
Congress consider whether CFTC has
enough enforcement authority to assure
that energy commodity markets, particularly those that are exempt and provide
adequately for fair trading and accurate
pricing, and it made three recommendations to Lukken and CFTC itself:
It suggested that the commission
examine classifications in the COT
reports to determine if the categories
need to be refined to improve the
relevance, transparency, and accuracy of
public information on trading activities.
It suggested that the CFTC explore
ways to routinely maintain records of
inquiries into alleged improper trading activity to more fully determine the
usefulness of its surveillance, antifraud,
and antimanipulation authorities.
It recommended that the CFTC
more fully demonstrate the effective-

ness of its enforcement activities by
developing additional outcome-related
performance measures that better reflect
progress on meeting the program’s
overall goals.
In an Oct. 5 response, Lukken said
that, of alternatives to regulated energy
and metals trading, exchanges exist

where many swap dealers trade both
with commercial firms hedging price
risk and with speculators taking on
price risk. The overall futures positions
of such traders in regulated markets
do not necessarily correspond to their
OTC commodity transactions, he indicated. ✦

Resource base is here defined as the
original oil in place (OOIP) associated
with proved reserves. Assuming a conservative average overall recovery factor
of 22% for the conventional proved
reserves of crude oil discovered to date
of 2,158 billion bbl would establish a
global resource base of 9.8 trillion bbl
(Table 1).
Regarding the nonconventional
resources, the combined OOIP for the
Canadian and Venezuelan oil sands, the
two largest accumulations of their kind
in the world, has been reliably established at 3 trillion bbl; proved reserves
of 300 billion bbl correspond to a 10%

a fact that many of the known basins
are mature (either stable or declining)
while fewer are growing, immature,
or remain to be explored. There is no
doubt that the incremental sources of
supply will depend on the continued
development of known resources, onshore Middle East and North Africa, unconventional oils, new offshore fields,3
and oil from new difficult basins.
EOR production accounts for only
3% of world oil production, but in the
near term its potential could be significant in extending the current plateau
of world onshore and mature offshore
production.4
The objective of this two-part article
is to estimate global oil resources based
on a heuristic analysis of the recovery efficiency of the existing proved
reserves, with a view to determine how
much these reserves can be expanded
by boosting their recovery factor
through technology proven EOR.

The reserves are sorted by oil gravity
and depth, which are key parameters
used in the screening of oil reservoirs to
establish the most viable EOR techniques. The impact of EOR on future
supplies is also discussed.

EOR’s competitiveness
It is a simple fact that the economics
of finding new oil in most regions of
the world has been much more attractive than squeezing the oil from aging
fields.
Global F&D5 costs were $14.42/bbl
in 2006, up a whopping 29% from the
previous year. Development capex for
high-end deepwater fields6 with builtin pressure maintenance (gas and water
injection) projects run between $4 and
$6/bbl of added reserves, with production costs in the $3-4/bbl range.
For nonconventional oils, development costs for recent projects in the
Canadian and Venezuelan oil sands
range from $4.30 to $6.25/bbl of

added reserves. Production costs are $6
for cold production or $17 with steam
generation.
In contrast, capex for development
of EOR projects is nearly $2 per added
barrel, varying somewhat with field
location, well depth, number of existing
wells that can be converted for injection, source of carbon dioxide, etc.
EOR production costs—those above
conventional operating costs—however,
can be high depending on the cost of
chemicals, of steam generation that uses
natural gas ($10 per added barrel), and
the cost of CO2, roughly $10 per added
barrel in the US. Incentives for CO2 capture/sequestration could further lower
the infrastructure costs associated with
CO2 delivery to the oil field, particularly
those offshore.
The bottom line is that EOR capex is
now very competitive with F&D costs
and also with reserves acquisitions,7
which averaged $12.86/bbl worldwide
in 2006.

Global oil recovery factor
Oil recovery factor is the percentage of the in-place discovered oil that is
technically recoverable.
The primary phase of oil production
from a reservoir depends on its existing
natural energy source which may be
one of several (Table 2).
Solution gas drive is the most widespread natural drive mechanism in the
majority of the world’s reservoirs and
can provide a recovery of up to 20% of
OOIP. This primary process is normally
supplemented early in the life of the
reservoir by secondary recovery or
improved oil recovery (IOR) processes
consisting of stranded gas reinjection
and waterflooding. Roughly one-third
of the world’s reservoirs have natural
water drives.
When secondary recovery processes are implemented from the start
of production—as is now standard
practice with new oil fields—or later on
during the primary phase, the process is
referred to as “pressure maintenance.”
Although recovery rates of up to 70%
are theoretically possible, values above
60% are very rare; they are more in the
range of 45-50%.
Tertiary or EOR methods are applied
at the end of the secondary phase. They
can be thermal, miscible, or chemical
processes that attempt to sweep out as
much as possible of the remaining oil.
The most ubiquitous of these techniques is CO2 flooding for medium and
light oils.
The 30-year history of this technology in the US and other countries
indicates that it is possible to recover an
additional 7-15% after waterflooding.
Lake et al.8 has an excellent review of
the three major EOR processes and their
limits in regard to oil viscosity, permeability, and depth of the reservoirs.
Large scale injection of standard fluids like natural gas and water to supplement the natural energy of the reservoir
was not the norm in the international
arena until the 1960s. Even today, the
large reservoirs are the ones generally
selected.
Moreover, not all IOR/EOR tech46

niques are applicable to all reservoirs
and oil types. As a result considerable
numbers of reservoirs, especially in medium and small fields that account for
50% of world production, have been
left without the application of secondary recovery processes.
As a general rule, a recovery factor of
15-20%, corresponding to the solution
gas drive mechanism, is usually the
first estimate for a new discovery until
other production mechanisms have
been observed in the field. Case in point
is the recent certification of the China
Nanpu9 offshore oil find; PetroChina
had originally assigned a recovery factor
of 40% and subsequently downgraded
it to 20%.
Recovery estimates for heavy oils
(<22.3°) range at 10-15% for primary, 20-25% with secondary, and an
additional 2-6% with EOR, for a total
of 30%. Extraheavy oils (≤10°) are
unique. The very viscous ones may be
unproducible by primary means and are
subjected to steam injection from the
onset as is the case of the Canadian oil
sands. Their recovery factor is 10%. For
Venezuela’s Orinoco, primary recovery
by solution gas drive (referred to as
cold production) is also 10%; an additional 10-15% is estimated with EOR
processes still to be tested.
How can we get an estimate of the
overall recovery factor associated with
the existing world reserves of more
than 40,000 oil fields each with multiple reservoirs? A baseline estimate is

necessary so as to determine how much
room there is for IOR and EOR growth.
Several statistical estimates ranging
from 27% to 35% have been mentioned
in the literature. In a recent study of
11,242 fields, Laherrere obtained a
worldwide average of 27%. Harper
studied 9,000 fields and came up with
a mean of 30%. The US Geological Survey10 estimated a worldwide recovery
factor of 40%.
An overall recovery factor for the US
was reported at 22% in 1979. It had increased to 35% by 1999 and would be
about 39% today if the trend continued.
The overall recovery efficiency for
the North Sea province is 46%, the
highest in the world thanks to sound
IOR management applied throughout
the life of the fields. Examples of top
oil fields include Statfjord field with a
record 66% recovery efficiency without
EOR. Prudhoe Bay is expected to reach
47% due to early gas and water injection, followed later by miscible hydrocarbon gas flooding.
A heuristic approach to estimating
an overall worldwide recovery factor based on proved reserves might be
useful. Proved reserves by definition
encompass everything geologic and engineering that has been applied to every
oil field ever discovered.
Let’s examine two cases, the US and
Saudi Arabia. The US has a resource
base11 of 582 billion bbl, and Saudi
Arabia12 has 700 billion bbl. Decline
curve analysis,13 which is based on
production from proved reserves, establishes URRs of 225 billion bbl and 165
billion bbl for the US and Saudi Arabia,
respectively. The corresponding recovery
factors are 39% and 23%.
It is worth noting that Saudi Arabia’s
recovery efficiency of 23% is at the
level of the US average in 1979. Most
Saudi reservoirs have been produced by
primary and secondary methods; other
IOR technologies are also being applied
to reservoirs that are among the largest
in the world.
Most Saudi pressure maintenance
programs, however, went into effect after substantial volumes of oil had been

produced from the reservoirs. In the
case of supergiant Ghawar field, gas and
water injection began more than 10
years after production start-up (1951).
Experience in the North Sea indicates
that reservoirs with delayed pressure
maintenance programs have recoveries
of up to 10 percentage points less than
their counterparts that start from day
one.
Of the OPEC countries that together
hold almost two thirds of the world’s
reserves, Saudi Arabia’s average recovery
factor of 23% is in the upper echelon.
Venezuela, the OPEC member with the
most experience (since the 1950s) with
both secondary and tertiary recovery
projects, also has an overall recovery
factor of 23%. Consequently, by analogy
the overall recovery factor for the bulk
of the world’s conventional oil reserves
would at best be about 20%.
A simple weighted average among
the major oil provinces gives an average recovery factor of 22%. This is well
within the range of solution gas drive
reservoirs (15-25%) with some added
IOR technology effects, which are the

several oil discoveries in 2004-05.
It plans to either sell the property
or find an experienced oil and gas
company as a joint-venture partner to
develop the hydrocarbons. Drilling to
test the main oil exploration targets will
require holes of about 800 m depth at
an estimated $400,000/well.
Oil properties just west and southwest of Mina el Carmen also produce
oil, and the Golfo San Jorge basin
produces about one third of Argentina’s
annual oil output.
Marifil owns the hydrocarbon rights
under its mining claims but has continued its primary focus on precious and
base metals projects.

Centric Energy Corp., London, has
drilled to 3,170 m en route to the first
objective horizon at 3,250 m at the
South Temryuk-1 exploration well in
the Azov-Kuban basin in southwestern
Russia near the Azov Sea.
The first objective is to be cored, and
a second objective is expected at 3,760
m in December.
On the Protoka license 120 km
northeast, Centric will soon spud the
Protoka-1 exploration well on a faultbound structural closure identified on
seismic.
The objectives in both wells are in
the Miocene Chokrak formation, with
oil expected to have been sourced by
the Miocene-Oligocene Maykop series.

Career highlights
John Malcolm has been managing director of Petroleum Development Oman (PDO)
since November 2002.
Employment
Malcolm in 1975 began his industrial career in the British heavy chemicals industry
with positions in process control systems, project engineering, and operations-maintenance. In 1981, he moved to the Middle East and worked on engineering upgrades for
a major reﬁnery. After a 2-year break from industry to engage in teaching, research, and
consultancy at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, he joined Shell in January 1986.
His ﬁrst position with Shell was in PDO, as the head of instrumentation and process
control. Later, he became the head of central engineering at PDO. After 2 years in Oman,
he was assigned to Shell’s central ofﬁce in the Hague, working on front-end prospect
engineering, operational reviews, and a major standardization drive within Shell EP.
Next, he joined Shell Exploration & Production (UK) Ltd. in Aberdeen where he was a
project manager for several engineering projects before returning to Shell’s Hague ofﬁce
to work on redesign, transition, and management of Shell’s Research and Technology
center. He later held the position of vice-president.
This assignment was followed by an appointment as deputy director for the Far East
and Australasia.
In 1999, Malcolm became general manager of Al Furat Petroleum Co.—a Damascusbased joint venture of Syria Petroleum Co., Shell, and Petro Canada. Later he was also
appointed as the general manager of Syria Shell Petroleum Development.
In late 2002, he returned to Oman as managing director of PDO.
Education
Malcolm has a BSc in electrical and electronic engineering and a PhD in process
control engineering, from Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh.
Afﬁliation
Malcolm is a Fellow of the Institution of Engineering and Technology (FIET).

of fields near Harweel. To bring these
fields on stream, PDO needed about 5
years of study, which included 3 years
of development and production during
Phase 1. Currently under construction is
the $1 billion Phase 2AB of the project
that will start producing the cluster
of eight fields containing 10 intrasalt
carbonate reservoirs.
PDO expects the Harweel cluster
production to reach 60,000 b/d in
2010, with the potential to increase to
100,000 bo/d in the next decade.
Malcolm said that “if we had sweet
reservoirs, we wouldn’t be doing what
we are doing.”
Besides miscible sour-gas injection,
PDO now is pursuing a host of other
enhanced oil recovery projects that involve steam and chemicals for producing more of the company’s estimated
50 billion bbl of oil initially in place,
about 15% of which already has been
recovered.
52

With the long-term in mind, Malcolm said, “We have been working
closely with several parties that have
proven EOR experience, including the
Shell EOR center of excellence now established in Oman. Although EOR may
still be regarded as being in the distant
future by many oil companies in the
region, it is inevitable. Oil fields—even
prolific ones—are eventually going to
need thermal, chemical, or gaseous
means of extracting oil.”

Field evaluations
In 2003, PDO established a study
center for providing a better understanding of the company’s reservoirs.
Malcolm said that the center has completed studies on about 70% of the oil
initially in place in PDO’s 120 fields and
is at a stage where it will start reassessing some field development plans.
The studies look at the future of a
field for at least the next 5-10 years so

Special Report

that PDO can make decisions on proper
technology for improving the field
performance.
Staffed initially with mostly expatriates from Shell, the center’s staff now
is 30-40% Omani. The work is done by
integrated teams of reservoir engineers,
geologists, petrophysicists, well engineers, and petroleum engineers.
“Doing things in country is very
important, from both the country’s and
company’s point of view. Links between
the study center and assets are so much
better than if separated by 1,000s of
miles, allowing knowledge to move
easier between them,” he said.
In the early 1990s, the production
from the company’s existing fields with
existing hardware declined at an average year-on-year rate of 10%, but this
decline rate grew to 17-18% in early
2002, Malcolm said. In the past those
decline rates could be more than offset
by the production of “new” oil from
additional reservoirs and additional
wells, but that is no longer the case.
Still, with the better understanding
of reservoirs, better reservoir monitoring and management methods, and
better operational practices, the decline
rate has been reduced even as the production water has increased, from 2 bbl
of water/1 bbl of oil produced in 1992
to about 7-8 bbl of water/1 bbl of oil
today.
In the next 5 years, PDO’s plans
include expanding or initiating 15
waterflood projects; beginning in 2010,
it will be completing one major field
development project per year for the
rest of that decade.

Contracting strategies
To gain efficiency, PDO has changed
many of its contracting strategies. Malcolm said “Many things done 20 years
ago in the way we contracted were
appropriate for that time. But the last
20 years have seen massive changes and
we have to look around for innovative
contracting philosophy.”
For instance, PDO now contracts
Chinese rigs and seismic crews as well
as Indian hoists and continues to look

What is
reliability worth?
Overcoming
flow-convergence issues
with maximum
near-wellbore
conductivity.

Industry Challenge
• Improve sustained production
• Consistently create fractures in cased and cemented horizontal wellbores
• Optimize frac design
• Overcome flow-convergence issues, especially in near-wellbore region
Halliburton Solution
CobraMax® H fracturing service (with Hydra-JetSM service through coiled
tubing for perforating) uses a proppant pack as the final stage of each
fracture treatment. Major benefits include:
• Performing multiple-interval treatments individually
• Eliminating the need for packers or separate trips in the hole
• Providing diversion for successive treatments up the hole
Operator Benefit
Halliburton’s CobraMax H service achieved maximum conductivity in the
near-wellbore region. With this service, risk was lowered and completion
costs per BOE reduced (up to 50% lower when compared with
conventionally fractured horizontal wells).

all over the world for contractors that
can work in an effective and safe manner, Malcolm said.
PDO also has started to do its own
front-end engineering, to provide
more flexibility in project construction, especially if the market changes,
Malcolm said. One illustration of the
effectiveness of doing work in-house is
the company’s Qarn Alam thermal project, for which the bids last year came
in too high. Because of its in-house
work, PDO could divide the project into
segments that could be managed by
smaller contracting firms, at much less
cost, Malcolm said.
The company also has started
awarding service contracts for operating smaller noncore fields, although
keeping equity ownership in the oil. Its
first contract was signed in 2006 with
MedcoEnergi International, an Indonesian company.
The service contract lets Medco and
its partners accelerate development of a
cluster of 18 small fields in the NimrKarim area of south Oman, so that PDO
can devote more attention to its portfolio of large fields, Malcolm said.
PDO is now going ahead with a
second such service contract covering the Rima satellite cluster, which
produces 2,100 bo/d from nine fields.
The contract also includes another nine
undeveloped fields. PDO estimates that
these fields contain 650 million bbl of
oil in place.
Malcolm said such contracts “pull
in a broad range of people from both
small companies and service companies
with the hope that they will have new
bright ideas.”
PDO also has an active local community contracting program that gives
local contractors a chance to bid on
various projects. Malcolm noted that
one local contractor that began building fences for PDO many years has now
grown into an international company
that recently had an initial public offering of its stock. ✦

What sour oil and biting chemicals do to destroy
any piece of subsea hardware is not difficult to
imagine. Especially if it’s a 100-ton manifold moving
over 3,000 gallons of that oil every minute.
On platforms throughout the Gulf of Mexico,
this is a clear and present danger that many
people are quite concerned about, to say the
least.
Others aren’t losing sleep over it at all.
Their secret? Manifold components made
of engineered materials from Sandvik. These
materials resist corrosion like nothing else. No
matter how sour the crude or how aggressive
the chemicals.
Sandvik uses powder-metal HIP technology to
manufacture huge and complex offshore components with a minimum of welds. This makes them
not only corrosion-resistant, but remarkably
strong and reliable as well. They can take just
about any kind of beating down there.
As the oil and gas industry goes up against
more hostile operating conditions, Sandvik’s cure
is more innovative metallurgical technology and
more advanced materials.
We continuously develop new, higher grades
of these materials, along with new manufacturing
processes. The result is equipment that withstands corrosion, pressure, high temperatures
and mech-anical stress better than ever before.
Engineered materials from Sandvik. Possibly
your best insurance against bad news.

The oil has a 38-50° gravity and a
300-400 cu m/cu m GOR. The associated gas contains about 5-10% CO2 and
5% H2S.
The reservoirs are at a 3-5 km depth
and have a high 7,000-14,000 psi pressure. The stringers commonly have a
low 0.1-10 md permeability.
PDO has drilled more than 60

Qarn Alam

PDO discovered Qarn Alam in 1972
and estimates that initial oil in place in
the field’s fractured carbonate reservoir
was 1 billion bbl. The field produces
heavy 16° gravity, viscous 220-cp oil.
Without the thermal project, PDO
estimates only a 4% ultimate oil recovery from the field. But with its thermally assisted gas-oil gravity drainage
(TAGOGD) project ultimate recoveries
may exceed 32%, according to the
company.

steam-injection project, in which the
steam serves to drive oil to producing
wells, the steam at Qarn Alam provides
heat to enhance the existing gravity
drainage mechanism. This feature allows
the project to have only a few injection
wells.
The company’s plan is to inject during the next 30 years 18,000 tonnes/
day of steam and have a plateau production during 10 years of about 30,000
bo/d.
The project involves drilling 149
new wells that include:
• 69 water supply, aquifer pump off,
and water-disposal wells.
• 15 steam injection wells.
• 36 producing wells.
• 29 observation wells.
Earlier in 2007, PDO let two EPC
contracts for building facilities for the
project.
Facilities will include three heatrecovery steam generators, a 36,000
cu m/day reverse-osmosis plant, and
equipment to handle 62,000 cu m/day
of gross produced fluid and dispose of
64

72,000 cu m/day of water.
The project will have 220 km of
pipelines and flowlines, along with a
power plant.
The main oil-bearing reservoir is the
Shuaiba-Kharaib formation that has a
dome-shape and a 6 by 3 sq km areal
extent. The maximum oil column thickness is 165 m, with the shallow crest
of the Shuaiba at 350 m below ground
level.
The reservoir has a high 29-34%
matrix porosity. Matrix permeablity in
the Shuaiba ranges from 5 to 20 md
while in the Kharaib it is 1-10 md.
PDO awarded the EPC contract for
the on-plot facilities, those erected at
the field site, to Dodsal and the off-plot
facilities, the oil and water flowlines
and associated hardware outside of
the field site, to Galfar Engineering &
Contracting.
“Most of the steam will be generated
by waste-heat recovery from the existing Qarn Alam power station, thereby
reducing the project’s CO2 emissions
and saving on gas consumption,” said

Subsurface Project Team Leader Khalid
al Khabouri.
The start-up date of all facilities will
be around 2010.

Marmul
Initial production from the Al Khlata
sandstone reservoir in Marmul started
in 1980, although the field was discovered in 1956. The reservoir was on
primary production until a waterflooding started in 1986, with full field
waterflooding starting in 1999. Marmul Polymer Project Manager Fakhri
al Sukaiti said a polymer project in the
1980s indicated the feasibility of injecting polymer, although subsequent low
oil prices led to deferring the project.
Although waterflooding improved
recovery, al Sukaiti said that “because
the oil is highly viscous (80-90 cp at
the 45° C. reservoir temperature), the
injected water tended to flow past and
leave behind much oil.”
With its planned polymer flood, al
Sukaiti expects to obtain 10% more
recovery from the field.

Special Report

Polymer flooding uses polymer to
make the injected water more viscous
so that it can more effectively sweep
the remaining oil from the reservoir.
PDO plans to obtain the polymer from
France in powder form and ship it to
the field in bulk containers.
The injection mixture will have 15
cp viscosity.
PDO, in February 2007, awarded an
EPC contract for the Marmul polymer
flooding project to France’s SNF with
the UK’s Mott MacDonald as design
contractor and Oman’s Bahwan Engineering Co. as construction contractor.
The contract involves building centralized water treatment and polymer
preparation and injection facilities as
well as the supplying chemicals for 5
years. Project completion is scheduled
for 2008.
The centralized water-treatment
facilities will include a primary produced-water treatment plant with
capacity of 80,000 cu m/day and a
secondary produced-water treatment
plant with capacity of 30,000 cu m/day
(Fig. 8).
The polymer preparation and injection facilities station will have a capacity
of 17,500 cu m/day.

Fahud
PDO plans to start injecting steam
into one reservoir in Fahud in 2008
as part of a pilot project that kicks off
another TAGOGD development. Fahud
produces 33° gravity oil from the Natih
fractured carbonate and is PDO’s oldest
and largest field in northern Oman. Discovered in 1963, the company estimates
the initial oil in place in the shallow
field was 6.3 billion bbl.
The field has about 380 producing
wells.
But, as John Malcolm, PDO’s managing director, says, “just because a field
has been producing for many years, it
does not mean there is no more scope
for gaining additional reserves from it.
EOR techniques can be applied to it to
give it a new lease of life.”
Like the TAGOGD project at Qarn
Alam, the one at Fahud will involve

injecting steam into the fractures of
a carbonate reservoir. But the Fahud
project will be the first time ever that
the recovery technique is applied to
produce a light oil.
PDO made its investment decision on
steam injection in September 2006 on
the basis of the performance of earlier
water-injection projects and a thorough

review of the development options for
the mature field. To minimize the business risk, the field will be developed
according to a prudent phase-by-phase
approach.
The company says the oil recovery
factor from the field is about 17% and
expects steam injection to add 10% to
the ultimate oil recovery. ✦

Dubai Petroleum Establishment is the
new state oil company that on Apr. 2,
2007, took over operations for a concession area off Dubai that previously
a ConocoPhillips consortium operated
since signing a concession agreement
on Aug. 3, 1961.
The consortium made its first oil discovery at Fateh field on June 23, 1966.
Fateh lies about 160 km northwest of
Dubai in the Arabian Gulf (Fig. 1).
The field is a 73 sq km folded
structure, with a vertical relief of 250
m, and contains numerous carbonate reservoirs. The Cretaceous Mishrif
formation carbonate reservoirs are the
most prolific, having produced 60% of
the oil lifted to date (Fig. 2). At Fateh,
the Mishrif reservoirs are not present
over the crest of the structure, due to
erosion.
Other producing reservoirs include
the Thamama and Ilam carbonates.
Mishrif reservoirs contain a light 33°
gravity oil with 25 ppm H2S. First oil
lifted from Fateh was on Sept. 22, 1969.
Other fields discovered in the concession are SW Fateh on Oct. 26, 1970,
Falah on Aug. 10, 1972, and Rashid on
Aug. 17, 1973.
Secondary oil recovery using seawater injection commenced in the fields
on June 8, 1974. Currently, the fields
have about 240 active oil wells and
120 active injection wells. The oil wells
produce on gas lift, with 17 compressor trains providing 1 bcfd of gas-lift
capacity.
Field facilities (Fig. 3) include 71
processing, compression, water injection, and wellhead platforms, of which
4 are manned, and 317 miles of pipelines.
Final separation and storage occurs
in three submerged steel vessels called

Conventional drilling
Dubai Petroleum also plans to contract additional drilling rigs. Its strategy
includes continuing to use the Nobel
Roy Rhodes jack up drilling rig, which
has been operating in the field for 19
years, to drill conventional sidetrack
horizontal wells in pursuit of unexploited oil pools and has brought in
a second jack up, the Mark Burns, for
drilling additional wells.
It has also contracted for one
hydraulic workover unit recently and
expects to contract another hydraulic
workover unit and jack up rig in early
2008.
By 2008, therefore, it will have five

drilling units working off Dubai, something that has not been seen for many
years, the company says.

Gas production
Increased energy demand in Dubai
has led Dubai Petroleum to begin an
aggressive program for exploiting
potential gas accumulations. Its first
well drilled after taking over concession
operations appraised the potential gas
resources in the Tertiary Asmari limestones.
The company says the well was a
successful test and was hooked up
for producing new lean gas in only 6
weeks after the company started operations.

First gas flowed to shore on May 23,
2007.
The company commenced in July
2007 further appraisal drilling of a potentially larger accumulation of Asmari
gas at SW Fateh.

On a net-adjusted
basis, total US propane
inventory at the end of
March 2007 was 2.8 million bbl lower than yearearlier volumes. During
second and third quarters
2007, accumulation of
inventory in primary storage in the US
totaled only 34-36 million bbl, or about
8 million bbl less than the average for
2003-06.

US PROPANE

A slump in waterborne
propane imports into the
US during second and
third quarters 2007 caused
an inventory deficit to
widen. For the 2007-08
winter heating season, the
deficit itself is the critical
supply parameter that defines the supply outlook for US propane markets.
Propane supply
for the US winter
heating season
depends on domestic production,
imports, and inventory in primary
storage.
Primary storage facilities are those
that report their inventories to the Energy Information Administration (EIA)
weekly and monthly. From the perspective of propane retailers, propane
inventory statistics are the most widely
reported of the three sources of supply
and are viewed as the critical supply
parameter.
At the end of March 2007, EIA’s
Petroleum Supply Monthly statistics
showed that propane inventories in primary storage fell to a seasonal low of 27
million bbl. EIA inventory data report
the combined volumes of both purity
propane and refinery-grade propylene.
Propylene volumes contained in the
reported inventory figure for the end
of March totaled 2.7 million bbl. When
propylene inventory is excluded, the
true volume of propane in primary
storage totaled only 24.3 million bbl.

Feedstock demand
During first-quarter 2007, feedstock demand for propane rebounded
to 357,000 b/d from 318,000 b/d in
fourth-quarter 2006. Feedstock demand
for propane continued to increase during second-quarter 2007 and averaged
366,000 b/d. Feedstock demand in
second-quarter 2007 was only 10,000
b/d lower than in 2006 and did little to
alleviate the growing inventory deficit.
As the inventory deficit widened
during third-quarter 2007, propane
prices in Mont Belvieu strengthened
relative to other feedstocks, and feedstock demand declined to 352,000 b/d
in July and 336,000 b/d in August.
Feedstock demand in September hit an
estimated 300,000-320,000 b/d and
demand for third-quarter 2007 averaged 329,000-336,000 b/d.
In comparison, feedstock demand in
third-quarter 2006 averaged 349,000
b/d, or 13,000-20,000 b/d more than
in 2007. Again, as during second-quarter 2007, the year-to-year decline in
feedstock demand was insignificant in

will almost certainly be fully depleted
before the end of February 2008 in a
winter with only an average number of
heating degree-days.

Propane supply
Gas processors continued to experience very strong profit margins in all
US producing regions during second
and third quarters 2007. Furthermore,
propane prices were consistently 4060¢/gal higher than their btu-equivalent based on spot natural gas prices in
the Houston Ship Channel market—indicating that refineries had no economic incentive to use propane instead of
natural gas in their fuel systems.
Strong profitability for all gas processing plants and the economic incentives for refineries lead to the conclusion that US propane production was at
full recovery levels for both gas plants
and refineries. Data published by EIA
show total production from gas plants
and net propane production from refineries averaged 841,000 b/d, or 39,000
b/d higher than year-earlier volumes.

Propane’s use as a space-heating fuel in residential-commercial
reaches its seasonal peak each year
during the fourth and ﬁrst quarters.
Residential-commercial propane
demand begins to increase during
October and usually reaches peak
demand during December-January.

During second-quarter 2007,

113.2¢/gal and propane’s feedstock
parity value averaged only 112.8¢/gal.
By this measure, propane prices were
neutral relative to ethane and natural
gasoline during second-quarter 2007.
During third-quarter 2007, however,
spot prices in Mont Belvieu averaged
122.3¢/gal but feedstock parity values
averaged only 117.8¢/gal.
Based on this comparison, propane
prices were relatively stronger during
third-quarter 2007. The shift in price/
value relationships during third-quarter
2007 was consistent with the emerging view of tight supplies for 2007-08

Many people in the petroleum
products and petrochemicals industries expect crude oil prices to remain
greater than $80/bbl or to increase
further during the 2007-08 winter
heating season.
During 2001-06, propane’s price
ratio vs. WTI averaged 70-75% in fourth
quarter. The tight supply situation and
low inventory level in PADD III will
support stronger propane prices relative
to other ethylene feedstocks. Based on
an expected propane/WTI price ratio
of 75% and WTI prices at $80/bbl, spot
prices in Mont Belvieu are likely to be
135-145¢/gal during fourth-quarter

2007 and first-quarter 2008, crude oil
inventories will be adequate, gasoline
prices are likely to fall to typical seasonal levels vs. WTI.
Hence, WTI prices may fall by $1015/bbl during fourth-quarter 2007 and
may average $65/bbl in fourth-quarter
2007 and $60-65/bbl in first-quarter
2008. On this basis, spot propane prices

RECOVERY METHODS

™

September 30 – October 2, 2008
Hilton Fort Worth
Fort Worth, Texas USA

THE RETHINKING CONTINUES
By rethinking recovery methods, producers have brought to a hungry market gas from reservoirs once considered economically and
technically impossible. Tight sands, shales, and coalbeds now represent large and growing sources of an essential form of clean energy.
But they’re still unconventional. The reservoirs are complex. The costs of drilling into and completing
wells in them are high and rising. They present unique environmental problems.
Producing gas from unconventional reservoirs proﬁtably, safely, and in amounts demanded by the
market requires continuous rethinking – the kind of thinking that shoves back limits on what’s possible
with gas supply.
Rethinking of recovery methods will continue Sept. 30 – Oct. 2, 2008, at the Unconventional Gas
International Conference & Exhibition at the Hilton Fort Worth in Fort Worth, Texas. Planned by editors
of Oil & Gas Journal and an advisory board of industry experts, the event will highlight innovation
from unconventional gas plays around the world. It will be your chance to meet and learn from other
professionals in the fastest-growing sector of the gas-producing industry.
So mark your calendar.

there was a concern that half of the
flow being diverted to the regenerated
bed during switchover might cause
disturbances to the SRU. At the end of
the regeneration step, the carbon bed
retains a lot of water.
When the vessel is brought online,
the acid gas has a capacity to absorb
water. Being at 50% relative humidity, however, acid gas leaves the bed
saturated. Over time the bed is striped
of water and is completely dried long
before the end of the adsorption cycle.
This water is carried directly the SRU.

water would have to be entrained from
the knockout drum. The Cl- ion cannot
exist as a free atom; it must be in aqueous solution to exist as a chloride. In
the preheater, because acid gas is heated
to reduce the relative humidity to about
50%, there is no free water.
To guard against the remote possibility that free water containing
chlorides could migrate to the carbon
beds and to promote effective steam
condensate drainage, we instructed the
fabricator to flush-grind weld seams
and the outlet nozzle at the center of
the vessel in the 6 o’clock position.
This is the nozzle from which the initial condensed steam is removed.
Our metallurgical engineer noted
that, provided there was no build up of
stagnant water within the vessel, there
would be far less opportunity for chloride attack. Furthermore, he advised
that stainless steel is far less susceptible
to chloride attack if there is no oxygen
present. For process reasons the carbon
beds are always kept completely free
of air during operation; this gave us
added confidence there would not be a
problem.

Commissioning
During initial commissioning,
reaction-furnace flame instability was
a problem during switchover of a
regenerated carbon bed. Since then,
however, very significant progress has
been made to reduce the magnitude
of disturbances to the SRU during
switchover. We are continuing to refine
the sequence logic further to minimize
disturbances to the SRU from operation of the carbon beds.

CBU performance
We begin with a discussion of the
disturbance to the reaction furnace and
air-demand analyzer caused by bringing
a regenerated vessel online. The process
data discussed reflect operation with the
sequence logic we have developed.

switchover. The reaction furnace’s temperature drops by about 60° F., in line
with simulation results discussed earlier.
Visual inspection of furnace flame when
vessels are brought online shows no
noticeable change in flame pattern.
Switching vessels causes a brief
disruption to the tail gas H2S:SO2 ratio
(Fig. 2b). The period of off-ratio opera88

2006

tion is short-lived and corrected in less
than half an hour. Because the vessels
are switched fewer than four times per
day, recovery loss due to the transitory
period of off-ratio tail gas is insignificant.
To obtain a qualitative estimate,
consider Fig. 2b which shows the air
demand peaking at 3.25% excess air.

Fig. VIII-1 in H. Paskall’s Capability
of the Modified-Claus Process shows
recovery loss due to off-ratio operation
in terms of percent excess or deficient
air.3 Taking as a basis 96% recovery for a
very lean feed SRU with perfect control,
the recovery drops by 1⁄3% for an excess
air of 3.25%.
To be conservative we assume the
time of decreased recovery due to
off-ratio operation is 2 hr/day, which
is definitely a worst-case assumption
because it takes the peak off-ratio value
over the entire period. Taking 1⁄3% recovery loss for 2 hr out of 24-hr results in
a daily net recovery loss of (2/24) • 1⁄3%
= 0.028%. Although this value is very
small, we are working on eliminating
these spikes in air demand altogether.
As far as CBU performance itself is
concerned, the capacity and removal
efficiency as defined earlier has generally met or exceeded expectations. A
surprise has been the extent to which
benzene removal has surpassed 80%
even during the early part of the adsorption cycle despite the fact that the
beds are not being dried and cooled as
part of the regeneration step.
The adsorption time to breakthrough is greater than design, indicating that the capacity of the carbon used
in design was conservative. (Breakthrough is defined as the mass-transfer
zone reaching the top of the bed.)
There have been some unexpected
analytical results between the two gas
plants that we are reviewing.
At this point we have not determined with certainty if there is a real
process difference or an unresolved
analytical issue. As one can appreciate
when analyzing for aromatic components in the single-digit ppm range, a
minor change in reported outlet composition will have a significant impact
on calculated removal efficiency.
Deactivation of Claus catalyst due to
BTX poisoning has been eliminated or
reduced to such a small value that it has
not been possible to measure over 20
months. Graphs in Fig. 3 show the impact. These graphs show first converter

SRUs at Uthmaniyah and Shedgum gas
plants that had a CBU installed to treat
their feeds. The performance of the
other units is similar and was reported
in the original Laurance Reid Gas Conditioning Conference paper.

Feed variations
A few words of background are
necessary to interpret these results. At
Uthmaniyah and Shedgum, the trains
receive acid-gas from headers that are
fed from gas-treating units that process
both associated and Khuff gas. The mix
between the two varies from day to
day; as a result acid-gas quality is not
constant.
Variations in acid-gas composition
will change the first converter ∆T for a
given reaction furnace bypass amount
and catalyst activity. That is why there is
considerable variation in the converter
∆T shown in the figures. Still, one can
observe a clear downward trend for
converter ∆T before installation of the
carbon beds and the stable temperature
profile afterwards.
To illustrate the point, Fig. 3c for
Train 4 at Shedgum is discussed in
detail.
The temperature scale for this figure, greater than in the other figures,
suppresses the day-to-day fluctuations
caused by changes in sour-gas feed
mix and allows the general trend to
be seen more clearly. As well, this train
underwent two catalyst regenerations,
which shows how BTX was devastating
the catalyst before installation of the
CBU.
This is the train that processes a mix
of acid gases from both associated and
high-pressure Khuff gas treating and as
a result has more BTX in its feed. From
November 2005 to January 2006, the
∆T had dropped to about 35° F., indicating the first bed was only achieving
20-30% approach to equilibrium. A
catalyst regeneration completed in early
January restored a substantial degree of
activity, bringing the ∆T up to around
165° F.
Immediately after regeneration, the
activity started to drop dramatically
90

again, so that by the middle of February the ∆T was only 80° F. At that time
the CBU for Train 4 was commissioned
and another catalyst regeneration performed. After that, the converter’s ∆T
is seen to be essentially constant, only
changing in response to feed composition variations.
Although Fig. 3 only reports first
converter ∆T up until November 2006,
the carbon beds continue to demonstrate excellent results. There has been
no apparent decrease in activity in the
first converters through to early August
2007.
The elimination of BTX-caused deactivation has already had tangible and
important benefits. Whereas it had been
the practice to replace large amounts of
Claus catalyst every 2 years to maintain
recovery, it has been determined that
catalyst changes can be deferred, resulting in savings of hundreds of thousands
of dollars because of the size and number of SRUs involved.
Perhaps even more significant is that
our planned conversion of the SRUs
at Shedgum and Uthmaniyah to the
SuperClaus process can go ahead as
planned. Without our first addressing
the chronic deactivation that had been
experienced for the last 25 years, SuperClaus would not have been a viable
process retrofit.

First maintenance;
inspection shutdown
As discussed earlier, there was a concern regarding chlorides and possible
corrosion in stainless-steel vessels. We
completed almost 1 year of operation
on one of the trains and in November
2006, the CBU and SRU were shut
down for routine maintenance. This afforded us the opportunity to open and
inspect the carbon-bed vessels to look
for signs of corrosion.
The bottom of the vessels showed
signs of where the regeneration steam
condensate had flowed to the center
outlet nozzle. Whereas the vessel walls
above and below the carbon bed were
shinny, there was some discoloration at

the ends of the vessel at the 6 o’clock
position.
As well, the vessel wall behind the
carbon bed was very mildly discolored.
Red dye penetrant testing, however,
showed no cracks or indication of
incipient metal damage such as pitting.
Our plan is to follow up with another
inspection in a year’s time to monitor
the condition of the vessels and ensure
the results recently seen are maintained.
Installation of carbon beds to adsorb
BTX from acid-gas feed to Saudi Aramco’s lean feed SRUs has successfully
eliminated BTX-induced Claus catalyst
deactivation.
The operational performance of the
CBUs has exceeded expectations in
as much as the adsorption cycles are
longer than anticipated in the design.
This has led to a lower-than-expected
production of regeneration steam condensate.

The risk-based analysis uses uncertainty-based probability analysis to

This first part of two articles describes the parameters of the risk-based
approach and presents the first of two
case studies in which use of uncertainty modeling allows assessment of
the pipeline’s current condition. Life
expectancy is presented as a probability
profile, which can then assess the risk
associated with changing future process
parameters. This modeling approach
also allows corrosion data to be transferred into financial data by assessing
probability and risk.
The second, concluding, article will
present the second case study.

Background

Ensuring pipeline integrity has
become increasingly important to the
oil and gas industry. An ageing pipeline
infrastructure faces increased pressure
from regulators and a zero-tolerance
approach to hydrocarbon releases.
The opening of marginal fields
requires existing pipelines to operate
well beyond their original design life
and in many cases with large changes
in operating conditions. Development
of new fields in remote environments is
also leading to use of technically probBased on presentation to the NACE Corrosion

scenarios of a model by repeatedly sampling values from
the probability distributions
for the different uncertain

defined ranges through the model to
produce an output. Multiple passes are
carried out (typically 1,000-10,000),
defining a range of possible outcomes.
Either a histogram or a probability
profile (also known as a cumulative
probability curve or S-curve) represent
the results (Fig. 2).
A histogram displays all the outcomes along the X-axis and the probability (frequency) of occurrence along
the Y-axis. It divides the X-axis into
a suitable number of equal intervals,
allowing the shape of the range of
outcomes to be visualized and the symmetry and peaks in the distribution to
be seen.
The S-curve shows the likelihood or
probability of reaching certain values.
The Y-axis displays the cumulative
frequency as a function of the output
values along the X-axis. A steep and
narrow S-curve shows less uncertainty,
while a wide and long S-curve shows

SUBSEA TIEBACK
Forum & Exhibition

PennWell invites you back to the 8th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition.
SSTB has become the premier event for one of the fastest growing field
development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March 3 – 5, 2008 in
Galveston, TX at the Moody Gardens Hotel & Conference Center. Over 2,000
people and 150 exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference.You can’t
afford to miss it.
As our industry confronts new challenges, it has never been more important
to submerse yourself in them. This year’s theme is “Subsea is here, the game
is changing.” As our game changes, the sharing of knowledge and collective
experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety,
and economics of the subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by
industry leaders. As in the past, only by participating in this conference will you
be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will not be published and no
Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room
stays inside the conference room. We hope you will join us.

New web mapping service

New UPS rated at 1.5-3 kVa

A new web mapping service (WMS)
has been added to this firm’s suite of webbased mapping products available to Eddy
Watch subscribers.
The new product allows clients to
import proprietary data into their own
geographic information system (GIS).
These data layers include tropical storm
tracks, GPS drifter data, loop current and
eddy fronts, satellite imagery, and forecast
charts.
Once the WMS has been added to
an end user’s GIS, the layers continually
update, eliminating the need for clients to
add new layers just to update their maps.
This new WMS seamlessly integrates into
GIS applications such as Redlands, Calif.based Environmental Systems Research
Institute’s ArcGIS and is compliant with
the standards for web map services as laid
out by Open Geospatial Consortium Inc.,
Wayland, Mass.
Source: Horizon Marine Inc., 15 Creek
Rd., Marion, MA 02738.

A new line of uninterruptible power
systems (UPS) SSG Series UPS Plus models
is rated at 1.5-3 kVA.
The company says its regenerative online UPS is an advanced, robust, and rugged solution that gives users a high level of
power protection that can tolerate many of
the elements found in the oil industry. The
unit is capable of withstanding temperatures as high as 131° F.
The SSG Series UPS can be placed in an
equipment rack or installed as a standalone tower, in close proximity to the
critical load. This eliminates the need to
shield the UPS from the environment. This
point-to-point installation strategy helps
save users the time and effort required
to configure and wire elaborate power
distribution for the various devices that
need protection and helps lower the cost
of installing UPSs, the firm notes.
The series also provides users an improved level of battery monitoring and
replacement notification as well as user

friendly, hot-swappable battery packs.
Slide-out battery packs are easily replaced
through the UPS front panel, without having to remove the UPS from the equip-

ment rack, eliminating the handling of
individual batteries and the associated
wiring hassles.
The series is designed to give users
the highest level of protection against a
spectrum of power problems. It provides a
continuous, clean, tightly regulated power
source from the most polluted incoming
AC power source, the firm points out.

CONDENSATE EAST OF SUEZ:
NGL and its Naphtha Impacts in
Asia Pacific and Mideast Gulf
Condensate and the Light-End Products Squeeze
By Asia Paciﬁc Energy Consulting

• This is the “deﬁnitive” report on
condensate in the fastest growing,
critical regions of the world, Asia
Paciﬁc and the Mideast Gulf.

Condensate coming into its own
Condensate, one of the two groups
deﬁned as Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs),
is ﬁnally coming of age in world trade,
marketing, reﬁning and petrochemicals. Condensate sales are moving
from a niche marketing specialty to
a mainstream segment of crude and
products trade, and nowhere is this
more evident than in the Mideast Gulf
and Asia Paciﬁc.
This report explains how the protean
nature of condensate allows it to be
used in a wide range of sectors: as a
reﬁnery slate component; in specialized distillation towers called condensate splitters; in direct feed to ethylene crackers; in gasoline blending and
as a substitute for gas in turbine power generation. It can be deﬁned as a
base material, a blending component,
a feedstock or a boiler feed.

Mortgage crunch
a reminder of
economic cycles
The US treasury secretary offered lessons all around—some related to oil and
gas—in a stinging Oct. 16 speech about the
meltdown of housing ﬁnance.
Henry M. Paulson Jr. had few comforting words for his audience at the Georgetown University Law Center in Washington,
DC.
While the US economy remains strong,
he said, it has been wounded by a housing

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

slump caused in part by “shameful” lending practices and won’t fully recover until
housing starts rebound—a turn not yet in
sight.
Paulson noted fragmentation of the
mortgage lending industry into parts that
originate, package, and invest in mortgage
loans. And he regretted a proliferation of
nontraditional adjustable rate mortgages
(ARMs) coupled with increased lending
to borrowers not qualifying for the lowest
interest rates.
About one fourth of the mortgage
originations in 2005 and 2005 were nontraditional ARMs, many with risky features
such as low teaser rates and interest-only
payments. Subprime lending grew from 2%
of mortgages in 1998 to 14% in mid-2007.
“A signiﬁcant percentage of the nontraditional ARMs were marketed and sold to
subprime borrowers,” Paulson said. At another point he called for “a higher level of
integrity” in mortgage origination. “Some
of the conduct and practices that I have
learned about are shameful.”
Still, he said, “homebuyers have a responsibility to understand their mortgages.”
That’s easy to overlook when words like
“shameful” are being used in high places
to describe an industry.
How hard is it to see the risk here? If you
take out an adjustable-rate loan you can
barely afford when interest rates are low,
you get hammered when rates rise.
That’s not “if” rates rise; it’s “when” they
do. In an economy, everything cycles. Most
ARM borrowers surely saw the risk of an
adverse interest-rate turn. They just thought
it wouldn’t happen.
How many Americans similarly bought
sport utility vehicles or monster pickup
tricks on the assumption that fuel prices
would stay low forever?
Oil prices, like interest rates, cycle. They
never stay low, and buyers of beamy vehicles were wrong to expect them to.
Lest anyone forget, oil prices never stay
high, either.

Facing $100/bbl oil
The December contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes climbed as high as
$92.22/bbl during the regular trading session Oct. 26 on the New York Mercantile Exchange before closing at $91.86, up $1.40 for the day.
It was the second time in as many sessions that contract hit new highs above $90/bbl
after crossing that mark for the ﬁrst time on Oct. 18. Moreover, the contract’s price continued to climb pass $93/bbl in after-hours electronic trading over the weekend and appeared
set to scale new heights before expiring.
“The oil market may be only one or two events away from $100-plus oil, and there
is much momentum in that direction,” said Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge
Energy Research Associates, at an Oct. 29 energy symposium at Georgetown University in Washington, DC. “With prices over $90/bbl and strong anticipation of $100, the
oil market is showing signs of high fever, stoked by fears of clashes in the Middle East
and resulting disruptions of supply.”
Analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc. cited several factors pushing crude prices higher, including:
• Storms in the Gulf of Mexico forced Petroloeos Mexicanos, Mexico’s state-run oil
company, to shut in 600,000 b/d of offshore production, one-ﬁfth of Mexico’s total oil
output.
• The US dollar hit record lows against the euro, as investors anticipated that the US
Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its next meeting.
• Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have disregarded
calls from various sources to increase production. Instead, OPEC blames geopolitical issues for driving up prices.
• Increased military tensions between Turkey and Kurdish rebels in Iraq.
Turkey and Iraq
Turkey’s threat to invade northern Iraq and attack bases of the Kurdistan Workers’
Party (PKK) , “has sent prices spiraling upwards, primarily because the words ‘conﬂict’
and ‘Middle East’ always cause traders to respond with alarm,” said Michael C. Lynch,
president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research Inc., Amherst, Mass. However,
Lynch said, “The Turks are unlikely to do much more than cross into border regions
and attack the mountain bases near there, which are well away from any oil producing areas (located mostly near Kirkuk, over 200 km from the border).” He said, “Some
military action can be expected, but it is unlikely to be major and should be dismissed
by the market fairly quickly.”
Meanwhile, Yergin said, “Oil prices are becoming increasingly decoupled from the
fundamentals of supply and demand.” He said, “What we’re seeing in the oil market
today is rooted more in the cauldrons of geopolitics and the impact of ﬁnancial markets,
expectations, and psychology than in supply and demand, but these are real factors.”
He cited the impact on the energy market over the previous 2 weeks of tougher rhetoric
over Iran’s nuclear program and heightened tension between Turkey and Iraq.
Yergin emphasized the importance of Russia in global energy markets in this decade. “While there has been so much attention around the world to the rapid increase
in Chinese oil consumption, the growth in Russian oil production between 2000 and
2006—2.9 million b/d—exceeded the 2.5 million b/d increase in Chinese oil demand
over the same period,” he said. “But while Chinese consumption continues to go up,
Russia’s increase in output is ﬂattening out rapidly owing to swiftly rising costs and
very high government taxes on oil production.”
He told the Georgetown University conference, “Although publics and governments
around the world are focused on prices, one of the most important factors in the world oil
industry is the rapid rise in costs owing to shortages of people, equipment, and skills.”
Natural gas
Natural gas has become “arguably the most contentious issue” between Europe and
Russia, which is the world’s largest producer of natural gas and the major exporter to
Europe, Yergin said. A new CERA study of the gas interdependence between Europe and
Russia shows “structural reasons” for that tension, because of major changes in Russia,
Europe, and the international gas market itself over the last decades.
The US National Petroleum Council estimates world energy consumption is likely to
increase by 50-60% over the next quarter century, Yergin said. “Meeting that demand in
an environmentally-sound way will be a very major challenge for all energy-producing
countries, including both Russia and the US,”he said. “And the results will have a decisive
impact on how nations deﬁne their energy security and what they do about it.”

Two new deepwater ﬂoating production facility designs were recently reviewed by
ABS. The Multicolumn Floater (MCF) shown at left was developed by AGR Deepwater
Development Systems Inc. The MinDOC3 design shown at right was developed by
Alden “Doc” Laborde and William Bennett over 8 years in concert with a consortium
of leading deepwater companies. The MinDOC3 technology is owned by Durward
International, a joint venture of Keppel FELS and TexBass.

Costs, environmental/safety issues
top deepwater concerns

C

ompanies that provide equipment and services to the
deepwater oil and gas operations sector see little prospect that soaring costs will be reined in anytime soon.
New productivity solutions are offered to help
cope with the shortages of drilling rigs and qualiﬁed personnel
that are contributing to those rising costs. Adding to cost pressures are new design criteria being implemented in the wake
of the devastating hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico in recent
years. Environmental concerns also remain paramount in the
deepwater service and supply sector. Evolving technology is
spawning new deepwater designs to address productivity, efﬁciency, safety, and environmental challenges, particularly for
the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.

Soaring costs

MODU [mobile offshore drilling unit] demand softens, the rig
count goes up, and/or alternative methods play a (secondary)
role to divert some of the demand needed for well workovers/
interventions.”
Among the alternative methods that Skeels sees as possible
solutions to accommodate continuing strong demand for deepwater drillings rigs—beyond the obvious one of more newbuilds
to address drilling and completion needs—are efforts to “1) continue to work with ideas to leverage smaller (‘lesser-generation’)
drilling rigs to artiﬁcially extend their capability using slimbore
drilling and drilling risers, free-standing risers, preset moorings,
etc.; and 2) bring to the marketplace light well (i.e., rigless) intervention for workovers and other subsea maintenance jobs.”
Namtvedt also contends that “reliability and operability will
be key for deepwater rig providers to get the needed productivity out of the high unit cost—thus companies with experienced
crews and a strong network of subcontractors and supplier infrastructure in place will be preferred.”
The same situation applies to the fabrication community,
he adds: “Unfortunately, I think we will see a number of ‘train
wrecks’ before the current rig construction backlog has been
delivered.”

The supply chain for drilling rigs is still quite strained and appears
to remain so through 2010, according to Eric H. Namtvedt, president of FloaTEC.
“We are still seeing operators and drilling contractors call
on options for late 2010/early 2011 deliveries, and, more importantly, that is the time frame when a large number of ﬂoating
production platforms will be competing for the same yard and
equipment capacities,” he says.
“The bottom line is that we will
see continued ‘high activity’ for the
foreseeable future.”

A

s the offshore oil and natural gas industry continues
its march into deepwater frontiers, the facilities that
will be the mainstays of that push, subsea installations and ﬂoating production facilities, will take on a
distinctively different look.
Much of the design changes will entail borrowing the basic
concepts in use today and reconﬁguring them in new ways.
Other hallmarks of tomorrow’s deepwater production facilities
will be increased automation, more modularization, improved
size/weight ratios, longer tiebacks, and expanded use of subsea processing.

of-a-kind giant templates with integrated and form-ﬁtting piping
and connections are fading into the past, claims Brian Skeels,
emerging technology manager, FMC Technologies.
“Clustered wells leading to manifolds connected by umbilical ﬂying leads and jumper connections allow for smaller modular components that can be set on the seaﬂoor side-by-side
and then connected up,” he says. “This modular approach also
lends itself to easier installation and a pay-as-you-go schedule.
Subsea production facilities can be added later in a modular
plug-and-play scenario to deal with production plateaus or
changes in well count. Smart subsea ﬁeld architects will add
plug-in bases in the ﬁeld pipelines that can accommodate the
later installation of more infrastructure when it’s needed, without disturbing what was initially installed.

New technology solutions
advancing deepwater capability

A

host of new game-changing technology solutions is
advancing the oil and gas industry’s capabilities in
deep and ultradeep waters.
Advances have been noted in technologies for
deepwater drilling, ﬂoating production, subsea wells, deepwater pipeline construction and protection, risers, subsea separation, controls, tie-ins and tiebacks, ﬂow assurance, and hub
design, among others.
Even with the most innovative technology advances, however, it’s important to keep in mind practical considerations in
this hotly competitive market, according to Eric H. Namtvedt,
president of FloaTEC.
“I am sure the deepwater challenges will continue to produce astonishing achievements,” he says. “But, as we say at
FloaTEC, with our unique support by our parent companies
J. Ray McDermott and Keppel FELS, no concept or technical
breakthrough has any real value unless it can be coupled with
a credible and doable delivery model, where the elements of

project deliveries are managed by capable contractors who can
handle the risks of the complete supply chain.”

Deepwater drilling/completion/intervention
Brian Skeels, emerging technology manager, FMC Technologies, ticks off these technology needs for deepwater drilling: “Dealing with deep well and deepwater kicks, especially
when a deep well kick is undetectable until sometime later,
as the kick is circulated out; accepting expandable casing for
more of the well’s casing strings—eventually getting closer
to the monodiameter well concept; and continued efforts in
slimbore-surface BOP drilling to help keep the rig size down.”
Gary Shaw, technology leader, VetcoGray, a GE Oil & Gas
business, notes that the technology solutions and innovations
for deepwater drilling come primarily from time and weight
savings, citing “time savings to cut rig and installation costs,
and weight savings to extend the depth capabilities of older,
less costly rigs and solutions such as TLPs. Recent examples

Riser installations
In the case of drilling risers, Shaw thinks there are great opportunities in not only improving riser installation time, but also
riser retrieval time.
“It is easy to relate to the economic savings associated with
riser trip time in a ﬁfth-generation rig with a hefty daily rate,” he
says. “There is, however, another driver for reducing riser trip
time. In deep water it could take well over a day to trip out a
21-in. drilling riser. In the case of an unforeseen environmental
condition, such as a rapidly strengthening hurricane, the contractor may not have a day or two to trip the riser out and move
away from location. In certain events, it may be safer to ride
out the hurricane with a connected riser than ride through a
hurricane-force wind with half the riser hung off on the spider.
The reduction of riser trip time, in some situations, could make
the difference between one of the above two unattractive scenarios and one that permits full retrieval of the riser and relocation of the drilling vessel to safer waters.”
Skeels notes that the debate over whether to use steel catenary risers vs. free-standing or tensioned vertical production
risers will be decided by the materials and welding issues encountered while working in ultradeep waters.

distance tiebacks has the potential to save signiﬁcant costs and
operational complexity in the form of eliminating insulation, reducing or eliminating chemical use, and decreasing operational
complexity.
In the end, subsea processing facilities themselves are ﬂow
assurance solutions in that “by separating phases, hydrate formation becomes reactant-limited, while cold ﬂow solutions become enabled for the hydrocarbon liquids and direct water disposal is a possibility,” says Shaw. “Otherwise solutions, such
as VetcoGray’s HeatBank, can be expanded to items beyond
coldspots, valves, and connectors.”
Shaw adds, “As a driver for e-ﬁeld options, ﬂow assurance
software can be used to stabilize unstable operating conditions, provide needed input to condition monitoring software,
and otherwise provide options for reduced risk while operating
at, or near, minimum safe operating conditions.”
Nooteboom concurs, adding that subsea processing technology has made great gains in the past decade, and the pace of
advancement is increasing: “Advancements in the capabilities
of subsea processing, pumping, and compression are changing
the way we look at ﬂow assurance for subsea developments
and will help to increase technically viable tieback distances to
economically develop remote oil reservoirs.”

Flow assurance
One of industry’s knottiest challenges in the deepwater theater
is that of ﬂow assurance.
Nooteboom contends that current deepwater designs employ a considerable conservatism due to uncertainties in ﬂow
assurance strategies resulting from uncertain input data.
“This conservatism often results in increased [capital and
operating expenditures] in the form of materials (e.g., insulation), chemicals, and back-up strategies to manage hydrates,”
he points out. “The operational systems put in place to manage hydrates during shutdown conditions (e.g., depressurization, dead oil circulation) and cold restart conditions, as well as
to manage hydrate blockages if they occur, are operationally
complex and can dictate the entire development architecture.”
A cost-effective and proven-reliable electrically heated
ﬂowline (EHF) system could change all this, Nooteboom says:
“Knowing that an EHF system could be run continuously or
switched on during an unplanned shutdown or restart, if a hydrate blockage occurred, would eliminate the capex, opex, and
operational complexities associated with conservative ‘beltand-suspenders’ solutions.”
Further down the line is the concept of cold ﬂow, a notion
that has been much discussed of late in the ﬂow assurance
community, Nooteboom points out.
“The typical ﬂow assurance approach is to preserve the
heat energy in the ﬂuids to prevent wax deposition and hydrate
formation,” he explains. “ Cold ﬂow would allow the ﬂuids to
cool such that wax and hydrate particles are allowed to form
and are transported to a host as a slurry without forming blockages. This technology does not currently exist.
“The ability to employ cold ﬂow in deepwater and/or long
| November 5, 2007 | Technology Forum |

Boosting/pumping
Another area of game-changing technology advances in deepwater operations is that of subsea boosting and pumping.
“Continuing development, application, and maturation of
subsea separation systems technologies will allow installation
of subsea pumping/compression systems that are more compact, more efﬁcient, and better able to accommodate changing
GVF over ﬁeld life,” Nooteboom says. ”Improvements in power
delivery and control systems, both long-distance and local ﬁeld,
will lead to improved economics.”
Flexible solutions and power are the critical issues in subsea
boosting, according to Shaw.
“The operating envelopes for many ﬁelds are large—high
production early in life and low production late in life,” he notes.
“Finding solutions—for instance, changing out of equipment
and/or operating with varying redundancy to effectively produce
throughout the life of the ﬁelds—is one key factor to facilitate
ﬁeld development and/or improve the economics.
“Power is also a limiting factor. The demand for both higher
power and longer step-outs is increasing. Higher power might
reduce the number of pumps running in series or parallel and
a subsea VSD and distribution system might increase the stepout distance.”
The big challenge in multiphase pumping is high differential
pressure, says Shaw: “Low reservoir pressure, in combination
with deepwater installation, demands high delta pressure. By
being able to supply high delta pressure, running pumps in series can be avoided.”
In the end, Skeels thinks that multiphase pumping will stay
a niche market, “because customizing a pump/impeller system

for every GOR will be one-of-a-kind designs for each project.
Accurate, ‘ﬁscal-quality’ multiphase metering also still has a
ways to go but is making great strides and, hopefully, it will
eventually eliminate the need for a test pipeline.”

Subsea compression
Subsea compression is considered to have a signiﬁcantly lower
investment and operational cost than the platform compression
alternative, with the same core functionality of compressing gas
for transportation purposes to shore for further processing and
export, contends Shaw, adding, “In a nutshell, subsea compression has the potential to increase the ultimate gas recovery.”
Working with Aker Kvaerner, GE Oil & Gas has completed
the conceptual design of a 12-Mw subsea compressor, the
Blue-CTM, the largest ever developed for subsea applications,
and is set to begin construction of the compressor to be tested
in the pilot project in Ormen Lange ﬁeld off central Norway.

“The aim of the [Ormen Lange] pilot project
is to evaluate whether a subsea compression
station, at approximately 900 m of water depth,
is a viable alternative to an offshore platform....
This technology could then be applied to other
subsea ﬁeld developments, eliminating the need
for offshore platforms.”
— Gary Shaw, GE Oil & Gas Vetco Gray
“The aim of the pilot project is to evaluate whether a subsea
compression station, at approximately 900 m of water depth,
is a viable alternative to an offshore platform,” Shaw says. “This
project represents a major milestone in the development of
subsea compression technology. If the project produces the
expected results, the Ormen Lange partners will have a costeffective alternative to the originally planned offshore platform.
This technology could then be applied to other subsea ﬁeld developments, eliminating the need for offshore platforms.”
Subject to the Ormen Lange partners’ ﬁnal approval, Aker
Kvaerner’s subsea compression station pilot project will undergo controlled endurance tests during 2009-2011 at a gas treatment facility in Nyhamna, Norway.

Deepwater pipelines
Construction methods for deepwater pipelines have logged signiﬁcant progress, but line pipe materials issues still need to be
resolved.
“J-lay is well established,” contends Skeels. “The question
is back to the pipe design, its mill quality, and the efﬁcacy of its
fabrication in the ﬁeld.
“I think we’re coming to a point where it’s the fabrication
methods and the material that we have to design in for the

pipeline itself, not the installation vessel. Wall thicknesses are
getting too great for pipe mills to handle with consistent quality, and conventional weld approaches are becoming more and
more suspect, requiring difﬁcult pre- and post-heat treatment,
not to mention understanding the complicated weld metallurgy
involved. Welding rod material and welding procedures are being taxed to their theoretical limits. Insulation and insulation
integrity (not cracking or absorbing water) is becoming a growing concern as subsea facilities continue to move farther out
in 40° water. HIPPS [high-integrity pipeline protection system]
will also play a big part in keeping riser material choice and wall
thickness to reasonable limits.”
With water depths getting deeper and deeper, pipeline infrastructure has also had to change to accommodate harsher
environments, according to Shaw.
“For example, wall thickness has increased to handle the
ultra-high pressures,” he points out. “This has, in turn, posed
a challenge for offshore pipeline
inspection service capabilities, as
many conventional in-line tools are
no longer up to the task.”

Hub design
Nooteboom sees a long-term advantage for deepwater hubs.
“As declining reservoirs will
create excess capacity on existing
facilities, (long-distance) tiebacks
will allow remote reserves to be
economically produced to these
existing facilities,” he says. “This
will, on one hand, extend the economic lifespan of the existing
(hub) facilities and, on the other hand, bring the development
cost of remote deepwater reservoirs within economic reach.
“Where such hub facilities don’t exist and the development
of a small reservoir with a standalone production facility is
not economically viable, an economic solution may be found
by developing several smaller remote reservoirs concurrently
and producing them to a common new-built hub. Several operators may collaborate and collectively develop their respective reservoirs as tiebacks to a jointly owned hub or encourage
a third party to build and operate this facility. Independence
Hub, in Mississippi Canyon Block 920, is an example of such a
joint development among Anadarko, Kerr-McGee [now part of
Anadarko], Dominion, Spinnaker, Devon, and Enterprise.
“We are likely to see more of these collaborative developments with jointly owned/operated hub infrastructure; or where
third parties develop hub facilities to accommodate multiple operators where these operators would otherwise not have been
able to economically produce their reservoirs as standalone
developments.”
Subsea hubs also will be designed for retroﬁt of subsea
separation, pumping, and compression modules, as needed to
suit changing production scenarios. ]

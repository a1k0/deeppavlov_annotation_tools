COVER
The Heerema Thialf deepwater construction vessel recently installed
the topsides onto the single-column Atlantia SeaStar tension-leg
platform that will serve as the production facility for the BHP Billiton Petroleum Inc.-operated Neptune field in the Gulf of Mexico.
Neptune is one of the projects listed in the special report, p. 43,
that tabulates major worldwide oil and gas ventures that will come
onstream in the next few years. BHP Billiton expects the Neptune
TLP, moored in 4,250 ft of water, to start processing production
from subsea completed wells by yearend.The facility is designed
to process up to 50,000 bo/d and 50 MMcfd of gas. Photo from

General

Interest

House GOP panel members press for bill markup
Republicans on the US House Science and Technology Committee continue to press for a markup of HR 2337, which was
originally scheduled for July 11 but was abruptly postponed by
Chairman Bart Gordon (D-Tenn.).
Gordon began the markup and then quickly recessed it to
negotiate with the House Natural Resources Committee, which
passed the bill on June 13.
The measure would repeal several provisions in the 2005 Energy Policy Act, introduce new produced water disposal regulations, limit royalty in-kind payments to oil for refilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, require the US Minerals Management
Service to conduct at least 550 annual audits by 2009, significantly increase surface landholders’ rights in federal split-estate
situations, and raise onshore oil and gas reclamation fees and
bonds.
On July 12 Gordon said he would negotiate with the Natural
Resources Committee to avoid forcing House parliamentarians to
make a ruling on the Science and Technology Committee’s jurisdiction. Republicans on his committee urged him to go before
the parliamentarians because the bill contains at least seven sections that fall under that jurisdiction.
A spokesman for the committee’s Republicans told OGJ on
July 16 that they also would like a markup so they can introduce
amendments to HR 2337, but they currently don’t expect one.

Roan Plateau drilling opponents blocked
An amendment intended to prevent leasing on the Roan Plateau in Colorado was itself blocked for procedural reasons, but
its proponents said they will continue efforts to prevent leasing
on federal land within the Piceance basin. US Reps. John Salazar and Mark Udall, both Democrats from Colorado, had sought
to amend the US Department of the Interior appropriations bill.
DOI oversees the Bureau of Land Management, which would
lease the area.
The amendment sought to stop funding for BLM leasing in
that western Colorado area (OGJ, June 25, 2007, p. 30).
Questions were raised about financial estimates regarding potential Roan Plateau leasing revenues, and the amendment was
blocked from being attached to the 2008 DOI Appropriations bill
that passed the House floor on June 27.
“In effect, the [George W.] Bush administration is using exaggerated estimates of uncertain oil and gas revenue as an excuse to
force additional oil and gas drilling on the West,” Salazar said in a
news release issued by his Washington, DC, office.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

“Serious questions remain about the federal plan to open up
more of the Roan to oil and gas drilling,” Salazar said. “Had we
been able to get a vote on our amendment, we are confident that
we would have prevailed. We would have been successful in spite
of the misinformation put out by proponents of drilling.”
BLM authorized the drilling of as many as 1,570 gas wells over
20 years on part of the Roan Plateau in western Colorado. BLM
indicated it probably will be at least 6 months before any leases
are offered (OGJ, June 18, 2007, p. 31).
The decision issued by the Glenwood Springs BLM field office
covers 70% of the 73,602 acres of the Roan. A final decision on
the remaining 30%, which includes scenic and environmentally
sensitive areas, is expected later this year following conclusion of
a public comment period.

Mexico beefs up security after pipeline bombings
Mexico has increased security measures at strategic installations in the country following a series of bombings on fuel pipelines operated by state-run Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex).
The Interior Ministry condemned the rebel group Ejército
Popular Revolucionario (EPR), which claimed responsibility for
blasts on the pipelines in central Mexico July 5 and 10 and said
the attacks were “the start of a national campaign of harassment
against the oligarchy and this illegitimate government.”
The group said it would continue the “harassment” until Mexican President Felipe Calderon Hinojosa and Oaxaca governor
Ulises Ruiz show that three EPR members, arrested in Oaxaca,
are alive. According to reports, no one has seen EPR members Edmundo Reyes Amaya, Raymundo Rivera Bravo or Gabriel Alberto
Cruz Sanchez since their arrest May 25.
The July 10 explosion forced suspension of service on the 36in. pipeline that runs between Mexico City and Guadalajara, but
caused no injuries or damage outside of the pipeline’s installations, Pemex said.
The July 5 explosions at a Pemex pipeline in nearby Guanajuato state forced evacuations but caused no injuries.
The Procuraduria General de la Republica said its forensic tests
showed that the three bombs that exploded in Guanajuato were
all of the same type and had exploded simultaneously.
As a result of the attacks—the first time EPR has hit Mexico’s
economic infrastructure—automakers Nissan and Honda halted
production at plants in Aguascalientes and Guadalajara due to the
lack of gas, and Mexican glass maker Vitro temporarily shut down
two glass container plants at Queretaro and Guadalajara.
Pemex said July 10 that it expected to restore service on the
Mexico City-Guadalajara pipeline in 3-4 days. ✦

Development

Total, Gazprom to develop for Shtokman ﬁeld
Russia’s OAO Gazprom and France’s Total SA have signed a
framework agreement for the joint development of the first phase
of the giant Shtokman gas-condensate field in the central part of
the Barents Sea off Russia.
Shtokman field reserves are estimated at 3.7 trillion cu m of gas
and more than 31 million tons of condensate.
The companies will establish a special purpose vehicle to organize the design, financing, construction, and operation of the
infrastructure of the delelopment’s first phase, which will produce
23.7 billion cu m/year of gas. The SPV will own this infrastructure
for 25 years from field commissioning.
Gazprom will hold a 75% participating interest in the vehicle
and Total will have 25%. Upon completion of phase one operations, Total will transfer its share to Gazprom. The agreement also
provides for the possibility for other foreign partners to join the
project up to a 24% participating interest at the expense of Gazprom’s share.
Deliveries of pipeline gas are expected to start in 2013. First
LNG will be delivered in 2014.

PTTEP ﬁnds large gas deposit in Gulf of Martaban
Thailand’s PTT Exploration & Production PLC discovered a large
offshore natural gas deposit in Myanmar’s Gulf of Martaban, according to state media.
The New Light of Myanmar newspaper said PTT discovered a
deposit of gas estimated at 8 tcf. PTT confirmed the discovery but
declined to comment on the specific amount of gas in the reserve.
The appraisal well, Zawtika-5, reached a TD of 2,527 m and encountered seven zones of gas-bearing formation with a total thickness of 1001⁄2 m. It was the eighth well (four exploration and four
appraisal wells) drilled on that block, which lies 300 km south of
Yangon (OGJ Online, June 25, 2007).
PTTEP Pres. Maroot Mrigadat said the field shows promising
potential for further development, but added that a precise estimate of the reserves awaited additional exploration.

Drilling

&

US drilling activity hit a new 21-year high, up 39 rotary rigs
with 1,791 now working, Baker Hughes Inc. said July 13.
That surpasses the previous record of 1,775 set 2 weeks ago
and is up from 1,668 units drilling during this same period a year
ago.
All of the gain was on the land side, with a jump of 42 rigs to
1,693 active. Inland waters activity was unchanged at 22 rigs drilling. Offshore operations dropped 3 rotary rigs to 75 in the Gulf of
Mexico and 76 in federal waters as a whole.
Texas’ rig count jumped by 12 to 837 this week despite recent rains that caused flooding in some parts of the state. Colorado
increased by 4 to 112, and California was up 3 to 38. Louisiana
added 1 for a total of 182 rotary rigs working.

PTTEP plans to start production from the block, designated M9, next April. The field will likely be one of Thailand’s main sources
of gas, Mrigadat said.
PTTEP signed a production-sharing contract with Myanmar for
exploration and production of oil and gas from Block M-9 in November 2003.

OGDC taps gas, condensate in Pakistan well
Oil & Gas Development Co. Ltd. (OGDC) has made a natural gas
and condensate discovery with its Chandio-No. 1 well on Tando Allah Yar block in the Hyderabad district of Pakistan’s Sindh province.
The exploration effort is a joint venture of operator OGDC, with
95%, and Government Holdings (Pvt.) Ltd. (GHP) 5%.
Chandio No. 1, which was drilled to 3,660 m TD, targeted the
Massive, Basal, and A-Sands Cretaceous Age Lower Goru formation.
Based on drilling and electric log data, four zones were selected for
testing, and hydrocarbons were found in Zone-3 (Massive-Sands)
of the Lower Goru formation.
Initial short-duration testing produced 2.45 MMscfd of gas and
70 b/d of condensate at a wellhead flowing pressure of 540 psi
through a 32⁄64-in. choke.
Separately, Pakistan has granted an offshore exploration license
to GHP and has executed a production-sharing agreement with
GHP and OGDC for Block No. 2366-6 (Eastern Offshore Indus-A)
in the Arabian Sea.
The block covers 2,500 sq km. OGDC said it will invest $2.75
million during the first 2 years of the license’s initial term.

Sudan awards Red Sea PSC to China’s CNPC
China National Petroleum Corp. has signed a production-sharing contract with Sudan for exploration areas off northern Sudan.
Under the 20-year contract, CNPC will have exploration rights
to Block 13 with an area of about 3.8 million sq km in shallow
water on the Red Sea. The exploration period is 6 years.
CNPC will conduct exploration jointly with Sudan’s state-run
Sudapet Ltd. and Indonesia’s state oil and gas company PT Pertamina. ✦

Oklahoma, which also had heavy rains, was down 5 rigs to 186
drilling. New Mexico and Wyoming dropped 2 rigs each to respective counts of 85 and 69. Alaska was down 1 to 8.
Canada’s weekly rig count shot up by 74 to 360 units working.
That’s down from 571 during the same period last year, however.

Cavendish gas ﬁeld production starts off the UK
RWE Dea UK Development Ltd. has begun commercial gas production of 60 MMcfd from one well in Cavendish gas field on
Block 43/19a in the UK Southern Gas basin. The field lies in 18.5
m of water.

are drilling second and third wells that are expected to come on
stream before yearend. Cavendish, a Carboniferous gas field discovered in 1989, is RWE Dea’s first operated development project
in the UK.
The development consists of a 6-slot, minimum-facilities fixed
platform tied back to the Murdoch platform via 47 km of newly
laid pipeline. Murdoch is part of the Caister Murdoch system operated by ConocoPhillips, which transports the gas onward to the
Theddlethorpe gas terminal in the UK.
Cavendish field production originally was expected to start in
the first quarter with an initial flow of 100 MMcfd and to continue
until 2016 (OGJ Online, Nov. 26, 2006).

India proclaims ﬁrst coalbed methane sale
London concern Great Eastern Energy Corp. said it has made
India’s first sale of coalbed methane as compressed natural gas for
vehicles in Asansol, West Bengal, 125 miles northwest of Calcutta.
The company said it is receiving $13-15/Mcf for the gas.
Great Eastern has drilled 23 production wells and plans to drill
80 more in phases over 3 years. It holds a CBM license on 210 sq
km in the Raniganj coal field in West Bengal, where consulting
engineers estimated original gas in place at 1.92 tcf (see map, OGJ,
Dec. 13, 2004, p. 35).

Processing

Chevron to replace Tahiti spar’s mooring shackles
Chevron Corp. said it is pursuing “alternate actions” to ensure
new shackles are available “in the shortest time-frame possible” for
its Tahiti project in deepwater Gulf of Mexico, after a second round
of tests identified a metallurgical problem with the facility’s existing mooring shackles.
Several scenarios are being considered, but Chevron does not
yet have an “absolute clear picture” as to when the project will be
operational, a company spokesman said. The $3.5 billion project
190 miles south of New Orleans was scheduled for completion in
mid-2008.
Major components of the project are nearing completion, and
installation work is expected to continue once timing for the new
shackles is determined.
The company also has initiated an investigation to uncover why
initial tests failed to identify the problems with the shackles, the
spokesman said.
Additional tests were conducted after Chevron’s contractor discovered a metallurgical problem with shackles on a similar installation for another company. Metallurgical problems were subsequently discovered in the Tahiti shackles as well.
Chevron says the spar’s integrity is not impacted by the problem with the mooring shackles, as they are not part of the spar
hull. ✦

BP takes delivery of ‘world’s largest’ LNG carrier
BP Shipping has taken delivery in early July of the British Emerald LNG carrier, which the company called the “world’s largest”
with a capacity of 155,000 cu m. The vessel has an overall length
of 288 m and a width of 44.2 m.
British Emerald is powered by four diesel-electric engines and is
equipped with a bow thruster to assist in mooring operations. It’s
the first in a series of four diesel-electric gas ships.
Built by Hyundai Heavy Industries in South Korea, the vessel
was designed for reduced fuel costs and greenhouse gas emissions
compared with conventional LNG carriers. The dual-fuel technology allows the diesel engines to run on “boil-off” gases from the
cargo tanks or on conventional diesel fuel.
The 23-man crew will put the vessel through an extensive commissioning program that is scheduled to take 10 days.
This vessel is the first of a fleet of four Gem class LNG carriers.
The British Diamond, British Ruby, and British Sapphire are scheduled to be delivered in 2008.

Shell to buy Qatargas 4 output
A Royal Dutch Shell PLC affiliate signed an agreement with Qatar
Liquefied Gas Co. Ltd. (4) in Doha to buy effectively the entire output—7.8 million tonnes/year—of LNG from the Qatargas 4 project.
Shell will send the LNG to its Elba regasification terminal for
eastern US markets. Elba is being expanded to process 2.1 bcfd of
gas by mid-2010 under an $850 million investment plan.
The sales contract underpins the development of Qatargas 4
which brings Qatar closer to its 77 million tonne/year target of
becoming the world’s leader in LNG production.
First LNG cargoes from Qatargas 4 are expected at the end of
the decade, and the liquefaction complex will produce 1.4 bcfd
of gas, including an average 24,000 b/d of LPG and 46,000 b/d
of condensate from Qatar’s North Field over the 25-year life of
the project. The main engineering, procurement, and construction

contract for onshore facilities was awarded in December 2005 and
construction activities are progressing in Ras Laffan.
Linda Cook, Shell’s executive director of gas and power, said
the integrated project “is another clear illustration of our ‘more
upstream, profitable downstream’ strategy in action.” This is the
seventh LNG project in which Shell has an equity stake.
Qatar Petroleum (QP) and Shell incorporated Qatargas 4 as a
joint venture between an affiliate of QP (70%) and an affiliate of
Shell (30%). The JV will own the Qatargas 4 project’s onshore and
offshore assets.

Trans-Afghan gas pipeline back in play
Turkmenistan and Afghanistan have agreed to cooperate on several energy-related projects, including revival of the long-mooted
Trans-Afghan natural gas pipeline.
The two sides signed several agreements following talks between
Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov and Afghan
President Hamid Karzai, who visited Turkmenistan July 5-6.
Berdymukhammedov said his country remains interested in the
$2 billion project to build a gas line more than 1,460 km across Afghanistan to Pakistan and then to India. He said Turkmenistan would
be ready to send 30 billion cu m/year of gas through the line.
The original plan was to deliver gas from Turkmenistan’s Dauletabad field to Kandahar, Afghanistan; Multan in central Pakistan, and
onward to India (OGJ Oct. 28, 2002, p. 47).
The two leaders also agreed to construct additional electric
power lines and related infrastructure in Afghanistan. ✦

Land of misinformation
I found National Aeronautics and
Space Administration Administrator
Michael Griffin’s responses absolutely
on the mark (OGJ, June 11, 2007, p.
76). No one denies the world is heating up. It has been since the mini-ice
age of the 1400-1500 time period. I
believe it is part of natural cycles, and
in a few years temperatures will make
their cyclical turn downward. In about
2040-50, these same alarmists will make
the claim we are entering an ice age (as
in 1973). The ironic thing is that the
alarmists today will take credit for it and
will probably advocate releasing greenhouse gases to reverse the trends. If our
weather forecasting were nearly as good
as the modeling 100 years from now, we
actually could plan outdoor events.
As for ethanol, it’s interesting but
very predictable that some of the air
quality data is coming in, and much to
the surprise of everyone the air quality
is NOT improving but getting worse.
Gasoline performance is in the decline
as the poor gas mileage data trickles in.
It’s a terrible scamming of America, the
corn lobby and Archer Daniels Midland
have done. The funny thing will be is
that in about 5-10 years, the truth will
be known and all those corn-balls will
blame the oil companies.
We are pilgrims in a land of misinformation. I appreciate your efforts in
informing the masses or at least those
who read Oil & Gas Journal.

and less costly to build and operate.
It starts with biological conversion of H2S to hydrophilic sulfur, which
settles naturally without chemical wetting agents and virtually eliminates
plugging. This allows simpler, less costly process equipment and
requires fewer, less expensive chemical additives.
Which means your Shell-Paques system is easier to operate and
more reliable: 99+% availability in most cases. The naturally occurring
thiobacillus bacteria are self-sustaining and self-regulating.

And then there’s the biologically produced sulfur cake that is reclaimed
from the process. As a fertilizer, it breaks down quickly in soil, becoming
available to plants ten times faster than chemical sulfur.
Add it all together, and NATCO provides an unbeatable array of process
advantages for removal of H2S from gas. Let our industry leading gas

Second of three parts

More facts on antitrust
Two former officials of the US Federal Trade
Commission are trying to correct antitrust
misperceptions about the oil and gas industry. Last
week, this space summarized the first four points
presented in their monograph, “A Dozen Facts You
Should Know about the Oil Industry” (OGJ, July
16, 2007, p. 17). Four more appear this week.
The officials are Timothy J. Muris, who served
as chairman of the Federal Trade Commission in
the George W. Bush administration, and Richard
G. Parker, who was director of the FTC’s Bureau
of Competition in the Bill Clinton administration. They cochair the antitrust and competition
practice in the Washington, DC, office of the
O’Melveny & Myers LLP law firm, where Parker is
a partner and Muris is of counsel.
Their facts presented here last week: 1. Economic learning and antitrust enforcement have
evolved; we now know that big is no longer necessarily bad. 2. The antitrust authorities scrutinize
the petroleum industry more closely than any
other. 3. The American petroleum industry is not
highly concentrated. 4. Refiners have expanded
domestic and global capacity significantly.
The next four facts follow.
• Fact 5: Refineries operate at or near their practical maximum utilization rates.
Contrary to assertions that refiners limit operations to control supply and prices, US refineries
ran at about 93% of capacity during 1994-2004,
near maximum practical rates. Refiners have sustained high utilization rates while making modifications to comply with regulations, expanding
capacity, and enduring disruptions.
• Fact 6: Inventory practices have reduced costs and benefited
consumers.
At 2004 prices and volumes, inventory reductions between 1994 and 2004 reduced costs by
about $1.9 billion/year, 33% of current inventory
carrying and storage costs. Refiners achieved the
savings without sacrificing reliability of supply.
In a 2006 report to Congress, the FTC rejected the
assertion that oil companies had manipulated inventory levels to elevate prices during market disruptions.
It said inventories declined because maintaining them
is expensive and because reducing inventory costs is
an important goal of modern manufacturing.

• Fact 7:The profitability of the petroleum industry is commensurate with other industries over the long run.
Between 1992 and 2006, the US oil industry
invested more than $1.25 trillion in long-term energy initiatives, more than its net income of $900
billion. In 2006, new investment by the US oil
industry exceeded $174 billion, and the industry
plans $183 billion in new projects in 2007.
Between 1995 and 2005, the return on investment for refining was 10%, about 4.7% less than
returns of the S&P Industrials. During 19772005, oil industry returns averaged less than 7%,
compared with 9% for durable goods and more
than 11.5% for the S&P Industrials. From 2002 to
2006, earnings per dollar of sales equaled 6.4¢ for
all manufacturing industries and 7.4¢ for the oil
industry. For 2006, all manufacturing industries
averaged annual earnings of 8.2¢/$ of sales, while
the oil industry averaged 9.5¢.
• Fact 8:The FTC applies tougher standards to mergers in
the oil industry than to mergers elsewhere.
The agency applies the FTC-Department of
Justice (DOJ) Horizontal Merger Guidelines more
strictly to the oil industry than to others and requires divestitures in the petroleum industry at far
lower levels of concentration.
More than 60% of petroleum merger enforcement takes place in markets involving five or more
significant competitors, while substantially all
merger enforcement in other industries occurs
in markets with four or fewer competitors. Of all
merger enforcement actions at concentrations below a Herfindahl-Hirshman Index (HHI) of 1,800,
97% involved the oil industry. The HHI, indicating
concentration, can be as low as 0 (unconcentrated) or as high as 10,000 (monopolized). The oil
industry accounted for 77% of merger enforcement actions at concentration levels below 2,400.
Oil is the only industry in which the government
undertakes significant enforcement actions at or
below that level.
The average postmerger concentration level for
mergers requiring divestitures is much higher in
every other industry investigated by the government than for the petroleum industry. The FTC
challenged 21 oil mergers during 1981-2007.

Producers’ current investment decisions may be clouded by such questions
as the extent to which nonconventional
fuels may be produced and used in the
future and the effects those fuels may
have on oil demand, said the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
in the group’s 2007 World Oil Outlook.
OPEC’s report, released June 26,
contained what it called “inherent
downside risks” to demand that
included governmental, environmental, and conservation policies worldwide, questions about
the long-term sustainability of
biofuels production, and the
possibility of slowing economic
growth.
Although decisions and investment
must be made now for future capacity
expansions that require long lead-times
for planning, design, and construction,
some decisions may be problematic,
especially for downstream expansions.
Security of demand is shown to be
a real issue “intrinsically linked to the
issue of security of supply.”
The OPEC analysts said, “Without
the confidence that demand for its oil
will emerge, the incentive to undertake
investment can be reduced, which,
in turn, can exacerbate concerns over
eventual sufficiency of capacity, and
thereby hamper the drive towards longterm oil market stability.
“Alternatively, the emergence of
large levels of unused capacity would
lead to downward pressures upon oil
prices, as it has in the past,” they said,
adding, “This would result in a huge
loss of revenues, and OPEC member
countries, as developing countries

with keenly felt competing needs for
financial resources, would be adversely
affected in terms of available resources
in such areas as education, healthcare,
and infrastructure. Moreover, lower
revenues would, in turn, negatively
affect available resources for future
investment, with further subsequent
market instability—a distinct possibility.”
The report looks at the supply-demand balance and attempts to determine the specific need for future
investment in infrastructure and upstream-downstream capacity expansion
to 2030.
In its analysis, which the analysts
say is not a forecast, OPEC uses as its
reference case an average global economic growth rate of 3.5%/year, on a
purchasing power parity basis, and oil
prices assumed to remain in the $5060/bbl range for much of the period
through 2030.

Demand to rise
World population is expected to
grow by an average of 1%/year to
2030, reaching 8.2 billion, an increase
of more than 1.7 billion from 2005.
About 94% of this growth will come
from developing countries, with North
America the only OECD region set to
experience any significant expansion,

oil demand are both more resilient to
higher oil prices than had previously
been thought. All these trends, in addition to rising costs, have become integral to the general perception of higher
expected prices in the long-term.
Continuous downward revisions to
the demand projections from organizations such as the International Energy
Agency and the US Department of
Energy’s Energy Information Administration are also noted. In this regard, a
key question is whether this downward
revision process is set to continue. On
the supply side, there has been a steady
rise in expectations for non-OPEC production in the longer term. Increased
attention is being paid to nonconventional oil and biofuels and a discernibly
higher expected contribution to supply
is emerging, according to OPEC’s report.
There is much uncertainty over
future demand and non-OPEC supply,
which translates into large uncertainties over the amount of oil that OPEC
member countries eventually will need
to supply.
Because investment requirements are
large and subject to considerably long
lead-times and payback periods, it is essential to explore these uncertainties in
the context of alternative scenarios.
Downside risks to demand are
more substantial than upside potential.
24

Energy and environmental policies in
consuming countries and technological
developments are important drivers that
reduce demand, OPEC noted.
Uncertainties over future oil demand
translate into a wide range of possible
levels of necessary investment in OPEC
member countries. Even over the medium-term to 2010, there is an estimated
range of uncertainty of $50 billion for
required investment in the upstream,
increasing to $140 billion by 2015. This
is partly why security of demand is a
key concern for producers.

Downstream uncertainty
The expected increase in demand for
oil products means an increasing volume of oil will need refining. Because
the downstream sector is a key element
of the supply chain and ultimately,
market stability, it is important to focus
attention on refining. In addition to rising demand, there is a continued move
towards lighter and cleaner products. To
meet this type of demand, the downstream sector will require significant
investment to ensure that sufficient distillation capacity is in place, supported
by adequate conversion, desulfurization, and other secondary processes and
facilities, the OPEC analysts said.
The reference case for refining capacity expansion estimates that out of 14
million b/d of announced projects,

over 7 million b/d of new capacity will
be added to the refining system globally
by 2012 (Fig. 2). Almost 70% of the
new capacity will be in the Middle East
and Asia-Pacific. The global reference
case capacity additions from existing
projects could reach slightly more than
9 million b/d by 2015 when capacity creep is added to the mix. Capacity creep is the unannounced capacity
expansion through minor projects at
existing facilities. The average rate of
creep in the US in recent years has been
0.5-0.75%/year for crude units and
0.75-1.5%/year for upgrading units.
However, the additions could change
because of rising downstream sector
construction costs and difficulties in
finding skilled labor and experienced
professionals. This adds to the downside
risk in the reference case.
“This risk is further exacerbated by
the reluctance of refiners to expedite
the implementation of projects in light
of the rapidly changing policies that
put a strong emphasis on developing
alternative fuels that compete directly
with refined products,” OPEC reported.
“These issues play out in the alternative
‘cost-driven delayed’ scenario for short
and medium-term capacity expansion.”
In this scenario, the new distillation
capacity additions could be reduced to
as low as 8 million b/d through 2015,
“including assumed capacity creep.”
During the next 3 years, refinery
capacity expansion under the reference
case for refinery projects will just keep
pace with the required incremental refinery throughputs. The deficit is small,
but does not indicate any potential easing of refinery capacity and utilizations
in the shorter term. The “cost-driven
delayed” scenario for capacity additions
worsens the deficit.
Nevertheless, under the reference
case outlook for refinery projects, the
data indicates that capacity additions
should exceed requirements in 201112 as a range of new projects comes on
stream, easing refining tightness and
potentially, margins.
Under the “cost-driven delayed”
scenario, the excess additions relative

OPEC sees ﬂat demand for members’ crude in ‘08
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries expects demand for
its members’ crude oil to change little
next year as limits on global reﬁning
capacity continue to support oil prices.
In its July Monthly Oil Market
Report, OPEC projects a rise in global
oil demand next year of 1.34 million
b/d following an expected 1.25 million
b/d increase this year. Its projection for
average annual oil demand next year is
86.94 million b/d.
Most of the demand growth will occur in Asian countries other than those
that belong to the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development and the Middle East.
Among members of the OECD,
representing most of the industrialized
countries, demand growth will be conﬁned to a 300,000 b/d gain in the US.
OPEC’s demand forecast for 2008 assumes growth in global gross domestic product of 4.9%, fractionally below

to reference requirements are essentially eliminated. Moreover, if global oil
demand growth moves below reference
case levels, an easing in the refining sector could begin as early as 2008.
The uncertainties surrounding these
projections are especially relevant for
biofuels. In general, biofuels projects
do not take as long to implement as
refinery projects. The reference case
allows for a significant medium-term
increase in biofuels production. Any additional increase would further reduce
required refinery throughputs and
margins. Consequently, policy initiatives
supporting the development of biofuels
may discourage crude oil producers and
refiners from investing in needed capacity expansion.

the increase expected this year.
Depending on variables such as economic growth, weather, and response
to elevated product prices, the global
oil demand increase next year could be
as high as 1.45 million b/d or as low as
1.2 million b/d, OPEC says.
The exporters’ group sees an
increase in non-OPEC oil supply next
year of 1.01 million b/d to an average
of 51.42 million b/d.
The biggest regional non-OPEC
supply change will be an increase of
460,000 b/d from the Former Soviet
Union to an average of 13.08 million
b/d.
FSU increases by major country are
Russia, 180,000 b/d to 10.07 million
b/d; Azerbaijan, 180,000 b/d to 1.09 million b/d; and Kazakhstan, 100,000 b/d
to 1.48 million b/d.
OPEC expects nonmember oil
supply gains next year of 290,000 b/d
to 4.82 million b/d in Latin America,

ness in the downstream, and possibly
the upstream, and in turn, this could
have a significant impact on prices,
margins, and volatility,” OPEC said.
Biofuels also raises issues over the future structure of a complex downstream
business that includes both oil and biofuels. The question is how to structure it
to withstand major disruptions.
“With the increasing number of
biofuel producers, the chances of losing
this capacity for a longer period and
over a larger area, for example due to
drought, could easily lead to a shortage of required fuels,” OPEC reported.
Under these circumstances, the followup question is whether refiners should
hold sufficient spare capacity to cover
potential losses. OPEC member countries have offered, and will continue
Reﬁnery tightness

“Should such a situation be followed spare capacity for the benefit of the

2.812 million b/d in non-OECD Asia,
and 60,000 b/d to 2.86 million b/d in
Africa.
The group predicts that output of
NGLs and nonconventional oil by
its members will rise 410,000 b/d to
4.8 million b/d next year and expects
demand for its members’ crude to
average 30.7 million b/d, about this
year’s level.
OPEC expects global reﬁning capacity to increase by less than demand in
2008—1 million b/d with most of the
new capacity coming on stream late in
the year.
“Overall, the outlook for the oil
market in 2008 is shaping up to be
quite similar to the current year, with
continued tightness in the downstream
supporting high product prices and frequent reﬁnery outages exerting further
upward pressure, despite the healthy
crude oil market,” OPEC said.

stream at all times, which is primarily the responsibility of consuming
nations.
Based on the reference case assessment of known projects, by 2015 a total of almost 2 million b/d of additional distillation capacity will be required,
and by 2020, a further 3.7 million b/d.
“This is what is needed, on top of the
assessed likely capacity additions, to
bring the global refining system back
into long-run balance, with refining margins that allow for a return on
investment, but are not as tight as those
of today.”
OPEC said that, taking into account
the most likely changes in the future
supply and demand structures and
their quality specifications, “the global
downstream sector will require 13
million b/d of additional distillation
capacity in the 2006–20 period—about

The job was to get more energy from the seabed
and to use less energy doing it

The solution is now ready.

The Norwegian oil industry can celebrate another major advance.
The Tordis subsea production facility is ready for installation on this
North Sea field. Over the next 15-20 years, it will bring 35 million
extra barrels of oil to the surface while pumping water and sand
from the oil wells directly back into the bedrock – without an energyintensive detour via a surface platform or land base.
This new subsea installation accordingly opens the way to production
at greater water depths and in sea areas previously out of bounds
because of environmental considerations and technological constraints.

The solution will also cut development costs, making it profitable
to develop smaller discoveries and extend the producing life of existing
fields. The subsea solution for Tordis is the result of a close, trusting
and creative working relationship between operator Statoil, its
licence partners and its suppliers. Without this remarkable collaboration, the installation would have remained in the realms of fantasy.
But it is now a reality, and will play an important role in the company’s
future projects – both on the Norwegian Continental Shelf and
further afield.

Investing
in oil sands

D

epending on how you look at
it, an investment in Canada’s oil
sands could bring you untold wealth
or—depending on certain environmentalists—not.
First, the wealth. According to at
least one investment strategist we
know, oil sands may represent an
extremely worthwhile investment,
with numerous factors pointing to
long-term positive performance in
the sector.
These factors, one analyst tells us,
include technological progress, a safe
geopolitical situation, high levels of
investment, and rising profits.
Due to technological progress, we
are told, production costs of about
$20/bbl and an international oil
price of more than $40/bbl means
that the extraction of oil from oil
sands is now highly profitable.

industry is largely well-established and
already makes substantial profits,” she
said. Still, one might have to consider
other forces that could upset such an
investment—and one does not have
to factor in the political vagaries of an
Iran, Russia, or Ecuador. Nope. On this
one, the upset factor lies much closer
to home.

Opposed by environmentalists

According to recent reports, leading US environmentalists have taken
up space in Calgary due to the rising
economic importance of Canadian
oil sands as well as growing concern
about global warming. In fact, over the
past 6 months, US groups such as the
Natural Resources Defense Council,
the Sierra Club, and Environmental
Defense have stepped up their participation in Canada’s public meetings
and on regulatory matters.

increased a little because the refining
capacity is going up,” Arafa said. “It’s
really the capital expenditure numbers
that make the total numbers oscillate
up and down. Those are usually driven
by certain mandates or regulations, and
that is why they spike up.”
The US has experienced the equivalent of increased refining capacity of
one refinery every year for 10 years, he
said.
“Just to put it in perspective, the
refining industry has spent $50 billion in the last 10 years on cleaning the
environment. That $50 billion could
have built an extra 12 refineries, so it’s
significant spending,” Arafa said.
API’s data include survey responses
and federal statistics. The environmental
expenditures survey is sent to a sample
of the industry representing all large
and midsize companies along with a
randomly selected group of smaller
companies.
In 2005, 72 companies completed
the survey. ✦

member of the company’s bid commission, and for Petrobras employee Jose
Antonio Vilanueva.
Angraporto’s three main directors, Mauro Luiz Soares Zamprogno,
Wladimir Pereira Gomes, and Fernando
da Cunha Sterea all were arrested and
are being questioned in connection
with the allegations of corruption and
money laundering.
In addition, agents arrested Simon
Clayton, the executive director of TBS
International’s Brazilian affiliate TBS do
Brasil, who was linked to Angraporto,
described as being “at the heart” of the
irregularities.
Arrest warrants also were issued for
one of the shareholders in IESA’s shipyard, Valdir Lima Carneiro, as well as for
Paulo Jose Freitas de Oliveira and Antonio Carlos Vargas, who served respectively as the corporate and industrial
directors of the Maua Jurong yard.

The schemes worked by Petrobras
employees passing inside information
to Angraporto Offshore to fix bids in its
own favor, officials said. Angraporto was
created in July 2003 to take up administrative contracts with Petrobras, and
won three contracts, valued at $32 million, to refurbish and repair the three
oil platforms.
Angraporto oversaw refurbishment
of the P-10 oil platform, while IESA
and Maua Jurong allegedly worked with
Angraporto to promote fraud in the
bids involving the other two platforms,
the P-14 and P-16.
Brazil’s federal police are said to have
worked on the case with full support
from Petrobras. In a statement, the
Brazilian firm said: “At the request of
the prosecutor, Petrobras has not taken
any position so as not to prejudice
the investigations. The company has
suspended the employees from their

functions and installed a commission
to eliminate immediately any possible
irregularities.”
Altogether, Brazilian federal police
arrested 13 people following recent
calls for greater accountability by the
firm’s chief executive officer (OGJ Online, July 12, 2007). ✦

L O P M E N T

Computer Aided Lean Management
(CALM) uses software for the optimization of profitability under uncertainty.
CALM technologies add two kinds
of flexibility to traditional economic
analyses in order to better deal with uncertainties common to the oil industry
today.
The first is strategic flexibility, used
to dynamically manage portfolios of

real options analyses that demonstrate
the value of the flexibility that CALM
brings to strategic and operational
decision-making in ultradeepwater
development.
Our analyses suggest that additional
enterprise value going forward can be
created through the addition of a gasto-electricity option using a new kind
of offshore hub centered around floating generation, sequestration, and offloading (FGSO)
vessels and undersea high

The second is operational flexibility,

the production within fields in order to
maximize value extraction.

of new kinds of power delivery systems
to the market mix but from the modest initial investments needed to enable
the possible selection of options such
as FGSO hubs at a later date. The timing and volume of gas and oil streams
piped to shore are the only current
options available to ultradeepwater
operators.
What would be required to generate
such additional options of selling electricity generated by burning gas at new
offshore power hubs while sequestering CO2 back into reservoirs to enhance
production?
A similar paradigm change in
offshore production methodology has
been executed by the industry in the
recent past. When the need for more
diverse production and storage facilities
was required in ultradeep water off Brazil and West Africa, FPSO vessels were
invented. Today, more than 100 FPSOs
have been built to exploit this need for
additional flexibility at a cost of well
over $75 billion.1
Would it be profitable to build FGSO
vessels that use natural gas for power
generation onsite and offload electricity instead via undersea (HVDC) cables
connected to diverse electricity markets?
The vessels could also sequester CO2
and use it for enhanced oil recovery
(EOR) in the same reservoirs being
used to fuel the floating power plants.
The components exist to modify supertankers to contain modern, 1,200-Mw
gas turbine power plants, along with
AC/DC converters, and CO2 sequestration capabilities.
We estimate that the cost would be
about the same as FPSO vessels. One
thousand miles of HVDC cable to carry
the electricity to multiple shore locations could be laid with a traditional
marine cable-laying ship for an estimated capital investment of about $1
billion.
Fuel-efficient, aeroderivative gas turbines with proven reliability in marine
environments can be used to provide a
high-density power plant.
Modularization would be used to

provide enough mobility that components requiring overhaul could
be offloaded for repair onshore. This
modularity, combined with a modest amount of redundancy, has been
demonstrated to deliver close to 100%
availability in onshore gas turbine
power plants.
Redundancy in AC/DC converters
and HVDC cables can produce similar percentages of availability offshore
while providing real options for redeployment amongst newly emergent
markets, given the rerouting and splicing potential of flexible HVDC cable
laid onto the sea floor. A hub-and-spoke
design is envisaged for collecting the
gas for powering the FGSO generators.
CO2 would be captured and returned
to the gas fields for EOR sequestration
(Fig. 4).

Ultradeepwater economics

valuations, especially for forecasts that
are many years out. There are additional
tradeoffs from the exercising of real
options along the path to construction
and deployment that can enable larger
capabilities to profit when uncertainties
solidify in the future. In other words,
incremental investment in building the
capacity to profit from the real options
creates a dynamic plan with decision
gates that force ongoing evaluation of
capital investments.
There is always more certainty of the
payback at a later date from any plan
assembled today, and that advantage can
be used to create a valuable, real options
framework for any company. True, real
options for those investments must exist, of course.
We conducted our evaluation of gasto-electricity investment using the real
options analysis tool kit in a common
strategic planning tool used in the oil
industry called “Crystal Ball.”
Such real options are valid when

defer investments in order to wait and
see until more information becomes
available is the sum of the real option
value and the NPV of the asset with
cash discounted at the hurdle rate and
volatility estimated. If, over time, the
volatility decreases, then uncertainty
and risk are lowered and the real option
value decreases.
The cost-of-waiting is evaluated by
computing the dividend rate as a percentage of the asset value. The balance
between collecting more information
and the cost of waiting is continuously
recalculated so that the optimal strategic
value can be maintained all along the
way. The ability to wait, while simultaneously preparing all that is necessary
to execute, is worth several hundred
million dollars in the ultradeepwater
FGSO hub case study (Fig. 5).

CO2 sequestration
CO2 removal offers additional real
options of sequestration right at the
source of ultradeepwater production
to both enhance production through
CO2 flooding and profit from trading in
carbon credits.
There is significant environmental
upside from such real options. Given
the assumption that the value of CO2 sequestration would be high for the green
scenario, returns from this investment
are far above expected costs of capital to
make this option real.
Consider the value of carbon sequestration at the site of ultradeepwater
production should a carbon tax come
into existence.
In Table 1, we compare offshore EOR
using the CO2 captured by the FGSO
hubs with estimated costs for onshore
carbon sequestration from the International Panel for Climate Change, United
Nations, 2007. Injection at the source
of ultradeepwater production could add
a premium of $10-20/Mw-hr equivalent in our scenario, assuming that the
profit range is $3.50-4.50/ton of CO2
injected (current cost in West Texas).

Harvesting of arbitrage between gas
and electricity prices with positive or
negative spark spreads, the other two
quadrants of our scenario analysis, can
be assured via the use of CALM martingale controllers. Significant profits can
be assured by marketing a flexible mix
over selling either gas or electricity in
these highly variable price quadrants.

approved, Gorgan may start shipping
LNG after 2010.
The Sunrise and Troubadour field
projects off East Timor and Australia are
on hold awaiting ratification of treaties
between the two countries. The projects
would involve development of about 8
tcf of gas that an expansion of the Bayu
Udan LNG plant would process.

Ichthys is a large 9.5-tcf deepwater gas and condensate project off
northwest Australia that may include
a semisubmersible production with a
flowline to shore connected to a new
LNG liquefaction plant.
In Indonesia, several new fields will
supply gas to existing and new LNG
plants and power stations. The largest

new LNG project is Tangguh, which will
come on stream in 2009 and process
gas from new fields in Papua Bintuni
Bay.
Indonesia also has several oil developments. Banyu Urip field in the Cepu
block on Java is the largest oil field
discovered in Indonesia in many years.
The field will go on stream after 2010,
exporting oil from a floating storage
vessel moored off Tuban in the Java Sea.
Another large project in Indonesia
is the planned development of 40 tcf
of gas in Natuna D-Alpha field, discovered several decades ago. Development was delayed partly because of the
high carbon dioxide content of the gas
that complicates production facilities.
ExxonMobil Corp. and the government
of Indonesia are in discussions related
to the terms for proceeding with the
project.
India has both onshore oil and gas
discoveries as well as large, deepwater
12-tcf discoveries off the country’s
eastern coast. The offshore gas possibly
will be produced through subsea-completed wells brought to shore with long
flowlines.
Several new projects will develop
additional fields off China in both the
South China Sea and Bohai Bay.
The Kikeh projects off Sarawak will
be Malaysia’s first deepwater project to
start producing. Operator Murphy Oil
Corp. expects first oil from the project
in second-half 2007.
Gas production is slated to begin
from an onshore field in Bangladesh
and fields off Myanmar.
Development of gas fields in the
Southern Highlands of Papua New
Guinea has encountered some delay
after plans to lay a 3,000-km pipeline
to Queensland, Australia, were dropped.
Development of this gas may now include construction of an LNG liquefaction plant.

LNG production will start later in the
year.
Ormen Lange is the other large project that will come on stream in 2007.
The produced gas, condensate, and water stream from subsea-completed wells
will flow to shore through two 30 in.,
120-km flowlines. First gas is expected
in October 2007.
Norway also has numerous projects
that will tie back subsea-completed
wells to existing offshore facilities.
In Italy, the onshore Tempa Rossa
project will develop an estimated 200
million bbl of heavy oil reserves.

Eastern Europe, FSU
Phased development of Tengiz field
continues with the $6-billion second
generation plant and sour-injection
projects.Plans call for the projects
starting up in 2007 and increasing
crude production capacity in 2008 to
460,000-550,000 b/d from the cur-

offshore South Pars gas field, an extension of Qatar’s giant North field.
Iraq has considerable potential in
adding oil production capacity, although the agreements for developing
its resources have not been finalized.
Table 1 lists some of the potential fields
that might be developed. One project that is proceeding is DNO ASA’s
development of the Tawke field in the
Kurdish area of Iraq near the border
with Turkey.
Kuwait is continuing to redevelop
several fields that will increase its production capacity by 450,000 bo/d in
2012.
In Oman, a steamflood will develop
the estimated 1 billion bbl of heavy-oil
resources in the Mukhaizna field.

Also in Kazakhstan, the first phase
of the 13-billion-bbl Kashagan field
should start producing in 2010.
New pipeline projects in Russia
will allow production of several of its
stranded gas fields, with the 120-tcf
Shtockman field in the Barents Sea
being the largest. The first phase of
Shtockman field may start producing
gas in 2011 at a rate 2.1 bcfd. Subsequent phases may increase production
to 8.7 bcfd in 2014-19.
Another large field under development is the 70-tcf Kovykta in eastern
Russia. Gazprom has recently become
operator of the field that will require
new pipelines for moving the gas to
potential users, such as in China.

Special Report

Western Hemisphere
The main operator off Brazil remains
Petrobras, although several new projects
will have other operators.
Petrobras continues the phased
development of several giant fields in
the Campos basin with subsea completed wells tied into floating production systems. The company also
plans to develop large new gas and
oil projects in the Santos and Espirito
Santo basins.
In the next few years, units of El Paso
Corp., Chevron Corp., Norsk Hydro
ASA, and Devon Energy Corp. will join
Shell Group as the only other companies, besides Petrobras, producing off
Brazil.
If peak production occurred at the
same time for all listed bitumen projects in Canada, Canada’s production
capacity would increase by 4.9 million
b/d. These projects, however, are phased
in and forecasts say that they will add
about 2 million b/d by 2016 to the
current 1.2 million b/d produced from
the vast oil sands region in Alberta.
Methods for recovering the bitumen
include mining and steam injection,
such as steam-assisted gravity drainage
(SAGD) or steam-and-soak methods.
Operators and the Canadian government have not reached a final agreement regarding the proposed $6-billion (Can.), 760-mile McKenzie Delta
pipeline that would allow for producing
the large stranded gas resources in the
Northwest Territories. But negotiations
still continue and some expect first gas
to flow sometime after 2014.
BP continues developing new fields
in its hub and spoke Cannonball project
that provides gas for Atlantic LNG Train
4 in Trinidad. The fields have standardized normally unmanned platforms.
The Red Mango platform is one of
BP’s projects. Wells on the platform will
produce a field discovered in 2000,
and the produced gas will flow to the
Cassia B hub. Wells on another platform,
Cashima, will produce gas from both
Cashima field, discovered in 2001, and

will flow to the Amherstia hub.
Mexico has plans for boosting
recovery through injection of nitrogen
in several fields, including the onshore
Jujo-Tecominacan field.
In Peru, further development of
Camisea gas field includes construction
of an LNG plant. Another project in
Peru will redevelop an offshore gas field
and deliver the gas to an onshore power
plant.
The US Gulf of Mexico has many
deepwater discoveries that will add
substantial amounts on new production capacity. These projects include
installation of semisubmersible production units, spars, tension-leg platforms
(TLPs), and tie-backs of subsea completed wells.
The US Minerals Management Service (MMS) forecasts that oil production from the gulf may increase to 2.1
million b/d in 2016 from the 1.25
million b/d produced in 2006. Gas
production may be 9.5 bcfd in 2016
compared with the 7.95 bcfd produced
in 2006, according to the MMS forecast.
In 2007, the Independence Hub is
slated to become operational. The hub
will handle gas produced from 10 fields
completed with subsea wells, some of
which are in water deeper than 8,000
ft. The development has a designed
production capacity of 1 bcfd.
Operators and the government of
Alaska have not reached agreement on
the construction of a $20 billion Alaska
gas pipeline that would allow production of an estimated 40 tcf of gas currently stranded on the North Slope.
If an agreement is reached, gas may
start flowing after 2012.
Technological advances in the US
as well as higher gas prices have made
many tight gas, shale gas, and coalbed
gas developments feasible, such as the
Piceance tight-gas projects in Colorado.
Venezuela has several large gas and
heavy oil development projects planned,
although recent actions by the Venezuelan government may cause a delay in
their completion. ✦

DRILLING MARKET FOCUS

Coiled tubing market grows steadily, attracts new players
Nina M.Rach
Drilling Editor
Coiled tubing is one
of the fastest growing
Drilling
oilfield technologies. CT
services expanded 140%
over 2001-06, second only to directional
drilling, according to Colorado-based
Spears & Assoc. Inc. (Table 1).1
Spears publishes an annual oil field
market report that covers 33 market
segments, among which are CT services, oil country tubular goods (OCTG),
and unit manufacturing (includes CT).
Operators worldwide employ versatile coiled tubing; it plays many roles in
drilling, well stimulation, completion,
and workovers. It’s also used for velocity and production strings, to convey
logging tools, and for other special
applications.
The CT market broadly includes
equipment manufacturing, tubing
string production, and CT services, including drilling. Coiled-tubing drilling
(CTD) comprises only about 15% of
the CT services industry but is growing

and the cycling charges on the CT
string (about $1.75/m, totaling $12,000 (Can.)/day, depending on CT
size, well depth, etc.). Cycling charges
are generally only levied on forward
progress, not on round trips.
There were about 75 CTD rigs in
Canada in 2006, comprising about 20%
of the total fleet of CT units. This is high
compared with the US, which had only
about 11 CTD units, 4% of the total US
CT fleet, according to ICoTA.

Made in USA, Canada
The two largest manufacturers of
coiled tubing rigs are both based in
Texas: HydraRig, a division of National
Oilwell Varco, and Stewart & Stevenson.
HydraRig, based in Fort Worth, is the
world’s leading manufacturer of coiledtubing equipment, supplying both parts
and complete units. Graves told OGJ
that HydraRig has built 700 complete
units and shipped the 1,000th injector
head from its plant in May 2007. The
National Oilwell Varco companies combined have built more than 900 units.
HydraRig has expanded to 320 staff
from about 120 in 5 years. It provides
CT units to all the major oil field service companies (Fig. 3). The company
moved to a new Fort Worth facility in
2004, in order to expand and build
more component pieces in house, gaining better control of delivery times,
Graves said.
About 75% of the company’s CT
units are built in Texas, 15% in Calgary and Nisku, Alta., and 10% in the
UK. Complete units require about 15
months to build to order at the Fort
Worth plant, but there is less of a backlog in Canada.
Most of HydraRig’s customers order
trailer-mounted rigs, except for Russia
and India. A typical Russian rig will run
3,500 m of 13⁄4-in. tubing. Customer
Surgut Neftegaz has about 45 HydraRig
units and recently ordered 12 units (6
CT, 6 fluid pumper) for north-central
Siberia for $17.5 million.
HydraRig has sent about 30 truckmounted units to China. A typical rig

destined for China will have a reel with
15,000 ft of 11⁄2-in. tubing.
But Graves said many of his new
CT units are staying in North America,
where the industry is “hot,” with about
40 units in Barnett field alone (Fig. 4).
Houston-based Stewart & Stevenson
has designed and built CT equipment
since 1990, with more than 300 units
in the field to date. The company offers
land and offshore CT units, as well as
hybrid CTD units with either hydraulic
or AC power; derricks up to 400,000-lb
capacity; injector heads up to 200,000lb capacity; and single or multitrailer
configurations.
About half of the company’s CT units
stay in North America; others are sent
to South America, Russia, Middle East,
China, and North Africa.
Stewart & Stevenson acquired privately-held Crown Energy Technologies
in February 2007. The Calgary-based
company, with 1,100 employees in
Canada and the US, builds CT masted
units for hydraulic fracture (frac) work.
Stewart & Stevenson’s Chad Joost told
OGJ the Crown acquisition brought
complimentary business in stimulation
and workover equipment, as well as an
entry to the Canadian market.

Texas also hosts the two main manufacturers of CT tubulars, which equally
share the global market: Quality Tubing

Coiled Tubes, which acquired Precision
Tubes as part of its $3.2 billion purchase of Missouri-based Maverick Tube

Quality Tubing (QT) was founded in
1976 and purchased by Varco International in 2001. It increased its production capacity by 60% in 2006, including a new tube mill line and two new
tube-mill entry lines.
QT says it can produce coiled tubing
strings up to 26,000 ft long without a
single girth (butt) weld. The company
has four basic tubing grades: QT-700,
QT-800, QT-1,000, and QT-1,200,
ranging from 70,000-120,000 psi
minimum yield strength, as well as QT900 for sour service; QT-16Cr for wet
CO2 work; and H0-70 for permanent
tubing installations.
Global steelmaker Tenaris SA, through
subsidiary Tenaris Coiled Tubes, has two
coiled-tubing manufacturing facilities
in Houston, for downhole (drilling and
well service) and subsea (pipelines and
umbilicals associated with deepwater
trees). Tenaris has four downhole-tubing
grades (70, 80, 90, 110), with 1 to 5-in.
OD, and 0.08-0.30-in. WT. (OGJ, June
25, 2007, p. 45). Dennis Dunlap, managing director of Tenaris Coiled Tubes, said
the company uses coiled strip stock from
France.
A new player is about to enter CT
manufacturing. Global Tubing LLC announced last month that it would build
a coiled-tubing manufacturing plant in
Dayton, Tex.4 Global Tubing President
and owner Jon Dubois, who founded
Quality Tubing 31 years ago, said the
new company would export “to China,
to Russia, and to the rest of the world.”

ASEP has two new developments:
an 8 by 8 all-wheel-drive coil truck,
and a four-chain CT injector head. The
“QuadHead” has 80,000-lb pull capacity, stands about half as tall as a standard,
two-chain injector head, and is potentially stackable, ASEP’s Keith Henderson
told OGJ. The grippers can accommodate tubulars to 41⁄2-in. diameter, and
two stacked units could potentially be
used for jointed pipe. The new injector sells for about 30% premium over
standard heads, and the first unit was
just purchased by PSL.

most. Larger companies have more; for
example, Gazprom owns 30 units and
Surgutneftegaz owns 27.
CJSC FIDmash was established
in 2001 in Minsk, Belarus, and was
acquired by National Oilwell Varco in
December 2005.7
NOV Fidmash says its strategic aim
is to provide equipment to Russia, CIS
countries, Eastern Europe, Central Asia,
and the Middle East. The company has
supplied CT equipment to Schlumberger, BJ Services, Gazprom, Rosneft, SurgutNeftegas, Tatneft, Bashneft, Ukrneft,
Ukrgazodobicha, and others.
Graves told OGJ that FIDmash had
built about 50 CT units for the Russian
market. Some NOV Fidmash CT units
include HydraRig injectors and Texas
Oil Tool BOPs. Unit output doubled in
2006 from the previous year and he
expects it to double again in 2007.
A smaller Russian company, PervoMayskHimmash, produces light-duty
CT units. Two Russian operators mentioned purchases. Vladimir Dmitruk, of
gas producer Nadymgazprom, said his
company uses CT for 37% of its well
repairs (about 18/year). It bought a
CT unit built by Rebound Rig Co. Ltd.
in 1994, a Belarus-made M10 from
FIDmash in 2005, and plans to buy a
URAN-20.1 from PervoMayskHimmash
this year.8
Nikolai Rakhimov, chief engineer
at Urengoigazprom, said the company
uses CT equipment for about half of the
90-120 well repairs it performs each
year in the Urengoi oil-gas-condensate
field. The company has purchased CT
units from FIDmash and PervoMayskHimmash.8
Tatneft has CT units built by HydraRig, Stewart & Stevenson, and
FIDmash.8 Orenburggazprom bought a
single M-20 unit built by FIDmash in
2002, for work in Orenburg oil-gascondensate field.

According to Steve Robertson, oil
and gas manager at Douglas-Westwood
Ltd., the Russian oil field services industry is set to double in value over the
next 5 years.5 Russian companies are
looking to the West and beginning to
adopt western business models.
One example is the reactivation and
planned upgrade of a coiled-tubing
manufacturing plant in Chelyabinsk,
Russia. Sergey A. Gouskov is the principal at JSC UralTrubMash (UTBM),
which has made CT in the past and is
currently retooling for a push into the
market. UTBM produces CT with 20-57
mm ID, in strings as long as 4,500 m.6
Earlier this year, Leonid Gruzdilovich, president of the FID Group, said
FIDmash has produced four generations

Molchanov acknowledged that
“CT drilling is still considered in this
country a rather exotic process” but
that SurgutNeftegaz is drilling with CT

Coiled tubing is nearly recessionproof, Ronald Clarke said. When drilling
is down, workover activity increases;
when drilling is up, CT units are either
engaged in drilling or well completions.
Upside: CT companies often show
EBIDTA (earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, and amortization) of 40%
or more. Downside: coiled tubing is
becoming a commoditized product.
Regardless, the market seems likely
to continue to expand at least 10-15%/

Alkanolamines are
used widely in gas treating plants. Because acidgas removal from natural
gas requires regeneration of alkanolamines,
the energy requirement
for the stripping section
(condenser and reboiler) will be much
greater when the inlet sour gas contains

Natural gas sweetening

Natural gas, one of the most important energy sources, contains light
hydrocarbons (predominantly methane) and some contaminants. From
these contaminants, hydrogen sulfide
and carbon dioxide should be removed
because of health and environmental
problems and to lower transmission
costs.
Several sweetening technologies exist. Among these, alkanolamines are the
most widely used solvents for absorbing
a high concentration of acid gases.

the 1930s.

Modiﬁcations
Some modifications can improve the
operating conditions and enhancement
in gas treating.
All of these modifications fall into
four configurations:
• Adding a precontactor in the path
of sour gas.
• Using multiple feed points in the
absorber.
• Using a split-flow configuration in
which semilean amine is fed to some
midpoints of the absorber while ultralean amine is fed at the top (Fig. 2).
• Installing pressure-swing regeneration instead of reboiling.
All of these modifications have
advantages and drawbacks. Gas treating
with split-flow has a greatly reduced
energy use in the plant. In the conventional process, all amine leaving the
contactor is regenerated; in the splitflow process, some solvent is withdrawn from the regenerator (partially
stripped) and enters the midpoint of

This means that the bulk of absorption is a compulsory condition of using

the total amine flow rate, but because
the stream from the regenerator has
a lower amine composition, the total
circulation rate is greater than before.
If the processor decides to treat
sour gas with the split-flow process,
a calculation algorithm based on the

conventional procedure can be used to
calculate the required lean and semilean
amine flow rates.

lean amine rate at about 790 cu m/hr.
The stripper and condenser duties were
about 90 Mw and 47.7 Mw, respectively.
In the split-flow process, these duties are reduced to 54.5Mw and 8.6
Mw with lean and semilean flow rates
of 390 cu m/hr and 507 cu m/hr,
respectively. Due to the higher solvent
rates for the split-flow case, a larger unit

The main concept in split-flow is
that most of the acid gases are removed from sour gas in the contactor’s
lower section. Because absorption with
amines is an exothermic reaction, the
temperature of liquid across the column
increases when flowing down through
the trays.
Fig. 4 shows a typical temperature
profile across the column.
The temperature profile, however, is
an unsuitable way to monitor absorption effectiveness. A parameter is needed to show the amount of absorption in
the tower. This parameter can be more
useful if it is independent from the feed
composition and rate, amine rate, and
type of amine and composition.
We propose using a parameter called
the residual factor, defined as the difference between the vapor composition of
the gas leaving each stage and sweet gas
divided by the difference between sour
and sweet gases compositions:

For a specific case, we simulated the
conventional and semisplit flow. At a
semilean flow rate of zero (conven-

Where y1 is the composition of a
specified component in the sweet gas,
ym is the composition of a specified
component in gas leaving stage m,
yn+1 is the composition of a specified
component in the sour gas, and n is the
number of stages in tower.
This factor varies between 0 and 1; it
is 0 at the top and 1 at the bottom.
We simulated and studied 16 different cases to obtain a general trend
or algorithm. In these cases, different feed rates, compositions, and

simulation; this is common in the
gas-treating industry. Table 1 shows

the cases that we simulated.
We calculated removal efficiencies
for each component (H2S and CO2) in
each stage with the Amsim software using a rate-based method.
Figs. 5 and 6 show H2S and CO2
composition profiles and residual factors for selected cases.
Most H2S absorption curves behave
similarly and normally, which we call
“normal” cases. Some of them deviate
from normal behavior, which we refer
to as “abnormal” cases.
In normal cases, most absorption occurs in the absorber’s lower section. The
gas temperature and acid-gas composition rise and fall rapidly, respectively.
In the abnormal cases (Cases 6, 8, and
14), however, there is a noticeable
deviation in H2S absorption. After careful observation, we found that in these
cases, absorption of CO2 controls the
amine circulation rate. In other words,
the total rate of required amine to absorb the CO2 is greater than the rate of
required amine for H2S removal.
Fig. 6 shows that some of the curves
change gradually due to the same reason. Our calculation procedure, therefore, is based on the assumption that
most absorption occurs in the column’s
lower section. The procedure’s first assumption, however, is that H2S should
control the amine rate.
When CO2 controls the amine rate,
however, the procedure requires some
revisions and extra attention. One must
check the composition profile to see
if most absorption is obtainable in the
lower section. The residual factor is an
excellent tool for this purpose. Then,
the entire calculation sequence should
be performed exactly the same as that
of H2S.
Fig. 7 shows the procedure to evaluate the possibility of applying the splitflow process.

This procedure shows how to calculate amine rates for H2S and CO2 (Fig.

Table 2 shows the conditions for
three case studies and Table 3 shows the
results of the three case studies.
The calculation method shows good
agreement with plant data.
Determination of the lean amine rate
for conventional amine treating plant
is well known and straightforward. For
split-flow gas treating, however, calculations of lean and semilean stream rates
are complex.
This method eliminates the complex
computations that have been done in
the past for simple absorptions.6 7 Some
simple assumptions prevent tedious
calculations. This procedure is appropriate and applicable to estimate amine
solvents at the design stage of the plant
or during optimization procedure. It
can also be used to determine lean and
semilean streams rate for an operating
plant. ✦

Development of
China’s strategic oil
reserve system depends
largely on the mindset of
its decision makers.
Conservative, securityStorage
driven thinking will lead
to higher costs for the government and
more stress on the global oil market.
A more open-minded approach, by
contrast, could allow an
efficient and comparatively inexpensive build
of reserves.
This article will examine the strategic petroleum reserve strategies
used by the US, Japan,
and South Korea, in an effort to determine the optimum course for development of China’s reserves.

this practice. The rule itself is unclear,
although the Chinese government
promises to clarify how the SPR sites
and crude should be used when the full
legislature governing SPRs is completed.

Existing models
The US, Japan, and South Korea are
the three consuming countries that have
so far instituted SPRs.
• US. The US government operates
the largest and most efficient public petroleum stockpile in the world. The US
established its SPR in 1975 under the
Energy Policy and Conservation Act in
response to the 1970s oil embargo. As
of Mar. 2, 2007, the US SPR held 688.6
million bbl of oil at four storage sites in
Texas and Louisiana.
The presence of salt domes along the
US gulf coast allows for large, cheap,
and efficient oil storage, rapid drawdown, and minimal maintenance costs
compared with other modes of storage.
The US Department of Energy operates the SPR and fills it via a royalty-inkind program devised by the Clinton
administration in 1999. Through this
program, the DOE’s Minerals Management Service collects royalties as oil
from companies operating government
offshore leases in the Gulf of Mexico,
and uses this oil to fill the SPRs. Prior
to 1999, MMS collected these royalties
in cash.
When President George W. Bush was
inaugurated in 2001, the SPR held just
under 600 million bbl of oil. Following
the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001,
President Bush instructed the DOE to fill
the SPR to 700 million bbl, close to its
capacity of roughly 730 million bbl.
The comprehensive energy bill
passed by the US Congress in July 2005
calls for expansion of the SPR to 1
billion bbl, as long as purchases of oil
for the reserves do not raise oil or oil
product prices.
As the world’s leading importer of
oil (13.5 million b/d in 2005)2 and
dominant global economic and military
power, the US governs its oil stockpiles
conservatively. Government policy
dictates that oil from the reserve can be
82

released only by order of the president
and in case of a disruption to oil supply.
Only two emergency drawdowns of
the US SPR have occurred; one in 1991,
the other in 2005. In January 1991, in
response to oil market anxiety created
by the Gulf War, the mere announcement of President Bush’s plans to release oil brought a measure of stability
to the market.
The second emergency drawdown
occurred after Hurricane Katrina caused
massive damage to oil production facilities, terminals, pipelines, and refineries
along coastal regions of Mississippi and
Louisiana in late August 2005, causing
gasoline prices to spike. In September
2005, through a coordinated action
with the IEA, President Bush ordered
the drawdown and sale of 30 million
bbl of crude oil from the SPR to US
markets. The IEA, which serves as the
main supranational entity coordinating
energy information and policy among
developed countries, mandated a drawdown correlated with the US release.3
Any other US SPR releases have been
limited to test sales and exchange arrangements with private companies.
• Japan. Japan’s model is the most
expensive and comprehensive system
of strategic oil stockpiling in the world.
Japan imports more oil than any other
country besides the US. Unlike the US
and China, however, Japan produces no
domestic oil.
Japan has divided its system of
petroleum stockpiling into two sets of
reserves: public and private. Roughly
320 million bbl of crude, managed by
the Japan Oil, Gas, and Metals National
Corp. under the Ministry of Economy,
Trade, and Industry, comprise the government-managed strategic petroleum
reserve.
Ideas and guidelines that govern
these stockpiles are similar to those
applied to the US SPR, but Japan has no
salt caverns and has therefore needed
to invest heavily in other methods of
storing oil.
JOGMEC provides information on 10
national stockpiling bases accounting

for roughly 215 million bbl of oil. This
includes 112 million bbl in aboveground tanks, 51 million bbl in floating
tanks, 30 million bbl in rock caverns,
and 22 million bbl in underground
tanks.
Aboveground tanks and rock cavern
storage both represent financially appealing alternatives to salt caverns. Underground and floating tanks are much
more expensive but demonstrate Japan’s
efforts to protect its reserves from natural disasters such as earthquakes and
typhoons.
The second part of Japan’s strategic
stockpile consists of government-mandated private storage. Private Japanese
oil companies and importers of refined
products must maintain stocks equivalent to 70 days’ consumption. According to JOGMEC, private stocks amount
to nearly 275 million bbl of oil, or 82
days’ forward cover. Crude oil comprises about half the private stocks, with oil
products making up the balance.4
The stockpiling requirement is subsidized by the Japanese government but
still constitutes a significant burden on
Japanese oil companies and a large barrier to entry into the Japanese market.
The Japanese government’s drawdown policy is more rigid than that of
the US. Japan’s nearly 600 million bbl
of oil is the only reserve in the world
that approaches the size of US SPR.
Japan consumes less than a fourth and
imports less than half as much oil as the
US. Therefore, Japan’s system provides
extensive protection against supply disruption, but at a very high cost.
In marked contrast to China and the
US, Japan’s oil demand is shrinking,
improving the strength of its reserves.
After a recent internal evaluation of
its stockpiling practices, Japan plans
to increase the strength, flexibility,
and readiness of its reserves, including reducing private companies’ stock
requirements to 60 or 65 days.
• South Korea. The South Korean
strategic stockpiling model differs from
the rigid approaches of Japan and the
United States. Under government auspices, Korean National Oil Co. mainOil & Gas Journal / July 23, 2007

tains about 63 million bbl of crude oil,
7.3 million bbl of petroleum products,
and 3.6 million bbl of LPG. KNOC
stores about 80% of these stocks in rock
caverns, with aboveground tanks housing the remainder.
KNOC plans to increase the public
stockpile to 140 million bbl by 2008.
Current stockpiling locations have 114
million bbl in capacity. 4
Private Korean oil companies must
maintain 40 days of forward coverage
for domestic sales, equal to roughly 72
million bbl of oil.
KNOC manages Korea’s public oil
stockpiles with flexibility in an effort to
recoup some of the expense associated
with building and maintaining stocks.
The company occasionally conducts
time swaps, which entail taking advantage of fluctuating oil prices by lending
oil from national stockpiles. Korean
refiners (and sometimes international
oil purchasers) are invited to bid on
a quantity of stockpiled oil. The winning bidder must return the oil within
a stipulated period to pay the premium
bid.
The practice is intended simultaneously to allow KNOC to offset costs,
keep its reserves in circulation, and
maintain a balance of stocks that reflect
the present state of Korean consumption but fall short of acting as a revenue
stream for the company.
KNOC also rents its spare storage capacity to foreign oil companies.
Statoil stores more than 11 million bbl
in KNOC’s facilities as part of its Joint
Oil Stockpiling program. KNOC developed this program to allow continued
growth of oil stocks following the Asian
financial crisis of 1998. The program
provides moderate revenue in the form
of rental fees and dictates that in the
event of a supply crisis, Korea would
enjoy a preferred right to purchase
Statoil’s stored stocks at market prices.
KNOC spends the money saved or
earned from joint oil stockpiling and
time swaps on expanding its reserve
and occasionally comes under criticism
for the cost-offsetting measures it employs in its stockpiling strategy. KNOC’s

demand for years to come.
In order to keep up with increasing demand, China should expand its
government reserves to maintain at least
50 days of forward cover, market conditions permitting. At current price levels,
however, the per-barrel cost of these
stocks will far exceed money spent in
the past by Japan, South Korea, and the
US in the development of their reserves.
Building reserves as expansive and
inflexible as in Japan or the US could be
too costly. China should instead invest
in a comfortable cushion of government stocks and augment them with
more innovative measures.
The unique relationship between the
Chinese government and its major oil
companies could play to China’s advantage in developing reserves. The US and

share their government’s interest in
protecting the domestic economy.
China, however, could take advantage
of existing commercial storage capacity
by requiring its state-run oil importers
to hold 40 days of forward cover in a
mix of crude oil and refined products,
thereby achieving the goal of the IEAmandated 90 days cover. These reserves,
already in the hands of distributors,
would serve as China’s first line of
defense.
The Strategic Oil Stockpiles Office
also could exercise flexibility in managing such “private” stocks, imitating
KNOC by permitting companies to
swap oil and to take advantage of seasonal price fluctuations.
Alternative stockpiling strategies
could help complement China’s reserves. The Korean Joint Oil Stockpiling
program is one example. The possibility
of reaching agreements with producers to store their oil in China for release
under certain predefined tight supply
scenarios would be another. ✦

Three new technologies for onshore, offshore operations
Three new technologies are available
that complement WesternGeco Q-Technology services: WesternGeco DSC dynamic
spread control for offshore surveys and the
new Desert Explorer DX-80 vibroseis unit
and MD Sweep for onshore operations.
DSC dynamic spread control is a new
automated vessel, source, and streamer
steering technology. It enables repeatability for 4D time-lapse studies and helps
increase accuracy in Q enabled over-under and rich and wide azimuth surveys,
the firm says. The Q-Marine technology
platform, consisting of steerable streamers,
single-sensor acquisition, dense acoustic
positioning network, and calibrated marine sources, continues to evolve with the
addition of the DSC system.
The Desert Explorer DX-80 vibroseis unit has been specifically developed
to complement the Q-Land integrated
acquisition and processing system. This
vibroseis unit generates an 80,000 lb peak

hydraulic force with low distortion across
a broad bandwidth.
The new MD Sweep design methodology enables a vibrator to produce more

Beer price hikes
will underscore
US energy folly
Because Americans are awakening to
folly, House Republicans should be careful
how they criticize their Democratic colleagues about energy.
Republicans complained to reporters on
July 11 that Democrats have been too slow
to act on the subject.
“They failed to produce a comprehensive plan in the ﬁrst 6 months of the year,”
growled House Republican Chairman Adam

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

Putnam of Florida (OGJ Online, July 12,
2007).
Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee went on
to assert that “the public expects us to address our rising energy costs, but this [the
Democratic] bill does none of that.”
Whoa. Comprehensive plan? Congressional solutions to rising energy costs?
Such meddling by government creates
problems. Republicans should be calling
for less of it.
The Energy Policy Act of 2005, passed
while Republicans controlled Congress, is
an example.
While opening little of the vast federal
acreage that the US ludicrously excludes
from oil and gas development, the comprehensive law addressed rising energy costs
by mandating the use of subsidized ethanol
and creating generous incentives for other
costly forms of energy.
One of the predicted consequences of
the ethanol mandate is becoming painfully
evident: rising food prices.
The ethanol industry insists that energy,
not corn, costs are lifting food prices.
While energy surely affects food prices,
ethanol’s contribution can’t be so easily dismissed. Unlike the demand growth pushing
up energy prices, the new demand for corn
is an act of Congress. So are the price effects. There’s no way to deny this (OGJ, July
9, 2007, p. 76).
Furthermore, ethanol aggravates the
energy-price rise that its supporters cite, in
part through the incremental rail and truck
transport needed to move the material from
scattered plants to blending locations.
Public grumbling has begun about the
food-price jumps that accompany ethanol’s
growth. It soon will turn serious.
USA Today reported July 2 that the price
of beer is set to leap because farmers are
planting corn in ﬁelds once dedicated to barley. Prices of the beer ingredient are rising.
If the prospect of jumping beer prices
doesn’t focus American attention to the
harm Congress does with politically motivated energy mistakes, nothing will.

US crude tops $73/bbl, may head higher
After testing price barriers during intraday trading for ﬁve consecutive sessions,
the near-month benchmark US crude contract closed above $73/bbl in New York on
July 13, and analysts said it could be headed higher this summer.
The August contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes touched an 11-month
intraday high of $74.01/bbl July 13 before closing at $73.93/bbl, up $1.43 for the day
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That same day in London, speculators pushed
North Sea Brent crude to an 11-month high of $77.70 in intraday trading via the IntercontinentalExchange Inc.—less than $1 short of the all-time high of $78.65/bbl last
August—on reports of production problems in the North Sea and forecasts of rising
demand.
As the August crude contract surged past $74/bbl in early trading July 16 before
NYMEX opened, analysts at the Société Générale Group said US oil prices were
“shifting to the left, now centered beyond $74/bbl.”
Having punched through the $73/bbl level, the front-month crude contract may
possibly climb to $75/bbl on New York commodity market, said Olivier Jakob,
managing director of Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland. He noted that benchmark US crude prices continued to rise “for a ﬁfth week in a row with a maintained
momentum bringing $75/bbl within reach and searching for the highs of last year.”
He said market dynamics remained “in a very strong technical momentum but still in
overbought territory.”
Earlier, Jakob said the “impressive” speculative assault for higher crude prices
“will need to have the support of the products” market to be sustained. He said, “European simple reﬁnery margins are already in the red and if the trend of rising Brent
and falling gasoline [prices] was to continue, then the European complex reﬁning
margins will start to also be under serious pressure.”
Adam Sieminski, chief energy economist, Deutsche Bank AG, New York, said
his bank raised its price forecast for West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude to an
average $60/bbl in 2010. “This compares with our prior $45/bbl estimate for both
benchmarks and an average of $20/bbl in the 1990s,” he said. “US natural gas prices
are forecast to average $8/MMbtu in 2010, up from a prior $7/MMbtu.”
Sieminski said, “A key justiﬁcation for this move is that ﬁnding and development
costs are rising rapidly and these are expected to rise further over the next few
years. Moreover, geopolitical challenges to supply are also deteriorating, at least for
now. Demand has not been as responsive to higher energy prices due to the growth
in real incomes. Plausible substitutes for oil and gas are expensive. The timeframe
for inducing the changes that could bring oil and natural gas prices down is getting
longer.”
IEA sees more demand
In its weekly report issued July 13, the International Energy Agency in Paris said
Brent futures prices surged past $77/bbl in mid-July because of tight market fundamentals, increased geopolitical tension in some major oil producing countries,
and indications of strong buying of petroleum futures by investment funds. “Falling
reﬁning margins suggest that market tightness is shifting from product to crude
markets,” IEA ofﬁcials said.
IEA expects global demand for petroleum products to rise by a robust 2.5% to
88.2 million b/d in 2008, due to a weather-related rebound in the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development member countries and strong demand
in non-OECD countries. “This represents an increase of 2.2 million b/d, from the
slightly revised 2007 level of 86 million b/d,” the agency said.
IEA sees production capacity of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries increasing by 2 million b/d to an average 35.4 million b/d next year, with nonOPEC production increasing by 1 million b/d to 51 million b/d. “Key growth drivers
include the former Soviet Union, Latin America, and global biofuels. OECD Europe
and North America [will] continue to see production decline, despite strong growth
from the US Gulf of Mexico and Canadian oil sands,” IEA predicted.
Jakob said, however, “After over-estimating non-OPEC supply for many years, IEA
is now over-estimating oil demand.” He said, “The IEA has started to make downward revisions to 2007 oil demand but [is] still forecasting a 400,000 b/d demand
growth in North America for the third quarter while the US Department of Energy is
showing zero growth in the 4-week average; [it is] still forecasting demand growth
for Europe in the third quarter when data released July 12 for Germany still shows
demand down in June by 9.7%, Italy down by 2.9%, etc.”

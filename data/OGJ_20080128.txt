COVER
The drill pipe, shown on the cover, is in the derrick of a rig used to
drill wells for producing Yuzhno Russkoye gas field in West Siberia.
Last December, ZAO Achimgaz, a joint venture of BASF AG subsidiary Wintershall and Russia’s OAO Gazprom, started producing
the field that contains more than 600 billion cu m of recoverable
gas.Wintershall says both companies contributed expertise to the
joint venture—Gazprom with its Arctic experience and Wintershall with its experience in developing technically demanding
reservoirs with horizontal wells under adverse geological conditions.
Articles in the Downhole Technology Review special report, starting
on p. 43, review new downhole technologies that are allowing
companies to recover more of the world’s remaining oil and gas
resources. Photo from Wintershall.

WEF forecasts energy supplies as key risk
Stable global energy supplies will be a major risk area for countries in 2008, according to a report published by the World Economic Forum (WEF), signaling that the issue is facing the highest
levels of political and economic uncertainty in a decade.
WEF, speaking in advance of its annual event in Davos Jan. 23-7,
said that new thinking and concerted action by business leaders
and public policymakers were critical to address the problem. Fossil fuel supplies are expected to become tighter over the next 2
decades, and more price shocks are likely to happen.
The report—produced together with a group of insurers and
finance experts—said that securing energy supplies and cutting
carbon emissions simultaneously will be difficult to achieve.
“With predictions of a 37% increase in oil demand over current
levels by 2030, the report sees limited scope for a fall in energy
prices over the next decade,” WEF reported. “This may be good
news for oil and gas producers, but it creates an inherent mismatch
between those who bear risk and reward, which should be addressed through better dialogue at all levels,” the group added.
David Nadler, vice-chairman of Marsh & McLennan Cos. USA,
one of the contributors, said: “A move towards a forward-looking
regulatory framework is needed in order to ensure long-term economic viability. This framework should seek to unlock investment
and innovation in cleaner energy and, ultimately, deliver an economic price for carbon.”

E&Y: UK reliance on gas for power to hit 65% 2025
The UK’s reliance on natural gas for electric power generation
will soar to as much as 65% by 2025 if the government doesn’t fully implement its new proposed energy bill, Ernst & Young warned
in a recent report.
E&Y said the UK’s security of supply could be jeopardized as
gas imports rise due to falling domestic supplies. The report said,
“Inaction and investment by default solely in [combined-cycle
gas turbines] could see the UK’s dependence on gas increase by as
much as 30% to 2025.”
Included in the energy bill, published earlier this month, the
UK government paved the way for a new generation of nuclear
power plants by inviting private companies to carry out projects

&

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

(OGJ Online, Jan. 14, 2008). Failure to stimulate the building of
new nuclear capacity, according to the report, would effectively
commit the UK to a “no nuclear” future by 2025.
Tony Ward, E&Y utilities director, said energy companies will
have to invest as much as £45 billion by 2025 to develop nuclear
and clean coal projects to meet the UK’s needs. This would be £17
billion more than an alternative mix with unrestricted expansion
of gas-fired capacity.
However, burdensome planning rules and regulatory uncertainty remain barriers to potential investment, and these must be
changed, the report noted.

UK lease round acreage holds large oil potential
Acreage on offer in the upcoming UK licensing round holds a
potential of 17 billion bbl, according to a study by North Sea consultancy Hannon Westwood.
The government plans to launch the 25th licensing round with
the largest number of blocks to date, and it will close by the end of
April. Hannon Westwood said this bidding round “has the potential to add 648 million boe through discoveries and 16.6 billion
boe thorough prospects to the UKCS asset pool.”
Examining unlicensed blocks and partial blocks, the report said
that there were 36 discoveries, which hold 648 million boe of
gross unrisked potential reserves, of which are 389 million bbl oil
and 1.55 tcf of gas.
There are 275 prospects within the blocks, and these hold an
estimated 16.6 billion boe of unrisked potential reserves. Prospects
hold 11.8 billion bbl of oil and 28.6 tcf of gas.
The potential resource in the study compares to 7.5 billion boe
in discoveries and about 50 billion boe unrisked, undrilled in exploration prospects in licensed and unlicensed acreage, according
to Hannon Westwood’s database.
During the last 12 months, exploration and appraisal activity on
the UK Continental Shelf had reached record levels over the past 10
years, the study said. In 2007, 65 vertical wells were spudded. Hannon Westwood estimates that there are another 3 years of drilling at
the current pace because there are more than 220 exploration and
appraisal wells planned for 2008-10. ✦

Development

Deepwater gas ﬁnd gauged north of Tobago
The first well on deepwater Block 22 in the Caribbean north of
Tobago Island is a large gas discovery, said operator Petro-Canada.
The Cassra-1 wildcat in 1,411 ft of water on the northwest edge
of a 26-sq-mile seismic amplitude anomaly flowed at an equipment restricted rate of 23 MMcfd from a 30-ft interval in an undis-

closed formation. The well went to TD of 5,617 ft and established
a gas-water contact for the anomaly.
Petro-Canada said, “Based on the well results and using local field
analog recovery factors, our seismic model indicates the discovery
could contain in the range of 0.6 to 1.3 tcf of recoverable contingent
resources.” Appraisal is required to finalize the estimates.

Mexico’s Petroleos Mexicanos has let a 3-year, $683 million
contract to Halliburton Co. to manage the drilling and completion
of 58 land wells in the southern region of Mexico.
The contract spans a number of well conditions, including
depressurized and high-pressure/high-temperature formations,
combined with complex geologies and tremendous depths, ranging 3,500-6,500 m.
Halliburton’s project management group will provide wellborecementing tools, stimulation equipment and wireline technology,
as well as drilling fluids, drill bits, directional-drilling services, and
completion tools.

Petrobras lets contracts for gulf ﬁelds
Petroleo Brasileiro SA subsidiary Petrobras America has awarded
two major contacts worth a total $300 million to Technip for the
development of the Cascade and Chinook gas fields in the Walker
Ridge area of the Gulf of Mexico. The fields lie in 8,200 ft and
8,800 ft of water, respectively.
The first contract covers the engineering, procurement, construction and installation of five free-standing hybrid riser systems
for both Cascade and Chinook fields.
The second contract covers the installation of the Cascade infield
flowlines and gas export pipeline and includes: welding of about
120 km of 6-in. and 9-in. steel pipelines, design and fabrication of
10 pipeline end termination and 2 inline tees, and installation of
the pipelines and associated structures.
Offshore installation is slated to begin in third quarter 2009,

Mobil to upgrade Nigerian production facilities
Mobil Producing Nigeria, a unit of ExxonMobil Corp., has let
a $220 million contract to a consortium led by AMEC PLC for upgrade work for its oil and gas production facilities in southeast
Nigeria over the next 5 years.
AMEC has teamed with Jagal and Netco to manage the project,
provide services, and prepare engineering designs to extend the
lifespan of production facilities. An AMEC spokesman told OGJ that
it hadn’t been yet given data on expansion increases as this was a
long-term project.

Chevron taps Atwood for semi newbuild
Chevron Australia let a contract to Atwood Oceanics Inc. for the
construction of a semisubmersible drilling unit for a period of at
least 3 years, with an option for up to 6 years.
The rig will be moored in as much as 6,000 ft of water with its
own mooring equipment, but could work an additional 2,000 ft
using prelaid mooring equipment.
The operating cost of the rig will be $470,000/day for 3 years and,
subject to cost escalation provisions in the contract, it may increase.
Atwood said the total cost of the rig, including administrative
and overhead costs and capitalized interest, will be $570-590 million.
Atwood executed a construction contract with Jurong Shipyard
Pte. Ltd. to construct the drilling unit at Jurong’s Singapore shipyard, with delivery expected in early 2011.
A Chevron spokesman said the contract underpins Chevron Australia’s long-term commitment to find, appraise, and develop Australian gas resources for domestic and international markets.

Silverstone taps Acergy for Victoria ﬁeld lines
Silverstone Energy Ltd. granted a £9 million contract to Acergy SA to install the flowline, control umbilical, and other subsea
equipment in Victoria gas field in the southern North Sea. Production is due to start by yearend.
Acergy will tie the field back to the Viking BD platform via Vixen, operated by ConocoPhillips.
Reserves to be recovered under Phase 1 are estimated at 36 bcf
of gas. The field will be developed through reentry of the discovery
well on Block 49/17. The Victoria facilities have been set up to
enable rapid development of the additional fault blocks that make
up the Victoria and Viking B extension, subject to performance of
Phase 1, Silverstone said.
Silverstone will export gas over 130 km through the Viking subsea pipeline to the Theddlethorpe gas terminal onshore in Lincolnshire. At least another four exploration wells are scheduled over the
next 12 months.
Silverstone was founded 3 years ago. Operator of the project
with a 50% stake, it will work with partners BP PLC and ConocoPhillips. ✦

CSB team visits BP’s Texas City reﬁnery
The US Chemical Safety Board has dispatched a team to BP
America Inc.’s Texas City, Tex., refinery to investigate a Jan. 10 process-related accident that killed an employee.
Refinery officials told CSB on Jan. 17 that a chemical explosion may have been involved in the ultracracker unit’s overpressure
event that led to the employee’s death. Earlier reports indicated that
water pressure was responsible, CSB said.
CSB said its team, which was slated to arrive on site on Jan. 18,
will be led by CSB Supervisory Investigator Don Holmstrom, who
led the agency’s 2-year investigation of the 2005 fire and explosion
at the refinery.

Petroplus Holdings wants to buy the 164,000 b/cd Petit
Couronne and 80,000 b/cd Reichstett Vendenheim refineries.
Petit Couronne, 130 km northwest of Paris on the Seine River,
produces 40% middle distillates and 20% gasoline. The Reichstett
Vendenheim refinery is in Alsace and produces 45% middle distillates and 20% gasoline. ✦

Gazprom to acquire Serbian NIS
Serbia was reported Jan. 22 as having agreed to sell OAO Gazprom a controlling interest in state oil company NIS. Terms of the
deal were not disclosed, but Gazprom in December 2007 offered
€400 million for a 51% stake in the company. At the time, Gazprom
also promised an additional €500 million of investment and that it
would route the South Stream pipeline through Serbia.
South Stream is a €10 billion gas pipeline project, running 558
miles under the Black Sea via Bulgaria to Italy. Gazprom and Italy’s
ENI SPA reached commercial terms on the project in December.
Feasibility and marketing studies on the 30 billion cu m/year project are under way, to be completed by yearend. Initial plans call for
construction to begin in 2009, with an in-service date of 2013.

TIRED AT THE END OF THE DAY? CONGRATS.
YOU’VE ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING.
You don’t shy away from hard work; you know
it’s a critical ingredient to success. But your
dedication and experience should count for
something. At Marathon, they do. In fact,
we’ve built America’s fourth-largest oil and gas company on those
ideals, plus honesty and integrity. Another thing that sets us apart
is that we want to help you succeed—and with opportunities in
the U.S. and abroad, there’s plenty of room for you to shine. And
because we’re a fully integrated oil and gas company, we even
have a stable launch pad waiting for you. Your hard work should
get you somewhere, right? After all, it’s your Marathon.

Winners and losers
If you simply look at the hard
numbers (prices, profitability, margins,
capacity utilization), you would draw
the opposite conclusion and recognize
that the oil industry’s best friends are
those who claim to be its worst enemies
(“Some dislike oil companies; some just
dislike oil”; OGJ, Dec. 24, 2007, p. 76).
They are more than misguided; they are
stupid. What they actually achieve is the
opposite of what they desire. Without
these people the US would be producing
another 5 million b/d offshore California and maybe even New Jersey. With
that reality, crude prices would be back
down to $25/bbl. The people forcing
mogas and diesel sulfur down to 10
ppm can take credit for shutting down
half of the US refineries in the last 25
years and certainly all of the hydroskimmers. The survivors have been the big
integrated guys who are now making
money faster than they can wheel-barrow it to the bank.
Ask yourself, Who are the biggest
winners and who are the biggest losers
in the reality of the current business
environment? The biggest winners are
the people who own the molecules. The
biggest losers are the people who have
to buy the molecules. It can’t be any
more simple than that.

(webcast section)

The webcast will be based on the annual Forecast and Review special report appearing this year in the January 21st issue of Oil & Gas Journal. The Forecast and Review
projects oil and gas demand worldwide and in the US for the new year. The US forecast
analyzes demand by petroleum product (such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and so forth).
The Forecast and Review includes forecasts for US and Canadian drilling activity.
In addition to the 2008 forecast, the webcast will include past predictions compared
with actual performance and industry trends for the previous four years. Bob Tippee,
Editor, will make the presentation, with Marilyn Radler, Senior Editor-Economics, and
G. Alan Petzet, Chief Editor-Exploration, on hand for questions. Marilyn assembles the
numbers and writes copy for the supply-demand portions of the Forecast and Review.
Alan does the drilling forecast.

Sponsorship opportunities are still available.

Injecting nanosensors

Guntis Moritis
Production Editor
A newly formed consortium aims
to develop nanotechnologies that can
characterize oil and gas reservoirs
more comprehensively than the current
means that rely largely on collecting
near wellbore data.
The consortium envisions the oil
and gas industry eventually having
intelligent sensors with a size less than
the width of a human hair, or in other
words, sensor dimensions that range
from hundreds of micrometers down to
hundreds of nanometers.
Once injected in the reservoir, these
sensors could collect and transmit data
on the fluid and rock properties from
any point in the pore space of a reservoir, and thereby facilitate additional
hydrocarbon recovery.

The consortium
Scott W. Tinker, director of the Bureau of Economic Geology (BEG) at the
University of Texas at Austin’s Jackson
School of Geosciences, told OGJ that
he has been working on forming the
Advanced Energy Consortium (AEC) for
the last 3 years and last August one of
the last hurdles was overcome when the
US Department of Justice’s antitrust division announced that it did not oppose
the venture’s formation.
AEC plans to develop but not commercialize the technology.
Tinker said, “The consortium provides a vehicle for this critical precompetitive research and sends a great message to young people that the industry

is investing substantially and for the
long term.”
Current members include BP America Inc., Baker Hughes Inc., ConocoPhillips, Halliburton Energy Services Inc.,
Marathon Oil Corp., Occidental Oil &
Gas Corp., and Schlumberger Technology Corp. Tinker said each company
made a 3-year, $3 million commitment
to the consortium. The consortium does
not receive any government funding.
BEG will manage the Houston-based
AEC, while the Richard E. Smalley
Institute for Nanoscale Science and
Technology at Rice University, which
has extensive nanotechnology expertise,
will be a collaborative technical partner.
The consortium held its first workshop at Rice University on Jan. 8-9 at
which materials scientists and electrical
engineers discussed nanotechnology
sensor and materials advances with
petroleum engineers and geoscientists.
AEC plans to hold the next meeting in
March. With these and other meetings,
AEC expects to develop a technology
roadmap that will provide more specific
targets and further narrow the focus of
subsequent project solicitations.
AEC will solicit worldwide for competitive project proposals and will fund
the most promising.
Sean Murphy, AEC manager, said in
June the consortium may start soliciting
Darpa-like (Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency) proposals for projects
and expects to begin awarding competitive and international grants for the
projects in September.
Murphy said AEC offers a low overhead because of its leverage with the
University of Texas and BEG.
The consortium plans to focus its
collaboration on projects with universities, national laboratories, other
consortia such as Sematech, private
companies, and the state of Texas.

Technology needed
As noted on a Rice University web
site: “Research in nanoscience has advanced in the last decade because of the
intellectual allure of constructing matter
and molecules one atom at a time, and
because the new technical capabilities
permit creation of materials and devices
with significant societal impact.”
The research has been in areas such
as surface microscopy, silicon fabrication, biochemistry, physical chemistry,
and computational engineering.
In the case of AEC, its primary focus
will be on funding projects that propose nanosensors with a long development time. These research efforts would
have to address communication, power,
sensing, deployment, retrieval, and
construction requirements.
AEC’s secondary focus is on projects that develop nanomaterials with
near-term potential for enhancing
hydrocarbon recovery. AEC says these
proposals would leverage existing and
new materials under development for
other technologies such as biomedical,
health, telecommunications, military,
and national security. It notes that the petroleum industry already uses nanomaterials to strengthen and harden drilling
equipment and as drilling fluid additives.
There remain many hurdles to
surmount before nanosensors can
effectively provide new insights on
reservoirs. AEC says some of these include providing a power supply for the
devices, device size, material durability
in harsh environments (such as brines
and clays), determination of sensor
location in the reservoir, manufacturing
scalability, reasonable costs, and overall
economics.
The hurdles are many, but this stepchange in technology may help recover
the estimated 60% of the oil left in the
ground using current technology. ✦

Energy and economic woes
Political responses to economic problems can
do more harm than good. The US government is
now rushing together a political fix for an economy unraveling at surprising speed. A $140 billion
package of rebates to taxpayers and short-term
incentives for business investment seems likely.
At issue are eligibility and size of the rebate, the
nature of the incentives, and immunization of the
initiative against the special-interest leeches that
attach themselves to fast-moving legislation when
no one is looking.
Debate so far has avoided the contribution of
US energy policy to economic distress. National
leaders, after all, don’t like talking about their
mistakes. But the silence is regrettable. Urgent concern about the economy should give the nation a
chance to focus serious attention on energy, maybe
even to correct historic errors and avoid new ones.

sible environmental regulation. Even as statutory
air pollutants fall, for example, the Environmental
Protection Agency ponders toughened standards
that would expand requirements for reformulated
gasoline and possibly raise costs of making the
fuel. Costs of making diesel fuel similarly have
risen recently as refiners meet sulfur standards
stricter than they need to be. In a reversal of the
historic pattern, the retail price of diesel now exceeds that of gasoline most of the time.
The argument here is not against environmental performance standards for vehicle fuels; the
country needs them, and they obviously work. The
dispute here is with standards that raise fuel costs
without producing commensurate environmental
gains. A review of past and proposed fuel standards, with adjustments as warranted, is in order.

The Iranian oil and gas industry—
although about a century old—has
never been so derelict, poorly managed, and near bankruptcy as it is today.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has
recognized the deterioration of the
Iranian petroleum industry as an opportunity for exploitation. In particular,
he has manipulated the Islamic regime’s
leadership through deception and false
promises of the “benefits” of cooperation
with Russian companies in the oil and gas
sectors.
Isolated and under
extensive and serious
sanctions by western countries, the Islamic Republic of
Iran has looked to the north and has
seen Russia as a country that follows
the same path and goals as the Islamic
fundamentalists in Tehran—that of
challenging the American presence in
the region. Russia has opposed the US’s
pushing for tougher sanctions against
Iran and has called for open dialogue
with Tehran and lighter sanctions
against Iran.

When the 2-day summit of the
Caspian Sea’s five littoral states—Russia,
Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Iran, and
Azerbaijan—was held in Tehran in midOctober 2007, a large Russian delegation with an extensive list of demands

former Soviet Union. Currently, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Russia have so far
agreed to divide the upper portion of
the Caspian seabed according to national sectors along the so-called modified
median line, leaving the sea itself for
common use. This has enabled the three
states to agree upon the delimitation
of the Caspian seabed on adjacent parts
and conclude bilateral agreements to
exercise sovereign rights on the use of
mineral resources. However, Turkmenistan and Iran apparently are not happy
with these divisions and are struggling
to have a bigger share of the sea than
they now have (see map).
Considering the statements made by
Kazakhstan President Norsultan Nazarbajev upon his arrival in Tehran, the
early treaties dictating the sharing of the
Caspian Sea between the Soviet Union
and the Iranian government now are
null and void. Evidently, the summit
was not about the Caspian issue. Rather,
the Russian president has pushed for
control and hegemony of both the
natural resources of Iran and the riches
of the whole region.
The summit produced aggressive
comments by the nondemocratic leaders of Iran and Russia who, deeply wary
of American influence, are admonishing
against outside interference by increasingly assertive resource-rich countries
in the Caspian Sea area.

emphasized the firm policy and urgent

Caspian nation under any circumstances
should offer or allow its soil to third
powers for use of force or military
aggression against any Caspian nation.
The Caspian states should prohibit the
use of their territories by any outside
powers for military force against any
country in the region—an obvious reference to longstanding rumors that the
US has been planning to use Azerbaijan
soil as a base for possible military attacks against Iran. Putin and Ahmadinejad have consistently pushed for the

Sea issues unresolved
However, the five Caspian nations appeared no closer to resolving the border
and other legal issues of the sea, which
have been in limbo since the Soviet
Union collapsed. The absence of transparency has led to conflicting claims to
seabed oil and gas deposits, including
a dispute between Turkmenistan and
Azerbaijan, and also between Iran and
Azerbaijan on their offshore borders.
However, as mentioned before, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Russia have signed
their own bilateral deals dividing about
64% of the sea among them.
Except for the accomplishment
of selling out the Iranian oil and gas
industry, the summit could well be

described as a summit of postponed
problems, including no common agreement among the five littoral countries

man said. “Everyone—governments
included—has an important role to play
in the development of alternative fuels
and advanced energy technologies. But
the private sector cannot do it alone. We
need a new way of thinking about how
we can work with the private sector.
Even our research priorities must be
developed with substantial input from
corporations, utilities and universities.
And research needs to be conducted in
a coordinated way.”

Governments should commit
To that end, Bodman has challenged
many countries’ governments to publicly commit to increase investment in
research and development necessary to
achieve the necessary alternative fuels
and energy efficiency breakthroughs,
and to achieve the right balance
between energy security and environ-

mental stewardship. “This requires
significant public and private global
investments. But it’s worth it,” he said.
Increased investment in energy research and development also would help
meet another global challenge: the shortage of qualified engineers and technical
staff needed to meet the demand for
rapid innovation, Bodman said.
“We need to invest in the next generation of leaders to steer us through
the energy challenge, and we must get
beneficial technologies into the marketplace more quickly. That means sharing
the risk that capital markets and the
private sector are not yet ready to take
on,” said Bodman.
One example is a new technology
commercialization and development
fund that DOE is developing at several
of its national laboratories, he said.
The fund will permit the labs to use

prototype development, demonstration
projects, market research, and other
deployment activities to move clean
energy technologies that have moved
beyond the research stage toward commercial viability, he said.
“We must leverage the power of
private equity, as we are doing in the
example I just cited. We must make
smart public funding and regulatory
decisions and unleash the world’s best
scientists and engineers on the problem
of developing cost-effective, marketready advanced energy technologies,”
said Bodman.
“Without sustained global investments, and without a new global commitment to invest in new sources of
energy and breakthrough technologies,
we will not achieve the innovations we
must have to solve the world’s critical
energy problems,” he warned. ✦

GAO: US should improve oil product supply system
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The US petroleum product distribution system is constrained in key areas
and will likely become more so without
timely investments, the US Government
Accountability Office warned in a Jan.
18 report.
“Industry and federal agency officials
report a systemic lack of pipeline capacity in the supply infrastructure system
in key states, including Arizona, California, Colorado, and Nevada, and note
[that] the existing supply infrastructure
is insufficient to carry the commensurate volume of petroleum products
and crude oil needed to meet growing
demand there,” GAO said.
It noted that in 2006, the US Department of Transportation proposed—and
Congress approved—legislation requiring the US energy and transportation
secretaries to periodically analyze where
unplanned product pipeline outages or
insufficient pipeline capacity increase
prices, and whether regulations are
24

Congress did not allocate funds specifically for that purpose, according to
the report. The departments did not
reallocate other funds for such a study,
“although DOE told us it has met with
DOT to discuss how this work could
be approached.” The cover letter said,
“However, given that the study has not
begun, it seems highly unlikely that
agencies will be able to meet their June
2008 deadline for reporting to Congress.”
GAO noted that there are many private sector plans to expand the domestic oil and product supply distribution
system and that such plans could significantly relieve stresses on the system
if they are implemented quickly. “However, a complex permitting and siting
process involving as many as 11 federal
agencies and numerous stake and local
stakeholders has slowed or impeded

“While there is widespread recognition that a study is needed to fully identify the extent of infrastructure inadequacy and the impact on prices, to date
no such analysis has been undertaken,”
GAO said in a cover letter to the two
US senators who requested the study:
Commerce, Science, and Transportation
Committee Chairman Daniel K. Inouye
(D-Hi.) and committee member Maria
Cantwell (D-Wash.).
The senators asked GAO to evaluate trends in the international trading
of products, refining capacity and its
use internationally and domestically,
international and domestic crude and
product inventories, and the domestic
supply infrastructure to better understand how changes in markets have
affected prices, the service said.

such lead federal agency exists to facilitate permitting of crude oil or petroleum product pipeline construction or

The report made several recommendations aimed at improving the functioning of US product markets. They
included a suggestion that the energy

“Finally, the report recommends
that several agencies, including the
commission, work together to evaluate the feasibility and desirability of
designating a lead agency with eminent
domain authority in order to streamline
the process for siting oil and product

suggested use of the commission’s role
in the siting of gas pipelines as a model
will help to expedite the deliberations
of the agencies. Further, the active participation of the commission will help
facilitate a decision on the lead agency
designation.” ✦

API: Rising oil prices, falling stocks constrain demand
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Rising oil prices combined with falling inventories to keep US petroleum
product demand essentially flat during
2007, the American Petroleum Institute
said on Jan. 17.
Demand, which API measures in
products supplied, grew by 9,000 b/d to
an average 20.696 million b/d this past
year from 20.687 million b/d in 2006,
API said in its yearend statistical review.
Demand was strongest early in 2007
when crude prices were about $50/bbl
and regular grade gasoline retailed for
about $2/gal, API Chief Economist John
C. Felmy told reporters. Demand pulled
back by yearend, when crude prices
approached $100/bbl and gasoline
retailed for $3/gal, he said.
API’s figures showed that December’s
total product deliveries fell 0.6% to an
average 20.7 million b/d in 2007 from
20.8 million b/d in 2006. “Consumers
appear to be responding to the higher
prices at the margin,” Felmy observed.
Meanwhile, domestic crude inventories, which had reached their highest
level since 1991 of 355 million bbl at
mid-2007, fell by more than 60 million
bbl to end the year at 294 million bbl—
their lowest level since January 2005,
but still roughly in line with the 5-year
average for December.

Crude production rises
It was the most rapid 6-month crude
inventory drawdown in more than 5

years, according to Ronald J. Planting,
information and analysis manager in
API’s statistics department. “Domestic
crude oil production rose for the first
time since 1991, but this was at least
in part a recovery from below-trend
production in 2006, when it had been
slowed by the aftermath of hurricanes
and by pipeline repairs,” he said.
Domestic crude and condensate
production grew 1.1% to an average of
nearly 5.2 million b/d in 2007 from
slightly more than 5.1 million b/d in
2006, according to the statistics. They
also showed that natural gas liquids
production climbed 1.7% year-to-year
to an average of nearly 1.8 million b/d
from more than 1.7 million b/d. Increases were concentrated in the Rocky
Mountains and the Midwest as oil well
completions reached their highest level
in decades, API said.
Planting said the combination of
recovering crude production, flat domestic demand, and the heavy domestic
inventory drawdown reduced petroleum imports during 2007 from the
previous year’s levels, although they
still accounted for about 65% of total
domestic deliveries.
The statistics said that total imports
fell 1.9% to an average 13.4 million b/d
in 2007 from 13.7 million b/d in 2006.
Crude imports, excluding purchases for
the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, declined by 1% year-to-year to an average
10 million b/d from 10.1 million b/d,
while product imports dropped 4.5% to

3.4 million b/d from 3.6 million b/d
during the same period.

Record product output
“Meanwhile, in 2007, the industry
exceeded past records for the production of gasoline and distillate fuel oil,
Planting said. “It also was the 11th
straight year of increases in US refining
capacity,” he said. Most of the distillate
which was refined was “clean diesel,”
which was introduced in 2006 to help
improve air quality.
Gasoline produced during 2007
contained a record amount of ethanol,
which accounted for nearly 5% of all
gasoline sold. “The industry used some
2 billion gal more ethanol than the government required,” Planting said.
Refining capacity grew by 0.4%
during 2007 to an average 17.5 million
b/d from 17.4 million b/d in 2006,
according to the statistics. Capacity
utilization rates retreated 1.2 percentage points to an average 88.5% in 2007
from 89.7% in 2006 as a result but still
remained well above rates for US industries as a whole. “Despite high oil prices, the industry worked hard to meet
the needs of consumers by producing
record amounts of fuel,” Felmy said.
“These rollercoaster changes are a huge
challenge. In order to properly supply
consumers, the industry must anticipate
demand, and that has been very difficult
given changing conditions. Nevertheless, it has responded by producing fuel
and importing additional supplies as
required,” he said. ✦

Congressman seeks delay for Alaska Chukchi Sea lease sale
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
US Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.)
has urged Secretary of the Interior Dirk
A. Kempthorne to postpone the Minerals Management Service’s sale of leases
26

in the Chukchi Sea off Alaska for a
year until the Fish and Wildlife Service
(FWS) decides whether to list the polar
bear as an endangered species. Otherwise, Markey threatened, he would
introduce legislation to compel the
administration of President George W.

Bush to do just that.
Markey’s remarks came during a
hearing on possible Arctic offshore oil
development impacts on polar bears by
the House Select Committee on Energy
Independence and Global Warming,
which he chairs. He called it after FWS

said on Jan. 7 that it would not announce its decision until after the Feb. 6
lease sale. FWS said the delay was necessary because the agency reopened and
extended the comment period after US
Geological Survey scientists submitted
new studies and data in September.
FWS Director H. Dale Hall testified
that oil and gas development would not
threaten polar bears but said a delay was
needed to fully review the thousands of
comments received.
Ranking Minority Member F. James
Sensenbrunner (R-Wis.) said the polar
bear already is protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.
Inslee said it would not be possible
for MMS to withdraw leases or modify
terms if the bear goes on the endangered species list after the sale and
expressed concern over the lease sale’s
environmental impact statement, which
said there was a 31-53% chance of a

1,000 bbl oil spill if leasing takes place
in the Chukchi Sea.
MMS Alaska Regional Director John
Gall said the agency expects no significant spills within the sale area, saying
the last spill from an oil platform was
in 1980. “We’ve been very successful in
preventing oil spills since them.”
MMS Director Randall Luthi said
the agency requires lessees to supply
detailed information about mitigation
and monitoring programs for protected
species before any drilling begins.
Leaseholders also must obtain permits
from the Environmental Protection
Agency and other regulators and ensure
that their plans are consistent with the
Alaska coastal zone management program, he added.
“The MMS also has a robust regulatory system designed to prevent
accidents and oil spills from occurring.
This includes redundant well control

equipment, emergency plans for ice
conditions, production safety systems,
and much more. In Alaska, an MMS
inspector is onboard drilling rigs 24
hours a day, 7 days a week during critical drilling operations,” Luthi said in his
written statement.
Steven Amstrup, who leads the polar
bear team at USGS, said he expects
negative impacts on the animal from
sea ice destruction to continue but that
more research is needed. Others noted
that the polar ice cap is melting more
quickly than originally estimated and
has shrunk by 20% since the 1970s.
The Center for Biological Diversity
submitted the original petition to list
the polar bear as endangered in 2005. A
panel of witnesses said the decision has
been repeatedly delayed despite an increasingly obvious threat to polar bears
from global warming in general and oil
and gas development in particular. ✦

CERA-IHS: Global oil ﬁeld decline rate at 4.5%/year
The aggregate global decline rate for
producing oil fields is 4.5%/year rather
than the 8%/year sometimes cited in
other studies, said Cambridge Energy
Research Associates (CERA) and IHS Inc.
in a report entitled “Finding the Critical
Numbers.”
The CERA-IHS analysis was based on
production characteristics of 811 oil
fields that account for about two thirds
of current global production and half of
the total estimated proved and probable conventional oil reserves base. The
report was released Jan. 17.
Annual field decline rates are not increasing with time, said Peter M. Jackson,
CERA oil industry activity director and
report author. This finding “provides
the basis for more confidence about the
future availability of oil,” he said.
“Decline rates are a function of
reservoir physics and investment strategies,” Jackson said. “There is a general
historical trend toward lower decline

longer than originally forecast.
• Individual offshore fields are
declining at a 10%/year rate compared
with 6%/year for onshore fields. Deepwater fields decline at 18%/year compared with 10%/year for shallow-water
fields. Offshore fields held by producers

Exporting Countries decline 5%/year

to better reservoir management practices and the impact of new technology.
In addition, because reservoir physics is
only one of the key drivers, we would
not expect to see a very rapid change
in average decline rates in the future
without a step change in technology or
field development strategies.”

EIA gas projections to 2030 identify market changes
This energy outlook for natural
gas to 2030 was developed by the US
Energy Information Administration
and focuses on a short-term reference
case, Annual Energy Outlook 2008
(AEO2008), which it compares with
the Annual Energy Outlook 2007
(AEO2007) reference case.
This early release version does not
include consideration of HR 6, the Energy Independence and Security Act of
2007, that was signed into law on Dec.
19, 2007. EIA said a revised reference
case, to be released later, will include
the impacts of HR 6.
Meanwhile, this reference case assumes that current policies affecting
the energy sector remain unchanged
throughout the projection period.
Policy changes—such as the adoption of
policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions—could change the projections.
28

While some current laws and regulations will change, and new ones will be
created over the next 25 years, no one
knows the specifics of what they will be
or when they will be enacted. Consequently, this reference case provides a
basis against which the impacts of new
proposed policies and regulations can
be compared.
Trends in energy supply and demand
are affected by difficult-to-predict factors: energy prices, US and worldwide
economic growth, advances in technologies, and future public policy decisions in the US and in other countries.
Energy markets are changing in
response to factors such as the higher
energy prices experienced since about
2000, the greater influence of developing countries on worldwide energy requirements, recently enacted legislation
and regulations in the US, and changing

public perceptions on issues related to
the use of alternative fuels, emissions of
air pollutants and greenhouse gases, and
the acceptability of various energy technologies, among others. The AEO2008
reference case makes several important
changes from earlier AEOs to better
reflect trends that are expected to persist
in the economy and energy markets. The
projection for US economic growth, a
key determinant of US energy demand,
has been lowered, reflecting an updated
projection of productivity improvement.
Key energy market changes EIA analysts
have identified include:
• Higher oil and gas prices.
• Higher delivered energy prices,
reflecting both higher wellhead prices
and transportation and distribution
costs.
• Slower projected growth in energy
demand, especially for gas.

• Faster projected growth in the use
of (nonhydroelectric) renewable energy
forms.
• Higher domestic oil production in
the near term.
• Slower projected growth in gas
imports.
• Slower projected growth in energy-related emissions of carbon dioxide.
These important adjustments, however, have limited implications for some
parts of the overall energy outlook, and
US energy consumption will continue
to be met predominantly by traditional
fossil fuels, with coal, liquid fuel (excluding biofuels included in liquids),
and natural gas meeting 83% of total
US primary energy supply requirements
in 2030—down only slightly from an
85% share in 2006 despite higher energy prices, lower total energy demand,
and increased use of renewable energy
compared with AEO2007.

Economic growth

Energy consumption

The AEO2008 reference case reflects
reduced expectations for economic
growth. US gross domestic product increases at an average rate of 2.6%/year
during 2006-30, about 0.3 percentage points slower than the rate in the
AEO2007 reference case over the same
period.
The price of natural gas is higher in
the AEO2008 reference case. The real
wellhead price of natural gas (in 2006
dollars) declines from current levels
through 2017, as new supplies enter
the market. After 2017, real natural gas
prices rise to $6.60/Mcf ($10.40/Mcf
in nominal dollars) in 2030. The higher
prices in the AEO2008 reference case
reflect an increase in production costs.
Higher natural gas prices will be supported by higher oil prices.

In 2030, the levels of consumption projected for gas is lower in the
AEO2008 reference case. Among the
more important factors resulting in
lower total energy demand will be
lower economic growth, higher energy
prices, greater use of more-efficient appliances, and slower growth in energyintensive industries.
Higher delivered energy prices and
slower growth in commercial square
footage will lead to slower growth in
commercial energy consumption. Delivered commercial energy consumption
will rise 11.5 quadrillion btu (quads)
in 2030 from 8.4 quads in 2006, but
almost 1 quad less than in AEO2007.
Since 1997, delivered energy consumption in the US industrial sector has
trended downward, falling from about
27 quads in 1997 to 25 quads in 2006.
Factors implicit in reducing industrial

US trade groups
expand reach

US

oil and gas trade associations may seem to have their
hands full with domestic issues. But
they’re still expanding their reach
overseas, several of their Washington
executives revealed last month.
“At our members’ direction, we
deal with only a piece of the overall pie. We work with the federal
government to increase opportunities
to show the flag in parts of the world
where resources are an important
issue,” American Petroleum Institute
Pres. Red Cavaney said.
He was particularly pleased that
the administration of President
George W. Bush had appointed an
assistant secretary of state with a
background in energy. API regularly
participates in background briefings
there, and works with other oil and
gas groups to promote transparency
and oppose unilateral sanctions,
Cavaney said.
“We also see increasing interest
globally in the manpower issue. It
transcends borders,” he said.
API had just opened its first
international office when I spoke to
Cavaney. Beyond advocacy, the Beijing
office’s focus is to develop standards
and other special programs, he said.
“We now have more certification customers in China than in the United
States,” Cavaney noted.

Law of the Sea treaty
Other associations would like to
see the Senate ratify US participation in the Law of the Sea Treaty.
“We’re a long-time supporter.
Nearly everyone seems to like it,
although one group has objected
because of sovereignty issues it
sees,” said National Ocean Indus30

tries Association Pres. Tom Fry.
“It’s been reported out of committee four times now, but there’s
a virulent right-wing machine that
opposes it. We support it because
it would significantly extend Outer
Continental Shelf jurisdiction for the
United States and, inherently, its oil
and gas authority,” said Brian T. Petty,
senior vice-president, government affairs, for the International Association
of Drilling Contractors.
Petty said he did not expect a bill
to reach the Senate floor until after
February’s presidential primaries,
but added that time could be of the
essence.
“Other countries which have acceded to the treaty already are staking
their claims. We’re not even at the
table. It’s all about oil and gas. Some
of the first decisions are going to be
made in mid-2009,” Petty said.

Other overseas issues
IADC also is pushing for a worldwide offshore regulatory model
and adoption of uniform standards
and practices. Its members, as well
as producers they work for, have
encountered access and regulatory
problems overseas similar to what
they have experienced domestically,
particularly in countries that are
members of the European Union,
according to Petty.
IADC is the only US oil and gas
association that has observer status
on the International Seabed Authority,
which was created by the United Nations’ Law of the Sea convention.
“It’s because we’re an international
association, and it puts us ahead of
the US government,” Petty said. ✦

energy consumption include economic
weakness during 2000-03, the hurricanes of 2005 that reduced activity
in some subsectors, and rising energy
prices.
Total industrial energy consumption
in AEO2008 will include strong growth
in nontraditional fuels, such as coal-toliquids and biofuels.
Gas consumption in the AEO2008
reference case is projected sharply lower
than in AEO2007 as gas consumption
increases to 24.3 tcf in 2016 from
21.8 tcf in 2006, then declines to 23.4
tcf in 2030. Consumption is lower in
all areas, particularly in industrial and
electric power.
Industrial gas use is 1.3 tcf lower in
2030 in the AEO2008 reference case
(8.5 tcf compared with 9.8 tcf in the
AEO2007 reference case) because of
higher delivered natural gas prices,
lower economic growth, and a reassessment of gas use in energy-intensive
industries. In 2030, electricity generation accounts for 5.1 tcf of gas use,
compared with 5.9 tcf in the AEO2007
prognosis. The lower level of consumption in AEO2008 results from higher
gas prices and slower growth in electricity demand.

Electricity generation
In AEO2008, electricity generation
from gas-fired power plants is seen
increasing sharply to 2007 from 2006
then remaining relatively flat for the
next 5 years, before rising slowly
through 2016.
The gas share of electricity generation remains 20-21% through 2018,
before falling to 14% in 2030. Given the
assumed continuation of current energy
and environmental policies in the reference case, carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology does not come
into use during the projection period.
Total electricity generation from
nuclear power plants will grow to 949
billion kw-hr in 2030 from 787 billion
kw-hr in 2006 in the AEO2008 case,
accounting for about 17% of total generation in 2030.

for electricity generation also is stimulated by improved technology, higher
fossil fuel prices, and extension of the
tax credits in EPACT 2005 legislation.

Gas production, imports
Total domestic gas production, including supplemental gas supplies, will
increase to 20.2 tcf in 2021 from 18.6
tcf in 2006 before declining to 19.9
tcf in 2030, EIA predicts. The projections are lower, primarily because of the
higher costs associated with exploration
and development and, in the last decade
of the projection, lower gas demand.
In the AEO2008 case, Lower 48
offshore gas production shows a pattern
similar to that in the AEO2007 case,
growing to a peak of 4.5 tcf in 2019
from 3 tcf in 2006 as new resources
come online in the Gulf of Mexico.
Beyond 2019, Lower 48 offshore production will decline to 3.5 tcf in 2030.
After a small, near-term increase, onshore conventional gas production will
decline steadily, as it did previously.
Onshore production of unconventional gas is expected to be a major
contributor to growth in US supply,
increasing to 9.5 tcf in 2030 from 8.5
tcf in 2006. As in AEO2007, most of the
increase in unconventional production
is projected to come from gas shale,
which more than doubles over the
projection, to 2.3 tcf in 2030 from 1 tcf
in 2006.
The Alaska gas pipeline is expected
to be completed in 2020, 2 years later
than in the AEO2007 reference case
because of delays in the resolution of issues between Alaska’s state government
and industry participants.
After the pipeline goes into operation, Alaska’s total gas production in
the new reference case increases to 2
tcf in 2021 (from 0.4 tcf in 2006) and
then to 2.4 tcf in 2030 as the result of
a subsequent expansion. The pipeline
connecting the MacKenzie Delta in
Canada to the US is not constructed
in the AEO2008 reference case, unlike
in AEO2007, because cost estimates
recently filed by the industry substantially exceed the estimates included

in AEO2007, and the project is not
economical with AEO2008 reference
case prices.
Net pipeline imports of gas from
Canada and Mexico, predominantly from
Canada, fall to 0.5 tcf in 2030 from 2.9
tcf in 2006 (compared with 0.9 tcf in
AEO2007). The difference between the
projections for 2030 is largely a result of
increased exports to Mexico.
The higher level of exports to Mexico will result from a lower assumed
growth rate for Mexico’s gas production
than in AEO2007. Net imports from
Canada also decline, reflecting resource
depletion in Alberta and Canada’s growing domestic demand, which are offset
somewhat by increases in unconventional gas production from coal seams
and tight formations.
Total net LNG imports to the US will
increase to 2.9 tcf in 2030 from 0.5 tcf in
2006, compared with 4.5 tcf in 2030. The
lower projection is attributable to higher
costs throughout the LNG industry, especially in liquefaction, and decreased US
gas consumption due to higher gas prices,
slower economic growth, and expected
greater competition for supplies within
the global LNG market.
US LNG regasification capacity will
increase to 5.2 tcf in 2009 from 1.5 tcf
in 2006, with the addition of five new
regasification facilities that currently
are under construction (four along the
Gulf Coast and one off the coast of New
England). Given global LNG supply
constraints, overall capacity utilization
at US LNG import facilities is expected
to remain under 35% through 2013,
after which it is expected to increase to
57% in 2017 and remain in the range
of 55-58% through 2030.
One of the key uncertainties in the
AEO2008 reference case is the future
direction of the global LNG market. With
many new international players entering LNG markets, competition for the
available supply is strong, and supplies
available to the US may vary greatly yearto-year. The AEO2008 case has been updated to reflect current market dynamics,
which could change considerably as
worldwide LNG markets evolve.

Energy intensity
Energy intensity, measured as energy
use in 1,000 btu/dollar of GDP (in
2000 dollars), is projected to decline at
an average annual rate of 1.6% during
2006-30. Although energy use generally increases as the economy grows,
continuing improvement in the energy
efficiency of the US economy and a
shift to less energy-intensive activities
are projected to keep the rate of energy
consumption growth lower than the
rate of GDP growth.
Population influences demand for
travel, housing, consumer goods, and
services. Since 1990, population has
increased by about 20% and energy
consumption by a comparable18% in
the US, with annual variations in energy
use per capita resulting from variations
in weather and economic factors.
The age, income, and geographic
distribution of population affect energy
consumption growth. The aging of the
population, a gradual shift from the
North to the South, and rising per-capita income will influence future trends.
Overall, population in the reference case
increases by 22% to 2030 over 2006.
Over the same period, energy consumption will increase by 24%. The
result is an increase in energy consumption per capita at an annual rate of
0.1%/year during 2006-30—slightly
slower than in the AEO2007 reference

spending in the US and Canada because
of uncertainty in natural gas prices. But
the US and Canada still will account for
more than one third of total spending,
Talisman said.

Encore Acquisition

T

he US Minerals Management Service has begun an evaluation of
the environmental issues associated
with future federal Outer Continental
Shelf lease sales for oil and gas exploration in the Beaufort and Chukchi
seas off Alaska.
That will really upset environmentalists around the world.
Ahead of any protests, MMS said it
will prepare an environmental impact
statement focusing on the potential
environmental effects of the sales
from exploration, development, and
production of the area proposed for
leasing.
The area to be evaluated for Beaufort Sea Sales 209 and 217, slated for
2009 and 2011 respectively, encompasses 33 million acres, 3 to 205
statute miles off Alaska’s northern
coast.
The area for sales proposed for the
Chukchi Sea, Sales 212 and Sale 221
slated for 2010 and 2012 respectively, cover 40 million acres 25 to 275
miles off the coast.

Impacts anticipated?
“MMS will continue to work
closely with the state of Alaska and
local communities throughout the
EIS process to ensure the document
evaluates the potential impacts of the
proposed sales,” said MMS Alaska
OCS Regional Director John Goll.
One of those impacts concerns
wildlife, as the Chukchi Sea is home
to one of two US polar bear populations.
“The chances for the continued
survival of this icon of the Arctic
will be greatly diminished if its last
remaining critical habitat is turned
into a vast oil and gas field,” said
34

Margaret Williams, managing director
of World Wildlife Fund’s Kamchatka
and Bering Sea Program.
The directors of two Department
of the Interior agencies said they
were “confident” oil and gas exploration in the Chukchi Sea can proceed
without threatening polar bears.
The officials appeared before a
Congressional committee on global
warming that is examining why the
department is postponing a decision
on whether to further protect polar
bears even as it is proceeding with
the oil lease sales in the Alaska Sea.

Proceed with caution
Other people took issue with their
confident views.
If oil and gas development is
allowed, said Rep. Edward Markey,
the congressional committee chairman, “we will be accelerating the day
when the polar bear will be extinct.”
Steven Amstrup, a polar bear
expert for the US Geological Survey,
DOI’s science arm, said if there is an
oil spill, the impact on bears would
be grave.
“The polar bears do not do well
when they get into oil,” Amstrup told
the committee. If bears in the wild
get in contact with oil it’s likely to be
fatal, he said.
We will not speculate here how
the bears will fare in the debate. It
is perhaps enough to note that a
protest has been registered and that
it will begin to resound around the
world.
Who, after all, could imagine a
world without snowy white polar
bears? Very clearly, international oil
companies will have to proceed with
caution on this issue. ✦

This year Encore Acquisition plans
to spend $347 million on drilling, $67
million on improved oil recovery and
workovers, and $31 million on land,
seismic, and other expenses.
The company, based in Fort Worth,
plans to spend $164 million in the
Rockies, $140 million in West Texas,
$102 million in the Midcontinent, and
$39 million in its New Mexico region.
Jon S. Brumley, EnCore Acquisition
president and chief executive officer,
said the 2008 budget represents lower
risk than did the 2007 budget because
the company has refined its focus on
long-life oil field enhancement.

TXCO Resources
Formerly known as Exploration Co.,
TXCO of San Antonio noted that the
budget could be revised based on drilling changes by partners, rig availability,
drilling results, unanticipated transactions, and market fluctuations.
The Glen Rose formation, including
the Maverick basin’s prolific Porosity oil
play, is slated to receive the largest share
of the budget—about $40.7 million for
35 wells, including 10 reentries.
Texas Fort Trinidad field in East Texas is
slated for $12.5 million for 10 wells targeting TXCO’s Glen Rose B shoal gas play.

GDF, QPI deal
As the leading LNG importer in Europe, GDF is keen to enhance its presence in Qatar and develop cooperation
“with the world’s top LNG exporter,”
while Qatar wants to develop its access
to different markets, particularly by
investing in regasification terminals and
gas storage sites.
With the forthcoming merger of
GDF and Suez, Qatar will have access to
a group that is among the leading LNG
operators worldwide and, therefore, on
a large number of markets. ✦

Trend surface residual anomaly
(TSRA) mapping techniques have been
applied to three regions (Fig. 1) to
demonstrate their use in the identification of blind structures and trends in
areas with substantial well data and
limited seismic data.
TSRA mapping is a fast, simple, and
inexpensive technique that is capable of
detecting individual faults, fault-related
structures, structural trends,
reef complexes, and sole
horizons. It is commonly difficult to delineate these features in a standard structure
contour map because they are
masked by regional dip. Blind
thrusts, decollements, and
reefs are challenging to identify and
delineate because of the inherent lack of
surface information.
Typical exploration involves correlating available seismic and well data
in conjunction with potential field and
lineament data, but extrapolating trends
or structures usually involves gathering
more data or drilling. Decollements are
especially difficult to identify in seismic
and borehole data because the fault
surface is parallel to bedding without
marker offsets. Only when a decollement ramps up-section or splays can
it be more easily identified, yet the associated structures will be localized and
decrease up-section.1-4
Trend surface analysis is a traditional
technique that has long been used by
geologists for the analysis of geological
data,5 6 approximation of regional dip,7-9
and general subsurface exploration.9
The technique represents a methodology for approximating observed data,
and serves as a graphical representation
of the regression surface.
Trend surface and TSRA mapping
have long been used in potential field
mapping and modeling, but application of this technique to well data is
uncommon. Well data are customarily presented as structure contour and
isopach maps, along with well-to-well
correlations.
In essentially flat-lying stratigraphy,

has been shown to detect or delineate
individual fault(s), structures, structural trends, reef structures, and sole

Case studies
dent on correlations of known fault
displacements or reef thicknesses with
the residual anomaly values, but also to
the amount of data and data spacing. In
general, the less data or data coverage
will require a lower order trend surface
because higher-order trend surfaces will
increase the amount of edge effects and
contouring errors (Fig. 2).
Statistical tests may not be appropriate guides for the selection of degree
of the residual anomalies because the
targets are ultimately qualitatively
chosen based on geologic correlations
and not by “goodness of fit.”9 11 TSRA
values below known displacements or
thicknesses are undesirable and may
negate the resulting map. A lower-order
trend surface should be utilized until
the generated values are slightly above
observed or estimated fault displacements or reef thicknesses.
For example, a fault with 10 m of
offset, identified in a geophysical well
log, should ideally match the TSRA
value or be slightly larger than the measured displacement. Therefore, if a TSRA
36

value derived from a first-order trend
surface was 12 m, then the map would
be acceptable. If a second-order TSRA
value was calculated to be 7 m, the
map should be disregarded because the
TSRA value was less than known fault
displacement. Ideally multiple observed
values should be used to tie the residual
values and observed data.
This illustrates the subjective and
iterative nature of TSRA mapping. However, statistical tests and knowledge of
the regional geology can help minimize
misinterpretations. After a TSRA map
has been generated, it may be possible to identify potential structures or
trends, but further in-depth well log
correlations and seismic reflection data
can then be used to define the detailed
characteristics and possible origin of
the feature.
It is also possible to create TSRA
maps by creating synthetic datasets
from digitizing paper structure contour
maps. TSRA mapping does not have the
ability to extrapolate or identify structures in areas with poor well coverage

Three case studies are presented
that illustrate the varied uses of TSRA
mapping in the Appalachian and Alberta
basins.
Each region has a different tectonic
setting and targeted geological feature,
but they are approached using the same
methodology. The order of the trend
surfaces was based on known and estimated fault displacements or reef thicknesses. All interpretations were based
on the understanding of the regional
geology and stratigraphic architecture.
The targeted features were the Rome
trough in the southern Appalachian basin, the Chautauqua anticline and a decollement in the northern Appalachian
basin, and Devonian reef complexes in
the Alberta basin.

Chautauqua anticline
The Chautauqua anticline (also
known as the Bass Islands structural
trend) in western New York is associated with small-displacement thrust faults
splaying off the termination of a blind
decollement soled in Silurian Salina

Group salts.2 3 12 13
The anticline has been extensively
drilled for hydrocarbons for over 30
years and therefore serves as an ideal
case study. It is difficult to delineate
the structure using standard structure
contour maps, but it is clearly identifiable in a TSRA map (Fig. 4). This open
anticline has a limited surface expression3 14 but tightens down-section.
The horizons chosen to illustrate this
structure were the Dunkirk shale (Upper Devonian), Onondaga limestone
(Middle Devonian), and Medina formation (Lower Silurian). Each horizon is
separated by 1,000 ft (Fig. 5). The upper two horizons are above the decollement and delineate the Chautauqua
anticline along with other structures.
The northwestern shift in the anticlines signature on the TSRA maps from
the Onondaga limestone to the Dunkirk
shale denotes the structure has a northwest vergence. In the Medina formation
TSRA map the Chautauqua anticline is
no long identifiable because the horizon is situated below the detachment.
Hence, to bracket or validate the sole of
a decollement, one must generate maps
above and below the sole horizon in
order to properly identify the changing
deformational patterns.
Other structures are also revealed in
the TSRA maps. Notice that the Lakeshore anticline is still evident in the Medina formation TSRA map. The Medina
formation is below the inferred master
detachment, so this structure is probably associated with another unknown
feature (i.e., a deeper decollement or
basement structure).
Also, the NNW-SSE feature, increasingly evident in the lower horizons, is
associated with the Dunkirk fault. It is
interpreted as a reactivated basement
fault.3 The Sheridan anticline may also
be related to the Dunkirk fault as they
are parallel and the anticline is on the
inferred hanging wall.

Rome trough
The Rome trough is a northeasttrending aulacogen related to Iapetian
rifting during the Cambrian.

In areas of good well coverage the small, but prominent linear high are related to known producing ﬁelds in Tennessee. In areas
of increased data coverage, anomaly widths and amplitudes decrease indicating wide and isolated highs are probable artifacts.

In eastern Kentucky, the Rome
trough (Fig. 6) is bounded on the
west by the Lexington fault system, on
the north by the Kentucky River fault
system, and on the south by the Rockcastle River fault system.15-17 The trough
extends from New York to Tennessee but
is poorly delineated near its distal ends
due to limited data.14 18
Sparse basement drilling and seismic
reflection data in the region have hindered the delineation of the structure
in Tennessee and Kentucky. Secondorder TSRA values generated from well
data were smaller than inferred fault
displacements,16 19 20 and therefore a
first-order TSRA map was chosen to best

delineate the rift system.
Ideally more data are needed to
more accurately express the subsurface
extent of the rift system. The basement
structure contour map clearly shows the
main segment of the Rome trough in
eastern Kentucky; but the extent of the
rift system is not obvious.
It is difficult to identify the Rockcastle River fault system, and the Floyd
County channel is represented as a
very large feature (due to regional dip
masking the relatively small size of the
feature). Even with a limited dataset and
using a first-order TSRA map, the basement TSRA map can apparently identify
all of the major rift systems and project

tive complexes can be identified by
removing the prominent southwestern
regional dip from shallower horizons9
and correlating the TSRA values with
the estimated amounts of differential
compaction.
The first-order TSRA map reveals
there is a regional anticlinal trend to the
northwest superimposed on the prominent regional dip to the southwest. A
second-order residual map proved to be
more valuable because it notably delineates an anomalous trend that parallels
known reefs and production.
The TSRA values also correlate well

tested at stabilized rates up to 19.2
MMscfd in 4 hr from perforations at
1,139-68 m in the main Mio-Pliocene
Doina reservoir, said operator Sterling
Resources Ltd., Calgary.
After a 14-hr test at a fixed 16.5
MMscfd on a 48⁄64-in. choke with 1,160
psi stable wellhead flowing pressure, the
well was shut-in for pressure buildup.
Equipment capacity constraints that
limited the test rates also resulted in
the decision not to perforate the lower
12-m net pay interval.
Sterling said, “Performance of the
Doina Sister well during test indicates
that it has superior reservoir qualities
compared to the original Doina well,
as expected from the electric open hole
log data, and this will be quantified on
recovery of the pressure gauges.”
The well will be suspended for
future reentry, the Prometeu jack up
released, and a 2008 drilling program
discussed.

Sweden
The Swedish Mining Inspector
granted an application by Tethys Oil AB,
Stockholm, to explore a 133,400-acre
license on northern Gotland Island in
the Baltic Sea south of Stockholm.
Sweden has no commercial oil or
gas production, but oil was previously
produced from Ordovician reefs on
Gotland, which the company called
“the country’s only proven oil region.”
Tethys Oil said historic data and further work using gravimetry and radar
techniques could improve understanding of the distribution of the reefs,
several of which have been mapped and
drilled. Surface geochemical surveys
may be run later, possibly leading to
seismic surveys and drilling.

Log-while-drilling tools at the second
well at Flatrock field on South Marsh
Island Block 212 off Louisiana indicated
three resistive zones 198 ft thick on a
315-ft gross Rob-L section, said McMoRan Exploration Co., New Orleans.

The well, drilled to 15,400 ft about a
mile northwest of the Flatrock discovery well, is to be deepened to 18,100
ft to evaluate other Rob-L and Operc
targets. The discovery well, expected on
line in the first quarter of 2008 using
the nearby Tiger Shoal field facilities,
flowed 71 MMcfd of gas and 739 b/d
of condensate from the Operc section
in October 2007. Drilled to TD 18,400
ft, it cut 260 net ft of hydrocarbonbearing sands in a 637-ft gross interval,
five in Rob-L and three in Operc.

Alaska
Brooks Range Petroleum Corp. reentered the North Shore-1 well on Jan. 10
to evaluate an oil accumulation initially
tested in 1974.
Drilled to TD 13,319 ft measured
depth and cased to 12,500 ft MD in
2007, the well is to be deepened 1,000
ft for tests of the Jurassic-Triassic Sag
River and Ivishak formations. The rig
will then move to the Tofkat-1 well in
the Titania prospect area just east of
Niuqsut east of the Colville River. The
joint venture consists of Brooks Range,
TG World Energy Inc., Bow Valley Alaska
Corp., and Ramshorn Investments Inc.

Texas

SandRidge Energy Inc., Oklahoma
City, identified seven exploration targets
to drill in the West Texas Overthrust after
processing less than 20% of an anticipated 1,400-sq-mile 3D seismic survey.
The company controls almost all
the land and production infrastructure
around the projects, which are several
miles from its Pinon gas field development.
SandRidge plans to drill 440 wells in
2008 in a $1.25 billion capital budget,
of which $1.1 billion is for exploration
and production. That covers $622 million for drilling in the WTO including
Pinon field, $285 million for drilling outside the WTO, $33 million for
PetroSource, and $151 million for land

Technology advances
are allowing companies
to extract more oil and
gas from resources that
in previous years were
uneconomic to develop.
Production
These resources include
gas found in tight sands,
shales, and carbonates; extra heavy oil;
and additional oil from mature fields
that require enhanced or improved
recovery techniques.
Various papers from the SPE Annual
Technology, Nov. 11-14, 2007, provide
insights into technologies that companies use or will use to facilitate recovery
of these resources.

Gas
Hydraulic fracturing is a key technology for obtaining higher producing
rates and recoveries from unconventional gas accumulations.
One problem has been that in some
locations the height of the created
hydraulic fracture may intersect waterbearing sands. A potential solution for
this problem, as described in a paper by
D.L. Fairhurst and others,1 is to fracture the sands with carbon
dioxide contained in a visceoelastic fracture fluid. The
method, according to the
paper, will minimize fracture
growth to prevent fracturing
water sands while attaining
sufficient fracture length in
the gas sand.
The paper describes an
optimization study on South
Texas tight gas sands that
were 20-50 ft away from the
water sands. The laminated
sand and shale sequences in
this South Texas area contain
gas sands with 0.05-0.8
md permeability at a 4,500
ft depth while the thicker
water-bearing sands have 0.1-2.0 md
permeability.
Another tight gas formation,
0.003-0.015 md permeability, in which
technology has helped redevelop is
the Cleveland formation that lies at

O D U C T I O N

6,500-8,200 ft depths in northeastern Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma
(Fig. 1). The formation is an interbedded sequence of sand with thin shale
laminations and fine-grained sandstone.
A paper by Neil C. Decker and others
describes the success of operators such
as BP PLC in drilling infill horizontal
wells in the Cleveland.2
The Cleveland formation was discovered in the
late 1950s
and originally developed with
vertical wells
on 640-acre
spacing and
later infill drilled so that wells now have
mostly 160-acre spacing. The paper
stresses that the success of the infill
wells has resulted from acquiring and
analyzing data to optimize horizontal
well configuration and completion
type. The data used come from extensive subsurface mapping, core analysis, openhole logging, microseismic
acquired during hydraulic fracturing,
injection fall-off tests, and production-

RECOVERY METHODS

™

September 30 – October 2, 2008
Hilton Fort Worth
Fort Worth, Texas USA

THE RETHINKING CONTINUES
By rethinking recovery methods, producers have brought to a hungry market gas from reservoirs once considered economically and
technically impossible. Tight sands, shales, and coalbeds now represent large and growing sources of an essential form of clean energy.
But they’re still unconventional. The reservoirs are complex. The costs of drilling into and completing
wells in them are high and rising. They present unique environmental problems.
Producing gas from unconventional reservoirs proﬁtably, safely, and in amounts demanded by the
market requires continuous rethinking – the kind of thinking that shoves back limits on what’s possible
with gas supply.
Rethinking of recovery methods will continue Sept. 30 – Oct. 2, 2008, at the Unconventional Gas
International Conference & Exhibition at the Hilton Fort Worth in Fort Worth, Texas. Planned by editors
of Oil & Gas Journal and an advisory board of industry experts, the event will highlight innovation
from unconventional gas plays around the world. It will be your chance to meet and learn from other
professionals in the fastest-growing sector of the gas-producing industry.
So mark your calendar.
Plan to attend the ﬁrst annual Unconventional Gas International Conference & Exhibition.

years, is attributed to

Since it was started
12 years ago, the

• Recognizing
when profile modification is needed before injecting polymer
and when zonal isolation is needed during
polymer injection.
• Establishing an
optimum polymer
formulation, injection
rate, and individual
well production allocation.
• Understanding
the time-dependent
variation of the poly-

mer molecular weight in the injected
slugs.
The paper describes the polymers
used at Daqing as having 12-38 million
Dalton molecular weights that are designed and supplied to meet the various
reservoir conditions. It says the optimum polymer-injection volume varies
but is about 0.7 pore volume, depending on the water cut of an area. Other

In another part of the world, redevelopment of Daleel oil field in Block
5 in northern Oman will entail use of
horizontal water-injection wells. A paper by L. Zhang and others summarizes
the positive response obtained with
horizontal injection well in several pilot
test at Daleel.9
Production from Daleel is from
a Shuaiba carbonate formation at
1,500-1,610 m depth that came on
stream in 1990 and produces a 38°
gravity oil with 0.85 cp viscosity. Before
Daleel Petroleum LLC acquired the field
from Japex Oman in 2002, it had been
depleted with vertical and horizontal
wells.
The paper notes that recovery factors in similar fields have increased to
35-40% with waterflooding compared
with on 15-20% with primary.
With a 35% recovery factor, ultimate
oil recovery in Daleel will be 196 million bbl, according to the paper.
In other fields in Oman, Petroleum
Development Oman (PDO) has had
success in reducing unwanted water
production in horizontal wells through
use of swelling elastomers, according
to a paper by Majid A. Mahrooqi and
others.10
These elastomers swell when water
contacts them, thereby isolating the water producing zone. The paper explains
that the water-based elastomers are
wrapped around normal casing joints
and vulcanized together (Fig. 4). An
osmosis process swells the elastomer
when bottomhole temperatures are
50-90° C.

BP’s in-house “Pushing Reservoir

to “provide several additional billion

polymer, “Bright Water,” that may improve water flood performance.
Last month at the company’s Woodcreek office in Houston, Shell’s global
wells technology manager, Lance Cook,
told industry media that “the
easy oil and gas is gone—
new technology is needed for
a new age.” The company’s
size and geographic spread,
he said, allows it to develop
certain technologies in-house
and test in a variety of different conditions. Cook said the
ability to implement globally

from its peers.

ton developed the idea for a specialized
molecule that could be used in more
effective waterfloods in 1997.3 Tightly
bound, long-chain polymer molecules
could be injected downhole in relatively
cool fluid and designed to pop open–
expand—and plug pores at certain
elevated temperatures. The cool particles
are less than 1⁄1,000 of a mm in diameter
but expand to more than ten times
when they reach a specific warmer
temperature in porous zones surrounding reservoirs.
Morgan and Frampton took the idea
to the MoBPTeCh research consortium,
supported by Mobil, BP, Texaco, and
Chevron (now disbanded). From there,
the chemical giant Nalco Co. joined the
effort, and Nalco’s K T Chang helped
develop the molecule into the “Bright
Water” product.
The first field trial took place at a
Chevron-operated field in Indonesia,
followed by trials in two BP-operated
fields in Alaska: Milne Point and Prudhoe Bay, in 2004-05. The new polymer
was tested in Argentina in 2006-07, in
fields operated by Pan American Energy
(BP 60%, Bridas Corp. 40%). It was also
tested in Pakistan in 2007.
Nalco, BP, and Chevron continue to
test the new chemical. ✦

Norms in the industrial world have
evolved to the point that workplace injuries are unacceptable, and companies
have learned that better safety leads to
greater efficiency and production.
Manufacturers have also learned that
emphasis on process safety will lead to
better personal safety but the reverse is
not necessarily true. Yet many companies still struggle to achieve the level
of safety and production to which they
aspire.
This struggle also puts negative

plants, as evinced by the incident at BP’s
Texas City refinery on Mar. 23, 2005, in
which 15 people died.
The January 2007 report of the
BP US Refineries Independent Safety
Review Panel (“Baker Report”) emphasizes the key difference between
personal and process safety: “Personal
or occupational safety hazards give rise
to incidents that primarily affect one individual worker for each occurrence.
Process safety hazards can give rise to
major accidents involving the release
of potentially dangerous materials,
the release of energy (such as fires
and explosions), or both.”
Fundamentally, the Baker Report
concluded that BP had placed too
much emphasis on personal safety to
the detriment of process safety. The review panel and subsequent recommendations, therefore “focused on deficiencies relating to corporate safety culture,
process safety management systems,
and performance evaluation, corrective
action and corporate oversight.”

Safety, production

Productivity in manufacturing has
steadily improved for decades, placing
demands on the industry to compete
by increasing production at lower costs
and with fewer people.
But there is an inherent, positive link
between safety and production. One
solution is better asset performance

positive results and program success.

Reﬁning safety
Fig. 1 shows that the US refining
industry had much better safety performance than all private industry during
the last decade. In the 1970s and 1980s
many operators, particularly industry leaders, had good personal safety
programs and a strong safety culture.
But the prevalent attitude among some
refinery workers and management was
that workplace injuries were a natural
part of the business.
Getting the job done and keeping
units operating and production rates
up required doing “whatever it takes.”
Only a few documented procedures
were readily available and, therefore,
successful operations largely depended
on the memories of the most experienced hands in the company, at the
site, or on a given shift. Often those
individuals and others in leadership felt
their presence during unit start-up or
shutdown was absolutely necessary for
a successful operation. It was common for a process to reach a critical
stage while these key individuals were
completing 24, 36, or more continuous
hr of work.
Although many factors affect the
safety results of a manufacturing site,
this mentality and the failure to take
time to document good procedures
(then insist that people follow them)
were undoubtedly contributors to the
poor safety record of these facilities.
Manufacturing safety pioneers like
E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. led the
way for US industries to embrace the
concept of an injury-free workplace.1
Early forms of safety initiatives were
largely based in negative motivation
with punitive measures for failure to
comply with safety rules. Although it

For decades, manufacturing plants
struggled with balancing plant safety
against meeting cost and profit demands.
As recently as the 1990s, annual injury rates per 200,000 hr worked were
reported to be in the high teens for
some refineries, and “days away from

1992-98, another 25% cost-reduction
target was set by BP management after
its takeover of the refinery from Amoco
in 2000.9 There were also indications
that employees and managers received
conflicting messages that had a negative
impact on their safety culture.
One successful approach (used by
Marathon Refining to achieve safe, profitable manufacturing results) is “design
it right, operate it right, maintain it
right.” This article stresses this philosophy and describes how one can apply it
in concert with the Baker Report, which
emphasizes the need to have the right
corporate safety culture that leads to
better process safety.
The emphasis in this article is on the
“maintain it right” principle.
Applying an asset optimization
program is key to increased effectiveness due to improved reliability, which
results in major gains in corporate profitability. Companies can maintain and
reliably operate well-designed equipment by:
• Operating within its defined
physical capabilities.
• Performing maintenance recommended by manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Identifying good maintenance
strategies using advanced, risk and
statistical-based analytical techniques,
or other proven methods.
An effective APM program ensures
that every piece of equipment is operated and maintained within prescribed
limits. With the right information (statistically derived and risk-adjusted), one
can make informed decisions about the
production plan. The resultant equipment and unit reliability ensures safety
of the process.

system is capable of monitoring the
equipment, generating maintenance
strategies, and managing them will
dictate the system’s effectiveness.
With any asset-intensive business,
it is also vitally important to track the
equipment data and history.
Using multiple software packages to
collect disparate data (from enterprise
asset management or computerized
maintenance management systems) is
difficult to coordinate, represents a large
training problem, increases administrative costs, and may suboptimize the solution. The obvious approach is to have
an integrated enterprise APM system reinforced with good work practices that
allows organization, analysis, and presentation of the right data and results to
the right people at the right time.
Comprehensive programs also must
be in place to monitor and maintain
fixed and rotating equipment, power
systems, and instrumentation. In
multiple-site companies and in large
facilities, it is unreasonable to attempt
to manage such a detailed information
system with manual data collection and
analysis.
These systems will include lifecycle design criteria, positive material identification of existing and new
components, rigorous piping and vessel
inspection routines, a corrosion-underinsulation program, safety instrumented

systems compliance, instrument calibration monitoring, vibration programs
for rotating equipment, and power
management programs.
The critical nature of instruments
in process safety has been assumed for
quite some time. Because the Baker Report highlighted the fact that a number
of failed instruments contributed to the
BP incident in 2005, it is even more apparent that companies must emphasize
instruments by installing an instrumentation performance management (IPM)
system, a critical component of any
comprehensive reliability program.
IPM is a system for managing and
improving the performance of process
instrumentation as well as safety instrumented systems through the integration
of tools, processes, and workflows for
calibration management, safety instrumented system life cycle management,
and reliability management tools.
Figs. 3 and 4 show the results for
one company with an efficient, effective
APM system, but are typical for many
plants.
In a generally profitable business,
it is difficult for a modestly capable
manager to spend more on safety than
a site would return in productivity and
gross revenue. If, however, leaders were
to find themselves in such a situation, the conclusion should be to cease
operations rather than compromise

safety. The skill is to know the difference
between a safe operation and one that
has failed to achieve that necessary level
of performance.
A system to ensure better equipment
reliability and overall process safety is
therefore needed in addition to programs that foster good personal safety.
The most effective system will:
• Provide a solid foundation for
gathering all pertinent asset information, keeping track of equipment data,
and doing advanced analytics on the
data.
• Make the organized data and
maintenance strategy recommendations
readily visible on a near-real time basis
to all who need them.
• Conduct risk-based analysis via advanced analytical techniques that result
in optimized maintenance strategies.
• Facilitate these principles across a
plant and multiple sites.
• Ensure continuous improvement

strategies and keep them evergreen.

The Society of Petroleum Engineers
estimates that the industry will experience a 44% attrition rate among
petroleum engineers by 2010.11 These
attrition rates are common amongst
professionals in all fields related to reliability and must be addressed through
improved procedures and training.
Data storage media are readily available and affordable for capturing good
procedures, but the work processes associated with retrieval of those data by
the right person at the right time have
yet to mature and become readily available to manufacturers. Many attempts
have been made to come up with an effective knowledge-management system
to address this need, but none has been
widely accepted in the industry.
Most systems have approached the
issue from the perspective of finding
ways to move information from function to function in an organization,

An intimate knowledge of each piece

The Baker Report charged the refining and chemical industry to heed
lessons learned from the 2005 BP
incident. Implementing an APM system provides an effective approach to
achieving world-class reliability based
on enterprise-wide asset management
concepts and practices.
These practices require exemplary

With record levels of LNG traveling
in opposite directions
through the Suez Canal,
the economic rationale
for swapping cargoes
LNG
is growing stronger.
The concept is simple:
Instead of two ships embarking from
different sides of the world and passing
each other to supply
remote markets, the
parties involved agree
to supply the markets
closest to them, saving
time, fuel, and money.
Paradoxically,
however, we are seeing
robust growth in bidirectional trade
between the Atlantic and Pacific basins.
Swappable volumes increased to 3.4
million tonnes/year (tpy) in 2006
from 0.3 million tpy in 2005 and will
exceed 6.0 million tpy in 2007. Growth
is being driven by Asia’s thirst to soak
up volumes to support buoyant gas
demand and make up for shortfalls in
supply from Indonesia and delays to
new projects such as Sakhalin 2.
Business is booming but the new
dynamic is exposing a major inefficiency in the LNG market—a reluctance
to swap cargoes. What’s the commercial
incentive for doing so? The answer is an
average saving of up to $4 million/swap
($2 million/cargo); the equivalent of
$240 million in 2006 and potentially
more than $400 million in 2007 based
upon Wood Mackenzie estimates.
Numerous factors are currently
inhibiting the free trade of LNG cargoes
and limiting the amount of swap deals
taking place. But what stands out most
notably is a lack of cooperation across
the industry. Suppliers recognize that
they could enhance their returns by
taking advantage of high prices and cost
savings through swaps, but contractual
constraints, issues around execution,
and a lack of transparency across the
industry currently limits their ability to
do so.
As the market evolves and moves
towards an increased level of short-term

and spot activity, the opportunity to
find swap counterparties will increase.
Strategic partnerships between key players will help to facilitate swap deals but
formation of a forum, or an “LNG Swap
Club” involving suppliers and buyers
within each basin, would expedite the
process and offer wider benefits to the
industry. Over time this could potentially evolve into an independent exchange
to enable buyers and sellers to submit
bids and offer cargoes.
Development of an LNG Swap
Club would improve the operational
efficiency of the industry and offer
mutual benefits to suppliers and buyers.
Whether the concept takes off will depend on how the cooperative is set up
and the appetite of the various players
to be involved. Either way, the pressing
question being asked by many is not if
swaps will happen, but when?

Flows between basins
LNG flows have moved through the
Suez Canal for more than a decade, but
until 2005 they were primarily in one
direction—westwards from the Middle
East and Pacific supply projects to meet
demand in the Atlantic Basin. With
large growth in Middle Eastern supply
and greater dependency on LNG across
Europe and North America, the level
of traffic heading west should increase
greatly.
Recent years, however, have seen a
rapid rise in LNG flowing in the opposite direction. The occasional trickle
of spot cargoes heading east has been
replaced by a steady stream of deliveries
into the Pacific Basin because of strong
demand and higher prices in the Asian
market (Fig. 1).
Growth in trade from the Atlantic to
the Pacific has been staggering. Volumes
increased to 3.4 million tpy in 2006
and are forecast to rise by 100% to
reach 6.8 million tpy in 2007. As well
as growing in size, the number of countries participating in the trade is also
increasing. Egypt and Equatorial Guinea
have joined Algeria, Nigeria, and
Trinidad as key Atlantic basin suppliers.
And China and India have joined Korea,

hindrance. Efforts by the Association
of International Petroleum Negotiators
(AIPN) to develop a standardized LNG
sales and purchase agreement (SPA)
for spot transactions have met mixed
responses. The style and liabilities are in
keeping with a traditional SPA, but the
agreement is very different from what
traders would use for buying and selling spot cargoes.
• Profit split, shipping savings split. Determining how profits will be split is often
a thorny issue. Everybody involved will
naturally seek a share of profits and other benefits. Profit splits are used to describe the difference between the price
and the cost to get it to market, divided
by the number of parties involved.
The benefits associated with swapping cargos, however, are due to
shipping-cost savings. Therefore, a
more appropriate term to use would be
shipping savings split (SSS). Swapping
out two cargoes across the Suez might
generate savings of $4 million.

ing to get consensus on how it should
be distributed is where the transaction
becomes difficult. Who gets what will
depend on several factors, including the
number of parties involved and their
respective roles and influence as a buyer
or seller; contract terms (e.g., FOB/DES
delivery point); and whether the swap
is for a spot cargo or long-term contracted volume.
• Timeliness issues. The short-term
nature of swap deals, as opposed to
long-term contracts, naturally places a
premium upon an expeditious negotiating process. The logistics involved,
however, tend to be complex.
Swaps tend to involve several parties
located in different parts of the world,
creating communication obstacles.
While the logistics of rescheduling and
provisioning ships and ensuring terminal accessibility frequently complicate
matters.
Quantifying and agreeing upon the
allocation of costs and rewards of the
swap deals are usually time-consuming

and often difficult. Formulation of a
series of standardized pro-forma agreements covering various scenarios and
benchmark measures would go some
way towards helping to address this
issue.
• Operational control, risk. The long-term
contractual nature of the LNG industry
has nurtured a risk-averse culture and a
desire for operational control. It has also
given incumbents a strategic advantage
and made it difficult for new players to
enter the industry, although this in itself
should not impede swaps.
Some suppliers have been reluctant
to swap cargoes because they consider
the operational risk too great and do
not want to jeopardize their reputations
as reliable exporters. If a cargo were
swapped for another and something
untoward happened, for instance, who
would be liable for the ship, its contents, and any potential damage to the
port facilities? Would relationships be
undermined and what would be the
impact on future delivery schedules?

Swapping cargoes also raises a dilemma for longer-term shipping capacity planning. Should companies contract
shipping for their base commitments
or for assumed swaps? Some players
could find themselves in a position with
insufficient capacity to deliver cargoes
to their original counterparties if swap
opportunities fail to materialize, a situation potentially remedied by procuring
short-term capacity.
• Desire for opacity. While producers may
be able to achieve cost reductions by
using swaps, these savings may be outweighed by the additional revenues that
they can realize through continued opacity around the commercial arrangements
for LNG supply. Pricing arrangements
for LNG trades, particularly spot cargoes,
tend to be quite opaque and producers
may worry that by engaging in swaps,
they will have to reveal the terms of their
arrangements to counter parties who
might then arbitrage away some of their
profits or somehow release this information into the market.
These constraints represent significant barriers in the short to medium
term, but their significance is likely to
diminish as the market evolves. Closer
inspection of the bidirectional flows
through the Suez suggests that some
factors are more prevalent than others.
Most of the 5.3 million tpy flowing
westwards through the Suez during
2006 was delivered into Spain under
long-term agreements from Qatar and
Oman. Consequently it is improbable
that technical issues associated with
LNG specification and ship-port compatibility hindered trade as the Pacific
buyers already import significant volumes from the Middle East, and Spain
has received regular deliveries from
Atlantic suppliers in the past.
Other factors have played a part, but
contractual constraints and operational
control and risk factors appear to be
the main barriers inhibiting potential
swap trades. The contracted position (3
million tpy) of Spain’s Gas Natural with
Qatar illustrates this point.
Given its track record of diverting
Trinidadian volumes between Europe
62

and the US, the Spanish utility is not
averse to trading out volumes to take
advantage of arbitrage opportunities,
but few of the Qatari cargoes are being
switched for volumes in the Pacific. This
may be due to strict destination clauses
imposed by the Qataris or to commercial terms associated with the financing of the supply project that prohibit
swaps from taking place.
As the primary source of the transSuez trade, Qatar stands to gain the most
value by swapping volumes between the
two basins. It is not doing so at present
likely because of difficulties in negotiating swaps with equivalent counter parties in the Atlantic basin and some of the
issues mentioned previously.
Arranging SSSs with Gas Natural
may not be as lucrative as it could be in
projects in which Qatar Petroleum has
an integrated position along the value
chain, for example, in Qatargas 2 where
fewer parties would be involved in
any SSS in the event of a swap. QP may
in fact be biding its time and waiting
until Qatargas 2 starts up before it takes
advantage of the arbitrage opportunities
between the two basins.

Competition, cooperation?
While it makes logistical sense to
swap out volumes across the Suez, the
major factor inhibiting it is the clash of
two opposing forces—competition and
cooperation.
Suppliers are competing with each
other to get the highest price and best
value for their cargoes. Similarly buyers
are competing with one another to attract cargoes to their respective markets.
Currently the margins generated from
higher prices in Asia are far greater than
the cost reductions from swaps. Hence,
the reason for bidirectional flows
between the two basins. But ultimately
the most prudent strategy would be to
take advantage of high prices and cost
reductions via potential swaps.
How could this additional value be
realized? In essence by removing the
difficulties associated with executing
swap deals and by improving cooperation across the industry. This could be

initiated by a roundtable forum involving suppliers and buyers within each
basin to discuss the issues in a more
open format.

LNG Swap Club
The forum could be used to facilitate
trade and create an LNG Swap Club.
Over time the forum could become
more sophisticated and potentially
evolve into an independent exchange
to enable buyers and sellers to submit
bids and offer available cargoes. As well
as facilitating swaps, the forum could
be used to share information on ships’
delivery schedules, identify obvious
commercial opportunities, and improve
the overall efficiency of the industry.
Setting up an exchange, however,
is likely to be easier said than done.
While openness would be appreciated by many, the lack of transparency
in the current market benefits others.
Suppliers may be reluctant to reveal the
terms of their arrangements and share
information with counter parties due
to commercially sensitive contractual
obligations and concerns.
Although these have traditionally
been barriers, there are signs that things
are starting to change. For example,
there has already been a noticeable improvement in the amount of information more openly available over recent
years and with new technologies evolving it is becoming easier to track cargo
movements across the industry. ✦

Request for more
oil highlights US
contradictions
These thoughts might have occurred
to Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah when US
President George W. Bush, during a visit to
the desert kingdom, requested an increase
in oil production:
1. The world leader who famously
described his country as “addicted to oil,”
and who thus turned US energy discourse
into a riot of wishful thinking, now asks for
more oil.

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

2. Less than a month ago, while signing
a US energy bill that does nothing to boost
oil supply, Bush said, “One of the most
serious long-term challenges facing our
country is dependence on oil, especially oil
from foreign lands.” Yet here he is, asking a
foreign land for more oil.
3. It’s bizarre for Bush to seek more
foreign oil on behalf of a country that leads
the world in oil use yet refuses, with leasing and other restrictions, to produce all it
can domestically.
4. Yes, Saudi Arabia can produce more
oil—but to what purpose? It has committed
to holding 1.5 million b/d in reserve to meet
demand surges. According to the International Energy Agency, the kingdom has
250,000 b/d more spare production capacity
than that. Although the oil, if produced,
would be heavy, sour crude not greatly in
demand, the increment could ease pressure
on inventories. But it also would trim total
spare capacity among members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, excluding Iraq, to 2.43 million b/d.
That’s barely enough to cover the sudden
loss of supply from hotspots like Nigeria
and Venezuela. Oil traders know this. A production increase of the likely amount thus
might not lower oil prices much and might
even have the opposite effect. Any larger
output hike, one that shrunk the 1.5 million b/d Saudi cushion, would legitimately
spook the market.
5. How does Saudi Arabia respond to
this tangle of contradiction? There’s only
one constructive approach. Acknowledge
that Bush’s appeal reﬂects an incendiary and ill-informed political climate, for
which Bush himself deserves only part of
the blame. Then answer with an obviously
needed reminder that, with oil no less than
with any other commodity, everything
depends on the market.

Crude futures price closes at 5-week low
The February crude contract fell 71¢ to $90.13/bbl Jan. 17 on the New York Mercantile Exchange—its lowest closing in 5 weeks—after Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke told the US House Budget Committee downside risks to US economic
growth in 2008 were “more pronounced” than ever. Bernanke said he was “not forecasting a recession,” although a US government report showed new home construction has slowed to its lowest pace in 6 years.
Nevertheless, the market continued to support crude prices at $90/bbl—“still a
very high ﬂat price level taking in consideration the overall gloom and doom, and
the product cracks have been holding (which is to be expected when the reﬁneries are shutting for maintenance),” said Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix GMBH, Zug,
Switzerland. Having fallen for three sessions, the February crude contract climbed to
$90.57/bbl Jan. 18 after the White House announced a tax package aimed at stimulating the troubled US economy. Investors had little faith in the stimulus package, but
traders found lower price bargains. Energy prices fell earlier as the Energy Information Administration reported a larger-than-expected build in US crude inventories—
the ﬁrst gain in 9 weeks. Crude inventories increased 4.3 million bbl to 287.1 million
bbl in the week ended Jan. 11. Gasoline stocks gained 2.2 million bbl to 215.3 million
bbl and distillate fuel inventories were up 1.1 million bbl to 129.8 million bbl. “The
market is signaling that the demand side of the energy equation is much more
important than the supply side,” said Raymond James & Associates Inc. “It does now
look as if the long seasonal build in US crude oil inventories has ﬁnally started,” said
Paul Horsnell at Barclays Capital Inc., London. “The mechanics of the rebound in inventories in the latest data are fairly straightforward; reﬁnery runs moved to a morenormal seasonal level in falling dramatically by 760,000 b/d, while imports rose by
580,000 b/d. That is a combined swing of a huge 1.34 million b/d, but despite that the
patterns do not seem particularly abnormal.” Cushing, Okla., crude inventories “fell
from their already low levels, but should still rise seasonally, if erratically, from here
without threatening to spearhead any move towards a signiﬁcant contango,” he said.
Jakob said, “The supportive strength of the US market in 2007 has not come from
strong demand but from capacity constraints and especially from reﬁneries having
great difﬁculties restarting from their maintenance schedule. As we enter the US
reﬁnery maintenance cycle, crude oil stocks should start their seasonal rebuilding,
but products will be exposed to the reﬁnery restart risk.” The market also apparently
was inﬂuenced by President George W. Bush’s recent visit to Saudi Arabia where he
urged King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz al-Saud to increase oil production to ease energy
prices. However, Horsnell said, “A ramping up of pressure on the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries from external leaders often tends not to facilitate
decision making.” OPEC members are scheduled to meet Feb. 1. Horsnell said, “The
change in the information available to ministers since their last meeting Dec. 5
would not seem to justify an increase. In other words, if they could not sanction an
increase before, it will be harder to sanction an increase this time.”
Energy prices
UBS Securities LLC, New York, lowered its 2008 and 2009 composite spot natural
gas forecasts to $7.25/MMbtu and $7.60/MMbtu, respectively, from $8/MMbtu and
$8.25/MMbtu, respectively, based on the following:
• Stronger-than-expected US gas production growth [an estimated 2.5% in 2008],
primarily from increased production from the Barnett shale in Texas.
• US gas storage volumes that are well above historical levels.
• Warmer-than-normal weather this winter.
• A slowdown in US economic growth.
“Canadian imports have held steady to date despite reduced drilling activity, adding to the storage surplus,” said Ronald J. Barone, managing director of UBS Securities. “With half the winter behind us, weather has been 6.1% warmer than normal.
The aggregate supply growth has been somewhat offset by stronger-than-expected
demand, but it has not been enough to reduce the storage surplus to a level that
will support a natural gas price in excess of $8/MMBtu. As always, weather remains
a wildcard.” UBS raised its 2008 and 2009 West Texas Intermediate crude price
forecasts to $85/bbl from $74/bbl in 2008 and to $78/bbl from $73.25/bbl in 2009,
however, as a result of greater-than-expected tightening of market fundamentals in
the fourth quarter of 2007, “which drained crude oil inventories,” and “a slower-thanexpected economic deceleration in the US economy.”

IDEAS PEOPLE WANTED
ENGINEERS / WORLDWIDE
Ever asked yourself how fish swim in sub-zero waters without freezing? We did. That’s
how we came up with the idea for a new chemical that stops hydrate plugs forming in
our deepwater pipes – based on a protein that engulfs ice crystals inside the fish’s body.
Fresh thinking, innovation, even leaps of imagination are part of our daily lives at Shell.
And we're always looking for creative people to help us tackle the world's biggest energy
challenges. Some call it engineering. We call it creative problem-solving.
Real energy solutions for the real world.

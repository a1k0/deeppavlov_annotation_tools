COVER
The megamerge of almost 4,000 sq miles in 10 previously
separate South Louisiana Gulf Coast 3D seismic surveys has
provided Swift Energy Co., Houston, with a regionally uniform
proprietary database in a premier US producing region. Drilling
below 16,000 ft in the area is sparse. An article on p. 34 in OGJ’s
Applied Geophysics special report describes the company’s exploration effort. Images courtesy of Swift Energy.

Chavez vows to expand gas, oil production
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said his government is
“launching the socialist gas revolution,” claiming that Venezuela
possesses “80% of South America’s gas reserves” and “30% of the
gas reserves in the Americas.”
He said Sept. 16 that his administration would invest $18 billion to expand natural gas production to 11 bcfd from the current
7 bcfd over the next 5 years.
Touting his country’s assets, Chavez said Venezuela has proved
gas reserves of 150 tcf onshore and 30 tcf offshore.
Meanwhile, the Venezuelan leader said his government also
plans to increase the country’s production of crude oil to “5 million b/d in 2012,” up from the current 3.2 million b/d.
“We’ll take it there on pace with prices because for us it’s more
important to maintain the correct price of oil than to flood the
market,” said Chavez, who added that the world is entering an energy crisis because “oil is running out.”

APEC: Growth requires diversiﬁed energy mix
Foreign and trade ministers at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
Forum Sept. 6 called for ensuring a “diversified mix of energy sources,”
including nuclear energy, in order to pursue the region’s long-term economic growth, while reducing dependence on fossil fuels.
In a joint statement issued after their recent 2-day meeting in
Sydney, the ministers said the diversified mix includes “the use of
natural gas, biofuels from sustainably farmed crops and residues,
renewable energy, and nuclear energy for interested economies.”
“We recognized the importance of achieving oil security, including through improving data sharing,” they said. “Climate
change, energy security, and clean development are of vital interest
to APEC economies.”
The ministers agreed on “the important role of market-based solutions in mobilizing economy-wide efforts to address energy security and achieve sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.”
APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea,
Taiwan, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam.

ExxonMobil seeking arbitration for Cerro Negro
ExxonMobil Corp. has filed a request for arbitration over Venezuela’s nationalization of the Cerro Negro heavy oil project.

Exploration

&

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

The firm, which filed the arbitration request with the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes, held a 41.67%
interest in the project before Venezuela expropriated it in June.
The appropriation resulted from a nationalization decree issued
by Venezuela’s President Hugo Chavez earlier this year.
Venezuela took majority control of the country’s privately run
oil projects on May 1 and gave the companies until June 26 to decide to accept new terms as junior partners.
ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips rejected the offer, while Chevron Corp., BP PLC, Total SA, and Statoil ASA accepted.
Venezuela’s tax authority Seniat recently said it had received or
been promised payments from two state-dominated joint venture
firms after imposing large back-tax bills on recently nationalized
heavy oil development projects, including Cerro Negro (OGJ Online, Sept. 6, 2007).

Unions push safety look into Shell operations
The UK Health and Safety Executive should investigate Royal
Dutch Shell PLC’s safety operations in the North Sea because its
change management process is affecting safety on the assets it
plans to sell, charges UK trade unions Unite and the Oil Industry
Liaison Committee.
Shell union employees complain that there is poor communication from the company regarding the sale of the Cormorant AlphaDunlin Alpha and the Tern, Eider, and North Cormorant installations. In a letter to senior managers, offshore staff said as a result
of recent departures attributable to the prolonged nature of the
divestment issue, “Many platforms areas are now not fully covered
by trained and competent people, and certain HSE safety critical
roles are not fully supported.
According to the unions, positions lacking adequate staff are
control room operators, shift supervisors (process), instrumentation technical custodians and responsible persons (electrical), and
reportedly a lack of suitably trained Fire Team Leaders.
The unions said that as key personnel have left in protest at
treatment they received, gaps appeared in critical safety positions,
which could leave those left behind unable to cope in emergency
situations. The unions want to know if Shell can comply with the
safety elements of PFEER (prevention of fire and explosion, and
emergency response) Regulations 1995 for offshore installations.
Shell staff members also are unhappy that the company has discontinued its “preferred HR principals for divestment and acquisition”
system that it has used for 8 years when selling other assets. ✦

NOC launched the round on July 8 to award foreign energy
companies gas exploration licenses for 41 blocks, with offers to
be submitted by Aug. 22 and successful bidders to be announced
on Dec. 9.
NOC expected to award about 12 natural gas exploration contracts for the 41 blocks, which cover a total area of 72,500 sq km.
Libya’s gas reserves are estimated at 1.314 trillion cu m and its
proved oil reserves are 36 billion bbl, according to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
In May, Libya signed a $900 million exploration deal with BP,
under which BP will explore an area of some 54,000 sq km, primarily for gas, but also in the hope of finding oil.

Centurion Petroleum ﬁnds oil in southern Egypt
Centurion Petroleum Corp. has discovered oil in southern Egypt
with the Baraka-1 exploration well, the company reported on Sept.
4. Testing of the Early Cretaceous Abu Ballas formation produced
150 b/d of oil from a 39 ft perforated interval.
The recovered oil was 37° gravity, with a wax content similar to
the crude oil currently produced and exported in large quantities
in Sudan. The well, which was drilled in the Komombo Concession in Upper Egypt, reached a TD of 8,712 ft and penetrated several oil-bearing zones. Baraka tested different volumes of oil from
three additional intervals in the deeper early Cretaceous section.
The company is calculating the size of the reserves and potential
productivity.
The find could affect the economic development of Upper
Egypt, which is outside of the country’s traditional producing areas. Dana Gas, the parent of Centurion Petroleum, plans to bring
the oil on production as early as possible using existing transportation and refining facilities. It also will continue an aggressive exploration and appraisal program in the area.
The Komombo concession is 700 km from Cairo and 320 km
from the closest refinery at Assiut. Early oil production from this

gas was produced through a restricted 72⁄64-in. choke.
Chiswick has been tied back to the Venture-operated Markham
J6A platform. The reservoir quality and well production performance are “in line with expectations,” Venture said. The well is expected to reach gross production rates of 55-60 MMcfd through
the platform facilities following completion of the ongoing cleanup program, the company said.
Commercial gas production is expected to start at the end of
September after the current Markham field annual shutdown is finished.
The Noble Kolskya jack up drilled the Chiswick Alpha well
(49/4a-C1y) for Venture during the first half of this year. During
August it carried out five hydraulic fracture procedures to maximize gas deliverability from the field.
Venture plans to drill a second development well, Chiswick
Gamma, using the same rig. It also is considering drilling another
three wells on the field to target incremental reserves on the Gamma block and the undrilled Beta block, depending on performance
from the first two wells.

Norsk Hydro takes 10% equity in ONGC’s KG block

Norway’s Norsk Hydro AS has taken a 10% participating farmin stake in Oil & Natural Gas Corp.’s KG-DWN-98/2 deepwater
block in the Krishna-Godavari basin off eastern India.
Hydro may increase the stake by another 10% after commerciality is shown.
The agreement is the follow-up of a development and cooperation agreement the companies signed in July in which an investment cap of $26 million was established during the appraisal
phase.
Hydro also is working with ONGC for thin-oil-ream exploitation in Vasai East, near Mumbai—one area identified in the earlier
agreement.
In addition, the Norwegian firm has expressed interest in assuming a participating interest in additional New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) blocks as well. ONGC has 32 offshore blocks

Production

Hydro begins Ormen Lange gas production
Development operator Norsk Hydro AS has started natural gas
production from giant Ormen Lange field on the Norwegian continental shelf, with deliveries via the Langeled pipeline. Ormen
Lange will meet as much as 20% of the UK’s gas needs.
The field, expected to supply 70 million cu m/day of gas and
50,000 b/d of condensate at peak rate, will position Norway as the
world’s second-largest gas exporter after Russia.
Hydro is testing production from the field in the North Sea
about 120 km from the Norwegian coastline, until the inaugural
ceremony on Oct. 6, so gas flows may vary.
From a depth of 800-1,100 m, the gas is transported by pipe8

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

line through demanding subsea terrain to Nyhamna on the island
of Gossen in the municipality of Aukra in More and Romsdal. After
being processed, the gas will be sent through the 1,200 km Langeled subsea pipeline to Easington on England’s east coast.
Norway currently is the world’s third largest gas exporter, delivering 85 billion cu m/year. When Ormen Lange reaches plateau
production in 2010, total gas exports from Norway will increase to
120 billion cu m/year, or 20% of Europe’s gas requirements.
Royal Dutch Shell PLC will assume operatorship from Hydro
on Dec. 1.

CNPC increases drilling forecast for 2007
China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC) has announced plans to
drill 17% more horizontal wells in 2007 than originally planned in
order to increase production from both mature and newer fields.
CNPC said it completed drilling 610 horizontal wells by the end
of August, exceeding its original full-year target of 600. The staterun firm said it was encouraged to step up the number of horizontal wells to 700 this year because of recent success at Sichuan.
It said that last month’s output from a horizontal well in a Sichuan field was 20 times greater than that of a neighboring vertical
well. In 2006, the company drilled 522 horizontal wells, equal to
the total number it drilled in 2000-05.

Petrobras commissions Piranema FPSO unit
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva officially launched
the Piranema floating production, storage, and offloading unit,
chartered from Sevan Marine and anchored off the Sergipe coast.
The unit’s hull was built at the Yantai-Raffles shipyard in China
and then transported to the Keppel Verolme shipyard in the Netherlands, where the oil and gas production processing plant was
installed.
The unit, which is capable of producing as much as 30,000 b/d
of oil and storing 300,000 bbl of oil, is the world’s first circular
FPSO unit and will interconnect a total of six wells at maximum
depths of 1,450 m.
Recently Sevan said Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) revised
the schedule of start up of oil production from Piranema field because of normal delays in the completion of operations. Petrobras
signed the charter agreement with Sevan in February 2004.
Declared commercial in August 2004, Piranema field is in deep
waters, 35 km off Aracaju, the capital of Sergipe state, and will
produce 44º gravity oil.

deepwater developments off Brazil.
The first contract covers engineering, procurement, installation,
and commissioning of a rigid flowline that will connect Canapu
oil and gas field in 1,700 m of water in the Espirito Santos basin to
the Ciadade de Victoria floating production, storage, and offloading
vessel anchored in 1,400 m of water. This 21-km flowline will be
the first application of pipe-in-pipe (PIP) technology for subsea
gas transportation in Brazil. Technip’s Deep Blue deepwater pipelay
vessel will install the flowline during fourth quarter 2008.
Intec Engineering earlier this year completed the front-end engineering design for the PIP flowline (OGJ Online, Apr. 4, 2007).
The second contract comprises engineering and procurement
of 37 km of 4-in. and 6-in. flexible flowlines for Mexilhao gas field
in the Santos basin. The reservoirs in Mexilhao have high pressures
and temperatures. The 6-in. flowlines have been specially designed
to cope with extreme temperature and pressure of the carried fluids.
The third contract includes engineering and procurement of
four large-diameter flexible risers for the Campos basin oil outflow
and treatment plan (PDET) that will be installed in 1,300 m of
water in the Campos basin. The PDET export system is designed to
increase oil production in Campos basin by as much as 630,000
b/d (OGJ Online, Oct. 20, 2005).

EDC lets contract for jack up construction

Egyptian Drilling Co. (EDC) has let a contract to SembCorp Marine subsidiary PPL Shipyard to build a $201 million Baker Marine
Pacific Class 375 (BMC Pacific 375) jack up.
Construction is expected to start in the third quarter with delivery slated for December 2009.
The rig will be built based on PPL’s proprietary BMC Pacific
375 Deep Drilling design and will be equipped with a drilling
package capable of drilling high-pressure, high-temperature wells

Sinclair Tulsa plans reﬁnery expansion
Sinclair Tulsa Refining Co. plans a major expansion of its 70,000
b/d Tulsa refinery. The company said recent changes in federal and
state tax law have been an encouraging factor in its decision.
The expansion project is expected to increase the facility’s output of ultralow-sulfur gasoline and diesel. A net reduction in actual
refinery emissions, also could be realized after the expansion is
completed, Sinclair said.
Three major components are involved in the project. These include the facility’s refining capacity, which will be increased by
45,000 b/d to 115,000 b/d; a new delayed coker unit, which will
be added to increase refinery output of gasoline and diesel; and
modifications to the plant to enable processing of a wider range of
oil, including heavy, sour crude.
The delayed coker unit will use odor and particulate control

technology that has been successfully demonstrated in California.
Sinclair recently applied to the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality for an air quality construction permit for the
expansion project. The application indicates the expansion will
be below the Prevention of Significant Deterioration significance
thresholds for all criteria pollutants.
Assuming ODEQ approves the permit, construction work could
begin in 2008, with project completion expected in 2011.
Sinclair also plans to install a flare gas recovery system to minimize flaring.
In addition, the company proposes to treat refinery wastewater
to an acceptable level for discharging into Tulsa’s treatment system.

affiliate of Shell Global Solutions International BV to revamp the
visbreaker unit at the 300,000 b/cd Sarroch refinery in Sardinia,
Italy.
The unit will be upgraded to use Shell GSI’s deep thermal conversion technology, which will allow the refinery to process heavier crudes.
Saras and Shell GSI are working alongside ABB Lummus Global,
one of Shell’s authorized licensors, and have scheduled delivery of
the project by the end of September.
The visbreaker license agreement follows the revamp of the
refinery’s hydrocracker in March.
The Sarroch refinery has recently undergone a maintenance cycle involving shutdown of a crude distillation unit, a vacuum unit,
and now the visbreaking unit. As a result, refinery runs have been
reduced by about 10% from normal levels, Saras said.

struggle between Algiers and Madrid over control. Media reports
said Sonatrach blamed the companies for cost overruns and delays.
Repsol YPF and Gas Natural plan to launch international arbitral
proceedings against Sonatrach, protesting that the project had been
taken “through illegitimate means.” They will seek damages and
determination of whether the contract had been rightfully terminated.
This was the first project in Algeria to be awarded to a foreign
consortium. However, to exert greater control over its national resources, Algeria within the past 18 months passed a law requiring
Sonatrach to maintain a 51% stake in energy projects.
Sonatrach’s decision leaves the Spanish companies without access to huge reserves and supply contracts after they beat stiff competition to win the lucrative tender in 2004. For Repsol in particular, the effect is galling, as the company was also forced to revise

Pemex brings gas line back in service
Mexico’s Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) resumed natural gas
transportation Sept. 17 through its 48-in. Cactus-San Fernando
pipeline.
The firm said it expected to have service completely restored by
Sept. 18 on the network that was put off line by guerrilla bombs at
Delicias, Rio Actopan, and Rio La Antigua.
Pemex said the attacks did not result in any casualties, but it cut
power to more than 2,000 businesses in 10 states, according to figures from the Canacintra industrial association. The shutdown cost
those firms about $100 million/day, Canacintra reported.
The Ejercito Popular Revolucionario (EPR), a secretive Marxist
group that killed dozens of Mexican police and soldiers in the late
1990s, claimed responsibility for the attacks.
EPR said it bombed the pipeline to force the release of EPR militants it alleges were arrested by the government May 25. Mexican
officials say the rebels are not in custody.
EPR says Edmundo Reyes Amaya, Raymundo Rivera Bravo, and
Gabriel Alberto Cruz Sanchez have not been seen since their arrest. EPR wants them back and apparently has been bombing the
country’s oil and gas pipelines for that purpose.
In the latest attacks, one bomb was discovered intact, with a
note attached. “Alive you took them, alive we want them back,” in
an apparent reference to the missing EPR militants.
The rebel group has warned of more attacks if its missing members are not returned unharmed.

The first two carriers—the Al Gattara built by Hyundai Heavy
Industries Co. Ltd. and the Tembek built by Samsung Heavy Industries in Geoje Island, South Korea—are scheduled to be delivered
at the end of October.
Deliveries for the remaining vessels are expected in early 2008.
The Q-Flex LNG carriers can transport 216,000 cu m of LNG
each, about 40% more than the standard LNG vessels currently in
service. They are equipped with an onboard reliquefaction plant.
In addition, the vessels have lower energy requirements than
conventional LNG vessels due to economies of scale created by
their size and the efficiency of low-emission, electronically controlled diesel engines. Safety features include dual propellers and
rudders.
Nakilat last year added six Q-Max LNG carriers to its fleet,
which is expected to comprise 61 carriers by 2010 (OGJ, June 5,
2006, Newsletter).

Vietnam reﬁning industry gets oil supply deal

Petrovietnam Trading Co., an affiliate of Vietnam Oil & Gas
Group (PVN), has signed an agreement with the Trafigura Group
of the Netherlands to supply oil for Vietnam’s refining industry for
30 years and to cooperate in building oil storage facilities, transporting oil to refineries, and shipping oil and products.
State media reported that PVN also is considering investing in
a 9 million tonne/year refinery and petrochemical complex in
northern Vietnam, and a 10 million tonne/year facility and petrochemical complex in southern Vietnam.

Jonah mitigation science

Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
Oil and gas operators acknowledge the
need to restore or create wildlife and plant
habitat to counterbalance what has been
lost to drilling and development.
Wyoming’s Jonah gas field operators
are no exception as they recruit scientific advice on ways to improve backcountry settings around Pinedale, Wyo.
Jonah field drilling has disrupted
pronghorn migration routes and destroyed wintering grounds and breeding sites for greater sage grouse.
Mitigation is a way of compensating for what was lost to energy development. Mitigation can occur on a
development site (onsite mitigation) or
elsewhere (offsite mitigation).
A key question concerning offsite mitigation is where and when it can be used.
Jonah offsite mitigation involves acquiring nearby acreage to be preserved
for use by the pronghorns and sage
grouse.
Other offsite mitigation practices
could include removing invasive plants
and burning certain areas to encourage
the growth of native plants.
EnCana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc., BP
America Production Co., and other
companies operating in Jonah field
provided $24.5 million in offsite mitigation funds. The federal government
manages much of Jonah field’s surface
and mineral rights.
BP America provided a grant to Nature Conservancy scientists who are developing a regional framework to help
the Jonah Interagency Reclamation and
Mitigation Office (JIO) with decisions
about allocating the mitigation funds.

The JIO considers proposals from
various conservation organizations seeking financing. The JIO includes representatives from the Wyoming Department
of Environmental Quality, Wyoming
Department of Agriculture, Wyoming
Game and Fish Department, and the US
Bureau of Land Management.

Conservation science
Conservancy scientists are working
on a methodology to develop specific
conservation goals to be used as guidance for the JIO’s distribution of the
Jonah mitigation money.
Joe Kiesecker, the conservancy’s
lead scientist in Wyoming, said similar
methodology eventually might be applied to other regional fields.
“Mitigation of energy development can no longer be an afterthought.
Before development occurs, industry
needs to look at the site and plan to
avoid sensitive areas,” Kiesecker said.
Oil companies are uncomfortable
agreeing to finance offsite mitigation
without a plan guiding the mitigation,
he said.
BP invited the conservancy’s involvement in Jonah field, he said. Since
1978, BP and its affiliates have contributed $8 million to the conservancy.
For Jonah, scientists used informa-

tion from environmental impact statements and looked at lists of biological
targets. They overlaid species-specific
habitat maps with maps of Jonah field.
The process is aimed at setting goals
for the number and distribution of conservation targets in specific areas.
An important factor of offsite mitigation is the method of selecting suitable
offset sites. Scientists used a Marxan
model to select areas representing the
biology of Jonah field.
Marxan is a tool for landscape conservation analysis that explicitly incorporates
spatial design criteria into site selection.
The scientists acquired and developed maps of the species and habitat
identified on Jonah. The species are
the burrowing owl, cedar rim thistle,
mountain plover, pronghorn, pygmy
rabbit, sage grouse, sage sparrow,
white-tailed prairie dog, and Wyoming
big sagebrush.
The species-habitats information
was plugged into the Marxan model.
Scientists also used predictive models to
estimate the acreage of impacted habitat
and to search for suitable offset sites for
mitigation.

BLM decision

The BLM issued a Jonah infill drilling project record of decision in March
2006 following analysis of a final environmental impact statement. The FEIS
analysis said onsite mitigation efforts
were inadequate.
That decision resulted in the formation of mitigation funds.
The BLM said site-specific mitigation
measures can be applied throughout a
project.
Upon completion, all wells would be
plugged and abandoned, surface facilities would be removed, and remaining
disturbed areas (with the exception of

Biofuels meet doubt
Finally, the worldwide biofuels frenzy has
encountered quasi-official doubt. Even better, the
doubt emerged in a forum dedicated to sustainable development.
“Biofuels: Is the Cure Worse than the Disease?”
asks the title of a paper issued this month by the
Round Table on Sustainable Development at the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Paris. Attention to the question is
overdue.
Countries around the world seem determined
to join the US as it jumps over the biofuels cliff. The
US government, of course, has installed a generous
system of tax credits, tariffs, and sales mandates to
expand markets for fuel ethanol and biodiesel. The
supposed reasons are to extend supplies of vehicle
fuel, moderate air pollution, and reduce emissions of
greenhouse gases. The real reason is to enrich grain
growers, distillers, and biodiesel makers.
Political motives behind the US biofuels push
haven’t discouraged governments elsewhere, including Europe and China, from lavishing biofuels with
incentives of their own. The US isn’t the only country
in which agriculture exerts strong political force.

Support and promise
Richard Doornbosch and Ronald Steenblik,
who wrote the OECD group’s paper, usefully relate
government support to a reasonable assessment of
biofuels’ promise. “Biofuels may well play a part
in expanding the range of energy sources available
in the future,” they write, noting that the role will
depend largely on feedstock and production costs.
“But in view of the fact that even the most optimistic studies posit no more than 13% of liquid
fuel needs in 2050 being supplied by biofuels, it
must be asked whether the diversion of such large
amounts of public funds in support of this single
technological option can be justified.”
The projection they cite comes from the
International Energy Agency. The authors call it
realistic but possibly optimistic. They note that
conventional ethanol and biodiesel are considered
technically able to expand their combined share of
the market to 11% in 2050 from 1% in 2005. But
such growth would have “significant impacts on
the wider global economy,” including the elevation of food prices already in evidence.
Second-generation technologies, such as etha-

nol from cellulose, are considered technically able
to meet 12% of liquid-fuel needs by 2050. But
they depend on uncertain technical development
and must overcome the costs of moving biomass
to large production plants. “This leads some to
believe that the second-generation biofuels will
remain niche players, produced mainly in plants
where the residue material is already available in
situ, such as bagasse (cellulosic residue from sugarcane processing) and wood-process residues,”
Doornbosch and Steenblik write.
The authors challenge environmental arguments made in support of biofuels. They cite
land-use strains and increased fertilization associated with expanded production of biomass
feedstocks. And they argue that substantial cuts in
greenhouse-gas emissions come only from ethanol
produced with sugarcane or as a byproduct of cellulose production and from biodiesel made from
animal fat and used cooking oil.
The paper further challenges the efficiency of
government policies encouraging and protecting
domestic production of biofuels. Usage mandates or
blending percentages and fuel-tax preferences usually
don’t account for differences in environmental costs
and benefits among various feedstocks and production methods. Those differences can be great, the
paper notes, adding, “This implies that governments
could end up supporting a fuel that is more expensive and has a higher negative environmental impact
than its corresponding petroleum product.”

Costs high
As greenhouse-gas reducers and petroleum
substitutes, biofuels are expensive, the authors say.
They estimate the cost of reducing greenhouse-gas
emissions through US subsidies of corn-base ethanol at “well over” $500/tonne of carbon dioxide
equivalent avoided. And in terms of displacing
fossil fuels, they say, “In most cases the use of
biofuels roughly doubles the cost of transportation
energy for consumers and taxpayers together.”
More withering words such as these fill the report’s 57 pages. They leave no doubt that the OECD’s
Round Table on Sustainable Development judges the
rush to biofuels to be environmentally and economically unsustainable. As evidence mounts of high costs
and false promises, the craze should prove to be
politically unsustainable as well. ✦

made clear that the evolution of geophysical technology guides his thinking on a range of subjects, including
integration of oil-field operations and
data, interdisciplinary training, and
communicating—to the oil and gas
industry and beyond—what his profession can do.
“It is our responsibility to make
sure that we convey the correct image
regarding what we do, what type of
thing we offer, what type of major impact that we can make and are making,
whether it is reducing finding costs, or
whether it is reducing production costs or placement
of wells,” he says.

In the assessment of
reserves and resources,
Aminzadeh says, modern
geophysical methods reduce
uncertainty about the four
main risk factors: structure,
reservoir, seal, and charge.
Three-dimensional seismic techniques, for example,
greatly improve the precision
and accuracy of interpretations of reservoir structure,
including depth, shape, and
lateral extent, Aminzadeh
notes.
And interpretation based on amplitude variation with offset (AVO) and
other seismic attributes has become an
effective way to address reservoir risk.
AVO makes use of differences in the
reflection signal strength that occur as
distances vary between shot and receiver points (offsets). Analysis of those
changes can yield reservoir information
such as lithology and fluid content.

Dynamic characterization
In the field, seismic applications have
advanced beyond the static analysis of
reservoirs to what Aminzadeh calls “dynamic reservoir characterization.”
Four-dimensional (sequential 3D)
surveys can show “not only what the
reservoir looks like and what its properties are right now but how it is evolving
through time,” he explains.
The value of 4D seismic acquisition and interpretation points toward
“the instrumented oil field,” in which
companies leave seismic geophones
or hydrophones in place for multiple
surveys.
While the technology has been applied in a few, mostly offshore fields,
the instrumented oil field “is not as
common as you would like it to be,”
Aminzadeh says. “In today’s economic

gravity data.”

Integrating disciplines
Additional complementary data
come from operations other than geophysical work and from professionals
other than geophysicists.
This fusion of various data types
requires the intelligent integration of disciplines, according to the new SEG chief.
“Geophysicists by themselves can’t
do the job,” he says. “Geologists by
themselves can’t do the job, geochemists, well log analysts, petroleum engineers....”
In a 1996 article in the Journal of
Petroleum Science and Engineering,
Aminzadeh proposed that the disciplines of geoscientists and engineers be
integrated, rather than simple data integration, in the manner that their work
was being integrated in the early stages
of exploration and production.
“We will be forced to bring down
the walls we have built around classical
disciplines such as petroleum engineering, geology, geophysics, and geochemistry or at the very least make them
more permeable,” he wrote.
More than 10 years on, some of
those walls remain.
“In order to make this integration
work, you need to have a group of people that have some reasonable knowledge of other disciplines,” Aminzadeh
says. Achievement of that aim requires
adaptation of the educational system.
Medical schools provide a model.
“They train generalists before they
go to a specialty,” he says. “We probably
should take a page from their book and
try to train for some more general-purpose type work for industry professionals, which I call ‘geo-engineer.’ This has
already started happening.”
Aminzadeh relates integration of
disciplines and interdisciplinary education to his appeal for refinement of the
image that geophysics projects to other
oil and gas professionals, regulators,
and a public needing energy.
“The best way to get the image right
is to train people,” he says. And training

about energy—and the technology and
people that produce it—should start early.
“If we are serious about energy
independence and making sure that we
have energy for future generations then
we need to have investment in education from very early on, including from
high school.”

Future methods
Aminzadeh sees geophysical methods advancing on a number of fronts—
some pushing them further into operations in which they haven’t been used
much, if at all, before.
The acquisition of seismic data during drilling, for example, can improve
targeting and identify overpressured
zones ahead of the bit. Aminzadeh
holds the patent for a method of guiding oscillating wellbores during drilling
with seismic data from energy generated by the drillbit and recorded by
geophones in the well being drilled or
in a nearby well.
Improvements are still needed in the
imaging of geologic strata below salt,
basalt, and other hard rocks, he notes.
Research has yielded solutions to some
of the sonic-velocity problems that
confound the positioning of reflections below complex structures. Further
improvements might come from
surveys that use “very, very large offsets
to shoot underneath these otherwise
impermeable [salt] boundaries.”
Another area ripe for further improvement is imaging of fractures and
“a better understanding of hydrocarbon-bearing fractures vs. closed fractures,” Aminzadeh says.
Unconventional oil and gas resources
represent an area in which “geophysicists have a big role to play.” The SEG
president says, “Our members need to
push the limits of application areas of
their technologies outside the conventional resources.”
Emerging microseismic techniques
might help with the imaging of fractures and unconventional reservoirs,
such as tight shales and coalbed methane. In microseismic work, geophones

Career highlights
Fred Aminzadeh is president and chief executive ofﬁcer of dGB-USA,
Sugar Land, Tex., and president of the Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

Employment
Aminzadeh has held his current position with dGB-USA since 1999.
Before joining dGB he worked 17 years with Unocal Corp. in various
positions, including manager of geophysical technology. He has written
11 books and holds many patents. He has been an adjunct professor at
Rice University and a consultant to several US national laboratories.

Education
He holds a PhD in geophysics from the University of Southern California. His dissertation was on elastic wave modeling, with applications in
AVO and elastic impedance calculation.

Afﬁliations
Aminzadeh has been a member of SEG for 30 years and is a past chairman of the SEG Research Committee and vice-chairman of the Global
Affairs Committee. He served as SEG vice-president in 2001-02 and

and production.
Other trends Aminzadeh considers
important are the increased availability
of open-source software, which brings
new tools quickly to practical use.

‘Geomentoring’
With technology moving in so many
directions and with rapid demographic
changes in the industry workforce, the
new SEG president proposes a program
he calls “geomentoring.”
The age distribution of the SEG
membership has “a large hole” in the
30-45-year range, he notes.
“My vision of geomentoring is a
program that would cover a large spec-

trum: technical issues, career issues, and
many other things, including how to
become active in professional societies, how to publish, how to decide on
a career path, how to define ‘success’
for yourself, how to reach that success,
among other things,” Aminzadeh says.
“The challenge is how best to channel
the large reservoir of wisdom and experience with a strong sense of altruism that
our more senior members have to those
who can benefit from them. If successful, the result will be a self-perpetuating
fountain of geophysical knowledge.”
Aminzadeh notes that a recent SEG
investment in online capability will help
advance the vision.
“That’s one thing I’m very keen on,”
he says. ✦

Midcontinent shales
The excitement over CBM’s potential
during the 1990s has shifted to shales,
due largely to successes in the Midcontinent’s Arkoma, Anadarko, Fort Worth,
and Permian basins, PGC said. But the
formations, while prolific, can be hard
to produce. “Shale wells typically produce small volumes. A field can require
a lot of wells and a lot of infrastructure,” Curtis said.
But the potential extends to other
regions. “The Rockies are just getting
started. There could be a major increase there from shale gas in another
2 years,” said Decker. Drilling a well
to a shale formation there can cost $8
million, compared to $2-3 million for a
shallower conventional well, he said.
Gasco recently completed its first
shale gas well in Utah’s Uinta basin
with satisfactory results and one of its
competitors, Questar Resources, has

drilled four and may drill another,
Decker said.
The committee, which draws its
members from the gas industry, academia, and government agencies, does
not consider access, politics, or price in
its estimates. It does try to avoid deposits which are unlikely to be produced
for technical reasons.
“Because so many of our members
work the basins for a living, the estimates
use a realistic cost-to-production ratio.
The gas is technically recoverable, but
economies vary by company,” said Curtis.
As technology improves, however,
resources can move from being speculative to being possible or probable, he
continued. “The Powder River basin is
an excellent example. When the first
wells were drilled there, it was thought
they’d never produce. Now, after the
application of new technology, two new
wells are drilled weekly there,” he said.

Others warned that federal policy actions could increase domestic demand
for gas. “If Congress looks at carbon
constraints, it should look very carefully
at natural gas supplies. In our view, it
hasn’t,” said Chris McGill, AGA’s managing director of policy.
“The treatment of access has been
very uneven. It is a problem,” he
added. ✦

Franco-Iranian relations cool over nuclear goals
Eric Watkins
Senior Correspondent
Franco-Iranian relations appear to
have reached a turning point.
The French government reportedly is
applying pressure on Total SA and other
oil and gas firms to freeze all investments in Iran in an effort to force Teheran into giving up its uranium enrichment program and nuclear ambitions.
The daily Le Monde newspaper
reported Sept. 18 that the recommendation falls within the framework of an allegedly tougher political stance toward
the Islamic republic by French President
24

Nicolas Sarkozy.
The paper said the chief executive of
a French business group acknowledged
that the French ambassador to Iran
emphasized at a recent meeting that the
situation is “not favorable” for business. For example, the executive told
Le Monde, the Iranians had put oil and
gas exploration blocks out to auction in
August, but only Austria’s OMV group
had responded.
OMV had signed an agreement
in April with Iran’s National Oil Co.
(NIOC) for possible investment in
developing Iran’s offshore South Pars
gas field. But the US has been threaten-

ing OMV with retaliatory measures and
is trying to deter other Western and
Japanese companies from investing in
the Iranian hydrocarbons industry.
Total SA is most affected by the
changed political atmosphere. The effort
to produce and liquefy Pars gas represents seven structural projects that Total
wants to develop in 2010-30.
But the firm apparently has little
chance of successfully completing them.
“The way in which talks with Iran’s
national company are progressing does
not allow (us) to launch the project for
the moment,” a company spokesperson
said.

Total General Director Christophe de
Margerie favors reviewing the agreements, which are valued at $10 billion,
saying in early 2007, “These development costs have more than doubled,
and this is a real subject of concern for
us.”
Total, which has a 30% stake in the
projects, had planned to invest $3 billion there along with NIOC, Malaysia’s
Petronas, and a fourth partner.
Gaz de France also is interested in
the project and would invest some
$300 million, but, according to Le
Monde, France’s political instructions
are curbing its ambitions as well.
Total has been delaying its decision to invest due to concerns over the
rising dangers of the nuclear issue and
the change of attitude by the French
government. ✦

Kazakhstan also wants state-run Kazmunaigaz to be made a joint operator
of the project along with Eni.
The Kazakh government has suspended development of the Kashagan
project for 3 months, and it has threatened to extend the suspension beyond
October if the two sides cannot come
to terms.

Eni executive Paolo Scaroni met with
Kazakh Prime Minister Karim Massimov and expressed confidence that
negotiations would proceed concerning operations at the oil field. The next
day, however, Massimov said a friendly
settlement compensating for the delays
must be reached by Oct 22.

Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
plans to visit Kazakhstan next month in
an effort to resolve a disagreement over
delays and cost increases in developing
the giant Kashagan oil field.
Prodi’s office said the visit, set for
Oct. 7-9, was planned but not scheduled long before the dispute arose late
last month between the Kazakh government and Italy’s Eni SPA (OGJ Online,
Aug. 28, 2007).
Attempting to downplay any sense
of crisis, Prodi said that his trip would
deal with more than oil and that his
country and Kazakhstan enjoy excellent
relations.
Kazakhstan wants to increase its
share of future profits from the oil field
to 40% from 10% as compensation for
repeated delays by the Eni-led consortium in developing it.

Kazakhstan also has expressed concern over the rising estimates of the

Ahead of Prodi’s planned visit,
Kazakh lawmakers are in the process of

adopting an amendment that will allow the government to annul contracts
of strategic importance if the contract
conditions are not met and national
security or economic interests are
threatened.
Kazakh lawmaker Valeriy Kotovich
said the amendment, for which the

Judge tosses California vehicle emissions lawsuit
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
A US district judge in San Francisco
has quashed California’s lawsuit against
major automakers regarding vehicle
emissions.
US District Judge for the Northern
District of California Martin Jenkins
ruled Sept. 17 that the state of California was trying to “punish (automakers)
for lawfully selling their automobiles.”
Jenkins said federal lawmakers—not
judges—should decide if auto manufacturers are responsible for what
California Att. Gen. Jerry Brown has
called greenhouse gas emissions-related
problems. The lawsuit sought millions
of dollars in damages, citing drought,
beach erosion, and warmer temperatures.
“The court finds that injecting itself
into the global warming thicket at this
juncture would require an initial policy
determination of the type reserved for

the political branches of government,”
Jenkins said.
He approved a motion from automakers to dismiss the case. Defendants
were General Motors Corp., Ford Motor
Co., the US division of DaimlerChrysler
AG, Toyota Motor Co., Honda North
America, and Nissan North America.
In a separate case, US District Judge
Williams Session III of Burlington, Vt.,
ruled Sept. 12 that the state of Vermont
can regulate GHG emissions from
vehicles. His ruling came in a 240-page
decision following a 16-day trial that
ended in May.
During the Vermont trial, auto industry executives testified that regulations
by Vermont, California, and other states
would not stop global warming but
would impose prohibitive costs on auto
manufacturers.
California, Vermont, and 10 other
states want to impose tougher standards
on vehicle emissions than federal regulators require. The proposed GHG laws

by states cannot take effect until the US
Environmental Protection Agency grants
a waiver requested by California under
the Clean Air Act (CAA).
The other states are Connecticut,
Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New
Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington..
The California legislature passed a
GHG law in 2002 requiring automakers to reduce vehicle emissions 30% by
2016. The state filed its request for an
EPA waiver in December 2005 and still
awaits an answer from the EPA. Approval of California’s waiver means the other
states would get approval automatically
(OGJ, June 25, 2007, p. 31).
Meanwhile on Apr. 2, the US Supreme Court ruled that the EPA has
the authority, under the CAA, to enact
limits on carbon dioxide emissions
(OGJ, Apr. 9, 2007, p. 33). That lawsuit
was filed by Massachusetts and other
states. ✦

MMS, Burlington settle gas royalty dispute
Burlington Resources Oil & Gas Co.
has agreed to pay the federal government more than $97.5 million, plus
interest, to settle several natural gas
royalty issues on federal and American
Indian lands, said the US Department
of the Interior’s Minerals Management
Service, which filed a district court
complaint against Burlington under the
False Claims Act (FCA).
26

Per the settlement agreement, the accrued interest would be for the period
of Sept. 1, 2006, until final payment is
made. This will result in a total settlement amount of slightly more than
$105 million.
“This settlement should serve as a
strong reminder that MMS will aggressively pursue all royalties due to

the government from production that
occurs on federal and American Indian
lands,” MMS Director Randall Luthi
said.
The agreement covers natural gas
production that occurred from Mar. 1,
1988, through Mar. 31, 2005, for the
improper valuation of the gas from coal
seams, and from Mar. 1, 1988, through
Dec. 31, 1997, for under-reported value

of conventional gas and natural gas
liquids.
In addition to resolving the FCA
complaint, the settlement also resolves
several “orders to pay” that MMS
had previously issued to Burlington
beginning in the 1990s. Those orders
addressed nonallowable or excessive deductions for processing and
transportation, including the cost of

removing carbon dioxide from the
gas. MMS has maintained, and recent
court rulings have affirmed, that those
costs must be paid by the company
and cannot be deducted from royalty
payments.
About $94.5 million of the settlement will be allocated to federal leases
in New Mexico, which will be split
between the federal government and

the state of New Mexico.
In addition, MMS will disburse
portions of the settlement to a federal
lease in Colorado and federal leases in
Oklahoma, to the Jicarilla Apache Nation, to the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, to
Indian mineral owners in the Concho
and Anadarko areas in Oklahoma, and
to individual Navajo mineral owners in
New Mexico. ✦

ONGC plans $30 billion investment in 2007-12
Shirish Nadkarni
OGJ Correspondent
India’s Oil & Natural Gas Corp.
(ONGC) plans to invest $30 billion
during its 11th 5-year plan (FYP) covering fiscal years ending in 2012.
This investment total is 60% more
than that of the prior FYP. It follows
ONGC’s recent offshore gas discovery
in the Krishna Godavari basin and the
success of its overseas subsidiary ONGC
Videsh Ltd. (OVL; OGJ, Jan. 15, 2007,
Newsletter).
OVL will invest 453.34 billion
rupees in the upcoming FYP, compared
with 250.52 billion rupees in the 10th
FYP. Its downstream group, Mangalore
Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd., will
invest 83.16 billion rupees, compared
with 7.65 billion rupees under the
previous plan.
The company’s fiscal 2006-07 exploratory efforts led to 22 discoveries,
of which nine were new prospects—
three deepwater, one shallow-water, and
five onshore, said R.S. Sharma, ONGC
chairman and managing director.
“A total of 88 exploratory and 178
development wells were drilled in fiscal
2006-07,” Sharma said. “We recorded
the highest in-place reserves accretion
in the last 11 years—169.52 million
tonnes of oil equivalent.” He said the
company was looking at “in-place volumes of more than 100 million tonnes”
from the discoveries.
“We are looking at production of
over 140 million tonnes of crude oil

and 112 billion cu m of gas during the
11th plan,” he said.
ONGC no longer plans to build a 3-4
million tonne/year refinery in Rajasthan, saying the project, like an earlier
dropped plan for a 7.5 million tonne/
year refinery, is not economically viable
(OGJ, July 24, 2006, Newsletter).
Gas from the Krishna-Godavari basin
is expected to start flowing in 2012.
Development plans for gas finds in
Block KG-DWN-98/2 will be complete
by yearend 2008. ONGC has made six
gas discoveries on the block, the largest being one discovered in December
2006, which holds probable in-place
reserves of 2.08 tcf.

Deepwater collaborations
ONGC is collaborating with Norsk
Hydro Production AS, Eni, British Gas,
and others—mostly for deepwater exploration and production.
Hydro will extend technical support
to develop deepwater oil and gas blocks
off India and has agreed to acquire a
participating 10% interest in ONGC’s
KG-DWN-98/2 deepwater block in

the Krishna Godavari basin on which
ONGC recently struck gas.
ONGC held that block on a nomination basis before the advent of the
New Exploration Licensing Policy
(NELP). ONGC has 32 offshore exploration blocks under NELP, with 12
in ultradeep water, 14 in deep water,
and 6 in shallow water. It holds 100%
participating interest in 12 of the 26
deepwater blocks.
An investment cap of $26 million
would be imposed during the appraisal
phase, with an option to increase the
holding by another 10%. ONGC said
Hydro may seek participating interests
in other ONGC NELP blocks once the
companies examine data during the
next 6 months.
The agreement envisages cooperation
between ONGC and Hydro in developing India’s continental shelf.
ONGC plans to utilize the expertise
of the Norwegian company on development and production from deep water
and ultradeep water and “thin oil development and production” in Vasai East,
near Bombay High. ✦

Terrorists aim

T

he al-Qaeda terrorist group,
which has long eyed ways of
interfering with the oil and gas
industry, continues to threaten world
peace. But it is hardly the only show
in town, as one expert has recently
testified.
John Robb, the author of a respected new book on terrorism, last
week warned in Oklahoma City that
extremists of the future will attack
oil refineries, natural gas pipelines,
and other targets that provide vital
systems to society.
“You can make these attacks far
removed from where we’re at, and
because of all the systems being
interconnected it will have an impact
on us,” Robb said in an interview
with the Oklahoman newspaper.
The man has earned his stripes,
too. A graduate of the US Air Force
Academy, Robb served in a tier-one
counterterrorist unit that worked
closely with Delta and Seal Team 6.
Robb participated in global operations as a mission commander, pilot,
and mission planner.

ria, Brazil, Mexico, and elsewhere,
he said, adding that small terrorist
groups are learning from each other,
using technology, and evolving their
tactics.
“Something works, everyone else
adopts it,” he said. And, not least important, he noted that, “Very seldom
do you see any of the attackers being
caught.” Sound familiar?
If not, consider the Ejercito Popular Revolucionario (EPR), a secretive
Marxist group that killed dozens of
police and soldiers in the late 1990s.
It’s back at work in Mexico, and its
work is causing havoc to the country’s oil and gas industry.

The EPR strikes

On Sept. 10, the EPR hit the
Mexican economy hard when it set
off six explosions in Veracruz which
damaged a dozen gas pipelines and
one oil duct, temporarily halting
industrial activity in 10 states and
causing hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.

SEC alleges stock fraud
US District Judge Barbara M.G. Lynn
of the Northern District of Texas issued
the order and freeze Sept. 12 against
Terax Energy Inc. of Dallas, Westar Oil
Inc. of Beverly Hills, Calif., and Mark
Roy Anderson. SEC also ordered a 10day suspension of Terax’s stock, which
trades on the over-the-counter bulletin
board.
In its complaint, SEC alleged that Anderson gained control of Terax in April.
Soon after, the company issued several
press releases, which the SEC said were
false and misleading, regarding Terax’s
oil and gas operations and the company’s stock price increase to as much as
$4.88/share from 30¢/share.
SEC also alleged that Anderson conducted a fraudulent private placement
of $1 million of Westar’s common stock
and made false claims about its oil and
gas operations and plans to exchange
Westar stock for Terax stock.
SEC said it is seeking permanent
injunctions against and civil fines from
Terax, Westar, Anderson, as well as

Flagship Media Sponsors:

The oil sands of Alberta are undergoing an investment boom worth more than
$100 billion. From 2007 to 2016, the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board
(EUB) projects total real investment in Alberta’s oil sands (surface mining,
upgrading, in situ, and support services to reach Canadian $118 billion.
Output from oil sands is set to rise from about 1.2 million barrels a day to
an expected 3 million b/d by 2016, and perhaps 4 million plus by 2020.
That could make Canada the world’s fourth-biggest oil producer after Saudi
Arabia, Russia and the United States.
Today’s oil pricing levels have made extraction of oil from oil sands much
more attractive than in the past. The reserves in Alberta will support
production for a least the next century. Canada is the new frontier in nonOPEC oil developments.
Don’t miss this opportunity to present your expertise to a powerful, inﬂuential
audience. Join PennWell Petroleum Events in this second year conference and
exhibition. As the boom continues, share your ideas, experiences, technology,
and expertise with major industry players who must react quickly to the rapid
expansion. Plan to present a technical paper at the the second annual Oil Sands
and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition, July 15 – 17, 2008, at
the Calgary TELUS Convention Centre in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

Southern Louisiana is one of the
most prolific petroleum provinces of
the world. Proven plays have produced
billions of barrels of oil and continue to
provide sustainable opportunities for a
broad cross section of the industry.
Even with all that has been produced, significant reserve adds for
exploration and development companies are available in this region through

a range of workflows from complex
reservoir remediation projects in older
fields to conventional new field wildcat exploration activity adjacent to and
below existing production.
These efforts yield better results
when the geoscience and engineering
professionals can actually see what they
are attempting to exploit. At Swift Energy, seismic and depth imaging of the

aged before, has “created new geography” to develop and explore.
The Northern Gulf of Mexico basin
margin, including the area of presentday South Louisiana, during the Late
Cretaceous through Tertiary, can best
be characterized as an unstable, rapidly
subsiding, progradational, terrigenous
clastic passive margin. The depositional
environments and trapping configurations are heavily influenced by gravity
and salt withdrawal tectonics.
Regional source rocks underlie the
entire area, and complex burial history
including broad areas of salt driven
basin “downbuilding” create aggradational stacks of reservoirs from shallow
depths to well beyond present depths
of well penetrations. The predominantly
vertical flux of migrating hydrocarbons
provides pervasive charge to reservoirs
in developed trapping geometries. These
are all viewed much more clearly with
imaging technology available today, and
thus become “new geography.”
At Swift Energy, we believe the pursuit of “material” reserve growth does
not require a move into deep water or
politically unstable business environments outside the US. While creating
new geography, we have armed our oil
and gas professionals with state of the
art data and a leading edge analytical
toolkit. 3D-based seismic depth imaging technology coupled with sound
petroleum systems science is leading
the way toward realization of a robust,
sustainable opportunity set.

Successful exploration strategies are
based on the premise that maximum
value and leverage are created when a
company is successful in a new basin or
new play by accessing a dominant acreage position early in new play development.
Following recognition, access, and
the initial testing of new play systems,
early activity is the high-value growth
phase (typically the first 5 years) during
which the largest fields in the play trend
tend to be found.

discovered, value can still be added,
but generally at a progressively lower
rate, as the field reserves remaining to
be proven diminish in size. This second
phase of play maturation is currently
taking place in the deepwater Gulf of
Mexico. During this phase, companies
can fall into a trap of overinvesting
in proven plays and begin to destroy
value. In other words, capital expenditures chasing reserves in these
so-called “nonmaterial” areas begin to
exceed the value of the reserves they
are adding.
The budgets of most exploration
companies reflect broad differentiation
of stages in the exploration and development-led value creation cycle. The
guiding principle is that new basin/
new play activity is the true foundation
of the oil and gas exploration business
and must be preserved.
It is play fairway analysis that drives
technical and business work. Play

understand the phases of exploration

and development value creation so that
resources are directed toward the right
play fairways, with the right work program to maximize value.
Value locked up in competitor acreage can be unlocked by acquisition, a
key element of Swift Energy’s strategy.
Value can also be unlocked in companyheld leases in perceived high-value play
fairways by review and sometimes new
data collection. Value locked up in drillable prospects can be unlocked by an
aggressive drilling campaign.
The key is having a tool that allows
the company to properly perceive
value in its own properties and in
the acreage positions of others. Swift
Energy’s regional 3D database has enabled our technical teams to assess not
just our own position, but many others
as well.
The core of a successful exploration
and production business, but also the
challenge, is to build a link between
the technical foundation provided by
play fairway analysis with the currency

of our business, that being acreage
acquisition, drilling, and dispositions.
Play fairway analysis is a critical technical tool in determining exploration and
development business strategy.
The technical foundation provided
by play fairway analysis is the identification of risk and the highgrading of
areas for effective reservoir, petroleum
charge, and regional seal. Play fairway
analysis seeks to identify areas where
these model elements provide for a
highly material, commercially robust
activity set.
New geography identified through
3D seismic-based depth imaging technology enables play fairway analysis to
be performed at a higher level of confidence not possible in the past using
older technologies.

by investing capital in new geography
where our teams can better identify
the most favorable, material expected
outcome.
In pursuit of this goal, the exploration and development team’s ultimate
challenge is to integrate diverse areas
of technical knowledge into a working
tool to be used by the business. The expected economic reward from exploration and development is determined by
a combination of price, volume, and
risk.
Although commodity prices are
outside the control or influence of exploration and development companies,
the volume and risk associated with the
technical case can be assigned at a high
degree of accuracy using new technologies and sound petroleum systems
science.

to be delivered through
2011. In addition to
Drilling
new rigs, new yards are
being built and old yards
expanded or reopened. Existing rigs
are scheduled for upgrades to accommodate new working environments and
new rules, such as the mooring upgrades required in the Gulf of Mexico.
The deepwater rig market appears firm, with rates averaging about
$250,000/day and highs reaching
above $500,000/day. Newbuild additions are expected to be absorbed into
the market without substantially lowering rates.
Although the jack up market is softening, average rates are still well above
$100,000/day.

Fleet utilization
According to Rigzone, utilization of
offshore drilling units remains high. Of
the world’s 35 drillships, 88.6% (31
ships) were working in July. Among
155 semisubs, 143 were working, representing 92.3% of the fleet. Of the 358
jack ups worldwide, 333 were working,
or 93% of the fleet.
As of Aug. 24, about 88% (523 rigs)
of the world’s offshore fleet of 595 rigs
was employed, up 2.5% from a year
earlier, when 491 of the 574 rigs were
being utilized.

SCORE increase slows
GlobalSantaFe Corp.’s summary
of current offshore rig economics
(SCORE) reached 136 in June 2007,
up 2.4% from the previous month. The
SCORE compares the profitability of
current mobile offshore drilling rig day
rates to the profitability of day rates at
the 1980-81 peak of the offshore drilling cycle (when SCORE = 100).
The worldwide SCORE finally exceeded the benchmarks in November
2005 for semisubmersible rigs, and in
December 2005 for jack up rigs. Both
rig types began to level off in first-quarter 2006, and the increases slowed.

O D U C T I O N

In June, the semisub SCORE reached
152.6, up 20% from a year earlier and
up 281% from 5 years ago. The jack up
SCORE hit 127, up 6% from a year earlier and up 169% over the past 5 years.
Regionally, the SCORE for West Africa
(149, up 18.5% from a year earlier)
and North Sea (146.7; up 8.7%) are
highest. The SCOREs for Gulf of Mexico
and Southeast Asia are nearly equal at
about 120, with
increases of about
4.5%/month. Southeast Asia, however,
has shown a 33.6%
improvement in the
previous year, while
the SCORE for the
Gulf of Mexico hasn’t really changed in
12 months, improving only 0.6%.
Worldwide SCORE for all regions
and rig types is currently increasing at
2.4%/month and has increased 13.1%
in the previous year.

fleet contains 411 jack ups; adding
72 newbuilds will increase it 17%, to
482. Two of the jack ups to be built for
China Oilfield Services Ltd. are not yet
committed to a shipyard, but most (35)
are being built in Singapore: Keppel
Fels leads with 20 jack up contracts,
followed by PPL with 11, and Jurong
with 4.
Five jack ups are under construction
in Malaysia, at the Labroy and Labuan
yards. Ten others are under way in the
Persian Gulf, 10 in US shipyards, and 5
in China. Three are under construction
in India: two at the ABG Shipyard and
one at the Bharati Shipyard.
PPL announced a $198 million contract to build a Baker Pacific Marine Class
375 jack up announced in late August.
Semisubmersibles—The semisubmersible fleet is set to increase by 26%,
when all 43 of the new units join the
existing fleet of 167 (Table 2). Most of
the rigs are being built in Singapore
(15), China (11), and South Korea (8).
A few are under construction at the
42

IMAC shipyard in Abu Dhabi (3); the
Severodvinsk, Sevmash, and Vyborg
shipyards in Russia (3); the Aker yard
in Verdal, Norway (2); and at Sadra’s
Nekkairan shipyard in the Caspian Sea
(1). Two yards in the UK Haverton Hill
and Teesside, are working with Russian yards on two of the semisubs for
SeaDragon Offshore.
Norway’s Seadrill Ltd. has six semisubs under construction; four in South
Korea and two in Singapore, including
the West Sirius (Fig. 1).
When Drilling Market Focus last
tabulated semisub construction in June
2006, there were 26 semisubs under
construction in five countries, exceeding $13 billion in orders (OGJ, June
19, 2006, p. 35). This was up from
only four units under construction in
2005. Now we see 43 semisubs under
construction in eight countries.
Drillships—There are an unprecedented 19 drillships under construction; 18 in South Korea and 1 in Spain
(Table 3). Most (13) are contracted to
Samsung Heavy Industries’ Geoje yard.
Four are being built by Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co.’s
yard in Okpo; one at Hyundai.

The hull for the multipurpose floater
(MPF) 1000 drillship is under construction at the COSCO shipyard in China,
where steel was cut in January 2007.
The topsides are being built Dragados
Offshore SA shipyard in Cadiz, Spain,
and the ship will be delivered in 2008
(Fig. 2). The ship will have 1-million-bbl
onboard storage for extended well tests.
OGJ’s last tabulation of drillship construction showed only five ships under
construction in Korea, at a cost of $2.46
billion (OGJ, May 8, 2006, p. 43).
Tender-assist rigs—Three drilling
tenders are under construction, to be
delivered in 2007-10 (Table 4). Saipem
SPA’s TAD-1 (tender-assist drilling) unit
is under construction at the company’s
Boscongo Pointe Noire yard in the Congo. The tender can work in 450 ft water
depth and will begin a 5-year contract
with Eni Congo in fourth-quarter 2007.
Eni SPA owns 43% of Saipem.
Seadrill has two tenders under
construction. The T-11 will be delivered
from the Malaysia Marine & Heavy Engineering yard in 2008 (Fig. 3). Seadrill
Asia Ltd. has a semi-tender under construction at Keppel FELS in Singapore
that will be delivered in 2010.
Inland barges—There are three
inland barges under construction in a
Gulf of Mexico yard for Inland Bay Energy Services. Rig 701 will be delivered
this year; Rig 702 and 704 will be delivered in 2008. The barge derricks have
1.5-million-lb hookloads and triple
1,600-hp mud pumps.

Yards
Well-known shipyards are working
at capacity and additional orders from
burgeoning speculative building are going to new facilities.
In Singapore, Keppel FELS Ltd.,
a subsidiary of Keppel Corp. Ltd., is
building 20 jack ups and 9 semisubmersibles. SembCorp Marine subsidiary
Jurong shipyard is building 4 jack ups
and 6 semisubs.
Keppel Offshore & Marine Ltd.
opened a new shipyard in China in
early August. The Keppel Nantong Shipyard Co. Ltd. yard, in Nantong, Jiangsu

March 3 – 5, 2008 / Moody Gardens Hotel & Convention Center, Galveston, Texas

SUBSEA TIEBACK
Forum & Exhibition

PennWell invites you back to the 8th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition.
SSTB has become the premier event for one of the fastest growing field
development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March 3 – 5, 2008 in
Galveston, TX at the Moody Gardens Hotel & Conference Center. Over 2,000
people and 150 exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference.You can’t
afford to miss it.
As our industry confronts new challenges, it has never been more important
to submerse yourself in them. This year’s theme is “Subsea is here, the game
is changing.” As our game changes, the sharing of knowledge and collective
experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety,
and economics of the subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by
industry leaders. As in the past, only by participating in this conference will you
be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will not be published and no
Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room
stays inside the conference room. We hope you will join us.

Coals provide expanded opportunities for additional gas production even
though the industry has delineated the
easier to developed coalbed methane
resources.
Aggressive development also continues in establishing new tight gas sand
plays as well as revitalizing previous
tight gas sand discoveries.
This article, the third in the series,
describes many of these plays and
prospects. The first part of this series
was in OGJ, Sept. 3, 2007, p. 35, with
the second part in OGJ, Sept. 17, 2007,
p. 64.

Production
The last few years
have witnessed the emergence of numerous unconventional gas plays and
prospects in the US.
The industry continues to develop
the extensive Barnett, Woodford, and
Fayetteville gas shale resources and has
expanded its search for new gas shale
plays to West Texas, Alabama, Appalachia, and the Rocky Mountains.

Domestic gas outlook

The outlook for US natural gas production rests greatly on how successful
industry is in finding and aggressively
developing new and emerging unconventional gas resources. Opinions differ,
however, on the likelihood of establishing new, large unconventional gas plays
and prospects.
One view for future domestic natural
gas production is
that the outlook

is perilous: “It is

examples, is that the outlook is promising, assuming a renaissance in unconventional gas technology research,
investment, and progress.
This article summarizes and provides
examples of new supplies and emerging
resources of unconventional gas. These
resources seem substantial enough to
fill a significant portion of the supply
gap resulting from declining US conventional natural gas production.
Several of these new plays and prospect may not prove out, while others,
with the aid of advances in unconventional gas technology, will likely emerge
as sizable productive plays.
In addition, it is important to recognize that the already discovered plays
provide opportunities for more intense
development of these sizable unconventional gas resources.

Production, MMcfd

Gas shales currently represent the
most highly visible unconventional gas
resource (Fig. 1). Such plays as the Barnett, Woodford, and Fayetteville shales
are the most active, although several
other shales show potential.
Combining innovative drilling and
stimulation technology with a large resource potential has allowed the Barnett
shale of the Fort Worth basin to produce
2 bcfd—sparking the current interest
in evaluating and pursuing gas shales, a
resource until recently categorized as a
reservoir source rock or seal.
Two emerging gas-shale plays, the
Fayetteville and the Woodford shales,
have also reached high levels of production. For example, as of July 28, 2007,
Southwestern Energy Co., the primary
producer in the Fayetteville play, has
increased its production from the play
to 200 MMcfd from 50 MMcfd in 1
year (Fig. 2) and collapsed the initial
“learning time” for this play to 2 years
(Fig. 3).
Southwestern believes the Fayetteville shale has a potential 8,000 drilling
locations and 11 tcf of recoverable
resource.

estimates that the play potentially has
3-6 tcf of recoverable gas. With new
techniques such as long horizontal
wells and advanced slick-water fracturing, producers have made plays such
as the Woodford and Fayetteville shales
economically productive.
Still, much remains to be learned
about the favorable and less favorable
geologic settings for these plays as well
as the optimum drilling and completion

• West Texas for Barnett and Wood-

ford shales.
• Alabama for the Conasauga shale.
• Appalachia for Marcellus and other
gas shales.
• Rockies for numerous shale deposits.
The Barnett and Woodford shales
in the Permian basin of West Texas
are thicker and generally deeper than
their Midcontinent counterparts. The
Barnett shale has a 200-800 ft thickness at 5,000-15,000 ft depths, while
the Woodford shale reaches a 400-ft
thickness in the heart of the play. These
shales have a high estimated organic
content of 4-7% total organic carbon

Much of the higher quality, easier
to produce coalbed methane resource
plays has been found. What remains are
the deeper coals, the lower rank coals
and the opportunity to develop existing
plays more intensively. Notable potential
plays are:
• Deep coals of the Greater Green
River and Piceance basins, estimated to
hold hundreds of tcf of gas in-place.
• Lower rank, Tertiary-age coals
along the Gulf Coast.
• Additional development of the
already discovered Raton, San Juan,
and Uinta basin coals with infill wells,
restimulation, and enhanced coalbed
methane (ECBM).
The coalbed methane in the Green
River and Piceance basins has long been
noted for two things: the vast in-place
resource and their considerable depth.
Estimates put the in-place coalbed
methane resource of the Green River
basin at 314 tcf10 and of the Piceance
basin at 84 tcf.11
In the Piceance basin, the Cameo
coal in the Paludal zone below the Williams Fork (Mesaverde) tight gas sands
contains about 80% of the basin’s CBM
resource.
During the 1980s and early 1990s,
producers experimented with commingling production from these deep
tight gas sands and coals, motivated, in
part, by Section 29 tax credits. The high

Hindustan Petroleum
Corp. Ltd. (HPCL) used
low-cost modifications
to the FCC unit in its
Mumbai, India, refinery
Refining
to improve performance.
The low-cost revamp,
which cost about $2 million, generated
$0.2/bbl in savings with a payback of 5
months.
The FCC is the
primary source
of gasoline and
LPG production in
many Indian refineries. Increasing
unit capacity and
improving yield
and product quality have a dramatic
effect on refinery economics and the
FCC’s ability to help meet new product
specifications.
The FCC process has complex interactions between feed, catalyst, and
hardware. Identifying the hardware
constraints in FCCUs and unlocking
their potential using simple and lowcost modifications enhance cracker
capacity and yields.
The FCC unit at HPCL’s Mumbai
refinery has a 20,000 b/sd, side-by-side
reactor-regenerator. The key constraints
were catalyst circulation, reactor stripper head, orifice chamber, wet gas compressor, and downstream facilities.
The 2005 revamp involved stripper
internal modifications with an elevated

bed, catalyst transfer-line aeration
changes, a redesign of the orifice chamber, modifications in the regenerator air
grid, changes in fractionator internals,
and the installation of a high-efficiency
rotor bundle. These modifications,
which required little investment, have
unlocked the FCC’s potential by improving its throughput and yields.

Background

HPCL’s original FCCU with bed
cracking was commissioned in 1955.
The unit was revamped in 1999 to
modernize the facility and to increase
the feed rate to 20,000 b/sd from
10,000 b/sd.
The original FCC licensor conducted
the basic engineering design for the
revamp (reactor, regenerator, transfer
lines, etc). The revamp design included
some of the licensor’s new technologies, such as new high-pressure-drop
feed injectors, new catalyst transfer
lines, extended feed riser terminating at
cyclone inlet elevation, etc.
The revamp design was, however,
constrained because the existing unit
was to be modified while maintaining the basic vessel layout, structure,
and foundation. The refiner designed
the downstream sections including the
waste-heat boiler, stack valves, orifice
chamber, cat fractionator, and gas concentration unit (GCU) section.
The modernized FCC had advantages

soil potentials.
• Digital multi meter, to check test
leads and other areas where the reference cells were attached during the
logs.
• Stray-current mapper viewer software used in the analysis of the stray
current and pipe-to-soil voltage logs.
• Spreadsheets for the compilation
of the data.
• Handheld GPS for recording positions of the flags at the logged locations, accurate within 1 m.
The line surveyed with the straycurrent mapper lay in areas with obtainable access to the NGL pipeline and
normally in areas with nearby access to
a pipeline test station. Placing the SCM
across the NGL pipeline occurred in
such a way that any forward measurements of the current direction would
indicate that the current was flowing
downstream (with the normal pipeline product flow) and any backward
measurements of the current direction
would indicate that the current was
flowing upstream.
The survey focused on areas of least
negative pipe-to-soil potentials and
areas with the most current flow at the
logged locations.
Fig. 4 shows the least negative potentials at the logged locations. The least
negative, and in fact positive, potential
lies at SCM flag 3J; a +0.123-v positive
value which may be caused by a nearby
bare 20-in. line.
The static stray-current survey also
identified this area. The next least negative area lay at SCM flag 32, where a
-0.075 voltage was logged. Many other
events measured less than –0.300 v.
Fig. 5 shows the peak current measurements at the logged locations. The
most current measured at any location
lay at flag 65 at 2.887 amp. This event
did not correspond with events logged
at the same time at other locations and
may have been localized. A commercial
saw mill stood about 0.5 miles from the
location.
The two other most significant current flow areas lay at SCM flag 52, with
a measured amperage of 1.397 and

The 23.3-ma reading shown in the lower left of this screen represents the most current measured at any
location on Operator 1’s rectifiers (Fig. 8).
at SCM flag 47, 1.210 amp; both near
a coal mining operation. Other areas
along the pipeline have current flows
above 0.5 amp, including SCM flags 4
and 6, SCM flags 26D-31D, SCM flags
55-58 and SCM flags 60 and 65.
Fig. 6 shows the peak current with
the least negative potentials at the
logged locations. The least negative potentials are not always associated with
the most current flow. Not being at the
actual pipeline position where the discharge is occurring likely causes this.
Being very near or on top of the
current’s discharge position would
likely lead to the least negative pipeline
potentials being measured at these locations, provided there was no error in
the measurements due to other nearby
interfering sources.
SCM flag 30 showed a –0.456 voltage potential and 0.848 amp of current.
SCM flag 31D has a 0.232 voltage potential and 0.635 amp of current, and
a –0.075 voltage potential and 0.274
amp of current exist at SCM flag 32.
These measurements indicate discharge
points between flags 30 and 32, with
the most significant discharge occurring

between 31D and 32.
Other areas with the same types of
patterns include but are not limited to
SCM flags 46-53, and SCM flags 59-69.
These types of patterns can occur in
smaller areas and the survey to date may
not show all of the patterns occurring
between the locations logged. Fig. 7
shows an example of logged currentmeasurement data at flags 59-65.

Static example
A static stray-current survey conducted with the stray current on an NGL
pipeline used the following techniques
at various locations but not on the entire pipeline:
• Pipe locating (for location and
depth).
• Interrupting current from foreign
sources.
• Stray-current mapping.
• Pipe-to-soil potential measurements (in limited amounts).
• 1-m accurate GPS.
The survey concentrated on the best
techniques, including stray-current
measurement readings from the foreign
interrupted current sources. Survey-

ing the 60-mile pipeline took place as
needed at various intervals, with a total
of 10 different foreign sources of rectified current interrupted.
68

These interrupted sources of current provided the basis of the survey;
unidentified or unknown sources of
current that were not interrupted were

not measured. Measurements occurred
at locations every 0.5-1 mile along the
pipeline and before and after every
known foreign pipeline crossing using
the following techniques:
• GPS current interruption of four
foreign transmission pipeline rectifiers
from one operator, GPS current interruption of three foreign rectifiers from
a second operator, and GPS current
interruption of three foreign rectifiers
from a third.
• Stray-current mapping to map the
distribution of interrupted currents at
various locations on the NGL pipeline.
• On and off pipe-to-soil potentials
(not logged) at selected test stations.
Much of the line surveyed with the
stray-current mapper lay in older areas
of the NGL pipeline that had no coating where the pipe-to-soil measurements are low. Placement of the SCM
across the NGL pipeline took place
such that any forward measurements
of the current direction would indicate
that the current was flowing downstream and any backward measurements of the current direction would
indicate that the current was flowing
upstream.
Reviewing SCM measurements on
foreign pipelines should take place according to how the bar was set up in
relation to the north-south orientation
of the pipeline direction indicated on
the SCM log screen.
Operator 1 rectifiers. Interference current
measurements on the NGL pipeline
from these rectifiers do not indicate
any substantial amount of stray-current
influence. The most current at any one
location measured 23 ma at flag 7, upstream from a pipeline crossing (Fig. 9).
The limited current measured after the
crossing suggests that a discharge of 1020 ma may be occurring in this area.
An anode on the NGL pipeline near
this location could be discharging this
current. No known bonds exist between
Operator 1 and the NGL pipeline.
Operator 2 rectifiers. These interfering
sources of current have a more significant effect on the integrity of the NGL
pipeline, with the largest source of

pipeline draws close and runs parallel
between Flags 3J and 3L, at which point
a 1-2 amp charge moves from the NGL
pipeline to the 20-in. pipeline (Fig. 10).
Both pipelines are uncoated in this area,
providing a potential path for current
discharge. Pipe-to-soil measurements
also show possible current discharge at
this location.

In their new book, authors Michael D. Tusiani and Gordon
Shearer, using everyday language and real-world examples,
present LNG as the most viable energy answer to the everincreasing global demand for natural gas.

458 Pages/ Hardcover/
August 2007
ISBN10 087814-885-X
ISBN13 978-0-87814-885-1
Price: $69.00 US

Even the most conservative estimates suggest that the
demand for LNG internationally will double by 2020, and
billions of dollars will be needed for the infrastructure
investment.
The authors’ straightforward explanation of a complex
industry proves that LNG can deliver a critical link in the
energy demands of international economies.

US chases energy
fantasies while
EU seeks supply
Europe and the US share concern about
security of energy supply. The similarity
mostly ends there.
Europe has been rattled by Russia’s
willingness to curb deliveries of natural gas
in apparent attempts to advance its political
goals.
It matters little to Europe that Russia’s
direct targets so far have been adjacent,
non-European neighbors that—depending

T h e

on who’s interpreting events—Moscow was
trying to bring to heel or simply dunning
for overdue accounts. None of that should
matter to Europe. Gas not delivered on
schedule during winter is gas not delivered,
whatever the reason.
In plenty of other ways lately, Russia has
been behaving like the bully it used to be.
Europe has reason to worry.
So the European Union is looking elsewhere for energy supply.
Through its European Neighborhood
Policy (ENP), for example, the EU is trying
to strengthen ties with bordering countries
to the east and along the non-European
Mediterranean coast. That energy cooperation is central to the effort is no secret.
The logic is straightforward. Europe
needs more energy than its constituent
countries can produce. So it goes looking
for new supply.
The US needs more energy than it can
produce, too. But instead of looking for
more supply it cuddles itself into fantasies
about conservation and alternative energy.
Unlike Europe, the US could produce
more energy than it does inside its borders—off the East and West Coasts, in the
eastern Gulf of Mexico, in Alaska. It just
won’t.
In energy-fretful Europe, this must look
foolish. It is.
Europe kisses the alternative-energy
ring, too, of course. EU communications
about the ENP coo about neighboring
countries’ commitment to solar, wind, and
biofuels.
Yet energy from all those sources
combined in the target neighbors wouldn’t
displace meaningful amounts of the gas
Europe imports from Russia.
The neighborhood in question includes
Azerbaijan, Syria, Egypt, Libya, and Algeria—none of which, at last report, was a
major exporter of wind or solar-driven electrical power or of biofuels. The EU needs
and wants oil and gas, and its political
varnish about alternatives fools no one.
Except, maybe, wishful thinkers in the
US.

Crude tops record $80/bbl
The front-month crude contract closed above $80/bbl for the ﬁrst time in the
history of the New York Mercantile Exchange Sept. 13 upon news that Hurricane
Humberto had disrupted power to three reﬁneries in Port Arthur, Tex.
In its third consecutive record settlement that week, the October contract for
benchmark US light, sweet crudes increased 18¢ to $80.09 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That contract hit an all-time high of $80.36/bbl in intraday trading Sept.
14 before proﬁt-taking dropped the closing price to $79.10/bbl on NYMEX.
The record high closing came 3 days after ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries voted in Vienna to increase production by 500,000 b/d,
effective Nov. 1. The agreement excludes production by Angola and Iraq and affects
only the other 10 members. Saudi Arabia’s crude production is still 400,000 b/d below the October 2006 level, but that is offset by Angola’s production increases. Saudi
Arabia, the UAE, and Kuwait supported the production increase while Venezuela,
Algeria, and Libya resisted it.
Analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc. called the
boost “largely symbolic, aimed to calm a skittish market that is still assessing the full
extent and fallout from the US credit-market meltdown.” The 10 members subject to
quotas are estimated to have produced 1 million b/d above the current ceiling during
August. Barclays Capital Inc. analyst Paul Horsnell in London said OPEC “probably
should have increased by a tad more if there was a desire to keep the incursion
above the $80/bbl reasonably limited.” OPEC production already was expected to
fall during November because of heavy ﬁeld maintenance in the UAE. Maintenance
slated for the giant Lower Zakum and Upper Zakum oil ﬁelds off Abu Dhabi could
reduce output by 600,000 b/d for 2-3 weeks, Horsnell said. Additional reductions
from Umm Shaif ﬁeld off Abu Dhabi are likely to bring the peak reduction total up to
800,000 b/d.
“In all, an increase in output of 500,000 b/d from the rest of the OPEC 10 would
do little more than cancel out the reduction in the UAE across November as a whole
and leave output fairly stable,” Horsnell said. “It would then be December before the
increase became signiﬁcant and January before that oil turned up in the market.”
Olivier Jakob, managing director of Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland, said
Sept. 17, “The OPEC decision to increase output by 500,000 b/d has been so far discounted by the market, but we think that it deserves closer attention when increases
from Angola and Iraq are taken into account.” Jakob said, “The overall OPEC production number for November is still difﬁcult to assess due to maintenance in the UAE,
but even with a very conservative outlook on Iraqi supplies, we should have OPEC
in December producing 700,000 b/d over December 2006 and in the ﬁrst quarter of
2008, [an increase of] 850,000 b/d vs. the ﬁrst quarter of 2007, and this before any
increases from Nigeria.”
Hurricane Humberto
Hurricane Humberto surprised forecasters as it intensiﬁed quickly from a tropical
storm to a hurricane while making landfall Sept. 13 at High Island, Tex. High winds
snapped power lines in East Texas. The US Minerals Management Service said there
were no reports of suspended oil or gas production or offshore evacuations because
of Humberto. But three reﬁneries in Port Arthur, Tex., lost power:
• A Shell Oil Co. spokesman said Sept. 17 workers restored power to most of
Motiva Enterprises LLC’s 285,000 b/d reﬁnery in Port Arthur and began the restart
sequence.
• Valero Energy Corp. said full power was restored to its 250,000 b/d reﬁnery
Sept. 14, and start-up was under way. Ofﬁcials expected to return to normal production by Sept. 22.
• Total SA reported that partial power was restored to Total Petrochemicals USA’s
231,252 b/d reﬁnery late Sept. 13 and that it was expected to be back up within 5 days.
Temporary loss of three reﬁneries stimulated market concerns over US fuel
stocks, with crude inventories at the lowest level in 8 months and gasoline at the
lowest position in 2 years. Analysts with the Societe Generale Group in Paris reported Sept. 17 that US oil inventories were still decreasing and that the promised
increase of 500,000 b/d in production from OPEC is not big enough to prevent crude
oil stock draws in the fourth quarter. “Markets worry about a worsening US economy
that could hit demand. Oil analysts predominantly expect a decrease in the West
Texas Intermediate price,” they said.

“effective noise attenuation through digital group forming and 3D surface multiple attenuation has allowed us to clean the measurements
in an unprecedented manner and therefore improve the quality of
imaging or production monitoring in all types of environments.”
Pete Bennion, vice-president, imaging, for TGS-Nopec, contends that the combination of a cost-effective computing environment using Linux cluster technology and high-speed disks
has freed the software developers to enhance the precision of
the algorithms and extend them while reducing turnaround.
“For example, 3D SRME [surface-related multiple elimination]
has become standard over 2D SRME in the past 2 years despite
the considerable computational effort,” he says. “Velocity autopicking is another area where fast machines have proven effective.
Tomography has now been generalized as a velocity reﬁnement
tool for depth imaging. All-azimuth tomographic ray-tracing is now
feasible and better addresses the wide-azimuth acquisition techniques now being used in 3D marine. Subsalt tomography is a
reality and is being used successfully in difﬁcult salt canopy areas
of the Gulf of Mexico. Alternative multiple elimination techniques
such as waveﬁeld extrapolation are showing promise.”
Davey Einarsson, CEO of Calgary-based GSI, cites SRME as
a breakthrough technology: “Multiple reﬂections are misleading,
and we ﬁnally have the technology to remove them from the
data volume, resulting in ‘cleaner’ data.”
Ruben Martinez, PGS chief geophysicist for data processing,
cites 3D wave equation prestack depth migration (PSDM) as a
key recent advance in seismic data processing: “The accuracy
of the wave equation-based methods [exceed] those based on
Kirchhoff implementations because wave equation methods
comprehend multivalued raypaths in the presence of complex
geology and very complex velocity models.”

Subsurface data interpretation
While acknowledging the sophistication and power of commercial
software packages for seismic interpretation, Martinez contends
that advances in interpretation are mainly related to the extraction
of subsurface information not obviously seen in the seismic data
when analyzed in an interpretation or visualization system.
“I am referring to the use of seismic attributes that can infer
subsurface characteristics not seen in the conventional seismic
data,” he points out. “There are many attributes that, once analyzed and combined properly, can lead to very accurate interpretations of the subsurface and its contents. For example, coherency measurements may yield maps of fracture trends.
“Other advances are in the area of interpretive processing,
such as acoustic impedance estimation and elastic inversion for
P and S wave impedances from prestack data using [amplitude
vs. offset] measurements. Maps of these estimates can be invaluable to interpret rock properties and to produce ﬂuid content/
type maps from 4D measurements.”
A great step in data interpretation came with the automatic 3D
volume interpretation of geologic bodies, stratigraphic sequences, and discrete fractures after image processing and gaming
industry techniques were applied to seismic data, notes Sledzik:

“Also, integrated 3D visualization of subsurface measurements
and interactive modeling while interpreting have helped in better
understanding the data and therefore in making better decisions
when guiding or correcting an automatic interpretation.”
He cites WesternGeco’s i2i (interpretation to imaging) software. The software combines interpretation, processing, imaging, and speciﬁcally tomography through a permanently evolving
earth velocity model.
There is now a much closer linkage between interpretation
and imaging driven by the need to better understand the geology, notes Bennion, citing difﬁcult subsalt areas.
“The ability to quickly view an interpretation and convert it
to a new velocity model to be used in PSDM helps shorten the
cycle time between generating the image and reinterpreting it,”
he adds.

Subsurface imaging
Continuing increases in computing power are removing many of
the restrictions that resulted in the use of simpliﬁed earth models
in seismic imaging and inversion algorithms, Sledzik contends.
“We are now seeing very impressive results when anisotropic elastic full waveform tomographic imaging and inversion algorithms are applied,” he says. “And we are really just beginning
to talk about true 3D subsurface imaging with the advent of richand wide-azimuth marine seismic acquisition techniques, and
the integration of multiple geophysical measurements (seismic,
borehole, electromagnetic, gravimetric) to delineate complex
geological bodies such as salt.”
The dramatic increase in computing power at lower cost has
also accounted for the most signiﬁcant recent technology advance in subsurface imaging, contends Bennion, noting that it
allows the use of multiple algorithms in depth imaging.
“Kirchhoff can be used for steep dips and wide bandwidth,
beam migration implementations are used for velocity model
building due to their speed, wave equation is highly effective for
subsalt imaging, and, ﬁnally, reverse time migration is making
an appearance as today’s ultimate imaging algorithm,” he says.
“Adding to this the ability to estimate and autopick anisotropy parameters epsilon and delta and run anisotropic PSDM now gives
interpreters an added degree of conﬁdence in the positioning of
their prospect.”
Einarsson concurs, noting that PSDM and prestack time migration “give a superior, unambiguous image of the subsurface.
The availability of relatively inexpensive, large, fast computers makes this possible.”
Martinez contends that although 3D traveltime tomography is
not a recent velocity estimation method, the commercialization
of the method has been impressive.
“Automated picking of depth residuals and dip ﬁelds has
experienced important developments yielding a direct impact
in turnaround time for processing very large data volumes,” he
says. “Also, the accuracy and effectiveness of the ray tracing and
tomographic inversion have advanced signiﬁcantly in robustness
and algorithmic speed.” ]

New tools advancing
subsurface data integration

I

ntegration of seismic data with other subsurface data is
beneﬁting from gains in computing power and development of new software tools.
With available prospects located in increasingly complex
geologic environments, oil and natural gas operating companies
that take advantage of those new tools will do a better job of
ﬁnding and producing hydrocarbons.

Integration challenges
“Seismic and nonseismic data have been integrated from the
ﬁrst time a geophysicist used a copier to rescale a well log to
overlay it on a seismic section,” says Dan Piette, president and
CEO of OpenSpirit Corp. “This is not an optional tool to ﬁnd oil
and gas but a necessary one.”
In recent years, the ability to integrate these data has become easier, as software has become available to automatically
perform the conversion between time and depth, and as depthmigrated seismic data has become more common, he notes.
Bill Schrom, Geotrace CEO, concurs: “The basic assumption
is that traditional subsurface data (logs, cores, ﬂuid types, pressure, temperature, production data, etc.) provide more accuracy
and higher resolution. However, sparse and scattered surface
seismic data are highly dense and spatially continuous but have
a low resolution and are less accurate. Integrating those data
gives the oil and gas industry the best of both worlds.”
Piette contends that all operating companies must pursue a
common integration framework on which to hang both their applications and their data: “The old days of proprietary data stores
and stand-alone applications are going the way of the command
line interface.
“If the petrophysicist comes up with the best interpretation
in the world, but the geologist doesn’t know where to put it,
or the reservoir engineer doesn’t know how to integrate it into
his map, that work can just be thrown away. All companies
need to have a strategy for integration that includes a services
layer that takes care of the quality of the data, the translation of
units and coordinate systems, and the integration of multiple
vendor applications and databases. This software exists today,
but is too often being bolted on at the end of the installation of
a new application.”
Piette urges operating companies to realize that an integrated solution doesn’t just appear because data can be moved
from one database to another: “It needs to be a thoughtfully
approached solution that may not be cheap but will pay back its
value many times over during the life of the installation.”
One of the biggest challenges of such integration is simply
| 6 |

knowing where those data are, Piette says.
“That means knowing not only where in the world (Gulf of
Mexico, North Sea, etc.) the physical entity lies, but also where
the digits themselves are stored. Are they stored on a local disk?
A shared network disk? Ofﬂine storage? Network storage?
“Then the comfort that the data, once integrated, is in the
same cartographic reference system (CRS) is critical to a successful interpretation. If you know where it is, but it is really
loaded in a different CRS, then you are in the worst of all possible
data worlds: You think something is right and trusted, and it is
wrong, and all your subsequent decisions are tainted.”
Piette points out that there are companies that provide the
hardware and software needed to ensure the data are accessible and companies that can ensure the data are correct.
But the two companies are never the same, and the solutions provided need to be constantly monitored and managed to
make sure that the results stay accurate, he insists.
“The bigger challenges will occur because the exploration companies need to ﬁnd entirely new workﬂows that can
take advantage of some of the new data that are available,”
Piette says. “You can look at the electromagnetic data that
have never been available in the past except from a well log.
Or gravity gradient data, which is extremely high-resolution
potential ﬁeld data that are being collected directly rather than
being derived mathematically.”
“No exploration manager has ever sat down and asked himself, ‘So how do I increase my cycle time today?’ But that question must be asked, because it does take more time to integrate
in all these additional data. A tradeoff between accuracy and
speed must be made.”

New technologies
New technologies for integrating seismic and nonseismic data
are proving effective tools for oil and gas companies that are
scrambling to keep replacing reserves through exploration, development, and production.
“Integrating other subsurface data with 3D seismic data
provides oil companies a calibrated high-density, high-resolution (HDHR) subsurface geological model with reservoir thickness/extent, reservoir heterogeneity, and rock/ﬂuid properties
for prospect technical evaluation and ﬁnancial risk assessment,”
Schrom notes. “The key technologies for this calibrated HDHR
geological model are: 1) lithology and ﬂuid prediction using
prestack seismic inversion, such as Geotrace’s RockRes, for
downscaling seismic resolution (more than tens of feet to log
scale [~1 ft] and, eventually, core scale [<1 ft]) with petrophysical

since RTM is based on the full two-way
wave equation, the amplitude integrity
of the images is higher than that of previous imaging algorithms
and hence offers the potential for improved ﬂuid and rock property
estimates in complex areas.”
Martinez thinks that RTM will become the standard method
for subsurface imaging: “RTM provides opportunities for improving the imaging accuracy not seen with conventional Kirchhoff
or wave equation methods (one-way wave equation). RTM uses
the two-way wave equation, and this provides the opportunity to
reach geologic dips up to 90° or beyond.”

Western Africa, according to Whiting.
“The specialized imaging algorithm produces much clearer
images of subsurface reﬂectors in areas where standard imaging algorithms have struggled to produce anything reliable,” he
says. “CBM, combined with specialized algorithms for wideazimuth data, forms a powerful combination for understanding
reservoir potential.
“At CGGVeritas, we have seen CBM produce high-quality,
unambiguous images below complex salt bodies. In offshore
regions of Vietnam, CBM has produced reliable images of the
fractures in the buried granitic basement that are critical for successful production.”

Attenuation
A key new technology for improving attentuation is 3D surfacerelated multiple elimination (SRME).
For Whiting, 3D SRME provides the ability to attenuate some
of the very troublesome and complex multiple events that tend
to contaminate seismic images and obscure and distort the target events.
“At CGGVeritas, 3D SRME has been routinely used in recent
times on very large surveys in most parts of the world, resulting in
improved conﬁdence in the interpreted estimates of the subsurface,” he says. “Recently, CGGVeritas has reengineered 3D SRME
for wide-azimuth geometry and has successfully applied it to several wide-azimuth surveys in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
Martinez thinks SRME technology will continue to show a lot
of progress: “The evolution will be in SRME-type methods that
are data-driven methods; this represents a tremendous advantage over other methods, like Radon, which require a preliminary
knowledge of the velocity ﬁeld.”

Full-wave seismic

“By full waveﬁelds I mean elastic waveﬁelds and not only
acoustic,” he clariﬁes. “To achieve this task, imaging methods
that make use of the elastic wave equation will be in place and
will include most, if not all, modes of wave propagation. Hopefully, the computer capacity will be there to be able to produce
these images commercially.”

4D/real-time monitoring
The advent of 4D, or time-lapse, seismic has given the industry
the capability of real-time monitoring of the subsurface.
Whiting notes that CGGVeritas has seen 4D seismic technology quietly growing to become a trusted and required tool for
optimizing reservoir production.
“SeisMovie, a CGGVeritas high-resolution, high-sensitivity 4D
reservoir monitoring solution using permanent arrays of sources
and receivers, which operate continuously, has been applied successfully to a range of scenarios, including heavy oil production
and gas storage monitoring,” he says..
Sledzik notes that the biggest impact of 4D comes in the area
of seismic data acquisition, but adds, “What could potentially
change the game here is the integration of processing and interpretation capable of efﬁciently handling multiple data volumes
and the utilization of 4D measurements to discover geomechanical information about the evolution of the ﬁeld.”
The ultimate goal in 4D seismic is to deliver the 4D seismic
anomalies map with a fast turnaround so that the seismic information can be incorporated into the reservoir simulation process, contends Martinez.
“The turnaround time improvement can have a signiﬁcant
impact in the placement of the production wells to be drilled dur-

The close linkage of interpretation with imaging blurs the lines between these disciplines:
“The latest systems allow viewing of multiple
attributes that add a new dimension to the
analysis of seismic data.”

Full-wave seismic technology continues
to mark progress with ever-increasing
computational capacity and evolving
multicomponent recording.
“Recording full-wave seismic, with
over/under streamers or multicomponent
receivers, requires adequate processing
and imaging algorithms,” notes Whiting.
“WesternGeco has an advanced imaging workﬂow, which includes
model building, PP-PS joint tomography, and elastic migration.”
Martinez points out that the accuracy of four-component (4C)
data is constantly improving—for example, PGS recently introduced the OptoSeis ﬁber optic permanent seabed 4D4C monitoring system.
“In data processing, the elusive goal continues to be the use
of the elastic wave equation,” he says. “The barrier is not that the
theory is unknown but that the algorithms are still expensive to run
with today’s computer power. But until that happen, acceptable
approximations in the algorithms are in use and giving results.”
Martinez speculates full waveﬁelds will be used to image the
subsurface in the future.

in seismic data processing with the aim of improving the turnaround time is vital to make 4D a fully accepted exploitation tool
in the arsenal of the reservoir engineer’s tools. Automating the
processing steps is the main challenge to date.”

Visualization
Improvements in 3D visualization have been a key enabler in
measurement integration, according to Whiting.

achieved this by visualizing and manipulating together the data

Reservoir geophysics
Reservoir geophysics is a discipline within geophysics that
continues to gain momentum, notes Martinez.
“The need to translate seismic information into rock
properties and then translate these into lithology and ﬂuids
estimates has produced an important evolution in reservoir
geophysics,” he says. “Techniques such as seismic inversion, amplitude vs. offset, elastic inversion, and seismic
attribute analysis improve continuously to provide the link
between seismic data and reservoir properties.”
Another reason to expect reservoir geophysics to greatly advance in the future is that it is required for a reliable understanding of 4D and 4C measurements, Martinez adds.

The future
Whiting foresees signiﬁcant improvements continuing in the quality of subsurface images and subsurface
property estimation.
“The wide-azimuth surveying technique will undoubtedly result in further reﬁnements and provide even more
reliable and extensive images of the subsurface,” he says.
“Advances in computing (potentially spurred by advances
in nanotechnology) will allow for higher-ﬁdelity processing
than can be considered today. The quantitative accuracy
of the processed waveﬁeld will lead to highly reliable estimates of subsurface rock and ﬂuid properties.
“Acquisition advances in seaﬂoor techniques and permanent monitoring will lead to an inexorable link between seismic
information and successful exploitation of reservoirs. Advances in multicomponent acquisition and processing will further
improve the industry’s understanding of subsurface rock and
ﬂuid properties, as well as fracture and stress information.
“Nearer-term advances at CGGVeritas, along with increasing computing power, will continue to improve our ability to
process full waveﬁelds (even more than one waveﬁeld at the
same time). This will lead to highly accurate and precise velocity models of the subsurface and correspondingly improved
depth images. ]

COVER
A seismic interpreter can develop interpretable fuzzy outputs to
build logics by investigating seismic attributes, as shown in the
high-risk area and the much larger low amplitude and intermediate frequency area highlighted on this week’s cover. After that, he
can create unique outputs by using user-defined simple logical
expressions (i.e., IF-THEN statements). An article on the method
starts on p. 33 as part of OGJ’s Applied Geophysics special report.

ranked as the most efficient server,
remarkably drawing even less power than
a standard household light bulb and
consuming 30% less power than identical
competitive solutions. This is good news for
the environment, and even better news for
your bottom line.

OPEC cuts oil output by 1.5 million b/d
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries announced
a 1.5 million b/d reduction to its oil output targets. The cuts, effective Nov. 1, would put total OPEC production at 27.308 million
b/d from the 11 member countries that are bound by quotas.
The organization cited declining oil demand resulting from the
financial crisis and slowing global economy as the reason behind
the cut, maintaining that the market has been oversupplied with
crude for some time.
OPEC noted that the recent dramatic oil price collapse may jeopardize existing oil projects and lead to the cancellation or delay of
others, possibly resulting in a medium-term supply shortage.
Iraq and outgoing OPEC member Indonesia were not assigned
a new production ceiling. The largest cut was assigned to Saudi
Arabia, which agreed to reduce output by 466,000 b/d.
The Centre for Global Energy Studies, London, calculates that
Saudi Arabia’s new quota will be 8.477 million b/d, based on figures released after OPEC’s November 2007 meeting. In order to
comply with the new quotas, Saudi Arabia will be required to cut
its actual production by more than 1 million b/d from an estimated September 2008 level of almost 9.5 million b/d, according
to CGES.
Iran will have to cut its actual output by 300,000 b/d from its
September level, Kuwait by 200,000 b/d, and the UAE, Algeria,
and Libya each by more than 100,000 b/d. Only Angola and Nigeria were producing less than their new quota levels of output in
September, CGES said.
CGES believes that OPEC’s desire to push oil prices upwards
from their current $60-70/bbl level stands in sharp contrast to
what the organization was saying just a year ago. In a press release in October 2007, Sec. Gen. Abdalla Salem El-Badri said OPEC
was concerned with the escalation in oil prices that pushed the
OPEC reference basket to $80/bbl from $70/bbl over the previous
month and a half. The press release went on to say that the rising oil
prices were largely being driven by market speculators.
“The implication then was that oil prices at $70-80/bbl were
not a reflection of market fundamentals and were unhealthily high.
Twelve months on and this same level of oil prices must be protected as a floor price, despite the much weaker outlook for the
global economy and fears of a global recession,” CGES said.

Congress asked to address energy production
Two senior Republicans on the US House Oversight and Government Reform Committee issued a report Oct. 28 calling for an
approach that addresses all facets of US energy production.
The report also affirms that US energy security and global environmental challenges cannot be effectively addressed separately,

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

according to Thomas M. Davis III (Va.), the full committee’s ranking minority member, and Darrel E. Issa (Calif.), ranking minority
member of the committee’s Domestic Policy Subcommittee.
“We no longer can ignore the fact that energy policy is intertwined with security policy. We can’t keep pumping money into
the economies of countries dedicated to opposing our interests.
For that matter, we can’t keep sending billions of dollars overseas
every year when we have the means, the technology and the raw
materials to alleviate much of our dependence on foreign energy
right here at home,” Davis said.
“We cannot address the root of many national security concerns, economic troubles or environmental threats without an effective energy strategy. These issues have all become deeply intertwined. An effective energy policy cannot address just the cost of
energy today,” Issa added.
The report by the committee’s minority staff also said an energy
and environmental policy “that fails to account for competitiveness concerns will cause the US manufacturing base to shift more
American jobs overseas and could actually increase carbon emissions. Any meaningful international agreement to reduce carbon
emissions must include the developing world since it is an essential
part of the problem and the solution.”

Pertamina, GMI suspects barred from travel
Indonesia’s National Police, following recent allegations of corruption in the purchase of imported oil, have announced an immediate travel ban on four members of state-owned PT Pertamina
and a director of PT Gold Manor International (GMI).
The five are under investigation after allegations that they profited from the procurement of Zatapi crude oil last year in violation
of the country’s anticorruption law, according to National Police
spokesman Insp. Gen. Abubakar Nataprawira.
“They also have been named as suspects in this case, but we
have yet to arrest them,” said Abubakar, who declined to name the
suspects. “We will determine their further status after we complete
our investigations,” he said.
Abubakar said the State Development Finance Comptroller is
calculating the total amount of financial loss to the Indonesian
state.
Singapore-based oil importer GMI won a Pertamina-sponsored
tender to supply 600,000 bbl of Zatapi crude oil to Indonesia last
December and began shipping it to a Pertamina refinery in Cilacap,
Central Java, in February, 2008.
Legislators of House Commission VII overseeing energy and
mineral resources later revealed that Gold Manor’s tender bid was
incomplete since it did not include a detailed breakdown of the
contents of Zatapi oil.
The Attorney General’s Office began investigating the case on Mar.

Solana gauges oil in Colombia’s Llanos basin

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Range Resources plans to drill five more Huron shale wells and
two horizontal Berea wells by the end of 2008.

Solana Resources Ltd., Calgary, reported an average flow of
5,645 b/d of 41° gravity oil from the Tertiary Carbonera formation at a discovery in eastern Colombia’s Llanos basin.
Los Aceites-1, on the 16,640-acre Guachiria Block, has permeabilities in excess of 3 darcies, and the flow rate was achieved with
less than a 15% drawdown, “indicative of significant incremental
flow potential,” the company said. Carbonera was perforated at
6,874-84 ft. TD is 7,108 ft measured depth.
The company gauged the flow through a 98⁄64-in. choke with 75
psi tubinghead pressure. The well produced only 4 bbl of water in
48 hr.
In anticipation of pending government approval of an extended
test, Solana plans to build centralized permanent facilities at the
nearby Primavera-1 location, site of the company’s other 2008 discovery on the block. Oil will be trucked in the short term.
The company, which is remapping the area as a result of the
exceptional flow rate, said one more well may be required in the
field.

Further development of shale and tight natural gas prospects
in Northeast British Columbia may be able to offset an expected
7% decline in conventional Canadian gas production by 2010, said
that country’s National Energy Board.
The price of gas would need to climb back to $8-9 (Can.)/
gigajoule for operators to maintain or accelerate current drilling
levels, and board said. Producers indicated great enthusiasm for the
resource potential on the deeper, less-developed western side of
the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin, it noted.
The board in its 2008-10 deliverability report considered reference, low, and high-investment cases, all of which take into account the development of shale and tight gas prospects in the Horn
River and Montney plays.
Gas production in the US has increased by 8%, and the global
economic situation could reduce demand, the NEB noted.

Santos suspends Henry-2 DW1 gas well off Victoria

Unconventional gas spurs EnCana’s output

Santos is completing and suspending as a gas producer its Henry-2 DW1 sidetrack well on the Vic/P44 permit in the Otway basin
off western Victoria.
The well encountered good gas shows, and logs recorded excellent reservoir quality. The well will now be tested and suspended
pending production.
Henry-2 was the final well semisubmersible Ocean Patriot
drilled in Santos’ development program to tie in Henry gas field
to Casino.
The forthcoming development will include a 17 km subsea
pipeline and control umbilical to be installed from existing Casino
facilities to Henry and nearby Netherby discovery plus an additional 5 km of line extending to the East Pecten location.
First gas production from the project is expected by June 2009,
with flow rates expected to be 120 terajoules/day for the combined Henry and Casino production.

EnCana Corp. said its companywide natural gas production was
up 8% to 3.9 bcfd in the quarter ended Sept. 30 on a gain of 16%
in its North American unconventional gas plays.
East Texas output averaged 340 MMcfd, up 135% from the same
quarter a year ago, due to new wells coming on production and
a 2007 acquisition that doubled EnCana’s interest in the Jurassic
Deep Bossier play.
EnCana’s US gas production was up 24% on drilling and operational success in the Fort Worth and Piceance basins and Jonah
field in Wyoming.
In Canada, coalbed methane, Cutbank Ridge, and Bighorn increased production by 23%, partly offset by natural declines from
conventional properties, resulting in an overall 16% gain in the
Canadian Foothills division.
EnCana added 25,000 net acres in North Louisiana in the quarter, bringing its Haynesville shale position to 400,000 net acres of
land plus 63,000 net acres of mineral rights. EnCana and its partner
Shell Exploration & Production Co. have an industry-leading land
position in the area, where they are running six rigs and will target
drilling and completion of the first well in the mid-Bossier shale
in the fourth quarter.
EnCana holds more than 700,000 acres in the Montney play in
Northeast British Columbia and northwestern Alberta, and EnCana
and Apache Corp. have completed seven wells this year in the Horn
River basin shale play. One of the most recent wells averaged almost
8 MMcfd in the first 30 days.

Virginia Huron shale gets horizontal wells
Range Resources Corp., Fort Worth, completed drilling its fifth
horizontal well to Devonian Huron shale in Nora field in southwestern Virginia.
The company, which says Huron produces gas from 107 vertical
wells in the field, estimated the formation’s net reserve potential at
Nora from horizontal drilling to 8-1.5 tcf.
The four horizontal Huron shale wells averaged initial production of 1.1 MMcfd, averaged $1.7 million/well, and continue to
produce in line with expectations, the company said. The company
noted that the Huron is thicker and higher pressured at Nora than
in Kentucky.

Petrobras awards Technip offshore ﬂexible pipelay and 40 tonnes/day of LPG. The project could recover more than 8
Petroleo Brasilerio SA (Petrobras) has awarded a contract to
Technip SA for the charter of the Normand Progress vessel for 2
years. The contract includes engineering and support services and
an additional 2 year option.
The vessel specializes in flexible pipeline installation. The $100
million-plus contract is a daily rate contract focusing on the installation and retrieval of flexible pipelines off Brazil in water reaching
2,000 m.
“Scheduled to be mobilized by yearend 2008, the vessel will be
fitted with flexible pipelay equipment, including a 125-ton vertical
lay system,” Technip said.
Solstad owns the vessel, and Technip will operate it under a
frame agreement.
The contract follows the charter contract for a new Brazilian
pipelay vessel that Petrobras awarded to Technip earlier this year.

Horizon sees PNG condensate project
The Stanley gas-condensate reservoir on PRL 4 in western Papua
New Guinea could support a large condensate stripping-gas recycling development, but an investment decision won’t be made
until the Stanley-2 appraisal well is drilled, said Horizon Oil Ltd.,
Sydney.
Consulting engineers concluded that the Stanley Cretaceous
Toro reservoir, discovered in 1999, could produce 140 MMcfd of
gas from two wells, yielding more than 4,000 b/d of condensate

Hess denies St. Lucia reﬁnery claim
Hess Corp., amid a decision to cut the company’s capital expenditure program for next year, said it has no plans to build a $5
billion refinery on the Caribbean island of St. Lucia.
“While we have the option to build the refinery in St. Lucia, we
have no current plans to do so,” Hess Chairman and Chief Executive John B. Hess told analysts during a conference call.
Hess’s statement came just days after a member of the St. Lucia
government said the New York-based firm, which operates a transshipment facility on the island, was likely to build the refinery.
“Quite a substantial amount of money has been committed to
the feasibility studies, and the studies undertaken so far conclude
that there will be no problems putting in the refinery,” said Guy
Joseph, St. Lucia’s communications and works minister (OGJ Online, Oct. 28, 2008).
Earlier, Hess said it will reduce its 2009 capital expenditures
budget due to the uncertain economic environment. The company

A stripping plant could start up in 2010 if Stanley-2 were drilled
in 2009. The well is needed because continuity and connectivity of
the productive gas sand is not assessed as high based on seismic
mapping, pressure buildup during the production test, and the
presence of the target sandstone in surrounding wells, Horizon
Oil said.
The gas would be reinjected until a power generation market
develops in 5 years or so in PNG’s western province and across the
border in West Papua, Indonesia. That market could account for
the entire Stanley gas resource, estimated independently at 260 bcf

Total hires Angolan drilling rig
Total E&P Angola has let a 2-year drilling contract worth $452
million to Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. for its fourth-generation
semisubmersible rig, Ocean Valiant, in Angola.
“The companies could change the contract into either a 2½
year or a 3 year agreement at the option of the operator at day rates
that could earn maximum total revenue, excluding mobilization
fees, totaling between $552 million and $646 million,” Diamond
Offshore said.
Ocean Valiant can operate in water up to 5,000 ft and can drill
up to 30,000 ft. Total has interests in deepwater Blocks 14 and 17,

Pakistan cuts duties on products to Afghanistan
Pakistan has cut by almost 50% its fixed regulatory duty on diesel and kerosine exports to Afghanistan, effective immediately.
Under the prescribed formula, price differential claims have
come down owing to a sharp fall in product prices in the international market, paving the way for a substantial cut in export
regulatory duties for Afghanistan. Pakistan last month had imposed
the duty on diesel and kerosine exports to Afghanistan because Afghanistan was subsidizing Kabul consumers.
Total exports of petroleum products to Afghanistan stood at
more than $300 million during the last fiscal year (2007-08).

called microrefining projects now under way—will be inaugurated
within the next couple of weeks, according to an official statement.
“The project comprises two units: the first one is 100% complete, while work on the second is 50% complete,” Iraq’s national
information center said, adding that each unit has a capacity of
10,000 b/d.
Analyst Global Insight said Iraq has launched several microrefining projects since 2006 due to the amount of time it would take
before the country’s larger refineries could be repaired and readied
for nationwide production and distribution.
Currently, Iraq’s three main refineries—Dora, Shuaiba, and
Beiji—are running at half or less of the 597,500 b/d of installed
capacity they had before the US-led invasion in March 2003.
As a result, according to Global Insight, “the microrefineries
provide their respective areas with significant respite from short-

ages and an opportunity to restart a local economic recovery.”
Underlining that view, the Iraqi government in August approved
an $81 million contract to upgrade the Samawah refinery in southern Iraq. According to unconfirmed reports, the Samawah contract
was awarded to Colorado Industrial Construction Services Co.
The Samawah refinery, which lies 370 km southeast of Baghdad,
was originally built in 1977 with a 30,000 b/d capacity. During
the 1991 Gulf War, the plant suffered 90% damage.
The facility was used for storage until 2001, when the oil ministry partially rehabilitated it. But the refinery was looted following
the 2003 invasion and was left idle until 2005, when one 10,000
b/d unit was rehabilitated.
A second 10,000 b/d unit was repaired and began production
in 2006. At some point, according to local sources, a third unit is
to be removed from the Dora refinery in Baghdad and added to the
Samawah facility. ✦

Tengizchevroil to start oil shipments on BTC line
BP Azerbaijan, partially confirming earlier reports, announced that
the Chevron Corp.-led Tengizchevroil consortium plans to start oil shipments this month via the BP-run Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline.
“We expect to start pumping some volumes of Tengizchevroil’s
crude via the [BTC] pipeline in the second half of October,” said
company spokesman Tamam Bayatly. She did not say how much oil
was expected to be delivered.
Earlier this week, BP PLC announced plans to begin shipping oil
from Kazakhstan’s Tengiz oil field via the 1,770-km BTC pipeline
beginning later this month (OGJ Online, Oct. 9, 2008).
BP said the oil would be transported by barge from Kazakhstan
to Azerbaijan and then loaded into the pipeline, with exports from
Ceyhan expected to begin in mid-November.
Late last month, Tengizchevroil was reported to have made an
agreement to ship up to 2 million tonnes/year of oil—possibly rising to 5 million tonnes/year—by barge across the Caspian Sea to
Azerbaijan and onward by rail across Georgia to export terminals
on the Black Sea (OGJ Online, Sept. 25, 2008).
Tengizchevroil has been struggling with its joint venture partners to double the capacity of the CPC pipeline export route to 60
million tonnes/year to accommodate rising output in the Central
Asian country. The pipeline runs from Kazakhstan to Russia’s Black
Sea port of Novorossiisk.
In September, Chevron said its Tengizchevroil affiliate had completed a major expansion at Tengiz field in Kazakhstan that will raise
oil production capacity to 540,000 b/d, up 35% over the 400,000
b/d achieved earlier this year in the firm’s first expansion phase.

Costs rise for Snohvit LNG project
StatoilHydro has increased the estimate of its investment costs
for the first phase of the Snohvit LNG project in the Barents Sea by
3 billion kroner because of problems associated with delivering
the full 4.3 million tonnes/year of LNG capacity at the onshore
liquefaction plant.
On Oct. 16, the company presented a revised budget to Norwegian authorities and stressed that Snohvit was a technically chal10

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

lenging project that had exceeded the September 2005 estimate
of 48.1 billion kroner in nominal terms. “Snohvit is still a highly
profitable and attractive project,” it said.
Snovhit started production last September but has struggled to
regularly deliver at full capacity. Since the scheduled shutdown this
summer Snohvit has maintained stable production at about 80%
of its planned capacity. During a scheduled shutdown in October,
it said, “A number of measures will be implemented to improve
the regularity of the plant, including the replacement of seawater
coolers and measures to limit the emission of nitrogen oxide and
carbon dioxide,” StatoilHydro said (OGJ Online, Oct. 4, 2008).
StatoilHydro will investigate different solutions to reconfigure the
plant and to ensure stable and safe operations. These options could
cost 2.5-5.5 billion kroner, depending on the option chosen.
StatoilHydro said it would make a final decision in 2009 after it
carries out further analysis of the plant’s performance.
The company has shut down production from the field for 30
days to replace two heat exchangers that contributed to the problems in reaching the plant’s full capacity, a company spokesman
told OGJ (OGJ Online, Oct. 15, 2008).

CGT, MarkWest report Appalachian expansion
NiSource Inc. unit Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. and MarkWest Energy Partners LP intend to jointly expand natural gas gathering and processing services to support increased production volumes in the Appalachian basin of central West Virginia.
The two companies also are discussing plans with several gas
producers to provide new gathering and processing services near
Columbia’s Cobb aggregation system in Kanawha, Jackson, and
Roane counties, W.Va.
The expansion of services includes MarkWest’s previously announced expansion of its Cobb gas processing plant, increasing
total capacity to about 70 MMcfd from the current 25 MMcfd by
mid-2009. NGLs recovered at Cobb will continue to be fractionated at MarkWest’s Siloam fractionation, marketing, and storage
complex in South Shore, Ky., currently in the final stages of its own
expansion. ✦

Warming debate needed
The US still has a serious energy
problem, and many organizations are
searching for the right energy policy,
with most doing this in a fossil-fuel
constrained world. However, this may be
a terrible constraint as it is possible that
the diagnosis on anthropogenic global
warming (AGW) is erroneous. Today, as
our financial and energy policies hang
in the balance, citizens should demand
an open debate on this fossil-fuel constraint, something that is not happening.
What do the Sloan Professor of Meteorology at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, the founder of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and the
head of the space research laboratory
in St. Petersburg, Russia, have in common? First, they are skeptics of the AGW
hypothesis. They are not fans of Al Gore’s
An Inconvenient Truth, a part of the political science of alarmism that began 40
years ago with Paul Ehrlich’s The Population Bomb. And they are all physicists:
Richard Lindzen, Robert Jastrow, and
Habibullo Abdussamatov.
Physicists might hold the key to this
diagnosis. This commentary is based on
a paper in the International Association
for Energy Economics Energy Forum,
third quarter 2008, entitled “Global
Warming—Witnesses for the Defense of
the Skeptical Perspective: Physicists.”
This struggle is occurring at a time
when every day brings new inputs that
the concern on AGW might be fading.
Examples:
• A recent headline reported, “Thirty
years of warmer temperatures go poof.”
• Recent papers on Greenland Ice
Sheet stability bring needed reality.
• A paper on whether warming is influencing hurricanes was titled “Global
warming to decrease hurricanes.”
• Another publication on concerns
the Gulf Stream was in danger was titled
“Ocean circulation noisy, not stalling.”
One might wonder how a barely
discernable 0.6º C. increase since the late
19th century can gain acceptance as the
source of weather catastrophes. Answer:
Those with a vested interest in climate
alarmism have cranked up the propaganda.

This interest in physicists started with
a 2006 Houston Chronicle interview
with Chris Rapley of the British Antarctic
Survey. He asked, “If carbon is increasing, how can you deny there’s going to
be warming?” Rapley stated if you knew
how physics worked, you would stop
arguing on AGW.
How then do physicists see AGW? As
openers, a 1990 analysis by Jastrow, plus
William Nierenberg and Frederic Seitz
(all now deceased), showed a range of
0.4-1.8º C. for the next century. This was
much lower than the United Nations
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change reported in 1990, a range of
1.5-4.5º C. The above physicists viewed
this as alarmist. They agree, if the assumptions they used are valid, there
will be some warming—but nowhere
as big as the IPCC would like the public
to believe. Then the IPCC report in 2001
boosted the range to 1.4-5.8º C.
Lindzen, the MIT professor, noted in
1993 that model predictions depend on
large increases in carbon dioxide plus
mechanisms within the models that
amplify the climatic response to increasing CO2. These amplifications need to be
debated. In 2006 Lindzen also noted that
alarmists intimidate dissenters, saying
scientists who deviate from alarmism
have seen their funds disappear.
Abdussamatov reported that Mars also
has global warming. But parallel warmings on Mars and Earth can only be a
result of an increase in the one factor
common to both planets: solar irradiation. Abdussamatov now believes this has
peaked and sees deep cooling by 2040.
Two additional witnesses, of the 17
covered in the energy economics paper,
are cited below.
Sherwood Idso, a former research
physicist at the US Water Conservation
Lab in Phoenix and an adjunct professor of botany at Arizona State University,
has argued that increasing CO2 levels are
beneficial due to an increase in photosynthesis, leading to significant increases
in crop and forest growth.
Hendrick Tennekes, former director
of research, Royal Dutch Meteorological
Institute, lost his post due to his views
on climate modeling. He is concerned
with the monopoly that modeling has

on climate research. An example of the
many shortcomings with models: They
don’t include feedbacks between changing farming and forest practices and atmospheric circulation. For this and other
reasons they can’t agree on precipitation
patterns, a far more relevant factor to
food production than a tiny increase in
temperature. Tennekes concluded: “We
only understand 10% of the climate issue.”
Several conclusions follow:
• The claim that we face an imminent
catastrophe is unfounded and terribly
inappropriate.

C

a

l

e

n

d

a

• The views of 17 physicists/mathematicians are proof of a serious debate
on AGW.
• The claim that “all scientists agree”
is juvenile at best, fraudulent at worst.
• All scientists need to reconsider the
position of Thomas Huxley: Skepticism
is the highest of duties for scientists,
blind faith the one unpardonable sin.
Indeed, with all of this testimony
against the AGW hypothesis and climate
alarmism, one might ask if it is not time
to have this issue tossed out of court.

Oil shale promise
65 billion tonnes of oil shale that is at
shallow depth and suitable for mining
and surface retorting. Although Jordan
had actively sought companies for
developing these resources, in August
it placed an 18-month freeze on all oil
shale activities within central Jordan,
including the Attarat Um Ghudran and
Wadi Maghar regions, so that the government could explore for and exploit
uranium deposits.
But several companies have completed feasibility studies on developing
oil shale in Jordan. For instance Eesti
Energia’s feasibility study, released in
May, indicated that just one of Jordan’s
20 locations containing oil shale could
produce 36,000 b/d of shale oil.
Morocco again is seeking to start oil
shale exploitation. It had a pilot plant
operating in the 1980s in the Timahdit
area, but shut it down because of the
low oil price at that time. Recently it
signed an agreement with Petrobras
and Total SA to evaluate a shale oil
producing facility in Timahdit that uses
Petrosix technology.
In Australia, QER Pty. Ltd. has
acquired an oil shale resource base
in Queensland that it estimates holds
almost 16 billion bbl of oil in place.
The area includes the Stuart site that for
a few years produced shale oil through
an ATP retort. QER has decommissioned
the ATP retort, and its plans are to use a

Estonia has processed oil shale since

more oil shale to liquid fuel and gas.

The whipsaw effect
Extreme swings in the price of oil are bad for
everyone. Price-related political mistakes compound the damage.
Before the middle of last July, the searing question was how high the price of crude might go. The
answer, based on futures trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange: $147/bbl. Now the question
is how low the crude price might go. The answer:
Who knows? The recent low for the weekly average
New York Mercantile Exchange price came the week
of Dec. 11, 1998, at $11.09/bbl. Does that seem
impossibly low? It did then, too.
In a business whose basic commodity can
change in value by a factor of 13 in a decade’s
time, investment planning is difficult enough. It
becomes many times more so when governments
react to price movements under the classically
mistaken assumption that trends of the moment
last forever.

Dissolving comforts
Official excess is playing out dramatically—but
by no means uniquely—in Russia. Afloat in oil
revenue when crude prices were $100/bbl and
rising, Moscow turned against democratization
and privatization. A newly prosperous and always
nationalistic population cheered the authoritarian
relapse.
With crude prices now barely above $60/bbl
and falling, Russian comforts are dissolving. The
country’s stock market is collapsing. Inflation is
transporting the pain of macroeconomic distress
to consumers. Political problems for iron-fisted
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin are not out of the
question. Internationally, Putin has lost standing
by, among other things, using military troops
and gas exports to bully neighbors. Lately he has
wooed blowhard President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, which has misappropriated its oil bounty
even more severely and soon will learn the hard
way what depletion and depreciation mean.
Mistakes made when oil prices rise don’t correct themselves when prices fall. The international
industry will not soon forget Moscow’s abuse
of Royal Dutch Shell in the Sakhalin-2 oil and
gas project in the Russian Far East. Complaining
about delays and cost hikes that were not unique
to Sakhalin-2, the government used trumped-up
environmental complaints to wrestle controlling
interest away from Shell and its partners and into
18

the hands of state-owned Gazprom. Since then,
Moscow has shaken down international companies
in other Russian ventures.
Russia isn’t alone in having groped for riches
when oil prices were high. It’s simply, like Venezuela, among the most brazenly extortionate. Other
countries renegotiated agreements or otherwise
changed terms of participation by private investors
to raise the state claim on proceeds of oil and gas
production. Not all of them are centralized powers
like Russia and Venezuela.
Benign Alberta, for example, changed its
royalty regime in response to complaints that the
state wasn’t receiving a fair share from oil sands
development and conventional production. The
increased government take now amplifies the effects of plunging commodity prices. The Canadian
gas industry is shriveling, therefore, and operators are reconsidering oil sands investments. The
US, too, raised the royalty on production from
new federal offshore leases and more recently, in
a nasty manifestation of pique over high gasoline
prices, denied oil and gas companies access to tax
relief due other American industries.
To some extent, companies expect governments
to grab resource wealth when oil and gas prices
rise. And to some extent, depending on how
agreements are written, rising prices do ease the
damage to project economics.

Extreme grabs
The latest grabs by governments, however, were
as extreme as the price surge that precipitated
them. Venezuela’s crackdown represented nothing
less than renationalization of the oil and gas business. Moscow’s reassertion of control fundamentally changed the Russian investment climate—and
not for the better. While not nearly as harsh as
those moves, Alberta’s royalty change damages
fragile oil sands economics in a down market
and thus slows an important engine of provincial
growth. And the US is fast showing itself to be officially hostile to oil and gas.
By discouraging investment in future supply beyond the effects of slumping prices, developments
like these will aggravate the next market cycle.
While prices will always fluctuate, the governmental whipsaw effect helps no one. Moderating
it should become a new priority of governmentindustry relations. ✦

there have been important strides in
acquisition, processing (especially 3D
prestack depth migration), and interpretation, with the advent of seismic
workstations. (Prestack depth migration
moves seismic reflections to their correct locations in space in areas where
subsurface sound velocities undergo
unusually rapid changes. Because the
processing occurs before a summing
of reflection data known as stack, the
step requires considerable computing
power.)
“At the beginning of my career in
the 1970s, these methods were in their
infancy, while today 3D seismic surveys are the norm,” Lines says. “These
advances came about when we realized

The two companies both provide
offshore oil and gas exploration and
production waste disposal services
along the Louisiana Gulf Coast, according to the FTC.
It added that, in response to concerns the federal agency raised, CCS sent
a letter Oct. 15 informing the commission that it would have to shut down its
Gulf Coast operations and leave the area
if it could not acquire Newpark’s US
environmental services operations.
The agency said CCS made that claim
only after the antitrust review process
was well under way and it appeared that
the commission would challenge the
transaction. It said that nothing in CCS’s
business files supports the argument
that the company’s Gulf Coast business is not viable or that CCS’s survival
depends on the acquisition of Newpark
Environmental Service’s US operations.
“There is ample evidence that this
transaction would allow CCS to eliminate its primary and closest competitor
and that the merging parties’ customers
would face higher prices and diminished service as a result. CCS’s lastminute threats to shut down its entire
Gulf Coast business if the merger is
challenged are mere pretext and cannot
justify this anticompetitive transaction,”
said David P. Wales, acting director of
the FTC’s Bureau of Competition.
The FTC’s complaint contends that
the proposed transaction would violate
Section 7 of the Clayton Act and Section

5 of the FTC Act by eliminating vigorous direct competition between CCS
and Newpark Environmental Service
which has led to lower prices and
better service for their customers. The
companies are the only major offshore
production waste disposal services operating in the ports of Fourchon, Venice,
Morgan City, and Intracoastal City, La.,
it noted.
FTC alleged that the proposed acquisition makes it more likely that CCS
would raise prices or reduce the quality
of its services on its own, especially to
customers who prefer its waste disposal
methods. Additionally, with only two
firms remaining and the presence of
market conditions conducive to competitor coordination, the FTC said, the
proposed transaction threatens to make
coordinated interaction between the
two companies more likely.

Newpark studies options
In a statement following the FTC’s
announcement, Newpark Resources
said it disagrees with the agency’s
conclusions and is evaluating its options. It said that it would provide more
information regarding the transaction’s
status during the company’s third-quarter conference call Oct. 31.
“In light of public statements
released by the FTC, CCS is currently
reviewing whatever legal remedies
may be available,” a spokeswoman for

Newpark Resources wrote OGJ in an
e-mail dated Oct. 23. “Until we receive
all anticipated communication from
the FTC, we are unable to comment
further,” she said.
In its latest 10-Q filing with the
US Securities and Exchange Commission for the 3 months ending June 30,
Newpark Resources said it decided
to consider selling its environmental
services operations in 2007 following
a company-wide review of its operations. The company said it continues to
operate two business segments: fluids
systems and engineering, which serve
the oil and gas business, and mats and
integrated services, which has utilities,
municipalities, and government sectors
as its customers.
It said it initially agreed to sell its US
environmental services business to Trinity TLM Acquisitions in October 2007
for $81.5 million in cash, plus potentially another $8 million which could
be earned under a 5-year earn-out provision. Trinity terminated the agreement
in April 2008 when it could not get the
necessary financing due to tightening
credit markets, Newpark Resources said.
Newpark reached an agreement to sell
the operations to CCS for $85 million
cash soon afterwards.
FTC said the complaint would be
filed in US District Court for the Southern District of Texas by Oct. 23, and
would be posted online at the FTC’s
web site. ✦

GAO ﬁnds agencies using oil products to fuel AFVs
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Federal government agencies are
meeting requirements to acquire alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs), but they
currently are running them on petroleum products, the US Government
Accountability Office said Oct. 23.
“As they have over the past 4 years,
agencies will likely continue to acquire
the mandated percentage of AFVs.

However, they will likely find it more
difficult to meet both the requirement
to fuel AFVs only with alternative fuel
and the goal of increasing alternative
fuel use by 10%/year because of the
limited availability of alternative fuels,”
GAO said in a report.
The congressional government
watchdog service examined 21 agencies
and their vehicle fleets, which were trying to meet energy objectives for fiscal
2007. It found that all of the agencies

satisfied a requirement under the 2002
Energy Policy Act that AFVs account for
75% of new light-duty acquisitions for
fleets of 20 or more vehicles in metropolitan statistical areas with populations
of 250,000 or more.
But it also found that none of the 21
agencies were solely using an alternative

none of the agencies were acquiring

they were not available yet.
“It is unclear whether agencies will
be able to reduce petroleum consumption annually by 2% in the near future,
primarily because they will not be able

significant amounts of petroleum fuel,”

hen voter unrest over $4/gal
gasoline prices made Congress
consider expanding US offshore oil
and gas development late last summer, one group already was asking specific questions about the US
coastal area where a lot of energy
development has taken place.
America’s Energy Coast (AEC) is a
coalition of organizations that often
don’t talk to each other. The coalition
does, however, recognize that Gulf
Coast sustainability issues must be
constructively addressed.
It includes major oil companies,
business and transportation interests,
environmental organizations, sporting and recreational groups, and state
and local officials from Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama, and Texas.
“Coastal communities which
provide a workforce for Outer Continental Shelf development are literally
disappearing,” said Sidney Coffee, a
senior advisor to America’s Wetland
Foundation and a former chairwoman of the Louisiana Coastal Protection
and Restoration Authority who has
worked on Louisiana coastal issues
for more than 10 years.

Common sustainability issues
The foundation established AEC
to bring every affected stakeholder
together to work out solutions, she
told me during a mid-October visit
to Washington. The group is trying to
bring common sustainability issues
into the national energy conversation.
It issued a sustainability accord on
July 24 and will hold a policy forum
on Dec. 2 in Washington.
“This is more than simply deciding
what’s needed. We’re trying to identify
conflicting policies among the four
26

states. We’re also looking at national
policies which hinder states’ efforts.
This may be the best way to solve
these serious problems,” Coffee said.
There are still disagreements within
the group over strategies, she continued.
Some representatives want to take immediate mitigation steps, while others
back adaptation measures. There also is
no climate change consensus, but Coffee
said everyone has kept talking.

liquefaction plants account for the rest.
Qatar alone is spending $21 billion for
its project,” Schlesinger said.
The current 25 bcfd of worldwide
LNG capacity could grow by 50% by
2015, he forecasts. “Additional projects
are behind this, although the world
credit crisis could lead to some delays,”
he said.
Reliable deliveries at the lowest
prices are the long-term bottom line,
according to Bill Cooper, president of
the Center for LNG. “LNG fits into the
mix. Once an exporter starts a liquefaction train, it has to keep running. The
LNG needs to find a home and the US
is a huge gas market,” he said following
the briefing. ✦

CFTC asked about

High on 2009 agenda
Congress and the administration of
President George W. Bush were working on a general economic rescue
when I spoke with Coffee, but she was
optimistic that federal lawmakers and
the new president would be looking at
these issues early in 2009.
“Hurricane Ike literally was a
game-changer. It’s no longer just a
New Orleans issue. When this region
is even partially shut in, it can have
far-reaching effects. Ask anyone who
had to wait to buy gasoline in Atlanta
recently,” she explained.
She has been invited to visit some
North Carolina coastal communities in
November that are considering supporting OCS development, and that want
to learn more about the Gulf Coast’s
experience. “My message will be that
the challenges are big, but they’re not
insurmountable.You just have to go in
with your eyes open,” Coffee said. ✦

Three US House Energy and Commerce Committee Democrats on Oct.

the potential impact of unregulated
energy commodity swaps and futures
on prices.
Committee chairman John D. Dingell (Mich.) and the chairman of two

wealth funds, index funds, and other
institutional investors in 33 energy and
agricultural commodities,” the three
committee members said in a letter to
Acting CFTC Chairman Walter L. Lukken.
But the report raises more questions
than it answers, they continued, after
conceding that the CFTC staff was under
pressure “to analyze massive amounts
of data in a matter of weeks to meet the
commission’s Sept. 15 deadline.”

“First, CFTC collected 7 months of
data but only summarized 3 months
of data in its report. It also left out data
on the size of the investments in each
‘brand’ of index. Second, CFTC requested data on single commodity swaps
positions but presented no information
on these positions. Third, there is no
evidence that CFTC validated the data it
received,” the three federal lawmakers
said.
Their questions included how swaps

were classified in the report; whether
the CFTC or reporting entities such
as swap dealers or investment banks
assigned the commercial and noncommercial designations; what led to the
CFTC’s reclassifying a major market
participant as a result of the special call,
and whether other market participants
have been reclassified; and whether
the CFTC or the swap dealers made the
“futures equivalent” calculations used
in the report. ✦

said in a note.
The pipeline spur, which will cost
an estimated $800 million, will branch
off the ESPO pipeline at the Russian
town of Skovorodino and extend to the
Chinese border. There, it will join the
Chinese pipeline network to reach the
oil hub of Daqing in northern China.
“Transneft has prepared blueprints
for the spur, whose technical details are
in the phase of being agreed with the
Chinese side,” Sechin said earlier this
week, ahead of meetings with Chinese
energy officials.
The ESPO is being built in two
phases and aims at exporting Russian
crude oil to the Asia-Pacific region.
Phase one involves construction of a
30 million tpy oil pipeline from Taishet to
Skovorodino. Phase two will see construction extended from Skovorodino to the
port of Kozmino on Russia’s Pacific Coast,
increasing capacity to 80 million tpy.
Until the completion of Phase 2,
oil will be delivered by pipeline from
Taishet to Skovorodino and then by rail
from Skovorodino to Kozmino where
an export terminal is already under
construction.
Earlier this month, Russian Energy
Minister Sergei Shmatko, while acknowledging a new agreement to sell
oil to China, stated that the projected
ESPO pipeline spur sought by the Chinese would not be ready before 2009

Flash Gordon
backs down

B

ritish Prime Minister Gordon
Brown has very rarely been
viewed as a friend of the oil and gas
industry, but his lack of popularity
took a new low last week.
It started when Brown called for
an international oil summit to be
held in London this coming December, but failed to invite the leaders of
several members of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
OPEC Sec. Gen. Abdalla el-Badri
drew attention to the slight on Oct.
28, saying that some of the group’s
ministers had not received invitations
from Brown to the proposed meeting.
As a result of the oversight, elBadri said the group would boycott
Brown’s conference unless invitations
were extended to all the heads of
state of individual OPEC countries.
Brown’s people quickly backtracked.

‘Ignore my U-turn’
The UK’s Department for Energy
and Climate Change confirmed
that Brown’s summit idea had been
dropped and that a ministerial-level
meeting would be held instead.
Brown’s office said, “Given the
fact that there will be a world leaders’ meeting anyway on Nov. 15 to
discuss the international economic
situation and no doubt oil will be
discussed as part of that, we decided
to revert to the form of approach
taken at the Jeddah meeting, which
was that this should be a meeting
primarily of energy ministers.”
Brown did not limit his unpopularity with the oil and gas industry
to members of OPEC. In fact, he
decided to take on international oil
companies as a whole, saying that
energy firms should make reduc28

tions in gasoline and home fuel bills
to reflect the currently falling price
of oil.
Brown said, “There has been
more than a halving in the price
of oil and, just as when the price
goes up people see it immediately
reflected in the petrol pump prices,
we want to see the falling price
reflected in the petrol pump prices,
and we are determined to see that
happens.”

City Spy weighs in
He could probably do that very
easily by following some advice from
the City Spy column in London’s
Evening Standard newspaper.
“Gordon Brown is banging on
again about high petrol prices and
oil companies making too much
money,” City Spy wrote on Oct 29.
“At the moment it’s BP, next it will be
Shell.”
But who is really making the killing at the pumps?
“Yes,” said City Spy, “you guessed
it, the PM and his Chancellor Alistair
Darling, who take two-thirds in fuel
duty and Value Added Tax.”
“That’s right, a whopping twothirds—more than 66 pence with
petrol at £1/l. If Flash Gordon really
wanted to help struggling families
and businesses through the economic downturn, how about starting
here.”
City Spy was not the only one to
notice Brown’s cant.
“He just wants to blame somebody and he is blaming OPEC,” said
al-Badri, who dismissed Brown’s
criticism of the group’s decision to
cut oil production as “hypocritical.” ✦

The American Bureau of Shipping,
ConocoPhillips, Sovcomflot Ltd., and
Samsung Heavy Industries Ltd. are
jointly participating in a pioneering
study to measure the effect of ice loads
on Arctic-class shuttle tanker performance.
The US Congressional Information
Bureau Daily Maritime Bulletin said the
joint project will provide researchers
with important data regarding stresses
shuttle tankers experience when operating in ice-covered waters.
“We have considerable experience
measuring ice loads on ice breakers
and smaller ships, but the scale effect
of large ships operating in heavy ice
conditions is not as well defined,” said
Aleksandr Iyerusalimskiy, part of ConocoPhillips’s project services section.
The study will be conducted on the
70,000-dwt Shturman Albanov during
its initial two winter seasons operating
in the Barents Sea.
The Shturman Albanov is the third in
a series of Arctic shuttle tankers scheduled for delivery from SHI, and is due
in February 2009. CIB said a state-ofthe-art monitoring system will employ
fiberoptic sensors within the ice belt
at two locations in the bow and stern
quarters to measure and record ice
pressures and loads.
The system also will compute iceinduced responses of the hull structure
at highly loaded locations, while a
bridge display depicting a color plot of
the pressure distribution over each area
includes an alarm to alert crews of large
impacts.
“The goal is to provide real time
feedback to operators, reducing the
uncertainty that can exist today, and
then use this information to mitigate

the risks involved,” said ABS’s research
& development manager Han Yu.
“As vessel requirements change to
meet industry needs, research continues
to assess the practicality of these new
designs in more extreme operating
conditions. It is a fundamental element
in the cycle of ship design.”
Sovcomflot took delivery of Russia’s first Arctic shuttle tanker, the Vasily
Dinkov, from SHI last year.
The Vasily Dinkov, along with sister
tankers Shturman Albanov and Kapitan Gotsky has an ice-enhanced hull
structure, designed in accordance with
LU6 (1A Super) ice-class, under the
classification of the Russian Register of
Shipping.
The ships will be able to operate in
temperatures of –40° C. and in breaking ice as thick as 1.5 m without an
icebreaker escort.

The Vasily Dinkov is said to be one
of the most advanced Arctic oil tankers in the world. One end of the ship
is fitted with an ice-breaking bow, the
other with a more conventional opensea bow. The propeller system can rotate
360° so the tanker can pass through the
open sea or plow through ice without
sacrificing fuel efficiency.
Earlier this year, the tanker’s design
passed a major test when it delivered a
shipment of oil from the Varandey oil
terminal in the Barents Sea to the port
of Come by Chance, off the coast of
Newfoundland.
It was the first time such a shipment was made from the icy waters of
the Barents Sea without an icebreaker
escort.
“Our company has created a unique
sea-export system which makes it possible to transport large quantities of oil

to Polar regions,” said Vagit Alekperov,
chief executive officer of Lukoil, which
owns the terminal. “It is unrivalled in
the world.”
Meanwhile, production of the tankers is moving ahead as Russia’s Admiralty Shipyard plans to move an enhanced
ice-class tanker, the Mikhail Ulyanov,
from a dry dock to a wet dock on Oct.
31 for the final stages of construction
work.
The St. Petersburg-based shipyard is
building Sovcomflot two 70,000 dwt
enhanced ice-class tankers, designed to
ship oil from Prirazlomnoye, an Arctic
oil field operated by OAO Gazprom
subsidiary Sevmorneftegaz.
Construction of the Mikhail Ulyanov
started in 2007 and is to be completed
in the summer of 2009, while the
second tanker, the Kirill Lavrov, will be
launched in 2009. ✦

Chevron on trial in San Francisco for rights abuses
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Chevron Corp. is at the center of a
legal case before federal court in San
Francisco that will ask jurors to decide
whether the firm sanctioned human
rights abuses that resulted in the deaths
and injuries of protesters at its Nigerian
facilities, or whether the company was
simply protecting its employees from
belligerent kidnappers.
The lawsuit—identified as Bowoto
vs. Chevron, No. C99-2506SI (N.D.
Calif.)—alleges that Chevron, in conjunction with the Nigerian military,
engaged in torture, assaults, and the
killing of two protesters over Chevron’s
environmental record and its failure to
hire locals in the delta region near its
oil drilling operations.
Both sides in the current case recognize that the impending courtroom
battle, described by one observer as
“epic,” has legal implications that reach
far beyond a single incident by one
corporation operating in Nigeria.

“This case could have serious ramifications for workers in developing parts
of the world,” said Charles A. James,
Chevron vice-president and general
counsel.
“If plaintiffs had their way, a company could not report hostage-taking
to law enforcement authorities without
facing the threat of a lawsuit in the US,”
James said.
Dan Stormer of Hadsell, Stormer,
Keeny, Richardson & Renick in Pasadena, Calif., is representing the plaintiffs,
a group of Nigerians who were injured
during protests on a Chevron offshore
oil platform in 1998.
Stormer said his firm is trying to
hold a corporation liable for its bad
actions in another country, even if it is
committed by their surrogates, a wholly
owned subsidiary, or by the Nigerian
government.
According to Chevron, the hostagetaking incident occurred 10 years ago
on oil facilities operated off the Nigerian coast by Chevron Corp. subsidiary
Chevron Nigeria Ltd. (CNL). More than

100 CNL workers and contractors were
held for ransom and threatened with
acts of violence.
Chevron said the incident began
when plaintiff Larry Bowoto and other
members of the Concerned Ilaje Citizens, an unsanctioned Nigerian community group, threatened CNL with
violence and sea piracy if the company
did not pay them money and give them
jobs. Weeks later, according to Chevron,
they followed through on their threats
by seizing the oil platform, an adjacent
barge, and a tug boat on May 25, 1998,
holding CNL employees and contractors hostage and demanding money and
other considerations. CNL attempted to
negotiate a resolution without success.
“Although plaintiffs say they were
peaceful protestors, eyewitnesses have
testified in deposition that the hostage
takers poured diesel fuel on the barge
and threatened to set it on fire,” Chevron said.
Fearing for the safety of its workers,
and with tensions mounting, CNL asked
for assistance from the Nigerian Navy.

Under Nigerian law, only the country’s
military can provide armed security.
“Now the hostage takers are suing
Chevron, claiming that CNL should not
have reported the matter to Nigerian
law enforcement officials and that the
Nigerian authorities used excessive
force in rescuing the workers,” Chevron
said.

According to the National Law Journal, the case against Chevron is one of a
handful in recent years that have used a
200-year-old law, created originally to
provide redress to the victims of piracy
at sea, and known as the Alien Tort
Claims Act.
The NLJ said a body of law has since

developed that allows people injured
in other countries to seek redress in US
courts.

SUCCEEDING In A Changing Environment
As the industry shifts to deeper water, the environment in
which we work becomes more complex, hazardous and
expensive. Successful companies recognize early the
changing conditions and environmental challenges facing
the industry. At the Deepwater Operations Conference &
Exhibition in 2008, participants and attendees will discuss
how to succeed under these extreme conditions.

Plan to attend, sponsor and exhibit at the 2008 conference
and exhibition as the technical focus shifts to “Succeeding
in a Changing Environment.” As with our past conferences,
proceedings will not be published and the press will not be
invited to assure conﬁdentiality between the attendees and
the speakers allowing the most up–to–date information to
be shared.

Nigeria also is in talks with Algeria’s
Sonatrach to provide gas for the jointly
proposed 1,300-km Trans Saharan Gas
Pipeline from Warri, in Delta State, to
Algeria for distribution into Europe’s

gas grid. “Adequate (gas) reserves have
been set aside for the TSGP for the first
25 years of operation,” said Emmanuel
Olatunde Odusina, Nigeria’s Minister of
State for Energy (Gas) earlier this year.
Nigeria’s other major goal is to increase “local content”—the training and
contracting of local workers, consultancies, suppliers, contractors, shippers,
insurers, and financial institutions to
boost the country’s gross national product. NLNG-T7 alone reportedly would
provide 10,000 local content jobs.
The government’s goal is 70% local
content by 2010. ✦

Malaysia downplays territorial dispute with Indonesia
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
The Malaysian government, attempting to downplay recent concerns about
a possible military conflict with Indonesia, said the Bukat Block, operated by
Italy’s Eni SPA, falls outside the territory
disputed with Indonesia.
“The Bukat Block is located outside
Malaysian territory, based on the 1979
Malaysian map,” said Mohd Norhisyam
Mohd Yusof, first secretary for bilateral
and regional cooperation at the Malaysian embassy in Jakarta.
In making his announcement,
Norhisyam said some parties had
wrongly referred to the block as part
of the maritime area of Ambalat, off
eastern Kalimantan, which is thought to
contain huge reserves of oil and gas.
Indonesia’s Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro
last week said Eni had sought government protection in building a floating
LNG plant on Bukat Block due to concerns of an ongoing dispute over the
area between Indonesia and Malaysia.
“Eni has found big oil and gas
reserves in the block. They are now
planning to build a floating LNG plant
in the area. For this, the company is asking the government to provide certainty
for its operations,” said Purnomo after
32

meeting with visiting Eni Chief Executive Paolo Scaroni.
Indonesia and Malaysia have long
been involved in a dispute over the
Ambalat territory, which consists of the
Ambalat Block and the East Ambalat
Block.
In 2007, Malaysia sent naval ships
and warplanes into Indonesian waters
to protect its ND-6 and ND-7 Blocks,
which overlap the Ambalat Block.
In 2005, Eni suspended exploration
on both Bukat Block and Ambalat Block
when tensions between the two countries rose over the territory.
At the time, Eni had drilled three
wells on the Bukat Block that indicated large reserves of oil, according to
Kardya Warnika, then head of Indonesia’s oil and gas executive board (BP
Migas).
Tensions have recently resurfaced,
with both sides adding to them.
On Oct. 21, Indonesia’s Armed
Forces commander Gen. Djoko Santoso
said elements of Malaysia’s armed forces
were committing territorial violations
in and around Ambalat Block.
Santoso said Malaysia was continuing
to claim the block as part of its territory
and that Indonesia would respond by
intensifying maritime and air patrols
around the block to match the presence
of Malaysian troops.

According to analyst Global Insight,
“the growing buildup of troops in the
region raises the possibility of disruption to Eni’s development plans as well
as armed clashes, which would scupper
ongoing negotiations between the two
countries on demarcating a mutually
acceptable maritime border for the
disputed zone.” ✦

basin. The Tuha oil field
Drilling
is the only integrated
condensate-gas field
development in the Turpan Hami Oil
field Branch, Shanshan, Xinjiang Uygur
autonomous region of China.
Low-permeability, dense reservoirs
are commonly characterized by a high
content of clays, high original water
saturation, high sensitivity to invasive
fluids, high capillary pressure, complicated structure and anisotropic, and
high flow-resistance.
Generally, these reservoirs also contain numerous natural microfractures,
probably leading to stress sensibility.
This article reviews the geological
characteristics and potential damage in
the Tuha sandstone, a dense Jurassic reservoir, and introduces a new, multifunctional drilling fluid system.
The fluid includes preventive, waterblocking surfactants and consists mainly
of amphion polymer, sulfonation polymer, ideal packing temporary bridging
agents (TBA), and film-forming agents.
We include a systematic analysis
of the main damage mechanisms and
factors influencing water-blocking.
Numerous studies have shown that the
extent of water-blocking ranges from

O D U C T I O N

70% to 90%.1-5 Once damaged, reservoirs can rarely be recovered.
Researchers at China University of
Petroleum in Beijing experimentally
evaluated the rheological properties,
inhibition, compatibility, and regained
permeability of the new fluid. Both lab
evaluations and field tests show that
the new amphion, sulfonation polymer drilling fluid is suitable for lowpermeability dense
gas reservoirs in
China’s Tuha oil
field.

Geological
characteristics

Chinese design drilling ﬂuids
for Tuha’s Jurassic sandstone

In the oilproducing, Jurassic, Qiudong formation, the main lithology is fine sand.
Porosity ranges from 11.9% to 13.5%;
permeability ranges from 0.08 × 10–3
μm2 to 13.6 × 10–3 μm2; and radii of
pore throats range from 0.1 to 1.0 μm
(average 0.28 μm). Most of the rock has
microfine pore throats along with many
micro fractures; this plays a leading role
in seepage flow and reduces or eliminates storage capacity.
In short, the target formation can be
characterized as a typical low-permeability, dense formation with microporosity. Hydraulic fracturing is the main
method for enhancing oil-gas recovery
during production operations.

rary bridging agents and size distribution of pore throats, we determined the
D90 (largest pore throat) of TBA using
the ideal packing theory (IPT) and
the D90 rule.7 We used corresponding
matching software, considered shearing and abrasion of TBA in the annulus
between drillstring and wellbore. Finally, we determined the ideal packing
composition for a calcium carbonatebased TBA: 600 mesh (10%); 800 mesh
(40%); 1,000 mesh (50%), as shown
in Fig. 3.
We measured rheological parameters and dynamic loss of drilling fluids
after adding the optimized TBA (Fig. 4,
Table 5). The rheological parameters
are reasonable and filtration is further
reduced. The total loss falls to 4 ml from
12 ml. The initial instantaneous loss fell
dramatically, illustrating that the introduction of the optimized TBA helped to
protect the formation. We recommend a
4% concentration of this TBA in drilling
fluids.

Rental units supplied power during Sakhalin-2 construction
During construction
of Sakhalin-2 Phase 2
production facilities,
rental units provided a
wide range of flexible
power systems, accordProduction
ing to Aggreko PLC,
provider of the units.
Aggreko says the units supplied power during construction, commissioning,
tow, and offshore hookup of the LUN-A
and the PA-B production platforms off
the eastern coast of Russia.
The platforms are four-legged concrete gravity-base substructures (CGBS)
with fully integrated decks and living
quarters for more than 100 people.
Sakhalin Energy Investment Co. Ltd.
(SEIC) is the operator for developing
the Sakhalin-2 integrated oil and gas
project. Partners in SEIC are Shell Sakhalin Holdings BV, 55%; Mitsui Sakhalin
Holdings BV, 25%; and Diamond Gas
Sakhalin BV, 20%.
Production from Phase 1 started in
July 1999 from the PA-A gravity based
Molikpaq platform (OGJ, Oct. 1, 2001,
p. 58). Phase 1 produces oil from the
Vityaz complex that consists of the
Molikpaq production platform, a single
anchor-leg mooring buoy, and the Okha
floating storage and offloading unit.

Construction and commissioning of the Sakhalin-2 LUN-A platform required temporary power and
safety packages (Fig. 1). Photo from Aggreko.

Aggreko says it delivered temporary
power and safety packages for the final
phases of the platform’s topsides construction and subsequent commissioning (Fig. 1). The company retained the
power plant and fire and gas detection
and suppression equipment for supplying security during the tow period and
for the offshore power cable hookup
that required reliable power supply.

16,000 bo/d. The platform has 27 well
slots.
SEIC installed the gravity base in
2005 and the topsides in June 2006. It
expects production to start in November 2008.

as well as for the tow, power hookup,
and commissioning phases offshore.
SEIC installed the 103,000-ton concrete base in July 4, 2005, with topsides
installed in July 2007. It completed the
hookup and commissioning in November 2007. SEIC expects production to
start by yearend 2008.
Pilton-Astokhskoye field will produce from an oil reservoir with associated gas.
The PA-B platform is in 32 m of water, 13 km from the northeastern coast
of Sakhalin Island. PA-B has a capacity
to produce 70,000 bo/d and 92 MMcfd
of gas.

Testing, commissioning
As well as Aggreko supplying the
highly flexible temporary power packages, SHI awarded a contract to Aggreko
for the testing and commissioning of
the PA-B platform’s own turbine generators.
Aggreko says this task required it to
deliver a rental 30 Mw, 6.6-kv resistive reactive load-bank testing package
to the SHI shipyard in Korea 3 months
prior to the sail-away of the PA-B topsides.
It notes that the testing of the platform’s turbine generators proved that

the power equipment was in good condition and fully operable and ensured
that the onboard power plant would
deliver the power as needed.
The company adds that LUN-A
topsides did not need the testing package because the platform will rely on a
submarine cable for power.

Emergency power
Due to an emergency at the onshore
processing facility’s (OPF) power plant
on Sakhalin Island, SEIC also contracted
Aggreko to supply two 22.5 Mv-amp
high-voltage transformers on a rental
basis because during the commissioning of the OPF’s permanent power
plant’s transformer system, a serious
fault developed on both main turbine
transformers.
The two transformers came from
Aggreko’s facility in Dubai and SEIC
shipped the two 40-ton transformers
from Dubai to Sakhalin Island onboard
an Elusion 76 air cargo plane in two
trips.
Aggreko says the emergency power
project took a few days with the
transformers delivered on a rental
basis within 10 days of the emergency
call. ✦

SECOND-THIRD
QUARTERS 2008

A strong sense of déjà vu pervaded
Gulf Coast propane markets during
third-quarter 2008, as comparisons of
September 2008 with the hurricane
season of 2005 abounded. But US
propane markets also suffered from
inventory accumulation rates during
second quarter that fell below normal,
as occurred in 2007.
The volume of propane in primary
storage is an important element of supply
for the winter heating season. This article
discusses how markets
will cope with lackluster propane inventory
accumulation during
second and third quarters.
Although landfall dates for Hurricanes Gustav and Ike were eerily similar
to Katrina and Rita in 2005, August
and September are the months of peak
storm activity during the hurricane
season. While Gustav and Ike traversed
the Gulf of Mexico, they were substantially weaker than Katrina and Rita, both
Category 5 storms at some point before
making landfall.
Although all four storms came
ashore in Louisiana or the Upper Texas
Coast, the exact points of landfall in
2008 were significantly different from
those in 2005. Katrina in 2005 moved
ashore to the east of New Orleans,
while Gustav in 2008 came ashore to
the city’s west. Hurricane Rita in 2005
made landfall at Port Arthur, Tex., just
inside the Texas-Louisiana border; Ike
in September 2008 came ashore over
Galveston, Tex.
Katrina affected only those plants
in southeast Louisiana (20% of US

capacity), while Rita affected only those
plants bounded by Beaumont, Port
Arthur, and Orange in the west and
by Lake Charles, La., in the east. These
plants comprise 17% of US capacity.
Differences in landfall points for the
storms of 2008 resulted in substantial differences in their impacts on the
petrochemical industry. Gustav directly
affected 20% of US capacity, while Ike
directly affected 67% of total US ethylene capacity or more than three times
the capacity at risk due to Gustav.

Feedstock demand
Typically, feedstock demand for
propane rebounds during first quarter, when the winter heating season
begins winding down. During winter
2007-08, however, inventories were 9
million bbl below the 3-year average
at the beginning of the heating season.
Furthermore, nearly all the inventory
shortfall was concentrated in Mont
Belvieu and was therefore a significant
constraint on availability for the ethylene feedstock market.
As a result, feedstock demand for
propane averaged 299,000 b/d during
first-quarter 2008 and was unchanged
from fourth-quarter 2007.

Propane feedstock demand is one of the most important balancing elements of the overall propane market in North America. When colder weather
pushes sales and consumption in the retail markets steadily higher during
November through February, ethylene producers in the Gulf Coast use their
substantial feedstock ﬂexibility to reduce their consumption of propane. This
predictable shift in feedstock demand for propane offsets the impact of colderthan-normal winters, loss of production, or low inventories. Historically, most
of the seasonal decline in ethylene feedstock demand has occurred during the
fourth quarter.

With warmer spring weather, retail
propane demand fell sharply during
second-quarter 2008 and availability
for the feedstock market improved.
Feedstock demand for propane averaged
357,000 b/d during second-quarter
2008. Demand in second-quarter 2008
was almost 60,000 b/d more than in
the first quarter but 10,000 b/d less
than in 2007.
Inventories (net of nonfuel propylene) were consistently less than the
3-year average during second-quarter
2008, but they were also consistently
higher than in 2007. The year-to-year
inventory surplus, however, narrowed
to 700,000 bbl at the end of July from
4.2 million bbl at the end of May. The
steady increase in ethylene feedstock
demand for propane during March
through July was one of the key reasons
for the narrowing inventory surplus.
Specifically, feedstock demand for
propane averaged 408,000 b/d in June
(1.3 million bbl more than in 2007)
and 423,000 b/d in July (2.2 million
bbl more than in 2007).
Feedstock demand for propane was
higher than in 2007 because variable
production costs for propane were
10-15¢/lb less expensive than for
natural gasoline and light naphthas of
similar quality.
Ethylene plants operated at 86% of
nameplate capacity during second-quarter 2008 and 90% of capacity during
July and August. Hurricanes Gustav and
Ike caused extensive downtime for most
ethylene plants on the Upper Texas and

Louisiana Gulf Coast during September; some plants did not return to full
operations until November.
As a result, feedstock demand curtailments in October and November
offset supply losses due to downtime in
gas plants and refineries. This factor was
an important consideration for continued accumulation of propane inventories in Gulf Coast storage.
Ethylene plants will operate at
88-92% of nameplate capacity during
fourth-quarter 2008 and first-quarter
2009. Total feedstock demand will
average 1.60-1.65 million b/d during
fourth-quarter 2008 and 1.65-1.70
million b/d during first-quarter 2008.
Consistent with typical seasonal
patterns, however, propane consumption in the ethylene feedstock market
will remain weak during fourth-quarter
2008 and average 275,000-290,000
b/d or about 15,000 b/d less than in
2007.
In first-quarter 2009, feedstock
demand will average 240,000-260,000
b/d, or 55,000-65,000 b/d less than
year-earlier volumes. The year-to-year
decline in feedstock demand during
fourth-quarter 2008 and first-quarter
2009 will offset the expected inventory
deficit of 2-3 million bbl on Nov. 1. Fig.
1 illustrates historic trends in ethylene
feedstock demand.

Retail demand
Consistent with the seasonal in heating degree-days, retail demand fell to its
seasonal low during second and third

quarters 2008. We estimate that total retail propane sales averaged 420,000 b/d
in second-quarter 2008. In third-quarter 2008, we estimate that retail propane sales averaged 220,000-230,000
b/d vs. 205,000-215,000 b/d in third
quarter 2007.
During a cold winter, retail propane
sales will be 10-20% higher than during recent winters. The record high for
retail propane sales occurred during
winter 2000-01 and totaled an estimated 210 million bbl.
Propane supply-demand forecasts
for winter 2008-09, however, are based
on total retail sales of 170-185 million
bbl. In comparison, retail sales totaled
174 million bbl during winter 2006-07
and 186 million bbl during winter
2007-08.

Propane supply
Gas processors continued to experience strong profit margins in all producing regions during second and third
quarters 2008. Furthermore, propane
prices were consistently 40-60¢/gal
higher than their btu equivalent based
on spot natural gas prices in the Houston Ship Channel market—indicating
Propane’s use as a space-heating fuel in the residential-commercial market reaches its seasonal
peak each year during December
and January but begins to decline
in February and falls to its seasonal
minimum during the summer.

that refineries had no economic incentive to use propane instead of natural
gas in their fuel systems.
Strong profitability for all gas processing plants and economic incentives
for refineries lead to the conclusion
that US propane production was at full
recovery for both gas plants and refineries.
Based on data published by the US
Energy Information Administration,
total production from gas plants and
net propane production from refineries
averaged 835,000 b/d during firstquarter 2008 (19,000 b/d higher than
year-earlier volumes) and 857,000 b/d
during second-quarter 2008 (16,000
b/d higher than year-earlier volumes).

Gas plants
EIA statistics show gas plant propane
production averaged 530,000 b/d for
second-quarter 2008 and was an estimated 525,000-535,000 b/d during
56

July and August. Disruptions to gas processing operations in Louisiana in September and estimated production losses
show that gas plant production declined
to 485,000-495,000 b/d in September
and averaged 510,000-520,000 b/d for
third-quarter 2008.
Gas plant production in Louisiana
will gradually improve during fourth
quarter but remain below full recovery
until February or March 2009. As a result, production in fourth-quarter 2008
will average 510,000-520,000 b/d or
5,000-10,000 b/d lower than year-earlier volumes. Fig. 2 illustrates trends in
propane production from gas plants.

by 10,000 b/d from year-earlier volumes, according to EIA statistics.
As with gas plant production,
net supply from refineries was
320,000-330,000 b/d in July (EIA
actual statistics) and August (estimated)
but dropped sharply in September and
was an estimated 240,000-250,000
b/d. For third-quarter 2008, propane supply from refineries averaged
290,000-310,000 b/d in thirdquarter 2008 and will average
310,000-330,000 b/d in fourth-quarter 2008.

Imports
Based on data from the US Census
Bureau’s Foreign Trade Division, propane imports from Canada declined in
second-quarter 2008, consistent with
normal seasonal patterns, and averaged
78,000 b/d. Imports were 3,000 b/d
higher than in second-quarter 2007 but
were 22,000 b/d lower than the average for 2000-05.
Propane imports from Canada increased to an estimated 95,000-105,000
b/d in third-quarter 2008. The increase
in receipts from Canada during third
quarter was consistent with historic
seasonal patterns.
Contrary to seasonal supply trends,
waterborne imports declined in
second-quarter 2008 and averaged only
32,000 b/d, as reported by the Foreign
Trade Division. Waterborne imports
were 46,000 b/d less than year-earlier
volumes. International propane imports
averaged an estimated 70,000-80,000
b/d during third-quarter 2008 and
were equal to receipts during thirdquarter 2007 but were 45,000 b/d
lower than the average for 2002-06. The
year-to-year decline in waterborne imports during second and third quarters
totaled 4.2 million bbl.

Overall inventory trends
Mar. 31 normally marks the end of
the inventory liquidation season for the

US. Occasionally, propane inventories
continue to decline during April if temperatures are below average.
According to EIA weekly statistics,
propane inventories fell to a seasonal
low at the end of March 2008 and began to increase during the first week of
April. EIA monthly statistics show that
total inventories (including propylene
for nonfuel uses) totaled 25.6 million
bbl on Apr. 1. Inventories were equal to
the 3-year average but were 1.4 million
bbl lower than year-earlier volumes.
During 2003-06, the seasonal accumulation of propane in primary storage
ranged consistently 40-45 million bbl.
The seasonal inventory build, however,
totaled only 31.7 million bbl in 2002
and 34.0 million bbl in 2007.
For 2008, based on EIA’s monthly
statistics through July and weekly
statistics for August and September, the
seasonal inventory build (net of nonfuel
propylene) totaled 32.2 million bbl and
inventories totaled 55-57 million bbl
on Oct. 1, 2008, and reached 57-58
million bbl on Nov. 1, 2008.
Including Canadian inventories in
underground storage, propane markets
will have access to 71-72 million bbl of
supply in primary storage during the
winter heating season. These volumes
were equal to inventories in 2007 but
15 million bbl less than in 2006.
At the end of the 2006-07 winter

heating season, purity propane inventories in underground storage in Canada
fell to a low of 1.9 million bbl on Mar.
1, 2007. At this level, purity propane
inventories were 1.5 million bbl below
the 5-year average and 2.5 million bbl
lower than in 2006.
Based on statistics from Canada’s National Energy Board, Canadian companies added 7.5 million bbl of propane
during Mar. 1 through Sept. 1, 2007.
The seasonal build in Canadian storage
erased nearly all the inventory deficit on
Mar. 1, 2007. Fig. 4 shows trends in US
propane inventories.
During 2002-06, total withdrawals
of propane from primary storage were
39-49 million bbl. For the 2007-08
winter heating season, however, withdrawals totaled only 35.9 million bbl
and inventories fell 23.6 million bbl. If
the 2008-09 winter heating season is
similar to winter of the past 5 years, inventories will be adequate to meet retail
demand but only if ethylene feedstock
demand is weak in fourth-quarter 2008
and declines further during first-quarter
2009. Inventories will fall to a low of
23-24 million bbl on Mar. 31, 2009,
but could easily fall as low as 20-21
million bbl.

(PADD) II fell to a low of 8.65 million
bbl, or 1.4 million bbl below yearearlier levels but equal to the seasonal
minimum of 2007 (Apr. 1, 2007).1
During second-quarter 2008, inventory
in primary storage in PADD II increased
by 8.8 million bbl and totaled 17.8 million bbl on July 1.
At this level, inventories were
1.2 million bbl higher than in 2007
but were 1.4 million bbl below the
2002-06 average. During third-quarter
2008, inventories increased by an
additional 6-7 million bbl and totaled 24-25 million bbl on Oct. 1. The
cumulative inventory build during
second and third quarters 2008 was 1.6
million bbl higher than average.
According to EIA monthly statistics,
propane inventory in primary storage in
PADD III (net of nonfuel propylene) totaled 11.4 million bbl on Apr. 1, 2008,

In most markets, trends in
crude oil prices determine propane’s competitive ethylene feedstock parity value as an alternative
for light naphthas. Propane prices
typically move in tandem with
feedstock parity values vs. light
naphthas.

On Oct. 1, inventories in PADD III
(net of nonfuel propylene) totaled
24.5-25.5 million bbl and were 0.6
million bbl below the year earlier level.
Inventories declined to 23-24 million
bbl on Nov. 1 and were 4.5 million bbl
lower than in 2007.

Pricing, economics
and was equal to year-earlier levels but
was 0.65 million bbl less than the average for 2005-07. During second-quarter 2008, propane inventory in primary
storage in PADD III increased by 7.7
million bbl vs. 6.5 million bbl in 2007.
In 2005, however, PADD III inventories increased by 14.0 million bbl
during second quarter. The volume of
waterborne imports during secondquarter 2008 was similar to receipts
in 2006 but was far less than receipts
during second-quarter 2005.

Why just tell them you’re an expert
when you can show them?

During second-quarter 2008, propane prices in Mont Belvieu increased
to an average of 181.9¢/gal in June
from 159.0¢/gal in April. Despite the
increase in spot prices of 23¢/gal,
propane’s ratio vs. West Texas Intermediate declined to 57.0% in June 2008 vs.
59.3% in April 2008. These comparisons indicate that spot prices in Mont
Belvieu did not keep pace with the
$21.30/bbl increase in monthly average
prices for WTI crude oil during secondquarter 2008.
Although hurricane season began on
June 1 with forecasts for an active season, WTI prices fell sharply beginning
in mid July and averaged $116.58/bbl
in August and $104.47/bbl in September. Propane prices fell more slowly
than WTI prices during third-quarter
2008 and the ratio averaged 61.0% in
September vs. 58.0% in July.
Prices averaged 152.5¢/gal in
September or nearly 30¢/gal less than
in June but were 23¢/gal higher than
year-earlier levels. Propane retailers
were probably much less impressed
with the declining trend in the propane/WTI ratio than they were dismayed by the year-to-year increase in
spot prices.

In view of the ethylene industry’s capability to adjust its
consumption of propane within 1-2
months, propane prices vs. alternative ethylene feedstock values are
better measures of the relative
strength or weakness in spot
prices in Mont Belvieu.

aged 170.2¢/gal, while the range of
propane’s feedstock parity values was
166¢/gal vs. ethane and 198¢/gal vs.
natural gasoline. By these measures,
propane prices were strong relative to
ethane (166¢/gal) but weak relative
to natural gasoline (198¢/gal) during
second-quarter 2008.
During third-quarter 2008, however,
spot prices in Mont Belvieu averaged
167.8¢/gal but feedstock parity values
averaged 167.2¢/gal vs. ethane and
182.1¢/gal vs. natural gasoline. Based
on these comparisons, propane prices
were neutral vs. ethane but remained
weak relative to natural gasoline during
third-quarter 2008.

2008-09 winter prices
The sharp decline in WTI prices during third-quarter 2008 may well signal
the end of the 4-year bullish trend for
crude oil prices. Traders now seem
more concerned about the fallout of
the financial crisis and the continuing
decline in gasoline demand and have
little concern about the threat of supply
disruptions.

The author
Daniel L. Lippe (danlippe@
petral.com) is president
of Petral-Worldwide Inc.,
Houston. He founded Petral
Consulting Co. in 1988 and
cofounded Petral Worldwide
in 1993. He has expertise in
economic analysis of a broad
spectrum of petroleum products
including crude oil and refined
products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, other
ethylene feedstocks, and primary petrochemicals.
Lippe began his professional career in 1974 with
Diamond Shamrock Chemical Co., moved into
professional consulting in 1979, and has served
petroleum, midstream, and petrochemical industry
clients since that time. He holds a BS (1974) in
chemical engineering from Texas A&M University and an MBA (1981) from Houston Baptist
University. He is an active member of the Gas
Processors Association, serving on the NGL Market
Information Committee and currently serving as
vice-chairman of the committee.

Crude oil inventories, however,
remain at the lower end of the historic
range and gasoline inventories fell to
record low levels at the end of September. If the financial crisis has caused
traders to have an overly bearish view
of the true trends in the US economy,
prices may well rebound sharply in first
or second quarter 2009. For fourthquarter 2008 and first-quarter 2009,
however, price forecasts for propane are
based on WTI prices of $95-105/bbl.

Based on price forecasts for competing feedstocks and coproducts,
propane’s feedstock parity values will
be in the range of 135-160¢/gal in
fourth-quarter 2008 and 130-150¢/
gal in first-quarter 2009. Propane prices
will average 145-155¢/gal during the
winter heating season 2008-09.

Altex CEO and Pres.
Jack Crawford, as one
of the principals in the
Alliance Pipeline project, is familiar with the
problems accompanying
Pipelines
large new infrastructure
projects such as the Altex
Pipeline.
Most of the transportation projects
focused on
moving sands
production
south include
conversion or
repurposing
of existing infrastructure to
bridge at least a large portion of the gap
between Alberta and the US Gulf Coast.
TransCanada’s Keystone and Enbridge’s
various proposals—Texas Access, Trailbreaker, and it’s most recent partnership
with BP—all fall into this category.

b/d, but the company says expansion
to 1 million b/d is possible as demand
warrants.
The Alliance Pipeline project was a
newbuild line that brought then-isolated natural gas from northeastern British
Columbia and northwestern Alberta to
the also newbuild Aux Sable gas processing plant near Chicago.
The partnership behind the Alliance
Pipeline was officially formed in May
1996 and the line entered service Dec.
1, 2000. Altex has a similar 4-5 year
development time line planned. Despite
having been announced in October
2005, however, it has yet to begin
formal permitting and other processes
associated with eventual construction.
“The difficulty is, we’re not going
60

to kick off major project work until we
have a firm customer base with signed
contracts,” explains Crawford. “And the
difficulty with that of course is, we’re
asking customers to sign long-term
ship-or-pay types of contracts, which
end up being a drag on their balance
sheets. So they’re not going to do that
until they’re ready.”
The pipeline’s roughly 4-year
development time cycle runs beyond
the 3-year window of typical oil sands
production projects from the time
of sanctioning to the beginning of
production. This time line essentially
requires prospective customers to sign
up for transportation a year before
those customers have sanctioned their
own projects.
Even so, oil sands producers are typically more willing to enter into long-term
shipping agreements than producers
in other areas, according to Crawford,
because they believe their projects will be
producing for 30, 35, or more years and
the customary exploration and development risk isn’t really there.
Huge capital commitments, however,
are present and have proven problematic to a number of oil sands’ production
projects. The scope of activity going on

around Fort McMurray, Alta., has created
a shortage of labor, driven costs up, and
slowed projects, says Crawford.
Crawford recognizes that the current
economy and crisis in the financial
sector has the potential to create at least
a pause in demand growth, if not an actual reduction in demand. He believes,
however, that its ultimate effect will be
limited on both the Altex Pipeline and
sands projects in general
“It won’t surprise me if there’s a 1
or 2% drop in demand” at some time,
says Crawford. He believes potential
problems associated with the two primary heavy crude suppliers to the US
Gulf Coast—Mexico and Venezuela—
will outweigh any small overall demand
dip for projects such as his.

“Mayan production in Mexico has
declined precipitously, and there’s
no readily available means to bring it
back up,” Crawford says. “Venezuela’s
production capacity could probably
do the trick, but you’ve got two other
things going on there, both politically
driven. [Venezuelan President Hugo]
Chavez basically kicked out the foreign
oil companies and confiscated their
property. So even if this were to change,
they’re not likely to go charging back.
And [Venezuela] has announced a
bunch of deals with China, which if I
remember correctly would raise their
current claimed heavy crude exports to
China of 300,000 b/d to 1 million b/d
in 3-4 years. Given the lack of investment to bring production up, it’s basically got to come out of their current
supply.”
Crawford also acknowledges the
slowdown in sands development has
already affected the Altex Pipeline,
moving what was initially a 2010-11
start-up target to 2014.
Shortly after its announcement, Altex
considered the viability of stopping in
other markets between Alberta and the
US Gulf Coast, looking particularly at
Billings, Wyoming, and Denver. These

real savings to the system, according
to Altex, is its patent-pending ThermoLEVR diluent, the relatively small commodity value loss of which allows for
the dramatic TTC savings.
Crawford acknowledges the line will
run at a somewhat elevated temperature, but not to a degree that it would
bring costs out of the conventional
realm.
The Thermo-LEVR itself will be
either removed at the Altex terminus
and replaced by conventional diluent
for shipment to facilities, or left in the
stream and removed by the consumer.

Altex has also received inquiries
from abroad regarding purchasing
batches of Thermo-LEVR for use as a diluent, according to Crawford, which the
company will likely pursue once patents
have been granted.

Chicken, egg
In the meantime, however, development of the Altex Pipeline remains
in slow motion, hampered by the
previously mentioned need to secure
shippers at the same time regulatory approvals are also needed if further headway is to be made. Crawford says work
is currently under way to resolve these
issues contractually with the prospective
shippers.
Altex is in active discussions with
five prospective shippers. Crawford
adds, “there are four or five more players rethinking their whole plans,” and
discussions will begin with at least
some of them shortly. “But the existing
group is certainly capable of making the
line go, even without additional interest,” at the initial planned capacity of
425,000 b/d.
In comparing the Alliance and Altex
projects, Crawford sees the largest difference in the commercial pressures
of the two projects. Alliance required
nearly full participation from the natural gas shippers in the region because

“if you ended up with surplus capacity,
that capacity was going to be marketed
at less than full cost, and anybody
holding that capacity was effectively
holding a devalued asset. We ended up
with something like 37 shippers when
Alliance entered service.”
Alliance reached an understanding
with its shippers that by signing up
for something that might be “slightly
out of the market cost-wise for a small
portion of their production, the rest of
their production would benefit from a
lift in prices in the basin” by virtue of
being able to get the gas to market.
With Altex by contrast, “because we
think we can soundly beat the competition from the price perspective,
we don’t need every producer in the
basin,” says Crawford.
Looking beyond his current project
at the health of the industry in general,
Crawford is fairly bullish on oil prices
and cautiously optimistic regarding the
steel and labor markets.
“I don’t think we’ll see a sustained
drop below $100/bbl crude and I do
think we’ll see a fair bit of volatility.
But I don’t think there’s enough $80
oil in the ground to sustain this market.
The marginal cost will have to be above

that and I think it will remain closer to
$100/bbl.”
The big question regarding steel and
labor costs is what happens with the
economy, says Crawford. “We have seen
some softening in steel prices lately,
as well as increased steel-making and
pipe-making capacity. I think it remains
an open question as to whether this will
moderate prices of the materials and
labor required to build a pipeline.
“It also depends on what else is going on. If you get the Alaska pipeline,
and the Mackenzie Valley pipeline, and
all of the connections occurring to
bring the shale plays to market, you’ll
have a pretty intensive market in which
you probably won’t see much softening. But if these projects slow down and
things back up a little bit, prices could
come off.” ✦

New hydraulic vise column features patented coupling
This new hydraulic vise column
features a patented
swivel coupling that
promises to save
operator time by
eliminating the need
to disconnect and reconnect the two hydraulic hoses as the
column rotates. Each
vise can be independently operated to
unload and load parts
quickly. The compact
rotary coupling does
not interfere with tooling.
The company says that hydraulic power
provides a fast, repeatable action that helps
ensure consistent clamping force, up to
4,700 lb of clamping capacity, without the
variability due to operator fatigue. The hydraulics help ensure consistent, repeatable
clamping force. The operator opens the
64

hydraulic valve to open the jaws to unload
and load parts quickly.
The unit comes with 4 in. and 6 in.
jaw sizes and in three-sided or four-sided
configurations. The stand-alone design can
be retrofitted in the field.
All vises include machinable, reversible jaws; hardened and ground steel rails;

flow and +0.0005 g/cc liquid density
accuracy in continuous process and mass
balance applications. It has no moving
parts and requires no maintenance.
The two-wire Micro Motion 2200S
transmitter can be used with a range of
Micro Motion ELITE Coriolis sensor sizes
and materials of construction to deliver
what the company says is excellent measurement performance for continuous
process applications. Suited for integral
or extended mount, the loop powered
design makes for seamless integration into
existing control systems and is helpful
for long wiring runs and applications in
hazardous areas.
Equipped with MVD digital processing
technology, the 2200S transmitter delivers
multivariable and diagnostic information
via HART communications for reduced
costs through improved process consistency and maximized uptime.

Ofﬁcials prepare
to rescue ethanol
from new crisis
As fuel ethanol approaches a new crisis,
the federal government busily fashions
another rescue.
Ethanol had its heyday in 2006 after the
Energy Policy Act of 2005 imposed rising
annual mandates for the gasoline additive and exposed makers of a competitive
oxygenate, methyl tertiary butyl ether, to
unbearable legal risk.
Ethanol plant construction boomed.

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

While new ethanol supply gushed into the
market, however, corn prices zoomed. By
2007, distillation economics had turned
sour. Congress responded by expanding
the mandate to shore up demand.
That rescue didn’t help. Corn prices
have eased, but so have ethanol prices.
Plant operators are going bankrupt.
Now gasoline consumption and prices,
which the ethanol price tends to follow,
have slumped.
The next crisis relates to the annual
renewable fuel standard by which the
Environmental Protection Agency enforces
the ethanol mandate. It’s the share of sales
by each gasoline supplier that must come
from renewable sources.
EPA calculates the standard from the
statutory mandate level and expected
gasoline consumption, with adjustments
for unaffected states and an exemption for
small reﬁners. For the next year’s gasoline
consumption, EPA uses the Energy Information Administration’s October Short Term
Energy Outlook.
With an ethanol mandate of 10.5 billion
gal and gasoline use forecast at only 9.05
million b/d, the renewable fuel standard
next year looks to be about 9.6%.
That means virtually all gasoline sold in
the US must contain ethanol near the 10%
maximum concentration now applicable to
all but ﬂexible-fuel vehicles.
Distributing ethanol to the whole US
gasoline market will be difﬁcult. Then
there’s 2010, when the grain-ethanol
mandate rises to 12 billion gal and gasoline
demand might come up short again.
Flex-fuel vehicles, which can burn 85%
ethanol blends, might absorb some of the
problem—but only if E85 is cheap enough
to coax motorists who can use it to endure
the mileage penalty.
Meanwhile, ofﬁcials at the agriculture and
energy departments are working on the ethanol industry’s next rescue: studies showing
that 15% or 20% ethanol concentrations in
gasoline might not, after all, be as troublesome for engines as everyone once thought.

OPEC cut yields no immediate effect
The decision by ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
to cut production by 1.5 million b/d effective Nov. 1 from the ofﬁcial quota of 28.8
million b/d had no immediate effect on plummeting crude prices.
After OPEC’s short meeting Oct. 24, front-month crude contracts fell to $62.65/bbl
in intraday trading in New York and $61/bbl in London—the lowest levels in either
market since May 2007. The December contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes
closed at $64.15/bbl, down $3.69 for the day on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In
London, the IPE contract for North Sea Brent was down $3.87 to $62.05/bbl.
Although traders were expecting OPEC to reduce output by 1-2 million b/d, crude
prices were in steep decline for 2 days prior to the meeting. Over the last 3 months,
crude has fallen 57% from record highs above $147/bbl.
It has been “a dramatic collapse unprecedented in speed and magnitude” to levels
that “may put at jeopardy many existing oil projects and lead to the cancellation or delay
of others, possibly resulting in a medium-term supply shortage,” said OPEC ministers.
Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland said, “The current situation of
economic slowdown and credit freeze is quite unique as together with low oil prices
it will translate in an additional supply challenge in a year or two from now as some
supply projects will be pushed further back.”
Recession outweighs OPEC
General expectations of falling demand for energy through 2009 as a result of
a deepening international ﬁnancial crisis are inﬂuencing oil markets far more than
OPEC’s willingness to reduce supplies.
Fear of recession resulted in a steep liquidation of equity holdings in global markets Oct. 24, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 3.6% that day to end
the week 5.3% lower than it started.
Recent strengthening of the US dollar against the euro and pound also has undercut energy prices. Oliver said, “Six months ago OPEC was complaining about the
weak dollar, but it will start soon to regret these times.”
He said, “OPEC is looking to shut down production because prices are too low for
their economics. This makes an environment of spare production capacity where a
return to previous record high prices will not be reached in the immediate future but
where the supply side will get reduced at $50/bbl in a mirror image of the demand
side getting reduced at $150/bbl.” He said, “We remain of the opinion that $50/bbl
would be on a medium term horizon as unsustainable as $150/bbl.”
The lower the price of oil, the more likely are some OPEC members to over-produce their quotas to maximize revenues. In its latest monthly report, OPEC said its
member countries produced 32 million b/d in September.
“OPEC Pres. Chakib Khelil stated the cartel wants to stabilize prices between
$70-90/bbl, but it remains an open question whether this cut will be sufﬁcient to offset demand weakness and, secondly, what the degree of enforcement will be,” said
Raymond James analysts. “Skepticism remains about OPEC’s ability to offset deteriorating demand with oil trading down over $4.50/bbl despite the announcement.”
Saudi projects pending
Analysts at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co. Inc. (FBR) in Arlington, Va., said,
“While it is possible that Saudi Arabia and the other producers can meet this [reduction] target, we would expect some of the cartel members to defect and exceed
prescribed volumes if prices continue their slide, particularly given the size of quota
cuts borne by Venezuela and Iran.”
Despite the proposed cutback, FBR analysts said, “Saudi Aramco will proceed with
plans for 100,000 b/d of new production from Dammam ﬁeld, under the eastern Saudi
city of Dhahran, in 2012.” They said, “OPEC production cuts (and subsequent discipline in
holding to quotas) are unlikely to halt Saudi Arabia’s expansion projects already under
way, including the 1.2 million b/d al-Khoreis project, as state-owned and private producers are likely to need revenue in the coming years, but delays are certainly likely.”
Meanwhile, Jakob noted, “Medium to small E&P companies have started to be
hurt by the credit crunch and are now starting to be hurt by limited cash ﬂows linked
to the lower oil prices.” The reality, he said, “is that below $60/bbl there will be a ﬂattening of the non-OPEC production curve, but that will be seen through the course of
2009 rather than in the remainder of 2008.”
As has happened repeatedly during the oil industry’s boom-and-bust history,
lower prices eventually will reduce supplies and increase demand.

In terms of unconventional resources of fossil fuels, the Rocky Mountain region is a microcosm for the rest
of the US—and a rich one. All types of unconventional oil and gas plays found elsewhere in the US are
clustered in the Rocky Mountains states. The geology is complex, the structures are promising, and the
potential resources huge. And now is the time that new approaches to producing those resources and
delivering them to market will lead the region into a new development era.
The best methods for exploiting unconventional oil and gas plays of the Rocky Mountains and the major
issues involved will come together Apr. 14-16 at the Rocky Mountain Unconventional Resources Conference

March 3 – 5, 2008 / Moody Gardens Hotel & Convention Center, Galveston, Texas

SUBSEA TIEBACK
Forum & Exhibition

PennWell invites you back to the 8th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition.
SSTB has become the premier event for one of the fastest growing field
development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March 3 – 5, 2008 in
Galveston, TX at the Moody Gardens Hotel & Conference Center. Over 2,000
people and 150 exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference.You can’t
afford to miss it.
As our industry confronts new challenges, it has never been more important
to submerse yourself in them. This year’s theme is “Subsea is here, the game
is changing.” As our game changes, the sharing of knowledge and collective
experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety,
and economics of the subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by
industry leaders. As in the past, only by participating in this conference will you
be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will not be published and no
Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room
stays inside the conference room. We hope you will join us.

ConocoPhillips gas pipeline proposal turned down

StatoilHydro sets higher 2012 production targets

Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has notified ConocoPhillips that she rejected the company’s proposal to build an Alaska gas pipeline to
transport North Slope gas to the Lower 48 states, the governor’s
office said.
Meanwhile, a 60-day public comment period is under way
regarding TransCanada’s gas pipeline proposal under the Alaskan
Gasline Inducement Act (AGIA). ConocoPhillips’s application was
outside the AGIA solicitation (OGJ Online, Jan. 7, 2008).
In a Jan. 9 letter to ConocoPhillips’s Chief Executive Officer
James Mulva, Palin wrote, “Your alternative does not give the state
a reason to deviate from the AGIA process.”
A ConocoPhillips spokesman in Houston said the company was
disappointed, and that the company still believes its pipeline proposal offered “tremendous benefits to the state of Alaska.”

StatoilHydro reported that it hopes to ramp up its total equity production to 2.2 million boe/d by 2012 from 1.96 million
boe/d, with the majority of the increase coming from the Norwegian continental shelf.
By 2012, production from the NCS will increase to 1.55 million boe/d from 1.4 million boe/d in 2008. StatoilHydro hopes to
keep NCS production at 1.5 million boe/d for the next 10 years.
In contrast, international production will grow to 0.65 million
boe/d in 2012 from the current 0.5 million boe/d. However, three
quarters of its production-sharing agreements (PSA) are expected
to have a major influence on its overall production, as high oil
prices would reduce its entitlement and boost taxation in kind.
“At an oil price of $75/bbl, PSAs are assumed to have an effect
on entitlement production of about 150,000 boe/d in 2008 and
240,000 boe/d in 2012,” StatoilHydro said.
Statoil, which merged with Hydro in October 2007, expects
annual synergies to be 6 billion kroner before taxes, 2 billion kroner higher than previously estimated. Despite the merger, production in 2007 fell below expectations of 1.7 million b/d because of
technical problems with its fields.
The company has budgeted 75 billion kroner in 2008 as capital
expenditures and about 80 billion kroner in 2009. “Approximately
50% of the increase from 2007 is related to higher activity levels for
sustaining existing production and supporting the group’s growth
ambition, while the remaining is due to cost inflation, combined
with gradually increasing project complexity,” StatoilHydro said.
Helge Lund, the company’s chief executive, said its focus would
be on short-term deliveries and improved operational performance, as it had not met those expectations.
StatoilHydro will drill 70 wells in 2008 under an 18 billion
kroner program, and it has secured rigs for all of its wells. These
will be split 50-50 between the NCS and internationally.
Most drilling on the NCS will be in mature areas, StatoilHydro
said, “but there will also be frontier exploration in the Barents and
Norwegian seas.” Internationally, the most important wells will be
in the US Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, Nigeria, and Azerbaijan. ✦

Turkey, Syria sign mutual energy, pipeline deal
Turkey and Syria have signed an agreement aimed at enhancing
cooperation between their two countries in a number of fields,
including a major pipeline development.
After the signing ceremony, Turkish Energy Minister Hilmi
Guler said the cooperation agreement included a pipeline that
would carry Egyptian natural gas from Aleppo to Turkey’s southeastern town of Kilis, and possibly on to European markets if a
link-up with the European Union-sponsored Nabucco pipeline
scheme comes online.
Cooperation in electric power also would be developed.
Turkey will have the right to take as much as 1.5 billion cu m
of gas for its domestic needs from the 62-mile pipeline, and Turkish contractors will participate in the tenders for line construction.
Bids are due by Feb. 20.
Prior to the meeting, Guler met with Syrian Minister of Oil
Sufiyan al-Aw and said the two countries could jointly explore for
oil and gas because they have identical geologies. “Turkey and Syria
can work together to find oil and natural gas reserves,” Guler said,
adding that both countries can “trade electricity and minerals.”

Equatorial Guinea gets gas-condensate ﬁnd
A group led by Noble Energy Inc., Houston, will continue exploring and appraising Blocks I and O in the Gulf of Guinea east of
Equatorial Guinea’s Bioko Island after the latest discovery expanded

The latest well, I-4, is on Block I in 2,226 ft of water 7 miles

The drilling, seismic calibration, and reservoir analysis confirms
the area’s resource range to be 60% greater than the original predrill estimate, and well results show that liquids make up 40% of
the total resource with proper processing, Noble said.
The Sedco 700 drillship is to spud the next well, to verify the

Peru’s Ucayali gets big gas-condensate ﬁnd
A group led by Repsol-YPF SA started production tests at a gascondensate discovery on Block 57 in Peru’s Ucayali basin.
Early test rates were 35.3 MMcfd and 1,245 b/d from 115 m

SA (Petrobras) said the 22-km-long Kinteroni structure’s indicated a
capacity of as much as 2 tcf of gas. Tests continued at the well is in
Cuzco Province.
Repsol-YPF, with 41% interest, and Petrobras, with 35.15%, were
in the process of acquiring the other 23.85% interest from ConocoPhillips’s Burlington Resources Inc. subsidiary, subject to approval by
Peruvian authorities.
Petrobras noted that the discovery well is near Blocks 58 and 110,
which it is exploring with 100% interest.

Total starts Pazﬂor development work off Angola
Total SA, operator of Block 17, has awarded the principal contracts for the giant Pazflor oil development—the third development
center on the offshore block, following Girassol and Dalia, both on
production (OGJ, July 9, 2007, Newsletter).
Drilling operations are planned to start in 2009; oil production is
slated to begin in 2011.
Pazflor, which lies in 600-1,200 m of water about 150 km offshore and 40 km northeast of Dalia field, involves bringing four
fields into production: Perpetua, Hortensia and Zinia (Upper Miocene), and Acacia (Oligocene). The fields were discovered between
mid-2000 and early 2003.
Pazflor covers 600 sq km with a north-south axis of more than
30 km. The overall development program uses well-tried techniques
on Girassol and Dalia. A floating production, storage, and offloading
unit for Pazflor production will process the oil via 49 subsea wells
(25 producers, 22 water injectors, and 2 gas injectors). The FPSO
will have a processing capacity of 200,000 b/d of oil and a storage
capacity of 1.9 million bbl, bringing the installed production capacity on Block 17 to more than 700,000 b/d.
The Pazflor FPSO will handle two oils of very different characteristics: 17-22° gravity oil from Miocene reservoirs and 35-38° gravity
oil from the Acacia Oligocene reservoir. Pazflor also will incorporate

Talisman Energy Inc. has tested peak rates of 13,450 b/d of light
oil and 6.87 MMcfd of natural gas from its second exploration well,
Hai Su Den (HSD), off Vietnam.
HSD targeted a fractured basement reservoir and was drilled to
a TVD of 11,168 ft, encountering a hydrocarbon-bearing interval
of about 2,400 ft.
The results were constrained by test equipment, Talisman said.
It described the discovery as “very promising” and offering a possible new development, as another discovery was made earlier in
2007 on the same block, 15-2/01. There also is the potential for
upside from additional exploration wells.
Another four exploration wells are planned over the course of
the year by Thang Long Joint Operating Co., a special purpose joint
venture vehicle that will carry out all activities on the block. Activities will focus on evaluating features on trend with the HSD
discovery.
Talisman holds a 60% working interest in any commercial discoveries on Block 15-2/01 with PetroVietnam Exploration & Production Co. holding the remaining 40%.
Block 15-2/01 is 50 miles off eastern Vietnam and is on trend
with large oil and gas discoveries in the Cuu Long basin.

Trinidad and Tobago awards two exploration blocks
Trinidad and Tobago has announced the award of two exploration blocks to a consortium of Voyager Energy, Calgary, and
Petrotrin.
The twin-island nation’s Energy Minister Conrad Enill said the
focus of the two production-sharing contracts is to explore and
develop the Central Range shallow horizon block and the Central
Range deep oil block.
Enill said Voyager had special expertise for exploring these
blocks, which were “one of the more challenging areas on land.”
Enill said the first phase includes the acquisition of seismic data
and the drilling of four wells—three to 1,350 m on the shallow
horizon block, and one to 3,650 m on the deep horizon block ✦

ExxonMobil Corp. unit Esso Exploration Angola (Block 15)
Ltd. has started oil production from the Kizomba C development
on Block 15, about 90 miles off Angola. Kizomba C, which is designed to develop 600 million bbl of oil from the Mondo, Saxi and

Sinclair settles reﬁnery air pollution charges
Sinclair Oil Corp. agreed to pay a $2.45 million fine and spend
more than $72 million to upgrade pollution controls as it settled
federal charges that it violated the Clean Air Act at three of its refineries.
The US Department of Justice and Environmental Protection
Agency jointly announced the settlement on Jan. 15. It involved alleged violations at Sinclair’s refineries in Casper and Sinclair, Wyo.,
and in Tulsa.
Sinclair will be required to install new pollution controls at the
plants that will reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by about 1,100
tons/year and sulfur dioxide discharges by nearly 4,600 tons/year
when fully implemented, DOJ and EPA said in a joint announcement.
The new controls also will reduce emissions of volatile organic
compounds and particulate matter from each of the refineries, the
federal regulators added. They indicated that the three refineries
have a total capacity of 160,000 b/d.
Sinclair also agreed to spend $150,000 on supplemental environmental projects in Oklahoma, including $100,000 to install
new controls to reduce emissions of particulate matter from the
City of Tulsa’s municipal trash trucks, DOJ and EPA said.
They said Wyoming and Oklahoma joined in the consent decree
and will share portions of the civil penalty with EPA. The consent
decree, lodged in US District Court for the District of Wyoming, is

IPF group studying ethanol potential in diesel
Total SA of France and Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA are part
of the international consortium that Paris-based Institut Francais
du Petrole (IFP) launched last spring to study the feasibility and
utilization potential of ethanol for the production of diesel motor
fuels, IFP said.
Called “Ethanol for Diesel,” or E4D, the consortium also includes automobile manufacturers Renault and Sweden’s VolvoPowertrain for the period covering 2007-09. E4D also is open to other
partners.
Based on the expertise of IFP and the consortium partners, the
research will study the impact of this type of motor fuel on the
combustion process and on the optimization of engines in terms
of performance and polluting emissions.
A solid base of experimental data could be established—a first
step toward the direct incorporation of ethanol into the diesel
chain, IPF said. Diversifying the types of motor fuels used in the
diesel pool could, in the short term—and in the current context
of the European market’s strong dieselization trend—contribute to
reestablishing the diesel-gasoline balance that is negatively impacting refinery streams.
It also could help reduce carbon dioxide emissions and the reliance on fossil fuels, IFP said. ✦

Sempra proposes gulf terminal, storage facility
Sempra Energy proposed construction of a marine petroleum
terminal and storage facility in Port Arthur, Tex., to improve tanker
access to refineries in Port Arthur and Beaumont.
San Diego, Calif.-based Sempra initiated an open-season solicitation for potential customers interested in purchasing terminal
capacity.
An initial phase of the proposed terminal would provide storage and transportation for oil, liquefied petroleum gas, and related
products. Vessels carrying oil and products to the Port Arthur region’s refineries currently are limited by long, inner-waterway voyages restricted to daylight hours, Sempra said.
Its proposed terminal would allow 24-hr marine terminal access
with an initial, first-phase throughput of up to 500,000 b/d. The
project’s first phase would require about 120 acres of the 2,900
acres Sempra Energy owns near Port Arthur.
The property also is the proposed site of a larger energy complex that includes the planned development of a LNG project ca10

pable of storing and regasifying up to 3 bcfd of gas.
The LNG terminal construction awaits Sempra’s obtaining sufficient LNG supply and capacity agreements, the company said.

Uzbekistan approves Russian-Uzbek LNG venture
Uzbekistan’s President Islam Karimov has approved the creation
of a $221.5 million joint venture for the production of LNG by
Russia’s Stroytransgaz and Uzbekistan’s Uzbekneftegaz.
A spokesman for Uzbekneftegaz said the president’s approval
clears the way for the planned signing of an agreement between
the two companies by March of this year, aiming to produce LNG
at the Mubarek natural gas processing plant.
The facility will process 12 billion cu m/year of gas and produce 270,000 tonnes of LNG along with 70,000 tonnes of gas
condensate.
Stroytransgaz will contribute $110 million to the project, with
an additional $45.5 million coming from Uzbekneftegaz, $35.5
million from Uzbekistan’s Fund for Reconstruction and Development, and $30 million from an unnamed Chinese bank. ✦

CAFE standards work
Your editorial, “More politics, less
energy,” was ridiculously dismissive of
corporate average fuel economy (CAFE)
standards (Dec. 24, 2007, p. 21). Some
economists say that “lowering fuel
mileage just encourages driving”? The
best data show that increased driving might reduce the benefits of better
fuel economy by about 10% at current
income levels and less in the future. The
weak response to the recent huge run-up
in gasoline prices—driving rates didn’t
suffer all that much--demonstrates that
driving is very insensitive to fuel costs
per mile. And yes, the decision to allow
light trucks to have a much more lenient
standard than passenger cars opened up
a gaping loophole that automakers drove
right through—and there might be further surprises.
Regulations distort the market—does
that mean we should never regulate?
The reality is that the last set of standards, poorly structured as they were,
still worked extremely well and succeeded in greatly reducing the amount of
oil we would otherwise have used. The
automakers’ dire predictions—“we’d all
be driving Pintos,” etc.—failed to come
to pass.
It is certainly true that ill-conceived
regulations can have strong negative
effects, but the 35 mpg target does not
seem unreachable, and an intelligently
designed new standard can be a major
part of a US shift away from its current
unsustainable course.

Two events occurred in January that
could have a major effect on the oil industry—the first $100/bbl sales of crude
and the unveiling of the world’s cheapest car, said John Westwood, managing
director of the UK consultancy DouglasWestwood Ltd., at a Jan. 10 meeting with
industry representatives in Houston.
To some financial analysts, the initial
intraday spike of crude to $100/bbl Jan.
2 on the New York Mercantile Exchange
was just another effort “to manipulate
markets.” Olivier Jakob, managing director of Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland, earlier dismissed that first sale
as “a controversial one-lot transaction
done on the floor away from computer
trading.” Westwood said the 1,000
bbl contract later was resold at a loss
of 60¢/bbl. Meanwhile, he said, “The
world went berserk” as economists,
politicians, and the general public railed
against high oil prices.
Crude hit a second intraday high of
$100.09/bbl Jan. 3 on NYMEX before slipping lower amid concerns of
economic weaknesses. “Technically the
positive momentum is still valid and the
risk remains for a strong advance when
and if [a closing price of] $100/bbl is
broken,” Jakob said at that time. But in
subsequent sessions, crude traded in a
$7/bbl band below the magical $100
mark.

Winning back public trust
The report by a special commission on US
transportation issues offers the oil and gas industry a chance to assert its commitment to consumer
interests. It’s a chance to rebuild trust with the
American public. It’s a chance, therefore, for the
industry to recover some of its lost voice in US
energy politics.
The National Surface Transportation Commission, established by Congress in 2005, proposes to
raise the federal gasoline tax by as much as 40¢/
gal within 5 years to fund highway and bridge
repair. As aggressively as it can, the industry should
oppose this initiative.
Thoughtful people in the industry will see
reasons to take the other position. The aging US
transportation system surely needs work. The work
requires money. Public safety is at stake. As a side
benefit, the elevated fuel cost would help ease demand pressure now straining supply systems and
lifting fuel prices. Reducing consumption would
lower emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse
gases.
Those arguments are appealing as far as they
go. They just shouldn’t come from the oil and gas
industry.

branch channels huge amounts of public money
to preferred constituencies through earmarks and
subsidies. Until recently, its chief executive has
been too reluctant to use his veto to control the
damage. Until fiscal discipline makes an appearance in Washington, DC, new taxation should be
out of the question.
What’s more, the main reason the industry
has lost influence in energy policy-making is that
much of the public blames it for painfully high
prices of gasoline and other oil products. The popular assumption is that the industry controls oil
prices. The assumption is false. If the industry had
that much power over prices it would have bailed
itself out of the troubles it endured in the latter
1980s and most of the 1990s. Markets, which the
oil industry can’t control, set oil prices. Pretending
otherwise to exploit antique suspicions, however,
is an expedient political tactic. So opportunistic
politicians perpetuate falsehood to the detriment
of public trust in a crucial industry.
If it were possible for the industry to raise oil
prices at will, and if doing so was by its nature
evil, why would it not be just as evil for the government to effectively lift prices by hiking taxes?

US energy demand in 2008 will be
nearly unchanged from last year. Weakness in the US economy, in addition to
a global economic slowdown, will hold
growth in check.
Demand for natural gas will grow
modestly in the US, and there will be
a small uptick in the use of renewable
energy this year. But the use of all other
forms of energy will decline or hold

2007.

this year,
but conservation will

power weakens as the economy slows.
Demand for most oil products in the US
will decline.
Last year’s high oil prices were attributed to a host of factors, including
the weak US dollar, limited spare production capacity, geopolitical tensions,
and rising demand in China, India, and
other developing economies.

Global oil demand
OGJ forecasts that a weakening global economy will hold worldwide oil
demand growth to 1.8% this year, with
consumption averaging 87.2 million
b/d. Most demand growth will occur
outside the Organization for Economic

Cooperation & Development.
North American oil demand will be
unchanged from the International Energy Agency’s 2007 demand estimate of
25.5 million b/d. Meanwhile, demand
growth in the European member countries of the OECD will inch up 0.8% to
15.4 million b/d for the year.
Weakening after averaging 9.2 million b/d in the first quarter of 2008,
average OECD Asia-Pacific demand will
climb to 8.5 million b/d from 8.3 million b/d last year.
Outside the OECD, demand will
increase 3.5% this year, averaging 37.8
million b/d. China and the former Soviet Union will lead this year’s growth,
each with annual gains of about 5%.
But demand growth in China will wane
following this year’s Olympic Games.
Most other regions also will post demand gains from 2007, but non-OECD
Europe demand will be unchanged at
800,000 b/d.

Worldwide oil supply
Crude supply this year will climb
nearly 3%, allowing stocks to build.
Gains in natural gas liquids production will combine with a small increase
in crude output from members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, as well as rising production
in the former Soviet Union, China, and
Brazil this year. Supply and demand

crunch hurt the economy.
Workers’ earnings gained slightly at
the end of last year, but inflation for the
first 11 months of the year was 4.2%,
according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This compares with inflation of
2.5% for all of 2006.
The consumer price index for energy, which increased 2.9% in 2006,
advanced at an 18.1% seasonally adjusted annual rate in the first 11 months
of 2007. Petroleum-based energy costs
increased at a 30.8% annual rate, and
charges for energy services rose at a
3.2% annual rate, BLS reported.
The economic slowdown and
conservation will keep energy demand
growth negligible—to 101.005 quadrillion btu (quads) from 100.91 quads
last year.

Energy by source
Consumption of oil and coal will decline slightly this year in the US while
the use of natural gas and renewable
energy grows slightly.
Natural gas demand will climb to
23.19 quads, bringing the gas energy
market share to 23%, higher than coal’s
22.5%.
Coal demand this year will decline
by 0.5% following a 2% power generation-led gain during 2007. The use of
nuclear energy will be unchanged at
8.3 quads. Last year’s increase in energy
demand drove the use of nuclear energy
in the US up 1% to its highest annual
level.
Demand for alternative energy
sources, including hydroelectric power
generation, solar, and wind energy, will
climb only 0.6% this year, following a
2% decline last year. These renewable
energy sources account for just below
7% of the US energy market.
Oil demand this year will be down
0.4% from 2007, totaling 39.84 quads.
Last year’s use of oil products was up
negligibly to 40 quads. Strong prices
have encouraged efficiency in the use
of jet fuel and motor gasoline. And the
use of oil products as petrochemical
feedstocks has been on a downward
trend in the US.

Combined, oil and natural gas will
comprise 62.4% of the US energy market this year, up slightly from a year ago.

Oil supply
The 2007 and 2008 start-ups of
some major upstream projects will help
boost US crude and condensate production to an average 5.135 million b/d
this year.
This year’s expected start-ups include
Thunder Hawk, Thunder Horse, and Tahiti in the Gulf of Mexico (OGJ, July 23,
2007, p. 43). These big oil-producing
fields join Atlantis and Neptune, which
are already on stream. Combined, the
five fields’ peak production will exceed
1 million b/d.
Oil production increased slightly last
year to 5.114 million b/d, according to
OGJ estimates, from 5.102 million b/d
in 2006.
During 2007, a large gain in production in Louisiana mostly offset declines
in a handful of other states. Oklahoma,
Texas, Colorado, and California incurred
dips in production last year, while
Louisiana production averaged 1.34
million b/d, up more than 5% from a
year earlier.
Alaskan oil production declined
last year to average 720,000 b/d,
down from 741,000 b/d in 2006
and 864,000 b/d in 2005. Crude and
condensate production in Alaska hasn’t
increased since 2002, when average
output climbed to 988,000 b/d from
963,000 b/d in 2001.
OGJ forecasts that average NGL
production this year will rise to 1.76
million b/d from 1.75 million b/d
last year and 1.739 million b/d a year
earlier.

Inventories
Stocks of crude and products finished 2007 lower than a year earlier.
Crude inventories closed out the year
down more than 8% to a level able
to meet refinery needs for 19 days. At
yearend 2006, crude supplies stood at
more than 20 days of refinery inputs.
Total motor gasoline inventories
were down slightly at the end of 2007,

(more than 500 ppm) distillate, ended
last year down 36%, while ultralow-sulfur distillate stocks climbed 17% from a
year earlier.
The amount of crude oil in the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve climbed
slowly throughout the year and stood
at 696 million bbl at the end of 2007.
OGJ expects the SPR to end 2008 at 700
million bbl.

Reﬁning
Refining activity will decline slightly
again this year, after the average utilization rate for 2007 decreased to 89.4%
from 89.7% a year earlier.
Capacity utilization hovered just
below 90% throughout much of 2007
because of maintenance and tempo28

rary shutdowns. Last year was a busy
year for maintenance and turnarounds
because refiners had delayed such work
for about 2 years to take advantage of
high margins.
US refiners’ acquisition costs for
crude rose sharply last year, especially
costs for imported crude. Refiners paid
about 12% more for domestic crude
during 2007, as the average cost was an
estimated $69.80/bbl. But for imported
crude, the average cost was up almost
15% from a year earlier, averaging
about $67.50/bbl last year.
Refining margins were mixed last
year compared to those of 2006. In
the US, cash margins for refiners in
the Midwest, nearest to most ethanol
plants, were especially strong, up 27%

to average $19.30/bbl for all of last
year, according to Muse, Stancil & Co.
The May 2007 average was the year’s
peak at $34.25/bbl, more that twice the
average of May 2006.
Cash margins grew at more modest paces during 2007 for East Coast
refiners, up 11%, and for Gulf Coast
refiners, up 4% from the prior year. US
West Coast refiners posted a 10% lower
average margin last year.

Oil imports
The US will import reduced volumes of crude and products this year.
OGJ forecasts that after last year’s 1.5%
decline in total gross imports, crude
imports will decline 0.5% to 9.95 million b/d this year. Product imports will

Strong demand for oil products
drove imports higher on the US West
Coast last year, as EIA figures for im30

ports into Petroleum Administration for
Defense District 5 show.
While total US demand for oil products last year declined 0.6%, demand

in PADD 5 for all petroleum products
climbed 1.5%. Distillate and residual
fuel oil were especially strong in comparison to demand in the other four

Canada was the US source not only
of the most imported crude during
2007 but also of the highest volume of
product imports for the year.

encourage conservation. Motorists will
use less gasoline, and airlines have been
flying fewer but fuller flights.
Demand for all products except distillate will fall from last year’s levels.

Oil demand

Distillate

Demand for oil products for the
entire US this year will decline to an average 20.61 million b/d in 2008 from
20.7 million b/d a year ago. In 2006,
US demand for petroleum products
averaged 20.688 million b/d.
Weak economic conditions coupled
with relatively strong fuel prices will

The increase in distillate consumption will reflect strength of the diesel
market. Consumption of home heating
oil, the other main distillate product,
will be suppressed by above-normal
temperatures predicted by the National
Weather Service for most of the US.
Diesel’s strength will raise average

demand for all distillate to 4.3 million b/d this year from 4.25 million
b/d last year and 4.169 million b/d in
2006.
Much of diesel’s consumption
growth reflects increasing production
of ethanol for blending with gasoline.
Ethanol and its main feedstock, corn,
move to processing and blending facilities by rail or truck.
Production of fuel ethanol climbed
to an average 452,000 b/d in October 2007, the latest month for which
such data is available from EIA. This
brought the 2007 year-to-date average

than two thirds of current distillate demand is ultralow-sulfur diesel required
for on-highway use.

Motor gasoline
Following 15 years of growth, demand for motor gasoline will decline
this year. Higher prices are changing
driving habits.
Average gasoline demand will be
9.27 million b/d, compared with 9.3
million b/d last year and 9.25 million
b/d in 2006.
Regular unleaded pump prices in

2007 increased 7% from a year earlier,
according to BLS figures. In 2006, the
pump price for regular unleaded fuel
rose 13% from a year earlier.
Following springtime maintenance,
inventories of gasoline will be pinched.
Gasoline prices will rise at the start of
this year’s driving season as summer
blends return to the market.

Jet fuel
Demand for jet fuel this year will be
nearly unchanged at 1.62 million b/d.
Airlines have improved efficiencies over

the past few years such that in 2007 jet
fuel consumption dipped 0.7% from
1.633 million b/d a year earlier.
Retail prices for jet fuel were slightly
lower or unchanged for the first 8
months of last year, but in September
and October jet fuel prices climbed
13% and 30% respectively from yearearlier levels. Inventories were adequate;
the price hike was due to rising crude
costs.

Residual fuel oil
Resid demand will fall almost 3%

High natural gas prices during
2007 gave resid consumption a boost.
Although switching capacity between
gas and resid for electric generation is
on the decline, there is still enough to
make an impact.
Resid prices over the past 2 years
were strong, too. Through the first 9
months of 2007, the average end-user
price of resid was $1.28/gal, up from
$1.26/gal a year earlier and an average of 99¢/gal in the first 9 months of

Demand for liquefied petroleum

Exports of propane and propylene last

Oklahoma and Louisiana state lines, was
responsible for 35% of the average Texas
rig count in 2007. The area includes the
eastern part of the Barnett shale play
and other mainly gas plays in numerous
Cretaceous and Jurassic formations.
The top two Arkansas Fayetteville
shale players, Southwestern Energy Co.
and Chesapeake Energy Corp., said they
were operating 19 and 11 rigs, respectively, at the end of 2007. Southwestern
alone planned to participate in 475
wells in the play in 2008.
Petrohawk Energy Corp., Houston,
will shortly hike its Fayetteville play
position to 150,000 net acres with the
purchase of leasehold mainly in Van
Buren, Conway, and Cleburne counties
from a private seller.
Newfield Exploration Co. had 13 rigs
running in the Arkoma basin Woodford
shale gas play in December 2007, 11 of
which were drilling development wells.
Pioneer Natural Gas USA Inc. announced plans to drill 350 oil wells in
the Spraberry Trend of West Texas and
175 coalbed methane wells in the Raton
basin in southeastern Colorado in 2008.

Canada’s outlook
OGJ’s estimate for Canada is more
generous than that of associations north
of the border.
The Canadian Association of Oilwell
Drilling Contractors and the Petroleum
Services Association of Canada in late
October forecast a hefty 17% drilling
decline to 14,500 wells in 2008. The
groups’ expectations were already low
before Alberta imposed a more onerous
royalty regime.
Nearly 500 rigs were inactive in
Canada in 2007, calculated Nickles
Energy Group, greater than the number
of available rigs 11 years earlier.
Nickles figures also show that 11.6%
of the approved well permits in western
Canada in 2007 were for oilsands evaluation wells.
Canadian operators are also limiting
risk by drilling fewer exploratory wells.
OGJ estimates that only 3,600 such
wells will be drilled in 2008, down
from an estimated 4,259 last year. ✦

Iraq takes licensing step, but E&P ﬁscal policy murky
Ferruh Demirmen
Consultant
Houston
The invitation extended early this
month by Iraq’s Ministry of Oil to
international oil companies (IOCs) to
preregister by Jan. 31 for exploration
and production licensing rounds has
no doubt attracted much interest in the
industry (OGJ Online, Jan. 3, 2008).
In its announcement, the ministry
requested the applicant companies to
provide a comprehensive list of information, from company bylaws to tax
compliance record to HSE policy. The
ministry will use the information to
select those companies that will be allowed to compete for upstream projects
in the country. The scope of information
requested for qualification may set a
new standard in the industry.
But IOCs are still mainly in the dark
as to Iraq’s fiscal policy. Timing of the
first licensing round is also unclear.

sector has kept the federal government
from enacting a petroleum law for
upstream projects. The federal government, dominated by Arab leaders, wants
centralized control of the oil sector. In
contrast, KRG wants decentralized control. There are also differences as regards
the contracting terms.
KRG has passed its own (regional)
petroleum law and has signed a number

putting the central government in an
awkward position.
Because of the dispute, a draft federal
petroleum law approved by Iraq’s cabinet in February 2007 went nowhere.
Last November Iraqi Oil Minister
Hussain Al-Shahristani criticized foreign
oil companies making deals with KRG
(OGJ, Dec. 3, 2007, Newsletter). According to a Jan. 10 United Press International report, the leader of the Iraqi
Parliament’s Energy Committee, Abdul

The oil ministry apparently decided
to issue a prequalification invitation
ahead of a final petroleum law because
it felt the urgency to act in the face of
developments in northern Iraq. Exploratory drilling in the KRG territory has
uncovered some prolific finds, presaging early production. Export outlet
remains a problem, however. KRG

Kirkuk pipeline heading north. Although some crude from new discoveries has found its way to Iran by tanker
transport, major development and significant export must await rapprochement with the national government.

Contracting policy
Although details of Iraq’s petroleum
law are uncertain, the general thinking of the national government on this
subject can be gleaned from a presentation delivered in Dubai last September
by N.K al-Bayati, director general of
petroleum contracts and licensing, Ministry of Oil.
According to el-Bayati, the government’s preference is service contracts
(see figure). It is noted that IOCs would
favor production sharing contracts
(PSCs) but that the government, given
the political and economic culture, considers PSCs unsuitable for Iraq.
Evidently, the government feels that
the profit oil split embodied in the PSC
model would compromise state ownership of oil and gas (notwithstanding
that the net “take” values—government
vs. IOC shares—under the service
contract and PSC could be similar). The
service contract model was used in a
limited fashion in Iraq after nationalization in 1972.
A 15-20 year service contract
with the option for additional lifting
is foreseen, with cost recovery and
remuneration in cash (“basically”) or
in-kind. Remuneration would likely

be a percentage of the investment. The
contractor would bear the risk and
carry the government through exploration, if applicable.
Iraq National Oil Co. (INOC) would
have the right to form joint ventures
(up to 50% interest) with contractors in
development and production projects.
Whether INOC would fully share the
related costs, or would be partially carried by the contractor, is not clear.
No mention is made of any bid fee,
of possible consequences of cost overrun, of delay or underperformance in
production, cost recovery limit, payout,
allowed rate of return, etc. The duration
of the contract is generous compared to
the Iranian buyback scheme.
The service contract approach stands
in contrast with the PSC approach adopted by KRG.
All licensing rounds, whether at the
federal or regional level, would be referred to a Federal Oil and Gas Council
(FOGC) that would have the authority
to review and approve contracts. FOGC
would also set priorities on exploration

blocks and fields to be tendered. Regional authorities would make proposals to the federal government and hold
licensing rounds in their territories using model contracts drawn up by FOGC.
(Currently the KRG territory is the only
“region” in the federal structure).
INOC would play a key role in
dealings with the IOCs and carry out
upstream activities on its own.
Somewhat unusually, two separate
committees, one for exploration blocks
and the other for fields, would handle
bid evaluation and negotiation.

Long-awaited round
Preceded by a preregistration invitation, a long-awaited E&P licensing
round by Iraq’s oil ministry thus may
be in the offing. But in the absence of
a federal petroleum law, contractual
terms remain sketchy. IOCs will gauge
their interest in Iraqi licensing according to the fiscal terms offered. A federal
petroleum law, embodying the service
contract as the dominant if not the sole
model, will likely be enacted within the

next few months.
Indications are that the initial licensing round will include few exploration
blocks and fields to test the efficiency
of the new system and assess investor
response.
How the legal status of KRG’s contracts will be handled in the federal
law remains to be seen. It is expected
that the federal law will acquiesce to
these contracts but ban similar contracts
in the future. IOCs deemed “errant”
may be excluded from future licensing
rounds.
Overriding all these developments
is the certainty that no real progress in
Iraq’s licensing rounds can be expected
until the security situation improves. ✦

“Another hard place is Arctic waters
where the prospects of massive reserves
(estimates range from 160-300 billion bbl of oil equivalent) have resulted
in a ‘great subsea land claim’ being
played out by Russia, Canada, and the
US, against a spring 2009 deadline
imposed by the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea,” he said.
There are 45 countries that are trying
to prove up potential claims to portions
of the Arctic. “Russia may have control
over 60% of the Arctic reserves, but it
hasn’t the technology to develop them,”
Westwood said. That means Russia will

have to bring in Western partners with
the equipment and expertise to develop
Arctic reserves, as well as the huge investments to finance such programs.
“Recent $100 oil has only served to
add to the already massive demand for
the products and services of firms that
supply the offshore oil and gas companies. Suppliers are virtually beating off
the customers, but demand continues
to grow,” said Westwood. As a result,
he said, “The offshore oil field services
sector is facing unprecedented levels of
business; some companies that might
normally have a 6-month backlog are

now booking work for 2011.”
Douglas-Westwood expects capital
expenditures of $25 billion to be invested annually in deepwater projects in
2008-12, a 30% growth over spending
in the previous 5 years. “This will drive
demand for deepwater drilling rigs,
floating production systems, subsea
production hardware, and more,” said
Westwood.
Recruiting and retaining qualified
personnel remains a major challenge
for all of the oil and gas industry. “The
real crunch is the lack of experienced
people—that’s the single biggest problem year after year,” Westwood said. ✦

New UK energy bill calls for simpler regime
Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
The UK’s new energy bill calls for a
simpler regime for offshore gas supply infrastructure so energy companies
can invest with greater clarity and with
reduced costs and risks, the government
said on Jan. 10.
Admitting the present regime was
complex and a “barrier to investment,”
the UK said it was determined to bolster gas supply security as it prepares to
import more than half of its needs by
2020.
The bill will propel smaller players in
the North Sea into offshore oil and gas
decommissioning by ensuring adequate
environmental and taxpayer protections,
the government said.
Energy companies also will be
encouraged to invest in carbon capture
and storage to help address climate
change, and the government will create
a licensing regime for storing carbon
dioxide offshore. Decommissioning
costs are estimated at £15-19 billion,
with 500 oil and gas installations in
the UK North Sea and more than 6,000
miles of pipeline.
Oil and Gas UK, the trade association, cautiously welcomed the proposals, saying it initially appeared to
40

“simplify and strengthen the regulatory
framework to give investors more clarity and certainty in the areas of offshore gas infrastructure, licensing, and
decommissioning.”
The UK also has proposed a fleet of
new nuclear power stations to enhance
the country’s energy security and reduce carbon emissions, with new plants
possibly in operation by 2020.
The controversial measure, condemned by environmentalists, would
be paid for entirely by energy companies. Each station, to be developed on
existing or shut-down nuclear sites, is
estimated to cost £1.5 billion. Companies will pay the full costs of decommissioning and their full share of waste
management costs.
Welcoming nuclear power into the
energy mix is a complete change of
attitude, as the governing Labor party
initially described going nuclear as “an
unattractive option” in 2003. High oil
prices, however, have made nuclear
power a much more attractive option.
But as other countries continue to
build nuclear fleets—with more than
30 reactors under construction, and
over 90 ordered or at advanced stages of
planning—the UK will need to compete to draw investment for resources,
components, and capital.

Tony Ward, utilities director at Ernst
& Young said, “The implementation of
projects that will result in operational
reactors before 2020 will depend on
whether or not government policy
and commercial environments remain
robust. Speed, clarity, and continued
confidence will be the key to success for
any UK projects,” he continued. “The
global market is vibrant and hence there
is great competition—the UK will need
to work hard to remain an attractive
option.” ✦

Argentina cuts
local energy supply,
bans exports
Eric Watkins
Senior Correspondent
Argentina’s President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has blamed global
warming for current energy cuts and
export controls her government is imposing following a recent heat wave.
“These major changes in temperature haven’t come out of nowhere, they
have a direct link to the environment”
said Fernandez, whose husband, former
President Nestor Kirchner, has been
blamed by critics for his failure to address the problem of supply.
During his time in office, Kirchner repeatedly criticized oil and gas
companies such as Repsol-YFP SA and
Petroleo Brasileiro SA for not investing
enough, while the companies called for
the government to raise domestic prices
in order to create a better climate for
investment.
President Fernandez said there were
more that 50,000 simultaneous power
cuts on Jan. 8 after demand peaked. She
said electricity supply had been disrupted to almost 6% of the grid as a result
of the high temperatures, with some
1.2 million people affected—some
300,000 in Buenos Aires alone.
To reverse the situation, GE Energy
in December said it would supply 20
natural gas-fueled Jenbacher generator sets for a new 30 Mw power plant
being built to support the regional grid
as well as oil and gas field production
requirements in southwestern Argentina
as the country seeks to overcome its
energy shortages.

Argentina, ordered 20 of GE’s JGS 420

Cuba hopes that exploration by
foreign companies in deep waters of
the gulf will result in discoveries that
will enable the country to become
self-sufficient in oil production.
The Cubans are not alone in thinking there’s oil and gas in their deepwater offshore. According to the US
Geological Survey, Cuba’s area could
contain 4.6-9.3 billion bbl of crude
and 9.8-21.8 tcf of gas.

The El Huemul plant uses field gas
with a high carbon dioxide content,
which is consumed by the power plant
without treatment. The equipment is
scheduled to be delivered to the site by
February, with installation and commissioning set for later in the first quarter.
Last week’s power cuts coincided
with an Argentinean government decision, in the wake of rising domestic
prices, to suspend all exports of liquid
fuels, including oil, gasoline, diesel,
fuel oil, and naphtha.
Trade Secretary Guillermo Moreno
also ordered that state-regulated prices
return to levels in place on Oct. 31,
2007, a decision based on the socalled Supply Law passed in 1974
that requires suppliers of energy and
other products to first meet domestic

demand before exporting.
The Argentinean government will
lift the ban once oil companies bring
down gas oil and petrol prices to the
Oct. 31 levels. Until then, the situation
in the country will be monitored by the
Argentine Trade Secretariat.
Raul Castellano, vice-president of
Argentine hydrocarbons confederation
CECHA, said it was an extreme move
to cut all exports, but it should help to
normalize prices on the domestic market, and that is absolutely necessary.
“The biggest problem in Argentina is
not price but supply,” Castellano noted.
While Argentineans may welcome
the move, neighboring countries already are expressing concerns over their
own potential supply problems resulting from Argentina’s ban.

More than 50% of the fuels consumed in Paraguay are imported from
Argentina, and the Argentinian ban
might create serious problems for Paraguay, according to Blas Zapag, the head
of Paraguayan company Copetrol.
Didier Olmedo, director general of
economic policy of Paraguay’s Ministry
of Foreign Affairs, said Jan. 8 his country is concerned about the export ban
decision to avoid shortages.
Olmedo assembled an emergency
meeting with representatives of the
Paraguayan Industry and Commerce
Ministry and local fuels producers and
distributors to discuss how to avoid a
fuels shortage in the Paraguayan market.
Paraguay will officially report its
concerns to the Argentine authorities
via diplomatic channels, he said. ✦

t may be stating the obvious, but
the essential Washington, DC,
energy question now is the extent to
which growing concern about the
general US economy will divert political attention from global climate
change.
Conventional wisdom holds that
the economy always trumps the environment, especially when consumers—many of whom vote—start to
complain about high prices. Global
warming is part of the national
vocabulary, but concern about it still
doesn’t resonate as much at the polls
as middle class economic hardship.
It also is going to remain a key
energy issue. The oil and gas association executives interviewed for the
US Energy Politics special report were
unanimous on that point (OGJ, Jan.
14, 2008, p. 20).
The executives also agreed that

regulatory difficulties surrounding
alternatives such as nuclear power.
“Our members who produce it believe natural gas will need to be part
of the solution,” he said.
“Somebody would have to pay
for fuel mandates. Some members of
Congress keep coming back to the oil
and gas industry,” warned National
Petrochemical & Refiners Association
Pres. Charles T. Drevna. “If they put
domestic producers and refiners at a
disadvantage to global competitors, it
will hurt the US economy,” he said.

Possible inﬂuences

Much will depend on what US
President George W. Bush says in his
2008 State of the Union address on
Jan. 28 about measures to stimulate the
economy. He previously has rejected
new taxes as impediments to growth,
especially when they’ve been directed
at a specific industry. But he changed
the political atmosphere dramatically
2 years ago when he announced that
America was addicted to oil.

In early January, Balwin Spencer, the
prime minister of Antigua & Barbuda,
said that member states of the Petrocaribe association in the Eastern Caribbean
would use an existing facility in his
country to store and distribute fuel, instead of using installations in Venezuela.
Spencer said Antigua & Barbuda
would acquire all of the outstanding
shares in West Indies Oil Co. (WIOC)
that it needs to be able to control an effective and efficient deposit and distribution center in the region. Reports say
the installations belonging to WIOC can
accommodate some 322,000 bbl of oil.

Gas & Power are jointly developing
the project in New York state waters
about 9 miles from Long Island’s
nearest shoreline and about 10 miles
from Connecticut’s closest shore. The
terminal would be a floating storage
and regasification unit (FRSU) that
would be attached to a yoke mooring
system (YMS), which includes a mooring tower embedded in the sea floor,
according to FERC.

It said that the double-hulled FRSU
would include a single berthing and
unloading facility for LNG tankers with
cargo capacities of 125,000-250,000
cu m, capacity to store as much as
350,000 cu m of LNG (equivalent
to about 8 bcf of gas), a closed-loop
natural gas-fired vaporization system,
and utility systems, crew quarters, and
service facilities.
The EIS said the terminal would
receive LNG deliveries from tankers
2-3 times weekly, regasify it, and send
out an average 1 bcfd of the fuel to a
subsea gas pipeline that would extend
21.7 miles to an existing Iroquois Gas
Transmission System pipeline in Long
Island Sound.
FERC, which reviews applications to
construct onshore US LNG terminals,
is the federal agency responsible for
final approval of this offshore project
because it is in state waters. But the
US Coast Guard is responsible for the
FRSU’s safety and security as a marine
facility and for the LNG tankers while
berthed and during transit in US territorial waters. The two agencies have
shared reviews of the proposed project’s engineering, reliability, and safety
aspects since late 2004 when FERC
initiated the prefiling process.

USCG’s role
FERC said USCG already has issued
a Waterways Suitability Report, which
is an appendix in the final EIS. The US
Department of Homeland Security
service also will review and adopt
pertinent portions of the EIS to satisfy
its responsibilities under the National
Environmental Policy Act and issue a
final letter of recommendation with
its final determination of whether
the project’s waterway is suitable for
tanker traffic.
The final EIS indicated that the proposed Broadwater LNG terminal would
have minimal onshore environmental
impacts because it would be located in
the sound. Primary impacts during construction would be physical disturbance
of the sea floor and related turbidity in
the water column. During operation,
impacts of primary concern would consist of minor impacts on water quality,
air quality, fisheries, recreational boating and fishing, and commercial vessel
traffics. There also would be minor to
moderate visual impacts.
“During our environmental review
of the proposed project, we identified
procedures that would avoid, minimize
and mitigate environmental impacts

that would result from construction and
operation of the project as proposed by
Broadwater. We recommend that these
mitigation measures be attached as
conditions to any authorization issued
by the commission,” FERC said in a
statement.
They noted that the final EIS also
evaluates alternatives to the proposals, including other energy sources,
systems, sites, designs, and pipelines.
The final EIS indicated that the
proposed project would begin with
prelay pipeline installation surveys in
September 2009. In-water pipelines
would be installed from October
2009 to April 2010. The YMS would
be installed in October and November
2010. The pipeline from the YMS to
the IGTS pipeline would be built in
November and connected in December.
The sponsors anticipate that design
and fabrication of the FSRU and YMS
would require about three years and
proposes having the terminal operating in late December 2010, the final
EIS said.
FERC said that commissioners will
consider the staff’s recommendation
and final EIS before issuing a final
decision on the project. ✦

A program was instrumental in assessing the
causes of casing failures
and remediating them
in wells in the Dongguo
area of northeast China.
Production
The Dongguo area is part
of Daqing oil field in
Heilongjiang province.
Development of Dongguo has taken
place during the last 13 years. With the
drawn out exploitation program, the
wells experienced problems, especially
casing failures during the last 2 years.
These failures affected oil field development by complicating the proportion
of fluids injected and produced, reducing oil recovery, restricting injection
and production rates, and accelerating
the production decline rate.

O D U C T I O N

The injected water has 6.78 mg/l.
of suspended solids, 4.68 mg/l. of oil
content, 0.6 mg/l. of metratrophic
bacteria, 60 mg/l. of sulfate reducing
bacteria and 600 mg/l. of iron oxidizing bacteria.
The analysis indicated that the
injected water caused little damage to
the casing and attributed only about
2.5% of the damaged casings to injected
water.

Dongguo casing failures
derive from many causes

Casing failures

So far, the field operator has found 22 wells
with damaged casing.

Coalbed methane
Conventional concepts can quantify
reservoir mechanics after gas is released
from the coal matrix, but coalbed
methane (CBM) projects require earlier
and more thorough evaluations than
conventional projects. Therefore, CBM
technologies, when viewed from a development life-cycle perspective, must
depart from a conventional oil and gas
approach in order to stack the odds for
a commercial success.
Historically, CBM projects include a
few top-tier wells and many average-tomarginal wells. Because CBM prospectors rarely understand the up-front
controlling factors that make a good or
bad well, an investment in a regional
view and multiwell approach early in
the program is necessary so that the
economically viable wells or acreage can
be identified during start-up.
In a technology-play CBM project,
innovative applications of enabling
technologies allow prospectors and
operators to reduce cycle time before
the first commercial gas sales. They can
also screen and high-grade potential
projects, add value to preproduction
knowledge gathering, and validate economic forecasts that often must project
much further into the future than those
of conventional oil and gas reservoirs.

Life-cycle concept
CBM projects have five distinct lifecycle phases:
1. Regional resource reconnaissance.
2. Local asset evaluation.

“Regulations and economics will require more efﬁciencies to be forthcoming.”
—Glenda Wylie, technical marketing director of unconventional resources,
Halliburton Corp.

Free gas and sorbed gas exist in the coal matrix. The model image shows a depiction of a typical subbituminous coal at the molecular level (Fig. 1).
3. Early development.
4. Mature development.
5. Declining production.
A large-scale project may contain
multiple localized projects, resulting in
the simultaneous occurrence of all lifecycle phases.
Fig. 2 presents a scenario in which
an operator has leased several hundred
thousand continuous acres of coal
rights. The operator has been developing the asset for more than 15 years.
Several areas in the lease are mature or
experiencing declining production, but
other areas have not yet been evaluated
for production potential.
In Phase 1, an operator determines
whether a property has adequate pro-

duction potential to justify an acquisition and exploration.
In Phase 2, evaluations determine
whether a specific area should be exploited and the most economic development methodology for exploiting it.
In frontier exploration plays or
basins, cycle time and costs must be
optimized. The economic issues of
remote operations further drive development of innovative strategies to
help reduce evaluation time and allow
go/no-go Phase 3 decisions. Inherent
highly variable coal-seam characteristics
over short distances cause difficulties
in extrapolating core hole and single
test-well results. Consequently, basinwide evaluations or localized testing

should be performed before a multiwell
production pilot or development phase
activity.
In Phase 3, initiation of development
drilling in potential areas and attaining
targeted project production is critical
for capital investment.
Phase 4 involves maintaining project production and economic targets
through development of marginal areas,
infill drilling, and remediation.
Phase 5 can result in secondary recovery efforts as a means of extending
economic viability. Declining production requires plugging of unproductive wells, removing equipment, and
restoring the site while maintaining a
positive cash flow.
Fig. 3 illustrates a conceptual flow
path for an example project. A phased
approach may include separation of the
single-cased well pilot holes as a Phase
1 effort. This phased approach can be
further evolved into a “minipilot.”

Enabling technologies
Over the years, many technologies
and operating practices have evolved
to help make CBM a viable energy
resource. Ten specific enabling technologies may offer the best chance for
projects to reach their life-cycle potential and span multiple life-cycle phases
(Table 1):
1. Geospatial well-pattern optimization.
CBM geospatial well-pattern optimization requires an understanding of CBM
production mechanics and reservoir
simulation for production and economic forecasting. Although well spacing
is usually a north-south and east-west
grid, optimized well patterns are determined by reservoir characteristics, completion effectiveness, well-stimulation
effects, drilling and completion costs,
operating costs, and outside factors.
For minimal cost, virtual simulation
enables economic assessment, wellpattern comparisons, and completion
options for hundreds of virtual wells.
2. Core and core analysis. Scientific
analysis of coal core can be critical to
the success of Phases 1 and 2. Calculating gas in place from direct core

measurements is a major first step in
assessing methane gas reserves trapped
in the rock matrix. Gas-content determination is largely independent of the
core porosity and permeability, but is a
function of methane adsorption within
the coal macerals.
Prospectors may tend to rely on
nonspecific seam lithotypes and assumed values for adsorption isotherms.
Gas contents are calculated with assumed isotherms, reservoir pressures,
and gross seam thickness. Although
these estimates are appropriate during
early prospect evaluation, they must be
validated through direct-core measurement in Phase 2. A complete coal-seam
anatomy can be obtained and applied to
the macroscale reservoir.
3. Well logging. Significant technical breakthroughs in well logging
have been developed specific to CBM.
Perhaps the greatest advances involve
log-processing methods and core-log
integration techniques. Table 2 provides
recommended log suites for projects in
Phases 2 through 5.
Electric microimaging (EMI) logging
may provide the closest thing to a continuous core as currently possible. It can
be integrated with the whole core so
that grayscale levels can be correlated to
discrete core lithology. Such integration
can be performed in one well and applied across the field or basin that lacks
core information.
4. Cleat permeability determination. Three
technologies are potentially available
for cleat permeability determination
and are applied predominantly through
Phases 2 and 3:
• Openhole discrete-seam drillstem
testing (DST).
• Interference testing and injection
fall-off.
• G-function derivative analysis.
DST technology can enable the highgrading of discrete seams for subsequent production during the corehole
process. Multiwell interference testing
can enable the acquisition of far-field
regional cleat permeability and permeability anisotropy. G-function analysis,
primarily used for comparing regional

variations, can enable near-field qualitative cleat permeability information to
be obtained in conjunction with the
hydraulic fracturing parameters.
5. Primary hydraulic fracture stimulation.
Very few coal-seam gas reservoirs can
produce commercial rates of methane
without some type of primary production enhancement. Three primary
proven stimulation technologies have
been developed for enhancing CBM
production: cavitation, underreaming,

and hydraulic fracture stimulation. Historically, the most effective technology
appears to be hydraulic fracturing although novel stimulated horizontal and
complex wells are rapidly becoming
viable alternatives to traditional vertical
hydraulically fractured wells.
In the early phases, a technically,
rather than economically, optimal
fracturing system is critical to acquire
valid gas and water producibility data
for subsequent reservoir simulation

CBM stimulation experience of the
team member(s) responsible for developing the fracturing program.
10. Multiseam pinpoint hydraulic fracturing. One of the most significant enabling
technologies for CBM in recent years
involves technologies that enable the hydraulic fracturing of multiseam completions.
Another fracture stimulation option for multiseam completions (not
involving coiled tubing) is the conventional “Perf & Plug” method using
conventional wireline perforating and
composite bridge plugs that set quickly
and are easily drilled out at the end of
the completion.
Using coiled tubing, there are
several new methods for isolating and
fracturing individual coal seams, some
of which involve hydra-jet perforating (Fig. 4). These methods were
developed to minimize or eliminate
non-productive time by planning the
entire completion to be performed in
a single trip. Coiled tubing fracturing
technology allows placement of 30,000
to 100,000 lb/proppant per coal seam
With pump time of about 1 hr/seam,
three to seven stages have been successfully treated in a single day. For shallow
CBM wells, as many as 24 intervals in
two separate wells have been fracture
stimulated in a single day with the same
crew and equipment.

CobraMax fracturing service uses hydra-jet perforating and proppant plug diversion to fracture multiple
intervals, vertically and horizontally (Fig. 4).

Other key functions of the FLBS
chemistry are to degrade residual polymer remaining from previous gelledfracturing operations and dissolve in
situ geochemical precipitates or carbonate scales that may be contributing to
premature production declines.
Coal fines tend to collect in both
proppant and cleat porosity; eventually,
such plugging may damage permeability and conductivity. FLBS causes fines
to segregate and then adhesively bond
together in larger groupings that bond
onto proppant or cleat surfaces while
keeping flow channels open to flow.

and a project ROI of over 2000%.

Future technologies
No one individual technology can
make unconventional assets profitable. A
comprehensive holistic approach must
be taken into account beginning with
seismic and continuing through to last
stage of production including plug/
abandonment. Future exploitation of
unconventional gas sources will require
development and-or refinement of several technologies:
• Deformable proppants
• Partial monolayer proppant designs
• Proppant transport
• Improving proppants and fluids
that are better tailored to formations.
• Create a better understanding of
reservoirs by improving reservoir modeling and description
• Better prevention of circulation
losses while drilling.
• Recycling and purification of water used in well-service functions.

tane, aromatics) increase the incentive
for hydrocrackers to operate in the most
optimal and profitable ways.
Hydrocrackers that were designed
as state-of-the-art 20-30 years ago in
an environment of relatively low crude
prices may not be as profitable as a unit
designed recently.
Common requests from refiners to
improve profitability and reliability of
an existing hydrocracker include how
to increase feed rate, how to process
more difficult feeds (e.g., higher feed
end point, FCC cycle oil, coker gas oil,
deasphalted oil, synthetic feed), how to
increase cycle life, how to produce the
most profitable yield slates, and how to
improve product qualities. The wish list

could be extremely long such that there
is no unique solution.
Close cooperation between the
refinery, head office process engineering, technology providers, and catalyst
suppliers is essential to identify profit
enhancement opportunities and implement cost effective solutions for an
existing hydrocracker.

North Atlantic Reﬁning Ltd.
The history of the North Atlantic Refinery includes ownership by a number
of different companies since its construction. Shaheen Resources originally
built this oil refinery between 1971-73
with its first shipment of crude oil being refined in May 1973.

Shaheen operated the refinery until
1976 at which time the company went
bankrupt and the refinery was shut
down. The oil refinery was refurbished
and brought back online 10 years later.
In August 1994, North Atlantic Refining
Ltd. purchased the refinery, and after a
major overhaul, has been operating the
115,000-b/d plant since.
The refinery’s location gives it access
to petroleum product markets in Europe
and the US Eastern seaboard and puts it
close to sour crude supplies from Russia, Venezuela, and the Persian Gulf.

Operating opportunities
The hydrocracker at North Atlantic is
a series flow, single-stage hydrocracker
with two parallel reactors; each reactor
contains three beds. For the last decade,
the first bed in each reactor typically has
contained a combination of demetallization and pretreat catalyst to remove
feed contaminants and reduce nitrogen
slip to protect the cracking catalyst in the
second and third bed of each reactor.
The refinery has faced numerous
issues concerning hydrocracker performance. In the early 1990s, a good
cycle length was 9 months. As catalysts
improved, and with additional focus on
operational issues, the cycle length was
extended to about 3 years.
There were, however, still issues with
high deactivation rates due to processing visbreaker gas oils, with high-pressure-drop incidents due to upstream
unit upsets, with an inability to control
the temperature in the high-pressure
separator during high ambient temperature periods, and with high radial
temperature profiles in each of the catalyst beds. The refiner, therefore, decided
to address all these issues during the
current cycle.
The specific areas of technical improvement to the hydrocracker were:
• Optimizing feedstock selection
and opportunity crude processing.
• Applying an advanced tailored
catalyst system provided by Criterion
and Zeolyst.
• Process improvements and instal-

Normally, processing visbreaker gas
oils is profitable. Due to operational
and separation issues, however, the
visbreaker gas oils were more contaminated than desired for processing in the
hydrocracker, which led to accelerated
catalyst deactivation.
Criterion and Zeolyst provided North
Atlantic with a yield and activity report
for removing visbreaker gas oil from
the feed. This confirmed North Atlantic’s decision to remove this component
from the feed until it could address the
quality issues.
Another critical factor that influences
hydrocracker profitability is unplanned
contamination of the feedstock. During a review of the previous cycle, the
refiner determined that the line used to
transfer imported gas oil to tankage before feeding the hydrocracker was also
used to transfer No. 6 oil to the wharf.
No. 6 oil contains more metals, sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon residue than
the typical hydrocracker feed. When
the procedure was reviewed, steps were
added to confirm that the line was
properly flushed so that the hydrocracker feed would not be contaminated
with No. 6 oil. These steps were deemed
important because the transfer of
imported gas oil for the hydrocracker
only occurs on a monthly or longer
frequency.

drop. The unit, however, had previously
faced premature end-of-run due to high
pressure drop across the catalyst beds.
There were two pressure-drop issues.
The first was excessive pressure drop
across the first bed due to particulates
and crust formation. The second issue
was the total pressure drop across the
reactor loop from compressor discharge
to suction.
Additional catalyst volume allowed
all of the partners to consider installing additional demetallization catalyst
and grading material to deal with crust
formation, but the total pressure drop
issues still needed to be addressed.

Due to all of these changes, the unit
is more profitable. The weighted average bed temperature (WABT) has been
lowered at higher throughput and higher
conversion.
The previous cycle was about 32
months with an intermediate changeout
of pretreat catalyst. The current cycle
was proposed to be 48 months, but the
hydrocracker is on track for a cycle that
will approach 5 years with an intermediate changeout of pretreat catalyst. This
extension of the pretreat catalyst cycle
length and cracking catalyst cycle length
translates into one less mini-turnaround
and one less full turnaround during a
10-year period.
The current WABT is lower even
though the feed rate and conversion have
been higher and more consistent for this
cycle than for the previous cycle.
The unit is currently running 10-15°
F. less than a comparable point in the
previous cycle. This activity advantage
translates to a cycle-length extension of
at least 1 year.
Although the overall WABT is lower
than the WABT for the previous cycle,
an additional benefit can be seen when

the cracking catalyst (two of the three
beds in the reactor). Also, compared
to past performance, the pressuredifference increase in the current cycle
was mitigated via the Shell top-bed
filter tray and top-bed grading system,
both of which can remove and store
fines without immediately plugging the
catalyst system.
The first two curves in Fig. 2 show the
reactor’s pressure drop for the previous
cracking catalyst cycle that included a
top-bed replacement. The third curve is
for the current cycle, showing the actual
pressure drop. The lower rate of increase
of the pressure drop confirms that the
current cycle will not be pressure-drop
limited.

of a filter tray, and bed grading in the

profile for each of the beds was one indication of better reactor flow distribution.
Fig. 3 shows another view of better catalyst utilization from the beds’
WABTs. There are two improvements in
the Bed 1 WABT. The first improvement
is a lower WABT due to improved activity of the pretreat catalyst. The second
improvement is a lower deactivation
rate due to the improved flow distribution. This lower deactivation improvement is also present for the catalyst in
Beds 2 and 3.
Each of the beds is currently oper-

ating at a WABT 10-15° F. less than a
comparable point in the previous cycle,
indicating an extension of the cycle by
at least 1 year.
All of these WABT improvements are
even more important when one looks
at the unit’s overall conversion change
between this and the previous cycle.
Fig. 4 shows that, in addition to
WABT improvements, the unit has been
running more than 2.5% higher overall
conversion this cycle compared to the
previous cycle.
One of the critical end-of-run limits
in the past has been excessive production of LPG due to poor selectivity.

Date

Fig. 5 shows that the combination
of new internals with better catalyst
utilization and the TX catalyst shape that
further reduces nonselective overcracking has lowered LPG make from the
hydrocracker. At this point in the cycle,
LPG make is about 300 b/d less than
the previous cycle. The reduction in LPG
make will remove this constraint on the
cycle length.
An additional interest for the refiner
was increasing the total distillate make
from the unit at constant overall conversion.
Fig. 6 shows total distillate yield.
There are two points of interest that
demonstrate the effect of good flow and
temperature distribution in the catalyst
bed. The first point is increased yield of
distillate caused by the uniform use of
all the catalyst in the bed (no overcracking in part of the bed leading to high
radials). The second point is increased
yield stability due to more uniform
catalyst use and deactivation.
With the significant shift of products
from LPG and light naphtha to heavy
naphtha and distillate, the C5+ liquid
volume gain remained about constant
with a slight decrease in hydrogen
consumption.
Figs. 7 and 8 show these additional
improvements in overall unit profitability. Fig. 7 shows the C5+ total volume
gain across the unit and Fig. 8 shows
66

hydrogen consumption.
With the improved yields and
product properties, diesel produced by
the hydrocracker meets ULSD specifications during normal operations. This
improvement allows for the reduction
of sulfur analyses of the diesel to only
those times when the unit is upset.
Routine sulfur monitoring is now only
conducted on the naphtha and bottoms
streams because ULSD specifications
will be met whenever the bottoms’
sulfur level is less than 40 ppm.
In addition to the improvement in
the fractionator bottoms API, there is a
corresponding improvement in the sulfur and nitrogen levels remaining in the
fractionator bottoms (Figs. 9 and 10).
All of these changes allowed the refiner to maximize catalyst activity to be
used beyond the previous constraints of
pressure drop, demetallization capacity,
or nonselective yields. ✦

the magnetic bearing cavities during
start-up, shutdown, or the bearings being de-energized.
An outer seal labyrinth on the gas
seal that has barrier air going to it, outboard of the secondary vent, makes it
very difficult for gas to enter the bearing chamber. Any gas that gets across
the secondary seal will be pushed out
to the secondary vent by the barrier air,
which should be vented to atmosphere.
An air purge to the bearing chambers, also vented to atmosphere, helps
dispose of any additional gas that crosses the secondary seal. Positive pressure
on the bearing housings should help
keep process gas from entering. The
barrier labyrinth should also help prevent combustible gas from migrating
into the magnetic bearing chamber.
As long as the system is working
properly, with barrier air flowing, there
should be no process gas getting into
the bearing chamber. The magnetic
bearing design has no ignition source
since the whole magnetic bearing assembly is sealed and should be contactfree (rotor and stator) with an air gap
providing dampening and the magnetic
field needed to achieve its function.
A differential pressure monitoring
device, if working properly, will also
trigger a unit shutdown on reversed

CONSIDER: If you use solid film backed corrosion
coatings, you may be crippling your CP investment.
There is a common sense reason for
this. CP systems protect pipelines by
delivering electrical current to the steel
surface. Solid film back corrosion
coatings have the property of high
dielectric strength, which means they
block electrical current. This blocking
effect is called cathodic shielding.
Cathodic shielding has been the subject
of dozens of technical papers since the
mid 1980’s.

Two corrosion coatings are proven to
be non-shielding, and allow passage of
protective CP currents. One othese
coatings is FBE. The other is Polyguard
RD-6.
If you are concerned that your
organization is behind this curve, visit

______
information about shielding problems.

Polyguard has been ISO 9000 certified since 1996.
Current certifications are:
- American Natl. Standards Institute
- Dutch Council for Certification
- Deutscher Akkreditierungs Rat

CONDENSATE EAST OF SUEZ:
NGL and its Naphtha Impacts in
Asia Pacific and Mideast Gulf
Condensate and the Light-End Products Squeeze
By Asia Paciﬁc Energy Consulting

• This is the “deﬁnitive” report on
condensate in the fastest growing,
critical regions of the world, Asia
Paciﬁc and the Mideast Gulf.
• The study provides a complete guide
to optimizing value in future condensate production, utilization, and trade.

Condensate coming into its own
Condensate, one of the two groups
deﬁned as Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs),
is ﬁnally coming of age in world trade,
marketing, reﬁning and petrochemicals. Condensate sales are moving
from a niche marketing specialty to
a mainstream segment of crude and
products trade, and nowhere is this
more evident than in the Mideast Gulf
and Asia Paciﬁc.
This report explains how the protean
nature of condensate allows it to be
used in a wide range of sectors: as a
reﬁnery slate component; in specialized distillation towers called condensate splitters; in direct feed to ethylene crackers; in gasoline blending and
as a substitute for gas in turbine power generation. It can be deﬁned as a
base material, a blending component,
a feedstock or a boiler feed.

Import arguments
backﬁre against
US oil producers
Arguments aimed at cutting US oil imports do producers more harm than good
in Washington, DC. The industry should try
a different approach.
Reducing oil imports is a legitimate
goal. For the US economy, domestically
produced oil—with all the incomes and tax
payments it represents—surely beats the
imported kind.
Import worry just doesn’t work as an

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

argument for policies essential to the expansion of US production.
In fact, it regularly succeeds as an argument to forget about expanding production
and to quit using oil altogether—a popular
fantasy with inexplicably strong inﬂuence
over policy-making.
Consider the House Select Committee
on Energy Independence and Global Warming.
The group’s web site disparages oil
imports for the usual reasons—funding of
terrorists, proﬁts for totalitarian regimes,
intensifying competition for petroleum
resources.
And, typically, it neglects to mention the
economic goodness that the US forgoes
with however much oil it imports instead of
producing in off-limits areas such as 85% of
the Outer Continental Shelf and the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge coastal plain.
If imports are so bad, why doesn’t the
US open the closed areas to boost domestic production?
According to the committee, it can’t. The
web site ludicrously compares US oil reserves (12th highest in the world) with total
Middle Eastern reserves and implies that
US production (third highest in the world)
can’t increase—although it did so last year.
The committee further characterizes the
potential of ANWR—the coastal plain resource of which the US Geological Society
estimates at 11.6-31.5 billion bbl of oil in
place—as “a drop in the bucket in reducing
the amount of imported oil.”
It’s no surprise that an outﬁt with this
sense of proportion should think conservation and alternative energy by themselves
can meet all US energy needs. They can’t.
Yet the view prevails. The US has a new
energy law that boosts alternative energy
sources and tinkers with consumption but
says nothing about leasing of ANWR or
locked-up expanses of the OCS.
The industry needs a new argument—
maybe something that relates oil supply to
a public concern less abstract than imports,
like price.

Recession worries trip up oil rally
Tight fundamentals, difﬁcult geopolitics, and fears that an economic recession
will reduce demand continue to worry energy markets.
After falling three consecutive sessions amid continued signs of a slowing economy, crude futures prices rebounded somewhat Jan. 8 when Nigeria’s most powerful rebel force, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, reiterated its
objective of halting 2 million b/d of crude exports from that country.
However, crude prices fell again in volatile trading Jan. 9-11 as traders shrugged
off an eighth consecutive week of declining inventories and worried instead that a
possible recession would diminish demand. The Energy Information Administration
said commercial US inventories plunged 6.8 million bbl to 282.8 million bbl in the
week ended Jan. 4, well below the Wall Street consensus of a 1.1 million bbl decline.
Gasoline stocks jumped by 5.3 million bbl to 213.1 million bbl during the same week,
the single largest increase since December 2006. Distillate fuel inventories increased
by 1.5 million bbl to 128.7 million bbl. US imports of crude declined by 203,000 b/d
to 9.8 million b/d during that same week. However, the input of crude into US reﬁneries increased by 389,000 b/d to 15.8 million b/d, with reﬁnery operations increasing
to 91.3% of capacity. Gasoline production increased to 9.1 million b/d while distillate
fuel production rose to 4.5 million b/d (OGJ Online, Jan. 9, 2008).
A suggestion by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke that more “substantive” reductions of US interest rates may be pending helped slow the fall of crude
prices on Jan. 10.
Crude futures prices increased more than $10/bbl in December to $100/bbl during
the ﬁrst trading session of 2008. But in early January, prices moved in a $7/bbl band
below this milestone. “Further advances have been resisted by weak US economic
data and forecasts of mild weather, both of which point to weaker US oil demand,”
said analysts at KBC Process Technology Ltd. in England.
“The rally in crude oil continues to stumble due to concerns over a US recession,”
said analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc. “However,
several data points help support the underlying bullish story. Speciﬁcally, US crude
inventories continue to fall. Crude inventories have now fallen 22 of the last 27
weeks. Also helping to put a ﬂoor underneath crude prices is news that China has
announced a freeze on gasoline price increases. This price freeze should help ensure
that Asian demand for crude and reﬁned products will remain strong,” Raymond
James analysts said.
Adam Sieminski, chief energy economist, Deutsche Bank AG, New York, said,
“Demand remains relatively unresponsive to higher energy prices due to the growth
in real incomes. Prices could be impacted by a global slowdown in gross domestic product, but a worldwide recession does not seem likely.” Deutsche Bank now
expects West Texas Intermediate and North Sea Brent nominal prices to average $75/
bbl in 2010 and $80/bbl in 2012-13, compared with prior “midcycle” estimates nearer
$65/bbl. US natural gas prices are forecast to average $8.75/MMbtu.
China, US drivers
Sieminski said China and US monetary policy should remain the key drivers of
commodity markets during 2008. He predicted, “The strength in underlying gross
domestic product and income growth across China will remain a major factor supporting commodity prices over the next few years. Indeed, the steady increase in
Chinese GDP per capita since 1995 is remarkably similar to the improvement in living standards that unfolded in South Korea and Taiwan from 1980.”
Furthermore, Sieminski said 55% of China’s total population should be in urban
areas by 2020, similar to the current urbanization ratio of Malaysia and the Philippines. “Since per capita energy consumption in urban areas is 3.5 times more than
that in rural areas, the urbanization trend is generating a sustained period of strong
energy demand,” Sieminski said.
He said, “We believe the run-up in oil prices during the fourth quarter of 2007
goes beyond what can be explained by the decline in the US dollar and the level of
global growth. However, reﬁnery capacity, oil production constraints, and geopolitical issues continue to play a very important role in boosting prices. We believe it
will require some normalizing of these factors to achieve our average crude oil price
forecast of $85/bbl.”
Sieminski said, “We expect [natural gas] prices will eventually beneﬁt from inadequate capacity additions from proposed coal projects and wind power, which are
required to meet electricity generation needs.”

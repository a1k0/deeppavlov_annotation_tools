DOI to assemble royalty policies review panel
The US Department of the Interior is forming an independent
panel to examine royalty policies and procedures on federal and
Indian lands, the federal department announced on Nov. 14.
The Subcommittee on Royalty Management will operate under
the Royalty Policy Committee, an independent advisory board that
the Interior secretary appoints to advise the US Minerals Management Service on royalty management and other mineral-related
policies.
“Recently, there has been much interest regarding the accuracy
and effectiveness of the minerals management program within
[MMS],” said C. Stephen Allred, assistant Interior secretary for land
and minerals management.
“We have decided that a review of the procedures and policies
surrounding management of mineral revenue at [DOI] is in order,”
he wrote in a letter to incoming Royalty Policy Committee Chairman Daniel Reimer.
MMS attracted heavy criticism earlier this year following the
discovery that price thresholds were omitted from federal deepwater oil and gas leases issued in 1998-99. Thomas M. Davis (RVa.), chairman of the House Government Reform Committee, and
Darrell E. Issa (R-Calif.), chairman of the committee’s energy subcommittee, have asked the Government Accountability Office for
an investigation.
Allred said that the panel specifically would review:
• The extent to which existing reporting and accounting procedures and processes are sufficient to assure that MMS receives the
correct amount.
• MMS audit, compliance, and reporting procedures to ensure
that lessees comply with existing statutes, terms, and regulations
governing royalties.
• Operations of the royalty in-kind program to assure that adequate policies, procedures, and controls are in place.
Subcommittee members will be announced soon, Allred said.
He added that the group would spend 6 months on its review before reporting to the full Royalty Policy Committee.

Iraq to boost oil output, develop Al Ahdab ﬁeld
Iraqi oil minister Hussein al-Shahristani, fresh from a tour of
Asia, said he expects his country to produce 3 million b/d of crude
oil by yearend and, with new investment, some 4.5 million b/d
by 2010.
He said Iraq produced an average of 2.3 million b/d in October,
and exported 1.6-1.7 million b/d despite 2-3 insurgent attacks/
week on the country’s pipelines.
Sharistani has just returned from a tour of Asian countries where
he won support for increased investment in Iraq’s oil industry, in

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

particular from China and Japan.
In China, he brokered an agreement with the China National
Petroleum Corp. for new exploration rights over al-Ahdab field in
southern Iraq. He said a joint Iraqi-Chinese committee will hold
meetings in Baghdad, beginning on Nov. 11, to determine how to
develop the oil field.
In June 1997 China signed a $700 million contract to explore
al-Ahdab over 23 years. Plans originally called for 90,000 b/d of
oil production, but field development was suspended due to UN
sanctions on Iraq and to security problems since the beginning of
the US-led war in 2002.
Al-Ahdab field, in the middle and southern regions of Iraq, has
estimated reserves of as much as 1 billion bbl of oil and is considered commercially viable, especially because of its proximity to
existing pipelines and refineries.
During Sharastani’s swing through Asia, he also held talks with
Sinopec Group and CNOOC to seek more energy investment in
Iraq once the new Iraqi energy investment law is approved.
In Japan, Shahristani said, the government promised to give a
soft loan of $3.5 billion to help Iraq build a refinery and a floating
loading platform off Basra in the Persian Gulf.

UK still studying 24th-round license bids
The UK government will publish the results of its 24th licensing round “within weeks,” Energy Minister Malcolm Wicks said in
Aberdeen during a conference by the UK Offshore Operators’ Association. Operators had hoped he would report bid results.
The Department for Trade and Industry (DTI), which issues the
licenses, is carrying out further environmental checks against the
147 applications received from 121 companies, he said. The round
closed June 16 (OGJ, Aug. 7, 2006, p. 37).
A DTI spokesman told OGJ that the agency has sought comments on environmental issues raised by its licenses as stipulated
by the European Union’s recently clarified Habitat Directive.

Baltimore marketer settles EPA tank charges
Carroll Independent Fuel Co. reached a consent agreement with
the US Environmental Protection Agency Nov. 14 in which the Baltimore-based heating oil, gasoline, and products distributor agreed
to pay a $284,156 civil penalty and complete a special environmental project at 32 of its facilities in Maryland.
EPA’s regional office in Philadelphia cited Carroll for several underground storage tank (UST) violations including failure to perform release detection, meet new UST system standards for spill
and over-fill prevention, provide corrosion protection on metal
piping, investigate a suspected release, report a suspected release,
and perform lint tightness testing.
The alleged violations were documented through multifacility

Statoil gets stake in deepwater block off Angola
Statoil ASA has signed a production-sharing agreement (PSA)
with Angola’s Sonangol for a 5% interest in deepwater Bock 15/06
off Angola.
The 2,984-sq-km block, in 300-1,800 m of water about 100
km from Luanda, is composed of relinquished parts of Block 15.
These parts were relinquished in 2002, when the exploration period of that acreage of Block 15 expired.
The work program for Block 15/06 includes 3D seismic surveys and drilling eight wells in the first 5 years of the exploration
phase.

Chevron strikes gas with wildcat off Australia

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

On the first of two 4-hr flow tests of the uppermost Shuaiba
section of the Thamama, over an open-hole interval from 4,363 m
to 4,383 m, the well achieved an average stable flow rate of 3,524
b/d of 42° gravity oil and 1 MMscfd of gas on a 36⁄64-in. choke at
2,512 psi. This success followed acidization and initial clean-up
period.
On the second test, the well’s flow rate increased to an average
4,392 b/d of oil and 1.4 MMscfd of gas through a 50⁄64-in. choke
at 1,711 psi.
After completing flow testing, Indago, the block operator, will
shut in the well to conduct a pressure build-up survey.
Both the primary reservoir (Mishrif-Mauddud) and secondary
target (Thamama) were encountered higher to prognosis, resulting in a longer hydrocarbon-bearing interval in the Thamama than
expected. However, the Shuaiba section of the Thamama was not
previously part of Indago’s audited 2P reserve estimates, plus, the
reservoir has yet to be assigned commercial reserves, Indago said.
It plans to conduct a second flow test in the Mishrif-Mauddud
following the Thamama testing period. Previously, flow rates of as
much as 13.6 MMscfd and 2,910 b/d of condensate have been
obtained in the Mishrif formation, which lies above the Thamama,
in the 1976 discovery well.

Chevron Corp. has made a natural gas discovery with its Clio1 wildcat in 3,000 ft of water on permit WA-205-P, 90 miles off

Indago Petroleum Ltd. subsidiary Indago Oman Ltd. has begun
testing the West Bukha-2A (WB2A) well on Block 8 off Oman, as it
pursues a production target of first-quarter 2008.
WB2A, a sidetrack of the original West Bukha-2 wellbore, penetrated the Shuaiba and Kharaib reservoirs of the Lower Cretaceous
Thamama formation.
The WB2A sidetrack, a result of the drill string parting while
drilling, reached a depth of 4,529 m and was plugged back to

reach 30,000 b/d by 2011.
Urals Energy plans to sell the oil to Pacific Rim consumers,
probably China.
China and Russia are studying construction of an oil pipeline
spur from Skovorodino to the Chinese border. The spur would be
part of ESPO Pipeline connecting eastern Siberian oil deposits with
an export terminal on Russia’s Pacific coast (OGJ Online, Oct. 26,
2006).
Urals Energy said it would soon begin project design work for
the Dulisma-ESPO interconnect, commencing procurement of pipe
and other facilities by April 2007.
The ESPO line, which will be built in phases, is expected to start
delivering oil in mid-2008.
Interim field production prior to connecting Dulisma to ESPO
will continue to be transported to Ust-Kut via a temporary pipeline
operated by an adjoining producer, Urals Energy said. ✦

Terra Nova production resumes off St. John’s

Fortune Oil begins CBM drilling in China

Production from Terra Nova oil field resumed Nov. 12, following completion of a planned maintenance turnaround on the Terra
Nova floating production, storage, and offloading vessel (OGJ, Sept.
11, 2006, Newsletter).
The FPSO returned to the field Sept. 25 and was reconnected
to its mooring system Oct. 1. Operator Petro-Canada expects Terra
Nova average fourth quarter production to be 33,000 b/d gross.
“Over the course of the fourth quarter, we expect to restart all
the wells and ramp up to peak production volumes in the 100,000
to 110,000 b/d range,” said Bill Fleming, Petro-Canada’s vice-president, East Coast oil. “Along with the work done in the turnaround,
the 40 new beds on the FPSO will permit improved inspection
and preventative maintenance programs aimed at reducing future
downtime.”

A unit of Fortune Oil PLC has begun drilling its first pilot well
on the Liulin Block in the eastern Ordos basin of Shanxi Province,
China. The Ordos basin is one of the world’s largest CBM resource
areas.
Fortune Liulin Gas Co. Ltd., which entered into a productionsharing contract for development of the coalbed methane (CBM)
block, spudded the FL-EP2 vertical production well on Nov. 7. The
company plans to drill this well to a TD of 1,155 m and take core
samples from coal seams numbers 4, 5, and 8.
A second vertical pilot production well—FL-EP1, targeting 610
m TD—will be drilled later this year.
After the two wells are complete, Fortune will fracture stimulate
Seam 8 in both wells and will monitor production rates of CBM gas
and water over the following months.
More than 70 coal coreholes and several CBM exploration wells
have been drilled in the Liulin Block. The available data indicate that
coal seam thickness, depth, gas content, and permeability appear to
be highly prospective.
Fortune recently completed a joint study with the Shanxi Coal
Bureau to analyze and map this data, which was used to optimize
the locations for FL-EP1 and FL-EP2. The wells should provide significant reservoir and production data to assist in certification of
gas reserves on the block, although it will not be possible to properly quantify the results until second quarter 2007.
The company has procured all necessary environmental permits
for drilling in 2006-07. Further pilot production and slim-hole
data wells are planned for 2007, with the aim of declaring commerciality for the block in 2008.

Regulators approve Suncor’s oil sands projects
Suncor Energy Inc. said the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board
(EUB) on Nov. 14 approved the company’s application to build a
third oil sands upgrader, Voyageur, and approved plans to develop
the Steepbank mine expansion.
Voyageur is the centerpiece in Suncor’s plans to boost oil sands
production to 500,000 b/d by 2012. Suncor plans to begin preparation for both Voyageur and Steepbank next year.
Meanwhile, work continues on the Athabasca oil sands expansion north of Fort McMurray (OGJ, Sept. 25, 2006, p. 39). With
commissioning targeted for 2008, that expansion is expected to
increase production to 350,000 b/d from 260,000 b/d.
Construction was 65% complete as of Sept. 30. Other work under way includes expansion of Suncor’s in situ operations, with
completion expected in 2007.
In granting Voyageur and Steepbank project approvals, the EUB
outlined several conditions for Suncor. Three conditions specifically
deal with managing tailings: the mixture of water, clay, sand, and
residual bitumen produced during the extraction process. Separately, Suncor announced 2007 spending plans of $5.3 billion (Can.),
of which $4.4 billion will be dedicated to oil sands.

GlobalSantaFe, BHP agree to extend rig contracts

Chevron plans further Pascagoula reﬁnery upgrades ing for the CCR project, for which construction, if approved by
Chevron USA Inc. has applied for an environmental permit to
construct a continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) unit and several other minor units at its 325,000 b/cd refinery in Pascagoula,
Miss.
These projects are to follow the refinery’s $150 million fluid
catalytic cracking (FCC) project, which remains on track to be
completed by yearend and will increase the plant’s gasoline production capacity by 10% to 5.5 million gal/day.
The CCR project is expected to further boost gasoline production capacity at the refinery by about 15%, adding 725,000 gal/
day. The project will not increase the plant’s crude oil capacity.
The CCR unit would replace two process units constructed
more than 30 years ago, improving the refinery’s ability to provide
reliable supplies of gasoline to key markets in the eastern US, said
general manager Roland Kell.
Chevron has selected WorleyParsons to complete the engineer-

begin in first quarter 2008.
Environmental permitting will run concurrently with Chevron’s
evaluation process.
Kell said Chevron plans to use appropriate air emission controls, installing best available control technology as required by
the environmental authorities and is also proposing to voluntarily
reduce certain emissions above current requirements. Meetings to
discuss these plans are currently being organized with community
groups.
Meanwhile, Chevron’s FCC project, along with another project
completed earlier this year at the company’s refinery in El Segundo,
Calif., will collectively bring online for Chevron about 1 million
gal/day of additional gasoline manufacturing capacity—a 7% increase relative to the company’s total US refinery gasoline production in 2005. ✦

Gas ﬁnd could feed LNG in Papua New Guinea
InterOil Corp.’s Elk-1 gas discovery in the onshore eastern
Papuan basin could potentially kick-start an LNG industry in the
country, according to Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Michael
Somare.
He said the project could be a driving force towards the creation
of an industrialized nation.
The facility, proposed by Toronto-based InterOil and international investment bank Merrill Lynch last month for a site near Port
Moresby, could be delivering LNG cargos by second quarter 2011
(OGJ, Oct, 23, 2006, p. 32)
Papua New Guinea authorities likely will officially declare Elk-1
a discovery once the technical staff completes a review of drillstem
test data that indicated an open flow potential of 28.5 MMcfd of
gas.
Reserves are reported at 3 tcf of gas.
InterOil intends to drill appraisal wells on Elk and conduct more
exploration on adjoining structures.
Interestingly, Papua New Guinea’s endorsement of Elk coincides
with the increasing unlikelihood that the long-proposed Papua
New Guinea-Australia gas pipeline project will go ahead.
Somare also had a dig at the world’s oil majors when he said
Papua New Guinea needed to be proactive in the development of
its natural resources.
He said the country could not allow supermajors to place the

LNG Ltd. moving into Middle East
LNG Ltd., Perth, and Iran’s state-owned National Iranian Oil Co.
(NIOC) have signed a gas supply deal by which NIOC will provide
as much as 530 MMcfd of gas to LNG Ltd.’s proposed LNG production project on Qeshm Island, off Iran. NIOC has identified several gas
fields for potential development near the proposed plant.
The project marks LNG Ltd.’s initial move into the Middle East.
The company plans to construct a 3.5 million tonne/year LNG
liquefaction plant at Qeshm, to produce LNG for sale in India or
East Africa.
It will develop the facility in three stages: The first, scheduled to
come on stream in first quarter 2010, will have an annual production capacity of 1.15 million tonnes. LNG Ltd. expects financial
close to be reached within a year.
To fast-track the project, the company will immediately select
its preferred site on Qeshm Island.
It will benefit from work already done during the last 18
months on its proposed Padang LNG Project in central Sulawesi,
Indonesia.
Both projects involve similar-sized production trains, construction techniques, and scheduling and are expected to take 2 years
to build. ✦

Climate pressure tactics
As though uncertainty over promised benefits
didn’t provide reason enough to be skeptical, climate alarmists are undermining their agenda with
pressure tactics designed to squelch rather than
win arguments. By now, futility of the clumsily
fabricated Kyoto Protocol is obvious. Repeated
claims about a “consensus” of scientists have
degenerated into discredited propaganda. And
former US Vice-President Al Gore’s sermons about
the moral imperative of believing whatever he says
about global warming speak for themselves.
By nature, however, zeal never rests. A portion
of humanity has convinced itself that people are
warming the climate dangerously. So it demands
that all of humanity change behavior. It declares
scientific arguments to have been settled in its
favor and rejects suggestions to the contrary as
apostasy. It scoffs at precautionary suggestions that
differ from its own.
These are not the persuasive activities of groups
comfortable with the logic of their position. They
seem, in fact, desperately manipulative. And they
characterize two decades of global warming politics.

New gambits
Most visible in a new round of pressure gambits is a report by Nicholas Stern, head of the UK
Government Economic Service and former chief
economist of the World Bank. The report claims
that failure to act on climate change will generate
costs and risks equivalent to at least 5%/year of
global gross domestic product, “now and forever,”
and perhaps 20%/year or more. And it says the cost
of avoiding the worst effects of climate change,
requiring cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions of 25%
between now and 2050 “and perhaps much more,”
can be held to 1%/year of global GDP.
Who wouldn’t invest 1%/year of economic
output to avoid 20%/year of cost? But the deal’s
not that good. Critics of the 575-page Stern Report
point to flaws, including reliance on worst-case
assumptions about climate change, problems with
cost estimates, and sparse attention to the possible
benefits of climate change and to remediation strategies other than forced cuts in carbon emissions.
Hard on the heels of the Stern Report came a
proposal from French Prime Minister Dominique
de Villepin that the European Union impose a

carbon tax on imports from countries rejecting
international efforts to cut greenhouse-gas emissions. The blending of policy imperialism with
protectionist greed is clever. It probably deserves
sacramental status in Gore’s moral scheme.
More insidious is an effort in the US to force
regulation of greenhouse gases as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act (CAA). The Supreme Court soon
will hear arguments in a case challenging the US
Environmental Protection Agency’s refusal to regulate
emissions of greenhouse gases as CAA pollutants.
Environmental groups, the governments of 12 states,
and three cities want EPA to impose the regulation
under a section calling on the government to act on
“any air pollutant” that can “reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.” EPA says the
authority doesn’t apply to greenhouse gases.
The plaintiff’s argument asserts its conclusions.
Contrary to alarmist propaganda, the question
about climate-change danger to public health remains open. And equating CO2, a natural substance
essential to life, with pollutants addressed by CAA
is spurious. Plaintiffs are trying to accomplish in
court what they haven’t achieved in politics. Characteristically, they’re also trying to foreclose debate
on the need for costly remedy and on policy options that differ from the mandates and taxes they
favor.

Kyoto alternative
A Kyoto alternative received support Nov. 14
in a press briefing by Margo Thorning, managing
director of the International Council on Capital
Formation. Thorning called the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate (APP)
preferable to Kyoto, in part because it allows for
economic growth. Signed last year by India, China,
South Korea, Japan, Australia, and the US, the APP
relies on technological development, technical
transfer, and international consensus. Thorning
cited a recent study done for ICCF that concluded
the APP can outperform Kyoto in cuts of global
greenhouse-gas emissions.
To alarmists, however, emissions cuts unassociated
with the manipulation of people by governments
seem not to matter. If alarmists have their way, in fact,
prospects for such cuts will receive no attention at
all. ✦

GTL, other gas
In June, the $950-million Oryx
gas-to-liquids plant was inaugurated
in Qatar (OGJ Online, June 7, 2006).
It is the first commercial GTL plant in
the world and utilizes the proprietary,
low-temperature Sasol Slurry Phase
Distillate process, which is based on
Fischer-Tropsch technology (OGJ, Mar.
14, 2005, p. 18).
The plant will convert 330 MMcfd
of lean gas from Qatar’s North gas field
into 34,000 b/d of ultralow-sulfur
diesel, 24,000 b/d of diesel, 9,000 b/d
of naphtha, and 1,000 b/d of LPG.
In Spreetal, Germany, the Siemens
Power Generation Group plans to build
a large-scale coal gasification plant. The
plant will have more than 1,000 Mw
thermal capacity and is scheduled for
completion in 2009.
GE Energy & Bechtel Power have
agreed with American Electric Power to
proceed with the front-end engineering
and design of a 630-Mw coal gasification plant in Mason County, W.Va. The

orth Dakota Gov. John Hoeven
became chairman of the Interstate Oil & Gas Compact Commission at the group’s annual meeting
in Austin in late October and immediately announced several objectives. They include an initiative to
continue emphasizing states’ roles in
national energy policies and security,
continued efforts to reduce energy
manpower shortages, and support for
Wyoming Gov. Dave Freudenthal’s oil
price differentials task force.
“The United States is the major
supplier of natural gas and oil to the
United States. We often lose sight of the
abundant natural resources existing in
this country and their huge importance
to our citizens,” Hoeven said.
Freudenthal’s task force is examining price anomalies in the Rocky
Mountains and Northern Plains.
“The price differential has resulted in
creating unnecessary uncertainty for
mineral owners and companies that
are willing to explore and produce in
our part of the country,” said Hoeven.

Means Committee, which did not act
on it.
The second bill, HR 5234, aimed
to repeal Energy Policy Act provisions
relating to temporary expensing of oil
refining equipment, determination of a
small-refiner exception to the accounting for depletion on oil production, and
amortization of geological and geophysical expenses. It was introduced by
Rep. John B. Larson (D-Conn.) on Apr.
27 and referred to the Ways and Means
Committee, where it was not acted
upon.
The Democrats also propose repeal
of deepwater royalty relief, which they
say would save taxpayers up to $20 billion over the next 25 years. Deepwater
royalty relief became controversial earlier this year when it became apparent
that price thresholds were omitted for
leases issued during 1998-99.
Shortly before the election, House

Chairman Thomas M. Davis (R-Va.)

Darrell E. Issa (R-Calif.) announced that

federal deepwater leasing program.
Their likely successors when Democrats take control of the House in
January—Henry A. Waxman (Calif.)
and Diane E. Watson (Calif.), respectively—probably will try more aggressively
to recover royalties lost as a result of
the omission of price thresholds. They

His departure, along with the likely

IEA: Fossil energy to dominate market through 2030
Doris Leblond
OGJ Correspondent
Fossil fuels will dominate the energy
market through 2030 as oil’s share slips
to 33% from 35%, according to the
International Energy Agency’s World
Energy Outlook 2006.
The report said the reliance on
28

fossil fuels prevails both in a reference scenario, where current policies
remain the same, and in an alternative
policy scenario where governments
act strongly to create “an energy future
which is clean, clever, and competitive,”
but at a lower level.
In the reference scenario, oil demand
would grow by 1.3%/year during

2005-30—broadly in line with gross
domestic product—averaging 1.7%
in 2005-15 and 1.1% in 2015-30. It
would reach 99 million b/d in 2015
and 116 million b/d in 2030, up from
84 million b/d in 2005.

will come from developing countries
where economic growth, the main
driver of oil demand, is highest. Demand rises more slowly in developed,
Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development member countries,
especially in Europe and the Pacific region, but the report notes “the absolute
increase in North America—5.9 million
b/d over the Outlook period—is the
second largest over any region because
it is already by far the largest consumer.”
The share of natural gas also rises,
but grows less than projected in the last
Outlook due to higher prices. However
gas demand grows faster than coal,
which sees the biggest fossil fuel demand increase in absolute terms, but it
does not overtake it before 2030.
The main demand for oil to 2030
will be from the transport sector, which
rose to 47% in 2004 from 35% in
1980. It is projected to increase to 52%
in 2030. Although biofuels are expected
to make a significant contribution to
meeting the sector’s energy needs, their
share by 2030 will reach only 4% as
rising food demand competes for the
needed land. However, points out the
report, new biofuels technology, notably lingo-cellulosic ethanol, could allow
biofuels to play a much larger role.

reach 5 million b/d by 2030.
The oil industry needs to invest $164
billion/year over 2005-30—a total of
$4.3 trillion (in 2005 dollars). Three
quarters of this will go to the upstream,
indicates the Outlook, adding that
upstream investment needs are more
sensitive to changes in decline rates at
producing fields than to the demand
growth rate of oil.
IEA admits there is no guarantee that
all of the investment needed will be
forthcoming, as the possible impact of
government policies, geopolitical factors, unexpected changes in unit costs,
and prices and new technology could
affect the opportunities and incentives
for private and publicly owned companies to invest. IEA considers particularly
uncertain the ability and willingness
of major oil and gas producers to step
up investment in order to meet rising
global demand.
It notes, in this context, that capital
spending by the world’s leading oil and
gas companies increased sharply over
the first half of the current decade and,
under company plans, will rise further
to 2010. But “the impact on new capacity of higher spending is blunted by
rising costs” and was only 5% higher
than in 2000.

Supply sources

In its analysis of oil prices over the
Outlook period, IEA has revised them
upwards in the expectation that crude
oil and refined-product market remains
tight. Market fundamentals point to a
modest easing of prices as new capacity
comes on stream and demand growth
slows. But prices could be driven up by

Oil supply is increasingly dominated
by a small number of major producers
where oil resources are concentrated.
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’s share of global supply
grows to 48% by 2030 from 40% now
and 42% in 2015. Conventional crude
production from non-OPEC countries
peaks by the middle of the next decade,
but natural gas liquids production continues to grow.
Conventional oil accounts for the
lion’s share of the increased oil supply
over the Outlook period, but nonconventional resources—mainly oil sands
in Canada—and, to a lesser extent,
gas-to-liquids plants play a growing
role. Canadian oil sands are projected
to triple to 3 million b/d by 2015 and

Prices

new geopolitical tensions or a major
supply disruption.
The Outlook assumes that the average IEA crude oil import price—$51/
bbl in 2005—will average slightly over
$60/bbl through 2007, then decline to
$47/bbl by 2012. It would rise slowly
thereafter, reaching $50/bbl in 2020
and $55 in 2030. Assuming a 2.3%/
year inflation rate, the price in nominal
terms would reach $97/bbl in 2030.
Natural gas prices should follow this
trend because of inter-fuel competition and the continuing use of oil-price
indexation in long-term gas supply
contracts.
The Outlook, however, noted that oil
demand is becoming less sensitive to
changes in final prices, as consumption
increasingly is concentrated in transport
where demand is the least price-elastic.
Income, which has continued to grow
strongly in most regions, remains the
primary demand driver for oil as well
as other energies.
The result is that oil demand in
global oil consumption becomes less
and less responsive to movements in international crude prices, and this means
prices would fluctuate more than in the
past to future short-term demand and
supply shifts. IEA blames the “cushioning effect” of subsidies to oil consumers
as well as taxes for the insensitivity of
oil demand to higher prices.
However, it is careful to add: “Oil
prices still matter to the world economy,” which would have grown more
rapidly had oil prices and other energy
prices not increased, the impact being
higher on heavily indebted poor countries. ✦

Nigeria group to use ﬂare gas for electricity
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The Kwale partners’ flaring-reduction project will be the first in Nigeria
to use associated natural gas for generating electricity, officials of the International Finance Corp. and World Bank
announced Nov. 10. Nigeria currently

leads the world in reported flared gas.
They said Kwale also would be the
first effort supported by Global Gas
Flaring Reduction (GGFR), a publicprivate partnership to be registered as a
Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)
under the Kyoto global warming reduction accords.

Corrib project
issue persists

emember Shell’s efforts to bring
natural gas to Ireland and efforts
by protestors to stop them? It’s a
while since we’ve looked at that issue, but it’s still in the news, and the
news is not good given the reports
we see (OGJ, Dec. 19, 2005, p. 39).
Now, Ireland’s prime minister, or
taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, has entered
the debate. Last week he said “the
rule of law has to be implemented”
and “the work goes on” at the Corrib
gas terminal at Bellanboy in County
Mayo.
Construction of the terminal and
the route of an onshore pipeline to
bring gas from offshore Corrib field
have been strongly opposed by some
local residents. Indeed, protests had
been staged at the site every day since
Oct. 2, when building resumed after
lengthy consultations and a number
of safety studies.

Police knock heads
Ahern, who was aware that Irish
police had used batons against antiShell demonstrators on Nov. 10,
defended his government’s actions.
“The negotiations are over,” he said.
“The work goes on. If there are those
who try to frustrate that, they are
breaking the law, and it is a matter for
the gardai [police] to enforce that.”
Ahern added, “From the government’s point of view, that’s it.” But
not everyone agrees with that view,
especially Ahern’s political opponents.
The president of Ireland’s Labor
party, Michael D. Higgins, said protestors in the north Mayo community
have “genuine grievances” and in30

sisted that Ahern was “distorting the
facts” in relation to planning approval
for the complete project.
He was one of several people who
criticized the prime minister along
with Justice Minister Michael McDowell for suggesting that the protestors, who operate under the rubric of
the Shell to Sea campaign, have been
infiltrated by Sinn Fein, the political
wing of the militant Irish Republican
Army.

Sinn Fein front?
“Yet again, in an entirely predictable tirade, Michael McDowell is
trying to use the difficulties in Bellanaboy as an excuse to attack Sinn
Fein,” said Vincent Wood, a member
of the Shell to Sea campaign.
“In doing so, he is also misleading
the public,” Wood wrote. “Michael
McDowell claims that the Shell to
Sea campaign is led by Sinn Fein. It
is not. He does not have to take Sinn
Fein’s word for it; he could take a trip
to Mayo and ask the members of the
Shell to Sea group who is running
their campaign.”
Regardless of who is behind the
Shell to Sea campaign, the protest
came as a result of unwillingness to
accept the government’s decision to
move ahead with the project.
That decision came in late October, when Minister for the Marine
Noel Dempsey rejected requests for a
new inquiry into alternative sites for
the terminal, saying there was simply
“no case” for any such inquiry.
Some people just don’t seem to
want to know that. ✦

The partnership was launched at the
World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002 to bring
public and private sector participants
together to reduce gas flaring and
venting. The group will host a forum
on flaring reduction and gas utilization
Dec. 13-15 in Paris to discuss opportunities and technology.
Fewer than 20 countries account for
more than 85% of flared and vented
gas worldwide, according to GGFR
estimates. Most gas is flared because it
can’t be produced or transported economically. Some is disposed of in this
manner for safety reasons at production
sites.
“This doesn’t just involve developing countries,” said Rashad Kaldany,
director of IFC and World Bank’s oil,
gas, mining, and chemicals department
in Washington, DC. “Wells are being
flared in Canada and the US too.” Most
US flaring is at small, state-regulated
onshore wells, he said.
“There also are legislative or regulatory reasons why gas is flared or, worse,
vented in some countries,” he said.
He said that GGFR hopes that the
Kwale project, which is 40% owned
by Nigerian Agip, an affiliate of Italy’s
Eni SPA, and 60% owned by Nigerian
National Petroleum Corp., will stimulate other producing companies and
countries’ interest in using associated
gas to generate electricity or for other
purposes. Kwale’s captured gas will be
used at a combined-cycle power plant
in Okpi.

World leader
Nigeria led with 24.1 billion cu m
(851.08 bcf) of the 107.5 billion cu
m (3.796 tcf) of flared or vented gas
reported worldwide in 2004, the most
recent year for which figures are available, according to GGFR. Russia, which
was second at 14.7 billion cu m (519.1
bcf), could be bigger because its figure
may not be reliable.
Two other projects—a Royal Dutch
Shell PLC gas-to-power venture and a
reinjection effort supported by Eni—are
being considered there as alternatives to

Bent Svensson.
Nigeria’s national power company
hopes more gas-to-power projects will
help its total annual generation ultimately grow to 15 Gw from 2-3 Gw
currently, Svensson said.
But it’s the reduction of global
climate change contributing emissions,
as much as additional available gas, that
could make more flaring-reduction
projects work economically, Svensson
suggested. “This mechanism creates an
additional revenue flow from the sale
of [pollution reduction] credits,” he
explained.
The Kwale project will eliminate a
projected 1.5 million tons of carbon
dioxide annually, making it the 10th
largest of the 2,160 projects in the CDM
pipeline under the Kyoto accords.

DOI completes ﬁrst Colorado oil shale projects’ EIS
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
The US Department of the Interior
found no significant negative impact from
five planned oil shale research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) projects
in Colorado’s Piceance basin.
C. Stephen Allred, assistant Interior
secretary for land and minerals management, signed decision records for the
projects proposed by Chevron USA Inc.,
EGL Resources Inc., and Shell Frontier Oil
& Gas Inc. on Nov. 13, effectively clearing
the way for 160-acre leases associated with
each proposal to be issued.
The Green River oil shale formation,

which covers parts of Colorado, Utah, and
Wyoming, holds the equivalent of 800
billion bbl of recoverable oil, more than
70% of which lies under federally managed lands.
“These RD&D projects will allow us to
test our belief that we have the knowledge
and expertise to develop this resource
effectively, economically, and with responsibility to the environment and to local
communities,” Allred said.
The findings were based on environmental assessments conducted by the
department’s Bureau of Land Management,
which examined each project’s potential
impacts as well as all five projects’ cumula-

tive impacts combined with other oil and
gas developments in the area.
Each finding is supported by extensive
mitigation impacts, which will be added
as stipulations to the leases, DOI officials
said. They added that the companies holding the leases will need to submit detailed
development plans and obtain all required
state, local, and federal permits before
beginning any on-site activities.
Allred said that federal, state, and local
governments and community partners
cooperated during BLM’s environmental
assessments, and added that all stakeholders would continue to play an integral
role as DOI moves forward with oil shale
development. ✦

EIA: GHG emissions up, but growth rate declines
While volumes of greenhouse gases
emitted in the US are rising, the rate of
increase and amounts emitted in relation to economic growth are falling.
In an annual estimate required by
Congress, the US Energy Information
Administration said 2005 emissions of
greenhouse gases associated with human activity totaled 7.1 billion tonnes
of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e).
That’s up 0.6% from the year before
and 17% from 1990 (see table).
Emissions of CO2, the target of most
policy proposals for global-warming
remediation, grew in 2005 at a belowaverage rate of 0.3%. Emissions—adjusted to CO2e to reflect global warm-

ing potential—of nitrous oxide were up
1.9% and of methane, up 0.9%.
CO2 represented 84% of US greenhouse-gas emissions in 2005. Nitrous
oxide and methane together made up
14% of the total. The other greenhouse
gases are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs),
perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur
hexafluoride (SF6), emissions of which
increased by a combined 7.2% in 2005.
Since 1990, US greenhouse gas
emissions have increased at an average rate of 1%/year. EIA notes that the
growth rate is below those of population (1.2%/year), primary energy
consumption (1.1%/year), electric
power generation (1.9%/year), and

gross domestic product (3%/year) over
the same period.
Emissions of CO2 alone have grown
at an average rate of 1.2%/year since
1990, closely tracking growth in
population and energy consumption.
Methane emissions fell during the
1990s but have risen since 2001. Emissions of nitrous oxide are above their
levels of 1990 but have fluctuated over
the period.
Greenhouse gas intensity—emissions
per unit of real economic output—has
fallen by 25% since 1990 at a rate averaging 1.9%/year, EIA said. CO2 intensity
has fallen by 23% over the same period.
CO2 emissions per person in 2005
were 1% above their
1990 level. The 2005
CO2 emissions total

Shell-Shell Canada
Shell Canada has a substantial
position in Canada’s oil sands and is
embarking on a major expansion of
production and upgrading capacity.
“Canada is an important growth area
for the group, and the group will be
a major investor in Canada for many
years to come,” Shell said.
The group offered $40/share (Can.)
38

or $7.7 billion. The proposal follows
corporate structural changes Shell took
after a series of reserves reclassifications.
Once Shell Canada is fully combined
with the group, the business will have a
more simplified organization, the group
said.
Structural changes came after the
company reclassified reserves five times
in a little over a year (OGJ Online, Feb.
4, 2005). Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.
and Shell Transport & Trading Co. were
merged into a single parent, Royal
Dutch Shell, the stock of which began
trading July 20, 2005.
Shareholders approved the unification formally combining the former
Royal Dutch/Shell Group’s British and
Dutch parent companies under a single
board and a single executive (OGJ Online, Oct. 28, 2004). Investors had said
the old structure hindered transparency
and financial accountability.
In July, Shell Canada announced
plans to increase production in the
Athabasca tar sands project in Alberta to
550,000 b/d from 150,000 b/d.
Alberta’s oil sands contain an estimated 1.69 trillion bbl of bitumen and the
produced 5 trillion bbl through 2005.
Shell Canada intends to announce a final
investment decision for this expansion
project in the fourth quarter pending
regulatory approvals. Bitumen production is expected in late 2009 followed by
upgrader production in late 2010.
The group asked Shell Canada to
establish a special independent committee to supervise preparation of a formal
independent valuation and to review
and make a recommendation regarding
the proposed offer. The group reserves
the right not to proceed with the making of an offer if it is unable to obtain
this support. A formal offer will be
conditional on more than 50% of Shell
Canada’s outstanding shares, calculated
on a fully diluted basis, being tendered.

Genghis Khan sale
BHP Billiton leads the Shenzi group
with 44% interest and will be the
operator. Partners are Hess Corp. and
Repsol YPF SA, each with 28%. These

three companies already own adjacent
Shenzi field.
The Genghis Khan sale involves a
100% stake in Green Canyon Block
652 and certain deep rights in Green
Canyon Block 608. The sale is expected
to close in the fourth quarter.
The development has gross hydrocarbon reserves of 65-170 million boe,
BHP said Nov. 13. Development may
include as many as seven production
wells, and production is scheduled for
mid-2007 with continued drilling to
follow.
The Genghis Khan well, drilled to
26,000 ft TD in 4,300 ft of water, tested
110 ft of high-quality net oil pay in the
Lower Miocene and additional pay in
the Middle Miocene. Production plans
call for a subsea tieback to the Marco
Polo platform, 2.4 miles away (OGJ,
May 5, 2005, Newsletter).
The divestiture is part of Anadarko’s
efforts to help raise $15 billion to reduce debt from its $21 billion purchases of Kerr-McGee Corp., Oklahoma City,
and Western Gas Resources Inc., Denver
(OGJ, July 10, 2006, p. 27).

Statoil buys GOM prospects
Statoil plans to acquire 25% interest
in the Knotty Head discovery, operated
by Nexen Inc., Calgary, and 15% interest in the Big Foot discovery, operated
by Chevron Corp. Statoil already had
12.5% interest in Big Foot.
In addition, Statoil is acquiring a
15% stake in the Big Foot North prospect from Anadarko. Chevron operates
Big Foot North, in which Statoil already
has a 12.5% stake.
Earlier this year Statoil acquired
interests in Big Foot and Big Foot North
from Plains Exploration & Production
Co. (OGJ Online, Sept. 18, 2006).
The Big Foot discovery, on Walker
Ridge Block 29, lies in 5,000 ft of water
about 225 miles south of New Orleans
(OGJ, Aug. 7, 2006, Newsletter).
The Knotty Head oil discovery is on
Green Canyon Block 512 and found
about 600 ft of net oil pay in multiple
zones (OGJ, Jan. 2, 2006, Newsletter).

and Knotty Head are expected to be in
production after 2010, Statoil said.

Dominion divestiture
Dominion plans to keep its Appalachian basin properties, which account
for 17% of its proved reserves and 8%
of its average daily production as of
Sept. 30. About 76% of the reserves
are developed, and about 76% of the
reserves are gas.
A formal sales process is scheduled to begin in February 2007 after
completion of the 2006 reserve audit.
Closing is expected by mid-2007,
Dominion said. The E&P assets are
managed by Dominion Exploration &
Production Inc., Houston.
Excluding the Appalachian basin,
Dominion has proved reserves of 5.5
tcf equivalent of gas spread across the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico, West Texas,
the Midcontinent and Rockies, and the
Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin.

Devon divestiture

Pogo divestiture

Devon did not announce an expected
sale price. It plans to open data rooms
in Houston and London during December. Acceptance of bids and completion
of a purchase and sale agreement are
anticipated during first quarter 2007.
The company’s Egyptian production is 5,000 boe/d, less than 1% of
both the company’s total production
and proved reserves.
The assets to be offered include interests in eight concessions, four in the
Western Desert and four in the Gulf of
Suez. Four of the concessions are producing. The concessions comprise 3.7
million gross (1.8 million net) acres.
The Oklahoma City-based independent obtained the assets through
the $5.3 billion acquisition of Ocean
Energy Inc., Houston (OGJ, Mar. 3,
2003, p. 31).

Pogo expects $700-800 million in
proceeds from the asset sales, and the
company plans to use the proceeds to
reduce debt. The divestitures are slated
for completion in two phases.
The first phase, including the Gulf of
Mexico, South and East Texas, and South
Louisiana, is expected to close by the
end of first quarter 2007. Production
from these properties is estimated at 37
MMcfd of gas equivalent.
The second phase, covering properties in the Permian basin, the Texas Panhandle, and western Canada, is expected
to be completed by midyear.

EPL-Stone deal off
EPL has agreed to pay Stone $8 million in exchange for Stone’s agreeing
to release all claims against it. The sum
represents a $17.6 million discount
from the fee EPL would have been
obligated to pay Stone under certain
circumstances.
In September Woodside Petroleum
Ltd.’s wholly owned subsidiary ATS Inc.
began an $880 million tender offer for
EPL in a takeover bid.
The offer from ATS, Covington, La.,
is conditional upon EPL shareholders’
voting down the Stone transaction. EPL
has proposed to buy Stone for $2 billion, which includes $1.43 billion in a
cash-stock offer, plus $563 million in
debt (OGJ, June 12, 2006, p. 34).
In an Oct. 12 statement, however,
EPL said its board has decided to explore strategic alternatives, and it recommends that EPL stockholders reject
the unsolicited tender offer of ATS, saying the offer is “inadequate and not in
the best interests of EPL’s stockholders.”

and regulatory approval, is expected to
close Jan. 2, 2007.
Both companies’ boards already approved the transaction. Each partnership
will have a management committee
with three ConocoPhillips and three
EnCana representatives. Each parent
company will hold equal voting rights.
“With this strategic alliance, ConocoPhillips strengthens its presence in
North America by repositioning 10% of
its US downstream business to access a
large upstream resource base,” said Jim
Mulva, ConocoPhillips chairman and
chief executive officer.
Randy Eresman, EnCana’s president
and chief executive officer, said his
company had been looking for a partner to maximize the value of EnCana’s
in-situ oil sands.
“These innovative partnerships
achieve this objective by strategically aligning about two thirds of our
industry-leading oil sands projects with
an industry-leading refiner,” Eresman
said. “ConocoPhillips brings a wealth of
heavy oil refining expertise and widely
adopted coking technology to our integrated heavy oil business.”
The upstream partnership involves
EnCana’s Foster Creek and Christina Lake
projects in the eastern flank of the Athabasca oil sands in northeast Alberta, having recoverable bitumen of more than
6.5 billion bbl. EnCana will operate and
be the managing partner of the upstream
partnership, to be based in Calgary.
The partnership plans to increase
production to 400,000 b/d of bitumen
by 2015 from current production of
50,000 b/d. A blend of 50-50 bitumen
and synthetic oil will be sold at major
Alberta trading hubs.
The downstream partnership
involves ConocoPhillips’s 306,000
b/cd Wood River refinery in Roxana,
Ill., and its 146,000 b/cd refinery in
Borger, Tex. ConocoPhillips will operate and be managing partner of the
downstream partnership, to be based
in Houston.The partnership plans to
expand heavy oil processing capacity
at these facilities to 550,000 b/d by
2015 from 60,000 b/d. Total through42

put at the two facilities is expected
to increase to 600,000 b/d from the
current 450,000 b/d during the same
period.
In addition, the partnership might
additionally expand heavy oil processing capacity at these locations or in
Alberta to match bitumen production.
ConocoPhillips and EnCana each will
own 50% of the partnership; however,
ConocoPhillips will hold a disproportionate economic interest in the Borger
refinery for 2 years: 85% in 2007 and
65% in 2008.

Chaparral-Calumet deal
Chaparral of Oklahoma City said the
acquisition fits with its existing enhanced oil recovery program. Calumet’s
properties are mainly in Oklahoma and
Texas, including assets in the North
Burbank oil field.
North Burbank is in the early phases
of an EOR polymer flood. Chaparral
plans to include carbon dioxide injection, return more than 400 wells to
production, and perform horizontal
infill drilling in the tighter portion of
the Bartlesville reservoir.
The transaction is expected to close
in the fourth quarter.

Lukoil-Turgai deal
Turgai Petroleum’s primary asset is
Kumkol field in the Kyzylorda region.
Arbitrators ruled in Lukoil’s favor
in a counter-claim it filed following
PetroKazakhstan Inc.’s July 2004 claim
against Lukoil.
Previously, Chinese National Petroleum Corp. acquired 100% of PetroKazakhstan Inc., which owns a stake
in Turgai Petroleum. A shareholders
agreement was violated because Lukoil
was not asked whether it wanted to
exercise its pre-emptive right to a stake
in Turgai before CNPC bought PetroKazakhstan.
An independent expert will determine the price, which then must be approved by both CNPC and Lukoil. Failing
an agreement on the price, the Stockholm Arbitration will appoint a price.

Brazil’s state-owned company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) has big
development plans for the Santos basin.
The Santos Basin Business Unit’s
master plan calls for $18 billion in
investment in the next 10 years.
The production goals for 2010-11
are 1.05 bcfd of gas and 100,000 b/d
of oil, compared with 42 MMcfd and
10,000 b/d at present. The projected
1.05 bcfd is slightly more than the 990
MMcfd of gas Brazil now imports from
Bolivia.
Of the Santos basin’s 352,000 sq km,
43% is in water as deep as 1,300 ft and
57% is in 1,300-10,000 ft of water.
Twenty-five percent of the concession
areas Petrobras holds in Brazil are in
the Santos basin. Petrobras and partners
hold 11.5% of the basin’s acreage.
Of the total area under concession,
52% lies off Sao Paulo state, 35% is off
Rio de Janeiro, 7% is off Santa Catarina,
and 6% is off Parana.
All indications are that the basin is
only lightly explored, and the most

recent discovery in its deepwater sector
led some officials to speculate that the
so far gas prone basin’s subsalt realm
might become another Campos basin in
terms of ultimate recovery.

Production poles
Petrobras describes five production
poles, two of which are producing now
and three more that will come into production in the
next several
years (OGJ,
Aug. 28, 2006,
p. 25). The five
poles are:

Mexilhao.
• Merluza field, discovered in 1979
and producing gas-condensate since
1992, is making 42 MMcfd of gas and
1,600 b/d of condensate. Gas output is
to climb to 88 MMcfd in 2008 when
the platform begins accepting gas from
nearby Lagosta field and from the SPS25 well area. Installation of a second
platform could boost gas handling
capacity to 350 MMcfd by 2010.
Merluza-Lagosta and Mexilhao-Cedro
will be connected to a $300 million gas
treatment plant at Caraguatatuba. The
plant would have two units with capacities of 265 MMcfd each, and could be
expanded to 800 MMcfd.
• Urugua and Tambau fields would
anchor another production pole at
Block BS-500 about 100 miles off Rio
de Janeiro. Production there is estimated at 150,000-200,000 b/d of

Oil and NGL
Oil reserves declined in Alaska and
the Gulf of Mexico federal offshore and
increased in Texas and California.
The oil reserves figures do not
include volumes in large deepwater discoveries that have been made in recent
years in the gulf and are not yet booked
(OGJ, Sept. 25, 2006, p. 36).
Texas, Wyoming, and Montana were
the top three states with Lower 48 oil
reserves increases.
Extensions to existing oil fields in
2005 added 805 million bbl of reserves,
30% more than in 2004 and 53% more
than the prior 10-year average. Most of
the reserves increases from extensions

Oil production was lower in the gulf
and in Alaska. Rocky Mountain states
generally had gains, with Montana

New record investments in a deepwater

of a new refinery signal
continuing belief in Canada’s maritime
basins.
Chevron Canada Resources is now
drilling the most expensive well to-date
in Atlantic Canada, a deepwater wildcat
off Newfoundland in the untested East
Orphan basin.
Presentations at the recent Canadian Offshore Resources conference
in Halifax, NS, and the Atlantic Canada
Energy Summit in St. John, NB, suggest
that local firms will need to ramp-up
operations to handle upcoming oil, gas,
and power project requirements. More
than 300 firms attended a procurement
session on EnCana Corp.’s Deep Panuke
project.
Canada is wrestling with the challenge of attracting financial capital to
untested basins. Although there is large
potential, there is also more inherent
risk. Operators continue to pour capital
into projects designed to maximize the
value of old, depleted fields, or explore
for new reservoirs in well-drilled basins.
In 2002, Thomas S. Ahlbrandt classified the conventional natural gas
reserves of Atlantic Canada in the same
range as the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin and offshore Brazil, thought to
contain 6-120 tcf. Ahlbrandt expected
1-20 billion bbl of conventional oil off
eastern Canada, akin to reserves in the
WCSB and northwest Australia.1

Helicopter Corp. opened a new $4
million heliport at the Halifax International Airport, including a 26,000 sq ft
hanger for four helicopters. CHC was
flying two helicopters to GlobalSantaFe
Corp.’s GSF Galaxy II jack up most of
this year, according to CHC regional
director Barry Clouter.
The rig finished drilling ExxonMobil
Canada’s Alma-3 development well in
March but has remained on location
at the Thebaud platform, serving as
the accommodations module during
work on the new compression facilities.
GlobalSantaFe reported on Oct. 6 that
the Galaxy II contract with ExxonMobil, at about $125,000/day, will finish
48

mid-November, followed by a 3-week
contract at $300,000/day before the rig
moves to the North Sea.
Thebaud’s 7,600-tonne compression
platform, which arrived from Europe
this past summer aboard the Saipem
7000 heavy lift vessel, has been installed
next to the Thebaud central processing
platform. The 8-leg jacket was built at
Saipem Energy International’s Intermare
Sarda division in Sardinia, Italy, and sent
by barge to Rotterdam. Daewoo built
the topsides and SIF Group BV fabricated the piles.

Deep Panuke
The Deep Panuke gas field discov-

ery was announced in 2000, after
four wells were drilled about 250 km
southeast of Halifax, 1998-2000. An
environmental review completed in December 2002 concluded that the project
is unlikely to cause significant adverse
environmental effects.
In January 2006, EnCana selected
the mobile offshore production unit
concept and will probably lease a jack
up to serve as the platform, capable of
processing 300 MMcfd (down from
400 MMcfd initially proposed) over 13
years. The company plans to award the
MOPU contract by late 2007.
EnCana signed the Deep Panuke

In mid-August, EnCana held a procurement session in Halifax to discuss
Deep Panuke with potential service companies and contractors, and announced a
new initiative to build land drilling rigs
in Nova Scotia (OGJ, Sept. 18, 2006, p.
48).
A few weeks later, EnCana filed the
project description for Deep Panuke,
triggering the start of the environmental assessment process (under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act).
Dave Kopperson, Encana vice-president for Atlantic Canada, said in a presentation at CORE.06 that the company
plans to drill five to eight gas production wells to 3,600-4,000 m, as well as
an acid-gas disposal well. The project

likely to affect drilling plans in western
Canada than off the east coast.
RBC Capital Markets analyst Angelo
Guo said in September, “we expect to
see a widespread reduction in gas drilling into 2007 before things turn better
in late 2007 or 2008.”
Sable’s asset manager Janke said that
operators will focus on efficiency and
cost reduction for all projects and that
creativity is necessary to maintain the momentum in Atlantic Canada. He said it’s
important to maintain infrastructure “or
else the economics of the smaller offshore
fields will be untenable.” Janke stressed
the government’s role in providing an efficient, value-added regulatory system.
Rowan’s chairman and CEO Danny
McNeese noted that although there is very
light drilling scheduled off Canada for
2007, he hopes for more activity in 2008,
adding that “200 Canadians work for
Rowan.”
CORE.06 Chair Tom Hickey said,
“Decisions taken now will significantly
influence the nature and state of the
industry to come.” ✦

Shell’s interest in enhanced oil recovery grows
As easy oil becomes more difficult
to find and produce, Royal Dutch Shell
PLC sees enhanced oil recovery (EOR)
contributing more to the world’s growing energy needs.
Primary and secondary production
methods leave about two thirds of oil in
the ground, said John Barry, vice-president for unconventionals and EOR for

Shell, in a recent webcast. EOR methods
could produce some of this oil.
Barry estimated that the world’s
existing oil fields might produce more
than 500 billion bbl of oil with EOR
methods that recover an additional 10%
of the original oil in place.
Barry said Shell has more than 30
years of experiences in EOR processes

that include:
• Reducing the viscosity contrast between
oil and water with steam
injection. Heat added
Production
to the reservoir reduces
the oil viscosity, thereby
allowing it to flow easier.
• Reducing the surface tension
between oil and other fluids in the
reservoir by injecting surfactants or a
solvent such as carbon dioxide, thereby
allowing the oil to be swept easier from
the reservoir.
Barry said by 2030, EOR methods
may account for about 10-15% of
Shell’s oil production.

Steam projects
Shell’s EOR holdings include a 52%
interest in AERA Energy LLC, which operates several steamfloods in California
that produce about 100,000 b/d of oil
(EOR survey OGJ, Apr. 17, 2006, p. 47).
South Belridge is AERA’s largest operation, recovering about 38,000 bo/d
with steam injection.
South Belridge first started producing in the 1940s with steam injection
starting in the 1960s. Barry noted
that the field is an example of “how
long-term continuous application of
emerging technologies and operational
efficiency can maintain profitable EOR
production.”
In South Belridge, AERA has adopted
a Toyota-like approach in its operations
that are more commonly associated
with manufacturing than the traditional
oil industry. The approach allows AERA
to drill about 800 wells/year in the
field while maintaining very competitive operating costs, Barry said.
Also Shell Canada Ltd. operates thermal oil recovery projects in the Peace
River area of Alberta. For many years,
Shell has investigated many methods
for economically producing the highly
viscous, 7 billion bbl in place resource
on its leases in Peach River (Fig. 1); but

to date, it has recovered only a small
amount of this oil, about 50 million
bbl, Barry said.
To improve the economics for
producing more oil from this resource,
Shell has started using such technologies as time-lapsed seismic, tilt meters,
and microseismic to detect where the
injected steam goes (Fig 2).
Tilt meters can detect changes on
the surface of only a few millimeters
as injected steam heats the subsurface
formations, while microseismic uses
downhole geophones to listen to the
events created by the injected steam.
The small noises from rock and sand
grains moving around and readjusting in response to heating can indicate
the direction in which steam advances
through the reservoir
These technologies provide Shell a
better understanding of how to inject
steam efficiently and will lead to expanding the production from the area,
Barry said.
Shell also is involved with Petroleum
Development Oman (PDO) in starting a
steamflood in the fractured carbonate in
Qarn Alam field. Most previous steamfloods have been in sandstones.
The viscous 220-cp oil in the field is
mostly in the matrix that is surrounded
by fractures. The field currently produces under gravity drainage that is a slow
process. PDO fills the fractures with gas
and the oil gradually flows from the
matrix into the fractures.
By injecting steam in the fractures,
PDO expects to lower the oil viscosity
by a factor of about 100 to accelerate
oil flow (Fig. 3). Barry said the field’s
oil recovery factor should increase to
20-25% from the current 2-3% estimate.

Polymer injection
Another project in Oman will inject
polymer and surfactant to enhance oil
recovery in Marmul field. Barry said a
pilot in the 1980s showed the effectiveness of polymer injection to increase oil
recovery, but low oil prices forestalled
the project’s start-up. Now that the
project has been dusted off, PDO plans

a 27-well development, he said.
Marmul has slightly less viscous
oil than Qarn Alam and its Al-Qalata
reservoir has had water injected for
several years. In the 1980s, a pilot in the
Al-Qalata injected water viscosified with
a polymer.
Fig. 4 shows the increased crude oil
cut toward yearend 1986 in the four
wells around the central injector. Barry
said at that time oil prices decreased to
less than $10/bbl and PDO deferred the
project.
In the new project, PDO plans to
start polymer injections on the field’s
flanks and then as soon as possible start
injecting surfactants with polymer to
reduce oil saturation. PDO expects to
recover about 10% of the trapped oil
from the field, Barry said.

Ltd. currently operates the CO2 flood in
the unit.
Barry said Shell and Statoil ASA have
announcement a CO2 feasibility study
on the Halten project off Norway (Fig.
6). Unlike the Denver City unit that uses
naturally occurring CO2, a power station built in Tjeldbergodden will supply
CO2 for the Hatten project.
Barry estimates that the Tjeldbergodden power plant will generate a little
more than 2 million tonnes/year of
CO2, which than will be injected in
offshore Draugen field to increase oil
production. Later the CO2 also may go
to the Heidrun field further offshore.
Preliminary studies show that CO2
injection will increase oil recovery from
the field by several percent, or about 50
million bbl, he said. ✦

Carbon dioxide
Shell was a pioneer in developing
miscible CO2 flooding in the Permian
basin of West Texas. Its Denver City unit
is a good example of the technology’s
effectiveness (Fig. 5). Shell no longer
operates the flood, but CO2 flooding
continues to produce an estimated
29,000 bo/d from the unit (OGJ, Apr.
17, 2006, p. 49). Occidental Permian

The US petrochemical
business is experiencing
a lower level of growth

due to lost manufacturing or “deindustriPetrochemicals

situation is more prevalent during each down cycle, when
downstream manufacturing moves into
other countries even faster. Less demand
causes lower
profits and, in
turn, the shutting down of
finished-goods
plants in the
US.
Suppliers
in lower-cost regions pick up the slack

STUDY METHODOLOGY

Accenture Research developed a high-level approach to identifying the value of chemicals
in lost manufacturing. Building on the American Chemistry Council’s (ACC) historical analysis
of “Chemistry Sales by Industry” from the Guide to the Business of Chemistry–2005,
we identiﬁed 17 relevant manufacturing sectors for analysis. Applying ACC’s chemical use
factors to Global Insight Inc.’s industrial production forecasts allowed us to identify future
chemical use for each market.
Production forecasts alone, however, do not represent total domestic market potential for
local producers. The total domestic market potential subtracts exports and adds imports.
Accenture Research identiﬁed historic product imports and exports for each segment
and calculated historic total consumption in each market. Total consumption represents the
amount of any product that is being purchased in the US, sourced either through imports or
domestic production.
We then correlated historic consumption for each market to Global Insight Inc.’s broader
economic assumptions. The resulting consumption forecast, per market, also represents
the total market potential for domestic producers in each respective market and serves as
a baseline from which to measure lost or gained manufacturing (or domestic market share
changes).
The difference between this forecast consumption and Global Insights Inc.’s production
forecasts equals “net trade,” which, when negative, is called “lost manufacturing.”
The lost manufacturing (sales) results were used to calculate, on the basis of historical
relationships, the impact on research and development spending, capital expenditures,
employment, and other values. Accenture Research also conducted interviews with industry
experts in chemical companies, plastics processors, and other organizations to collect relevant facts and opinions to ensure the integrity of the study. Market sectors covered in the
study include:

same time, China increased its imports
of the same derivatives by 50%, as it
gained market share in the downstream
finished goods market using those materials (Fig. 1).
At that time, petrochemical producers took various reactive measures,
such as shutting down high-cost plants.
US producers must anticipate the next
step change in lost manufacturing and
proactively improve their businesses, as
well as support legislation that favors
free and competitive markets (especially
for energy development).
These are some of the conclusions
of a study conducted by Accenture
Research for the American Chemistry
Council (ACC), entitled “Lost US manufacturing—the impact on the business
of chemistry” (www.americanchemis________________
try.com/store).
_________

Study overview
Our study for the ACC quantified
the impact of lost downstream manufacturing (of 17 selected industries)
on the future chemical industry. The
study concluded that domestic demand
for manufactured goods will outpace
domestic industrial production; imports
will fill this gap.
See the attached box for the study’s
methodology.
Although domestic production of
finished goods will still increase, imports will rise faster. This implies that
US manufacturers will lose market share
and, therefore, chemicals manufacturers will lose the demand for chemicals
associated with manufacturing these
products (Fig. 2).
Total chemical sales-opportunity
losses represent just 2.4% of the expected $8 trillion total manufacturing
industry sales-opportunity losses (or
cumulative net trade losses by 2015)
caused by lost manufacturing.
Estimated cumulative opportunity
losses (based on trade losses) during
the next 10 years include:
• $188 billion in chemical sales,
including $50 billion in sales from the
top seven thermoplastic resins.
• $40 billion in capital expenditures

Asia, China in particular, has a cascade
effect on those industries supplying
industrial users, especially raw material
manufacturers.
As a large supplier to other industries, the petrochemicals industry is
one of the businesses most seriously
affected by this trend.
Besides relatively higher labor and
regulatory costs in the US, high energy
prices are contributing to the decline
of US industrial production. High and
volatile US natural gas prices and unreliable supplies affect electricity costs
and, in the case of chemicals, raw material costs as well (Fig. 3).
Volatility also causes uncertainty in
production planning and volume expansion. Energy is the largest input factor for most base chemicals; therefore,
reliable, low-cost energy supplies are
critical to ensuring chemical industry
competitiveness.
Chemicals and energy represent
10% of the costs of the 17 industries
analyzed in this study (Table 1). Because
these industries have total revenues
of nearly $4 trillion, it is imperative
that the US chemical industry remains
viable. Making hydrocarbons available
at competitive prices and encouraging
legislation that favors domestic chemicals investment would go a long way to
ensuring the industry’s future.

domestically (Table 2). The associated
losses in new thermoplastic resin plant
investments are about $5.5 billion.
Thermoplastics consumed in industries
that are easily moved “offshore” (such
as consumer products or furniture production) will suffer the most.
The study also concluded (based on
Accenture Research discussions with
plastics processors accounting for up
to $3.5 billion in sales) that, although
lower labor costs in other regions have
drawn labor-intensive manufacturing
away from the US, the downstream
industry has been engaged in development of highly innovative and leading
practices, resulting in new products,
process improvements, and supply
chain enhancements just to stay in business.
They are working against increasing cost pressures in transportation and
plant direct costs, many of which are
related to rising energy prices. This may
dampen the competitive edge they have
achieved through technological innovation. For steam cracker operators, this
means eventual erosion of downstream
markets for derivatives.

Oleﬁns production effects
Some 65% of US ethylene production capacity is based on natural gas
feed. Most European and Asian ethylene
production, in contrast, is based on
liquids that are related to oil prices. The
correlation of gas prices to oil prices,
therefore, directly affects US ethylene
operating rates and profitability.
Relatively higher gas prices can reduce the competitiveness of US ethylene production (in aggregate, because
some plants are liquids-based or have
some feed flexibility). A low, steady
gas-to-oil price ratio is critical to maintaining the US competitive position in
ethylene and its related derivatives and
coproducts or by-products.
To date, no greenfield ethylene (the
most important base organic chemical)
plants are scheduled for completion in
the continental US. US domestic producers are reluctant to invest because of
uncertainty surrounding environmental

There must be a strategic shift from the

a deep understanding of a customer’s

Some tools rising in importance in

Historical data can help develop surrogate cost estimates for pipeline construction, potentially replacing a more
costly full engineering study.
A complete engineering package
likely provides the best cost estimate,
but such packages are expensive and
sometimes this investment is unwarranted. And even with such an effort,
construction surprises, delays, and
shortages of materials or
labor can still add unexpected costs.
Uncertainty surrounds
any advance estimate of
pipeline construction
costs. But the ability to
calculate reasonably accurate cost estimates for large pipeline
projects without the cost of an engineering effort can help in decision
making both in terms of policy and
regulatory processes. Such calculations
may also serve as a screening criterion

for prospective projects. Table 1 provides publicly available cost estimates
for a variety of currently discussed
pipeline projects.
The database of natural gas pipeline
construction-permit application filings
of the US Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) provides a useful
source of both historical and forecast
data. Rigorous engineering efforts typically provide the basis for these filings,
making them usable for deriving average estimates of construction costs and
providing a basis for cost projection of
future pipeline projects.
These data provided the basis for a
surrogate to estimate construction costs
for large-diameter natural gas pipelines.
Recent filings have the added benefit
of capturing recent trends in construction costs. The structure of construction
costs, however, can evolve rapidly. Preconstruction filing data can also differ
from actual costs.

considered when evaluating the economics of a major pipeline project.
Because projects as large as the Alaska
natural gas pipeline are few, a track
record of cost estimation and actual
construction costs is not readily available. Other pipeline projects, however,
can serve as analogs for estimating
the potential for and extent of cost
overruns. For example, the BP-operated Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline cost
nearly $3 billion. Cost overruns totaled
an estimated $1 billion, or 33% of the
overall project cost.
Costs for the Shell-led Sakhalin
Energy Investment Co. Ltd.’s Sakhalin
II project, with similar weather conditions to Alaska (but also with offshore
upstream facilities), have grown to an
estimated $20 billion from $10 billion: a 100% cost overrun. Many other
examples of mega-projects exist with
considerable cost overruns.
It is doubtful costs for the Alaska
natural gas pipeline can fall below the
mean estimated cost example. Cost
overruns, however, have no predefined
limit other than those set in advance by
the developers.

calibrate our technique. Comparison
with older but comparable data sets
could also be done to develop cost-escalation models.
The construction-cost models illustrated here by FERC data can provide
estimates of natural gas pipeline costs
in other regions of the world, so long
as the distinction can be made between
challenging and higher cost projects
and more routine pipeline projects,
suggesting that the cost structure for
large natural gas pipeline projects
reflects global (rather than regional or
local) prices of materials, engineering
and construction, capital, and other
variables, especially for the largest projects. ✦

Drilling, completion software can be shared among users
Newly released PetrisWINDS DrillNET
is an advanced drilling and completion
engineering software framework that
combines capabilities of Maurer drilling
programs into one easy-to-use, integrated
package that permits data to be captured,
reused, and shared among users.
The software’s intuitive user interface
and integrated database are coupled with
context-sensitive help and a novel traffic
light approach to check that all data are
complete for a calculation. Output reports
can be generated from the results, and the
data exported to Microsoft Office products.
Additionally, DrillNET is available in multiple languages, including English, Russian,
Spanish, and Chinese, and can be configured for each user to allow the use of one
language for the program operation and
another one for report generation.
DrillNET allows a user to focus on the
specific drilling program of interest and
does not require that data for the entire
well be present to run the calculations. It

allows users to models various outcomes
based upon variations in inputs using the
intuitive user interface for quick assessments on potential program outcomes
using data from drilling operations in real
time.

New engine cylinder lubricating system
The pulse lubricating system (PLS) is
a new, electronically controlled cylinder
lubricating system to meet the demand for
lower cylinder oil feed rates.
Developed for application in RTA and
RT-flex low-speed marine diesel engines, it
delivers reduced cylinder oil consumption
without compromising piston-running
reliability, the company says.
PLS helps make it possible to reduce the
cylinder oil feed rate compared with the
existing accumulator system through an
improved distribution of cylinder lubricating oil to the cylinder liner, and the fully

flexible, precise timing of oil delivery.
The guide feed rate for RTA and RT-flex
engines equipped with PLS as original
equipment is 0.7 g/kw-hr of cylinder
lubricating oil. The system promises to
deliver accurately metered, load-dependent
volumes of lubricating oil to the cylinder
liner running surface at the precise timing
required. Electronic control helps ensure
the accurate dosage and timing, with full
flexibility in settings.
The cylinder lubricating oil is sprayed
as a pulse of multiple jets on to the liner
surface from a single row of lubricators
arranged around the liner, each lubricator having a number of nozzle holes. The
oil jet sprays ensure better distribution of
the oil over the liner running surface than
with the existing accumulator system,
the firm points out. There is no atomization and no loss of lubricating oil to the
scavenge air.

From the Subscribers Only area of

Republicans let
federal subsidy
programs multiply
Part of the reason the Republican Party
lost control of Congress on Nov. 7 is that
too many of its incumbents abandoned
their principles.
Republicans once championed limits
on government. In power, though, they
expanded the role of the state, too often to
dispense political favors.
Chris Edwards, director of tax policy
studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, last

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

month reported a revealing measure of this
malpractice.
He assembled data on federal subsidy
programs from a government periodical
called the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
He found 1,696 subsidy programs in the
federal budget this year. The number lately
has zoomed. In 2000 it was 1,425. In 1990 it
was 1,176; in 1980, 1,123; in 1970, 1,019.
“In recent years, the scope of federal
control over society has widened as politicians of both parties have favored nationalizing many formerly state, local, and private
activities,” Edwards observes.
Energy is one of two federal agencies
for which the number of subsidy programs
fell during 1996-2000, dropping by 11 to 27.
Subsidy programs in the Department of
Education fell by 6 during the period to 146.
But subsidies and incentives in the tax
code, as opposed to agency programs,
increased in both areas.
“The number of energy incentives in the
income tax code increased from 9 in 1990
to 26 by 2006,” Edwards points out.
Big department gainers in subsidy
programs during 1996-2000 were Interior,
up 88 to 134; Agriculture, up 78 to 198; and
Health and Human Services, up 77 to 334.
“As time has passed, more farm crops
are receiving federal subsidies, more local
police services are being paid for with
federal grants, and more cradle-to-grave
health services are being created by Congress,” Edwards says.
The trend, he argues, violates the constitutional principle of federalism, which aims
to limit the reach of the federal government
into state, local, and private affairs.
It also represents an institutional
breech of faith by Republicans. Democrats
shouldn’t misinterpret their victory as
a sign of popular craving for exuberant
governance.
Americans don’t seem any less wary
of Big Government than ever. Republicans
learned that lesson the hard way.

by Paula Dittrick, Senior Staff Writer

Crude prices dip on IEA demand forecast
Energy prices on futures markets have swung widely recently.
Comments about possible additional production quota cuts by the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries drove prices higher on Nov. 6. But later in the
week, the International Energy Agency cut its world oil demand growth estimates,
and prices dropped.
The December contract for benchmark US sweet, light crudes increased $1.33/bbl
on Nov. 9 on the New York Mercantile Exchange to $61.16/bbl—the highest frontmonth price in 2 weeks.
But oil prices retreated Nov. 10 after release of the IEA’s monthly report in which
it trimmed its 2006 global oil demand growth to 1.1%, or an average of 84.5 million
b/d, from its previous forecast of 1.2% oil demand growth. EIA kept its 2007 demand
growth forecast at 1.7%.
The IEA estimate of oil inventories in Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development member countries was high, representing 55 days of forward demand
cover. Analysts said this was the highest ﬁgure for the third quarter since 1991.
On Nov. 6, the December NYMEX crude contract broke above $60/bbl for the ﬁrst time
in days, settling at $60.02/bbl after Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said OPEC was likely to
trim production if global inventories remain “very high” when the cartel meets Dec. 14.
Separately, Qatari Oil Minister Abdullah al-Attiyah said markets were oversupplied. “If the market is still unbalanced, we will make another cut, but I cannot
predict what the quantity will be,” he told Reuters.
On Nov. 7, OPEC Pres. and Nigerian Oil Minister Edmund Daukoru told reporters
that the cartel has no target price band.
“OPEC doesn’t have a rigid ﬂoor,” Daukoru said during a visit to South Korea. Setting a target price band “is not really applicable to the ﬂuid, free market,” he added.
Crude prices fell $1.09 to $58.93/bbl Nov. 7, wiping out gains from the previous
market session. Traders said they were unsure whether OPEC would cut production.
Meanwhile, the US Energy Information Administration said Nov. 8 that commercial US crude inventories inched up by 400,000 bbl to 334.7 million bbl during the
week ended Nov. 3.
US gasoline stocks declined by 600,000 bbl to 204 million bbl during the same
period. Distillate fuel inventories dropped 2.7 million bbl to 138.6 million bbl, with a
slight increase in heating oil offset by a slump in conventional diesel fuel.
“US oil inventories have fallen heavily relative to their 5-year average for a fourth
straight week, bringing the total fall over that period up to 32.5 million bbl or more
than 1.1 million b/d,” said Paul Horsnell at Barclays Capital Inc., London.
“Gasoline has tightened the fastest, together with diesel. With both gasoline and
diesel demand posting strong numbers for October and starting November well, the
worries about falling oil demand from a slowing economy do seem to be very horribly wide of the mark,” Horsnell said.
US imports of crude fell by 306,000 b/d to 9.8 million b/d during the week ended Nov. 3.
A Nov. 8 report from the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc.
said high seas from several storm systems made conditions unsafe for very large
crude carriers and ultralarge crude carriers to moor to the Louisiana Offshore Oil
Port (LOOP) buoy. The carriers were unable to ofﬂoad crude cargoes 20 miles off the
Louisiana during Nov. 4-6, said the analysts.
LOOP began receiving tanker cargoes Nov. 7, and all waiting tankers were expected to have ofﬂoaded their cargoes by Nov. 11, the analysts said.
Natural gas storage
Meanwhile, natural gas reached its highest price in more than 3 months on Nov.
9. Analysts attributed the gas price gain to the EIA’s reporting storage levels fell more
than had been expected.
The EIA reported a 7 bcf withdrawal from gas storage for the week ended Nov. 2
after a 9 bcf injection the previous week. Total underground gas storage was 3.4 tcf
vs. 3.3 tcf for the same time last year.
EIA statistics for the same week last year show an injection of 61 bcf. The 5-year
average for the week is an injection of 24 bcf.
“The year-over-year storage surplus fell to 216 bcf vs. a 284 bcf surplus in the
prior week and a 406 (bcf) surplus as of Oct. 6,” said Ronald J. Barone, UBS Securities LLC analyst in New York. “Given overall market dynamics so far this week, we
estimate the EIA to report a 5 bcf injection next week.”

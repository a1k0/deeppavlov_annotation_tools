CONDENSATE EAST OF SUEZ:
NGL and its Naphtha Impacts in
Asia Pacific and Mideast Gulf
Condensate and the Light-End Products Squeeze
By Asia Paciﬁc Energy Consulting

• This is the “deﬁnitive” report on
condensate in the fastest growing,
critical regions of the world, Asia
Paciﬁc and the Mideast Gulf.
• The study provides a complete guide
to optimizing value in future condensate production, utilization, and trade.

Condensate coming into its own
Condensate, one of the two groups
deﬁned as Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs),
is ﬁnally coming of age in world trade,
marketing, reﬁning and petrochemicals. Condensate sales are moving
from a niche marketing specialty to
a mainstream segment of crude and
products trade, and nowhere is this
more evident than in the Mideast Gulf
and Asia Paciﬁc.
This report explains how the protean
nature of condensate allows it to be
used in a wide range of sectors: as a
reﬁnery slate component; in specialized distillation towers called condensate splitters; in direct feed to ethylene crackers; in gasoline blending and
as a substitute for gas in turbine power generation. It can be deﬁned as a
base material, a blending component,
a feedstock or a boiler feed.

COVER
The Atlantis semisubmersible platform, shown on the cover, began
oil and gas exports toward yearend 2007. BP PLC operates the
platform, which is moored in 7,070 ft of water in the Gulf of
Mexico. Atlantis has a design capacity to process 200,000 bo/d
and 180 MMcfd of gas.This project, as well as most oil and gas
projects, benefits from the many advances being made in automation and communications.The first article in the special section,
starting on p. 41, describes the upgrading of downhole control and
communications in a subsea well off Norway while the second
article covers the all-electric subsea trees installed off Netherlands
that have several advantages over trees controlled with electrohydraulic actuators. Photo from BP.

Markey summons majors for oil-price hearing
Responding to record crude oil prices, US Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) announced Mar. 11 that the House Select Committee
on Energy Independence and Global Warming, which he chairs,
will summon chief executives from the five biggest major oil companies to testify at an Apr. 1 hearing.
“The American people deserve answers from Big Oil. The top
five oil companies made record profits last year, and yet are continuing to hold on to tax breaks that could be used to advance the
clean fuels of the future,” said Markey.
The committee has scheduled the hearing for Apr. 1, the first
date available after Congress returns from its planned spring district recess.
“It’s time for these top oil company CEOs to look Americans
in the face and tell them why they can’t support new solutions,”
Markey said.
The House on Feb. 27 passed HR 5351, which would continue
funding for alternative and renewable energy projects by denying
oil and gas companies $18 billion in incentives. The bill faces an
uncertain future in the Senate, and President George W. Bush has
threatened to veto it.
Also on Mar. 11, the US Energy Information Administration issued its latest short-term energy outlook. The forecast retained its
estimate that monthly average retail gasoline prices should peak
around $3.50/gal in May but added, “There is a significant possibility that prices during some shorter time period, or in some
region or subregion, will cross the $4/gal threshold.”

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

dependence on imported oil edges towards 50% and oil prices
reach $100/bbl or more.
Nearly 60% of China’s oil imports come from the Middle East,
which makes the mainland vulnerable to any disturbance in international markets.
But the government estimates that it will need to import 70% of
its oil and 50% of its gas by 2020.

Iraq still not recognizing KRG, IOC deals

Iraq has repeated its refusal to recognize any agreements for oil
or gas signed between the country’s Kurdish Regional Government
and international oil companies.
Iraq’s oil minister Hussain al-Shahristani said, “The central government is in charge of the administration of natural resources,
and agreements not approved by the central government will not
be recognized.”
KRG, against the wishes of the central government, already approved several contracts with international oil companies, including Crescent Petroleum, Sharjah; Reliance Industries Ltd., Mumbai;
OMV AG of Austria; and a consortium led by South Korea’s staterun Korea National Oil Corp.
The Iraqi oil ministry considers such agreements illegal and has
threatened to exclude and blacklist participating IOCs from future
opportunities in the country.
As of Dec. 31, 2007, the Iraqi oil ministry suspended SK Energy’s term contract to import Basra oil because it refused to abandon
its exploration project in the Kurdish region as part of the KNOC
consortium. Last month, KRG Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani

Development

Eni makes oil discovery in Timor Gap
Eni SPA’s Australian subsidiary Eni Australia, Perth, made an
important oil discovery in the Joint Petroleum Development Area
(Timor Gap) administered by Australia and East Timor.
Wildcat well Kitan-1, drilled on Permit JPDA 06-105 in the far
northeast corner of the Timor Gap, flowed 6,100 b/d of oil on
test.
“The data will now be interpreted to assess the potential dimension of the discovery,” reported Eni.
Kitan lies in the vicinity of the now-depleted Elang and Kakatua fields, about 500 km north of Darwin. The well was drilled to
3,568 m TD.
Eni is operator of the permit with 40%. Other interest holders
are Inpex of Japan 35% and Talisman Resources Pty. Ltd. 25%.
Eni has a number of interests in the Timor Sea, including 100%
of the Blacktip gas field under development in the Bonaparte Gulf,
a 10.99% share in the Bayu-Undan gas-condensate field in the
Timor Gap, and 80% in each of five exploration permits in East
Timor waters to the north of the Gap boundary.

OMV wins another exploration license in Norway
OMV AG has secured another offshore exploration license in the
Norwegian Sea, bringing its total allocation to five under the recent
Awards in Predefined Areas licensing round.
OMV (Norge) AS will operate Block PL 471 and will work with
Sagex Petroleum Norge AS on a 50-50 basis.
Helmut Langanger, OMV executive board member responsible
for exploration and production, said the license strengthens the
company’s E&P position in this core region. OMV described the
block as being in a prospective area.

Exall tests Gilwood oil north of Edmonton
Exall Energy Corp., Calgary, said its Marten Mountain horizontal
oil discovery in Alberta 140 miles north-northwest of Edmonton
flowed 1,585 b/d of 40° gravity sweet oil and 575 Mcfd of gas at
850 kpa flowing pressure.
Exall, operator with 59.338% working interest before payout
and 66% after payout, plans to drill a second horizontal well from
the same pad and a vertical well nearby as soon as surface access
permits, likely to be in the third quarter. The company has 66%
interest in 6,080 surrounding acres.
The well, in 102/14-1-75-6w5, averaged 1,135 b/d and 475
Mcfd from Devonian Gilwood on a 21.7-mm choke. The Alberta
allowable for the well is expected to be 285 b/d. The well penetrated 420 m of Gilwood sand.

MEO’s Timor Sea Blackwood ﬁnds gas sands
MEO Australia Ltd., Melbourne, has encountered a 98-m gross
gas-saturated sand interval in its Blackwood-1 wildcat in the Timor
Sea.
This exceeded the anticipated most-likely predrill estimate of
57 m. However the significance has yet to be determined in a production test.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

The Blackwood gas appears to have low carbon dioxide content.
This success could relieve some disappointment of the company’s earlier program at Heron-2, which also found gas but failed
to flow commercial volumes to surface.
Blackwood, like Heron, lies within the large Epenarra structure,
which is a broad, low-relief anticline with a mapped closure of
1,200 sq km. The contingent gas resource of Epenarra is said to be
about 6 tcf.
If Blackwood flows at commercial rates, it could revive MEO’s
plans for an artificial island with an LNG and methanol plant
planned for nearby shallow water at Tassie Shoals 300 km north of
Darwin, for which environmental approval has been obtained.

AED, Sinopec form JV for Timor Sea assets
AED Oil Ltd., Melbourne, has agreed to form a joint venture
with Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production
Corp. of China in which Sinopec will acquire 60% of AED’s assets
in the Timor Sea.
These involve permits AC/P22, AC/L6, and AC/RL 1, which
include producing Puffin oil field and Talbot oil field held under
retention license.
Sinopec will become operator of the JV under the new arrangement, which will become effective Mar. 31.
The transaction, which values AED’s hitherto wholly owned assets at $1 billion (Aus.), is subject to government approvals, including that of Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board.
AED said it will use the funds to retire debt, settle creditors,
and fund its JV interest and ongoing development and exploration opportunities in the permits. The company owes Norwegian
oil services firm AGR Group $41.5 million (Aus.) for production
services and lease of the Puffin field floating production, storage,
and offloading vessel.
AED’s Puffin production is less than the originally anticipated
30,000 b/d of oil from the two producing wells, Puffin-7 and
Puffin-8. Flow was limited to 10,000 b/d due to downhole problems now attributed to drilling and completion flaws.

Redcliffe gauges Halfway oil ﬁnd at Wapiti
Redcliffe Exploration Inc., Calgary, tested a Triassic Halfway sour
oil and gas discovery at Wapiti in the Peace River arch area of westcentral Alberta.
Redcliffe, operator with 72% working interest, said the well
will go on production in the second quarter and that it will maximize producing rates “due to the current royalty rate and incentive program that are proposed to be changed effective Jan. 1,
2009.”
On a 4-day initial production test, the well stabilized at 750 b/d
of 48° gravity oil and 2.6 MMcfd of gas on a 200⁄64-in. choke with
more than 1,900 psig flowing tubing pressure, considered to be
virgin reservoir pressure.
The company plans to drill at least one more well into the pool
this year. ✦

Pakistan ﬁrm signs rig deal

Heerema will work with Norwegian demolition and recycling
company AF Decom Offshore to carry out the work. The award includes options to remove other platforms and installations as well.
Decommissioning of the platforms, which gathered production
from Ekofisk, Eldfisk, Embla, and Tor, will occur in phases so that
Heerema can fully utilize the Hermod and Thialf semisubmersible
crane vessels.
“The Ekofisk topsides and jackets will be removed and taken
to a yard in Vats, Norway, for recycling and disposal. An estimated
96-98% of the material recovered will be recycled by 2014,” Heerema said.
The value of the decommissioning contract, which covers engineering, offshore preparation, removal, and onshore recycling, was
reported to be $1 billion.

Chevron tests heavy oil hydrocracking technology tal’s Port Arthur, Tex., refinery.
Chevron Corp. plans to build a precommercial plant at its
330,000 b/d Pascagoula, Miss., refinery to test the technical and
economic viability of a technology to upgrade heavy oil.
This proprietary vacuum resid slurry hydrocracking (VRSH)
technology has the potential to increase yields of gasoline, diesel,
and jet fuel from heavy and ultraheavy crude oil and could be used
to increase and upgrade production of heavy oil resources, said
company officials.
“Given the increasing role of heavy oil in meeting the world’s
growing energy demand and our significant heavy oil resources,
this technology could provide a unique pathway to increase supplies of clean-burning fuels for the marketplace,” said Mike Wirth,
executive vice-president of global downstream operations for
Chevron.
The Pascagoula precommercial plant will have a capacity of
3,500 b/d. All necessary permits have been secured, and construction is expected to begin later this year.
Chevron has been developing VRSH technology since 2003. The
patented process has undergone successful preliminary testing on
a wide range of feedstocks in multiple pilot plants at Chevron’s
research center in Richmond, Calif.
The company’s research shows that the technology can achieve
up to 100% conversion of the heaviest feedstock versus less than
80% conversion by the best current commercial refining technology.
The Pascagoula refinery, Chevron’s largest wholly owned petroleum refinery, has been operating for more than 40 years.

The EPC contract covers a 50,000-b/d coker and desulfurization, vacuum distillation, and related units at Total’s 231,000 b/d
Port Arthur refinery.
The $2.2 billion increase in the refinery’s deep-conversion capacity will boost output of ultralow-sulfur automotive diesel by 3
million tonnes/year. Commissioning is scheduled in 2011.
The new contract follows Fluor’s completion of front-end engineering and design work at the Port Arthur refinery.

ExxonMobil lets Singapore plant contract

ExxonMobil Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd. authorized John Wood
Group subsidiary Mustang Engineering to begin detailed engineering, design, and construction management for the process
control of a second world-scale steam cracker complex in Singapore.
The project will be integrated with the existing Singapore site,
providing feedstock, operating, and investment synergies with
both the chemical plant and refinery.
The petrochemical project will employ ExxonMobil’s latest proprietary technologies, enabling a broad range of feedstocks to be
processed and converted into higher-value products.
The project will include a world-scale, 1 million tonne/year
ethylene cracker, two 650,000 tpy polyethylene units, a 450,000
tpy polypropylene unit, a 300,000 tpy specialty elastomers unit,
an aromatics extraction unit to produce 340,000 tpy of benzene
and an oxo-alcohol expansion of 125,000 tpy. Project start-up is
expected in early 2011.
Mustang also was awarded the upgrade of the process controls
Total lets contract for Port Arthur reﬁnery
of the existing steam cracker complex. In 2006, Mustang completTotal SA let a $1.9 billion contract to Fluor Corp. for engi- ed the front-end engineering design contract for process control,

Chevron approves Platong Gas II project
Chevron Corp. and its partners have approved construction of
the Platong Gas II natural gas project in the Gulf of Thailand at a
cost of some $3.1 billion with startup scheduled for first quarter
2011.
The Platong Gas II development, which lies in shallow water
200 km offshore, is designed to add 420 MMcfd of gas processing capacity. The project feeds the growing demand for gas in the
domestic market.
In December Chevron signed an agreement with Thailand’s
Ministry of Energy to increase its contract quantity of gas by 500
MMcfd to 1.2 bcfd by 2012 from offshore Blocks 10, 11, 12, and
13.
Platong Gas II is expected to be the major source of this increase
in production. In October 2007, the company received 10-year
lease extensions until 2022 for Blocks 10-13. Chevron has ownership interests in these blocks ranging from 60-80%.
Chevron is operator of Platong II and holds a 69.8% participating interest with Mitsui Oil Exploration Co. Ltd. 27.4%, and PTT
Exploration & Production PCL 2.8%.

Fayetteville-Greenville expansion gets ﬁnal EIS
Texas Gas Transmission LLC’s proposed Fayetteville-Greenville
expansion project would have limited adverse environmental impacts if recommended mitigation measures are used, the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission’s staff concluded in a final environmental impact statement on Mar. 8.
The Owensville, Ky., company’s proposal involves construction
of two 36-in. natural gas pipeline laterals in central Arkansas and
central Mississippi, according to company information.
It said the Fayetteville lateral would extend 167 miles from
Conway County, Ark., to Texas Gas’s main line in Coahama County,
Miss., and would have 1.1 bcfd of capacity. The 750 MMcfd Greenville lateral would start near the company’s compressor station near
Greenville, Miss., and end at a Gulf South Pipeline Co. LP line near
Koskiusko, Miss.
FERC said the proposed project also would include a 10,560
hp compressor station near Koskiusko and related aboveground
facilities along both laterals. It said the Fayetteville lateral would
use existing rights of way for about 90.5 miles, or 54%, of its
length.
Texas Gas indicated that it will use recommended plans and
procedures covering erosion control, water body crossings, storm
water pollution controls, and other measures to control the project’s environmental impact, according to FERC. “Horizontal directional drill construction methods would be used to cross many
sensitive resources,” it said.
FERC said commissioners would consider the final EIS and staff
recommendations before issuing the final permit for the project.
Texas Gas said this could occur during second-quarter 2008 after
which it would soon begin construction.
Service is projected to begin in the third quarter on the Fayetteville lateral segment from Grandview to Latona, Ark., and dur-

ing first-quarter 2009 on the Greenville lateral and the segment
from Latona to Lula, Miss.

Chevron to develop Wheatstone as LNG
Chevron Australia Pty. Ltd. reported plans to develop its wholly
owned 2004 Wheatstone gas field discovery on the North West
Shelf as a stand-alone LNG project with facilities placed on the
northwest coast of mainland Western Australia.
The company says the initial plan is to establish a 5 million
tonne/year LNG facility and allow for later expansion of additional trains. The plant would also produce gas for the domestic
market.
Preliminary engineering and design on the project is under
way, and front-end engineering and design should commence next
year.
Wheatstone field, which has estimated gas reserves of 4.5 tcf,
lies on retention lease WA-17R about 145 km off Dampier in 200
m of water.
The news of a stand-alone development has puzzled the industry in Australia because discovery of the field had been touted more
as a potential gas-to-liquids project than LNG.
Its close proximity to the North Rankin and Goodwyn fields
also makes it a logical addition to the Woodside-operated North
West Shelf LNG project (of which Chevron is a participant) rather
than a new greenfield LNG project in the same vicinity.
In addition, at one point Wheatstone was suggested as a candidate for development alongside Woodside’s nearby Pluto field,
possibly as a supply of gas for Pluto 2’s second train LNG development.
Chevron appears to have rejected those options.
The company says it is preparing design studies at Wheatstone
for development and production, site evaluation, and further field
appraisal work.

CFE lets LNG terminal to Japanese-Korean group
Mexico’s Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) has awarded a
$900 million contract for the construction and operation of an
LNG receiving terminal on Mexico’s Pacific coast to Terminal KMS
de GNL, a consortium of Mitsui & Co. 37.5%, Samsung Corp.
37.5%, and Korea Gas Corp. 25%.
The terminal, to be built at the Port of Manzanillo, will be comprised of two LNG tanks, a regasification facility, and a pier. Commercial start-up is scheduled for midyear 2011.
The company will manage and operate the facilities for 20 years
based on a service contract with CFE. The partners said they will
charge a regasification fee of 40¢/Mcf to process the gas.
After starting at 90 Mcfd in 2011, supply to the facility will be
scaled up to 500 Mcfd by 2015 in increments of 180 Mcfd, 360
Mcfd, and 400 Mcfd. The gas from Manzanillo will feed the 3 Gw
of capacity CFE intends to install in the region.
CFE earlier awarded Repsol Comercializadora de Gas a 15-year,
$15 billion contract in September 2007 to supply the Manzanillo
terminal with Peruvian gas (OGJ, Mar. 10, 2008, Newsletter.) ✦

Oil supply and investment
In the letter entitled “World decline
rate,” the authors quoted a Cambridge
Energy Research Associates forecast for
a world oil supply of 112 million b/d by
2017 (OGJ, Feb. 4, 2008, p. 12). Taking
the average world oil production of 86
million b/d in 2007 gives a daily supply
increase from 2008 to 2017 of about
2.6 million bbl. Putting this more oil
volume in relation to daily world oil
production in 2007 gives about 3%.
For comparison, Chevron projected
in 2007 in an advertisement that world
oil demand could reach 115 million b/d
in 2030 from 82 million b/d in 2004.
In this case the daily oil demand increase would be about 1.3 million bbl
and makes in relation to daily world oil
production in 2004 about 1.5%.
Since average world oil production
has been 86 million b/d and 82 million
b/d in 2007 and 2004, the daily increase was 1 million b/d/year, or closer
to Chevron’s forecast.
Which is more realistic—1.5% or
3%—is difficult to tell. But for me, there
is nothing suspect about any of these
percentages. Maybe CERA has forecasted
the increased supply by adding how
much more oil the world would need
plus how much “new oil” the exploration and production industry has to
produce to replace production declines.
This new oil has to come from new discoveries, greenfields, brown and mature
fields, improved and enhanced oil recovery, unconventional oil, etc. However, I
question CERA’s story that the world’s
oil production is declining at 4.5%/year.
To satisfy rising world oil demand,
and at the same time replace production
declines (both have “intelligently” to
go hand-in-hand) requires fresh money
to invest. The authors give an example
for an investment volume: Saudi Arabia will invest $50 billion to increase
production capacity by 2 million b/d
(or $25,000/b/d). I think that this
dollar-per-barrel figure is low to cover
all needed capital expenditure for the
work to be done from the reservoir to
the pipeline.

Energy and the poor
The problem with this analysis is that the
government doesn’t create the money it uses
to promote an industry. It takes or borrows the
money from taxpayers—ultimately individuals,
not companies—elsewhere in the economy. In
those parts of the economy, spending, profits, and
investment decline under the new burden. Job
creation does, too.
The government, therefore, doesn’t create jobs
when it manipulates energy. It just moves them
around. What’s more, it moves jobs from parts of
the economy profitable enough to be paying taxes
into some favored part that would be unprofitable
without an inflow of other people’s money. So resources flow from efficient, low-cost activities into
inefficient, high-cost sectors. There’s no way to do
this without generating cost. And everyone knows
who suffers most from added cost.
This is not an argument against regulation.

hypocrisy of modern politics. ✦

Politicians who favor governmental solutions
to energy problems often make two statements
that those more committed to market solutions
tend to avoid. One of the statements is that rising
energy prices hurt poor people most. The other is
that government-sponsored energy development
creates jobs.
The statements are related in ways that should
weaken energy agendas centered on governments.
The first statement, that rising energy costs
hurt the poor most, doesn’t need expression. It’s
self-evidently true. Vulnerability to preeminent
hardship when necessities rise in price is the sad
essence of poverty. To point this out as though it
were some grand insight about a point requiring
debate is condescending, if not outright annoying.
The point requiring debate is how best to avoid
hurting the poor.

COMMENT
In this election year, the public is being offered numerous solutions to the
energy problems that the
US and the world must
address.
One such proposal
being actively promoted
is to replace transportation fuels refined from
imported oil with fuels
such as biodiesel, bioethanol, and other
advanced biofuels.
Often presented in the popular
media and in political discourse is the
notion that one of the most effective
strategies to reduce our national dependence on imported oil is to have large
quantities of biofuels produced from
things that grow, and that somehow the
private sector will embrace this strategy
and produce all of the renewable fuels
that will be needed.
The latest buzz is about using waste
materials instead of food crops, because
soaring corn prices have distorted the
prices we pay for food as well as for
corn ethanol.
The public is being told this second
generation of biofuels could be produced from agriwaste, such as corn stover and wheat straw; from fast-growing
cellulosic crops, such as switch grass;
from forest residue and other wood
waste; and from municipal solid waste
retrieved from land fills.
Unfortunately, not being mentioned
are the impracticalities of producing
large quantities of fuels from these
materials. Not being addressed are
other impediments, such as bringing
together the varied and often competing interests into biofuels projects,
the technological hurdles that must be
overcome, the vast amount of capital
investment that will be needed, and
the incentives the public will need to

dismaying that the realities encountered
in developing renewable biofuels are
often not even mentioned, let alone
discussed. Assumptions upon which so
much hope is being placed are often
wrong or shortsighted.
The latest example of oversimplification is the presumption built into
the Renewable Fuels Standards (RFS),
which is a component of the Energy
Independence and Security Act of 2007
(EISA). RFS is a legislative mandate
requiring increased national production
of renewable biofuels—to 36 billion
gal/year by 2022 from 9 billion gal/
year in 2008— without addressing
how this can be done. It therefore is in
serious need of a reality check.
As shown in Fig. 1, the RFS mandates
that US corn ethanol production reach
a production peak by 2015 and not
increase thereafter. This will require that
cellulosic biofuel and all other advanced
biofuels play a larger role in meeting
the RFS mandate, increasing to 58% of
the total RFS mandate by 2022 from
less than 1% today, with corn ethanol
dropping from its current 99% of the
total to 42% in 15 years (Fig. 2).
The fundamental question that one
must ask is whether it is reasonable to
assume that EISA’s RFS mandate for the
private sector is realistic. Based on what
is known today, it is not. If nothing
is done to assist the private sector, a
mandated 36 billion gal/year of renewable fuels within 15 years is wishful
thinking. There may be a chance that
this could happen but only if extensive,
costly government support programs
are put into place.

What is likely?
Although EISA may have accurately
projected a need for 36 billion gal of
renewable biofuels by 2022, its depenOil & Gas Journal / Mar. 17, 2008

dence on private enterprise to fill this
need is unrealistic for several reasons:
• The renewable fuels industry is
fragmented, with only modest participation by large corporate interests.
Biodiesel currently is being produced from soybean oil in 20 biodiesel
processing plants, owned by small corporations. A recent National Biodiesel
Board survey indicated that a number
of small biodiesel companies were raising equity for about 30 new biodiesel
plants. Soybean oil used by these plants
is obtained from 60 crushing plants
in 21 states. Outside of a few growers’
cooperatives, ownership is concentrated
with major agribusiness giants, such
as Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, and
Cargill.
These crushing operations obtain
soybeans from local soybean growers’ cooperatives. There are more than
300,000 farms in the US that grow
soybeans on 75 million acres, most of
them alternating with corn in a 50:50
rotation. About 75% of the soybean
crop is grown in the Upper Midwest
and Midwest, with the balance coming from the Southeast and Southwest.
Crushers in these regions produce
about 75% of the soybean oil and soy-

bean meal. Vegetable oil produced from
other oilseed crops such as canola is not
now being used in making biodiesel.
Outside of a few small cellulosic
ethanol plants that are just becoming
operational on a commercial scale, all
of the fuel ethanol is now being produced in 160 corn ethanol processing
plants. As with biodiesel, most of these
processing plants are operating in the
Corn Belt states and are owned by small
companies or growers’ cooperatives.
The companies active in developing
cellulosic ethanol plants also are mostly
small companies. But a few major oil
companies and paper companies are
now participating in cellulosic ethanol
development projects.
• With the exception of processes
now used to convert cornstarch into
ethanol, technologies for producing
advanced renewable fuels are still in the
research and development or pilot plant
stage.
• There are only a handful of plants
currently being developed to produce
cellulosic ethanol on a commercial
scale. One is a plant in Japan that has
been producing commercial quantities
of cellulosic ethanol from wood chips
and wood waste for the past 2 years.

Another is a project, well under way, in
which a paper mill is being converted
into a biofuels production facility using
wood chips and black liquor as feedstock.
In addition, two funded projects are
emerging from pilot operations and are
being scaled up to produce cellulosic
ethanol from municipal solid waste.
And there is an exciting project under
way in which a 2-stage thermal process
is being used to convert forest residue
and wood waste into cellulosic ethanol
on a commercial scale.
However, there is still a long way to
go before the RFS mandate can be met,
as additional R&D of biofuels processes
remain in progress to perfect and improve process efficiency, obtain higher
biofuels yields, and make a wider range
of advanced biofuels from the cellulosic
waste.

Enormous investment
To meet the RFS mandate, capital
investment in advanced biofuels plants
must reach $11 billion in 4 years, increasing to $46 billion in 10 years and
$105 billion in 15 years. Added to these
amounts is the capital cost of increasing
corn ethanol output to the 15 billion

gal/year level at an added capital cost
of $75 billion. In other words, the RFS
mandate calls for private capital investment in renewable fuels plant capacity
of $180 billion over the next 15 years
(see table).
Added to this are the additional
amounts that must be invested to
improve the technology, provide supporting pipelines and storage terminal
capacity, and upgrade distribution facilities to handle new fuels. Clearly, all of
this private investment is just not going
to happen as a result of a legislative
mandate.
With respect to RFS projections, it
may be realistic to expect corn ethanol
production to increase to 15 billion
gal/year over the next 10 years from 9
billion gal/year, assuming that current support programs remain in effect
and corn crops are increased without
further market distortion.
But it is unrealistic to assume that the
RFS projections for advanced biofuels
production could match corn ethanol
production in 10-15 years. Cellulosic
ethanol and biodiesel production is
now just a “drop in the bucket.” In
4 years, the RFS mandate calls for 2
billion gal of cellulosic biofuel, biodiesel, and other advanced biofuels to be
produced, increasing to 9 billion gal 10
years from now, and 21 billion gal 15
years from now.
26

2012

This growth in advanced biofuels
production will require at least 35 new
55-million gal/year biofuels plants to
be operating by 2012, 164 by 2017,
and 382 by 2022. New capital investment in advanced biofuels plants of this
size could exceed $11 billion by 2012
and require an additional $34 billion by 2017 and $59 billion more by
2022. EISA does not provide funding or
incentives for this massive investment it
is mandating.

expand and create a demand for vegetable oil that does not now exist. Likewise, crushers are reluctant to increase
capacity to support yet-to-be-planted
oilseed crops or to produce vegetable
oil for yet-to-be-built biodiesel plants.
• Grain elevator operators and farm
cooperatives that generate large quantities of agricultural waste are not eager
to organize and invest in joint ventures
for collection, preprocessing, and storage operations in anticipation of attracting investors to build new agriwaste-toethanol plants,
• Pulp and paper mills that have access to large amounts of pulp wood and
wood waste are not fully convinced that
they should produce cellulosic ethanol
or other advanced fuels, as they have
never been in the fuels business. They
also are reluctant to upset the cost they
now pay for wood and wood waste, or
to modify their pulp mill operations
if it could in any way adversely impact
their paper-making operations.
• And no one is running out to build
biofuels plants at a cost of $125-275
million each.

3.5% of all transportation fuels to be
consumed in the US in 2022.
On top of the other deficiencies
associated with EISA, the RFS mandate
is probably not enforceable, as the
mechanism for enforcing it is weak and
ill-defined. The responsibility for seeing
that mandates are met is left to the US
Environmental Protection Agency administrator, who has to negotiate with
state governments…and grant exceptions when mandates prove impossible
to meet.
At best, EISA provides political cover
to politicians. The added biofuels to
be produced under the RFS mandates
would be only a small part of the energy independence solution EISA seeks
to address.

Costly government aid
What could the government do

T E R E S T
other than a mandate? Meeting the RFS
mandates would require a combination
of extensive added government aid in
the form of R&D grants, tariff protections, low-cost project financing, and
loan guarantees to stimulate private
investment in biofuels plants and ancillary facilities.
In addition, the government would
have to provide tax incentives for
biofuels operators during ramp-up
and possibly price subsidies and other
measures. ✦

Yergin: Renewables becoming competitive in energy markets
Renewable energy is becoming
competitive in energy markets yet
must overcome problems of economics, technology, and scale, said Daniel
Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy
Research Associates (CERA) and executive vice-president of IHS Inc., at the
Washington International Renewable
Energy Conference in Washington, DC.
“Renewables are already a significant business in terms of tens of
billions of dollars in investment per
year,” Yergin said. “But the scale of the
existing energy business is enormous,
and we’ll only start to see the real
impact in terms of market share in the
next 5-10 years.”
High energy prices, issues of climate
change and energy security, and a major
shift in public opinion are converging
to drive the development of renewable
energy. “All of this is supported by the
growing conviction that new carbon
policies will reshape the competitive
landscape of the global energy business,” Yergin said.
As a result, he said, “We are go28

ing through a period of what I call the
‘great bubbling,’ a high degree of innovation all across the energy spectrum.
This is boosting the competitiveness
of renewables and efficiency and is
also evident in terms of conventional
energy.” According to the worst-case
and best-case scenarios of a new CERA
study, renewable power could be supplying 7-16% of the world’s electric
needs by 2030.
CERA’s study assesses the prospects
of various clean energy technologies
and defines key risks and opportunities. The technologies include biofuels,
renewable power, carbon capture and
storage, nuclear power, and hydropower. According to the study, clean energy
investment—including renewables as
well as nuclear and hydro—could reach
a cumulative total of $7 trillion by
2030.
“There is a broad range of opportunities and benefits, as well as risks and
pitfalls as the modern energy industry increasingly moves to adopt clean
technologies that will be part of the

alternative, low-carbon pathway to the
energy future,” Yergin told the conference. The changing energy future will
be shaped both by traditional technology and engineering firms, electric
power companies, and oil and gas
companies, and by new entrants such
as innovators, entrepreneurs, venture
capital firms, and high-tech companies, he said.
“Governments around the world—
prompted by dual concerns about
energy security and climate change—
will also play a significant role,” Yergin
said. “As governments move forward to
further encourage renewables development, they do need to pay attention to
key considerations about costs, scale,
reliability, timing, and unintended consequences. Another key issue is the additional investment needed to support
and tie renewables into existing energy
systems.”
Yergin added, “A major reason
for the recent leap to $100/bbl [for
benchmark crude] is the economy, but
now a weak US economy and the credit

crunch, rather than the strong global
economy that has been so important the
last few years. A slowing US economy,
rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and
expectations of more, and a weak US
dollar, along with the reappearance of
inflation around the world, are driving
investors into oil and other commodities. Instead of the traditional ‘flight
to the dollar’ during times of uncertainty, we are seeing a ‘flight to oil.’ At
the same time, rising costs in the oil
field have put a higher floor under oil
prices.”
According to the CERA study:
• Renewable power technologies
are poised for substantial growth. Wind
will make the largest gains, followed
by solar power and biomass, despite
near-term bottlenecks in wind turbine
manufacturing, supply shortages in
silicon, and competitive pressures from
escalating component costs.
• Government policy remains a key
driver for clean energy advancement.
Putting a price on CO2 emissions, setting mandates, and providing subsidies
all work to kick-start clean energy
technologies by meeting the economic
competitiveness and cost advantages of
conventional technologies. “The challenge in the years ahead is to provide
subsidies in a way that ensures that
these technologies get off the drawing
board and are able to wean themselves
from support—allowing for a phaseout rather than an increase in subsidies—as they become commercially
viable on their own. It is also important
that mandates be set at achievable levels
and with care so as not to create unexpected pressures from higher prices,”
the report said.
• A full range of clean technologies
along with the demand side responses
will be necessary to address the challenge of redirecting global greenhouse
gas emissions trends. While many clean
technologies are commercially available, more work is needed to develop
and demonstrate a broader set of
technologies, including advanced coal
systems.
• Nuclear and hydroelectric genera-

tion will account for almost half the
gross clean power additions by 2030.
The coal resource base and utilization in
the US and China will create a powerful
drive to develop “clean coal” technologies.
• Rapid economic growth may push
Asian energy needs from 30% of cur-

rent global demand to 40% by 2030;
combined with its manufacturing costcompetitiveness, this could make Asia
a nexus for clean energy technology
research, development, and equipment
production.

Ziff: Royalty hike worsens Alberta gas industry troubles
A looming royalty increase is aggravating a “recession” in Alberta’s conventional oil and gas industry, according to
a veteran Calgary consultant.
The province’s conventional industry
is dominated by natural gas, drilling
for which is plummeting, says Paul Ziff,
chief executive officer of Ziff Energy
Group (Fig. 1).
The Alberta government last October
announced what it called a New Royalty
Framework, rejecting a special tax on
oil sands recommended by a review
panel but lifting royalty rates overall
(OGJ, Nov. 5, 2007, p. 34).
For natural gas, the framework
raises the maximum royalty to 50%
from 35% and eliminates tiers, starting
in 2009. It retains and will revamp
programs for special production categories such as deep formations and
marginal wells.
“Based on the much lower price for
natural gas than oil and today’s higher
drilling and operating costs,” Ziff says

in a recent report, “the new royalties
on natural gas production are coming
at a lousy time and are contributing to
a sharp drop in current and future gas
drilling activity.”

Prices, costs
The consultant notes that prices for
natural gas in Alberta are half those of
oil on an energy-equivalent basis and
that most of the profits reported by big
energy companies come from oil produced from mature fields (Fig. 2).
He also points to a “dramatic escalation in the cost to find new gas reserves.”
His firm estimates that the full-cycle
cost of new gas supplies increased
to $4.70/Mcf (Can.) in 2006 from
$1.50/Mcf in 1995.
Of the 1995 estimate, $0.85/Mcf
represents finding and development
costs, including drilling, seismic work,
land, and facilities; $0.40/Mcf re-

flects operating costs; and $0.25/Mcf
is administrative cost. The 2006 cost
breakout: $3.05/Mcf finding and development, $1.30 operating, and $0.35
administrative.
“Adding the producer’s return or
profit, royalty, and taxes since 2006, the
price of natural gas is not high enough
to justify average new gas exploration,”
Ziff says.

Spending drops
After announcement of the new royalty framework, he adds, “Conventional
industry spending has dropped sharply,”
while in neighboring Saskatchewan and
British Columbia, it’s “booming.”
Gas drilling in the US, where the
gas price is similar to that in Alberta
but where costs and royalties are lower,
continues to increase, Ziff says. In
Western Canada (mainly Alberta), the
annual average rig count fell 40% last
year.
Even before the new royalty rate,
producers faced rapidly rising costs,
especially for labor, which is in short
supply because of surging oil sands
development. In addition, Ziff says,
the strong Canadian dollar has cut
about $3/Mcf from the Canadian gas
price.
Many Canadian companies have said
they’re cutting spending in Alberta,
and many non-Canadian companies are
quietly shifting spending away from the
province.
“Ziff Energy estimates at least 80%
of companies active in Alberta have
reduced their planned conventional
spending since the new royalty announcement,” the consultant says.
Most affected by the spending cuts

Some operators have announced
layoffs in Alberta, and Ziff Energy expects more. Many service companies
are laying off workers. Underutilized
equipment is moving to the US and
Russia.
According to Ziff, biweekly sales
of crown land have dropped to their
lowest level in almost a decade in a
trend that will cut Alberta’s future
royalty receipts.
The province’s slowdown jeopardizes the government’s target of
a $1.4 billion increase in royalty
revenue.
“Unless the proposed royalty
program is revised, conventional gas

Thailand from Chevron and initiation of new technologies from Shell.
Gastech 2008, held Mar. 10-13, drew more than
2,000 delegates and 3,000 exhibitors and other visitors, according to conference officials. They touted
this year’s event as the largest in its 35-year history.

Principles, partnerships
Meeting anticipated growth in gas demand to
2030, according to Blackwell, requires three principles to strengthen industry partnerships: shared
respect, shared capabilities, and shared rewards.
He named the Angola LNG project as an example
in which partners—elements of NOC Sonagol and
the various IOC companies—have worked in shared
respect to overcome inherent conflicts of interest
to achieve common goals. Partners in the project
announced a final investment decision at yearend
2007.
Blackwell cited Chevron’s nearly 30-year contract
with PetroChina to develop major fields in the country for which Chevron, exemplifying shared capabilities, called on its expertise in handling sour gas as key
to project success.
To illustrate his principle of shared rewards, Blackwell announced the advance to FID for construction
of the Platong Gas II natural gas project in the Gulf of
Thailand (OGJ Online, Mar. 10, 2008). Total development cost of the field is about $3.1 billion with startup set for first quarter 2011, he said.
The shallow-water Platong Gas II development,
120 miles offshore, will add 420 MMcfd processing capacity and feed growing Thailand gas demand.
Chevron operates the field and holds a 69.8% participating interest with Mitsui Oil Exploration Co.
Ltd. (27.4%) and PTT Exploration & Production PCL
(2.8%).
ExxonMobil’s Swiger reviewed the company’s
growth prospects for gas generally and LNG specifically. Overall energy growth to 2030 will advance
by 1.3%/year with fossil fuels being indispensable
to meeting that growth and natural gas advancing to
meet 25% of demand, up from 20% in 2007.
Technology advances will be critical for supply to
meet demand by, importantly, enabling higher gas
production as LNG to move from remote sites.
Perhaps most importantly, according to Swiger, is
the need for strong, sustaining partnerships among
IOCs, NOCs, and governments in emerging countries
that host new gas developments.

bringing new gas supplies to markets,
Shell’s Chadwick announced two new
technologies that are advancing toward
implementation.
One is Shell’s Automated Cool-Down
that monitors and controls cooling in
liquefaction plants’ main cryogenic heat
exchangers. The tool addresses the occasional problem of bundle tube leaks in
the MCHE. The leaks, he said, can cause
unexpected unit shutdowns. Further,
the tool “leads to rapid start-up and less
flaring.”
Shell also announced in Chadwick’s
remarks that it was proceeding with
development of floating LNG aboard a
vessel 400 m by 75 m wide and capable
of producing 3.5 million tonnes/year.
The design also embodies hydrocarbon

liquids handling capabilities.
Although he avoided tagging the
FLNG plans with cost estimate or production timetable, Chadwick said that
within 4 months, the company would
issue an international tender to selected
consortia consisting of Japanese and Korean shipyards and EPC contractors.

Contrarian view
In an afternoon address, Judisch
stated that the immediate future of
LNG is not one of Asia-Pacific drawing away all supply. That, he said, is
conventional wisdom. In fact, in the
“next few months,” several capacity additions are due for Asia and the
Middle East, culminating in 2010
with as much as 96 million tonnes/

year coming to the marketplace.
His central message was that “markets work”, and he cited as an example
how Woodside has been building new
LNG trains every 2 years.
Moreover, he said recent history
shows US Henry Hub and Europe’s National Balancing Point above Japanese
Crude Cocktail (JCC) pricing; “it can
happen again,” he said, as the number of short-term cargoes increases
and LNG supply and market flexibility
grow.
“We now have an overbuild of regasification with more than half existing
terminals empty,” Judisch said. Floating LNG is “an answer” to managing
the imbalance between production and
regasification. ✦

for sellers, its effect on the LNG industry is less certain.
The “dash for gas” over the past
2 decades was driven largely by the
economics of the combined cycle
gas turbine. Previous oil prices made
natural gas the economic as well as
environmental fuel of choice. The environmental advantage remains, but high
prices threaten gas’s “most-favored
fuel” status for power generation.

to demand signals. Over the past years,
LNG evinced many features of a commodity: It has become globally fungible, and increasing trade flexibility is
allowing LNG in some cases to respond
to price signals and flow to the highest
value markets worldwide.
Spare transport and import infrastructure are emerging to enable this,
he said. And there appears to be increasing competition within the flexible
position of the trade as the volume and
number of flexible LNG holders grow.
Houston cautioned, however, that
elements remain to inhibit industry’s
becoming a fully efficient and competitively traded global market. These include constrained market and resource
access, infrastructure costs, existing
long-term agreements, company business models, capabilities, and lack of
price discovery.
Despite increasing flexibility, Houston believes that true liquidity, transparent market indices, or direct-trade
instruments are unlikely near term.
Most critically, he said, excess production capacity is unlikely to emerge in
the system any time soon.
Houston and BG Group believe that,
even in an evolution towards greater
global price convergence, external factors will inject volatility into short-term
markets. Simply put, he said, “‘stuff
happens’ and prices will react.” The July
2007 earthquake in Japan is evidence
of that.
A more fundamental question is
whether LNG will form a stable and
“volatility dampening” trade system
or whether it will in fact add to global
trade volatility. While increasingly flexible volume should over time smooth
the fluctuations of individual markets,
the US market is about to “take up the
burden” of balancing seasonal demand
for the rest of the globe.
He said there will be periods when
“global volatility [will be] transmitted
to the NYMEX rather than the NYMEX
smoothing global volatility.” Add to
this are the increasing national political
agendas being layered on. ✦

the production of biofuels, especially

Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA
(Petrobras) and biotechnology firm
Kior Inc., Menlo Park, Calif., last
week signed a cooperation agreement
over the development of secondgeneration biofuels.
Petrobras wants to use plant waste
materials to produce bio-oil using
Kior’s biomass catalytic cracking
technology. “Second-generation biofuels don’t compete with foodstuff
plants,” Petrobras said, underlining a
point of great significance these days.
Many governments and companies
have had to temper their enthusiasm
for biofuels after howls of protest were
raised last year about their ill effects on
the price and availability of food.

This article describes a scheme for
summarizing visually the spatial distribution, intensity, and productivity of oil
and gas drilling for areas outside the US
and Canada.
The article is extracted from a US
Geological Survey circular, “Statistics
of Petroleum Exploration outside the
United States and Canada.”1
This circular updates USGS circulars 981 and 1096 and
extends the coverage of
those studies to China,
Eastern Europe, and the
Former Soviet Union. As
with the earlier editions,
the data are based on
IHS Inc.’s International
Petroleum & Exploration Production
database.2
The analytical approach in USGS
Circular 1288 focuses on exploration
maturity as a key to ranking search
areas. Efficient exploration strategies
typically rank areas by exploration maturity. However, exploration maturity is
multifaceted.
The locations and results of past and
current drilling reflect the industry’s
accumulated geologic knowledge of
an area, but well counts alone are an
incomplete measure of exploration
intensity.
For example, in partially explored
areas, information from a few wildcat wells can potentially condemn a

Grid points are corners of square cells with area 8 sq miles. If three noncolinear wells deﬁne a circle having a radius of
less than 20 miles, then the triangle connecting the wells deﬁnes the delineated prospective area that consists of grid
points that lie within the triangles.

large area if the data show that the
occurrence of commercial discoveries is unlikely because of the timing of
hydrocarbon generation, the absence of
available traps, poor or defective seals,
or because of the absence of reservoirquality rocks. The degree of exploration
maturity is determined by the spatial
attributes of past drilling.
Exploration maturity should be
defined relative to a density of drilling
that, in turn, implies an approximate
threshold size of an undiscovered oil
or gas accumulation. An area is mature
relative to a threshold size if the drilling
is sufficiently dense that there is little
chance that accumulations at least as
large as the threshold size remain undetected in the exploration area.

Characterizing maturity
Locations in a country or basin are
described mathematically as a set of
grid points that represent corners of
square cells that cover the country or
province.
For purposes of visual presentation,
each cell is scaled to cover 8 sq miles,
making the corner points 2.83 miles
apart. Each grid point is identified by a
longitude and a latitude location. The
delineated prospective area is described
as the set of all (grid) points inside the
area drilled that are reasonably close to
wells (producing or dry).
The scheme for assigning grid points
to the delineated prospective area is
based on well locations. Any three noncolinear wells (that is, not in a straight
line) can form a triangle where the
wells are the vertices, and the nonoverlapping triangles can be drawn for any
set of wells (Fig. 1).
A grid point is said to be in the
delineated prospective area if that grid
point is located within a triangle that is
small enough to fit inside a circle that
has a radius of 20 miles. The delineated prospective area, in square miles,
is computed as the combined area of
those triangles having a well at each
vertex and fitting inside a circle with a
radius of 20 miles. Delineated prospective areas are displayed on maps as

StatoilHydro operates Visund oil and

The subsea-completed wells in the
field are tied back to the floater with
flexible risers. Oil is piped to Gullfaks
for storage and export while gas is
piped to Europe, with gas exports having started in 2005.
The platform controls 32 subsea
wells that produce an average 32,000

Redundancy at the surface is evident
both within the power cabinet, in the
form of dual modular supplies running
in parallel, and by providing two surface units in a Channel A and B configuration. This parallel independent channel configuration carries through to the
actuator itself, ensuring operability of
the system despite any single-point failure. Additionally, either channel can be
taken offline for any reason while the
other continues to function normally.
Two subsea modules serve to
regulate power and control tree and

subsea modules.
The first module reduces and regulates the 3-kv input to 300 v DC and
separates the communication signal
from the power conductor. The reduced
voltage and independent communication signal then go to the electric subsea control module. This unit controls
valve functions, logs actuator parametric data, receives sensor information,
and communicates with surface control
equipment.
A fully populated control module
currently can operate 16 functions.

Qualiﬁcation
The system is not only a new product line but also an entirely new technology in subsea completions. Because
of this, Cameron employed a comprehensive qualification program.
Three levels of testing covered all
equipment from the smallest electronic
circuit board to large main assemblies.
Actual tests carried out and range of
test parameters followed international
standards where applicable or past experience and good engineering practice
where no standard applied.
In some instances, the qualification
tests surpassed the guidelines within
the standards such as the case with
electronic printed circuit boards. The
standard stipulates testing of either each
individual board or testing of circuit
board assemblies. Cameron did both.
Because all-electric control is new technology, many of the components are
not covered by any standard so that the
testing was at a very high level to set a
benchmark.
The first level of testing was on the
electronic printed circuit board, in accordance with ISO-13628-6 at Q1 level.
The guidelines of this testing are:
• Shock—30 g acceleration, 11 ms
half sine in six directions along three
perpendicular axes
• Vibration—25 hz ±2 mm displacement, 1 octave/min max, double
sweep, 25-1,000 hz 5 g acceleration,
1 octave/min, double sweep, vibration
tests repeated for all three perpendicular axes, 2-hr random vibration within
following parameters: 20-80 hz at 3
db/octave rise, 80-350 hz at 0.04 g2/
hz, and 350-2,000 hz at 3 db/octave
roll-off.
• Thermal—48-hr soak at –18° C.,
and 48-hr soak at 70° C.
The second level of testing was at the
subassembly level. This included multiple printed circuit boards mounted in
a rack or stacked and other smaller assemblies used to build the major assemblies. The level of testing for these units
also was according to ISO-13628-6 but
at Q2 level. The testing was similar to

the above but at slightly less stressful
levels as follows:
• Shock—10 g acceleration, 11 ms
half sine in six directions along three
perpendicular axes
• Vibration—25 hz ±2 mm displacement, 1 octave/min max, double
sweep, 25-150 hz 5 g acceleration, 1
octave/min, double sweep, vibration

tests repeated for all three perpendicular axes, 2 hr random vibration within
following parameters: 20-80 hz at 3
db/octave rise, 80-350 hz at 0.04 g2/
hz, and 350-2,000 hz at 3 db/octave
roll-off.

Shock and vibration levels are lower
because the mass of the equipment
under test is higher and the main purpose of this test is to verify integrity of
assembly means and connections.
The third level of testing included
each major assembly, such as each size
of gate valve, choke, power regulation
and communication module (PRCM),
and the electric subsea control module
(eSCM). Also included in this classification were the electrical connectors and
jumper assemblies. Testing for these
assemblies took the form:
• Seal test.
• Function test.
• Fail-safe close test (gate valve
only).
• Overload test (1.5 × maximum
stem force).
• Temperature cycle test (–2° C.
minimum, 65° C. maximum).
• Hyperbaric to 3,000 m.
• Gate valve endurance cycle test
(1,000 open/close cycles).
• Choke endurance cycle test (200
open/close cycles in 5 mm steps to
simulate 1,000,000 steps of electrohydraulic choke actuator).
• Shock and vibration (shock: 5g 9
ms half sine four times in six directions,
vibration: 10-100 hz 0.6 g rms in three
axes, 1.8 g maximum, 4 × 15 min).
Connectors and jumpers were fully
tested by the manufacturer to the same
international standard.
After fully qualifying all equipment,
Cameron ran in stages a series of integration tests to ensure interoperability
and verify software operation.
The first stage, called Phase 1A,
involved a surface power supply and
surface modem driving through a cable
length simulator to a variable electronic
load and subsea modem in a nonredundant configuration.
Upon completion of 1A, Phase 1B
replaced the simulated load with actual
subsea equipment including the PRCM,
eSCM, and electric actuators still in a
single channel.

The final level of testing, Phase 2,
duplicated all the power and control elements forming a fully dual-redundant
system in a channel A and channel B
configuration. Although not officially
part of the qualification program, this
additional testing was crucial for proving the fully qualified components
functioned properly when integrated
together.
To document this comprehensive
series of tests fully, Cameron created a
qualification program dossier with the
following documents:
• Qualification program overview
that provides a short, concise summary
of equipment tested, levels of testing,
results and effectiveness of testing, and
mitigating steps taken.
• Qualification philosophy that provides references international standards
where applicable and justifies types
and levels of testing where no standard
applies.

• Qualification test plan that includes
system description, testing performed
before final product qualification, test
status table, comprehensive reference to
international standards used, and other
relevant information covering the full
qualification program.

through special purchasing agreements
for securing production slots and more
importantly ensuring that specific
knowledge gained by the vendors during the product qualification process
would not get lost.
In addition, the project placed
special emphasis on identifying critical
long-lead items early in and put priority on design freezes for these items.
Also the dedicated purchase agreements
allowed for the possibility to make
changes without having to go through
the typical vendor approach whereby
there is defined scope agreed and variation orders are used to manage change,
which typically take up critical time.

They can also allow a more comprehensive understanding of ideal wall
thickness, taking into account that thinner pipe walls can reduce RS gradients
that cause failures while also reducing
installation and material costs. Such
tools will also help operators prioritize
maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation
needs.
Neutron techniques are also complementary to other testing methods,
extending their benefit to pipeline op-

erators by revealing hidden cause-effect
relationships leading to pipeline failures
and identifying potential weaknesses in
protection systems.
This article explains how ND and
SANS techniques can address problems
in current pipeline-integrity assessment
methodologies.

Background

Guaranteeing pipeline structural
integrity requires pipeline operators to
maintain a low likelihood of failures
while at the same time keeping operating and maintenance costs under
control. The operator’s ability to prevent
failures through effective predictive
models and appropriate inspection determines whether a low failure rate will
be achieved.
The presence of a microcrack due to
the welding process can lead to failure of the entire structure. An accurate
method of assessing residual stress in
pipelines can help address this and
achieve desired safety and reliability
levels.
Knowledge of RS levels and other
microstructural factors (e.g., inhomogeneities, precipitates, microvoids, etc.)
can help in selecting pipe manufacturers, specifying quality of materials,
establishing safe operating pressures,

sion electron microscopy serves as
the standard means of studying the
morphology, although this and other
standard methods of materials science
do not allow for characterizing the
microstructure completely.
Precursory use of ND and SANS tools
allows control of the micro and nanostructure determination of pipeline materials, enriching the available data set
by supplying fundamental parameters.
Fig. 5 shows the additional parameters
that help understand and ultimately
predict the degradation of materials,
their possible fracture, and anticipated
lifetime.
The proposed forecasting failure
model will determine RS and remaining material life with relatively simple
pattern matching techniques of actual pipeline data against the previously identified patterns. The two main
sources of the model’s data are design
data and data obtained from the ND
and SANS tests.
The model allows prediction of
behavior of the considered material
under different scenarios. If current
mechanical stress conditions continue,
for example, the material will suffer a
particular defect; or the cycling fatigue
process coupled with thermal-related
RS can cause a material fracture if cycling conditions continue.
Characterizing the gap between
stress status estimates and maximum
allowable stress values for the material with different scenarios also allows
determination of remaining life. Other
important features of the proposed
predictive model include identification
of probable causal factors of failures
and the ability either to eliminate such
causal factors or mitigate the resulting
problem.
Fig. 6 shows a schematic diagram of
the proposed forecasting failure model
for pipelines.
The proposed forecasting model
consists of a relational database formed
by catalogued material parameters
obtained from ND and SANS from
samples that represent, statistically, the
population of pipelines on which the

forecasting tool will be used. Extended
parameters obtained from ND and
SANS include σx, σy, σz, RG, C, ST, and VF,
which are cataloged along with conventional inspection TEM and SEM parameters and the operating, installation, and
environmental conditions of both fresh
and exercised (aged) pipe materials.
Studying and characterizing deviations between fresh and exercised
samples yield a set of deviation patterns.
Characterization includes recording and
analysis of trend and inflexion points of
the data curves to determine possible
failure modes and remaining life.
The forecasting failure model considers material conditions, including
material composition, measured wall
thickness, corrosion level, presence
and amount of welded joints; operating conditions, including presence
and magnitude of applied forces, fluid
pressure, historical accumulated stress
(default value as a function of time),
fluid properties, corrosion inhibitor
chemicals, presence and magnitude of
mechanical vibration; and installation
conditions, including depth of burial,
soil load, coating type, and cathodic
protection, if any.
Environmental conditions considered
include soil type, seismic level, rain,
washouts, and maximum-minimum
ambient temperature values. ✦

OPEC blames rising
crude oil prices on
US ‘mismanagement’
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries drew ﬁrst blood in a spat with
US President George W. Bush.
After a Mar. 4 meeting with King Abdullah of Jordan in Washington, DC, Bush
reprised for reporters his January appeal
for more oil from OPEC (OGJ, Jan. 28,
2008, p. 72).
“I think it’s a mistake to have your big-

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

gest customer’s economy slow down or
your biggest customers’ economics slowing down as a result of high energy prices,”
Bush said the day before an OPEC meeting.
After OPEC met, leaving production
targets unchanged, President Chakib Khelil
blamed high oil prices on “mismanagement of the US economy.”
Khelil, Algeria’s energy minister, said:
“If the prices are high, deﬁnitely they are
not due to a lack of crude. They are due to
what’s happening in the US.”
While OPEC may be exercising more
caution than is necessary, Khelil is right.
Low inventories cited by the Bush
administration to demonstrate a need for
more OPEC oil don’t explain crude prices
above $100/bbl. They’re not that low.
Demand growth is slowing. Major production projects will come on stream this
year. Prices should be falling.
OPEC knows this and legitimately worries about a second-quarter demand slump
that might be deeper than usual.
Crude prices are high and rising not
because a weakening market has too little
supply but because oil, like other commodities, is serving as a haven for cash frightened away from other investments.
Much of that phenomenon does reﬂect
US mismanagement of its economy.
The housing credit ﬁasco shouldn’t have
happened. The US shouldn’t be aggravating
food-price increases by burning corn-based
ethanol for fuel. It should worry about runaway federal spending and the weakening
dollar. It should allow oil and gas leasing of
locked-up federal land.
And Bush should quit spouting impossible dreams that would be economically
ruinous to pursue.
“America has got to change its habits,”
he told a renewable-energy conference
Mar. 5. “We’ve got to get off oil.”
He wants more oil now but no oil later.
No wonder markets are shaky. No wonder
OPEC’s getting testy.

Fundamentals don’t support $105 oil
An unexpected drop in US crude inventories made front-month crude jump $5
to a record closing of $104.52/bbl Mar. 5 on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
although many of the industry’s biggest participants and closest observers reported
no new changes in either supply or demand to justify that ﬂy-up.
Crude prices climbed to new heights in the next trading session, driven not by
the ebb or ﬂow of oil but by the ﬂow of money from pension and hedge funds and
speculators into energy commodities. The market hit a high of $106.54/bbl Mar. 7 before closing at $105.15/bbl, down 32¢ for the day yet up $3.21/bbl for the week, after
the Labor Department reported 63,000 fewer US jobs during February, the biggest
drop in 5 years.
The US dollar dropped to a new low against the euro that same day. “The weak
dollar should make for a soft landing of demand erosion in non-dollar countries,”
said Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland, “but it will not create a demand
booster. With record high crude oil and record high gas oil crack as well as high
diesel premium, driving in Europe is not getting cheaper.”
ExxonMobil Corp. Chief Executive Ofﬁcer Rex Tillerson said the weak dollar,
geopolitical uncertainties, and speculation were equally responsible for the run up
in energy prices. Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
cited essentially the same market forces Mar. 5 in voting to maintain current production levels. They said the deepening credit crisis in ﬁnancial markets and a potential
economic slowdown in the US economy make it likely that world demand for oil will
decline in the second quarter.
Jakob said, “OPEC has proven again that the days when it was a market maker
are deﬁnitely over. The oil market is about ﬁnancial ﬂows, not oil ﬂows. The only way
for OPEC to regain its previous status would be to wake up today’s world and start
using futures to hedge its production.”
US inventories
The Energy Information Administration said crude inventories fell 3.1 million bbl
to 305.4 million bbl in the week ended Feb. 29, vs. Wall Street expectations of a 2.1
million bbl build. US gasoline stocks escalated 1.7 million bbl to 234.3 million bbl in
the same period, outstripping ﬁnancial analysts’ consensus of a 500,000 bbl gain.
Distillate fuel inventories for the same week decreased by 2.4 million bbl to 117.6 million bbl, vs. consensus of a drop of 1.9 million bbl.
Adam Sieminski, Deutsche Bank’s chief energy economist in New York, said,
“Price elasticity of demand is ﬁnally showing up in the data.” He said, “The real price
of gasoline in the US is approaching the peak last seen in March 1980. Along with
higher natural gas prices, rising electricity bills, and soaring expenditures for food,
gasoline use in the US is starting to feel the pressure of pinched consumer spending.”
Jakob said, “The fundamentals are still miles away from providing a clear justiﬁcation for the current price level.” He noted oil imports into the US “were suffering
from fog delays” during the reported period and that 2.4 million bbl of the 3.1 million bbl crude draw occurred in the isolated Petroleum Administration for Defense
District (PADD) 5, including the West Coast, Alaska, and Hawaii, “which in normal
days would be discounted.”
Jakob said, “The argument used to be that oil prices will rise until a top is deﬁned
by demand destruction. The [EIA] statistics are now showing US demand for the
4-week average down 1.1 million b/d from last year. Emerging countries running
on state subsidies can still have some growth, but it will not translate in much oil
demand growth on a worldwide basis. Given some of the fall in US oil demand is
coming more from the industrial sector (fuel and ‘other’ oils), the demand for the
main clean products (middle distillates, kerosine, gasoline) is still down 400,000 b/d
for the 4-week yearly comparison.”
Furthermore, Jakob said, “The dollar might be weak, but buying oil for the dollar
trade is getting so ampliﬁed that even on a dollar-adjusted basis, oil is [at a] record
high, which is of no relief to the nondollar consumer. WTI has gained 21% in 1 month
and newcomers on the long side [of the crude futures market] need to believe that
further gains are possible. Paradoxically, it is the fact that there is no compelling
fundamental story that is making a further rise possible, as then $105/bbl is just a
number that could as well be $120/bbl.”

COVER
US economic problems supplanted energy as the top issue in the
2008 political campaign’s final month. Many Washington, DCbased oil and gas industry association executives, however, maintain
that energy will be one of the biggest issues the next president and
Congress confront in 2009, as discussed in the special report, US
Elections and Energy, starting on p. 22. Association officials are
encouraged that both major presidential nominees’ energy positions
have evolved, but they also see hard work ahead as Congress and the
next president tackle taxes, regulatory reform, and global climate
change against a backdrop of economic recession.

General

Interest

Deutsche Bank updates oil, gas price forecasts
A research report released Oct. 3 by Deutsche Bank sees room
for oil prices to continue to decline.
“We believe crude oil prices have further downside as the fallout of the financial crisis spreads into the real economy and ultimately global oil demand. Like gold, we also believe the oil price is
trading rich relative to the US dollar, with the current euro/dollar
rate suggesting an oil price nearer $80/bbl,” the report says.
Over the last 2 years, 85% of the movement in the West Texas
Intermediate oil price is explained by shifts in the value of the dollar, the report says.
Deutsche Bank recently reduced its fourth-quarter 2008 and
first-quarter 2009 WTI price forecasts to $85/bbl. The price is
forecast to average $90/bbl in second quarter 2009.
The report notes that some other analysts are looking for oil to
move as low as $50/bbl, a price last seen in early 2007.
Analyst Adam Sieminski says that although $50/bbl oil is not
out of the realm of ‘reasonableness’ in view of recent history, it
seems unlikely in view of the consensus opinion that the Federal
Reserve will cut interest rates when it meets later this month.
Meanwhile, natural gas is forecast to average $9/MMbtu in the
final 2008 quarter and $8.50/MMbtu in first quarter 2009, rebounding to $9/MMbtu in the second quarter of next year.
Despite shut-in gas production in the Gulf of Mexico following
Hurricane Ike, gas in underground storage continues to climb, and
Deutsche Bank estimates gas is on track to reach 3,400 bcf by the
start of winter.
“Since many meteorologists are forecasting a colder-than-normal start to the US winter, we continue to believe that US natural
gas is trading cheap relative to oil,” Sieminski says.

House Republicans ask DOI for next OCS steps
With the expiration of US Outer Continental Shelf and oil shale
leasing moratoriums a day earlier, US House Republicans asked Interior Secretary Dirk A. Kempthorne on Oct. 2 to identify steps
Congress should take to ensure potential resources in reopened
areas are developed soon.

Exploration

&

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

“We are concerned by media reports that radical anti-energy
groups may, with the tacit support of the Democratic leadership, file a barrage of lawsuits to continue to deny the American
people access to these vital sources of American-made energy,”
Minority Leader John H. Boehner (Ohio), Minority Whip Roy
Blunt (Mo.) and seven more House Republicans said in a letter to
Kempthorne.
“We are also concerned by speculation that federal red tape and
bureaucratic hurdles exist that will prevent Americans from gaining quick access to these resources. Such delays would needlessly
hinder the creation of tens of thousands of good American jobs and
further slow our nation on its path to lower [gasoline] prices and
energy independence,” they continued. They asked Kempthorne to
promptly identify such barriers and potential litigation as well as
responsible actions which Congress might take to ensure that resources in the reopened areas “are fully and completely unlocked
in the most expeditious manner possible.”

California operator ﬁned for Lands Act violation
The US Minerals Management Service fined a California offshore oil and gas operator $450,000 on Oct. 7 for violating the
Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act following a multiyear investigation.
Pacific Operators Offshore LLC pleaded guilty and will also serve
5 years’ probation for using a gas lift line in direct contradiction to
an MMS order, the US Department of the Interior agency said.
MMS said it notified the Carpenteria, Calif.-based company,
which operates two platforms off the state’s coast, that the gas lift
line was not fit for service in 2000 and that its continued use posed
a significant workforce safety risk. MMS also said it notified POO
that if it intended to use the gas lift line in the future, it would need
to submit a repair plan for MMS’s approval.
In 2002, according to MMS, its inspectors determined that POO
was still using the gas lift line, and the agency referred the matter
to the DOI Inspector General’s office for criminal investigation. It
added that the US Department of Justice also participated in the
inquiry. ✦

Rift ﬂows gas at Puk Puk
London-based Rift Oil has flowed 29.2 MMcfd of gas during a
test in its Puk Puk-1 wildcat on Papua New Guinea permit PPL235
in the country’s Western Province.
The flow came from combined Toro Sandstone and Lower Hedinia pay intervals in the well. A separate flow from the Lower Hedinia measured 20.85 MMcfd.
Rift now plans to isolate these two zones and test the Upper

Hedinia zone in the structure. Once flow rates have stabilized, the
company also plans to use its onsite separator equipment to measure the liquids content of the gas.
Rift is particularly pleased with the Lower Hedinia flow rate
because it comes from thinner sands. The company adds that initial
flow rates from the Toro are in line with expectations from this
well-developed reservoir.
Testing at Puk Puk will be completed later this month. The com-

Processing
Total’s Provence reﬁnery upgrades to begin
Total’s 158,000 b/d Provence refinery at La Mede on the French
Riviera will undergo a €100 million turnaround of its western installations scheduled to last 2 months starting Oct. 6.
The eastern units will continue to operate, ensuring delivery
of products. A turnaround is slated every 5-6 years, but this one is
unusually significant.
Total indicates that it is “a real challenge” for the refinery with
60 projects earmarked in order to improve the safety of installations, reduce their environmental footprint, and optimize production. The major projects to be carried out include:
• The catalytic cracker furnace will be replaced, at a cost of
€12.8 million, in order to bolster the safety of the installation and
the workers, reduce by 15% the plant’s sulfur dioxide and carbon
dioxide emissions, and improve the refinery’s energy efficiency
while increasing the processing capacity of the installation by some
50 tonnes/day.
• The Alkylation visbreaker modernization will cost €8.7 mil-

lion. It will require 45 km of extra cabling to introduce 200 new
instruments and replace some 30 security valves.
• A new flare stack tip costing €1.2 million will reduce both
smoke and noise, achieving the modernization of both flares at the
refinery within the last 4 years.

ExxonMobil expands capacity at Singapore plant
ExxonMobil Chemical has completed a 130,000 tonne/year
(tpy) capacity expansion at its Exxsol hydrocarbon fluids plant in
Jurong Island, Singapore, increasing capacity at the site to more
than 500,000 tpy.
The capacity expansion will provide more of ExxonMobil
Chemical’s Exxsol series of differentiated fluids, and hydrocarbon
fluids, including its proprietary Isopar and Solvesso.
Exxsol said the fluids are formulated to meet a diversity of customer needs “in applications such as drilling mud oil, metal working, polymer processing, industrial cleaning, adhesives, coatings,
household products and mining.”

The new capacity is designed to meet demand in Asia Pacific,
which is growing at an estimated rate of 6% a year for differentiated hydrocarbon fluid products.
Increasing demand in Asia Pacific results from strong industrial
growth accompanied by rising awareness of health, safety, and environmental issues and the future consolidation of different regulatory requirements under the Globally Harmonized System (GHS).
Last November, ExxonMobil Chemical Co. said it would build a
second petrochemical complex on Jurong Island after completing
a detailed study. The petrochemical project will include a 1 million
tpy ethylene steam cracker, two 650,000 tpy polyethylene units, a
450,000 tpy polypropylene unit, a 300,000 tpy specialty elastomers unit, an aromatics extraction unit to produce 340,000 tpy of
benzene, an oxo-alcohol expansion of 125,000 tpy, and a 220-Mw
power cogeneration unit.
ExxonMobil awarded the design, engineering, procurement,
and construction contract for the steam cracker recovery unit to the
Shaw Group, while the contract for the steam cracker furnaces was
awarded to Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding and Heurtey.
Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding has also been awarded
contracts for the polypropylene and specialty elastomers units. The

contract for the two polyethylene units was awarded to Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries.
The chemical complex, scheduled to come on stream in early
2011, is expected to cost more than $4 billion. The complex—together with ExxonMobil’s 605,000 b/d refinery—makes the company Singapore’s single largest foreign manufacturing investor.

UOP advances crude upgrading technology
UOP LLC signed a technology cooperation agreement with
Petrobras and Albemarle Corp. to demonstrate and further commercialize its catalytic crude upgrading (CCU) process technology.
The agreement calls for UOP to provide the technology, equipment, and system design, and Albemarle is providing the FCC catalyst for the process. Petrobras has run the process in a pilot plant,
and will provide its knowledge and experience in FCC catalysts and
heavy crude processing.
UOP developed the CCU process in 2005 as an option for upgrading heavy crudes and bitumen-derived crudes. The process reduces the crude’s viscosity, which allows it to travel through pipelines without the use of diluents. ✦

Tr a n s p o r t a t i o n
Trinidad and Tobago vies to renegotiate contracts
Trinidad and Tobago has announced that it wants to renegotiate
the contracts for Atlantic LNG Co.’s (ALNG) Trains 1, 2, and 3.
Patrick Manning, prime minister of the Caribbean twin-island
nation, said his government is dissatisfied with the level of revenues collected from the gas producers that supply ALNG.
“It is clear that the circumstances have changed since the contracts for [ALNG’s] Trains 1, 2, and 3 were negotiated and Trinidad
and Tobago wants to get its fair share of the revenues,” the prime
minister said.
Manning will soon travel to Madrid, where he will meet with
the Repsol-YPF SA Pres. Antonio Brusfau. He will then visit London to hold discussions with BP PLC’s Chief Executive Officer Tony
Haywood and BG Group Chief Executive Officer Frank Chapman.
Manning will be accompanied by the Minister of Energy and
Energy Industries Sen. Conrad Enill and other senior technocrats in
the twin-island nation’s energy industry.
ALNG purchases gas from suppliers and sells freight on board
to customers from its Point Fortin port in respect of Trains 1, 2,
and 3. But in Train 4, ALNG operates as a processor of gas.

Inpex to construct LNG terminal off Indonesia
Inpex Corp., bowing to pressure from the Indonesian government and seeking to start deliveries of LNG to Japan as soon as possible, will likely construct an offshore export terminal at a cost of
more than ¥1 trillion. Inpex Pres. Naoki Kuroda said the Japanese
firm will make a final decision in 2-3 months, and is likely to sign
an agreement with Indonesia by yearend.
Inpex had two options for the terminal: to build on solid ground
in Australia and transport gas from Indonesia through pipelines, or
to build an offshore terminal inside Indonesian territorial waters.
Gas for the terminal would come from the Masela block, cur10

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

rently under development in the Timor Sea, where Kuroda owns a
100% stake. The Masela block lies 400 km from Darwin in northern Australia.
Indonesian officials, who made construction of the offshore
terminal a condition for Inpex’s Masela block project, said development could begin as early as November, assuming that a final
agreement was reached (OGJ Online, Sept. 4, 2008).
In July Inpex confirmed sufficient gas reserves to start 4.5 million tonnes/year of LNG production in the Masela block in 2016,
following its completion of a four-well appraisal program.
In August Inpex said it had decided to build an LNG regasification terminal in northwestern Japan to meet robust growth in LNG
demand, with operations to begin there in 2014.
The new Japanese receiving terminal is expected to be able to
handle around 500,000 to 1 million tonnes of LNG imports in its
first year of operation, and in excess of that afterwards, according
to Hisatake Matsuno, a director at Inpex.
Matsuno also said the terminal would receive LNG supplies
from Inpex’s own projects in Indonesia and Australia, where, with
partner Total SA, will build a facility to produce more than 8 million tonnes/year of LNG starting in 2014 in Darwin.
Desirous of starting LNG production as soon as possible to meet
the needs of the planned developments, Kuroda said that Inpex will
build the offshore terminal in Indonesia. Kuroda nonetheless said
that growing LNG demand and high LNG prices would make the
project worthwhile, offsetting its estimated cost of ¥1 trillion.
He said construction will be financed by bank loans and Inpex’s
own cash reserves, and that Inpex also will consider selling part of
its stake in the Timor Sea gas field to foreign energy companies.
The new terminal, which would secure up to 7% of Japan’s annual LNG imports, will provide some 4.5 million million tonnes/
year of LNG by 2015—all of it bound for Japan. ✦

Is CP worthless?

What kind of question is this?
Most in the pipeline industry
agree that cathodic protection
(CP) is the smart way to provide
backup corrosion protection on
underground pipelines.
But consider: If you use solid film
backed corrosion coatings, you may
be wasting money by adding CP to
the pipeline.
There is a common sense reason for
this statement. CP systems protect
pipelines by delivering electrical
current to the steel surface. Solid
film back corrosion coatings have
the property of resistivity, which
means they block electrical current.
This blocking effect is called
cathodic shielding.
The phenomenon of cathodic
shielding, or blocking of protective
CP current, has been the subject of
dozens of technical papers since the
mid 1980’s. You can review a cross
section of these papers on
Polyguard’s website.You can also

Phone: (1) 214.515.5000
www.polyguardproducts.com

view a 10 minute explanation of the
cathodic shielding process.
Worldwide, we estimate that over
half of pipelines are being coated
with solid film back coatings, such as
shrink sleeves, tapes, and 2 or 3 layer
systems. Most of these lines have CP
systems. These are the operators who
may be wasting their money on CP.
Moreover, many install shielding
coatings on girth welds, the most
vulnerable area for corrosion.
Two corrosion coatings are proven
to be non-shielding, and allow
passage of protective CP currents.
One of these coatings is FBE. The
other is Polyguard RD-6.
NACE SP0169-2007 states: “Materials
… that create electrical shielding
should not be used on the pipeline” 1.
49 CFR §192.461 states:
“External protective coating …must
…have properties compatible with any
supplemental cathodic protection.” 2

If you are concerned that your
organization is behind this curve, we
recommend:
1. Visit
polyguardproducts.com/failsafecoating.htm
and review the large body of information
about shielding problems.
2. Talk to operators who have used
Polyguard’s RD-6 system. (There are
many) Ask them if they know of any
serious corrosion or SCC ever found
under RD-6. (We don’t, even after 19
years and thousands of installations).
3. Have someone in your organization attend
the NACE course “Coatings in Conjunction
with Cathodic Protection”.

1. NACE SP0169-2007 “Control of External
Corrosion on Underground or Submergeed
Metallic Piping Systems”.

An unprecedented rebuke
While addressing mortgage debt deemed “toxic” in a desperate effort to rescue the US economy,
Congress somehow saw fit to raise toxicity of the
political climate for oil and natural gas. The message is chilling: A government willing to launch
lifeboats for American business has only torpedoes for the industry that meets 65% of American
energy needs. It’s chilling but not, after 2 years of
mindless demagoguery on energy, surprising.
After terrorizing equity markets by rejecting on
Sept. 29 the $700 billion rescue that Treasury Sec.
Henry Paulson proposed for a financial industry
suffering from sclerosis, Congress resorted to the
political graft with which it has earned itself a
place in history for depth of public disapproval.
It fattened up the bail-out package, basically the
public purchase of housing loans no one else will
buy, with giveaways that would look expensive if
not hitched to an already mind-numbing federal
commitment. When the economic going gets
tough, Congress piles on pork. The House passed
the historic package on Oct. 1, the Senate on Oct.
3, when President Bush signed it into law.

Vote-buying goodies
One of the vote-buying goodies was an energy
bill that got nowhere when introduced last spring.
The Energy Improvement and Extension Act of
2008, now enshrined as Division B of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, extends and
expands tax credits and other subsidies for energy
forms preferred by Congress but not markets, such
as wind, geothermal, solar, marine renewables,
and, of course, biofuels. There’s even a “transportation fringe benefit” for bicycle commuters.
With oil and gas, the measure isn’t so generous.
In fact, it’s altogether peevish. It singles out the
oil and gas industry for tax increases from which
other industries are spared. That this can occur in
a bill designed to rescue the American economy is
appalling.
The tax hikes aren’t unintended by-products
of clumsy wording or organizational complexity.
They’re unmistakably deliberate.
One of them denies access to a scheduled tax
benefit by companies that produce, refine, process,
transport, or distribute crude oil, natural gas, or
20

oil products. The American Jobs Creation Act of
2004 introduced the manufacturer’s tax deduction
to help American companies compete internationally after exporters lost a tax break challenged
successfully by the European Union. The deduction rate began at 3% of net income in 2005, grew
to 6% in 2007, and is scheduled to reach 9% in
2010. For oil and gas companies, the rate now
stays at 6%.
Use by oil and gas companies of the manufacturer’s deduction has been subject to crass misrepresentation. Lawmakers have been disparaging
“$18 billion in tax breaks for the oil industry,” all
but $4 billion of which is the 10-year value to oil
and gas companies of the manufacturer’s deduction, which is anything but a break for one industry. Now it’s a benefit worth less to oil and gas
companies than to the US companies with which
they compete for capital.
Beyond that, the new law reduces the amount
of foreign taxes that oil and gas companies can
deduct in calculations of US income tax and probably will expose production earnings in some
places to double taxation. It also raises the Oil Spill
Liability Trust Fund tax from 5¢/bbl to 8¢/bbl
through 2016 and 9¢/bbl in the expiration year of
2017.

Hostility
The combined bite of these tax hikes won’t
be great—perhaps $8-9 billion over 10 years in
an industry in which the largest 27 companies
paid $90 billion in income tax alone in 2006. It’s
still money that can’t be invested in new production, refining capacity, or other essential elements
of future oil and gas supply. Any suggestion that
forgone domestic supply contributes to economic
health is preposterous.
Worse than the dollar amount is the industryspecific hostility that undergirds the tax hikes.
A capricious change in the terms of oil and gas
investment is bad enough for a country whose
huge energy needs are impossible to satisfy with
politically pampered alternatives. But punishing
oil and gas in an otherwise palliative law is an
unprecedented rebuke. ✦

US economic problems dominated
the 2008 presidential campaign as the
two major nominees prepared to meet
in their second debate last week. But
energy still was a major issue.
“Our economy is still hurting. Working families are worried about the price

complained to members of the 110th
Congress. By late summer, as Democrats
and Republicans held their national
conventions, federal lawmakers in both
parties were talking about increasing
access to domestic oil and gas supplies
as well as developing alternatives. Then
the financial crisis hit.

cosmetic, Cavaney said. For starters,
the most easily recoverable crude is
within 50 miles of the coast, which the
House’s bill would have placed offlimits. Coastal states not only deserve
a share of the revenues but also could
use offshore energy production as a
way to attract new industry. “It will be
necessary for lawmakers to grasp that
pushing production deeper will require
rigs that are produced overseas instead
of domestically,” API’s president said.

and gasoline prices climbed. “The challenge is to translate this into a resource
base and infrastructure to deliver these
supplies. It’s incumbent on us to convince Congress that gas is not produced

Donald F. Santa said.
“I think there’s a perception among
some members of Congress that we
don’t need to do anything about gas,
and that it will always be there,” added
Martin E. Edwards, INGAA vice-president, legislative affairs. He said that the

when capital came off the table and
moved overseas. Both presidential nominees want to make major tax reforms.
Obama has supported bringing back a
windfall profits tax. McCain hasn’t, but
would like to do a major tax overhaul,”
said Lee O. Fuller, IPAA vice-president,
government relations.
Congress also remains ready to consider cap-and-trade proposals, he continued. “It could be approached more
cautiously. A lot of voices from the
global climate debate’s economic side
weren’t engaged last time. The ultimate
reduction target could be scaled back
to 60% from 80%, and the pace could
be slower so the general economy isn’t
disrupted as badly,” he said. Back-door
regulation through the Endangered
Species Act and National Environmental
Protection Act also is possible, he said.
All this will put more pressure on
gas, Fuller said. “This past year, US
production increased 9%, largely from
onshore shale formations and the Gulf
of Mexico. Now, we’re seeing orchestrated efforts to characterize hydraulic
fracturing as a threat to New York City’s
drinking water. In its 150 years, fracing has one of the best environmental
records. But it could become more
political in areas which do not have oil
and gas production experience,” he explained. The US will need to be careful,
if it opens more of the OCS for leasing,
to not create litigation routes parallel to
onshore public acreage, he added.

but many are short-handed and underfunded, he said.

“Given
today’s political
environment,
would the US
have been
able to build a
nationwide railroad network
in the 19th
century or to

system in the
1950s?”

Other changes
Fuller said the retirements of US Sen.
Pete V. Domenici (R-NM), Rep. John
E. Peterson (R-Pa.), and other federal
lawmakers with extensive oil and gas
experience also will have an impact
on a Congress that already has developed energy bills through the majority
leadership instead of committees. One
of the few panels that produced a major
energy bill this year, the House Natural
Resources Committee, came out with
the so-called “Use it or lose it” bill a
year after it tried to place constraints
on oil and gas development, the IPAA
official said.
Several association executives apparently expect Democrats to increase
their majorities in both the House and
Senate. But they also noted that bipartisan energy initiatives materialized in
both congressional bodies this summer.
“The problem with the bill developed
by what initially was a US Senate “Gang
of 10” that eventually became a Gang
of 20 was that it contained a little
bit of everything and not enough of
anything,” said Cavaney. He was more
impressed with what Peterson and
Rep. Neil Abercrombie (D-Ha.) accomplished with their House bipartisan
energy working group.
Bigger Democratic majorities
wouldn’t necessarily make onerous
oil and gas legislation inevitable in a
new Congress because new members
conceivably could include more moderates, the two INGAA officials suggested.
“They’ll need to deal more with supplies along with greenhouse gas issues,”
said Santa.
“I think solutions will need to be
more bipartisan, with both parties supporting a package. John McCain has a
history of reaching across the aisle on
controversial issues. Barrack Obama’s

approach is almost a more Socratic
method that’s intellectually focused.
He could be better at the long-term
response than the short-term steps,”
said Edwards.

Positions evolve
Both considered it significant that
each major presidential nominee’s energy positions have changed since they
began seeking the office. “Even Obama’s
position with respect to OCS access has
evolved from a few months ago, when
he seemed to think it was not important,
to where he believes it needs to be part
of a comprehensive plan,” Santa said.
“It’s almost unreasonable to criticize
a candidate for changing his position
on such an important issue. You can argue that this is what rational people do
as they learn more,” Edwards added.
Cavaney agreed. “From our industry’s
perspective, if you look at the big patterns, both candidates are in a different
place on oil and gas than when their
candidacies began. That speaks well for
them. They listen to their advisors and
to voters. As they say in sports, and it
can be transferred to politics, it’s all
about momentum. Oil and gas will end
the year in a better position than where
it began,” he said.
“I think both campaigns realize the
importance of energy. It’s something
they’ll have to address. But there will
be other issues, and it won’t be apparent how they’ll be approached until the

The Tasnee ethylene plant in Al-Jubail, Saudi Arabia, achieved on-spec ethylene
production on August 23, 2008 following mechanical completion on July 15, 2008,
which is six weeks ahead of schedule.
The plant which was built for Saudi Ethylene and Polyethylene Company (SEPC) by
the consortium Linde Engineering and Samsung Engineering Co. Ltd., with Fluor as PMC,
has a capacity of 1 MM MTA.
This remarkable success was achieved due to outstanding execution by Linde and
Samsung in a difcult environment with a shortage of qualied manpower and tight
markets for material and equipment supply. The cracker of SEPC, a joint venture of
Tasnee, Sahara and Basell, is the rst cracker to come on stream several months ahead
of other cracker projects in Saudi Arabia which were also awarded in 2005.
With this success Linde and Samsung clearly demonstrate their leading position in
technology and project execution in the Middle East.

Russians: ‘Kazakhs want to use ESPO pipeline’

Transneft Chief Executive Nikolai

The pipeline will supply about
220,000 tonnes of oil to the Angarsk

Electrifying news
for Bodman & Co.

US

Energy Sec. Samuel Bodman
seems a little behind the
times when it comes to alternative
fuels and the interests of carmakers.
Last week, Bodman released a
study by the Department of Energy
showing that cars can run on gasoline with a much higher ethanol
component than the 10% blend
now being sold at pumps across the
US.
Bodman said that 13 different
“late-model” cars were tested using
gasoline that was 15% and 20%
ethanol, and the results were “very
encouraging.”
The US corn lobby was pleased to
hear the results. Tom Buis, president
of the National Farmers Union,
called the DOE study results “good
news.” He’s also on record as saying,
“America’s farmers are ready, willing, and able to play a vital role in
reducing our dependence on foreign
oil.”

Courting farmers
After all, ethanol is made in the
US from corn, and ethanol demand
is assuming a growing importance
in the farming industry. A higher
ethanol blend in gasoline would
mean stronger demand for the cornbased fuel by gasoline producers.
It would also reduce demand for
“foreign” oil.
To his credit, Bodman cautioned
that more research on a wider variety
of vehicles is necessary to determine
whether the results of the study
could be sustained more broadly.
With due respect to Bodman, Buis,
and other people locked into the current US presidential campaign—and
desirous of capturing the farmers’
32

votes in November—one wonders
whether they might also look at
expanding the kinds of fuel to be
studied. After all, cars do not run on
ethanol alone.
In fact, some automakers now
believe that cars of the future will
be driven by electricity. Consider the
statement by Volkswagen AG Chief
Executive Martin Winterkorn: “The
future belongs to the electric car—
with power from the socket.”

The future is electric
The biggest European car maker
by sales is testing the Golf TwinDrive,
in which an electric powertrain supports a diesel motor. The company
also wants to introduce a purely electric model of its “Up!” small car.
Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz cars
unit plans to build an electric version of its Smart car from the end
of 2009, while Mitsubishi Motors
Corp. plans to launch a mass-produced electric vehicle next year in
Japan.
Would these developments en
mass affect the oil and gas industry?
Well, yes. Gasoline demand could decrease dramatically. And an all-electric
car has no gearbox, valves, clutch,
muffler, or exhaust and requires no
spark plugs, no filters, and—no oil.
Developments of this sort really
should be occupying the minds of oil
and gas industry thinkers. What is the
likelihood of their coming to fruition
and how, in detail, will they affect the
industry?
In an election year, though, it
seems that about all the US energy
secretary can think of are the number
of votes the corn lobby can muster
up. ✦

withdraw had been mounting in parliament. Opponents argued that a net oil
importer would not gain anything from
membership, which was costing €2
million/year in membership fees.
The government had formulated a
plan in 2007 to develop a number of
new oil fields to take crude oil output
back up to 1.3 million b/d by 2009.

Cepu development delays
Reaching that target is becoming
unlikely, however, particularly because
of delays in developing the Cepu Block
holding the country’s largest untapped
oil field, which could yield 180,000
b/d.
Besides Cepu in central Java, Indonesia has many promising untapped oil
fields, including Jeruk field offshore,
with 50,000 b/d potential in East Java
Province, and other offshore oil fields
within the country’s territorial waters.
And in West Papua Province, Korea National Oil Corp. discovered one
of the largest oil fields in Indonesia
in 2007. It has estimated reserves
of 671 million bbl and could yield
150,000-200,000 b/d.
Another government plan is to boost
crude oil output to 1.2 million b/d
from 950,000 b/d by 2012 in cooperation with such overseas firms as Brazil’s
state-owned Petroleo Brasileiro SA.
However it is uncertain whether such
partnerships will be created.
Nevertheless, South Korean, Russian,
and Chinese oil companies, including China National Offshore Oil Corp.,
as well as Western oil majors such as
ExxonMobil Corp. and Chevron Corp.
are showing a positive stance toward
developing crude oil and natural gas
fields in Indonesia.

Lack of leadership
According to the Nikkei report,
however, crude oil development has
been impeded by the Yudhoyono government’s lack of leadership and rising
nationalism surrounding the country’s
natural resources.

of energy and mineral resources, like
Suharto regards oil and gas as Indonesia’s main means of gaining foreign
currency.
Yet he is unable to control internal
strife directed at interests in the government and Pertamina, or at growing
resource-related nationalism among
parliamentarians.

T E R E S T
Although it runs the country, Yudhoyono’s Democratic Party is a minority party accounting for only 10% of
parliamentary seats.
Opposition parties such as the
Islamic party argue that oil and natural
gas should be supplied preferentially
to domestic users at prices lower than

international levels. Overseas oil companies oppose such a stance.
An executive at a Western oil company said that although Indonesia has
abundant oil and gas resources, there
are few negotiations on development
projects. The reason, he believes, is the
absence of a strong chief executive officer like Suharto. ✦

US independents report cuts to drilling budgets
Sam Fletcher
Senior Writer
Chesapeake Energy Corp., Oklahoma
City, along with Petrohawk Energy
Corp. and ATP Oil & Gas Corp., both of
Houston, are cutting their drilling budgets and focusing on their best prospects due to the deteriorating economy
and declining demand.
Chesapeake, the second-largest
independent and third-largest overall
gas producer in the US, is slashing its
drilling capital expenditure budget by
$3.2 billion, or 17%, for the second
half of 2008 through 2010. Company
officials blamed a 50% drop in natural
gas prices since June and a possible gas
surplus.
Petrohawk said it will cut its 2009
capital budget by a third and focus on
those projects “with the highest internal
rates of return and highest potential for
reserve growth, namely, development in
the Haynesville and Fayetteville shales.”
ATP Oil & Gas plans to cut more than
$200 million from its capital expenditure budget for the rest of 2008 and
2009.
Analysts in the Houston office of
Raymond James & Associates Inc. expect
other firms to lay down rigs as well.
“We continue to see reduced drilling
activity (lower rig count) as necessary
to balance the natural gas market. Still,
this may lead to the decline in activity
about a quarter earlier than we anticipated,” they said.

Chesapeake’s plan
Chesapeake’s budget cut includes
$800 million attributable to the drilling capex carry in the firm’s recently
formed Fayetteville shale joint venture
with BP America Inc. Chesapeake closed
that 25% joint venture with BP PLC on
36

Sept. 19 for $1.1 billion cash plus $800
million funding by BP of Chesapeake’s
75% share of drilling and completion expenses in that program through
2009.
The budget reduction also includes
$500 million for the anticipated drilling
capex carry in a Marcellus shale 25% JV
that the company expects to complete
by the end of this year. However, the
bulk of the cut, $1.9 billion, represents
a rollback in drilling activity, reducing
its current count of 157 operated rigs
to 140 rigs by yearend. Chesapeake then
expects to keep its rig count relatively
flat in 2009-10.
“This should not be considered
good news for domestic land drillers
given that Chesapeake does not typically lay down its own rigs,” Raymond
James analysts warned. Nomac Drilling Corp. in Oklahoma City belongs to
Chesapeake.
Moreover, Raymond James noted,
“This does not seem to be a fundamental savior for gas prices since Chesapeake still plans to increase its production by 16% year-over-year despite 11%
less rigs.”
Chesapeake lowered its production growth forecasts to 16%/year for
2009-10 from 19% previously. The
company said its production growth
will remain near the top of its large-cap
peer group because of continued strong
drilling results from its shale plays. In
September, Chesapeake completed three
horizontal Haynesville shale wells with
average initial production exceeding
10 MMcfd of gas equivalent per well,
bringing its total horizontal Haynesville
shale wells on production to 14.
Analysts said, “Companies tied to the
production enhancement side of the
business may be a bit better off due to
the service intensive nature of the new

shale plays, but with numerous wells
expected to be shut in and capacity
coming online, 2009 is shaping up to
be an ugly year in North America.”
Chesapeake temporarily is curtailing part of its unhedged natural gas
production in the Midcontinent region
due to “unusually weak wellhead prices
substantially below industry breakeven
costs.” It has shut in 100 MMcfd of
net gas production (125-150 MMcfd
gross), representing 4% of its current net production of 2.3 bcfd of gas
equivalent (92% gas). Officials said they
will restore this production when the
market recovers from recently depressed
wellhead price levels of $3-5/Mcf.
The company reduced its 2008
production growth estimate to 18%
from 21% to account for production
curtailment, sale of 45 MMcfd of gas
equivalent production associated with
its joint venture with BP, the anticipated
sale of 60 MMcfd of gas equivalent
in the fourth quarter associated with
Chesapeake’s fourth volumetric production payment, and shut-ins of onshore
production due to gas processing plant
limitations resulting from Hurricane
Ike.
Chesapeake recently resumed plans
to sell a minority interest in its midstream natural gas business to institutional investors, with the projected $1
billion proceeds to fund a portion of
the costs associated with building the
midstream infrastructure in various
shale plays, primarily in the Haynesville
shale. As part of that move, Chesapeake
is transferring all of its midstream
natural gas assets outside of Appalachia,
primarily of gas gathering systems and
processing facilities, into new partnership entities managed by Chesapeake
Midstream Partners LP.

reductions, Chesapeake expects to generate $2 billion excess cash in 2009-10
that will be directed primarily to debt
reduction.
Chesapeake has focused on exploratory and developmental drilling and
corporate and property acquisitions in
the Midcontinent, Fort Worth Barnett
shale, Fayetteville shale, Haynesville
shale, Permian basin, Delaware basin,
South Texas, the Texas Gulf Coast, the
Ark-La-Tex region, and the Appalachian
basin.

Petrohawk’s actions
Petrohawk sliced its budget to $1
billion for drilling, completions, seismic
exploration, and facilities, down from
$1.5 billion previously. Officials said the
change affirms the company’s strong
capitalization. The firm has “no current plans or need to access the equity
capital markets,” they said. Petrohawk’s
undrawn credit facility was increased to
$1.1 billion from $800 million Sept. 10.
In addition, the company is looking to divest some conventional assets
in the Permian basin next year. These
properties include interests in Waddell
Ranch, Sawyer, Jalmat, and TXL fields
of West Texas and southeastern New
Mexico. The Permian basin properties
currently produce 35 MMcfd of gas
equivalent.
Even with the budget reduction,
Petrohawk expects a production growth
of 25-35% in 2009. It reaffirmed a
third quarter guidance of 310-320
MMcfed.
Petrohawk will emphasize development of nonproved locations in its
successful Haynesville and Fayetteville
shale projects and expects higher overall
reserve growth potential. It projects
that its production will grow 25-35%
through the drill-bit in 2009 from estimated 2008 production of 305 MMcfd.
The Haynesville shale sits 11,000 ft
underground in East Texas and northwestern Louisiana. The Fayetteville shale
play is east of Little Rock, Ark.

Peterson’s
energy legacy

US

Rep. John E. Peterson (R-Pa.)
could take pride in watching Outer Continental Shelf oil and
gas leasing moratoriums expire Sept.
30. He also is realistic enough to
know that more work must be done,
even though he is leaving Congress at
yearend.
“Seven years ago, when I began
the fight to open up our vast offshore
energy reserves, I could count on
one hand the number of supporters,” he said Sept. 24 after the House
approved a continuing resolution to
keep the federal government running
through Mar. 6, 2009, and abolished
more than 20 years of federal OCS
leasing bans.
“As the days and years passed,
the American people began to
understand this issue and realized
the United States Congress was the
number one obstacle impeding
the expansion of domestic energy
production. Today, their voices were
heard,” Peterson said.
Allowing the bans to expire
should only be the beginning, he
continued. “Congress needs to create
an environment where scientists and
entrepreneurs can work together and
create next-generation energy sources
like coal-to-liquids, coal-to-gas, and
the reprocessing of nuclear waste
so we can end our dependence on
imported oil and transition to a clean
energy future,” he said.

that members of Congress continue
to work across the aisle and find reasonable and effective solutions to the
energy crisis,” he said.
This member of Congress practiced what he preached. Peterson and
Rep. Neil Abercrombie (D-Ha.) cosponsored bills for several years to lift
the OCS leasing moratoriums. They
went farther in 2008 and established
a bipartisan energy working group.
Its proposed legislation would have
funded alternative and renewable
energy research and development
with part of the revenues from new
OCS leasing.
Their bill attracted more than 170
cosponsors by mid-September, including key members of committees
that would have had jurisdiction over
it. It was ignored by both parties’
House leaders.

Locked-in positions

“They were locked in political
positions and didn’t think they could
move. The people in our group came
in with more-flexible approaches because they wanted to come up with a
solution,” a staff member for one of
the cosponsors told me.
In remarks on the House floor
Sept. 24, Peterson urged House members not to follow the last three US
presidents or the past 14 Congresses

NGSA: No change in wholesale price pressure this winter
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Pressure on domestic wholesale
natural gas prices this winter heating
season will mirror last year’s because
producers have drilled more wells, and
technology has helped them improve
recovery rates, the Natural Gas Supply
Association said in its annual forecast
on Oct. 2.
“This winter season, we believe that
all the combined market forces (slightly
warmer than normal weather, stagnant
economic growth, moderate growth
in overall demand, near-record storage
levels and a healthy supply) will cause
flat price pressure on the gas market
compared to last winter,” said NGSA
Chairman Patrick J. Kuntz, who also is
vice-president of gas and oil sales at
Marathon Oil Co.
He said US gas production is
expected to be nearly 8% higher this
winter than a year earlier, based on
an independent analysis by ICF International of Fairfax, Va., which NGSA
commissioned. “Explorers and developers responded to the market signals,
and companies are producing more
domestic gas. Current production rates
are at their highest level since the early
to mid-1970s,” Kuntz told reporters at
a briefing.
Technology also is playing a significant role, he continued. “Much of our
38

increase in domestic gas production
is coming from unconventional plays
where technological advances have unlocked the resource. Horizontal drilling
is another big advance that allows more
gas to be produced from a single well,”
he said.
NGSA forecasts that 31,530 wells
will be completed during the 2008-09
heating season, 753 or 2.4% more
than the 30,777 completions during
the same period a year earlier. Average
production is expected to climb 7.9%
year-to-year to 57.5 bcfd from 53.3
bcfd, while the annual average rig count
is expected to rise 4.4% to 1,535 from
1,470.

Less gas from Canada
The forecast also projects a 6.25%
decline in US imports of Canadian gas
to an average 7.5 bcfd from 8 bcfd during the 2007-08 winter heating season.
“While we are expecting to import less,
supplies from Canada continue to play
an important role in supply during the
winter heating season,” Kuntz said.
The combination of increased
domestic gas production and higher
global market prices for LNG suggests
that the US could lose LNG volumes
to countries willing to pay more this
winter, he indicated. US LNG imports
normally average 1-1.8 bcfd each winter, Kuntz said. NGSA’s forecast calls for
a 25% year-to-year increase to 1 bcfd

from 800 MMcfd.
“But the important takeaway is that
rising US gas production and domestic
supply is a direct and positive response
to market signals, enabled by the advances in technology. This resulted in
downward pressure on the gas market
for the winter season,” Kuntz said.
He also warned that higher domestic
onshore production, while encouraging, also involves unconventional gas.
“It’s in its infancy. I don’t think it’s going to solve our problems. We’re going
to have to rely on a variety of sources,”
he said.
More gas from domestic offshore deposits will be needed because onshore
unconventional supplies will be costly,
Kuntz continued. “It could be a bigger
part of the solution than we realize, but
we shouldn’t foreclose other opportunities,” he said.

Different challenges
With much of this new onshore
production occurring in regions with
little previous experience, state government regulators and producers may
encounter unexpected problems, Kuntz
said. “I don’t think there’s nearly the gas

of storage entering the 2007-08 winter
heating period. “This year, we understand that another 100 bcf of storage
capacity is being built,” Kuntz said.
The forecast also calls for a 2.4%
year-to-year increase in overall US
winter heating season gas demand to an
average 78.5 bcfd from 76.7 bcfd a year
earlier. Kuntz said that Energy Ventures
Analysis Inc. of Arlington, Va., predicts
in its demand outlook prepared for
NGSA that the most growth will occur

in power generation, where it expects
gas-fired generating capacity to grow
33% year-to-year to 6.9 Gw.
“If it weren’t for the slowing
economy and evidence of commercial
and residential conservation, our projections for overall demand could likely
be higher. But as it stands, the 2.4%
increase in demand doesn’t meet our
threshold, and therefore our expectation is that pressure on prices will be

P L O R A T I O N

Reliance Industries Ltd., Mumbai,
and Niko Resources Ltd., Calgary, began
a new chapter in India’s hydrocarbon
production with the startup of MA oil
field in the Krishna-Godavari basin in
the Bay of Bengal.
Crude oil output began on Sept. 17,
2008, at the early rate of about 5,000
b/d of 42° gravity crude. The field, in
8,000 ft of water on the KG-D6 block
50 km off Kakinada, is expected to
reach target peak production of 40,000
b/d of oil in a few months.
Exploration on the 7,645 sq km D6
block is far from complete, however,
and further exploratory drilling is
planned in Niko Resources’ 2009 fiscal
year that began Apr. 1, 2008.
Development of giant Dhirubhai 1
and 3 gas fields on the same block is
substantially complete, and gas production is to start in the third calendar
quarter of 2008.
Phase 1 development cost is estimated at $5.2 billion.
Conceptual studies are under way
for the development of eight other gas

L O P M E N T

discoveries on the D6 block adjacent to
and to be tied back to Dhirubhai 1 and
3 gas fields.
Dhirubhai 1 and 3 gas fields are
expected to reach combined production
of 2.8 bcfd of gas in the first year. The
facilities are designed with capacity to
increase output to 4.2 bcfd. The government established a pricing formula
that will result in a sales price of about
$4.20/
MMbtu.

that MA oil field:
• Is India’s first deepwater hydrocarbon producing area.
• Produces a grade of oil that can be
processed at any refinery in India.
• Has been placed on production in
the 30th month after its discovery, making it one of the world’s fastest greenfield deepwater developments.

Initial field development cost is estimated at $1.5 billion.
Niko Resources also noted that
production was “achieved against
challenges like difficult ocean conditions, lack of adequate subsea data, low
seabed temperature of 5° C., severe
supply chain constraints, and shortage
of technical manpower.”

mooring system, insulated manifold,
and short, flexible flow lines.
Aker Solutions ASA manufactured
and delivered the field’s subsea production system and managed the subsea
equipment installation (OGJ Online,
Sept. 23, 2008). Both the subsea system
and FPSO were delivered less than 16
months after the award of the contracts.

Rift Oil PLC reported a flow of 29.2
MMcfd of gas during a test in its Puk
Puk-1 wildcat on Papua New Guinea
permit PPL 235 in the country’s Western Province.
The flow came from combined
Cretaceous Toro sandstone and Jurassic
Lower Hedinia pay intervals in the well.
A separate flow from the Lower Hedinia measured 20.85 MMcfd.
Rift now plans to isolate these two
zones and test the Upper Hedinia zone
in the structure. Once flow rates have
stabilized, the company plans to measure the liquids content of the gas.
Rift is particularly pleased with the
Lower Hedinia flow rate because it
comes from thinner sands. The company adds that initial flow rates from the
Toro are in line with expectations from
this well-developed reservoir.

Testing at Puk Puk (the term is
Pidgin English for crocodile) was to be
completed later in October. The company is also running a 210 line-km 2D
seismic program in the area.
A strong final result will enhance the
company’s plans for supplying gas to a
floating LNG plant in the Gulf of Papua
via an onshore-offshore pipeline from
the discovery.
Rift recently signed a heads of agreement with Norwegian company Flex
LNG to jointly develop Rift’s onshore
gas reserves in PNG via the floating
facility.
Rift also has a nonbinding memorandum of understanding with aluminium company Alco to supply about 40
bcf/year of gas to Alcan’s alumina plant
at Gove in Australia’s Northern Territory
for 20 years. ✦

Eni tests gas from Argo-2 well off Sicily
Eni SPA plans to develop on a fasttrack basis its offshore discoveries in the
Sicilian Strait following test results of
170,000 cu m/day of natural gas from
the Argo 2 well. The well is 20 km off
Agrigento in 500 m of water.
The results confirm the adjacent Argo
1 gas discovery well drilled in 2006.

Eni also found gas in deeper water in
Argo 2. Panda and Cassiopeia fields are
also nearby, and Eni plans to link them
under its development plan.
In August Eni tested 190,000 cu m/
day of gas from the Cassiopeia 1 well in
560 m of water 22 km off Agrigento.
Cassiopeia’s reserves are estimated at 16

billion cu m.
Eni said the Sicilian Strait area potential is an estimated 18 billion cu m
recoverable.
Eni is operator of Argo 2 with a 60%
share, and its partner Edison SPA holds
the remaining 40%.
Eni said the Argo 2 discovery will
increase its 200,000 boe/d equity production in Italy. ✦

Nido Petroleum ﬁnds
oil off Philippines
Nido Petroleum Ltd., Perth, said its
Yakal-1 wildcat in SC54 of the Northwest Palawan basin off the Philippines
has encountered a 66-m gross oil
column.
No definitive oil-water contact has
been determined.
Nido will evaluate the find with a
logging suite and fluid sampling to
clarify the extent of the column below
1,839 m.
The jack up rig WilBoss drilled
Yakal-1 to 1,975 m TD. Yakal-1 is the
first exploration well drilled in the area
in the past decade. The drill site is in the
northeastern part of SC54 south of the
producing Malampaya gas and oil field.
Nido holds a 60% interest, and joint
venture partner Kairiki Energy has the
remaining 40%. ✦

Brunei
Field work has begun in support of a
350 sq km 3D seismic survey in eastern
onshore Brunei, said Loon Energy Inc.,
Calgary.
The survey is to be finished by the
end of 2008 on 550,000-acre Block
L. It covers most of eastern Brunei and
involves some offshore shooting.
Nations Petroleum SE Asia Ltd. is
conducting the survey as part of its
commitment to fund the first $20.5

DEEPWATER OPERATIONS CONFERENCE AND EXHIBITION
November 3 – 5, 2008 | George R. Brown Convention Center | Houston, Texas

SUCCEEDING In A Changing Environment
As the industry shifts to deeper water, the environment in
which we work becomes more complex, hazardous and
expensive. Successful companies recognize early the
changing conditions and environmental challenges facing
the industry. At the Deepwater Operations Conference &
Exhibition in 2008, participants and attendees will discuss
how to succeed under these extreme conditions.

Plan to attend, sponsor and exhibit at the 2008 conference
and exhibition as the technical focus shifts to “Succeeding
in a Changing Environment.” As with our past conferences,
proceedings will not be published and the press will not be
invited to assure conﬁdentiality between the attendees and
the speakers allowing the most up–to–date information to
be shared.

Worldwide, the company will drill 24
exploration and appraisal wells in shortterm; 7 of these in Australia.6
Bass Strait is one of the company’s
four “base producing areas” worldwide.
After nearly 40 years, BHP Billiton
“achieved record winter gas sales.”
BHP has 32.5% of Kipper project, 80
MMcfd natural gas and 10,000 bo/d
condensate development (gross). The
company has executed subsea contracts
and anticipates startup in 2011. On July
25, BHP sanctioned Turrum gas field
development in the Bass strait; BHP has
50% and will spend $625 million.6
In Western Australia, BHP has 41
permits, with working interests from
8.3-100% on 9.2 million acres (gross),
in water depths 170-2,500 m. Recently
BHP had two major discoveries in the
Exmouth area: Thebe and Scarborough.
Stybarrow FPSO and subsea well
project in 2,707 ft water depth began
production in November 2007. BHP
operates Stybarrow (50% working
interest). The project has record-setting
single well flow rates of 32,000 bo/d
and sustained gross production of
80,000 bo/d.
Also in WA, BHP has 71.43% of the
Pyrenees project in water 820 ft deep.
The company expects 96,000 bo/d and
60 MMcfd gas. With the FPSO conversion underway, startup should be firsthalf 2010.
In the future in Western Australia, the
Macedon project in Exmouth area will
require subsea wells and a gas plant.
BHP has 71.43%. There are also three
LNG projects planned: Thebe, Scarborough, and Browse.
In the North West Shelf JV, the fifth
LNG train (T5) is due by late 2008 and
BHP has 16.67%.
Angel is a 800 MMcfd and 50,000
bo/d condensate development. Topsides
are installed; expect start-up by yearend
2008 (BHP, 16.67%).
North Rankin B project is a 2.5-bcfd
gas facility, sanctioned in March 2008.
BHP has 16.67% and start-up is expected in 2012.

Central Petroleum
South Perth-based onshore explorer
Central Petroleum Ltd. has a seven-well
2008 drilling program. The company is
analyzing results of its first well in the
frontier Pedirka basin of Central Australia, contiguous with the Cooper basin.
Log results suggest that the Blamore-1 hit a Permian coal sequence that
was four times thicker than expected.
The Permian sequence of coals seen
at Blamore-1 will be further tested in
CBM well 93001, the next well to be
drilled.

Chevron
Chevron Australia Pty. Ltd. has been
in Australia for more than 50 years.
The company operates Gorgon and
Wheatstone projects, Barrow Island and
Thevenard oil fields, and is a founding
partner of the North West Shelf Venture.
The company is now offering engineering contracts for the Barrow Island
and Thevenard Island projects.
In early September, Chevron announced a $400 million commitment
to an exploration program off Western
Australia aimed at finding more natural
gas for its planned LNG plants.

ConocoPhillips
Several companies are pursuing new
gas developments in the Timor Sea
to feed into Darwin LNG. The TimorBonaparte basin drilling programs
include:
• ConocoPhillips’s Barossa and Caldita fields in Timor basin.
• Caldita field, 265 km northwest of
Darwin is being appraised. The Caldita-2 well was drilled to 3,973 m in
2007; there are new 3D seismic surveys
over Caldita and Barossa structures.
The Bayu-Undan field was discovered 1995, 500 km northwest of
Darwin, in Timor Sea. It has expected
reserves of 3.4 tcf gas and 400 million
bbl of condensate and LPG.
The development will require a
wellhead platform, a central production
and processing complex, an FSO, and
a 500-km pipeline to ConocoPhillips’s
Darwin LNG plant at Wickham Point in

Darwin Harbor. The project life is 25
years and will require 22 wells; 12 are
already drilled.

Coogee Resources
West Perth-based Coogee Resources
Ltd. has assets in the Timor Sea and
Bonaparte basin. It began a 4-year,
11-well drilling program in late 2007.
The company has postponed drilling
its exploratory Wisteria well off northwest Australia until next year. It needed
the West Atlas jack up for installation
work at its Montara project, which
includes Montara, Skua, and Swift-Swallow oil fields. The development plan for
Montara includes nine wells, six already
drilled in Phase 1, and three in Phase 2,
to be completed in third-quarter 2009.7

Cooper Energy
On Sept. 10, Cooper announced
that it would recommence its drilling
program in the Cooper basin in early
December, after securing the Ensign
No. 30 rig. The company will drill two
low-risk exploration wells in PEL92,
targeting the Gunyah and Perlubie
prospects. These are slightly south of the
Parsons-2 well in recently discovered
Parsons oil field.
TD for the Gunyah-1 is 2,050 m and
the well will cost $1.8 million (Aus.).
TD for the Perlubie-1 is 1,796 m and it
will cost $1.6 million (Aus.).

Empire Oil & Gas
Perth-based Empire Oil & Gas NL
shifted the drilling site for the longdelayed Lake MacLeod-1 well in the onshore Carnarvon basin, Western Australia. The well, in the Gascoyne subbasin,
was about to spud in mid-September.

New software moves distributed-temperature sensing data

Production

Shell has developed open standards
software to fill the gap of moving
distributed-temperature sensing (DTS)
data from the wellsite to the engineer’s
office desktop. The software, known as

the DTS database, translates DTS data
simply and effectively into a database of
temperature vs. depth.
Many different industries have used
distributed temperature sensing (DTS)
for years. The technology uses a fiber
optic cable installed along or around
the object observed. In production
operations, the fiber is installed along a
wellbore within a control line clamped
to the tubing. A light box installed at the
beginning of the fiber contains a laser
that sends light pulses into the fiber. The
light box then records the light as it

bounces back from the fiber.
A part of the back-scattered light is
temperature dependent and determining the average spectrum at different
depths provides a means for obtaining
the temperature along the object.
The fiber provides temperature readings at about 1-m intervals with a wide
range of sample frequencies ranging
from 30 sec to many hours. The number
of light pulses used in calculating the
spectrum dictates the accuracy of the
temperature measured.
Fig. 1 illustrates a typical fiber cable
installation and resulting temperature
profile for a gas lifted well.

stream, transferred electronically to the
engineer’s desktop, provides timely well
status.

Prior to Shell’s rollout of the DTS
database architecture, existing data
handling systems had limitations. The
systems gathered wellsite data in a
proprietary file format and periodically transferred it to a remote, foreign
server.
A proprietary process digested and
manually interpreted the data, while
a foreign database stored the data. To
access the data, engineers logged into
a website that displayed graphically the
processed and partially interpreted data.
Engineers lacked confidence in data
quality because of:
• Inability to precheck the raw DTS
data.
• Uncertainty whether the service
provider validated the raw data.

• Uncertainty about which data the
service provider processed.
Additional concerns included:
• Data security. To access data, third
parties needed to penetrate firewalls
into the potentially vulnerable processcontrol domain.
• Data ownership. Data stored on
foreign databases and computers were
out of company control and potentially
noncompliant with related company
standards
• Data formats. Dependence on proprietary data formats limited the possibility of prechecking data.
• Data analysis. Lack of appropriate
visualization tools limited data analysis.
Consequently, the operators were
motivated to develop internal data acquisition, processing, visualization, and
storage systems.

DTS data-handling changes
Shell defined a DTS data-handling
architecture to overcome the previously mentioned problems (Fig. 2). It
resolved security issues by having the
software comply fully with associated
Shell data security. The new architecture
and security standards led to supplier
independent data transfer and storage.
This decoupled the DTS hardware from
data handling, visualization, and interpretation.
The net effect enables selection of
“fit for purpose” elements from different suppliers without changing the
associated data-handling systems. It also
allows for clearly defined and managed
data ownership. With this architecture,
engineers have access to raw data and
can develop interpretation skills to
translate the data into valuable assessments.
This architecture thus incorporated
two key elements:
1. An industry-wide standard for
DTS data exchange.
2. A database for storing DTS data.

data exchange. POSC was an industrywide organization that defined oil and
gas industry data and data exchange
standards. Prominent standard examples
are the wellsite information transfer

used in drilling and the production
markup language (PRODML) currently
under development.
POSC has reorganized under the

DTS measurements provide voluminous data. The

a compression algorithm that

perature could cause enough temperature change to trigger storage of traces.
Additionally, one can configure the
algorithm such that it stores data in a
minimum interval, separate and distinct
from temperature change.

The database provides several ways
for extracting data (Fig. 3). One way to
extract data to a spreadsheet uses open
database connectivity (ODBC), with
features such as:
• Plotting temperature vs. fiber
length.
• Playing temperature development
in time as in a movie.
• Plotting multiple traces in one
graph.
• Showing temperature development
in time at a selected depth.
• Zooming capabilities in fiber
length and temperature.

means for viewing DTS data. It illustrates the temperature at different time
steps for a shut-in well.
One can also view DTS
data in the database with

Due to variability in the various
methods used to determine chemical
hydrogen consumption in pilot-plant
testing, however, all three methods discussed in this article should be used.
The chemical analysis method can
provide some insight into where and
how much H2 is consumed in the various reaction classes and the effects of
processing conditions such as pressure,
temperature, and space velocity. A properly designed and executed pilot-plant
testing program can determine hydrogen consumption within ±2 normal cu
m/cu m (±12 scf/bbl).
Obtaining an accurate estimate of
the hydrogen requirement for the
design of a grassroots or revamped
diesel hydrodesulfurization (HDS) unit
is important given the current global
refining environment. There have been
substantial increases in the capacity and
operating severity of diesel HDS units
worldwide in recent years.
In response to tightening of sulfur
and other specifications of diesel fuels,
many refiners have built or plan to
build grassroots diesel HDS units and
almost all refiners have revamped or
plan to revamp existing units (OGJ, Oct.
23, 2006, p. 28). Consequently, the
consumption of hydrogen has increased
substantially.
With today’s natural gas prices,
hydrogen consumption can account
for more than 80% of the variable

operating costs of a diesel HDS unit.
It is therefore important to obtain an
accurate estimate of the hydrogen requirement when designing a grassroots
or revamped diesel HDS unit.
And because the hydrogen requirement is strongly dependent on the feedstock and design conditions, conducting pilot-plant tests using the design
feedstock is important.
Several different methods can
determine the chemical hydrogen
consumption in pilot-plant testing.
This article compares chemical H2
consumption calculated by various
methods and discusses advantages
and shortcomings of each and their
applicability to commercial diesel
HDS and other hydroprocessing units.

Measuring H2 consumption

In a pilot-scale diesel HDS test unit,
as in a commercial HDS unit, Equation 1 (see attached Equation box) can
represent the hydrogen balance. Two
commonly used methods for determining chemical hydrogen consumption, in
mass per unit time, are represented in
Equations 2 and 3, which derive from
Equation 1.
The first method (Equation 2)
requires measuring flow rates and
hydrogen content in the feed and TLP
as well as flow rates and compositions,
such as light hydrocarbons, H2S, H2O,
and NH3, in all offgas streams. The second method (Equation 3) requires only
the flow rates and H2 analyses of the
makeup gas and all offgas streams.
Because hydrogen consumption is
commonly expressed as N cu m/cu
m (normal cu m of hydrogen/cu m
of oil, at 0° C. and 1 atm) or scf/bbl,
Equations 2 and 3 can be rearranged to
calculate the volumetric H2 consumption per unit volume of oil feed.
For example, Equations 4 and 5 can
determine hydrogen consumption in N
cu m/cu m.
In addition to these two methods,
one can determine total chemical
hydrogen consumption by calculating
the sum of the stoichiometric hydrogen consumption for each class of

Results comparison
In pilot-plant testing, the most
common method used to determine
chemical H2 consumption is Equation
4, which requires measuring H2 in the
feed and TLP. This method is accurate,
for any single data point, to about ±10
N cu m/cu m or 60 scf/bbl, due to

of feed and liquid and gas products,
however, can add to variability in the H2
consumption determination.
To assess the variability of hydrogen consumption results calculated by
other methods, we compared results
of Method 2 (Equation 5) and Method
3 (Equations 6-11) against those from
Method 1 (Figs. 1a and 1b).
Fig. 1a compares H2 consumption by
gas analysis (Equation 5) with that of
feed-TLP-H-content method (Equation
4). Although the bias (represented by
the slope of the curve of 1.03 vs. the
parity line) is good, H2 consumption
from gas analysis varies significantly vs.
that of the feed-TLP-H-content method.

The variance, represented by an R2 of
0.723, is poor and the standard deviation of 20.7 N cu m/cu m (123 scf/
bbl) means that the gas analysis method
is unacceptable as a replacement for the
feed-TLP-H-content method.
This is understandable because H2
consumption calculated from Equation 5 is based on the small difference
between mass flow rates in the makeup
gas and offgas streams. Accuracy of the
mass flow measurement of the offgas
stream is usually poorer relative to flow
measurements of feed or makeup gas.
This problem is exacerbated due to
the varying composition of the offgas
streams, which may contain various

amounts of light hydrocarbons (C1-C5)
as well as H2S, NH3, and N2 obtained at
different treating severities. Calibrating
the feed hydrogen and offgas meters at
the beginning of the run eliminates any
bias.
Fig. 1b compares H2 consumption
by chemical analysis method, Equations
6-11, with that of the feed-TLP method.
Agreement between the two methods,
represented by a curve slope of 0.999,
is excellent and the variance (R2= 0.926
with a standard deviation of 8.7 N cu
m/cu m or 52 scf/bbl) is reasonable.
The H2 consumption by the chemical
analysis method is therefore an acceptable alternative to the feed-TLP method.

Although the increase in

not seem to dramatically
reduce the product sulfur
level to less than 100 ppm
(wt) (Figs. 2a, 2b, and 3), it
does significantly improve
other diesel product qualities, such as
increased cetane index and reduced
density (Fig. 4). This improvement in
diesel quality primarily results from
increasing conversion of polyaromatics
and monoaromatics (Fig. 5).
Hydrogen consumption is a strong
function of feed quality and operating pressure (OGJ, May 15, 2006, p.
48). The extent of aromatic saturation
is much greater at a higher pressure
and lower space velocity of ULSD units
designed for aromatic feeds.
The combination of more-severe
conditions and higher feed aromatic
content gives much higher hydrogen
consumption. Depending on the relative
values of hydrogen and diesel, the volume swell that results from polynuclear
aromatic and aromatic saturation during the production of ULSD might not
fully offset the cost of hydrogen that is
required for aromatic saturation.

Cetane additives can improve the

specifications except cetane number.
Cetane increases of 5-10 numbers are
possible at treatment costs of about 0.1
¢/gal-cetane number.
Actual cetane uplift and treatment
costs depend on the composition and
base cetane of the diesel fuel; therefore,
actual costs are site-specific. Its effectiveness decreases and cost increases
as dosage level is increased. The use of
a cetane improver additive is often a
more cost-effective way of increasing
diesel cetane than aromatic saturation.

is H2 that is lost through mechanical
leakage from the makeup and recycle
gas compressors, i.e., packing vents and
seals.
Depending on the unit’s design,
solution and mechanical losses may be
10-20% of the total H2 consumption;
purge losses are under operator control. Purging minimizes the buildup of
light hydrocarbon gases as well as H2S
for units without an amine absorber.
Typical losses for purging range from
3% to 20%, depending on makeup gas
H2 purity, H2 consumption, and H2S
levels in the recycle gas, with higher
purge losses for units without an amine
absorber.

from polyaromatics to monoaromatics depends strongly on the reactor’s
operating pressure and catalyst type.
The single-ring aromatics are much
more difficult to hydrogenate to cyclic
saturates. All of the reaction steps are
reversible.
For typical diesel feeds, multiring
aromatics may contain up to 4-ring
aromatics, depending on the cut point.
To estimate H2 consumption for all
polyaromatics to monoaromatics, we
assumed a stoichiometric H2 consumption (molar ratio of H2 to hydrocarbon)
of 3.3. For monoaromatics to cyclic
saturates, we used a stoichiometric H2
consumption of 3.0.
Equation 11 calculates the total H2
consumption by aromatics saturation.

• Total double bonds in feed, kg =
1,000 * (BRf /100) * SGf.
• Total double bonds in TLP, kg =
1,000 * (BRp /100) * SGp * TLP yield.
• Total double bonds removed, kgmole = 1,000 / 100 * SGf * [(BRf) –
(BRp * SGp / SGf * TLP yield)] / 159.8.
• Total H2 consumed, N cu m =
22.41 (cu m/kg-mole) * total H2 consumed, kg-mole.
Equation 10 is then used to calculate
total H2 consumed by olefins in N cu m

Similar experiments appear to fit the

test in any line pipe material in common usage.

Modiﬁed equation
The usefulness of a closed-form solution for predicting defect failure pressures in pipes makes it worth having a
modified Ln-Sec equation which avoids
the deficiency described in Part 1 of this
article. Developing an improved Ln-Sec
equation would seem to entail altering
the original equation so the ln-sec correction becomes defect-depth dependent. When the depth of the defect is
zero, the correction should converge to
a value of π/2.
Equation 1 is the original Lu-Sec
equation. If corrected properly for a
defect of zero depth, Equation 1 would
default to Equation 2, and the predicted failure pressure for any length
of zero-depth defect would be the
burst pressure of the pipe. For depthto-thickness ratios greater than zero,
the inverse Ln-Sec correction should
decrease from a value of π/2 at depthWT = 0, causing only small corrections to defects with depth-WT ratios
greater than 0.4.
Equation 3 would seem to do this,
yielding the predicted hoop stress at
failure.
Comparing the modified Ln-Sec
equation to the set of full-scale experi-

rate of 6 mils/year (0.006 in./year), 60
mils of growth would take 10 years, the
remaining life of the defect.
Repeating this process for defects of
other lengths (2 in., 4 in., 6 in., etc.)
yields the times to failure shown in
the accompanying table. Remaining
life stands as practically independent
of defect length for defects longer than
√Dt and integrity assessment to 100%
SMYS guarantees about 10 years. A
prudent operator will, of course, prevent the remaining life from running
out, instead scheduling remediation.
A widely accepted practice suggests
remediation when half the remaining

New software suite aids sesimic computing efﬁciency
Newly released CUDA 2.0, the latest version of C language programming
environment for graphics processing units,
enables software developers to tap into the
massively parallel architecture of the GPU
for the acceleration of complex computational problems.
This latest production release of the
CUDA software suite includes support for
32 and 64-bit Windows Vista and Mac
OS X as well as 3D textures and hardware
interpolation to increase the efficiency of
seismic computing.
Also included in CUDA 2.0 is an Adobe
Photoshop plug-in example for PC and
Mac versions of the software. The example
allows developers to design plug-ins that
move the most compute-intensive functions of Adobe Photoshop to the GPU, such
as filtering and image manipulation. The
plug-in is available as source code so developers can easily develop advanced filters
and imaging techniques that are available
directly within Adobe Photoshop.

THE DEEPEST SHOW ON EARTH
March 3 - 5, 2009
Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center | San Antonio, TX

SUBSEA TIEBACK
FORUM & EXHIBITION

PennWell invites you to the 9th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition. SSTB has become the premier
event for one of the fastest growing sectors of the offshore oil and gas industry. This year’s SSTB is scheduled
for March 3 – 5, 2009 in San Antonio, TX at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center. Over 2,500 people and
150 exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference. You can’t afford to miss it.
This year’s theme is “The Deepest Show On Earth.” As our industry changes, the sharing of knowledge and
collective experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety, and economics of the
subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by industry leaders. As in the
past, only by participating in this conference will you be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will
not be published and no Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room stays inside the conference
room. We hope you will join us.

US can raise tax
revenue by cutting
corporate tax rate
Political discourse in the early 1980s
treated “tax rates” and “tax revenue” as
synonymous phrases. As they grapple with
a new century’s economic problems, policymakers must not repeat the mistake.
It was common in those years long gone
to hear US lawmakers lament growth of the
federal deﬁcit and to proclaim the need to
“raise revenue.” By that they meant “raise
tax rates,” terminology much less likely

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

to elicit political support and much more
likely to provoke a ﬁght with the Republican
administration then newly in ofﬁce.
Indeed, the administration of Ronald
Reagan adhered to the insight, popularized
by Arthur Laffer, that when tax rates are
high, lowering them can increase government tax receipts.
Many politicians scoffed at the notion.
Some still do.
A new report by Mehreen Younis, research assistant at the National Center for
Policy Analysis, Dallas, argues that history
supports Laffer’s notion and calls for a cut
in the corporate tax rate.
“Most countries have found that tax revenues rise following cuts in their corporate
tax rates,” Younis writes.
Citing Cato Institute data, the analyst
reports that while the average corporate
tax worldwide fell from 46% to 33% during
1982-99, income tax collections rose from
2.1% of aggregate national income to 2.4%.
Similarly, the average corporate tax rate
in 19 member countries of the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development fell from 45% in 1985 to 29% in 2005.
In that period, corporate tax revenue rose
from 2.6% of the group’s gross domestic
product to 3.7%.
Alex Brill and Kevin Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute have estimated
that the revenue-maximizing corporate rate
in developed countries was about 34% in
the late 1980s but has declined to about
26%, according to Younis.
The US corporate tax rate is 35% at the
federal level and 39.25% with the addition of average state levies. The latter rate
is second among developed countries to
Japan’s 39.54%.
To stimulate its faltering economy and
move back toward ﬁscal balance, the US
should cut the corporate tax rate—quickly.
Doing so is not the same as cutting revenue.

September crude prices fall
Front-month crude plunged $10.52/bbl Sept. 29 as the House of Representatives
rejected a $700 billion plan to resolve the most severe threat to the US economy
since the Great Depression.
It was “a painful reminder that there is one thing more inept and selﬁsh than a
banker in New York: a politician in Washington, DC,” said Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland.
Still, the surprise move accomplished one thing politicians had been promising
to do all year—it brought down oil prices in the second-largest 1-day drop ever in
the New York futures market, surpassed only by a $10.56/bbl loss in January 1991
during the early success of Desert Storm. But the equity market was hammered even
harder, with the S&P 500 Index suffering its biggest drop since the 1987 stock market
crash. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted a record 777 points. Stock
losses on the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 Index totaled $1.2 trillion.
Crude rebounded above $100/bbl Sept. 30 as the US Senate revived and sweetened the rescue plan. “The dollar index was under an extreme rally, the rest of
the commodity complex was under pressure, published demand data points were
weaker than expected, but oil against all odds managed to make strong gains,”
Jakob noted.
September ended with crude prices down almost 13% for the month and 28.1%
lower for the expiring third quarter, also the biggest decline in that category since
January 1991. Even so, the average crude price was still up 5% for the year.
Crude prices dipped below $100/bbl Oct. 1 as the Energy Information Administration reported US crude inventories gained 4.3 million bbl to 294.5 million bbl in the
week ended Sept. 26, surpassing the Wall Street consensus of a 2.4 million bbl build.
Gasoline stocks increased by 900,000 bbl to 179.6 million bbl, below average for
the time of year. Wall Street was anticipating a drop of 1.7 million bbl. Distillate fuel
inventories fell 2.3 million bbl to 123.1 million bbl, surpassing an expected decline of
1.6 million bbl.
Below January prices
Energy prices continued to fall with the front-month crude contract tumbling
lower than price levels at the start of the year and world demand at the lowest level
in 5 years. The November contract of benchmark US light, sweet crudes dropped to
$93.97/bbl Oct. 2 on the New York Mercantile Exchange vs. a closing price of $99.62/
bbl for the front-month contract Jan. 2, the ﬁrst day of regular trading for 2008. Another front-month contract hit an intraday low for the year of $90.51/bbl Sept. 16.
Jakob described the steep sell-off as “the case of the commodity house turning
into a slaughter house.” He said, “Commodities across the board were under severe
pressure. A depressive recession is not the best climate for the commodity theme,
but Sept. 30 was also the cut-off date for [yearend] redemptions for many hedge
funds.”
Energy prices continued to decline Oct. 3 for the third consecutive session of the
New York market even as the US House of Representative passed the revised $700
billion economy rescue plan.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed in early trading that day and was up
more than 300 points as House members began to vote. But that gain was wiped
out among rising fears that the rescue plan won’t unfreeze credit markets. US stock
indexes fell for a third consecutive day, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down
7.4% for the week.
That same day Swiss bank UBS AG announced it is reorganizing its investment bank and closing most of its commodities business, with a loss of 2,000 jobs
because of the ﬁnancial crisis. The world’s biggest wealth manager, UBS announced
a small proﬁt in the third quarter after a year of losses. Its US subprime mortgage
exposure in the US earlier forced the ﬁrm to write down $42 billion.
The US economic rescue package “might provide some short covering,” Jakob
said. “But the gasoline crack trading below $1/bbl is an indicator of the poor state of
the oil markets. US reﬁning margins remain at risk, and this can only translate into
lower crude oil demand and oil being pushed back to the producers. On a dollar adjusted basis, the price of crude oil is however probably not yet low enough for Saudi
Arabia to panic.”
Meanwhile, the US dollar hit a 13-month peak vs. the euro after the European
central bank said it was willing to cut rates for the ﬁrst time in 5 years.

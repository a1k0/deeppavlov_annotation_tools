Deepwater Fracturing: It’s Make or Break Time

Internal breakers make a big difference
Net present value (NPV) of today’s assets can depend on the fracture proppant pack.
The more conductive the proppant pack, the more productive the well.
Diamond FRAQ™ HD Nonionic Viscoelastic Surfactant (VES) Fracturing Fluid is the only highdensity VES fracturing fluid with internal breakers. 100% regained proppant pack
conductivity is twice as much as other high-density frac fluids. That’s enough to double well NPV.
That’s not all. Diamond FRAQ also offers these value-added benefits.

Bush urges Congress to lift bans on OCS leasing
US President George W. Bush urged Congress to lift oil and gas
leasing bans on the Outer Continental Shelf as the first of four steps
to increase domestic supplies in response to soaring prices.
“Experts believe that the OCS could produce about 18 billion
bbl of oil. That would be enough to match America’s current oil
production for almost 10 years. The problem is that Congress has
restricted access to key parts of the OCS since the early 1980s,”
Bush said on June 18.
“Since then, advances in technology have made it possible to
conduct oil exploration in the OCS that is out of sight, protects
coral reefs and habitats, and protects against oil spills. With these
advances and a dramatic increase in oil prices, congressional restrictions on OCS exploration have become outdated and counterproductive,” Bush said.
Bush also asked Congress to authorize oil and gas leasing within
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, remove a moratorium on the
development of a federal oil-shale leasing program, and expedite
permitting for new US refineries or expansion of existing ones.
But Bush’s call to end OCS drilling bans produced the strongest
responses (OGJ Online, June 17, 2008).

SEC staff advises updating reserves reporting
US Securities and Exchange Commission staff members have
recommended that the commission consider updating its oil and
gas reserves reporting requirements, the commission reported in a
June 12 news release.
The commissioners have yet to consider and vote on the proposal. Current SEC reserves requirements were adopted more than
25 years ago. The recommended proposals would allow oil and gas
companies to provide more reserves information to investors, the
release said.
John White, director of the SEC’s division of corporation finance, said that there are “tremendous changes in the way reserves
are measured and oil and gas companies do business” that are not
yet reflected in reserves reporting rules.
Details of the staff recommendations were not provided in the
news release. Late last year, SEC solicited comment on whether

changes in the reporting requirements were needed and appropriate.
The commission received 80 comment letters, generally supportive of updating the requirements.
The American Petroleum Institute said June 13 it intended to
review the recommendations and then will comment if needed.
Large reserves writedowns by some oil and gas companies in
2004 rekindled debate about how companies estimate reserves,
what regulators worldwide require of companies, and how investors use the information.
Adjustments are a normal part of reserves reporting but disclosure policies drew close attention after Royal Dutch/Shell Group
reclassified its reserves estimates five times in a little over a year
(OGJ, Feb. 21, 2005, Newsletter).
Reserves estimates and reporting standards have been the subject of much industry discussion (OGJ, June 20, 2005, p. 20).

OPEC maintains world well-supplied with oil
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, in its latest
monthly oil market report, reiterates its position that the world is
well-supplied with oil.
The organization’s current forecast for 2008 OPEC crude demand stands at 31.8 million b/d, higher than other agencies’ forecasts but still below its current production of 32.2 million b/d.
Expected higher OPEC oil exports and the planned halt in the
filling of the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve should help to increase excess supply and further build commercial inventories, the
report says.
Further, the market outlook says that current production levels combined with additional crude supply of 300,000 b/d from
Saudi Arabia starting this month will lead to a higher-than-normal
stockbuild in the third quarter and a contra-seasonal inventory
build in the fourth quarter of this year.
“This clearly demonstrates that the market is amply supplied
and that claims that the recent surge in prices is due to a supply
shortage are unjustified,” OPEC reported.
The reasons behind the recent oil-price surge were to be the
focus of discussions at a June 22 meeting of producers, consumers,
and other stakeholders in Jeddah. ✦

US drilling hits new 22-year high
The US rig count during the week ended June 13 topped 1,900
working units for the first time in more than 22 years.
Baker Hughes Inc. reported 1,901 rotary rigs drilling in the US,
15 more than the previous week and up from 1,773 during the
same period a year ago. The last time the rig count surpassed that
level was during the week ended Jan. 3, 1986, when 1,915 units
were working.
As usual, land operations accounted for the bulk of the increase,
up 15 rigs to 1,808 drilling. Offshore drilling increased by 4 rigs
to 68 in the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in a net increase of 2 rigs to
68 on all offshore federal leases. Inland waters activity was down
2 rigs to 25.
Among the rigs now working, 1,504 are drilling for natural
gas, 389 are drilling for crude, and 8 are unclassified. Directional
drilling increased by 10 rigs to 380. Horizontal drilling declined
by 1 rig to 547.

Odfjell is operator of the rig, which is owned by Songa Offshore ASA. The rig has worked on the field since 2005 and will
continue to 2011. The contract with StatoilHydro includes an option for one more year, extending the contract period until the first
quarter 2012 if the option is exercised.
Troll holds 60% of the country’s total gas reserves on the Norwegian continental shelf, and in 2002 the oil production was
more than 400,000 b/d. Production is expected to last another
70 years.

ERCB sees rise in Alberta CBM output

Alberta’s coalbed methane production could reach 640 bcf/year

Valero resolves CWA violations after 2006 oil spill
Valero Refining Texas LP has agreed to resolve alleged violations of the Clean Water Act stemming from a June 1, 2006, spill
of 3,400 bbl of oil into the Corpus Christi Ship Channel, which
flows from Tule Lake into Corpus Christi Bay and into the Gulf of
Mexico.
Under the consent decree lodged in federal court in Corpus
Christi, Valero will pay a $1.65 million civil penalty and perform a
supplemental environmental project that will cost $300,000. Under the agreement, the project will require Valero to design and
construct a boat ramp that will aid emergency-response efforts in
the vicinity of the oil spill.
The government’s complaint, filed along with the consent decree, alleges that at least 142,800 gal of oil spilled from a containment berm on the edge of the Ship Channel at Valero’s Corpus Christi Refinery-West Plant into the channel. Valero has since
removed the containment berm and the associated above-ground
storage tank from the edge of the Ship Channel in order to prevent
future oil discharges.
The penalty paid for the spills will be deposited in the federal
Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, which is used to pay for the federal
cleanups of oil spills.

IAG lets contract for CCRL reﬁnery expansion

International Alliance Group (IAG) has awarded a detailed design services contract to Mustang Engineering for the Consumers’
Cooperative Refineries Ltd. (CCRL) $1.9 billion refinery expansion
project in Regina, Sask. (OGJ, Nov. 5, 2007, Newsletter).
IAG is the program manager for the grassroots portion of a proposed refinery expansion that would increase capacity to 130,000
b/cd from a current capacity of 100,000 b/cd.
In 2007, Mustang completed front-end engineering design for
the project. Detailed design will take more than 600,000 man-hr
of work to complete, according to Mustang.
Mustang’s automation and control business unit is providing
detailed design, configuration, staging, and integration of the process control system for five new process units and supporting utilities.

called for completion of the refinery during 2015-16.
“Negotiations are under way with Spanish, UAE, Kuwaiti companies and other firms, with the view of building the second refinery,” the ministry said.
Energy and Mining Minister Mohammed Boutaleb said, “Part
of the new refinery output would be destined for exports to Asian,
North American, and European markets.”
The existing 136,000 b/d Samir refinery, at Mohammedia north
of Casablanca, is owned by Corral Holding, a Swedish company
controlled by Sheikh Mohamed Al Amoudi of Ethiopia.
Reports say Samir is working on a modernization scheme valued at more than $530 million to introduce hydrocracking technology and the latest refining processes.
Last July, Morocco’s L’Economiste newspaper also reported that
Samir, Casablanca-based diversified holding company Akwa Group,
and Morocco’s state-owned Office National de l’Electricite will
build a 5 billion cu m LNG regasification terminal either in Tangiers or Jorf Lasfar.
L’Economiste said the gas would be piped to industrial centers

at El Jadida and Kenitra for the production of electricity in combined cycle power plants and for the refining industry. It also said
the LNG terminal could be connected to the Maghreb-Europe pipeline GME, linking North Africa with the Iberian peninsula.

Costs derail Petronas’s planned Sudan reﬁnery
Malaysia’s Petronas has deferred plans for its 100,000 b/d refinery project in Sudan due to rising costs, according to a senior
company official.
The Sudanese government had awarded Petronas a contract to
build the refinery at Port Sudan on the Red Sea in 2005, with output from the refinery to be exported. The refinery, which would be
jointly owned 50:50 by Sudan and Petronas, was due to come on
stream in 2009 (OGJ, Sept. 12, 2005, Newsletter).
However the cost of the refinery has soared to $5 billion from
the originally estimated $2 billion.
“We cannot justify its commercial viability because of the very
high investment cost,” said Petronas Pres. and Chief Executive Officer Tan Sri Mohd Hassan Marican. “We have to put it aside for
now,” he said. ✦

Yemen LNG secures ﬁnancing, sales contracts
Yemen LNG has obtained $2.8 billion in financing for construction of its LNG liquefaction plant on the Gulf of Aden at Belhaf,
including $1.1 billion from Total SA and $1.7 billion from export
agencies in France and South Korea.
Altogether, eight banks—BNP Paribas, Societe Generale, Calyon,
ING Bank, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, SumitomoMitsui Banking
Corp, Royal Bank of Scotland, and Citigroup—acted as mandated
lead arrangers for the $1.1 billion part of the package, and Coface
of France, Kexim of South Korea, and various export agencies guaranteed the remaining $1.7 billion.
JGC, Technip, and KBR in September 2005 received a contract to
build the two-train liquefaction plant, which will have a capacity
of 6.7 million tonnes/year, as well as a 320-km pipeline and two
144,000-bbl storage containers. The project will receive gas from
Block 18 in Marib.
Yemen LNG has signed long-term contracts to supply South
Korea’s Kogas with 2 million tonnes/year, Suez with 2.55 million
tonnes/year, and Total Gas & Power with 2.15 million tonnes/
year.
French major Total is the project leader with a 39.62% share. Its
partners in the project are US-based Hunt 17.22%, the Yemen Gas
Co. 16.73%, SK Corp. 9.55%, Kogas 6%, Hyundai Corp. 5.88%, and
Yemen’s General Authority for Social Security and Pensions 5%.

Sakhalin-2 loan secured; year-round ﬂow to begin
The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and four
private-sector banks are finalizing plans to provide a $5.3 billion
loan for the Sakhalin-2 oil and natural gas development project.
Japan’s Nikkei newspaper reported that JBIC will lend about
$3.7 billion, with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., and BNP Paribas providing the remaining $1.6 billion.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

The financial institutions were scheduled to sign a lending
agreement with Russia’s OAO Gazprom as early as June 15. Gazprom partners, Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Mitsui & Co., and Mitsubishi
Corp. have already committed about $15 billion to the project.
JBIC and the three major Japanese banks plan to offer financing
for the project to support efforts by Japan’s public and private sectors to obtain a stable source of energy, the paper said.
The financing announcement followed reports last month that
year-round production will begin from the Sakhalin-2 project this
summer.
“The current plan is to start year-round production in the second half of 2008, after commissioning and testing of the pipeline
has finished,” said Ivan Chernyakovsky, a spokesman for the consortium.
Oil will then be transported along the 800-km pipeline to an
ice-free export terminal on Sakhalin Island’s southern tip. The project produces 80,000 b/d of oil.

Habshan-Fujairah pipeline start-up delayed 1 year
Abu Dhabi’s International Petroleum Investment Co. said its
planned 1.5 million b/d Habshan-Fujairah oil pipeline will begin operating in March 2010, about a year later than originally
planned.
No explanation was cited for the new start-up date for the
320-km, 48-in. pipeline, which will join state-owned Abu Dhabi
National Oil Co’s Habshan fields with the Port of Fujairah. The
project also includes oil storage and terminal facilities for crude
exports at Fujairah.
According to analysts, the pipeline will greatly enhance Abu
Dhabi’s supply security, bypassing the busy Strait of Hormuz,
which generally is recognized as a strategic oil transport choke
point. ✦

Heat Can’t Hide
See tonight –
and every night –
with FLIR
Large petrochemical plants

SR-100

are in more danger of
security breaches tonight
than ever before. With
miles of perimeter fence to
secure, petrochemical plants
use FLIR’s thermal security
cameras to see at night. FLIR
cameras let operators see
clearly in total darkness, so
plants with large perimeters
can stay secure 24/7.
FLIR helps you stay secure at
night – because no one can
hide their heat.

Small steps
Warren R.True
Chief Technology
Editor-LNG/
Gas Processing
Oil and gas companies often hear
that consumers want them to be “energy” companies. This seems to mean
generating electricity, heating homes
and businesses, and moving cars and
trucks with something other than fossil
fuels.
Some companies have certainly
heard that message and have decided—
if you believe their advertisements—to
go beyond petroleum. Their planned
expenditures, however, often reveal
other priorities.
Turns out, most oil and gas companies prefer to remain just that: hydrocarbon finders, producers, processors,
transporters, and marketers and those
that serve and supply this process. They
know too well that, for the immediate
future, burning hydrocarbons is how
the world must meet its energy demand, however unpopular among some
that approach might be.
Nonetheless, trickling out with
greater frequency in the last several
months have come stories about industry companies—service companies,
in two cases cited below—that illustrate some of the “greener” projects in
which parts of the industry are getting
involved.

Nature’s other gases
In late April came news that New
Jersey-based Linde North America and
Houston-based Waste Management
would join forces to convert landfill gas
into clean vehicle fuel.

The venture plans to build an LNG
production plant at the Altamont Landfill near Livermore, Calif., to convert
landfill gas into a clean vehicle fuel. The
announcement touted the project for
offering a “unique opportunity to ‘close
the loop’ by fueling hundreds of collection trucks with clean fuel produced
from garbage.”
The companies will install systems to
purify and liquefy landfill gas that Waste
Management collects from the natural
decomposition of organic waste in
landfill. When it begins operating next
year, said the announcement, it will
produce up to 13,000 gpd of LNG.

‘One small step for a man…’
The US Department of Energy website states that 1.5 gal of LNG is about
1 gal equivalent of gasoline. Not much
conservation there. But, the attraction
of natural gas as a vehicle fuel in any
form has always been its clean-burning
nature: less CO2 going into the atmosphere. But what about the energy
needed to keep it refrigerated to –260°
F.? Details; details.
Linde North America Pres. Pat
Murphy said the companies’ efforts are
“capturing and reusing landfill gas for
vehicle fueling, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions” by more than
30,000 tons/year. The announcement
doesn’t reveal how reaching that level is
calculated.
In Europe, gas from another biological source appears to hold some
promise.
GE Energy’s Jenbacher gas engine is
powering an Italian farm’s first biogas
plant, the Baita del Latte farm’s plant
in Limena, in the north of Italy near
Venice. According to the GE energy
announcement earlier this month, the
power plant uses biogas created by the
digestion of a wet mixture of animal

waste and “agricultural biomass” materials, such as corn and rye.
The Jenbacher type J320 GS cogeneration has an installed electricgeneration capacity of 1.06 Mw, with
an efficiency of 40.8%, according to
GE Energy. The power plant is equipped
with a heat-recovery system that uses
waste heat from the jacket water.
The electricity produced is supplied
to the Italian power distribution network, while thermal energy is recovered and used to power the biomass
digestion process, the farm’s housing
facilities, and cattle sheds. The Jenbacher
engine is fueled by biogas created from
20 cu m of cattle effluent and about 50
tons of biomass each day.
By using biogas instead of fossil fuels
to generate power, said the company,
the project will reduce the equivalent
of about 5,000 tons/year of CO2. That’s
what 257 US residents emit in a year,
according to latest figures from the
Netherlands Environmental Assessment
Agency (www.mnp.nl).
Another small step.

Giant leap?
It remains to be seen if such projects
can form sufficient critical mass with
other small steps to generate a “giant
leap for mankind” (Sorry, Neil). “We
can put a man on the moon, but we
can’t ….” Some leaps are easier than
others.
Whether these isolated and often
curious projects really hold the promise
for efficient use of waste and significant
reduction of greenhouse gases, their
proliferation is encouraging. Human
ingenuity never ceases to amaze.
One larger fact seems abundantly
clear, however: We need all sources and
forms of fuel to meet global energy
demand, no matter how esoteric the
technology or smelly the source. ✦

McCain on energy
Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who will be the
Republican Party’s nominee in this year’s presidential election, traveled to Houston last week to
address energy policy. His performance was not
encouraging.
The senator offered one constructive proposal:
allowing exploration of areas of the Outer Continental Shelf now closed to oil and gas leasing. But
he couched the proposal in a self-contradictory
tirade that exhibited scant understanding of his
subject.
The speech was a huge opportunity. McCain is
running against liberal Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.),
whose platform contains nearly every government-centered mistake the US ever has made on
energy: special taxation of producers, massive
public expenditure on noncommercial energy
forms, consumption mandates, and other horrors.
To distinguish himself, McCain needed only to display economic judgment. He blew it.

What about ANWR?
While reversing an earlier stance to champion
OCS leasing, the Arizona senator couldn’t bring
himself also to support limited leasing on Alaska’s
northern coast. “When America set aside the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge,” he explained,
“we called it a ‘refuge’ for a reason.” Greenpeace
couldn’t have said it better.
Incongruity didn’t end there. Apparently seduced by Washington’s compulsion to find villainy
in fuel prices, the politician who calls himself a
maverick took his turn lambasting energy speculators. “We all know that some people on Wall Street
are not above gaming the system,” he said. But
his suspicion of “reckless wagering” didn’t make
him back away from support of the cap-and-trade
scheme he proposes for emissions of greenhouse
gases. Maybe he thinks righteously green emissions allowances will be less likely than dirty
energy derivatives to tempt unscrupulous traders
into misbehavior.
As a matter of fact, the speculators so popularly
disparaged these days in Washington, DC, are essential to a market that dilutes an antique worry
that McCain put at the core of his energy message.
Conflating formation of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries with the oil embargo of
the early 1970s, he regretted that oil had become

“a strategic weapon.”
Yes, Arab exporters—not OPEC, as McCain
said—imposed a targeted embargo in 1973-74.
But the move didn’t achieve its strategic purpose—ending US and Dutch support of Israel
during and after the Yom Kippur War. The inconvenience it caused US oil consumers resulted more
from market controls in place at the time than
from disrupted supply. The changes the embargo
uncorked in the oil market would have occurred
one way or another.
The biggest change was that oil, previously
sold under long-term, bilateral contracts, became
an internationally traded commodity. Inevitably,
a paper market developed alongside its physical
counterpart. Oil prices, once nearly invisible and
mostly static, came into clear view, subject to every
change—or rumor about change—in relationships between supply and demand. A once-brittle
market thus became fluid and much more adaptable to upset than it had been before. The adaptability makes it much less susceptible to politically
motivated manipulation of supply.
McCain told his Houston audience that oil
had been a commodity before the embargo but
became a strategic weapon. That’s backwards. If oil
is still a strategic weapon, it’s not a very powerful
one, and the US deploys it more readily as a buyer
than exporters do as sellers.

Military response
McCain described oil exporters as “often hostile
and undemocratic regimes in the Middle East and
elsewhere” and declared, “Oil revenues are enriching the enemies of the United States.” He made
energy policy sound like a military response and
came off sounding truculent, even dangerous. Not
all Middle Eastern exporters are Iran, but McCain
seemed little inclined to acknowledge distinctions.
McCain was right to emphasize, however selectively, the importance of long-neglected domestic
energy supply. But he was wrong to advance as
the central reason to do so a view of energy trade
that can be described only as xenophobic. Treating energy as a military threat rather than an
economic problem is a prescription for waste—or
worse. McCain has time to demonstrate on energy
sophistication wholly absent in his opponent. But
he has a long way to go. ✦

Residents of Iran’s north must surely
have experienced chagrin at a visceral
level in December 2007 when they
froze after Turkmenistan halted natural
gas exports to the country. Surely the
irony was not lost that, even though
Iran sits atop the world’s second largest
gas reserves after Russia’s, it is beholden
to Turkmenistan for imports supplying
as much as 5% of its gas needs.
Turkmenistan cited pipeline
issues as the cause of the gas
curtailment, but most insiders
believed that Turkmen authorities, who wanted price increases,
were upset at payment delays
and at Iran’s refusal to submit to
the dynamics of the new pricing
realities. Iran had paid Turkmenistan
$75-140/1,000 cu m for its gas; however, the Turkmen leadership wanted

Under the new agreement, Turkmen gas

imports. How is it that a country with
the world’s second largest gas reserves
found itself in this perverse situation?

Import jolt highlights
ironies of Iranian gas

Huge gas reserves
Iran’s dilemma actually is common
to many resource-rich countries. Iran’s
gas reserves are intimidating—28 trillion cu m (995 tcf). However, 62% of
the reserves are in nonassociated fields
that have not yet been fully prepared
22

for investment. Given the growth of
gas in the world energy market and the
concordant development of the global
LNG market, Iran’s oil and gas development should be at its peak like that of
Qatar, its erstwhile rival and North field
neighbor adjoining Iran’s South Pars
field.
However this is not the case. Iran’s
clerical leadership had set its sights on
rapidly developing the country’s gas
reserves even in the face of stringent
opposition from the US and the United
Nations. The deficiency of Iran’s gas
development lies more with its internal
economic policies than with external,
international economic pressure. As
the price of gas rises, Iran’s inability to
secure investment and provide domestic
energy for its citizens will be thrown
into sharper relief. The conundrum
revolves around the economic term of
“perverse incentives” active in the gas
sector, and to a certain extent played out
in the gasoline arena.
To soothe domestic discontent over
its stagnant economy, Iran subsidizes
domestic gas consumption at a rate of
$0.35/MMbtu, which places its cost to
domestic consumers at one of the lowest rates in the Middle East (see table).
This low price is a reason for the extreme difficulty the National Iranian Gas
Co. (NIGC) has in seeking to monetize
its large gas resources, especially those
in offshore South Pars (see map).
The gas crunch is not unique to
Iran; it occurs across the Persian Gulf
as governments struggle to maintain
their domestic pricing schemes and
the stark gap between domestic and
international prices. For example, the
UAE is experiencing an electric power
generation crisis because gas prices
have increased more than tenfold in
less than a decade, and further strain
is expected as production costs are
projected to soar by more than 100%
in the next 2 years.
Last summer the UAE experienced
such an acute gas shortage—about 1
bcf—that it was compelled to switch
to crude oil and coal for power generation. Gulf governments are caught in

When the EGL deal was announced,
the US vigorously protested it, vowing to review it for possible violations
of the Iran Sanctions Act. However,
Joachim Conrad, who heads EGL,
brushed aside concerns on the grounds
that Europe’s long-term energy security is more important than short-term
political disagreements. Swiss Foreign
Minister Micheline Calmy-Rey also
argued that the deal did not violate the
Iran Sanctions Act.
Placed in the broader context, Iran
is merely one prong in the EU’s multipronged strategy to achieve gas diversification. The “Iran card” allows the
EU to exercise leverage with Gazprom
ahead of 2010, when many major gas
supply contracts are slated to be renegotiated. The EGL deal dramatizes the
attractiveness of Iranian gas, assessed
at €90-200/1,000 cu m, compared
with Gazprom gas at €240/1,000 cu
m—which may increase to €260 at
yearend.
Iran doubtlessly provides a useful
counterweight to Gazprom’s singular
influence over the EU’s gas supply. On
the most practical basis, there is no
other viable supplier for the EU from
the fourth corridor. Potential gas volumes from Azerbaijan cannot support
the deliveries needed. And developing gas fields from Iraqi Kurdistan
or obtaining associated gas from the
northern Iraqi oil fields are illusory
stratagems until the security situation
improves and the political dispute between the central and regional authorities finds a solution, which may not be
any time soon.

T E R E S T

cu m from 20 million cu m.
The Turkmenistan cutoff to Iran had
a ripple effect, causing Ankara to dip
into its stored supply by a third and Turkey to further cut off Azeri shipments
transiting to Greece. This halt came at an
unfortunate moment for Turkey, which
experienced a stellar jump in consumption due to the unusually cold weather.
Granted, the issue behind Iran’s stoppage did not seem political in nature as
did the Russia-Ukraine gas crisis. However, there is a very real possibility that
if Iran and Turkmenistan bicker, Turkey
and the EU will suffer the consequences. And judging from the past, it appears
that in order to encourage agreement,
Turkmenistan will resort to gas reductions at the peak of winter to encourage
compliance.
Turkmenistan’s current strategy is to
modify the 2006 price schedule with
Iran that stipulates an increase in gas
exports of up to 14 billion cu m/year
from the base volume of 8 billion cu
m/year. With tremendous momentum
from its successful price renegotiations
with Gazprom and PetroChina, and
enjoying the rising price from the Asian
market, Turkmenistan was emboldened
to press Iran for the price increases.
The latest Iran-Turkmenistan price
dispute raises questions about the proposed $7.5 billion, 3,000 km Nabucco
pipeline, construction of which is
expected to begin in 2010. Nabucco,
if constructed, will allow Iranian gas
to flow through pipelines from eastern
Turkey to Austria’s Baumgarten gas hub,
via Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary,

for the South Stream pipeline, show the
potential for Iranian gas to disrupt the
energy balance of power in the region.

Price liberalization
For Iran to truly reach its potential
and become a stable supplier for the
EU, price liberalization must bring sufficient investment into the gas industry.
Leaving aside for a moment the political
pressures from the US and UN Security Council, gas and oil power are too
cheap in Iran.
Its clerical leadership is politically
divided as to how best to exploit its
gas resources. Part of the leadership
contends that the gas should be used
primarily for oil field reinjection to take
advantage of high oil prices; another
group believes that gas should fuel the
domestic market at prices below market
to encourage industrial development
and provide low domestic energy prices
to the populace; while a third group
says Iran should emulate Qatar and
develop its gas and LNG more actively
for export.
As this article goes to press there is
no clear winner in this dispute, and it
appears that in making concessions to
each viewpoint, Iran is incorporating all
of them. However, if another gas shortage occurs, populist calls will be strong
to halt any gas export or LNG programs.
Herein lies the danger of relying on
Iranian gas.
The Iranian domestic gas market will
probably experience some minor price
liberalization in the near-to-midterm.
The nation’s budgetary strains from
supporting domestic consumption are
beginning to unravel the economy. The
June 2007 riots, which started from
the government’s decision to ration
gasoline while increasing the price,
proved that the leadership must tread
carefully. In the past, the commercial
and political costs of producing gas for
domestic power generation were slight,
and it could be contended that the best
possible use of domestic energy was to
encourage industrialization and provide
cheap energy.
But current conditions are quite

different; there is a very real opportunity cost for providing extra gas for
domestic power generation at below
market rates as opposed to supplying
the international market. Additional
gas production requires major investment in an industry that faces great cost
increases and that demands increased
technical skill.
Additional gas sold to international
buyers in the EU rather than to domestic consumers will yield a much
higher return under the current pricing
scheme. Iran’s uranium enrichment
activities likely will chill some foreign
investment, as shown by the fact that
OMV, Shell, and Repsol moved away
from the Iranian blocks. But the EGL

that rate hikes will be passed down
the line. The Iran-Turkmenistan pricing dispute shows the growing clout
and confidence of the Central Asian gas
producers. Burdened with its subsidized
internal market, Iran has no real choice
but to recognize these artificially low
domestic gas prices as perverse incentives that create chaos in the domestic
economy and feed an unrealistic thirst
for cheap energy in the citizenry.
Of course, raising gas prices in the
face of rapid inflation and record unemployment will be a difficult maneuver,
but history has shown that if proactive
stratagems are taken, worse case scenarios, which might include dominolike chains of events, can sometimes be
avoided. ✦

McCain promises ‘bold’ energy program, NAFTA support
Speaking June 17 in Houston—“the
oil capital of America”—US Sen. John
McCain, the apparent Republican nominee for president, endorsed ending
federal embargoes of offshore drilling,
temporarily removing federal taxes on
gasoline, and the increased construction
of nuclear plants to help reduce high
energy costs.
McCain said, “We must be bold in
our plans to break our strategic dependence on oil, and over the next 2
weeks, I’ll be offering a vision that will
be bold. But we must also address the
concerns of Americans, who are struggling right now to pay for gasoline,
groceries, and other necessities of life.”
He said, “These citizens believe their
government has a duty to finally assure
the energy security of this country, and
they are right.”
McCain supports the pragmatism of
bringing more fossil fuels to market
until other alternative forms of energy
26

are developed. “We have proven oil
reserves of at least 21 billion bbl in the
US. But a broad federal moratorium
stands in the way of energy exploration
and production. And I believe it is time
for the federal government to lift these
restrictions and to put our own reserves
to use,” he said.
Those states that permit offshore
exploration should get a bigger share
of the royalties from those leases. “As
a matter of fairness to the American
people, and a matter of duty for our
government, we must deal with the
here and now, and assure affordable
fuel for America by increasing domestic
production.”
While he supports drilling off all US
coasts, McCain reiterated his opposition
to opening the Artic National Wildlife
Refuge to exploration. “Quite rightly,
I believe, we confer a special status on
some areas of our country that are best
left undisturbed,” he said.

McCain noted, “There’s so much
regulation of the industry that the last
American refinery was built when
Jerry Ford was president.” He said, “We
haven’t built a new reactor in 31 years.
In Europe and elsewhere, they have
been expanding their use of nuclear
energy. But we’ve waited so long that
we’ve lost our domestic capability to
even build these power plants.”
High oil prices “may come as good
news in Moscow, Riyadh, or Caracas,
where economic growth and rising oil
prices are more or less the same thing,”
he said, adding, “But their oil prosperity is our energy vulnerability. And the
jobs, family budgets, and futures of the
American people should not depend on
the whims of foreign powers.”

NAFTA support
McCain used the occasion to reiterate his support of the North American
Free Trade Agreement with Canada and

Mexico—two of the largest suppliers
of oil and gas to the US. “There is a
world of difference between relying on
two democratic neighbors and partners
in NAFTA, and relying on often hostile and undemocratic regimes in the
Middle East and elsewhere. When critics
of trade talk about unilaterally renegotiating NAFTA, as my opponent has done,
that’s one more concern they might
want to keep in mind,” he said.
McCain said, “Whoever controls oil
controls much more than oil. And in
our time, much of the world’s oil supply is controlled by states, regimes, and
a cartel for which America’s well being
is not exactly a priority. Many occupy a
violent part of the world—a region all
the more violent for the influence of oil
wealth. Their opinion of America runs
the full spectrum from indifference to
hatred. And yet these regimes are today
the masters of the oil market.”
He decried “the vast wealth we shift
to the Middle East, Venezuela, Angola,”
and other producing countries “to
enrich undemocratic, unjust, and often
corrupt regimes.” He said, “Some of the
most oil-rich nations are also the most
stagnant societies on earth. ...In effect,
our petrodollars are underwriting tyranny, anti-Semitism, the brutal repression of women in the Middle East, and
dictators and criminal syndicates in our
own hemisphere.”
He charged, “Somehow the US—
in so many ways the most self-reliant
of nations—has allowed and at times
even encouraged this state of affairs.”
However, he said, “Starting in the term
of the next president, we must take
control over our own energy future,
and become once again the master of
our fate.”

Blaming speculation
McCain acknowledged the growing demand for oil outside the US.
“When demand exceeds supply, prices
always rise, and this has happened very
dramatically in the demand for oil,”
he said. “Two powerful forces in the
oil market today are China and India,
nations in which a third of humanity is suddenly entering the industrial

Real work begins
behind the scenes

US

Senate rejection of punitive
oil taxes and a global climate
change bill within days of each other
doesn’t mean the ideas are dead; they
simply have moved behind the scenes
where oil and gas industry lobbyists
expect intense negotiations.
“Our real work has begun. We are
busier 2 days after the Senate votes
than we were for a month before,”
said William F. Whitsitt, president of
the American Exploration & Production Council, when I met him at a
Canadian oil sands conference on
June 11. “There are still some very
pernicious ideas out there. “
Two days earlier Lee O. Fuller,
vice-president, government relations,
Independent Petroleum Association
of America, told me: “I tend to think
there’s a good chance that Congress
will be up to some sort of mischief.
With oil prices at $135[/bbl] and the
prospect of their reaching $150[/bbl],
that’s what they’re hearing about from
their constituents.”
Fuller said he expected the global
climate-change focus to shift to the
US House Energy and Commerce
Committee. “It seems to be looking
more at the big issues that need to be
addressed rather than simply trying
to write a bill,” he said.
Fuller suggested that the committee’s chairman, Rep. John Dingell
(D-Mich.), may feel less pressure
to quickly produce global climatechange legislation after the Senate’s
experience debating the measure,
which Joseph I. Lieberman (I-Conn.)
and John W. Warner (R-Va.) introduced in October 2007.

Likely in 2009
Fuller added that a bill seems
likely in 2009 because the two major

parties’ apparent presidential nominees, Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.)
and Barack Obama (D-Ill.), support a
cap-and-trade program.
Days later, the committee made its
first move when Rep. Rick Boucher
(D-Va.), the chairman of its Energy
and Air Quality Subcommittee, introduced a bill aimed at accelerating
the availability of carbon capture and
storage technology—a key climatechange program component.
Boucher’s bill, which has nine
Democrats and five Republicans as
cosponsors, would establish a $1 billion annual CCS technology fund. It
would be financed from taxes on the
generation of electricity from coal,
oil, and gas. Residential costs would
be an additional $10-12/year.

Punitive proposals
Meanwhile, many congressional Democrats continue to demand
punitive measures for the oil and
gas industry. Proposals range from
repeals of tax incentives to giving
federal regulators more authority to
investigate and prosecute oil market
manipulation allegations.
Some federal lawmakers also want
to reimpose the windfall profits tax.
Fuller and Whitsitt separately said the
idea may be growing harder to sell.
“Some blogs suggest that not
everyone accepts the idea that a
windfall profits tax will reduce
energy prices. Whether they make
a difference will depend on the
congressional office’s sophistication,”
Fuller said.
Whitsitt added, “We’re starting to
hear that more of the public recognizes that major oil companies aren’t
responsible for these higher prices.
They’re beginning to get it.” ✦

US CFTC unveils new foreign market data pact
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The US Commodity Futures Trade
Commission improved its access to data
on US commodities traded on overseas
exchanges as it amended terms under
which ICE Futures Europe is permitted direct access to US customers, the
CFTC’s top official told a joint hearing
of two US Senate committees.
The amended “no-action relief letter” will require ICE Futures Europe to
adopt equivalent US position limits and
accountability levels on its West Texas
Intermediate crude oil contract, which
is linked to the New York Mercantile
Exchange crude oil contract, said CFTC
Acting Chairman Walter L. Lukken.
It also will require ICE Futures
Europe to follow similar US hedge
exemption requirements and report any
violations to the CFTC, he told a joint
28

hearing of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee and the
Appropriations Committee’s Financial
Services and General Services Subcommittee. “The CFTC will also require
other foreign exchanges that seek such
direct access to provide the CFTC with
comparable large trader reports and
to impose comparable position and
accountability limits for any products
linked with US regulated futures contracts,” Lukken said.
“This combination of enhanced
information data and additional market controls will help the CFTC in its
surveillance of its regulated domestic
exchanges while preserving the benefits
of its mutual recognition that has enabled proper global oversight over the
last decade,” he maintained.

‘No one knows’
The announcement was applauded

by several House and Senate members,
but critics on both sides of the Capitol
said CFTC still needs to do more. Sen.
Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), the Appropriations subcommittee chairman who ran
the hearing, said, “With the economy
in a tailspin and with the average price
for a gallon of [gasoline] topping $4
across the country, people are asking
why this is happening. Is excessive
speculation taking place or is it simply
supply and demand? The answer is that
no one knows, and the CFTC lacks the
information, resources, and in some
cases, legal authority to tell us.”
He said the joint hearing by these
two committees was unprecedented
but reflected intense interest in CFTC’s
regulatory role and resources. Fifteen
senators made opening statements or
asked Lukken questions, Durbin noted,
before introducing a second group of
witnesses. “Those who wanted to get

government off our backs ended up
taking cops off the beat,” he said.
In the House, Energy and Commerce
Committee Chairman John D. Dingell
(D-Mich.) and Bart Stupak (D-Mich.),
who chairs its Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, released a letter to
Lukken commending CFTC for issuing a
special call to obtain more information
about passive investments in commodity indexes and single commodities
and for efforts to get more information
from ICE Futures Europe and its British
regulator, the Financial Services Administration.
“Despite these initiatives, the futures
markets remain far from transparent
to regulators or the public,” the two
House members continued. Congress
particularly needs to understand the
role and activities of sovereign wealth
funds in commodity markets to better
determine if oil-producing countries
may be contributing to upward pressure on commodity prices through
undisclosed oil and other investments,
they said. Dingell and Stupak asked
Lukken 11 questions in their letter and
requested answers by June 20.

Four Senate bills
Four separate Senate bills were filed
on June 12-13 to address possible speculation and increase CFTC’s authority
and resources. S. 3130, which Durbin
introduced, would give the agency
money to hire another 100 employees,
make its inspector general independent, order the US comptroller general
to study the international regime for
trading energy futures and derivatives
and submit a report to Congress within
120 days of the bill’s enactment, and
require a non-US board of trade selling

an energy commodity for US delivery
to operate under US regulations.
Several senators at the hearing asked
Lukken about specific energy commodity market issues. Ken Salazar (D-Colo.)
said an independent oil and gas producer in Colorado wondered why Congress
had not increased margin requirements
from 5 to 40%. “Margins are a very
blunt instrument when used in that
fashion and could send many businesses
overseas,” Lukken replied.
Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) asked
him if CFTC would support repealing
the provision in the 2000 Commodity
Futures Modernization Act that created
exempt commercial markets—the socalled Enron loophole—and moved the
burden of regulatory proof from traders
to the commission. When Lukken said
he did not believe this had prevented
CFTC from investigating market manipulation allegations since the CFMA
became law and the agency had won all
of its cases, Klobuchar said, “I understand that you have taken measures. I
don’t understand why you apparently
don’t want a stronger law.”
One difference that emerged was the
difference between CFTC’s definition of
market manipulation and that of federal
lawmakers, which Lukken said might
more accurately describe a speculative
bubble. “Manipulation in the CFTC’s
eyes is an illegal act where someone
tries to push prices higher without taking any risk. We’ve seen cases in the past
where someone has tried to manipulate
a market by holding one leg of their
position in clear view while doing
something more on the outside,” he
explained.

Republicans’ assessments
Republicans said CFTC should be
given a chance to implement its new
responsibilities. “Mr. Lukken, your
challenge is: before you can put all
the changes in your authority into
operation, some people in Congress
are trying to push it further,” said Sam
Brownback (Kan.).
“Simply blaming foreign boards
of trade and the CFTC will not lower
energy prices,” said Saxby Chambliss
(Ga.), the Agriculture Committee’s
ranking minority member. Several bills
have been introduced and hearings held
about commodity markets and higher
energy prices, he pointed out. “We
should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution, particularly when we
might create more problems by driving
speculators into markets from which
the CFTC receives no trading data and
has no ability to monitor,” he said.
Lukken said the commission already
is extending its inquiries into major
new areas. When Agriculture Committee Chairman Tom Harkin (D-Iowa)
asked about “netting out” by index
traders to possibly camouflage their true
positions, the CFTC official said: “We
typically have not looked at markets
to get information on traders. Swap
dealers take different positions for their
clients so this will be unprecedented.
We will be going through large investment bank clients’ portfolios and trying
to determine what they are doing.”
The agency is doing this because it is
concerned that some investors may be
using swaps to evade commodity position
limits, he added. “It’s imperative that we
get this data. That’s why we announced
2 weeks ago that we were putting out
special calls for it,” Lukken said. ✦

its production,” said Gary Mar, the
province’s minister-counselor at the
Canadian Embassy in Washington.
It also has become the target of
groups intent on restricting development as a way to stop the growth of
fossil fuels, he told participants at a
conference on Canada’s potential for
reducing US reliance on imports from
Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries members.
Alberta and Canada’s democratic
governments stand in contrast to those
of most other oil-producing nations,
Mar said. Canada and the US developed
a close and beneficial trading relationship long before Canada became the
largest foreign oil supplier to the US, he
noted.
“We also have strict environmental
standards. Strict limits are placed on
water use, and water quality is continuously monitored. Fort McMurray’s air
quality is better than many major Canadian cities,” Mar said. Technology has
reduced the amount of water needed to
produce a barrel of oil from oil sands
to 2-3 bbl from 5 bbl, compared with
more than 100 bbl of water to produce
a barrel of ethanol, he noted.

‘Tremendous’ CCS potential
The province also is moving ahead
on developing carbon capture and
storage (CCS) capabilities because its
geology and that of Saskatchewan are
ideal, he said. “CCS has tremendous
potential for Alberta as a technology
we can market throughout the world.
We think it should be impressed on
US policymakers that this technology
is not new, and that it works,” Mar
said.
His statements prompted a response from an audience member at
the conference, which was sponsored
by the Canadian American Business
Council during its annual meeting. “In
addition to global warming, there are
other environmental concerns. Mining
will be the primary source of oil sands
for some years to come,” said Susan
Casey-Lefkowitz, a senior attorney at
the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“In situ processes have impacts from
sedimentary fragmentation and pipeline
construction. Water impacts also are
substantial. More action is needed,” she
said.
“As we’ve met with oil companies,
we see that many have made commitments to fight global warming but are
also investing in higher-carbon fuels.
We believe that more investments need
to be made in new and developing
alternatives,” she continued.
Matt Fox, senior vice-president for
oil sands at ConocoPhillips Co., said
that the company believes its Alberta
oil sands holdings could produce 1
billion bbl of bitumen, 90% of which
would come from an in situ process,
steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD),
instead of mining. SAGD uses the same
amount of land and much less water
than conventional oil field development.
The water comes from underground,
it is generally saline, and 90% of it is
recycled, he said.
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
during production are 3-4 times the
amount produced in a conventional oil
field, Fox conceded. “That’s an issue we
have to look at,” he said, adding that
Alberta’s forthcoming CCS standard
should bring the overall GHG footprint
closer to conventional oil field levels.
ConocoPhillips is developing its own
CCS and alternative fuels capabilities in
the meantime, he said. “This is not a
bridge where we’ll sit back and wait,”
Fox said.

to the same environmental and permit
requirements on the state level, she continued. “The politics around some of
these projects has been unbelievable,”
Neff said. Trans-border pipelines also
must get a border crossing permit from
the US Department of State, which used
to be a fairly straightforward process
but has recently become more difficult,
she said.
Neff noted that the US Environmental Protection Agency is about to issue a
notice associated with GHG emissions
in various transportation modes. While
pipelines’ emissions are lower than
highway or rail transportation, their
pump stations could be monitored.
Biofuels pose yet another set of questions, she said.
“The most important issue for
liquids pipelines is a stable regulatory
environment. Once you’ve put pipe in
the ground, you can’t redeploy the asset. The problem is that nothing is ever
as straightforward as it seems,” Neff observed. Since Canada is the only source
for many inland refineries’ feedstock
except for US Rocky Mountains production, pipelines will be under political
pressure to respond, she said. “We’re
increasingly being asked to address
reliability and security issues. All of this
will require getting the necessary permits promptly and in a straightforward
manner,” she said.

Do McCain and
the Saudis agree?

US

Sen. John McCain will probably smile with satisfaction
after learning of remarks by members
of Saudi Arabia’s legislative body, the
Majlis Shura, who feel that the US
should begin producing more oil at
home.
“There are a great deal of restrictions in many areas of the world—
not the least of which is the United
States—that could be producing oil,”
said Bandar bin Mohammed Al Eiban,
part of a 5-man Shura delegation to
the US.
The delegation’s visit came ahead
of a special producer-consumer
meeting hosted by Saudi Arabia
aimed at reducing crude prices. In
particular, Saudi Arabia wants the US
to reduce market speculation, focus

and build new refineries to process

oil, the federal government discourages offshore production.”
Of no less interest to the Saudis, perhaps, were McCain’s words
about the effect of speculation on oil
prices.

Focus on speculators

“There is the further problem of
speculation on the oil futures market,
which in many cases has nothing to
do with the actual sale, purchase, or
delivery of oil,” McCain said. “When
you have enough speculators betting
on the rising price of oil, that itself
can cause oil prices to keep on rising.
And while a few reckless speculators
are counting their paper profits, most
Americans are coming up on the
short end—using more and more of
their hard-earned paychecks to buy

the government share of revenue from
the oil and gas sector. In 2005, it said,
the government received $19.9 billion
net take from the oil and gas sector after
paying out $7.68 billion in refunds.
While the compensation for questionable items was small compared to
the profit, the BPK stressed the impact
of “regulation loopholes and reckless
supervision by the oil and gas regulator
BPMigas” (OGJ, Mar. 24, 2008, Newsletter).

Bureaucracy cut
In April, the newly appointed head
of BPMigas, R. Priyono, vowed to cut
the bureaucratic processes that oil and
gas companies currently must undergo
in order to obtain their exploration licenses. “If they (oil and gas companies)
have to go through three or four tables,
let’s make it just one,” Priyono said,
adding, “Such a bureaucratic system is
simply out of date.”
The new system would help BPMigas
implement its main task of increasing
the country’s oil production, which has
declined over the past 5 years due to
depletion at aging fields and reduced
exploration for new ones.
Priyono said some positions in the
agency will be restructured to improve
efficiency, adding that the plan was
being negotiated with the energy and
mineral resources ministry.
At the time, Purnomo said Priyono
also must improve the monitoring of
cost recovery, which has come under
public criticism for its alleged lack of
transparency.
Priyono promised he would ensure
that each department had a standardized financial surveillance system to
guarantee that cost-recovery funds
were well-spent. He also said a new
system would be introduced to tighten
the cost recovery mechanism, by
refunding exploration costs only in
producing fields.
According to BPMigas’ latest report,
the government paid some $8.33 billion to oil and gas producers in 2007
for recovery costs, up 6.4% over the
$7.8 billion paid in 2006. ✦

This article outlines a volumetric visual method (voxel volumetric method)
to visualize and model underground
geological structures for optimizing
in situ steam assisted gravity drainage
(SAGD) well placement.
This voxel volumetric method uses
logged well data from 257 shallow
wells drilled in a 10 sq km area of a
multibillion dollar tar sands project.
Well log data are input into a voxel
imagery method that creates an accurate
visualization of complex underground
structures relevant to optimizing bitumen sands production.
The difficulty is the complex geology of the tar sands deposits. Lack of
understanding of the stratigraphy and
sedimentology of the reservoir sands
can hinder exploitation from regional
exploration aspects as well as site-specific production and development.1

permeabilities commonly ranging from
3 to 10 darcies.2
The facies of particular concern with
respect to excellent bitumen extraction potential consists of medium to
large-scale trough crossbedded, fine to
medium-grained sand with rare mud
drapes and laminae. The voxel visualization in this article is based on this particular formation of concern, as logged
by client company geologists.

Voxel is short for voxel volume pixel,
the smallest distinguishable box-shaped
part of a three-dimensional image.
Voxelization is the process of adding
depth to an image using a set of crosssectional images known as a volumetric
dataset. These cross-sectional images or
slices are made up of pixels. The space
between any two pixels in one slice is
referred to as interpixel distance, which
represents a real-world distance. And,
the distance between any two slices is
referred to as interslice distance, which
represents a real-world depth.
The dataset is processed when slices
are stacked in computer memory based
on interpixel and interslice distances
to accurately reflect the real-world
sampled volume. Next, additional slices
are created and inserted between the
dataset’s actual slices so that the entire
volume is represented as one solid
block of data.
Now that the dataset exists as a solid
block of data, the pixels in each slice
have taken on volume and are now
voxels. For a true 3D image, voxels must
undergo opacity transformation along
with tricubic interpolation. The tricubic
interpolation ties structural elements
tagged between wells together to form
a picture of an underground structure.
Opacity transformation gives voxels
different opacity values. This is important: It is crucial to expose interior
details of an image that would otherwise be hidden by darker, more opaque
outside-layer voxels.

Voxel images are primarily used in
the field of medicine and are applied
to X-rays, computed axial tomography
(CAT) Scans, and magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) so surgeon professionals
can obtain accurate 3D models of the
human body.
We developed voxel imagery software and techniques that took core
descriptions tagged by geologists as
“excellent bitumen intervals.” Excellent
bitumen intervals were considered by
geologists as any bitumen core that had
greater than or equal to 13% weight to
weight bitumen content.
These excellent bitumen intervals
were converted into three dimensional
spatial references that served as useful
input in the voxel volumetric method
developed by our firm.
Company project geologists had
logged several thousand meters of core
data. Using a cutoff criterion of 13% bitumen content weight to weight, company
geologists had tagged the well latitude,
longitude, and depth of each of these
high-percentage bitumen content cores.
Longitude, latitude, and depth is
equivalent to the X, Y, and Z axis on
our figures. The Z axis, or the dimension that represents depth underground,
has been exaggerated nine times in our
voxel figures in order to better show
geological structures.
Bitumen content greater than or
equal to 13% weight to weight bitumen
content, considered at the time of the
project 4 years ago as an economically
significant cutoff value, was logged
visually by project geologists, followed
by a laboratory program that provided
quantitative numerical weight to weight
figures that had excellent correlation
with geological observations.
Our technique only used as input
logged core data meeting the 13% economic cutoff criterion or above this criterion. In other words, only structures of
economic resource interest are mapped
by this 3D method in three dimensions,
and only data logged from project geologists were used, filtered by a greater than
or equal to company-specific 13% bitumen weight to weight content.

Note subtle changes in layering. This technology was developed in response to the inadequacy of seismic-based techniques
to clearly deﬁne point bar structures in underground estuarine environments. Accurate visualizations of underground structure

This resulted in the following comprehensive visualization of 10 sq km of
tar sands north of Fort McMurray (Figs.
2 and 3). These figures show a complex
estuarine environment composed of
interfingered channel deposits.
Fig. 4 represents a blowup of Fig.
3. One can observe the confluence
of several point bar structures in the
blowup figure which represents a future
potential mine. Estuarine channels,
which represent low bitumen potential
and bounding structures for point bars,
can be readily observed in the figure as
sinuous structures.
It is easy to observe sediment
mounding and one incised valley in
profile along the upper edge of the
voxel image. In the horizontal X and Y
plane of the figure, subtle textural and
color changes represent inner to outer
point bar structural detail. Cross-cutting
relationships between meandering
channels illustrate for geologists the
time sequence of channel development
in this estuarine underground environment. These cross-cutting relationships
can be readily observed in Figs. 3 and 4.
This voxel visualization technology was developed in response to the
inadequacy of seismic-based techniques
to clearly define point bar structures in
underground estuarine environments.
Accurate visualizations of underground
structure can provide production and
geological planning teams with the
necessary means to develop an optimal
production plan for SAGD technology/
surface mine developments.
The same technology is also applicable to visualization of underground
structures in traditional oil and gas plays
as demonstrated by an image of an anticline trap based on well data (Fig. 5).

Various telemetry systems have been
and are under investigation: wired
pipe,1 mud pulse,2 3 electromagnetic,4
and acoustic.5 Mud-pulse telemetry has
proven to be reliable and cost-effective
and is the most common MWD telemetry system.
The earliest telemetry patent was
issued in 1929, but current mud-pulse
telemetry systems date from work by J.J.
Arps published in 1964.6
Teleco introduced the first commercial MWD mud-pulse tool in 1978. This
tool transmitted directional information
to surface at about 0.4 bps.
Data rates stabilized in the 1980s
and 1990s at 0.4 to 3 bps. This rate was
sufficient to transmit reliably MWD and
LWD data at that time. In the 1990s,
development of new LWD tools and
introduction of rotary steerable drilling
systems and real-time drilling dynamics tools placed considerable pressure
on the ability of this transmission link
to maintain data density. In response,
engineers developed a reliable MWD
telemetry system that was delivering
unprecedented raw data rates by the
close of 2007 (Fig. 1).

System design
As with any digital communication
system, a mud-pulse telemetry system
has distinct components (Fig. 2). The

receiver side of the system mirrors
the transmission side. An information
source—the downhole sensor—provides the data for transmission to the
surface information sink—personnel
controlling the drilling operation.
To reduce the amount of transmitted data and to cope with limited
bandwidth, an optional source encoder
performs source compression. A corresponding source decoder decompresses
at the receiver. Source compression
algorithms either discard information
(“lossy” compression) or retain all the
information (“lossless” compression).
To protect the bit stream from errors
introduced by the transmission channel (flowing mud-filled pipe bore), an
optional channel encoder adds error
protection. The channel decoder in the
receiver uses this information for error
detection and correction. Since the additional information reduces the available net bandwidth, there is a trade-off
between telemetry reliability and net
data-rate reduction for each measurement.
After channel encoding, a digital
modulator transforms the data bits into
analog waveforms that propagate readily in the mud column (modulation).
The typical waveform is a pulse and the
process is known as pulse modulation.
On the receiver side, the pulse detector interprets pulses and transfers data

Optional components

back to the bit.
The pulse waveform can either be
directly emitted
by the pulser
(positive and
negative pulsers
used by several
MWD companies) or it can be
shifted towards a
higher frequency
before transmission (“passband
modulation”). The
mud siren style of
an MWD pulser
uses the latter type
of shifting, for

example.
On surface, pressure sensors measure
the transmitted waveforms. In the case
of passband-modulated data, the receiver signal is demodulated before passing
it to the pulse detector to reconstruct
the binary data.
To increase the pulse detection quality and thus the reliability of the telemetry link signal, the signal needs to be
reconstructed before demodulation and
pulse detection to remedy the destructive effects of the analog mud channel
on the signal shape. Signal reconstruction is one of the most critical steps in
reliably boosting the transmission data
rate and was rigorously investigated
during the development of this MWD
telemetry system.

Attenuation, reﬂection
In mud-pulse telemetry, the transmission channel is the mud-filled bore
of the drill string. Pressure waves travel
up the mud column, are attenuated, and
partially reflected. The energy of the
pressure wave received on surface is just
a fraction of the energy emitted by the
mud pulser downhole. The attenuation
increases with depth, frequency of the
signal and compressibility of the mud.
For example, oil-based mud is highly
compressible relative to water-based
mud and higher transmission frequencies are, therefore, more attenuated.

pends on depth and mud type, it is
advantageous for optimum MWD signal
transmission to have a pulser capable of
transmitting data in different frequency
bands. For shallow water-based mud
systems, passband modulation provides
a bandwidth unmatched by pulse-based
systems. For deeper wells or oil-based
muds, it is necessary to be able to
switch to discrete pulsing for reliable
transmission, since these lower frequency waveforms suffer less attenuation.
Various types of valves generate pulse
pressure in the flowing mud (Fig. 6).
These valves either bypass flow to the
annulus (negative pressure pulsers) or
restrict flow (positive pressure pulsers).
Most mud pulsers used in the oil industry are positive pulsing valves. Various
valve options include cone valves (act in
or against flow direction), rotary valves
(open and close perpendicular to the
fluid flow), or fluidic valves (change
the flow pattern).

sufficient telemetry data rate to
deliver the required data density to surface when there was relatively low availability of real-time formation evaluation
services and relatively low ROP.
With the introduction of rotary
closed coop drilling systems, penetration rates increased dramatically. The
available telemetry data rates led to ROP
restrictions or low data density. In addition, an expansion of LWD and MWD
services put severe demands on the
available MWD transmission data rate.
In 1977, the US Energy and Development Administration published a report
giving a broad overview of the available
MWD and telemetry systems.13 By the
early 2000s, not much had changed
in terms of data rate or mud-pulse
systems, although the systems had been
optimized for reliability.

Oscillating pulser
The existing systems delivered either
strong, discrete pulses or low- amplitude continuous waves. Engineers
needed a new pulser combining both
options to ensure independence from

telemetry bandwidth of 40 hz or more
with low power consumption.
Norsk Hydro ASA used shear valve
pulser technology in deep water off
Norway in 2006, at depths to 22,000 ft.
Petrobras also used shear valver pulser
systems off Brazil in 2007.
The oscillating movement has various advantages over the legacy rotary
valves. The system can self-oscillate
with low power consumption at high
speeds. During each oscillation cycle,
the valve runs through a zero speed
state, in which phase or frequency can
be changed instantaneously for efficient
telemetry modulation, providing high
telemetry data rates.
In contrast to rotary valves, oscillating valves can be adapted to flow rate
and mud weight changes even when
the tool is downhole. Only the oscillation amplitude must change to keep
the pulse pressure constant, and the
oscillation angle can be easily adjusted
by a downlink when flow rate or mud
weight changes are required.
Another advantage of an oscillating valve is that it can transmit discrete
pulses to surface, in addition to the
passband-modulated signal. In cases
where high frequencies are attenuated, the oscillating valve can be set to
discrete pulsing. With high-end motor
controllers, even the pulse pattern can
be changed at each oscillation cycle.

c) Pilot-operated valve

Either higher harmonics of the pressure signal can be reduced by shaping
the motor speed profile, or the shape of
the pressure pulse can be fully controlled to create sinusoidal, trapezoidal,
rectangular, or any other shaped signals
to enable maximum signal pressure at
the source and optimum downhole signal quality for high decoding quality at
surface. These features are not possible
with legacy rotary valves.
Oscillating systems are also less
prone to jamming from foreign bodies
within their moving components. These
pulsers open and close in opposite directions. A jammed foreign body is released as soon as the valve opens again.
Only the signal amplitude decreases
while the foreign body passes through
the valve. In a rotational valve, the
foreign body gets stuck, and backward
rotation is required to free the body.
The basic idea behind this adaptable mud pulser is that each drilling
application is different. Because the rig
environment cannot be easily changed,
the pulser must be adapted to the application, even when already run downhole. The adaptability of the pulser to its
environment ensures optimum signal
quality.

Mud-pulse receiver
The receiving antennas in a mudpulse telemetry system are one or

more pressure sensors mounted in the
standpipe. For good decoding of the
received signals, the telemetry signal
energy has to be significantly above the
noise energy.
To boost mud-pulse data rates, there
are generally two options; either (a)
increase the telemetry signal energy
so that the received energy on surface
is sufficiently higher than the energy
of interfering noise, or (b) cancel out
noise by signal reconstruction algorithms before handing the signal over
to the demodulator and pulse detector.
Since the mud pumps are a major
source of noise and are located on
surface, pump noise cannot be attenuated. The energy of the telemetry signal
would have to be increased by several
orders of magnitude, which renders approach (a) difficult. Signal reconstruction by surface-processing algorithms,
Option (b), is more viable.
Surface signal reconstruction is the
key to reliable high data rate mud-pulse
telemetry. It has to remedy two types of
distortion: noise and frequency selectivity. Noise usually is assumed to be additive and can be subtracted as soon as we
have an idea what it looks like, which is
the difficult part.
We can either model noise or
estimate it from measurements. A
measurement-based approach is much
more robust since it inherently includes

10 bps on a 30-hz
carrier frequency. The middle drawing
depicts the signal, after canceling out
the effects of the transmission channel
(distortion and interfering noise). It
clearly shows the recovered, sinusoidal,
30-hz carrier signal. The bottom drawing depicts the corresponding demodulated signal. The vertical red lines mark
the beginning of a bit and the black
cross on top of the signal in the middle
of a bit indicates the logical decision of
the pulse detection logic. If the cross is
above the zero line, a ‘1’ was transmitted and ‘0’ otherwise.
After noise cancellation, we can
estimate the frequency-selective attenuation and equalize it based on transmitted reference signals (i.e., known
signals). The optimum parameter set
for signal transmission (discrete pulsing or passband modulation, data rate,
and if applicable, signal frequency) is
determined by the resulting signal after
noise cancellation and equalization.
Only this signal shows the final ratio
of signal energy to noise energy, which
needs to be maximized for optimum
telemetry data rate. Therefore, it is inevitable to have a downhole transmitter
capable of full parameter adjustment via
downlink. This closed-loop approach
to MWD telemetry systems has enabled
the high data rates demonstrated by the
new system.

development off Nigeria.
Deepwater exploration, drilling,
and construction projects place large
demands on people and machines. For
this work, project managers need to
orchestrate smoothly a complicated array of schedules, deadlines, deliverables,
people, and equipment.
Project managers face many random
events, such as changes in the weather
and mechanical failures. With thousands
of people working in concert, even
minor delays can result in millions of
dollars of lost revenue.

Where the spreadsheet and printed
schedules once tracked progress, project
management software now enables
project managers to work together
seamlessly with a single version of the
truth to plan for and create what-if
scenarios for addressing the innumerable contingencies that arise and to
ensure that all resources are managed
for utmost efficiency.

Off Nigeria
The Bonga Southwest-Aparo project
provides an example of the use of this
software. The SNEPCo managed project is about 10 km from its first major
deepwater project
Bonga, which is
120-km off Nigeria and went on

tioning the project was to determine
its commercial viability. To asses this,
SNEPCO had to develop an estimate of
the schedule, cost, and risks associated
with the venture.
The design, procurement, and
construction of wells, subsea facilities, pipelines, and the FPSO, involve
hundreds of thousands of activities and

Europe, OGJ numbers show. The US led
the growth by producing 2.2% more
gas in 2007 than in 2006. But in aggregate, increases among the rest of the
world’s regions were smaller than seen
between 2004 and 2006 (OGJ, June 18,
2007, p. 50). The marginal advantage
in gas processing capacity for regions
outside the US and Canada continued in
2007, the third year in a row to show
this imbalance.
Canadian NGL production advanced
marginally last year, by less than 1%.
Combined with production in the US,
NGL output from the two countries’ gas
plants staged a recovery from a declining trend by reaching 130.4 million
gpd, comprising more than 44% of
global NGL production last year. For
2006, the figure was 38.7% of world
totals; for 2005, slightly more than

by more than 255 bcf over its 2006
output.
On Jan. 1, 2007, OGJ data show
that US gas processing capacity stood
at 71 bcfd, up from 70 bcfd for 2006;
throughput in 2007 was essentially flat
with that for 2006 and 2005, averaging a bit more than 45.5 MMcfd (about
64% utilization); and NGL production,
nearly 76,230 gpd, compared with
nearly 75,500 gpd for 2006 (Fig. 1).
Fig. 2 shows pricing differentials in
the US between LPG—the most widely
traded NGL on the world market—
and crude oil for the first trading day
of each month in 2007. With crude
oil prices escalating sharply during
the year, the chart nonetheless shows
the historically normal relationship
between LPG and crude oil continued
throughout 2007. (An accompanying
article, beginning on p. 58, discusses
international trade in LPG.)

Sources
Oil & Gas Journal’s exclusive, plantby-plant, worldwide gas processing
survey and its international survey of

petroleum-derived sulfur recovery provide industry activity figures.
Canadian data are based on information from Alberta’s Energy and Utilities Board that reflect actual figures for
gas that moved through the province’s
plants and are reported monthly to the
EUB. For 2000 for the first time, OGJ
took these data for all of Alberta and
compiled annual figures and thereby
created a new baseline for data comparisons thenceforth.
(Effective Jan. 1, 2008, the province
realigned the EUB into two separate
regulatory bodies: the Energy Resources
Conservation Board (ERCB) to regulate

the oil and gas industry and the Alberta
Utilities Commission (AUC) to regulate
the utilities industry.)
In addition to EUB figures for Alberta
and to operator responses to its annual
survey, OGJ has supplemented its Canadian data with information from the
British Columbia Ministry of Employment & Investment’s Engineering and
Operations Branch and the Saskatchewan Ministry of Energy & Mines.
As 2008 began, gas processing
capacity outside Canada and the US
stood at 112 bcfd, off from 126 bcfd
for 2007; throughput outside Canada

categories, with a preponderance in the
downstream group.
The upstream index has been tracking costs since 2000; its index of 210
points for early 2008 reflects an overall
growth of 210%. That set a record for
the years of coverage. The downstream
index has been tracking since 2003;
its index of 176 points for early 2008
reflects an overall growth of 176% in
inception.

concrete what all have been seeing in
their daily businesses: It’s costing more
and more to build anything.
Rising costs for raw materials, especially iron ore needed to produce steel,
and transportation, mainly in rising fuel
prices, are driving the increases.
“Specialized deepwater equipment
that is required for the subsea, particularly umbilicals and control systems,
shows the largest increase of any area
on the index,” said the announcement.
“Continued manufacturing constraints
coupled with higher materials and labor
costs” led to increases in upstream costs
of 12% in the 6 months leading up to
May 2008.

tive projects” has driven the latest cost
increases, according to CERA’s Jackie
Forrest. CERA expects energy projects
to “continue to move forward. Despite
project delays owing to capital costs
and record activity levels,” she said. The
inventory of refining projects remains
20-30% higher than recorded in recent
years.
Raw materials for steel, such as iron
ore, she said have increased 65% just in
2008.

Activity
The relatively flat growth evident in
global gas processing over recent years
is coming to an end. The following
reviews plans for projects announced in
the last 15 months or so and reflects a
surge of expansion and new buildings
not seen in midstream for many years.

North America
In the Peace River Arch area of
northeastern British Columbia, Spectra Energy Income Fund will add 30
MMcfd of sour-gas processing capacity to the West Doe plant, bringing
the plant’s full processing capability to
53.5 MMcfd. The $41-million project
includes 50% ownership in a 58-km, 8
and 10-in. gathering pipeline from the
Sundown area in British Columbia. The
increased capacity is due on stream in

first-quarter 2009. The Sundown gathering pipeline began delivering to the
existing West Doe plant this quarter.
In the US Gulf of Mexico in August
2007, Williams was expanding its
deepwater gathering and processing
infrastructure for production dedicated
by units of Shell, Chevron, and BP in
the Perdido foldbelt.
Williams has invested about $480
million in its Perdido Norte project,
which the company will own and
operate. Infrastructure investment, said
the company, includes 184 miles of
pipeline and expanded gas processing
capacity.
The company began pipeline construction in early 2008 with pipelines
and additional processing capacity to be
ready to receive production by 2010.
Williams’s new infrastructure will
originate at floating production the
producers will construct in about 8,000
ft of water about 220 miles south of
Galveston, Tex.
Great White, Silvertip, and Tobago
fields are the sources of initial production. By design, said Williams, its facilities will be able to accommodate future
production from other Perdido foldbelt
prospects and from potential tie-ins
along the new pipeline route.
Design includes 107 miles of natural
gas gathering pipeline able to transport
about 265 MMcfd of production. The

Sulfur production
A seemingly inexorable slide in
worldwide refining and natural gas processing’s production of petroleum-derived sulfur continued in 2007, to 82.7
million tonnes/day from 84.2 million
tpd in 2006, and from slightly less
than 85 million tpd in 2005. Capacity
increased slightly to 178.8 million tpd,
from 178.5 million tpd in 2006, and
from slightly more than 178 million
tpd in 2005.
Canada and the US continued to
dominate last year with 46.9% of
processing capacity, exactly even with
its share for 2006, a slip from 47% in
2005. The two countries’ share of actual
production rose in 2007, to 49.7%
from 48.6% in 2006 and 49% for
2005.
In 2007, Canada produced barely
more than 23.2 million tpd, down from
23.3 million tpd in 2006 and 23.4
million tpd in 2005. US production
in 2007 advanced, to 17.8 million tpd
from more than 17.6 million tpd in
2006 but down from more than 18.5
tpd in 2005.
Canada continued to account for less
than 24% of the overall total capacity,
level with 2006, and more than 28% of
production last year, ahead of 27.6% for
2006 and 27.5% in 2005. ✦

Changes in sources
Natural gas processing continues
to be the largest supply source of LPG
supply, accounting for nearly 60% of
total worldwide production during the
last 10 years. Refineries accounted for
nearly all of the remaining production.
Other sources account for less than
0.5% of worldwide LPG production.
A fundamental change in the market
will occur during the next few years
as LPG is recovered from LNG. Most
propane and butane available in the
raw gas streams for LNG production
will be separated from the LNG upon
liquefaction. The growth in LNG facilities around the world will increase LPG
production accordingly.
Smaller amounts of LPG and significant amounts of ethane, however, will
be left in the LNG stream when there
is no local demand. Some markets can
utilize sources of LNG that contain
higher levels of ethane and LPG. With
many projects, extraction of the LPG
components will be necessary before
liquefaction of the gas stream.
On the regasification end, the ethane
present in some LNG will prevent the
gas from meeting natural gas pipelines’
specifications. In these cases, the LNG
will need to be diluted or have the ethOil & Gas Journal / June 23, 2008

that more than 40% of the world’s LPG
supplies will come from East of Suez by
2010.
On a percentage basis, production
increases have been particularly high
in the CIS region, where supply nearly
doubled to about 13.4 million tonnes
in 2007 from 6.8 million tonnes in
2000. Other regions that grew quickly
in the same period include the Indian
subcontinent, the Far East, and Oceania,
each of which saw growth greater than
4%/year so far this decade.
Since 2000, total global LPG production has increased by nearly 30 million
tonnes. On an absolute production
basis, the largest supply increase came
from the Middle East, which increased
by 8.8 million tonnes to about 43.3
million tonnes in 2007 from a relatively
large base of 34.5 million tonnes in
2000. Thus, the Middle East accounted
for about 30% of the world increase in
LPG production so far in this decade.
Other regions with large absolute
increases included the CIS region, with
an increase of about 6.6 million tonnes,
and the Far East at 6.3 million tonnes.

High energy prices: good or bad for NGLs?
Monthly average prices for crude
oil have increased by a factor of ﬁve in
less than 5 years since the end of 2003
and have nearly tripled in only the last
18 months. Global prices for propane
and butane have also increased during
this period, but at a noticeably slower
pace. Thus, LPG has become relatively
cheap during this rapid run-up in energy prices.
In the US, prices for propane and
normal butane have risen by a factor
of “only” 3.5 since late 2003. Likewise,
spot prices for propane and butane in
Northwest Europe have increased by a
factor of roughly 3.6 and 3.9 in 5 years.
In Japan, the relative increase in LPG
spot prices has been somewhat more
modest at about 3.3 and 3.5 times during the same period.
This relatively slow increase has
shifted demand for LPG throughout
the world as both a fuel and as an
ethylene plant feedstock. For example,
until 2005 LPG in Japan was a more
expensive industrial fuel than kerosene
throughout the year. From 2005 to
2007, LPG became a cheaper fuel than
kerosene during many months each
year. Starting in 2008, LPG has been a
much cheaper fuel than kerosene during every month. Thus, demand for LPG
has likely risen.

Purvin & Gertz expects that LPG
production in North America will grow
to about 56 million tonnes by the end
of the decade. Gas processing provides
slightly more than 60% of the LPG production in the region.

Similarly, LPG was never a competitively priced ethylene plant feedstock
in Asia before the beginning of 2007.
During the last 18 months, however,
costs of producing ethylene from both
propane and butane have been lower
than for naphtha except during the
peak winter heating season. Ethylene
producers throughout Asia have been
adding or restarting facilities that allow
them to crack more LPG.
In Northwest Europe before 2006,
propane was virtually never a competitively priced cracker feedstock, and
butane was only attractive compared
with naphtha during 4 or 5 months in
the summer.
In 2008, Purvin & Gertz estimates
that both propane and butane will be
cheaper feedstocks than naphtha for 9
or 10 months out of the year.

in the US, cash production costs for all
feedstocks have historically been fairly
close to one another. In 2008 ethane,
propane, and normal butane should
all be much cheaper feedstocks than
naphtha throughout the year.
Thus, LPG has become an attractive
ethylene plant feedstock in all regions
of the world. Demand for LPG as a
cracker feedstock has increased accordingly.
The good news for LPG demand
is that relatively weaker prices have
resulted in stronger demand as both a
fuel and as a cracker feedstock. The bad
news is that absolute prices for LPG
have soared to record highs. Demand
by residential consumers, the world’s
largest end-use sector, is stagnating or
falling in essentially all regions.
Many consumers have resorted to
conservation measures such as turning
down thermostats in their homes or
cooking food that requires less LPG
(pasta rather than beans). Other consumers have reverted to other forms of
cooking fuel such as coal, wood, and
even dung.
So, are high prices good or bad for
LPG demand? The answer is a likely a
resounding…“both.” We expect that

tonnes/year.
Purvin & Gertz expects that LPG production will continue to expand in Africa. We expect particularly large absolute
production increases from Nigeria and
Algeria by the end of the decade, with
significant contributions from Egypt,
Libya, and Equatorial Guinea as well.

million tonnes since 2000 due to an
increase in crude oil production and a
large increase in gas processing capacity.
In the past, Nigeria flared a large portion of its natural gas production, along
with the entrained LPG. This practice
has been decreasing, and the gas is now
being processed to recover the LPG.
Additions to natural gas liquefaction
capacity have also increased the overall
recovery of LPG from the produced gas
in Nigeria. We expect that LPG production in Nigeria to increase to about 3.8
million tonnes by 2010. Civil unrest
in the country continues to impede
increased production. Other countries
in West Africa that produce and export
LPG include Angola, the Congo, and
Equatorial Guinea.
On the north coast of Africa, Algeria,
Egypt, and Libya are significant LPG
producers. Algeria is still the world’s
second largest LPG exporter after Saudi
Arabia. Algeria produced more than half
of the total for Africa in 2007. Egypt
produced 11% of African supply in
2007 but remains a net importer of LPG
due to high domestic demand. Libya is
also a large producer of LPG; its production should reach about 1.4 million
tonnes by 2010.

Latin America
LPG production in the Caribbean
and Latin America was about 25 million
tonnes in 2007. This production was far
less than in the Middle East and North
America but comparable to production
in the Far East and in Western Europe.
Within the region, Mexico is the
largest producer of LPG, followed by
Brazil, Venezuela, and Argentina. Together, these four countries accounted for
more than 80% of the 2007 LPG production in the region. Gas processing in
the region accounts for more than 60%
of LPG production; this percentage will
grow in the future.
Several countries in Latin America
have plans for new and expanded
gas liquefaction that will add to the
regional LPG supply. Purvin & Gertz
expects total LPG production in the
region will rise to about 28 million

tonnes by 2010. Brazil had the largest supply growth since 2000, at about

Almost all demand growth for LPG
in Asia is in the residential-commercial

Within Northern Europe, auto-fuel
use in Poland has exhibited extremely
strong growth during the past 10 years
and accounted for the bulk of the
growth in the country’s LPG market. As
in many other countries where autogas
represents a significant component of
LPG demand, Poland’s 2007 autogas
consumption of about 1.9 million
tonnes/year is driven by the fuel tax
structure. In the absence of increased
incentives, autogas growth in Poland
will slow.
In southern or Mediterranean
Europe, growth patterns for LPG have
been quite different than in the north.
The countries that make up this region
include Spain, Italy, France, Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, and the Balkan states.
Most of these markets are very mature,
and the petrochemical sector does not
make up a large component of demand.
Consequently, the region is not likely to
show strong growth.
Demand in Southern Europe peaked
at 17.2 million tonnes in 2000 and
declined to 15.3 million tonnes in
2003. Demand rebounded to about
16.2 million tonnes in 2007 but will
not surpass the 2000 levels by the end
of the decade.
The CIS region (Commonwealth of
Independent States) includes Russia and
all the republics of the former Soviet
Union, except the Baltic States. Between
1990 and 1998, demand in the region
steadily declined due to weak economic
conditions. In recent years, however,
growth has returned to these markets.
LPG demand in the CIS has grown at
average rates exceeding 7%/year since
2000.
In 2007, demand in the CIS totaled
about 9.9 million tonnes. Russia accounts for the largest portion of the
regional demand, consuming more
than 80% of the LPG. Within Russia,
the residential-commercial sector uses
slightly less than one-half of the total,
and petrochemical consumption of LPG
accounts for almost 40%. We expect
LPG demand in the CIS to rise to about
10.6 million tonnes in 2010.

Latin America is a large market for
LPG. Within the region, about 80%
of LPG feeds residential-commercial
demand. Mexico and Brazil account
for almost 60% of LPG consumption.
LPG demand in Latin America declined
starting in 2000 to a low of about 25.7
million tonnes in 2003.
Much of the contraction in demand
occurred in Brazil and Mexico due to a
combination of economic factors and
penetration into the market by natural gas. Latin American demand has
since rebounded to about 28.3 million
tonnes in 2007. Purvin & Gertz expects
that demand will grow to nearly 30
million tonnes by 2010.

year. This small
growth rate,
however, masks
the absolute demand increase due to the
large size of the market.
Total LPG consumption in the North
American market increased by 2.0 million tonnes 2000-07. For comparison,
this increase by itself is nearly the same
size as the total LPG consumption in
Oceania in 2007.
Because North America is a mature
market, Purvin & Gertz does not expect
base demand to grow appreciably in
the region. Base demand growth should
average only about 1.1%/year through
2010. Demand by the price-sensitive
market, however, should expand rapidly
2008-09. After the peak of the surplus,
price-sensitive demand will decline, but
should remain relatively high for several
years as the petrochemical industry
takes advantage of low-cost global supplies.
We look for total LPG demand in
North America, including price-sensitive demand, to reach nearly 65 million
tonnes by 2010.

Mexico continues to have the highest per-capita use of LPG in the residential market of any country in the
world. Four out of five households in
the country use LPG as cooking fuel.
Mexico consumed about 9.7 million
tonnes of LPG in 2007—almost 45%
more than in Brazil.

North America
The North American market (excluding Mexico, counted with Latin
America) is one of the largest in the
world and is mature. North American
base demand for LPG grew at less than
the world average in 2007. The US
petrochemical industry, however, relies
heavily on LPG as a primary feedstock,
and petrochemicals’ LPG demand was
robust in 2007. Total North America
LPG demand—including price-sensitive
demand—grew at about 1.6%.
One unique aspect of the North
American market is its ability to accommodate a large amount of pricesensitive demand. The US Gulf Coast has
a large amount of underground storage,
ample marine terminal facilities, and a
large petrochemical industry that has
unparalleled feedstock flexibility.
These attributes allow the US Gulf
Coast to consume large amounts of LPG
when the price is right. Consequently,
when global supply of LPG exceeds base
demand, the US Gulf Coast is often the

Global LPG trade
With increased global LPG production and demand, one might have
expected increased waterborne trade
in 2007. Large-cargo waterborne trade
volume actually dropped, however,
to about 51.5 million tonnes in 2007
from 53.0 million tonnes in 2006.

decline, many are likely to be temporary.
On the source side, South American
exports dropped by nearly 1 million
tonnes. This drop was due mostly to an
abnormally harsh winter that caused
Argentina and others to retain their LPG
rather than sell it on the global market.
The Middle East, Australia, and the
North Sea each dropped LPG exports
by more than 0.4 million tonnes. OPEC
cuts, delayed projects, and increased
domestic demand contributed to the
Middle East’s drop. North Sea exports
were hampered by declining production and significant maintenance work
on terminals.
The largest increase in exports was
about 0.6 million tonnes from Africa,
particularly from Algeria and Nigeria.
On the destination side, import
demand for propane continued to be
soft in China as consumers balked at the
high international prices and domestic
refineries were able to meet internal demand. Waterborne imports into China
dropped by 0.8 million tonnes in 2007.
Premium demand increased in South
America to cope with the cold winter.
The drop in exports coupled with the
South American winter took a cut out
of price-sensitive demand. Because LPG
was frequently favored over naphtha,
LPG still flowed to crackers in Asia
and the Mediterranean. The traditional
“market of last resort,” however, the
US Gulf Coast, found itself without
significant incoming supplies of offseason LPG. Imports to the US Gulf
Coast dropped by 1.9 million tonnes in
2007. ✦

Volatile VLCC rates
lead tanker rebound
Christopher E. Smith
Pipeline Editor

Tanker market earnings for the half-year
ended March 2008
firmed by 14.1%, from
the previous 6 months.
Temporary increases in
Tankers
demand (driven by market trading) and decreases in supply (conversions) drove the
increase in earnings. Clarkson Research
Services Ltd. detailed the reasons
behind these market movements and
forecast future market directions in
its Spring 2008 “Shipping Review
and Outlook: A Half-Yearly Review
of the Shipping Market.”
According to Clarkson data, the
tanker market, consisting of both
modern and early-1990s very large
crude carriers (VLCCs), modern Suezmax, modern Aframax, and both dirty
and clean products carriers, averaged
$34,771/day in earnings from September 2007 to March 2008, a 14.1%
increase from the $30,477/day seen
March-September 2007.
A 93.3% increase in VLCC earnings, to $86,009/day, led the upward

momentum, with clean-product tankers
being the only segment experiencing
more than a marginal drop in earnings
from the previous 6 months, falling
16.1% to $22,529/day (Table 1).
Perhaps the most striking feature, according to Clarkson, was the speed with
which VLCC rates increased in OctoberDecember 2007, peaking at more than
$230,000/day for modern vessels, as
compared to $25,000/day for spot
VLCCs in October 2007 (OGJ, Feb. 4,
2008, p. 64).
Even with the easing in rates off
66

those highs, Clarkson said, high scrap
prices and phaseout requirements,
combined with continued trade growth,
offer the possibility of earning strength
continuing, at least in the short term.
The oil tanker fleet grew to reach
385.9 million dwt by yearend 2007,
an increase of 6.2%, with another 4.4%
increase forecast for 2008. The active
tanker fleet for vessels of more than
10,000 dwt increased by 147 ships
over the 6 months ending Mar. 1, 2008;
187 vessels delivered against 21 vessels
scrapped. With the current order book
standing at 41% of the fleet (in deadweight), Clarkson sees a possibility that
the fleet could become oversupplied.
This article details some of the other
findings in a few of the numerous
vessel categories covered twice each
year by Clarkson in its Shipping Market
Outlooks.

clean product tankers also increased to
$22,520/day from $17,765/day in the
preceding 6 months. Rates for a 1-year
time-charter of the same vessel type,
however, slipped 4%, to $22,000/day,
according to Clarkson.
Ship values continued to increase,
with the value of 5-year old VLCCs
reaching $140 million from $130 million in September 2007.
Clarkson notes that conversions of
single-hull tankers have helped offset
deliveries of new vessels, at least in the
larger sizes, but that underlying demand

By Mar. 1, 2008, the VLCC
fleet totaled 146.8 million
dwt, down from 148.4 million dwt 6 months earlier
due to conversion of singlehulled tankers to floating,
production, storage, and offloading vessels and very large ore carriers. The fleet
will total 147.1 million dwt by yearend
2008, as conversions continue to keep
pace with deliveries, even as scrapping
remains low (Fig. 1). Increased deliveries in 2009 will expand it to 158.7
million dwt.
Clarkson described the VLCC sector as volatile for the 6 months ending
Mar. 1, 2008, with spot earnings for a
1990s-build vessel starting at a 4-year
low before reaching record highs in
December. For the entire 6 months,
spot earnings averaged $77,713/day,

same period 1 year earlier. This coincided with relatively flat fleet growth
and a continued increase in asset values
(Table 2).
By contrast, weakness continued in
the time charter market, with 1-year
rates for modern tonnage dropping
to $43,317/day between September
2007 and March 2008 compared with
$49,563/day for the same period a
year earlier. Clarkson notes, however,
that rates picked up as the spot market
improved, ascribing the fall instead to
the strength of 2006-07 market.
Clarkson sees upwards support for
spot prices remaining in place for the

balance of 2008, as the lack
of fleet growth faces continued demand.

Suezmax
On Mar. 1, 2008, the Suezmax fleet totaled 54.8 million
dwt, flat for the 6 months
as conversions matched 1.3
million dwt of deliveries.
A heavy delivery schedule,
particularly in 2009, will see
the fleet reach 62.4 million
dwt by yearend, according to

Clarkson.
Spot earnings for the 6 months ending Mar. 1, 2007, averaged $46,322/
day, down only slightly from a year
before despite reaching highs of more
than $112,000 day at year-end 2007.
Time-charter rates for 1 year on a modern vessel dropped 9.7% from the end
of 2007, while 3-year rates fell 4.3% to
$22,000/day.
Clarkson expects spot rates in the
Suezmax sector to remain steady in
the short term, bolstered by robust
demand. In the medium term, however, rates may come under pressure as
potential vessel oversupply emerges. The

2010 single-hull phase-out, however,
could reduce the risk of oversupply, according to Clarkson.

Aframax
On Mar. 1, 2008, the Aframax fleet
had increased to 76.9 million dwt. A
heavy delivery schedule, only partially
offset by demolitions and conversions,
will grow the fleet to 83.1 million dwt
by the end of 2008, according to Clarkson (Fig. 2).
Aframax earnings rose to $35,420/
day during the 6 months ending Mar.
1, 2008, but were still down 17% from
the year-earlier period. Time charter
rates also slipped 12% from a year earlier, reaching $21,833/day for a 1-year
term.
Clarkson sees the 40%-of-fleet order
book in the Aframax sector as leading
to the same potential medium-term
oversupply of vessels expected in VLCC
and Suezmax vessels, but notes that the
2010 phaseout of single-hulled vessels could provide some counteracting
upward pressure in the future.

Chemical

rate movement from end-2007, according to Clarkson. Rates for 5,000 tonnes
Rotterdam-Houston fell 7.3%, with
Houston to Rotterdam for 5,000 tonnes
rising 7.8%.
Persian Gulf-Mediterranean rates
showed the sharpest increase, rising
25% (15,000 tonnes). Despite strength
along some routes, however, Clarkson
saw the entire segment as weakened
by a softer dollar and elevated operating costs, particularly for crewing and
bunkers.
As with the other tanker segments,
Clarkson sees future fleet development
in chemicals as hinging on the market’s ability to absorb a large orderbook
(15.6 million dwt as of Mar. 2008),
tempering this somewhat with expectation of a buoyant biofuels markets and
expanded Middle East production.

IT’S REALLY

What You Know
Corporate risk identiﬁcation and assessment are only as good as the
data in the system. This is what many companies ﬁnd as they try to
integrate their corporate risk strategy and ﬁnance decisions. However,
minimizing negative consequences and increasing competitive
advantage opportunities won’t happen without excellent market
intelligence.
Author Scott W. Randall shows executives and corporate risk
managers how techniques from industrial market researchers are
essential to gaining adequate assurance, better corporate governance,
and increased value for shareholders.

FEATURES AND BENEFITS
* A plan to limit the amount of garbage coming in to eliminate
garbage going out.
* Learn to implement safeguards over the external processes that
affect the accuracy of ﬁnancial projections.
* Know how to properly assess a public energy company’s ability to
survive and grow through the energy commodities price cycles.

Blame obsession
won’t change the
price of gasoline
The US Constitution gives Congress
plenty of work to perform. So why do lawmakers keep adding to their load?
In fact, the Constitution is notably
speciﬁc in its expectations. In Section 8, it
provides a long list of congressional powers and, by implication, responsibilities. The
chores range from punishing pirates and
maintaining a navy to passing laws.
The list’s top item seems to be the favor-

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

ite. It’s the one about imposing taxes.
Nowhere does the Constitution instruct
representatives and senators to afﬁx blame
for the sour turns of events that occasionally befall the nation.
Yet lawmakers spend a lot of time on
blame, especially when the sour turn of
events involves the price of gasoline.
Since the landmark Gulf of Mexico
hurricanes of 2005, lawmakers have been
blaming oil companies for the gasoline
price increases that so thoroughly anger so
many of their constituents.
More recently, they have made “speculators” targets of high-price blame, along
with regulators of commodities trading.
All this blame-ﬁxing creates the illusion
that Congress is doing something about
gasoline prices. In reality, of course, there’s
little it can do that wouldn’t make things
worse.
Oil companies don’t set the price of
gasoline. Neither do speculators or trading
regulators. Markets set oil prices. If blame
must be assigned, economic arithmetic
suggests it belongs to anyone who contributes extravagantly to demand or who in
some way limits supply.
In the former category belong motorists
who drive senselessly large vehicles, for
example. The latter characterization applies
chieﬂy to lawmakers who discourage oil
and gas exploration with bans on federal
leasing and other such folly.
But, of course, most people would
rather bathe in hot oil than admit they’re
wrong. And complicity in national malaise
represents no small offense.
So proﬂigate consumers will probably stay angry at everyone else while
their elected ofﬁcials hold hearings, make
pompous speeches, and point ﬁngers. It’s
a self-reinforcing cycle of constitutionally
protected delusion that excuses participants from the need to learn anything.
So they won’t learn, no matter how
deeply the policy mistakes they instigate
hurt national interests. Who, after all, can
blame them?

Angry ofﬁcials mull market controls
Diplomatic and government policy responses appear to be coming to a head in a
climate of accusations over high energy prices, said industry analysts.
“Some diplomatic, regulatory, or policy watershed is drawing near, or at least
some venting of pent-up pressures is likely to manifest itself,” said Paul Horsnell at
Barclays Capital Inc., London. “At this moment, what is happening in Washington
and elsewhere in terms of policy debates is as much a part of what [energy] traders
need to be aware of as is supply and demand.”
Horsnell noted “the provocative rhetoric” as UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown
recently described the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries as a “scandal,” while Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd spoke of applying “the blowtorch
to the OPEC organization.” Horsnell said, “It is fair to assume that so overt a stance
does not facilitate constructive dialogue.” Oil and gas producers have been “more
discrete” in their language, but “it seems clear that they are beginning to lose some
patience with the spread in the climate of rolling accusations,” he said.
Meanwhile, analysts at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co. Inc. (FBR), Arlington, Va.,
reported strong odds that the US Congress would pass a NOPEC bill (No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels) for antitrust prosecution of OPEC members.
Horsnell cited “the continuing head of steam in Washington behind various
potential market intervention measures. In particular, institutional investors seem
ever closer to being placed in the regulatory crosshairs.” However, he said, “We
see institutional investment as a stabilizing and improving factor for commodities
markets, and we believe that holding commodities has a valuable role to play within
a balanced asset portfolio.”
In addition, banning institutional holdings of commodities could lead to “some
serious market distortions and volatility.” Horsnell said, “A clumsy implementation
could potentially create forced trading and generate chaotic conditions and very
artiﬁcial prices in the short term. Such a development would in turn discourage what
is already far too slow a rate of investment and delay demand reactions. Indeed, it is
likely to lay the basis for another surge in prices once market conditions normalized,
while leaving long-term investment lower than it would have been.”
There is growing momentum in Congress to increase the authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to allow interagency coordination, including
working with the UK Financial Services Authority, said FBR analysts. There is growing support for requiring higher margins for crude oil trades and imposing position
limits on noncommercial trades through swaps dealers. Strict limits or prohibitions
on oil futures investment by sovereign wealth funds and their institutional investor
partners are unlikely, FBR analysts said, but an investigation of potential conﬂicts
of interest between research analysts who assess oil market conditions and institutional investors who buy oil futures is likely. There also is some support for barring
further investment in oil by institutional investors, said FBR analysts.
Corn factor
In mid-June, Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland, discerned a possible “corn theme” in crude markets. “The US Midwest is currently suffering from
historical ﬂooding, and the corn crops are under threat. The prospect of lower corn
supplies is pushing corn prices to record high levels, and expectations are growing for ethanol supplies to come under threat of falling margins (shares of ethanol
producers are coming off the cliff),” he reported June 13.
Even before the mid-summer ﬂoods and the resulting run-up in corn prices,
Jakob said, “Some states such as Texas were asking for a waiver on the ethanol mandate to alleviate the price pressure on corn. Following the ﬂoods, the pressure for
an ethanol waiver could accelerate, and this could then be supportive for petroleum
gasoline as the share of ethanol blending would be reduced.”
Furthermore, Jakob said, “Crop damage and delays could be negative for diesel
demand.” As a result, the gasoline crack “was not only gaining vs. crude oil but was
increasing while the heating oil crack was decreasing,” he said. “The risk [of] buying
gasoline on the ﬂood trade is that an ethanol waiver would not be the only solution
to attenuate any production shortage from the Midwest (94% of US ethanol production) as import of sugar-cane ethanol could also be substantially increased” via a
waiver of the US import tariff on ethanol supplies from Brazil.
“The ﬂoods are also creating a potential risk on the safe operation of petroleum
pipelines and reﬁneries in the region, while barge trafﬁc is being disrupted with portions of the Mississippi being closed,” Jakob said.

Deepwater Fracturing: It’s Make or Break Time

Internal breakers make a big difference
Net present value (NPV) of today’s assets can depend on the fracture proppant pack.
The more conductive the proppant pack, the more productive the well.
Diamond FRAQ™ HD Nonionic Viscoelastic Surfactant (VES) Fracturing Fluid is the only highdensity VES fracturing fluid with internal breakers. 100% regained proppant pack
conductivity is twice as much as other high-density frac fluids. That’s enough to double well NPV.
That’s not all. Diamond FRAQ also offers these value-added benefits.

WELCOME
Welcome to the inaugural China Power Oil & Gas Conference & Exhibition held in the city of
Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, at the economic centre of industrial south China.
This new and unique conference and accompanying trade show
recognize the nexus that has formed at which growing Chinese demand
for electric power meets its critical need to produce that power more
cleanly. It will bring together Chinese and international expertize
spanning the power, oil & gas and energy efﬁciency sectors through a
twin track conference, co-located with an exhibition, showcasing the
best in domestic and foreign technology and services.
China’s burst of economic prosperity has prompted increased need
for power generation. The result, in a land of massive coal reserves, has
unfortunately been severe and extensive air pollution choking every
large city. To clear its air, China must burn cleaner hydrocarbon fuels to
produce power and boost renewable energy production. Although
China’s own efforts to produce cleaner fuels, especially natural gas
for power generation, have increased rapidly, demand has outstripped
supply. This has prompted proposals to bring in natural gas via pipeline
from Central Asia and Siberia and via LNG.

In terms of technology there is much interest in various environmental
designs for LNG terminals to reduce their impact on air and water
quality as well as on pipe-laying techniques and tools to limit damage
to and enhance environmental recovery along a pipelines’ rights-of-way
(ROW). Leading industry experts will also present on the latest clean
coal, boiler, gas turbine and environmental protection technologies.
In this Pre-Show Guide you will ﬁnd all the information you need to
plan your visit to China Power Oil & Gas including the preliminary
conference programme, schedule of events, ﬂoor plan and exhibitor
listing and registration form. Please refer to the event website www.
___
chinapoweroilandgas.com for updates to the conference programme.
Speaking for the Advisory Board, we invite your participation in CPOG
2008 and hope you ﬁnd the varied, high-level programme stimulating
and practical.

The oil and gas elements of this conference focus on the general theme
of oil and natural gas production, supply, transportation, and processing
in the supply chain from supply source to power generation site. At the
heart of this theme will be natural gas supplied to the country’s power
generation industries, even as China competes with other Asia-Paciﬁc
countries for fuel to generate power.

Warren R. True, Ph.D.
Conference Director (Oil & Gas)
Chief Technology Editor- LNG/Gas Processing
Oil & Gas Journal

The conference will explore how China’s market conditions themselves
may evolve in ways that affect the supply of oil and natural gas for power
generation and the impact of legal and regulatory conditions and will
showcase particular Provinces’ speciﬁc laws and regulations and how
they encourage or discourage petroleum-based power development
or demand.

Nigel Blackaby
Conference Director (Power/ Energy Efﬁciency)
Associate Editor

We look forward to seeing you in Guangzhou.

Strategic sessions will examine China’s policies to meet its growing need
for electricity and to curb emissions as well as analyze the opportunities
for investment in the sector and the legal framework under which
investors must operate. The ﬁnal day of the conference will be given
over to the vital topic of energy efﬁciency in all its guises.This is a crucial
component part of the machinery to tackle climate change and meet
demand expectations. China has set itself challenging targets in the area
of energy saving.

CHINA POWER OIL & GAS 2008 PRE-SHOW GUIDE

WHY THE NEED
FOR CHINA POWER OIL & GAS?
The Zhujiang (Pearl) River Delta and its surrounding provinces
are growing economically at a rate faster than any other region
in the world. The region knows that without massive continued
investment in its energy structure, energy shortages will act as a
brake to continued growth. Consequently, there are estimated
to be in excess of $100 billion of energy related projects on the
table in this region right now seeking investment, equipment and
technological expertize.
Driven both by edict from Central Government and the need
to enhance the quality of life for all their citizens, the provincial
governments of South China are serious about tackling the
environmental impact of increased energy use. This will require
huge investment in both environmentally friendly forms of
generation as well as huge increases in energy efﬁciency on the
demand side.
China’s population increases year on year by 21 million people.
Economic forecasts remain consistently strong for China. GDP
growth is expected to be 11.4 per cent in 2007 and is forecast
to be 10.1 per cent in 2008 and 9.2 per cent in 2009. Inﬂows
of foreign direct investment into China totalled $86.1 billion in
2005, a new record and roughly double the level of 2001.

At the end of 2005, China had an installed generating capacity
of about 622 GW.
Coal remains the dominant source for power generation and
will continue to be so for the foreseeable future although its
share will fall to about 64 per cent (from the current 75 per
cent) by 2020, due to environmental concerns.
China is also increasing its installed capacity of gas ﬁred
generation. In 2002, the installed capacity of gas turbines and
combined cycle plants totalled about 5000 MW. By 2020 this
ﬁgure is expected to reach 60 GW representing about six per
cent of the total installed capacity.
As organizers of CHINA POWER OIL & GAS, PennWell
Corporation’s leading role and contacts in the energy related
international exhibitions and conferences ﬁeld including the
POWER-GEN series of conferences and exhibitions, Power
Engineering International magazine, the Oil & Gas Journal along
with a large number of other events and publishing ventures,
uniquely positions the company to bring the international energy
sector directly to this exciting market.

China has proven oil reserves of 2.2 billion tonnes (t), natural
gas reserves of 2.3 trillion m3 and coal reserves of more than 1
trillion tonnes. China is now the world’s second largest importer
of oil, after the US. Its demand for oil has doubled over the
past decade to 6.75 million barrels/day and the US Energy
Information Administration projects this will reach 10.9 million
barrels/day by 2025. According to the government, during the
11th Five Year Plan (2006-2010) the country’s oil production
will increase from 900 million tonnes to 1 billion tonnes per
annum.

WHY GUANGDONG/ WHY GUANGZOU?
More than 60,000 foreign enterprises have gone into business in
the Guangdong province since 1979.
Guangdong is nationally number 1 in GDP, urban population
income, retail sales, exports imports and ownership of
motorcycles and air conditioners. Hong Kong accounts for 2/3
of ﬁrms investing in the province.
Rapid economic growth has resulted in an energy supply gap
and serious environmental protection problems for Guangdong
Province. Guangdong’s energy consumption reached 110 million
tonne of coal equivalents by the year 2005 and will reach 150
million tonne by 2010. The province is expected to gradually
reduce its reliance on small coal ﬁred power plants replacing
them with large clean coal and gas ﬁred power plants for the
sake of environmental protection.
• The economies in South China have grown
at an unprecedented rate. For example, the Guangdong
economy alone has grown more than 60 times over since
1980.
• Nearly 40 per cent of all China’s trade is now generated in
Guangdong, Fujian and other southern provinces.
Guangdong province now accounts for 40 per cent of
China’s import and exports.

In September 2007, PennWell organized China’s Energy Future,
a two-day conference in Guangzhou, which set the scene for
CHINA POWER OIL & GAS. The 300 delegates that gathered
for the conference were addressed by municipal and state
leaders particularly from China’s southern provinces, who
deﬁned the scale of the task that the country faces and invited
foreign investment and technical expertise to partner in future
projects that would serve to meet the country’s needs. China’s
Energy Future proved conclusively that there was a need for
a major global forum to seriously address China’s current and
future energy needs.
There are no comparable events to CHINA POWER OIL &
GAS that address such a broad range of energy technologies
at a strategic and technical level and attract such a high level of
senior management and decision makers from the Chinese and
international business community.
With the active support of CCCME and other organizations
based in China and the region, CHINA POWER OIL & GAS is set
to become the pre-eminent energy forum for the international
power, petroleum, oil and gas community to interact with their
counterparts in China.

• The seaports of the greater Pearl River Delta now handle
one container, every second of every hour of every day 365 days a year.
WHY GUANGZHOU?
China’s third largest city, Guangzhou is the capital city of the
province of Guangdong. Located at the north of the Zhujiang
(Pearl) River Delta, Guangzhou has already become South
China’s centre of commerce, ﬁnance, communication, culture,
science and technology.
From 1980 to 1993, Guangzhou’s GDP increased by an average
of 13.98 per cent annually, and its ﬁnancial revenue increased by
an average of 16.4 per cent annually. In recent years, Guangzhou’s
economic strength is growing steadily, ranking third in the
nation. The steady and fast growth in economy has increased
Guangzhou’s development force and has enhanced its regional
position, thus making it one of the China’s major cities.

CHINA POWER OIL & GAS 2008 PRE-SHOW GUIDE

CHINA’S 11TH FIVE-YEAR PLAN
The 11th ﬁve year plan for national economy and social
development is based on an all-around development strategy of
economic growth, construction of a political civilization, cultural
and social construction. Unlike previous ﬁve-year plans, it is no
longer an instruction but a blueprint made by the government.
After three decades of rapid growth at 9.5 per cent on annual
rate, China’s GDP is the 4th largest and its international trade is
the 3rd largest in the world. As a result, the demand for energy

has dramatically increased and China’s economy is still not
efﬁcient enough to maintain the high growth. Therefore China
needs relatively more energy. In the ﬁrst half of 2006 China’s
imports of crude coal, crude oil and reﬁned oil increased by
51%, 15.6% and 16.1% respectively. Unfortunately China’s high
growth has been achieved at a cost to the environment. As a
result the government has committed to build a conserving and
environmentally friendly economy in its 11th ﬁve-year plan.

CHINA POWER OIL & GAS 2008 PRE-SHOW GUIDE

ENERGY EFFICIENCY
MORE URGENT THAN EVER
The ﬁnal day of the conference has been dedicated to the
vital topic of energy efﬁciency in all its guises. This is a crucial
component part of the machinery to tackle climate change
and meet demand expectations. China has set itself challenging
targets in the area of energy saving.
Under the pressure of climate change, sustainable development
and energy security, energy efﬁciency - the ﬁfth energy besides
coal, petroleum, natural gas and renewable energy - is now more
urgent than ever, especially in China.
Despite its limited energy reserves per capita, China has
experienced increased energy consumption and intensiﬁed
environmental pollution leading to evidence of climate change,
such as desertiﬁcation. China’s leaders have recognized the
urgent need for the country to take immediate actions to shape
its clean energy future in which energy efﬁciency is the focus.

Key China Facts
• Coal, oil, and natural gas reserves per capita in China
are 1/2, 1/10, and 1/20 of the global average.
• China faces a shortage of oil and natural gas supply
in the long term.
• Energy consumption is responsible for 80 per cent
of the total discharge of SO2 and particulates
• Acid rain affects
country’s total area.

more

• More than 90 per cent of the coal ﬁred power plants
have not installed desulphurization unit.

The Chinese government has given priority to energy efﬁciency
in China’s National Energy Plan 2020 and “The 11th Five-Year
Economic Plan”. It has also published Energy Conservation Law
and established the National Energy Bureau. China has set a unit
energy consumption reduction target of 20 per cent for the
ﬁve-year period from 2006 to 2010 - but the country is already
well behind schedule.
Some national or local NGOs are actively involved in China’s
energy conservation efforts as well. These include the Energy
Conservation Service Industry Committee of China Energy
Conservation Association (EMCA) and the Energy Saving
Cooperation Alliance (ESCA), along with the newly established
Hong Kong Association of Energy Service Companies
(HAESCO).
The Chinese government has launched an energy saving drive and
is promoting energy efﬁciency in society. Just this year, provincial
governments will be required to install 50 million energy efﬁcient
light bulbs. Energy efﬁciency business opportunities in China will
be signiﬁcant both in terms of investment and equipment. China
Power Oil & Gas recognizes this important aspect of China’s
energy strategy and devotes the third day of the conference to
the topic of energy efﬁciency. This will be a unique opportunity
to better understand the challenges and opportunities facing
this vital sector.

It takes extraordinary expertise
to make well placements
extraordinarily precise.
The extreme complexities of many existing oil and gas reservoirs
make optimal well positioning critically important. To that end,
economic success is based squarely on the right combination of
experienced geosteering specialists, superior technology to guide
the bit and an accurately placed and optimized bottomhole assembly with the correct MWD or LWD components.
Halliburton’s abundance of these critical resources—plus real-time
drilling technology and process optimization that’s viewed within a
Halliburton Real Time Center™ (where drilling is connected with
geophysicists and geologists)—can result in reduced rig costs and
increased reserve recovery and production. All this, with enhanced
safety and diminished environmental risk.
To meet your precise well-placement challenges, unleash

Safety, staff top drilling concerns

A

dvanced technologies continue to make an impact on
the global oil and natural gas drilling sector.
But in the end, the top issues for drilling contractors and the service and supply companies that support them remain the same as they have in recent years: safety
performance and the lack of qualiﬁed personnel.

Skills shortages
John W. Lindsay, 2008 chairman of the International Association of Drilling Contractors (IADC) and executive vice-president, US and international operations, Helmerich & Payne
International Drilling Co., is focused on the attraction and
retention of quality personnel as a critical issue facing the industry today.
“There is more experience retiring from the industry than
we are replacing with new employees, and, of course, the
new employees don’t have the same knowledge base,” he
says. “There are some advantages inherent in the new employees because they have different skill sets, new ideas, and
don’t carry some of the old habits that have resisted new and
improved practices in the past. Our challenge is to incorporate
these new personnel and skills into collaborative organizations that will lead our industry onto the paths forward.”

performance. Hiring and training efforts are constantly being
upgraded to meet the challenge. The industry is also taking
evaluation of personnel much more seriously through core
competency testing programs.”
Personnel development has always enjoyed a priority at
H&P, Lindsey says.
“Since 1998, we have raised the level of efforts and results
by building new rigs with the latest technology and safetyby-design to attract the best personnel,” he says. “In addition to the new rigs, we have also designed a training facility,
known as the Personnel Development Center, in Houston that
shares a common location with our new FlexRig assembly facility. Both new and experienced rig personnel spend several
weeks learning about safety, leadership, team building, and
rig equipment. This initial training is a long-term investment
in our personnel with the objectives of working safely and efﬁciently for our customers.”

Drilling safety

There is some debate about whether or not the drilling industry
is improving its safety record. In the Feb. 26, 2007, Oil & Gas
Journal Technology Forum: Drilling Technology, several industry
experts interviewed noted that IADC statistics showed that
drilling safety performance had
been ﬂat in recent years.
“There is more experience retiring from the industry than
“I think the fact that [accident

safety records in the future.”

change is required from an increasingly mobile, global workforce” to bolster the industry’s drilling safety performance.
But Lindsey disagrees that safety performance has ﬂattened
in recent years, noting that man-hours worked in the US land
drilling sector have doubled in the past 5 years.
The IADC total recordable rate has gone from 5.83 to 4.31 in
the US land sector from 2003 to 2008 year-to-date—down 25%
since 2003—even with man-hours increasing from 50 million in
2003 to 100 million in 2007, he says.
“I believe new rig technology and improved training are
the catalysts for this performance improvement,” he explains.
“With the addition of 300 new rigs and 400 refurbished rigs, a
large portion of the ﬂeet has safety designed into the rigs that
didn’t exist previously.
“In addition to better rigs, industry training has improved,
creating an expectation for many contractors that ‘incidentfree’ operations are possible. A reality of today’s workforce is
that 22-year-olds are not willing to work in an industry where
the expectation is that he or she has a high probability of being
injured in the ﬁrst 12 months of work. The industry is getting
better at safety, and along with that reputation, a cycle of success will continue to encourage better results into the future.”
Lindsey has made the safety challenge the top priority for
his vision for IADC.
“Improving industry safety is a cornerstone of [IADC’s] mission,” he notes. “The decision to operate safely is the most im-

R V I C E S

“I don’t have the answer for how we improve, but improve
we must. I suspect the solution is similar to the commitment
our industry has made in its safety effort, whereby all IADC
members—drilling contractors, E&P companies, and service
providers—work in a collaborative way toward a common goal
of enhancing environmental responsibility. After all, we owe it
to ourselves, our communities, and our individual companies.”

Rig supply

The least of the drilling sector’s worries these days seems to
be any concerns over another rig glut developing.
“I don’t believe there will develop an oversupply of rigs in
the next 3 years, due to operator demands for new rigs, attrition of old rigs, and the supply chain for new rigs,” Lindsey says.
“Operators today have a demand for more-efﬁcient rigs due to
the difﬁculty of wells being drilled. There will continue to be rigs
sidelined by operators because the rig does not have the ability
to drill wells in a safe and efﬁcient manner.
“The lingering question is what contractors do with the old
rigs. One common response is that the old rigs can be sent
overseas. I don’t think that will be a successful strategy because
the international ﬂeet is very old, and operators in international
locations have desires to improve efﬁciency and safety.
“Attrition of land rigs has been artiﬁcially low for the last
4 years due to the rig count demands placed on the ﬂeet, so
many of the rigs that are stacked today will probably be written
off. In addition to operator demand
and attrition slowing rig oversupply, I don’t believe the supply chain

HDorB in the US, which translates to retooling continuing as long as operators
have demanding well proﬁles and the desire to deliver wells more efﬁciently,”
he concludes.
Sutherland says he thinks that “much of the available ‘good’ iron is already in
action, thus newbuilds are the logical option.”
Thomas, however, contends that “a lot of the land ﬂeet is being retooled already, with more and more focus on rig automation to offset the lowered experience levels seen in the industry.”

Drilling activity drivers
Drilling for unconventional gas has changed the business for drilling contractors,
Lindsey contends.
“Because of the nature of the well cycles and decline rates on unconventional wells and the need to drill literally thousands of wells in these plays, this
reality has given contractors the opportunity to apply new ideas and innovation
on how to enhance productivity and safety, reinvest in their ﬂeets, and have
some certainty of work to pay for their investments,” he points out. “I heard the
term ‘gas factory’ drilling in 2004, and I think that term describes very well how
the game has changed. We are manufacturing wellbores with mobile manufacturing units, and we must ﬁgure out ways to improve the manufacturing process
annually. Those companies that have the best ideas and rig performance will be
in the best position to grow as unconventional resource plays are exploited in
the US and expand globally.”
Unconventional oil and gas reserves are having a huge impact on drilling
markets, Sutherland concurs.
“The ability to economically extract hydrocarbons from previously thought
‘nonproductive’ rocks, through horizontal drilling and completion techniques, is
truly a testament to a technology-driven industry,” he says. “Unlocking these
unconventional reserves now while commodity prices are high, using advanced
drilling and completion techniques, will help sustain the industry when commodity prices are not as robust. The techniques being reﬁned now to unlock these
reserves will be translated to similar basins around the world as they mature.”
At the same time, the challenge of developing unconventional gas is helping
to drive technology improvements at a quicker rate, Thomas points out.
Similarly, “High commodity prices are making the high-risk deepwater plays
very attractive,” Sutherland notes. “We are pushing the limits of water depth,
well depth, pressure, and temperature every day. Our ability to deliver drilling
tools for these environments is key for our success in deepwater.”
Sally Charpiot, Halliburton marketing manager for production enhancement,
reckons that offshore rig-building activity “is more active than it has been for
nearly 25 years.
“The backlog for ultradeepwater rigs is 5 to 6 years. Additionally, the old rig
ﬂeets are coming into shipyards for upgrades. Optimizing rig time with scalable,
on-time solutions is extremely valuable.”
Quintero points to the industry legacy of cyclicality: “As we all know, this
industry is cyclical. The only thing we know for sure is that rising cycles will
eventually come down. The question is when. That said, I believe the macroeconomic fundamentals are still good, and units, especially in deep water, are
generally contracted for several years to come, pointing to at least a few more
years of high demand.”
The deepwater boom is already having an impact on the types of offshore
rig being built today, adds Quintero: “Out of 40-plus semisubmersibles currently under construction, only two are not dynamically positioned (DP), and
only eight are not ultradeepwater. With the aging of the existing ﬂeet, when

The most signiﬁcant technical challenges in the realm of
drilling ﬂuids are related to efforts to minimize downtime and
reduce overall well cost, says Newpark Drilling Fluids Pres.

“This is the far more important trend. I expect that trend to

Technology advances
Advances in rotary steerable systems (RSS) and measurementand logging-while-drilling top the lists of several experts as the
technologies making the biggest impacts in drilling today.
Development of RSS and MWD/LWD tools for high-pressure/
high-temperature (HPHT) downhole conditions is helping to open
up new deepwater horizons.
“Rotary steerable systems coupled with near-bit and deepreading petrophysical measurements are allowing for longer,
more accurately placed laterals,” Sutherland points out, adding
that such deployments have been an enabler for extreme deepwater drilling.
“The ability to log and evaluate reservoirs, immediately and
completely, using drilling tools, can result in huge savings and
reduced risk for deepwater wells,” he says. “Near-bit, deep-reading, and ‘look ahead/around’ petrophysical sensors and near-bit
and drillstring-distributed drilling mechanics sensors, coupled
with faster telemetry methods—such as wired pipe—will greatly
expand our ability to explore the deep water.”
Sutherland also speculates that casing/liner drilling and managed-pressure technology could emerge as routine deepwater
drilling cost reducers in the near future.

CTD expansion seen in US, Russia

P

roponents of coiled tubing drilling (CTD) are pressing
efforts to expand the growing practice in the US onshore drilling theater.
Until recently, CTD was commonplace in Canada
but almost nonexistent in the US Lower 48. Coiled tubing applications in the US to date have mostly involved well interventions, cleanouts, and the like, but using CT for drilling has been
rare. An exception is Alaska, where CTD has been an accepted
practice for over a decade.

Changing market
But the market is changing in favor of CTD, according to Steve
Carey, Baker Hughes INTEQ product line manager, slimhole
re-entry.
“At present, CTD is looking healthier than at any other time
during its long and checkered history,” he contends. “With the
right degree of commitment on the part of the operators and
CTD service providers, the practice is set to grow signiﬁcantly.”
That’s especially true in the US, Carey points out, which
has 50% of the CT services ﬂeet; there, he expects to see big
gains in CTD for both re-entry and grassroots drilling.

Holistic approached needed
Wider acceptance of CTD leading to its increased adoption
greatly depends on merging several key technologies and services to form a complete, seamless, and multidisciplined offering capable of successfully executing the full range of CT
drilling applications, says Carey.
“A holistic approach to practical ﬁeld development using
CTD would encompass surface and subsurface disciplines,
feasibility study, reservoir modeling and simulation, enhanced
reservoir access and oil recovery techniques, drilling and evaluation, well completion and production, facilities downstream
of choke, HS&E, and commercial aspects,” he adds. “Of equal
importance is the early recognition of when developments are
subeconomic or too risky to attempt. This approach provides
a thorough understanding of the key technical challenges and
their discrete and collective impacts to the project.”

CTD fleet

Greater availability of ﬁt-for-purpose CTD equipment that can be
more easily mobilized to cover a range of CTD applications is
paramount to expanding the practice of CTD, Carey contends.
“The emergence of fully automated hybrid CT rigs, combined
with equally important advances
in subsurface technologies—e.g.,

tion operations. Their inherent inefﬁciencies of operation coupled
with their labor intensiveness will lead to their demise.”

Personnel issues
A continuous effort and commitment to increase the pool of CTD
personnel through training is also required, Carey points out.
“Right now, a shortage of experienced personnel is an even
greater barrier to CTD growth than equipment or technology,”
he says. “Typically we can react quickly and provide more hardware at short notice; however, we do not keep pace when developing and training a competent labor force. Today we suffer
from a ‘shortage of experience’ which may well be the result of
previous industry downturns. This shortage must be addressed
to redress the balance and keep pace with increased activity.”
Carey believes that a focused effort on training new recruits and on developing existing human resources via crosstraining would have a positive impact on the CTD labor force
in the short term.
“Increased recruitment of engineers and their development
speciﬁcally for CTD is needed in the longer term,” he adds.
“It’s preferable that personnel possess a breadth of experience
covering conventional drilling in addition to CTD practices, e.g.,
competent CT directional drillers are still a rarity.”

CTD technology issues
Recent advances in technology, along with a growing “knowledge
database” for the application of CTD, have brought the industry
to a tipping point where the practice of CTD is set to increase
greatly, according to Carey. He notes efforts by several service
companies to develop hybrid CTD units; advanced CTD transport systems; advanced CTD bottomhole assemblies; smaller,
automated-integrated CTD units; advanced formation evaluation
for smaller hole sizes (2 7/8 –4¾ in.); improved completions and
frac systems; improved window milling and exiting systems;
improved coil speciﬁcations and manufacturing processes; and
advanced monitoring systems (surface and downhole).

Integrated packages/services
Carey insists that the further integration of a range of services
and technologies is required to enable the provision of a CTD
package to operators who have limited experience in the application of CTD.
“Effectively integrating surface and subsurface products and
services into a complete CTD package will make the application
more available to a wider customer base,” he says. “The lack of
experience in planning and executing CTD—and a perception of
CTD as ‘high-risk’—generates a degree of discomfort (out-ofcomfort-zone) from the conventional drilling community. UBD
and MPD are still widely unaccepted and are often thought to
be too dangerous and not worth the added hassle.”
Because CTD is generally more complex than conventional
drilling, its success depends greatly on the seamless integration of many distinct services and disciplines to form one coherent, focused team, according to Carey.

“In UB CTD, the drilled lateral is often produced while drilling,” he notes. “Geosteering, ECD control, hole-cleaning, logging, optimizing drilling and coil parameters to avoid dysfunctions, monitoring production-while-drilling, and reinjection are
carried out in real time, with everyone working in concert to
optimize the operation.”
CTD is much less forgiving than conventional drilling, Carey
adds: “Its smaller scale often leads to higher pressures, smaller
annular clearances, and differential sticking in highly depleted
zones. Also, less robust hardware and the inability to rotate
complicate the situation further.”

Coiltrak
INTEQ began its development of CTD systems in 1990, and
continuous investment and reﬁnement led to the launch of the
CoilTrak system in 2002, according to Carey. “CoilTrak is a sophisticated directional drilling system capable of precisely positioning the wellbore within the productive reservoir using CT,”
he says. “CoilTrak’s unique downhole sensors provide real-time
measurement and interpretation of the drilling environment and
allow for subsequent actions on drilling and formation events
that optimize the drilling process.
“CoilTrak’s directional drilling BHA contains automated
closed-loop steering functionality complete with downlinking
from surface to precisely steer slimhole wells. An electric hydraulic orienter controls the tool face while drilling in the desired direction. The ability to automate direction-holding within
an exceptionally small tolerance ensures the optimal exit from
the predrilled well and unmatched precision when placing the
well bore in the productive reservoir.
“CoilTrak’s formation evaluation capabilities combine to
allow for accurate geosteering by joystick control in underbalanced and often hostile drilling environments. The system
reliability is evidenced from its world record of over 12 days
continuous drilling multilaterals to expose more than 14,000 ft
of reservoir from one single motherbore. CoilTrak went on to
drill more than 340,000 ft from 40 reentered wells and completely reversed production decline, revitalizing an otherwise
uneconomic depleted gas ﬁeld.”
INTEQ continues to develop CoilTrak’s capabilities through
the addition of advanced formation evaluation and completion
services, Carey points out.
“CoilTrak’s Rib Steering Motor (RSM) applies the same principles as AutoTrak, INTEQ’s rotary steerable system, to drill a
smoother, extended lateral with coil tubing, whereas a bentmotor plus orienter conﬁguration creates a continuous dogleg
while slide drilling and increases tortuosity,” he says. “The RSM
creates a smooth well path using ribs to direct and control the
direction of the bit in 3D.”
CoilTrak’s formation evaluation modules also allow for geosteering and navigating the wellbore to intersect the producing horizon in complex faulted and compartmentalized reservoirs, Carey notes: “By steering a smooth wellbore within the
productive zone and avoiding exiting through roof or ﬂoor, the

Additional CoilTrak completion systems are being tested to
allow for running, setting, and cementing liners and for a variety
of other completion applications using e-line coil and without
the need for swapping reels, he adds.
“CoilTrak’s intelligent downhole sensors are utilized in our
Smart Well Intervention systems to provide for delicate downhole operations such as ﬁshing or milling, and not otherwise possible using conventional CT,” Carey says. “CoilTrak’s sensors are
capable of sensing minute changes downhole and in real time

COVER
The technology to turn natural gas into fuel for vehicles has
been available since World War II. Yet only 2.2% of the energy
consumed in the US goes into gas-fueled cars and trucks. Natural
gas vehicles are rapidly increasing worldwide, however, due to high
oil prices, the need for energy security, and environmental concerns.
Beginning on p. 20, Oil & Gas Journal’s special report on Gas as a
Transport Fuel examines the emergence of gas-to-liquids technology, the newest of the gas fuel alternatives; as well as the increased
use of a proven standby—propane, already the third most popular
vehicle fuel in the US after gasoline and diesel.The article also
looks at the expanding roles of compressed gas, already popular in
South America, and liquefied natural gas in fueling millions of
NGVs around the world.

IEA again cuts 2009 oil demand forecast
In its latest monthly Oil Market Report, the International Energy
Agency has revised downward its outlook for 2009 worldwide oil
demand.
The Paris-based agency now sees worldwide demand averaging
84.7 million b/d, down 570,000 b/d from its previous projection.
The new forecast would mean that demand will decline 1 million
b/d from 2008.
The revised outlook puts average 2009 oil demand in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development at 46 million
b/d, which is 340,000 b/d lower than in IEA’s previous forecast.
Meanwhile, non-OECD demand is cut 230,000 b/d to 38.7 million b/d.
These demand outlook reductions follow a bleaker economic
outlook from the International Monetary Fund, which now forecasts that global growth in gross domestic product will be a measly
0.5% this year. IEA says that widespread financial and economic
collapse are now the key brakes on global oil demand.
With 2009 non-OECD oil demand now expected to climb only
500,000 b/d from last year, IEA sees the outlook for Asia and the
former Soviet Union as particularly grim.
“Oil demand growth in China is thus expected to be less than a
fifth of what was recorded in recent years, while in the rest of Asia
and the FSU growth will probably be nil. Only Latin America and
the Middle East, partly insulated by price subsidies and, in the case
of the Middle East, a strong fiscal position, will be able to sustain
relatively strong growth—but at about half the pace of previous
years,” IEA said.

EIA raises global oil demand decline forecast
Global petroleum demand, according to the US Energy Information Administration, will fall by another 400,000 b/d during
2009 as economic conditions worsen. EIA reported Feb. 10 in its
latest short-term energy outlook that it now projects worldwide oil
consumption will drop by 1.2 million b/d this year as a deteriorating world economy and a weak oil consumption outlook keep the
market well supplied—despite two downward revisions in the last
2 months by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Reduced demand and rising surplus production capacity
through at least mid-2009 reduce the possibility for a strong and
sustained oil price rebound over that period, the federal energy
analysis and forecasting service said.

“OPEC is scheduled to meet in Vienna on Mar. 15, which could
lead to another production cut to mitigate some of the slack in the
world oil market. However, near-month oil prices will likely be
driven primarily by the global economy,” it noted.
EIA now assumes that global gross domestic product, weighted according to shares of world oil consumption, will decline by
0.1% in 2009 and rise by 3% in 2010. January’s short-term energy
outlook assumed 0.6% growth in real GDP in 2009 and 3% growth
in 2010.
In the US, EIA expects GDP to fall by 2.7% this year, triggering
consumption declines for all major fuels. Retail regular gasoline
prices are projected to average $1.95/gal nationwide in 2009 and
$2.19/gal in 2010.

Study sees pause in oil sands output growth
The oil price slump will stall for several years but not reverse
growth of production from Alberta’s deposits of oil sand and heavy
oil, says the Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI).
A report by David McColl, CERI chief economist, forecasts oil
sands production of 1.9-2.9 million b/d in 2015 and 3.7-5.4 million b/d in 2030.
Oil sands production in 2007, the last full year for which an
annual average is available, was 1.2 million b/d, according to the
Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.
The new CERI projection updates estimates published last June,
before crude oil prices fell.
The reference-case forecast at that time was for steady growth
of oil sands production to 3.4 million b/d by 2015 and 5 million
b/d by 2030.
The new outlook assumes the price of West Texas Intermediate
crude stays below $60/bbl for most of 2009 and credit markets
continue to lack liquidity. It assumes economic recovery begins in
early 2010, with liquidity slowing returning to the economy.
Growth in oil sands output will not resume until 2 years after
the economy recovers, McColl says. It initially will be limited to
established oil sands projects and others with financing in place
before the credit collapse of last year.
The new forecast cuts the estimate for investment in new oil
sands production to $218 billion (Can.) from $315 billion in the
reference-case outlook last year.
The study assumes that expansion of the oil sands industry requires a WTI price above $70/bbl. ✦

5,500 ft of water 55 miles off Haifa, can be completed at a producing rate of more than 150 MMcfd, Noble Energy said. The company’s predrill estimate of resource potential was 3.1 tcf.
The well tested at 30 MMcfd limited by equipment capacity
from a 59-ft interval in the lowermost reservoir. Drilled to 16,076
ft, it cut more than 460 ft of net pay in three high-quality reservoirs.
The group led by Noble Energy will move the Atwood Hunter
semisubmersible to drill the Dalit prospect in 4,500 ft of water
on the Michal license 28 miles off Haifa. Proposed total depth is

California blocks state waters oil project
The California State Lands Commission voted not to approve an
extended reach drilling project that would have recovered nearly
100 million bbl of oil and brought as much as $5 billion to the
financially insolvent state.
Plains Exploration & Production Co., Houston, had proposed in
2005 to drill 17 wells from shore and from existing Platform Irene
to develop the Tranquillon Ridge prospect. Drilling was to start in
2009 and continue 5-6 years, and production would last 14 years.
Lt. Gov. John Garamendi, commission chairman and a former
deputy Interior secretary under former US President Bill Clinton,
said the plan “would signal that California wants to open offshore
drilling.” Garamendi also said US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (DCalif.) and other members of the California congressional delegation had concerns the lease would have undercut their attempts to
reintroduce a federal moratorium on offshore drilling.

Eni builds energy partnership with Sonangol
Eni SPA will evaluate setting up an onshore electric power plant
in Angola that will use associated gas under a new agreement
signed with Sonangol to boost that country’s energy facilities and
industrial activities.
Sonangol and Eni also will conduct a joint study to evaluate
highly prospective Angolan onshore basins and their production
potential.
According to their third agreement, the companies will focus
on educational projects and training of Angolan professionals, Eni
said.
These agreements build upon a memorandum of understanding
signed in August 2008 when the companies pledged to strengthen
their strategic cooperation and for Eni to contribute to Angola’s
energy, social, industrial, and educational spheres.
Eni has been in Angola since 1980, has equity production of
140,000 boe/d, and operates deepwater Block 15/06. ✦

OPEC delays 35 projects due to falling prices
Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, their economies battered by falling oil prices, have delayed 35
of 150 planned oil drilling projects by at least 4 years.
“Current prices threaten the very sustainability of planned investment,” said OPEC Sec. Gen. Abdalla Salem El-Badri in a speech
at London’s Royal Institute for International Affairs (RIIA).
“These projects are on hold…and will continue to be until the
[oil] price recovers,” El-Badri said, adding that of the 150 projects
due to come on line in the next few years, 35 had been set back
to after 2013.
“The start-up dates of many other projects are still expected to
slip,” said El-Badri, who noted that that oil has fallen to $40/bbl
from a record near $150/bbl in July, resulting in a loss to OPEC of
some $356 billion.
“This year our income will be cut by 50%,” he said.
UAE Oil Minister Mohammed al-Hamli, underlining El-Badri’s
view, said at $40/bbl, the price of crude now is about half that
required to attract enough investment in new supply.
“It is clear that if oil prices remain low for much longer, the
negative investment trend will increase to such an extent that large
supply shortages will develop when the present economic woes are

In return for being allowed to tap oil in the fractured Miocene
Monterey formation 4-6 miles off the northern Santa Barbara
County coast, Plains had offered to stop offshore oil drilling by
2022 and shut its oil and gas handling plant at Lompoc. Tranquillon Ridge would have been the first new lease granted in state waters since the 1969 oil spill.
Tom Bjorklund of the University of Houston wrote that the US
Minerals Management Service estimates that discovered and undiscovered conventionally recoverable oil and gas resources of the
Pacific OCS federal waters range from 14 to 19 billion bbl of oil
equivalent. Potential in state waters may reach 3.4 billion boe, he
said.

over,” al-Hamli told listeners at RIIA.
The UAE oil minister expressed OPEC’s worry that low prices
could lead to lower future supplies, potentially causing prices to
surge when demand eventually does recover.
OPEC’s view was met with skepticism from industry analysts.
“They’re only hurting themselves,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst
at Alaron Trading Corp., one of several who warned that taking
production projects off line represented short-term thinking on
the part of OPEC members.
According to Flynn, any spike in crude prices because of production declines from OPEC members will make it harder for
economies to recover and for demand to pick up naturally. Then,
he said, when demand does pick up, OPEC members won’t have
the production capacity to meet it.

Eni to use FPSO concept in Goliat ﬁeld

lion bbl. It will grant Eni a license to use the FPSO in the field, which
is to start production in 2013 and produce for 15-20 years.
It is estimated that the engineering phase, following the frontend engineering and design phase, will be completed during
2009. The estimated value for the contract is 150 million kroner.
The plan was for Eni to submit its final plan to the Norwegian authorities by yearend 2008, followed by a Parliament review in the
spring session of 2009.
Subsea wells will be linked to the FPSO, with flowlines and risers scheduled to be installed in June-July 2010 and May-August
2011.
Potential bidders, including Sevan Marine’s main competitor
Aker Kvaerner AS, will have the opportunity to bid on the engineering, procurement, and construction contract for the Goliat
FPSO, an Eni Norge spokesman told OGJ.
The company will issue a new tender for the EPC, but it has not
yet decided the timetable. “Originally we were going to choose the
concept and award the EPC at the same time, but now there is a
change in the market as costs are coming down and we could benefit from waiting [to] select the contractor,” he explained.
Aker Kvaerner said it would present a competitive delivery
model and tender for the EPC contract and will aim to construct
the topside and processing modules, as well as the hook up, in
Norway.
Eni said it chose the FPSO production concept because it was
cheaper, could tie-in future discoveries, and had better environmental advantages than landfall solutions.

Florida’s Jay ﬁeld idle in cost-price squeeze
Quantum Resources Management LLC, Denver, informed interest owners that it had suspended production from giant Jay oil and
gas field in the Florida Panhandle on Dec. 22, 2008.
The dramatic decline in oil prices and high operating expenses
led to the action, Quantum said, adding that it maintains the capability to reestablish production and is “analyzing alternative production scenarios that might result in improved economics.”

Senate urged to deny higher ethanol blending cap
A coalition of associations and organizations asked the US Senate on Feb. 6 not to approve a provision in the economic stimulus
bill it is debating that would increase the current ethanol blending
cap.
The National Petrochemical & Refiners Association and 18 other
groups said that adopting such a provision would short-circuit the
Clean Air Act regulatory structure for approving the introduction of
new fuels or fuel blends, and would lead to increased air emissions
from gasoline-powered engines and potentially endanger consumers.
“In our collective opinion, a decision on whether to permit
the use of ethanol concentration in excess of 10% in gasoline (socalled ‘midlevel ethanol blends’) in motor vehicle and equipment
engines must be guided solely by sound, unbiased, and comprehensive science and must hold true to the fundamental purposes

Quantum informed royalty owners, including LL&E Royalty
Trust, Austin, that it is analyzing all options to reduce operating
costs.
Discovered in 1970, Jay field in Santa Rosa County was estimated to have 763 million bbl of original oil in place, of which 458
million bbl was judged recoverable. Jay had produced 369 million
bbl through 1990 and was down to about 4,000 b/d of oil and
large volumes of water in recent years.

Shell lets contract for Gumusut-Kakap work
Sabah Shell Petroleum Co. Ltd. Sdn. Bhd. awarded JP Kenny Wood
Group a contract for subsea integration and follow-up engineering
work for the Gumusut-Kakap deepwater development in 1,300 m
of water, 120 km off Sabah, Malaysia, on Blocks J and K.
The 4-year contract provides for specialist subsea engineers,
engineering studies, design, and follow-up engineering support
through the project’s fabrication and commissioning phases.
Sabah Shell will operate the development that includes the first
deepwater semisubmersible floating production facility off Malaysia. The facility has a design capacity for processing 150,000
bo/d.
Gumusut-Kakap will produce from 19 subsea wells with oil
exported via a pipeline to a new oil and gas terminal, planned
at Kimanis, Sabah. The project will reinject associated gas into the
reservoir to help improve oil recovery. Development drilling commenced in January 2008.
A 2006 unitization and unit operating agreement combined the
Gumusut and Kakap fields into a single development.
The semisubmersible is under construction at the Malaysia Marine & Heavy Engineering’s fabrication yard in Pasir Gudang, Johor,
Malaysia.
Sabah Shell completed the Gumusut discovery well in December 2003 on Block J. The well included a vertical well and two
sidetracks. The field extends into Block K on which Murphy operates the Kikeh field. ✦

In addition to NPRA, the coalition included the Alliance of
Automobile Manufacturers, American Lung Association, Engine
Manufacturers Association, Friends of the Earth, International
Snowmobile Manufacturers Association, Natural Resources Defense Council, Outdoor Power Equipment Institute, and Union of

“Collectively, our organizations strongly believe that this issue
should not be part of the economic stimulus package currently
under consideration by the United States Senate,” the letter continued. Before midlevel ethanol blends are allowed, testing by the US
Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy
should be allowed to continue, and the results must indicate that
higher ethanol blends in gasoline-powered engines do not pose a
threat to air quality or consumers, it urged.

South Korean reﬁners eye proﬁts, reduce closures Sudan to launch its ﬁrst ethanol mill in March
South Korean refiners, eyeing the possibility of increased overseas sales due to improved margins for fuel products, plan to shut
down less capacity during the peak maintenance season this year.
Asian refiners generally perform maintenance and safety checks
twice a year: between April and June, ahead of the peak summer
driving season, and again in October and November, before a surge
in heating fuel demand during winter.
But this year, according to a report by Bloomberg News, South
Korean refiners will close just two crude distillation units—totaling 410,000 b/d, or 15% of capacity—in the first half of June. That
compares with the closure of 24% of capacity during the same
period in 2008.
Jason Lee, a petroleum trading manager at SK Networks Co.,
explained that profits from exports are better than expected because of reduced run rates among Asian refiners such as Nippon
Oil which last month said it would reduce crude throughput by
12% from a year earlier in February.
Bloomberg cited a report by the Bank of America that said the
margin for refined products in Singapore was $8.34 in the week
ending Jan. 16, a 9% increase over the $7.65 recorded during the
same period in 2008.
The plans for closures include:
• SK Energy will close the 240,000 b/d No. 4 crude distillation
unit at its Ulsan refinery between Mar. 27 and Apr. 29; the 110,000
b/d No. 2 crude distillation unit June 3-30; and the 60,000 b/d
No. 1 crude distillation unit June 19-23.
• GS Caltex Corp. will shut the country’s largest crude distillation unit, the 300,000 b/d No. 4 unit at the Yosu refinery, between
May 7 and June 8.
• S-Oil Corp. will shut the 93,000 b/d No. 1 crude distillation
unit at the Onsan refinery Apr. 1-19.
• Hyundai Oilbank Co. doesn’t plan to halt any crude distillation units at its Daesan refinery.

Sudan’s state-owned Kenana Sugar Co.’s (KSC) first ethanol mill,
built by Brazil’s Dedini Industrias de Base, which builds facilities
for the sugar and ethanol industries, is set to begin operations at
the end of March. Situated within the KSC complex, 250 km south
of Khartoum, the mill is expected to produce about 61 million l./
year of alcohol from molasses made in the country.
Sudan’s ambassador to Brazil, Omer Salih Abubakr, said KSC is
contracted to supply 5 million l./year of ethanol to the UK.
Abubakr said about $800 million has been invested in the overall KSC project—largely sugar plantations and sugar mills—with
funds coming from several governments, including Sudan, Saudi
Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, and Japan.
Sudan is one of the leading sugar cane growers on the African
continent, producing slightly more than a million tonnes/year.
KSC exports most of it to the Middle East.
In July 2008, aiming to diversify its output and export potential,
the Sudanese government invited Brazilian ethanol facility contractors such as Dedini SA to build as many as 18 sugarcane ethanol
plants in the African country. “We have plans to expand the production of sugar and want Brazil to help us with this,” Sudan’s vicesecretary for foreign affairs, Mutrif Saddig, told Brazil’s state news
agency. “We are after Brazilian (ethanol) technology,” Saddig said.
At the time, Dedini said it was retrofitting an existing KSC sugar
cane milling unit with equipment necessary to make ethanol.
Until recently, about 80% of Dedini’s business has been confined to the Brazilian market, where sales have grown steadily at
20-30%/year for the past 5 years. But export markets are beginning to open. In August 2008, Indonesia’s Medco Group said it
would form a joint venture with Dedini to set up a bioethanol
plant in Papua, with production scheduled to begin in 2011.
“The plant will have a production capacity of 30,000 b/d and
will require an investment of $200 million,” said Arifin Panigoro,
Medco’s founder. ✦

Hydrogen worth pursuing

________________

12

In your Jan. 19 issue, Thomas Wyman
argues that, because “it simply takes more
energy to extract hydrogen from water
using electrolysis or to extract it from
methane using steam reformation than
can be obtained from the subsequent
use of the extract hydrogen as a fuel…
the pursuit of the hydrogen economy
brings to mind the age-old search for the
perpetual motion machine” (OGJ, Jan.
19, 2009, p. 14).
Mr. Wyman is ignoring the remainder
of the fuel cycle. Obtaining hydrogen
from natural gas is 65-75% efficient, so
we start by throwing away 25-35% of
the energy in the natural gas. For use
as a vehicle fuel, both natural gas and
hydrogen must be transported and compressed into a high pressure storage tank
onboard the vehicle; hydrogen probably
will end up the loser here, too, because
its low energy density demands a higher
storage pressure than natural gas for
equal range.
However, the saving grace is hydrogen’s end use efficiency onboard the
vehicle. The efficiency of a dedicated
natural gas vehicle, accounting for both
the weight of the storage tanks and the
efficiency boost from methane’s high
octane, is likely to be only slightly better than that of a gasoline vehicle with
similar technology. And right here is
hydrogen’s theoretical potential. If the
efficiency of a practical fuel cell system
can reach the levels hoped for, it will
be more than twice as efficient as an
internal-combusion-engine (ICE)-based
power train—with zero tailpipe emissions.
Although these results are a bit dated,
let me compare total fuel cycle energy
use for dedicated natural gas vehicles vs.
hydrogen (from natural gas) fuel cell
vehicles from the “1.5” version of Argonne National Lab’s GREET (fuel cycle)
model: The natural gas vehicle uses
about 3% more energy than a similar
gasoline vehicle; the hydrogen fuel cell
vehicle uses 50-60% less energy than a
similar gasoline vehicle.
I’d be the first to admit that these
values, especially the fuel cell values,
are based on assumptions about R&D

success. Also, I believe that future improvements in ICE engines and transmissions will make the energy comparison
somewhat less favorable to fuel cells. And
there are enormous cost and infrastructure development hurdles to be overcome before hydrogen fuel cell vehicles
can compete well with gasoline vehicles.
Nevertheless, a hydrogen economy is
no perpetual motion machine; it is an
option, one of several, worth pursuing
in any drive to reduce US dependence
on oil.

Marine transfer safety evolves

Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer

basket for his first “Billy Pugh” ride because veteran crew members conspired
with the crane operator to initiate the
new guy with a brief dip into the water.
Unlike decades ago, industry avails
itself of training schools, videos about
operational procedures, preflight safety
briefings, and transfer device inspections.
Liberato said the BP PLC-operated
Thunder Horse semisubmersible
platform reported 280,000 craneassigned personnel transfers without
any incidents. Thunder Horse’s quarters,

From a records search, Reflex Marine
assembled global information on 72
crane-transfer incidents associated with
11 deaths and 59 injuries. Of those
incidents, most of which occurred
since 2000, 49% involved falling, 38%
involved lateral impact (swinging), and
32% involved vertical impact (heavy
landing).

Addiction and tyranny
On the hierarchy of political metaphors, oil has
fallen another notch. Former President George W.
Bush institutionalized disrespect for the substance
when, in the 2006 State of the Union address, he
diagnosed the US as “addicted to oil.” President
Barack Obama now has brought his own poetics to the smear campaign. In a Feb. 5 speech at
the Department of Energy, he said his economic
stimulus proposal, full as it is of spending on
nonfossil energy, “will begin to end the tyranny of
oil in our time.”
The associations are as invalid as they are deliberately dark. If they guide policy-making, they’re
dangerous. And they are driving policy.

The Interior secretary was wholly unconvincing when he claimed to be imposing deliberation
on actions taken in a rush in the closing hours of
the Bush years. In fact, the relevant agencies have
solicited and received public comments on the
leasing moves. There was no “midnight action” to
sneak the OCS sale into effect, as Salazar said. There
is no absence of information on which to base
decisions. Following a familiar pattern, Salazar is
stalling to appease environmental extremists intent
on blocking leasing as a way to thwart supply and
ultimately use of oil and natural gas.
For the US to adopt the extreme antioil agenda—the only agenda truly served by nonsense
about addiction and tyranny—would be disasNot addicted

Natural gas, one of Earth’s cleanest,
most abundant resources, accounts for
22% of total US energy use but only
2.2% of the energy used in the US for
transportation, although the technology for natural gas vehicles (NGVs) has
been available since World War II.
“It took 60 years to grow the
worldwide NGV population to only 1.7
million vehicles by 2001,” said John
Lyon, president and CEO of
FuelMaker Corp. and former
president of the International
Association for Natural Gas
Vehicles, at the group’s June
meeting in Rio de Janeiro.
Since then, he said, “Something happened to drive the
NGV population to over 7 million vehicles, an astounding annual growth rate
of 26%.” NGVs have increased rapidly
in Europe and South America primarily
because of environmental concerns and
rising prices for crude, gasoline, and
diesel.

of 18%, Lyon said, “There will be 65

market (16% of today’s total world gas
demand).”
The US Department of Energy
expects alternative-fueled vehicles to
account for 10% of the US automobile
market by 2020 when more than 286
million vehicles will be on US roads.
To reach that goal, the US government is offering incentives, including fuel excise tax credits of 50¢/gal
for equivalent compressed natural gas
(CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG)
fuels. It also offers tax credits for 30%
of infrastructure costs; up to $1,000 for
home refueling appliance or as much as
$30,000 for a commercial project.
In an October study, DOE found, “Alternative fuel prices relative to conventional fuels vary, with some (biodiesel,
propane) higher and some (Ethylene 85
and CNG) lower. CNG is about $1.03
less than gasoline on an energy-equivalent basis, while E85 is about 22¢/
gal less than gasoline.” Although the
average US retail price of propane was
34¢/gal higher than the average price
for gasoline, propane prices
were “generally favorable”
in the West, DOE said.
It reported, “Prices for
the alternative fuels in
terms of cost per gallon
equivalent are generally
higher than their cost per
gallon because of their
lower energy content per
gallon. It has been seen,
however, that consumer
interest in alternative fuels
increases as the price differential per gallon increases,
even if that differential does
not directly translate to savings on an energy-equivalent basis.” Federal officials
also noted extreme weather
anywhere in the US can increase natural
gas prices.
NGVs cost more due to the need for
special fuel tanks and engine modifications. Heavy duty NGVs, such as trucks
and buses, typically use LNG rather than
CNG for their bigger engines. The most
established US niche market for gas as

In Europe, Italy has the most CNG

US federal tax credits are available
for buying new CNG vehicles, and there
are tax credits of up to 50% of the costs
of auto conversions and installation of
CNG home filling stations. Fueling CNG
vehicles from fuel lines in home garages
is on the rise in the US, particularly in
California and New York, and tax credits
are available for installing the necessary
appliance. However, overnight-fueling
from residential gas lines is forbidden
in some countries.
Because of state government subsidies, Utah—with 60 CNG fueling
stations, including 24 open to the
public—has the third largest US network of CNG fueling stations behind
California (218, with 111 public) and
New York (92, of which 27 have public access). However, Proposition 10,
a $5 billion bond measure that would
have provided rebates to state residents
for purchases of CNG vehicles, was
defeated by California voters, 59.8% to
40.2%, in 2008.

LNG
Because it is less polluting and the
cost relatively low compared with diesel, LNG is on the rise in the US transportation fuels market. It is produced in
a liquefaction process when natural gas
is cooled to –259° F. Due to the necessary special equipment, an average NGL
station would cost $1 million.
Because of its higher storage density,
proponents claim LNG is a more viable
alternative to diesel fuel than CNG.
Moreover, they say LNG in heavy-duty
natural gas engines achieves significantly lower NOx and particulate emission
levels than diesel.
Because of LNG’s increased driving
range, it is used in heavy-duty vehicles,
typically vehicles with gross weights of
33,000-80,000 lb.
In some regards, industry experts
said, LNG is safer than propane or gasoline because it is flammable only within

subject to accidental fire if vapors come
into contact with a spark or flame, and,
in the event of an accidental fire, methane tends to burn along a flame front
rather than explode. Being lighter than
air, methane generally rises and dissipates instead of accumulating at dangerous concentrations the way gasoline
and propane vapors do.
Still, fires and explosions can occur
under certain conditions. Furthermore,
LNG is stored as a pressurized liquid at
very low temperatures below –200° F.,
so handling and use are subject to the
general risks associated with any cryogenic fuel, including the risk of skin
and eye burns on contact.
Clean Energy Fuels Corp., formerly
Pickens Fuel Corp. founded by entrepreneur T. Boone Pickens, is the largest
provider of CNG and LNG, fueling
thousands of vehicles. In late November,
it started up the largest LNG production plant in the Southwest and the first
large-scale plant in California to produce up to 160,000 gal/day of LNG for
Clean Energy’s new LNG truck fueling
station in Carson, Calif. The station provides fuel for trucks serving the ports of
Los Angeles and Long Beach.
DOE said the two ports are the largest source of air pollution in the greater
Los Angeles area. The ports created a
Clean Truck Program as part of their
2006 Clean Air Action Plan to alleviate the pollution. That program, which
took effect Oct. 1, 2008, immediately
banned from the ports 2,000 trucks
built before 1989, the first year for pollution controls on diesel-fueled trucks.
By 2012, the program will bar any
trucks not complying with the cleanest
2007 emission standards. “Right now,
that adds up to another 14,000 trucks,”
port officials said.
The Clean Energy LNG plant in Boron, Calif., 125 miles northeast of Los
Angeles, is designed to expand production to as much as 240,000 gpd of LNG
as demand increases. The company has
begun construction of a second regional LNG truck fueling station, which
is scheduled for completion in March.

CERAWeek: Oil companies vow to maintain exploration
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
Oil companies must resist slashing
exploration and development activities during the economic downturn
if industry expects to supply energy
to meet projected long-term demand,
chief executives said Feb. 10 during an
energy conference in Houston.
Various speakers at the Cambridge
24

Energy Research Associates annual
conference said their current business
strategy involves avoiding the mistakes
of past downturns. They referred to the
1980s when industry cut budgets and
drilling activity to the point that consumers faced tight oil and gas supply
after the economy recovered.
Jeroen Van der Veer, chief executive
of Royal Dutch Shell PLC, said Shell believes it’s important to keep investing in

projects and to retain its workers rather
than to make sweeping layoffs such as
the industry has done previously when
oil prices slumped.
“Keep investing through the cycle,”
Van der Veer said. “Keep your professional base, your people” to maintain
operating stability when the economy
recovers. He believes the industry still
faces strong long-term fundamentals.

CERAWeek: Wintershall head guarantees Nord Stream
Christopher E. Smith
Pipeline Editor
Wintershall Chairman Reinier
Zwitserloot, speaking Feb. 10 in
Houston during a Q&A session following a Eurasia Transportation session at
Cambridge Energy Research Associates’
annual executive conference, placed the
likelihood of completing the trans-Baltic Nord Stream natural gas pipeline at
“100.00%.” The 762-mile, 48-in. Nord
Stream would connect Russia directly
to Germany. His remarks were made in
reaction to earlier descriptions of Nord
Stream as an alternative path for gas
deliveries to Europe.
Zwitserloot explained that by 2020
Europe will produce 100 billion cu
m/year less gas than it currently does.
At the same time, regardless of which
studies one looks at and no matter
26

how much alternative energy comes
on line, demand for gas in Europe will
continue to grow, Zwitserloot said. “In
all the studies—green, greener, not so
green—European demand for gas is going up.” Combining these factors, a gap
of 150-200 billion cu/m year emerges
between European supply and demand
by 2020 according to Zwitserloot.
Europe has a major natural gas
advantage over the Far East and the US,
Zwitserloot said: It is within pipeline
distance of most of the world’s gas reserves. LNG “is not the silver bullet” for
Europe, said Zwitserloot, it being more
likely to go to the US long term and
the Far East short term, with availability
to Europe limited. Similarly, plentiful
North African gas exists “only in [our]
dreams,” according to Zwitserloot, with
real development in places like Libya
still practically nonexistent.

Two alternative supply sources
remain, he explained: the Caspian and
more gas from Russia. The Nabucco
pipeline could be built, Zwitserloot
allowed, but the only realistic supply
source is Iran. Gas from Turkmenistan is
not crossing the Caspian, he said. It will
go instead either to Russia or Iran. Azerbaijani supplies could reach Europe, but
that is by no means certain; “so, your
choices for gas from the region are
either Iraq or Iran,” Zwitserloot said.
Additional gas from Russia will have
to be part of the path forward and will
require additional infrastructure. “The
Yamal system is full, full, full,” said
Zwitserloot. “The system through the
Ukraine is in very bad condition even
without the political problems and will
require large investments just to keep
capacity from shrinking year by year.”

not as an alternative or bypass route but

CERAWeek: Al-Naimi urges ‘inclusive energy strategy’
Calling for an “inclusive energy
strategy,” the Saudi Arabia minister of
petroleum and mineral resources listed
factors of price volatility among “newly
emerging challenges” facing the oil and
gas industry.
At a Cambridge Energy Research
Associates conference in Houston, Ali I.
Al-Naimi said those challenges include
globalized capital markets, emergence
of energy as an asset class, and climate
change.
Governments hoping to stabilize
markets have been slow to respond to
the new speed, scope, and complexity
of capital markets, Al-Naimi said.
At the same time, investors’ strategies for oil have become increasingly
sophisticated and oriented to trading
against other commodities and hedging
against the value of the dollar.
“There is no doubt in my mind that
increased speculative interest in oil contributed to the extreme price volatility
of the past few years,” Al-Naimi said.
“Market psychology” exaggerated
last summer’s oil-price surge and is
exaggerating the current price slump,
he said.
Al-Naimi said climate change will
more profoundly redefine the role of
governments and governmental intervention in energy markets than will the
economic crisis.
He called on the oil industry to lead
efforts to improve energy efficiency and
“provide consumers with a wide range
of affordable, cleaner energy choices.”
He said an oil price high enough to
encourage production from marginal
oil fields, unconventional resources, and
renewable energy sources is one of four
conditions of a stable oil market.
Oil prices also should be low enough

to facilitate economic growth and high
enough to provide returns to producers that allow for timely investment
and to encourage consumers to use oil
efficiently.
Al-Naimi described an “inclusive
energy strategy” as one that recognizes
risks and uncertainties, emphasizes
cost-effective solutions, and “does not

presuppose where we will find the solutions to the challenges we face.”
Policy should be robust and flexible, he said. “We can only do this by
separating what is theoretically possible
from what is realistic and by examining
the real economic costs and benefits of
various policy approaches.” ✦

hen the US House Natural
Resources Committee held the
first of three scheduled hearings on
offshore oil and gas leasing on Feb.
11, it marked the first opportunity
for the 111th Congress to discuss the
issue. House members haven’t been
silent on the matter, however. Led
by Reps. Kevin P. Brady (R-Tex.) and
John M. Shimkus (R-Ill.), Minority
Leader John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) and
67 other House Republicans asked
US President Barack H. Obama not to
close Outer Continental Shelf areas
months after congressional leasing
moratoriums expired.
“As you know, at the height of
our nation’s energy crisis last year,
the American people spoke with
one voice to express their outrage
when they saw that not only were
we dependent upon foreign oil, but
furthermore, that energy resources
located within American territory
were locked away and could not be
developed,” lawmakers told Obama
in a Feb. 4 letter, which also went to
US Interior Secretary Ken Salazar.
“Our national vulnerability was on
plain display for the American public
last summer because we lacked a
coherent energy policy to allow for
responsible energy exploration and
development,” they added.

The federal government could raise
$1.7 trillion of revenue by tapping
more oil and natural gas off the US
coast, they added.
“Our country needs to remain on
the path to American energy independence, and we believe this is a
critical and achievable goal. Energy
exploration means more jobs and
stronger national security; nothing
less is at stake,” the House Republicans said. Salazar announced on Feb.
10 that he was extending the public
comment period on a new 5-year
OCS plan by 180 days beyond its current Mar. 23 deadline. He also plans
to have the US Minerals Management
Service and US Geological Survey
prepare a report on conventional and
renewable offshore resources within
45 days as an early step in developing
a comprehensive strategy.

Online support

On Feb. 3, the Institute for Energy
Research began to collect comments
supporting the MMS’s new 5-year
OCS plan online. It noted that the
plan, which contains 31 lease sales in
12 offshore planning areas, would be
the first time in more than 25 years

will create hundreds of thousands of
jobs over the next few years, manufacturing wind turbines and solar cells for
example, and millions more after that.
These jobs and these investments will
double our capacity to generate renewable electricity over the next few years.”
He said his economic plan would
fund construction of a better, smarter
national electrical grid and train workers to build it, and “lead a revolution
in energy efficiency,” which would
modernize more than 75% of federal
buildings and improve more than 2
million homes’ energy efficiency.
“In fact, as part of this effort, today
I’ve signed a presidential memorandum

this will conserve tremendous amounts

to increase capacity, in roads to reduce
congestion and in technologies, which
will accelerate development of plug-in
hybrid vehicles and other innovations
would be “a significant down payment
on a cleaner and more independent
energy future,” he added.
Critics have ridiculed the idea that
part of the economic stimulus should
be used to modernize the entire federal
motor vehicle fleet to take advantage of
state-of-the-art fuel efficiency, Obama
continued. “They call it pork. You know
the truth. It will not only save the government significant money over time, it
will not only create jobs manufacturing
these vehicles [but] it will set a standard
for private industry to match,” he said.

that’s acceptable to me and it’s certainly
not acceptable to the American people.
Not on energy, not on the economy, and
not at this critical moment,” Obama
maintained.
He called on all members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, to
rise to the moment. “No plan is perfect,
and there have been constructive changes made to this one over the last month.
There may be more today. But the scale
and scope of this plan is right. It’s what
America needs, and we need to move
forward today,” he said.

Congressional Republicans remained
skeptical as the Senate debated the
bill on Feb. 5. Minority Leader Mitch
McConnell (Ky.) said, “Apparently, the
authors of this bill just couldn’t resist
inserting scores of long-cherished pet
projects. That’s how you end up with
$70 million for climate research, tens of
millions to spruce up government office
buildings here in Washington, and $20
million for the removal of fish passage
barriers in a stimulus package that was
supposed to be timely, targeted, and
temporary.”

US House Republican Conference
Chairman Mike Pence (Ind.) said, as
debate continued in the Senate: “While
some say the problems with the socalled stimulus bill amount to less than
1% of the bill, the American people
know this legislation goes 100% in the
wrong direction.”
Pence said, “Democrats in Congress
are exploiting a national economic
crisis to fund a wish list of tired, liberal
spending priorities that have little to do
with creating jobs. We cannot borrow
and spend our way back to a growing
economy.” ✦

Salazar scraps predecessor’s 5-year OCS plan
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Calling it “a headlong rush of the
worst kind,” US Interior Secretary Ken
Salazar said on Feb. 10 that he was delaying a 5-year Outer Continental Shelf
leasing plan, which his predecessor
launched last summer.
“To establish an orderly process that
allows us to make wise decisions based
on sound information, we need to set
aside the Bush administration’s midnight timetable for its OCS drilling plan
and create our own timeline,” he told
reporters at DOI headquarters.
He said he would add 180 days to
the public comment period on the
plan, which the US Minerals Management Service’s OCS Planning Committee approved on Dec. 10, 2008, so
coastal states and communities would
have more time to study it. The original
deadline was Mar. 23.
Salazar also said he was ordering the
US Geological Survey and US Minerals
Management Service to prepare an evaluation of US offshore conventional and
alternative resource potential within 45
days. Based on that report, he said that
DOI would then determine which areas
need more information and would create a plan to gather it.
The secretary said it would hold four

that includes renewable and alternative
energy technologies, he added.
That would differ from the Bush
administration, which he said was so
intent on opening new offshore oil and
gas areas “that it torpedoed offshore
renewable energy efforts.”
Salazar said that the 2005 Energy
Policy Act contained a provision that
required DOI to issue rules and regulations within 90 days of its enactment
on Aug. 8 of that year to guide development of wind, wave, and tidal power
resources offshore.
“Yet it took 3 years for the Bush administration to prepare a proposed rule
for offshore renewable energy develop-

ment. They left office without putting
any final regulations because it was
not their priority, notwithstanding the
requirement of the law. For them, it was
oil and gas or nothing,” he said.

Opportunity
Salazar said that he will take a different approach. “Offshore renewable
energy creates a tremendous opportunity for the United States to become a
technology leader. I intend to issue a
final rulemaking in the coming months
so that potential developers know the
rules of the road,” he said.
Identifying new OCS areas where oil
and gas can be responsibly developed
will take longer, he said. “In the biggest area that the Bush administration’s
draft OCS plan proposes for oil and gas
drilling—the Atlantic seaboard from
Maine to Florida—our data on available resources is very thin, and what
little we have is 20-30 years old. We
shouldn’t make a decision to sell off
taxpayer resources based on old information,” Salazar said.

He said USGS and MMS in their
initial report would assemble all the information DOI has on offshore resources, both conventional and renewable,
along with the potential impacts of
their development. The study’s primary
purpose will be to identify areas where
more information is needed and to start
gathering it, he continued. “We need a
definition of what we don’t know,” he
said.
The examination is not likely to
impact OCS lease sales off Alaska and
Virginia, which are part of the current
5-year plan running through 2012,
he emphasized, adding that the study
could produce information that affects
how they are conducted.
“The oil and gas industry should
not see the Obama administration as its
enemy. It should recognize that we intend to take a comprehensive approach
to energy. The previous administration
dragged its feet on renewable offshore
energy resources after Congress passed
the Energy Policy Act in 2005. We plan
to correct this,” Salazar said. ✦

Noting that 97% of the US transportation sector relies on oil, Hatch said
that many federal lawmakers are trying

“Frankly, I’m astounded at the timing of this decision,” said Bishop. “At
the very time our nation is debating
legislation to create jobs and shore up
our economy, the Department of the
Interior is taking steps to kill jobs and
economic development in my home
state. This sale would have expanded
employment and stimulated the
economy of Utah. Secretary Salazar’s
decision today has robbed taxpayers of
millions of dollars of royalties and tax
payments.”
Chaffetz said he had been cautious
in his initial assessments of Obama and
Salazar because he hoped they would
both recognize the Intermountain
West’s important role in supplying
domestic energy. “Today’s action, by executive fiat, is a cruel kick to an already
downtrodden economy. It deprives Utah
and the US treasury of needed income
during a time of severe economic recession, and it deprives the rural parts of
my state of the best paying and most
stable jobs out there,” he indicated.
“It also deprives all Americans
of valuable American-made energy
resources. It’s hard not to be cynical
when the Democratic administration,
drunk with its new-found power, makes
such irresponsible decisions,” Chaffetz
added.

On a key committee
Bishop and Chaffetz are both
members of the House Natural Resources Committee and are likely to
press Salazar on his decision when the
secretary appears before the committee
in another few weeks to discuss DOI’s
proposed fiscal 2010 budget. They also
are part of the congressional Western
Caucus, a 40-member group established
in 1992 which advocates responsible
energy and economic development in
the West and throughout the country.
Other members of that group also
criticized Salazar’s action. “Congress

he oil and gas industry has no
doubt why Chinese President Hu
Jintao visited Saudi Arabia last week.
But his presence in four small African
countries—Senegal, Mali, Mauritius,
and Tanzania—was another matter.
Hu’s visit to the four African
countries supposedly had little, if
anything, to do with his country’s interests in oil or gas or, for that matter,
any commodity.
“Perhaps everybody thinks that
on President Hu’s visit to Africa he’ll
sign this or that deal or contact about
energy or mining,” Assistant Foreign
Minister Zhai Jun told a news conference.
“Of the five countries on the
itinerary for Hu’s trip this time, apart
from Saudi Arabia, the four African
nations are not rich in energy or
resources,” he said. Huh? That doesn’t
jibe with Western reports.

Zeus speaks
“From Senegal around the Cape of
Good Hope to Tanzania, investors are
developing reserves to supply power
producers in need of cheaper fuel as
well as international LNG and chemical markets suffering from supply
shortages,” said Bob Nimocks, chief
executive officer of Zeus Development Corp., Houston.
Senegal? Houston-based Fortesa
International is aiming to discover oil
and more condensate, targeting the
Albian, Aptian, and Turonian formations in and beyond its gas producing
Gadiaga block.
Mali? Eni SPA last month said
it plans to commence a five-well
drilling campaign in Mali’s Taoudeni
basin in the second quarter.
Mauritius? While no oil or gas has

yet been produced on or offshore
the tiny island nation, it is a regional
hub for the industry as evidenced by
the number of firms registered there:
Ind-Oil Overseas Ltd., Libya Oil
Holdings Ltd., Sohi Oil & Gas, and
Swiss Oil.

Location, location, location
The operative word in Mauritius
is: Location, location, location. That is
especially true for the Chinese. After
all, Mauritius is close to Madagascar
where several Chinese oil firms already are at work (OGJ, Feb. 2, 2009,
p. 34).
That proximity to Madagascar is
key, according to Ken Poonoosamy,
senior manager at Mauritius’ board
of investment: “A lot of the Chinese
operators who would want to go to
Madagascar…would prefer to have
their administrative offices” in the
Shanxi Tianli Enterprises business
park, a $730 investment project
funded by the Chinese government.
Tanzania? Well, just ahead of
Hu’s visit allegations emerged that
Tanzania Petroleum Development
Corp. offered the China’s Sonangol
International rights for exploration
in western Tanzania “outside” the
normal tendering process.
In return, local media reported,
the Chinese injected $21 million
dollars into Air Tanzania Corp., which
was used to help purchase two used
Bombardier 70-seater Dash 8 Q400
turboprop aircraft from Bombardier
Aerospace Inc. of Canada.
Believe it or not, Hu, the oil and
gas industry really does operate in
those four “resource-poor” African
countries you visited. ✦

development and increase our domestic
oil supplies in an environmentally safe
manner. Closing access to domestic
energy hurts our economy, deprives
our nation of revenues and places our
long-term energy security in jeopardy.
It is disappointing that Secretary Salazar,
who is from the West, has decided to
side with East Coast environmental interests,” said Rep. Dean Heller (R-Nev.),
the caucus’s policy chairman.

“Taking more land out of production
puts us further at the mercy of nations
hostile to the United States. It also is a
body blow to American consumers just
when our country needs to create more
jobs. It is odd that the Obama administration would talk about stimulating
jobs on one hand and make life more
difficult for consumers and working

families on the other,” said Rep. Doug
Lamborn (R-Colo.).
“The Obama administration is now
attacking Americans,” asserted Rep.
John Shadegg (R-Ariz.). “Simply put,
Secretary Salazar’s action today will cost
Americans jobs. America has energy
resources which need to be developed
and it is insane to outsource these jobs
to energy industry workers in Saudi
Arabia, Russia and Venezuela.” ✦

Sufficient recoverable oil has been
discovered in Uganda’s Albert basin to
exceed the commercial threshold for
development, said Heritage Oil Corp.,
Calgary. The advance came with a discovery at Giraffe, structurally connected
to the Buffalo discovery announced in
December 2008.
The Buffalo-Giraffe complex is
mapped at 18.5 sq miles with more
than 400 million bbl recoverable. If it extends farther north
and east and includes the Buffalo East prospect, the structure could cover nearly 35 sq
miles, Heritage said.
The Giraffe discovery on
Block 1 went to TD 705 m and
cut a gross oil-bearing interval of 89 m
with 38 m of net oil pay.
“Downhole pressure testing and
sampling have confirmed the presence
of movable oil that was recovered to
surface and log interpretation indicates
excellent reservoir quality with porosities of up to 30%,” Heritage said.
The combined Buffalo-Giraffe complex has an oil column of 140 m.
Block 1 contains numerous other
prospects and leads mapped from more
than 600 line-km of seismic data shot

in the past 18 months, and the block
could hold “additional substantial
quantities of oil,” Heritage said. “All
these prospects and leads are characterized by similarly encouraging seismic
amplitude anomalies as those seen over
the successful Warthog, Buffalo, and
Giraffe discoveries.”
Heritage suspended Giraffe as a
future production well and plans more
drilling on Block 1 this year.
Heritage is operator of blocks 3A and
1 with 50% equity interest, and Tullow
Oil PLC has the other 50%.
Eventual plans call for developing a
pipeline to export crude oil through the
port of Mombasa, Kenya, on the Indian
Ocean.
Tony Buckingham, Heritage chief
executive officer, said, “The large
Buffalo-Giraffe structure is a world-class
discovery which could prove to be substantially more extensive than currently
outlined, unlocking the multibillion
barrel potential of Block 1.”
Heritage, which was awarded the
first license in the Albert basin in 1997,
plans to enter the development phase of
the project in 2009 while continuing
to appraise its discoveries and further
explore its acreage. ✦

Operators report string of Gulf of Mexico discoveries
Operators in the Gulf of Mexico
reported a string of discoveries in late
January and early February 2009.
The discoveries took place on prospects in the Lower Tertiary and Middle
Miocene trends, in deep water, and on a
deep prospect on the gulf shelf.

Bob Daniels, Anadarko senior vice-president, worldwide exploration.
Anadarko operates Shenandoah
with a 30% working interest. Partners
include ConocoPhillips 40%, private
Cobalt International Energy LP 20%,
and Marathon Oil Corp. 10%.

Keathley Buckskin

Green Canyon Heidelberg

A group led by operator Repsol YPF
SA found more than 300 ft of net pay
in Lower Tertiary at the Buckskin No. 1
well 190 miles southeast of Houston in
Keathley Canyon Block 872.
Chevron Corp., a 55% interest
holder, said Buckskin is 44 miles west
of its 2004 Jack discovery, also a Lower
Tertiary discovery. Buckskin went to TD
29,404 ft in 6,920 ft of water.
More study is under way on data
gathered from the well, and further
work is needed to determine the extent
and commercial viability of the discovery, the company said.
Repsol YPF SA, with a 12.5% working interest in the prospect, operated
the Buckskin discovery well, but Chevron will become operator and conduct
all future work. Other Buckskin coowners are Maersk Oil America 20% and
Samson Offshore Co. 12.5%.

Another group led by Anadarko
gauged Anadarko’s seventh discovery
since 2005 in the Middle Miocene
Trend.
The Heidelberg prospect in 5,000
ft of water in Green Canyon Block 859
cut more than 200 ft of net oil pay in
several high-quality Miocene sands. TD
is 28,500 ft.
Heidelberg encountered the sameage sands and reservoir characteristics
similar to the Caesar-Tonga discoveries
7-14 miles north, and each of the seven
discoveries targeted a resource of more
than 100 million bbl, Anadarko said.
Heidelberg is 18 miles southeast of
Anadarko’s 100% owned Constitution
spar, allowing multiple development
options after further appraisal, which
Anadarko plans to conduct in the second half of 2009.
Anadarko operates GC859 with
44.25% working interest. Partners in
the discovery include Mariner Energy
Inc. and Eni SPA 12.5% each, StatoilHydro 12%, and ExxonMobil Corp. and
Cobalt International 9.375% each.
Cobalt said Heidelberg is adjacent
to four 100% Cobalt working interest
leases acquired in the March 2008 lease
sale for a combined $127.6 million.
They are blocks 813, 814, 858, and
902. Cobalt, formed in 2005, has a
working interest in 142 gulf leases.
Anadarko’s next prospect is Vito, a
30,500-ft Miocene test in 4,000 ft of
water in Mississippi Canyon Block 984
on trend with the Kodiak and Freedom
discoveries. Anadarko operates Vito with
20% working interest.
Anadarko plans to spud the Samurai

Walker Ridge Shenandoah
Another Lower Tertiary oil discovery
is Shenandoah by Anadarko Petroleum
Corp. and partners in Walker Ridge
Block 52.
The well, which encountered net oil
pay approaching 300 ft in the Wilcox
formation, was drilled in 5,750 ft of
water to a TD of 30,000 ft.
Anadarko and its partners are evaluating the well’s results and assessing
the next steps toward future appraisal
activity.
“Initial data indicates the Shenandoah discovery has reservoir properties
that appear to be of much higher quality than industry has seen previously in
the emerging Lower Tertiary play,” said

Middle and Lower Miocene prospect
in Green Canyon Block 432 in the first
quarter of 2009. Anadarko is operator
with 33.33% working interest.

Garden Banks Bushwood
Mariner Energy is operator of the
Bushwood and Smoothie discoveries.
Bushwood-1, formerly Geauxpher-3, is a conventional deepwater
amplitude prospect. Drilled to a TD of
nearly 25,300 ft in 2,700 ft of water
in Garden Banks Block 463, it logged
more than 260 ft true vertical thickness
(TVT) of net gas pay in multiple sands,
with more than 150 ft TVT of net gas
pay found in the deeper exploratory
section.
Mariner is operator with 30%
working interest. Partners are Energy
Resource Technology GoM Inc., a subsidiary of Helix Energy Solutions Group
Inc., 35%, Apache Corp. 20%, Deep
Gulf Energy II LLC 10%, and Deep Gulf
Energy LP 5%.
Mariner’s 100% owned Smoothie-2,
a deep shelf prospect in 60 ft of water
in South Timbalier Block 49, went to
TD of more than 20,100 ft and logged
more than 200 ft TVT of net gas pay in
multiple zones.

Friesian conﬁrmed
Plains Exploration & Production Co.,
Houston, confirmed the Friesian deepwater discovery and plans to deepen
the well to 32,500 ft to test sands that
flowed at high rates at the giant Tahiti
structure two blocks west.
Shell Offshore Inc. cut more than 120
ft of net oil pay at the Friesian-1 discovery well in Green Canyon Block 599 in
November 2006. TD is 29,414 ft.
The Plains-operated Friesian-2 confirmation well in Block 643 at 3,300 ft
south of the discovery well is at 28,989
ft and cut 389 net ft of oil-saturated
Miocene sands. It encountered 219 net

• Restrictions for disclosing crude
classifications other than proved reserves.

Yearend pricing
The update removes the yearend
price. Instead, companies will need to
determine economically producing
reserves with a 12-month average price
based on each month’s closing prices
on the first day of each month or prices
defined in existing contracts.
For instance, a recent ConocoPhillip news release said that based on the
Dec. 31, 2008, prices, it expects to have
to remove reserves from the proved
category associated with investments
that remain an important part of the
company’s upstream portfolio.
On the other hand, if the 12-monthaverage pricing were already in effect,
without considering other changes
in the new SEC rules, ConocoPhillips
would expect to have minimal reserves
changes.
SEC notes that its “objective of
reserves estimation is to provide the
public with comparable information
about volumes, not fair value, of a
company’s reserves available to enable
investors to compare the business pros38

pects of different companies. The use
of a 12-month average historical price
to determine the economic producibility of reserves quantities increases
comparability between companies’
oil and gas reserve disclosures, while
mitigating any additional variability that
a single-day price may have on reserve
estimates.”
SEC revised both its disclosure rules
and its full-cost accounting rules related
to oil and gas reserves to use a single
price based on a 12-month average. It
also will coordinate the changes with
the staff of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and will
consider delay of the compliance date if
necessary.

converted into oil or gas, such as when
these resources are converted directly
into electricity.
Because of their higher production
costs and greater sensitivity to economic conditions, SEC will require companies to list these nontraditional reserves
separately from conventional oil and gas
reserves, as shown in Fig. 2.
SEC also revised its definition of oil
and gas producing activities to include
processing or upgrading of natural resources from which synthetic oil or gas
can be extracted. It, however, excluded
from the definition:
• Transporting, refining, processing
(other than field processing of gas to
extract liquid hydrocarbons and the upgrading of natural resources extracted
other than oil or gas into synthetic oil
or gas) or marketing oil and gas.
• Production of natural resources
other than oil, gas, or natural resources
from which synthetic oil and gas can be
extracted.
• Production of geothermal steam.

Technology

SEC’s new rules allow companies to
use new reliable technologies for establishing reasonable certainty of proved
reserves. The definition of proved oil
and gas reserves also includes provisions for establishing levels of lowest known hydrocarbons and highest
known oil through reliable technology
other than well penetrations.
SEC says it recognizes that “technologies have developed and will continue
to develop, improving the quality of
information that can be obtained from

of that technology or combination of
technologies.
The new rules require companies
to disclose in a concise summary the
technologies used to create the reserves
estimate, although they will not require
companies from disclosing proprietary
technologies at a level that would cause
competitive harm.

Reserve classiﬁcation
The new rules define proved developed oil and gas reserves as those that
can be recovered through existing wells
with existing equipment and operating
methods or that can be recovered in
other ways through extraction technology installed and operational at the
time of the reserves estimate.
The final rule also allows reserves to
be classified as developed if the cost of
any required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well.
For undeveloped oil and gas reserves,
the new rules will permit companies to
claim proved reserves beyond spacing
areas immediate adjacent to developed
areas if the company establishes with
reasonable certainty that these reserves
are producible economically.
SEC adopted the definition of “reasonable certainty” that permits use of
both deterministic methods and probabilistic methods for estimating reserves.
The new rules also allow companies to include in proved undeveloped
reserves quantities that can be recovered
through improved recovery projects.
The new rules contain the option
for companies to disclose probable and
possible reserves.
The final rules define the term
reserves “as the estimated remaining
quantities of oil and gas and related
substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by
application of development projects
to known accumulations. In addition,
there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist,
the legal right to produce or a revenue
interest in the production of oil and
gas, installed means of delivering oil
and gas or related substances to market,

and all permits and financing required
to implement the project.”
SEC also notes that companies should
not assign reserves “to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially
sealing, faults until those reservoirs are
penetrated and evaluated as economically producible and that reserves should
not be assigned to areas that are clearly
separated from a known accumulation
by a nonproductive reservoir.”
The new rules require companies
to disclose reserves by appropriate
geographic area under a company’s particular circumstances such as individual
country, groups of countries within a
continent; or within a continent.
The final rules require disclosure

of production in each country or field
containing 15% or more of the company’s proved reserves unless prohibited
by the country in which the reserves
are located. The 15% threshold is based
on the company’s total global oil and
gas proved reserves, rather than on individual products.
Also to avoid compelling a company
to provide, in effect, field disclosure,
the rule does not require disclosure
of reserves in a country containing
15% of the company’s reserves if that
country prohibits disclosure of reserves
in a particular field and disclosure of
reserves in that country would have the
effect of disclosing reserves in particular
fields. ✦

Oil price drop unevenly affects ﬂoating production projects

The recent $100 oil

price drop, closure of
financing windows, and
general aversion to investment risk
will affect in the near-term new floater
projects. But as discussed in the latest
International Maritime Associates study,1
the effect likely will be uneven and
short-term.
Assessing the near-term effect of
the current turmoil requires viewing
the market in four subsegments: large
projects, Brazil, marginal projects, and
speculative units. Each has its own
unique outlook.

collapse will not jeopardize the projects’
long-term commercial viability.
Of course, if the price collapse
begins to look likely to continue longterm, then companies could delay or
possibly shelve investments.
But this seems unlikely, judging from
both the oil futures market and many
analysts who believe that the current
price collapse is short-term.

Brazil

The Brazilian market segment is
insulated somewhat from current shortterm conditions. The presalt finds off
Brazil are major new oil sources, and
there are no indications of a slowdown
for exploiting this large resource.
Some analysts question the feasibility of developing the presalt finds in
the current pricing environment. They

these investments. A short-term oil price needs for presalt development. China,
for example, is said to be ready to invest

$10 billion to help develop Brazil’s new
oil fields.
But some slowdown could occur in
developing heavy oil finds in the current pricing environment and possibly
delay new projects such as Royal Dutch
Shell PLC’s Oliva discovery on BS-4.
Also, Brazil may have to loosen local
sourcing requirements that it imposed
to reduce capital expenditures for new
projects. Among other things, this could
jeopardize plans to build FPSO hulls
locally.

Marginal projects
Floater projects involving small
reservoirs and small operators are a different matter. The current situation has
hammered these projects.
A combination of oil prices that are
30-35% of the prices 4 months ago and
an inability to access new capital has
put the brakes on new projects.
Particularly small planned projects
in the North Sea, Southeast Asia-Pacific,
and West Africa are susceptible to current pricing and financing conditions.
Projects such as Huntington and
Kraken in the North Sea, Ande Ande
Lumut off Indonesia, Malampaya off the
Philippines, and Ebok off Nigeria are in
this category.
It is not surprising that tentative
agreements for four floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO)
vessels recently failed to be converted to
firm contracts. These were on marginal

prices will increase in the long-term.
Finding and lifting costs also will
increase with the need to tap more difficult sources of new oil.
Some evidence of this appears in the
futures market. While the spot price at
mid-December 2008 was $40-45/bbl,
the futures market had placed a price of
$74/bbl on crude for delivery 5 years
out and $80/bbl for delivery 9 years
out.
In the long-term, a widely held
consensus is that the world will have a
pressing need to find new oil sources.
Another consensus is that the deepwater
frontier, which requires floating production systems for projects, represents
one of the best opportunities for finding new large sources of oil. ✦

Over the past 2 years,
En*Vantage has been
warning US gas processors that the rapid
expansion of processing
capacity will create a sur- Gas Processing

capacity.
The main concern then and now is
that US gas processors are incurring
more economic risks
by increasing
their leverage to ethane,
unless ethane
demand
increases.
Yet, our analysis indicates that the US
petrochemical industry is not planning
to expand ethylene capacity.
Additionally, existing ethylene plants
are limited in consuming or cracking substantially more ethane because
adequate ethane pipeline capacity to a
number of ethylene facilities is lacking,
and some heavy-feedstock plants need
to be retooled to crack more ethane.
The current economic recession has
only exacerbated ethane oversupply
and has actually caused the shakeout
of some marginal US ethylene capacity. When the economy recovers, these
structural changes in supply and demand for ethane will mute any substantial or prolonged recovery in ethane-

extraction economics.
It will take a great deal of cooperation and planning between the US gas
processing and petrochemical industries to see if ethane demand can be
increased.
To describe ethane’s current and
future market environment in more detail, this discussion is divided into two
parts. The first part this week examines
the fundamentals that drive US ethane
balances, details market forces driving the expansion of US gas processing capacity, and forecasts how these
expansions will increase the capability
of the US processing industry to extract
ethane.
The conclusion (OGJ, Feb. 23, 2009)
examines the changes occurring in
the US ethylene industry, its capability
to absorb additional ethane supplies,
and how this will affect ethane balances and the relative value of ethane
in the future. That article will provide
the strategic implications of ethane’s
future for gas producers, gas processors,
downstream midstream players, and
petrochemical companies.

Background
Ethane can be the most important
NGL for US gas processors and for those
midstream companies that transport,
store, and fractionate NGLs. It constitutes about 40% of the average NGL

that US processing will be able to
extract more than 800,000 b/d for the
next several years (Fig. 4). Actual data
for 2007 showed that US processing
hit a maximum ethane extraction level
of 778,000 b/d, and it appears that in
2008, that level reached 810,000 b/d
before Hurricanes Gustav and Ike hit
the Louisiana and Texas Gulf Coasts,
respectively.
In addition to the new gas processing plants that are coming online,
Trunkline LNG is installing infrastructure at its Lake Charles LNG terminal
to allow for ambient-air vaporization
of LNG and extraction of NGLs from
the LNG. The extraction plant will be
able to process 1.050 bcfd of LNG and
be in service in second-quarter 2009.
The NGLs that are entrained in LNG are
mostly ethane with some propane and
butanes.
Depending on the heat content of the LNG being imported,
18,000-48,000 b/d of ethane could be
extracted. En*Vantage estimates that the
Trunkline LNG terminal could process
LNG with an average heat content of
1,150 (±25)/std. cu ft. That would
imply an NGL recovery rate of at least
39,000 b/d, with ethane extraction
about 24,000 b/d.
One note of caution regarding
Trunkline’s Lake Charles LNG terminal:
There is no certainty that NGLs will be
extracted daily. Extraction will depend
on the need to import LNG, the amount
and quality of the LNG being brought
to the terminal, and whether there is
an economic justification to extract
the ethane. If ethane frac spreads are
any where near levels seen in 2007 or
first-half 2008, it is very likely ethane
extraction will occur. And, because
the volume of ethane extracted at the
Trunkline LNG processing plant can be
quite large, it can have an immediate
capping effect on ethane frac spreads
and cause havoc to ethane balances on
the Gulf Coast.
Even without ethane extraction at
Trunkline, US gas processing is on a
path of overbuilding ethane extraction capability. Unless projects that

have been announced for 2009 are
delayed or canceled by the current
economic recession, En*Vantage expects industry will be able to extract
800,000-850,000 b/d of ethane. The
Trunkline terminal will only add to this
capability, if and when it starts extracting ethane from LNG.
The key questions are whether the
US ethylene industry can absorb this
additional ethane and how will this
impact ethane balances and the relative
value of ethane. The concluding article
in this series analyzes these concerns
and implications for gas producers, gas
processors, and ethylene producers. ✦

Difﬁcult repairs
The highest priority and most difficult repair completed by OPC over the
last few years was fixing the 14-in. OD
LPG pipeline running from just south
of Baghdad to the west of Baghdad and
ending at the Taji LPG bottling plant
north of the city. This pipeline provides
more than 1,000 tonnes/day of LPG
from production and import facilities in the south, crossing some of the
most hostile areas near Baghdad, most
notably the so-called triangle of death
southwest of the city. Working in this
area became very dangerous in 2004,
with security continuing to decline
until 2007.

Bottled LPG is the principal cooking fuel in Iraq and was in critically
short supply in Baghdad 2005-08. Taji
is the largest LPG bottling facility in the
country, filling several thousand bottles
per day. Repairing the 14-in. pipeline
would allow cooking fuel to reach the
people of Baghdad, improving their
quality of life. Cooking fuel became so
scarce in late 2006 that the black market
price rose to about 10 times the official
government price.
During the pipeline outage LPG
trucks loaded at a facility about 1 hour
south of Baghdad in Hilla drove to
Taji, providing less than 25% of typical
supplies. OPC operated like this for

more than 2 years, before linking up
with both US-led coalition forces and
Iraqi Army security teams in a coordinated effort to fix and secure the line.
Late-2007 repairs took about 2 weeks
once security for the teams and the
pipeline was established. Reopening the
pipeline was a victory for OPC and its
security partners in the Iraqi Army and
the coalition’s Energy Fusion Cell.
Repair of the Zekerton Canal crossing close to Kirkuk in northern Iraq
was also difficult. Eight product and
crude oil pipelines crossed the canal in
a bundle design that created an easy and
high-value target. A hit on these lines
in October 2005 created a horrific fire

New downhole ﬂuid measurements
The new InSitu Family of wireline services provides quantitative fluid measurements at reservoir conditions, in real time.
These measurements are acquired with
the InSitu Fluid Analyzer system, which
delivers the next generation of measurements for real-time downhole fluid analysis (DFA).
The InSitu Family portfolio consists of
seven measurement services:
• InSitu Composition hydrocarbon
fluid composition measurement.
• InSitu GOR reservoir fluid gas/oil
ratio measurement.
• InSitu CO2 reservoir fluid CO2 measurement.
• InSitu Density reservoir fluid density
measurement.
• InSitu Color reservoir fluid color
measurement.
• InSitu Fluorescence reservoir fluid
fluorescence measurement.
• InSitu pH reservoir fluid pH measurement.

The company says that quantitative fluid measurements previously unachievable
from wireline technology are now possible
downhole and in real time. By investigating fluids at the reservoir, a deeper insight
to fluid composition and distribution is
gained for improved reservoir understanding, the firm notes.
Operators no longer have to wait for
samples to be returned to the surface for
analysis, the firm says. This real-time information helps operators confirm assumptions on reservoir compartmentalization
and make informed decisions on completion and surface facility design.
Fluid Profiling analysis with InSitu
Family measurements gives further insight
to reservoir fluid distribution and variation. This is made possible with the Quicksilver Probe focused fluid extraction tool
that acquires reservoir fluid with ultralow
or no contamination for InSitu Fluid Analyzer DFA. Characterization of the reservoir
fluid system is extended from a single well
to multiple-well (field-based) applications,

such as quantifying compositional gradients and identifying zonal connectivity.

New corrosion assessment technology
A new technology that measures corrosion is suited for use where crude oil,
oil fractions, and chemicals can affect
pipelines, refineries, and chemical plants.
The novel technology is used to assess the
corrosive properties of fluids on metal and
provides insights that will help to minimize corrosion. Based upon proprietary
Nanoflow technology, the new tool allows
the quantitative analysis of corrosion of
liquids on metals.
The most distinctive feature of the
firm’s corrosion measurement equipment is that it combines the use of a short
residence time of the liquid at elevated
temperatures with a closed loop system.

Economy in peril
no reason to stoop
to politics of fear
The scariest part of the economic crisis
is the US government’s wild resort to the
politics of fear.
“A failure to act, and act now, will turn
crisis into a catastrophe and guarantee a
longer recession, a less robust recovery,
and a more uncertain future,” declared
President Barack Obama on Feb. 4. “Millions more jobs will be lost. More businesses will be shuttered. More dreams will

be deferred.”
He was, of course, pitching his economic
stimulus package, details of which he left to
the House of Representatives to work out.
His message: Congress must pass
something, anything, because something,
anything, is better than nothing.
Is that true?
The House obliged Obama by passing
an $825 billion agglomeration of spending
measures, tax breaks, and political favors,
the economic misdirection of which is
manifest in a “buy America” initiative that
made trading partners discuss retaliation.
When the Senate began work on its
version of “stimulus,” the price tag jumped
to $900 billion. Whether the Senate would
follow the House lead and opportunistically
incorporate health-care reform and other
items of Democratic aspiration was, at this
writing, unclear.
The priority seems to be immediate
commitment to mammoth, miscellaneous
spending, to be elaborated on web sites
dedicated to “transparency” only after the
ﬁscal jeopardy has been rendered inescapable. This is insane. With the government
acting this way, can there be any question
why businesses are expecting the worst
and shedding workers?
Of course the economy needs stimulus.
Of course the government has a role.
Yet it’s painfully clear that the government has no clue about what that role
should be—other than to try to frighten
Americans into believing that it must do
something, anything, right now and not a
day later.
It’s too late to raise the question, but
could inaction be that much worse than a
frantic disgorgement of borrowed billions,
the stimulative effects of which are questionable?
It’s deﬁnitely not too late for Americans
to tell their leaders to quit trying to scare
them into support for ﬁscal recklessness.
Economic peril warrants urgency. But
panic makes serious problems, including
sloppy governance, worse.

Industry in survival mode
A recent survey of 60 producers and service company executives conﬁrmed the
upstream oil and gas industry is in a survival mode, said analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc.
Those executives exhibited “a profound sense of near-term caution with [exploration and production] price expectations well below current strip pricing.” They said,
“The survey suggested that industry insiders are expecting 2009 oil and gas prices
to average roughly 20% lower than Wall Street expectations—the ﬁrst year executives have been more bearish relative to the Street since we have started this survey.
Already, budgets and costs are coming down, and both are likely to continue declining through 2009. Producers are now far more focused on rates of return, especially
in the face of an oversupplied gas market and potential forced production shut-ins
this summer.” Raymond James analysts noted, “While the mergers and acquisitions
market has been hamstrung by the credit crisis, many of the larger E&P companies
with healthy balance sheets and free cash ﬂow potential will have opportunities to
rake in attractive assets at ‘ﬁre sale’ prices.”
Price estimates among the executives averaged $4.84/Mcf for natural gas in 2009,
25% below the Wall Street consensus; and $48.28/bbl for oil, 17% below consensus.
Raymond James’ current forecasts are $5/Mcf and $60/bbl; however, analysts said,
“Our conﬁdence level in a global economic rebound in the back half of this year
remains low.”
Budget cuts
Falling commodity prices triggered major budget cuts in the fourth quarter. Drilling budgets announced by November were tracking more than 20% below 2008
levels. “The realization that additional rounds of capex cuts were coming (more
rigs needed to be laid down) became even more apparent as both the oil and gas
strip prices continued to drift lower—now nearly 20% below November levels,” the
analysts said. Raymond James ofﬁcials reported, “Our updated 2009 E&P capital
spending survey—now with over 60% of our E&P coverage universe having announced their 2009 budgets, comprising about 75% of total spending—points to an
aggregate cutback in the range of 35-40%. For our coverage universe as a whole, we
are currently projecting a 33% spending drop for 2009. A handful of companies are
ramping down spending by as much as 70%.” However, they said, “Even assuming
these large cuts, total spending would still exceed what it was in 2006, when both oil
and gas prices were considerably higher.”
They said, “Unfortunately, we believe that spending plans must fall even further.”
Anecdotal evidence from conversations with industry executives suggested drilling
costs will likely fall 30-40% this year with lower pipe and stimulation prices leading
the largest share of the cost reductions. “If that type of well cost savings actually
plays out, then a 35% reduction in E&P spending would result in only a modest reduction in drilling activity,” the analysts said. Meanwhile, oil and gas executives said
their moves to conserve capital are exacerbated by the nearly frozen capital markets.
“With less access to ﬁnancing, at least at a reasonable cost, companies are instead
looking to shore up their balance sheets or simply return capital to shareholders
through share repurchases (especially at these depressed levels) or dividends,” analysts said. “This ﬁnancial ﬂexibility also creates the opportunity for a few of the free
cash ﬂow-generating independents, along with the even more cash-rich integrated
majors, to rake in assets at deep discounts.”
Several executives indicated that they hope within 18 months to be positioned to
act as “buyer of last resort” of increasingly more distressed sales of assets.
Analysts said, “With budget cuts for the most part already in place, the ‘threshold
of pain’ discussion now revolves around the following question: At what gas price
level do companies shut in production? While it was difﬁcult to draw management
teams into giving an exact ﬁgure, the overarching theme is that the majority of producers anticipate their competitors will have to shut in ﬁrst.”
They said, “Reading between the lines, it was fairly apparent that gas prices
would need to fall to $3/Mcf (or even $2) at some point this summer before the
operators that we spoke with would be willing to shut in production. Furthermore,
active hedging programs may allow some of the larger gas producers to keep rigs
running long after spot pricing would have made a play uneconomic. A ﬁnal theme
that emerged was that a number of E&P companies’ budgets will be determined by
the drilling needed to hold leases acquired during the resource play land grabs over
the past few years.”

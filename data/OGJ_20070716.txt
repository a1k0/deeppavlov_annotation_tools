COVER
An operator operates a valve at Shell Chemical LP’s Deer Park,Tex.,
chemicals manufacturing complex. One of the largest ethylene production plants in the US, the 1.4-million tonne/year Deer Park
facility experienced a major upgrade in 2004.This year’s ethylene
survey showed a very small increase compared to past years.The
increase of only 245,000 tonnes/year of capacity was one of the
lowest addition rates in the past 20 years, according to this week’s
special report, which starts on p. 46. Photo reprinted with permission from Shell Chemicals Ltd.

Texas ofﬁcials order abandoned rig removed
Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson ordered the immediate removal of a derelict jack up, Zeus, that authorities say has long
threatened to topple into the Freeport Ship Channel and spill toxic
sludge.
The emergency order was the first under new authority to remove derelict structures from state waters. State lawmakers also
authorized $2 million to enable immediate rig removal.
Zeus owner Sanship Inc. of Brownsville, Tex., remains liable for
the rig’s removal costs and any cleanup costs. Sanship also could be
subject to fines, penalties, and fees, state officials said.
“We’re getting on this right now—the courts can decide ultimately who foots the bill,” Patterson said. “But the quicker this
work is done, the better.”
Already Zeus has begun leaking an oily mix into coastal waters,
he said. But the greatest threat poised by the abandoned rig is its
potential to collapse into the ship channel.
The US Coast Guard inspected the jack up and determined a
hurricane or tornado could cause its collapse, consequently interrupting Brazosport, Tex., shipping activities. The Texas General
Land Office is working with Port Freeport management, which
will hire a contractor for the jack up removal and cleanup by using
state funding.

Citgo found guilty of environmental charges

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

US Environmental Protection Agency regulations do not require
roofs on waste water equalization tanks and explicitly excluded
such tanks from the requirement, the company said. It voluntarily
began to construct such roofs in 2004 though it was not required
to do so, it added.
“The charges absolutely do not involve any releases or spills
to the environment,” the company said. “Citgo is proud of its environmental record and is confident that the verdict on Counts 4
and 5 will be reversed on appeal. In fact, the waste water system
of which the equalization tanks are a part has never had a permit
violation on oil or grease since the tanks were built in 1994,” the
company said.
DOJ said a federal grand jury on Aug. 9, 2006, indicted Citgo and its environmental manager Philip Vrazel on the four CAA
counts, one felony count of false statements, and five misdemeanor
counts of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which were later severed.
It said the court has not determined whether the government will
be able to go forward on the false statements charge.

Brazil steps up ethanol, renewables production
Brazil’s state-owned Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) has identified $700 million in investments in biofuels and other renewables
during 2007-11.
Petrobras Chief Executive Jose Sergio Gabrielli de Azevedo said
much of the spending would be for pipelines, while a company
spokeswoman said the firm is planning 3.5 million cu m/year of
ethanol capacity for its pipelines and export vessels.
In February Petrobras signed a memorandum of understanding
with Japan’s Mitsui & Co. and Brazilian Construciones e Comercio
Camargo Correa SA to study the construction of pipelines for exporting ethanol (OGJ Online, Feb. 28, 2007). And in March the
Japan Bank for International Cooperation signed a memorandum
of understanding to provide Petrobras with $8 billion to help it
export the ethanol to Japan (OGJ Online, Mar. 6, 2007).
Brazil is the world’s second-largest ethanol producer after the
US and is the world’s leading exporter of ethanol made from sugar
cane.
Answering environmentalists, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio
Lula da Silva said in a national radio broadcast that his country’s
stepped-up ethanol trade would not destroy rainforests or harm
the Amazon region. Lula said Amazon weather conditions are not
favorable for sugar cane crops and that increased ethanol production would not prompt more jungle clearing.

A federal jury in Corpus Christi, Tex., found Citgo Petroleum
Corp. guilty of two felony criminal violations of the Clean Air Act
but acquitted the Houston refiner-marketer on two other counts,
the US Department of Justice and Citgo said in separate announcements June 27.
Citgo, a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), was
found guilty of operating two large, open-air tanks without proper emissions controls at Citgo Refining & Chemicals Co.’s Corpus
Christi East refinery. DOJ said Citgo used the tanks to separate oil
from water without either a fixed roof, vented to a control device,
or a floating roof. Separators upstream from the tanks never worked
to remove oil from the waste water before oil entered the tanks,
it said.
Citgo learned within months after the two tanks went into operation that the upstream oil-water separators did not work, and it
used vacuum trucks to remove oil from the surface of water in the
tanks for nearly 10 years instead of installing the proper control
equipment to prevent emissions of benzene and other volatile organic compounds, DOJ said.
Citgo noted that it was acquitted of two other counts relating to Gas projects to create regional gas grid in UAE
A regional gas grid is materializing in the Middle East with the
the reporting of benzene in waste water streams during 2001-02
completion of the Dolphin gas project in Qatar and the advanceand said it plans to appeal the guilty verdicts.

The $3.5 billion Dolphin project, which includes a 370-km,
48-in. subsea gas export pipeline connecting Qatar with the UAE,
is fully operational and delivering natural gas from its own production wells to customers in the UAE, said project partner Occidental
Petroleum Corp.
The project enables gas from supergiant North field off Qatar to
be transported to a processing plant in Ras Laffan and then to the

Additional deliveries to customers in Oman are expected to

Initial production from the project is expected to ramp up by
yearend, reaching nearly 2 bcfd.

Pioneer has ﬁfth discovery, adds Tunisia girth
Pioneer Natural Resources Co., Dallas, which declared Tunisia
a core area fairly recently, has notched a fifth discovery and is expanding its acreage position in the North African country.
The company plans to perforate and test Farrah, its fifth find on
the Jenein Nord block in the Ghadames basin, in three intervals
totaling 20 m starting in late August.
It will drill three more exploration wells on the block by the
end of 2007 (see map, OGJ, July 2, 2007, p. 44). It will also acquire another 3D seismic survey adjacent to the five successful
wells. Three exploration wells on adjacent nonoperated blocks are
planned by yearend.
Pioneer’s average net production from Tunisia is expected to rise
to at least 5,400 b/d in 2007 and to more than 10,000 b/d in
2008. Output from Jenein Nord is to start late in the 2007 fourth
quarter.
Meanwhile, Pioneer is acquiring a further 15% interest in the
1.2 million acre Anaguid Block from Anadarko Petroleum Corp.
Pioneer will become operator with 60% interest, half of which is
subject to a back-in right by Tunisia’s state ETAP. ETAP has a 50%
back-in right on Jenein Nord.
Following government approvals, expected in 60-90 days, Pioneer will shoot 3D seismic on Anaguid adjacent to the Jenein Nord

Turkey has started importing natural gas from Shah Deniz gascondensate field in Azerbaijan via the South Caucasus Pipeline
(SCP), said Statoil AS, commercial operator for that project.
Delivery was delayed by technical problems that the Shah Deniz
partners encountered with production from the wells (OGJ Online,
Jan. 23, 2007).
Turkey is importing varied amounts of gas depending on how
much it nominates, a spokesman from BP PLC, technical operator
of Shah Deniz, told OGJ. The field produces 8 million cu m/day of
gas and 25,000 b/d of condensate from three wells. Another well
will be brought on stream later this year, the spokesman said.

in 2008.

Statoil’s Ballena gas well tested off Venezuela
Statoil ASA said it has tested gas at “significant” rates in one of
two intervals in its Ballena well, which it recently completed on
Block 4 of Plataforma Deltana off eastern Venezuela. However, the
company is unsure if the find is commercial.
“Further evaluation of the results will be done in the coming
months, with a decision dependent on the outcome of the last well,
[Orca, in the three-well exploration campaign on the block],”said
Thore E. Kristiansen, Statoil Venezuela’s country president.
The Ballena well is the second well to be completed in the drilling program. Transocean Inc.’s Sovereign Explorer semisubmersible
drilled the well in 350 m of water. No well has been drilled in
deeper water off Venezuela to date, Statoil said.
The Sovereign Explorer is to be moved to the third well location.
The first well completed in exploration campaign on Block 4,
Cocuina-2X, found dry gas in three intervals (OGJ Online, Jan. 8,
2007, Newsletter).
Interest holders in the license are Statoil (operator) 51% and
Total SA 49%. PDVSA Gas has the option to participate with up to
35% ownership when commercial. ✦

For the Shah project, state-run Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. (ADNOC) has invited international oil companies Oxy, ConocoPhillips,
ExxonMobil Corp., and Royal Dutch Shell PLC to submit revised
bids to develop the onshore field’s sour gas reserves. Revised bids
reportedly are to be submitted by the end of August.
The initial tender in April called for plans to develop gas reserves
in Shah and Bab fields at an estimated cost of $10 billion. After it
failed to attract enough international interest due to the complexity
of developing both fields together, ADNOC split the project.
A decision for bids for Bab field development has been delayed
for several months.
Other companies that bid for the Shah development but were
not selected to continue in the competition are BP PLC, Total SA, Japan Oil Development Co., and BASF subsidiary Wintershall AG. ✦

The SCP system transports gas from Shah Deniz field in the
Azerbaijan sector of the Caspian Sea, through Georgia, and on to
the Georgia-Turkey border. Following its commissioning, the pipeline was successfully tied-in with the Turkish pipeline system at
the Georgia-Turkey border. Turkish gas firm Botas is responsible for
transporting gas from the Turkish border through a new pipeline
to the city of Erzurum.
BP expects to produce an average of 63,000 boe/d in 2007
from Shah Deniz. Plateau production from Stage 1 will be 8.6 billion cu m/year and approximately 30,000 b/d of condensate.
Gas output is expected to reach 12 billion cu m/year by 2012

told OGJ in London.
The first refinery, with a planned capacity of 70,000 b/d, is being built in Deir ez-Zor in eastern Syria in partnership with China
National Petroleum Corp. The facility is expected to come on stream
within the next 3 years. Investment is pegged at $1.2 billion.
Syria has signed a memorandum of understanding with Noor
Financial Investment Co. from Kuwait for a second 70,000 b/d
refinery in Deir ez-Zor, which also will cost $1.2 billion. It will be
the first refinery in Syria to be developed and partly owned by private investors. Noor also plans to establish 50 retail outlets in Syria
at an estimated cost of $100 million under its brand name.
Syria, Iran, and Venezuela also have agreed to build a 140,000
b/d refinery in the Homs, Syria, area, Al Alao said.
Syria is producing 400,000 b/d of oil, 50% of which is light
oil and the other 50%, heavy oil. Gas production is 8-9 billion
cu m/year. Omar Al Hamad, general manager of Syrian Petroleum
Co., said SPC is trying to stem the fall in production by increasing
recovery from fields it manages. “We have more than 13 contracts
with companies, and we hope to get good results from these,” he
said. “We are compensating with gas,” he added. SPC has called for
bids by July 12 on seven onshore blocks covering 40,000 sq km.
About 24 companies have expressed interest in the acreage.

Coffeyville Resources LLC in Coffeyville, Kan., estimates that
1,700 bbl of crude oil and a small amount of oil from the refinery’s
sewer system were swept away by Verdigris River flood waters.
During June 30-July 1, heavy rains caused the Verdigris River to
overflow its banks and protective levees, flooding Coffeyville. The
river crested more than 10 ft above flood stage, setting a record
for the river. About 2,000 citizens and more than 200 homes were
affected.
The 100,000 b/cd refinery, under 4-6 ft of water on July 3, was
shut down and evacuated. Workers were able to return to some administrative offices and warehouses on July 4 (OGJ, July 9, 2007,
Newsletter).
Refinery management entered into an Administrative Order on
Consent with the US Environmental Protection Agency to respond
to the spill. The order describes Coffeyville’s commitment to conduct a timely cleanup of oil-impacted areas.
EPA conducted monitoring for volatile organic compounds in
flood waters in Coffeyville and downstream, but has not indicated
the presence of these compounds at a “level of concern,” refinery
officials said.

TransCanada to expand Keystone oil pipeline
TransCanada Corp. has secured 155,000 b/d of additional longterm, firm capacity contracts on its planned 1,845-mile Keystone
oil pipeline, enabling a 294-mile extension to Cushing, Okla., and
facilitating plans to move forward with a further extension to the
US Gulf Coast. The $1.7 billion (Can.) Keystone project will deliver
oil from Alberta’s growing oil sands regions to the US.
When the mainline enters service in late 2009, it will have
an initial nominal capacity to transport 435,000 b/d of oil from
Hardisty, Alta., to the US Midwest at Wood River and Patoka, Ill. The
$445 million (Can.) expansion to Cushing includes construction
of the lateral from the Nebraska-Kansas border to Cushing and installation of additional pump stations. Provided that all regulatory
approvals are received, lateral construction could begin in early
2008 and operations start-up, in late 2010.
With the acquisition of the long-term contracts, which total
495,000 b/d, capacity of the system will be expanded to 590,000
b/d.
TransCanada received approval in February from Canada’s National Energy Board to transfer a portion of its Canadian mainline
gas transmission facilities to the Keystone pipeline subject to the
approval of a facilities application to construct and operate Keystone’s $664 million (Can.) Canadian facilities, which will consist
of 371-km of oil pipeline, terminal facilities at Hardisty, Alta., and
pump stations.

Khristenko said construction of the Chinese spur from Skovorodino would start after the completion of the project design work.
Under the contract, the design work should end 208 days after the
first payment from China, which was received in June.
With regard to the project’s Phase 2, which will extend from
Skovorodino to Russia’s Pacific coast, Khristenko said 2007 would
be “important” as a “significant number of auctions for new sections will be held this year.”
Khristenko made the statements in Beijing where he is taking
part in a meeting of the Russian-Chinese subcommittee on energy
cooperation.

Holly, Sinclair to build Utah products pipeline
Holly Corp. and Sinclair Transportation Co. plan to jointly build

Vegas.
The 430-mile, 12-in. line will cost about $300 million and have
an initial capacity of 62,000 b/d, expandable to 120,000 b/d. It
will serve refineries and shippers along its route and interconnect

Oil in Arizona
In the article entitled “Ridgeway to
delineate CO2 field, eyes Permian EOR”
(OGJ, May 28, 2007, p. 41), the statement was made that none of the 26
wells has encountered oil or natural gas,
which is incorrect.
After the first round of delineation wells, the cores from the wells
in Arizona were sent to the Arizona
Geological Survey in Tucson. Since High
Plains developed and sold the St. Johns
Prospect to Ridgeway, I was interested in
viewing those cores, which I did, and I
noticed an oil-stained dolomite on one
of those cores, which both Steve Rauzi
(Arizona oil and gas administrator) and
I observed. Therefore, oil was encountered in at least one of the wells that has
been drilled to delineate the St. Johns
discovery.
From a historical perspective, Ridgeway Arizona Oil Corp. was formed
because oil and combustible gas were
expected, based on the Tenneco and Mae
Belcher wells, which both encountered
oil in the Supai. Furthermore, the CO2
and helium accumulation on the St.
Johns anticline may be a gas cap with an
oil rim. In any case, oil is present on the
structure. Whether oil is present in commercial quantities remains to be seen.
Since the Supai dolomites have such
high porosity, from 16% to 31% in the
discovery well on the St. Johns anticline,
the presence of oil in such a dolomite is
important, not just as an “oil show” but
as an oil show in a zone with excellent
reservoir quality.

First of three parts

A dozen antitrust facts
Energy initiatives of the 110th Congress should
alarm learned observers of the oil and gas industry. Proceeding from false assumptions, peevish
impulses, and historical disregard, lawmakers soon
may enact a series of mistakes certain to damage US interests and hurt consumers. But learned
observers are beginning to speak out.
Two former officials of the US Federal Trade
Commission, both now affiliated with the Washington, DC, office of the O’Melveny & Myers LLP
law firm, have written a monograph addressing
antitrust misconceptions that seem to be guiding
Congress. Their work, “A Dozen Facts You Should
Know about Antitrust and the Oil Industry,” deserves wide attention.
One of the authors is Timothy J. Muris, chairman of the FTC during 2001-04. He’s now a
professor at the George Mason University School
of Law and of counsel to O’Melveny & Myers.
The other author is Richard G. Parker, a partner in
the law firm who served as director of the FTC’s
Bureau of Competition in 1999-2001 and senior
deputy director in 1998-99.
Muris and Parker are cochairs of the antitrust
and competition practice at O’Melveny & Myers.
They speak with authority and from the perspective of service to administrations from both major
political parties. This space will summarize the
facts they discuss in their monograph, four this
week and four each July 23 and Aug. 6.
• Fact 1: Economic learning and antitrust enforcement have
evolved; we now know that big is no longer necessarily bad.
The prevalent notion of the 1970s that “big is
bad” has given way to modern antitrust analysis,
which combines sophisticated economic theory
with careful analysis of complex factual issues that
arise in individual investigations. Modern analysis
considers, for example, the number and sizes of
firms in an industry, their behavior toward one another, the extent to which new entry or expansion
of existing facilities has occurred or will likely do
so, and whether historical behavior of the industry
has been anticompetitive.
By these and other criteria, the US petroleum
industry is highly competitive. Companies are
small in relation to the industry’s size, and many
competitors populate each level of the business.

Many firms have entered the business, particularly
in refining and retailing. Mergers have lowered
costs and increased innovation.
• Fact 2:The antitrust authorities scrutinize the petroleum
industry more closely than any other.
Since 1973, the FTC has conducted well over
100 investigations examining every facet of the
oil industry. It reviews proposed mergers and has
challenged many of them, leading to divestitures,
court injunctions, abandoned transactions, and
conditions on future conduct. The commission
also has investigated price increases following the
Gulf Coast hurricanes of 2005, Shell’s 2004 decision to close its Bakersfield, Calif., refinery, “zone
pricing” and “red-lining” on the West Coast, and
the 2000 gasoline price spike in the Midwest.
It has found no evidence of collusion or market
manipulation.
The FTC also reviews daily data on retail gasoline and diesel prices for 360 major cities and
wholesale prices for 20 major urban areas. It has
conducted several investigations of pricing anomalies but found no illegal conduct.
• Fact 3:The American petroleum industry is not highly
concentrated.
Oil companies hold very small shares of world
crude oil production and reserves; world concentration in crude oil and gas liquids has fallen
since 1985. Recent mergers have had little effect
on concentration, which remains low domestically
and globally, in exploration and production. A 2006
FTC investigation determined concentration of the
refining industry to be low. In most states, gasoline
retailing is unconcentrated or moderately so. Hypermarkets and independent retailers have entered
the market and become strong competitors.
Concentration is lower in the oil industry than
in many other US industries.
• Fact 4: Refiners have expanded domestic and global capacity significantly.
Although grassroots construction of refineries
has shifted to the Far East and Middle East, refining capacity has expanded at existing facilities in
the US, where it grew by 12% during 1994-2004
while output of light products grew by 16%. More
expansion is expected.

Increasing scrutiny this year of
TNK-BP’s Siberian natural gas assets
and actions subsequently taken follow
unsettling patterns of behavior in the
way the Russian government has been
running its gas business.
The government has reneged on a
number of previously signed business
agreements with various companies and
threatened to halt multibillion-dollar,
internationally sponsored operations after
significant amounts of
time and money had
been invested in those
projects.
Russia’s Natural
Resources Ministry,
claiming that TNK-BP was not producing enough gas from massive Kovykta
gas field in Eastern Siberia, threatened
in late May to revoke the company’s
license to develop the field, which
reportedly has estimated resources of 2
trillion cu m of gas in place (OGJ, June
4, 2007, p. 32). The move would create
the need to rebid the field in a competition that Russia’s state-controlled
natural gas monopoly OAO Gazprom
doubtless would win. Observers saw the
move as part of a continuing move to
return Russia’s oil and gas deposits to
state control.
In late June, TNK-BP (owned and
managed jointly by BP PLC and Alfa
Access Renova Group) announced an
investment alliance with Gazprom for
major long-term energy projects of
at least $3 billion in cost or a swap of
global assets. TNK-BP, the third largest oil company in Russia, agreed to
sell to Gazprom a 50% interest in East
Siberian Gas Co., which is building a
regional gasification project, and to sell
its 62.89% stake in OAO Rusia Petroleum OJSC, the company that holds the
license for Kovykta field.
TNK-BP reportedly may purchase
a 25% plus one share stake in Kovykta
later at an independently verified
market price once specific criteria have
been met, the companies said (OGJ,
July 9, 2007, p. 27).

interest in Kovykta and other indicators
point to the Kremlin’s tightening grip
on the strategic energy sector. These
patterns of behavior indicate a potentially unstable business environment for
international investors. The following
two case studies demonstrate some of
Russia’s other seemingly underhanded
tactics used in dealing with international consortiums in order to achieve its
end goal of obtaining strategic control
over the sector.

The Shtokman story
Shtokman gas field, discovered in
1988 in Russia’s Barents Sea, is believed
to have over 141 tcf of natural gas reserves, making it one of the largest gas
fields in the world (Fig. 1).
In the early 1990s, test results from
a feasibility study formed the basis for
talks that would allow a group of five
Western companies to participate in the
field’s development. In 1992, however,
the foreign consortium was pushed
out by the ZAO Rosshelf consortium, a
Gazprom subsidiary that comprised 19
Russian companies mainly engaged in
defense production.
According to Yevgenny Velikhov,
vice-president of the Russian Academy
of Sciences and chairman of Rosshelf, the consortium would provide
greater employment in Russia. This
was viewed as a key factor in Rosshelf’s
victory over the Western consortium.
According to then-Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, although the country’s
industrial policy favored Russian
companies and groups, the consortium
was encouraged to work with foreign
companies and consultancies for their
technical capabilities.
However, Russia was neither technologically nor financially prepared
to take on such a project solo, and in
August 1995 Gazprom and Rosshelf
signed a letter of intent with Norsk
Hydro of Norway, Conoco of the US,
Neste Oy of Finland, and Total SA of
France to evaluate the possible joint
development of Shtokman field.
One challenge of the project was trying to figure out the logistics of transOil & Gas Journal / July 16, 2007

porting the gas to its destination. In
January 1996, a St. Petersburg company
designed a $600 million floating liquefaction plant, which offered a potential
solution to the problem.1 LNG would
obviate the need for an underwater
pipeline from Shtokman field through
the Barents Sea.
Plans to build the LNG plant, however, never came to fruition. Instead, in
March 2000, Rosshelf began developing
plans for production and construction
of a natural gas pipeline, rather than
an LNG plant, with potential foreign
partners. These plans included building
a pipeline from the field via Murmansk
to Vyborg on the Baltic, then on to
Peenemunde in Germany. With such an
undertaking the project would require
great financial backing. By May 2000,
Gazprom had still not established the
ownership structure of the $20 billion
Shtokman project.
Russian and Western partners shared
an interest in developing Shtokman
field. The gas was destined to be piped
directly to Europe, satisfying the growing European demand for natural gas.
Russia would benefit by increasing its
business ventures with Europe.
In June 2003, Russia reconsidered
the possibility of adding an LNG component to the Shtokman development
project. This would allow Russia to direct supplies to the US via LNG tankers.
By May 2004, despite the 1995 letter
of intent with Norsk Hydro, Conoco,
Neste, and Total to evaluate the possibility of a joint development project,
Gazprom had not yet made a firm commitment on which firms would actually
participate in the consortium. Gazprom
was in talks with ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, ChevronTexaco (to a lesser
extent), and Royal Dutch Shell.
Because Shtokman was located 342
miles from shore, analysts anticipated
that a number of technical innovations and solutions would be implemented in the effort. This would push
up development costs and make the
gas more expensive. As a result, some
analysts were skeptical of the project’s
feasibility.

On June 20, 2005, Russia and Norway signed a number of agreements
intended to finally pave the way for
development of Shtokman field. France
also signed a memorandum with Russia
8 days later, and in August 2005, Gazprom received bids from nine foreign
companies to develop the field: ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Norsk Hydro,
Statoil, Mitsui, Sumitomo Corp., Shell,
and Total. Gazprom ultimately planned
to retain a 51% stake in the project
and select two foreign companies to
participate.
In September 2005, Gazprom shortlisted five companies—Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Norsk Hydro, Statoil, and
Total. Gazprom planned to announce
the two winners on Apr. 15, 2006. That
announcement never came.
In June 2006, Gazprom began
suggesting that it might not include
US companies in the list of winners.
According to Gazprom Chairman Alexei
Miller, “I can assure you that Gazprom
does not want to establish a pattern
of selecting particular companies just
because they come from a particular
country.”2

WTO leverage?
Analysts speculated that Russia
might use the tender as leverage in its
talks with the US over its entry into
the World Trade Organization (WTO),
which the Kremlin believed was being
held up by Washington. After the Group
of Eight leading economies summit in
St. Petersburg ended in July 2006 with
no breakthroughs made in Russia’s talks
with the US to join the WTO, Gazprom
further pushed back the decision on
who would win the project, while
Russian President Vladimir Putin began
hinting that the Norwegian companies
had a good chance of being selected.3
The one saving grace for the US
was that Russia required access to the
American gas market. Norsk Hydro and
Statoil had allegedly offered stakes in
Norwegian fields and LNG gas export
projects in their bids, while Conoco and
Chevron allegedly offered stakes in US
LNG terminals in their bids.4
Gazprom continued to hold back its
announcement of the winners. Then,
in September 2006, Putin reportedly
told French and German leaders that
Gazprom was considering shipping
some LNG to European markets. While

these comments offered reassurances to
Europe, it upped the stakes in an already
strained relationship with the US, and
analysts began speculating that US companies would be omitted from the list
of winners.
Then, on Oct. 9, 2006, Gazprom
stunned the gas industry by announcing
that it would develop Shtokman alone,
without any foreign partners, and ship
the gas directly to Europe via pipelines
rather than including an LNG component to export to North America. Any
foreign firms wishing to participate in
the project would have to do so as contractors rather than equity stakeholders.
Two months later Gazprom changed
its decision yet again, reexamining the
possibility of developing the project as
an LNG export project. Not coincidentally, after the US and Russia reached a
deal for the US to support Russia’s WTO
membership bid, Gazprom said that
there was still a chance of opening the
door to foreign companies as stakeholders. The final outcome of the project has
yet to be determined as Russia changes
its decisions. However, political undercurrents are apparent, especially when
viewed side-by-side with events unfolding around other major gas fields, such
as the Sakhalin-2 project.

would cut Shell’s stake and give Gazprom a stake of up to 25% in Sakhalin
Energy in exchange for a 50% share of
Gazprom’s Zapolyarnoye gas field in
West Siberia.7 One week after the deal
was announced, Shell reported that
it had made a mistake in its previous
calculation to construct and develop
Sakhalin-2. Shell now increased the
cost estimate by about $10 billion. This
blunder caused Gazprom to pull out of
the deal with Shell.
Russian state ecological experts ruled
in favor of proceeding with construction of the Sakhalin-2 project. However,
in August 2006, the Russian Natural
Resources Ministry dealt a serious blow
to Sakhalin Energy by seeking legal action to cancel the environmental license
that permits construction. The ministry cited a high risk of mudslides that
could cause water pollution, equipment
destruction, or fatalities.8
A report by the Far East branch
of the Russian Academy of Sciences
claimed the “existing threat of oil and
gas pipeline destruction is the result of
unqualified project decisions taken by
Sakhalin Energy.” According to a Sakhalin Energy spokeswoman, however, the
company had not received any previous
notice on the environmental concerns
from the Ministry. She further noted

Problems with Sakhalin-2 were
inherent from its initial stages. For
example, the 1994 PSA law raised a
few issues with Japan. One, of major
concern to Japan, was the possibility of
unilateral contract revamps by Russia
that could include a declaration for the
Russian government to take over fields
“considered of strategic importance.”
This concerned Japan greatly because
Japan viewed Sakhalin gas and oil as
part of its energy security policy.
Japan also was concerned about a
requirement to use Russian technology to build the LNG plant because it
was Russia’s first liquefaction plant, and
the Russians had no experience with
the technology required to complete
the project successfully.5 Despite these
pitfalls, Japan hung on.
On Feb.11, 2000, Sakhalin Energy
Investment Co. Ltd., operator of the
Sakhalin-2 project, began seeking bids
to construct the LNG plant. Consortium
members at this time were Marathon
37.5%, Mitsui 25%, Mitsubishi 12.5%,
and Shell 25%.6 A few months later,
Shell and Marathon signed a nonbinding letter of intent to transfer Marathon’s 37.5% interest in the project to
Shell, which gave Shell a controlling
stake in the project.

during which the Sakhalin-2 pipelines
were nearly 90% complete, and there
were no adverse effects, according to
Sakhalin Energy.11
A few days later, the Natural Resources Ministry ordered Shell to stop work
on the onshore pipelines and rework
the design.12 Then, during the first week
of September 2006, the Ministry dealt
another blow to Sakhalin Energy when
it revoked the approval it had granted

the project to defend its interests. Yuri
Trutnev confirmed the Western assumption when he pointed out that Moscow
had to “defend its interests” only after
Shell last year doubled the project’s
expected costs to $20 billion.14
Because the Sakhalin-2 project cost
suddenly and unexpectedly increased
by $10 billion, the Russian government
saw this as a financial blow. In addition,
under the PSA law, the cost increase

would delay and reduce payments to
the Russian government. Suddenly, the
Russian government felt it was being trampled upon by a consortium
of foreign companies that were given
extremely favorable terms under a PSA
drawn up 12 years earlier.
Russia did not feel it was receiving its due share of financial gain in
a timely manner. According to one
source, as of September 2006, $18
billion had been invested in the three
PSA projects—Sakhalin-1, Sakhalin-2,
and Kharyaga, an oil exploration and
production venture operated by Total
in the northern Timan-Pechora region.
Meanwhile, the state had received
only $500 million in revenue.15 One
account described this amount as
“laughable.”
On Sept. 28, 2006, Oleg Mitvol,
deputy head of Rosprirodnadzor,
Russia’s environmental watchdog, announced that environmental damage
caused by the Sakhalin-2 project would
cost Sakhalin Energy over $50 billion.16
According to Mitvol, “The construction cannot go on. We must stop the
project and start over again. We want
criminal cases for every destroyed tree
or damaged river. If criminal cases are
opened for everything, the company
will read the criminal code, come to its
senses and stop the barbarian activity.”17
Mitvol denied he was taking on Shell
to assist Gazprom in achieving its goal
of gaining a share in the project. “I’m
doing it for my daughter and for the
future of Russia,” he declared.18
Next, Natural Resources Minister
Yuri Trutnev asked Rosprirodnadzor to
submit details of the company’s environmental violations to the prosecutor
general’s office within 2 weeks. The case
could then be brought up to a criminal
level status. According to Trutnev, the
company violated at least five articles of
the Russian criminal code.
While Sakhalin Energy tried to reach
a solution, the project faced another
environmental assault on Dec. 7. The
Ministry suspended permits held by
Starstroi, the main onshore contractor.
This forced Sakhalin Energy to halt all

Shell succumbs
On Dec. 21, 2006, Shell succumbed
to the environmental and judicial
pressure. After Gazprom had waged
war with Shell for over a year to gain
control of the Sakhalin-2 LNG project, it
finally succeeded. Shell’s stake would be
reduced to 27.5%, Mitsui’s to 12.5%,
and Mitsubishi’s to 10%. Gazprom
would now hold 50% plus one share
in the company, making it the majority
share owner and, therefore, bumping
Shell from its position as controlling
shareholder. Although Shell no longer
has control over the project, it reportedly retains management and technical
advisor status. Gazprom offered $7.45
billion in cash in the deal.
In what hardly seems a coincidence,
the environmental issues disappeared
once Gazprom became a shareholder.
Russia swept the ecological shortcomings aside. According to Putin, all
ecological issues can now be considered
resolved. “I’m pleased that our environmental services and the investors have
agreed on the way of resolving ecological problems,” Putin said during a
televised appearance.20
With Gazprom the majority stakeholder in Sakhalin-2, Russian authorities geared up attacks on new fronts.
This time the attacks were on the
TNK-BP’s Kovykta project, in which
Russia threatened to have the company’s
license revoked. Additionally, Russia
threatened to cancel Total’s Kharyaga
project PSA. Finally, environmental
authorities announced plans to “check
up” on ExxonMobil’s Sakhalin-1 project.21
The real issue behind Sakhalin-2 was
cost overruns. The Russian government’s
lack of control over the project further
exacerbated the problem. According
to Andrew Neff, senior energy analyst
with Global Insight, there may have
been environmental violations—but not
to the extent stated by the Russians.
In the long run, having Gazprom
on the project may be better for Shell,

although not ideal as was the original
PSA deal, which is no longer an option.
As of Sept. 6, 2006, the only options
available were either to see the project
stall, have the license revoked and lose
the entire investment, or concede. At
least the project will proceed, albeit less
profitably.22

Strong foothold
Russia has an abundance of natural
gas available and is just starting to come
on board with the ability to develop
and produce these resources. Western
advanced technology, financial strength
and high demand, coupled with Russia’s lack of capital and exceptional reserves seem to make the two countries
ideal partners. The Kremlin, however,
clearly intends to expand and maintain
a strong foothold in its energy sector.
Russia’s reneging on international deals
creates a challenging and dangerous
business environment for potential
Western business partners.
As the number-one consumer of
natural gas in the world and possessing only 3% of world reserves, the
US needs to continue to diversify its
sources of natural gas. The case studies
described above are two examples that
demonstrate the potential hazards of
doing business in Russia. The Russian
government stands firm in its desire to
expand its monopoly on the natural gas
sector and continues chiseling away at
Western-dominated projects within its
borders. In addition to the negative impacts stated in the case studies on those
Western companies currently involved
in these projects, Russia’s growing
monopoly comes with other potential
side effects:
• Increased political leverage. As Russia’s
monopoly on natural gas grows, so too
does its political strength. The Kremlin will undoubtedly be able to use
its tightening grip over natural gas as
political leverage over countries highly
dependent on it for this resource.
• A strengthening of its military. Russia
is using energy as a tool to restore its
world-power status. No longer a military threat, Russia could use the monies

earned from these development projects
to revamp its military.
• Unfair control over pricing. Russia could
opt at any time to increase its prices
for natural gas during times of high
demand. This not only would affect
citizens of other countries but also
could impact local economies or even
global economies if the increases were
substantial.

Future deals
Although Russian technology has
been improving over time, it has yet to
achieve the same capability as that of
the Western majors. Knowing this, Western companies might still find future
deals attractive. These companies need
to be shrewd in their business dealings
with Russia, keeping in mind that at any
time the tide can turn and politics can
play a key role in ousting them from
part or all of a project. This could result
in billions of dollars in lost revenues.
Russia still has many unexplored gas
fields. Any Western company willing to
participate in exploration of these fields
should heed three warnings:
• First, companies must understand
the differences between “Western capital laws” and “Kremlin socialist laws.”
At any time, like Shell, they could be
forced into a costly compromise.
• Second, Western companies must
be prepared for Russia to take advantage of capital and technology, some
of which might even be proprietary,
before Russia assumes the upper hand
in a project.
• Finally, future Western investors
must first be able to balance risk and
reward. The risks are many.
Russia continues striving toward
complete domination of its industry,
which likely will one day exclude
foreign companies altogether. For
now, however, Russia will continue to
include foreign companies as long as it
needs the technology they bring. ✦

IEA: Oil market to stay tight through 2012
The oil market, despite 4 years of
elevated prices, will tighten further by
2012, predicts the International Energy
Agency, Paris.
Spare production capacity among
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will rise
but remain “relatively constrained”
until 2009 then fall to “minimal levels”
by 2012 as demand growth remains
strong, IEA says in its Medium-Term Oil
Market Report published this month.
Although low spare capacity in OPEC
implies high crude prices, and despite
growing distillation capacity and biofuels supply, IEA expects refining margins
to remain strong through 2012.
Using economic forecasts from the
24

Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) and International Monetary Fund, the agency
assumes growth in global average gross
domestic product of about 4.5%/year.
That assumption yields oil demand
growth of 2.2%/year.
If GDP grows only by 3.2%/year, oil
demand growth slows to 1.7%/year,
and the need for OPEC crude falls by
about 2 million b/d in 2012, IEA says.
“But this merely postpones by a year
the point at which oil demand growth
surpasses the growth in global oil
capacity, in effect delaying the return
of minimal spare capacity by only a
few years unless the trend in upstream
capacity growth changes.”

Forecast highlights
Here are highlights of IEA’s forecast
for 2007-12:
Oil demand will increase to 95.82
million b/d in 2012 from an estimated
86.13 million b/d in 2007. Most of the
growth will be in Asia and the Middle
East, where demand will increase at
nearly three times its rate of the industrialized countries of the OECD. The
rapid-growth countries are approaching the income threshold of about
$3,000/person at which consumers
buy cars and energy-consuming goods,
IEA notes.
Non-OPEC liquids supply will
increase during the forecast period to
52.56 million b/d from 49.98 million

b/d, with the growth rate diminishing
after 2009. Non-OPEC liquids supply
includes crude, condensate, NGL, and
biofuels.
• OPEC’s production of NGL, which
isn’t subject to the group’s production
quotas, grows in the forecast period to
7.08 million b/d from 4.86 million
b/d.
• The need for OPEC crude, which
is subject to quotas, net of anticipated
stock changes and balancing items, rises
to 36.81 million b/d in 2012 from
34.4 million b/d in 2007.
• The calculated need for OPEC
crude implies OPEC spare production
capacity of 2.5 million b/d in 2007
(2.9% of global demand), 3.07 million
b/d in 2008 (3.5%), 3.37 million b/d
in 2009 (3.7%), 3.24 million b/d in
2010 (3.5%), 2.55 million b/d in 2011
(2.7%), and 1.55 million b/d in 2012
(1.6%).
• For OPEC production capacity,
IEA assumes no net expansions in Iran,
Iraq, and Venezuela and a negligible
increase for Indonesia. It also assumes
that 500,000 b/d of Nigerian capacity offline for the past year remains
idle through the forecast period. IEA
forecasts these increases: Saudi Arabia,
1.77 million b/d to 12.57 million b/d

in 2012; the United Arab Emirates,
500,000 b/d to 3.38 million b/d; Angola, 500,000 b/d to 2.17 million b/d;
Kuwait, 420,000 b/d to 3.06 million
b/d; Nigeria, 370,000 b/d to 2.84 million b/d; Qatar, 210,000 b/d to 1.16
million b/d, Algeria, 190,000 b/d to
1.56 million b/d; and Libya, 170,000
b/d to 1.92 million b/d.
• Supply of automotive biofuels
will reach 1.8 million b/d by 2012,
compared with 900,000 b/d in 2006.
The 2012 projection is 1.2 million b/d
below the potential level of capacity additions. IEA cites rising prices of feedstocks, the lack of clear long-term mandates and subsidies in many countries,
and food-fuel competition as reasons
for the conservatism of its outlook.
• Crude distillation capacity will
increase by 10.6 million b/d during the
forecast period, of which 9.1 million
b/d will be new capacity and 1.5 million b/d will be capacity creep resulting
from upgrades of existing units. Expansion of existing refineries, mainly in
Asia-Pacific and the US, will raise global
capacity by 4 million b/d. New-build
refineries will add 5.1 million b/d of
capacity, mainly in the Middle East,
China, and elsewhere in Asia, especially
India. ✦

Survey reveals
energy muddle

A

merican Petroleum Institute officials have said for several years
that the public doesn’t understand
how the oil and gas industry works.
Now they have figures to back up
their statements.
In a May 29-June 3 online survey
of 1,333 Americans, Harris Interactive found that most US adults “have
a fundamental lack of knowledge
regarding energy supplies and demand, and the role of America’s oil
and natural gas companies,” API said.
“In fact, when presented with 20
multiple choice questions, on average
more than 25% of respondents said
they were ‘not sure,’ and in many
cases people chose the response that
is farthest from the correct answer.”
Respondents overestimated US oil
imports from the Middle East. When
asked which country was the biggest
foreign supplier, almost 60% chose
Saudi Arabia, which actually is No.
6. Only one in 10 correctly chose
Canada as the largest foreign supplier.

The survey also indicated that the
public overestimates the size of publicly traded oil companies relative to
competitors owned by foreign governments. When asked what percentage of the world’s largest oil firms are
state-owned, only 2% knew that this
describes all of the top 10 companies.
Most respondents also didn’t
know that ExxonMobil Corp., the
largest US oil company, was not
among the world’s largest reserves
holders. Thirty-six percent placed it
among the world’s three largest oil
firms, API said.

Fossil fuels’ role

Respondents also underestimated
the role fossil fuels must play in meeting global energy demand in the next
25 years. Only 14% agreed with the
International Energy Agency’s estimate that fossil fuels will meet 81%
of demand in 2030. Most respondents
thought it would be 61% or less. Similarly, more of the survey’s participants
(34%) thought that renewable sources

and long lead times,” he said. ✦

He noted that CSB has received the
same annual appropriation for the last
3 fiscal years. CSB Chairwoman Carolyn W. Merritt said the agency, which
has 40 staff members, has a $9 million
budget and has requested $10.5 million
for fiscal 2008. Budget limitations and a
lack of qualified investigators have kept
the agency from examining 10-15 accidents this year, she added.

Information limited
Merritt also indicated that CSB did
not receive all the documents it sought
from the Environmental Protection
Agency and Occupational Safety and
Health Administration while it investigated the March 2005 fire and explosion at BP America Inc.’s Texas City, Tex.,
refinery that killed 15 and injured about
180 people. “It directly impacted our
evaluation,” she said.
Deborah Dietrich, who directs the
emergency management office within
EPA’s solid waste and emergency
response office, countered that EPA
“provided a great amount of information. We did not see how questions
regarding the number of inspections
were relevant.”
Merritt testified, “We made recommendations to OSHA but did not make
one to EPA because we did not have the
information.” In her written statement,
she noted that the National Transportation Safety Board, in a 2002 report,
said that both EPA and OSHA have few
safety inspectors compared with the
number of high-hazard chemical facilities—about 14,000—which federal
regulations cover.

Supplanting EPA
Timothy R. Gablehouse, president of
the National Association of SARA Title 3
Program Officials and chairman of the
local emergency planning committee
in Jefferson County, Colo., suggested
that CSB is supplanting EPA as a major
federal safety agency at oil refineries
and chemical plants “even though EPA
has regulatory ownership of both primary statutory programs that create the
structure of these efforts.”

CSB recommendations in the last
few years have focused on local preparedness, the use of local emergency
planning committees, and enhancing
relationships within communities to
prevent and prepare for accidents, Gablehouse said in his written statement.
“Its adoption of video reconstruction to
communicate the results of investigations also has been extremely beneficial
to those at the local level,” Gablehouse
said.
Scott Berger, who directs the American Institute of Chemical Engineers’
chemical process safety center in New
York, said CSB’s investigations enable
companies, regulators, and workers to
take necessary actions to avoid future
accidents. He urged that CSB be adequately funded and staffed “to carry out
in-depth incident investigations, capture
the learning, and communicate that
information to the industry, technical
associations, regulators, and the public.”
Merritt also urged the committee to

compare CSB’s statutory authority with
that of NTSB, on which it was modeled. “The authority of CSB to preserve
and determine the testing of evidence
is much less explicit than the NTSB’s
authority,” she said. “Last year, when
the CSB proposed a procedural rule on
evidence preservation at accident sites,
some industry voices objected that
Congress had never intended CSB to
exercise such preservation authority.”
She said delayed investigations often
result in important physical evidence
being lost or destroyed. “Clarification of
these issues by Congress would improve
the quality and speed of CSB investigations,” Merritt said in her written
statement.

Other suggestions
Congress must make clear that no
local, state or federal agency may block
CSB access to the site of a chemical
release, particularly during the early
stages when physical evidence is most

pristine and in the greatest peril, Merritt said. She also said it was important
that CSB, EPA, and OSHA field teams
have reasonable access to the other
agencies’ records and employees to conduct investigations.
“Congress could also consider
providing a limited degree of statutory
protection for CSB’s own investigative
records to prevent indiscriminate use
in litigation and criminal prosecutions.
The possible future use of information
gathered by CSB in the courtroom can
have a strong chilling impact on our
ability to conduct our safety investigations and can detract from our independence,” said Merritt, whose 5-year
term as the CSB’s chairwoman ends in
August.
Berger said that AIChE and its chemical process safety center would like to
see experienced chemical engineers
named to replace the chairwoman and a
board member whose terms are expiring. ✦

Biofuels pitfalls need more study, say conferees
Doris Leblond
OGJ Correspondent
Amid the current clamor for biofuels development came cautions from a
number of speakers at the first International Biofuels Conference in Brussels
July 5-6 that biofuels are “no panacea”
and that potential drawbacks need to be
identified and avoided.
Biofuels are being touted by many as
an alternative to fossil fuels for transportation and for combating climate
change, bolstering energy supply security, and benefiting farmers.
However, the European Union’s
External Relations Commissioner Benita
Ferrero-Waldner, who organized the
conference, warned, “We cannot afford
to turn a blind eye to the potential
drawbacks. We need to analyze them
and avoid them.”
Ferrero-Waldner said an analysis
should be carried out at the interna-

tional level because “the benefits and
risks of developing biofuels on a grandscale have to be tackled as part of an
international agenda.”
The consensus among the speakers
was that no country—even the US—
could deal alone with the challenges of
climate change and energy security and
that convergent international standards
for biofuels should be developed in line
with their global trading.
“Biofuel policy is not ultimately
an industrial policy or an agricultural
policy—it is an environmental policy,
driven above all by the greenest outcomes,” said EU Trade Commissioner
Peter Mandelson.
“We do not usually think about the
immense complexity of the infrastructure that supplies our energy,” Mandelson said in an effort to temper what
he called “an environmentally unsustainable stampede” towards biofuels
production. “No industry works with a

longer time horizon: It takes 5 years to
build a pipeline, 10 years for a power
station or refinery. So we must recognize the need for a stable regulatory
framework, and for dependable signals
from governments to guide investment
and trade.”
Promising that the EU’s energy
policy target of a 10% share of biofuels
for transport by 2020—a nearly sevenfold increase—would be “binding,” EU
Energy Commissioner Andris Pielbags
insisted that it also must be “sustainable.” The directive giving legal backing
to the policy will set minimum sustainability standards for both domestically produced and imported biofuels,
he said, adding, “We must aim at the
earliest possible entry into the market
of ‘second generation’ biofuels,” which
are not food-related.
Claude Mandil, executive director of
Paris-based International Energy Agency,
told OGJ that the positive aspect of the

conference, which he cochaired, was
that it showed a “passing from poetry
to serious thinking.”
While biofuels served to diversify
motor fuels, speakers recognized that
biofuels must be produced and consumed in a sustainable manner, taking
care to maintain biodiversity, prevent
adverse impacts on world food prices
and availability, and ensure that its production does not require more energy

than it provides. And he stressed the
need for a consensus on reaching international biofuels standards.
Like other speakers, Mandil did not
view biofuels as “a panacea” pointing
out that, despite an impressive number of projects existing or planned,
biofuels would not in the foreseeable
future account for more than 5-10% of
world transport consumption and will

never replace oil. He further warned:
“Oil-producing countries must not be
worried to the extent of curtailing oil
development.”
Ferrero-Waldner said the initial
conference was only a first step towards
a “transparent and frank dialogue with
all partners” in order to work towards
a credible and sustainable international
market and convergence in biofuels

opment to continue on the site, which is administered by
the Bureau of Land Management’s eastern Utah office in Vernal. However, OSEC must submit a detailed operations plan
for BLM’s approval, and it also will be required to obtain all
necessary federal, state, and local permits and make available
to other companies researching oil shale development some
shale from an existing supply at the site, BLM said.
It said OSEC plans to test an above-ground retorting
process on shale from the White River Mine site south of
Vernal. The company initially will conduct test retorts of
existing shale stock at a facility in Canada to help determine
the retorting process’s feasibility, the chemical properties
of synthetic crude products resulting from it, and whether
spent shale will require isolation from the environment, according to BLM.
The lease has terms similar to five RD&D leases that DOI
issued previously for acreage in western Colorado. It gives
OSEC rights to develop oil shale on the tract for 10 years,
with a possible extension of up to 5 years if the lessee
shows diligent progress toward commercial production.
BLM said that RD&D lessees also may apply to convert
each lease, plus 4,960 adjacent acres, to a 20-year commercial lease once commercial production levels are achieved
and additional requirements are met. The agency said it
would perform subsequent analyses under the National
Environmental Policy Act on any proposed commercial operations on RD&D leases.
Selma Sierra, BLM’s Utah state director, said the RD&D
process benefits from support by the state government and
local governments in Uintah and Duchesne counties. “The
BLM will continue to facilitate communication and collaboration between local communities and companies working
with shale from the White River Mine,” she said.
BLM said that issuing the lease to OSEC completes action
in its oil shale RD&D leasing program, which began in June
2005. The agency said it is continuing to lead development
of a programmatic environmental impact statement supporting future commercial oil shale leasing on public land
in Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming, as directed in the 2005
Energy Policy Act. ✦

racked by the need to boost its
supplies of natural gas, Argentina is putting the screws to producers and certain consumers. Last week,
Argentine President Nestor Kirchner
justified his government’s moves.
In fact, Kirchner used the word
“crisis” to describe the shortages that
have forced his government to ration
gas for factories in order to guarantee
enough energy to heat homes.
The government, which is also
forcing factories to switch from gas
to more-expensive diesel or fuel oil,
says it has taken steps to boost capacity—a much needed decision in a
land where oil refining is said to be
running at 95% of capacity.

output is running almost a third
higher than in 2006.
In May, for example, the output from the car industry was 40%
higher than in May 2006, while for
the first 5 months of 2006 output
was 30% higher than for the first 5
months of 2006.
According to one analyst, the auto
industry has hardly begun to take off
since, in May, even after the massive jump in output, the industry is
still running at just over 52% of its
capacity. In a word, it is working at
half-speed.

Bolivia Vice-President Alvaro Garcia
Linera has given assurances that his
country will make every effort to meet
Argentina’s rapidly increasing needs
for natural gas. His statement came in
an interview with Argentina’s Clarin
newspaper following a meeting with
Argentina’s President Néstor Kirchner.
Asked what the two men discussed,
Linera said the main focus was on energy integration and strategic agreements
between the two governments. “Right
now,” he said, “Bolivia sells Argentina
between 4.7-7.5 million cu m/day of
gas, and we have signed a contract so
that starting in 2009 or 2010 we will
gradually be delivering another 20 million cu m/day of gas. This is not only a
supply issue, but a matter of building
infrastructure, like the gas pipeline for
which Argentina conducted the bidding
procedure last week.”
Asked if a concession could be withdrawn from a private company if it fails
to meet its commitments, Linera said
that the arrangement means that “Argentina will definitely have the gas that
it has contracted for, no matter what.”
He said, “We are confident about this,
based on how things are going after the
agreement on the investment plans of
the foreign companies that are operating
in Bolivia. But for us as a government,
the Argentine market is a strategic market
and we are going to guarantee its supplies above all.”
Linera noted that Kirchner was concerned about Argentina’s current energy
crisis, saying that he has “many plans”
regarding it. Last week, Kirchner used
the word “crisis” to describe the severe
shortages that have forced his government to ration gas for factories to guarantee enough energy to heat homes.

“We have to cut [gas supplies] where it
hurts least,” Alberto Fernández, cabinet
chief, acknowledged last month—a
reference to the government’s desire
to avoid hitting domestic supplies four
months before presidential elections.
Kirchner says the country’s dramatic
economic growth has created bottlenecks, a point underlined by Linera,
who told Clarin, “The energy crisis
exists throughout the entire continent,
and it is related to the economic boom,
which is more modest than the boom
in China, but [which] is still significant.

Economic growth means more energy.
And the sustainability of that growth
requires a process of increased integration and solidarity.”
Last October Bolivia agreed to sell
gas to Argentina that was worth more
than $16 billion over the next 20 years,
despite concerns that Bolivia’s unstable
political climate would hinder the scale
of investment necessary to extract and
transport the gas.
At the time, Kirchner signed an
agreement with Morales to increase
gas imports fourfold in a drive to ease

Argentina’s increasingly serious energy
shortages. Argentina currently imports
7.7 million cu m/day, which, according
to the agreement, will be increased to
27.7 million cu m/day by 2010.
Although Bolivia has the secondlargest reserves of gas in South America,
reports said a lack of infrastructure in
the country means some $2-3 billion
will have to be invested in exploration
and development, while a further $1.2
billion will be needed to transport the
gas, as existing pipelines are running at
full capacity. ✦

This is the second of two parts on oil
and gas exploration in the Jiuxi basin in
northwestern China.
Exploration started in the basin in
1938.
The basin has one of China’s earliest commercial oil discoveries and is
considered the cradle of the Chinese
petroleum industry.
By the end of 2003, 540 exploratory
wells had been
drilled, with a
density of 0.2
well/sq km.
Six oil fields—
Laojunmiao,
Yaerxia,
Shiyougou,
Baiyanghe, Shanbei, and Qingxi—were
discovered in succession. The reservoirs
are Silurian, Cretaceous, and Tertiary.
Discovered reserves are 148 million
tons of oil, and the present production
is 700,000 tons/year.
Oil exploration in basin came in
three stages from 1932-82, 1983-96,
and 1997-present.

In August 1939, the Tertiary Laojunmiao oil field was discovered by drilling
the Lao-1 exploratory well, kicking off
petroleum exploration and development in the Jiuquan Region.
In 1949, cumulative proved reserves reached 27.66 million tons and
production was 69,200 tons/year (Figs.
14 and 15). In the 1950s, exploration
continued along the anticline belt and
consequently, Yaerxia and Oil Gully Tertiary oil fields were found; and the Tertiary Baiyanghe and Shanbei oil fields
were discovered in the Baiyanghe thrust
belt in the northern part of the basin.
At the end of 1959, cumulative proved
reserves reached 61.61 million tons and
production was 1.4 million tons/year,
at its historical peak.
From the 1960s to the early 1980s,
little prospecting progress was made.
Two small pools were found in faulted

increased cumulative proved reserves by
only 16.36 million tons. Thus, oil production fell sharply from 1.09 million
tons in 1960 to 0.406 million tons in
1965. Thereafter, the annual production
stayed around 0.40-0.60 million tons.

Formation protection
Kulongshan reservoirs have high formation pressure gradients ranging from
1.20 to 1.36, and serious formation
damage will occur when drilling fluid
pressure exceeds the formation pressure by 0.03 in gradient, as indicated by
experiments.
During the drilling, therefore, drilling fluid density is strictly controlled
and not more than 0.02 higher than the
formation pressure gradient; no barite
powder is used for well control; and
a formation protection agent is added
before drilling through the producing
intervals.
The near-balanced drilling and formation protection technology has minimized formation damage. For example,
barite powder was added many times to
control Well L2 at the structural high of
Kulongshan when a well kick occurred
at a depth of 4,016 m. As a result, the
well has a low oil yield of 4.13 cu m/
day on formation test.
On the other hand, Well L5, which
was drilled 253 m from Well L2, encountered the same situation at a depth
of 4,029 m. In this case, near-balanced
drilling and formation protection technology were applied and, as a result,
high oil production was obtained.

Reservoir stimulation
Deep acidization is necessary to free
hydrocarbons from the fractured reservoirs in Qingxi oil field to the maximum extent in order to substantially
enhance production.
Deep acidization technology for
shaly dolomite and conglomerate
reservoirs has been developed through
many rounds of experiments and has
achieved excellent results. The increased
oil production that resulted from deep
acidization accounts for 36% of total
production in Qingxi oil field.

Lessons learned
The discovery of Qingxi oil field and
the successful oil prospecting beneath
the nappes of the Qilian Mountains
have not only revitalized 60-year-old oil
fields but also demonstrated the great
exploration potential of the foreland
thrust belts abundant in central and
western China.
Strengthened seismic surveys in the
piedmont thrust belt of the Jiuxi basin
has discovered a number of favorable
prospecting targets beneath the nappe,
such as the Jinhaizi, Qingtoushan, and
Jinfomiao structures, since the discovery of Qingxi oil field. The total trap
area reaches nearly 200 sq km, and the

prospective oil resources exceed 230
million tons. Future exploration will
certainly add many more reserves.
The discovery of Qingxi oil field has
inspired hydrocarbon exploration in
thrust belts in central to western China.
In only a few years, many large gas
fields have been discovered in the Kuche
foreland of the Tarim basin, including
wells Kela 2, Dina 2, and Wushen 1,
and the recoverable gas reserves have
reached 581.9 bcm.
At the southern edge of the Junggar
basin, Hutubi gas field and Huoerguosi
oil and gas field have been discovered,
with proved, probable, and possible
hydrocarbon reserves exceeding 200

Continued innovation in modeling and
algorithm development
has led to new process
control for the CyberDrilling
base/SDI drilling command center. Collaboration between the International Research
Institute of Stavanger AS (IRIS; formerly
Rogaland Research) and National Oilwell Varco (NOV) in developing the
Drilltronics system led to successful
land rig tests in 2006 and to field tests
off Norway later this year.
The general concept of the Drilltronics system is to monitor and control
the drilling process using continuously
updated models for better control, efficiency, and safety. Continuous diagnostic control allows early detection of
emerging problems via a set of alarms.
The Drilltronics system calculates drilling limits and enforces them in realtime.
Current automated functionalities
include automated tripping and reaming control, automated and optimized
pump-buildup control, automated well
friction test (pick up/rotation/slack
off), bit-load optimization (continuous
drill-off), and stick slip prevention (Fig.
1). The Drilltronics system also provides
diagnostics for hole cleaning, stuck
pipe, pressure, pit volume, cuttings
buildup, and torque and drag.

It is an “intelligent” system that takes
drilling data and immediately optimizes
performance with integrated controls,
said Fionn Iversen, research advisor and
project leader for Drilltronics development at IRIS; the system could “become
an integral part of every drilling rig.”

Cyberbase
Drilltronics is designed to work with
the current Cyberbase
workstation
systems.
The
Cyberbase operator system was developed
by Norway’s Hitec ASA in the 1990s.
Cyberbase is a drilling equipment
command system enclosed in a driller’s
cabin on the drill floor. Cyberbase drillers’ chairs include joysticks and keypads
dynamically tied to a set of computer
screens, replacing the older system of
gauges, lights, and switches.
Hitec had also created an automated
system for handling and joining drill
pipe and casing, and it collaborated
with National Oilwell Inc. in designing
the active heave compensated drilling
system, which integrated a state-of-theart computer control system into the
drawworks. ActiveHeave compensates

below.

Process models
Two continuously updated process models form
the basis of the control and
diagnostic functionality of
the Drilltronics system:
• A dynamic well flow
model calculates pressure
and temperature based on
injected flow rate, drillstring movement, and
thermal boundary data.
• A string mechanics
model calculates string
torque, drag, and mechanical friction factor based on
surface load and torque
measurements and input
from the flow model.
The calculation modules
are run on a calculation
server separate from the
Cyberbase/SDI system.

is valuable, Welmer said.
While the drawworks

the new NOV stick-slip system module enables active

NOV’s Rugland said that

said “While there has been significant
progress in industry communication
standards, better use of technology is
needed to enable integration and fast,
effective data-sharing“ (OGJ, Jan. 9,
2006, p. 29).
Downhole data transfer is generally
discontinuous and the resolution is
30 sec to 1 min, but wired pipe offers
better resolution, about 1 sec.2 The increased resolution allows more frequent
updates and better model calibration.
BP’s John Thorogood, chief engineer
for Elvary Neftegaz’ Sakhalin exploration program, told OGJ that the Drilltronics system is “potentially the single
most powerful breakthrough piece of
drilling technology I’ve seen for many
years...[holding out] the possibility
of creating a dramatic reduction in the
risk of human-induced error leading
to stuck pipe, downhole problems etc.
[It’s] probably the most revolutionary piece of technology since the top
drive.” ✦

of 156 million tpy. The graph shows
that most expansions will occur in the
Middle East and Asia. By 2011, CMAI
predicts, ethylene capacity in Asia will
exceed 45 million tpy with additions in
China, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea,
and Thailand.
Ethylene capacity in the Middle East
will approach 30 million tpy, which
will place the region on level with
North America’s ethylene capacity, says
CMAI. ✦

March 3 – 5, 2008 / Moody Gardens Hotel & Convention Center, Galveston, Texas

SUBSEA TIEBACK
Forum & Exhibition

PennWell invites you back to the 8th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition.
SSTB has become the premier event for one of the fastest growing field
development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March 3 – 5, 2008 in
Galveston, TX at the Moody Gardens Hotel & Conference Center. Over 2,000
people and 150 exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference.You can’t
afford to miss it.
As our industry confronts new challenges, it has never been more important
to submerse yourself in them. This year’s theme is “Subsea is here, the game
is changing.” As our game changes, the sharing of knowledge and collective
experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety,
and economics of the subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by
industry leaders. As in the past, only by participating in this conference will you
be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will not be published and no
Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room
stays inside the conference room. We hope you will join us.

Tanker market earnings for the half-year

while market rates eroded as the fleet expanded,

leading to forecasts of
softer market conditions ahead. Clarkson Research Services
Ltd. detailed the reasons behind these
market movements as well as offering forecasts of future market
direction in its Spring 2007
“Shipping Market Outlook: A
Half-Yearly Review of the Shipping Market.”
According to Clarkson data,
the tanker market, comprised of
both modern and early 1990s VLCCs,
modern Suezmax, modern Aframax,
and both dirty and clean products carriers, averaged $34,025/day in earnings
from September 2006 to March 2007,
a 0.1% increase from the $33,984/
day seen March-September 2006. A
24.8% increase in Aframax earnings, to
$44,060/day, helped offset a more than
16% drop in VLCC earnings, which fell
to $53,172 and $49,452/day for modern and early 1990s vessels, respectively
(Table 1).

other findings in a few of the numerous vessel categories covered twice each
year by Clarkson in its Shipping Market
Outlooks.

Market outlook

The interplay of a strong world
economy and high oil prices shaped the
tanker market for the 6 months ending
Mar. 1, 2007, according to Clarkson. It
cites the combination of lower-thanexpected oil demand growth in 2006
(0.8 million b/d instead of 1.8 million
b/d) and the fact that almost half of
this growth occurred in non-importing
regions such as Russia and the Middle
East as having had a particularly bearish
effect on the tanker industry.
Crude tankers of all categories lost
ground against 10-year average rates
over the 6 months, but ship values held
up better, with a 5-year old Suezmax
tanker actually increasing in value to
$82.5 million from $77 million. The
spot rate for 30,000-dwt clean product
tankers also increased to $31,737/day
from $29,171/day in the preceding 6
months. Rates for a 1-year time charter of the same vessel type, however,
slipped to $23,500/day from $27,000/
day, according to Clarkson.

Filtration system aids process plant lube reservoirs
The new VURSA Series of high-performance filtration systems is suited for

refinery and petrochemical operations.
Designed to remove particulate matter and water from lubrication oil and
hydraulic fluid reservoirs, systems can help
extend the life span of bearings and other
metal components.
Designed to accommodate a variety of
flows, voltages, filtration requirements, and
installations, self-contained units employ
the maker’s patented pleated filter media technology to remove contaminants.
Systems install quickly on the outflow line
from lubrication oil reservoirs. Easy to
service, these systems can be isolated to
facilitate filter changes and routine maintenance, the firm notes.
Systems are powered by 2 hp explosion-protected motors and equipped with
2 gpm or 5 gpm variable speed pumps.
Vessels used on the systems have a 150
psi pressure rating and a 22 psi element
bypass.

New unit helps prevent illegal oil discharge at sea
SmartSafe, a new plug-n-play, is a compact unit designed for fail-safe prevention
of illegal oil discharge at sea.
The unit monitors and records all aspects of the discharge process in real-time:
separator control, oil content output, and
flow rate and cumulative flow through the
discharge pipe. In this way it can anticipate
any illegal discharge and deal with it by
shutting off the overboard discharge valve
if necessary.
To assist with regulatory compliance,
at the end of the discharge process a batch
record is printed containing all aspects of
the discharge and any errors or inconsistencies that occurred during the process.
As much as 2 years of discharge data can
be stored and presented.
Data are stored within SmartSafe and
can be played back graphically on its builtin screen.

Poison ivy seen
as thriving on
carbon dioxide
As if rising sea levels and malaria
plagues weren’t frightening enough, the
world has another malign effect of global
warming over which to panic: poison ivy.
News media recently reported a Duke
University study showing that rising concentrations of carbon dioxide accelerate
growth of the obnoxious vine through aerial
fertilization. Worse, they increase potency of
the substance that causes itchy rashes.

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

Until now, supporters of aggressive
warming prevention have scoffed at suggestions that CO2 enrichment of the atmosphere might promote plant growth. Their
political agenda treats CO2 as a thoroughgoing scourge and resists hints of potential
beneﬁts.
But aerial fertilization suits that agenda
when the main beneﬁciary is a plant nobody likes.
The Duke study controlled CO2 levels in
an experimental plot of a North Carolina
forest. At rising levels, poison ivy grew
faster and nastier. As another reason to fear
global warming, the results became news.
As usual, however, things aren’t that
simple.
A study by Ronald Londre and Stefan
Schnitzer of the University of WisconsinMilwaukee examined 45 years of data from
14 deciduous forests in southern Wisconsin
to test the hypothesis that warming and CO2
enrichment should push lianas—woody vines
such as poison ivy—toward Earth’s poles. In
that study liana growth decreased in forest
interiors, with the decline accelerating as a
function of distance from forest edges.
“Our ﬁndings suggest that forest
fragmentation, not climate change, is likely
resulting in the increase in liana abundance
in northern deciduous temperate forests
and that lianas may further increase in
abundance and impact if the severity of forest fragmentation intensiﬁes,” the researchers said.
CO2 Science, an online magazine published by the Center for the Study of Carbon
Dioxide and Global Change—which opposes
aggressive prevention—opined on July 4
that the warming and increased CO2 fertilization of the Londre and Schnitzer study
period accelerated tree growth in forest
interiors enough to deprive lianas of light.
If so, poison ivy would seem not to be
the only plant able to beneﬁt from rising
CO2 levels. But the implications for, say,
global food supply are hardly frightening.
They probably won’t make the news.

OPEC spare productive capacity ‘diminished’
Increasing global demand for crude and natural production declines have diminished the excess productive capacity of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries and its power to manipulate oil prices, said analysts J. Marshall Adkins
and Collin Gerry in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc.
Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s biggest oil producer, plans to raise its production capacity
to 12.5 million b/d by 2012 from 10.5 million b/d currently. “For the record, we don’t
think the magnitude of this increase is attainable,” said Adkins and Gerry in a July 9
report. “The more relevant issue is that declining productivity and political instability
of other OPEC member nations are likely to mute any success that Saudi Arabia has
with increasing OPEC’s productive capacity,” they said.
Potential OPEC production increases are offset by ﬁve member countries that
are facing either permanent production declines or structural constraints, they said.
“Over the past 40 years, OPEC has historically had a cushion of anywhere between
4-16 million b/d, excluding certain geopolitical events (which occurred mainly in the
1970s),” Raymond James reported. That gave the cartel its control of oil markets.
“Today, OPEC’s excess capacity has all but disappeared,” the analysts said.
In October 2006, when domestic and international oil inventories were at relatively high levels and increasing, OPEC announced a two-part production cut that would
take some 1.7 million b/d of crude off the market. In aggregate, the cartel successfully implemented more than half of the proposed cuts, between 1-1.2 million b/d with
roughly half of that attributed to Saudi Arabia. “However, this may be somewhat
misleading. Looking at the production trends over the past year, it appears that at
least a third of the decline in OPEC production has been involuntary in nature,” said
Adkins and Gerry.
OPEC production now is 1.9 million b/d below its peak in October 2005. “It appears that nearly half of this decline is attributable to involuntary cuts” by Indonesia, Iran, Nigeria, and Venezuela, said the Raymond James analysts. The aggregate
production of these four countries, “which constitutes 30% of total OPEC production,
was declining well before the cartel initiated its ofﬁcial cuts,” analysts said.
National breakdowns
Oil prices surged to 10-month highs July 6 as militants in Nigeria ended a monthlong truce with an attack on a well site and the kidnapping of a 3-year-old British girl.
The child was grabbed by gunmen July 5 as she was being dropped off at school
in Port Harcourt by her father, an employee in the petroleum industry. She was released apparently unharmed July 8, but three foreign workers were abducted. More
than 200 foreigners, mostly oil workers or members of their families, have been
kidnapped in Nigeria since January 2006. Nearly all were subsequently released or
freed by government soldiers.
“Because of these internal problems, Nigeria has been forced to shut in as much
as 800,000–1 million b/d of production, and it now produces about 2 million b/d. We
don’t expect peace to break out in this country anytime soon. In fact, the recent escalation of kidnappings (particularly from offshore operations) is likely to drive more
operators and service companies away from the region,” said Adkins and Gerry.
Venezuela’s access to foreign capital and technology has diminished rapidly in
the last few years because of President Hugo Chavez’s drive to again nationalize the
country’s petroleum resources. “Since early 2005, Venezuela’s production has gradually and consistently declined from the 2.8 million b/d range to closer to 2.3 million
b/d, which is a decline of 15% in just over 2 years. Without outside investment or
know-how, that decline is likely to get worse before it gets better,” the analysts said.
The political climate in Iraq and Iran is not conducive for foreign investment.
Politics and sabotage have prevented Iraq from obtaining its pre-war production
levels. US companies are prohibited from doing business in Iran, and many Europeans are afraid to make major investments. “Iran’s production has been stagnating
near the 3.9 million b/d level for 21⁄2 years now. Without access to foreign capital, and
more importantly, foreign technology and infrastructure, the prospect of increasing
production meaningfully higher remains unlikely,” analysts said.
“Indonesia’s production stagnated for most of the 1990s until it began a permanent decline in 2000 from the 1.7 million b/d level to the current level of approximately 800,000 b/d. In fact, Indonesia is struggling to maintain its status as a net
exporter of oil, as it now imports almost as much or more than it produces,” Adkins
and Gerry said.

FracDoor ® Sleeve Lets
Anadarko Independently
Fracture Three Zones
in One Day
The Challenge:
Alberta, Canada — Anadarko Canada Corporation
wanted to independently fracture an upper and lower
Dunvegan formation and a Doe Creek formation in
a 1,350-meter well, without removing the completion
and production assembly from the hole. This
procedure would prevent wellbore fluid from coming
in contact with the perforations after fracturing and
create the best possible flowback during the well’s
testing and production stages.

The Solution:
To allow three fracturing jobs to be performed in one day while maintaining zonal isolation, Halliburton
recommended its FracDoor® ball-actuated Sliding Side-Door® circulation and production sleeves.
Halliburton’s FracDoor sleeve allows selective multi-zone stimulation operations through the production string
by dropping or pumping a selective ball prior to zonal stimulation. As part of the job, one FracDoor sleeve
would be placed on the completion string between the packers, and a second

ely well. The ability to
fracture three zones ind
ependently
on the same day saved
us significant
mobilization, testing and
cleanup
costs. Also, not having
to trip pipe
in each zone was a sign
ificant factor
in completing what wer

marginal zones.”
David Ramsden-Wood
Anadarko Canada Corpor
ation

The Results:
The Dunvegan and Doe Creek formations were commingled and produced at
approximately 1.6 million cubic feet per day. The economic value created
was $110,000, based on savings to Anadarko from using the Halliburton
procedure.“The FracDoor tool worked extremely well,” said Anadarko’s David
Ramsden-Wood.“The ability to fracture three zones independently on the
same day saved us significant mobilization, testing and cleanup costs. Also,
not having to trip pipe in each zone was a significant factor
in completing what were formerly marginal zones.”

Halliburton has the energy to help. For information on how the FracDoor sleeve can help stimulate your well,

BP seeks DOT nod to resume Alaska production
BP PLC submitted an application Sept. 13 to the US Department
of Transportation requesting authorization to resume production
in the Eastern Operating Area (EOA) of Prudhoe Bay for the purposes of pigging.
“Although this is an encouraging development, it is the first
step of many,” BP said. “Work continues on a number of bypass
projects, and we expect these to be ready by the end of October. BP
has also committed to completely replace 16 miles of Prudhoe Bay
OTLs [oil transit lines] this winter.”
Meanwhile, Prudhoe Bay’s production is up to about 250,000
b/d. Part of the field has been shut-down since early August because of severe corrosion problems discovered in OTLs.
Inspection of the integrity of the OTLs in Prudhoe Bay continues to advance. BP has completed more than 6,662 ft (26%) of ultrasonic (UT) inspections in the EOA. The company excavated three
caribou crossings and a number of culverts for additional Western
Operating Area (WOA) inspections.
Inspections have restarted in the WOA after the completion of
the first tranche of asbestos-handling training for UT and insulation stripping crews. More than 5,813 ft (23%) of UT inspections
has been done in the WOA.
“In both EOA and WOA inspections, our results continue to
show no significant anomalies have been found, outside of those
identified in the original pig run,” the company said.

Saudi oil minister warns of tight reﬁning capacity
Saudi Arabia’s oil and gas investments will total some $70 billion during the next 5 years, said Saudi Minister of Petroleum and
Mineral Resources Ali I. al-Naimi in a speech in Vienna Sept. 12.
Speaking before an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries international seminar, Al-Naimi said meeting global oil demand will require timely downstream investments.
“The industry must deal with a stretched refining system and
match refining capacity to the anticipated future slate of crude oil
that is becoming heavier and more sour, as well as attend to the
infrastructure bottlenecks in pipelines, terminals, shipping, and
critical sea channels,” he said.
Al-Naimi said Saudi production capacity is estimated to reach
12.5 million b/d by 2009 compared with 11 million b/d earlier
this year. The Kingdom is experiencing a drilling surge (OGJ Online, Apr. 16, 2006).
Saudi Arabia’s downstream investments include the construction of two grassroots joint-venture export refineries, each with a
capacity of 400,000 b/d.
One will be in Jubail on the kingdom’s east coast and the
other in Yanbu on the west coast. Saudi Arabia also plans to ex-

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

pand its Ras Tanura refinery, possibly transforming it into an
integrated refining and petrochemical complex (OGJ, Feb. 13,
2006, p. 24).

Bolivia’s oil minister resigns amid conﬂict
Bolivia Oil Minister Andres Soliz has resigned in the wake of a
disagreement with Brazil’s state-run Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras). Soliz had led efforts to nationalize Bolivia’s oil and gas operations.
Soliz resigned Sept. 15, the day after Bolivian Vice-President
Alvaro Garcia Linera said Bolivia was suspending a measure that
would have exerted majority controlling interest in the operations
of international companies working in Bolivia.
On Sept. 13, Soliz had issued the measure, which consequently
prompted Petrobras Chief Executive Sergio Gabrielli to cancel a trip
to Bolivia.
The measure would have reduced Petrobras’s profit margins
at two refineries and given Bolivian state-owned energy firm
Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales powers to set domestic fuel prices
(OGJ Online, Sept. 14, 2006).

Russia to boost oil exports to Asia-Paciﬁc
Russian President Vladimir Putin said a much greater percentage
of his country’s oil exports will be heading to Asia and the Pacific
in the next decade as part of a strategy of diversified marketing
aimed at creating energy security for producing countries.
“We hope and we plan to increase our energy supplies to Asia
and the Pacific from the current 3% of the country’s oil exports to
at least 30% of the overall energy exports in 10 years’ time,” Putin
told the Group of Eight countries’ parliamentary speakers in Sochi,
Russia, Sept 17.
“We are to accomplish two major transport projects to deliver
natural gas to China in this direction,” Putin said. He added, “Russia has been consistently diversifying energy export routes and
consequently has been working to make energy exports more reliable.”
He said the strategy had initially met with resistance, but that
everyone now agrees that energy security means “not only security
for consumers, but also security for producers.” He added, “Only
if we take due account of each others’ interests will we be able to
attain a positive effect.”
Putin said construction of the North European Gas Pipeline,
agreed to in early September, also forms part of his country’s strategy of energy security. ✦

DNO prepares to start oil production in Iraq

Tullow advances UK North Sea redevelopment

DNO ASA, Oslo, is planning early production, possibly in first
quarter 2007, from Tawke oil field in the northern Kurdish region
of Iraq based on test results from the discovery well and an appraisal well.
DNO achieved a maximum flow rate of 5,000 b/d of oil during
open-hole tests of Tawke-1A, a twin well 20 km from the Tawke-1
discovery well. Tawke-1 also flowed at 5,000 b/d on test (OGJ Online, June 19, 2006, Newsletter). This well penetrated two reservoir zones exceeding 2,000 m deep, which were preserved behind
casing and will be tested later.
DNO said all major facilities are secured, and it expects the development plan to be finalized and presented soon to partner Kurdistan Regional Government.
Tawke-1A was drilled in open-hole mode to retest the shallower
reservoir sections of less than 1,000 m because it is assumed that
formation damage during installation and casing in the discovery
well may have restricted oil flow.
The tests results, which were not conclusive, will be further
investigated, and additional tests of the intervals are planned in
Tawke-2, a stepout well 2 km west of the Tawke discovery. When
conducting Tawke-2 tests, a more extensive acid stimulation and
fracturing of the reservoir sections will be considered, DNO said.
Tawke-2 will penetrate only the shallower reservoir sections.
It will be followed by the drilling of an exploration well in the
eastern part of the Tawke area. DNO is performing a 3D seismic
survey across the area as part of a program to assess the area’s full
oil potential.

Tullow Oil PLC completed the Ketch 7 development well in the
Schooner-Ketch redevelopment in the UK North Sea. On test, Ketch
7 flowed at 45 MMscfd of gas, and the company expects production in early October.
The horizontal well, spudded on June 2, encountered 540 ft of
net pay along with higher-than-expected reservoir pressures. The
addition of Ketch 7 is expected to increase the production capability of Schooner and Ketch fields to more than 100 MMscfd of gas.
Other Ketch wells are expected to generate additional production. Tullow spudded the 3,000 ft horizontal Ketch 8 well on Sept.
18.
Meanwhile, the NW Schooner appraisal well, targeting an extension of Schooner field, encountered a net gas pay of 275 ft.
The well is being completed for testing, expected at the end of
September.
If the test yields commercial flow rates, the well will be suspended, and the pipeline laid for tie-in to the Schooner platform
in mid-2007.
Tullow owns 100% of Ketch 7 and 90.35% of the Schooner NW
appraisal well. The company acquired Ketch and Schooner fields in
early 2005.

Aramco discovers gas with Kassab-1 well

Statoil ﬁnd could drive LNG plant expansion
The Statoil ASA-led Snøhvit consortium is planning to drill additional wells in the Barents Sea next year and in 2008 to seek
additional gas reserves for a possible future expansion of the Hammerfest gas liquefaction plant at Melkøya in northern Norway.
The plans follow a small gas discovery on the Tornerose structure that the company finds “encouraging.”
Although Tornerose reserves alone would not provide enough
gas for expanding the LNG plant, the discovery “marks an important stage in efforts to enlarge the resource base in the area,” said
Tim Dodson, Statoil’s senior vice-president for exploration on the
Norwegian continental shelf.
“The Tornerose discovery confirms that we’re heading in the
right direction,” he said. The structure, which Dodson calls viable,
“strengthens opportunities for expanding the Snøhvit gas liquefaction facility at Melkøya.”
Statoil said Transocean Inc.’s Polar Pioneer semisubmersible rig
drilled exploration well 7122/6-2 on production license 110B in
408 m of water and proved gas in several sandstone layers from
the late-Triassic.
The well was drilled to 3,057 m TMD below sea level about 60
km east of Statoil-operated Snøhvit field and 100 km northwest of
Hammerfest.

Saudi Aramco has reported a gas discovery in Saudi Arabia’s
Eastern Province 50 km south of its giant Ghawar field and 220 km
southeast of Riyadh.
The company said its Kassab-1 well flowed on test at 16.2
MMscfd on a 44⁄64-in. choke at a wellhead pressure of 1,520 psi.
Kassab-1 was tested on Aug. 7 at 15,750 ft in the Lower Devonian Jauf sandstone reservoir underlying the prolific Upper Permian Khuff reservoir.
Pre-Khuff formations at 11,000-17,000 ft are among the major
gas-bearing reservoirs in Persian Gulf countries. The Jauf reservoir
has permeability and porosity variations with varying amounts of
framework and pore lining clay. It exhibits unconsolidation intermingled with consolidated sandstone. The high-permeability layers have excellent flow capacities, Saudi Aramco says. Jauf reservoir
sandstones primarily are of quartz with some feldspars such as orthoclase and microcline in some sandstones (OGJ, May 10, 2004,
p. 35).

Production

Repairs delay Thunder Horse production start-up
BP PLC plans to retrieve and rebuild all seabed production
equipment from Thunder Horse field in the deepwater Gulf of
Mexico following a series of tests in 4 months that showed metallurgical failure.
Consequently, BP does not expect production from Thunder
Horse to begin before mid-2008. The company said it’s too early
to estimate the additional costs.
The original projected start up was for late 2005, but it has
been pushed back as BP has resolved “many technology gaps” that
emerged during development, a spokesman said.
Thunder Horse field was discovered in 1999. The project involves
some of the highest-temperature, highest-pressure wells in the gulf.
The semisubmersible platform weighs more than 50,000 tons
and is designed to process 250,000 b/d of oil and 200 MMscfd of
gas. BP operates the development, owning 75% interest, and ExxonMobil Corp. owns the remaining interest.
The platform had to be restored to normal trim last year. That
incident is unrelated to the latest subsea equipment issues, BP said
(OGJ, July 25, 2005, Newsletter).
The drilling, production, and quarters platform on Mississippi
Canyon Block 778 in the Gulf of Mexico, 150 miles southeast of
New Orleans, was discovered listing 20-30° after Hurricane Dennis passed through the area (OGJ Online, July 12, 2005). The platform is moored in 6,050 ft of water.
The metallurgical problems became evident when BP conducted precommissioning tests by pumping water through the system
to establish its integrity. The equipment passed all normal industry
standard tests and regulatory requirements, but during more-rigorous and prolonged testing, a failure occurred on a subsea weld.
Consequently, BP opted to retrieve both the damaged seabed
manifold and a second manifold for additional examination and
testing. The second manifold displayed a similar failure during testing last week, BP said Sept. 18.

Bankers to study Albanian EOR pilot project
Bankers Petroleum Ltd., Calgary, reported it will begin a study
for a thermal enhanced oil recovery (EOR) pilot project in Albania’s Patos Marinza field.
A specialized EOR team has initiated the evaluation, economic
analysis, and modeling of a thermal pilot project for the southern
part of the field.
Under the current development plan, the life of Patos Marinza
field is estimated at 25 years, which represents a total incremental
oil recovery of 5-6%/year of the total field resources of 2 billion
bbl of OOIP.
Total field recovery utilizing primary production techniques is
thus estimated to be 10-12%, including the previous production
by state-owned Albpetrol.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

In Albania, the company this year has focused on continuing to
build production through the takeover and redevelopment of wells
from Albpetrol.
To date, Bankers’s activities have increased current production
to 4,200 b/d of oil. The company’s goal is to reach 10,000-15,000
b/d of oil production in 3-4 years.
While EOR recovery techniques have been shown to have the
ability to improve oil recoveries to 20-40%, it is not known at this
time what the total potential impact could be on Bankers’s Albanian reserves.

JED wins 20-acre Jonah/Pinedale spacing
JED Oil Inc., Calgary, and JMG Exploration Inc., with which JED is
pursuing a merger, said they can drill as many as 32 additional wells
on JED acreage in the Pinedale/Jonah area of Wyoming under a density ruling by the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission.
The commission approved a request to change to 20-acre from
40-acre well spacing in the Green River basin area.
In August, JED said it had drilled two gas wells in the Pinedale
area.
In the first well, JED fracture-stimulated 24 pay zones in 11
stages and encountered water in two of the stages. It was isolating
the water zones and preparing the well for production from the six
higher frac stages.
JED recently was completing and fraccing the second well,
which also encountered multiple pay zones. Before the spacing decision it had identified two other drilling locations and installed a
pipeline to market the gas.

IEA: Global crude to get heavier, sweeter
The global crude slate will become heavier and slightly sweeter
during 2006-11, predicts the International Energy Agency, Paris.
Global average crude will move to 32.5º gravity from 32.7º
during the period, IEA says in its September Oil Market Report. A
lightening of crude from the Middle East and Russia will be offset
by heavier production elsewhere. Global average sulfur content of
crude supply will decline to 1.16% from 1.18%.
IEA’s analysis covered crude oil and condensate and excluded
NGLs, biofuels, transport fuel blending components, and refinery
processing gains. It used production capacities of members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries rather than actual
production.
In the Middle East, which accounts for 36% of an expected 9.6
million b/d supply increase through 2011, crude lightens to 34.1º
from 34.0º gravity while dropping to 1.73% sulfur from 1.78%.
The quality changes come mainly from new condensate streams,
especially in Qatar and Iran, and Saudi Arabia’s attempt to boost
supply of Arab Light crude at the expense of heavier and sourer
grades, IEA says.

The most improvement in projected quality in IEA’s analysis
occurs in the former Soviet Union, where average crude will rise
to 34.3º from 33.7º gravity while sulfur content drops to 1.15%
from 1.28%.
While Russian Urals crude moderates the effect, the improvement will come from Azeri crude and Shah Deniz liquids off Azerbaijan, production from Russia’s Sakhalin projects, and supply
from Kazakhstan’s Karachaganak and Kashagan fields.
Oil supply will sweeten slightly to 0.35% sulfur in Africa and to
1.07% in Latin America by 2011, IEA says. But production becomes
heavier by 0.7-0.8º gravity in each region to 35.4º gravity in Africa

Processing
BP to invest $3 billion in Whiting reﬁnery upgrade
BP PLC is in the final planning stage of a $3 billion investment
to increase capacity to process Canadian heavy crude oil at its
399,000 b/cd Whiting refinery in northwest Indiana.
The company said reconfiguring the refinery has the potential
to increase production of motor fuels by about 15% from its current capacity of 4.5 billion gal/year.
The project includes construction of a world-scale coking unit,
a hydrogen production plant, and sulfur recovery facilities. BP said
the replacement processing units and enhancements to existing
refinery units will increase Canadian heavy crude oil processing
capability by about 260,000 b/d.
Project construction is slated to begin in 2007 and be completed by 2011, pending regulatory approvals.

Contract awarded for Tatarstan reﬁnery
CJSC Nizhnekamsk Refinery has let a contract to Foster Wheeler
Ltd.’s Paris-based subsidiary Foster Wheeler France SA for front-end
engineering and design for a refining and petrochemical complex
to be built in Nizhnekamsk in Tatarstan, Russia.
The contract, terms for which were not disclosed, is an addition
to an existing project management consultancy contract awarded
in 2005.
The planned complex, expected to cost more than $3 billion, will
consist of a refinery with 140,000 b/d distillation capacity, a deep
conversion refinery, and a petrochemical plant. Construction of the
complex will occur in three separate phases during 2008-10.

and 25.5º gravity in Latin America. Driving the quality changes are
increased deepwater production off Angola and Brazil.
Like its production, the Asia-Pacific region’s crude quality will
change little, averaging 34º gravity and 0.18% sulfur.
North American supply will degrade to 27.7º gravity in 2011
from 27.0º in 2006 and to 1.60% sulfur from 1.54%. Growing
production from Canadian oil sands is the main reason.
Supply from the North Sea will move to 35.8º gravity from
35.4º in IEA’s study period. Sulfur content will rise to 0.38% in
2008 but return in 2011 to its 2006 level of 0.37%. ✦

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
The oil processing section of the complex will include aromatic units and a deep conversion section with a fluidized catalytic
cracker, a distillate hydrocracker, a delayed coker, and a gasification
plant. The petrochemical section of the complex will include purified terephthalic acid, polyethylene terephthalate, linear alkylbenzene and polypropylene units, plus the associated power generation facilities.

Neste gets animal fat for biodiesel production
Neste Oil Corp. has signed long-term procurement contracts
with Honkajoki Oy and Findest Protein Oy, both owned by Finnish
food manufacturers, for the supply of animal fat for biodiesel production at Neste’s 200,000 b/cd Porvoo, Finland, refinery.
Neste plans to import additional animal fat to supplement insufficient Finnish supplies, said Kimmo Rahkamo, Neste Oil’s executive vice-president, components.
Current diesel fuel production capacity at Porvoo is 4 million
tonnes/year, but Neste Oil is constructing a 170,000-tonne/year
biodiesel plant on the site as the European Union has challenged
member nations to increase renewable biofuel usage to 5.75% of
all gasoline and diesel fuels by 2010.
Production at the plant will be based on Neste Oil’s proprietary
technology that can use a flexible input of any vegetable oil or
animal fat.
Biofuel production is expected to begin in summer 2007 at the
new €100 million plant. ✦

Rate of conversion

____________

12

The ongoing discussions about “peak
oil” have continually skirted the one unifying concept which addresses the reality about the (eventual) peaking of global
liquids production. The realities can
perhaps best be summarized by addressing the rate of conversion of resources to
production capacity or supply.
Our industry is perhaps flat out in
terms of its abilities to add additional
low-cost supply. We may be at the peak
rate of conversion reflected in increasing
costs from the service providers and the
squeezing of profitability for producers.
In some areas, this increase in costs (and
reduction in product prices) is reflected
in margins of profitability being reduced
to levels experienced in the 1990s.
Indeed, this is also occurring when the
intensity of effort (aided by marvelous
digital capabilities) by an aging but limited skilled workforce for small but profitable reserves has never been greater.
We have seen a number of recent
comments by executives associated
with larger oil and gas enterprises who
allude to the vast global endowment of
hydrocarbons (“adequate resources”)
sufficient to meet projected global
demand for liquid fuels but in the fine
print have caveats such as “provided
there are timely access, investment, and
technological gains.” Of course, there is
the added implication that such caveats
will provide for a sustainable profitable
industry.
Arguments about adequate resources
provide little comfort to those charged
with finding, developing, and producing
the enormous amounts of hydrocarbon
liquids to feed the apparently ever-growing global appetite. Indeed, to suggest
there are adequate physical hydrocarbon
resources is a “no-lose” use of terminology.
A better appreciation of the difficulties now apparent is to consider the issue
as one to do with the rate of conversion
of hydrocarbon resources to capacity. The
rate or pace of conversion to required
products has many chokepoints or
bottlenecks. Some are, for example, an
adequate skilled workforce, availability
of suitable drilling rigs, tanker capacity,
refining capacity, resource habitat, field

size distributions, basin location, access
to the resources (actual or speculated),
environmental constraints including
emissions, water, the price “margin,”
profitability, available investment, fiscal
terms, technological limitations, suitable
markets, truck tires, return on energy
investment, etc. The importance of any
principle choke point, for example, may
vary between geographic regions, the
type of products, and markets, but, no
matter what the choke point, the rate of
conversion is impeded.
Vast resources of oil sands and oil
in shales do not answer the issue (OGJ,
Apr. 24, 2006, p. 32). For example,
if we accept 175 billion bbl of oil as
resources in the Alberta oil sands, even at
a production rate of 3 million b/d or 1
billion bbl/year, the annualized “rate of
conversion” is less than 1%. This is less
than the current global production loss
per annum via field and basin depletion.

We should all be aware that the rate
of conversion might be reaching a peak
irrespective of demand, price, netback,
crude quality, and the speculated global
endowment of resources. This “peak”
has already occurred in many oil and
gas productive basins, which have had
an historical transparency in terms of
access, ready markets, favorable fiscal
terms, security, and perceived political
risk.

Russian energy security
While voicing concern for energy security,
Russia last week forfeited its credibility on the
subject. At an international meeting in Sochi, Russia, Sept. 17, President Vladimir Putin described
his country’s plans to boost energy exports to the
Asia-Pacific region. He validly asserted that security of markets is as important to producing nations as security of supply is to consumers. Yet he
had nothing to say about security of investments
crucial to supply.
Indeed, the day after the Sochi remarks, Putin’s
government announced a move that might shut
Royal Dutch Shell PLC and its partners out of a
$20 billion production, pipeline, and LNG project
under construction on Sakhalin Island in the Russian Far East. The stunner evoked protests from,
among numerous other parties, Japanese importers relying on LNG from the jeopardized second
phase of the Sakhalin-2 project.
With energy security, perspective is everything.

Jab to Europe
Putin’s commentary about security of markets
jabbed Europe as much as it provided context for
Russia’s export plans. The Asia-Pacific claim on
Russian energy exports, Putin said, will rise to
30% in 10 years from 3% now, largely because
of new gas pipelines to China. Russian gas piped
eastward is gas not available to Europe, where
importers won’t find much comfort in the Russian
president’s mention of the planned North European Gas Pipeline as part of his market diversification strategy.
Europeans have been in an understandable
uproar over security of Russian gas supply since
January, when state-owned Gazprom curtailed
pipeline deliveries to Ukraine during a price
dispute with noisy political undertones, disrupting
gas movement to Europe. At a May Russian-European Union summit in Sochi, EU officials advocated the European Energy Charter, an agreement
Russia hasn’t ratified that would broaden access
to Russian energy supplies and transportation. In
response, Putin demanded concessions from the
EU. His hard line aggravated concern that Russia is
reverting to Soviet-style use of energy to influence
international politics. But the Russian president
had reason to be testy: EU members were already
scrambling to find gas sources other than Russia.

Whatever the provocation, Moscow’s determination to squeeze foreign energy buyers and
investors is clear and disturbing. For nearly 3 years,
an open question has been whether the jailing of
Yukos founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky and expropriation of the company’s assets represented onetime brutalities reserved for politically adventurous Russians. Apparently, foreign companies have
reason to worry.
A government injunction that rescinds permits
for Sakhalin-2’s second phase alleges threats to
marine life resulting from inadequacy of environmental safeguards. Shell and its partners in Sakhalin Energy Investment Co., Mitsubishi and Mitsui,
dispute the claims. But revocation of the permits
effectively suspends the project, the second phase
of which was to begin LNG deliveries next year. Oil
production under the first phase started in 1999.
There has been speculation that Russia is pressuring the Sakhalin-2 partnership to improve
terms of the planned acquisition of a 25% interest
by Gazprom. The Russian company agreed to the
deal before Sakhalin Energy doubled cost estimates
for the project last year. If that’s the motive, the
tactic is barbaric. It’s no less so if there really is an
environmental problem. Summary project suspension is no way to enforce regulation; in fact, it
makes the allegations suspicious.

Energy crackdown
Moscow’s energy crackdown is advancing on
other fronts. The Financial Times on Sept. 20 reported
threats by Russian prosecutors to suspend the license
of TNK-BP to develop Kovytka gas field in eastern
Siberia. In that case, as with Sakhalin-2, the allegations are environmental in nature, and Gazprom
also is flirting for a stake in the venture. And Interfax
reported that an official of the Natural Resources
Ministry has hinted that the other two Sakhalin Island
projects are in violation of their licenses.
From any perspective, energy security suffers
when government pressures in important producing nations weaken the foundations for international investment. Security comes more from the
interdependence central to business activity than
from controls and decrees. But business depends
on trust and rule of law. Moscow’s apparent preference for domination undermines anything it says
about energy security. ✦

Since 2002, storm-related natural
gas production shutins in the Gulf of
Mexico have had a much greater impact
on the US gas market than in previous
years. Facilities insurers seem to think
this a trend that is here to stay.
The combined effects of the 2004
and 2005 hurricane seasons had an
impact across all sectors of the US gas
industry. Hurricane Ivan, which made
landfall in September
2004, caused more
long-term gas production interruptions than
any previous hurricane,
but its impacts were
dwarfed by Hurricanes
Katrina (landfall Aug. 29,
2005) and Rita (Sept. 24, 2005). The
combined effects of Hurricanes Katrina
and Rita were by far the most damaging in the history of the US petroleum
industry (Fig. 1).
The hurricanes also substantially
damaged gas processing and pipeline
facilities needed to process and deliver
gas to customers. It will take the industry several years to recover from the
disruptions, and some lost production
will never be recovered.
The Gulf of Mexico accounts for
40% of US gas production. This concentration of gas production, processing, and transportation facilities in the
gulf and on the Gulf Coast means that

a significant percentage of domestic oil
and gas production and processing is
vulnerable to disruption by hurricanes.
The volume of gas production curtailed during the third week of October
2005 from both onshore and offshore
areas of the Gulf Coast was 5 bcfd—
about one half of prehurricane offshore
production. The US Minerals Management Service (MMS) in June of this year
reported that the cumulative shut-in gas
production from Aug. 26, 2005, to June
19, 2006, was 803.6 bcf. That is about
22% of the total annual gas production
in the gulf (3.65 tcf). To place this in
perspective, 630 bcf of gas was imported into the US as LNG in 2005.

Status of recovery
Recovery efforts in the Gulf of
Mexico in fourth quarter 2005 were
impressive, returning to service some
three quarters of the supplies shut in by
offshore and onshore storm damage in
Louisiana. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) reported in
February of this year that 2.4 bcfd of
production remained shut in by January—1.8 bcfd offshore and 0.6 bcfd
onshore in Louisiana.
The pace of recovery alleviated immediate gas supply concerns for the
winter of 2005-06. In the first half
of 2006 there was a progressive and
substantial improvement in both oil and
gas production from the gulf. In Fig.
2 the volume of shut-in offshore and
onshore Gulf of Mexico gas production
illustrates the scale of the 2005 hurricanes’ impact and the pace of recovery.
Energy and Environmental Analysis
Inc., Arlington, Va., forecast that cumulative gas shutins to August 2006 for
Katrina and Rita would be 900-1,100
bcf. This volume, which has proved to
be an accurate prediction, was more
than five times the shut-in volume from
Hurricane Ivan.
MMS in June reported shut-in gas
production of 935.67 MMcfd. This
is equivalent to 9.4% of the daily gas
production in the gulf, which currently
is 10 bcfd.
Of the 68 platforms still evacuated

Natural gas price, $/MMbtu

After Hurricane Ivan, Henry Hub
gas prices increased to a peak of
$8/MMbtu from $6/MMbtu in July
2004. By February 2005, gas prices had
returned to slightly more than $6/
MMbtu but shot up again during the
summer to about $10/MMbtu as world
oil prices rose and gas supply concerns
increased. Gas prices then increased significantly in third quarter 2005, trading
as high as $16/MMbtu on spot markets
after Hurricanes Rita and Katrina (Fig.
3). The spot gas price trend at Henry
Hub from July 2005 to July 2006 illustrates the impact of the 2005 hurricanes
and, apart from early December 2005,
the mild winter that followed.
Since then, prices have fluctuated
predictably with changing weather:
lower during a warm November 2005,
higher during very cold weather in
early December 2005—peaking above
$15/MMbtu—and again moving lower
during the milder 2006 winter and
spring. Prices dropped progressively to
less than $5.50/MMbtu in early July
of this year from above $8/MMbtu in
late January, but prices reversed in July,
rising above $8/MMbtu on July 31 to
the highest level in almost 6 months.
The price hike was a response to hot
summer weather and anticipated record
seasonal demand for electricity.
These prices, although much lower
than the peak prices in third and fourth
quarters 2005, are still high by historical US standards. Before the hurricanes,
gas prices had reached levels that

in June this year, 66 are in the Lake
Charles, Lafayette, and New Orleans areas, where more than 80% of the shutin gas is located. It now appears that
at least some of this remaining shut-in
production may never be fully recovered. These evacuations are equivalent
to 8.3% of 819 manned platforms.
The position for gas was substantially better than for oil. MMS in June
reported shut-in oil production of
179,970 b/d of oil, equivalent to some
12% of the daily oil production in the
gulf, i.e., about 1.5 million b/d.

reflected an ongoing tightness between
supply and demand. Despite the mild
2005-06 winter, gas markets appear
to expect gas prices to remain high in
historical terms for some years. These
prices likely will persist until domestic
gas production increases or, more likely,
until additional LNG import capacity
materializes.
Declining domestic production,
coupled with increasing demand and
limited import capacity, caused the tight
gas supply-demand balance that has
prevailed in recent years. This undoubtedly magnified the impact of large-scale

hurricane disruptions on energy supply
and prices and is also influencing ongoing responses.
Spot Henry Hub gas prices averaged
$8.86/Mcf in 2005, and the US Energy.
Information Administration (EIA) in
July of this year expected prices to
average less than $7/Mcf for the third
quarter. Barring extreme weather for
the remainder of 2006, EIA in July
expected a decline in the 2006 annual
average Henry Hub spot price to about
$7.61/Mcf. However, the agency expected these relatively low prices to be
short-lived, as concerns about potential
future supply tightness and continuing

have contributed to this high midyear
gas storage level.
Indeed, LNG imports in the first
quarter of this year were down substantially from 2005 and 2004 levels, partly
due to high gas stocks, but LNG imports rebounded strongly in the second
quarter to further boost gas stocks.

In addition to increased gas in
storage, the impact of the hurricanes
triggered action by regulatory authorities, who accelerated progress in gas
infrastructure and market developments
that had been impeded by slow regulatory responses in recent years. These
include:
• Approving applications for a
substantial number of new LNG receiving terminals to facilitate expansion of
imported gas.
• Approving applications for new
pipelines and changes to pipeline tariffs
to help pipelines force compliance with
operational flow orders. This will enable
pipeline companies to maintain system
reliability and avoid bottlenecks during
periods of unexpected gas supply interruption.
• FERC this year strengthened its
enforcement policy and its ability to
detect gas market manipulation, which
has been an historic problem for the gas
markets during periods of high prices.
It also now has powers to impose
higher penalties for market manipulation violations.
Since deregulation of the US gas
market in 1989, FERC does not directly
regulate most wholesale gas prices and
has no jurisdiction over retail gas prices,
but it does issue infrastructure approvals
and has the power to act against illegal
manipulation of the gas markets.

problem in winters through to 2008-09
(Fig. 5).
Depending on contract price indexation either to the price of oil—common
in Europe and Asia—or a gas hub benchmark price such as Henry Hub in the US
or the UK’s National Balancing Point, the
price of delivered LNG can vary substantially between regional markets. As a result, where short-term contracts permit,
gas sellers have diverted LNG deliveries
to northwest Europe to take advantage
of the high prices, and deliveries of LNG
to the US were lower as a consequence
in fourth quarter 2005 and first quarter
2006 (Fig. 6). Of course, diversions in
the other direction also occur when the
prices in the US exceed those in Europe.
In the future, as more gas-producing
countries build LNG liquefaction-export
plants, diversifying and increasing overall
supply, international competition for that
gas is expected to be strong, particularly
in the Atlantic Basin. As a result, new
LNG import terminal and regasification
infrastructure is set to play a key role
in the future US gas supply, and both
long-term and short-term LNG contracts
will probably be required to secure LNG
volumes in periods of peak demand. ✦

The Sakhalin
bear dance

D

ancing with the Russian bear has
been the rage lately, especially
in the oil industry. It reminds me of
the old song “Simon Smith and His
Dancing Bear.”
As the lyrics go, “Oh, I’d step
out in style with my sincere smile
and my dancing bear.” And they go
on to say, “Oh, who would think a
boy and bear could be well accepted
everywhere. Its just amazing how fair
people can be.”
Words to that effect may well
have been believed by many folks in
the oil and gas industry, judging by
the number of bears in the Kremlin
picking up partners right and left.
Many of their sincere smiles, though,
have turned to unhappy frowns as the
erstwhile partners now see the lyrics
in an altogether different light.

New light
That light shone last week when
Russian Natural Resources Minister
Yuriy Trutnev signed a document revoking the order of 2003 endorsing a
positive environmental analysis of the
Sakhalin-2 project. And pace any legal
niceties, that order came into force
the moment it was signed.
It all came about on Sept. 18,
when Trutnev considered an objection by Deputy Prosecutor-Gen.
Aleksandr Buksman to the ministry’s
order of July 15, 2003, called “On
endorsing the conclusions of the
commission of experts drawn from
the state environmental analysis of
the feasibility study for the integrated
development of the Piltun-Astokhskiy
and Lunskiy licensed fields (stage 2
of the Sakhalin-2 project).”
28

Not much was said about Buksman’s objections, nor are we to
expect much ever will be said—certainly not in the courts. At best, we
are left to understand that the Russians either are using the revocation
as a bargaining ploy to get a slice of
the project, or they want to dance off
with the whole thing.

Soft shoe
Royal Dutch Shell PLC, which
has a 55% stake in the project, has
been in talks with state-owned OAO
Gazprom for more than a year about
trading 25% of its share in Sakhalin2. Gazprom has been offering a 50%
stake in one of its onshore fields in
central Siberia, but Shell has not been
overly keen.
Last week, ahead of Trutman’s
revocation, Gazprom suddenly said
the talks with Shell over the possible
asset swap were off. There was no
explanation at all, just a closed door.
Gazprom said there had been “no
movement in the past year,” and that
was that. The dance was over.
Or was it? The main question
being asked in industry circles was
whether the Kremlin’s tough line
spelled seriously bad news for Shell
or whether it was simply a negotiating ploy to extract better terms from
the deal for Russia.
Either way, it seems that the boy
and his dancing bear just cannot be
accepted everywhere. And that leads
us to question that wonderful line,
“It’s just amazing how fair people can
be.” ✦

• Higher blanket dollar limits.
INGAA, in its comments, urged FERC
to adopt temporary cost limits previously established in response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita: $16 million for
automatic projects and $50 million for
prior notice projects. NGSA now agrees
that the limits should govern access to
blanket procedures, subject to the index
proposed in the NOPR.
• Notification provisions. NGSA objected
to FERC’s proposal to extend a protest deadline to 60 days from 45 days.
INGAA did not object to the 60-day
protest limit, subject to the increased
cost limits it proposed, but did object
to the proposal to increase landowner
notice of construction to 45 days from
30 days for automatic authorization
projects. The associations now consider
both notification proposals ill-advised
and urged FERC to reconsider the need
for increased notification.
• Automatic processing. Both associations supported FERC’s proposals to
open mainline and some LNG-related projects to prior notice blanket
proceedings. But they also urged the
commission to go further and allow
blanket certification of new takeaway
lateral facilities to connect existing
LNG terminals with existing pipelines.
INGAA also urged FERC to remove a
proposed restriction on allowing automatic processing of mainline and LNGrelated facilities that meet whatever
cost criteria are adopted. NGSA now
agrees with INGAA that these proposed
restrictions aren’t necessary.
• Environmental conditions. INGAA said
that some of FERC’s proposed new
environmental regulations were ill-advised for several reasons, a position that
NGSA now supports.
Horvath and Santa’s letter to Kelliher
came nearly 2 weeks after the American
Public Gas Association questioned the
necessity of revising blanket certificate regulations for gas infrastructure
projects.
APGA, which represents municipal
and other publicly owned local distribution companies, said in comments
filed Sept. 6 that the Natural Gas Act’s

passed similar legislation.
“The administration and Interior Department have opposed this

oil companies to come back to the

actors.”
Scarlett said, “The administration
has significant concerns about manda-

tory renegotiation. These contracts, like
all contracts, reside at the bedrock of

important that we uphold their sanctity
so the federal government can be seen

“Simply shining a light on this is

which report record profits, to come

warned that Congress might have to

DOT proposes extending low-pressure oil pipeline rules
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
The US Department of Transportation
has proposed stiffened safety requirements, including cleaning and continuous monitoring, for more than 1,200
miles of crude oil and product pipelines.
If adopted, the regulations would
place another 684 miles of domestic onshore oil pipelines, primarily
operated by major firms, under federal
regulation. Comments will be accepted
for 60 days following the Aug. 31 announcement.
The department’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration
(PHMSA) was already preparing the
proposed rules when leaks were discovered late last winter in BP Exploration
(Alaska) Inc.’s crude oil gathering lines
at Prudhoe Bay oil field in Alaska.
PHMSA issued orders to the company to more closely monitor and maintain the low-pressure system on Mar. 2,
which it later amended with additional
requirements. Meanwhile, the company
found and identified leaks elsewhere in
its Prudhoe Bay system and announced
that it would have to cut as much as
200,000 b/d of shipments while repairs were made.
Three congressional committees
scheduled hearings this month on the
leaks and subsequent system shutdowns,
starting with the House Energy and Com32

merce Committee on Sept. 5 and continuing with the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee on Sept. 12 and the
House Transportation and Infrastructure
Committee on Sept. 13.
Acting Transportation Sec. Martha
Cino said the proposed regulations
would require operators of low-pressure pipelines at Prudhoe Bay and other
unusually sensitive areas to meet requirements similar to the ones PHMSA
applies to high-pressure pipelines.
“This rule will help restore confidence in America’s pipelines,” she said,
adding that it would have prevented
maintenance lapses that led to BP’s partial system shutdown in Alaska.

Existing regulations
PHMSA already regulates gathering
lines in populated areas and in rural
areas of Gulf of Mexico inlets. It also
regulates low-stress lines in populated areas or that cross commercially
navigable waterways, as well as any line
carrying hazardous liquids.
The agency decided that additional
onshore low-stress pipelines in rural
areas, which were exempted when the
original regulations were formulated in
2000, needed to be included after leaks
were reported.
It received a set of proposals from
the American Petroleum Institute and
the Association of Oil Pipelines in July.
Their recommendations included leak

detection measures appropriate to each
pipeline, employee training for abnormal operating events, well-marked
routes, more programs to reduce the
chance of excavation damage, and
prompt reporting of incidents.
Other proposals recommended establishing a 5-mile buffer zone separating low-pressure oil pipelines from
public drinking water sources and a
1-mile buffer from an environmentally
sensitive area. PHMSA rejected the idea,
proposing a 1⁄4-mile buffer instead after
its data showed the largest onshore spill
from an oil pipeline traveled no farther
than 2 acres.
The proposed regulations would
cover oil pipelines between 65⁄8 and 85⁄8
in. in diameter operating above 20%
of specified minimum yield strength
(SMYS) in areas designated “unusually
sensitive.” The proposals noted that a
pressure of 125 psig approximates 20%
SMYS for steel pipe of unknown stress
level, based on minimum weight pipe
8 in. in nominal diameter with 24,000
psi yield strength.
DOT and PHMSA are seeking comments within 60 days on whether the
proposed pressures and buffer zone are
adequate.

Primary threats
The proposals also focus on corrosion and third-party excavation damage
as the primary threats to rural oil pipeOil & Gas Journal / Sept. 25, 2006

line integrity. Operators would have to continuously
monitor systems, but DOT and PHMSA are seeking
comments on a proposal to require low-pressure line
operators to submit the annual reports and accident
reports PHMSA makes other oil pipeline operators
prepare.
The proposed regulations would cost an estimated
$5 million initially, $2 million/year from the second
through seventh years and $1 million/year after the
seventh year, DOT said in its proposed rulemaking
notice.
It said that PHMSA determined that smaller independent producers would not be affected following consultations with the Independent Petroleum
Association of America and the US Small Business
Administration.
The Pipeline Safety Trust immediately called DOT’s
proposals inadequate because they would apply to
only 17% of the currently unregulated low-pressure
oil pipelines nationwide.
Carl Weimer, executive director of the Bellingham,
Wash.-based nonprofit organization, said PHMSA pushed
the proposals out “presumably to avoid uncomfortable,
ongoing questions by Congress and the media.”
He called them “so technically deficient [with]
such narrow pipeline coverage that uncomfortable
questions to PHMSA need to continue.” He said,
“Contrary to a statement in the proposal, the rule will
not improve public confidence in pipeline safety since
the agency has continued to exempt the vast majority
of these types of problem pipelines.”

Shipments rise
Meanwhile, BP Exploration Alaska reported on
Aug. 29 that shipments through its Prudhoe Bay
gathering system were back above 200,000 b/d following completion of repairs to its Gathering Center
2 compressor. It also said it has found no additional
integrity problems after completing ultrasonic
inspections of about 2,500 ft of pipe in the Eastern
Operating Area and 5,300 ft of pipe in the Western
Operating Area.
While more than 15,000 ft of insulation has been
stripped from eastern-area oil transit lines, BP Exploration Alaska said it temporarily stopped removing
insulation from the western-area lines because it contains asbestos. The line will continue to operate while it
evaluates possible worker exposure problems, it said.
The company has completed orders for 16 miles of
replacement pipeline, which it expects to receive from
US mills during 2006’s fourth quarter. BP’s West Coast

Aramco head says technology
is key to boosting reserves
For the oil industry to continue meeting its longterm responsibility of providing energy to the world
economies, it needs to continue to identify new oil
fields, said Saudi Aramco Pres. and Chief Executive
Abdallah S. Jum’ah.
This is just one of “five technology targets” critical
for the industry to maintain its obligation, said Jum’ah
during a panel discussion on technology and future energy supplies at the Third OPEC International Seminar.
He believes that industry professionals could find
trillions of additional barrels of producible potential through continued technological advances, and
challenges the industry to add 1 trillion bbl of oil to
world reserves over the next quarter-century.
The second technology target is to increase oil
recovery rates from known fields. Over the next
25 years, increasing incremental recovery rates for
existing fields by 20% is feasible, Jum’ah said. This
would add another trillion barrels of oil to the world’s
reserves base, he said.
Jum’ah said the third technology target—reducing exploration and production costs—would turn
prospects that were previously uneconomically viable
into attractive investment opportunities.
Target four is development of unconventional oil resources. Jum’ah said extra-heavy oil, tar sands, and bitumen account for about 4.7 trillion bbl of oil in-place,
which is already being exploited. Other unconventional
sources include oil shales, which Jum’ah said pose even
more thorny challenges, but with the potential for over
2.5 trillion bbl of oil cannot be ignored.
The fifth technology target underscored each of the
other four and concerns lightening the environmental
footprint of the industry’s activities and of its products, Jum’ah said.
He added that if technology is not turned toward the
environmental issue with as much urgency as it is toward
exploration and production challenges, the oil industry
could find itself with fewer places to look for energy.
In light of these technology targets, Jum’ah said
that he believes about 2 trillion bbl can be added from
yet-to-be-discovered fields and increased recovery
rates over the next 25 years. And 1.5 trillion bbl can
be extracted from nonconventional sources using current technology. Add these, he said, to the 1.2 trillion
bbl of current proven reserves, and the total potential
is for over 4.5 trillion bbl.
“That number,” Jum’ah said, “translates into more
than 140 years of supply at today’s current rate of
consumption.” ✦

Rising confidence in discovering and
producing oil and gas from deep Lower
Tertiary formations in the deepwater
Gulf of Mexico could make a large but
costly impact on US reserves, Devon
Energy Corp. said in early September.
Even with the play still in its infancy,
industry is estimating that it might ultimately recover 9-15 billion bbl of oil
equivalent. US proved crude oil reserves

discoveries in 19 wells drilled in the
trend for a 63% geologic success rate
(Fig. 1, Table 1).
Devon, which holds interests in 273
blocks in the Lower Tertiary trend, plans
to participate in or drill at least 19 other
prospects in the next 3-5 years that have
a combined 2-5 billion boe in unrisked
exploration potential (Fig. 2).

Extended test

Chevron, Devon, and Statoil ASA just
completed the only extended well test
of a Lower Tertiary well to date. The
Jack-2 well in Walker Ridge Block 758
sustained flow rates of more than 6,000
b/d of oil from 40% of the total measured net pay of more than 350 ft.

More than 99% of Gulf of Mexico
production has come from Tertiary
Pleistocene, Pliocene, and Miocene formations. As recently as the early 2000s,
few observers believed that the Lower
Tertiary sands would be present or productive at great depths, Devon noted.

String of discoveries
Chevron and partners made the
initial Jack field discovery in September
2004.
The extended drillstem test took
place in the second quarter of 2006 at
Jack-2, an appraisal well drilled in 2005
that encountered thicker net pay than
the discovery well.
The four discovery wells in which
Devon has participated—Cascade, Jack,
Kaskida, and St. Malo—went to total
depths of 27,929 ft to 32,500 ft. They
are in 5,800-8,200 ft of water.
Demonstrating the play’s relatively
early stage, Cascade, Jack, and St. Malo
are the only three of the 12 industry
discoveries to have more than a single
penetration, Devon said.
Kaskida, on Keathley Canyon Block
292, cut more than 800 ft of net hydrocarbon-bearing sands (OGJ Online,
Aug. 31, 2006). It may be the best of
industry’s 12 discoveries so far in the
play, Devon said.
Devon initially held 20-25% working interests in the four discoveries, but

are remote from oil pipelines.
Early-stage figures on field development costs are $80-120 million/well
plus as much as $1.3-1.5 billion for
subsea facilities, Devon said.
Near-term plans are to appraise
Kaskida in late 2006, drill more appraisal wells on Jack and St. Malo in
2007, and obtain formal approval of the

Cascade deepwater operating plan.
Cascade, leading candidate to become the first Lower Tertiary trend field
to be placed on production, went to
TD 27,929 ft in 8,143 ft of water on
Walker Ridge Block 206.
Chevron noted that it is the largest lease holder in the deepwater Gulf
of Mexico and in the emerging Lower
Tertiary trend. ✦

Tigris prospect in Block 26 underlying
Souedieh oil and gas field. The vertical
well is projected to 4,500 m.
Tigris-1 will be the second well to
penetrate the Carboniferous and Devonian aged reservoirs on the structure,
said 50% partner Emerald Energy PLC,
London. Syrian Petroleum Co.’s S1100
well 1 km northeast of Tigris-1 found
a substantial hydrocarbon column in
1994, according to independent interpretation of wireline logs.

The Ministry of Mines, Energy and
Water launched a late 2006 bid round
by reoffering two land and two deepwater blocks.
Coastal blocks A and B and deepwater blocks 5 and 6 are in the Benin
coastal sedimentary basin. Bid deadline
is Nov. 30, 2006.

Gambia
Buried Hill Energy (Cyprus) PLC,
London, said its Gambia subsidiary
entered into 30-year licenses on the
A1 Alhamdulilah and A4 blocks in the
Atlantic off Gambia.
The acreage, separated from Mauritania by the Senegalese coast, is considered to have high potential for discoveries, the company said.

Kazakhstan
Big Sky Energy Corp., Calgary, said
its Kazakh subsidiary plans 3-month

The survey, with BP America Inc.
as the primary financial and technical partner, will cover 401 deepwater
blocks in the Garden Banks, Keathley
Canyon, Green Canyon, and Walker
Ridge areas. The project has above-average prefunding for the Gulf of Mexico,
PGS said.
The Ramform Viking and two other
vessels will use state-of-the-art wide

The government awarded Tullow
Oil PLC, London, operated interests in
the Shallow-water and Deepwater Tano
blocks along the marine boundary with
Ivory Coast. Tullow took a farmout to
acquire a 22.9% interest in the adjacent

West Cape Three Points offshore license.
Its other interests are 85.5% in the Shallow-water Tano block and 49.95% in
Deepwater Tano.
The company, which sees Albian and
Upper Cretaceous potential on the Tano
blocks, will try to commercialize one or
more of three undeveloped oil and gas
discoveries on Shallow-water Tano.
The three licenses are in the Greater
Ivoirian basin on trend with Espoir oil
and gas field off Ivory Coast, in which
Tullow holds 21.33% interest.

Producing zone is Cretaceous
Rodessa at 10,498-508 ft.
The well is to be produced on a

benefit of 3D seismic data or advanced
drilling and fracturing techniques,
TXCO said.
Meanwhile, TXCO is refurbishing a

Athabasca, Peace River,
and Cold Lake (Fig. 1).
Together, these three areas cover about 54,000
sq miles.
Some companies,
such as Petro-Canada,
have established thermal in situ oil
sands production and are partners in
surface-minable projects already and
have additional projects planned for
their lease holdings using either more
thermal in situ, such as steam-assisted
gravity drainage (SAGD), or surface
mining. Other companies without current bitumen production, such as North
American Oil Sands Corp., have in the
last few years leased large amounts of
acreage and have plans to start bitumen
production, also with SAGD.
Recent entrants to the area include
Korea National Oil Corp., South Korea’s
state-owned oil company, which recently bought in the Cold Lake region
the Blackgold Mine from US-based
Newmont Mining Corp. and has plans
to produce about 35,000 b/d for 25
years, starting in 2010 with SAGD.
Some in situ projects produce bitumen through primary pumping methods, but most projects require thermal
stimulation to recover the bitumen.
Cyclic steam injection and SAGD are the
most common thermal methods.
Also because of the high cost of
natural gas, various companies have
ongoing pilots and research projects for

projects include
five distinct SAGD
facilities and four
smaller satellite
hubs. Each hub
will have a central processing facility for
steam generation and bitumen processing and several phases of well development, as is typical for most SAGD
projects, that will maintain each facility
at capacity for the life of the projects.
North American plans a stepped
development program that starts with
10,000 bo/d production from the
Leimer lease in 2008-10 (Fig. 4).
Its two-phase upgrader program
will allow production from the other
leases to reach 80,000 b/d in 2011
and 160,000 b/d by 2015. Phase 1 of
the upgrader will include coking and
hydrotreating, Phase 2 will include coking, hydroprocessing, and coke gasification (Fig. 5).
As with most upgraders, the upgrader will process the extra-heavy crude
into refinery-ready synthetic crude oil
that can be processed into gasoline,
diesel, and other fuels. North American plans to locate the upgrader near
Edmonton to allow easy access markets
for the products.
Langley said the company has
delineated its leases with 121 wells
boreholes and uses a 15-m cut off to
determine producing formation. He
expects recovery factors from the leases
of 40-50%, based on results from established nearby SAGD projects.
North American also will test
solvents to see if they improve SAGD

Refining

According to a report from the
Centre for Global Energy Studies
(CGES), the global crude supply barrel
got heavier during 2000-04. The July
5, 2006, report entitled “Global Oil
Report: Market Watch—Trends in crude
oil quality” said that increased amounts
of heavier crudes would make their way
to refiners in the coming years.
The crude supply barrel has changed
substantially since
2000, according to a
2005 OPEC report.1
That report concluded that there is currently a “mismatch
between the installed
refinery capacity and
crude type.” The CGES report examines
in detail the changes that have occurred
to the crude stream coming to market
during the last 5 years.

creased 10%.
According to the report, the shift in
crude gravity was due to:
• Growth in heavy, sour crude
production that reflects increases in Canadian bitumen and output from Chad,
Brazil, Ecuador, and Mexico.
• Growth of medium-API sour crude
production that mainly reflects the
increased output of Russian Urals (33°
API with 1.3% sulfur).
• Other contributors to the growth
in medium-API crude include Angola,
Canada (syncrude), Equatorial Guinea,
and Sudan, although all of this was
actually low-sulfur crude.
• The net loss in light API, sweet
crude is due to declines in OECD oil
production mainly in the North Sea,
Australia, Canada, and US, as well as in
Colombia. The only two countries that
showed a significant net increase in
light crude production were Kazakhstan

C HANGE IN OPEC PRODUCTION, 2000-04
Production increase, million b/d

OPEC member states dropped to 6%
from 9%, while the share of light crude
increased to 32% from 30% of supply
in 2004 (Fig. 2).
In volume terms, OPEC’s production
of light crude increased by 0.9 million
b/d and of medium gravity crude by 1
million b/d from 2000 to 2004, while
production of heavy crude fell by close
to 0.8 million b/d, according to the
report.
The increase in OPEC’s light oil
production reflects rising output from
Algeria and Libya. The decline in heavy
oil production is due to a drop in output
in Venezuela (Fig. 3).
CGES’s analysis of OPEC’s production
figures indicates that these production
patterns held through 2005.
More recently, incremental OPEC
output, which has averaged slightly
more than 850,000 b/d/year during
2004-05, has been dominated by Saudi
Arabia, which has boosted its oil production to around 9.5 million b/d. OPEC
oil production in 2005 again consisted
predominantly of light and medium
grades, but the remaining spare production capacity, which is almost entirely
concentrated in Saudi Arabia, is much
heavier.
According to the report, until new
capacity is brought on stream, which
is taking place but relatively slowly,
any incremental OPEC output will be
predominantly heavy oil. The rise in the
quality of OPEC supply is therefore insufficient to offset the declining quality
of non-OPEC supplies.
Total OPEC and non-OPEC heavy-oil
production for 2000-04 increased by
0.7 million b/d, output of medium
grade crude increased nearly 5 million
b/d, and the production of light crude
declined 0.9 million b/d. This trend
towards heavier crude oil production
will continue in the short and medium
term, according to CGES.

making up 43% and heavy crude the
remaining 8%. “This seems a positive
step in view of what the market wants,”
according to the report. “But again it is
important to take into account both the
change occurring in the non-OPEC barrel over the same period and the relative
amounts of oil brought to the market
by the two groups of producers.”
OPEC forecasts that light crude will
account for just 16% of non-OPEC’s capacity expansion 2005-06. Most of the
growth, 62%, will come from medium
crudes, while heavy oil will make up
the remaining 22%, further changing
the overall make-up of the non-OPEC
supply barrel (Fig. 4). OPEC estimates
its own crude oil capacity expansion
2005-06 at 2.1 million b/d, while predicting that non-OPEC oil production

would increase 1.7 million b/d during
the same time, a forecast that now looks
overly optimistic.
The report states that—looking at the
breakdown of OPEC’s predicted oil-production capacity expansion by all producers over the short term—it is important to note that 65% of incremental
production will come from medium
and heavy crudes. In the medium term,
medium crude will to continue to provide most of the non-OPEC production
growth (Fig. 5), with the FSU (Russia,
Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan), West Africa
(Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Chad,
and Mauritania), Brazil, and Canadian
syncrude all expected to contribute to
non-OPEC output growth.
Offsetting some of these output
increases is the decline in production of

The statistical uncertainty in the estimation
of the average failure rate
of a group of pipelines
decreases as failures, kmPipelines
years, or both increase.
This fact has led to the
tendency in pipeline reliability analyses
to increase the number of km-years
from which the failure data are pooled,
reducing statistical uncertainty associated with estimating the failure rate.
This approach, however, is only
valid if the uncertainty arising from the
physical, environmental, and maintenance differences between pipeline
systems is negligible.1
Oil and gas pipeline systems encompass many failure mechanisms, the
most common being corrosion metal
loss, third-party damage, geotechnical
hazard, hydrogen-assisted and stresscorrosion cracking, and construction or
material imperfections.2 These failure
mechanisms can lead to ultimate failure
modes, such as rupture and leakage.
Tolerance uncertainty describes the
statistical errors that arise from merging inhomogeneous pipeline failure
datasets. Pipeline failure-rate estimation,
however, has consistently ignored tolerance uncertainty. A reliability methodology that allows estimating the pipeline
population-failure rate together with
the statistical and tolerance uncertainties associated with the estimate would
yield more accurate results. A key
element of this methodology should
be the ability to establish whether the
pipeline systems are similar enough
to allow pooling of failure data across
systems.
This article proposes such a methodology. This methodology holds particular utility when, rather than relying on
average values, the failure rate needs
to be estimated accurately from data
gathered for multiple pipeline systems
showing significant physical, environmental, and maintenance differences. It
allows for addressing failure processes

Conference, Calgary, Sept. 25-29, 2006.

with constant or varying intensity and
testing whether the pipeline systems
are similar enough so that pooling
failure data across them can reduce the
statistical uncertainty in the failure rate
estimation.
Current pipeline reliability analyses
tend to increase the number of kmyears from which the failure data are
gathered with the purpose of reducing
statistical uncertainty. This might lead
pipeline operators to establish improper
maintenance priorities due to the large
tolerance uncertainty associated with
pooling failure data across dissimilar
pipeline systems. This article intends
to raise awareness of this problem and
provide pipeline reliability analysts with
the methods to address it properly.
Part 1, presented here, offers the new
methodology for estimating failure rates
of a pipeline population from historical failure data pooled across pipeline
systems based on the statistical methods
for the reliability of repairable systems.
Pipelines are repairable systems since,
upon failure, they can be restored to
operation by some repair process other
than total replacement.3 4 Part 2 will
outline and illustrate this methodology
using real failure data compiled by the
Office of Pipeline Data from oil and gas
pipeline systems in southern Mexico
and the US.

Basic deﬁnitions
This article treats pipelines as repairable systems. The term pipeline system
refers to a group of pipelines that can
be modeled by the same point stochastic process to describe the occurrence
of failures in time. A pipeline system,
therefore, is a repairable system with repairable subsystems (pipelines) that can
all be described by the same process.
This allows assessment of tolerance
uncertainty from system-to-system
only when failure data are mixed to
estimate a generic failure rate for the
pipeline population. The totality of the
pipeline systems used to carry out such
estimation comprises a sample of the
population under investigation. Fig. 1 illustrates some defining system variables

This approach gives the system with
the longer observation period the number 1.5 The probability that the system
experiences N1 (Texp) – 1 failures or less
determines the probability that system
1 experiences N1 (Texp) or more failures
over the observation period Texp. The
total number of failures in the two systems, NT, and the sum of the logarithm
of the failure times, S, condition these
probabilities (Equation 19).5
Equation 19 says the larger the Ρˆ
value, the smaller the significant level
with which the null hypothesis
H0: λ1 = λ2 can be rejected. If the
hypothesis is not rejected, the intensity
function of the two systems corresponds to the same power law, allowing the data gathered for both systems
to be unified and modeled through
a unique non-homogeneous Poisson
process with a power-law intensity
function.
The k pipelines case investigates the
null hypothesis H0: β1 = β2 = ... = βk
against the alternative hypothesis that at
least two of the coefficients are different.3 Equation 20 provides a likelihood
ratio statistic which can perform this
investigation as a χ2 distribution with
(k – 1) degrees of freedom.
Equation 9 calculatesk the estimates
βˆ i, where NT (Texp) = ∑ Ni (Texp) is
the total number of failures for the k
systems over the observation time and
the coefficients β*i are the weighted
harmonic mean of the βˆ i(Equation 21).
The chosen significance level α
when LRK > χ2α (k – 1) allows for the
rejection of the hypothesis that the
coefficients βi are equal.
Rejecting the null hypothesis prohibits the failure data collected for the k
systems from being merged. If there is
no evidence to reject the null hypothesis, one can investigate if the failure
rate λi of the k systems is similar. Testing
the null hypothesis H0: λ1 = λ2 = ... = λk
against the alternative hypothesis that at
least two of the systems show different
failure rates tests the equality of the λi.
Equation 22 can perform this test.5
Equation 22 shows an χ2 distribution
with (k – 1) degrees of freedom when
i=1

72

the total number of failures in the k systems over the observation time is large
(N (Texp) ≥ 30). Once computed, the
hypothesis that λ1 = λ2 = ... = λk can be
rejected at a significant level, α, when d̂
> χ2α (k – 1).
Not rejecting the hypothesis that
the βi and λi’s are similar for the k
systems allows the failure data to be
pooled across these systems to produce
a generic failure rate with a reduced
statistical uncertainty.

New fouling control technology aids reﬁnery operations
New Milestone heater fouling control
technology helps increase refinery profitability by significantly reducing delayed
coker heater tube fouling rates.
The technology is a multicomponent
fouling control solution designed to interrupt the key fouling mechanisms identified for specific coker heater operations
and feedstock types.
Milestone technology programs can
improve refinery profitability by:
• Increasing delayed coker unit
throughput where throughput is limited
by heater capacity.
• Allowing upstream crude units to
process higher rates of lower-cost heavy
crude oils.
• Reducing coil decoking costs.
• Reducing heater fuel consumption.
The firm says its fouling control approach has been proved effective in a joint
Iindustry project pilot scale delayed coker
testing program. Recent applications of
MILESTONE technology in several com-

mercial delayed cokers have significantly
extended heater run lengths and increased
unit throughputs, while reducing the frequency and cost of coil decoking procedures, the company says.

CONFERENCE
MANAGEMENT CONTACTS

Independent operators are playing a vital role in oil and gas exploration and
production, and their increased participation in the international E&P arena has
created information needs particular to that group.

However, there are as many financial opportunities challenges as there are technical
challenges for independent operators. The savvy operator needs to know how to
assess the turbulent waters of international oil and gas exploration, what to look
out for, and where to go for the best advice.

Reserves numbers
aren’t oil’s only
market perplexity
Numbers about the oil and gas market
aren’t always what they seem to be.
It’s forever disturbing, for example, to
see elaborate arithmetic performed with
reserves data.
Nobody can measure oil and gas reserves. The numbers are estimates based
on interpretation—often quite a lot of interpretation—of sparse data about indirect indicators like well and seismic information.

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

Yet people who don’t know better see
numbers and assume they represent measurements, as if from some geophysical
dipstick. Reserves aren’t measurable and
probably won’t be anytime soon.
Even market factors that are, unlike
reserves, at least theoretically measurable
can be just as difﬁcult in the vast, complex,
and politically inﬂuenced oil and gas business. In its Oil Market Report this month,
the International Energy Agency discusses
vagaries of numbers representing global oil
supply and demand, which of course play
no small role in determining oil prices.
IEA calls attention to a category in its
monthly oil-balance table called “miscellaneous to balance.”
This is the rubber ruler of petroleum
economics, an important tenet of which is
that supply and demand always balance,
net of inventory changes, at some price. The
numbers, though, never add up.
The problem isn’t the theory but rather
the myriad measurements in the equation. Some of them turn out to be nearly
as reliant as reserves are on estimation
and interpretation. Into this category fall
such vital numbers as Chinese demand and
inventories outside industrialized countries.
IEA addressed the difﬁculty in its report
because the miscellaneous number reached
a hefty 1.3 million b/d in the second quarter.
In addition to the timing disparities and
fuzzy-number areas that always bedevil oil
balances, IEA said, the growth category of
ethanol and biodiesel demand has become
a challenge. And many countries still won’t
publish important data.
Adjusting for estimated errors in the uncertain categories brings the miscellaneous
fudge factor down to 300,000-400,000 b/d.
That, IEA says, allows analysis to focus
on fundamental issues: economic growth,
tight diesel and jet-fuel markets, hurricane
threats, and geopolitical and project-completion risks.
Just don’t forget that the adjustments,
no matter how carefully estimated they
might be, still can be wrong.

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

Natural gas futures price hits 2-year low
Natural gas futures fell below $5/MMbtu Sept. 14 to the lowest level in 2 years
on the New York market after the US Energy Information Administration reported a
large leap in US gas storage.
EIA reported the injection of 108 bcf of gas into US underground storage during
the week ended Sept. 8 (OGJ Online, Sept. 14, 2006). That was the ﬁrst triple-digit increase since June 3, 2005, up substantially from 71 bcf the previous week and 89 bcf
during the same period a year ago. Gas injections normally increase during the week
of the US Labor Day holiday—this year on Sept. 4—when power plants’ demand for
gas is curtailed because of closed ofﬁces and factories.
That brought total US gas storage above 3 tcf, up 339 bcf from the same period
last year and 341 bcf above the 5-year average. It also was the earliest time by 2
weeks that US gas storage passed the 3 tcf mark, said analysts at Enerfax Daily.
“Mild weather since the start of August decreased power plant demand for natural
gas and let storage caverns ﬁll quickly,” they said.
In a separate report, analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc., said, “It now appears as if we are going to test full storage, which means
more volatility and the chance of gas-on-gas competition likely. This will lower prices
in certain regions until producers start shutting in when no more injections in the
system are possible.”
Raymond James analysts said, “Historically, we have never seen higher than 3.4
tcf in storage, and we estimate that the most that can go in is approximately 3.5 tcf.
If storage continues this build and we start the year with unprecedented levels, this
may have a meaningful impact on ‘resetting’ forces in 2007.
The October gas contract fell 55.7¢ to $4.89/MMbtu Sept. 14 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, but regained 9¢ in the next session.
OPEC outlook
As expected, ministers of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
made no changes in their ofﬁcial production quota during a brief meeting Sept. 11 in
Vienna. But that lack of action did not signal “simple maintenance of the status quo,”
said Paul Horsnell at Barclays Capital Inc., London.
Statements issued by OPEC at the end of previous meetings “explicitly expressed
a commitment to the 28 million b/d target ceiling or clearly stated that ministers had
chosen to maintain the status quo,” Horsnell noted. But there was no such message
in September. Instead, Horsnell perceived “a signal that [OPEC] output will fall further if needed, without necessarily having to make explicit short-term changes in the
target ceiling.” Horsnell said, “Indeed, combine the lack of commitment to the ceiling
with the observations made in the communiqué ﬁrst that supply exceeds demand,
and second that OPEC will balance supply and demand, and there is the strong implication that actual output cuts are a base case unless prices rebound.
“The line is being drawn not very far below current price levels, if not at current
price levels. While prices in the $70s were not going to be proactively defended, the
$60s are a different proposition,” Horsnell said.
The primary topic at the meeting “was clearly the determination of a price ﬂoor,
below which OPEC should cut its production,” said Frederic Lasserre, head of commodities research at the Societe Generale (SG) corporate investment-banking group.
He said, “The organization is more worried by the short-term prospects than by the
medium-term ones. For instance, the Saudi oil minister conﬁrms 2007 oil demand
prospects remain very positive despite the expected slowdown in the US and world
economic growth while the OPEC president had to remind [members] the organization does not have any ofﬁcial ﬂoor to defend.”
Lasserre said, “Since OPEC has ofﬁcially abandoned any ofﬁcial price band, the
debate on the ﬂoor has been useless as the market has been more or less a one-way
market. Over the last 2 years, the key concern was more the price level [that] would
damage the world economy. From time to time, isolated comments from some
members indicated that this ﬂoor was more or less ‘around $50/bbl’ (based on the
OPEC basket which is trading now at a discount of $2.70/bbl to Brent ICE). At that
time, SG agreed this level would be appropriate to both ﬁnance future production
without damaging demand.”
OPEC said it would reassess market conditions at its next meeting Dec. 14 in
Nigeria. Both the International Energy Agency in Paris and the US Department of Energy reduced their forecasts of world demand for crude this year in separate reports
Sept. 12.

Q:

Egypt is a significant oil and gas
producer in the Middle East
and Africa, and is fast exceeding its own
expectations for reserves. What can you tell
us about the real estimates of reserves?
A: The country’s oil production has
tapered off over the past two decades despite
the challenges facing crude oil production
and also as a result of the natural decline
in production from the mature fields
discovered in the 60’s and 70’s. The Ministry
of Petroleum succeeded in maintaining its
production levels with a minimum decline
rate over the last five years and we currently
sit at a little under 700,000 bpd of oil and
condensate production.

Special thanks to Daniel Bernard of Oil and
Gas Journal and to the staff of the
magazine for their support and cooperation.

Today, proven oil and condensate reserves
stand at 3.7 billion barrels. Proven gas
reserves reached 67 trillion cubic feet (tcf) at
the closing of our last calendar year. There
also exist an additional 100-120 tcf of
potential reserves (according to the studies
of international companies operating in
Egypt that is compatible with a recent study
done by a major reputable international
consultant). This study focused on petroleum
potential and the future expectations for
international offshore reserves. The study
reached the distinctive conclusion that
Egypt occupies the 2nd place in the total
estimates of gas reserves in deep-water,
offshore worldwide.
Q: Demand for petroleum products has
been relatively flat since 1999 (largely due to
the increased use of natural gas). What are
Egypt’s expectations in terms of exploration?
A: Intensive exploration and production
activities are on-going, at about over 30% of
Egypt’s total area. There are 58 international
and private companies currently operating
through more than 102 concession agreements

including major international companies
such as BP, BG, ENI, Shell, Apache and
Petronas, amongst others.
During the last two years about 63
agreements and amendments were signed
with financial commitments reaching
$2,188,130 billion and with the drilling of
more than 258 wells. This significant number
of agreements reflects the willingness of IOC
to invest in Egypt for its significant potential
in the oil and gas sector and for the
discoveries achieved in the last few years
(especially in the Mediterranean, Nile Delta
and Western desert). Exploration activities
are currently directed for new frontier areas in
the Red Sea, Upper Egypt and Western Desert
and offshore in the Western portion of the
Mediterranean deep-water area.
In addition to the above, a new holding
company called “GANOPE” was formed in
2003 following the Ministry of Petroleum’s
strategy to enhance exploration activities in
the Upper Egypt area and has since
succeeded by offering three rounds of
bidding. It has also announced the fourth
round of bidding and has made great
progress in attracting companies to explore
within its vast territory. It has awarded
seven blocks in the Upper Egypt and the
Red Sea area and the first exploratory well
will be drilled before the end of this year.
Q: What are the output perspectives in
Egypt’s four traditional areas; the Gulf of
Suez (about 50%), the Western Desert, the
Eastern Desert and the Sinai Peninsula?
A: Of the country’s most known producing
regions, the Gulf of Suez, is synonymous
with being mainly an oil rich area, and
despite the fact that production in the area is
on the decline, international and national oil
companies have not yet given up hope on

Q: Offshore oil production
possibilities in the Mediterranean
are beginning to be explored; can
you please expand on this?
A: Due to extensive exploration
activities all over the country,
especially in the deep and ultra-deep
water of the Mediterranean (as well as
onshore the Nile Delta and Western
Desert last year) several gas discoveries
were achieved. We expect to increase
these discoveries as we are offering
additional bidding rounds every
year through several entities: EGPC,
EGAS and GANOPE. Furthermore,
offshore Mediterranean is achieving
a phenomena record of successful
drilling. Recently, oil was discovered

European standards and also satisfy local
demands. Once achieved, we can also export
the surplus to international markets. In
2005, the company successfully exported
1.65 million tons of high-octane gasoline and
jet fuel with a total value of about one billion
dollars (US). Our list of exporters include:

It is set to be one of the top 20 complexes
in the world. It consists of eight main projects
namely; a sophisticated refinery for the
production of high quality gas-oil, unleaded
gasoline, naphtha and kerosene. In addition,
there are another five projects that would
produce ethylene and polyethylene, propylene
and poly-propylene, styrene and
aromatics. There is also a project for
power and steam generation and
another for transportation and storage
utilities. Estimated total investment
of the projects is approximately 9.5
billion $US with a capacity of
350,000 bbl/d. This huge complex is
expected to create about 100,000 job
opportunities during its construction
and implementation phases, which is
considered in itself an added economic
value and the implementation of the
complex will take around five years.

making further oil discoveries. For example,
in 2003 the largest oil discovery was made to
date with proven oil reserves about 80
mmbbls and an expected rate of 45,000 bpd
after field development. Additionally in 2004,
there was another major discovery in the
offshore area by the National Company with
proven reserves up to 60 mmbbls oil,
(currently the field was producing
about 15,000 bpd with the potential
to produce 30,000 bpd with full field
development.)

Q: What will be the political and
economic criteria for conceding
exploration blocks in the near future?

A: The Ministry of Petroleum
restructured the oil sector establishing
new specialized entities for oil, gas
and petrochemicals (EGAS, ECHEM
and GANOPE in addition to EGPC)
to speed up the decision-making
process and focus on growing
activities in the gas and petrochemical
sectors, as well as further extend the
oil and gas activities in Upper Egypt.

Egypt’s Petroleum Future

Egypt’s petroleum future:
Critical assets and well-defined plans will
add value to large resources

T

o keep pace with the relentless growth
in global energy demand in the decades
ahead, it will be necessary to find, develop and
use more oil and gas more efficiently, and with
less impact on the environment.
Meeting tomorrow’s energy demand will
require a complex array of talents and assets.
Adequate oil and gas resources coupled with
convenient access to both raw materials and
markets will be critical advantages in
tomorrow’s competitive global energy
marketplace.
Just as important, the leaders that emerge to
take up the challenge will be those nations and
corporations that encourage innovation, offer
attractive investment opportunities and strive
to improve living standards for all citizens.
For decades, Egypt has taken advantage
of its strategic location to build an important
link in the chain that connects large oil
reserves with markets around the world. In
the last decade, it has begun to implement a
long term strategy to add value to its own
considerable natural gas resources by
building a strong export prominence and a
world-class petrochemical industry.
Egypt’s participation in the critical
transportation infrastructure built around the
Suez Canal and the Suez Mediterranean
(Sumed) pipeline is one of the country’s most
important physical assets. Egypt’s late President
Saddat saw the pipeline as a strategic project
and together with the Canal, the two now
transfer around 98% of Arabian Gulf crude oil
to the Mediterranean.
In addition to its ongoing role as a leading
global oil transportation hub, Egypt also has:
• An aggressive exploration effort underway
to further define its natural gas resource,
much of which lies in deep water
• A Master Plan to develop its petrochemical
industry and expand natural gas and liquefied
natural gas (LNG) exports
• A reputation as a politically stable,
investment-friendly country with a long history

of partnering with international companies
of all types
• A focus on environmental responsibility
that embraces both operations within Egypt
and the products it produces for consumers
around the world

During the last fiscal year, 77 exploration
wells resulted in 38 oil and five gas discoveries
that added 196 million bbl of oil and 0.8 tcf of
gas to Egypt’s reserves base. Production wells
drilled or re-completed totaled 230, most of
which were completed in the Western Desert.
Also during the year, 23 agreements were
signed and amended that include financial
obligations totaling $899 million and the
commitment to drill 96 wells.
The continued search for new reserves by
both Egyptian and international companies in
recent years has helped slow the inevitable
decline in oil production from fields discovered
in the 1960s and 1970s.
In 2003, for example, the biggest oil
discovery in 14 years added reserves of about
80 million bbl. When developed, the field is
expected to produce 45,000 b/d, according to
Minister of Petroleum H.E. Eng. Sameh
Fahmy. In 2004, another big oil discovery

“These discoveries open more opportunities
to find additional oil reserves in the deeper
targets,” said Petroleum Minister Fahmy.
Egyptian General Petroleum Corp. (EGPC),
in its strategy to achieve the goals of the
Ministry of Petroleum to increase the country’s
petroleum wealth, will:
• Tender new open areas in different
sedimentary basins with international bid rounds
• Improve and upgrade the petroleum
agreement process to lure more investment
• Apply the latest exploration and
exploitation technologies
• Use exploration theories to reduce
risk and increase success

Oil Co. (AMOC) converts heavy distillates to
gas oil and produces naphtha.
Along with the inexorable growth in
demand for refined products, global economic
expansion and a rising world population will
drive increased demand for petrochemical
products. Egypt’s Master Plan to become a
leading petrochemical manufacturer is designed
to take full advantage of that opportunity.

Technical competence

Downstream development
Crude oil and natural gas reserves are
fundamental to Egypt’s energy future. But
adding value to those raw materials by
producing products for a broad range of
markets is the key to economic growth
and stability.
Being competitive in tomorrow’s
refined product market will require a lighter
product slate, improved plant efficiency and
lower cost, and those are key objectives of
expansion and upgrading projects underway
and planned for Egypt’s refineries.
“We devote our attention to addressing
environmental issues by developing ways to
reduce pollution, increasing the production
of middle distillates with higher added
values, and improving product quality,” said
Petroleum Minister Fahmy.
Egypt’s state-of-the art Middle East Oil
Refinery (Midor), for example, can produce 5
million metric tons per year of petroleum
products that meet European standards.
Other companies also produce high quality
refined products. Alexandria National Refining
and Petrochemical Co. (Anrpc) makes unleaded
high octane gasoline and Alexandria Mineral

opportunities available in the country.
About 58 firms, including BP, BG Group,
Eni, Shell, Apache, Petronas and others are
currently operating under 102 concession
agreements. In the last two years, 63 agreements
and amendments were signed that involved
financial obligations totaling $2.188 billion
and commitments to drill a total of 258 wells.
Since its creation in 2003 to enhance
exploration in Upper Egypt, Ganoub El Wadi
Petroleum Holding Co. (Ganope) has held
three bid rounds and announced a fourth. The
company has awarded seven blocks in Upper
Egypt and the Red Sea and the first exploratory
well will be drilled before the end of this year.
“The company has made great progress in
attracting companies to explore within its vast
territory,” said Petroleum Minister Fahmy.
Before Ganope was established, only 6% of
Egypt’s working area was covered by exploration
and production (E&P) agreements; now 26% is
under production sharing agreements (PSA).
More than 25 new concessions are planned
for 2007.
“Our plan is to issue at least one international
bid round per year,” said Eng. Hassan M. Akl,
Ganope Chairman. With seven agreements in
place; he expects to have 15 by the end of 2006
and 25 agreements by 2008.

“Egypt’s abundant natural gas resources and
its ability to move downstream to produce
higher added-value products will have a
positive impact on the country’s economy,” said
Ms. Sanaa A. Moneim El Banna, Chairperson,
Egyptian Petrochemicals Holding Co. (Echem).
As petrochemical feedstock costs rise,
proximity to gas supply becomes an important
competitive advantage. Areas such as the
northeastern coast of Egypt that have
relatively low-cost feedstock represent an
attractive investment opportunity, said Ms.
Moneim El Banna.

Partners and investment welcome
Participation of a broad cross section of
international and private companies in
exploration and production activities that span
30% of Egypt is just one indication of the

Technology is increasingly critical to
competitive success throughout the
petroleum value chain. In response to
that trend, Egypt is becoming an
important exporter of expertise,
building projects in Saudi Arabia, Syria,
Sudan, Jordan and elsewhere.
“Having access to technology means
working closely with technology owners,
including international companies,”
according to EGAS experts. “We often
begin with a number of foreign experts,
then build our capability to the point where
Egyptians dominate operations.”
Other Egyptian companies also follow this
process, including Engineering for the
Petroleum and Process Industries (Enppi),
Egyptian Drilling Co., Petroleum Maritime
Services (PMS) and Petroleum Projects and
Technical Consultation Co. (Petrojet).
Petrojet began working overseas three years
ago, and now gets 40% of its revenues from
outside Egypt, said Eng. Hany Dahy, Chairman.
By the end of 2006, Enppi’s business
abroad will account for 30% of revenue, said
Eng. Fakhry Eid, Chairman.
“We are planning to reach 50% abroad in
the future,” he said. “Our vision is to make
Enppi one of the top 10 engineering/
procurement/construction (EPC) contractors
in the Middle East/North Africa region.”

hen the idea of linking the
Mediterranean Sea and the Red
Sea with a navigable waterway first occurred
to the Pharaohs, the commercial world was a
far smaller place. As trade expanded over the
centuries, so did the value of a route that
would connect Europe, the Middle East,
Africa and Asia that did not require a long trip
around the southern tip of Africa.
Turning that ancient idea into today’s
reality took centuries and claimed many
lives before Egypt’s Suez Canal was finally
inaugurated in 1869. But it now is one of
the world’s most strategic trade routes,
shortening the distance between most of the
world’s markets.
At the heart of international trade and
commerce, Egypt today can competitively
supply a market of one billion people.
As important as the Canal became to
moving goods from source to consumer,
however, the growing importance to the
world of Middle Eastern oil called for
additional capacity and a different kind of
transportation facility.
That need was met by the 320-km Suez
Mediterranean (Sumed) pipeline system
linking Ain Sukhna on the Gulf of Suez to Sidi
Kerir on the Mediterranean. Sumed’s twin
parallel 42-in. pipelines, with a design
capacity of 117 million tons/year, has been in
operation since 1977 as a companion to the
Suez Canal for transporting oil from the
Arabian Gulf region to the Mediterranean.
Through 2004, it had transported more
than 16 billion bbl.
A regional alliance, Sumed is owned by
EGPC, 50%; Saudi Arabian Oil Co., 15%;
three Kuwait firms, 15%; the International
Petroleum Investment Co. IPIC (Abu Dhabi),
15%; and Qatar Petroleum Corp., 5%.
The pipeline system is part of the local and
international long-term political vision that has
remained unchanged since the presidency of
Gamal Abdel-Nasser.

MUBARAK KOUL PROJECT

Unemployment is a real issue in
Fayum Governorate where FGC
operates. FGC participated in
the “Mubarak Koul Project”,
which allows students in Fayum
Secondary Vocational Schools to
receive training in FGC sites
apart from their normal studies.
Fathy, pictured above, is one of
the students that joined the
FGC Technical section. The
training gave him a good chance
to start his occupational life
with a real work experience.

The Pharaohs dug a canal linking the
Mediterranean and the Red Sea through the
eastern branch of the Nile Delta but it
remained neglected. The Greeks, then the
Romans dug it several times, but it was again
neglected. Dug once again at the time of the
Arab conquest of Egypt, the Canal existed for a
time, but was later filled up.
The enduring idea was finally set on the
path to reality in 1854 when French
engineer Ferdinand De-lesseps signed an
agreement with the Egyptian Government to
dig the Canal. Digging began in 1859,
coincidentally the year that the first
commercial oil well was drilled in the US.
For 10 years, more than 2.4 million
Egyptian workers worked on the Canal;
more than 125,000 lost their lives.
In 1869, the Suez Canal was finally opened
for navigation. In July 1956, Egypt nationalized
the Canal after it had been an international
company for 87 years.
With a total length of 192 km, Suez
remains the world’s longest canal without
locks. Today, it transports 14% of total world
trade, 26% of oil exports and 41% of the total
volume of goods and cargo that reach Arabian
Gulf ports. It can handle about 25,000 vessels
annually.
About 3,300 oil tankers passed through the
Suez Canal in 2004, a 20% increase in tanker
traffic from 2003. Total northbound and
southbound oil shipments increased from 1.4
to 1.7 million b/d between 2003 and 2004.
Transit in the Canal employs a convoy system.
The northbound convoy consists of two groups
and southbound traffic includes two convoys.
There are no length restrictions for ships
traversing the Canal. Currently, the Canal can
accommodate ‘Suezmax’ class tankers with
drafts to 62 ft and 200,000 dead-weight-ton
(dwt) maximum cargos. Depending on the type
of vessel and its load, speed is limited to 11-16
km/hr; an average transit time is about 14 hours.

Suez Canal and Sumed
A state of the art facility has emerged at Port Said East as a trans-shipment centre for the Eastern Mediterranean and the Northern entrance to the Suez Canal.

In 2001, the Suez Canal Authority (SCA)
launched a 5-year program to reduce average
tanker transit times to 11 hours. The SCA also
is moving ahead with a 10-year project to
widen and deepen the Canal. By 2010, it will
be able to accommodate very large crude
carrier (VLCC) and ultra large crude carrier
(ULCC) class tankers with oil cargos of up to
350,000 dwt.

Sumed: Stable, economical, flexible
The Sumed system includes the terminal at Ain
Sukhna where up to four tankers of any size
can discharge their cargo simultaneously. At
the other end of the pipeline, Sidi Kerir
terminal can load five tankers of up to 400,000
dwt at the same time. Large tank farms at each
terminal provide spare storage capacity and
pipeline operating flexibility that helps meet
customers’ varied requirements.
Original capacity of the Sumed system was
about 1.6 million b/d. It has grown to about
2.4 million b/d currently and is operating at
about 96% of design capacity, said Eng.
Moustafa Gomaa, Chairman of Arab
Petroleum Pipelines Co. Future capacity
increases will depend on crude oil market
conditions, he said.
As political tensions grow, Egypt’s access to
the Mediterranean for Middle East oil becomes
increasingly valuable.

local control centers are part of the system.
“Our main objective is to assure the
customers of Sumed that their products are in
safe hands,” said Eng. Gomaa. “We strive to do
this in the most economical, and with
minimum environmental impact.”

More than just a transporter
Oil transportation is not the only service
Sumed provides. It also helps companies
market their crude from Sidi Kerir, which
can serve as a stable strategic focal point for
sale of oil on a free-on-board (FOB) basis.
Shippers discharging a VLCC or ULCC at
Ain Sukhna terminal, for example, can
tailor liftings from Sidi Kerir in the volumes
and types needed by their refineries, FOB
customers, or to meet destination port
limitations.
This ‘cargo tailoring’ lowers freight costs
and provides flexibility.
Other related services include:
• Stock transfer of crude oil while in
Sumed custody
• Cargo topping, a process that avoids
dead freight by advancing the balance when a
customer’s crude type in Sumed custody is
less than the tanker size
• Crude oil swap to clear small amounts of
a customer’s remaining inventory
• Methods to facilitate financial transactions
Innovation has helped the system keep
pace with larger vessels and volumes and
shifting supplies and markets. Sumed is
cooperating with the Suez Canal Authority,
for example, on a system of lightering called
drop and pick, which was established in
1997. The process makes it possible for a
VLCC to be partially unloaded at Sumed’s
terminal at Ain-Sukhna so the tanker can pass
through the Canal safely and reload at Sidi
Kerir terminal.
Making it possible for VLCCs to use the
Canal, although they cannot transit it fully

loaded because of the draft limitation, allows
the Sumed/Canal partnership to serve the
east coast of North America, as well as other
markets.
“This technique has increased our capacity
and we hope more users will take advantage
of this option,” said Eng. Gomaa.
Another project was launched recently to
receive Mediterranean and Black Sea crudes
at Sidi Kerir terminal for storage and

reloading. Growth of Mediterranean, Russian
and Caspian exports prompted Sumed to
modify two single buoy mooring (SBM)
facilities to be able to receive crude at Sidi
Kerir and reload it again.
Storage at Side Kerir provides a buffer to
Mediterranean refineries, minimizing their
need to invest in storage or maintain large
inventories. VLCC cargoes can be accumulated
to save freight for the long-haul US-bound
cargoes. And Mediterranean crude can be
combined with Arabian Gulf crude transported
through the pipeline.
Three new tanks with a total capacity of
1.2 million bbl were added to enhance the
flexibility of this ‘back loading’ option.
Another change under consideration is
the ability to pump crude from North to
South to handle potential exports from the
CIS and North Africa to Asia.
“The Sumed pipeline is also very important
to the Midor refinery,” said Mr. Mahmoud
Nazeem, Midor Chairman. Midor currently
has an agreement with Saudi Arabia under
which almost half of the refinery’s crude diet
is met with the Saudi crude. That oil must be
transported from the receiving port on the
Red Sea to Sidi Kerir on the Mediterranean
where the other terminal of the refinery’s
crude supply pipeline is located. Sumed has
installed special import facilities at Sidi Kerir
to receive Mediterranean crude for Midor.

A community partner

Workers oversee security of plant.

Movement of ships in the Damietta complex.

Since it began, part of Sumed’s net profit has
gone to community development, including
the support of many universities and health
care facilities in both Suez and Alexandria.
It introduced an up-to-date ultrasonic
scanning medical device in the Alexandrian
government hospitals, and has financed
many facilities for the handicapped in
Egypt. The company also focuses on the
development of its employees by offering
training courses and a health care program
for employees and their families.
Environmental protection has also been an
ongoing effort. In the mid 1970s, Sumed spent
$40 million to build its plant to treat ballast
water from tankers. Sumed management
continues to be committed to preventing
pollution. Along with the ballast water
treatment facility, a key part of that effort is the
system’s sophisticated continuous monitoring
capability that provides early warning of any
incident. Strategically placed pollution fighting
equipment uses the latest technology.
“We also are working under the umbrella
of the Ministry of Petroleum and Alexandria
University to support research in the industry
and to forge a solid link between the university
and the industry,” said Eng. Gomaa.

Egypt’s Natural Gas Future

Egypt’s natural gas future:
A world class resource will fuel expanded
local use and LNG exports

E

gypt’s natural gas resource is vital to the
country’s energy future.
At home, natural gas is steadily replacing oil
for commercial, industrial and residential use to
the long term benefit of the environment.
Beyond Egypt, the world’s appetite for clean
burning fuel offers great potential to serve a range
of markets with both pipeline and LNG exports.
And natural gas is a critical element in
Egypt’s unfolding Master Plan for a world class
petrochemical industry.
To fully exploit these opportunities, the
Egyptian Ministry of Petroleum’s policy will
balance medium term export commitments,
local needs and long term strategic
requirements.
The country already is on the road to its gas
future. During fiscal year 2003/2004, natural
gas production reached 1.3 tcf. Electricity
generation accounted for about two-thirds of
total consumption and the number of
residential, commercial and industrial gas
users reached 2 million. Egypt also is a leader
in natural gas-fueled vehicles with more than
54,000 such vehicles on the road at the end of
the year and 83 fueling and conversion stations
in place.
Because its emerging natural gas industry is
so critical to Egypt’s future and implementing
its comprehensive gas strategy will be complex,
the Petroleum Ministry established the
Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Co. (EGAS) to
guide activities along the entire chain of natural
gas operations.
To execute the country’s gas utilization plan
over the next two decades, EGAS plans to:
• Increase reserves at an average annual
rate of 4/6 tcf
• Meet total demand that is expected to
grow at an average annual rate of 4%
• Develop an infrastructure that covers the
entire country
• Create a comprehensive plan for
expanding the use of compressed natural gas
(CNG) in vehicles

Size of the resource
Fundamental to the success of the strategy is a
significant proven natural gas resource and the
potential for more discoveries, including those
in the deep water of the Mediterranean. At the
end of fiscal year 2004/2005, Egyptian gas
reserves of 67 tcf accounted for more than
three-fourths of Egypt’s proven hydrocarbon
reserves. The bulk of those gas reserves are in
the Nile Delta area and in the Mediterranean.
In addition, potential reserves are estimated
at 100-120 tcf. One of the most promising
sources of gas is the deep water of the
Mediterranean, which will be a focus of
exploration and development. A recent study
ranked Egypt second in the world in potential
deep water gas potential.
From 2001 to 2004, two international bid
rounds were held and 41 discoveries added

about 15 tcf of gas and 127 million bbl of
condensate to proven reserves. Petroleum
Minister Fahmy signed the first two EGAS
concession agreements in the Mediterranean
Sea during the period, one for the Tina area
and one for the Baltim area. Another
international bid including 12 exploration
blocks in the Nile Delta, North Sinai onshore
and Mediterranean Sea closed in July 2006.
Major discoveries during 2003/2004 fiscal
year included Kasr-2 which added 1.8 tcf of
reserves and three programs that added 1 tcf
each—Raven, Tarot, and Kg 45.

Export facilities: Up and running
Exporting natural gas is a cornerstone of
Egypt’s oil and gas development strategy,
according to Petroleum Minister Fahmy. And
gas export operations are off to a fast start. Both
the pipeline export of natural gas and LNG
exports began almost simultaneously from
different locations.
The Arab Natural Gas Transmission
Pipeline, a regional system to serve neighboring
countries, now extends to Rehab, Jordan and
agreements have recently been put in place to
expand it to the Syrian-Turkish border, making
it possible to market gas to Europe.
At the same time, three LNG trains began
shipments within little more than a year. Two
or three more LNG trains could be built at
either of the existing plants—Damietta or
Idku—over the next five years, depending on
exploration success, according to Hesham
Mekawi, Chairman, BP Egypt.

chain is natural gas liquids. NGLs extracted at

provide liquefied petroleum gases (LPG) and
condensate for the local market, propane for
export and ethane for the production of
ethylene and polyethylene.
In 2003/2004, production of LPG, propane
and ethane totaled more than 1 million tons;
condensate production was about 1 million bbl.

Egypt’s Natural Gas Future
A final element of the natural gas value chain is natural gas liquids. NGLs extracted at a processing plant provide liquefied petroleum gases (LPG).

Already in sixth place
LNG export will be an important driver of
Egypt’s economic growth and a reliable source
of natural gas for world markets far into the
future. The country now has two plants on
stream and a vision for aggressive expansion.
Within four years after EGAS was established,
the country became the 6th largest LNG
producer in the world.
Damietta, the largest LNG plant with a
design capacity of 7.56 billion cu m/year, was
put on stream in December 2004 after a record
of only 52 months from inception to first
shipment. LNG from Damietta is sent to the
Spanish market by Union Fenosa, 80% owner
of The Egyptian-Spanish Natural Gas Co.
(Segas), which operates the facility; and to
Mediterranean and US markets by EGAS, 10%
owner of Segas.
Two liquefaction trains of the Idku LNG
project east of Alexandria, each with a design
capacity of 3.6 million tons/year, were put on
stream in 2005. Construction of both trains
was completed ahead of schedule, Train 1 by
three months and Train 2 by nine months.
Beheira Natural Gas Liquefaction Co. owns
the first train, output from which will be taken
by Gaz de France under a 20-year agreement.
Though output from Train 1 has been sold to
Gaz de France, BG Group will purchase from
Gaz de France about two cargoes of LNG per
month between July 2005 and the end of 2006.

BG Group lifted its first LNG cargo from
Idku LNG Train 1 on 29 May 2005, some three
months ahead of schedule. This was the first of
three pre-commissioning cargoes from Train 1.
Idku Natural Gas Liquefaction Co. owns
Train 2, which will supply BG Group with
LNG for export to the Lake Charles terminal in
the US, and to Italy. For about the first three

was about $1.9 billion. Project financing of
$949 million was secured for Train 1 in April
2004 and $880 million was secured for Train 2
in July 2005. The latter includes $320 million
to repay the Train 1 owner for Train 2’s share of
the common facilities.
There is sufficient space at the Idku site for
four more LNG trains. BG Group, for example,
is seeking reserves that would support a third
train through its own exploration program and
in partnership with third parties, according to
the company.

“We have more than one window to
monetize gas reserves.” Eng. Mr. Ismail H.
Karara, Gasco Chairman

years of LNG production, BG Group intends to
send the entire output to Lake Charles. A
portion of Train 2 output will then be supplied
to the Brindisi LNG import terminal in Italy
which BG Group is developing.
Gas fields in the West Delta Deep Marine
area of the Mediterranean will be further
developed to feed the Idku LNG complex.
Idku uses the proven Phillips liquefaction
technology. Total project cost of Trains 1 and 2

The project’s commercial structure has been
designed to allow future expansion without the
need to involve all existing partners and it is
possible that third parties could supply gas to
future trains. The Egyptian LNG Co. owns
both the Egyptian LNG site and common
facilities. Its sister company, Egyptian Operating
Company for Natural Gas Liquefaction
Projects (Opco), operates all trains.

EGAS role
EGAS was established in 2001 to realize the
Ministry of Petroleum’s strategy to restructure
the petroleum sector in Egypt according to
the vision of HE the Minister of Petroleum.

Egypt’s Natural Gas Future

11
With responsibility for all natural gas
activities including exploration, production,
transmission, distribution, marketing and
export, EGAS will:
• Encourage investments in natural gas
activities
• Prepare action plans for natural gas
industry and related projects
• Develop techno-economic studies for
gas projects
• Manage sales gas transmission &
distribution systems and coordinate all
related activities
• Develop LNG projects on its own or with
national and international partners
• Participate in exploration, development
and production from gas discoveries
• Develop the natural gas industry database
• Study and define optimum locations for
gas projects
A special focus is to apply advanced
exploration techniques and concepts in the
search for the potential 120 tcf of undiscovered
gas reserves thought to exist. EGAS also will
work to expand gas export pipelines to link
with the European Gas Pipeline system and
implement additional LNG trains.

Serving domestic markets

LNG Tanks, Western Desert Gas Complex.

The largest LNG plant, Damietta.

Leveraging opportunity
Success in all this will require a dedication to
regional and international cooperation.
EGAS has a number of exploration
concessions with international companies in the
Mediterranean and in the Nile Delta onshore. In
the near future, EGAS will have approximately
25 concession agreements in place.
The latest bid round, including 12 blocks,
nine of them offshore and three onshore, has
generated great interest among international
companies.
There is more than one way to monetize
the reserves found. In addition to exports by
both pipeline and LNG, the local market has
been expanding in the last five years to
accommodate new fertilizer manufacturing,
petrochemical and methanol plants.
Egypt has extensive infrastructure and a
national pipeline grid that is continuously
upgraded to accommodate new production.
Most important is Egypt’s business expertise,
its modern petroleum sector, and its
reputation for political stability. Some
international companies have been operating
in Egypt for more than 40 years.
“We have never been to arbitration, and all
our differences with our partners have been
amicably resolved.” states EGAS insiders.
Throughout the entire oil and gas value
chain, the Egyptian petroleum sector has
been attracting foreign direct investments of
$2-3 billion per year. With the current plan to
extend the national gas grid as far as Aswan

by 2011, there will be opportunities for
investments in pipelines and downstream
facilities, as well as new opportunities for
exploration.
And Egypt’s strategic position makes it
possible to serve European, US and even Far
East LNG markets at a very competitive cost,
he said. The opportunity for more LNG
projects exists. There is plenty of room to
expand and add many more trains.

Gasco has an important role to play in
promoting the utilization of gas in Egypt
through its presence at every point of the
Egyptian gas chain, said Eng. Ismail Karara,
Chairman. The company is owned 70% by
EGPC, 15% by Petrojet and 15% by EGAS.
Since its establishment in 1997, the company
has been responsible for the management,
operation, maintenance, development and
upgrading of the national gas grid. A pioneer in
transmission, distribution, processing and
marketing, Gasco has always been a link
between natural gas producers and consumers.
That connection now has extended to
consumers in neighboring countries. Gasco
supplies gas to the Arab Natural Gas Pipeline
and transmits natural gas to the Damietta LNG
plant where it is exported to Europe.
“In political terms, the Arab Natural Gas
Pipeline system helps consolidate Arab
integration,” said Eng. Karara.
With about 2 million household, commercial
and industrial consumers now connected, the
plan is to bring that total to 6 million consumers
within the coming six years, he said.
Gasco also plays a leading role in gas
processing, recovering LPG for local use, an
ethane/propane mixture for petrochemical
feedstock, and commercial propane for export.
As gas processing moved to the forefront of
Gasco strategy, the company integrated the
operation of the Western Desert Gas complex
and the Ameryia LPG recovery plant.
Gasco currently has several projects underway
to enhance productivity. One of the projects will
boost production of the ethane/propane mix from
the Western Desert Gas Complex and Ameryia
plant. Scheduled for completion within 30
months at an approximate cost of $200 million, it
will almost double production.
Several projects are also in progress to
expand the national gas grid. The El Tina-Abu
Sultan pipeline will satisfy the demand in Suez,
and north of the Gulf of Suez, the DahshourKoraimat pipeline will cope with increased
demand resulting from expansion of the
Koraimat power station. South Valley Pipeline
will feed the south of the country, and
feasibility studies have been conducted to
evaluate a plan to supply natural gas to Sharm
El Sheikh and Hurghada.

Using technology
Gasco also operates Egypt’s National Advanced
Control Center (NATA) that provides control
for the national gas grid. NATA monitors and
regulates the gas flow using a sophisticated
communication network that collects data
from all pipelines, delivery points, distribution
centers and consumption stations in each
geographic center and sends them through a

km of pipelines with a transmission and
distribution capacity of 135 million standard
cubic feet per day (MMscfd).
Gasco’s On Line Inspection technology is
another part of the diverse effort that maintains
the reliability of the gas grid. The technology
recently was used to rehabilitate Egypt’s oldest
natural gas pipeline.
First installed in 1975 to move gas from the
Abu Madi field to a power plant and fertilizer
plant at Talkha, the 12-in. 40-km line was not
properly coated when installed and large
sections had corroded.
Reducing the operating pressure from 70 to
40 bar (atmospheres) would reduce capacity
by 65%. Instead a rehab plan was devised to
deal with more than 700 defects and faults
ranging from superficial to dangerous and
return the line to safe operation at 70 bar.
The rehabilitation plan called for the pipe

In addition to LNG, BG Group’s
activities in Egypt span the gas chain
from exploration, through development
and production, including:
• Operatorship of two gasproducing areas offshore the Nile
Delta, the Rosetta Concession and the
West Delta Deep Marine (WDDM)
Concession
• Production of 345 MMscfd of gas from
the Rosetta concession for the domestic market
• Production of gas from the Scarab
Saffron fields in WDDM, including 475
MMscfd for the domestic market, and 225
MMscfd for five years through the Damietta
LNG plant
• Production of gas from the Simian
Sienna fields in WDDM that supplies Idku
LNG Train 1 with 565 MMscfd
• Development of the Sapphire field in
WDDM to supply Idku LNG Train 2
• A major shareholding in the Idku LNG
project
• A shareholding in the Nile Valley Gas
Co., which has the distribution franchise for
Upper Egypt
BG Group undertakes upstream development
and production activities in Egypt through

joint operating companies. In the case of
Rosetta, this is the Rashid Petroleum Co.
(Rashpetco); in the WDDM, it is the Burullus
Gas Co. These companies are 50% owned by
EGPC. BG Group and its partners in each
concession hold the remaining 50%.
With its various partners, BP has, over the
past few years, discovered 8 tcf of gas. All of the
produced gas is sold into Egypt’s domestic
market. BP expects its aggressive exploration
strategy to form the foundation for significant
LNG business.

“With about 2 million household,
commercial and industrial consumers
now connected, the plan is to bring
that total to 6 million consumers
within the coming 6 years.” Eng. Mr. Ismail H.
Karara, Gasco Chairman

In early 2006, Egypt and Greece signed a
memo of understanding for oil and gas
exploration that also calls for discussing the
best economic means to export gas to Greece
either through LNG, CNG or pipelines. Greece
would become a transit point in moving gas on
to Europe. Formation of a joint work group
made up of the two countries’ experts will be
the first phase of the cooperation.
Greece already has begun to study a plan to
transfer CNG to the Greek islands of Crete and
Rhodes in cooperation with Egypt. By the end
of 2006, the natural gas pipeline between Turkey
and Greece will be completed along with a study
of a gas pipeline between Greece and Italy.
The two pipelines will enable gas
movement from Italy to Turkey and it will play
a major role in getting Egyptian natural gas to
other new markets.

Building Egypt’s Downstream

Building Egypt’s downstream:
Master petrochemical plan, refinery expansion
will make a world leader

E

conomic growth and growing
populations will keep global demand
for transportation fuels and petrochemical
products growing at a brisk pace for the
foreseeable future. Meeting that demand will
require large investments in additional refining
and manufacturing capacity.
To be competitive, that capacity should be
located where it is convenient to both feedstock
and markets. And it should be capable of
producing the high quality, lighter products that
world markets increasingly demand.
Egypt’s significant petroleum resources—
especially its gas reserves—and its strategic
location make it an attractive place to invest in
new capacity. The country’s long term
economic and political stability serve to
reduce the risk of investment and add another
measure of competitive advantage.
With these assets—and its technical
expertise—Egypt has a unique opportunity to
take a leadership position in meeting
tomorrow’s demand for high quality
petroleum and petrochemical products.
To ensure that full advantage is taken of the

potential that tomorrow’s markets promise, the
Government of Egypt and the Ministry of
Petroleum have formulated plans and begun to
take action to convert that opportunity into
growth for Egypt and products for world markets.
Among those plans and actions are a
world-class grassroots refinery, upgrades to
existing refineries and a comprehensive
petrochemical industry Master Plan.

Refining
As the world’s spare refining capacity continues to
shrink, Egypt’s position as a venue for investment
in the expansion of existing plants and new
facilities becomes increasingly attractive.
Meeting the global need for more refining
capacity will focus on sophisticated ‘complex’
capacity to produce the light sweet petroleum
products that markets now demand. A more
complex refinery also is able to produce more
light transportation fuels from cheaper heavy
oil, providing a competitive advantage when
high crude prices combine with ever more
stringent air quality regulations.

Last year, Egypt’s refineries produced about
30.4 million tons of products. Domestic
demand for petroleum products in fiscal year
2004/2005 was almost 26.5 million tons and is
expected to exceed 27 million tons in the
current fiscal year.
Also last year, EGPC began a program to
upgrade the capacity of existing plants to 31.4
million metric tons annually, an increase of 1%
from the previous year. The company also
estimates capacity of existing refineries could be
boosted further, perhaps to 35 million tons/year.
The upgrading plan will increase kerosene
and jet fuel production by 5% over the previous
year and gasoline output by 3%. Production of
high value solvents will increase by 10%.
At end of the 2004/2005 year, a variety of
upgrading projects were in progress under a
detailed plan to maintain capacity, remove
bottlenecks and fulfill health, safety and
environmental requirements.
Key upgrading projects among Egypt’s
refineries included:
• Upgrading a lube oil complex to
maintain efficiency and increase production
• Rehabilitation of furnaces to maintain
production capacity
• Installing six boilers at three different
plants to meet operating steam demands
• Replacing current solvents at three
locations to increase lube oil production
capacity and meet international specifications
• Building a hypochlorite sodium unit to
treat and filter process water
• Installing a hydrogen compressor to
meet hydrogen demands

Serving the global market

The lack of spare refining capacity has recently
made it difficult to meet international product
demand. But that market challenge is another
opportunity for Egypt’s refining industry,
especially for Midor.
The refinery is fulfilling its share of
internal demand, said Mr. Nazeem. LPG and
diesel are the most crucial products required

Grassroots project
Also in response to the world’s need for more
refining capacity, Egypt’s Ministry of Petroleum
is considering a grassroots refinery that would
be co-located with a major petrochemical
complex and have a capacity of 200,000 to
300,000 b/d. The estimated total cost is about
$9.5 billion.
According to Petroleum Minister Fahmy,
the ambitious project now under study would
produce high quality, clean burning transport
fuels and petrochemical intermediates meeting
the strictest European specifications.
“It is set to be one of the top 20 complexes
in the world,” he said.
The complex would include these main
elements:
• A sophisticated refinery to produce high
quality gas oil, unleaded gasoline, naphtha and
kerosene
• Units to produce ethylene and polyethylene,
propylene and polypropylene, styrene and
aromatics

• A power and steam generation facility;
• Transportation and storage utilities.
This huge complex would offer about
100,000 job opportunities during its 5-year
construction and implementation phases,
according to Petroleum Minister Fahmy.
The Ministry of Petroleum plans to
establish a private holding company to
implement the complex, and make it a key
element in the development of Egypt’s
downstream petroleum capability.
Also in response to growing demand,
Ganope established a new petroleum products
marketing company, Nile Petroleum Trading
Co., which plans to build 25 integrated fuel
and services stations in the next five years along
the new main roads that connect the Nile side
with Oasis and Red Sea areas to support the
development of Upper Egypt.

and Suez. Sites feature access to roads, utilities
and local labor and feedstock.
The National Petrochemicals Plan is one of
the largest long term strategic development
plans in Egypt.
Egypt’s current production of polyethylene,
polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride meets a
portion of local demand and abundant
feedstock will help the industry expand. After
completing the Master Plan, the 15 million
tons/year of petrochemical products expected
to be produced will be worth $7 billion.
Imports worth $3 billion will be displaced and
exports worth $4 billion generated.
In developing its petrochemical industry,
Egypt benefits from its location at the cross
roads between three continents and its
proximity to these markets. But with a
population of more than 70 million, growing
domestic demand also adds to the
attractiveness of Egypt as a place to invest in
petrochemical capacity.
Egypt has a bright petrochemical future
for many of the same reasons it has
opportunities in other segments of the
petroleum industry. It offers:
A reliable infrastructure with constant
expansion;
• Committed available feedstock at
competitive prices throughout project life
• Stable political, economic and legal
environments
• An Investment Encouragement Law that
includes guarantees and incentives

• Logistical advantage due to its proximity
to European, Arab and African markets
• Availability of specialized technical
expertise with relatively low labor cost
• Growing market demand

Executing the plan
Egypt’s petrochemicals development plan will
be implemented through the Egyptian
Petrochemicals Holding Co. (Echem).

LPG Tower.

“The goal in creating Echem in 2002 was to
establish a strong entity capable of carrying out
the petrochemical Master Plan, and encourage
and promote investment in the petrochemical
industry,” said Petroleum Minister Fahmy.
In managing and marketing Egypt’s
emerging petrochemicals industry, special
attention will be paid to development of the
private sector with emphasis on joint ventures
and mixed capital companies. Echem will

promote the plan to local and international
investors and assist and support those
investors—technically, financially and
commercially—in planning, building and
operating projects.
“As it pursues its vision to become a major
manufacturer and marketer of petrochemical
products, Echem will develop a competitive
industry based on local human and natural
resources using state-of-the-art technology,”
said Ms. Moneim El Banna, Echem Chairperson.
Echem’s mission to establish and promote
an advanced petrochemical industry will
maximize the value added to the country’s
petroleum resources and support the national
economy, she said.
The Master Plan for Egypt’s petrochemical
industry calls for a disciplined approach to
each project that involves two phases—project
development and implementation.
Project development begins with an inhouse feasibility study that looks at
technology, markets, sites and feedstock. A
budget is also outlined and the environmental
impact of the project is assessed. This step
involves identifying groups of products and
selection of the best combination of products
along the product chain. Project objectives are
assessed and a preliminary technical/economic
picture created.
During this phase, the project is promoted
to potential investors and a memorandum of
understanding (MOU) is executed.
During the implementation phase, a
“bankable” feasibility study is conducted and

execution phase, an important goal is to apply
innovative contracts and financing schemes.

“Obviously, there will be growing demand
for gas and petrochemicals in the local

projects depend on gas,” said Eng. Eid, “in

Ethylene, propylene leader
One of Egypt’s most important petrochemical
companies is Sidpec. Organized in 1997 under
the country’s law of investment, Sidpec’s main
products are ethylene and propylene.
It currently produces about 300,000 tons of
ethylene and 225,000 tons of high and low

Egypt’s deepwater potential

Egypt’s deepwater potential:
Deep offshore growth promises daunting
challenges, but great rewards

D

eep and ultra-deep waters around
the world offer impressive potential
as a source of oil and gas.
In a 2004 study of deep water petroleum
potential, Wood Mackenzie Group concluded
that total resources expected to be discovered
in the world’s deep waters total 260 billion bbl
of oil equivalent (boe). About 50 billion bbl of
crude and 28 billion bbl of gas equivalent have
been discovered to date; yet-to-find reserves of
about 180 billion boe include 114 billion bbl
of oil and 68 billion bbl of gas equivalent.
In 2004, oil and gas production from deep
water accounted for about 5% of the world’s
total, a share that is expected to reach 9% by
2010, according to Wood Mackenzie.
The challenges—technical and economic—
are daunting. But the rewards are enormous.
For one thing, the volume of oil or gas
discovered by each deep water well is five
times the reserves added by a similar well on
shore or in shallow water, said the study.

An enviable position
Though still in the early stages of evaluating
options and implementing plans, Egypt is
poised to realize the potential of its deep water
areas. Independent studies indicate gas
production from deep offshore could play a
major role in Egypt’s petroleum and
petrochemical future.
The Wood Mackenzie study estimated
future exploration in the deep water of the
Mediterranean will add 70 tcf of gas reserves
and 3 billion bbl of oil reserves to Egypt’s
hydrocarbon storehouse. The study ranked
Egypt’s deep water gas potential second in the
world after the US Gulf of Mexico. If 70 tcf is
indeed added, Egypt would have 18% of
international deep water gas reserves.
The country’s exploration success coupled
with the large size of discoveries promise to
make the cost per equivalent barrel of its yetto-be-discovered reserves among the lowest,
said the study.

Offshore Rosetta Gas Field.

To conduct the deep water study, Wood
Mackenzie analyzed the potential of about
110 deep water reservoirs (below 400 m) in
30 sedimentary basins and river deltas in
18 countries.
A recent example of the promise of Egypt’s
deep water regions is a discovery in the
Mediterranean Deep Marine Area. Petroleum
Minister Fahmy announced the discovery by
Rashpetco in the West Delta Deep Marine
(WDDM) concession 120 km offshore at a
depth of 750 m. The well encountered natural
gas zones as well as intervals containing large
amounts of hydrocarbon liquids. Studies are
underway to estimate reserves.

Just beginning
In addition to Egypt’s current proved gas
reserves of 67 tcf, the consensus of international
companies and consultants is that undiscovered
gas resource is between 80 and 120 tcf.
“We trust we have not explored the whole
economic zone in the Mediterranean yet,” said
Mr. Karara. “And the extensive exploration

campaign for deeper targets has not started in
the Mediterranean.”
Most of the production now coming from
the Mediterranean is from shallow structures.
But recent discoveries by British Petroleum in
north Alexandria and by Italy’s ENI in Port
Fouad indicate deeper structures are present.
“It is evident that deeper structures will play
an increasing role in future supply,” said Mr.
Karara. “This makes Egypt a very good place for
exploration for the next two or three decades.”
Future concessions will be for both onshore
and offshore areas. But companies are
particularly interested in offshore Mediterranean
and onshore in the Nile Delta and northern
parts of Sinai Peninsula, said Mr. Karara.
Companies have already begun very aggressive
exploration campaigns and are expected to
continue despite the current challenge of
securing the offshore rigs.
EGAS’s current pipeline network puts it in
good position to begin to handle new production.
The network currently transports about 6,000
MMscfd from current EGPC concessions. “We
expect EGAS to start production from new
concessions in the very near future after
drilling begins this year,” said Mr. Karara.
With the expectation that much greater
demand for deepwater facilities is on the
horizon, Petrojet has begun to modify its
platform designs and tool up its workshops to
provide equipment for more severe operating
conditions, according to Eng. Dahy, Chairman.
The conventional platforms that the
company has been building are designed for
water depths to 150 m. Last year the company
fabricated and assembled a new record of
17,000 tons of offshore platforms in its Maadia
yard in Alexandria. It has another yard at Zeit Bay
north of Hurghada to serve Red Sea projects.

Offshore and sub sea capability
According to Eng. Eid, offshore projects—
especially those in Mediterranean waters to
2,000 m—are the future of Egypt. Platforms

high gas pressures call for more advanced
technologies.
“Enppi has a long history of international
cooperation,” said Eng. Eid. “During the last 30
years we have worked with almost every
international company, depending on the
project we were engaged in.”

On the Way to Egypt’s Petroleum Future

On the way to Egypt’s petroleum future:
Leverage location, encourage investment,
reduce environmental impact

I

ts Ministry of Petroleum has built a
strategy that gives Egypt control of its
bright oil and gas future. And the country's
unique assets-location, hydrocarbon resources,
people, and expertise-make it an attractive
place to invest.
As it becomes an increasingly important
partner in the world's largest industry, Egypt's
petroleum sector has a broad range of opportunities
to add value to the country's resources and
enhance the quality of life of its citizens.
Taking full advantage of these opportunities
will require capital, expansion, innovation,
and the help of international investors and
partners. And it must all be done in the context
of reducing the environmental impact of both
petroleum production and consumption.

A key goal: Attract investment
The Ministry of Petroleum's restructuring of
the oil sector will speed up the decisionmaking process and focus on growing
activities in gas and petrochemicals, said
Petroleum Minister Fahmy. These companies
participate in joint venture partnerships with
international oil companies.
As in the past, oil and gas still play an
important role in the country's economy. With
a well defined economic model for investment,
about $10 billion of foreign direct investment
was attracted in the past five years, compared
with $5.6 billion during 1996-2000, and $3.5
billion during 1991-1995.
The Petroleum Ministry expects the country
will attract approximately $20 billion of
international and national investments over the
coming five years, $16 billion of which will be
foreign direct investment. The Ministry expects
half of the foreign investment to be directed to
upstream projects.
“The main thrust of our strategy is to
increase petroleum products exports, reduce
the investment burden on the state budget and
attract more private and Arab international
investments,” said Petroleum Minister Fahmy.

Illuminated tower creates night scenes.

Ambitious plans for gas, petrochemicals
The world's growing preference for natural gas
will drive much of Egypt's petroleum future.
The country's reserves, its LNG experience, its
petrochemical Master Plan, and its access to
markets all combine to make it a significant
force in the global gas business.
Proved and yet-to-be-discovered gas reserves
together provide Egypt the potential to become
one of the leading gas producers and exporters
in the world, while also providing feedstock for
a world class petrochemicals industry.
“And there still are excellent opportunities for
exploration to add more gas reserves and
increase production,” said Mr. Ismail. “There will
be a variety of new investment opportunities
along the entire value chain.”
“Echem's mandate is to deliver an ambitious
20-year investment plan involving new
petrochemical projects valued at $10 billion,”
said Ms. Moneim El Banna.
Though the plan was prepared after an
international market overview that considered
many factors, it is important to remember that
the plan is dynamic.“Echem is the catalyst that
will create many opportunities for serious and
interested entities,” she said.

Sumed: Prepared for growth
The petrochemical Master Plan and refining
capacity expansion that the government is
implementing will be closely related to the
Sumed pipeline.

“We will build new pipelines with the
capacities and lengths needed,” said Eng. Gomaa.
“The extensions depend mainly on the availability
of new projects.” Expansions are expected in
the Suez area or in areas very close to Sidi Kerir.
“We look forward to being one of the most
important suppliers of crude oil for new
refineries,” he said. Sumed now supplies the
Midor refinery, and wants to supply new
refineries, including the 350,000 b/d grassroots
plant being considered for Kafr El Sheikh.
Sumed management also is considering a
product handling facility at Sidi Kerir terminal.
All of this is in addition to Sumed's storage
role that makes it a crucial hub for crude oil in
the Mediterranean.

Fundamental responsibilities
Resource utilization and business expansion are
critical elements in economic growth. To ensure
that growth has a positive impact on society and
the lives of individual citizens, however, business
goals must be balanced with social responsibilities.
While it does pose risks, the petroleum sector
can be one of the most effective industries in
bringing positive change to the lives of people
in the communities in which it operates.
In Suez, for example, two large refineries
provide many jobs and support social services.
In Damietta and Beheira, LNG projects have
generated new industries and companies, and
made infrastructure development possible. And
in Alexandria, a petroleum industry center,
large projects and ongoing operations continue
to lower unemployment and contribute to the
development of adjacent areas.
“It's not only the industry's expansion that
is important to us; the environment is also very
important,” said Mr. Nour El-Din. “Keeping
the environment clean is a must.”
And in the end, a company's success is
determined by its people. Little progress can be
made unless development of the health, skills,
knowledge, responsibility and enthusiasm of
employees is a top priority.

he focus of the seismic business has undergone a seismic shift of its own.
For decades, seismic has been primarily a tool for
exploration and development of oil and natural gas.
As seismic resolution improved and costs came down, industry saw increasing opportunity for optimizing production in a

This trend accompanied the operating companies’ own shifting focus in a low commodity-price environment to acquire existing reserves and expand reserves in mature producing areas
rather than emphasize high-risk wildcatting.

questions arise: Should the focus of advancing seismic technology shift back to exploration? Or should the emerging emphasis
on production optimization continue to grow?
The answer, according to industry experts interviewed for
this supplement, seems to be: Yes to both.

Production-oriented seismic

The Society of Exploration Geophysicists was given a name

Accordingly, Bahorich sees the focus of seismic technology
R&D gradually shifting towards production applications, “as this
is where the greatest number of applications will be.”
One area that Halliburton’s Landmark unit sees as a growing opportunity for seismic applications is enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects, says Doug Meikle, vice-president, Landmark
and project management, Halliburton Drilling, Evaluation, and
Digital Solutions.
“Sustained high oil prices due to relentless global demand
and diminishing new ﬁeld discoveries are making previously
uneconomic or marginally economic opportunities much more
attractive,” Meikle says. “Experts believe there is a large amount
of original oil in place that has not been produced. What’s more,
we already know where to ﬁnd it.”

In mature areas such as the North Sea, there is a growing
urgency for operators to discover and develop satellite ﬁelds

economic reserves deplete. Megasurveys merge huge datasets
from a wide variety of ﬁeld-speciﬁc 3D surveys into consistent
3D data to help improve understanding of depositional systems
in a regional context.
PGS has developed megasurveys with as many as 130 3D

geology in a new and exciting way.
“It gives industry the ability to understand regional geology
that in a big way can help companies understand the migration

Emphasizing

Many in the industry contend
that the synergies between exploration seismic and reservoir seismic warrant continued emphasis
on both and not on one to the detriment of the other.

“Equally important is the need for the industry to apply
creative business and ﬁnancial models that are able to couple

says. “To get seismic technology adopted rapidly, the application must also deliver on the three main points of the oil and

Pilenko concurs, adding that Veritas makes it a point to deeply
involve clients at every step in the development of new technology.
“It’s important to close the loop in an interactive way,” he
says. “We need to embed our customers in our workﬂow and
in our ofﬁces.”
Such close collaboration underpins Veritas’s business model,
which is to focus on quality rather than on market share or size.
“If our market share increases, it is not because we’ve targeted market share, it’s because we’ve targeted quality, and the
customers became attracted to that emphasis on quality,” he
says. “This lets us work with customers who understand quality,
and we can ask them, ‘What do you want in the end?’”
Boutte acknowledges that operators have grown accustomed
to seeing examples of technology, quite often in or near their
ﬁelds, before making buying decisions.
“It becomes difﬁcult with high-cost technology to put this
burden entirely on the service sector,” he says. “One possible

the dynamic problem of tracking the movement/evolution of the
4D signature,” Brunck says. “The goal will be to replace the 4D
difference with 4D predictability in a similar way to that used in
weather forecasting.”
As operators in mature offshore areas such as the North Sea
and Gulf of Mexico review their global asset portfolios of producing assets for candidates for continuous 4D seismic to optimize
recovery, such permanent monitoring will become increasingly
common, says Per Arild Reksnes, president, Geoscience & Engineering, PGS Marine Geophysical, a unit of Petroleum GeoServices ASA, Oslo.
“Permanent monitoring using ﬁber optic technology is a very
exciting growth area that we expect to see take off soon,” he
says. “PGS has developed an entirely optical system that uses
passive in-sea sensors and telemetry to record seismic data
with high ﬁdelity and dynamic range, in water depths as large
as 3,000 m, and with low weight, great reliability, and improved

Also helping the multicomponent cause are advances in digital sensor technology, notably the MEMS (microelectromechanical systems)-based accelerometers that provide sensing capabilities not seen with conventional geophones. These sensors
can record ground accelerations with very low distortion and
very high accuracy in magnitude and orientation, says Brunck:
“It therefore becomes possible to record the full-wave ﬁeld with
much improved vector ﬁdelity.”

Borehole seismic
As acquisition hardware costs come down, industry is likely
to make greater use of borehole seismic such as crosswell and
vertical seismic proﬁling (VSP).
Brunck sees the development of larger tool arrays continuing, with CGG unit Sercel currently marketing a 32-level tool and
expected to introduce a 100-level system in the near future.
“This push to longer arrays will stimulate the demand for 3D
and 4D VSP, providing more resolution and certainty in VSP reservoir imaging,” he says. “This in turn will allow better linkage
between VSP and surface seismic datasets.”

Senate committee begins energy bill discussions
After weeks of silence regarding a possible conference to reconcile differences between comprehensive energy bills passed by
the US House and Senate earlier this year, the Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee’s staff began bicameral discussions
about the contents of the measures.
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff
Bingaman (D-NM), with the blessing of majority leader Harry M.
Reid (D-Nev.), asked the committee’s staff to host the discussions,
a committee spokesman said on Sept. 20. “These meetings are not
to decide the fate of any provisions, but to allow Senate staff to
become familiar with the background of the House bill provisions,
and vice versa,” he said.
The discussions were scheduled to begin with Titles IV and IX
of the House’s 1,003-page energy bill and include related sections
from the Senate’s legislation. Talks would continue on Sept. 21 but
recess at midday for Yom Kippur and resume on Sept. 24, with a
goal of covering all the material in both bills by the end of that
week, the committee spokesman said.

Suriname, Guyana maritime dispute settled
The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea has settled a
6-year maritime boundary dispute between Suriname and Guyana,
giving each country access to an offshore basin believed to be rich
in oil and natural gas.
“The boundary for the most part follows the equidistance line
between Guyana and Suriname,” the Hamburg, Germany-based
tribunal said. Guyana and Suriname lie side-by-side on the northeastern coast of South America, between Brazil and Venezuela.
Suriname had asserted a boundary further to the north and
west, while Guyana had relied on the so-called equidistance line
method of determining the boundary, which placed it farther to
the south and east.
While the exact position of the ocean boundary between them

Exploration

&

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

had long been a subject of disagreement, it did not result in conflict until exploratory tests revealed potentially huge deposits of
hydrocarbons beneath the sea bed.
In 2000 Suriname enforced its disputed claim by sending two
gunboats to force CGX Energy Inc. to withdraw its drilling rig from
the disputed area before it could drill under a license granted by
Guyana.
According to the terms of the tribunal’s ruling, Guyana gained
sovereignty over 12,837 sq miles of the coastal waters, while Suriname received 6,900 sq miles.
Both Guyana and Suriname agreed to abide by the tribunal’s
ruling, and as a result both nations can also now proceed in further
exploration of their respective ocean territories.
The US Geological Survey estimates that the coastal area off the
two countries, referred to as the Guyana-Suriname basin, could
hold reserves of 15 billion bbl of oil and 42 tcf of gas.

Paradigm to pay $1 million to settle FCPA issues
Paradigm BV, an exploration and production software supplier
based in Amsterdam, said Sept. 24 it will pay $1 million as part of
a settlement with the US Department of Justice for possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
Paradigm said DOJ did not levy civil or criminal charges in the
matter involving improper payments to government officials of
various countries during 2002-07, which Paradigm voluntarily
disclosed. No one in the company’s current senior management
was involved in the payments, it added.
Paradigm said it discovered the payments during due diligence
for an anticipated initial public offering. The company said it immediately retained the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher, &
Flom LLP to conduct a multicountry investigation and make the
voluntary disclosure.
As part of the agreement, Paradigm said it also agreed to implement and enhance internal controls, retain outside compliance
counsel, and cooperate fully with DOJ. ✦

Development

Colombia awards nine offshore blocks
Colombia’s National Hydrocarbons Agency has awarded 9 of
13 offshore blocks in the Caribbean Sea that had been released for
tendering.
State-owned Ecopetrol SA will participate in joint ventures with
foreign partners in six of the concessions and has two others alone.
BP PLC won the sole right to develop Block 5. Altogether, Ecopetrol won Blocks 11 and 12 outright, and will partner with Brazil’s
Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras), India’s Oil & Natural Gas Corp.
(ONGC), Hess Corp., and BP in six other blocks.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

The companies have agreed to commit $5.3-5.8 million in exploration funding in return for 10-year oil and gas exploration
rights, along with production rights for the lifetime of their fields.
The blocks awarded, the successful bidders, and the amounts
of exploration investment committed, in millions of dollars, are as
follows: 4, Petrobras, Ecopetrol, and BP, 5.5; 5, BP, 5.8; 6, Petrobras,
Ecopetrol, and Hess, 5.3; 7, Petrobras, Ecopetrol, and Hess, 5.3; 8,
Petrobras, Ecopetrol, and ONGC, 5.3; 9, Ecopetrol, 5.3; 10, Ecopetrol and ONGC, 5.3; 11, Ecopetrol, 5.3; and 12, Ecopetrol, 5.3.
Blocks 1, 2, 3, and 13 received no bids.

Petrobras reports success with Brazil ﬁelds
Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) has tested 2,900 b/d of 27°
gravity oil from its exploration well in deepwater Carioca field on
Block BM-S-9 in the Santos basin off Brazil. The well also tested
57,000 cu m/day of gas. Both results were constrained by test

Carioca lies in 2,140 m of water 273 km off southern Rio de
Janeiro state. It is near the Tupi discovery on Block BM-S-11, announced last October (OGJ, Nov. 20, 2006, p. 43).
The partners, Petrobras, Repsol-YPF Brazil SA, and BG Group,
say the find is a significant one. For BG, this is the third well to find
hydrocarbons in the new Santos basin presalt play, which has enhanced the company’s confidence in the highly prospective area.
Petrobras has a 45% stake, Repsol-YPF 25%, and BG 25%.
Additionally, Petrobras has informed Brazil’s National Petroleum
Agency that the Xerelete heavy oil discovery in ultradeep water off
Brazil is commercial. It tested flows as high as 2,500 b/d.
Xerelete—formerly known as Curió—was previously operated
by Total SA, which made the discovery in 2001 over Blocks BC-2
and BMC-14 in the prolific Campos basin.
The 1-EPB-1-RJS exploration well, drilled in water 2,483 m
deep, hit sandy, 17.5° gravity oil-bearing reservoirs at a depth of
3,478 m. It is Brazil’s deepest subsea discovery to date.
Xerelete contains relatively heavy oil of 17-20° gravity. Preliminary geological studies suggest that Xerelete may extend for more
than 26 sq km, holding an estimated in-place volume of some 1.4

billion boe. “Additional studies are being carried out to define this
new field’s production development project,” Petrobras said.
Petrobras operates both blocks. It is working with Total on
Block BC-2. On Block BMC-14, Petrobras and Total each hold a
50% stake.

Agiba tests oil well on Egypt’s Meleiha block
Agiba Petroleum, operator of the Meleiha block in Egypt’s Western Desert, has tested 1,000 b/d of dry crude oil from its exploration well in the Gawaher structure on the block. Production is
expected to increase to 1,500 b/d.
“Appraisal of drilling results, adjustment of the field reserves,
further drilling-out, and development of field infrastructure is
presently going on,” said Lukoil Overseas, a partner in the project.
More than 17 million tonnes of oil has been produced on the
block during the last 30 years. The operating well stock is 141
units, 12 of which were drilled since the beginning of this year
and are producing a combined 3,200 b/d.
In April, the Egyptian parliament ratified the extension of the
concession agreement on Meleiha Block to 2024 (OGJ Online, Apr.
13, 2007).
Agiba Petroleum is a joint venture of Egyptian General Petroleum Corp., Eni subsidiary IEOC Production, and International Finance Co. Production-sharing contract interests are held by IEOC
56%, Lukoil 24%, and IFC 20%. ✦

Woodside brings Thylacine gas project on stream

Santos brings Oyang ﬁeld off Java on line

Woodside Petroleum Ltd. has brought on stream its Thylacine
gas development in the Otway basin off western Victoria after the
project’s scheduled start-up had fallen behind by more than a year
(OGJ Online, Oct. 20, 2006).
Production from Thylacine field, which lies in Tasmanian waters,
is being piped ashore to a processing plant in Victoria. Geographe
field, adjacent to Thylacine in Victorian waters, will be connected
to the main offshore pipeline during a later development phase.
Thylacine will supply 980 bcf of gas to Victoria over an estimated 10 years. There also will be 100,000 tonnes of liquid petroleum
gas and about 800,000 bbl/year of condensate. These products will
be the main revenue earners for the project.
The commissioning phase is complete, and gas production will
be increased to scheduled levels over the coming weeks.
Sales gas is transferred to TruEnergy’s adjacent Iona gas plant
to be piped onward to Melbourne and Adelaide. Condensate will
be trucked to Shell Australia’s refinery in Geelong, 50 km west of
Melbourne.
Delays were concentrated in the onshore gas plant construction,
which also inflated the project’s Phase 1 cost by about 20% to almost $1 billion (Aus.).
This puts into question the original total budget for the project
of $1.1 billion, as the Phase 2 connection of Geographe has yet to
begin.

Santos Ltd.-operated Oyang oil and gas field off East Java has
been brought on stream. Production rates are expected to stabilize
at 8,000-10,000 b/d over the next few weeks.
Adelaide-based Santos holds 45% interest, while Cue Energy
Resources, Melbourne, has 15%, and Singapore Petroleum, 40%.
Oil is being produced via a wellhead platform that houses five
oil wells and two gas wells. Oil is processed on the Sea Good 101
production barge and piped to the Shanghai storage and offtake
vessel.
Front-end engineering and design studies to develop Oyang gas
reserves are now well under way, and a final investment decision is
expected before yearend. First gas production is anticipated during
first-half 2009.
Gas will be piped via a 55 km undersea pipeline to an onshore
processing facility to be located adjacent to the existing Grati power station in East Java.
PT Indonesia Power will purchase the gas.
Santos said its nearby Wortel gas field, discovered in 2006 about
7 km west of Oyang, is likely to be incorporated into the gas development program, but that is still subject to further field appraisal,
which is planned for first half 2008.

Initial production, expected to exceed 6,000 b/d, was brought on
2 months ahead of schedule.
Duart field, discovered in 1988, was developed with a single
well tied back to the Tartan platform. Duart oil will be exported via
the Flotta system, together with other Tartan area production.
Prospective reserves of 6 million bbl are assigned to the northern section of the field.
Duart is an integral part of Talisman’s plans to prolong the life
of both the Tartan platform and the Flotta export system.

AGR to drill nine wells in UK North Sea
AGR Group will drill nine wells for various clients in the UK
North Sea under contracts valued at $202.2 million.
AGR will use the Sedco 704 semisubmersible for an eight-well

Motiva Port Arthur reﬁnery expansion to proceed
Motiva Enterprises LLC, Houston, said a final investment decision has been made that allows the company to proceed with a
325,000 b/d expansion of its 285,000 b/cd refinery in Port Arthur, Tex.
The expansion—essentially adding the capacity equivalent to a
new refinery—will increase the refinery’s oil throughput capacity
to 600,000 b/d, making it the largest refinery in the US.
The additional production capacity is expected to be online in
2010.
Motiva selected Bechtel Jacobs joint venture as the project’s engineering, procurement, and construction contractor. Construction
is scheduled to begin this year.

Rajasthan reﬁnery no deterrent to Cairn’s plans
Cairn India and India’s state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corp.
(ONGC), partners in Barmer field in Rajasthan, said they will not
“go slow” in constructing a preheated pipeline to carry the waxy
crude from the field.
This is despite the Rajasthan government’s saying it would build
a refinery to process the oil, making the $750-million pipeline
superfluous.
“The pipeline is the most feasible option and is likely to [be
built] before the start of crude oil production,” said a senior official of ONGC, Cairn’s 30% partner in the oilfield.
He said building a refinery with a capacity of about 7.5 million
tonnes/year “would take around 40 months, whereas work on the
pipeline is expected to take just 18 months,” he said.
A Cairn India executive revealed that 83% of the pipeline engineering design work has been completed and that tenders for
construction would open soon.
The Scottish explorer’s oil discovery in Rajasthan is the largest
in the country since ONGC struck oil in Bombay High in 1972.
Barmer field is expected to produce 150,000 b/d during its 4-year
peak production period.
Although a refinery in Rajasthan would mean another buyer for

es has contracted its Ensco 85 rig for a single well on Block 42/13
in the UK southern North Sea (OGJ Online, Sept. 24, 2007).
Sedco 704 will soon spud its first well following major upgrades to its drilling equipment and accommodation modules. The
rig can operate in harsh environments and in as much as 1,200 ft
of water, using an 183⁄4-in., 15,000 psi blowout preventer and a
21-in. OD marine drilling riser.
With the arrival of the Sedco 704 and Ensco 85 jack ups, AGR is
now operating four drilling units on the UK continental shelf.
This year AGR plans to drill more than 55 wells in northwestern
Europe, North Africa, West Africa, Middle East, the US, and AsiaPacific.
Rigs under management this year include Stena Clyde, Wilcraft, Sedco 704, Bredford Dolphin, Byford Dolphin, Transocean
Prospect, Maersk Giant, Ensco 80, Ensco 85, Ensco 92, Ensco 100,
Ocean Spur, and Noble George Sauvagneau. ✦

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
the company’s crude oil, “we know the economics of the refinery
are dubious,” the Cairn executive said.
ONGC agreed: “There is simply not enough crude oil in the
field to justify a new refinery. The state consumes only 5 million
tonnes/year of oil products. With new refineries coming up in
Bina [in Madhya Pradesh] and Bhatinda [Punjab], there will be no
market for the Rajasthan refinery.
The price of the oil also must be resolved. Its poor quality, Cairn
says, likely will garner the companies about 10% less than the
Brent benchmark. Refiners, however, hope for a discount of more
than 20%. “The contract allows pricing to follow the international
prices of similar oil,” Cairn said.
The pricing will determine how cost-effective a preheated pipeline would be. If Cairn does not get a good price, the gains may not
justify the cost of the pipeline.
A buyer has yet to be finalized, but Cairn executive said talks
were under way “with almost all refineries. The Bhatinda and Bina
refineries are keen on taking our crude oil.”
ONGC said a realistic date for production to begin is yearend
2009.

ExxonMobil to expand Rotterdam aromatics plant
ExxonMobil Chemical Co. plans to expand its Rotterdam aromatics plant in Botlek, the Netherlands, making it the company’s
largest paraxylene production facility.
The expansion will increase the facility’s production capacity by
25% for paraxylene and by 20% for benzene.
Construction is scheduled to begin this year.
The project involves building a heat-exchanger, reactor, and distillation column.
ExxonMobil will use its PxMax technology to produce paraxylene and benzene. The PxMax process improves selectivity, generates less waste, and reduces energy requirements in comparison to
existing technologies.
The expansion project will be owned and operated by ExxonMobil Chemical Holland BV. ✦

Singapore plans Jurong Island LNG terminal

Turkmen gas may ﬂow to Europe, bypassing Russia

Singapore plans to build a $1 billion LNG terminal and regasification plant on a 30-ha site in southwest Jurong Island to diversify
its natural gas imports.
Singapore Power subsidiary PowerGas, designated as majority
owner and operator of the facility, expects to begin construction in
2009 and to have the plant operational by early 2012.
In early September, Singapore Minister of State for Trade and
Industry S. Iswaran said at the LNG Supplies for Asian Markets conference that detailed engineering and construction should start immediately. The project was approved in August 2006.
Singapore, which relies on gas transported from neighboring
Indonesia and Malaysia, is trying to diversify its sources of supply.
Supplier Indonesia, in particular, has less gas to export as it seeks to
meet domestic demand growth (OGJ Online, Mar. 1, 2007).
Iswaran said initial demand is expected to be 1 million tonnes/
year in 2012 when the plant starts operations. It will take 4-5 years
for the contracted LNG quantity to reach 3 million tonnes/year,
he said.
PowerGas, currently in charge of the national gas pipeline grid,
can ensure that the LNG terminal is efficiently integrated with the
system and can help manage periodic gas demand and supply imbalances by adjusting supply from the terminal.
“But we have left the door wide open for other parties, both
local and international, to join in,” Iswaran said, suggesting that
other players could partner with PowerGas as minority stakeholders.
Singapore also has launched a request for proposals from interested parties to bid on becoming the initial sole importer of LNG
into the plant. The importer-consortium (or aggregator) will import an initial 3 million tonnes/year of LNG into the country.
Singapore’s Energy Market Authority will select and appoint the
aggregator from a short list of candidates by second quarter 2008.

Turkmenistan President Gurbanguli Berdymukhamedov said his
country is ready to bypass Russia and begin selling some of its
natural gas to Europe.
After meeting Sept. 19 with Austrian Economic Minister Martin
Bartenstein, Berdymukhamedov said his country, “having multiple
vectors in its energy policy and creating alternative export routes,
including in the southern direction through the Caspian Sea, is
prepared to deliver natural gas to European countries.”
Turkmenistan’s gas exports currently pass through pipelines operated by Russia’s state-run OAO Gazprom, but Berdymukhamedov
suggested that a new pipeline could be built from Turkmen gas
fields to Azerbaijan.

Michael Baker wins federal Alaska gas line contract
Michael Baker Jr. Inc. was the successful bidder for a contract
to assist the federal coordinator’s office in the effort to construct a
natural gas pipeline from Alaska to the Lower 48 states.
The firm has extensive Arctic oil and gas pipeline expertise, said
Drue Pearce, federal coordinator for Alaska natural gas transportation projects, in announcing the award Sept. 12.
Michael Baker will help the federal coordinator’s office establish a local presence in Alaska; develop an information management system to allow federal, state, and Canadian agencies
to share data where appropriate; and help the federal coordinator’s office incorporate lessons learned from construction of the
Trans-Alaska Pipeline System and the former federal inspector’s
office to develop a strategy for constructing the gas pipeline,
she said. ✦

Correction
Russia approves gas production, delivery to Asia
Russia’s Industry and Energy Ministry has approved the Eastern
Gas Program leading to the creation of a unified system for East
Siberia’s natural gas production and delivery to China and other
areas in the Asia-Pacific.
The program will create four gas production centers in Sakhalin, Yakutia (Chayanda field), Irkutsk, and Krasnoyarsk territories,
according to Anatoly Yanovsky, chief of the ministry’s energy policy
department in a Sept. 7 announcement.
Ministry officials said “absolute priority” will be given to meeting domestic needs, while the dates of the fields’ development and
respective exports will depend on the outcome of commercial talks
between the companies involved.
Industry analysts said approval of the ministry’s program guidelines essentially ratifies OAO Gazprom’s plans for the region, including construction of LNG facilities on Sakhalin Island and direction of gas supplies from the ExxonMobil Corp.-led Sakhalin-1
project to the domestic market.

Chesapeake Energy Corp.’s figures for oil and natural
gas reserves and production were incorrectly stated in the
OGJ200 report (OGJ, Sept. 17, 2007, p. 20). Following
are the corrected figures and their respective rankings (in
parentheses): US liquids reserves (in million bbl), 106.0
(21); worldwide liquids reserves, 106.0 (25); US liquids
production, 8.654 (17); worldwide liquids production,
8.654 (20); US natural gas reserves (in bcf), 8,319.4 (4);
worldwide natural gas reserves, 8,319.4 (6); US natural
gas production, 526.5 (6); worldwide natural gas production 526.5 (7). Also in that report, in the Top 20 worldwide liquids reserves table, Marathon Oil Corp. should
have appeared in the No. 9 position with 677.0 million bbl
of liquids reserves. Newfield Exploration Co.’s worldwide
liquids reserves should have been stated as 114.3 million
bbl, ranking them at 22.

Alberta faces decision
Alberta’s government has arrived at a political
intersection that’s becoming too familiar. After
delivery of recommendations from the Alberta
Royalty Review Panel, it must choose between the
market orientation that comes naturally and excess
governance.
The problem isn’t just that the panel wants to
hike the royalty on oil, gas, and oil sands, beyond
anyone’s expectations (OGJ, Sept. 10, 2007, p. 17).
It’s that the recommendations shove energy politics in a vital producing region sharply leftward.

Oil sands hit
Royalty reform under the panel’s recommendations would hit bitumen from oil sands harder
than it would conventional oil and gas, largely
through imposition of an “oil sands severance
tax.” In all three categories, the proposals would
raise the total government “take”—the share of
profits claimed by federal and provincial governments through royalty and taxes. The increases: to
64% from 47% for oil sands, to 49% from 44%
for conventional oil, and to 63% from 58% for
natural gas.
Government take, the panel says, “can be increased with Alberta still remaining an attractive
investment destination.” The important question is
whether Alberta would be anywhere near as attractive an investment destination if it hiked royalty
to the extent proposed as it would be if it left well
enough alone.
The answer, of course, is no. By the panel’s
estimates, Alberta would collect about $2 billion/
year more in total royalties under its proposals at
current prices and production rates than it would
under the status quo—an increase of 20%. This
is money that can’t be invested in oil, gas, and
oil sands projects, costs of which are soaring. It’s
about 12% of the investment projected this year
in oil sands and 7% of forecast capital spending in
conventional oil and gas. The Edinburgh consultancy Wood Mackenzie estimates that the recommendations would slash the net present value of
current and planned oil sands projects by $26
billion (OGJ Online, Sept. 25, 2007).
That seems not to concern the review panel.
“Albertans do not receive their fair share from
energy development,” it asserts. “The royalty rates
and formulas have not kept pace with changes
in the resource base and world energy markets.”

Analysis proceeds from there, scarcely noticing
such other changes as rising costs and toughening
environmental regulation.
The panel reveals much about its orientation by
linking Albertans’ interests exclusively with provincial royalty receipts, as though wealth confers
no advantage until it passes through government
hands. In fact, Albertans benefit greatly from oil
and gas production under the existing royalty
regime. The finance ministry notes that oil and
gas account for 20-50% of the Albertan economy,
depending on industry definitions and economic
measures. And the economy has been growing
nicely. Last year Alberta’s gross domestic product
increased 6.8%, highest among Canadian provinces and territories. The projection this year is for
growth of 4.1%, second behind Newfoundland.
The ministry estimates Canadian GDP growth in
both years at 2.7%.
A royalty hike certain to discourage oil and
gas investment would slow Alberta’s economic
growth. To gloss over economic effects and focus
on royalty-rate comparisons is to overlook much
of importance to Albertans.

Transparency charges
Similarly suspect are allegations about accountability lapses. “The panel is unanimous in
declaring that Albertans do not presently enjoy a
transparent and readily evaluated royalty regime
for oil and gas,” the report declares, specifically
criticizing governmental performance and industry compliance. These are serious charges. But
they’re supported only by vague complaints about
answers the panel sought but didn’t receive from
the Department of Energy, isolated numbers it
couldn’t reconcile, cost data it couldn’t find, and a
consultant’s worries about record-keeping that the
panel didn’t have time to investigate.
To the contrary, facts about Alberta’s oil and gas
industry have never been difficult to find. Maybe
the accounting system strains under pressures of
heavy activity. That can be fixed. But the sweeping
claim about transparency is overstatement. Responding with a new level of bureaucracy would
be overkill.
The panel’s report is a blueprint for bigger
government and slower economic growth. Albertans should hope it dies at the recommendation
stage. ✦

Oil and gas companies in growing numbers are issuing sustainability
reports in response to demand for information on corporate governance and
risk-mitigation.
Shareholders and industry observers
expect companies to disclose business
risks involving the environment, labor,
human rights, other social issues, and
anticorruption measures. Nonfinancial
sustainability reports sometimes
accompany
annual reports
and financial
statements.
Accountants
told OGJ that
corporate social responsibility initiatives
are responsible for generating sustainability reports, which disclose a wide
range of information that varies widely
between companies and also between
countries.
Xavier Houot, a partner with Ernst &
Young India in sustainability advisory
services, said corporate disclosure of

anymore. “Today, with increased emphasis on corporate governance across
the world, with the appearance of new
risks, the multiple forms of transparency and mitigating activities required
have become a part of life,” Houot said.
“The world expects a proactive approach to sustainability from the corporate community and is concerned about
environmental, climatic, labor, social,
and other developmental challenges.”
Statistics compiled by CorporateRegister.com Ltd., an online directory of
corporate social responsibility and
sustainability reports, indicate 99 oil
and gas companies reported in 2006
compared with 26 in 1996.
In a 2006 joint report, KPMG and
the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) said more than half of
the top 250 companies in the Fortune
500 list produce sustainability reports,
with 75% of them citing economic
reasons for the reports.
A separate study from CorporateRegister.com in 2007 shows 234 of the
world’s largest 300 companies produce
a corporate nonfinancial report.

Oil and gas companies issue sustainability reports to communicate their
progress on nonfinancial aspects of
corporate performance.

“However, these requirements
remain largely fragmented and in most
cases do not fit an integrated strategy to regulate sustainability reporting,” KPMG-UNEP said. “Quite often
laws were promulgated without any
reference to sustainability reporting,
yet—after the fact—such laws can be
classified as a legal requirement for
sustainability reporting because of the
nature of the issues addressed.”
Sustainability reporting varies considerably between companies and also
between countries.

Reporting incentives
Speaking before the Sustainability Summit Asia 2006 in New Delhi,
Ernst & Young’s Houot said India has

stakeholders’ confidence for Indian
companies operating abroad that want
to be perceived as meeting the same
standards as their global peers, he said,
adding that the practice also attracts
socially responsible investors.
“It is the right time for Indian
companies to seize the opportunity and
adopt reporting practices,” Houot said.
“And why? What does not get reported
does not get improved. What gets measured can be benchmarked, compared,
improved, verified, and audited.”
McGhee said the reporting history
in the oil and gas industry has been
characterized by a rapid evolution from
single issue reporting, such as environmental issues only, to comprehensive
multiple-issue reports covering social,
environmental, and ethical issues in one
document.
CorporateRegister.com reports that
over 90% of the oil and gas company
reports produced so far this year are
multiple-issue reports.

Last year, Jantzi Research Inc. of
Toronto released a report entitled “Oil
and Gas in a Bull Market: The Shifting
Sands of Responsibility.” The report
examined 23 oil companies worldwide
on environmental issues, human rights,
and other social issues.
That report ranked companies on
their social and environmental performance, saying the top performers were
dominated by European and Canadian
companies. BP PLC received the highest
score.
Jantzi rated companies on four
categories: environment, community
and society, human rights, and health
and safety. The environment category
was broken down into subcategories.
Emphasis was given to corporate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
“Many US oil and gas companies
are only in the beginning stages of
acknowledging climate change as a
corporate concern and business issue,”
the Jantzi report said. ✦

Companies adapt to expanded responsibility reporting
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
Oil and gas companies are updating
their tools for reporting environmental, health, and safety (EHS), and social
issues.
This move is necessary as companies
expand their corporate social responsibility (CSR) or sustainability reports.
Philippe Tesler, cofounder of EHS
software provider Enablon, estimates
that at least one third of oil companies
worldwide have outdated nonfinancial reporting systems. He believes all
companies will have either revamped
or replaced their CSR and EHS management software by 2010.
“Companies who don’t keep up will
be less competitive and will not meet
customer expectations,” he told OGJ.

It’s intended as a voluntary reference

“A few years ago, customers were

said. “Customers now are requiring

Of a move toward standardized
metrics, Tesler said, “The current stage
is comparable metrics—how do I compare one company with another one?”

Chavez unveils
a new whopper

A

few weeks ago, we wondered if
oil diplomacy was driving Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez over
the edge. Back then, we noted that
Chavez compared himself with Jesus,
telling fellow leaders in the Caribbean that his country would supply
them with oil at preferential rates
(OGJ, Aug. 20, 2007, p. 34).
Chavez’s boasting continues, with
more recent claims that his government is launching the socialist gas
revolution. According to Chavez,
Venezuela possesses 80% of South
America’s gas reserves and 30% of
the gas reserves in the Americas.
Recently Chavez said his administration would invest $18 billion to
expand gas production to 11 bcfd
over the next 5 years from 7 bcfd
(OGJ Online, Sept. 19, 2007). Touting his country’s assets, Chavez said

On Sept. 21 OPEC, according to the
latest figures on its web site, reduced
Venezuela’s ceiling by a whopping
24% to 2.47 million b/d—a lot lower
than the 3.22 million b/d allocation the country had before the most
recent OPEC meeting in early September. That added powerful weight
to analysts, such the International
Energy Agency, that have long said that
Venezuela’s production figure of 3

Producers cautious about Alberta royalty proposals
The Canadian oil and gas producing industry is responding cautiously
to recommendations for large royalty
increases in Alberta.
The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers labeled as “flawed” the
recommendations of the Alberta Royalty
Review Panel, which was established in
February (OGJ, Sept. 10, 2007, p. 17).
“We are committed to staying focused on the facts and working constructively with government throughout this process,” said CAPP Pres. Pierre
Alvarez.
The panel made its recommendations, which include a new layer of
royalty on rapidly growing production
from Alberta’s oil sands, to Alberta Minister of Finance Lyle Oberg.
“The basic assumption is that the
size of the ‘pie’ will not change,” Alvarez said. “Past experience, in this country and around the world, just doesn’t
support the panel’s view.”
The changes would raise the total
government take—the federal and
provincial governments’ share of total
profits from royalty and taxes—to 64%
from the current 47% for oil sands, to
49% from 44% for conventional oil,
and to 63% from 58% for natural gas.

Wood Mackenzie Ltd., Edinburgh,
estimated that if implemented in full,
the changes would cut the net present
value of current and planned oil sands
projects, discounted at 10%/year with a
long-term Brent crude price of $50/
bbl, by $26 billion.
“The higher than expected level of
new taxation will cause concern among
oil sands industry players already struggling to cope with spiraling costs,” said
Derek Butter, WoodMac head of corporate analysis. “This will further raise the
already high economic break-even price
of these projects, significantly raising
the level of risk on what are huge initial
capital outlays.
In addition to restructuring the
Albertan oil and gas royalty regime, the
panel recommended that the provincial
government “implement the means to
gather and assess the workings of all
aspects of revenue policy and collection
associated with energy resources in the
province.” This, it said, could take the
form of a “super-ministry” or deputy
leader reporting directly to the premier.
While the proposed accountability function would be expensive, the
panel said, “The lack of having such a
capability has had consequences that, in

the panel’s view, have been very costly
along several dimensions.”
It said a “data vacuum” and “seeming absence of oversight” became
“obvious” during its review.

Major changes
Among the panel’s major recommendations is an oil sands severance
tax (OSST), applied at a rate of 1-9%,
depending on the price of crude oil,
beyond royalty.
The panel also recommended raising
the net royalty rate after payout on oil
sands production to 33% from 25% and
adding a royalty credit based on 5% of
the cost of upgrading facilities built in
Alberta.
For conventional oil and gas production, the panel recommended generic
royalty formulas based on production
and prices.
Under the recommendations, royalty
rates on small wells would decline
while those on more prolific wells
would rise.
CAPP pointed out that, at prices
expected over the next year, all gas wells
would pay higher royalties, “which will
only make the current drilling downturn worse.” ✦

UK oil industry expected to survive credit squeeze
Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
The UK oil and gas industry likely
will survive the credit squeeze in the
financial markets, a senior banker said
in London, adding that the industry is
important and cyclical.
Steve Mills, senior director of oil and
gas project and export finance at the

Royal Bank of Scotland, cautioned that
it was still early to judge the full impact
of the credit squeeze, but if there is
a reduction in capital, people have a
“good case to make that the UK has a
great record in oil and gas.”
Speaking at a breakfast meeting
looking at successful entrants in the UK
North Sea, he said, “I feel the banks will
ride this comfortably because it is long-

term and it’s about regular cash flows.”
As major international oil companies
reduce interests in the mature UK North
Sea to look for larger fields elsewhere,
new entrants are important players in
the basin because there is an estimated
20-25 billion boe yet to be produced,
said Mills. Since the 1990s, new entrants on the UK Continental Shelf have
contributed 40% of the investment and

controlled 20% of the production there,
according to trade association Oil and
Gas UK.
However, new companies require
money, assets, and people to build a
successful business in the UK North Sea,
and smaller entrants have more difficulty
raising equity. Debt is available to operators, but small assets reduce senior debt
capacity, Mills added, saying that abandonment guarantees erode debt capacity
or use it inefficiently. Operators must
have field-development plans in place
if they are to secure bank capital. Rising
costs—a general industry trend—are
also a serious challenge, Mills said.
For Mike Wagstaff, chief executive
of UK-based Venture Production PLC,
which focuses on the UK North Sea,
implementing gas projects has become
challenging because of low gas prices
compared with oil prices. “Cost pro-

duction is acute,” he said at the seminar.
Venture recently tested gas production
from its Chiswick gas field in the UK
southern North Sea (OGJ Online, Sept.
19, 2007). “To get to the [gas-prone]
southern North Sea, we need to do
things differently to get costs down. The
price of gas in the UK now is not as bad
as thought at the New Year, [but] gas is
over half of our business, and so we are
concerned about it.”
As demand for contractors’ services soars in light of high commodity
prices, contractors charge operators more,
increasing operational costs. Wagstaff
criticized current contractor practices as
inefficient, calling for the industry and
contractors to “rip up the way they do
things.” Nevertheless, “contractors here
are not making the margins that they
should be,” Wagstaff added. “The net unit
cost in the Gulf of Mexico is lower and

contractors there make bigger margins.”
Mergers of companies listed on
the Alternative Investment Market in
London have not occurred as quickly as
was anticipated, as they vie to develop
projects in the North Sea and raise
finance, said Ernst & Young. But Venture
Production in August offered to buy
Wham Energy PLC because it has gas
exploration assets in the UK southern
North Sea.
At the seminar Wagstaff said that in
a mature and consolidating industry,
it is necessary to have size and scale to
maximize resources. “I think consolidation will happen to bring down costs,”
he added. “I sympathize with AIM companies—it was difficult to access capital
in 2004-05, and we’re paying the price
for that now. There is a tendency to
underprice risk, and [the results] will
be painful.” ✦

European Commission’s energy legislation faces opposition
Doris Leblond
OGJ Correspondent
With its third legislative package on
energy revealed Sept. 19, the European
Commission is tackling head-on the
nine countries opposed to ownership
unbundling—the crux of its policy
to open up energy markets to greater
competition.
Nine countries oppose the proposed
legislation that would separate the
network operation of electricity and gas
from supply and generation activities.
Aware that this will require “long
and arduous negotiations” with countries expressing strong opposition to the
measure, the commission has offered an
alternative option. It is “the independent
system operator” (ISO) system whereby
integrated companies are given the option of retaining network ownership,
provided their assets are operated by a
fully independent company.
Implementation of ISO, however,
is so complex and requires such close
monitoring by energy regulators that
unbundling opponents do not see it as
a satisfactory alternative.
Energy Commissioner Andris Pielbalgs insisted that both unbundling
options would boost investment in new
infrastructure, interconnection, and
generation capacity, an argument refuted by large integrated companies such
as Gaz de France, Electricite de France,
E.On, which are generally backed by
their governments.
As soon as ISO was announced,
French, German, and Austrian governments opened fire against the measure,
which would dismantle their energy
champions. In France, Finance Minister
Christine Lagarde said the government
would retain a blocking 35% minority
interest in the recently merged Gaz de
France-Suez group and a golden share
to “be able to counter the sale of any
of Gaz de France’s assets in France,”
including gas infrastructure.
28

Opponents to unbundling argue that
competition and transparency in energy
markets can be achieved through greater regulatory control and the increased
clout and independence of National
Energy Regulators, measures that are
already in the energy package.
However, the commission’s proposal
to go further and set up an Agency for
the Cooperation of National Energy
Regulators that would have binding
decision and controlling powers, is not
meeting with enthusiastic acceptance.
Intended to facilitate cross-border trade,
the agency would oversee the application of community regulations but
would also act as watchdog over network operators, namely the ISOs, and
would be able to apply sanctions.
The countries do welcome the
energy package’s safeguards against
the influence of non-EU countries that
would try to assume control over an
EU network. With an obvious eye on
Gazprom and security of gas supplies,
the commission has provided that
companies from non-EU countries will
“have to demonstrably and unequivocally comply with the same unbundling
requirements as EU companies” to
ensure a level playing field.
Subject to international obligations,
the commission would be able to block
any purchaser “which cannot demonstrate both its direct and indirect independence from supply and generation
activities.” This measure is in answer
to growing concerns in the EU that if
ownership unbundling of transport
networks is pushed too far in the EU,

it could harm supply security should
these networks be acquired by nonEU buyers. It provides a sticky frame
for Gazprom and Sonatrach, which are
aiming to be operators on downstream
gas distribution in some EU countries.
With the proposed energy package
covering unbundling, regulatory oversight and cooperation, network cooperation, transparency, and record keeping,
it is no wonder it has been met with
comments both for and against it and
has received no overall approval.
Ian Colin Lyle, chairman of the European Federation of Energy Traders’ gas
committee, was critical of the Agency
for the Cooperation of National Energy
regulators. He said he was unconvinced
that the way “to deal with the inconsistencies in the operation of the EU gas
grid” was to create a 27-member state
gas Transmission System Operators,
with the expectation that they would
spontaneously produce market-friendly
reforms and harmonization measures.

not be carried out to the detriment of

Chesapeake Energy Corp., which has
the industry’s largest land position in
US gas resource plays, plans to shoot
3,100 sq miles of 3D seismic surveys at
a cost of $168 million in 2007-08, said
Larry Lunardi, the company’s vice-president of geophysics since June 2006.
Chesapeake’s 3D seismic surveys
on the sprawling 18,000-acre DallasFort Worth International Airport and
in surrounding urban areas has found
less extensive faulting than expected, a
hazard to horizontal drilling for gas in
the Barnett shale, Lunardi said.
The 60,000-lb. Vibroseis trucks
posed no problems for the airport’s
17-in.-thick aprons and runways, and
gas withdrawal is not expected to result
in subsidence because the shales are so
tight, Lundari said.
The company is using microseismic
techniques to monitor frac jobs and is
tying microseismic information into its
3D seismic surveys.
Chesapeake has acquired 600 sq

miles of airborne gravity gradiometry
surveys in the Arkansas Fayetteville shale
gas play and has found it helpful when
combined with magnetic data, Lunardi
said.
He foresees a wide role for geophysical methods because many of the gas
shale plays Chesapeake is pursuing have
wide vertical and lateral variability over
short distances.

Improved techniques
Geophysical techniques will help
the industry exploit smaller offshore
fields, including nonturbiditic accumulations and “light” reservoirs, said J.M.
Masset, Total SA senior vice-president,
exploration and reservoir. Geophysical techniques are needed to improve
oil recovery from offshore fields by as
much as 20 percentage points, he said.
Improvements in seismic resolution
are needed to enhance reservoir quality
prediction and reduce the loss of energy
at depth.

Electromagnetic techniques, when
combined with seismic surveys, are
helping companies map and characterize tar sand and heavy oil deposits, said
Sverre Strandenes, group president, data
processing and technology, Petroleum
Geo-Services ASA.
He said the lead time for many
research projects from initial idea to
widespread commercial application
is 16 years. Service companies are
outspending major oil companies in
research, and the overall industry needs
to be more aggressive, Strandenes said.

Gas hydrates
The US Geological Survey has estimated 320,000 tcf of gas in place in
hydrates in the US Exclusive Economic
Zone, said Ray Boswell, a geologist with
the US Department of Energy’s National
Energy Technology Laboratory. This is
estimated to be one fourth to one half
of the earth’s volume of total organic
carbon.

Gas in hydrates have proved to be
detectable when they lie beneath permafrost, when their saturation is 50%
or more, and when the reservoir is 25
ft thick or more, Boswell said. Bottom
simulating reflectors have not proved as

important as first thought but are still
key objectives in geophysical exploration for hydrates.
Seven US government agencies are
probing hydrates. DOE hopes to have
completed research information pack-

by 2025. It plans to drill into hydrate
deposits on Alaminos Canyon Block 818
and other Gulf of Mexico sites in 2008,

IOGCC: EPA to measure VOCs from oil, gas ﬁelds
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
US state and federal air quality and
environmental agencies are contemplating how to better estimate and measure
the level of volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) emissions coming from oil and
gas production facilities.
Bill Harnett, director of the air quality policy division of the US Environmental Protection Agency, outlined
these efforts during a Sept. 24 speech
to the Interstate Oil & Gas Compact
Commission annual meeting in New
Orleans.
VOCs can contribute to ground-level
ozone levels. The EPA Office of Air and
Radiation is considering a partnership
with oil companies and environmental
agencies of western states to conduct
field tests that could start next year in
two or three states that have yet to be
determined.
The federal government probably

will provide the initial funding, which
Harnett estimates at $400,000 at least.
Initial tests are likely to be in Colorado,
Wyoming, or New Mexico.
The plan is to bag or tent possible
sources of emissions and to measure
the emissions over a number of days
yet to be determined, he said. The process will be similar to emissions tests
already done at refineries and chemical
plants.
A draft methodology would be developed and distributed to the industry
for comment. Testing will be primarily
for VOC emissions leaking from equipment on production sites. Thousands of
wells are being drilled or are scheduled
to be drilled in the western US.

Better estimates needed
Harnett said regulators working on
air quality models need better emissions estimates from oil and gas production. Another goal is to determine if
oil and gas production is in compliance

with federal and state standards, particularly in existing nonattainment areas
under the National Ambient Air Quality
Standard.
The US Bureau of Land Management
needs better air emissions estimates
to assess the possible environmental
impacts of proposed leasing, he said.
Information is needed from multiple
states, fields, and from different types of
equipment.
“We will be asking industry how to
gather the best data of the greatest use
to all,” Harnett told IOGCC.
Recently, representatives of six states
met with EPA and BLM representatives
in Pinedale, Wyo., to discuss how to
better estimate and measure emissions
from oil and gas facilities, Harnett said.
That technical meeting was hosted
by the Western States Air Resources
Council, an organization representing
15 western states. Initial emissions field
tests would not measure for greenhouse
gas emissions. ✦

addressed guidance for a regulatory
framework, but the task force did not
address emissions trading.
“Following conservation, geologic
storage of CO2 is among the most
immediate and viable strategies for
mitigating the release of CO2 into the
atmosphere,” Bengal said. “We envision that the report will result in a
substantially consistent system for the
geological storage of CO2 regulated at
the state and provincial level in conformance with national and international
law.”
Representatives of the US Environmental Protection Agency were observers of the task force, which worked for
4 years on the framework. The report
suggests a “cradle-to-grave” method of
regulatory CO2 oversight, with the state
being the proposed long-term caretaker.
Scott Anderson, an energy policy

specialist for Environmental Defense
and an observer to the task force, said

rigorous. Anderson is with the Environmental Defense office in Austin.
“The IOGCC model rules will certainly be subject to revision as they are

CFTC’s timely
look at markets

US GAO to study reﬁning
capacity, gasoline prices
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent

A

t a time when energy issues
supposedly had moved into the
background in Washington, DC, the
US Commodity Trading Futures Commission quietly held a timely—some
might say overdue—hearing.
The Sept. 18 event basically examined whether more oil and gas commodity markets need to be regulated.
Several currently are not.
“In 2000, Congress created a
tiered regulatory structure for the
futures markets with passage of the
Commodity Futures Modernization
Act (CFMA). This calibrated structure
has provided regulators with the
proper flexibility and focus as we
strive to keep pace with this industry’s global growth,” acting CFTC
Chairman Walter L. Lukken said in his
opening statement.
Energy markets have changed
dramatically in 7 years, and CFTC’s
regulation should evolve as well, he
said. While exempt commodity markets (ECMs) have increased competition and lowered costs for derivatives
trading, “certain ECMs now function
as virtual substitutes [for] regulated
exchanges with tight correlation and
linking of prices,” Lukken said.

Different products
Witnesses said that the largest
energy ECM, the Inter-Continental
Exchange (ICE), developed as an
electronic trading alternative to the
New York Mercantile Exchange’s
open outcry trading. NYMEX Pres.
James E. Newsome noted that the
nation’s largest regulated commodities exchange has developed its own
electronic trading, which now is its
main trading mechanism. Currently
exempt markets that function like
32

traditional exchanges and link prices
to their products should be regulated,
he said.
Jeffrey C. Sprecher, ICE’s chairman and chief executive, said the
exchange offers regulated futures
and unregulated over-the-counter
contracts.
Regulation may be appropriate for
some of its cleared OTC contracts,
such as its Henry Hub swap contract,
that settle on a futures market contract price and are the true economic
equivalent of an actively traded
futures contract, he said.
But ICE also offers much less-liquid OTC products that do not fit that
definition. “The level of regulation
should fit the market in question,”
Sprecher said.

Speculators’ role
Some energy market critics charge
that speculators make prices more
volatile. Natural Gas Supply Association Pres. R. Skip Horvath disagreed.
“In general, participation by
speculative traders serves to further
balance the supply-demand question via higher-risk market positions,
which those interested in producing or consuming natural gas often
do not wish to take. If it were not
for such speculators, who actually
smooth out delivered commodity
prices over time and geography, price
volatility could, most likely, be even
greater,” he said.
Many other questions were raised.
The hearing probably won’t be the
final word on the subject, especially
if gas and heating oil prices soar this
winter. ✦

The US Government Accountability
Office has agreed to examine relationships between refining capacity and
gasoline prices and demand in response
to requests from Connecticut’s congressional delegation and from US Sen.
Charles E. Schumer (D-NY).
GAO received the two requests in
mid-May and plans to merge them into
a single inquiry to begin later this fall
when qualified staff members are available, Gloria L. Jarmon, managing director for congressional relations, said in a
Sept. 24 letter to Rep. Joseph Courtney
(D-Conn.).
“Our nation’s refiners have operated
with little oversight for decades and
have suffered little recourse for repeated
outages and downtime,” Courtney said
in a joint announcement with other
senators.
In their letter to GAO Comptroller
General David A. Walker requesting an
investigation, the delegation expressed
skepticism that deferred maintenance
led to reduced refinery utilization early
in 2007 and suggested that “a calculated decrease in refining capacity could
create an artificial shortage and drive up
the cost to consumers.”
The National Petrochemical &
Refiners Association immediately took
issue with the delegation’s request.
“Economists and national editorial
pages have even warned Congress
against passing so-called ‘price gouging’ legislation,” said NPRA Executive
Vice-Pres. Charles T. Drevna.
“The American public could be
far better served if its elected officials
would work with businesses instead
of against them to craft a sensible
and realistic energy policy to protect
consumers by keeping supplies stable,”
he said. ✦

The oil sands of Alberta are undergoing an investment boom worth more than
$100 billion. From 2007 to 2016, the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board
(EUB) projects total real investment in Alberta’s oil sands (surface mining,
upgrading, in situ, and support services to reach Canadian $118 billion.
Output from oil sands is set to rise from about 1.2 million barrels a day to
an expected 3 million b/d by 2016, and perhaps 4 million plus by 2020.
That could make Canada the world’s fourth-biggest oil producer after Saudi
Arabia, Russia and the United States.
Today’s oil pricing levels have made extraction of oil from oil sands much
more attractive than in the past. The reserves in Alberta will support
production for a least the next century. Canada is the new frontier in nonOPEC oil developments.
Don’t miss this opportunity to present your expertise to a powerful, inﬂuential
audience. Join PennWell Petroleum Events in this second year conference and
exhibition. As the boom continues, share your ideas, experiences, technology,
and expertise with major industry players who must react quickly to the rapid
expansion. Plan to present a technical paper at the the second annual Oil Sands
and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition, July 15 – 17, 2008, at
the Calgary TELUS Convention Centre in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

Major questions remain over the
enduring legitimacy of production
sharing contracts being signed by Iraq’s
Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG).
According to Iraq’s draft federal petroleum law, the Kurdistan PSCs require
Baghdad’s endorsement, but federal
Iraq has been unable to enact its own
legislation. The prospect of the KRG
deriving revenue from oil production
is clouded by the
fact that large-scale
exports depend on
pipelines owned
and operated by
the national oil
company.

Iraq licensing situation ﬂuid
as Kurdistan awards blocks

Nevertheless, early drilling on at
least two of the PSCs appears to have
established world class oil reserves and
grabbed the notice of greater industry
in a way not previously attained, said
Wood Mackenzie consultants, Edinburgh, UK.
“Kurdish oil assets, which previously
were thought to have limited capacity,
are being proven by DNO, Genel Enerji
and Addax to be prolific, regionally
significant assets and not necessarily the
poor relations to more established fields
in the south of Iraq,” Wood Mackenzie
said in a September research report.

Kurdistan developments
The KRG in Erbil has several more
contracts ready for signature soon,
noted Wood Mackenzie.
DNO ASA, Oslo, has already begun
test production from Tawke oil field
near Dihok north of Mosul (OGJ Online, Aug. 27, 2007).
DNO started extended test production from Tawke in June and reported
output of 5,800 b/d in July and 6,900
b/d in August. The oil is trucked to the
domestic market. DNO said it is entitled
to all produced oil from Tawke, net after
royalty, until it has recovered all project
costs to date.
Meanwhile, Genel Energi AS and
Addax Petroleum Corp. have tested appraisal wells at high rates in Taq Taq field
east of Kirkuk (OGJ Online, Sept. 6,
2007). Oil in place has been estimated
at 1.2-2.7 billion bbl, and reserves are
expected to exceed 250 million bbl.
A development plan for Taq Taq
involves a $1 billion-plus capital investment and a production plateau of
more than 200,000 b/d and should be
submitted in late 2007.
Dana Gas, Sharjah, UAE, won a service contract in April 2007 to appraise
and develop Kormor and Chemchemal
gas fields south of Taq Taq (OGJ Online,
Apr. 25, 2007). Each field is believed
capable of delivering several hundred
million cubic feet of gas a day.
Hunt Oil Co. and Impulse Energy Corp., both private entities, were
awarded a PSC on unspecified acreage in
the Dihok area in September 2007 (OGJ
Online, Sept. 14, 2007). The area is not
believed to contain any proved reserves.
Drilling could begin in 2008.
KRG’s announcement of the award
to Hunt and Impulse said that “revenues from this Kurdistan petroleum
development will be shared by the KRG
throughout Iraq, consistent with the
Iraq constitution and the new oil and
gas law of the Kurdistan Region.”

The uptake
The Hunt-Impulse contract maintains the momentum of the KRG’s
licensing policy and expresses KRG’s

“frustration at the lack of progress
toward a consensual oil and gas law,
which would allow it to proceed with
licensing and oil field developments in
concert with the federal authorities,”
Wood Mackenzie noted.
Kurdistan’s parliament approved its
own regional oil and gas law in August
2007, and authorities outlined plans to
offer 40 exploration blocks for competitive bidding.
“This raises the prospect of Kurdistan
progressing the exploration and development of its oil and gas assets well

ahead of the rest of Iraq,” the Wood
Mackenzie report said.
The Iraq Oil Ministry under Hussein
al-Shahristani could exclude companies that do business in Kurdistan from
participating in larger developments in
southern Iraq.
“This may become less of a deterrent
as concerns grow over southern Iraq’s
political future,” the consultant said.
KRG pointed out that the Hunt-Impulse PSC is consistent with Kurdistan’s
petroleum law and with the draft
federal oil and gas law promulgated in
early 2007. ✦

Conventional targets sought in Palo Duro basin
Palo Duro Energy Inc., Vancouver,
BC, said it is preparing an exploration
program for fall in the Palo Duro basin
using proprietary electromagnetic technologies.
Drilling will target Pennsylvanian
and Permian reefs similar to those that
have produced oil and gas at Wolf Flat
and Gupton fields in Motley County,
Tex. The company said the reefs are
interpreted as forming along ancestral
shelf margins of Canyon, Cisco, and
Wolfcamp ages that developed in the
central Palo Duro basin.
Other potential targets are Pennsylvanian (Atoka) quartz sandstones, such
as those that yield gas at Rhombochasm
field on trend with Palo Duro Energy’s
acreage (OGJ, June 8, 2001, p. 32).
The sands are interpreted to have
been shed from the Amarillo-Wichita
and Red River uplifts.
The company expects structural and
stratigraphic traps. Source rocks are
anticipated to be the underlying Lower
Pennsylvanian (Atoka) shales being
evaluated as fractured shale reservoirs in

the Palo Duro basin by several companies, including Palo Duro Energy’s partner, Bankers Petroleum Corp., Calgary.
Important shows and test rates have
been encountered from many wells
drilled in the Bend shale play in the past
several years.
Numerous exploratory wells have
encountered gas and oil shows in both
the limestone formations and channelized sandstones, which indicates that
the hydrocarbons generated from the
Pennsylvanian shales have migrated
along pathways, such as faults and
fractures, into the younger rocks, the
company said.
Palo Duro Energy is exploring for
the traps that would have had sufficient
sealing conditions to contain the hydrocarbons. The company is optimistic that
the conventional prospects have large
unrealized potential and will supplement the Bend shale resource play.
Palo Duro Energy, with an operations
office in Houston, holds 27% interest in
more than 400,000 net acres in the Palo
Duro basin. ✦

Powder River wells to target oil in Mowry shale
Brigham Exploration Co., Austin, has
formed a new Wyoming joint venture
and signed a letter of intent for a work
program to explore and develop more

than 240,000 gross acres of deep rights
with multipay potential, including the
Cretaceous Mowry shale, in the southeastern Powder River basin.

recently renovated and
upgraded two arctic-class
mobile drilling units
to evaluate some of its
Drilling
Beaufort Sea leases.
Now Shell is leading the way back to the North American Arctic. Although it’s an expensive
place to work, higher prices justify the
reentry, the
company
told OGJ in
a series of
exclusive
interviews.
Shell was
able to utilize
vessels of the design originally used for
the Canadian Arctic by Dome Petroleum
in the 1970s. Dome’s subsidiary CanMar built three drillships and the SDC
drilling barge. Gulf Canada Resources
subsequently built the Kulluk conical

work. In 1989-1991, Shell worked in
the US Chukchi Sea using Canadian
equipment.
In this latest round of work, Shell
added newer technology to older vessels in order to meet higher environmental standards and enhance performance and flexibility. The Shell Kulluk
drilling platform now waits in waters
off the Northwest Territories and the
Frontier Discoverer drillship has been
standing by in Dutch Harbor (1,500 mi
away in Alaska’s Aleutian Is.) for permission to drill in the US Beaufort.

Planning
The US Department of the Interior’s
Minerals Management Service developed a 5-year plan for the Beaufort Sea,
2002-07, to include three oil and gas
lease sales: Sale 186 in September 2003,
Sale 195 in March 2005, and Sale 202
in March 2007.
The MMS ultimately awarded Shell
Offshore 84 leases in the Beaufort Sea,
off Alaska, based on the company’s bids

(Fig. 2; photo from Shell

Shell’s drilling engineering manager in
Anchorage, said not many drilling units
were available to work in arctic conditions as severe as those in the Beaufort
Sea. In 2002, Shell initially considered
four:
• Two CanMar Explorer drillships
stacked in Singapore.
• The SDC bottom-founded drilling
barge, stacked at Herschel Island, west
of the Mackenzie River delta and owned
by Norway’s Seatankers Ltd.
• The Kulluk drilling barge, stacked
in McKinley Bay, east of the Mackenzie

when the temperatures range from
–20ºF to 50ºF.
The Discoverer is turret-moored,
with a symmetric, eight-point anchor
pattern.
Thrusters allow the ship to rotate
around the turret and face the bow into
ice or weather.
The ship’s draft during transit is 8.02

the mean lightship draft is 5.8 m.
The 22.2-m octagonal helideck sits

In January 2006, the companies
signed another contract for Frontier to
manage and operate the Kulluk for Shell
Offshore. The primary term of both
contracts is for 3 years, from July 2007,
with one 5-year, optional extension.
The renovation work on the Kulluk was accomplished in place, off
Canada, in McKinley Bay. The Kulluk
was supplied from Inuvik, Northwest
Territories, by deHavilland Twin Otter
planes using an ice runway, complete
with windsock and lights. By May, the
runway was abandoned because of the
spring thaw; crew and equipment were
flown to Tuktoyaktuk, where they transited to the rig transited to the rig.

Discoverer drillship
The original hull of the Frontier Discoverer drillship, a Sonat Offshore Drilling Discoverer Class vessel, was built in
1965 at Namura Zonshno shipyard in
Osaka, Japan. The ship was converted to
a drillship in 1976 at Avondale Shipyards in New Orleans.
Frontier Drilling AS hired Aker
Arctic in Helsinki to do the hull design
and modelling required to upgrade the
Discoverer hull for arctic operations.
Frontier coordinated the work, which
included adding sponsons to stiffen
the hull, internally strengthening the
bow, and adding heat tracing and insulation to exposed lines.

The Kulluk arctic floating drilling
platform is shaped like a large, conical donut (Fig. 2). It was designed for
Gulf Canada Resources Inc.’s Beaufort
Sea drilling system division by Earl and
Wright Consulting Engineers in San
Francisco and Lavalin. It was built in
1982 by Mitsui Engineering & Shipbuilding Co. Ltd., at Tamano Works,
Japan.
Gulf Canada commissioned the
purpose-built vessel to extend the drilling season in the Beaufort. It was part
of a fleet of six vessels operated by the
company’s arctic subsidiary, BeauDril.
The conical-shaped hull is nearly
circular in plan view and was designed
to deflect ice downward (Fig. 3a). It has
24 compartments, forming 24 sides,
and a double hull and bottom to prevent hull breaches and pollution.1 The
12-point mooring system was designed
to resist the force of 4 ft of ice moving
in any direction (Table 2).
Gulf Canada used the Kulluk to drill
12 wells at 7 locations in the Beaufort
Sea from 1983-93, in 20-50 m water
depths, working as early as late May to
late December.

bought all of Gulf Canada’s drilling assets, including the Beaudril fleet.
Arco Alaska Inc. used the Kulluk to
drill the Kuvlum wells in 1992-93,
about 16 miles offshore and 60 miles
east of Prudhoe Bay (OGJ, Oct. 11,
1993, p. 27).
In 1993, Seatankers bought the CanMar fleet, including the Kulluk.
Shell Offshore purchased the Kulluk
in 2005 and retained Frontier Drilling
to supervise its upgrade and refurbishment, which was completed earlier this
year. The ship was renovated in place
in at the Tuktoiyuk sea buoy, Canada’s
McKinley Bay, in about 18 statute miles
off Northwest Territories. Among the
changes:
• New mud and solids control systems, including MI Swaco shakers.
• New choke manifold.
• Upgraded topdrive and iron
roughneck.
• New communications system.
Bob Smith, Shell’s drilling advisor
based in Houston, said that there was
very little corrosion or rust, but rubber
products, such as hoses and seals, had
seriously deteriorated.
The Kulluk’s derrick has a catwalk,
but no automated pipe-handling
equipment. All drill pipe will be run as
triples.
In 2006, Shell awarded a contract
to Aker Arctic Technology to study and
model the feasibility of adding thrusteraided propulsion to the Kulluk. The
thruster design shows them installed
slightly astem of midship (Fig. 3b).
Shell chose Houston’s ThrustMaster
of Texas Inc. to build thrusters and hydraulic power units. This was the largest
kit ever built by Thrustmaster, supervised by Shell’s marine advisor, Suman
Muddusetti.
Smith said each thruster weighs
about 62 tonnes and measures 62.5 ft
by 13.6 ft by 10.1 ft (Fig. 4). They are
full azimuth thrusters with shafts that
can be rotated out of the water (90°
from vertical to horizontal) when not
in use. Thrusters enhance the vessel’s
maneuverability and control, provide
the ability to navigate between drillsites,

Each of the two new thrusters built by ThrustMaster of Texas Inc. for the Kulluk weighs about 62 tonnes

(OGJ, May 1, 1995, p. 31).
In February 2007, the MMS approved Shell’s plans to drill as many as
four wells in the 2007 season, but continued court challenges have postponed
drilling. Following a hearing on August
15, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals
granted an emergency stay, suspending
Shell’s Beaufort operations, in order
to consider antidrilling petitions from
several litigants, including the Alaska
Eskimo Whaling Commission and the
San Francisco-based Center for Biological Diversity. The court said there was
an issue as to whether the MMS had
complied with the 1970 National Environmental Policy Act in granting the
offshore leases to Shell.
In early December, the 9th Circuit
will review the consolidated petitions and rule on the merits of the suit
against the MMS. One possible outcome
is lifting the injunction against drilling
in the Beaufort.
Despite the setbacks in carrying out
the 2007 drilling plans, Shell’s Travis
Purvis, Alaska well delivery manager,
said the company now intends to stay
in the arctic for a long time. Alaska has
become another “heartland” for Shell;
“we’re back in Alaska and our intent is
to stay,” he said. ✦

The first theme is the strong industry

early 1990s. Fig 1 is based on data from

percentage [of the R&D dollar] focused
on US-specific needs is relatively small.”
Even smaller is the percentage of these
R&D dollars directed to domestic unconventional gas, a resource that was, in
the past, considered marginal by most
of these major companies.
Second, an important portion of this
post-R&D investment in unconventional
gas was stimulated as cost share to key
Gas Research Institute (GRI) and US
Department of Energy (DOE) projects.
These included GRI’s Rock Creek multiple coal seams field laboratory in the

These field-based R&D efforts were
instrumental in building the knowledge
base and technology for economically
producing coalbed methane and tight
gas sands. Large GRI and DOE R&D

opportunities (concepts) in unconventional gas and brought down the risks
of early technology application.
Third to note is the onset of increasing commercial-scale production of

increasing production reflects a second

Requirements for cleaner fuels,
rising demand for refined products,
and the need to meet more stringent
environmental regulations continue to
increase demand for refining catalysts.
As refinery utilization has increased,
refiners have demanded longer-life
catalysts that extend run lengths between turnarounds of key process units.
New-generation reforming catalysts are
achieving significantly
longer cycles for highseverity operations.
Refiners are also
demanding higherseverity hydrotreating
catalysts to produce
diesel that complies
with new low-sulfur regulations.
“The future of the refining industry
will be characterized by a substantial
increase in crude and hydroprocessing
capacity to meet the growing demand
for clean fuels,” according to UOP LLC
Pres. and CEO Carlos A. Cabrera.
Worldwide catalyst demand in the
oil and gas industry will reach $12.3
billion in 2010, according to a Freedo-

from BCC Research, estimated that the
global market for these catalysts was
worth $12.2 billion in 2006. The study
projected the catalyst market to grow to
$13.0 billion in 2007 and $18.5 billion
in 2012 for growth of 7.4%/year during 2007-12.
For the energy segment alone, of
which 90% employ refining catalysts,
the market will increase to nearly $5.0
billion in 2012 from about $3.2 billion
in 2006, according to the BCC study.
The study predicted that refining catalysts would lose market share because
“other energy applications, particularly
synfuels and biofuels, [will] consume
increasing amounts of catalysts.”
This article details some notable
developments since the last catalyst
survey (OGJ, Oct. 17, 2005, p. 50).
Major events include two acquisitions,
a hydroprocessing alliance, many new
catalyst formulations in the market,
and expansions to catalyst production
capacity.

are produced, and there is no need for
product posttreatment.
On Apr. 4, 2006, UOP announced
that its new R-98 catalyst increased
gasoline production yields in its first
commercial application. Hunt Refining
Co., using the new catalyst in a fixedbed platforming unit at its Tuscaloosa,
Ala., refinery, has increased C5+ gasoline
yields since using the catalyst in 2005.
Although the R-98 catalyst was developed for fixed-bed platforming units,
the company expects it to perform
equally well in other reforming units.
“The R-98 catalyst has improved
our reformate yield from hydrotreated
coker naphtha by about 2 vol %,” said
Steve Jackson, Hunt Refining Co.’s vicepresident of refining and transportation.
The R-98 catalyst is currently operating in its second cycle at the Hunt refinery with similar activity and gasoline
yields in both cycles, according to UOP.
The catalyst contains a proprietary
promoter to boost yields compared to
other commercially available catalysts. It
is fully regenerable under typical regeneration procedures provided by UOP,
resulting in multiple cycles of similar
cycle length.
On Feb. 6, 2006, Albemarle and Fabrica Carioca de Catalisadores SA (FCC
SA), a joint venture of Albemarle and
Petroleos Brasileiro SA (Petrobras), announced a new family of FCC catalysts.
The ReVolution family of FCC catalysts
will help refiners process lower-quality
crudes more efficiently due to the catalysts’ ability to trap vanadium, according to the companies.
On Jan. 12, 2006, Haldor Topsoe
announced that it had developed a new
catalyst preparation technology that
leads to highly active hydroprocessing
catalysts. The new BRIM technology
optimizes the brim site hydrogenation
functionality and also increases the Type
II activity sites for direct desulfurization.
Topsoe introduced two new nickelmolybdenum (NiMo) products based
on the BRIM technology. TK-575 BRIM

market, and TK-605 BRIM is a NiMo
catalyst optimized for the high-performance hydrocracker pretreatment
market.
At yearend 2005, Albemarle announced development and commercialization of a new FCC catalyst technology with its ADZT-100 zeolite. It also
announced its new ACTION family of

FCC catalysts, which is based on the
ADZT-100 zeolite.
“This technology can be used by
refiners to maximize the total volume of transportation fuels and other
feedstocks they produce, maximize
the octane of their gasoline, or some
combination of the two,” said Harm
Scheepstra, Albemarle’s FCC global business director. ✦

LNG TRADE—1

Statistical framework

Looking closely at
prevailing natural gas
statistics for production,
consumption, net export
capability, and proved
reserves of each country
LNG
provides insight into
how various countries’
natural gas industries are evolving relative to each other and why.
These statistics also help
to identify and explain the
strategies being pursued by
governments and national oil
and gas companies in countries where the NOCs control
their national industries. This
first of two articles concentrates on analysis of these statistics.
Reviewing gas and LNG spark
spreads in relation to electricity prices
and competing fuels provides insight
into the main gas consuming countries. The second, concluding article
(next week) will focus on recent spark
spreads in selected gas markets and
what they reveal about existing and
future LNG and gas strategies in those
markets.

Figs. 1 and 2 show the ratio of
natural gas production to domestic
consumption (P:C, exporters have a P:C
ratio greater than 1) for key countries
vs. their net natural gas export position
(E–I, exports minus imports; a negative number for net importers and a
positive number for net exporters). The
bubble size for each country is proportional to its proven natural gas reserves.
Fig. 1 highlights the countries with
extreme positions, while Fig. 2 focuses
on those lying closer to the origin or
central region of the distribution (the
vicinity of P:C = 1 and E–I = 0).
These graphs show a significant
spread of positions, with the main gas
importers trending broadly towards
the lower left and the main gas exporters trending broadly towards the upper
right. Some anomalies highlighted by
these graphs, however, suggest certain
countries are following gas strategies
inconsistent with their proved reserves
holdings. These anomalous countries,
in most cases, allow politics to drive
natural gas developments.
The P:C vs. E–I graphs referred to in
this article compare and contrast gas
strategies being followed by nations

and, where applicable, NOCs. The discussion focuses initially on those countries highlighted in the more extreme
positions (Fig. 1) and moves on to the
more centrally located nations (Fig. 2).
In the case of some nations, Figs. 1 and
2 also suggest the directions in which
countries are likely to move in the short
term and long term if they adopt certain gas strategies.

Canada has benefited for more than
2 decades as the main gas exporter
to the US. With falling reserves in
traditional gas producing areas and increased domestic gas demand (including expanding demand for use in tar
sand exploitation), however, Canada is
unlikely to be able to move further to
the upper right in Fig. 1, even with development of the Mackenzie Delta and
Northern Territories gas resources.

the Barents Sea, however, has not yet

emerged. The emergence of a strategic
alliance between Statoil and Gazprom
could have a major impact on global
long-term gas supply dynamics.
Algeria has been exploiting its large
gas resource base and proximity to
southern Europe for several decades
through pipeline and LNG projects. It
has secured substantial capital investment in its gas sector by cooperation
with IOCs, and continues to do so.
Algeria has in recent years followed a
strategy, through its NOC Sonatrach, to
extend its controlling share in projects
involving IOCs and seek higher prices
for its gas in tight-supply markets. This
strategy may lead some of its customers to diversify and jeopardize future
investments to expand infrastructure,
thereby inhibiting its ability to achieve
full market potential. Algeria, however,
should move further to the upper right
in Fig.1 over the medium term, driven
by new pipeline, LNG, and potential
GTL projects.
Nigeria’s large gas resources and limited domestic use for them and, in spite
of rapid growth in LNG, still limited
exports, place it in an unusual position
in Fig. 1. How fast this changes depends
on how the country deals with unrest
in the delta communities and if it recognizes the advantages of using domestic gas for power generation. As both
gas exports and domestic consumption
grow, Nigeria should move to the right
on Fig. 1.
The National Nigerian Petroleum Co.
continues to take a substantial interest
in LNG development projects, cooperating with IOCs through productionsharing contracts offshore and jointventure arrangements onshore. This
strategy places the risk on the IOCs,
which also provide the technology and
investment. It has worked quite well for
NNPC and is likely to continue.
In order to move right on Fig. 1 rather than up and right, however, NNPC
might have to invest more directly in
developing both its own gas use and the
energy infrastructure integration of its
Gulf of Guinea neighbors, relying less
on IOCs for financing and developing

problematic, gas pipeline initiatives:
Venezuela’s Gaseoducto del Sur, linking
across Brazil to Argentina; and the IPI
pipelines, linking Iran to Pakistan and
India. The political and economic problems these projects face, however, may
prevent either from being completed.
Saudi Arabia also lies at Fig. 1’s
origin, having followed a strategy of
not exporting natural gas, but instead
focusing on domestic energy projects
and development of its petrochemical
industry. State-owned Saudi Aramco has
developed its gas resources in line with
this strategy without the direct involvement of IOCs, one of the few nations to
have succeeded in doing so.
No current indication exists that
Saudi Aramco intends to adopt a gas
export strategy or enter LNG supply.
An important trend affecting the
Middle East region generally with
respect to gas, and specifically with
respect to LNG, is that the international
oil companies are maintaining their
hold on the technologies required to
develop gas supply chains, leaving the
NOCs under equipped to do so.
Also, by 2010, Saudi Arabia’s domestic consumption of natural gas will
reach 9-12 bcfd. Saudi Arabia and the
Middle East in general are increasing
their use of gas for generating electricity, one of the main reasons gas
production is set for growth in both
the Middle East and developing Asian
nations, even amid uncertain exports.
Both China and India, two of the
largest energy consumers in Asia, have
worked to increase their natural gas
supplies and develop the infrastructure
needed to import gas, especially as
LNG, into their markets. Their respective national oil companies, Chinese
National Offshore Oil Corp. and Oil and
Natural Gas Corp. Ltd., are participating
in international upstream exploration
projects for oil and gas, with a view
toward increasing upstream supplies.
Both have preliminary agreements for
gas cooperation with Iran involving
large scale LNG and pipeline projects.

64

Growing energy demand and the
international strategies being pursued
by these countries suggest that they will
move further to the lower left on Fig. 2
as the gap between domestic supply and
demand widens.
The Netherlands should move rapidly towards Fig. 2’s lower left over the
next few years, as domestic gas reserves
become depleted.
It plans to build new LNG regasification plants to satisfy both future gas
import requirements and to position
Rotterdam as a significant Northwest
Europe gas hub.
Indonesia should also move to the
lower left as domestic energy demand
and resultant gas consumption increase
and reserves supplying existing liquefaction plants deplete in spite of ongoing development of the Tangguh LNG
project. Indonesia’s strategy focuses
on exploring for more gas reserves in
conjunction with IOCs and building
domestic regasification plants so it can
meet future demand for power generation.
Malaysia’s domestic gas consumption
poses less of a problem than is the case
in Indonesia, but limited growth potential in proved reserves constrains its gas
export potential. State-owned Petronas
has long used international involvement, both upstream and downstream,
simultaneously cooperating and competing with IOCs. The existing demands
on its gas resource base will likely
prevent Malaysia from moving much
farther to the upper right on Fig. 2.
Australia and Egypt plot in similar
positions on Fig. 2 and, underpinned
by rapidly expanding gas resource
bases evolving from ongoing successful
offshore exploration programs, both
should be able to use LNG developments to move further the upper right
of the graph, probably changing positions with Indonesia within the next
decade. September 2007 announcements of new LNG sales contracts,
reportedly at high prices, for Australia’s
Gorgon (Shell-to-China) and Browse
(Woodside-to-Japan) Northwest Shelf
Projects have given that country’s LNG

industry new momentum.
Trinidad and Tobago plots in a similar position to Australia and Egypt on
Fig. 2 but has a more problematic gas
reserve base. Doubts about its ability to
prove enough gas reserves to sustain
further LNG expansion somewhat offset
its advantageous position with respect
to the North American market and its
extensive recent expansions to its liquefaction capacity.
Its rapid LNG development strategy,
however, has turned it into the largest
gas exporter to the US. It seems likely
that Trinidad and Tobago will continue
to exploit whatever reserves it can develop to sustain that strategy.
The Caspian states all have the potential gas reserves to become significant gas exporters in the coming years,
subject to pipeline development. Russia
continues to have a significant political influence on Turkmen, Kazakh, and
Uzbek gas exports, working against any
movements that do not flow across its
territory. At the same time, however,
Azerbaijan has become a gas exporter
through the South Caucasus Gas Pipeline into Turkey.
Their landlocked nature prevents
the Caspian States from participating
directly in LNG supply chains. But all
have the potential to move significantly
to the upper right on Fig. 2 by supplying pipeline gas to Europe, China, and
Russia. To the degree that their own
politics become involved in the process,
however, this potential may be underrealized in the short-term.
The gas consuming nations in the
lower left quadrant of Fig. 2 all seem
destined to move rapidly further in
that direction. The UK and Mexico are
actively building new LNG regasification infrastructure to complement and
diversify supply from their pipeline
networks.
Mexico, if it adopted a cooperation strategy with IOCs and attracted
investment and technology to explore
and develop offshore Gulf of Mexico resources could potentially move into the
upper right quadrant. But Pemex’s iso-

lationist strategy seems set to continue,
leaving Mexico to accept its position as
a net gas importer. Perhaps reaffirmed
strategic technical cooperation contracts
between Pemex and Petrobras, and

separately with Statoil, mark a change
in this approach.
Brazil, Chile, Poland, and Thailand
are planning to build strategically
located regasification terminals to increase the security and diversity of their

gas supplies away from existing import
pipelines.
LNG import strategies in South
America offer security and diversity of
supply options that can mitigate the political and economic risks of relying on
limited sources of pipeline supply. Both
Brazil and Chile have learned the costs
of overreliance on pipeline supplies
from Bolivia and Argentina, respectively.
LNG is now plays an important role
in the gas supply strategies of most
countries identified on Figs. 1 and 2.
Production, consumption, net export,
and reserves trends and statistics, however, to not determine these strategies
on their own. Strategies vary significantly based on the way gas is contracted and competes with other power
generation fuels.

competing fuels in selected gas import
markets to compare these strategies. ✦

New manifold for high-pressure instrumentation
The new Hi-Pro 3⁄8 in. bore double
block and bleed manifold operates at as
high as 15,000 psi cold working pressure.
The company says its unit is suited
for deepwater drilling, methanol injection equipment, and laboratories where
products are developed and tested under
extreme conditions.
The manifold comes standard with
15,000 psi-rated MPI tubing ends that
operate using the compression sealing
technique. Units assemble in seconds by
simply tightening a nut, and they are inherently vibration resistant. MPI tube end
sizes of 3⁄8-3⁄4 in. may be specified.
End connections are secured via the
proprietary Tru-Loc mechanism, which
helps guard against any connector movement when disconnecting connectors or
instrument. Optionally, NPT-compatible
male or female ends are available.
The manifold integrates two ball valves
for isolation and one needle valve for
venting, providing a standard double block

and bleed configuration for interfacing
instruments such as pressure or temperature transmitters. The valves are integrated
within a 316 stainless steel one-piece body
measuring 9.31 in. in length for the version with MPI tube ends.

Governor mistakes
business move for
price misbehavior
The governor of Connecticut has found
yet another way for Americans to think selfdestructively about energy.
Republican M. Jodi Rell has asked US
congressional leaders to investigate Chesapeake Energy Corp. for “possible manipulation of the price of natural gas.”
Earlier this month, with gas prices falling, Chesapeake said it would cut gross
production by 200 MMcfd and trim its

drilling program by yearend to 140-145
rigs from 155-160 (OGJ, Sept. 17, 2007, p.
100).
“This practice, if true, is an unconscionable ﬂeecing of US citizens by natural gas
suppliers who ‘elect’ to reduce production
in order to drive up prices paid by their
captive customers,” Rell railed in a letter to
Senate and House committees.
She should be cheering, not griping.
Thanks to several years of active drilling,
gas production this year is ahead of last
year’s level.
Working gas in inventory is at the top
of the 5-year range as the heating season
approaches. Prices have subsided.
So Chesapeake made a business decision to ease an aggressive program. The
affected production represents 0.3% of total
US gas output, hardly enough to inﬂuence
prices.
To Rell, it’s “an outrage.” She sounds like
a Democrat.
Commendably, Chesapeake Chairman
and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer Aubrey McClendon called statements in the Rell rant
“incorrect and reckless” and asked for an
apology.
It’s a sound request. Rell’s accusations
are as serious as they are groundless.
They cast Chesapeake, one of the country’s busiest explorers for and producers
of natural gas, in a sinister light it doesn’t
deserve. And they exploit a good-faith disclosure by the company for base political
purposes.
In response to McClendon’s call for an
apology, the best Rell’s press ofﬁce could
do was try to make a shin-kick sound like a
handshake.
“I think we’re going to have to agree to
disagree,” said spokesman Rich Harris.
At least Rell, who wants to replace 20%
of the oil and gas used in Connecticut with
alternative energy by 2020, acknowledges
the link between production and prices. She
should remember it the next time someone
proposes federal oil and gas leasing off the
East Coast.

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

A run of record high prices
The front month crude contract hit record highs in either intraday trading or closings—usually both—in eight consecutive trading sessions Sept. 11-20 on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
That run of escalating prices was even more outstanding since it started the same
day that members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries voted to
increase their oil production by a total 500,000 b/d effective Nov. 1. That decision
excludes production by Angola and Iraq and affects only the other 10 members (OGJ
Online, Sept. 11, 2007).
The October contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes climbed from $77.49/
bbl at the close of the Sept. 10 session on NYMEX to an intraday peak of $84.10/bbl
and a closing price of $83.32/bbl on its expiration Sept. 20. The new front-month
November contract dipped 16¢ to $81.62/bbl Sept. 21. In its last 8 days of trade, the
October contract retreated only once, down 99¢ to $79.10/bbl in proﬁt taking Sept.
14, but even then it set an intraday high of $80.92/bbl. From the start, the world oil
market seemed to shrug off OPEC’s promised production increase as primarily symbolic, since the 10 members now subject to quotas were estimated to have produced
roughly 1 million b/d above the current ceiling in August. Subsequent factors continued to stimulate higher oil prices.
The October contract jumped above $82/bbl Sept. 18 on NYMEX after the US Federal Reserve cut its target interest rate by a larger-than-expected half of a percentage
point to 4.75% to stem a possible slowdown in the US economy. That cut was on the
high side of the reduction anticipated by most economists and plunged the dollar
index to a record low. Meanwhile some analysts remained wary of possible inﬂation.
Benchmark US crude prices again were spurred higher Sept. 19-20 as a tropical
storm began building in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. On Sept. 20, the US Minerals
Management Service reported 5 of the 834 production platforms and 3 of 89 mobile
rigs in the US sector of the gulf were evacuated. MMS ofﬁcials reported offshore
operators had shut in as much as 1.3 million b/d of crude and 1.9 bcfd of natural
gas production from federal leases. By Sept. 22, however, crews were going back
offshore after Tropical Storm Jerry came ashore in the Florida panhandle Sept. 21.
The Iranian factor
Meanwhile, on the international front, there were discussions Sept. 21 in Washington, DC, about possibly more sanctions on Iran in the ongoing attempt to get that
country to abandon its uranium enrichment program. “While we expect the Russians
and Chinese to continue to oppose new sanctions, it should make for more geopolitical sound bites. And this should continue into next week as the world leaders are
gathering in New York for the United Nations general assembly,” said Olivier Jakob,
managing director of Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland.
Barclays Capital Inc. analyst Paul Horsnell in London said, “International tensions
surrounding Iran appear to be in the process of stepping up, with diplomacy moving
further away from the carrot and closer to the stick.” He sees 2008 “as the year of
maximum danger, although it does not appear that the core issues themselves, or
the core dangers in the situation, would necessarily change following the change of
US administration.”
Horsnell said, “We are placing a partial allowance for the worst of any Iranianlinked tension in the second half of 2008, having nudged our 2008 West Texas Intermediate price forecast up to $77/bbl from the previous forecast of $73.90/bbl.”
Gasoline prices
Although crude prices have rallied steadily over the past month, gasoline prices
have not moved as high or as quickly in the same time period. The October contract
for reformulated blendstock for oxygenate blending (RBOB) ﬂuctuated from $1.98/gal
Sept. 10 on NYMEX to $2.11/gal as of Sept. 21. Raymond James analysts cite three
reasons for this:
The decline in gasoline demand with US exiting the summer driving season.
The use of ethanol as a gasoline additive. Ethanol prices have dropped 30% in
recent months.
Gasoline imports remain at a healthy level. However, they said, “If crude prices
continue their upward trajectory, gasoline prices will inevitably follow. Also, the recently lowered interest rates should help in spurring economic growth, resulting in an
increase in gasoline demand. Furthermore, with gasoline supplies still at historical low
levels, any supply disruption has the ability to meaningfully pushed prices higher.”

Korea Gas Corp.’s Incheon terminal is to undergo storage expansion in the next 5 years, along
with two others terminals. Total storage capacity among the three terminals will increase by
72% to meet South Korea’s growing demand for gas. Dependent entirely on LNG for gas supply, the country is the world’s second-largest LNG buyer after Japan. Its demand is a primary
driver of LNG activity in the Paciﬁc Rim. This issue of LNG Observer devotes its main Issues,
Trends, Technologies section (p. 3) to discussions of the region and its LNG growth. Photograph from Kogas.

The project’s long-term goal, subject
to solution of massive financial and
technical problems, is to export as

power to Europe through subsea cables
to Sicily and Spain.

Implications
The GGFR report noted a “growing array of technologies to capture
and make use” of natural gas currently
being flared. Not the least of which is
finding ways to move it to markets “using pipelines.”
Pipelines? If gas now being flared
or vented had access to pipelines, it
wouldn’t be stranded.
It’s the growth of access to liquefaction that plays a larger role in reducing
flaring. With much liquefaction construction under way and much more on
order, the massive amounts of gas left
in the ground or flared into the atmosphere will find markets.
But the GGFR report never mentions
LNG or its current rapid growth. It had
only to look at Nigeria—which it does
mention—to see how effectively LNG
has stepped into the equation for reducing flaring.
The timetable for the Algerian
thermal generating project, on the
other hand, is far too extended and the
volumes that will feed it far too small
for that project seriously to threaten
supply for the country’s LNG industry,
the world’s oldest.
The country’s plans should, nonetheless, remind the global LNG industry,
lest it become smug in its recent rapid
growth and future bright prospects, that
natural gas has lots of options, only one
of which is LNG. LNG

in traditional Asian markets, much
attention is now being directed to opportunities arising from the potentially
vast Atlantic Basin LNG market.
Meanwhile, the limits of domestic
gas production in North America and
Western Europe are becoming clear and
gas import demand is rising. Increasingly, LNG is a choice in satisfying growing
gas demand in these regions. Following
the success of the plants recently established in Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria,
and Trinidad and Tobago, a wave of
new projects has emerged that demonstrate the potential for extensive market
growth over the next 5 years.
Despite strong demand fundamentals, however, supply constraints are
now affecting the business: EPC costs
are rising; final investment decisions
(FIDs) are being delayed or postponed
as a result; and while major growth is
still in prospect, the timing of operators’ planned expenditures is likely to
move significantly “to the right.”
This article will focus on the general
characteristics and development of the
LNG industry in the Pacific Rim and
present Douglas-Westwood’s historical (2002-06) and forecast (2007-11)
views of capital expenditures (capex)
associated with LNG projects in the region. Particular attention will be given
to development of the LNG industry in
China and the US West Coast and Canada. For the present purposes, however,
Southern Asian nations, such as India
and Pakistan, are not considered part of
the Pacific Rim.

Several factors are driving this

Gas will account for 26% of global

LNG carriers
Shipyards in the Pacific Rim have
dominated activity in the newbuild
LNG carrier market. In fact, the region
has constructed nearly all the LNG
carriers that entered service 2002-06.
Over the next 5 years, we anticipate
that more than 195 new carriers will
be built in Pacific Rim nations. Capex
associated with these new vessels will
exceed $41.5 billion.
Douglas-Westwood data indicate the
average price of an LNG vessel delivered
over the previous 5 years fell to as low
as $162 million in 2002. This decline in
price over this period was largely due to
intense competition among shipyards in
the Far East, Korean ones in particular.
Although the market will remain
competitive, however—with the entrance of Chinese yards into the market
being a point of particular interest—demand in the shipping sector is at an
all-time high with lead times for new
orders stretching out 4-5 years. Prices
for newbuilds now exceed $200 million/vessel again, with the trend towards
increasingly larger vessels to continue.

The membrane system is the most
widely adopted, being used in more
than half of LNG vessels in service as of
2007. It will be used in around 85% of
vessels scheduled for delivery 200710. The Moss system is used in 45%
of LNG vessels in service as of 2006
and will be used in more than 10% of
vessels scheduled for delivery during
2007-10.
It is worth noting that in April 2007
Kogas signed a memorandum of understanding with the Korea Shipbuilder’s
Association to develop a membranetype cargo containment system (called
KC-1) to rival the GTT system. The
successful development KC-1 would
improve the competitiveness of the
Korean shipyards in light of China’s
entrance into the LNG vessel construction market.

LNG in US West Coast, Canada
Since 1991, EIA data show that there
have only been 3 years when North
America has produced more gas than
it has consumed. The US currently
depends on Canada for the vast majority of its gas imports, but since Canada’s
main producing areas are now mature
and Canadian gas demand is increasing,
both the US and Canada are now looking to LNG imports as an important
source of gas.
A decade ago, an LNG export plant
was proposed to export Canadian gas
to markets in Asia. With gas supply in
North America struggling to keep up
with demand, however, all proposals are
now for LNG import terminals.
Excluding Alaska, all US West Coast
states import most if not all the gas
they consume. California has the most
in-state gas resources available but consumes almost 10 times as much natural
gas each year as either Oregon or Washington. California produces about 15%
of the 6.1 bcfd (2005 value) of natural
gas that it consumes and imports the
rest from Canada (about 24%), the
Rocky Mountains (about 25%), and
Southwest (about 36%).
This situation highlights the potential for LNG to be a substitute or
complementary source of natural gas
for West Coast states with easy access to
Pacific Rim liquefaction capacity.
LNG import terminals have been
proposed in all three US West Coast
states, but thus far none has received
regulatory approval, owing as much to
public opposition as to failure to meet
regulatory requirements. The LNG industry is renowned for its diligent standards and has an excellent safety record,
albeit not entirely without incident.
Public perception about the risks of

October-December 2007 Vol. 4, No. 4

LNG, however, often appears to be misconceived. Consequently local opposition
to new facilities is common and perhaps
now more vigorous given continuing
worries over terrorism. This seems to be a
particular problem in California.
In recent years, three prospects for
Californian LNG import terminals have
been abandoned due to local opposition: Humbolt Bay (Calpine Corp.), Mare
Island (Shell Corp. and Bechtel); and
Cabrillo Port LNG (BHP Billiton). In the
case of Mare Island, shipping scheduling was also a concern. The LNG tankers
would have required escorting by the US
Coast Guard under several major bridges
including the Golden Gate Bridge and
through San Francisco Bay.
Cabrillo Port LNG was the latest victim of strong local opposition to LNG
projects in California. In May 2007, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger turned down BHP’s applications for
a floating storage and regasification unit
(FSRU) some 35 km off Ventura County
(OGJ Online, May 29, 2007; LNGO,
July-September 2007, p. 23). The
project reflects the difficulties involved
in obtaining regulatory approvals and
overcoming local opposition faced by
all LNG terminal proposals located in
California–offshore as well as onshore.
Although no import terminals are
likely to be constructed on the US
West Coast 2007-11, the Kitimat LNG
(Galveston Energy) project on Canada’s
West Coast should be completed by
yearend 2010. Also, commercial operations at the Sempra Energy’s Energia
Costa Azul LNG terminal in Baja California, on the Pacific Coast of Mexico, will
begin by yearend 2008.
Baja California has seen a lot of interest for proposed LNG import terminals
mainly due to the proximity of US markets and the region’s isolation from the
rest of Mexico’s energy supply. Should
proposed import terminals on the West
Coast fail to gain approval, Kitimat and
Energía Costa Azul may provide an
alternate source for LNG supply if they
are able to source sufficient volumes of
LNG beyond the requirements of local
markets. LNG

Nuclear, LNG vie to meet Japan’s energy needs
Tomoko Hosoe
FACTS Global Energy
Honolulu
Japan’s energy policy encourages an
increased use of natural gas and nuclear
power to mitigate climate change and
diversify the energy mix away from oil.
This would effectively reduce Japan’s
energy reliance on the Middle East.
Accordingly, Japanese LNG buyers have
significantly increased import volumes
since their first imports in 1969, particularly after the two oil crises in the
1970s.
Today, Japan is the world’s largest
LNG importer at 62.1 million tpy, about
59% of total demand coming from the
power industry and the rest from gas
utilities. All of Japan’s gas imports are in
the form of LNG.
This article examines market fundamentals and how domestic factors such
as power and gas industry reform and
nuclear power policy and problems will
influence Japan’s LNG demand.

Until recently, Japan was considered

started notably increasing again. LNG
imports in 2006 were up by 7%, as
Japan’s economy continued to improve,
increasing productivity, and the power
sector continues to have nuclear power
problems.
For the first half of 2007, the nuclear
utilization rate was 61.9-72.9% and is
likely to operate well below 70% for the
second half. The main reason for Japan’s

Primary energy consumption
In 2006, the share of natural gas in
Japan’s primary energy mix was 12%,
in line with 2005 (Fig. 1). Oil (48%)
continued to dominate the energy
mix with coal’s share at 25%. Japan’s
reliance on nuclear power increased to
12%, up from 11% in 2005.
For 2020, both nuclear and natural

gas shares will likely increase to 18%
and 19%, respectively. Japan’s oil dependency will fall to 33%, given that the
government continues to implement
strict environmental and energy conservation and fuel-efficiency regulations at
all levels.

• A series of unexpected nuclear
power plant shutdowns.
• Lower utilization of hydro power
plants, due to Japan’s record-high winter temperature (thus low winter snowfall) and low precipitation during the
rainy season caused drought problems,
particularly in western Japan.
• A series of unexpected hydro
power plant shutdowns. Several hydro
power plants had received penalties
from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transportation on May 16,
2007, as a result of maintenance and
operational data manipulation. These
penalties included: halting power plant
operations; taking away the right to use
water for power generation; and reducing their water intake, which is used
for power generation. TEPCO’s Shiobara
plant (a 1.05-Gw pumped storage type
plant), which is designed to meet their
summer peak demand, was one of the
plants penalized.
Fig. 3 illustrates Japan’s LNG imports
for first-half 2007.
For the second half of 2007, strong
demand is expected primarily from
TEPCO, as a result of its 8.21-Gw Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant
closure in July.
The Chuetsu offshore earthquake
(magnitude of 6.8) hit Japan’s Niigata
prefecture, where the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant (consisting of
seven nuclear reactors) is located. A fire
broke out in a transformer at the Unit
3 reactor, while some water containing radioactive materials leaked from
another unit into the sea.
At the time of the earthquake, three
reactors out of the seven were operating normally and one was to commence operation after its maintenance
shutdown. The other three reactors
were not operating due to maintenance
shutdowns. Due to the earthquake all
reactors ceased operations.
The Kashiwazaki municipal government issued an emergency order to
TEPCO to stop operating the power

plant, stating that the plant can only
resume operations after TEPCO receives
permission from local municipalities.
Similarly, Minister Akira Amari at the
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) ordered TEPCO not to
resume operations of the plant until
safety is ensured.
Complete plant closure will last at
least until the end of March 2008 and
an additional year (or possibly longer)
may be needed until the plant will return to its normal operation. Essentially,
TEPCO will have to resolve two concerns:
• Safety of the plant site, since various data suggest a fault line may run

underneath the nuclear power plant.
• Earthquake resistance of the
nuclear power plant, as it has already
experienced an earthquake more severe
than the plant was designed for.
It remains in question how long
until the nuclear units can resume normal operation because Japan has never
experienced nuclear power problems of
this scale and has no way of assessing
how long each step (e.g., investigation,
geological survey, repair and construction works, government approval, and
public approval) will take before TEPCO
can resume plant operations.
From past experience, receiving
permission from the local community

and local municipalities is
one of the most difficult and
time-consuming processes
in resolving nuclear-related
problems. The general public’s
trust in nuclear power has
been lost again and will
damage TEPCO’s attempts to
resume plant operations.
The key difference between
the 2003 nuclear crisis and
the current KashiwazakiKariwa problem is that by
law, TEPCO is not allowed
to resume plant operations,
whereas in 2003 TEPCO
could have resumed operations because the plants were
operational. Without the
8.21-Gw baseload capacity
today, TEPCO must increase
its dependency on thermal
power generation (fuels being
LNG, fuel oil, and crude oil).
Assuming the power sector’s LNG demand for 2007 is
near 2003 level, when Tokyo
experienced a nuclear power
crisis, Japan’s overall LNG
demand in 2007 will likely
increase to 65.2 tonnes, up
from 62.1 tonnes in 2006.

power crisis.)

Nuclear power crisis in 2003
TEPCO’s LNG consumption was
abnormally high in 2003 due to unexpected nuclear power plant closures,
which is remembered as the “nuclear
power crisis.” Beginning late August
2002, TEPCO began nuclear shutdowns
for safety inspections as it admitted to
having covered up the fact that there
were cracks in several reactor parts
that were not properly reported in routine plant inspection reports in the late

1980s and 1990s.
By March 2003, TEPCO had shutdown all 17 nuclear power units (17.3
Gw) for safety re-inspections. The
company ramped up the existing
units’ utilization factors and started its
backup oil-ﬁred plants to make up for
the loss of baseload electricity supply
from nuclear shutdowns.
TEPCO’s LNG demand remained
higher than normal until early 2005.

have signed preliminary agreements
with the Australian venture for a total
of 3 million tpy. The contracts’ durations have been reduced to 6-8 years,
depending on the buyer, and the extensions of the contracts’ durations remain
the seller’s option.
The delivered ex-ship price agreed
upon with these buyers was believed
to be higher than prices agreed by
Chugoku Electric and Toho Gas. When
adding the contract renewals previously
agreed during bilateral negotiations
with Chugoku Electric and Toho Gas,
total volume to Japan will be reduced to

With market liberalization, “traditional” Japanese consortium LNG
buyers have become competitors and
ultimately abandoned the “one price fits
all” consortium approach in LNG negotiations. Already, new contracts arranged
since December 2005 (including North
West Shelf Train 4 and Sakhalin II) have
been signed without a consortium.
The negotiations for NWS Trains 1 to
3 contracts have also been carried out
separately by each of the eight initial
buyers.
Japan has two large-volume contracts
that will expire by 2010-11—the 7.33million-tpy NWS Trains 1 to 3 and the
12.0-million-tpy Bontang contracts—
which will supply reduced volumes to
the buyers after renewal.
• NWS Trains 1 to 3. NWS was historically a Japan-focused project and the
majority of the output is still destined
for Japan. TEPCO was the consortium
leader that negotiated the original contract for 7.33 million tpy on behalf of
the eight utilities. The existing consortium contracts will expire by 2009.
Chugoku Electric and Toho Gas were
the first to sign and have renewed contracted supplies from NWS. Chugoku
Electric agreed to purchase 1.2—1.4
million tpy of LNG from the NWS venture. They increased the quantity purchased from the initial 1.1 million tpy,
but the new contract is for a shorter duration (12 years). Toho Gas also raised
the quantity purchased to a maximum
of 0.76 million tpy from 0.23 million
tpy and reduced the duration to 12
years. The prices agreed upon have no
ceiling but do contain a clause to meet
and discuss once JCC (“Japan Crude
Cocktail”) prices exceed $60/bbl.
Meanwhile, the rest of the eight
original buyers participated in the allocation process launched by the Australian venture in April-May 2006 for the
sale of up to 4 million tpy, consisting
of volumes available for the renewal
of Trains 1 to 3 contracts and Train 5’s
uncommitted volumes.
As a result of the allocation process,
six buyers in the original consortium

million tpy of Bontang contracts will
expire by 2011. The consortium of
Japanese buyers and Pertamina had supposedly reached an agreement during
fourth-quarter 2005 for the renewal of
6 million tpy over 10 years, at a price
significantly lower than the legacy
contract. The contract is subject to the
approval, however, of the Indonesian
regulator BP Migas, which (as of August
2007) had still not approved the contract renewal and is concerned by the
low price level.
Also, there is Indonesia’s new focus
on the domestic market instead of
exports. After all, serious doubts remain
about the volume of LNG potentially
available for contract renewal after

2010; thus we believe only a maximum
of 3 to 4 million tpy will be renewed.
As a consequence of the reduced
volumes of the two large-volume
contracts, Japanese buyers have turned
mainly toward greenfield projects
(e.g., Australian and Russian projects)
to meet the supply gap. Table 7 summarizes heads of agreement for Australian greenfield projects. In some cases,
Japanese buyers have acquired equity
shares in the projects, Tokyo Gas and
Kansai Electric each owns 5% of the
Pluto project.
Fig. 5 illustrates our base-case and
high-case LNG demand outlooks vs. the
existing Japanese LNG contracts until
2015. We take the difference between
each forecast and the existing contracts
to come up with an uncommitted
demand figure. Note: Table 7 only includes supply-purchase agreements and
selected HOAs, which we consider firm
(e.g., NWS renewals and Sakhalin II) in
terms of their start-up timing.
It is clear that Japan’s contracted volumes are not forecast to meet demand
by 2010. Supply could be even more
insufficient if Pertamina does not solve
its production problems by then. By
2015, Japan’s uncommitted demand
could reach 30.85 tonnes because the
Bontang contracts and the Brunei contract are scheduled to expire by then.
Beyond 2015, expiration of the
contracts with Malaysia Satu and Dua
(from 2015 to 2018) and with ADGAS
(2019) will also take place. If we take
into account all the HOAs (e.g., Pluto
and Gorgon), preliminary agreements,
optional volumes, and potential renewals from Bontang, however, for a total
volume of 3 million tpy (not included
in the figure above), the volume of uncommitted demand is reduced to 15.6
tonnes by 2015.

Implications
Japan will face an LNG supply shortfall problem, unless the supply agreements for the greenfield projects materialize on schedule and more contracts
will be signed. Clearly, those who have

a higher dependency on Indonesian
LNG are more exposed to future supply
shortfalls, given that the Indonesian
supply will be reduced after 2010-11.
Also, the reduced supply volumes from

added concerns over future supply.
In the long run, other supply reductions may come from ADGAS, as Abu
Dhabi needs gas domestically. Meanwhile, buyers continue to hope that
potential new supplies from Japan-operated and participated projects may
be available, such as INPEX’s proposed
Ichthys LNG project off northwestern
Australia. That’s especially true now, as
INPEX plans to build its first domestic
LNG import terminal in the Niigata
prefecture by 2013, where Teikoku Oil
owns natural gas pipelines.
Apart from the global supply situation, Japan has domestic issues such as
the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant shutdown
and its effects on other utilities and
on the industry as a whole. Under any
scenario, Japan’s utilization of nuclear
power plants will remain reduced without the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa capacity.
Without the 8.21 Gw of nuclear power
generating capacity, Japan’s commitments under the Kyoto protocol is
unlikely to be reached.
The long-term answer to the problem involves revising Japan’s nuclear
safety regulations further and trying to
keep the existing nuclear power plants,
as well as those under construction,
from closing indefinitely. Consequently,
some nuclear power plants may need to
be upgraded to meet the higher safety
guidelines that METI will set.
Japan’s nuclear problems have made
it very difficult to forecast not only LNG
demand, but also oil product balances.
An additional some 2 tonnes of LNG,
which need to be secured from the spot
market in 2007-08 in a tight LNG market, is a serious problem. If the nuclear
shutdowns last longer than anticipated,
electric utilities will have to depend
even more on LNG.
Meanwhile, oil refiners will produce or procure as much low-sulfur
fuel oil as TEPCO requires. TEPCO will

need a total 180,900 b/d of LSFO and
crude oil combined for fiscal year 2007
(April 2007-March 2008). The utility’s
consumption volume in FY2006 was
69,600 b/d.
The emerging high LSFO demand
could be a double-edged sword because
it will produce more middle distillates
and lighter products when domestic
demand remains stagnant. Japanese
refiners, especially those who have their
own supply network, are expected to
enhance their product exports.
Once again, Japan’s nuclear power
crisis has illustrated the fact that Japan’s
change in its energy-demand pattern
rapidly affects the Asian oil and gas
demand-supply picture in its entirety.

ISSUES, TRENDS, TECHNOLOGIES
rangements and its ability to market gas
to the end customer.
One recent event that highlights the
importance of a credit analysis of the
full value chain concerns the Energía
Costa Azul terminal in Baja California,
Mexico. Sempra Energy, sponsor of the
Costa Azul plant, has a 3.7-million-tpy
offtake agreement with the BP-operated Tangguh LNG project in Indonesia.
In June 2007, the Indonesian press
reported that a significant portion of
that volume would be diverted to other
customers, including Indonesian state
utility PLN. When the agreement was
originally signed in 2004, BP characterized it as “highly flexible.”2 Therefore,
the provision appears to have been part
of the offtake agreement between the
parties.
The situation, however, illustrates
the importance of fully evaluating the
risks up and downstream of a TUA,
even when the counterparty brings an
investment-grade credit rating. Issues
such as the construction, operating, and
country risks related to the source of
the LNG supply, shipping arrangements,
and natural gas marketing strategy all
need to be carefully reviewed to assess
the overall sustainability of the TUA.
Although a strong TUA with a creditworthy capacity holder may be sufficient to support the financing of a regas
terminal, it may not be enough for the
liquefaction plant. Take, for example, the
situation in which the marketing plan
for a given plant’s LNG involves regasification at a terminal that has yet to begin
construction.
Lenders to the supply plant will be
reluctant to provide financing if offtake
arrangements involve a regas facility
that is still under development. Lenders
will not want to assume the permitting,
financing, and construction risks for the
terminal and will pass them through
to the sponsor’s completion guarantee.
If the sponsor is not the offtaker, the
sponsor will probably pass the terminal
completion risk to the offtaker through
the LNG sales and purchase agreement.
In the end, whichever party is planning to offtake LNG and regasify it

LNG Observer

through its capacity at the terminal in
question will be forced to bear completion risk for that terminal.
Under these circumstances it may
make sense for the party bearing the
terminal-completion risk to consider a
significant equity investment, perhaps
even a majority stake, in the terminal.
Downsides to this approach include
added capital budgeting requirements
and reduced return on equity expected
from an investment in regasification
relative to a liquefaction project.
But there is considerable upside in
owning a stake in the regas terminal,
especially in terms of risk management.
The ability to influence–or in the case
of a majority stake, control–decisions
throughout development and construction increases the ability to manage
terminal-completion risk well beyond
what is afforded through simply signing a TUA.
The impact on returns from investing in a less profitable regas facility is
also small when viewed in the context
of an overall investment in the LNG
value chain. A regas terminal with a
capacity of 1 bcfd can be expected to
cost about $600 million to build. Assuming creditworthy agreements cover
a majority of terminal capacity, project
financing can achieve 80% leverage,
leaving $120 million for sponsors to
finance through equity. In this scenario,
an investment of $75 million may be
enough to secure a majority shareholding (51% of construction equity plus a
premium).
Given the utility-style risk profile
of a typical regas facility, returns to
equity can be expected to be around
10—12%. This can be compared to a
liquefaction plant that costs $5 billion,
is 60% levered–thereby requiring $2
billion in equity–and is expected to
provide an equity internal rate of return
of 18%. Adding the regas cash flows to
those of the liquefaction plant lowers
liquefaction returns by less than 30 basis points. This relatively small reduction
in expected returns is compensated by
the ability to optimize risk management
throughout the LNG supply chain.

$12 billion (Aus.), around 20% more
than originally projected. Woodside’s
board also approved consideration of a
one- and a two-train expansion.
Santos is proposing a 3-4 million
tpy liquefaction plant at Gladstone in
Queensland on Australia’s East Coast
that would be the first in the world to
use coalseam methane as feedstock. The
plant could cost as much as $7 billion
(Aus.), half of it for upstream field development. A final investment decision
will come by yearend 2009; deliveries
could start in early 2014.
At least eight more LNG Australian
projects have been proposed (accompanying table). Government officials say
Australian LNG exports could quadruple to more than 50 million tpy within
a decade.
In September, in Australia’s Gorgon
project, Shell Eastern LNG signed binding heads of agreement with PetroChina
International Co. to supply 1 million
tpy of LNG for 20 years. The companies expect to conclude the sales and
purchase agreement (SPA) by yearend
2008, contingent upon an FID by the
Gorgon joint-venture Chevron (50%,
ExxonMobil (25%), and Shell (25%).
This agreement augments others to sell
up to 2.5 million tpy to Mexico and
500,000 tpy to India.
The original $8.6 billion budget for
the total Gorgon project—field development and LNG—has been pushed much
higher by rising labor and materials
costs. Fields holding more then 40 tcf
backstop the liquefaction segment.
Also in early September, Gorgon
received final approval from the Western
Australian government, a major hurdle
that had threatened the stop the project.
For approval, WA’s Environment
Ministry set “stringent” environmental
conditions, among which Gorgon must
establish a reservoir for a CO2 reinjection and expert panels to protect the
biodiversity of Barrow Island surrounding marine environment. The sequestration plan proposes to reinject about 3

The plan also includes a $60 million

In Browse LNG, another Australian
project, PetroChina signed a preliminary agreement to buy 2-3 million tpy
of LNG for 15-20 years from Woodside
Petroleum’s proposed project in what
could be Australia’s largest-ever export
deal. Woodside said deliveries would
begin 2013-15. PetroChina is developing three LNG terminals at Dalian on
the northeast coast, Tangshan in Hebei
Province, and Rudong in Jiangsu.
In Japan, following shutdown of its
8.2-Gw Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear
plant in western Japan after an earthquake in July, Tokyo Electric Power Co.
Ltd. has projected that it will double
its imports of crude oil and buy 18.8
million tpy of LNG (equivalent to 1015 spot cargoes), up from its earlier
projection of 17.5 million tonnes. The
plant is expected to be shut through
March 2008.
Taikoku Oil, subsidiary of Inpex
Holdings Inc., announced plans to
build a small LNG terminal at Joetsu,
Niigata prefecture, in northwest Japan.

Construction would start in 2009 and
operations begin in late 2013 with an
initial capacity of 600,000 tpy. The terminal would be the 28th in Japan.
Supplies could come from Indonesia, where Inpex has interests in the
Tangguh project and a 50% share in the
Mahakam block that supplies Bontang
LNG, and from Australia, where Inpex

PROJECT UPDATES

In early August 2007, construction teams raised the roof on a third LNG storage tank at Cheniere’s Sabine Pass LNG regasification terminal in southwest
Louisiana.These three tanks, of six to be finally built, will have 10.1 bcf of LNG storage capacity.The terminal will begin operations in second-quarter 2008
and have total regasification capacity of 4 bcfd when construction ends in 2009. Photograph from Cheniere Energy Inc. by Mike Kelly.
Imported LNG for the first 8 months
of 2007 reached 14.5 tonnes, as much
as came in through all of 2004, the previous record year for US LNG imports.
This year, the US is competing with
Spain to be the world’s third-largest
LNG importer. Once expansions at three
of the five existing US terminals and
construction of four new terminals are
completed, however, the US should easily outpace Spain in the next 3 years.
CB&I signed an EPC contract for expansion of Southern LNG Inc.’s terminal
at Elba Island, Ga. CB&I will build a
200,000-cu-m storage tank—largest
in North America—that will increase
the terminal’s LNG storage capacity by
more than 50% to 11.5 bcf and add
540 MMcfd of sendout to increase
capacity to 1.7 bcfd by 2010.

a total of 1.8 bcfd; and construction of
81 miles of new pipeline in Pennsylvania and 48 miles in Maryland. CB&I also
holds this contract; it built the existing

Along the Gulf Coast, the US Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission staff
has issued the final environmental
impact statement for the proposed
Calhoun LNG terminal and pipeline
project at Port Lavaca-Point Comfort in
Calhoun and Jackson Counties, Texas.
The project, which is being developed
by Gulf Coast LNG Partners LP, would
have two 160,000-cu-m storage tanks
and sendout capacity of around 1 bcfd.
Operations would begin in 2009-10.

In July, OAO Gazprom named
France’s Total SA as its partner for the
first phase of the much-discussed
Shtokman project in the Barents Sea,
ending years of discussions over a field
that will ultimately supply gas to both
Europe and North America. Gazprom
intends to start shipments in 2013
through the Baltic Sea’s Nord Stream
pipeline and LNG deliveries in 2014 to
North America.
Total will receive a 25% stake in a
special-purpose company formed to
plan, finance, and construct the project’s
infrastructure. Gazprom intends to
award another 24% in the special company to one or more foreign partners
but remain sole owner of the company
holding license to develop the field.

Also in the Barents Sea, Statoil has

delivered first gas through a 90-mile
pipeline from the Snøhvit field to its
single-train 4.2-million-tpy Hammerfest liquefaction plant on Melkøya
Island. The first cargo is expected to be
shipped in October.
Statoil is operator with 33.53%
interest; other participants are Petoro
30%, Total 18.4%, Gaz de France 12%,
Hess 3.26%, and RWE Dea 2.81%.
The UK in July received its first
LNG cargo in nearly 4 months when
the Berge Arzew unloaded at Isle of
Grain. Capacity in the terminal, operated by National Grid, is held by BP and
Algeria’s Sonatrach.
Higher prices in the US drew LNG
away from the UK, especially after the
opening of new pipelines from Norway
and the Netherlands drove prices down.
UK gas prices rose again, however, after
a pipeline from Norway was closed.
In other UK developments, British
Gas Trading Ltd., subsidiary of Centrica PLC, and Asean LNG Trading Co.
Ltd., subsidiary of Malaysia’s Petronas,
terminated their 15-year LNG SPA
signed in August 2004 “due to certain
conditions precedent in the contract not
having been satisfied.” No details were
disclosed.
Under the contract, Petronas would
have delivered up to 3 billion cu m/
year to the Dragon LNG terminal at Milford Haven in Wales starting in 2007.
The 6-billion-cu m capacity terminal
is owned by Petronas 30%, BG Group
50%, and Petroplus 20%. The LNG was
to have come from Petronas’s portfolio
of supply sources, including Malaysia
and Egypt, where Petronas has a 35.5%
share in Train 1 and a 38% share in
Train 2 of the Egyptian LNG plant at
Idku.
In Belgium, Fluxys LNG announced
in August it had received an €85-million loan from the European Investment
Bank to double capacity of the Zeebrugge LNG regasification terminal to 6.6
million tpy. The company said the increased capacity has been fully booked
on a long-term basis (OGJ Online, Aug.
9, 2007).

PROJECT UPDATES
Fluxys is adding extra regasification
infrastructure and a fourth LNG storage
tank under a €165-million investment
plan. Commissioning of the expansion
was to begin by yearend.
Fluxys LNG, with a 93.20% stake,
owns and operates the Zeebrugge terminal.
Zeebrugge may well be the site
of the world’s first fixed ship-to-ship
transfer facility, if the Belgian shipping
company Exmar NV can gain approval
from the Brugge-Zeebrugge Port Authority. It filed its application in August
to build the LNG transfer installation
and high-pressure natural gas discharge
connection (OGJ Online, Aug. 2, 2007).
The facility would resemble UK’s
Teesside Gas Port plant but also could
handle transshipment of LNG between
carriers, said Exmar. Currently, Zeebrugge has Belgium’s only conventional jetty
to discharge LNG, operated by Fluxys.
Exmar said its project aims to
increase options for bringing natural
gas to Belgium and strengthening the
country’s position as a supply and gas
transit center.
Exmar is working with Ondernemingen Jan De Nul, Praxair Inc., Jacobs
Engineering Group Inc., ERM Benelux
in Belgium, and Ecolas NV in planning
construction and development of the
facility. The infrastructure is designed
for the simultaneous berthing of two
LNG carriers, either conventional or regasification vessels (LNGRV) capable of
regasifying LNG on board and injecting
gas directly into the national distribution grid.
In Germany, RWE Gas Midstream
announced plans in July to develop an
LNG import terminal at Wilhelmshaven
in northern Germany. German GasPort
will use Excelerate Energy’s shipboard
regasification technology to deliver the
gas directly into the German grid (OGJ
Online, July 9, 2007).
RWE, with Excelerate and Nord-West
Oelleitung GMBH, plans to deliver as
much as 600,000 cu m/hr of regasified
LNG into the German network starting
by yearend 2010.

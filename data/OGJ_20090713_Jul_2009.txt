Impacts estimated for hydraulic fracturing
US economic strength would be reduced by several billion dollars in the next 5 years if hydraulic fracturing was federally regulated, the second part of an American Petroleum Institute-commissioned study found.
Adopting proposals to essentially duplicate existing state regulations of a process that is helping to open up significant domestic
shale gas resources would lead to job losses and a wider trade deficit, API said on July 1 as it released the second part of the study by
IHS Global Insight.
The latest report looked at three scenarios: a hydraulic fracturing ban, restrictions on fluids that could be used, and the implementation of federal underground injection control (UIC) compliance regulations in addition to current state regulations.
With a total ban, the study said real gross domestic product
would plunge $374 billion, or 2.3%, from the economic reference case and 2.9 million jobs, or 2%, would be lost by 2014 as
a result of the 79% drop in oil and gas well completions which
would result.
US GDP would drop by $172 billion, or 1.1%, and 1.3 million
jobs, or 0.9%, would be lost under the study‚Äôs fluid restrictions
scenario. The UIC compliance approach, meanwhile, would cut
GDP by $84 billion, or 0.5%, and oil and gas industry payrolls by
635,000 jobs, or 0.4% during the same period, the study said.
Economies of the leading US gas production states (Texas, Louisiana, Wyoming, and Oklahoma) would probably be hit the hardest, although many states with little or no oil and gas production
would indirectly feel the effects rippling through the overall US
economy, it added. Impacts would be particularly severe in states
with relatively small economies such as Arkansas, Mississippi,
Montana, Utah, and Virginia, it said.
The latest report follows the study‚Äôs initial findings, which API
released on June 9. They indicated that the number of new US wells

&

‚Äî Q u i c k Ta k e s

drilled would drop 20.5%, reducing domestic gas production by
about 10% from 2008 levels if Congress placed additional federal
hydraulic fracturing regulations on top of existing state programs.
‚ÄúHydraulic fracturing is a safe, proven, 50-year-old technology
that is critical to developing the natural gas used to heat homes,
generate electricity, and create basic materials for fertilizers and
plastics,‚Äù said API Pres. Jack N. Gerard. ‚ÄúMore than 1 million wells
have been completed using this technology. Unnecessary additional regulation of this practice would only hurt the nation‚Äôs energy
security and threaten our economy.‚Äù

Santos increases its CSM assets
Santos Ltd., Adelaide, increased its coal seam methane (CSM)
assets in Australia with a corporate acquisition and an acreage buy
in the Gunnedah basin of northern New South Wales.
The company acquired 19.9% interest in Sydney-based CSM explorer and producer Eastern Star Gas Ltd. from ESG‚Äôs major shareholder Hillgrove Resources Ltd. for $176 million (Aus.).
In addition, Santos paid Gastar Exploration Ltd. $300 million
for its 35% interest in several Gunnedah basin permits and production areas operated by ESG.
Santos said the Gunnedah area could be the country‚Äôs second major CSM province after the Surat/Bowen Basin of eastern
Queensland.
The combination of ESG and Santos permits in northern New
South Wales will cover 63,000 sq km. Santos estimates a resource
potential in excess of 50 tcf of gas.
Santos first entered the region in 2007 and is already undertaking a 23-well exploration program. ESG has been in the basin since
2002 and is recognized as the leading independent explorer.
ESG‚Äôs Narrabri CSM joint venture‚Äôs drilling program is on track
to delineate 1,300 petajoules of proved and probable CSM gas reserves by yearend. ‚ú¶

‚Äî Q u i c k Ta k e s

McMoRan Ô¨Ånds apparent pay below Mound Point structure encountered in the original Blueberry Hill well. It plans to
Log-while-drilling tools indicated an encouraging 150 gross ft
of resistive zones at the Blueberry Hill deep gas exploratory sidetrack well in Louisiana State Lease 340 just off western St. Mary
Parish on the Gulf of Mexico shelf, said McMoRan Exploration Co.,
New Orleans.
McMoRan plans to deepen the well, now at 21,900 ft true vertical
depth, to 24,000 ft after it resolves an undisclosed mechanical issue.
The wellsite is in 10 ft of water southeast of Mound Point oil
and gas field, discovered in 1958.
McMoRan reentered an existing well bore on Mar. 29 and sidetracked to target Miocene Gyro sands downdip on the flank of the

run wireline logs across the resistive zones. Deepening to 24,000 ft
is to evaluate other prospective sands found in the first well.
The Blueberry Hill structure, an example of McMoRan‚Äôs deeper
pool concept, appears to have large reserve potential and further
development and exploration opportunities, the company said. It
is 11 miles southeast of Flatrock, another deeper pool field with six
wells capable of totaling 300 MMcfd of gas equivalent.
Blueberry Hill represents the deeper expression of the structural
features of the shallower Mound Point field, which has produced
more than 2.5 tcf of gas equivalent from multiple wells above
12,500 ft.

Sonatrach, GDF Suez to develop project in Algeria
Algeria‚Äôs Sonatrach and GDF Suez SA of France announced plans
to develop the Touat gas license in west-central Algeria, in the Timimoun basin near Adrar.
This follows an exploration and appraisal campaign that began
in 2003 with seven wells. The development plan was approved by
the National Agency for the Promotion of Hydrocarbon Resources
(ALNAFT).
Development will start this year with gas production due on
stream in 2013 and peaking at 4.5 billion cu m/year.
Sonatrach and GDF Suez will jointly operate the Touat project
involving development of 10 fields in an area of 3,000 sq km on
which 40 production wells will be drilled. The project also includes
construction of gas collection and processing installations as well
as a connection to the pipeline Sonatrach is planning to build to
link fields in the area to Hassi R‚ÄôMel.
Sonatrach will be in charge of selling the gas produced. GDF
Suez is one of the largest liquefied natural gas companies in the
world and the largest buyer of Sonatrach‚Äôs LNG.
The 10 fields are Hassi Ilatou, Hassi Ilatou Cambrien, Hassi
Ilaout Nord Est, Gour Nefrat Gedinnen, Gour Nefrat Ordovicien,
Bou Hadid, Bou Hadid Ouest, Oued Hamou, Oued Zine, and
Sbaa.

Israel‚Äôs Tamar gas may vie with LNG terminal
Noble Energy Inc., Houston, hiked its resource estimate 26% to
6.3 tcf after the Tamar appraisal well in the eastern Mediterranean

However, the Noble Energy group may have to compete with
LNG because Israel‚Äôs Natural Gas Authority last week published
prequalification documents in connection with construction of

Production

Tyrihans Ô¨Åeld off Norway starts production
StatoilHydro started production from the subsea completed
Tyrihans oil and gas field in the Norwegian Sea on July 8.
Tyrihans subsea facilities, in 270 m of water, tie back to existing
installations and infrastructure on the Kristin and Asgard fields in
the Halten Bank area.
The field consists of two parts. Tyrihans South is an oil field with
a gas cap and Tyrihans North is a gas-condensate discovery with a
thin oil zone. The field lies in Blocks 6406/3 and 6407/1.
StatoilHydro estimates that the field has recoverable reserves of
186 million bbl of oil and condensate, and 41.5 million cu m of
gas.
A 43-km pipeline transports the production from Tyrihans to
Kristin for processing. From Kristin, the gas is transported ashore
through the Asgard Transport pipeline while oil and condensate proceed to the Asgard C storage ship for onward transport by tanker.

an LNG receiving terminal by 2013. Noble Energy Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Charles Davidson said the group‚Äôs focus is
to ship Tamar gas to shore by 2012.
Tamar-2, in 5,530 ft of water on the flank of the structure 3.5
miles northeast of the Tamar-1 discovery well, considerably reduced
the uncertainty in previous resource estimates, Noble Energy said.
Total depth is 16,880 ft.
Tamar-2 found reservoir thickness and quality consistent with
those at Tamar-1. It encountered the gas-water contact as projected
in the middle reservoir and, as expected, no water contact was seen
in the top reservoir.
Noble Energy obtained whole core samples in three reservoirs
to assist in geologic and engineering studies needed for field development and retained a reservoir consulting firm to prepare an
independent estimate of the discovered resource.
The 6.3 tcf figure is double the predrill resource estimate for the
prospect (see map, OGJ, Oct. 6, 2008, p. 41).
Noble Energy said the Tamar and Dalit discoveries represent
‚Äúperhaps 2 decades of future supply [of gas for Israel] based on
projected needs.‚Äù
Noble Energy operates the Matan license, on which Tamar was
drilled, with 36% working interest. Other interest owners in the
wells are Isramco Negev 2 with 28.75%, Delek Drilling 15.625%,
Avner Oil Exploration 15.625%, and Dor Gas Exploration 4%.
The group is preparing to shoot 1,200 sq miles of 3D seismic
over several leads on its acreage in the Levantine basin starting in
the third quarter.
The government said buying LNG internationally would provide a backup to domestic supplies. It estimated maximum capacity
of the LNG terminal at as much as 560 MMcfd but said early imports would likely be small because of the offshore gas discoveries,
implying possible priority for Tamar and Dalit.
Israel‚Äôs existing gas comes from Egypt and from fields in shallower water than Tamar.
Israel‚Äôs gas demand has been rising for several years, but overall
prospects for world LNG demand remain bleak (OGJ Online, July
1, 2009). ‚ú¶

Kristin and Tyrihans share the same operations organization.
Statoil Hydro says that Tyrihans is the largest field being brought
on stream off Norway this year.
Drilling in the field, discovered in 1982-83, will continue
for the next 2 years and StatoilHydro expects the field to reach a
96,000-boe/d plateau production in 2016-17.
In 2005, StatoilHydro submitted the development and operation plan to the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, which approved
the plan in February 2006.
The company installed the seabed templates in spring 2007 and
began drilling wells in April 2008.
The development plan includes the installation of a subsea seawater injection facility for reservoir pressure support in summer
2010.
Statoil expects the field to continue to produce until yearend
2029.

Petrofac brings Don Southwest Ô¨Åeld on stream

KNOC acquires riserless mud recovery technology

Petrofac Energy Developments started oil production from two
wells on Don Southwest (Don SW) in the UK northern North Sea,
adding to initial output from the nearby West Don field that began
in April.
Total peak production from both fields is expected to reach
more than 40,000 b/d.
During the second half of 2010, the company plans to bring
on stream additional production and injection wells for the second
phase of the Don SW development.
Petrofac is interpreting the structure and lateral of a 60 ft oil
column in the Brent formation after drilling a sidetrack to an adjacent fault block, Area H, directly south of Don SW field. This was
done to investigate the northern part of the block at low incremental cost.
Amjad Bseisu, chief executive of Petrofac Energy Developments,
said the company is firming up plans for a 2010 campaign to optimize Area 5/6 development ‚Äúand the early indications of our
success in Area H give us confidence in the prospectivity of the
surrounding areas.‚Äù
Don SW is an oil field comprising 450 ft thick Brent sequence
sandstones, as producing in the nearby Thistle and South Magnus
fields. The under-saturated oil is held in a combination of dip and
fault traps at a depth of 11,000-11,500 ft.

Korea National Oil Corp. (KNOC) signed a $9 million drilling contract with AGR Drilling Services to use its riserless mud
recovery system technology off Sakhalin Island later this year and
in 2010.
AGR Drilling, part of AGR Group ASA at Straume, Norway, said
its technology would enable KNOC to return drilling fluids and
cuttings topside without a riser system and reduce the impact on
the environmentally sensitive area.
This is the second time AGR Drilling Services will be supporting
drilling operations in the Pacific region.
KNOC has different blocks in Russia: Tigil, Icha, and West Kamchatka. Tigil block is off the Kamchatka Peninsula and covers 3,264
sq km. KNOC and its partners are required to shoot 2D seismic, as
well as drill two exploration wells by 2010.
Icha is an onshore block spanning 3,100 sq km and is near Tigil.
KNOC and its partners will shoot 2D seismic and drill one exploration well during 2010.
KNOC is exploring the West Kamchatka block in the Okhotsk
Sea in partnership with OAO Rosneft. This acreage covers 62,680
sq km in less than 300 m of water.
Last year it shot 2D and 3D seismic and drilled one exploration
well. Its operations are controversial as this block is in an area that
is one of the world‚Äôs richest producers of salmon and hundreds of
other aquatic species. ‚ú¶

Start-up delayed for Kuwait styrene unit
Start-up of Kuwait Styrene Co.‚Äôs ethyl benzene styrene monomer unit in Kuwait has been delayed 4-8 weeks by a technical
problem with an intermediate storage tank used in the production
of styrene monomer.
Officials said they do not know how long the start-up may be
delayed, pending a technical assessment of the tank. The unit expected to begin commercial operations within a few days. It was
due to start up in the second quarter, according to previous company statements.

KSC, a major producer of olefins in Kuwait, is in contact with
customers and has developed plans to help mitigate any production shortfall due to the delay, officials said.
The unit is within Equate Petrochemical Co.‚Äôs complex in the
Shuaiba Industrial Area. The KSC plant is designed to produce
450,000 tonnes/year of ethyl benzene and 500,000 tonnes/year
of styrene monomer. Those facilities will be operated by Equate,
a firm largely owned by Petrochemical Industries Co. and Dow
Chemical Co. KSC is a joint venture of Dow Chemical and government-owned Kuwait Aromatics Co. ‚ú¶

Tangguh LNG sends out Ô¨Årst cargo
Indonesia‚Äôs Tangguh LNG project, the country‚Äôs third LNG center after Bontang and Arun, lifted its first cargo on July 6, according
to operator BP PLC. The liquefaction plant is in Papua Barat.
The first cargo marks start-up of the project, slightly more than
4 years after its final approval by the Indonesian government March
2005. The cargo, aboard the Tangguh Foja, sailed for POSCO‚Äôs LNG
regasification terminal in Gwangyang, South Korea.
Tangguh consists of the development of six gas fields in the
Wiriagar, Berau, and Muturi production-sharing contracts in the
Bintuni area of Papua in eastern Indonesia. Gas produced from two
normally unmanned offshore platforms is fed via 22-km pipelines
to two onshore liquefaction trains, each with a production capacity
of 3.8 million tonnes/year of LNG.
Train 1 began LNG production in mid-June, said BP, producing
the LNG for the first cargo, and Train 2 will begin later this year.
BP Indonesia (37.16% interest) operates Tangguh as a contractor to the Indonesian oil and gas regulator, BPMigas. Other partners
in the project are MI Berau BV (16.3%), CNOOC Ltd. (13.9%),
Nippon Oil Exploration (Berau) Ltd. (12.23%), KG Berau/KG Wiriagar (10%), LNG Japan Corp. (7.35%), and Talisman (3.06%).
The project has long-term contracts to supply 2.6 million tpy
of LNG to China‚Äôs Fujian terminal, 1.15 million tpy to K-Power
and POSCO in South Korea, and a flexible contract to supply up
to 3.7 million tpy to Sempra‚Äôs LNG regasification terminal in Baja
California, Mexico.
Main engineering contractors for the Tangguh project‚Äôs onshore
infrastructure are the KJP consortium: Kellogg, Brown & Root
(through its subsidiary PT Brown & Root Indonesia), JGC Corp.,
and PT Pertafenikki Engineering. Lead contractor for offshore and
subsea construction was Saipem.

‚Äî Q u i c k Ta k e s

Michael A. Creel, Enterprise president and chief executive officer, said the facility provides the necessary services to support
ExxonMobil‚Äôs Piceance project and ‚Äúcomplements our recently
completed Meeker II expansion.‚Äù That expansion doubled gas processing capacity at the complex.
The CTF treats natural gas to remove impurities then compresses that treated gas for transportation to Meeker. There, Enterprise
can use its standalone 200 MMcfd dewpoint-control plant for processing or route the stream through one of the larger cryogenic
processing units.
Completion of the Meeker Phase II expansion brought cryogenic processing capacity to 1.5 bcfd and allows extraction of as much
as 70,000 b/d of NGL, said the Enterprise announcement. Separation of NGLs into ethane, propane, butanes, and natural gasoline
renders the residue-gas stream acceptable for delivery into one of
several interstate transmission pipelines accessible to producers
through the White River Hub.
That hub is jointly owned by Enterprise and Questar Pipeline Co.
Through Enterprise‚Äôs Mid-America Pipeline and Seminole systems,
the extracted NGLs can be delivered to the partnership‚Äôs Hobbs and
Mont Belvieu, Tex., fractionation facilities.
Meeker and the new CTF are part of a 30-year midstream services agreement Enterprise has with ExxonMobil, which has estimated 45 tcf of potential natural gas on its acreage in the Piceance
basin, said Enterprise.
Total gas production among all the producers in the basin,
which covers more than 6,000 square miles, currently exceeds 1.5
bcfd from more than 6,000 wells, said the company. Additionally,
production has been growing at about 23%/year over the past 6
years and continues to support sustainable drilling activities.

Authorization pulled for GDF Suez terminal
Enterprise opens central treating facility
Initial volumes of natural gas have begun flowing into the new
central treating facility (CTF) in Rio Blanco County, Colo., owned
and operated by Enterprise Products Partners LP. The facility was
completed in fourth-quarter 2008.
Located about 8 miles south of Enterprise‚Äôs recently expanded
Meeker gas processing complex, the CTF can handle as much as
200 MMcfd and handles production from ExxonMobil‚Äôs properties in nearby Piceance basin. Production from those, according
to the Enterprise announcement, is currently running about 100
MMcfd.

The Marseille Administrative Court rescinded the authorization
granted by regional executive authorities for operation of the GDF
Suez methane terminal under construction at Fos-sur-Mer.
The terminal was undergoing final tests before its launch at yearend. Authorization was rescinded after an association for protection of the coastline pointed to the absence of certain documents‚Äî
including a seismic survey‚Äîfrom the public inquiry process.
GDF Suez said it would appeal. Meanwhile, as the reauthorization process will be lengthy, the company will request provisional
authorization since ‚Äúthe project is strategic for southern France,‚Äù
officials reported. ‚ú¶

Energy crash landing

_____________

12

As one reads the editorials of June
1‚Äîon the mind-numbing subsidies for
renewable energy‚Äîand June 9‚Äîon the
costs of ‚Äúcap and trade‚Äù and ‚Äúenergy
reform that will asphyxiate itself with
unreasonable ambition and government
excess,‚Äù plus the note in the commentary on the likelihood of any benefits
being allocated ‚Äúon the basis of political
favoritism,‚Äù a sense of absolute gloom
and doom emerges (OGJ, June 1, 2009,
p. 18; June 8, p. 18). It would seem that
this administration is forcing our energy
system towards a crash landing of unprecedented proportions.
Today, we hear much about the danger of fossil fuels, particularly coal. The
alarmists, in their efforts to do to coal
what they have done to nuclear energy,
have now painted coal as the pariah of
all energy sources. Oil is not treated
much better.
I have recently written on an analogy
between a crash landing in the desert
and in our energy situation today. The
title is ‚ÄúThe Flight of the Phoenix Revisited.‚Äù The subtitle is ‚ÄúWe Can Live with
a Fossil Fuel World‚ÄìOil, Gas, Coal and

This essay is a fairly complete situation review of most energy sources.
Conclusions reached include:
‚Ä¢ While alternative energy sources
can make a contribution, they will not
be the solution to our current crisis; we
will be using fossil fuels for decades to
come.
‚Ä¢ The pathway to price security is to
reduce our call on global oil via a boost
in our conventional supplies of domestic
oil and gas via an expanded use of coal,
via a start on shale oil, via an improvement in electric vehicles and their
necessary electric supply, and via more
efficiency and conservation.
‚Ä¢ The massive expansion of nuclear
power proposed by Sen. John McCain
(R-Ariz.) is seen as desirable but highly
unlikely.
‚Ä¢ The most encouraging research
area is the development of high energydensity batteries.

‚Ä¢ The most discouraging commercial
area is the incredible support and subsidies for corn-based ethanol.
‚Ä¢ The climate change situation in
regards to fossil fuel use, is manageable,
and the need to move to a carbon-constrained society is premature at best.
‚Ä¢ The environmental situation with
coal is manageable, a judgment based
in part on my lifetime exposure to coal
and in part on the improvements in
emissions control over the past 40 years.
This essay also reviews, as food for
thought, my rather detailed, 76-year
exposure to coal dust, heavy oils, and
toxic chemicals and leads to the question: Could the nightmare painted on
fossil fuels just be overstated a bit?

The biology of oil

Steven Poruban
Senior Editor
It‚Äôs always interesting to discover
the ways in which various scientific
disciplines intertwine with the oil and
gas industry. While traditional research
and development is being conducted
by scientists specializing in petroleum
biology to enhance efforts of extracting and processing hydrocarbons, other
R&D companies pour their efforts into
finding ways to bypass hydrocarbons
completely, opting to produce a ‚Äúgreener,‚Äù more-renewable source of oil.

Microbiology

diverse group of microorganisms that
decrease the level of sulfate in minerals
such as oil. But as they reduce sulfate,
they produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S),
a highly toxic substance causing one
of the petroleum industry‚Äôs biggest
problems, souring. And that lowers the
economic value of oil and carries major
safety hazards.‚Äù
Al-Humam says, ‚ÄúUnfortunately,
for years, industries disregarded the
concept of biological souring of oil
field reservoirs. This resulted in production facilities being designed and built
without consideration of the long-term
effects that microorganisms might have
on the operation and maintenance of
these facilities.‚Äù
Aramco says that Al-Humam‚Äôs
research ‚Äúoffers a new, alternative
approach to controlling SRB levels
through repeated injections of nitrate.‚Äù
Al-Humam‚Äôs study was conducted
in two parts: first in laboratory experiments and then in a field trial in
Aramco‚Äôs Hawtah oil field. ‚ÄúThe trial
showed that injecting nitrate into the
water-distribution system limited SRB
activity and H2S production, was 43%
more cost-efficient than other methods,
and improved well operation by 1215%,‚Äù Aramco said.
Al-Humam‚Äôs research was presented
at the Reservoir Microbiology Forum,
held by the British Energy Institute in
London, and at the Corrosion Conference held by NACE International. EI‚Äôs
next RMF is slated for Nov. 24-25 in
London.

Abdulmohsen A. Al-Humam, a member of the biotechnology group at Saudi
Aramco‚Äôs research and development
center, has been working on methods
to control microorganisms that cause
problems in water-injection systems
and oil-field reservoirs.
Recent research by Al-Humam could
have far-reaching effects on oil production in Saudi Arabia, Aramco reports.
His thesis for earning a PhD in petroleum microbiology, ‚ÄúEffects of Nitrate
on Mixed Bacterial Communities in an
Oilfield Water Distribution System,‚Äù
sheds light on the processes that control
microorganisms at oil facilities.
In a recent company publication,
Aramco described the issue: ‚ÄúWater is

unlikely biological source.
OriginOil Inc. is developing a breakthrough technology that will transform
algae, ‚Äúthe most promising source of
renewable oil,‚Äù into ‚Äúa true competitor
to petroleum,‚Äù the company says. The
company‚Äôs web site (www.originoil.
com)
___ contains videos of the process.
OriginOil explains: ‚ÄúMuch of
the world‚Äôs oil and gas is made up
of ancient algae deposits. Today, our
technology will produce ‚Äúnew oil‚Äù
from algae, through a cost-effective,
high-speed manufacturing process.
This endless supply of new oil can be
used for many products such as diesel,
gasoline, jet fuel, plastics, and solvents
without the global warming effects of

Low-carbon fuel problems
Producers in Alberta‚Äôs oil sands region rightly
worry about one of the worst ideas in the rich stew
of energy-policy poison now at high boil in the US.
The idea is the low-carbon fuel standard
(LCFS). By itself, a carefully implemented LCFS
might hold promise as a way to trim emissions of
carbon dioxide. Together with the heavy, indirect
taxation of fossil energy that probably will be enacted, however, it represents stifling overkill. And
the recent US record makes careful implementation most unlikely.
The 1,428-page American Clean Energy and Security Act, which the House passed June 26 before
anyone had any grasp of everything it contained,
originally included an LCFS. That the passed bill
does not is a hopeful sign. But the Senate has yet
to act. And California implemented an LCFS in
April and savors its status as national leader in the
establishment of ruinous energy policy. A group of
states in the US Northeast is working on a regional
LCFS and hope to have a preliminary agreement in
place by yearend.

Reason to worry
Oil sands producers, therefore, have reason to
worry. In its LCFS regulation, California excludes
oil-sands crude from the ‚Äúbasket‚Äù of fuels available in the state, which will benchmark declining
‚Äúcarbon intensity‚Äù targets. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers objects. ‚ÄúSingling out
Canada‚Äôs oil sands was unnecessary and inappropriate,‚Äù it said in response to California‚Äôs move.
‚ÄúOn a life-cycle basis, Canadian oil sands crude
compares favorably with many other crude oils
currently supplying California, including some
domestic California crude oils.‚Äù
Alone, California‚Äôs disproportionate regulation won‚Äôt hurt Alberta‚Äôs oil sands industry. The
state receives only about 27,000 b/d of oil from
Canada, some of it originating in the oil sands.
The concern north of the border is that California
will set a pattern of discrimination against what
has been called the ‚Äúdirty oil‚Äù from Alberta‚Äôs rich
deposits of bitumen. It‚Äôs a concern that began with
an ambiguous section of the Energy Independence
and Security Act of 2007 banning imports by federal agencies of fuels with above-average life-cycle
emissions of CO2. Since then, demonization of
‚Äútar sands‚Äù has been a popular ploy of the envi18

ronmental groups that back Democratic leaders in
Congress and the White House.
Emissions associated with fuels from oil sands
are, in fact, too easily exaggerated. Studies are showing that, from production to consumption, average
CO2 emissions from a given quantity of fuel from
oil sands exceed those of average conventional oils
by 10-20% (see story, p. 20). That‚Äôs far less than
what environmentalist propaganda suggests.
In California and elsewhere, LCFS regulation
has other problems. Large among them is the assumption that regulators can measure life-cycle
emissions with reasonable precision. They can‚Äôt.
Inevitably, life-cycle assessment is more political than scientific. Prominent evidence of this is
ethanol promoters‚Äô campaign to exempt land-use
changes in assessments of emissions associated
with their favorite fuel additive.
Indeed, LCFS regulation largely assumes the
displacement of hydrocarbon fuels by biofuels,
which are presumed to have life-cycle emission
advantages. But those advantages are proving to be
illusory, especially in analyses that account for the
indirect effects of expanding agriculture. Hence
the ethanol lobby‚Äôs latest crusade.

Bad business
What‚Äôs more, biofuels have become bad business for everyone except grain farmers. Refiners
are buying ethanol plants out of bankruptcy at
fire-sale prices to secure supply with which to
meet blending mandates. Yet in its announcement about implementation of the LCFS in April,
California‚Äôs Air Resources Board bragged about
the need for 25 new biofuel facilities and the associated creation of 3,000 jobs. Hello? Without
subsidization likely not to be forthcoming from
a bankrupt state government, who will build the
things?
The formulaic approach of LCFS regulation
creates the impression of serious governance.
The government sets a target for cutting life-cycle
emissions and lets the market bring forth essential technologies. Inevitably, however, the target is
arbitrary. Inevitably, work toward it reflects politics
rather than commerce. So, inevitably, LCFS proves
to be yet another costly, underperforming environmental gesture that mainly encourages Canadian
producers to sell oil in Asia. ‚ú¶

New controls on emissions of
greenhouse gases will raise the costs of
petroleum supplied from oil sands by
amounts that depend on the extent of
regulation and on progress in abatement technologies.
The extra emissions associated with
oil sands have attracted intense environmental scrutiny and spawned efforts to
limit consumption of products derived
from bitumen.
According to a
report on
the Canadian oil sands
published
in May by the Council on Foreign Relations Center for Geoeconomic Studies,

The average emissions from these
operations in the oil sands are nearly
three times those of the average barrel
of oil consumed in the US.
But emissions vary among oil sands
projects. Levi cites a recent RAND study
that found greenhouse-gas emissions
from production and upgrading of oil
sands range from 70 kg/bbl to 130 kg/
bbl‚Äî10-20% more than the average
barrel of oil consumed in the US.
Emissions from oil sands would increase with a shift in process fuels from
natural gas to coal or raw bitumen;
they would decrease with technological
improvements.
‚ÄúThe latter trend has recently dominated,‚Äù Levi says.
The analyst also points out that

Energy and climate change are

greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the
two are linked.
Many activists and some policymakers embrace an approach requiring
ultimate elimination of the use of all
fossil fuels. They support their replacement with renewable alternatives such

and worldwide energy demand. North
America‚Äôs oil sands reserves are squarely
in the middle of the debate.
Global energy demand is increasing
rapidly and shows no signs of declining.
That is actually a good sign, as energy
fuels economic growth. The exploding
growth of emerging economies such as
China and India and the desire of their
citizens for the quality of life long taken
for granted by Western nations guarantee more energy use, not less.
A study last month by Cambridge
Energy Research Associates (CERA),
Growth in the Canadian Oil Sands:
Finding the New Balance, projects that
by 2035 global oil demand will reach

‚ÄúAlternative forms of energy, such
as biofuels, wind, and solar power,
will play a growing role in satisfying
higher demand, but so will fossil fuels,
including oil,‚Äù adds the report. ‚ÄúIndeed,
all forms of energy‚Äìas well as greater
efficiency‚Äìwill be needed to deliver and
support higher living standards around
the world.‚Äù
In the US, where energy demand is
growing more slowly, the Energy Information Administration estimates usage

2007.

‚ÄúEven in a world of relatively slow

fossil fuels will constitute the majority of our energy supply portfolio long

Others believe these alternatives are
merely wishful thinking. They see the
alternatives as having promise for the

Special Report

Oil sands story
The story of the oil sands is a story
about people and communities. When
industry talks about the economic benefits of the oil sands, it does so at the
risk of being accused of downplaying
the importance of environmental issues.
But, clearly, Canadians and Americans
expect oil sands development to occur
responsibly, and the oil sands industry
is focused on meeting those expectations without sacrificing jobs, economic
benefits, or strategic energy supply
advantages.
The CERA report also highlights the
direct link between economic growth
and the need for continuous improvement in environmental performance.
Can higher environmental standards be
achieved? The record shows that the industry has a strong track record, including a 38% reduction in greenhouse gas
emission intensity since 1990, 80‚Äì95%
recycle rate on process water, use of
undrinkable water from deep salty aquifers for new oil sands projects, ongoing
reclamation of project sites, as well as
a suite of emerging technologies that
promise to further reduce energy input
requirements and subsequent emissions
as well as improve water management.
It‚Äôs also worth noting that Alberta
was the first jurisdiction in North
America to implement a carbon pricing
system ($15/tonne of CO2 levy into a
technology fund), and it has created a
market for offsets. In addition, Alberta
last year established a $2 billion fund to
stimulate early development of carbon
capture and sequestration projects.
The stakes are high for both the
US and Canada. Numerous reports,
including CERA‚Äôs recent report, point
to the potential for significant growth
in Canada‚Äôs share of US oil imports. But
the study also notes that ‚Äúa key challenge for continued cooperation is the
development of a common framework
for regulating greenhouse gas emissions.‚Äù

IEA: World oil demand to reach 89 million b/d by 2014
The latest forecast by the International Energy Agency states that global
oil demand will rise 0.6%/year during
2008-14, pushing demand to average
89 million b/d in 2014 from 85.8 million b/d last year.
In its Medium-Term Oil Market
Report, IEA bases its outlook on the International Monetary Fund‚Äôs economic
forecast, which sees global economic
activity gradually rebounding by nearly
5%/year from 2012 onwards.
Developing countries, those that are
not members of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development, will drive oil-demand growth,
while oil consumption within the
OECD will decline over the forecast
period, IEA said.
Also, transportation fuels will drive
the growth in oil demand. In nonOECD countries, demand for transportation, boiler, and industrial fuels will
all rise at a relatively rapid pace, but
distillate will be the growth drivers, followed by LPG, naphtha, and gasoline.
Meanwhile, within the OECD,
demand growth of motor gasoline, jet
fuel, and diesel after 2009 will be modest and insufficient to offset declines in
demand for heating oil, residual fuel
oil, and industrial feedstocks, according
to the report.

agency said.
During 2008-14, IEA forecasts that
naphtha demand in North America
will decline on average 8.6%/year, as
petrochemical activity declines in the
US and Canada as other, more-competitive petrochemical production areas
emerge. Growth in demand is expected
in Mexico, but from a low base.
Gasoline demand in North America
will climb 0.6%/year to average 11
million b/d in 2014. And demand for
jet fuel and kerosine in the region will
rise by the same rate to reach an average
1.8 million b/d, as economic recovery
boosts air travel, offsetting efficiency
gains in aircraft fleets and airline operations.
Demand for gas oil in North America
will be unchanged over the period,
averaging 5 million b/d, while declining use of fuel oil for power generation
is expected to cause demand to shrink
8.5%/year to average 700,000 b/d in
2014.

marginally, demand for all other major
refined products in OECD Pacific countries of Australia, Japan, New Zealand,
and South Korea will decline over the
forecast period.
Naphtha demand will grow strongly
in South Korea but decline rapidly
in Japan as other, more-competitive
petrochemical producers emerge in
the Middle East and China. Demand for
fuel oil will decline across the region,
displaced by natural gas and nuclear
energy.

Other regions

IEA forecasts that oil product demand in the Middle East will grow
4.3%/year on average to reach 8.9
million b/d in 2014, up from 7 million
b/d in 2008.
The drivers of this growth are sustained economic expansion based on oil

Oil supply
IEA sees non-OPEC oil supply slipping by a net 400,000 b/d by 2014
from 2008. In its previous projection,
the agency forecast 6-year growth of
1.5 million b/d for these producers.
Downward revisions are focused
on the former Soviet Union and the
Canadian oil sands. Otherwise, IEA
expects sustained conventional oil supply growth through 2014 in Canada,
the US Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, and the
Caspian.
OPEC crude production capacity will
be a modest 1.7 million b/d, reaching 35.8 million b/d in 2014. This
compares to the agency‚Äôs year-earlier
projection of 3.2 million b/d in capacity growth over the period. This lower
outlook is based on weaker demand,
contract negotiation, reduced cash flow,
geopolitical turmoil, and increased
resource nationalism, IEA said.
Supply of NGL and condensate from
OPEC will rise by 2.6 million b/d to
7.3 million b/d over the forecast period. ‚ú¶

carbon costs

N

atural gas‚Äôs position as a cleaner
form of energy and possible
bridge to renewable and alternative
sources isn‚Äôt insulating it from closer environmental scrutiny. Critics say carbon
consequences of producing gas need to
be examined more closely, especially in
the Rocky Mountains. Federal analysts
and regulators apparently agree.
‚ÄúWe have a lot of natural gas. It is
cleaner-burning than coal, but it does
have carbon emissions and impacts
from its production, particularly on
regions and communities near where
it‚Äôs produced,‚Äù said Sharon Buccino, the
Natural Resources Defense Council‚Äôs
Land and Wildlife Program director.
Possible groundwater contamination from hydraulic fracturing or
other production processes is the
biggest issue, she said during a June
24 forum on gas at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies.
But carbon resulting from gas exploration, development, and production
shouldn‚Äôt be overlooked, she said.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre reviewing the analysis of
life-cycle impacts of gas production.
It‚Äôs an area that hasn‚Äôt been examined
closely and bears closer analysis,‚Äù said a
second panelist, Michael Schaal, oil and
gas division director in the US Energy
Information Administration‚Äôs integrated
analysis and forecasting group.

‚ÄòBuilt on assumptions‚Äô
‚ÄúThis is an issue that‚Äôs built on
assumptions. We need to get our
arms around real numbers,‚Äù said the
panel‚Äôs third member, Frank A. Verrastro, director of CSIS‚Äôs Energy and
National Security Program.
The US Environmental Protection Agency has prepared a draft
assessment, which is open for public
26

comment, of some environmental
impacts associated with oil and gas
E&P activity in the Mountain West.
‚ÄúAmong other preliminary findings, the assessment suggests an overall
increase in some impacts from natural
gas exploration and production. These
findings suggest the need for further
study regarding the environmental
impacts of unconventional [gas E&P],‚Äù
an EPA spokesman told me.
Such research helps EPA and others
understand more about both causes
and potential means to address pollution-related impacts, the spokesman
said. The draft study, ‚ÄúAn Assessment
of the Environmental Implications of
Oil and Gas Production: A Regional
Case Study,‚Äù is online at www.epa.
gov/sectors/pdf/oil-gas-report.pdf.

Producers‚Äô early steps
Some producers already are taking
steps to determine carbon impacts
from their operations, according to
a member of the second panel at the
CSIS forum. David A. Trice, president
of America‚Äôs Natural Gas Alliance,
said that its member companies are
each preparing sustainability reports.
Trice, who recently retired as
Newfield Exploration Co.‚Äôs chief
executive officer, said the Houstonbased independent is trying to manage its carbon footprint already. ‚ÄúWe
know it‚Äôs going to be required and
our shareholders will demand it. But
we‚Äôve only started and won‚Äôt have
any answers for about a year,‚Äù he said.
Buccino said that carbon emissions management is only part of the
gas production improvements that
are needed. ‚ÄúThere are ways we can
get it out of the ground which minimize the impacts,‚Äù she said. ‚ú¶

Gov. Sarah H. Palin confers with Lt. Gov. Sean Parnell
on July 3 soon after Palin‚Äôs resignation announcement.
Parnell said that he plans to keep construction of a
massive natural gas pipeline from the North Slope a
top priority after he takes over on July 26.
Republican Don Young, Alaska‚Äôs lone
US House member, said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm as surprised as anyone by this announcement,
but I support her decision and I wish
her well.‚Äù
In her speech, Palin said her administration‚Äôs accomplishments spoke
for themselves. ‚ÄúWe aggressively and
responsibly develop our resources
because they were created to better our
world, to help people, and we protect
the environment and Alaskans (the
resource owners) foremost with our
policies,‚Äù she stated.

‚ÄòMassive bipartisan victory‚Äô
Palin said the Alaska Gasline Initiative Act (AGIA), which the legislature
passed soon after she took office, was
‚Äúa massive bipartisan victory‚Äù with a
58-1 vote, and that it is ‚Äúsucceeding
as intended, protecting Alaskans as our
clean natural gas will flow to energize
us, and America, through a competitive,
proprivate sector project.‚Äù
During her administration, Palin
said, Alaska established a petroleum
integrity office to oversee safe development, worked to bring oil and gas
activity back to Point Thomson for the
first time in decades, and passed a new
oil and gas tax, ACES (for Alaska‚Äôs Clear
and Equitable Share).

She said ACES ‚Äúis working as intended and industry is publicly acknowledging its success,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúOur new
oil and gas clear and equitable formula
is so Alaskans will no longer be taken
advantage of. ACES incentivizes new
exploration and development and jobs
that were previously not going to happen with a monopolized North Slope
oil basin.‚Äù
Palin said her administration‚Äôs accomplishments also included ethics
reforms, slowing down the growth
of government, strong support for
education, and breaking ground on a
new prison. ‚ÄúWe built a subcabinet on
climate change and took heat from outside special interests for our biologically
sound wildlife management for abundance,‚Äù she said. She added that she was
ready to take credit, but only for hiring
the right people.
She also said she felt compelled to
speak out on energy, national security,
and other issues and to campaign for
candidates who share her views, but
not while trying to still be governor in
a toxic political environment she said
developed after Republican presidential
nominee John McCain made her his
running mate last year.
Parnell said Alaska has a good team
of state government officials to keep it
moving forward. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got an extremely talented team of commissioners, and I intend to keep them working
hard for our state. I will work with the
governor to coordinate with the cabinet
and staff on a seamless, stable transition.
And I will work closely with legislators, community leaders, and individual
Alaskans to accomplish these ends,‚Äù he
said. ‚ú¶

ASSE: OSHA discusses reÔ¨Åning NEP audits

Some refineries and their contractors are receiving a high number of
violations as a result of the National
Emphasis Program (NEP), US Occupational Safety and Health Administration

officials said June 29.
OSHA officials spoke to a meeting of
the American Society of Safety Engineers (ASSE) in San Antonio. US Department of Labor Secretary Hilda Solis
addressed ASSE in an opening session.
Solis assured ASSE members that OSHA

from the refining NEP, launched in June
2007.
The NEP involves detailed inspections of refiners and contractors (OGJ,
Sept. 8, 2008, p. 21).
OSHA implemented a refining NEP
based upon a US Chemical Safety and
Hazard Investigation Board recommendation following the deadly Mar. 23,

said although he could not immediately
elaborate.
Previously, OSHA sent letters to refinery managers emphasizing the need
to comply with all applicable OSHA
standards, particularly the process
safety management of highly hazardous
chemicals (OGJ Online, June 24, 2009).
OSHA sent letters to more than 100
refineries, outlining compliance issues
found under the refining NEP and urging refinery managers to comply with
the process safety management standards. The standard requires employers
to develop and incorporate comprehensive, site-specific safety management
systems to reduce the risks of fatal or
catastrophic incidents.

OSHA is working on vigorous enforcement efforts, and OSHA officials
along with Congress are evaluating the
current penalty structure for companies
found in violation of OSHA standards,
he said.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking at what we can do
under the law to increase those penalties,‚Äù he said.
Currently, the average nationwide
penalty across all industries for an
OSHA violation is about $900, he
said. ‚ÄúThis doesn‚Äôt provide much of

ASSE: Valero says VPP helped its contractors
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
Valero Energy Corp. said the Voluntary Protection Programs (VPP) helped
its contractors implement comprehensive safety and health management
systems. VPP is a cooperative program
offered by the US Occupational Safety
and Health Administration.
Sean Gillilan, a senior health and
safety specialist for Valero, told a meeting of the American Society of Safety
Engineers (ASSE) that seven contractors
at the company‚Äôs 205,000-b/cd Bill
Greehey Refinery in Corpus Christi,

‚ÄúThe more companies that are working with successful safety and health
programs, the safer the refinery will
be,‚Äù Gillilan said. ‚ÄúThe companies that
embrace the VPP concept of continuous
improvement are no longer stagnant in
safety but are now constantly improving
every year.‚Äù
Valero has 11 worksites in 5 states
participating in VPP. Nationwide, VPP
participation encompasses more than
2,200 worksites covering more than
800,000 workers. Numerous oil and

sites from routine inspections although
these sites are subject to inspections
following fatalities, serious injuries, and
complaints from workers about safety

Peace needed
in Xinjiang

I

f you believe Chinese oil and gas officials, ethnic clashes in the province
of Xinjiang‚Äîwhere 150 people are
reported to have been killed‚Äîhave not
affected any operations at oil fields or
pipelines.
Sinopec said its facilities are far from
the riots, and the situation in the westernmost area of Xinjiang appeared to
have stabilized last week. Sinopec owns
Tahe field in Xinjiang, which is one of
its largest fields in China.
PetroChina said its facilities were
not affected either. It operates two large
oil and gas fields in Xinjiang, one in
the Tarim basin in southern Xinjiang
and another in Kelamayi, northwest of
Urumqi. PetroChina also owns the 6
million tonne/year Dushanzi refinery.
No one denies such statements as
much of the rioting seems to have
taken place in and around Urumqi, the
provincial capital. Moreover, the riots
may well not result in wider attacks on
state energy infrastructure unless they
become more organized.

With an eye to shepherding even

Earlier this year, for example, China
and Kazakhstan agreed to a $10 billion
‚Äúloan-for-oil‚Äù deal that allows CNPC to
buy stakes in the company MangistauMunaigas‚Äîa strategic purchase as the
Kazakh firm owns the fields near the

drive away IOC‚Äôs, MEND militants July
5 claimed responsibility for bombing Chevron Nigeria Ltd.-owned Okan
manifold, which controls most of the
company's offshore oil to its loading
platform in Delta State.
‚ÄúThe strategic Okan manifold which
controls about 80% of Chevron Nigeria Ltd. offshore crude oil to its BOP
Crude Loading Platform was blown up
at about [8:45 p.m. on July 5],‚Äù the
militant group said in a statement.
A Chevron spokesman, who said an
investigation had already begun, said
the firm would make no comment on
the rebel claims.
In addition to that bombing, the
rebels also claimed to have seized the
chemical tanker, Sichem Peace, in Delta
State waters for ignoring a warning to
industry tankers to stay away from the
Niger Delta.
"Their arrest is meant to serve as a
warning to others that there are root
issues that have to be resolved with the
Nigerian government before normalcy
can resume," MEND said.
MEND also claimed it attacked a facility operated by Royal Dutch Shell PLC
on July 4. "We lashed out at the Shell
well head 20, located at Cawthorne
Channel 1 today at about [3 a.m.], the
facility connects to the Bonny loading
terminal in Rivers State," the group
said.
A spokesman with Shell in Nigeria
said the firm is investigating reports of
an incident on part of their operations,
but had no immediate comment on the
claims by the rebel group.
The MEND attacks are a clear rejection of recent efforts by the Nigerian
government to secure peace in the Niger Delta. On June 25, President Umaru
Yar'Adua offered amnesty to any rebel
in the Niger Delta who lays down his
arms, beginning on Aug. 6.
The amnesty offer followed bombings by MEND, which were confirmed
by IOC‚Äôs operating in the country.
On June 19, Eni SPA reported a loss
of 33,000 b/d of crude production and
2 million cu m/day of gas due to an attack on its pipeline in the Bayelsa State.

On June 18, Shell confirmed that it
had halted the 100,000 b/d Trans-Ramos
pipeline in Bayelsa State, following an attack carried out by MEND on June 17.
According to analyst BMI, militant
groups such as MEND want a greater
share of oil revenues to filter down into
the region, which remains impoverished despite its hydrocarbon wealth.
‚ÄúWith little indication that the
Nigerian government is successfully

which were based on companies accepting a fixed fee per barrel of oil
instead of an equity stake.
IOCs also raised doubts about having to partner with Iraqi state-owned
firms along with a requirement to share
management of the fields, despite being

required to provide full financing of the
fields‚Äô development.
The tender process initially attracted
offers from 31 IOCs including BP PLC,

ExxonMobil Corp. in addition to a host
of other companies from China, India,

Gazprom, Kogas sign MOU for
Sakhalin-2 pipeline project
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Russia‚Äôs OAO Gazprom and South Korea‚Äôs Korea
Gas Corp. (Kogas) have signed a memorandum of
understanding to study the possibilities of supplying
Russian natural gas to South Korea by extending the
Sakhalin-Khabarovsk-Vladivostok (SKV) gas pipeline.
The agreement with Kogas comes in the wake of
a recent visit to Japan by Russian leaders, including
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and Gazprom Chief
Executive Alexei Miller, aimed at securing Japanese
investment in the same pipeline development.
Gazprom started building the 1,830-km SKV pipeline in May and plans to complete its construction by
yearend 2011. The line‚Äôs initial capacity will be 7 billion cu m (bcm), according to Gazprom Deputy Chief
Executive Alexander Ananenkov, who said it eventually
will be increased to 47 bcm.
Kogas already receives 1.6 million tonnes/year of
LNG from the Sakhalin-2 project following its launch
in April, and under terms of an agreement signed by
Kogas and Gazprom in September 2008, the South
Korean firm will import 10 bcm/year of Russian gas
during 2015-45.
However, Kogas is now said to be seeking to boost its
imports of Russian gas by extending the SKV gas pipeline into South Korea‚Äîa distance of about 150 km.
According to analyst Global Insight, two pipeline
options between Russia and South Korea are currently
being evaluated: an overland route via North Korea
and a direct subsea line.
‚ÄúThe first option suffers from severe geopolitical risks
while the second option presents partners with formidable technological and financial challenges,‚Äù GI said,
adding, ‚ÄúA drawn-out negotiation and planning process
for the project‚Ä¶can be assured in either scenario.‚Äù
Underlining that point, Russian officials also have
been courting Japanese investors into joining the SKV
pipeline project.
Earlier this month, Russia‚Äôs Putin visited Tokyo and
invited Japanese companies to participate in the construction of the line as well as other facilities. ‚ú¶

moving in a rig to drill a deep well in
the Bay St. George basin onshore western Newfoundland.
Vulcan Minerals plans to drill Robinson‚Äôs-1 to 3,600 m in a joint venture
with Investcan Energy Corp.
The site is on Permit 03-106 about
40 km southwest of Stephenville. The
basin‚Äôs deepest well to date is Hurricane-2 to 935 m in 2005.

Pan Orient Energy Corp., Calgary,
said its NSE-I1 well in Thailand discovered commercial hydrocarbons in a
previously untested volcanic reservoir
20 m thick at 637 m true vertical depth. Louisiana
The well is pumping 75 b/d of 34¬∞

Lower Miocene Cris A sands at
21,500 ft measured depth stabilized
at 15.8 MMcfd of gas at 14,873 psi
on an 11‚ÅÑ64-in. choke. Initially, the zone
also produced oil at nonstabilized rates
between 800 b/d and 2,000 b/d.
No other zones were tested, and the
well is shut-in pending installation of
production facilities and flow lines. TD
is 23,300 ft MD, 23,329 ft TVD.
Yuma‚Äôs working interests are 6.25%
before payout and 23.44% after payout
in the well, on Yuma‚Äôs Cote de Mer
prospect.

Nevada
Empire Petroleum Corp., Tulsa, is
preparing to drill a second exploration
well in western Nevada‚Äôs Gabbs Valley.
The company applied for a federal
drilling unit with the Bureau of Land
Management in Reno. Approval is expected by early fall.
The next well is to be drilled to
6,000 ft or a depth sufficient to penetrate 500 ft into the Triassic formation, which the company believes is the
source of the oil shows encountered in
the first well 3‚ÅÑ4 mile away. Geochemical
imaging validates the new location.
Empire Petroleum has a 57% working interest in the well and 85,145
acres of federal leases in the prospect
area and is evaluating options to fund
its share of the drilling cost.

Completion work started on the
Eumont State-2 well in Lea County, the
first development well in Urssey Tank

Ltd., Dallas.
It offsets the KPI Eumont State-1 discovery well, which has produced more
than 60,000 bbl of oil since completion
in May 2008. Eumont State-2 encountered the same subsurface zones of
interest as Eumont State-1, said Saxon
Oil, which has 15% working interest in
the field.

Various forecasters have lowered their
expectation for increases
in bitumen production
from Alberta oil sands,
but most still see a sizProduction
able rise during the next
decade, with bitumen
production of at least 2 million b/d in
2018 compared with 1.3 million b/d
in 2008.
Alberta‚Äôs Energy Resources Conservation Board in its recent update
forecasts bitumen production to reach
2.7 million b/d in 2018.1 This rate is a
decrease from its forecast last year that
saw oil sands production increasing to
3.23 million b/d in 2017.
For determining its current projections, ERCB has lowered its crude price
assumptions and now expects US West
Texas Intermediate to average $55/bbl
in 2009 and increase to $120/bbl in
2018. The lower oil price expectations
are one reason for the lower production
forecasts.

The lower oil price scenario also ties
into the slowdown in world economies
that has lowered future oil demand and
investment expectations.
Another recent forecast from the
Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers estimates oil sands production
under a growth scenario will reach 2.6
million b/d in 2018 and 3.3 million
b/d in 2025. Without growth and with
only projects
currently in
operations and
under construction producing,
CAPP expects
production to
remain relatively
constant at 1.957 million b/d in 2018
and 1.987 million b/d in 2025.
In 2008, the Canadian Energy
Research Institute forecast oil sands
production potential of more than 5
million b/d by 2015 and 6 million b/d
by 2030 and a reference case production of 3.4 million b/d in 2015 and 5
million b/d by
2030. CERI now
SPECIAL
has lowered its
production outlook. In its February 2009 outlook,
Oil Sands Update
the institute now
expects oil sands
production to
range from 1.9 to
2.9 million b/d
in 2015 and from
3.7 to 5.4 million
b/d in 2030.3

Oil sands resources
The main deposits discussed in
ERCB‚Äôs report are the Athabasca
Wabiskaw-McMurray, Cold Lake Clearwater, and Peace River Bluesky-Gething
that cover about 54,000 sq miles (Fig.

oil sands areas in Alberta, Fig. 1 also
indicates that Saskatchewan contains
potential oil sands.

and bitumen upgraded into a synthetic
crude oil.
The report contains the following
assessment of bitumen resources in
Alberta at yearend 2008:1
‚Ä¢ Initial in place‚Äî1,731 billion bbl.
‚Ä¢ Initial established‚Äî177 billion
bbl.
‚Ä¢ Cumulative production‚Äî6.4 billion bbl.
‚Ä¢ Remaining established‚Äî170 billion bbl.
‚Ä¢ 2008 production‚Äî0.477 billion
bbl (1.30 million b/d).
‚Ä¢ Ultimate potential‚Äî315 billion
bbl.
The in situ volumes include production with enhanced recovery methods,
such as injection of steam, water, or
other solvents into the reservoir to mobilize the bitumen, as well as bitumen
and heavy oil produced with primary
methods from the Athabasca, Peace
River, and Cold Lake regions.
ERCB currently is working on an update of the Upper and Lower Cold Lake
Grand Rapids deposits and Athabasca
Grosmont deposits. It expects to complete the assessment in 2009.
From its previous work, it reduced in
the 2008 report the initial established
reserves in Peace River to 5.5 billion
bbl, based on a 20% recovery factor for
thermal processes. But in the report,
it also increased the area suitable for
mining in the Athabasca region by 141‚ÅÑ2
townships, based on drilling in that area
(Fig. 5). This change increased initial
minable recoverable reserves to 38.7
billion bbl, up from 35.2 billion bbl in
last year‚Äôs report.
These two changes reduced the ERCB
initial established reserves estimate by
1.9 billion bbl from that shown in the
previous year‚Äôs report.
Of the 170 billion bbl remaining
established reserves, ERCB considers
80%, or 135 billion bbl recoverable
with in situ methods and the remaining
34 billion bbl recoverable with surface
mining methods.
The currently active mining developments contain 23.5 billion bbl and active in situ areas contain 3.5 billion bbl

346,000 bbl in 2008. SCO from the
production started in February 2009.
Table 2 shows the projects ERCB
includes in its production forecast for
minable projects. It excluded from the
list the proposed UTS Energy Corp.
Equinox and Frontier projects that, if
implemented, would start up in the
later part of its forecast.
ERCB forecast that production from
mined project would increase to 1.56
million b/d in 2018 from the 0.72 million b/d in 2008.
Fig. 4 shows the historic in situ
production from each of the three areas.
ERCB expects production from in situ
projects to increase to 1.39 million b/d
in 2018 compared with 0.58 million
b/d in 2008. Its 2018 production projection is 5% less than in its previous
year‚Äôs report.
Companies have drilled most in
situ producing wells in the oil sands as
deviated wells from pads to minimize
the drilling and production footprint.
From 1985 through yearend 2008, the
oil sands have had 38,913 wells drilled
for exploration and development of the
resource. In 2008, companies drilled
4,627 wells in the oil sands. Of these,
1,209 were development wells and
3,428 were exploratory wells. According to the ERCB report, about 9,700
wells were on production during 2008,
with the average well producing 62
bo/d.
Production from the Cold Lake
region accounts for 53% of the in situ
production, with another 40 % produced in the Athabasca region and 7%
in the Peace River region, the report
says.
As with the mining projects, the
timetable for additional in situ projects
is uncertain.
CERI in its February 2009 forecast
dramatically decreased its estimates
of future capital investment in the oil
sands (Fig. 6). In its economic slowdown projection, it expects companies
to invest $218 billion (Can.) in new
oil sands. This is $97 billion (Can.) less
than its 2008 base case and $241 bil-

Cost reductions may rekindle some oil sands investment
John Dunn
Wood Mackenzie Ltd.
Houston
Cost deflation alone
will not provide the
necessary catalyst for
Production
companies to begin to
sanction more oil sands
projects. Based on a Wood Mackenzie
analysis, we expect companies to stay in
a low-cost safe mode until clear signs of
an improvement in energy markets or
the economic environment emerge.
Hit hard by industry cost inflation,
Canada‚Äôs oil sands projects now have
some of the highest break-even prices
of upstream assets globally.
As a result, many operators
have opted to delay, defer,
or redefine their oil sands
portfolios in order to effectively manage and control
project costs, time scales, and
potential returns through the
economic downturn.
The question on everyone‚Äôs lips now is when, and
to what extent, will cost
deflation filter through the
sector.
With steel and labor accounting for more than 50% of a typical oil sands project‚Äôs total cost, it seems
inevitable that the collapse in the value
of steel and a depressed labor demand

There are initial signs that project
costs now are lower, but it is too early
to tell if these reductions will be across
the board.

Project status
An array of large and small companies has suspended or reduced activity
levels on their oil sands projects amid
the toxic combination of low commodity prices and high costs. As a result,
these companies have avoided constructing multibillion-dollar projects
at the height of global cost inflation,
instead conducting the long and pains-

taking process of renegotiating existing
contracts and redefining project scopes.
The list of projects that companies
have scaled-back, delayed, or redefined
includes both future phases of some
of the region‚Äôs established projects and
new greenfield developments.
In addition to deferring decisions on

development sanction, such as PetroCanada at its McKay River and Fort Hills
projects or Total E&P Canada Ltd. at its
Joslyn development, some companies
have withdrawn applications or postponed plans for upgraders in Alberta,
including StatoilHydro at Kai Kos Dehseh and Total at Northern Lights.
Other operators have chosen to redefine project scopes and to place projects
into a safe mode, such as Suncor Energy
Inc. at its Voyageur project and Shell
Canada Ltd. with the second expansion
of its Alberta oil sands project (AOSP).
The slowdown also has affected the
region‚Äôs smaller operators, such as Connacher Oil and Gas Ltd. The company
had deferred its second phase
at Great Divide, named Algar,
and temporarily constrained
bitumen production in late
2008. The company, however,
has reinstated production
levels in light of narrowing
bitumen differentials and
restarted Algar construction.
Needless to say, new projects in undeveloped areas are
unlikely in the short term,
especially those championed
by smaller companies, as
they grapple with tight credit
and debt markets.
One exception is the proposed
300,000-b/d Imperial Oil Ltd.-operated Kearl mining project. Although
not materially redefining the project‚Äôs
scope or timing, the operator has taken
time to work with its suppliers to drive
down costs and also has delayed order-

leave projects before first production,
in order to secure a more lucrative contract at another project. This will avoid
some reliability and start-up issues that
have plagued projects.

Project economics
To assess the effect of regional cost
deflation on oil sands‚Äô project economics, our analysis considers the breakeven points of future mining and SAGD
projects. The projects included are
future green field projects and future
phases of existing projects except for
three integrated legacy projects because
of their economies of scale, long-term
production experience, and infrastructure positions. These three projects are
unrepresentative of the newer projects.
It also is worth noting that new
integrated projects, without any existing production, generally display
higher break-even economics than their
nonintegrated counterparts. In light of
recent project deferrals, however, there
are no integrated projects in our data
set that have an existing phase already
in production.
We have analyzed the projects under
two discount rates: 12% and 15%.
It could be argued that such a longlived and known resource be assessed
with a discount rate of 10%, or below,
especially when compared with, for
example, a high-risk ultradeepwater

development and its rapid production
rate decline. We, however, see 15% as a
more sensible planning assumption in
the current environment, due to tight
credit and debt markets.
In actuality, participants display
varying appetites for risk as a result of
different costs of capital and internal
strategies. The drivers for selecting an
appropriate discount rate are also the
subject of much debate.
Without factoring in any regional
cost deflation, we estimate that the average mining project break-even point is
about $90/bbl and $70/bbl (West Texas
Intermediate) at 15% and 12%, respectively (Fig. 1). The average SAGD project
requires a $65/bbl and $55/bbl at the
same discount rates.
A discount rate of 15%, in conjunction with a 25% and 50% decrease in
total project capital expenditure results
accordingly in average break-even
points of about $55/bbl and $45/bbl
for SAGD projects and about $70/bbl
and $55/bbl for mining projects.
In essence, under our average SAGD
results, a project is economic at less
than $50/bbl WTI at a discount rate of
15%, with a 50% decrease in capital
costs. Under the same metrics, a mining
project would require more than a 50%
decrease in costs to be economically
viable at less than $50/bbl.
Another way to interpret our results

is that to reduce the average breakeven of our projects to $55/bbl or less,
would require a cost reduction of 25%
for a SAGD project but 50% for a mining project.
Long-term narrow bitumen differentials could offer much upside to
our average break-even estimates for
nonintegrated projects.
Our current long-term assumption is
that bitumen trades at a 50% discount
to WTI, which is about the historical
average. Bitumen differentials, however,
currently are narrow and hence some
standalone projects could produce more
favorable economics under a narrower
assumption.
On the contrary, wide bitumen
differentials favor integrated developments‚Äîa high quality product is
generated from a low quality input‚Äîso
that the inverse relationship holds true.
Therefore, taking a short-term view
on bitumen differentials for a longlife resource when making investment
decisions introduces an added element
of risk because bitumen differentials
depend on the volume of nonupgraded
bitumen sold to the market in the forthcoming years and its ability to displace
extra heavy oil from Mexico and Venezuela delivered to the Gulf Coast region,
which remains largely uncertain.

Future scenarios
To evaluate the potential impact of
the prevailing oil price and industry
cost deflation on the region‚Äôs bitumen
production forecast, we have considered
our base unrisked profile and assumed
that production does not go ahead if
project or future phase break-evens
equal or fall below several defined WTI
price thresholds. We evaluated our production with and without a total capex
reduction of 50%, at our preferred discount rate of 15%. It is assumed that all
production currently on stream ramps
up as per company plans (Fig. 2).
At a prevailing $60/bbl or less WTI
price, under our base-cost assumptions, about 1 million b/d of future
production could be at threat in 2020.
If, however, there is a 50% reduction
in total capex, under threat in the same
year is less than 500,000 b/d of bitumen production.
Additionally, under our reduced cost
scenario, companies would not constrain any production that we currently
model if its break-even WTI price is
$80/bbl or more. In reality, companies
will delay production that is uneconomic under the prevailing cost and
commodity price until costs decrease or
oil prices increase.

were added to the models. Up to this
time, a mixture of design conditions
and ultimate feed characteristics were
used in order to observe which parameters could be changed to increase CO2
slip drastically. No previous results were
conclusive because, for example, many
of the simulators used were off by a
couple orders of magnitude in their
predictions of CO2 slip.
‚Ä¢ Simulator No. 2 is an aminespecific simulator, with features allowing the use of mixed amines and for
modeling of column internals including
trayed and packed columns. It offered
very good convergence characteristics.
While actual trays could be modeled,
the process vendor suggested using
ideal stages with actual column and tray
dimensions.
‚Ä¢ Simulator No. 3 is a commonly
used simulator specifically designed
for amine systems. It allows for mixed
amines and modeling of column and
tray dimensions. This simulator offered
the ability to model some of the heatstable salts in solution. Convergence
ability was slightly poorer than Simulator No. 2 but was very effective after
gaining experience with some operating anomalies.
‚Ä¢ Simulator No. 4 is a general purpose process simulator that many use
for modeling amine systems and was
used in the original design of Simonette. It offers some limited blendedamine capability and physical parameter
manipulation.

‚Ä¢ Simulator No. 5 has recently appeared on the market and offers modeling of blended amine and physical
column and tray dimensions.
To reiterate: Simulator No. 1 was not
used in the comparison table because it
had limited capability in modeling the
total Simonette amine system.
While an attempt was made to make
an accurate comparison between simulation programs, it was found that common molecular components could not
be specified. (Table 6 shows the results of
INEOS amine analysis performed on the
dates shown, showing some of the heatstable salts prevalent in the solution.)
Simulator No. 3, for example, allowed
many of the heat-stable salts to be input,
whereas the others did not include these
in the component selection. As such, a
complete comparison across the board
showing the effects of heat-stable salts
could not be made but was included as a
comparison case by itself to demonstrate
how these components may directionally
affect the system‚Äôs behavior.
Simulator No. 4 did not allow the
addition of sulfates, modeled as a small
amount of sulfuric acid in the other
simulator cases.
Not all simulators allowed the
modeling of actual trays. Simulator No.
2 showed the most accurate values in
relation to actual measured plant data
but modeled with theoretical stages,
that combined with actual column tray
dimensional data (weir heights, column
diameters, weir lengths/active areas,

etc.), as recommended by the process
vendor to provide the most accurate
results.

Simulated CO2 slip
Simulator No. 3 was adjusted to
achieve an acid-gas loading similar to
the other cases. Driving the reboiler
harder to attain 0.005 acid-gas loading, however, produced much higher
reboiler duties than the existing equipment was capable of. Notably, the results
indicated less duty was required when
balancing the acid-gas component in
the sweetened gas, which was brought
down to considerably low levels.
All cases except for Simulator No.
2 showed the amount of CO2 slip to
be roughly in the range of 25-65%,
inconsistent with field results indicating
0.05-0.1%. Discussions with industry
spokesmen revealed no reasonable explanation for why the simulation results
varied with respect to actual CO2 slip vs.
modeled results.
As one amine technical expert put
it, by virtue of the specified selective
amine used, C-520 would have required
50 trays to account for the experienced
CO2 pickup. One amine supplier also
speculated that there was no accountable reason why at least 30% slip could
be achieved. ‚ú¶

The World Onshore Pipelines Report

This new report examines the current and future prospects, technologies and markets for the LiqueÔ¨Åed Natural Gas sector. Gas currently accounts for nearly a quarter of all energy consumption, and the IEA have forecast
that gas demand will grow at a faster rate than oil over
the Ô¨Årst quarter of this century. With many regions
facing future gas shortages, LNG offers an increasingly
important method of bringing gas from remote reserves
to the market.
DW1

This report presents a comprehensive view of the historic market from 2003-2007 and forecast period from
2009-2013. The report also reviews all aspects of onshore oil & gas pipelines from design, materials, techniques and components through to construction, operations and maintenance and transportation. Geared to the
needs of the senior executive and assumes no previous
reader knowledge of the subject area.

From the Subscribers Only area of

In need of money,
the US government
takes aim at LIFO
Beware the government asserting principle
but needing money.
The Obama administration asserted principles of sorts when it proposed in its budget
for Ô¨Åscal 2010 to eliminate last-in, Ô¨Årst-out
(LIFO) inventory accounting.
In its explanation of the proposal, the Treasury Department called LIFO ‚Äúa tax deferral
opportunity‚Äù and ‚Äúa complex and burdensome accounting method.‚Äù It also called LIFO

T h e
E d i t o r ‚Äô s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

an impediment to US implementation of
International Financial Reporting Standards,
which prohibit LIFO accounting.
Then there‚Äôs the money: $61 billion to federal coffers from businesses during 2010-19 as
a result of LIFO repeal, according to administration estimates.
Many oil and gas companies use LIFO. Like
LIFO companies in other industries, they‚Äôd
face jumps in current and possibly future tax
liabilities if the method, in use since the 1930s,
were repealed.
A group called the LIFO Coalition has been
Ô¨Åghting repeal initiatives since 2006. Managed
by the National Association of WholesalerDistributors (NAW), the coalition represents
nearly 100 trade associations, other business
groups, and corporations.
On June 30, NAW reported on visits by coalition representatives to key members of the
Senate Finance and House Ways and Means
Committees. In Congress, the issue has little to
do with LIFO‚Äôs supposed conceptual Ô¨Çaws.
‚ÄúThis is all about money, not LIFO,‚Äù NAW
told its members. Lawmakers ‚Äúdo not argue
that LIFO should be repealed on its merits but
only that they need more of your tax dollars.‚Äù
While acknowledging LIFO as an appropriate accounting method, lawmakers nevertheless ‚Äúwere not responsive that LIFO should
not be repealed absent an objection to it on
the merits,‚Äù NAW said.
The group added that lawmakers seemed
interested only in ‚Äúquantitative information‚Äù
about the effects of repeal on speciÔ¨Åc businesses.
One other point in the NAW report should
worry oil and gas companies: Among potential compromises suggested by the lawmakers
was LIFO repeal for speciÔ¨Åc industries.
In the current political climate, oil and gas
would not escape such targeted tax mistreatment.
NAW said business participants in the
meetings rejected industry-speciÔ¨Åc LIFO
repeal and other proposed compromises,
including repeal limited to publicly held or
large companies and repeal with no retrospective effect.

Unauthorized trades push price peaks
Front-month crude contracts jumped June 30 to ‚Äúfake‚Äù intraday highs of $73.38/
bbl on the New York Mercantile Exchange‚Äîthe highest this year‚Äîand $73.50/bbl on
the International Petroleum Exchange through unauthorized trades by an employee
at a subsidiary of PVM Oil Associates Ltd., London. PVM subsequently announced a
loss of almost $10 million.
The August contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes traded through a
$4.48/bbl high-low price difference June 30 before closing at $69.89/bbl, down $1.60
for the day on NYMEX. In London, the August IPE contract for North Sea Brent crude
retreated $1.69 to $69.30/bbl that same day. Prices continued to drop during the next
two sessions with the NYMEX and ICE contracts closing at $66.73/bbl and $66.65/bbl,
respectively, on July 2.
‚ÄúAfter the PVM high, it was a downhill race,‚Äù said Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix,
Zug, Switzerland, with the NYMEX crude contract losing $3.53/bbl during the week
and closing $7.75/bbl lower than the June 30 high. ‚ÄúBrent lost $3.31/bbl during the
week,‚Äù said Jacob. Prices were still falling in early trading July 6, as the New York
market resumed business after the 3-day US Independence Day holiday, July 3-5. In
Houston, analysts at Raymond James & Associates Inc. said, ‚ÄúCrude oil is trading
around a 5-week low as the US dollar strengthened and concerns of a prolonged
global economic slowdown continue to impact sentiment.‚Äù
At KBC Market Services, a division of KBC Process Technology Ltd. in Surrey, UK,
analysts asked, ‚Äú‚ÄúHow can a trader enter into futures contracts representing 18 million bbl of oil at a time of day‚Äîearly morning‚Äîwhen normally only 500,000 bbl are
traded, without anybody thinking something was strange? Where were the ICE monitors and the Financial Services [Authority that regulates most aspects of UK Ô¨Ånancial
dealing]?‚Äù Concerning the usefulness of those market regulators, KBC analysts said,
‚ÄúTheir resemblance to a chocolate teapot is striking.‚Äù
‚ÄòA massive weapon‚Äô
On the other hand, with yet another rogue trader involved in unauthorized speculation that drove up crude prices on the futures markets, KBC analysts said, ‚ÄúA massive weapon has been handed to supporters of tighter regulation of futures markets,
not just affecting oil but for other commodities, which are literally the raw material
of economic prosperity.‚Äù They warned, ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt heard the end of this.‚Äù
Jakob said, ‚ÄúThe PVM trades had a relatively small impact by themselves but a
greater subsequent impact on the chart formations. It is counterintuitive, but the
net impact of the PVM fat Ô¨Ångers had a net negative impact (buying to a recent
high, then selling and letting the world know the buying was fake) on the technical
picture.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúTechnically, West Texas Intermediate took a beating‚Äù in the short
trading week of June 29-July 2.
KBC analysts said, ‚ÄúWith economic news still gloomy, oil demand sluggish, stocks
plentiful, and no supply-side disruption in sight, we could be on the verge of a short
term downward price correction.‚Äù They said, ‚ÄúThere is a growing perception that
although recovery will come, it will not be tomorrow.‚Äù
Bullish traders need a support level of $66/bbl ‚Äúto keep some control of the game
Jakob said, but WTI dropped through that price level in ‚Äúthin electronic trades‚Äù on
July 3. He said, ‚ÄúWTI is now below the lower Bollinger [a band plotted two standard
deviations away from a simple moving average], which could bring some support;
but if another set of lower highs and lower lows are printed, it will need to look for
the 50-day moving average as the next level of support around $63.70/bbl.‚Äù
He said July 6, ‚ÄúIf $66/bbl can be [maintained] early in the week on the back of the
new pipeline bombings in Nigeria, WTI will still face some strong resistance between
$70-73/bbl. Hence on any early recovery, we would not expect very much apart from
a consolidating range between $66-70/bbl. Last year the peaks were reached in the
Ô¨Årst half of July, and this might prompt some expectations that a similar seasonal
pattern is occurring this year.‚Äù
Meanwhile, in Nigeria a presidential offer of amnesty had encouraged some
hope that passions might cool in the Niger Delta. But attacks on oil installations
by hardcore militants ‚Äúhave continued rather than stopped,‚Äù said Jakob. ‚ÄúOver the
weekend [July 4-5] a Royal Dutch Shell PLC installation in the Eastern Delta (Bonny)
was attacked and overnight a Chevron Corp. installation as well. The production
levels in Nigeria are falling to multiyear lows and getting closer to the day when only
[offshore Ô¨Çoating production, storage, and ofÔ¨Çoading vessels] FPSOs are left running,‚Äù he said.

Expanding Sustainably
Growth requires the oil sands and heavy oil industry to make steady, long-term progress along a narrow
road for which no map exists.
On one side loom the high costs of extracting, processing, and transporting unconventional hydrocarbons.
On the other side are environmental performance standards that toughen with time and that the industry
never must fail to meet.
Each step along this road requires innovation. Each must withstand unpredictable economic changes.
Each must uphold eternal values of nature and society.
On this road, the beacon for progress is technology, advances in which will control the costs, improve the
environmental performance, and assure the sustainability of an industry crucial to oil supplies ‚Äì now and
in the future.
The Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition is the premier showcase for the
knowledge and methods of this fascinating business.

Interest

APPEA: Australia underweight in share of LNG
Australia has been called “underweight” in its share of the LNG
supply market, given the size of the country’s gas resources, according to the Edinburgh-based UK consultants Wood Mackenzie
Ltd.
Speaking at Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association’s annual conference in Perth, Ben Hollins, WoodMac’s
head of European gas and power, said the pace of development of
new LNG projects in Australia has been too slow because it is hindered by rising costs, disunity among joint venture partners, and
obstacles to environmental approvals.
For example, Hollins pointed out that a jump in construction
costs has delayed the Chevron Corp.-led Gorgon project.
Currently Australia has just two producing projects having a
combined capacity of 15.2 million tonnes/year, and yet APPEA has
set a target of up to 60 million tonnes/year of LNG production by
2017.
Hollins said that target looks increasingly unlikely to be met.
WoodMac estimates Pacific Basin demand for LNG could jump
83% to 203 million tonnes by 2020, which is up from 111 million tonnes produced this year.
Hollins said there are at least 12 rival projects being proposed
in Australia, and LNG buyers in Asia are frustrated at the slow rate
of development. The buyers are also confused as to which projects
might succeed.
“This creates a headache for them,” he said “and that’s not good
for Australian interests either.”
Chevron’s Wheatstone Project and Shell’s radical floating LNG
proposal for Prelude field in the Browse basin are recent examples
of the scramble by gas owners to get their projects to the starting
line to take advantage of the forecast boom in global demand for
LNG.
Hollins believes the Australian government needs to play a part
in ensuring that developments do proceed.

Seven arrested in rocket attacks in Sanaa, Yemen
The Al Qaeda terrorist organization, building on earlier claims,
has taken responsibility for a rocket attack on a residential complex
in Yemen that houses executives and the headquarters of Safer E&P
Operations Co.
“Al Qaeda has issued a statement claiming the attack,” said a
Yemeni security official. Residents reported no injuries after three
rockets struck near the residences of US employees of the Yemenowned Safer Oil Co.
The official said police had arrested seven people in connection
with the attack, adding that three people had fired the rockets from
a car on the edge of the complex of villas in the al Hadda district in

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

southwestern Sanaa, the Yemeni capital.
The attack occurred 2 days after the arrest in Sanaa of Al Qaeda
operative, Abdullah al Rimi, who was sought by the US Federal
Bureau of Investigation. Al Rimi has been identified as taking part
in attacks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in 2003 and on the USS Cole in
2000 in the Yemeni port of Aden, which killed 17 US sailors and
injured many others.
Suspected Al Qaeda militants have claimed several attacks in Yemen, the ancestral homeland of the terror network’s chief Osama
bin Laden.
Recently, the Jund al Yemen Brigades, an Al Qaeda affiliate
group, claimed responsibility for two operations carried out in
Hadhramaut, including a Mar. 27 bomb attack on a pipeline belonging to Total SA in the Sah Valley and a Mar. 29 mortar attack on
an unidentified Chinese oil company operating in Al-Khish’a.
Since the attacks on the USS Cole in 2000, several other foreign
interests, specifically oil interests, have been attacked, according to
the Yemen report by the US Energy Information Administration.
These include:
• The suicide bombing of the Limburg French oil tanker off the
coast of Yemen, killing one and causing a massive fire and leakage
of 150,000 bbl of oil into the Gulf of Aden (OGJ Online, Oct. 11,
2002).
• An unsuccessful firing of a surface-to-air missile at an oil
company helicopter in 2002.
• The 2006 foiled suicide bomb attempt against two oil facilities.
• The more-recent attacks on oil company personnel near the
border between the Marib and Shabwa governorates.

Colombia shortlists 20 ﬁrms for heavy oil projects
Colombia’s National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH) has invited
20 companies to submit formal proposals in May to develop eight
greenfield heavy-oil blocks in the East Llanos basin, the head of the
agency told OGJ.
Companies that made the shortlist include ExxonMobil Corp.,
Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Nexen Inc., and OAO Lukoil. In an exclusive
interview, Armando Zamora, director general, said ANH hopes to
sign technical evaluation agreements with the winners by July.
“We have invited those with the financial muscle and expertise to do the work,” Zamora said. “We want companies that can
engage in high risk exploration.” The successful companies will
have a large area in which to gather data and drill stratigraphic
wells, he added. They will then choose a limited area within the
technical evaluation agreement (TEA) area. “We will sign a limited number of exploration contracts, depending on the size of the
area,” Zamora said. “The rest of the block will be open to outside
competition.”

BP makes oil discovery on Kodiak prospect in gulf
BP Exploration & Production Inc. has made an oil find at its Kodiak prospect on Mississippi Canyon Block 771 in the deepwater
Gulf of Mexico about 60 miles southeast of Louisiana.
The Kodiak discovery well was drilled to a total depth of 31,150
ft in 5,000 ft of water. BP reported the well hit 500 net ft of hydrocarbon-bearing sands in Middle and Lower Miocene reservoirs.
The well was drilled using Transocean’s Deepwater Horizon semisubmersible drilling rig.
The well was deviated with a horizontal step-out of 7,400 ft.
BP said further appraisal is needed to determine the size and commerciality of the find.
The Kodiak discovery well lies in the vicinity of BP’s 2003 Tubular Bells discovery, the company said. The lease was acquired at
federal OCS Lease Sale 182 in March 2002.
BP operates the well with a 63.75% stake. Its partners are Eni
SPA 25% and Marubeni Oil & Gas (USA) Inc. 11.25%.

ft of water about 1.9 miles from Julimar-1, which logged 132 ft
of net pay and test-flowed a combined 85 MMcfd of gas from two
zones.
“Julimar Southeast-1 encountered both the stratigraphically
oldest and structurally deepest gas pay in the field to date,” said G.
Steven Farris, Apache president and chief executive officer. “Two
additional wells are planned on the block in 2008, and we believe
the ultimate size of this gas accumulation could be in the range of
2-4 tcf,” he said.
Apache owns a 65% interest in the block, with Kuwait Foreign
Petroleum Exploration Co. holding the remainder.
Apache said the Halyard-1 discovery test-flowed at a peak rate
of 68 MMcfd of gas and 936 b/d of condensate from 91 ft of net
gas pay in the Cretaceous Halyard sandstone.
The Halyard-1 was drilled in 366 ft of water in Permit WA13-L, the same production license as Apache-operated East Spar
field. Apache owns 55% interest in the block; Santos Ltd. owns the
remaining interest. The discovery is on a trend with Apache-operated John Brookes field, which is producing 240 MMcfd of gas
from three wells.
That test was on 54 ft of perforations in two intervals beginning
at a measured depth of 8,525 ft. It was constrained by the capacity
of surface equipment.
“Halyard-1 is our first test of a series of recently identified
stratigraphic traps along the front edge of the Barrow Delta,” Farris
said. “The production test confirms the presence of high-quality
reservoir sandstones and their capacity to deliver gas at commercial
rates. Apache has identified several other undrilled geologic features with similar geophysical characteristics in the same area.”
The company said production from Halyard could be brought
to Western Australia’s gas market via an existing Apache-operated
pipeline 10 miles south of the discovery and through the Varanus
Island processing and transportation hub. This proximity to existing transportation facilities is likely to reduce the time and expense
required to develop the project.

Husky Energy Inc. has received approval for subsea development of North Amethyst oil field, the first of three White Rose field
satellites planned for development off Newfoundland (OGJ, Feb.
25, 2008, p. 37).
After completing agreements on royalties and benefits with federal and provincial governments, Husky let a €190 million contract
to Technip for engineering, fabrication, and installation of 23.7 km
of flexible flowlines and 5.4 km of umbilicals plus installation of
manifolds and associated pipework.
Technip’s Deep Pioneer and Wellservicer vessels will install the
equipment in 2009.
Husky expects to drill 11 North Amethyst wells for tie-back
to the SeaRose floating production, storage, and offloading vessel
moored in 120 m of water in White Rose field. Base-case production estimate for the satellite is 62,900-75,500 b/d.
Last year Husky said White Rose, in the Jeanne d’Arc basin

it has 1,200 risk-adjusted potential drilling locations based on
80-acre spacing. Wells will be drilled from new and existing pads,

Pioneer plans to assess the potential upside from horizontal
drilling, which is under way, and the potential to produce from the
shallowest two shale intervals.
The company expects to average $1 million/well plus $200,000
per frac interval for an average finding and development cost of
$10-15/boe and to average a before-tax internal return rate of
40% at $8/Mcf.
“Pierre shale activity is expected to accelerate in 2009, supporting a compounded average annual production growth rate from

Shell mulls $2.1 billion ﬂoating LNG project
Shell Australia is considering a $2.1 billion (Aus.) floating LNG
facility at its Prelude gas field in the Browse basin off Western Australia.
The company believes the time has come for development of
relatively small gas fields—those having reserves of less than 5 tcf
of gas—using the radical floating facility approach as opposed to
the conventional fixed platform with pipeline to shore.
For the Prelude discovery, which lies about 450 km north of
Broome on the Kimberley coast of Western Australia, a pipeline to
shore could cost more than $3 billion.
The Shell find, made last year in the permit adjacent to Inpex’s
Ichthys field, was once thought to be an extension of the Ichthys
structure.
Speaking Apr. 7 at the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association Conference in Perth, Royal Dutch Shell PLC’s
Linda Cook, executive director of gas and power, denied that allegation, saying Prelude is a separate structure with a reserve of
about 2-3 tcf. This is the type of project that would suit a floating
LNG development.
Such a project would avoid the environmental sensitivities of
bringing gas ashore on the pristine Kimberley coast where competing projects have prompted the Western Australian and federal
governments to research a single gas production hub to reduce the
environmental impact on the region.
Cook said it was still early in the proposal’s evaluation, but Shell
believes the floating LNG technology has potential in both Australia
and Asia.
Shell has lodged an environmental review application with the
Australian government for the Prelude project, which it says could
be in production by 2012.
The company says it expects to issue a tender for the building of
the first of its floating LNG vessels in the third quarter.

Sempra to send more Costa Azul LNG gas to US
Sempra Energy, San Diego, has completed expansion of its
140-mile Baja North pipeline, enabling it to carry natural gas from
its Energia Costa Azul LNG regasification terminal in Baja California, Mexico, to additional markets across the US border in California and Arizona.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

The expansion is expected to be in operation later in the second
quarter, Liparidis said.
Sempra Pipeline & Storage Chief Executive Officer George
Liparidis, speaking at an analysts’ conference, said the $250
million expansion included a 45-mile, 42-in. spur along with
compression upgrades and looping along the existing 30-in.
mainline.
Gasoducto Bajanorte SRL operates the pipeline, which originates at an interconnection with North Baja Pipeline LLC west of
Algodones and continues west through the cities of Mexicali and
Tecate, Mexico.
The existing mainline, which has a capacity of 500 MMcfd of
gas, serves new and existing power plants and industrial customers
in northern Baja California and Southern California.
Liparidis said Sempra soon will have access to another extension
as well—the Yuma lateral—to transport gas from the terminal to
gas-fired power plants operated by major Arizona utilities in the
Yuma, Ariz., area.
Construction on the lateral is under way, and completion is expected in early 2009.

Chinese-built LNG carrier for NWS delivered
The North West Shelf Joint Venture partners have taken delivery
of the first of three Chinese-built LNG carriers that will transport
LNG from the Burrup Peninsula plant to Dapeng receiving terminal
in Guandong Province, China.
The Dapeng Sun carrier was delivered at Hudong-Zhonghua
shipyard in Shnaghai by Yue Peng LNG Shipping.
The second vessel, Dapeng Moon, will be completed during
the third quarter. Each of the JV companies has 5% equity in Yue
Peng LNG.
The NWS group’s 25-year supply deal with the Guangdong
consortium buyer was signed in 2002 for 3.3 million tonnes/year
of LNG to Dapeng on a fob basis, and the agreement became effective in December 2004.
Separately, in another NWS project, Woodside Petroleum Ltd.
awarded a $200 million (Aus.) contract to a JV of Australian engineering group Clough Ltd., Perth, and Interbeton, the Netherlands,
to construct the LNG jetty for the Pluto LNG project on the Burrup
Peninsula.
The 300 m-long jetty will be completed by yearend 2009. ✦

A disquieting look
A look at what’s happening to world
crude oil production is disquieting. For
example:
• The only country in the world
with additional producing capacity is
Saudi Arabia. However, the capacity of
that country to increase its oil production meaningfully and to sustain it over
the longer term must be viewed in the
context of what appears to be faltering
production in its aging “crown jewels,”
including Ghawar, Abqaiq, and Safaniya
that were discovered over 50 years ago.
• Domestic petroleum consumption in Iran is increasing as its crude oil
production begins to falter.
• Given oil project lead times and the
present turmoil, prospects for significantly increasing production in Iraq over
prewar levels are poor. Iraq’s giant oil
fields, Kirkuk and Rumalia, are 80 and
50 years old respectively and are showing their age.
• North Sea and Norwegian offshore
production is declining.
• Oil production in Mexico, an important US supplier, is declining alarmingly—down 174,000 b/d or 5.3% in
2007.
• Political unrest in Venezuela and Nigeria does not bode well for dependable,
stable oil supplies from those regions.
• It’s becoming increasingly rare that
a major new oil field is discovered.
• Oil producers continue to do what
they can to stem the decline of existing
fields, estimated at 4.5%/year by Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
Meanwhile, world crude oil demand
continues to rise. Clearly, the era of
cheap oil is over, and this will moderate
the growth in demand. Still, the assessment of John B. Hess, chairman and
chief executive of Hess Corp., appears
spot on. “Given the long lead times of
at least 5-10 years from discovery to
production, an oil crisis is coming and
sooner than most people think. Unfortunately, we are behaving in ways that we
do not know there is a serious problem
(OGJ, Feb. 25, 2008, p. 27).”
Even in the unlikely event that Mr.
Hess is dead wrong and there turns
out to be oil aplenty (albeit costly) for

years to come, there is still no reason
to squander a resource that is finite and
depleting. The US as the world’s profligate energy consumer should take the
lead in energy conservation and efficient
energy utilization, in developing alternative energy sources, and in showing
others how to do it. Therein lie immense
market opportunities.

Seismic in reserves reporting
Alan Petzet
Chief EditorExploration
Industry comments on US federal
reserves reporting rules indicate that oil
and gas companies believe seismic data
could play important roles.
The Securities and Exchange Commission asked for comments about
modernizing its 1978 reserves reporting rules, and some in the industry
believe the commission plans to update
the procedures.
In the 30 years since the SEC established its rules, the industry has made
dramatic advances in seismic surveying
and imaging, many of which have been
chronicled in this magazine.
Indeed, 3D seismic surveying technology, invented by ExxonMobil Corp.
predecessor Humble Oil & Refining
Co. in 1963, was hardly available to
the wider industry by the time the SEC
placed its existing rules in effect in
1978.
The extent to which companies
believe seismic information could
improve reserves reporting is evident in
comments filed with the SEC. The comments reflect many other changes companies believe the commission should
make, and full comments are posted on
the SEC web site.
The existing SEC rules allow public companies to report only proved
reserves and then under relatively
narrow definitions of what constitutes
“proved.”

Seismic contributions
Confining disclosure to proved
reserves, narrowly defined, serves SEC’s
goal of reducing the chance that inves-

tors will be misled. But some companies favor the reporting of probable
reserves as providing a more complete
view of a company’s holdings.
The comments indicate that some
companies don’t feel that the SEC rules
are flexible enough to allow them to
give an accurate picture of the variances between conventional oil and gas
reserves, enhanced oil recovery project
reserves, unconventional gas accumulations, and oil sands reserves.
Devon Energy Corp. commented:
“Reserves should be determined using
proven, modern technology that is in
general use in the petroleum extractive industries. Permitted technologies
should include 3D seismic for structural
interpretation as well as reservoir limits,
where definitive; history-matched reservoir simulation to calculate original
hydrocarbons-in-place and recoveries; use of modern pressure gauges in
wireline formation testers; and other
methods when proven to be reliable
through repeated application.
“Any such technology should be
proven through actual field and reservoir performance before reserves associated with such technology would be
allowed in financial reports.”
BP PLC said, “If pressure-and-fluid
and seismic data that have been shown
to be good indicators of contact depth
in appropriate analogs are available, and
the evaluator can demonstrate reasonable certainty of their estimate, then
that information should be used.”

Other seismic potential
Some companies commented on the
uses of seismic in unconventional gas
reservoirs.
Ultra Petroleum Corp. said: “The
current staff interpretation that (proved
undeveloped) locations must be immediately adjacent to producing units
and their interpretation that certainty

means absolute certainty for utilization
of newer technologies such as 3D seismic for PUD locations more than one
offset away is outdated and not consistent with how companies make drilling
decisions.
“For our major asset (Pinedale field,
Wyo.) we have used our 3D interpretation for the past 7 years drilling a
mixture of PUD, probable, possible, and
even unengineered locations with 100%
success in obtaining commercial wells.
In addition, the current interpretation is
very difficult to apply to this same field,
which has four different well drilling
densities with areas approved for 40,
20, 10, and 5 acre development.”
Ultra asked, “If PUD locations are
booked as direct offsets to a 40 acre
drilled producing well and the area is
down-spaced to 10 acres drilling, do we
lose PUD locations? Has the certainty
been decreased for the other three locations in the booked 40 acre area?”
Southwestern Energy Co. said its
experience in the Fayetteville shale
indicates that microseismic data from
multistage hydraulic fracs can help
demonstrate the productivity along the
length of a horizontal lateral as long as
the data show a consistent pattern that
the stimulations treated the entire lateral
length.

The next steps
The SEC at some point will file a proposal for new rules.
The commission will allow a 60-day
comment period, then review the comments and publish final rules followed
by another 60-day comment period.
After that, the commissioners will
vote on whether to adopt the final
regulations.
Whatever the outcome, oil and gas
companies may soon see the fruits of
some 30 years of major technological
advances begin to be reflected in their
reserves reporting. ✦

Truckers and diesel prices
A late-March protest by US truckers fizzled.
Hoping to call attention to crushing increases in
diesel prices, independent truckers at the end of
March drove slowly to disrupt traffic in several
areas and talked about a strike. For the most part,
traffic and business proceeded normally. And the
national average diesel price loitered just below
$4/gal. Do beleaguered truckers know diesel
doesn’t have to be this pricey yet may become
even more so?
Crude prices above $100/bbl largely explain
recent spurts in prices of diesel and other oil products, of course. But they don’t explain why diesel
has come to sell at a stout premium to gasoline
most of the time instead of the discount that once
was more common. The new diesel-gasoline price
relationship reflects increases in the cost of making
diesel and in demand for the fuel—increases aggravated by governmental excess.

limit required more new or retrofitted equipment
and much greater investment. Making 15 ppm sulfur diesel requires greater inputs of hydrogen and
more crude per barrel of product than would have
been required by the 50 ppm alternative. According to industry estimates made before EPA issued
its rule, setting the limit at 15 ppm instead of 50
ppm at least doubled the cost of the 2000 sulfur
cut. EPA mandated the costlier option anyway.
Now, therefore, highway vehicles burn a fuel
that’s much more sophisticated and expensive to
make than what they used before mid-2006. It’s a
fuel with physical limits on supply because of the
costly equipment needed for its manufacture and
the relatively low volumes available in international trade. And, if industry groups were right about
an environmental position they were willing to
defend in court as they unsuccessfully challenged
EPA’s jurisdiction, it’s a fuel more costly and less
plentiful than it should be.

The new Iraqi National Constitution left as many petroleum questions
unanswered as it answered. It not only
separated branches of government
but also established federalism as its
lodestar. Due to unresolved legal issues
covering regional and national control
over petroleum resources, oil companies continue to function in a hazy legal
environment.

While these conflicting, if not mutually exclusive, constitutional provisions
optimally embody compromise and the
wish to expedite a constitution palatable to all stakeholders, they may set the
stage for wholesale political conflict or
even violence in an already shattered
country.

oil ministry, which in September stated
that the deals are illegal and do not have
the proper legal force to go forward.4
The KRG rejects this claim and stated
that it not only has the legal authority
but also will continue its current talks
with a number of local and international oil and gas companies.4
The KRG signed a PSA with a subsidiary of Toronto’s Heritage Oil for drilling in the Miran block and authorized
another with the French oil and gas
company Perenco for the Sindi-Amedi
block. Frustrated by the Iraqi parliament’s slow passage of the nationwide
draft oil and gas law, the KRG sought to
increase its own production from several hundred thousand barrels per day
to 1 million b/d in about 5 years.4
The KRG oil and gas council also has
set its sights on enhancing the region’s
refining capacity. In 2007, the KRG
approved construction of two 20,000
b/d refineries valued at a total of $300
million. Heritage Oil will construct one
in the vicinity of the Miran block area,
while Addax Petroleum and Turkish
partner Genel Enerji will build another
in the Taq Taq oil field area.
The issue of Kirkuk is central in the
eyes of the KRG and is a point of contention between the federal authorities
and the KRG. The Kirkuk region, which
sets atop a field holding 15 billion bbl
of Iraq’s estimated 115 billion bbl, falls
outside of the Kurdish-administered
area. A referendum will determine
whether Kirkuk, and its surrounding
provinces of Diyala and Ninawa, will
become part of the Kurdistan region.4
Article 140 of the constitution
initially recognized that the Kirkuk
referendum would be held by Dec. 31,
2007. However, persistent delays and
allegations of ethnic cleansing have held
it back for a further 6 months.5 Control
of this oil-rich governorate is a major
source of friction between the KRG and
Baghdad.

2007, Iraqi Oil Minister Hussain alShahristani stated, “[There] are many
measures the federal government is
thinking of taking against these companies, and one of them is to blacklist
them and prevent them from working
in Iraq in the future.”6 He ratcheted up
the pressure on Nov. 24, 2007, by proclaiming the deals “null and void.”6
In order to counter the KRG law, and
in the absence of a national oil law, he
threatened to utilize Saddam-era legislation to block these deals.7 “[The] federal government’s position toward these
new deals is that any contract signed
without its approval isn’t considered a
contract,” he said.7
The KRG responded to the oil minister’s threatened use of Saddam-era laws
by stating that most of Saddam’s laws
are null and void because they conflict
with the new constitution.8
To add teeth to its pronouncements, federal officials declared that any
contracts signed without the approval
of the central authorities would be
considered “smuggling.”8 Al-Shahristani
contended that, under Hussein-era
hydrocarbon law and the current Iraqi
draft law, the state oil marketing body

is the only organization authorized to
export Iraqi oil. Hence exportation by
any other means is “smuggling.”9
The central authorities set out the
parameters by forbidding oil companies
from purchasing Iraqi oil or bidding on
upcoming projects in Iraq’s oil and gas
sector if they’ve signed any deals with
the KRG since February 2007. This date
is significant as the benchmark when
Baghdad and the KRG reached a temporary compromise; however, it fell apart
a few months later.10
Predictably, the oil ministry sent
letters to companies that have signed
exploration and production agreements
with the KRG, canceling any prior
agreements with Baghdad.
Cancellation letters were sent to SK
Energy of South Korea, OMV, and Reliance Energy, and the central authorities
also cut crude exports to SK Energy.11

resolve this dispute through diplomatic
and political measures. KRG Prime
Minister Nichervan Barzani visited
South Korea to meet with its presidentelect Lee Myung-Bak to reassure that
all the energy deals signed were legal
as per the Iraqi oil and gas regime. Further, during the meeting, Myung-Bak
requested more cooperation with the
KRG for expansion of oil and gas development by South Korean companies in
the Kurdish region.
One of the more controversial PSAs
is with US-based Hunt Oil. The territory under exploration falls outside of
the Kurdistan region, in the Ninawah
Governorate. This region was historically populated by Kurds, who the KRG
hopes will join the region along with
Kirkuk after the referendum.13 If the
central government’s suspicions are
true, the KRG has broader political ambitions in the control of oil and gas in

currently resort to importing or “smuggling” refined fuel from neighboring
countries. This region lacks refineries,
and none of the region’s oil installations is connected to Iraqi refineries for
smooth export.
Moreover, Syria and Iran, which
have little incentive to see a prosperous Kurdish-dominated region, have
pledged their assistance to Baghdad in
any potential blockade.
Many firms also would be reluctant
to sign any further contracts if a legal
and safe export route were not available.
For example, DNO, the Norwegian oil
firm, has repeatedly asked that Baghdad
grant an export permit as an inducement for increased production.16

development of a vibrant and autonomous Kurdish region, which could stir
Turkey’s own restive Kurdish population.
However, the political impasse may
be the ultimate force to spur compromise between the various stakeholders.17 Pressure is mounting against the
KRG’s position. On Jan. 15, 2008, a majority of Iraq’s parliamentarians signed a
public statement denouncing the KRG’s
“unilateral” actions to sign contracts.
Osama Najafi, of former Prime Minister
Ayad Allawi’s secular National List party,
stated at a news conference, “[There]
must be a formula for maintaining the
unity of Iraq and the distribution of its
wealth.”
After the KRG and Hunt Oil signed
a production-sharing contract in 2007,
the US State Department cautioned that
this collaboration hurt Baghdad’s efforts
to “reconcile and rule the country.”18

Rightful jurisdiction
Which governmental level has rightful jurisdiction? Article 111 of the Iraqi
constitution states that oil and gas are
the property of all Iraqi people; however, Article 112 vests Baghdad with
authority to manage existing fields.
The phrase, “existing field,” is not
an industry-specific term; therefore, it
leaves room for considerable ambiguity.
Proceeds from these “existing fields”
are to be shared on a per capita basis,
with certain benefits given to regions
that bore the brunt of Saddam’s brutality and economic exclusion.
By the simplest logic, new fields are
to be managed by the regions as they
see fit. The duty to allocate proceeds is
also ambiguous because only Article
112 deals with proceeds and only in
conjunction with existing fields, not
new fields.
It appears that the KRG has a stronger legal argument because Baghdad has no jurisdiction over general
exploration or production. Yet the KRG
is constrained by Article 112, which
declares that the central authority and
the resource-rich regions will exercise
joint authority to set national oil and

gas policy.
At the very least it will seem that
the regions must consult with central
authorities in Baghdad to set a national
oil policy.
Further, the KRG is limited by the
practical, ground-level reality that
Baghdad has the capacity to establish an
embargo on oil exports from the KRG
and effectively block the flow of Kurdish oil.
As this article goes to press, the parties have engaged in neither a public
reconciliation nor meaningful debate.
Oil and gas companies contemplating
oil deals in Iraq likely will have to deal
with the central authorities one way
or another in order to effectively plan
business strategy for exploration and
production with the KRG. However, one
undeniable truth remains: If this shattered land is to heal and develop its economic potential, the stakeholders will
have to soon come together to resolve
their differences. ✦

that “crises” don’t last 30 years unless

For the past 35 years, whenever high
energy prices caused public consternation, politicians have been quick to
inform the American electorate of a
planned path to energy independence
via a familiar and recurring set of
regulations, government subsidies, and
technological advances.
Over this same period, global energy markets have responded to these
price signals with increasing supplies
of conventional fuels. Predictably, the
high prices that sparked all the rhetoric and activity soon subside. Quickly
thereafter, the US government and the
consumer lose interest in “advanced”
technologies and return to old buying
and consumption patterns. Any hope of

ing rapidly and new supply sources are
shrinking and becoming more geographically concentrated.
The growth of global energy consumption to support broad improvements in living standards cannot be
denied to the billions of people around
the world whose economies are now
realizing the benefits of decades of
emerging economic progress.
Collectively the same size as the US
market, the emerging economies are
growing three times as fast, and their
continued expansion will have a huge
impact on future energy demand. This
will not only require changes in energy
consumption patterns at home and
abroad, but also a sustained policy of
interdependence and diversification, not
xenophobic independence, among energy producing and energy consuming
nations. While asymmetries may exist in
specific trade relationships, the policy
of interdependence and diversification
among all trading partners creates net
benefits for each and all.
Energy independence is not only an
improbable goal, but it also leads to
inconsistencies in our foreign economic
policy that can blind us to potential
opportunities. In pursuing this objective
we deliberately reverse the economic
trends of the past several decades;
trends that have led to growing interdependence and its numerous benefits
among both developed and developing countries in the spheres of trade,
finance, and energy. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan pointed
to growing global trade among a
widening range of market participants,
more than fiscal or monetary policy, as
primarily responsible for constraining
domestic inflation and fueling economic growth over the past two decades.
It is within this context that we in
the US must engage Russia as a central
player in the global energy economy.
For the US, as historically in Western
Europe, Russia presents an opportunity
for diversifying, not concentrating, the
political risks of our reliance on energy
imports. Russia has supplied Western
oil markets for more than a century;

it now reliably supplies Europe with a
quarter of its natural gas consumption.
Despite the rhetoric from all sides and
sensationalized Western press editorials on the perceived threats that Russia
presents to US and Western strategic
interests, Russia’s long-term social and
economic growth and security are
much better served through economic
engagement with Western economies
than through isolation and confrontation.
Acknowledging these bilateral benefits in 2002, Presidents George W. Bush
and Vladimir Putin designated energy
cooperation as a major joint priority. Our focus on this important goal
has now been lost as other issues have
crowded the center stage. Selling fear
rooted in the past does not protect the
future. The US needs to revive this sensible bilateral policy and re-engage Russia in order to foster an interdependent
relationship based on shared concerns
and reciprocal needs.
OAO Gazprom, Russia’s largest oil
and gas company, now comes knocking
on North America’s front door with offers of competitively priced natural gas
delivered as LNG. As the US and Canada
appear to be at best on a treadmill when
it comes to natural gas production, such
diversification of supply sources should

T E R E S T
be welcome. Partial reliance on Russian gas supplies is not a threat to our
economic security, but an act of supply
diversification that reduces overall energy security risk and brings benefits to
both countries.
Gazprom is not a passive participant
in world energy markets, but few have
ever accused the titans of the energy
industry, irrespective of where they are
domiciled, of engaging in a gentleman’s
sport. The energy business is brutally
competitive. Gazprom has been financially successful in its energy export
business through tough negotiations
with its peers and counterparties. If
this does not make it cuddly in the eyes
of the West, perhaps that is the fate of
all major international energy firms,
which must pursue their commercial objectives in a highly politicized
environment. And note that all national
governments, including the US, actively
promote and assist homegrown energy
firms in pursuit of national interests.
It is time to reap the benefits that
an interdependent policy would offer.
For the foreseeable future, the US must
depend on its trading partners to supply
a large share of our energy supplies,
primarily in the form of oil and gas. It
makes perfect sense to ensure that these
sources are as diversified as possible

while we develop and deploy truly
game-changing technologies and more
energy-efficient practices.
The US and Russia must acknowledge the symbiotic value of bilateral
energy trade and its role in expanding
commercial and economic relations
that will build and sustain mutual trust
between our two countries. It is my
hope that dialogue replaces the noise so
that we can capitalize on this moment
in time to promote economic security
for both our nations. ✦

MEGC: Oil price strength here to stay; demand fails to waver
Marilyn Radler
Senior Editor-Economics
Oil price volatility is here to stay,
with prices fluctuating within the
range of $70-110/bbl and averaging
$85-90/bbl this year. Also, demand
growth has failed to waver because new
players have emerged, with growth in
China and the Middle East, according
to Fereidun Fesharaki, chairman and
chief executive officer of FACTS Global
Energy.
Fesharaki voiced his comments Apr.
7 during the opening of the sixteenth
annual Middle East Petroleum & Gas
28

Conference (MEGC), which was
themed “Oil Market Fundamentals in
the Middle East: Geopolitics vs. Geology.”
Fesharaki, who served as MEGC
conference chairman, gave a commentary on the state of the global oil and
gas markets, touching on a variety of
aspects.
He said for oil demand to diminish in the US, it will probably take an
oil price of $150/bbl, but this price
needs to come as part of a package that
includes taxes, Corporate Average Fuel
Economy standards, and other restrictions on consumption.

Speaking about the future of supply,
Fesharaki said oil supplies from producing countries outside the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
plateau within 3-5 years. Further, with
OPEC’s annual production decline rates
of at least 1.5 million b/d and assumed
annual demand growth of 1.5 million
b/d, the organization needs to add at
least 15 million b/d of capacity every
5 years. “This is an impossible task,”
Fesharaki said.
As for the global refining picture, he
said from the recent refining capacity
shortages that led to high prices, the
world is now heading for a surplus of

capacity, and refiners in Europe and
Japan will suffer the most. Meanwhile,
Middle Eastern refiners are a bit late on
the scene and must now focus on local
markets rather than depend on exports
of products. Fesharaki predicts that
by 2015, the world will have a huge
gasoline surplus and a sizeable diesel
shortage.
As for natural gas, Fesharaki spoke a
bit about LNG, saying that the buyer’s
market is gone forever, but markets will
ease in the second half of 2009. Fesharaki also said Qatar is unlikely to raise

T E R E S T
its LNG exports above their committed
77 million tonnes/year.
In a keynote speech, Adil A. AlTubayyeb, Saudi Aramco vice-president
of marketing, supply, and joint venture
coordination, advocated transforming
the Middle East energy business by creating a regional trading hub for refined
products. He sees the hub of countries
near the Eastern Mediterranean, Arabian
Gulf, and Indian Ocean as critical in
meeting both local and global customer
needs.
Al-Tubayyeb said in addition to the

favorable geography, the supply and
demand dynamics of the region, and
the growing refining capacity there, a
regional benchmark should be established.
The current Arab Gulf benchmarks
are not reflective of the region’s fundamentals, there’s no transparency, and
the netbacks are based on distant markets, he said. Also, trading in the region
currently uses a simplistic approach and
doesn’t follow Arab Gulf trade dynamics
or market intelligence, and it has other
drawbacks as well. ✦

BP, ConocoPhillips join to build $20 billion Denali gas line
BP PLC and ConocoPhillips announced they will join resources to
build a 4 bcfd natural gas pipeline
extending from Alaska’s North Slope to
markets in Canada and the US. Dubbed
Denali, the proposed $20 billion Alaskan
gas line would be the “largest privatesector construction project ever built in
North America,” the partners said.
In a press conference held Apr. 8,
BP and ConocoPhillips revealed plans
to spend $600 million over the next
36 months on the first of many phases
of the Denali line, namely an open
season, which is slated to begin before
yearend 2010. After the open season,
the companies will file to obtain certification from the US Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission and Canada’s
National Energy Board for authorization
to move forward with construction of
the project.
The partners also will have to
convince Alaskan authorities that their
plan is the best one for developing the
state’s gas resources and that it’s in line
with the state’s Alaska Gasline Inducement Act (AGIA), passed midyear 2007
and adopted in February. AGIA, which
was designed to advance construction
of a gas pipeline from ANS, requires a
pipeline project builder to meet certain
requirements that will advance the
project, in exchange for a license that
provides up to $500 million in match30

ing funds. These funds would help reduce the financial risks that such a huge
project faces in its early stages.
Alaska received five applications
for gas pipeline proposals. These came
from AEnergia LLC, the Alaska Gasline
Port Authority, the Alaska Natural Gas
Development Authority, Little Susitna
Construction Co., and a joint application from TransCanada Alaska Co. LLC
and Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd. TransCanada’s proposal was the only one to
be accepted as completed. A proposal
submitted by ConocoPhillips did not
meet the state’s application criteria, the
state said. BP and ExxonMobil Corp. did
not submit an application.
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said of BP
and ConocoPhillips’s latest effort: “We
look forward to any progress they will
be able to show us on this project. Their
decision to proceed is further proof that
competition does work.”
As OGJ went to press last week,
TransCanada had not released any comment regarding BP and ConocoPhillips’s
announcement. The Calgary-based firm
however already is working with ConocoPhillips to construct the 2,148-mile
Keystone oil pipeline from Alberta to
the US Midwest and Cushing, Okla.

Project details
BP and ConocoPhillips said they will
form a new company, to be headquar-

tered in Anchorage, to manage the
Denali project. During the Apr. 8 press
conference, the companies reported that
a joint project team has been mobilized
and that field work will begin this summer on the line.
The project will comprise about
2,000 miles of large-diameter, buried
pipeline that will transverse Alaska, the
Yukon Territory and British Columbia to
Alberta. The line will operate at about
2,500 psi and will have 40,000-hp
compressor stations every 100-200
miles. A gas treatment plant will be
built near existing Prudhoe Bay facilities. The line will require 5-6 million
tons of steel, the partners said.
The companies said should it later
be required to transport gas on from
Alberta, the project will also include
about 1,500 miles of large-diameter
line from Alberta on to the Lower 48
states. The companies said they would
seek “other equity partners, including
pipeline companies,” that would “add
value to the project and help manage
the risks involved.” Press reports have
indicated that ExxonMobil Corp., the
third-largest ANS producer, has been
asked to join.
The partners said the Denali line will
support in-state gas distribution efforts
including gas to south-central Alaska.
The line will provide at least five Alaskan offtake points, including Fairbanks.

‘Great news’ for Alaska
Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alas.)
welcomed the announcement. “It is
great news for Alaska that companies
that control well more than 60% of
the North Slope’s natural gas are now
committing themselves to move ahead
to build a gas pipeline. This should
give utilities in the Lower 48 states and
suppliers worldwide some confidence
in planning on Alaska’s gas getting into
America’s market by about 2019, which
is probably the most important ingredient in making sure that Alaska’s gas
is not replaced by an imported liquid
natural gas,” she said.
Murkowski also congratulated Gov.
Palin for helping to bring about the
ConocoPhillips-BP announcement. “By
her tough stance over the past 2 years,
she has brought the companies around
to building a gas line now. It is unlikely
this announcement would have come
today, if not for a process like AGIA that
has crystallized the outlook for development of Alaska’s North Slope gas
reserves,” Murkowski said. “Hopefully,
before too long, TransCanada will be
brought into this marriage, as I hope
ExxonMobil also will decide to join in
the not too distant future,” she added.

‘Positive and important’
The Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee’s leadership applauded the news. Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) called it “a positive and
important” development which would
do more than bring vast reserves of
previously stranded North Slope gas to
markets. “In addition, as the largest private construction project ever in North
America, the pipeline will provide great
economic stimulus by creating thousands of jobs and business opportunities in the US and Canada,” he said.
Pete V. Domenici (R-NM), the committee’s ranking minority member,
said, “Ultimately, when constructed,
the new Alaska gas pipeline will bring
natural gas in Alaska’s North Slope to
Alberta, where it can eventually connect
with existing lines and be brought to
the Lower 48 states. With uncertainty

“In Garfield County, an operators’ group meets monthly to discuss
common issues. This time of year,
they involve mud and dust,” Avillar
said. When one surface landowner
in a split-estate situation complained
about dust, Williams sent out a water

might be even more expensive without the unfortunate 19% reduction by
industrial gas users, reflected in closed
plants and lost jobs. This new pipeline
will counter both those unhappy trends
by adding 4 bcfd to our supply, which
is enough to fill 6-8% of America’s daily

“Life in America requires energy, and
we’ve got enormous reserves of it right

When Cantwell asked three energy

a year ago that oil prices would exceed
$100/bbl, they all said they did not and
declined to forecast where prices would

he Chukchi Sea in Alaska could
one day compare with the US
Gulf of Mexico as a source of energy
for the US, according to a statement
by Rick Fox, assets manager of Royal
Dutch Shell PLC’s Alaskan unit.
Fox claimed that the acreage, off
the state’s northwest coast, could
yield one of the “potentially most
prolific oil fields” left in the world,
with some 100 different geological
plays estimated.
The US Minerals Management
Service estimates that the Chukchi
Sea might contain 15 billion bbl of
recoverable oil and 2.2 trillion cu m
of natural gas.
According to the MMS’s environmental impact assessment, however,
new offshore drilling would introduce a 33-51% chance of a major oil
spill, an occurrence which could have
a severe impact on polar bears and
other marine mammals.
Last week, an obstacle to exploitation took place when the National
Wildlife Federation urged Congress
to protect America’s polar bears from
the impacts of climate change. It
wants Congress to list polar bears under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).

bear habitat under the ESA when it
proceeded to sell exploration licenses
for the Chukchi Sea on Feb. 6.
“The [ESA] clearly states that listing decisions must be made based
on the best available scientific data,
not on the political or economic
consequences of the listing,” said Dr.
Doug Inkley, a senior scientist at the
National Wildlife Federation.
“The science clearly shows the polar bear’s future is on thin ice,” Inkley
told Congress. “The legal protections
provided under the [ESA] would be
a first step towards minimizing the
impacts of global warming and other
threats on the polar bear.”

noted that Rep. John B. Larson (DConn.) plans to introduce a bill that
would require investors to take delivery
of crude oil and petroleum products.
Doing this would eliminate speculation
by those who are driving prices higher
from oil and gas markets, Larson said in
Hartford on Mar. 31 as he announced
his plan. He plans to introduce the legislation soon, a spokeswoman told OGJ
on Apr. 4.
“For me, after today’s testimony, I
wonder whether we haven’t made a
mistake in not trying to regulate speculators on the oil market more closely,”
Domenici said during the hearing.

Proposal’s impacts
But Jeffrey Harris, CFTC’s chief
economist, warned that Larson’s approach would remove from the market
an entire class of investors who take
positions that others won’t take. “I don’t
think trying to identify speculation’s
part of today’s oil price constructively
moves the discussion forward,” added
another witness, Sarah A. Emerson,
managing director of Energy Security
Analysis Inc., Wakefield, Mass.
“There’s a difference between
speculation and the casino example
used earlier,” she told the committee.
Institutions such as the California Public
Employees Retirement System (CalPERS), the largest US public pension
fund, buy oil derivatives to add value to
their portfolios, Emerson said. “These
are not gamblers,” she maintained.
A third witness, Cambridge Energy
Research Associates Managing Director
James Burkhard, also said that noncommercial investors are not simply
short-term speculators but include pension fund, university endowment, and
other institutions’ financial managers.
They also help keep markets liquid, he
indicated.
“The growing role of noncommercial investors can accentuate a given
price trend, but the primary reasons
for rising oil prices in recent years are
rooted in the fundamentals of demand
and supply, geopolitical risks, and rising
industry costs,” Burkhard said. “The

decline in the value of the dollar has
also played a role, particularly since the
credit crisis first erupted last summer
when energy and other commodities
became caught up in the upheaval of
the global economy.”
As lower interest rates and anticipation of further cuts pushed the dollar
lower, oil became what Burkhard called
the “new gold,” a financial asset in
which investors seek refuge as inflation
rises and the dollar’s value weakened.
“Today’s dynamics in the marketplace
reveal oil’s increasingly cosmopolitan
nature,” he said. “Its price reflects not
only demand and supply, but broader
macroeconomic and geopolitical
changes such as the growing influence
of Asia, the Middle East, Russia, and the
Caspian countries,” he said in his written testimony.

Won’t last forever
Kevin Book, senior vice-president of
FBR Capital Markets Corp., Arlington,
Va., said it may be true that noncommercial buyers of oil forward and
futures contracts may be driving the

T E R E S T
price higher because institutional investors are seeking a value-retaining refuge
from the falling dollar. “This phenomenon certainly won’t be true forever and
may not even be true for long,” he said.
“If funds flowing into commodities
are indeed elevating oil futures, then
accumulating evidence of a slowdown
within the world’s biggest oil consuming economies could provoke an equal
and opposite reaction as conservative
investors close their positions and aggressive investors sell short,” Book said.
Book and other witnesses noted
that sovereign funds, which invest
oil-producing countries’ revenues, are
a growing noncommercial oil futures
class. Harris said the CFTC is aware of
this group’s activities but does not have
extensive data on it. He also confirmed
that the agency’s staffing is at an historic
low at a time when futures and derivatives trading are at an historic peak. “We
can see what’s happening in markets we
don’t regulate by the behavior of large
traders and other reports we receive,”
Harris said.
Emerson pointed out that national

oil companies in producing nations are
making a lot of money and investing a
lot of it in new capacity, which is good.
Asked by Bingaman about steps the
US could take, she replied, “There’s no
quick fix. I think the margin requirements need to be raised for oil futures
trading. It’s one tool Congress can use.”
Other witnesses agreed.
Burkhard said that oil prices in the
$110-120/bbl range over 6 months
would reduce demand even in China,
India, and other economically growing nations. “It can’t keep climbing,
and there will be some relief. But it’s
important to remember that an entire
generation of employees didn’t enter
the oil industry in the 1980s and ’90s
because the price was so low. It could
take 10-15 years to recover from this,”
he said.
Dorgan remained skeptical. “You’d
have to be drunk to not understand that
when you run an $800 billion trade
deficit, it won’t have an impact on the
value of the dollar,” he conceded. “But
there also are speculators involved.” ✦

Congress enters new phase of climate change deliberations
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
US House Energy and Commerce
Committee Chairman John D. Dingell
(D-Mich.) recognizes some familiar
complaints and proposals as Congress
discusses energy and environmental issues in 2008. He also expects the coming battles to be the toughest yet.
“It probably will be the most complex and difficult discussion in my time
in Congress. The Energy Information
Administration’s role in analyzing potential impacts of various proposals will
be critical,” the veteran federal legislator told attendees Apr. 8 at EIA’s Annual
Energy Outlook conference.
“This is one of the most crucial
periods for energy policy in the history
of this nation,” said Dingell, who was
36

a major force behind EIA’s creation 30
years ago. “We now confront the same
issues we have over the years. We seem
to be enacting the same kind of legislation in response to the same problems:
limited supplies, rising prices, and
citizen complaints.”
The major difference is that voters
and lawmakers are incorporating global
climate change issues in energy discussions, he said. “We ended 2007 with
an energy bill we all can be proud of,
with tougher automotive fuel efficiency
standards and expanded biofuels incentives,” he said.
“EIA did not endear itself to Congress when it reported that the benefits
won’t be fully realized because the programs probably won’t be fully funded,
but that’s why we put it in business: to
offer unbiased assessments of our ac-

tions, even when it isn’t what we’d like
to hear,” Dingell said.

The next phase
Congress now is in a new phase
of its global climate change deliberations as it considers whether to enact a
carbon cap-and-trade program, Dingell
said. The Senate has the bill cosponsored
by Joseph I. Lieberman (I-Conn.) and
John W. Warner (R-Va.) while Dingell’s
committee is discussing whether elements of the successful sulfur dioxide
program from the 1980s can be used
in the more difficult carbon dioxide
situation.
“We are moving forward, but not
as quickly as we’d like. But we are
determined to get it right,” he said
of his committee’s efforts. One question is whether a carbon cap-and-trade

program would use State Implementation Plans, New Source Review, or an
entirely new approach, Dingell said.
“We’re looking at carbon capture and
storage, new technologies, and other
components to continue using coal in
an environmentally proper way, since
the United States is, in fact, the ‘Saudi
Arabia of coal.’ Any plan also must
include judicious use of our domestic
natural gas resources. It is my hope that
we can adopt legislation to address all
these problems before the end of this
year,” he said.
Robert M. Simon, Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee’s staff director, said he does not expect Congress
to pass a comprehensive climate change
bill in 2008. “Our chances of having
one by the end of this session aren’t
good, so the question becomes what
smaller steps can be taken,” he said.
Simon said Congress has passed three
major laws (namely, the Energy Policy
Act of 2005, the America Competes Act
of 2007, and the Energy Independence
and Security Act) that started to address
global climate change.

‘Robust oversight’
“The whole process of moving an
important policy forward is remembering what you’ve done and continuing
to make progress,” Simon said. “Part
of this is a robust oversight program
to make sure these laws’ provisions are
implemented and the results are what
Congress intended.”
John Shanahan, who until recently
served as senior minority counsel on
the Senate Environment and Public
Works Committee, and two current
congressional Republican staff members
each said that US carbon emissions reduction programs won’t have a meaningful impact unless other countries
participate.
“Last year, [the US Environmental
Protection Agency] found that without
China taking aggressive action, emissions would continue to go up even
if the United States adopted aggressive standards,” Shanahan said. “If, by
our actions, we let China off the hook,

we will have economically retrenched
without environmental benefits,” he
warned.
Frank Macchiarola, the Senate Energy
and Natural Resources Committee’s
minority staff director, said while China
and India represented only 13% of the
world’s total energy consumption in
1990, the most conservative estimates
put their share around 30% by 2030.
“Such statistics show that energy and
environmental issues must be addressed
globally. Literally dozens of climate
change bills have been introduced, but
none of them require reductions by our
global competitors,” he said, adding
that he expects congressional enthusiasm for global climate change initiatives
to be dampened by growing economic
concerns.
David J. McCarthy, minority chief
counsel for energy and environment on
the House Energy and Commerce Committee, generally agreed. “Most members of Congress are hearing from their
constituents about the impact of higher
gasoline prices. It’s not just disgruntled
Soccer Moms, but small businesses such
as the florist who canceled deliveries
one day last week because the price of
flowers did not equal the cost of gasoline,” he said.

Gas collection points
Shanahan said the Lieberman-Warner bill is headed for the Senate floor
without substantive hearings before the
Environment and Public Works Committee on questions such as natural
gas carbon cap-and-trade payment
collection points, which could create
unexpected problems. Republicans who
proposed 108 amendments were told
that questions such as nuclear power’s
role would be addressed during floor
debate, he said. “Then the message became that the bill can’t be changed and
will be recalled if it is watered down,”
Shanahan said.
Pete V. Domenici (R-NM), the Senate
Energy and Natural Resources Committee’s ranking minority member, said
the US should reduce carbon dioxide
emissions but added that impacts will

be minimal without international cooperation. “Some of America’s foremost
economists are questioning the value of
a cap-and-trade system. As we approach
floor debate on the Lieberman-Warner
bill, I hope common sense prevails,” he
said in separate remarks on Apr. 4.
“We have to consider complex issues
in a sober manner, but we can’t stand
still,” said Simon. “Absent an effective
program to address global warming,
we’re stuck. We’re not building new
coal-fired power plants, nuclear isn’t
being serious considered, and we’re
continuing our de facto reliance on
natural gas to generate electricity. Even

T E R E S T
if we do nothing, energy prices will
continue to go up.”
Macchiarola said any climate change
strategy will need to tap private markets. Simon responded that investors
are waiting for Congress to set the
ground rules. “When you get a bunch
of investment bankers in a room, their
first question is when Congress will put
a price on carbon,” he said.
Former US Rep. Philip R. Sharp
(D-Ind.), the current president of
Resources for the Future, who moderated the panel discussion with the four
congressional staff members, recalled
that Congress debated plans to reduce
sulfur dioxide emissions for years in

the 1980s but did not act until George
H.W. Bush became president and initiated a specific plan. The same could be
true of a carbon cap-and-trade program
and George W. Bush’s successor, Sharp
suggested.
The congressional staffers observed
that there can be a major difference
between what a candidate says during the campaign and what he or she
actually does upon election. McCarthy
added that of the 4,000 interviews the
two major parties’ presidential candidates have given, only four dealt with
global climate change. “Health care and
the economy are bigger issues now,” he
said. ✦

Central Depression in Armenia, Nigeria’s inland Anambra basin, Guyana’s
inland Takutu basin, northern Chile’s
Tamarugal basin, and the Chukchi basin
off northwestern Alaska.

Danakil depression, Ethiopia
Afar Exploration Co., Tulsa, recently
completed airborne gravity-magnetic
data acquisition over parts of its 3.75
million acre block in the Danakil depression of nonproducing Ethiopia.
The Danakil depression is the hottest
and lowest place on earth at 375 ft below sea level and as much as 145°.
Results of the surveys are the discovery of an evaporite basin to depths of
15,000 ft caused by a failed rift system
parallel to the Red Sea. Reservoir
rocks are the Miocene Desset sandstone at 5,000 ft and the Cretaceous Adigrat sandstone at 9,000
ft, both more than 1,000 ft thick.
Recoverable oil is expected to be
in excess of 6 billion bbl.
The Dallol salt dome, 26 by 10
miles, is the main area of interest
with active oil and gas seeps on
its flank. The dome was discovered
on a BHP Billiton field trip in the
spring of 2007.
No exploration well has been
drilled to date in the north half of
Ethiopia. Afar Exploration expects
to drill in the fall of 2008.
Other companies in the Afar
region of eastern Ethiopia are Trans

Anambra basin, Nigeria
A joint venture of Afren PLC and
Global Energy Co. Ltd. of Nigeria plans
drilling in 2009 to appraise decadesold gas-condensate and gas and oil
discoveries in Nigeria’s nonproducing
Anambra basin (Fig. 2).
The company refers to Anambra
as Nigeria’s second most prospective
basin. The OPL 907 and 917 total 3,500
sq km.
The partnership of Afren Global Energy Resources became operator of and
took 41% interest in OPL 907 and 42%
interest in OPL 917 in the underexplored basin. The Anambra basin, with
a gas resource estimated at more than 5
tcf, has 30 wells and six discoveries.
On OPL 907 the group will evaluate
existing data, shoot 1,000 km of 2D
seismic, and drill one or more appraisal
wells near the Akukwa discovery.
Shell drilled four shallow core holes
before Shell and British Petroleum
discovered Akukwa in 1955 and drilling
Akukwa-2 in 1956. Akukwa has estimated gas in place of up to 400 bcf.

On OPL 917 a different group will
evaluate existing data, shoot 2D seismic over the 1971 Igbariam discovery,
and identify leads and prospects before
drilling appraising Igbariam.
Shell and BP’s Igbariam-1 encountered a reported 196-ft net gas column

ethane, propane and traces of condensate.”
Cuttings analysis indicated that the
zones “consist of varying amounts of
volcanic tuff and orthoquartzite, tight
volcanic sands that appear to have varying fracture concentrations at various
depths. This type of volcanic sand has
shown very strong production results
in other areas of the world, as it typically responds favorably to mechanical
fracturing.”
March said the main target in the
well is a “thrust zone that cuts vertically through any existing black shales
in the hanging wall or the footwall
of this structure. The black shales are
considered to be the source rock in this
basin. The surface expression of this
thrust has a north-south extension of
approximately 30 km, which was seen
in the original 2D seismic lines previously shot.”
It explained that this is the type of
structure that exists in the overthrust

as well as the known structural formations in the Neuquen basin of Argentina
and the Llanos basin of Colombia.

hard and the reservoir sands abrasive.
This makes the Changbei wells capital intensive, even though the rigs are
probably among the cheapest of their
kind at present.
Some equipment is starting to show
wear 21⁄2 years into the project, due to
harsh drilling conditions, substandard
maintenance, procedures, and gear. This
is especially true of drill pipe strings.
Frequently, drill pipe boxes split and wash
out, resulting in fishing jobs and scrapped
pipe. Shell formed a special team to identify the causes and rectify the problems.
So far it has become clear that the pipe
handling is not good and the locally
sourced power tongs used to make up

Quality
This illustrates the struggle that Shell
faces when it comes to delivering highquality wells. Each of the new horizontal
wells costs about four times the cost of a
vertically drilled and hydraulically fractured well common in this part of China.
Shell has to prove the horizontal well
technology and at the same time find a
delicate balance between cost and quality
to defend the right to be working here.
The cost-quality ratio is present
in every aspect of daily drilling and
completion work. For example, a local

and justifiable progression of junior
staff to senior positions, thus reducing
the expatriate content of the team, as
intended.

Progress, milestones
After the Changbei field has been
operating for more than 2 years, only
eight wells have been completed. Even
so, Shell’s partner, Petrochina, believes that many milestones have been
achieved. The first and foremost is a
large advancement in technology.
Drilling the longest horizontal wells
in China in both 8-in. and 6-in. hole
sizes is substantiating that Changbei
field-development plans are correct. Out
of these wells, six have a higher than
planned initial and continuous production, proving that reservoir impairment
has been prevented, even though the
sands are generally tight and low pressured.
The second milestone is in HSE
performance. Only two minor lost-time
incidents have occurred. Both PetroChina and Shell intend to reach this
year’s safety target for the Changbei
project. PetroChina is confident that if
the new learning curve can be achieved
the contractual target can be met. It can
use the technical and HSE expertise well
in its other operations.

Drilling obstacles, solutions
Generally, Chinese drilling contractors are unfamiliar with the concept of
NPT and key performance indicators.
Because the mother company decides
which rig and operation has precedence, if a rig has to wait, it is accepted.
Most Chinese rigs are contracted on
a lump sum basis. A contractor will
get paid only after reaching an agreed
depth in the well or hole section.
Changbei contractors initially liked
the daily rig rate because even when
operations had delays due to mechanical issues they still got paid. There were
no discussions concerning the final
monthly billing sheets. This changed
rapidly after they realized that the
total of rig rate and standby rate could
quickly be consumed and change into a

zero rate with increasing downtime.
SCEPCO is now actively working with
the contractors and moving to a win-win
midpoint with an incentive structure,
based on overall actual vs. planned well
timings. Given the mix of languages,
practices, and cultures, communication
can be a major problem. To get to the

bottom of things one has to be very precise and ask only open questions—ones
that can not be answered with a simple
yes or no.
Chinese drilling companies do not

the time, the DE and RM are the best
educated, but often lack rig floor experience. For the Changbei project, tool
pushers have been appointed, but the
modus operandi at other Shell locations
has to be carefully revised to prevent
shortcomings in communications and
hence operations.
By far the largest factor for lost time
in the wells has been problems in drilling the bottom of the 121⁄4-in. section.
The formations in the Shanxi are hard
mud and clay stones, interbedded with
fragile coal seams. These seams can fail,
causing large, hard cavings to fill the
wellbore and resulting in stuck pipe and
mud motor failures due to large bending stresses over washed-out sections.
The team has come up with special
procedures and BHA configurations to
avoid these events and improve ROP.
Currently, there is a drive to optimize
the use of PDC bits and minimize sliding with mud motors.
The regional team of experts in
Miri, Malaysia, together with two mud
specialists in the field have come up
with an improved KCl-based drilling fluid that is currently being tried.
This is key to avoid losses in the upper
Liujjiagou formation while preventing
large cavings in the Shanxi formation
and retaining a contingency to clean
the wellbore in case cavings occur. The
mud is pretreated with various lostcirculation materials. All these measures
increase the chances the drillers will get
the long 95⁄8-in. production casing into
the Shanxi pay zone.
Lately, more liners have had to be
52

dropped off in the openhole reservoir
holes to stabilize (carbonaceous) shales
that can collapse during production. So
far, all 7-in. and 41⁄2-in. perforated liners
have been successfully installed. Also,
due to unexpected subsurface conditions, it has been necessary to install
intermediate 7-in. cemented liners.
Drilling the subsequent 6-in. section
required special attention to torque and
drag, but good progress has been made
to get to an acceptable drainage-leg
length of 1,900 m.
Drilling such lengths of 6-in. annulus is only possible by using stiffer
4-in. (heavy weight) drill pipe. Staff at
the real time operating center (RTOC)
in Miri aid the directional drillers and
drilling supervisors by modeling the
optimal bottomhole assembly and pipe
configurations. A contracted bit specialist in the operations team has been
working on improving the 6-in. rock
bit design for longer bit runs.
Where the 81⁄2-in. bits experience
considerable gauge wear, the 6-in. bits
normally have bearings fail before the
bit reaches the end of its useful life.
All these iterations have resulted in a
slimmed-down well design as a viable
option for the future and a dependable contingency when dealing with
unstable shales in the reservoir sands.

Learning curve
Shell worldwide is working to
implement LEAN-SIGMA improvement
methodology that complements Shell’s
drilling-the-limit tools. LEAN is more
a philosophy and a toolbox to analyze

and improve drilling than the in-house
process that DTL used to be. The LEAN
approach comes from the automotive
and production industry, having been
successfully developed by companies
like Toyota and General Electric. But,
how do boreholes 3 km underground
compare to making 2,000 cars or 5,000
electric razors each day?
It’s not the reduction of statistical
failure and waste-products that Shell
is after; it’s the mapping of drilling
processes and the identification of
nonvalue-added steps and wasted time
that help to improve delivery of wells
and reduction in failure events. DMAIC
involves: Making detailed process maps
(Defining) and timing the steps (Measuring), looking carefully at the value
and problems of each step (Analyzing),
learning from good or bad practices
(Implementing), and sharing the results
(Controlling) to achieve better and
more uniform performance.
Drilling rigs are run by people, not
robots, all with different ideas and experiences on how best to drill the well
and prevent train wrecks. The LEAN
process helps to capture the best efforts
and practices worth duplicating and
makes them visible for others to improve, especially between departments.
Successful LEAN projects currently under way in the Changbei project include
6-in. hole drilling, tripping, casing
running, and moving rigs, but the first
success story of a LEAN implementation
was the tie-in of Changbei wells. Previously it took around 40 days from the
rig having left a cluster to first gas; now

it takes 14 days. This achievement has been realized by better
scheduling and safe, concurrent operations by the wells, well
services, engineering, and operations teams.
The LEAN process has facilitated communications and
eliminated misunderstandings. It is a commendable effort,
realizing that it takes 150 truckloads to move a rig, every well
has to be lifted with coiled tubing and nitrogen and cleaned
up via temporary pipe work to a flare pit for about 5 days,
tied into the cluster facilities with other wells already onstream, and then introduced to the central production facilities. Efforts are ongoing to realize the next step in the process,
in which new wells are cleaned up directly at the facilities,
negating the need for the results of production testing to
enter the atmosphere.
Because logging while drilling is not cost effective, Shell
has always conducted borehole evaluation as a separate run by
pumping and rotating out of hole. Recently, Shell has successfully introduced shuttle logging, in which smaller tools are
brought to depth efficiently inside drill pipe, then pumped out
and pulled back to surface without having to pump through
the string. This process has saved about 2 days/leg since its
introduction.
Further improvements towards the goal of 160-day wells
have been achieved with the use of agitators and variable gauge
stabilizers (AGS) for both 121⁄4-in. and 81⁄2-in. holes. Because
depth control is much stricter than the lateral control, an AGS
sub is effective in improving the rotary vs. sliding ratio. Sliding
at depth is harder to manage and thus results in lower penetration rates. Using the agitator has been proven to promote the
weight transfer to the bit and, as such, helps with a steady tool
face in case sliding is required. With all of these efforts the
team is confident it can achieve good results.
Last summer, a 17-member electric line crew deployed a
tractor-conveyed PLT string over a lateral junction to evaluate
the contribution of each leg in a well that had yielded disappointing results. The next step in our technology staircase will
be to introduce a capacitance array tool to better understand
the reservoir inflow mechanism of the Changbei wells.
As of February 2008, the three rigs in Changbei had
achieved more than 1,050 days without incident in the middle
of the Gobi Desert.

Record leg
In October 2007, the longest horizontally drilled leg was
superseded again by the drilling of CB3-2 leg 1 to a length of
2,251 m, proving that it is possible to drill such lengths in abrasive narrow sandstones with water-based mud.

This article examines
the feasibility of producing near-zero sulfur FCC
gasoline by FCC feed
pretreatment and gasoRefining
line posttreatment. The
transition to 10 from 50
ppm sulfur in the FCC gasoline using
feed pretreatment drastically shortens
the cycle length and significantly increases the cost
for production
of near-zero
sulfur gasoline.
A possible way to
cut costs is
to fractionate
full-range FCC gasoline into two fractions: initial boiling point (IBP) to 140°
C. and 140° C. to final boiling point
(FBP) and hydrotreat the heavy fraction. Refiners, however, should perform
the fractionation by undercutting the
FCC gasoline in the main fractionator
and then distill the heavy gasoline from
the light cycle oil (LCO) in a separate
column.
If the fractionation is performed on
the full-range FCC gasoline, the operating cost is too high and posttreatment
becomes unattractive economically. Revamping the FCC pretreater to increase
the catalyst volume offers the best
economics regardless of the relatively
higher capital expenditure.

FCC sulfur
In accordance with European Union
Directive 2003/17/EC, sulfur in automotive gasoline must be lower than 10
ppm starting Jan. 1, 2009. FCC gasoline
contains about 90% of the sulfur in the
finished gasoline pool. This is why the
main technologies to reduce gasoline
sulfur content are those that desulfurize
FCC gasoline.1
Two methods are used to reduce sulfur in FCC gasoline—FCC feed pretreatment and FCC gasoline posttreatment.
FCC feed pretreatment technologies
due to catalyst developments allow the
attainment of ultralow-sulfur levels
(50 ppm) in the FCC gasoline without
requiring a unit revamp.2
Sulfur less than 10 ppm (near-zero
sulfur) is difficult, however, for FCC
pretreating units. It is hard to achieve
without increasing the catalyst volume;
otherwise the cycle length would be
unacceptably lower.
Fig. 1 shows the relationship between FCC gasoline sulfur and FCC feed
sulfur from two independent sources.3 4
These data show that attaining 10-ppm
sulfur in the FCC gasoline requires an
FCC feed sulfur level of 100-200 ppm.
On the basis of results from the
Lukoil Neftochim Bulgaria (LNB) FCC
pretreating unit using a Haldor-Topsoe
TK-558 Brim catalyst,5 we estimated the
expected cycle length at a liquid hourly
space velocity of 1.2 hr-1 and an end-of-

run weighted average bed temperature
(WABT) of 398° C. (Fig. 2).
Fig. 2 shows that 150-ppm sulfur in
the FCC feed is possible for no longer
than 4 months and 200 ppm for 7
months. Such short cycle lengths are
difficult to justify economically.
A longer cycle length would require a revamp to increase the catalyst
volume. For example, the estimated
required catalyst volume to achieve an
18-month cycle length is 92% more
than the existing volume.
We therefore investigated the feasibility of combining pretreatment and
posttreatment technologies to attain
sulfur levels in the FCC gasoline of less
than 10 ppm with the aim to find an
optimum solution.

in octane number.7 8 That is why we
distilled the FCC gasoline in different fractions—to know the sulfur and
higher olefins distribution.
Table 1 shows that 60% of the sulfur
is in the fraction boiling greater than
140° C. and only 2% of total FCC gasoline olefins is in that fraction. Lowering
the IBP of the heavy gasoline increases
the high-octane olefins content and,
therefore, during hydrotreatment, a
greater loss of octane is expected. We
therefore distilled the FCC gasoline
into fractions greater than and less than
140° C. to keep the heavy gasoline’s
octane number as high as possible.
To discover the effect of fractionation cut point on octane loss during
heavy gasoline hydrotreatment, we also
fractionated the full-range FCC gasoline
into fractions boiling at greater than
and less than 100° C.
Table 3 summarizes the detailed
hydrocarbon composition of the heavy
FCC gasoline fractions before and after
hydrotreatment.

during a scheduled turnaround. This
case nevertheless looks significantly
better than those with FCC gasoline
fractionation and hydrotreating of the
heavy gasoline.
Even assuming a technology can
selectively hydrodesulfurize with no
octane loss,7 8 the high operating cost of
fractionation, which requires evaporating and condensing about 80% of the
full-range FCC gasoline, is the bottleneck for producing near-zero sulfur
FCC gasoline.
Moreover, sulfur in the full-range
FCC gasoline should be not more than
20 ppm, otherwise even with hydrodesulfurization of the heavy FCC gasoline,
the final blend would not achieve the
target of 10-ppm sulfur.

while producing near-zero sulfur gasoline. The fractionation, however, is only
attractive if it is carried out by undercutting the gasoline in the FCC main
fractionator and heavy gasoline distilled
from the LCO.
If the full-range FCC gasoline is
fractionated in a separate column, the
benefit of longer FCC unit availability
cannot offset the high fractionation
operating costs. If a revamp of the FCC
pretreater is feasible, this variant offers
the best economics regardless of the
relatively higher capital expenditure.

European efforts to secure dependable new natural gas supply sources

EU regulators have increased efforts

to weaken national oligopolies. Major
non-EU gas producers like Gazprom
and Sonatrach, meanwhile, are trying
to enter Europe’s attractive downstream
markets, including those in the UK,
Germany, and Italy.
Facing new obstacles in their domestic markets, European energy companies, utilities, and their financial backers
concurrently face increasing difficulties
in winning access to promising gas
fields beyond EU borders. They are contending with huge business risks as they
decide whether to stake out their own
positions or grow through mergers and
acquisitions to build the exploration,
production, and transportation infrastructure required to move gas from
wellhead to end-user.
EU governments, producers, and
consumers face two major hurdles.
Gas prices have risen sharply. The EU’s
increased reliance on gas to replace less
environmentally friendly coal in power
generation, along with a surge in new
energy demand from China and India,
have nearly doubled natural gas prices
during the past 2 years.
Capital costs are also rising. Investments in new pipeline and LNG
facilities already in the works are slated
to increase Europe’s gross transport
capacity by 27% by 2013. The global
gas industry is consolidating rapidly.
Mergers and acquisitions in the sector
have increased at 40%/year compounded over the past 3 years, to more than
$370 billion in 20072.
EU gas consumers also face ongoing
political uncertainty and heightened
security risks. Russia has shown that it
is prepared to flex its energy muscles
as a political weapon against its former Soviet and Warsaw Pact neighbors,
using the threat to shut off supplies to
force them to renegotiate long-term
contracts. Political instability across the
gas-rich nations of Central Asia, the
Middle East, and North Africa poses an
ongoing threat to the security of EU
energy markets.
Faced with these uncertainties,
Europe’s energy companies are looking
to diversify supply sources. Twenty-one

output of 101 billion cu m/year recently began a long-delayed new round
of bids for oil and gas leases.
Newcomers to the region face three
options: pursue upstream exploration and production leases, invest in
downstream export infrastructure by
building gas liquefaction terminals, or
both. Securing production facilities has
emerged as the preferred entry strategy.
Companies that invest in exploration
and production and can tap their own
gas supply for export face less risk
regarding the terms and volumes at
which supplies will be available.
Once a company commits to establishing an upstream presence, it must
decide whether to enter the market
by building a position from scratch
or acquiring a company already active
in the region. Companies that choose
to pursue an organic-growth strategy
by bidding for new lease concessions
must further decide whether to do
so alone or in partnership with other
companies.
A company that wins an exploration
and production concession must be
prepared to build an on-site organization in cooperation with local partners
and government agencies. It must also
navigate the sometimes intricate rules
governing joint ventures with stateowned partners.
Egypt has one of the more straight66

reserves, and production costs, important issues specific to North Africa’s
underdeveloped infrastructure require
consideration. Chief among these is
the distance from producing fields to
transportation and export facilities.
Companies that control existing pipelines or LNG ports, or holding a stake
in projected ones, would be especially
attractive acquisition targets.
The bottleneck in regional export
facilities remains particularly acute in
Egypt and Libya. ✦

forward and consistent regulatory
frameworks for exploration and development agreements, but the details remain important. A foreign firm entering
a 50-50 joint venture with EGAS, the
state-owned gas company, bears all initial exploration risks and development
costs. Once a field starts producing, the
contractor may recover its initial investment outlays and all operation costs
up to 40% of production. Any further
production is then split equally between
the contractor and EGAS.
Companies might choose to join
forces to lease concession rights with
other foreign partners already active in
North Africa, but will obviously still
need to perform thorough due diligence regarding the quality of the lease.
They must also establish clearly from
the outset how responsibilities will be
shared and then be prepared to manage the relationship. Entering a North
African market through partnerships,
however, can still serve as an effective
means of building local expertise and
establishing a successful long-term
presence.
The quality of a target company’s
lease concessions ranks among the most
important considerations for companies
wishing to enter North Africa through
acquisition. Beyond such standard key
indicators as the total volume of gas
reserves, the ratio of production to

New mud pump features ﬁve cylinders

The AWI-PS wireless pressure switch is
suited for use where accurate monitoring
is needed. Available in battery powered and
AC powered versions, the switch includes
the wireless transmitter, pressure switch,
and self-contained power source all in
one lightweight, rugged, case aluminum
enclosure.
The maker says the wireless pressure
switch provides tank farms, pipelines,
in-plant, and other industry applications
pressure monitoring and measurement
without the constraints of hard wiring.
The bellows pressure-sensing elements
in the pressure switch device are constructed from 316 stainless steel and offer
adjustable pressure ranges of as much
as 0-5,000 psi. The firm says the design
utilizes a switching mechanism that results
in improved life, repeatability, and lower
deadbands.
Fully integrated wireless pressure switch
This switch collects real time data and an option, the company notes.
A new, fully integrated, self-contained helps avoid costly cable and conduit runs,

wireless pressure switch is designed spe- lowers labor and material installation costs, Scott Fetzer Co., 4801 W. 150th St., Clevecifically for monitoring industry pressure. and monitors devices where cabling isn’t land, OH 44135.
The Quintuplex 2200 is the newest in a
line of mud pumps.
It features five cylinders instead of the
typical three cylinders, which helps reduce
piston rod load by more than 40%.
Its reduced pressure variation of more
than 70% (undampened) reduces mud
noise on the drillstring, which allows for
more efficient measurement while drilling
and logging while drilling, the company
says. The pump has a balanced eccentric
crankshaft supported by four main (continuous antifriction) roller bearings. Also,
its double (redundant) fail-safe internal
lube systems reduce wear on system components, the firm points out.

THE REMAINDER

September 30 – October 2, 2008
Hilton Fort Worth
Fort Worth, Texas USA

UNCONVENTIONAL GAS EXTRACTION BECOMING VIABLE
Production from unconventional reservoirs — tight gas sands, shales, and coalbeds--accounts for a large and growing share of total gas
supply. But the reservoirs are complex. The costs of drilling into and completing wells in them are continually rising while presenting unique
environmental problems. Producing gas from unconventional reserves proﬁtably, safely, and in amounts demanded by the market requires
increasingly sophisticated recovery methods.
Gas recovery from unconventional reserves will be explored on September 30 – October 2, 2008 at the
Unconventional Gas International Conference & Exhibition to be held at the Hilton Fort Worth, in Fort Worth,
Texas. Planned by the editors of Oil & Gas Journal and an Advisory Board of industry experts, the event will
highlight innovation from unconventional gas plays around the world.

Market hostility
a factor in global
economic tremors
For global investors, turmoil in credit
markets and economic deceleration aren’t
the only causes for worry. Political hostility
toward market freedom in the US represents strong inducement not to expose
capital to risk.
From the country that should lead the
world in its commitment to robust markets
come troubling signals of government
intrusion.

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

Democrats seeking their party’s presidential nomination, for example, sound
increasingly like socialists.
Sens. Hillary Clinton of New York and
Barack Obama of Illinois would nationalize
health care and extend the nationalization
of energy choice that began with the Energy Policy Act of 2005—she by taxing oil to
pay for government-sponsored energy, he
by spending $150 billion of public money
on uneconomic fuel.
They disparage the North American Free
Trade Agreement and other manifestations
of international commerce (see Clinton’s
recent tirade against the supposed menace
of outsourcing).
And what about the tax increase that
will clobber the US economy if rate cuts
aren’t extended in 2010? Under a President
Clinton or Obama, it’s a done deal.
Even before the presidential election,
economic horror looms. As fast as it can,
Congress is replacing economic energy
with the other kind and, in one of history’s
grandest political lies, calling it a good deal
for consumers. And the scale of economic
sacriﬁce that Americans will be forced to
make to their revved-up fears about globalwarming remains undetermined.
Now private companies are on notice
that politicians have a say in how much
money they make and how they invest it.
That’s the message from the House
Select Committee on Energy Independence
and Global Warming, the Democratic chairman of which on Apr. 1 lambasted oil-company proﬁts for being too large and speciﬁc
companies for not investing enough in
renewable energy.
In yet another hearing in which politicians pretend to want yet refuse to listen to
energy facts, Chairman Ed Markey of Massachusetts gave a new name to the current
US approach to energy: the “renewable
revolution.”
That’s cute but not descriptive. What’s
happening with energy aligns with a broader political assault on economic freedom
and should be called what it is: swindle.

Quarter ends with bang
The ﬂuctuation of crude futures prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange in
March ended the ﬁrst quarter of 2008 with a bang, said Paul Horsnell, Barclays Capital Inc., London. By Mar. 31, the average price for benchmark US light sweet crudes
was $97.82/bbl, “the highest quarterly average ever and $39.60/bbl higher than the
ﬁrst quarter of 2007,” Horsnell said.
As a result, nine investment banks increased their forecasts for average 2008
crude prices by $10/bbl or more, including three banks that raised their estimates
by at least $20/bbl, in what may be “the largest shift in consensus ever seen in any
single month,” said Horsnell. “Over the course of the ﬁrst quarter as a whole, the
consensus forecast for the average of West Texas Intermediate in 2008 has shifted up
by $14/bbl.”
At the start of the quarter, he said, “$100/bbl was something that attracted massive media coverage based on the angle of how exceptionally high a price it was. By
the end of the quarter, headlines such as ‘Oil prices slump to $100’ were becoming
commonplace, i.e., $100 has already gone from being seen as high to being seen as
a symptom of a weak market.”
Tristone Capital Inc., Calgary, raised its oil price estimate to $100/bbl for 2008-09.
The company expects forecasts of reduced economic growth to continue to diminish
demand for fuel among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, setting the stage for rebuilding global inventories in the second and
third quarters of 2008. Yet the ﬁrm also expects continued demand growth in China
and the Middle East to offset the slowdown among OECD countries.
With the US facing recession at a time of record high prices, OECD demand erosion might be more pronounced than envisaged. “With still-rising upstream costs
and the inevitable layering of environmental controls, we see $80-90/bbl WTI prices
necessary to support the growth in non-OPEC supply,” said Tristone Capital analysts.
Positions liquidated
In a 2-week period through Apr. 4, speculators liquidated some 60,000 crude contracts on the New York futures market, partly to cover cash calls following the demise
of Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., the ﬁfth largest US investment bank, said analysts at KBC
Process Technology Ltd., Surrey, England.
In early March, the net long speculative position on NYMEX hit a record high of
192,000 contracts, pushing crude futures prices to record levels above $110/bbl. But
because of the ﬁnancial turmoil following Bear Stearns, crude futures prices fell back
roughly $10/bbl. The May contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes jumped by
$2.40 to $106.23/bbl Apr. 4 on NYMEX.
KBC analysts said, “As US dollar exchange rates strengthened, speculators
rushed to liquidate oil futures length to cover Bear Stearns.” They said, “Speculative
funds are expected to ﬂow back into oil in April providing strong support to crude futures as continued US economic woes weigh on dollar exchange rates and equities.
Also, further tightening in US gasoline stocks will lead to greater investor responses
to reﬁnery outages and other bullish headline news.”
US gasoline inventories, which reached a 15-year high of 236 million bbl after an
unprecedented 18 weeks of consecutive increases, fell by 12 million bbl in March
as US reﬁners reduced runs to 82% of capacity, the lowest level since October 2005
after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita knocked out power and ﬂooded reﬁneries along the
Gulf Coast. As a result, US gasoline production had declined by 500,000 b/d to 8.5
million b/d by the end of March.
The Energy Information Administration said commercial US crude inventories
jumped 7.4 million bbl to 319.2 million bbl in the week ended Mar. 28. Gasoline
inventories fell 4.5 million bbl to 224.7 million bbl in the same week. Distillate fuel
stocks dropped 1.6 million bbl to 109.7 million bbl. NYMEX speculators focused their
attention on the gasoline draw. “There is still a 22 million bbl year-on-year excess in
US gasoline stocks, offset by shortfalls in crude (minus 11 million bbl) and distillate
fuel (minus 10 million bbl),” said KBC analysts. “On balance, overall US oil stocks are
more than adequate given an underlying drop in total demand of around 500,000
b/d. However, until stocks rise high enough to dampen the impact of headline news,
speculators will be selective in their responses. Gasoline stocks will continue to
be drawn down quite rapidly in the weeks ahead, providing support to speculative
length.”
